# Question

According to the International Narcotics Control Strategy Report released by the US State Department in 2018 and 2019, what was the situation of the drug control in countries around the world in 2017 and 2018?

# Choices

- A: In 2017, Bolivia was designated as a major illicit drug producing and/or drug transit country because the maximum area allowed for coca cultivation increased to 22,000 hectares, far exceeding the 1,000 hectare designation. The United States believes that Bolivia's justification for authorizing increased coca production is insufficient.
- B: Colombia eradicated more than 50,000 hectares of coca in 2017, but citizens are allowed to carry small amounts of cocaine in public. The Colombian government restricts the chemicals needed to process coca, but medicines containing ephedrine can be sold.
- C: The total amount of drugs seized through cases by the Counternarcotics Justice Center of Afghanistan decreased in the first nine months of 2018 compared with the same period last year. Afghan laboratories are not allowed to hold ammonium chloride.
- D: Both In 2017 and 2018, Venezuela was designated as a country that had clearly failed to comply with its obligations under international drug control agreements and therefore could not receive assistance from the United States.
