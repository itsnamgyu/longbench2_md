Legislative Basis for the INCSR 
 
The Department of State’s International Narcotics Control Strategy Report (INCSR) has been 
prepared in accordance with section 489 of the Foreign Assistance Act of 1961, as amended (the 
"FAA," 22 U.S.C. § 2291).  The 2018 INCSR, published in March 2018, covers the year January 
1 to December 31, 2017 and is published in two volumes, the second of which covers money 
laundering.  In addition to addressing the reporting requirements of section 489 of the FAA (as 
well as sections 481(d)(2) and 484(c) of the FAA and section 804 of the Narcotics Control Trade 
Act of 1974, as amended), the INCSR provides the factual basis for the designations contained in 
the President’s report to Congress on the major drug-transit or major illicit drug producing 
countries initially set forth in section 591 of the Kenneth M. Ludden Foreign Operations, Export 
Financing, and Related Programs Appropriations Act, 2002 (P.L. 107-115) (the "FOAA"), and 
now made permanent pursuant to section 706 of the Foreign Relations Authorization Act, Fiscal 
Year 2003 (P.L. 107-228) (the "FRAA").   
 
Section 706 of the FRAA requires that the President submit an annual report no later than 
September 15 identifying each country determined by the President to be a major drug-transit 
country or major illicit drug producing country.  The President is also required in that report to 
identify any country on the majors list that has "failed demonstrably . . . to make substantial 
efforts" during the previous 12 months to adhere to international counternarcotics agreements 
and to take certain counternarcotics measures set forth in U.S. law.  U.S. assistance under the 
current foreign operations appropriations act may not be provided to any country designated as 
having "failed demonstrably" unless the President determines that the provision of such 
assistance is vital to U.S. national interests or that the country, at any time after the President’s 
initial report to Congress, has made "substantial efforts" to comply with the counternarcotics 
conditions in the legislation.  This prohibition does not affect humanitarian, counternarcotics, 
and certain other types of assistance that are authorized to be provided notwithstanding any other 
provision of law.  
 
The FAA requires a report on the extent to which each country or entity that received assistance 
under chapter 8 of Part I of the Foreign Assistance Act in the past two fiscal years has "met the 
goals and objectives of the United Nations Convention Against Illicit Traffic in Narcotic Drugs 
and Psychotropic Substances (the "1988 UN Drug Convention").”  
 
Beginning in 2007, pursuant to The Combat Methamphetamine Enforcement Act (CMEA) (The 
USA Patriot Improvement and Reauthorization Act 2005, Title VII, P.L. 109-177), amending 
sections 489 and 490 of the Foreign Assistance Act (22 USC 2291h and 2291) section 722, the 
INCSR was expanded to include reporting on the five countries that export the largest amounts 
of methamphetamine precursor chemicals, as well as the five countries importing the largest 
amounts of these chemicals and which have the highest rate of diversion of the chemicals for 
methamphetamine production.  This expanded reporting also includes additional information on 
efforts to control methamphetamine precursor chemicals, as well as estimates of legitimate 
demand for these methamphetamine precursors, prepared by most parties to the 1988 UN Drug 
Convention and submitted to the International Narcotics Control Board.  The CMEA also 
requires a Presidential determination by March 1 of each year on whether the five countries that 
legally exported and the five countries that legally imported the largest amount of precursor

chemicals (under FAA section 490) have cooperated with the United States to prevent these 
substances from being used to produce methamphetamine or have taken adequate steps on their 
own to achieve full compliance with the 1988 UN Drug Control Convention.  This determination 
may be exercised by the Secretary of State pursuant to Executive Order 12163 and by the Deputy 
Secretary of State pursuant to State Department Delegation of Authority 245-2. 
 
Although the Convention does not contain a list of goals and objectives, it does set forth a 
number of obligations that the parties agree to undertake.  Generally speaking, it requires the 
parties to take legal measures to outlaw and punish all forms of illicit drug production, 
trafficking, and drug money laundering; to control chemicals that can be used to process illicit 
drugs; and to cooperate in international efforts to these ends.  The statute lists actions by foreign 
countries on the following issues as relevant to evaluating performance under the 1988 UN Drug 
Convention: illicit cultivation, production, distribution, sale, transport and financing, and money 
laundering, asset seizure, extradition, mutual legal assistance, law enforcement and transit 
cooperation, precursor chemical control, and demand reduction.  
 
In attempting to evaluate whether countries and certain entities are meeting the goals and 
objectives of the 1988 UN Drug Convention, the Department has used the best information it has 
available.  The 2018 INCSR covers countries that range from major drug producing and drug-
transit countries, where drug control is a critical element of national policy, to small countries or 
entities where drug issues or the capacity to deal with them are minimal.  The reports vary in the 
extent of their coverage.  For key drug-control countries, where considerable information is 
available, comprehensive reports are provided.  For some smaller countries or entities where 
only limited information is available, reports include whatever data the responsible post could 
provide.  
 
The country chapters report upon actions taken – including plans, programs, and, where 
applicable, timetables – toward fulfillment of Convention obligations.  Because the 1988 UN 
Drug Convention’s subject matter is so broad and availability of information on elements related 
to performance under the Convention varies widely within and among countries, the 
Department’s views on the extent to which a given country or entity is meeting the goals and 
objectives of the Convention are based on the overall response of the country or entity to those 
goals and objectives.  Reports will often include discussion of foreign legal and regulatory 
structures.  Although the Department strives to provide accurate information, this report should 
not be used as the basis for determining legal rights or obligations under U.S. or foreign law.  
 
Some countries and other entities are not yet parties to the 1988 UN Drug Convention; some do 
not have status in the United Nations and cannot become parties.  For such countries or entities, 
we have nonetheless considered actions taken by those countries or entities in areas covered by 
the Convention as well as plans (if any) for becoming parties and for bringing their legislation 
into conformity with the Convention’s requirements.  Other countries have taken reservations, 
declarations, or understandings to the 1988 UN Drug Convention or other relevant treaties; such 
reservations, declarations, or understandings are generally not detailed in this report.  For some 
of the smallest countries or entities that have not been designated by the President as major illicit 
drug producing or major drug-transit countries, the Department has insufficient information to 
make a judgment as to whether the goals and objectives of the Convention are being met.

Unless otherwise noted in the relevant country chapters, the Department’s Bureau for 
International Narcotics and Law Enforcement Affairs (INL) considers all countries and other 
entities with which the United States has bilateral narcotics agreements to be meeting the goals 
and objectives of those agreements.  
 
Information concerning counternarcotics assistance is provided, pursuant to section 489(b) of the 
FAA, in section entitled "U.S. Government Assistance."

Major Illicit Drug Producing, Drug-Transit, Significant Source, 
Precursor Chemical, and Money Laundering Countries  
 
Section 489(a)(3) of the FAA requires the INCSR to identify:  
(A) major illicit drug producing and major drug-transit countries;  
(B) major sources of precursor chemicals used in the production of illicit narcotics; or  
(C) major money laundering countries.  
These countries are identified below. 
 
Major Illicit Drug Producing and Major Drug-Transit Countries  
 
A major illicit drug producing country is one in which:  
(A) 1,000 hectares or more of illicit opium poppy is cultivated or harvested during a year;  
(B) 1,000 hectares or more of illicit coca is cultivated or harvested during a year; or  
(C) 5,000 hectares or more of illicit cannabis is cultivated or harvested during a year, unless the 
President determines that such illicit cannabis production does not significantly affect the United 
States.  [FAA § 481(e)(2)]  
 
A major drug-transit country is one:  
(A) that is a significant direct source of illicit narcotic or psychotropic drugs or other controlled 
substances significantly affecting the United States; or  
(B) through which are transported such drugs or substances. [FAA § 481(e)(5)]  
 
The following major illicit drug producing and/or drug-transit countries were identified and 
notified to Congress by the President on September 13, 2017, consistent with section 706(1) of 
the Foreign Relations Authorization Act, Fiscal Year 2003 (Public Law 107-228):  
 
Afghanistan, The Bahamas, Belize, Bolivia, Burma, Colombia, Costa Rica, Dominican 
Republic, Ecuador, El Salvador, Guatemala, Haiti, Honduras, India, Jamaica, Laos, 
Mexico, Nicaragua, Pakistan, Panama, Peru, and Venezuela.  
 
Of these 22 countries, Bolivia and Venezuela were designated by the President as having “failed 
demonstrably” during the previous 12 months to adhere to their obligations under international 
counternarcotics agreements and take the measures set forth in section 489(a)(1) of the FAA.  
The President determined, however, in accordance with provisions of Section 706(3)(A) of the 
FRAA, that continued support for bilateral programs to aid the people of Venezuela is vital to the 
national interests of the United States. 
 
Major Precursor Chemical Source Countries  
 
The following countries and jurisdictions have been identified to be major sources of precursor 
or essential chemicals used in the production of illicit narcotics:  
 
Afghanistan, Argentina, Bangladesh, Belgium, Bolivia, Brazil, Burma, Canada, Chile, 
China, Colombia, Costa Rica, Dominican Republic, Ecuador, Egypt, El Salvador, 
Germany, Guatemala, Honduras, India, Indonesia, Mexico, the Netherlands, Nigeria,

Pakistan, Peru, Republic of Korea, Singapore, South Africa, Switzerland, Taiwan, 
Thailand, the United Kingdom, and Venezuela.  
 
Information is provided pursuant to section 489 of the FAA in the section entitled "Chemical 
Controls." 
 
Major Money Laundering Countries  
 
A major money laundering country is defined by statute as one “whose financial institutions 
engage in currency transactions involving significant amounts of proceeds from international 
narcotics trafficking” [FAA § 481(e)(7)].  More information on the methodology is set forth in 
Volume II of the INCSR in the section entitled "Legislative Basis and Methodology for the 
INCSR."  The following countries/jurisdictions have been identified this year in this category:  
 
Afghanistan, Albania, Algeria, Antigua and Barbuda, Argentina, Armenia, Aruba, 
Azerbaijan, Bahamas, Barbados, Belgium, Belize, Benin, Bolivia, Bosnia and Herzegovina, 
Brazil, British Virgin Islands, Burma, Cabo Verde, Cambodia, Canada, Cayman Islands,

Presidential Determination No. 2017-12 
 
MEMORANDUM FOR THE SECRETARY OF STATE 
 
SUBJECT:  Presidential Determination on Major Drug Transit or Major Illicit Drug Producing 
Countries for Fiscal Year 2018 
 
Pursuant to Section 706(1) of the Foreign Relations Authorization Act, Fiscal Year 2003 (P.L. 
107-228) (FRAA), I hereby identify the following countries as major drug transit and/or major 
illicit drug producing countries:  Afghanistan, The Bahamas, Belize, Bolivia, Burma, Colombia, 
Costa Rica, Dominican Republic, Ecuador, El Salvador, Guatemala, Haiti, Honduras, India, 
Jamaica, Laos, Mexico, Nicaragua, Pakistan, Panama, Peru, and Venezuela. 
 
A country’s presence on the foregoing Majors List is not a reflection of its government’s 
counternarcotics efforts or level of cooperation with the United States.  Consistent with the 
statutory definition of a major drug transit or drug producing country set forth in section 481(e) 
(2) and (5) of the Foreign Assistance Act of 1961, as amended (FAA), the reason major drug 
transit or illicit drug producing countries are placed on the list is the combination of geographic, 
commercial, and economic factors that allow drugs to transit or be produced, even if a 
government has carried out the most assiduous narcotics control law enforcement measures. 
 
Pursuant to Section 706(2)(A) of the FRAA, I hereby designate Bolivia and Venezuela as 
countries that have failed demonstrably during the previous 12 months to adhere to their 
obligations under international counternarcotics agreements and take the measures set forth in 
section 489(a)(1) of the FAA.  Included with this determination are justifications for the 
designations of Bolivia and Venezuela, as required by Section 706(2)(B) of the FRAA.   
 
In addition, the United States government seriously considered designating Colombia as a 
country that has failed demonstrably to adhere to its obligations under international 
counternarcotics agreements due to the extraordinary growth of coca cultivation and cocaine 
production over the past three years, including record cultivation during the last 12 months.  
Ultimately, Colombia is not designated because the Colombian National Police and Armed 
Forces are close law enforcement and security partners of the United States in the Western 
Hemisphere; they are improving interdiction efforts; and have restarted some eradication that 
they had significantly curtailed beginning in 2013.  I will, however, keep this designation under 
section 706(2)(A) of the FAA as an option, and expect Colombia to make significant progress in 
reducing coca cultivation and production of cocaine.

I have also determined, in accordance with provisions of Section 706(3)(A) of the FRAA, that 
support for programs to aid the people of Venezuela are vital to the national interests of the 
United States. 
 
You are hereby authorized and directed to submit this report, with its Bolivia and Venezuela 
memoranda of justification, under Section 706 of the FRAA, to the Congress, and publish it in 
the Federal Register.

MEMORANDUM OF JUSTIFICATION FOR MAJOR ILLICIT 
DRUG TRANSIT OR ILLICIT DRUG PRODUCING 
COUNTRIES FOR FY 2018 
 
Bolivia 
 
During the past 12 months, the Bolivian government has failed demonstrably to make sufficient 
efforts to meet its obligations under the international counternarcotics agreements or to uphold 
the counternarcotics measures set forth in Section 489 (a)(1) of the Foreign Assistance Act 
(FAA) of 1961, as amended (FAA).  Bolivia fails to account for excess coca production; it 
remains a major transit country for Peruvian coca; and it lacks adequate controls over its internal 
coca markets.  Serious shortcomings in arrests and prosecutions expose its judicial system as 
ineffective in dealing with producers and traffickers.  
 
According to coca cultivation estimates from the United States government, the Government of 
Bolivia, and the UN Office on Drugs and Crime (UNODC), Bolivia remains the third largest 
producer of cocaine in the world.  Cocaine cultivation in Bolivia continues to increase, rising 
three percent to 37,500 hectares in 2016 from 36,500 in 2015.  Potential pure cocaine production 
in Bolivia increased eight percent to 275 metric tons from 2015 to 2016.  
 
Until 2017, Bolivian law permitted 12,000 hectares of licit coca production per year.   In 
practice, the Government of Bolivia has allowed the cultivation of more than 20,000 hectares of 
coca, breaching Bolivian legal limits by more than 60 percent.  In March 2017, President Evo 
Morales signed into law a bill that replaces Bolivia’s former counternarcotics law and nearly 
doubles the previous production, increasing the area available for licit coca production from 
12,000 to 22,000 hectares.  In addition to excessive production levels, Bolivia’s inadequate 
controls over its legal coca markets are a matter of concern. 
 
Most Bolivian cocaine does not reach the United States, but is exported to other Latin American 
countries, especially Brazil, for domestic consumption or for onward transit to West Africa and 
Europe.  Bolivia is also a major transit zone for Peruvian cocaine.  Peruvian officials estimate 
that as much as 50 percent of all Peruvian cocaine departs to or through Bolivia over land or via 
aerial transshipment. 
 
Bolivia has yet to adopt regulations that could permit it to enhance its counterdrug efforts under 
its new substance control laws (Laws 906 and 913, respectively).  For example, Law 913 permits 
asset forfeitures, wire taps, and payments to informants.  These tools should enhance Bolivian 
law enforcement’s counternarcotics efforts, but will not until implementation of appropriate 
regulations.  Further, Law 906 faces legal challenges alleging it unlawfully legalizes coca 
cultivation in areas that are outside of “traditional” coca cultivation zones, and encourages the 
industrialization and export of coca derivatives.   
 
Bolivia should strengthen efforts to stem the diversion of coca for cocaine processing by 
tightening controls over the coca leaf trade, achieve net reductions in coca cultivation, and 
improve law enforcement and judicial efforts to investigate and prosecute drug-related criminal

activity.  Coca yields have increased, but there are no recent accurate studies on coca crop or 
coca-to-cocaine yields.  The new substance control law (Law 913) does permit asset forfeitures, 
wire taps and payments to informants, which should provide Bolivian law enforcement with 
improved tools and funding for future counternarcotics efforts, but not until appropriate 
regulations for implementation are established. 
 
The United States government has not maintained a counternarcotics presence in Bolivia since 
2013.  United States officials, however, consult with international organizations and third-party 
governments involved in supporting Bolivian efforts to strengthen drug control, meet with 
Bolivian counternarcotics officials, and provide limited training to Bolivian law enforcement and 
customs officials.  On July 6, 2017, the Bolivian National Customs office signed a Customs 
Mutual Assistance Agreement with the United States government that permits information 
exchanges and collaboration to prevent illegal shipments and related criminal activities, 
including drug trafficking.   
 
Increased Bolivian counternarcotics cooperation with other countries and in international fora 
would be welcome.  Aerial drug smuggling between Peru and Bolivia continues to be a pressing 
issue that calls for improved cooperation between those two countries.  Bolivia met with Chile in 
January 2017 to enhance bilateral cooperation on drug enforcement, after a long lapse since the 
previous such meeting.  Subsequent unrelated disputes between the two countries, however, 
could affect cooperation between them in the near future.  Bolivia should energetically 
implement and enhance bilateral counternarcotics and law enforcement agreements with Brazil, 
Paraguay, and Argentina.  
 
In 2013, Bolivia re-acceded to the 1961 U.N. Single Convention on Narcotic Drugs with a 
reservation permitting coca to be used only within Bolivia for traditional, cultural, and medicinal 
purposes.  Despite these stated conditions, Bolivia continues to promote the use of coca in other 
countries, and the Government of Bolivia has publicly stated it intends to expand the export of 
coca and coca-derivative products.  These actions, in combination with the Government of 
Bolivia’s recent substantial increase in licit coca production limits, and its failure to adequately 
control coca production and licit coca markets, continue to undermine Bolivia’s commitments to 
its international drug control obligations. 
 
In accordance with United States legislation, the determination that Bolivia has failed 
demonstrably to make substantial efforts to adhere to its obligations under international 
counternarcotics agreements and to take counternarcotics measures set forth in the FAA results 
in the withholding of certain kinds of U.S. assistance, with exceptions for humanitarian and 
counternarcotics assistance under the FAA.  United States assistance to and relations with 
Bolivia are extremely limited.  In addition, United States assistance to and relations with Bolivia 
are extremely limited.  It is not in the vital interest of the United States to grant a national interest 
waiver to Bolivia pursuant to Section 706 of the Foreign Relations Authorization Act of Fiscal 
Year 2003 (FRAA), given that any assistance necessitating such a waiver is neither contemplated 
by the United States nor actively pursued by the Government of Bolivia.

MEMORANDUM OF JUSTIFICATION FOR MAJOR DRUG 
TRANSIT OR ILLICIT DRUG PRODUCING COUNTRIES FOR 
FY 2018 
 
Venezuela 
 
During the past 12 months, the Venezuelan government failed demonstrably to make sufficient 
efforts to meet its obligations under the international counternarcotics agreements or to uphold 
the counternarcotics measures set forth in section 489 (a)(1) of the Foreign Assistance Act of 
1961, as amended (FAA).  Despite these failures, a national interest waiver, under Section 706 of 
the Foreign Relations Authorization Act of Fiscal Year 2003 (FRAA), for Venezuela in 2018 
will permit support for United States government-funded bilateral assistance programs vital to 
the national interest of the United States, such as democracy building and human rights advocacy 
that support the people of Venezuela.  Such a waiver is appropriate in light of the President 
Nicholas Maduro regime’s draconian turn. 
 
Venezuela remained a major drug-transit country in 2017.  Venezuela is one of the preferred 
trafficking routes for illegal drugs, predominately cocaine, from South America to the United 
States through the Caribbean region and Central America, due to its porous western border with 
Colombia, weak judicial system, sporadic international counternarcotics cooperation, and 
permissive and corrupt environment.   
 
From 2013 to 2016, cocaine production increased threefold in neighboring Colombia.  Despite 
this increase, Venezuelan seizures of illegal drugs have decreased dramatically.  The Venezuelan 
National Anti-Narcotics Office (ONA) reported seizing only 32 metric tons of drugs during the 
first six months of 2016, compared to 66 metric tons during the first eight months of 2015.   
 
Previously active in the Organization of American States (OAS) Inter-American Drug Abuse 
Control Commission (CICAD), Venezuela formally informed the OAS on April 29, 2017, of its 
intent to withdraw from the OAS.  The exit process will take 24 months, during which time 
Venezuela may continue to participate in CICAD.  Venezuela remains party to other relevant 
agreements, such as the Inter-American Convention against Terrorism, the Inter-American 
Convention against Corruption, and the Inter-American Convention on Mutual Assistance in 
Criminal Matters. 
 
Public corruption, including among senior government officials, is a major problem in 
Venezuela, making it easier for drug-trafficking organizations to smuggle illegal drugs.  
Additionally, the Venezuelan government has yet to take action against multiple senior officials 
who have been indicted for drug trafficking activities.   
 
On February 13, 2017, under the Foreign Narcotics Kingpin Designation Act, the United States 
designated Venezuelan Executive Vice President Tareck El Aissami pursuant to the Foreign 
Narcotics Kingpin Designation Act for his involvement in international narcotics trafficking 
activities.  El Aissami facilitated, coordinated, and protected other narcotics traffickers operating 
in Venezuela.  Specifically, El Aissami received payment for the facilitation of drug shipments

belonging to Venezuelan drug kingpin Walid Makled Garcia.  El Aissami also is linked to the 
coordination of drug shipments to Los Zetas, a violent Mexican drug cartel, as well as to the 
protection of Colombian drug lord Daniel Barrera Barrera and Venezuelan drug trafficker 
Hermagoras Gonzalez Polanco.   
 
On August 1, 2016, the United States unsealed indictments against General Nester Luis Reverol 
Torres, the former director of ONA and former commander of the Venezuelan National Guard, 
and Edylberto Jose Molina Molina, the former sub-director of ONA, for participating in an 
international conspiracy to traffic cocaine.  On August 3, 2016, President Nicolas Maduro 
appointed Reverol as Minister of Interior, Justice, and Peace, giving him responsibility for 
overseeing both ONA and the Venezuelan National Guard.    
 
In November, 2016, a United States Federal court in New York convicted nephews of 
Venezuelan first lady Cilia Flores – Efrain Campo Flores and Francisco Flores de Freitas – of 
conspiracy to traffic 800 kilograms of cocaine to the United States.  
 
Despite Venezuela’s demonstrable failure to meet its obligations under the international 
narcotics control agreements, a national interest waiver under section 706 of the FRAA is 
approved to enable certain United States bilateral assistance programs to continue.  Pursuant to 
the FAA, humanitarian and counternarcotics assistance does not require a waiver.

Overview 
 
As required by the Foreign Assistance Act of 1961, this annual edition of the International 
Narcotics Control Strategy Report provides an overview of global efforts taken in 2017 to 
confront the threats posed by the production, trafficking, and use of illicit drugs.  Illicit drugs are 
a universal challenge that takes different forms in various countries and regions, and the specific 
circumstances of over 80 countries and jurisdictions are described at length in this report.  The 
differences are overshadowed, however, by the common harms inflicted by illegal drugs on 
communities across the globe – from overdose deaths, to families shattered by addiction, and 
widespread corruption of government institutions.  In some drug source and transit countries, 
illicit drug production and trafficking undermines peace and security and threatens the stability 
of key U.S. allies.   
 
International narcotics control witnessed some significant setbacks in 2017, particularly in some 
major drug source countries that experienced marked increases in the production of some of the 
most dangerous illicit drugs.  Fortunately, there is a strong global consensus in favor of vigorous 
enforcement efforts and sustained international cooperation to dismantle the transnational 
criminal organizations responsible for fueling drug addiction, combined with well-resourced and 
evidence-based approaches to reducing illicit drug use.  The United States is committed to 
preventing international drug trafficking networks from harming Americans, and will deploy all 
available means at its disposal, both domestically and internationally, to confront this challenge.   
 
Domestically, as outlined in President Trump’s National Security Strategy, the United States will 
support public health efforts to halt the growth of illicit drug use in the United States, expand 
national and community-based prevention efforts, increase access to evidenced-based treatment 
for addiction, improve prescription drug monitoring, and provide training on substance use 
disorders for medical personnel.   
 
Internationally, where the vast majority of the most dangerous illicit drugs originate, the United 
States will focus efforts to reduce drug supplies at their source and dismantle the transnational 
criminal organizations that profit from them.  We will build upon partner nation efforts to reduce 
crime and corruption in key drug source and transit countries, including by supporting efforts to 
professionalize police and other security forces.  The United States will also continue its 
assistance to committed governments to strengthen the rule of law and undertake judicial reform, 
and to improve information sharing with our law enforcement partners, targeting criminals and 
corrupt leaders and disrupting illicit trafficking.  Much work remains to be done, and new 
challenges continue to emerge requiring urgent and creative responses backed by unwavering 
political commitment from like-minded governments. 
 
In the United States, stemming our country’s ongoing opioid crisis is one of the most urgent 
priorities of President Trump’s administration.  On October 26, 2017, President Trump identified 
the opioid crisis as “the worst drug crisis in American history” and declared it a public health 
emergency, directing U.S. Federal agencies to use all appropriate emergency authorities 
to reduce the number of opioid deaths.  Because this opioid crisis is increasingly fueled by heroin 


INCSR 2018 Volume 1 
 
Policy and Program Developments 
 
15 
 
and synthetic opioids produced outside of the United States, our frontline efforts at reducing the 
availability of these drugs begins abroad.   
 
More than 90 percent of the heroin available in the United States originates in Mexico, trafficked 
into the United States by powerful and violent transnational criminal organizations.  Rising 
seizure totals indicate that trafficking of the synthetic opioid fentanyl across the U.S.–Mexico 
border may have also increased in 2017, often in the form of pills disguised as prescription 
medications for sale in illicit markets.  Confronting this complex transnational threat will require 
closely coordinated efforts from both governments, and the United States and Mexico have one 
of the most extensive bilateral law enforcement relationships in the world as a foundation on 
which to build.  To further broaden cooperation, the United States and Mexico held two Cabinet-
level meetings of the Strategic Dialogue on Disrupting Transnational Criminal Organizations in 
2017.  The United States also engaged with Mexico and Canada at the 2017 North American 
Drug Dialogue to produce the first ever Trilateral Assessment on Opioid Trafficking.  These 
ongoing dialogues are advancing efforts to disrupt drug trafficking in our hemisphere and end 
impunity for the transnational criminal organizations profiting from it.   
 
The United States and Mexico will continue to strengthen cooperation to interdict illegal drugs, 
dismantle criminal organizations, and cut off their sources of funding.  Through the Merida 
Initiative, the United States is helping to build the capacity of Mexican authorities to more 
effectively eradicate opium poppy, disrupt and prosecute drug production and trafficking, and 
enhance border security.  Continued U.S. support for Mexico’s efforts to reform its judicial 
institutions will help bring criminals to justice. 
 
The United States will also pursue additional cooperation with China to reduce the production 
and trafficking of illicit fentanyl and fentanyl analogues originating from this key source country.  
In 2017, the United States and China regularly shared law enforcement information on new and 
emerging fentanyl analogues and illegal manufacturing and trafficking activity.  This cooperation 
was accompanied by China’s decision to implement domestic regulatory controls of precursor 
chemicals and fentanyl analogues, which ultimately support criminal prosecutions.    
 
The synthetic opioid threat is not unique to the United States.  Canadian authorities reported that 
65 percent of all analyzed heroin seizure samples tested over the first six months of 2017 
contained fentanyl or its analogues.  European authorities have also reported deaths attributable 
to heroin adulterated with clandestinely produced fentanyl and its analogues, and in November 
2017, the European Monitoring Centre for Drugs and Drug Addiction reported over 60 deaths 
over the prior year within the European Union associated with the use of carfentanil – a fentanyl 
analogue with a potency10,000 times that of morphine.  The United States will continue to raise 
international awareness of the threat of synthetic opioids and lead efforts to develop new and 
innovative law enforcement and regulatory responses to combat fentanyl trafficking.   
 
International cooperation is particularly important to counter the growing use of postal services 
and express consignment shipments to traffic fentanyl and other synthetic drugs.  Increasingly, 
criminal entrepreneurs based abroad are trafficking fentanyl and other dangerous drugs directly 
to buyers in the United States and other countries, accepting orders via the internet.  It is 
essential to improve information sharing between national law enforcement authorities to better 


INCSR 2018 Volume 1 
 
Policy and Program Developments 
 
16 
 
identify suspected traffickers and trafficking patterns, including enhanced capabilities to target 
mailed and shipped parcels for inspection.  Toward this goal, the United States is working within 
the Universal Postal Union to expand international capacities to provide advance electronic data 
for mail shipments to better target suspected illicit trafficking. 
 
Although it is not a leading source of heroin available within the United States, Afghanistan 
remains the world’s dominant source of illicit opiates, dominating markets in Canada, Europe, 
and elsewhere.  The total area of land under opium poppy cultivation increased by 63 percent 
during the 2017 growing season from the previous year, and raw opium production increased by 
an estimated 88 percent.  Illicit cultivation, production, trade, and use of illicit drugs undermine 
public health and good governance in Afghanistan, while fueling corruption, providing 
significant funding for insurgents, and eroding security.  The Afghan government must 
demonstrate the necessary political will and capacity to combat corruption, develop alternative 
economic livelihoods, and establish security in the poppy cultivating communities controlled by 
insurgent forces – responsibilities that the United States remains committed to supporting.  
 
While addressing the opioid crisis ranks as our most urgent drug control challenge, the increased 
availability of cocaine within the United States has led to greater consumption and rising 
cocaine-related overdose fatalities.  Like heroin, all cocaine available in the United States 
originates abroad, and over 90 percent is estimated to originate in Colombia, where coca 
cultivation and cocaine production exceeded all-time record levels in 2016 (the most recent year 
for which information is available).  The increased flow of cocaine also puts enormous pressure 
on the law enforcement capacity of transit states, particularly in Central America and Mexico, 
and feeds growing consumption in Europe and other markets.   
 
The Colombian government recognizes the threats posed by the drug trade and took concrete 
steps in 2017 to position itself to halt and eventually reverse the troubling coca cultivation and 
cocaine production trend.  Through continued aggressive interdiction efforts, Colombian 
authorities seized hundreds of metric tons of cocaine during the year, and the Colombian 
government notably improved its forced eradication efforts by manually eradicating 
approximately 52,283 hectares (ha) of coca through mid-December – more than double the 
amount during all of 2016.  The illicit drug trade and the organized criminal groups it empowers 
are among the greatest threats to peace and security in Colombia, and the U.S.-Colombia law 
enforcement partnership remains among the strongest in the world.  As President Trump stated in 
the Presidential Determination on Major Drug Transit or Major Drug Producing Countries for 
Fiscal Year 2018, the U.S. government will continue to closely monitor implementation of 
Colombia’s drug control strategy to ensure progress is made in reducing coca cultivation and 
cocaine production.   
 
In addition to cocaine and opioids, methamphetamine remains a prevalent threat, with most of 
the methamphetamine available in the United States being produced in Mexico and smuggled 
across the Southwest Border.  The United States will also continue to monitor the impact of 
changing laws regarding the production and sale of cannabis and cannabis products.  Given that 
international trafficking in illicit cannabis continues to earn substantial revenues for transnational 
criminal organizations, the United States will continue to interdict cannabis and enforce its 
Federal drug control laws aggressively.

Transnational criminal organizations thrive where governments are weak, corruption is rampant, 
and faith in government institutions is low.  The United States is committed to targeting the 
leaders of the most dangerous criminal organizations and dismantling their support 
infrastructure.  We will assist countries to break the power of these organizations and networks, 
and our international assistance will focus on all the links in the supply-to consumer chain:  the 
processing and distribution stages; the interdiction of drug shipments; and attention to the money 
trail that fuels this illegal trade.  Our programs will concentrate resources to those areas where 
we can achieve sustained results, through the right combination of effective law enforcement and 
efforts to reduce demand for illicit drugs.  Our public deserves no less, and nearly all countries 
share our challenge and support our goals.  The United States will lead global efforts to achieve 
further progress against illicit drugs in partnership with committed allies.

Demand Reduction 
 
Drug demand reduction is a key foreign policy tool for addressing the interconnected threats of 
drugs, crime, and violence.  It is also a critical component in efforts to stop the spread of 
HIV/AIDS and other toxic adulterants found in illicit substances.  Consequently, the goal of 
demand reduction strategies calls for a comprehensive, balanced approach to the drug-problem 
that targets prevention, treatment, recovery, research, and international cooperation.   
 
Recognizing that drug addiction is a major public health threat, and that drug addiction is a 
preventable and treatable disease, many countries are requesting INL-sponsored technical 
assistance to improve development of effective policy and programs.  INL works closely with 
international partners to coordinate and execute capacity building and training activities for 
service providers in drug prevention, treatment, and recovery.  INL also promotes the sharing of 
critical information and evidence-based studies to preserve the stability of societies  threatened 
by the narcotics trade. 
 
The drug demand reduction program has four pillars: (1) develop the drug demand reduction 
workforce, (2) professionalize drug treatment and prevention services, (3) build global networks 
and community coalitions, and (4) address populations with special clinical needs.  In achieving 
these objectives, INL supports the following: 
 Capacity building, training, mentoring, and credentialing aimed to educate governments 
and public organizations on evidence-based practices in drug prevention, treatment and 
recovery; 
 Development of drug-free community coalitions internationally, involving law 
enforcement and public/private social institutions; 
 Research, development, and evaluation efforts to determine the effectiveness of drug 
prevention and treatment programs; and  
 Development of innovative tools to increase knowledge of and decrease deaths caused by 
toxic adulterants found in illicit substances.  
 
Recognizing that there are gender differences in the development and pattern of substance use 
disorders, INL is also supporting technical assistance addressing gender-related substance use 
disorders and related violence.   
 
Significant completed and ongoing INL-funded demand reduction projects for 2017 include: 
 
Global Treatment Mapping:  INL is partnering with five international organizations to map 
treatment capacity in Asia, Africa, and Latin America.  The mapping will form a living registry 
of all substance use disorder treatment services and indicate the type of services offered, targeted 
groups, and capacity, among other issues.  The mapping will help identify the characteristics of 
national treatment systems and areas requiring assistance. 
 
Universal Prevention Curriculum:  INL’s Universal Prevention Curriculum (UPC) consists of 
two series, one for coordinators/managers of prevention programs and one for prevention 
implementers/prevention workers.  This training program is based on the United Nations Office 
on Drugs and Crime (UNODC) Standards for Drug Use Prevention, offering innovative 


INCSR 2018 Volume 1 
 
Policy and Program Developments 
 
19 
 
evidence-based approaches to drug prevention in a variety of settings such as family, school, 
workplace, media, and the community.  The development of examinations and an International 
Certified Prevention Specialist credential is in the process of being developed.  The effectiveness 
of this INL program is currently being evaluated in collaboration with the Cayetano Heredia 
University in Lima, Peru. 
 
Regional Treatment Training:  INL supports the work of the Colombo Plan, UNODC, and  the 
Organization of American States to establish a national-level training and certification system for 
drug addiction counselors, aimed at improving the delivery of drug treatment services and 
management skills in select countries of Asia, Africa, and Latin America.  This 
professionalization of treatment leads to higher quality interventions, improved treatment 
outcomes, lower relapse rates, and overall greater confidence in the treatment system.  The basic 
level of the Universal Treatment Curriculum is currently being utilized in over 60 countries. 
Advanced course dissemination began in January 2017. 
 
Pregnant and Addicted Women:  INL collaborated with UNODC, the World Health 
Organization, and Johns Hopkins University to create the first universal protocols for 
pharmacological detoxification and psycho-social interventions for the treatment of pregnant and 
addicted women.  The guidelines for the treatment of substance use disorders during pregnancy 
will provide guidance and support for front-line service providers around the world in 
developing treatment and prevention interventions for pregnant women.  These guidelines are 
currently being translated into several of the official World Health Organization languages and 
will be disseminated worldwide. 
 
Child Addiction Initiative:  INL is supporting the development of evidence-based training to 
establish effective and appropriate drug prevention and treatment practices to young children 
(aged 12 and under) exposed to drugs.  This initiative is in response to increasing reports of acute 
and growing substance use disorders among children in Asia, Africa and South America, where 
age-appropriate treatment may be unavailable or not scientifically sound.  Working with a panel 
of global child drug addiction experts, INL developed six child-focused psychosocial and 
pharmacological treatment training courses to serve as a tool to help strengthen international 
capacities in this field.  This program is being implemented through Colombo Plan and UNODC 
in collaboration with the University of North Carolina. 
 
Women Drug Treatment Initiatives:  INL supports research-based prevention, treatment, and 
recovery programs in high-risk countries to improve services for addicted women and their 
children, a chronically under-served and stigmatized population.  INL’s Guiding the Recovery of 
Women (GROW) curriculum addresses the unique needs of women with substance use disorders 
across the globe.  The full curriculum has been translated into Spanish and all 10 courses have 
been trained and echo-trained to treatment providers throughout Peru. 
 
LGBT Community: INL collaborated with the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services 
to develop a course addressing the intersection of substance use, sexual orientation and gender 
identity.  The experiential and interactive course allowed participants to learn hands-on strategies 
and how to create a more inclusive space for this vulnerable population.

Intranasal Naloxone Feasibility Study:  In 2016, INL supported UNODC and the World 
Health Organization to begin a feasibility study on intranasal naloxone at the community level.  
In some countries, injectable naloxone is effectively used for opioid overdose prevention.  This 
feasibility study will look at the adaptability of the medication using the intranasal form of 
naloxone in other countries.  Field assessments were conducted in Ukraine, Tajikistan, 
Kyrgyzstan, and Kazakhstan.   
 
Development of the International Consortium of Universities for Drug Demand Reduction 
(ICUDDR):  In June 2017, INL and a consortium of international organization partners and 
universities from around the world held its second ICUDDR meeting in partnership with Charles 
University in Prague, Czech Republic.  The ICUDDR is a network of universities working 
together to promote academic programs in addition studies (drug prevention and treatment) to 
further the dissemination of evidence-based practices and develop the drug demand reduction 
workforce.  In 2017, this network established an advisory board for each region to coordinate 
training, academic programs, exchanges, and technical assistance between the universities. 
 
Drug-Free Communities:  INL assists civil society and grassroots organizations to form and 
sustain effective community anti-drug coalitions aimed at preventing substance use disorders in 
their communities.  INL support has resulted in the establishment of over 204 active coalitions in 
20 countries around the world (Bolivia, Brazil, Cabo Verde, Costa Rica, Ghana, Guatemala, 
Haiti, Honduras, Indonesia, Iraq, Kenya, Kyrgyzstan, Mexico, Peru, Philippines, Senegal, South 
Africa, Tajikistan, Togo, and Uruguay). 
 
Research Programs:  Evaluations are an important tool to help identify and determine where 
resources can be effective.  INL’s latest evaluation conducted the first drug use survey that 
included toxicological testing in Afghanistan, the first survey of its kind to be completed 
anywhere in the world.  The survey revealed that 31 percent of all households in Afghanistan, 
and 11 percent of the population as a whole tested positive for one or more drugs, with drug use 
three times greater in rural than urban areas of the country.  As a result of the survey, INL is 
plans to expand treatment to rural areas and initiate a new prevention program to mainstream 
prevention across the government ministries.

Methodology for U.S. Government Estimates of Illegal Drug 
Production 
 
Introduction 
 
Illicit drug crops are grown, refined into illegal drugs, trafficked, and sold on the street by 
criminal enterprises that attempt to conceal every step of the process. Accurate estimates of such 
criminal activity are difficult to produce.  The estimates of illicit drug production presented in the 
INCSR represent the United States government’s best effort to assess the current dimensions of 
the international drug problem.  They are based on agricultural surveys conducted with satellite 
imagery and scientific studies of crop yields and the likely efficiency of typical illicit refining 
labs.  As we do every year, we publish these estimates with an important caveat: they are 
estimates.  While we must express our estimates as numbers, these numbers should not be seen 
as precise figures.  Rather, they represent the midpoint of a band of statistical probability that 
gets wider as additional variables are introduced and as we move from cultivation to harvest to 
final refined drug.  
 
As needed, the United States government revises its estimate process and occasionally the 
estimates themselves – in the light of field research and technological advancements.  The 
clandestine, violent nature of the illegal drug trade makes field research difficult.  Geography is 
also an impediment, as the harsh terrain on which many drugs are cultivated is not always easily 
accessible.  This is particularly relevant given the tremendous geographic areas that must be 
covered and the difficulty of collecting reliable information over diverse and treacherous terrain.  
Weather can affect our ability to gather data, particularly in the Andes, where cloud cover can be 
a major problem.   
 
Improved technologies and analytical techniques may also lead us to produce revisions to United 
States government estimates of potential drug production.  This is typical of annualized figures 
for most other areas of statistical tracking that must be revised year to year.  When possible, we 
apply these new techniques to previous years’ data and adjust appropriately, but often, especially 
in the case of new technologies, we can only apply them prospectively.  These illicit drug 
statistics represent the current state of the art.  As new information and technology becomes 
applicable, the accuracy of the estimates will improve. 
 
Cultivation Estimates 
 
The Unites States government conserves limited personnel and technical resources by employing 
sample survey methodologies to estimate illicit crop cultivation and concentrating survey efforts 
on areas with strategic amounts of illegal cultivation or areas most likely to have illicit crop 
cultivation.  Each year, analysts review a variety of datasets – including eradication data, seizure 
data, law enforcement investigations information, previous field locations, and other information 
– to determine areas likely to have illegal cultivation, and revise and update the search area, if 
necessary.  They then survey and estimate cultivation in new areas using proven statistical 
techniques. 
 


INCSR 2018 Volume 1 
 
Policy and Program Developments 
 
22 
 
The resulting estimates meet the U.S. government’s need for an annual estimate of illicit crop 
cultivation for each country.  They also help with eradication, interdiction, and other law 
enforcement operations.  As part of the effort to provide accurate and comprehensive 
assessments, the areas surveyed are often expanded and modified, so direct comparison with 
previous year estimates is sometimes not possible.   
 
Production Estimates 
 
Illicit crop productivity depends upon a number of factors.  Changes in weather, farming 
techniques, soil fertility, and disease prevalence can produce widely varying yields from year to 
year and place to place.  Some illicit drug crop areas are not easily accessible to the U.S. 
government, which can make scientific information difficult to obtain.  However, we continually 
strive to improve our drug production estimates.  The relative productivity of poppy crops in 
some cases can be estimated using imagery, and our confidence in coca leaf yield continues to 
improve as a result of field studies conducted in Latin America.  Coca fields which are less than 
18 months of age (“new fields”) produce much less leaf than mature fields.  In Colombia, for 
example, fields on average get their first small harvest at six months of age; in Bolivia and Peru, 
fields are usually first harvested at 12 months of age.  The U.S. government estimates include the 
proportion of new fields detected each year and adjust leaf production accordingly. 
 
Processing Estimates 
 
The wide variation in processing efficiency achieved by narcotics producers complicates the task 
of accurately assessing the quantity of cocaine or heroin that could be refined from a crop.  
Differences in the origin and quality of the raw material and chemicals used, the technical 
processing method employed, the size and sophistication of laboratories, the skill and experience 
of local workers and chemists, and decisions made in response to enforcement pressures all 
affect production.   
 
The U.S. government estimates for coca leaf, cocaine, marijuana, opium, and heroin production 
are potential estimates; that is, it is assumed that all of the coca, cannabis, and poppy grown is 
harvested and processed into illicit drugs.  This is a reasonable assumption for coca leaf in 
Colombia.  In Bolivia and Peru, however, the U.S. government potential cocaine production 
estimates do not remove for coca leaf locally chewed and used in products such as coca tea.  In 
Southwest and Southeast Asia and Latin America, it is not unrealistic to assume that virtually all 
poppy is harvested for opium gum, but substantial amounts of Asian opium are consumed or 
stored rather than being processed into heroin; the proportion of this opium ultimately processed 
into heroin is unknown. 
 
Other International Estimates 
 
The United States helps fund estimates done by the United Nations in some countries.  These 
estimates use different methodologies from the U.S. government assessments, and utilize a mix 
of imagery and ground-based observations.  The UN estimates are often used to help determine 
the response of the international donor community to specific countries or regions.

There have been some efforts, for the U.S. government and the UN to understand each other’s 
methodologies with the goal of improving both sets of estimates.  These efforts are ongoing. 
 
This report also includes data on drug production, trafficking, seizures, and consumption that 
come from host governments or non-governmental organizations.  Such data is attributed to the 
source organization, especially when we cannot independently verify it.

Notes: 
 
 
 
Rounded values. 
 
 
 
Opium production is reported at zero percent moisture. 
 
 
 
Some Asian opium is consumed and not processed into heroin. 
 
Pakistan opium production:  Estimates use yield values from similar growing areas in 
Afghanistan because of the lack of Pakistan yield data. 
 
Guatemala opium production:  Estimates use yield values from Mexico because of the lack of 
Guatemala yield data.  
 
Colombian opium production:  Production estimates in 2014 and 2009 were backcaset in 2015 
with newly available data. 
 
Mexico opium production:  2011 and later surveys incorporate a major methodological change; 
2007-2010 estimates have therefore been removed. 
 
Potential Latin American heroin:  Combined potential heroin production estimates for Mexico, 
Guatemala, and Colombia.  The 2011 estimate does not include Guatemala or Colombia.  The 
2012-2013 estimates do not include Colombia.  
 
Andean cocaine production:  Production estimates for 2008-2015 were adjusted in 2016 based on 
increases in immature plant productivity.

*Not included on this list is the “State of Palestine,” which the United Nations informed the 
Government of the United States on April 9, 2014 had purportedly acceded to the UN 
Convention against Corruption.  Similarly, on January 6, 2015, the United Nations informed the 
Government of the United States that the “State of Palestine” had purportedly acceded to the UN 
Convention against Transnational Organized Crime.  The Government of the United States of 
America notified the United Nations that it does not believe the “State of Palestine” qualifies as a 
sovereign state and does not recognize it as such.  Therefore, the Government of the United 
States of America believes that the “State of Palestine” is not qualified to accede to the 
Conventions and does not believe that it is in a treaty relationship with the “State of Palestine” 
under the Conventions.

International Training 
 
International counternarcotics training is managed and funded by the U.S. Department of State’s 
Bureau of International Narcotics and Law Enforcement Affairs (INL), and implemented by 
various U.S. law enforcement organizations including the Drug Enforcement Administration 
(DEA), the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI), Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE), 
U.S. Customs and Border Patrol (CBP), and U.S. Coast Guard.  Major objectives are: 
 
•  Contributing to enhanced professionalism of the basic rule of law infrastructure for carrying 
out counternarcotics law enforcement activities in countries which cooperate with and are 
considered significant to U.S. narcotics control efforts; 
 
•  Improving technical skills of drug law enforcement personnel in these countries; and 
 
•  Increasing cooperation between U.S. and foreign law enforcement officials. 
 
INL-funded training supports U.S. counternarcotics priorities worldwide, and focuses on 
encouraging foreign law enforcement agency self-sufficiency.  The overarching goal of U.S. 
counternarcotics training is to support the development of effective host country enforcement 
institutions, capable of removing drugs from circulation before they can reach the United States.  
U.S training can take two forms: as part of a planned bilateral assistance program in target 
partner countries; and as regional training with international participants from multiple countries.  
The regional training provided at International Law Enforcement Academies (ILEAs) consists of 
both general law enforcement training as well as specialized training for mid-level managers in 
police and other law enforcement agencies. 
 
U.S. bilateral training assistance program works closely with international organizations 
including the UN Office on Drugs and Crime (UNODC) and the Organization of American 
States.  The United States coordinates assistance planning with other donors through 
mechanisms such as the Dublin Group (an informal body of countries and organizations that 
provide law enforcement training), and the Paris Pact (an informal network of states dedicated to 
stopping the spread of Afghan opiates).  The United States continuously works to promote 
burden-sharing with our allies in the provision of training, as well as ensuring that our respective 
efforts are complementary and directed towards common goals. 
 
International Law Enforcement Academies (ILEAs) 
 
The International Law Enforcement Academies (ILEAs) pursue three core objectives: building 
the capacity of foreign criminal justice partners of the United States to stop crime before it 
impacts the United States; fostering partnerships across national borders within important 
regions of the world; and advancing partner nations’ engagement with U.S. law enforcement 
agencies.  These academies are an important part of the interagency U.S. effort to combat 
transnational criminal organizations.  
   
Since the first ILEA opened in Budapest in 1995, the program has grown to six facilities 
worldwide, and has provided training to approximately 70,000 students in from countries in 


INCSR 2018 Volume 1

36 
Africa, Europe, Asia, and across Latin America.  The ILEA program hosts approximately 150 
courses per year.  The program implements a number of key programming initiatives including 
an anticorruption course series, countering violent extremism-focused courses, and executive-
level symposiums on combating transnational criminal organizations. Training includes 
specialized skill development and tactics in law enforcement areas such as counternarcotics; 
investigating money laundering and financial crimes; cybercrime investigations; border control; 
and countering all forms of trafficking including weapons, wildlife, and trafficking in persons.  
ILEA also works with senior officers and administrators on principles of leadership and effective 
management at ILEA Roswell.  The ILEAs help to develop an extensive network of alumni who 
exchange information with their regional and U.S. counterparts and assist in transnational 
investigations.  Many ILEA graduates become the leaders and decision-makers in their 
respective law enforcement organizations.  The Department of State coordinates with the 
Departments of Justice, Homeland Security and Treasury, and with foreign government 
counterparts to implement the ILEA program. 
 
Africa.  ILEA Gaborone (Botswana) opened in 2001 and the Regional Training Center in Accra 
(Ghana) opened in 2012  ILEA Gaborone delivers one multi-week leadership and development 
courses annually and also specialized courses for police and other criminal justice officials to 
boost their capacity to work with U.S. and regional counterparts.  These courses concentrate on 
specific methods and techniques in a variety of subjects, such as anticorruption, financial crimes, 
border security, crime scene investigations, counternarcotics, explosives, trafficking in weapons 
and wildlife, gender-based violence, and community policing.  A Regional Training Center is 
operated in Accra, Ghana, in coordination with the ILEA, and addresses the unique needs of the 
West African region.  ILEA Gaborone and RTC Accra provided training to approximately 1,600 
students in 2017 
 
Asia.  ILEA Bangkok (Thailand) opened in 1999, and focuses on enhancing regional cooperation 
against transnational crime threats in Southeast Asia.  ILEA Bangkok’s specialized courses focus 
on counternarcotics, anticorruption, financial crimes, environmental crimes, and trafficking in 
persons, weapons, and wildlife ILEA Bangkok trained approximately 980 students in 2017. 
 
Europe.  ILEA Budapest (Hungary) was the first ILEA and was established in 1995.  ILEA 
Budapest delivers three  multi-week leadership and development courses annually and also offers 
specialized courses on regional threats such as anticorruption, organized crime, cybercrime, 
financial crimes, women in law enforcement, gender-based violence, and  specialized training for 
judges and prosecutors.  ILEA Budapest trained approximately 990 students in 2017. 
 
Global.  ILEA Roswell (New Mexico) opened in September 2001.  ILEA Roswell hosts senior 
officials including top prosecutors, judges, police commanders and lawmakers to discuss policy 
formulation and enforcement to facilitate an effective criminal justice system in these priority 
areas.  These delegates are at the senior levels of leadership and decision making in their 
countries, and are positioned to implement substantive changes to the criminal justice systems 
upon their return.  Unlike other ILEAs, ILEA Roswell draws senior officials from all 
participating ILEA countries.  ILEA Roswell trained approximately 330 students in 2017.

Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) 
  
The mission of the DEA is to enforce the controlled substances laws and regulations of the 
United States.  As part of this mission, DEA seeks to bring to justice the criminal organizations 
and principal members of Drug Trafficking Organizations (DTOs) based in the United States or 
foreign nations involved in the cultivation, manufacture, or distribution of controlled substances, 
as well as, the money laundering of illicit finances derived from drug trafficking.  
 
To achieve this mission, DEA has nearly 10 percent of its Special Agent and Intelligence Analyst 
work force permanently assigned overseas at 90 DEA foreign offices located in 69 countries.  
DEA’s foreign offices act as conduits of actionable and strategic information, intelligence, and 
evidence to law enforcement and prosecutorial components in the United States and vice versa.  
In this manner, DEA is able to identify, target, and dismantle the entire global spectrum of the 
DTO.  DEA’s foreign offices are tasked with four principle missions:  
 
 Conduct bilateral and multilateral investigations with host law enforcement partners;  
 Coordinate counternarcotic intelligence gathering with host governments;  
 Implement training programs for host country police and prosecutor agencies;  
 Support the advancement and development of host country drug law enforcement 
institutions. 
 
The emphasis placed on each objective is determined by the host nation’s unique conditions and 
circumstances as it relates to their drug trafficking threat, infrastructure and law enforcement 
capabilities.  DEA works side-by-side with host nation counterparts to develop relevant training, 
promote intelligence sharing, conduct bilateral investigations, and support joint counter-drug 
operations.  The vast majority of DEA’s foreign efforts and resources are dedicated to 
conducting international drug and drug money laundering investigations.  In addition to that 
mandate, in 2017 DEA dedicated considerable effort in the fields of training, multinational law 
enforcement collaboration, and forensic science. 
 
International Training:  In 2017, DEA’s Training Division conducted 129 formal (bilateral) 
and multilateral seminars for over 3,667 participants from 94 countries.  DEA has been 
conducting international counter-narcotics training since its creation in 1973.  DEA is recognized 
as the world pioneer in international training and serves as the model for a variety of 
international law enforcement training efforts.  The specific courses and curricula offered by 
DEA have evolved over the years in response to experiences, changes in law enforcement 
emphasis, current international narcotics trafficking situations, new technologies, and specific 
requests of the host governments.  All DEA international training programs have as a major 
objective the building of regional working relationships between countries.  
 
International Drug Enforcement Conference (IDEC) - Strengthening International 
Relations:  In 1983, IDEC was established to institutionalize regional cooperation of drug law 
enforcement officials from countries within the Western Hemisphere.  Over the years IDEC has 
evolved into an important global forum where the highest ranking agency leaders and prosecutors 
from around 115 countries gather to develop a cooperative vision and establish strategies for 
combating DTOs.  Participants continue to build, balance, and integrate the tools of law 


INCSR 2018 Volume 1 
 
 
 
 
USG Assistance 
 
39 
enforcement power to combat these criminal networks and build a framework for international 
cooperation to protect all our citizens from the violence, harm, and exploitation wrought by drug 
trafficking and commensurate threats to national security.  IDEC is an operational targeting 
opportunity and global forum for important topical issues in international drug enforcement, and 
to identify and attack DTO vulnerabilities.  IDEC initiatives have demonstrated that a 
multilateral enforcement approach has a cumulative effect as member nations increasingly 
coordinate their law enforcement efforts to investigate and prosecute major DTOs and their 
leaders and to seize and block their assets.  The 35th annual IDEC is scheduled for April 2018 in 
Rotterdam, Netherlands, where it will be co-hosted by the Dutch National Police and DEA. 
 
The Special Testing and Research Laboratory’s Programs:  The Heroin and Cocaine 
Signature Programs (HSP/CSP) at the DEA’s Special Testing and Research Laboratory (STRL) 
determine the geographic origins of heroin and cocaine seizure samples.  In addition, the 
laboratory maintains a Methamphetamine Profiling Program (MPP) that determines the synthetic 
routes and precursors employed in producing methamphetamine.  The classification schemes for 
these programs were developed using authentic samples collected from drug source countries 
world-wide, as well as drug processing laboratories within those countries.  By collaborating 
with partner nations, numerous such “authentics” are submitted annually to the laboratory from 
the DEA foreign offices.  Currently, the laboratory classifies several thousand drug exhibits 
seized within the United States and abroad annually.   
 
The Signature and Profiling Programs provide the counterdrug intelligence community with 
science-based heroin and cocaine source data and intelligence information regarding 
methamphetamine synthesis.  The HSP, CSP, and the MPP are viewed as crucial tools to 
investigate and support strategic intelligence regarding illicit production, trafficking, and 
availability of these three high profile drugs within the United States and foreign countries.  Over 
the past several years, the laboratory has established a robust Emerging Trends Program to 
analyze new psychoactive substances for enforcement and intelligence purposes.  This group has 
identified over 400 synthetic cannabinoids, substituted cathinones, opioids and powerful 
hallucinogenic compounds that have come into the drug market.   
 
To assist with addressing the nation’s current opioid crisis, STRL developed and implemented a 
new Fentanyl Signature Profiling Program (FSPP).  Through an in-depth analysis including 
quantitation, impurity profiling, isotopic characterization, and occluded solvents analysis, the 
FSPP provides unique science-based forensic investigative leads on seizures where linkages 
were unknown or only suspected; real-time data to investigators; answers to key questions from 
the counterdrug intelligence/enforcement community and U.S. policymakers; and direct support 
to the National Drug Control Strategy.  Since its inception, this program has established 36 
linkages involving 65 cases and 152 samples from DEA seizures of 250 kilograms of fentanyl.  
 
Office of Global Enforcement/Financial Investigations (OGF):  The DEA’s Office of Global 
Enforcement/Financial Investigations (OGF) provides guidance to DEA’s domestic and foreign 
offices, as well as international law enforcement agencies, on issues relating to all aspects of 
financial investigations.  OGF works in conjunction with DEA offices, foreign counterparts, and 
other agencies to effectively identify the financial infrastructure supporting drug trafficking 
organizations and provide its financial expertise to fully dismantle and disrupt all aspects of these 


INCSR 2018 Volume 1 
 
 
 
 
USG Assistance 
 
40 
criminal organizations.  Additionally, OGF facilitates cooperation between countries, resulting in 
the identification and prosecution of drug money laundering organizations as well as the seizure 
of assets and the denial of revenue.  OGF regularly briefs and educates United States diplomats, 
foreign government officials, and military and law enforcement counterparts regarding the latest 
trends in money laundering; drug-terrorism financing; international banking; offshore 
corporations; international wire transfers of fund; and financial investigations.  
  
In conjunction with the DEA Office of International Training, OGF conducts training for foreign 
counterparts to share strategic ideas and promote effective techniques in financial investigations.  
During 2017, OGF assisted with a Money Laundering Seminar for Guatemalan prosecutors and 
investigators.  In addition, OGF, in coordination with the Department of State, participated in a 
money laundering technical exchange working group with officials from Dubai in The Emirates; 
consulted with law enforcement counterparts in Bogota, Colombia, on financial investigations 
and programs; participated in money laundering and organized crime working groups with law 
enforcement officials in Dublin, Ireland and Sibiu, Romania; participated in a virtual currency 
money laundering working group in Helsinki, Finland; met with government officials in 
Bangkok, Thailand regarding money laundering issues involving the banking industry; 
participated in a Regional Target Workshop in Mexico City, Mexico; as well as met with police 
counterparts from the Netherlands in support of ongoing illicit currency bilateral investigations 
and programs.

United States Coast Guard (USCG) 
 
The USCG plays a crucial role in efforts to keep dangerous narcotic drugs moving by sea from 
reaching the United States.  Working within the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) in 
carrying out its responsibilities within the National Drug Control Strategy, the USCG maintains a 
multi-faceted, layered approach to attack Transnational Organized Crime (TOC) networks and 
their transport of illicit contraband from South America toward the United States via the 
Caribbean Sea, the Eastern Pacific Ocean, and through the littorals of Central America and 
Mexico.  The overarching strategy is to increase maritime border security through a layered 
offensive system that extends beyond U.S. land borders to attack the networks responsible for 
smuggling drugs.  This system begins overseas, spans the offshore regions, and continues into 
U.S. territorial seas and ports.  USCG’s mix of cutters, aircraft, boats, and deployable specialized 
forces, as well as international and domestic partnerships, allow the Coast Guard to leverage its 
unique maritime law enforcement authorities and competencies to address threats and improve 
security throughout the maritime domain.   
 
Coast Guard efforts focus on removing illicit drugs close to their origins and as far from U.S. 
shores as possible, where drug shipments are in their most concentrated bulk form.  Moreover, 
these illicit cargoes are most vulnerable when they are being moved at sea through international 
waters where interdiction forces have the highest tactical advantage and best opportunity to 
interdict drug movements.  The next step in the maturation of maritime law enforcement is 
conducting operations to disrupt and dismantle the TOC networks by targeting any illicit activity 
in which they are engaged, to include drug, migrant, weapons and bulk cash smuggling, human 
trafficking and illegal, unreported, or unregulated fishing.   
 
Counternarcotics Operations:  Detection of drug-trafficking vessels occurs principally through 
the collection, analysis, and dissemination of tactical information and strategic intelligence 
combined with effective sensors operating from land, air and surface assets.  The six million 
square mile transit zone is far too expansive to randomly patrol; targeting information is 
necessary to focus efforts.  Upon detection, U.S. and partner nation law enforcement agencies 
provide monitoring, relaying data, imagery and position information until an appropriate 
interdiction asset arrives on scene.  The USCG is the lead U.S. federal agency for drug 
interdiction on the high seas, and takes tactical control of U.S. and Allied assets for the 
interdiction and apprehension operational phase.  A crucial ingredient for continued maritime 
drug interdiction success is the USCG’s counter drug bilateral agreements and operational 
procedures held with over 40 partner nations.  By facilitating operational communications and 
enabling USCG law enforcement officers to stop, board, and search vessels suspected of illicit 
maritime activity, these agreements deter smugglers from using another nation’s vessel and/or 
territorial seas as a haven from U.S. law enforcement efforts.   
 
International Cooperative Efforts:  In 2017, USCG had personnel permanently assigned 
overseas as Coast Guard Liaison Officers, Defense Attachés, and Support to Interdiction and 
Prosecution team members to facilitate maritime counter drug activities, including security 
assistance, intelligence collection and dissemination, and to liaise with the U.S. interagency and 
international community.  The USCG, in concert with the Department of State, hosts three 
counter drug summits per year: two semi-annual Multilateral Maritime Counter Drug Summits 


INCSR 2018 Volume 1 
 
 
 
 
USG Assistance 
 
42 
(Central and South America) and an annual Multilateral Maritime Interdiction and Prosecution 
Summit (Caribbean).  These summits have a combined annual attendance of more than 35 
countries, over 60 international agencies and more than 300 people.  Topics include maritime 
interdiction, prosecution, criminal investigations, and improving regional success in all aspects 
of the interdiction continuum.  To counter trans-Atlantic drug flows, the USCG continues to 
work with U.S. Africa Command (AFRICOM) to expand maritime training and operations for 
West African countries through the African Maritime Law Enforcement Partnership (AMLEP).  
 
International Training and Technical Assistance:  The USCG provides international training 
and technical assistance to enhance the interdiction capacities of international partners.  The 
Technical Assistance Field Team (TAFT), a joint initiative between USCG and the U.S. 
Southern Command (SOUTHCOM), is a team of nine USCG engineers and logisticians whose 
purpose is to professionalize and improve the operational readiness of 11 Caribbean maritime 
forces through technical assistance visits.  The USCG’s Security Assistance Program offers both 
resident training programs and mobile training teams (MTTs) to partner nation maritime services 
around the world to advance the capability of their naval and coast guard forces.  In Fiscal Year 
2017, the USCG deployed 66.5 MTTs to 39 countries, and approximately 249 students from 76 
countries attended 38 resident courses at USCG training installations. 
 
Operational Highlights:  In Fiscal Year 2017, the USCG expended over 2,600 cutter days, 
nearly 1,400 Airborne Use of Force capable helicopters days, and over 3,100 surveillance aircraft 
hours on counter drug patrols, and  USCG  Law Enforcement Detachments (LEDET) deployed 
for nearly 800 days aboard U.S. Navy, British, Dutch and Canadian warships.  As a result, the 
USCG disrupted 289 drug smuggling attempts, which included the seizure of 207 vessels, 
detention of 708 suspected smugglers for further investigation and prosecution, and removal of 
223.8 metric tons (MT) of cocaine and 12.8 MT of marijuana.

U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) 
 
The Department of Homeland Security’s U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) processes 
all goods, vehicles, and people entering and exiting the United States.  CBP officers are charged 
with identification and prevention of terrorist travel to the United States and interception of 
narcotics and other contraband, improperly classified merchandise, unlicensed technology and 
material, weapons, ammunition, fugitives, undocumented immigrants, and unreported currency 
at America’s 329 international ports of entry (POEs). 
 
United States Border Patrol (USBP) agents are assigned the mission of securing the border 
against all threats between the POEs along the over 8,000 miles of land and coastal border.  
These threats include criminal/undocumented aliens, drug smugglers, potential terrorists, wanted 
criminals, and persons seeking to avoid inspection at the designated POEs.  CBP’s drug 
interdiction activity includes staffing 35 permanent and 140 tactical checkpoints nationwide.  
CBP checkpoints utilize experienced agents, canine teams, technology, and shipper-CBP 
partnerships to detect and apprehend the above mentioned threats.  Additionally, agents patrol 
targeted border areas that are frequent entry points for the smuggling of drugs and people into the 
Unites States. 
 
Since its creation, CBP has also been charged with the border regulatory functions of passport 
control and agriculture inspections in order to provide comprehensive, seamless border control 
services.  This merger of responsibilities is intended to simplify border security operations and is 
termed: "One face at the border."  CBP is the nation’s first line of defense against the 
introduction of narcotics and dangerous drugs from foreign sources. 
 
U.S. Customs and Border Protection's (CBP) Air and Marine Operations (AMO) is a critical 
component of CBP's risk-based and layered approach for border security.  With 1,200 federal 
agents, 235 aircraft, and 296 marine vessels operating throughout the United States and Puerto 
Rico.  AMO interdicts unlawful people and cargo approaching U.S. borders, investigates 
criminal networks and provides domain awareness in the air and maritime environments, and 
responds to contingencies and national taskings.   
 
International Training and Assistance:  As part of its efforts to extend the nation’s zone of 
security beyond U.S. ports of entry, CBP works with other U.S. government and foreign 
government partners to provide a wide array of short-term and long-term technical training and 
assistance to countries throughout the world in conjunction with the Department of State, as 
appropriate.  These programs are designed to standardize and build the capacity of foreign 
government organizations to implement more effective customs trade operations, border 
policing, and immigration inspection.   
 
International Visitors Program:  The State Department’s International Visitors Program can 
provide an opportunity for foreign customs officials and other foreign officials to consult with 
their U.S. counterparts and appropriate high level managers in CBP Headquarters.  International 
visitors can also participate in on-site tours of selected U.S. ports and field sites to observe actual 
CBP operations.

Port of Entry Interdiction Training:  The correct approach to border interdiction varies with 
border environments, i.e., land, seaport, rail and airport.  Training has been designed for the 
problems encountered and interdiction techniques useful for each type of operation.  CBP also 
provides specialized U.S. Border Patrol training in techniques used by smugglers who do not use 
official ports of entry to cross borders, but who attempt to smuggle contraband in lightly 
patrolled green border areas. 
 
International Bulk Currency Smuggling Training:  With an increased enforcement focus on 
money laundering, organized criminals and terrorists have turned to bulk cash smuggling to 
move valuables across borders.  Bulk Currency Smuggling training assists foreign government 
enforcement personnel in identifying techniques used by bulk currency smugglers.  Further, it 
helps international partners to design and implement programs to counter that threat, resulting in 
seizures of millions of dollars in the proceeds of crime. 
 
Overseas Enforcement Training:  Overseas Enforcement Training encompasses a curriculum 
which includes Border Enforcement Training; Supply Chain Security; Detection, Interdiction 
and Investigation; Concealment Methods; Bulk Currency Smuggling; False and Fraudulent 
Documents; Train-the-Trainer; Anti-Corruption; Targeting and Risk Management; Hazardous 
Materials; and X-ray Systems.  These courses can also be conducted at foreign ports of entry.  
They include both basic training and refresher training/mentoring abroad for graduates of 
training at U.S. port facilities.   
 
CBP Attachés, Representatives and Advisors and Special Customs’ Programs:  
A growing network of attachés, representatives and advisors who serve in U.S. diplomatic 
missions, U.S. military bases, or directly for foreign border security agencies.  Attachés have a 
broad mandate, including enforcement and investigative activities on behalf of CBP.  They also 
exchange expert information with foreign counterparts, improving the effectiveness of law 
enforcement activity, policies, and resources relating to border enforcement.  Their efforts help 
to ensure that enforcement cooperation is seamless across borders and that the battle against 
illegal transnational activity is effective. 
 
Customs Mutual Assistance Agreements: CBP and U.S. Immigration and Customs 
Enforcement (ICE) co-lead negotiations on Customs Mutual Assistance Agreements (CMAAs).  
CMAAs are negotiated with foreign governments and provide for mutual assistance in the 
enforcement of customs-related laws.  Under the provisions of CMAAs, CBP provides assistance 
to its foreign counterparts and receives reciprocal assistance from them primarily in the exchange 
of information that facilitates the enforcement of each country’s laws.  As of the end of Fiscal 
Year 2017, the United States had signed 80 CMAAs, with three being signed during Fiscal Year 
2017.  CMAAs also provide a foundational basis for the development and implementation of 
other subsequent cooperation-based arrangements with foreign partners, especially as it relates 
initiatives that require information sharing and protections related thereto.   
 
CBP Preclearance Field Office:  Preclearance provides for the inspection and clearance of 
commercial air passengers prior to departure from 15 locations in six foreign countries and seven 
time zones.  Precleared travelers do not have to undergo a second CBP inspection upon arrival in 
the U.S.  All mission requirements are completed at the preclearance port of entry prior to 


INCSR 2018 Volume 1 
 
 
 
 
USG Assistance 
 
45 
departure, including customs, immigration and agriculture inspections.  Passengers found to be 
inadmissible to the United States are denied aircraft boarding.   
 
National Targeting Center:  The National Targeting Center (NTC) collaborates with 
international partners to identify, disrupt, and manage risks in the cargo and passenger 
environments through information sharing and implementing joint targeting operations in 
accordance with memoranda of understanding and CMAAs.  As part of this collaboration, the 
Center hosts representatives from participating foreign agencies, and works with these 
international liaisons, as well as with other U.S. government agencies, to detect and disrupt 
narcotic smuggling operations and drug trafficking organizations and their associates. 
 
DOD Preclearance:  The Customs Border Clearance Agent (CBCA) program is designed to 
permit cargo consigned to the care of Department of Defense (DoD), as well as returning 
military personnel, to be pre-cleared for import/entry into the Customs Territory of the United 
States.  The pre-clearance of such cargo and personnel is accomplished by DoD personnel that 
have been trained by CBP officers to perform pre-clearance inspections.  CBCA personnel 
conduct Customs and Agricultural inspections and certify that personnel and cargo have met all 
CBP and USDA entry requirements, as well as Defense Travel Regulations, prior to departing to 
the U.S.  CBCA inspections are conducted at 28 locations in seven foreign countries throughout 
the Middle East.  CBP officers also provide Technical Assistance Visits and annual Site 
Inspections/Certifications at these DoD preclearance facilities.

Introduction 
 
Preventing criminals from gaining access to the precursor chemicals needed to produce illicit 
drugs remains one of the key international drug control challenges.  Because most precursor 
chemicals have widespread legitimate commercial uses and criminals need to divert only small 
fractions of legitimate trade to produce illicit drug supplies, global chemical control efforts have 
achieved uneven results.  One key goal of the 1988 UN Drug Convention is to prevent diversion 
of precursor chemicals from legitimate trade.  Effective efforts require strong national laws and 
regulatory regimes in line with the commitments of the 1988 UN Drug Convention, as well as 
close coordination between national regulatory authorities and effective cooperation with 
industry.     
 
Chemicals have two roles in producing illicit drugs and psychotropic substances; as refining 
agents and solvents used to process plant-based materials such as coca and opium poppy; and as 
essential ingredients in synthetic drug compounds.  Some of the most widely-known chemicals 
used to produce plant-based drugs include potassium permanganate (used to produce cocaine) 
and acetic anhydride (used to produce heroin), and preventing illicit diversion of these chemicals 
remains an ongoing challenge.  Chemicals used as key ingredients to produce synthetic drugs 
have shifted more regularly, as criminals shift to new production methods and new designer 
formulas to avoid international legal controls and detection.  International cooperation and 
information sharing is essential for keeping pace with emerging trends in this field.  
 
In 2017, the international community elevated efforts to prevent diversion of precursor chemicals 
used in the illicit production of fentanyl, a powerful synthetic opioid responsible for many 
thousands of deaths in North America and elsewhere.  In March, the United Nations Commission 
on Narcotic Drugs (CND) decided, at the urging of the United States and other countries, to 
require all state parties to the 1988 UN Drug Convention to control the two key precursor 
chemicals used to produce illicit fentanyl; 4-anilino-N-phenethylpiperidine (ANPP) and N-
phenethyl-4-piperidone (NPP).  This binding international obligation went into effect in October, 
and serves as a prime example of how the international drug control system can swiftly react to 
address emerging drug control challenges and threats to public health, and take concrete action to 
save lives. 
 
Also at the March CND, UN member states adopted a U.S.-sponsored resolution on precursor 
chemical control endorsing increased international cooperation to identify emerging precursor 
chemicals and prevent the diversion of chemicals not scheduled for international control under 
the 1988 UN Drug Convention.   
 
The International Framework 
 
The 1988 UN Convention is the legal framework for international cooperation to prevent 
precursor chemical diversion.  Specifically, state parties to the convention are required, under 
Article 12, to monitor their international trade in the chemicals listed in Tables I and II of the 
Convention.  These chemicals have legitimate industrial uses and the tables are updated regularly 
to account for changes in the manufacture of illicit drugs.  State parties are required to share 
information with one another and with the International Narcotics Control Board (INCB) on their 


INCSR 2018 Volume 1 
 
 
 
 
Chemical Controls 
 
48 
 
international transactions involving these chemicals to identify and prevent diversion for illicit 
purposes.  Article 12, Sections 8 and 9 of the Convention requires licensing or similar control of 
all persons and enterprises involved in the manufacture and distribution of the listed chemicals.   
 
Resolutions from the CND – the treaty-based body within the UN system with prime 
responsibility for international drug-control policy – have provided additional guidance to States 
parties on how to implement their obligations according to specific best practices.  These 
resolutions have also encouraged greater dissemination and use of the INCB’s International 
Special Surveillance List (ISSL) – a mechanism for monitoring chemicals that are not regulated 
by the Convention but for which substantial evidence exists of their use in illicit drug 
manufacture.   
 
At the 2017 CND, member states adopted a Precursor Chemical resolution sponsored by the 
United States endorsing proactive measures to prevent diversion of non-controlled precursor 
chemicals.  The recommended measures included raising stakeholder awareness, applying 
monitoring measures with respect to these chemicals to prevent their diversion, working with the 
chemical industry (including importers, exporters, and brokers), utilizing the INCB-based pre-
notification and incident reporting systems, and enhancing national laboratory capacity to 
identify and detect newly emerging precursor chemicals. 
 
The INCB is an independent, quasi-judicial monitoring body for the implementation of the three 
UN international drug control conventions – the 1988 UN Drug Convention, the Single 
Convention on Narcotic Drugs of 1961 as amended by the 1972 Protocol, and the Convention on 
Psychotropic Substances of 1971.  The INCB monitors compliance with the drug control treaties 
and proposes appropriate remedial measures and technical assistance to governments that are not 
fully applying the provisions of the treaties or are encountering difficulties in applying them.  
The United States provides funding to the INCB to monitor the measures called for in the 
Conventions, and to improve detection and tracking of chemicals subject to diversion. 
 
In addition to ISSL, the INCB has developed a number of instruments to address the challenges 
of precursor chemicals: 
 
 The Pre-Export Notification Online system (PEN Online) is an online database system that 
enables the exchange of information between member states on the import and export of 
chemicals required for the manufacture of illicit drugs, and to provide the ability to raise 
alerts to stop suspect shipments before they reach illicit drug manufacturers.  The system 
facilitates information sharing on the global level by collecting data on precursor chemical 
trafficking and use trends, and then publicizing this data on online platforms.  In practice, 
electronic responses are sent to exporting countries to acknowledge receipt and to confirm 
clearance to export chemicals.  Since the PEN Online system was first launched in March 
2006, 157 governments have registered to use it.  On average, there are 2,800 PEN pre-
export notifications made monthly via the online system.     
 
 The Precursors Incident Communication System (PICS) is another INCB tool that facilitates 
real-time communication exchange among law enforcement officials worldwide.  
Specifically, the system supports intelligence sharing and facilitates direct coordination and 


INCSR 2018 Volume 1 
 
 
 
 
Chemical Controls 
 
49 
 
collaboration among national authorities to advance investigations on chemical trafficking.  
As of January 2018, there were nearly 2,070 incidents communicated through PICS, an 
increase of more than 300 from the previous year.  Those incidents involved more than 60 
different countries and territories.  Since March 2017, there are 480 registered PICS users, 
241 agencies, and 106 governments.   
 
In addition to Pen Online and PICS, the INCB manages a Task Force to implement Project Prism 
and Project Cohesion — two INCB international initiatives in matters related to chemicals used 
in the illicit manufacture of drugs, specifically synthetic drugs (Project Prism) and heroin and 
cocaine (Project Cohesion).  These ongoing mechanisms facilitate coordination for the 
monitoring of chemical transactions and for coordinating targeted, time-bound intelligence-
gathering operations. 
 
Regional Bodies.  The regulatory framework codified by the United Nations does  
not exist in isolation.  Regional bodies, such as the EU and the Organization of American States 
(OAS), actively work in partnership with the United States on multilateral chemical control 
initiatives, including the implementation of CND resolutions. 
 
Chemical Control Activities and New Trends 
 
Fentanyl.  Fentanyl is a powerful and deadly Schedule II synthetic opioid that is between 50 
and 100 times more potent than morphine.  Within North America, drug traffickers are 
increasingly lacing illicit fentanyl into low-grade heroin to create a more potent high for users.  
Fentanyl is also pressed into pill form and sold as counterfeit prescription opioid pills.  In 
many instances, buyers are not aware of the presence of fentanyl in heroin, alternatively the 
user may have sought out fentanyl-laced heroin for the greater high.   
 
Fentanyl is responsible for a surging number of overdose fatalities in the United States, 
Canada, and some European countries.  Specifically in the United States, fentanyl-related 
overdose deaths in the first half of 2017 jumped 70 percent over the same six-month period in 
2016.  In Canada, fentanyl was responsible for hundreds of  overdose deaths in 2017 and 
prosecutors have brought manslaughter charges against drug traffickers accused of selling 
fentanyl to drug users who died as a result of fentanyl overdoses.  In the United Kingdom, 
British authorities attribute over 60 overdose deaths to fentanyl in 2017.  
 
The two most prevalent precursor chemicals used to produce illicit fentanyl and fentanyl-
related substances (for example, acetyl fentanyl) within the United States are NNPP and 
ANPP.  While there are several chemicals and pathways to manufacture fentanyl, the NPP and 
ANPP processing method is the preferred one currently used by clandestine manufacturers.   
 
On October 18, 2017, these two chemical were added to Table I (internationally controlled 
chemicals) of the 1988 UN Drug Convention, implementing the decision of the 2017 CND.  
With ANPP and NPP, there are now 26 chemicals controlled under Schedule I.  International 
control of these chemicals under the 1988 UN Drug Convention will require states parties to the 
convention to institute domestic regulation of the import and export of ANPP and NPP, which 
will stifle their access for illicit purposes and reduce their availability in the illicit supply chain.

The United States and other UN member states continue to implement preventive measures to 
curb fentanyl’s negative effects on global public health and safety.  This includes the 
implementation of evidence-based prevention programs to reduce the number of new initiates to 
illicit opioid use, and treatment programs to assist those with opioid use disorders in their path to 
long-term recovery.   
 
As part of its larger strategy to curb diversion, production, distribution, and use of illicit fentanyl 
and its analogues, the United States is working to increase law enforcement information sharing; 
enhance medical research on treatment methodologies for cases presenting with fentanyl 
consumption; and advocate with key international partners to curb illicit production, diversion, 
and distribution of fentanyl.  The United States also participated in a global survey sponsored by 
the INCB Precursors Task Force, which leads projects Prism and Cohesion, to identify the 
sources and methods used by traffickers to obtain illicitly manufactured fentanyl, fentanyl 
analogues, other opioid-type new psychoactive substances, and related precursors.   
 
New Psychoactive Substances (NPS).  NPS are defined as “substances of abuse, either in a pure 
form or a preparation, that are not controlled by the 1961 Convention or the 1971 Convention, 
but which may pose a public health threat.  Producers modify and experiment with new chemical 
formulas in search of new NPS that can avoid detection by authorities and skirt the international 
control regime.   
 
The rapid proliferation of NPS is creating a critical challenge for law enforcement officials 
worldwide because of the speed in which they can be reformulated and remarketed to avoid 
international control.  Over 700 formulations of NPS were reported to the United Nations 
through 2017, exceeding the capacity of law enforcement to curb this problem.     
 
The UNODC’s Global Synthetics, Monitoring Analyses, Reporting and Trends (SMART) 
program helps law enforcement and forensic officials to combat the challenges posed by NPS 
through increased information sharing worldwide.  The United States is a staunch supporter of 
the Global SMART program as a critical tool to increase voluntary cooperation among member 
states in sharing information on NPS trafficking and use trends on a global level.  Data collected 
and analyzed by Global SMART is used to inform CND scheduling decisions that affect 
international control of NPS under the UN drug conventions.  This information is made available 
for reference on online portals, and is used to generate reports updating member states on the 
scope of this problem.   
 
Heroin.  The main precursor chemical used to produce heroin is acetic anhydride, a substance 
that is also widely used in legitimate industry.  Drug trafficking organizations continue to 
channel acetic anhydride to illicit producers through diversion, or smuggling.  Acetic anhydride 
may also be used as a compound substance to produce a chemical reaction in the production of 
methamphetamine.     
 
The United States continues to work closely with participant countries of the INCB Precursor 
Task Force of Project Prism and Project Cohesion to counter acetic anhydride diversion.  The 
INCB Precursor Task Force is currently focusing on legitimate domestic trade and end-use of 


INCSR 2018 Volume 1

51 
 
acetic anhydride.  The United States also provides assistance to expand international use of the 
INCB’s PEN Online and the PICS systems to control the diversion of acetic anhydride and other 
chemicals.   
 
For activities under Project Prism and Project Cohesion, participating governments are requested 
to register points of contact (focal points) for their relevant national authorities involved in 
precursor control, such as national regulatory, law enforcement, customs and drug control 
agencies, and to actively use the system to communicate all incidents involving precursor 
chemicals.  As of November 1, 2017, more than 134 countries have nominated points of contacts 
for activities under Project Prism, and 92 countries have nominated points of contacts for 
activities under Project Cohesion.   
 
Since last year, both projects’ points of contact were alerted to major trends in precursor 
trafficking, diversions, attempted diversions, new methods and newly emerging precursors by 
means of special system alerts.  Alerts are issued to the competent authorities of the participating 
countries, including those on the illicit trafficking of acetic anhydride.  
 
Methamphetamine.  Methamphetamine is produced using a variety of methods, but most 
require one or more of the following precursor chemicals; pseudoephedrine; ephedrine; 
pharmaceutical products containing these chemicals; phenyl-2-propanone (P-2-P); and 
phenylacetic acid.  As these precursor chemicals have become more difficult to obtain due to 
increased controls, traffickers have started using other chemicals, or seeking non-controlled pre-
precursor chemicals or esters, and derivatives of phenylacetic acid to produce the precursor 
chemicals necessary for methamphetamine production.  Traffickers, particularly in Europe, 
continue to use the pre-precursor APAAN, or alpha-phenylacetoacetonitrile.  This chemical was 
added to the list of internationally controlled chemicals under the 1988 UN Drug Convention in 
2014.   
 
In response to the international scheduling of APAAN, in 2017 the World Customs Organization 
introduced a new international identification code number for APAAN, to allow easier 
identification of international shipments in this chemical by authorities.  As of August 17, 2017, 
the Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) designated APAAN and its salts, optical isomers, 
and salts of optical isomers as controlled chemicals under the U.S. Controlled Substances Act 
(CSA).  This action allows U.S. authorities to regulate all transactions involving APAAN, 
regardless of size.  Any chemical mixtures containing APAAN would not be exempt from 
regulatory requirements at any concentration under this proposed action.   
 
Methamphetamine production takes place domestically and worldwide.  Domestic small 
production capacity laboratories (SPCLs) are the most frequently encountered type of 
clandestine laboratory.  SPCLs tend to be low production operations (grams or ounces), and 
produce only a small percentage of the drug that is consumed in the United States.  The 
emergence of the “one-pot labs” (a.k.a. “shake-n-bake” labs) constitute the majority of SPCLs 
found domestically.  These laboratories typically use two-liter plastic soda bottles, 16 – 20 ounce 
drink containers, and other such receptacles.   
 


INCSR 2018 Volume 1 
 
 
 
 
Chemical Controls 
 
52 
 
The SPCLs utilize chemicals that are easily obtained.  Pseudoephedrine and ephedrine are the 
principal precursor chemicals used in SPCLs, and are frequently purchased over the counter from 
retail pharmacies and convenience stores.  There are indications that methamphetamine 
trafficking across the U.S. southern border continued to increase in 2017.  As with other 
synthetic drugs, traffickers substitute chemicals for production based on availability and price.  
Most large-scale manufacturers in Mexico now use a production process known as the P-2-P 
method (from the precursor chemical phenyl-2-propanone).  This alternative process does not 
require extracting pseudoephedrine to produce the chemical base of the drug, allowing drug 
traffickers to circumvent controls.   
 
The use of the nitrostyrene method to produce P-2-P, which starts from benzaldehyde and 
nitroethane, or from the intermediary product 1-phenyl-2-nitropropene, has also been an alternate 
method used by Mexican drug trafficking organizations in recent years to manufacture the 
precursor chemicals required to produce methamphetamine.   
 
In 2016, ephedrine-based and pseudoephedrine-based methods were not detected in any of the 
selected samples analyzed by DEA.  Instead, key chemicals used in the illicit manufacture of P-
2-P using the so-called “nitrostyrene method” increased from 51 percent during the first six 
months of 2016 to 71 percent over the same period in 2017. 
 
Countries in Africa and Asia, where precursors like P-2-P and APAAN are relatively unknown, 
continue to rely on ephedrine and pseudoephedrine to produce top quality methamphetamine.  
There are indications, however, that Mexican alternate methods to produce methamphetamine 
are growing in Africa.  In March 2016, Nigerian authorities dismantled an industrial-scale illicit 
methamphetamine laboratory, where traffickers used the nitrostyrene method to produce the 
drug.  Most of the chemicals seized during the law enforcement operation were not yet controlled 
in Nigeria and were purchased in-country from legitimate sources.   
 
In Europe, there are limited legitimate uses for APAAN and imports are frequently converted to 
benzyl methyl ketone (BMK), an amphetamine precursor.  According to the INCB, three 
European countries reported seizing APAAN between 2016 and 2017.  Together, the amounts 
seized totaled less than 600 kilogram (kg), which was less than half the amount seized in 2015.     
 
Cocaine.  Potassium permanganate, an oxidizer, is the primary chemical used to remove the 
impurities from cocaine base.  It has many legitimate industrial uses, including waste-water 
treatment, and as a disinfectant and deodorizer.  Potassium permanganate can also be combined 
with pseudoephedrine to produce methcathinone, a synthetic psychoactive stimulant controlled 
under the 1971 UN Convention.  
 
In South America, the only region of the world where large quantities of coca leaf is cultivated, 
traffickers continue to divert chemicals from legitimate industry, either from domestic or 
international sources, for cocaine production.  A growing trend cited by law enforcement 
officials is the recycling of chemicals, which allows clandestine laboratory operators to reuse 
chemicals up to four times before they need to be replaced.  Alternative precursor chemicals used 
in cocaine manufacturing have also been detected.  Additionally, traffickers continue to recycle 
the chemical containers, making it difficult to trace the origin of the chemicals inside.  The

INCB’s Project Cohesion monitors the imports of potassium permanganate to cocaine processing 
areas.  The United States, the INCB, and other international partners encourage countries in 
South America to continue sharing information on these new trends. 
 
Trends.  Illicit drug producers continue to adapt to new methods.  In the past, diversion of 
international shipments accounted for a greater proportion of precursor chemicals used to 
produce illicit drugs than it does now.  Increasingly, precursor chemicals are produced outside of 
domestic controls, and subsequently mislabeled for shipment or smuggled abroad.  Domestic 
chemical diversion is the biggest challenge in countries where controlled substances are already 
produced.  It is critical to continue efforts to strengthen the capacity of law enforcement and 
public health institutions to minimize illicit precursor chemical diversion.   
 
Increasingly, drug traffickers are using chemicals that are not controlled under the Convention or 
the domestic laws of the source, export, or importing countries.  Traffickers exploit countries that 
have limited enforcement and regulatory capacity, and frequently obtain chemicals produced 
within countries where illicit drugs are produced, thereby escaping international monitoring, 
surveillance, and interdiction efforts.  
 
Another emerging concern is the use of toxic adulterants to manipulate illicit drug composition 
with distinct pharmacological products.  Drug traffickers have traditionally mixed non-toxic 
materials such as lactose and glucose into drug supplies to increase profitability, but there is 
growing evidence that traffickers are increasingly mixing banned or controlled toxic substances 
including pharmaceutical drugs and fungicides into illicit drugs to increase drug potency and 
produce enhanced psychoactive effects.  These adulterants can compound the health risks related 
to illicit drug use and impede effective treatment and recovery efforts. 
 
An early warning system to identify adulterants and to report adverse effects from their 
consumption would enhance understanding of, and public health response to, illicit drug 
adulteration.  As such, it is vital that law enforcement authorities continue to test drug samples 
for toxic adulterants, alerting public health authorities of additional negative effects toxic 
adulterants can cause to the body, including death.    
 
In response to multiple reports indicating the gravity of the toxic new form of drug preparation 
involving the cutting/adulteration of drugs with banned pharmaceuticals, veterinary products, 
and other toxic substances, the U.S. government in partnership with the Colombo Plan initiated a 
global toxic adulterant project to address this emerging public health problem.  The details of the 
“joint project” can be reviewed at the 2017 Field Guide to Drug Demand Reduction Program 
Development (Second Edition) published at http://www.colombo-
plan.org/content/media/2017/06/INL-Fleld-Guide-II-Final-low.pdf (pages 221-232).  An 
appendix addressing primary adulterants of concern and their health-related effects is also 
available by clicking on the same link. 
 
The internet continues to facilitate illicit sales, of chemical compounds containing controlled 
substances, as well as the sale of NPS, fentanyl, fentanyl-related substances, and toxic 
adulterants with shipments made through international mail systems.

The Road Ahead 
 
To counter illicit production, diversion, and trafficking of chemicals for illicit purposes, the 
United States is committed to expanding its work with international partners; implementing the 
provisions of the 1988 UN Drug Convention; monitoring those substances listed on the ISSL; 
and identifying and stopping diversion and/or smuggling of new substitute chemicals that can be 
used for illicit drug production, including adulterants.   
 
The development and reliable implementation of effective chemical control regimes and 
legislation is critical.  Additionally, it is important to develop and utilize the administrative, 
investigative, and prosecutorial tools to successfully identify suspicious transactions and bring 
chemical traffickers to justice, as well as to make better use of watch lists and voluntary control 
mechanisms to target listed chemicals and substitute chemicals as well as to identify the latest 
production and trafficking methods. 
 
In the case of adulterants, the United States supports and provides law enforcement authorities 
training and equipment to test drug samples for toxic adulterants.  It also promotes campaigns to 
alert public health authorities of additional negative effects and harm that toxic adulterants can 
cause to the body.     
 
Increased cooperation with domestic industry, including chemical and shipping companies, as 
well as the pharmaceutical industry, and other public-private partnerships is critical to targeting 
precursor chemicals and toxic adulterants.  Published international guidelines and identified best 
practices have much to offer in encouraging such cooperation, particularly the INCB Voluntary 
Code of Conduct for Industry.  The United States will continue to work with other countries to 
encourage the application of domestic control measures similar to those applied to international 
trade in these chemicals.  
 
Against this backdrop, the United States will continue to promote efforts through the INCB and 
engage other member states through the CND and other multilateral venues.  In the Western 
Hemisphere, for example, the Inter-American Drug Abuse Control Commission (CICAD) 
advances voluntary cooperation on precursor chemical controls.  CICAD’s Group of Experts on 
Chemical Control and Pharmaceutical Substances carries out a variety of initiatives in this 
important field.  Of note, this expert group explores options for soliciting private sector input 
from the Western Hemisphere into the discussion on controlling substances that are legal but 
used to make illegal drugs.   
 
Moreover, the United States is supporting partner nation efforts in various regions of the world to 
develop and strengthen precursor laws and regulations to ensure compliance with international 
drug control conventions.  These include further steps to enhance and foster communication 
among national authorities, promote increased communication and follow-up on exports and 
imports of controlled chemicals through the INCB task forces, and expand diplomatic 
engagement on precursor initiatives bilaterally, and through multilateral and regional institutions.  
The United States also provides training to international entities to improve the monitoring and 
control of chemical sales through the internet.

Major Chemical Source Countries and Territories 
 
This section focuses on individual countries with large chemical manufacturing industries that 
have significant trade with drug-producing regions and those with significant chemical 
commerce susceptible to diversion domestically for smuggling into drug-producing countries.  
Designation as a major chemical source country does not indicate a lack of adequate chemical 
control legislation or the ability to enforce it.  Rather, it recognizes that the volume of chemical 
trade with drug-producing regions, or proximity to them, makes these countries the sources of 
the greatest quantities of chemicals liable to diversion.  The United States, with its large 
chemical industry and extensive trade with drug-producing regions, is included on the list.   
 
Many other countries manufacture and trade in chemicals, but not on the same scale, or with the 
broad range of precursor chemicals, as the countries in this section.  These two sections are 
broken down by region.   
 
Africa   
 
Nigeria   
 
Nigeria is an emerging major producing country for methamphetamine.  It is developing into a 
major transshipment country for ephedrine, a precursor chemical used in the production of 
methamphetamine.  Precursor chemicals, mainly ephedrine, are imported from India and China 
then diverted to the laboratory operators.  One kilogram of 99 percent pure locally-produced 
methamphetamine sells for as little as $7,500 in Lagos and over $150,000 in Southeast Asian 
countries such as Malaysia.  Nigeria was also the largest importer of tramadol from India, a 
pharmaceutical drug increasingly abused in Nigeria.   
 
In June 2017, the UNODC finalized a scientific study on the estimated needs of controlled 
medicines, psychotropic substances and precursor chemicals for medicinal and scientific 
purposes in Nigeria.  The study revealed that the estimated need for ephedrine was 771 kg, and 
the estimated need for pseudoephedrine was 5.5 MT.   The data revealed that Nigeria’s drug 
imports far exceeded the amount legitimately needed in Nigeria.  The National Drug Law 
Enforcement Agency (NDLEA) reported that in 2017, Nigeria imported 8.3 MT of ephedrine, 
4.82 MT of pseudoephedrine and 1,352 MT of acetone.   In 2017, the NDLEA seized 117.9 kg of 
precursor chemicals attempted to be illegally exported from the country.  In June 2017, the 
NDLEA seized 128.8 kg of ketamine. 
 
South Africa 
 
South Africa is a leading regional importer of chemicals used in the production of illegal drugs, 
particularly synthetic drugs.  South Africa enforces the scheduling of precursor chemicals.  With 
heroin and cocaine primarily imported in finished form, the chemicals used in their production 
are not as commonly found as those used to manufacture methamphetamine and methaqualone. 
 
The South African Police Service (SAPS) has a trained, dedicated clandestine laboratory team.  
The SAPS division of the Directorate for Priority Crime Investigation (DPCI) estimates 40-50 


INCSR 2018 Volume 1

clandestine laboratories are dismantled annually.  The South African Revenue Service (SARS) 
published the trade of chemical products as a broad category in the trade statistics report.  SARS 
Customs and Enforcement teams also seize illicit drugs and substances scheduled as precursors.  
Chemicals confiscated include ethanol and toluene. 
 
Ephedrine and pseudoephedrine used in South Africa to produce methamphetamine largely 
originate in Nigeria and India.  Human couriers from the United Arab Emirates have also been 
arrested for attempting to traffic these chemicals through O.R. Tambo International Airport.  
Although it is a challenge to gather trade information to assess illicit use and trade of precursors, 
South Africa, as a party to the 1988 UN Drug Convention, regularly reports to the INCB on 
substances frequently used in the illicit manufacture of narcotic drugs and psychotropic 
substances.   
 
South Africa is also registered with the INCB’s PICS.  Regulating the licit market for precursors 
is the responsibility of the South Africa National Drug Policy (NDP), which mandates the 
establishment of computerized inventory control systems for scheduled chemicals and regular 
regulation and monitoring of the purchase of medicines containing precursors via a registry 
system.  Such measures have not been fully implemented. 
 
The nexus between wildlife trafficking and trade for precursors and illicit drugs is being 
investigated by South Africa.  The United States has sponsored research in this field and awaits 
the final report.  U.S. agencies coordinate with South African authorities.  Container shipments 
which the United States identifies as containing possible illicit materials, to include precursors, 
are investigated by South Africa and acted on.  U.S. law enforcement collaborations with South 
Africa in investigations are purposeful, yet regular and enhanced interactions would prove 
useful.  
 
North America   
 
Canada   
 
Canada’s “Controlled Drugs and Substances Act” (CDSA) and its implementing regulations 
provide a legislative framework for the control of chemical precursors.  Scheduling of substances 
under the CDSA and its regulations provides law enforcement agencies with the authority to take 
action against activities that are not in accordance with the law.  These instruments also authorize 
Health Canada to communicate information collected to law enforcement agencies, border 
control officers, foreign competent authorities and the INCB if necessary. 
 
Health Canada submits an annual report to the INCB with respect to its obligations under the 
1988 UN Drug Convention.  The annual report provides information on licit imports and exports 
for the previous year, as well as stopped shipments and seizures, and refusals of permit 
applications due to objections from foreign authorities, information received from the INCB, and 
incomplete or invalid application information.  Canada cooperates fully with the INCB in cases 
where shipments may pose a concern.

To address the problem of chemical diversion, the Royal Canadian Mounted Police (RCMP) 
instituted the National Chemical Precursor Diversion Program in 2001.  Program coordinators 
liaise with Health Canada and the chemical industry, assist investigators who are conducting 
clandestine laboratory investigations, and provide training to the chemical industry in the 
identification, monitoring, and prevention of suspicious transactions.   
 
Mexico   
 
Mexico has several major chemical manufacturing and trade industries that produce, import, or 
export most of the chemicals required for illicit drug production, including potassium 
permanganate and acetic anhydride.  Although Mexico-based transnational criminal 
organizations (TCOs) are major producers of methamphetamine, pseudoephedrine and ephedrine 
are not produced legally within the country.   
 
In 2008, Mexico outlawed imports of pseudoephedrine and ephedrine, except for hospital use of 
liquid pseudoephedrine.  Mexico has enhanced regulatory laws on the importation of precursor 
chemicals, including regulations for imports of phenylacetic acid (including its salts, esters, and 
derivatives), methylamine, hydriodic acid, and red phosphorous.  Imports of essential chemicals 
are limited by law to 17 of 49 Mexican ports of entry limits imports of essential chemicals.  Of 
these 17 chemicals, imports of legal precursor chemicals are permitted at six ports of entry, 
including two new ports of entry legalized in 2017 (Coatzacoalcos Veracruz and Anahuac Nuevo 
Leon). 
 
Ammonium chloride and formaldehyde/paraformaldehyde are precursor chemicals used in 
Mexico to manufacture methylamine.  Ammonium chloride is also used to manufacture heroin, 
used during the extraction of morphine.  Methamphetamine production, importations of 
legitimate precursor chemicals for diversion, and illegitimate mislabeled precursor chemicals 
continue to pose challenges.   
 
Mexico controls all chemicals listed in the 1988 UN Drug Convention.  Mexican laws regulate 
the production and use of many of these substances and the Mexican Office of the Attorney 
General is responsible for enforcing chemical control laws.  Mexico’s regulatory agency is the 
Sanitary Risk Protection Federal Commission (COFEPRIS).  The United States is currently 
working with COFEPRIS to aid in the control of all ketamine products.  COFEPRIS controls 
ketamine for human use but not veterinary ketamine products, which are smuggled into the 
United States.  Mexican ketamine seized in the United States is usually in vials and mostly used 
to achieve a recreational high.  Most of the domestic diversion is from veterinarian clinics or 
obtained via the internet.  
 
NPP and 4-ANPP are the most widely used precursor chemicals for illicit production of fentanyl.  
In July 2017, Mexico’s General Health Council (“Consejo de Salubridad General”) officially 
added ANPP and NPP to its list of controlled substances.  The international control of both NPP 
and ANPP is necessary to prevent the illicit production of fentanyl and related fentanyl-like 
substances.  As a result, on December 4, using Department of State INL-donated canines trained 
in Fentanyl detection, Mexican authorities seized a shipment containing three plastic bags with 
1.5 kg of 4-ANPP.

Mexico participates in international efforts to control precursors and has a strong bilateral 
working relationship with the United States.  In 2012, Mexico signed a memorandum of 
cooperation with the United States to address precursor chemicals and clandestine laboratories.  
The two governments also cooperate to share best practices with Central American countries 
affected by the trafficking of precursor chemicals.   
 
The United States   
 
The United States manufactures and/or trades in almost all 26 chemicals listed in Tables I and II 
of the 1988 UN Drug Convention to which it is a party; and it has laws and regulations 
implementing chemical control provisions.   
 
The foundation of U.S. chemical control is the Chemical Diversion and Trafficking Act of 1988.  
This law and subsequent chemical control provisions of the U.S. drug law are interwoven into 
the Controlled Substances Act of 1970, rather than individual stand-alone legislation.  DEA is 
responsible for administering and enforcing these laws.   
 
The Department of Justice, primarily through its U.S. Attorneys, handles criminal and civil 
prosecutions at the federal level.  In addition to registration and recordkeeping requirements, the 
legislation requires importers and exporters to file import or export notifications at least 15 days 
before the transaction is to take place.  The 15-day advanced notification permits DEA to 
evaluate the transaction.  However, the legislation and regulations allow for a waiver of the 15-
day advance notification if a company has an established business relationship for a specified 
listed chemical or chemicals with its foreign customer that has been reported to DEA subject to 
the criteria in the Code of Federal Regulations.  In these cases, same-day notification is permitted 
for future shipments.  Diversion investigators and special agents communicate with exporting 
and importing government officials in this process.  The legislation also gives DEA the authority 
to suspend shipments.   
 
U.S. legislation requires chemical handlers to report to DEA suspicious transactions such as 
those involving extraordinary quantities or unusual methods of payment.  Criminal penalties for 
chemical diversion are strict; the penalties for some chemical trafficking offenses involving 
methamphetamine are tied to the quantities of drugs that could have been produced with the 
diverted chemicals.  If the diversion of listed chemicals is detected, persons or companies may be 
prosecuted or DEA registration may be revoked.   
 
The Combat Methamphetamine Epidemic Act of 2005 (CMEA) mandated DEA to establish total 
annual requirements, import quotas, individual manufacturing quotas, and procurement quotas 
for three List 1 chemicals:  pseudoephedrine, ephedrine, and phenylpropanolamine.  This 
affected those DEA-registered importers and manufacturers that wish to import or conduct 
manufacturing activities with these chemicals.  The CMEA also restricted retail level 
transactions of nonprescription drug products that contain ephedrine, pseudoephedrine, or 
phenylpropanolamine, now known as “scheduled listed chemical products.”  The CMEA and 
other chemical control legislation are aimed at preventing the illicit manufacture of illegal drugs 
domestically and internationally.

The United States has played a leading role in the design, promotion, and implementation of 
cooperative multilateral chemical control initiatives.  The United States also actively works with 
other concerned nations, and with the UNODC and the INCB to develop information sharing 
procedures to better control precursor chemicals and non-controlled substances used in the illicit 
production of drugs. U.S. officials are members of a combined task force for both Project 
Cohesion and Project Prism.  The United States has established close operational cooperation 
with counterparts in major chemical manufacturing and trading countries.  This cooperation 
includes information sharing in support of chemical control programs and to prevent chemical 
diversion. 
 
Central America and the Caribbean   
 
Costa Rica 
 
Costa Rica has a stringent licensing process for the importation and distribution of precursor 
chemicals.  Costa Rica has controls for Table I and Table II precursor and essential chemicals as 
defined by the 1988 UN Drug Convention. 
 
Costa Rica’s National Plan on Drugs for 2013-2017 recognizes the international problem of 
production and trafficking of chemical precursors.  Costa Rica has yet to seize large amounts of 
the substances compared to elsewhere in the region and has a low volume of licit chemical 
imports.  The Costa Rican Drug Institute has a special unit dedicated to the control and 
regulation of precursor chemicals, and this unit has broad powers to monitor and respond to 
illegal activity.  By law, importers and businesses that handle chemical precursors or certain 
types of prescription drugs are required to submit monthly reports through an online tracking 
system.  
 
During the first 10 months of 2017, there were 2,377 authorized import transactions, licensed to 
196 registered importers of chemical precursors.  The system tracks the movement of chemical 
precursors and solvents and also generates alerts to notify authorities of suspicious 
transactions.  Costa Rican authorities received no specific alerts during the first 10 months of 
2017 for situations arising in Costa Rica.  
 
Dominican Republic   
 
The Dominican Republic maintains a chemical control regime in accordance with Article 12 of 
the 1988 UN Drug Convention.  Dominican laws regulate the production and use of the 
chemicals listed in the Convention and the Dominican Republic annually submits information 
required by the treaty.  The National Directorate for Drug Control (DNCD) is responsible for 
enforcing chemical control laws. 
 
The Dominican Republic does not have a large petrochemical industry engaged in the 
manufacturing, importation, and exportation of chemical products.  Chemicals for industrial 
production are imported from the United States.  The two largest chemical imports are sodium 
carbonate and toluene, which are used in the Dominican Republic as an additive for gasoline and 


INCSR 2018 Volume 1 
 
 
 
 
Chemical Controls 
 
60 
 
as a solvent for paint.  Production of methamphetamines is not significant in the Dominican 
Republic.  
 
The DNCD regulates and enforces the importation and use of precursor chemicals.  The 
Directorate receives pre-notifications for precursor imports and issues certificates of importation.  
The DNCD also controls and regulates prescription drugs and issues annual permits to medical 
doctors, clinics, and hospitals, maintaining a register of the type of drug and amount each doctor 
prescribes each year, especially for drugs containing opiates.  Clinics and hospitals are mandated 
to report prescriptions for certain drugs before dispensing them and the DNCD verifies that the 
prescription number and the doctor are valid before authorizing the sale.  The DNCD is taking 
steps to automate its paper-based chemical control registration. 
  
El Salvador   
 
El Salvador is party to the 1988 UN Drug Convention, and invokes its rights to pre-notification 
of scheduled precursor chemicals under Article 12.  Precursor chemical trafficking remains a 
regional threat, as methamphetamine production continues to spread from Mexico into 
neighboring Guatemala.  Prior to 2016, Salvadoran authorities seized significant amounts of 
precursor chemicals imported from China at the Acajutla seaport, but seizure incidents have not 
been reported since then.  
 
The OAS, with U.S. funding, is working with Central American countries to destroy existing 
stockpiles of seized precursor chemicals.  The OAS signed a cooperative agreement with the 
Government of El Salvador in 2015 to provide technical assistance in the management and 
disposal of controlled chemical substances.  This agreement has not yet been implemented due to 
the curtailment of seizures since 2015.   
 
Guatemala   
 
The Guatemalan government has been storing large quantities of seized precursor chemicals 
since 2005.  As of October 2017, there were approximately 3,050 MT of seized precursor 
chemicals stored within Guatemala.  Authorities store the majority of these seized precursors in 
196 containers at seaports.  In July 2017, the United States donated an incinerator that is capable 
of destroying this backlog within an estimated three years when functioning at full capacity.  The 
United States also provided training on its use to Guatemalan authorities.  U.S. officials continue 
to work with counterparts to develop standard operating procedures for the process of destruction 
to maximize efficiency.  No precursor chemicals were seized or destroyed in 2017.   
 
Honduras   
 
Precursor chemical diversion continues to be a problem in Honduras.  The Government of 
Honduras works closely with U.S. authorities to disrupt the importation and diversion 
of precursor chemicals through Honduras.  The United States also provides training and other 
assistance to help strengthen the capacity of Honduran institutions responsible for controlling 
precursor chemicals, including the Directorate of Investigation and Intelligence (DNII); the 


INCSR 2018 Volume 1 
 
 
 
 
Chemical Controls 
 
61 
 
Directorate for the Fight against Drug Trafficking (DLCN); the Public Ministry; the HNP; and 
the Health Ministry. 
 
The focal point of the Honduran government’s control efforts is increasingly the Precursor 
Chemical Commission, directed by DNII.  Composed of officers from the Honduran National 
Police, the Health Ministry, the Public Ministry, and the Inter-institutional Security Force 
(FUSINA), the commission has been historically under resourced and lacks expertise in working 
with counterparts across the government to conduct precursor chemical criminal investigations, 
and must work within a fragmented and inadequate regulatory structure.  In 2017, the United 
States assisted the commission in identifying intelligence gaps, suspicious shipments, and 
inspection of companies who import chemicals into Honduras.    
 
South America   
 
Argentina 
 
Argentina’s geographic proximity to major cocaine producing nations and its role as one of the 
largest producers of chemical precursors in South America make the country particularly 
vulnerable to precursor chemical diversion.  Argentina has several legislative measures in place 
to curb the illicit use of chemical precursors.  The National Register of Chemical Precursors, a 
division of the Security Ministry, was created in 2005 and strengthened in 2016 with the creation 
of the Federal Council for Chemical Precursors, which is responsible for analysis and 
investigations of crimes associated with chemical precursors.  The Federal Council tracks the 
issue regionally and drafts policies and procedures to combat chemical diversion.   
 
Argentine law enforcement has traditionally focused on chemical precursors used in the 
production of cocaine, but the government has shifted its attention towards those used in the 
production of methamphetamine.  In March 2017, Argentina hosted the first Symposium on 
Counter Narcotics and Chemical Precursors in the city of Parana, during which the Minister of 
Security pledged greater coordination with provincial and local police forces against the 
unlawful use of chemical precursors. 
 
Brazil  
 
Brazil is one of the world’s 10 largest chemical producing countries by volume.  Brazil licenses, 
controls, and inspects essential and precursor chemical products, including potassium 
permanganate and acetic anhydride, in conformity with its obligations under the 1988 UN Drug 
Control Convention.  Controls on both potassium permanganate and acetic anhydride allow for 
product to be commercialized without restriction for quantities of up to one kg for potassium 
permanganate and one liter of acetic anhydride. 
 
The Brazilian Federal Police (DPF) Chemical Division controls and monitors 146 chemical 
products in conjunction with 27 DPF regional divisions and 97 resident offices.  The Chemical 
Division is composed of two units: the Chemical Control Division, subordinate to the DPF 
Executive Directorate, and the Criminal Diversion Investigations unit under the Organized Crime 


INCSR 2018 Volume 1 
 
 
 
 
Chemical Controls 
 
62 
 
Division.  Both divisions routinely coordinate and share information when conducting 
administrative inspections and criminal investigations. 
   
Regulatory guidelines require chemical handlers to be registered and licensed to conduct 
activities such as manufacturing, importing, exporting, storing, transporting, commercializing 
and distributing chemicals.  The DPF uses a National Computerized System of Chemical Control 
to monitor all chemical movements in the country, including imports/exports, and 
licensing.  This system requires all companies to register with an online system and to report all 
activity conducted, including the submission of monthly reports for all chemical related 
movements and existing chemical inventories. 
  
Brazil reports to the INCB its annual estimates of legitimate requirements for ephedrine and 
pseudoephedrine for quantities above 10 grams, and P-2-P in any amount using the INCB’s PEN 
Online.  The DPF routinely uses PEN Online in cases of international trade and in coordination 
with UN member states to alert importing countries with details of an export transaction.  
 
Chile  
 
Chile complies with its international obligations to the 1988 UN Drug Convention and furnishes 
chemical transshipment reports through the INCB’s PEN Online.  Chile has a large 
petrochemical industry engaged in the manufacturing, import, and export of chemical products.  
Most of the chemical substances seized by law enforcement are those used for the processing of 
cocaine products, such as sulfuric acid, hydrochloric acid, acetone and sodium hydroxide.  Since 
2009, there have been no seizures of ephedrine and pseudoephedrine, used as precursors for 
synthetic drugs.  The largest imports of controlled chemical substances and related products 
come from Germany and the United States, while Paraguay and Bolivia are the primary export 
destinations. 
 
The regulatory entity for chemical controls is the Department of Controlled Chemical Substances 
(DSQC), a sub secretariat of the Ministry of Interior.  The DSQC manages the System of 
Registration and Administration of Controlled Chemical Substances (SIREGAD-SQC), which 
collects information on the production, manufacture, preparation, importation, and exportation of 
chemical substances that could be used in the production of illicit drugs.   
 
Companies that import, export, or manufacture chemical precursors must register with 
SIREGAD-SQC, maintain customer records, and are subject to regular inspections.  The new 
online SIREGAD-SQC has improved capabilities for real-time data, and can analyze controlled 
chemical trends in Chile.  At the end of 2017, 532 companies were registered in the system.  In 
2016, 15 new chemical substances were added to the country’s control list, among them 
adulterants, bulking drugs derived from cocaine, and substances used for the manufacture of 
synthetic drugs.   
 
Chilean law enforcement entities have specialized chemical diversion units and dedicated 
personnel assigned responsibility for investigating chemical and pharmaceutical diversion cases.  
Customs, which is not a traditional law enforcement agency, has a risk analysis unit which 
profiles suspicious imports and exports, which may include chemical precursors. 


INCSR 2018 Volume 1

63 
 
 
During 2016, the Ministry of Interior conducted training sessions for law enforcement and 
security personnel to highlight the role of chemical precursor agents in the illegal manufacture of 
psychoactive drugs.  From 2015 to 2017, the DSQC conducted 533 inspections and audits, which 
resulted in the imposition of sanctions against 93 companies for failure to comply with the 
registration and declaration requirements for Chilean precursor chemicals. 
 
Ecuador   
 
Under Ecuadorian law, potassium permanganate and acetic anhydride are designated as 
controlled chemicals.  Buying, selling, or importing such chemicals requires the permission of 
the Technical Secretariat for Drugs, the primary agency responsible for precursor chemical 
control in Ecuador.  According to Article 219 in the 2014 Criminal Code, the use of precursor 
chemicals to produce, manufacture, or prepare illicit materials, such as cocaine or heroin is 
punishable by three to five years in prison.  
 
The chemical unit of the National Antinarcotics Directorate (DNA), under the Ecuadorian 
National Police, plays an active role in chemical control by carrying out investigations and 
intelligence operations.  Although DNA’s chemical unit is a highly competent entity, its small 
size and outdated technology hinder operations.  The unit employs only 25 people, 13 in Quito 
and 12 in Guayaquil, and conducts limited operations in Esmeraldas and Loja, where drug labs 
and trafficking are most pronounced, due to the porous land borders with Colombia and Peru.  
Because of its small workforce, the chemical unit must often rely on ad hoc support from police 
officers from other units who generally lack adequate chemical training.  
 
Ecuador has been importing large quantities of potassium permanganate for at least the past 
decade.  According to the Central Bank of Ecuador, in 2016 Ecuador imported 61.93 MT of 
potassium permanganate, compared to 34.79 MT in 2015.  Potassium permanganate is a 
controlled chemical and requires an import license in order to be imported into the country.  
Most 2016 imports originated from China.  Due to the high cost of potassium permanganate, 
substitute bootleg production of potassium permanganate has begun.  Similar to potassium 
permanganate, acetic anhydride is also a controlled chemical requiring an import license.  In 
2016, Ecuador imported 130 MT of acetic anhydride, compared to 85.6 MT imported in 2015.  
Ecuadorian authorities have not been able to explain this significant increase.  Most 2016 
imports originated from India and the United States.  
 
Venezuela 
 
In 2017, the Government of Venezuela shared very little information with U.S. authorities 
concerning its laws, administrative controls, and enforcement efforts in place to prevent 
precursor chemical diversion.  The United States lacks sufficient information to evaluate whether 
the Government of Venezuela’s diversion control efforts were sufficient to uphold the country’s 
international obligations under the 1988 UN Drug Convention to prevent precursor chemical 
diversion.

Asia   
 
Bangladesh   
 
Drug traffickers continue to divert precursor chemicals and chemical preparations (including 
ephedrine, pseudoephedrine, toluene, and acetone) from Bangladeshi pharmaceutical or chemical 
companies to illicit drug production.  Bangladesh has successfully engaged bilaterally with India 
to control the diversion of phensedyl (a codeine-based cough syrup), and Bangladeshi law 
enforcement agencies work closely with the DEA to seize and disrupt illicit drugs and chemicals. 
  
The Government of Bangladesh is committed to the implementation of the 1988 UN Drug 
Convention and regional agreements regarding control of narcotic drugs, psychotropic 
substances and precursor chemicals.  Twenty-three of the 26 precursor chemicals listed in the 
1988 UN Drug Convention are included in the “Schedule of Drugs” of Bangladesh’s Narcotics 
Control Act (NCA) to comply with the provisions of Article 12 of the 1988 UN Drug 
Convention.  
 
The NCA also allows financial investigations and freezing of assets derived from trafficking in 
drugs and precursors.  The Indian government provides the INCB with annual estimates of 
Bangladesh’s legitimate use requirements for imports of the four precursors frequently used in 
the manufacture of amphetamine-type stimulants ATS-3, 4-MDP-2-P, pseudoephedrine, 
ephedrine, and P-2-P under CND Resolution 49/3. 
  
The Directorate General of Drug Administration has developed a draft national drug policy, 
approved by the Cabinet in December 2016, in response to the threat posed by the abuse of, and 
trafficking in, pharmaceutical preparations and other drugs.  The “National Drug Policy 2016” 
replaced the Drug Policy 2005 and aims to ensure that the manufacturing of medicines complies 
with international standards to increase export of pharmaceutical items.  The new policy also 
proposes forming a National Drug Regulatory Authority to stop the adulteration of medicines 
and raw materials.  Responsible authorities will also have to update the price of drugs every year 
and publish the updated prices online.   
  
Bangladesh has a nascent but growing commercial pharmaceutical industry.  Besides meeting 97 
percent of the local demand, many pharmaceutical companies are exporting medicines to over 
122 countries.  In 2016, a Bangladeshi company became the first to receive the U.S. Federal 
Drug Administration (FDA) approval to export a prescription drug for hypertension to the United 
States.  The FDA subsequently approved additional drugs for export to the United States, and 
other top listed pharmaceutical companies are now seeking FDA approval to enter the U.S. 
market.  
  
Bangladeshi pharmaceutical companies focus primarily on branded generic final formulations, 
mostly using imported Active Pharmaceutical Ingredients (APIs).  About 85 percent of the drugs 
sold in Bangladesh are generic and 15 percent are patented drugs.  Bangladesh manufactures 
more than 450 generic drugs, sold under 5,300 registered brands that have 8,300 different 
dosages and strengths.  As such, Bangladesh’s chemical imports are primarily in these 
pharmaceutical categories.  Bangladesh’s domestic pharmaceutical companies account for more 


INCSR 2018 Volume 1 
 
 
 
 
Chemical Controls 
 
65 
 
than 65 percent of the pharmaceutical business in Bangladesh; this domestic market share is 
distributed among a large number of companies, including some multi-nationals.  
  
The Department of Narcotics Control (DNC) issues licenses for the import, export, transport, 
shipment, manufacture, sale, distribution, purchase, possession, storage, or other use of 
controlled precursors.  The NCA implementing rules regulate the control, monitoring, and use of 
precursors for industrial, scientific and medical purposes through a licensing system.  The DNC, 
however, lacks sufficient staff and equipment to detect and interdict precursors 
consistently.  Bangladesh has also established District Drug Control Committees (DDCC) to 
monitor and coordinate the activities among the agencies responsible for drug and precursor 
chemical enforcement.   
 
The Police, Customs, Rapid Action Battalion, Border Guard, and Coast Guard are empowered to 
detect and intercept illegal precursor chemical and drug operations.  The counterdrug unit of the 
Dhaka Metro Police has successfully assisted DEA in conducting investigations targeting Dhaka-
based traffickers of pseudoephedrine chemical preparations.  Despite government efforts, 
Bangladesh continues to struggle to allocate sufficient resources to control precursors through 
consistent enforcement of existing laws.  
 
China   
 
China remains one of the world's top producers and exporters of precursor chemicals.  The 
majority of licit precursor chemical production and export is intended for legitimate use; 
however, precursors are not only being diverted by TCOs but also manufactured in large, 
sophisticated, illegal factories within China.  In addition, China's close proximity to the illicit 
drug production countries in Southeast and Southwest Asia, challenging regulatory oversight of 
the large precursor chemical industry, and unethical practices among some government officials 
and businesses, make it an ideal source for precursor chemicals illicitly diverted for drug 
production. 
 
On December 28, China’s Ministry of Public Security (MPS) announced that effective February 
1, 2018, China will control five additional precursor chemicals.  Two of them are N-Phenethyl-4-
Piperidone (NPP) and 4-Anilino-N-Phenethylpiperidine (ANPP), which are used to clandestinely 
manufacture fentanyl and have been under international controls since March 2017.  The other 
three chemicals are N-Methyl-1-Phenyl-1-Chloro-2-Propanamine, Bromine, and 1-phenyl-1-
acetone, which are used in clandestine methamphetamine production. 
   
India  
  
India’s large and growing pharmaceutical and chemical manufacturing industry serves its own 
large population, but has also become a world leader in pharmaceutical exports, particularly 
generic drugs.  India’s laws, regulations, and government enforcement have not kept pace with 
the industry’s growth, and India is seeing an increasing number of diversion issues both within 
the country and internationally.  Drugs can be diverted from licit pharmaceutical manufacturers 
or produced illegally in clandestine or legitimate laboratories.  
 


INCSR 2018 Volume 1 
 
 
 
 
Chemical Controls 
 
66 
 
India has seen a sharp rise in the number of pharmaceutical and chemical diversion cases with 
investigative links to the United States.  Both restricted internet websites (“dark web”) and call 
center operations based in India continue to feed illicit U.S. drug markets.  In the past year, U.S. 
Customs and Border Patrol made numerous seizures of controlled pharmaceuticals originating 
from India.  DEA offices are also currently working multiple diversion investigations with ties to 
India.  Based on leads passed from the DEA, Indian drug authorities in Gujrat, Mumbai, and 
other cities in India, have made multiple seizures of millions of tablets of diverted controlled 
drugs, many of which were destined for illicit U.S. markets.   
 
As the United States and China work to stem precursor chemical diversion from China, U.S. 
authorities have detected some cases of drug traffickers shifting to India to obtain chemical 
supplies from Indian markets.    
 
Indian-sourced tramadol is an ongoing threat in the Middle East and North Africa, with reported 
connections to terrorist groups.  Tramadol is a Schedule IIII controlled substance in the United 
States but only falls under the India Drugs and Cosmetic Rule of 1945.  As a result, production 
and export of tramadol in India is lightly regulated by Indian law enforcement.    
 
Republic of Korea (South Korea) 
 
The Republic of Korea is a source country for criminals to obtain precursor chemicals for illegal 
narcotics.  Precursor chemicals used for the manufacture of illicit drugs, such as acetic 
anhydride, pseudoephedrine and ephedrine, are imported from the United States, Japan, India 
and China and either resold within the Republic of Korea or smuggled to other countries.  In 
2016, the Republic of Korea imported approximately 28.5 MT of ephedrine and 37 MT of 
pseudoephedrine.  As of 2016, 31 precursor chemicals were controlled by the Republic of 
Korean authorities.   
  
Both the Republic of Korean Customs Service and Ministry of Food and Drug Safety (MFDS) 
participate in INCB-coordinated taskforces including Projects Cohesion and Prism, which 
monitor imports of potassium permanganate and chemicals used to produce amphetamine-type 
stimulants.  The Republic of Korean law enforcement authorities also cooperate with Southeast 
Asian nations to verify documents, confirm the existence of importing businesses and send 
representatives to the region to investigate. 
  
In 2011, the National Assembly passed a law requiring manufacturers and exporters of precursor 
chemicals to register with the government, and the MFDS periodically provides education to the 
Republic of Korean businesses to prevent them from unknowingly exporting such chemicals to 
fraudulent importers. 
 
If proper customs and chemical regulations are followed, precursor chemical shipments can be 
legitimately shipped.  Most chemicals are shipped by containerized cargo via ocean freighters.  
The current threshold for reporting designated precursor chemicals is 1,000 kg.  Given this 
threshold, the “smurfing” of acetic anhydride – a method of avoiding detection by assembling a 
number of small quantity product purchases from multiple retail outlets – is difficult to identify.

The Republic of Korean authorities continue to work closely with U.S. counterparts to track 
suspect shipments. 
 
Singapore   
 
Singapore’s geographic advantage and robust port infrastructure contribute to its rank as one of 
the world’s top trade hubs, including for the trade of precursor chemicals.  The Government of 
Singapore continues to partner with concerned countries in international chemical control 
initiatives to prevent the diversion of synthetic drug precursor chemicals, including ephedrine, 
pseudoephedrine and other essential primary chemicals, like potassium permanganate and acetic 
anhydride.  Singapore is one of the largest distributors of acetic anhydride in Asia. Used in film 
processing and the manufacture of plastics, pharmaceuticals, and industrial chemicals, acetic 
anhydride is also the primary acetylating agent for heroin.  
 
Singapore does not produce ephedrine or pseudoephedrine; however, Singapore sees significant 
volumes of ephedrine and pseudoephedrine coming through its ports.  Singapore exported 35,274 
kg of pseudoephedrine and 8,775 kg of ephedrine in 2016, and imported 37,599 kg and 10,025 
kg respectively.  Most of the ephedrine imported to Singapore originated from India and Taiwan, 
and the bulk of which is then re-exported to Indonesia’s pharmaceutical companies.  The 
imported pseudoephedrine originates mostly from India, China, Germany, and Taiwan, and then 
is often re-exported to pharmaceutical companies in Indonesia. Singapore also exports both 
chemicals to Vietnam, Cambodia, Malaysia, and Nepal for pharmaceutical purposes.  Ephedrine 
and pseudoephedrine that are not re-exported are used primarily by the domestic pharmaceutical 
industry.  Singapore imported 200 grams of phenyl-2-propanone in the same 2016 reporting 
period.  Singapore did not export any phenyl-2-propanone in 2016. 
 
Since 2012, the Singapore Central Narcotics Bureau (CNB) had no diversion-related seizures of 
ephedrine and pseudoephedrine.  
 
The CNB is the Competent Authority (CA) in Singapore for the 1988 UN Drug Convention and 
is tasked with undertaking measures to prevent the diversion of ephedrine and pseudoephedrine.  
All imports, exports and transshipments of these controlled substances require a permit from the 
CNB, and supporting documentation must be kept by the companies for a minimum of two years 
and made available for inspection by the CNB.  Supporting documents may include invoice, sale 
contracts, and documentary proof from the competent authority of the exporting countries.  The 
movement of these controlled substances is also tracked and monitored by CNB.  If the permit 
application is approved, CNB will provide Pre-Export Notification or PEN-Online to the CA of 
the importing country for any exportation of substances.  
 
Information on all goods imported and exported through Singapore’s borders must be provided 
in advance to enable Singapore Customs, the Immigration and Checkpoints Authority or other 
controlling agencies to facilitate legitimate and secured trade through measures such as timely 
pre-clearance risk assessment.  Singapore does not currently require advance cargo manifest 
information nor screen transshipments unless they involve conveyances from select countries of 
international concern, a Singapore consignee, or contain strategic or controlled items, including 
certain chemicals.

In August 2016, Singapore announced that it would conduct a three-year trial of the World 
Customs Organization’s Cargo Targeting System, which receives carriers’ electronic cargo 
manifest data including transshipments to identify high-risk shipments across a variety of threats.  
Singapore solicited carriers to provide data on a voluntary basis; seven shipping lines have 
signed up to transmit data during the pilot and four of the seven have begun transmitting 
manifest data electronically.  In instances where precursor diversion for illicit drug 
manufacturing purposes was suspected, Singapore authorities have assisted foreign law 
enforcement agencies.  The Government of Singapore conducts site visits on companies dealing 
with controlled chemicals to ensure awareness of the requirements and overall compliance.  
 
The Port of Singapore is the world's second busiest port in terms of shipping tonnage and is the 
world's busiest transshipment port.  Singapore authorities have never reported a diversion of 
precursor chemicals used in the manufacturing of methamphetamine from Singapore's 
pharmaceutical, biotechnology, and fine chemical industries, nor have they reported the seizure 
of any domestic clandestine methamphetamine laboratories.   
 
Taiwan   
 
The Taiwan Ministry of Economic Affairs Industrial Development Bureau imposes strict 
reporting requirements in tracking the production, distribution, sale, storage, and export/import 
of 25 of the 26 precursor chemicals scheduled under the 1988 UN Drug Convention.  During the 
second quarter of 2017, approximately 932 companies had reported chemicals-related activities 
through a web-based reporting system.  Taiwan’s Food and Drug Administration (TFDA) 
supervises the trade and use of finished products containing ephedrine, pseudoephedrine, and 
other chemicals under the Controlled Drugs Act, including by end-users such as hospitals.   
 
In 2016, TFDA inspected 17,145 facilities involved in the production, sale, and use of drugs 
subject to the Act and found 437 violations, primarily for administrative errors or failure to keep 
timely reporting of uses and inventories of medicines containing those chemicals.  The violation 
ratio increased slightly from 2.13 percent in 2015 to 2.55 percent in 2016.  In June 2017, TFDA 
announced the addition of Alpha-PVP, MEAPP, Dibutylone, and 5-Fluoro-AMB to its controlled 
substances list due to the increased detection of the use of these substances in drug tests of 
individuals suspected of drug use. 
 
Thailand   
 
Precursor chemicals are not produced in Thailand, but the government imports chemicals in bulk 
for licit medical and industrial purposes.  The Precursor Chemical Control Committee is 
responsible for formulating the national strategy on precursor controls.  The Office of the 
Narcotics Control Board (ONCB) is the principal Thai law enforcement agency responsible for 
enforcing the laws against the illicit diversion of prohibited chemicals.   
 
Improved law enforcement capabilities of Thai authorities and more intense scrutiny of end-user 
requirements have led to a decrease in illicit diversion through Thailand over the past several 
years.  The growing availability of drugs and chemicals from sources in China and India has

Chemical Controls 
 
69 
 
further mitigated the use of Thai chemical diversion channels.  Nevertheless, it is probable that 
acetic anhydride and ephedrine continue to transit Thailand en route to clandestine laboratories 
in Burma.  Acetic anhydride is produced in Indonesia, while other chemicals are brokered 
through Indonesian chemical houses and transported through Malaysia into Thailand.  
Pseudoephedrine and ephedrine enter Thailand by couriers or by air, or containerized maritime 
cargo before being transshipped overland from northern or northeastern Thailand provinces to 
methamphetamine production centers in Burma, Laos, and/or Cambodia.   
 
The sale of pseudoephedrine tablets has been prohibited at local pharmacies for several years.  In 
2013, due to the determination of an imminent threat to the public safety, the Thai Ministry of 
Public Health signed into law the control of mephedrone, methylenedioxypyrovalerone (MPDV), 
and methylone.  These substances are designated narcotics in schedule I under the Narcotic 
Drugs Act B.E. 2522 (1979) and their importation, exportation, and possession are strictly 
prohibited.   
 
Thailand is a State party to the 1988 UN Drug Convention and has placed stringent controls on 
the 26 chemicals listed in Table I and Table II of that Convention.  The Royal Thai Government 
has further imposed controls on seven additional chemicals because of its unique domestic 
situation and its geographic proximity to the major Burma-based drug-producing and trafficking 
organizations.  These chemicals include:  acethyl chloride; chloroform; ethylidine diacetate; 
glacial acetic acid; phosphorus trichloride; phosphorus pentachloride; and thionyl chloride.  
Controls are also in place for caffeine, which can be used to produce methamphetamine tablets.  
Further, Thailand provides pre-export notifications via the INCB’s PEN Online as a means of 
discouraging the diversion of precursors and essential chemicals in the illicit manufacture of 
narcotic drugs and psychotropic substances.   
 
Europe   
 
Chemical diversion control within the EU is based upon EU regulations binding on all 28 
Member States.  EU regulations meet the chemical control provisions of the 1988 UN Drug 
Convention, including provisions for record-keeping on transactions in controlled chemicals, a 
system of permits or declarations for exports and imports of regulated chemicals, and authority 
for governments to suspend chemical shipments.  EU regulations are updated regularly and 
directly applicable in all EU Member States.   
 
EU regulations establish common risk management rules to counter chemical diversion at the 
EU’s borders.  Member States are responsible for investigating and prosecuting violators.   
 
The U.S.-EU Chemical Control Agreement, signed May 28, 1997, is the formal basis for U.S. 
cooperation with the EU and its Member States in chemical control through enhanced regulatory 
cooperation and mutual assistance.  The agreement calls for annual meetings of a Joint Follow-
up Group to review implementation of the agreement and to coordinate positions in other areas, 
such as national or joint positions on chemical control matters before larger multilateral fora, 
including the CND.   
 


INCSR 2018 Volume 1 
 
 
 
 
Chemical Controls

In December 2013, the EU adopted new basic legislation that strengthens controls on ephedrine 
and pseudoephedrine, and tightens controls on companies in the EU using acetic anhydride.   
 
For external trade, the change strengthened controls on medicinal products containing ephedrine 
or pseudoephedrine exported from or transiting through the EU.  The EU developed a new 
category of scheduled substances (Category 4), imposed mandatory export authorization and pre-
export notification, and extended enforcement power to stop and seize cargo if there is 
“reasonable doubt” concerning the shipment.  For trade within EU territory, compulsory 
registration of end-users for acetic anhydride was introduced by creating a new subcategory 
(2A).  Additionally, a definition of “user” was added for natural or legal persons possessing 
substances for purposes other than placing them in the market.   
 
Other amendments to the regulation to facilitate tracking and enforcement include introducing 
definitions for scheduled substance and natural products, strengthening the rules for licensing 
and registration by introducing explicit criteria for granting or refusing licenses and registrations, 
increasing the power of competent authorities to control non-scheduled substances, 
implementing a quick reaction mechanism to add new chemicals to the list of scheduled 
substances, developing an EU database on drug precursors, and improving data protection 
provisions.   
 
On July 1, 2015, a Commission Delegated Regulation and a Commission Implementing 
Regulation entered into force (replacing previous implementation legislation).  These regulations 
complete the revision of the EU drug precursor legislation that started at the end of 2013.   
 
Bilateral chemical control cooperation continues between the United States, and EU as well as its 
Member states.  Many EU Member States participate in voluntary initiatives such as Project 
Cohesion and Project Prism.  In 2007, the EU established guidelines for private sector operators 
involved in trading in precursor chemicals, with a view to offering practical guidance on the 
implementation of the main provisions of EU legislation on precursor chemicals, in particular the 
prevention of illegal diversion.  These guidelines, now titled “Guidelines for Operators – Drug 
Precursors' Control in the European Union,” were updated in 2017.   
 
Belgium   
 
Belgium has not historically been a producer of chemical precursors for the production of illicit 
drugs, though some Belgian chemical exports have been utilized in the production of 
methamphetamine in Mexico.  Belgium enforces strong reporting requirements for the trade of 
precursor chemicals.  The Belgian Federal Police have the lead role in enforcing these controls; 
however, shipments of pharmaceutical preparations containing pseudoephedrine and ephedrine 
are only controlled on a regulatory level by the Belgian Ministry of Health. 
 
Germany   
 
Germany continues to be a leading manufacturer of legal pharmaceuticals and chemicals.  Most 
of the 26 scheduled substances under international control as listed in Tables I and II of the 1988 
UN Drug Convention and other chemicals, which can be used for the illicit production of 


INCSR 2018 Volume 1 
 
 
 
 
Chemical Controls 
 
71 
 
narcotic drugs, are manufactured and/or sold by the German chemical and pharmaceutical 
industry.  Germany’s National Precursor Monitoring Act complies with EU regulations.  
Germany has a highly developed chemical sector, which is tightly controlled through a 
combination of national and EU regulations, law enforcement action, and voluntary industry 
compliance.  Cooperation between the chemical and pharmaceutical industry, merchants, and 
German authorities is a key element in Germany’s chemical control strategy. 
   
Germany works closely with the UNODC, and is an active participant in chemical control 
initiatives led by the INCB, including Project Prism and Project Cohesion.  The United States 
works closely with Germany’s chemical regulatory agency, the Federal Institute for Drugs and 
Medical Devices, on chemical control issues and exchanges bilateral information to promote 
transnational chemical control initiatives.  German agencies cooperate closely with their U.S. 
counterparts to identify and stop chemical precursor diversion.

closely with their U.S. counterparts to identify and stop chemical precursor diversion.   
 
The Netherlands   
 
The Netherlands has a large chemical industry with large chemical storage facilities, and 
Rotterdam serves as a major chemical shipping port.  The Netherlands has strong legislation and 
regulatory controls over the industry, and law enforcement authorities track domestic shipments 
and work closely with international partners.  Trade in precursor chemicals is governed by the 
1995 Act on the Prevention of Misuse of Chemicals to Prevent Abuse of Chemical Substances 
(WVMC), which aims to prevent the diversion of legal chemicals.  Chemical substances are also 
governed under The Act on Economic Offences and the Opium Act, and EU regulations.  
  
Production of synthetic drugs is significant in the Netherlands.  Recent trends show an increase 
in new types of precursors and pre-precursors to circumvent national and international 
legislation.  APAAN is used in amphetamine production and acetic anhydride is used as a pre-
precursor for benzyl methyl ketone (BMK).  Safrole continues to be used as a pre-precursor for 
piperonyl methyl ketone (PMK), though availability has decreased since 2014.  The main (pre-) 
precursors used in the Netherlands are APAA (similar to APAAN), PMK, and BMK-glycidates.  
In recent years, law enforcement, especially in the south, reinforced its efforts to combat 
synthetic drugs and pre-precursors.  In August 2017, a court had its first conviction of a suspect 
for possession of APAA.  
  
The Financial Investigation Service (FIOD) of the Ministry of Finance oversees implementation 
of the WVMC and has responsibility for law enforcement efforts targeting precursors.  Customs 
monitors the trade and production of chemicals.   
 
The chemical industry is legally obliged to report suspicious transactions.  The Netherlands 
abides by all EU regulations for drug precursors.  
   


INCSR 2018 Volume 1 
 
 
 
 
Chemical Controls 
 
72 
 
The Netherlands is one of the initiators of and an active participant in the Project Prism taskforce 
led by the INCB.  The Dutch government also continues to work closely with the United States 
on precursor chemical controls and investigations.  The Netherlands has had a memorandum of 
understanding with China since 2004 concerning chemical precursor investigations.  
  
The Netherlands requires a license for the manufacture and trade of ephedrine.  Relevant reports 
on suspicious transactions are shared nationally and internationally.  The Netherlands also 
monitors a number of non-registered substances used in the production of methamphetamine.   
  
Switzerland   
 
The Government of Switzerland continues to be a strong partner of the United States and other 
concerned countries in international chemical control initiatives to prevent the diversion of 
synthetic drug precursor chemicals, including ephedrine and pseudoephedrine, and other 
primarily essential chemicals, including potassium permanganate and acetic anhydride.  
Switzerland is a significant importer and exporter of ephedrine and pseudoephedrine.  In 2016, 
Switzerland imported 51,716 kg of ephedrine and 49,965 kg of pseudoephedrine, while 
exporting 33,153 kg of ephedrine and 33,027 kg of pseudoephedrine during the same period.  
 
Swiss control measures concerning precursor chemicals such as ephedrine and pseudoephedrine 
are governed by the Federal Narcotics Control Ordinance and the Federal Department of Home 
Affairs’ Ordinance on the Directory of Narcotics.  The Ordinances require importers and 
exporters of ephedrine and pseudoephedrine to obtain a license from Swissmedic, Switzerland’s 
relevant regulatory authority, and require chemical manufacturers to provide “end user” 
certificates.  In an effort to more effectively deter illegal dissemination of these precursor 
chemicals, regulations have been strengthened as of October 1, 2017 to require a license and 
“end user” certificates for import or export of preparations containing these precursor chemicals.   
 
As of October 1, 2017, potassium permanganate and acetic anhydride have been added to the list 
of chemicals requiring a license from Swissmedic.  Exceptions still exist for certain preparations 
which are believed to be low risk (for example, preparations related to certain common 
medicines).   
 
Switzerland participates in multilateral chemical control initiatives led by the INCB, including 
Project Prism and Project Cohesion.  Switzerland also participates in the International Import and 
Export Authorization System (I2ES), which facilitates effective implementation of import and 
export authorization systems for legal international trade in narcotic drugs and psychotropic 
substances.  
 
Swiss law enforcement agencies have established close cooperation with the Swiss chemical 
manufacturing and trading industries and counterparts in major chemical manufacturing and 
trading countries.  This cooperation includes information exchanges in support of chemical 
control programs and in the investigation of diversion attempts.  Cooperation between U.S. and 
Swiss law enforcement agencies, particularly the Swiss Federal Criminal Police, on chemical 
control related issues is excellent.

The United Kingdom   
 
The United Kingdom remains a leading producer of precursor chemicals, particularly ephedrine 
and pseudoephedrine, which can be used in the production of illicit drugs.  However, because the 
UK applies a strict regulatory regime to the production and trade of precursor chemicals, 
including mandatory licensing and reporting obligations, only relatively small amounts are 
believed to be diverted for illicit use. The Home Office Drug Licensing and Compliance Unit is 
the regulatory body for precursor chemical control in the UK.  The United States and UK 
cooperate closely in international bodies to promote global regulation of precursor chemicals.   
   
Middle East   
 
Egypt 
 
Egypt oversees the import and export of all internationally-recognized chemicals through a 
committee composed of the Ministry of Interior (Anti-Narcotics General Administration – 
ANGA), Ministry of Finance (Customs), and Ministry of Health (Pharmaceutical).  This 
committee approves or denies requests to import or export chemicals.  Over the past few years, 
there was a spike in the importation of ephedrine, going from 36,879 kg in 2015 to 326,441 kg in 
2016; a 887.02 percent increase.  If this data is accurate, the reason for such increased demand is 
unknown.  With the large amounts of ephedrine imported relative to the population of Egypt, it is 
possible that not all of it is used for legitimate medicinal production.  The Egyptian government, 
however, has not reported any large-scale diversion of ephedrine or other chemicals, made any 
significant seizures, or observed any increase in the use of methamphetamine in the local 
populace.    
 
Significant Illicit Drug Manufacturing Countries   
 
This section is also broken down by region and focuses on illicit drug manufacturing countries, 
their chemical control policies, and related efforts.   
 
Asia   
 
Afghanistan    
 
Inadequate border security and weak enforcement capacity hamper control of precursor 
chemicals in Afghanistan.  During 2017, Afghan officials noted an increase in the amount of 
precursor chemicals trafficked into Afghanistan. 
 
Both acetic anhydride and ammonium nitrate are illegal in Afghanistan and have no legitimate 
uses.  Hydrochloric acid, acetone, and sulfuric acid are controlled substances and subject to 
seizure for other reasons, such as customs violations.  Ammonium chloride is not illegal, but if 
found at a laboratory site, Afghan authorities seize and destroy it.  Since 2013, the United States 
has supported the UNODC Container Control Program (CCP) to develop units in Kabul and at 
key ports of entry on the Afghan borders with Pakistan, Uzbekistan, and Tajikistan.  Through 
training and assistance, CCP promotes effective container controls to prevent drug trafficking

and other illicit activities, and to facilitate legitimate trade.  The program enables effective 
information sharing with other countries participating in CCP, especially neighboring Central 
Asian states. 
 
The Precursor Control Unit (PCU) of the Counternarcotics Police of Afghanistan is a specialized 
unit devoted to combating the burgeoning precursor problem.  Afghanistan uses the on-line 
Precursor Incident Communication System developed by the INCB to enhance information 
sharing between national authorities on precursor incidents.  The PCU communicates directly 
with the Central Asian Regional Information and Coordination Center for Combating Illicit 
Trafficking of Narcotic Drugs, Psychotropic Substances and their Precursors, and the Pre-Export 
Notification system.  Beginning in early 2016, the United States funded capacity building for 
regional PCU staff through a UNODC training program. 
 
Under existing counternarcotics law, Afghanistan maintains a Drug Regulation Committee 
(DRC) to monitor and regulate the licit precursor chemical trade.  The DRC licenses chemicals 
for licit use and stores data on the use of chemicals so authorities can better understand emerging 
trends.  The DRC also authorizes investigations and spot checks on companies importing 
chemicals. 
   
Burma   
 
Burmese authorities continue to face challenges in controlling the illicit import and diversion of 
precursor chemicals used to produce illicit drugs, exacerbated by the country’s extremely porous 
borders, especially in areas not under government control.  Even in areas along the border 
controlled by the government, border control officers are ill-equipped to identify and interdict the 
illegal movements and trafficking of precursor chemicals.  
  
Burma does not have a significant chemical industry and does not manufacture ephedrine, 
pseudoephedrine or acetic anhydride.  Organized criminal syndicates smuggle precursor 
chemicals into Burma through borders shared with Bangladesh, China, Laos, India and 
Thailand.  The precursors are then transported to heroin refineries and ATS laboratories in 
regions of Shan State that are under the control of armed militia groups or in other areas that are 
lightly-policed.   
 
The flow of precursor chemicals has been a major factor in the increase in the production and 
export of ATS.  Recent large-scale seizures along the Burmese-Thai border indicate that 
numerous pill press labs have been established in key cross border transit towns, such as 
Tacheleik.  The establishment of the pill press production sites makes it easy to produce and then 
smuggle pills over nearby border locations.  There are also mobile ATS laboratories along the 
Burma-Bangladesh border.  The crisis in Northern Rakhine State has created a hub for ATS 
trafficking and reports of seized drugs are received almost daily.   
 
A Supervision Committee for the Control of Precursor Chemicals, which functions within the 
Central Committee for Drug Abuse Control (CCDAC), monitors the possession, use, sale, 
production, and transportation of chemical precursors.  Importers of licit chemicals are required 
to use a pre-import notification system to obtain a certificate of verification from the CCDAC, 


INCSR 2018 Volume 1 
 
 
 
 
Chemical Controls 
 
75 
 
and retailers must also apply for a certificate to transport chemicals across and within Burma’s 
borders.  To date, the Committee has identified 26 substances as precursor chemicals, and 
prohibited their import, sale or use in Burma. 
  
According to official Burmese government seizure statistics, during the first 10 months of 2017, 
authorities seized 3,901,031 tablets of pseudoephedrine; 5.87 MT of caffeine powder; 8,080 
liters of sulphuric acid; and 86,980 liters of hydrochloric acid.  Burma is a State party to the 1988 
UN Drug Convention, but has not yet instituted laws that meet all UN chemical control 
provisions.   
  
The United States funds UNODC’s support for strengthened border management Border Liaison 
Offices (BLOs).  This program includes capacity-building trainings for frontline officers on 
precursor chemical detection.  
 
Indonesia 
 
Indonesia’s 2009 National Narcotics Law gave the country’s National Narcotics Board (BNN) 
the authority to monitor narcotics and precursor production at pharmaceutical plants, and to 
conduct investigations and arrests in response to precursor and narcotics violations.  Although 
there were several laws and regulations regarding the import and export of precursor chemicals, 
the extent of enforcement was largely unknown.   
 
Regarding the two most widely sought-after precursor chemicals used for cocaine and heroin 
production – potassium permanganate (cocaine) and acetic anhydride (heroin) – the United 
States is unaware of a single seizure in 2017 by Indonesian law enforcement.  BNN reported that 
it regularly conducts unannounced inspections to companies that are listed importers of precursor 
chemicals.  Every year, through the Ministry of Health, Indonesia reports estimates of its legal 
domestic narcotics precursors to the INCB. 
  
Pakistan   
 
Pakistan is a destination and transshipment point for diverted shipments of acetic anhydride and 
other precursor chemicals used in the production of heroin and amphetamine-type stimulants.  
Pakistan does not domestically produce industrial-scale quantities of either acetic anhydride or 
ephedrine, though it has chemical and pharmaceutical industries with a legitimate, albeit modest, 
demand for these substances. 
  
Pakistan enforces a basic precursor control regime as part of its obligations under the UN drug 
control conventions, covering the import of seven multi-use chemicals: acetic anhydride; 
pseudoephedrine; anthranilic acid; acetone; potassium permanganate; methyl-ethyl ketone; and 
toluene.  The country’s Anti-Narcotics Force (ANF) is charged with managing precursor control 
and does so largely by conducting ground checks on importing businesses, licensing those 
businesses, and reviewing Pre-Export Notifications (PENs) requesting the sale of these 
substances within Pakistan.  Besides ANF, 15 federal and provincial agencies share 
responsibility for chemical control throughout the country.  Per CND Resolution 49/3, ANF 
established two review committees to manage the precursor control mechanism, the Committee 


INCSR 2018 Volume 1 
 
 
 
 
Chemical Controls 
 
76 
 
for Granting Non Objection Certificates to Companies and Firms for Use of Precursor Chemicals 
and the Committee for Quota Allocation to Pharmaceutical Companies. 
  
During the first nine months of 2017, ANF received 83 PENs, approving 54 and denying 29.  It 
is likely that significant imports of precursor chemicals circumvent the PENs system via 
mislabeled shipping containers and by maritime smuggling along Pakistan’s coastline.  During 
the first nine months of 2017, ANF reported seizing 758 liters of acetic anhydride. 
 
In 2017, both ANF and Pakistani Customs continued to submit information via the INCB’s 
PICS, which distributes real-time information on precursor seizures to law enforcement agencies 
worldwide.   
 
The Andean Region   
 
Bolivia   
 
Bolivia’s government passed a new Controlled Substances Law in March 2017 that schedules 
precursor chemicals in coordination with the INCB, but it is not yet clear if pending regulations 
to implement this law will successfully prevent diversion of the chemicals used to process coca 
into cocaine.  Precursor chemicals continue to be diverted through black market channels into 
Bolivia for processing cocaine.  According to the Chemical Substances Investigations Group 
(GISUQ) of the counternarcotic police (FELCN), the majority of these chemicals come from 
Peru (about 40 percent), followed by Paraguay (30 percent), Brazil (20 percent), and Argentina 
and Chile, (five percent each). 
 
The most common chemicals seized as contraband match those commonly found in drug 
factories (where base paste is prepared) and cocaine labs (where base paste is transformed into 
cocaine HCl).  In addition to serving as a transit country for illicit drug shipments, Bolivia is also 
a source country for coca and cocaine processing.  The number of labs within Bolivia that 
process Peruvian base paste and Bolivian coca into cocaine has significantly increased over the 
last four years.  The most common chemicals found in cocaine factories and labs are sulfuric 
acid; hydrochloric acid; sodium carbonate; caustic soda; phenacetin; sodium metabisulfite; 
activated carbon; ethyl acetate; and levamisole.  The last five products are not listed as controlled 
substances under Bolivian law, and GISUQ believes they are alternative chemicals that drug 
producers use to avoid law enforcement controls.  Traffickers use activated carbon to deodorize 
and discolor water and other liquids, and phenacetin, a highly toxic analgesic, is used to increase 
the volume of cocaine. 
 
The GISUQ is charged with locating and interdicting chemicals used in the traditional cocaine 
process, such as sulfuric acid, hydrochloric acid, and gasoline. The GISUQ coordinates activities 
with the General Directorate for Controlled Substances, a civilian entity under the Government 
of Bolivia that administers and licenses the commercialization and transport of controlled 
substances listed under Bolivian domestic law.  Under the new Controlled Substances Law, 
violation of controlled substances could result in penal action against all participants, a change 
from the old law wherein unlicensed transport and commercialization generated only an 


INCSR 2018 Volume 1 
 
 
 
 
Chemical Controls 
 
77 
 
administrative violation.  The new law provides the legal framework for GISUQ, in coordination 
with other agencies, to add or eliminate chemical substances controlled under Bolivian law.   
 
The Bolivian government does not have control regimes for ephedrine and pseudoephedrine.  
The GISUQ, however, coordinates with the Ministry of Health to supervise and interdict illegal 
commercialization of methamphetamine.  In September 2016, the Ministry of health created the 
State Agency of Medicines and Health Technologies to regulate the use and commercialization 
of synthetic drugs. 
 
During the first 10 months of 2017, the GISUQ seized 80 MT of solid substances and 142,555 
liters of liquid precursor chemicals.    
 
Colombia   
 
Precursor chemical diversion is a serious problem in Colombia that receives growing attention 
from the government.  According to the Information System for the Control of Substances and 
Chemical Products – SICOQ, a tracking tool developed in partnership with the National Police – 
as of November 2017, 2,689 companies were certified for the legal use of controlled substances 
and chemical products.  The Colombian National Police, working with the Attorney General and 
the Ministry of Justice, inspected every certified company during 2017, finding administrative 
irregularities on 86 visits, and confiscating approximately 968 MT of solid chemicals and 20,282 
liters of liquid chemicals. 
 
The Government of Colombia restricts chemicals needed for coca processing, such as sulfuric 
acid, hydrochloride acid, and potassium permanganate, as well as cement.  It limits production, 
distribution, and storage of precursors nationwide and prohibits gasoline and other chemicals in 
certain zones.  Additionally, Colombian companies are not authorized to export ephedrine or 
pseudoephedrine in bulk form.  All pharmaceutical products containing ephedrine or 
pseudoephedrine have been banned from domestic distribution.  To strengthen the interdiction of 
chemical precursors, the Ministry of Justice developed a strategy to facilitate the exchange of 
information and intelligence on how particular substances are being used in the processing of 
coca.  
 
While the Colombian government tightened controls on coca-processing chemicals and 
strengthened chemical-control legislation, traffickers are still able to camouflage precursors to 
clandestinely import them into Colombia.  Although chemical companies require government 
permission to import or export specific chemicals and controlled substances, the police have the 
burden to prove seized chemicals were intended for illicit drug production.  Additionally, 
traffickers and clandestine laboratories recycle controlled chemicals and replace controlled 
chemicals with non-controlled chemicals.    
 
Peru   
 
Peru produces precursor chemicals such as sulfuric acid and is a major importer of other 
chemicals essential to cocaine production.  Chemicals are principally imported into Peru licitly 


INCSR 2018 Volume 1 
 
 
 
 
Chemical Controls 
 
78 
 
by wholesalers through the Port of Callao and are later diverted for illicit purposes by smaller 
actors for cocaine production.  Peru requires all chemical sector entities to obtain a license. 
 
Peru’s authority to regulate the precursor chemicals used in illicit drug production is based on 
Legislative Decree 1126 and the regulation set forth in Supreme Decree 010-2015EF, which 
establish protocols for sanctions and fines related to the chemical industry.  However, Supreme 
Decree 010-2015EF is not effectively enforced.  The National Superintendence of Customs and 
Taxes (SUNAT) is the regulatory agency handling all issues related to the chemical industry, but 
SUNAT does not have law enforcement powers and is limited to investigative activities.  SUNAT 
coordinates with the Peruvian National Police (PNP) to combat diversion of precursor chemicals. 
 
Direccion Ejecutiva Antidrogas’ (DIREJANDRO) Precursor Chemical Unit, DEPCIQ, reported 
an increase in PNP seizures of precursor chemicals during the first 10 months of 2017 – from 
6,528 MT in 2016 to 7,826 MT in 2017.  Peru continued to implement the 2015 Precursor 
Chemicals Initiative to cover approximately 70 percent of roads in the VRAEM, the Peru-Bolivia 
border, as well as the Junin, Ayacucho, and Lima regions utilizing 12 backscatter x-ray scanners 
in strategic corridor routes. 
 
Suspected corruption between entities in SUNAT and the PNP results in unwillingness to provide 
investigative information related to precursor chemicals.   
 
Peru has worked to implement the CND Resolution 49/3 by tasking SUNAT and the PNP to 
conduct joint investigations, with SUNAT providing intelligence developed from their import 
and distribution records and PNP conducting regulatory and enforcement activities. 
 
The Ministry of Health manages estimates of Peru’s INCB licit demand for ephedrine, 
pseudoephedrine, and P-2-P.  The Ministry’s Health Department does not have a regulatory or 
enforcement arm to prevent the diversion of chemicals.  According to the INCB, Peru does not 
have strict controls to prevent the diversion of ephedrine, pseudoephedrine, and P-2-P.  
Indications suggest that ephedrine and pseudoephedrine are entering the country in larger 
quantities than required by the INCB assessment of the country’s legitimate commercial 
requirements.   
 
Major Exporters and Importers of Pseudoephedrine and Ephedrine (Section 722, Combat 
Methamphetamine Epidemic Act (CMEA)   
 
This section of the INCSR is produced in response to the CMEA’s Section 722 requirement to 
report on the five major importing and exporting countries of the identified methamphetamine 
precursor chemicals.  In meeting the CMEA requirements, the Department of State and DEA 
considered the chemicals involved and the available data on their export, import, worldwide 
production, and the known legitimate demand.  The available data does not address illicit 
trafficking and production.   
 
Ephedrine and pseudoephedrine are no longer preferred chemicals for methamphetamine 
production trafficked to the United States, since traffickers are increasingly using substitutes or 
pre-precursors.  The phenomenon of substitute chemicals used in methamphetamine production

is particularly observed in Mexico, where the nitrostyrene method is used to produce P-2-P, 
which starts from benzaldehyde and nitroethane, or from the intermediary product 1-phenyl-2-
nitropropene, and in Europe, where the method using APAAN, are largely used.  
Phenylpropanolamine, a third chemical listed in the CMEA, is not a methamphetamine 
precursor, although it can be used as an amphetamine precursor.   
 
In 2000, the FDA issued warnings concerning significant health risks associated with 
phenylpropanolamine.  As a result, phenylpropanolamine is no longer approved for human 
consumption.  Phenylpropanolamine is still imported for veterinary medicines, and for the 
conversion to amphetamine for the legitimate manufacture of pharmaceutical products.  
Phenylpropanolamine is not a methamphetamine precursor chemical, and trade and production 
data are not available on phenylpropanolamine.  Therefore, this section provides information 
only on ephedrine and pseudoephedrine.   
 
The Global Trade Atlas (GTA), compiled by Global Trade Information Services, Inc. 
(WWW.GTIS.COM), provides export and import data for ephedrine and pseudoephedrine 
collected from major trading countries.  However, given the reporting cycles by participating 
countries, data often lags behind one year.  The most recent year for which full-year data is 
available is 2016.  The data, including data from the previous year, is continually revised as 
countries review and revise their data.  GTA data analysis and a chart identifying the sources of 
the data are presented in the tables at the end of this section.    
 
During the preparation of the 2017 CMEA report, GTA data for U.S. exports and imports for 
both ephedrine and pseudoephedrine for calendar years 2013-2015 were updated in light of 
revised estimates provided by DEA.  For the 2018 CMEA report, GTA data for U.S. exports and 
imports for both ephedrine and pseudoephedrine for calendar years 2014-2016 were also updated 
in light of revised estimates provided by DEA.   
 
Obtaining data on legitimate demand also remains problematic.  Such data is still not sufficient 
to enable any accurate estimates of diversion.  There are significant numbers of countries which 
have yet to report regularly to the INCB on their reasonable estimates about the trade in the end 
products that form the basis of legitimate demand – although each year the number of countries 
reporting increases.   
 
Nevertheless, many countries do not report trade in ephedrine and pseudoephedrine when it is 
incorporated into a finished pharmaceutical product, in the form of finished dosage units such as 
liquids, tablets, and capsules, due to concerns that this type of information is commercially 
sensitive.  Further challenges include governments that may not be able to ascertain this data if, 
for example, they do not subject pharmaceutical preparations to national control, or if a different 
ministry with different or less stringent means of oversight regulates preparations versus bulk 
chemicals.   
 
Ephedrine and pseudoephedrine pharmaceutical products are not specifically listed chemicals 
under the 1988 UN Drug Convention.  Therefore, reporting licit market trade and demand for 
ephedrine and pseudoephedrine as well pharmaceutical products derived from them is voluntary.  
Even so, the trend toward better reporting has been positive.

According to the 2017 INCB annual report on precursors and chemicals frequently used in the 
illicit manufacture of narcotic drugs and psychotropic substances, in 2016, a total of 23 countries 
and territories reported seizing raw ephedrine amounting to more than 5.8 MT, and 14 countries 
and territories reported seizures of nearly 25 MT of ephedrine in the form of pharmaceutical 
preparations.  India reported seizing a record amount of more than 21 MT of preparations 
containing ephedrine.  China reported the second-largest amount of preparations containing 
ephedrine seized (more than 3.3 MT).  China also accounted for the largest amount of ephedrine 
raw material seized (more than 1.4 MT), followed by New Zealand (1.2 MT) and Australia (1.1 
MT).  The amount of ephedrine (raw material) seized in China in 2016 was the lowest in 15 
years.   
 
Also in 2016, a total of 22 countries and territories reported seizures of pseudoephedrine.  
Australia reported seizures of 1.1 MT, while the total amount of all pseudoephedrine raw 
materials that was reported seized in other countries was less than 400 kg.  By contrast, seized 
preparations containing pseudoephedrine amounted to more than 4 MT.   
 
Since the passage of the 2006 CND resolution sponsored by the United States, and as of January 
2018, 166 countries had provided import requirements for the bulk chemicals and ephedrine and 
pseudoephedrine (and their preparations, where applicable) to the INCB.  Additionally, 157 
governments provided estimates for ephedrine raw material and 148 governments provided 
estimates for pseudoephedrine raw material.  This also included “zero” estimates.   
 
A further challenge to analyzing the data is that most countries have not attempted to reconcile 
trade data and their own reporting of licit requirements, although this continues to change.  
Countries are beginning to make efforts to reconcile data either from commercial industry, 
domestic use, or onward exports.  For instance, some countries that noted licit requirements, but 
had not reported into the GTA data exports or imports, have now begun to do so.   
 
Thus far, the economic analysis required by the CMEA remains challenging because of 
insufficient, unreliable, and changing data.  Often the collection and reporting of such data 
requires a regulatory infrastructure that is beyond the means of some governments.  It is also 
important to note that not all countries are familiar with the methodology and data sources used 
by the GTA to report the final numbers.  This increases the difficulty of comparing import or 
export totals across years.   
 
Nevertheless, the United States will continue to push in both diplomatic and operational forums 
– in both bilateral and multilateral settings – to urge countries to provide reporting on their licit 
domestic requirements for methamphetamine precursor chemicals to the INCB.  The United 
States will continue to work with the INCB and with authorities in the reporting countries to 
secure explanations for anomalies between reported imports and reported licit domestic 
requirements, and to follow the development of other chemicals used in the production of 
methamphetamine.   
 
This report provides export and import figures for both ephedrine and pseudoephedrine for 
calendar years 2014-2016.  The report illustrates the wide annual shifts that can occur in some

countries, reflecting such commercial factors as demand, pricing, and inventory buildup.  GTA 
data on U.S. exports and imports have been included to indicate the importance of the United 
States in international pseudoephedrine and ephedrine trade.  Complete data on the worldwide 
production of pseudoephedrine and ephedrine are not available because major producers will not 
release this proprietary data.

Analysis of Export Data:  The top-five exporters of ephedrine in 2016 were India, Germany, 
the UK, Singapore, and Switzerland.  According to the Global Trade Atlas (GTA) database, 
ephedrine exports increased 7.7 percent in 2016, due to an increase in exports from India and the 
UK.  India’s exports had a 20.4percent increase; going from 412,713 kg in 2015 to 496,919 kg in 
2016.  The country continues to rank as the top global exporter of ephedrine for this year’s 
report.  Germany exports has decreased from 333,171 kg in 2015 to 297,737 kg in 2016; a 10.64 
percent decrease.   
 
The UK, however, increased its exports between 2015 and 2016, from 229,613 kg to 270,815 kg; 
a 17.94 percent increase.  Singapore decreased it exports by 15.69 percent between 2015 and 
2016.  This year, Switzerland returned as the fifth leading exporter, despite the fact its exports 
dropped 16 percent between 2015 and 2016.  The top-five economies in 2015 included:  India, 
Germany, the UK, Singapore, and Denmark.  
 
According to the most current information provided by DEA, U.S. exports were 1 kg in 2014, 2 
kg in 2015, and 0 kg in 2016.  For the purposes of this report, and in the case of the United States 
only, we have relied on the data provided by DEA.

Analysis of Export Data:  According to the GTA database, the aggregated volume of 
worldwide exports of pseudoephedrine for the 2016 top-five exporters slightly increased from 
972,287 kg in 2015 to 1,047,626 kg in 2015; a 7.8 percent increase.  The top-five exporters of 
pseudoephedrine in 2016 were India, Germany, the UK, Singapore, and Switzerland.  In 2015, 
the top-five economies were India, Germany, the UK, China, and Singapore.  Only India and the 
UK increased their pseudoephedrine exports in 2016.  India exports increased from 355,351 kg 
in 2015 to 434,307 kg in 2016; a 22.2percent increase.  The UK exports also increased between 
2015 and 2016, going from 220,663 to 268,156; a 21.5 percent increase.  On the other hand, 
Germany, Singapore, and Switzerland’s exports dropped an average of 18.3 percent in the three 
countries. 
 
According to the most current information provided by the DEA, the United States increased its 
pseudoephedrine exports from 19,282 kg in 2014 to 23,870 kg in 2015, a 23.79 percent increase.  
In 2016, the United States increased its pseudoephedrine exports from 23,870 kg in 2015 to

Analysis of Import Data:  According to the GTA database, the top-five ephedrine importers in 
2016 were Greece, Egypt, Republic of Korea, Spain, and Switzerland.  Greece has appeared this

year as a major ephedrine importer, going from 48,750 kg in 2015 to 1,409,807 in 2016; a 2,792 
percent increase.  Historically, similar single-year spikes in imports have been attributed to 
market fluctuations involving legitimate trade.  This could also be a single-year anomaly due 
purely to vagaries of the commercial market, as Greece has not been identified as a significant 
source country for precursor chemicals used to produce methamphetamine.  Additional annual 
reporting will be required to determine whether this data points to a genuine trend in sales or 
represents a temporary statistical variance.   
 
Egypt’s imports also significantly increased, going from 36,879 kg in 2015 to 326,441 kg in 
2016; an 887.02 percent increase.  In the case of Egypt, similar to reports involving other 
countries, this one-year increase could be attributed to market fluctuations involving legitimate 
trade.  Additional annual reporting will be required to determine whether this data points to a 
genuine trend in sales or represents a temporary statistical variance.  Republic of Korea has 
slightly increased its imports, going from 56,945 in 2015 to 65,503 in 2016; a 15 percent 
increase.  Switzerland appears fifth in 2016, with imports decreasing 17.2 percent between 2015 
and 2016.  Republic of Korea, Egypt, Indonesia, Singapore, and Canada were the top-five 
ephedrine importers in 2015.   
  
According to the most current information provided by DEA, U.S. ephedrine imports increased 
from 3,093 kg in 2015 to 3,494 kg in 2016, a 12.96 percent increase.

Analysis of Import Data:  The quantity of pseudoephedrine imported by the top-five importers 
substantially increased in 2016.  The aggregated amount of pseudoephedrine imported by the 
top-five economies in 2016 was 1,578,319 kg; a 613.2 percent increase compared to 2015.  
According to the GTA database, Greece has increased its pseudoephedrine imports between 
2015 and 2016.  In 2014, Greece imported 2,702 kg of pseudoephedrine, followed by a 
substantial increase of 48,750 kg in 2015.  However, Greece imported 1,409,807 kg of 
pseudoephedrine in 2016; a 2,792 percent increase.  According to the GTA database, Greece 
imported the same amounts of ephedrine and pseudoephedrine, respectively, in 2015 and 2016.  
As explained in the analysis of the top-five ephedrine importers above, historically, similar

The top-five pseudoephedrine importers in 2016 were Greece, Switzerland, Indonesia, Turkey, 
and Republic of Korea.  Except for Switzerland and Indonesia, all other top-five importing 
economies increased their pseudoephedrine imports.  The 2015 list included Switzerland, 
Singapore, Indonesia, Greece, and France.   
  
According to the most current information provided by DEA, U.S. imports increased from 
153,959 kg in 2015 to 173,752 kg in 2016, a 12.85 percent increase.  It should be noted that 
pseudoephedrine is no longer manufactured in bulk within the United States.

Afghanistan 
 
A.  Introduction 
 
Afghanistan remains the dominant source of the world’s illicit opiate supply.  The insurgency 
and widespread corruption present major challenges to the central government’s efforts to 
establish the physical and economic security necessary to bring the narcotics trade under 
control.  The United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime (UNODC) and the Afghan Ministry of 
Counter Narcotics (MCN) estimate the total area under opium poppy cultivation in Afghanistan 
for the 2017 season to be approximately 328,304 hectares (ha), yielding an estimated 9,000 
metric tons (MT) of raw opium.  This represents an increase of 63 percent in area under 
cultivation and 88 percent in production over last year.  Preliminary U.S. government data show 
a similar trend.  Afghan opium is typically refined into heroin or morphine in Afghanistan and 
neighboring countries for export. 
 
A symbiotic relationship exists between the insurgency and illicit drug trafficking. Traffickers 
provide weapons, funding, and material support to the insurgency in exchange for protection.  
Some insurgents traffic drugs or tax their production and transportation to finance their 
operations.  However, trafficking is not limited to insurgent-controlled areas, and the narcotics 
trade is a primary driver of corruption, which undermines governance and rule of law throughout 
Afghanistan.  
 
Afghanistan suffers from widespread illicit drug use.  The U.S.-supported 2015 Afghanistan 
National Drug Use Survey profiling urban, rural, and national drug use conservatively estimated 
that roughly 11 percent of the population tested positive for one or more illicit drugs, including 
5.3 percent of the urban population and 13 percent of the rural population.  Drug use by women 
and children is among the highest documented worldwide, and 30.6 percent of rural households 
tested positive for some form of illicit drug.  These statistics portend a massive health crisis that 
Afghans are gradually acknowledging.  
 
Senior Afghan government officials state that the government recognizes the deleterious impact 
of illegal drugs and is attempting to address the problem, citing the late 2015 adoption of the 
National Drug Action Plan (NDAP) as proof.  Despite public displays of support for this 
comprehensive national drug control strategy, the Afghan government has been slow to 
implement the ambitious plan.  The Afghan government will require financial and technical 
assistance from the international community for the foreseeable future to achieve the NDAP’s 
objectives.  
 
B.  Drug Control Accomplishments, Policies, and Trends 
 
1. Institutional Development 
 
The Afghan government is publicly committed to confronting the drug problem in Afghanistan, 
focusing particularly on what it identifies as the underlying root causes of the drug economy, 
including instability, poverty, organized crime, and lack of economic opportunity.  MCN is the 
lead agency for developing counter-drug policy and coordinating related government activities.  


INCSR 2018 Volume 1  
 
 
 
 
Country Reports 
93 
 
As part of President Ashraf Ghani’s reform agenda, the Afghan Government of National Unity 
(GNU) has pledged “to intensify efforts to control narcotic production and sale.”  MCN is also 
working to “mainstream” drug control into the activities of the entire government.  Enlisting the 
support of other ministries for drug control requires top-level Afghan government support, which 
has been historically lacking.  
 
To combat drug trafficking, the Afghan government, with assistance from the United States and 
other donors, operates the Criminal Justice Task Force (CJTF), a self-contained judicial unit 
established under the 2010 Counternarcotics Law housed at the Counternarcotics Justice Center 
(CNJC).  CNJC also houses the Counternarcotics Tribunal and a detention center.  It serves as 
the central facility for the investigation, prosecution, and trial of major drug and drug-related 
corruption cases.  From December 22, 2016, through September 22, 2017, the CNJC processed 
267 cases involving 351 suspects.  As a result of these cases, 1.6 MT of heroin were confiscated, 
along with 28.5 MT of raw opium, 18.4 MT of morphine, and 213.6 MT of hashish. 
 
The United States and Afghanistan have neither a bilateral extradition treaty nor a mutual legal 
assistance treaty in force, but they do cooperate on investigations on a case-by-case basis.  
Afghanistan is a party to relevant multilateral law enforcement conventions that have mutual 
legal assistance provisions. 
 
Afghanistan’s new penal code authorizes confiscating assets (including land, structures, and 
vehicles) used in, or earned through, illicit drug production and trafficking.  Once the new penal 
code goes into effect on February 15, 2018, it is hoped that enforcement of this law may dissuade 
landowners from supporting the cultivation of poppy or other illicit crops.   
 
 
2.  Supply Reduction 
 
According to the 2017 Afghanistan Opium Survey – jointly produced by UNODC and MCN – 
Afghanistan cultivated 328,304 ha of poppy in 2017, a 63 percent increase from 2016.  Afghan 
poppy crops yielded an estimated potential 9,000 MT of raw opium, up 88 percent from 2016.  
Helmand, Kandahar, and Badghis provinces accounted for 60 percent of the cultivation.  The 
2017 poppy cultivation figure for Helmand was 144,000 ha, which was the highest of any 
province and 44 percent of the 2017 country total.  U.S. government estimates for 2017 
Afghanistan opium production were not available for this report, but preliminary analysis shows 
a similar trend.  Aside from opium, Afghanistan cultivates cannabis and produces significant 
amounts of hashish.  The latest available cannabis survey (2012) estimates that 10,000 ha of 
commercial cannabis cultivation is sufficient to potentially produce approximately 1,400 MT of 
hashish. 
  
Poppy eradication increased in 2017, destroying 750 ha of opium poppy fields, compared to 355 
ha in 2016.  Nevertheless, this amount remained well short of eradication totals in 2015 (3,760 
ha), 2014 (2,692 ha), and 2013 (7,348 ha).  The majority of 2017 eradication took place in 
Badakhshan and Nangarhar provinces (269 and 204 ha, respectively).  Fourteen provinces 
conducted eradication in 2017, compared to only seven provinces in 2016.  Deteriorating 
security conditions, a lack of political will, and MCN’s ineffective management of the Afghan 
inter-ministerial process all contributed to anemic eradication efforts in 2017.  The United States 


INCSR 2018 Volume 1  
 
 
 
 
Country Reports

supports the GNU-led eradication efforts through the Governor-Led Eradication (GLE) program 
that reimburses provincial governors $250 per every UNODC-verified hectare of eradicated 
poppy. 
   
The Counter Narcotics Police of Afghanistan (CNPA) are increasingly able to plan and conduct 
effective counternarcotics operations.  The United States supports specialized units within the 
CNP, including the Sensitive Investigative Unit (SIU) and the National Interdiction Unit (NIU).  
These units are mentored by the U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration and U.S. Special 
Operations Forces, a relationship that has increased access to key military enablers and has led to 
record seizures.  During the first nine months of 2017, the NIU and the SIU conducted 84 joint 
operations and reported the seizure of drugs and chemicals worth more than $300 million, 
including 16.8 MT of opium, 5.4 MT of heroin, 132 MT of hashish, and 37.5 MT of morphine 
base.  In addition, the arrest of 118 individuals during this period included three leaders 
identified as “top 20” targets by the Afghan government.    
 
Primary trafficking routes into and out of Afghanistan are through the Balkan route (Iran to 
Turkey to Eastern and Western Europe); the southern route (Pakistan and Iran to Africa, Europe, 
Asia, the Middle East, and Canada); and through the northern route (Central Asia to the Russian 
Federation).  Drug laboratories within Afghanistan and in neighboring countries process a large 
portion of the country’s raw opium into heroin and morphine, illicitly importing large quantities 
of precursor chemicals to facilitate production.  These laboratories and chemicals were targeted 
in NIU operations, resulting in the destruction of over 105 laboratories and the reported seizure 
of nearly 28,000 liters of acetic anhydride within Afghanistan during the first nine months of 
2017.  Additionally, the U.S. Air Force and Afghan Air Force fighter aircraft targeted Taliban-
associated drug labs with air strikes.   
 
 
3.  Public Information, Prevention, and Treatment 
 
The Afghan government acknowledges that Afghanistan has one of the highest substance abuse 
rates in the world.  The 2015 Afghanistan National Drug Use Survey identified that rural drug 
use is far higher than urban use, and more than 30 percent of rural Afghan households included 
at least one member who tested positive for some form of illicit drug.  To stem the effects of this 
public health crisis, the United States funded a new rural treatment pilot project in 2017 to 
expand substance abuse treatment to the hardest hit local communities, in addition to continuing 
to support 86 drug treatment centers across the country in conjunction with the Ministry of 
Public Health.  The demand for treatment and prevention services far exceeds the capacity of the 
centers, most of which have extensive waiting lists for new patients.  The United States also 
supports UNODC’s global child addiction program to develop protocols for treating opioid-
addicted children, training treatment staff, and delivering services through non-governmental 
organizations.  
 
The United States engages in robust public information programming through the Counter 
Narcotics Community Engagement program, which funds communication and outreach 
programs aimed at discouraging poppy cultivation, preventing drug use, and encouraging licit 
crop cultivation.  The United States also supports an anti-drug curriculum in Afghan schools, 
which has trained more than 1,900 teachers and reached more than 600,000 students in 900

Country Reports 
95 
 
schools.  Surveys indicate that the public messaging campaigns are having an increasing impact 
on Afghan attitudes about illicit drugs.    
 
 
4.  Corruption 
 
As a policy matter, the Government of Afghanistan does not encourage or facilitate illicit drug 
production or distribution, nor is it involved in laundering illicit proceeds.  However, 
widespread, longstanding, and credible allegations and media reporting suggest that many 
government officials directly engage in and benefit from the drug trade.  Corrupt practices range 
from facilitating drug activities to benefiting from drug trade revenue streams to thwarting 
arrests and prosecutions.  
 
C.  National Goals, Bilateral Cooperation, and U.S. Policy Initiatives 
 
In October, 2015, President Ghani approved a new four-year National Drug Action Plan 
(NDAP), establishing three interrelated goals:  1) decrease the cultivation of opium poppy; 2) 
decrease the production and trafficking of opiates; and 3) reduce the demand for illicit drugs, 
while increasing the provision of treatment for users.  The NDAP targets all facets of the drug 
trade, from cultivation and production to trafficking and use, by employing incentives such as 
alternative development and deterrents such as eradication, interdiction, and prosecution.  The 
U.S. government’s drug control priorities for Afghanistan include disrupting the drug trade, 
developing licit alternative livelihoods, strengthening law enforcement and eradication efforts, 
reducing the demand for drugs, and building the Afghan government’s drug control capacity.  
 
More broadly, the United States seeks to restore Afghanistan’s agriculture economy, to 
strengthen its institutional capacity, and to disrupt the nexus of drugs, insurgents, and corruption.  
Agriculture accounts for one quarter of Afghanistan’s gross domestic product and employs 
approximately 40 percent of its workforce, so a key challenge to reducing drug production is 
developing economically viable alternatives to poppy and sustained workforce employment.  The 
United States, in coordination with our Afghan and international partners, promotes licit crop 
production where poppy is cultivated and funds projects designed to support farmers and agri-
businesses in targeted value chains, including wheat, livestock, and high-value horticulture.  
 
The United States is currently implementing alternative development initiatives, within the 
framework of the Afghanistan Integrated Country Strategy, to reduce illicit drug production and 
promote sustainable agriculture-led economic growth.  The Boost Alternative Development 
Interventions through Licit Livelihoods (BADILL) project, implemented by UNODC, aims to 
strengthen and diversify licit livelihoods of small and marginal farmers through alternative 
development methods in 13 target provinces.  The Community-Based Agriculture and Rural 
Development projects implemented by the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) 
work to improve household income while reducing dependency on illicit poppy cultivation for 
selected communities in six high-poppy cultivating districts in Badghis and Farah provinces.  
The projects will also develop and strengthen community-based agri-business infrastructure, 
such as irrigation, transportation, and storage facilities.

Illicit cultivation, production, trade, and use of narcotics undermine public health and good 
governance in Afghanistan, while fueling corruption, providing significant funding for 
insurgents, and eroding security.  Opium poppy cultivation is most prevalent where physical and 
economic infrastructure is least developed, and where the Afghan government lacks control.   
Afghanistan will not succeed in combating the illicit drug trade until Afghans view illicit drugs 
as a domestic problem.  That comprehension is slowly building, but will remain incomplete until 
the Afghan government demonstrates the political will to challenge vested political and 
economic interests more fully.  
 
The Afghan government must demonstrate the necessary political will and capacity to combat 
corruption, develop alternative economic livelihoods, and establish security in the poppy 
cultivating communities controlled by insurgent forces.  Afghanistan cannot interdict or eradicate 
itself out of this problem.  However, increased efforts to enforce Afghan laws against illicit 
poppy cultivation and to arrest traffickers are necessary for success, alongside alternative 
development and reducing demand for illicit drugs.  In addition to mainstreaming drug control 
efforts into other existing national strategies and programs, Afghanistan must actively combat 
corruption at all levels of government to regain public trust in its counter-drug campaigns, and 
ensure that provincial governors and other subnational officials genuinely cooperate on national 
drug control plans and policies.  None of these achievements would be sufficient by itself, and 
each faces significant challenges in the coming years.  Success in countering Afghanistan’s place 
in the global drug trade will not come quickly or easily.

Albania 
 
A.  Introduction 
  
Albania remains a transit country for drug trafficking and a significant source of cannabis grown 
mainly in the remote mountain areas of the country.  The number of drug seizures and arrests has 
increased dramatically within the country over the last few years, driven principally by increased 
enforcement efforts attributable to international pressure and Albania’s endeavor to accede to the 
European Union (EU).  Doubts persist, however, regarding the government’s enduring 
commitment to aggressive enforcement.  Recent constitutional and legislative reforms to the 
country’s justice institutions are encouraging, and further implementation of these reforms will 
be necessary to address corruption, its linkages to illicit drug production, and organized crime 
more broadly. 
 
B.  Drug Control Accomplishments, Policies, and Trends  
  
 
1.  Institutional Development 
  
Albania is undertaking major constitutional and legislative reforms to improve the justice 
system, particularly through reducing corruption and links between organized crime and public 
officials.  This effort included amending one-third of its constitution and passing more than 15 
major laws.  As a result of these reforms, Albania’s 2016 Constitution now includes a mandate to 
vet judges and prosecutors for corrupt wealth and ties to organized crime.  It also envisions 
Europe’s only constitutional anti-corruption and anti-organized crime prosecution office with its 
own investigators.  
 
Albania and the United States are parties to a 1933 extradition treaty, and in 2017, completed 
negotiations on a draft, modern extradition treaty that requires ratification.  Albania and the 
United States have enjoyed a cooperative relationship for extraditions and requests for mutual 
legal assistance, and the Albanian government is generally eager to cooperate with the United 
States in criminal matters.   
 
Albania is a candidate country for the European Union and a member of the Council of Europe.  
It is a party to the European Convention on Mutual Assistance in Criminal Matters. 
  
 
2.  Supply Reduction 
  
Cannabis continues to be cultivated within Albania, though Albanian authorities reported a 
marked decrease in cultivation in 2017.  Drug arrests and seizures were up significantly.  
Albanian authorities continued regional cooperation with Italian Police surveillance units, and 
drug surveillance flights increased from the previous year.  With the exception of cannabis, 
Albania is not a significant producer of illicit drugs, precursor chemicals, or synthetic drugs.  The 
Government of Albania does not maintain drug-use prevalence statistics.  Except for marijuana, 
illicit drug use does not appear to be common. 
 


INCSR 2018 Volume 1  
 
 
 
 
Country Reports 
98 
 
According to Albanian State Police (ASP), a total of 88.57 metric tons (MT) of marijuana were 
seized during the first 10 months of 2017, nearly three times as much as was seized during all of 
2016, and a total of 208,308 cannabis plants were eradicated –a more than ten-fold reduction 
from the number of plants destroyed in 2016.  Italian Guardia di Finanza surveillance flights 
identified far fewer suspected cannabis plantations and estimated that cultivation declined overall 
within the country by 95 percent from the previous year.  The ASP also seized 49.96 kilograms 
(kg) of heroin and 4.2 kg of cocaine. 
 
The ASP, including border police, arrested 1,500 people for offenses linked to drug trafficking 
during the first 10 months of 2017, surpassing the total number of arrests (1,349) made over the 
entirety of 2016.  The Serious Crimes Prosecutors Office (SCPO) investigated 273 criminal 
proceedings for illicit drug trafficking.  Of this total, 115 investigations were carried over from 
previous years.  In 2016, the SCPO sent 55 cases to court against 81 defendants.  The Serious 
Crimes Court rendered 65 guilty verdicts, to include verdicts in cases already pending in 2016. 
  
 
3.  Public Information, Prevention, and Treatment 
  
The Ministry of Health has declared that drug use is on the rise in Albania, but has no reliable 
data to substantiate the claims.  In 2018, the United States plans to work with Community Anti-
Drug Coalitions (CADCA) to launch drug demand reduction programming throughout Albania.  
The project will build a cross-community effort to reduce drug use by engaging schools, law 
enforcement, businesses, and health providers.   
  
 
4.  Corruption 
  
Albania is undertaking major constitutional and legislative reforms with an eye towards 
improving the justice system, particularly reducing corruption and organized crime ties.  While 
the Government of Albania does not, as a matter of government policy, encourage or facilitate 
illicit drug production or distribution, corruption and the influence of organized crime has been a 
considerable problem in Albania since the fall of communism in the early 1990s.  While there 
are consistent arrests and prosecutions for those participating in drug trafficking, there have been 
few prosecutions of those who manage or organize the trafficking or who benefit politically or 
financially from the support of organized crime figures.   
 
Judicial corruption in particular has remained high.  Despite an annual judicial salary equal to 
less than 10,000 euros per year, Albania’s Asset Declaration Agency found in 2015 that 35 
percent of judges declared over 250,000 euros of assets while some declared millions. 
 
Despite frequent, public, and, in many cases, credible accusations of corruption and criminal 
activity against high-level officials across the political spectrum, the Albanian justice system has 
few successful prosecutions or convictions of high-level corruption.  In 2017, Supreme Court 
Justice Majlinda Andrea, her husband and two others were convicted of accepting a 50,000 euro 
bribe in a land dispute.

The United States provides assistance to the Government of Albania to reform its ineffective and 
corruption-ridden legal system and strengthen law enforcement capabilities.  U.S. assistance 
focuses on supporting the implementation of Albania’s Anti-Corruption Prosecution Office 
(SPAK), directed toward tackling high-level corruption and organized crime, and the 
implementation of constitutional judicial reform.  U.S. assistance is also helping Albanian 
authorities to establish a new National Bureau of Investigation, tasked with investigating high-
level corruption and organized crime.  U.S. assistance continues to support gender integration 
within the State Police.  There was a noticeable increase in EU law enforcement engagement in 
Albania in 2017 regarding criminal threats posed by Albanian nationals within certain EU 
member states.  U.S. law enforcement authorities continue to work closely with Albanian and 
EU counterparts to address transnational criminal activity within the Albanian diaspora.  
 
D.  Conclusion 
  
Albania continues to receive assistance from the United States and European Union countries to 
enhance its drug enforcement capacities.  The Albanian government implemented 46 joint 
operations with international law enforcement agencies during the first 10 months of 2017, 
mostly in cooperation with Italian authorities. The United States continues to provide assistance 
to support integrated border management utilizing risk analysis to identify potential traffickers, 
as well as training on drug trafficking investigations and to promote judicial sector reform.  It 
will be critical for the Albanian government to take further steps to implement the country’s 
recent criminal justice sector reforms vigorously in the years to come to erode the influence of 
organized crime and strengthen the rule of law.

Algeria 
 
Algeria is a transit country for drug trafficking from other parts of Africa to Europe and the 
Middle East, and Algerian officials assert that some transit operations are connected to terrorist 
financing in the region.  Algeria also has a growing domestic market for illicit drugs, particularly 
of cannabis use among youth.  According to Algerian media reports, police reportedly seized 
more than 38 metric tons of cannabis during the first eight months of 2017.  Authorities seized 
approximately 80 percent of these drugs in the western region of the country, according to 
Algerian officials.  Media reports also claimed that 985 grams of heroin and nearly four 
kilograms of cocaine were seized during this same eight-month period, along with 745,996 
psychotropic pills, amounts that are all slightly below what was seized during the same eight-
month period in 2016.   
 
Algeria’s vast borders make drug-smuggling difficult to monitor and control.  Algerian officials 
assert that Morocco is the principal source of illicit drugs found in Algeria.  Algerian officials 
have also identified the smuggling of illicit substances hidden among licit pharmaceuticals as a 
potential problem.  According to media reports, Algeria is working with the United Nations 
Office on Drugs and Crime to improve its Customs officers’ capacity to recognize new drugs in 
circulation, and to better screen material entering through ports and airports.  The Ministry of 
Justice claimed that the success of law enforcement and security forces in increasing land border 
security in 2017 pushed some drug trafficking to maritime routes from Morocco to Algeria.  The 
Algerian Coast Guard and the National Gendarmerie reported increased drug seizures in 
Algerian waters.   
 
The Algerian government has updated its drug-control regulations pertaining to the incineration 
of seized narcotics and controls over the legal production and storage of controlled 
pharmaceutical drugs containing opiates and psychotropic substances, among other issues, to 
remain in accordance with its international drug control agreements.  Algeria is a member of the 
Euro-Mediterranean cooperation network MedNET, created in 2006 to expand cooperation 
among countries including France, Egypt, Italy, Lebanon, Morocco, Portugal, and Tunisia in the 
fight against illicit drugs.   
 
The Algerian government works to prevent illicit drug use through domestic social programs.  
Algeria has invested in public awareness programs and treatment facilities to educate the public 
and treat drug users.   
 
The United States sponsored an airport interdiction training class for Algerian security and 
customs officials and eight Tunisian police officers at an Algerian police training facility in April 
2017.  The training aimed to build participants’ capacity to interdict bulk currency and narcotics 
passing through passenger or cargo screening. 
 
There is a new mutual legal assistance treaty with Algeria that entered into force on April 20, 
2017.  No requests have yet been made under this treaty.  The United States does not have an 
extradition treaty with Algeria.

Argentina 
 
Transnational criminal organizations primarily utilize Argentina and its transportation 
infrastructure to traffic cocaine produced in Andean countries to European markets.  Domestic 
cocaine processing and consumption are growing concerns, and the consumption of “paco,” a 
domestically produced cocaine base, is a particular problem in poorer neighborhoods.   
 
U.S.-Argentine law enforcement cooperation has strengthened significantly under President 
Mauricio Macri’s administration, and the Ministry of Security has begun to adopt a number of 
best practices from U.S. law enforcement models, such as encouraging coordination between 
federal and provincial forces to gather criminal intelligence and increasing investigative 
collaboration through interagency law enforcement task forces.  One such task force began 
functioning in late 2016 in the northwestern Argentine province of Salta, which borders Bolivia 
and Chile, and is a key entry point for cocaine originating from Bolivia or Peru.   
 
In 2016, the Argentine government unveiled a new national program to combat drug trafficking 
that proposed harsher sentences for traffickers, increased deployment of federal law enforcement 
forces to target drug trafficking organizations, and efforts to reduce the consumption of  paco.  In 
response to increased public safety concerns about rising street-level crime, the government 
deployed federal forces into Buenos Aires and other major urban centers to support crime control 
efforts.  While the deployments have strengthened enforcement efforts in major cities, it has 
reduced available resources for combating drug trafficking along key smuggling corridors, 
including at the country’s borders. 
 
Seizures of small cocaine conversion laboratories within the country and the widespread 
availability of paco suggest domestic processing is growing.  In 2017, the Macri administration 
commenced publishing annual seizure statistics after a seven-year hiatus under the previous 
government.  Official statistics indicate seizures of cocaine, marijuana, and synthetic drugs all 
increased from 2015 to 2016.  The Argentine government does not encourage or facilitate the 
illicit production or distribution of narcotics or laundering of proceeds.  The judiciary and the 
press pursue allegations of corrupt practices involving government authorities.  
 
Argentina has adopted legal and procedural reforms that could improve its ability to target and 
prosecute drug trafficking and other criminal organizations.  These reforms include limited use 
of informants and undercover officers in investigations and, more recently, the ability of criminal 
defendants to cooperate in investigations and prosecutions in exchange for a reduced sentence.  
Argentina is in the nascent stages of transitioning from the inquisitorial system to the 
accusatorial system.  Use of aforementioned tools remained limited because investigators, 
prosecutors, and judges are unaccustomed to them.  However, the government is actively 
planning training on use of these methods.    
 
Constructive measures Argentina could undertake include increasing resources for border 
security and interagency law enforcement task forces; focusing interdiction efforts on targeted 
investigations; improving coordination among federal and provincial entities; boosting judicial 
efficiency in processing investigations and prosecutions; educating investigative and judicial

authorities on the benefits of legal and procedural reforms; continuing to make comprehensive 
statistics available; and coordinating strategies for supply and demand reduction. 
 
Argentina has extradition and mutual legal assistance treaties with the United States, which are 
utilized to the benefit of both countries.

Armenia 
 
Armenia is a transit route for illicit drugs originating in Southwest Asia and trafficked to markets 
in Europe and Russia.  Illicit opiates and amphetamine-type stimulants are smuggled into 
Armenia by land over the country’s border with Iran and through aerial transshipment.  Though 
the Armenian government maintains authority over the country’s law enforcement and criminal 
justice institutions, the Russian Federation is responsible for border security along Armenia’s 
land borders with Turkey and Iran, and also provides some border control staff at the 
international airports in Yerevan and Gyumri.   
 
Armenian authorities have taken limited action against organized crime, and official corruption 
remains an enduring problem.  Several investigations in 2017 resulted in arrests of Armenian 
justice sector and border control officials and illustrated that state institutions remain vulnerable 
to corruption by organized crime.  Authorities typically arrest only the operators of vehicles 
carrying illicit drugs without further inquiry into trafficking networks or investigating potential 
links to organized crime.  Accordingly, Armenia’s relatively low numbers of drug seizures and 
prosecutions may indicate evidence of official corruption and may not accurately reflect the 
actual volume of drugs transiting the country.  
 
During the first six months of 2017, 218 people were arrested for drug crimes, and 28.5 
kilograms (kg) of illegal drugs and 1.6 kg of precursor chemicals were seized.  These seizure 
totals more than doubled the amount seized over the same period in 2016.   
 
Among notable seizures in 2017, in July, 105 kg of heroin were seized along the Iranian border 
from a rented Georgian truck entering Armenia.  One Turkish citizen was arrested.  According to 
the Armenian police, there is evidence of increased trafficking of illicit and controlled substances 
into Armenia by mail parcels.  In 2017, parcels containing marijuana, methamphetamine, 
MDMA (ecstasy), and controlled pharmaceutical drugs were intercepted entering Armenia from 
various countries, including Russia, the United States, and countries in Europe.

Azerbaijan 
 
Situated along traditional Southern Caucasus smuggling routes, Azerbaijan remains a transit 
country for illicit drugs trafficked from Southwest Asia to markets in Russia and Europe.  
Opiates originating from Afghanistan (primarily heroin), psychotropic substances, and precursor 
chemicals are trafficked through the country, entering Azerbaijan both by sea (primarily from 
Turkmenistan) and by land (from Iran). 
 
Azerbaijan’s interdiction capacity along its land border with Iran is undermined by the continued 
occupation by ethnic Armenian forces of Nagorno-Karabakh and surrounding Azerbaijani 
territories.  In addition to expressing concern over its inability to secure its international borders 
due to the long-standing conflict, the Government of Azerbaijan has asserted that the occupied 
territories host illegal drug cultivation sites. 
 
Azerbaijan’s Ministry of Internal Affairs provided drug seizure and arrest statistics covering the 
first nine months of 2017.  During this period, the Ministry of Internal Affairs reported 
investigations of 2,373 drug-related criminal acts, including 678 separate sales of illicit drugs.  
These investigations resulted in 1,955 convictions.  Of these convictions, 1,726 defendants (89 
percent) were unemployed and not enrolled in any educational institution.  Recidivists accounted 
for 764 (39 percent) of the convictions, and 29 convictions (two percent) involved women.  
During this nine-month period, Azerbaijani security services reportedly detected and destroyed 
approximately 173.4 metric tons of hemp and opium poppy.  During the same period, security 
services reportedly also seized 180 kilograms (kg) of heroin and 174 kg of opium.  Heroin 
seizures were down significantly from 2016, when approximately 1.17 MT were seized over the 
first 10 months of the year. 
 
During 2017, the United States funded projects to strengthen Azerbaijani border security to 
reduce transnational crime.  Azerbaijani law enforcement agencies cooperate and implement 
joint activities with the U.N. Office on Drugs and Crime, Central Asia Regional Information and 
Coordination Center, and World Customs Organization, among others.

The Bahamas 
 
A.  Introduction 
 
The Bahamas is not a significant drug producing country, but remains a transit point for illegal drugs 
bound for the United States and other international markets.  The close proximity of The Bahamas to the 
coast of Florida, as well as its location on Caribbean transshipment routes, makes it a natural conduit for 
drug smuggling.  The 700 islands and cays of The Bahamas, the vast majority of which are uninhabited, 
provide near-ideal conditions for smuggling.  Additionally, The Bahamas boasts 10 international airports, 
56 airstrips, and more than 80 marinas.  Smugglers readily blend in among numerous pleasure craft 
traveling throughout the Bahamian archipelago, which covers a nautical area the size of California (nearly 
100,000 square miles).  Smuggling also occurs through commercial and private plane traffic, often on the 
remote airfields and through airdrops from South and Central America.  Smuggling enables and 
strengthens organized crime syndicates and gang activity. 
 
The United States and The Bahamas enjoy a long-standing history of drug control cooperation under 
Operation Bahamas, Turks and Caicos (OPBAT), a tripartite agreement dating back to the 1980s.  In 
2017, OPBAT operations resulted in significant seizures of cocaine and marijuana, as well as the 
destruction of cannabis plants on multiple sparsely-populated islands.   
 
A recent Organization of American States’ Inter-American Drug Abuse Control Commission 
(OAS/CICAD) survey on household use of drugs suggests that demand for cocaine within the country 
continues to decline, though a small domestic market exists.  Marijuana use, particularly among men, 
remains steady at approximately 15 percent of respondents.  Experimental and chronic use of marijuana, 
including among adolescents, remains a concern.  The Bahamas’ National Anti-Drug Strategy places 
significant emphasis on drug abuse awareness, demand reduction, and treatment policies. 
 
B.  Drug Control Accomplishments, Policies, and Trends 
 
 
1.  Institutional Development 
 
Bahamian government and law enforcement authorities are committed to combating illicit drug 
trafficking, and the United States and The Bahamas enjoy strong cooperation on drug control issues.  
Newly elected in May 2017, the Free National Movement Party has prioritized tackling illegal trafficking 
of drugs, people, and weapons; addressing public corruption; and reducing levels of violent crime.  The 
new government has increased cooperation and information sharing between Bahamian and U.S. law 
enforcement agencies, which had waned under the previous government. 
 
While the new government is still developing its agenda, the “Swift Justice Program” to reduce 
processing time for legal matters continued implementation in 2017.  During the year, the Supreme Court 
assigned defense attorneys from the new Office of the Public Defender to represent defendants who could 
not afford private representation.  The government worked closely with the United States on plans to 
install digital audio recording equipment in the Magistrate and Supreme Court courtrooms, which should 
further reduce case processing times.  Full implementation of the Swift Justice Program will improve the 
Bahamian judiciary’s capacity to process drug crimes and address the multi-year case backlog. 
 
The United States signed a comprehensive maritime agreement with The Bahamas in 2004 that continues 
to enable cooperation in drug enforcement and migrant interdiction operations in and around Bahamian 
territorial waters.  The United States and The Bahamas are bilateral parties to both a mutual legal 


INCSR 2018 Volume 1  
 
 
 
 
Country Reports 
106 
 
assistance treaty and an extradition treaty.  The United States and The Bahamas have a strong mutual 
legal assistance relationship, though extradition from the Bahamas often remains a slow process. 
 
 
2.  Supply Reduction 
 
Under OPBAT, U.S. law enforcement agencies integrate with the Royal Bahamas Police Force (RBPF) to 
gather intelligence, conduct investigations, and execute interdictions.  These operations are supported by 
marine, technical, and training resources provided through U.S. assistance programs.  With a small 
population base (353,000 according to the 2010 census) and significant territory to cover, pooling U.S. 
and local Bahamian resources and knowledge are essential to efficient deterrence and interdiction.  The 
Royal Bahamas Defence Force (RBDF) and law enforcement personnel in the Turks and Caicos Islands 
also participate in drug enforcement operations. 
 
Between January 1 and October 25, OPBAT operations in The Bahamas led to 60 arrests and the seizure 
of approximately 772 kilograms of cocaine, 8.32 metric tons of marijuana, $410,219 in currency, and 
other assets valued at $935,500.  OPBAT identified and eradicated one marijuana field and 1,501 
marijuana plants.  U.S. and local law enforcement investigations indicate that illicit trafficking through 
The Bahamas remains high.  The total number of OPBAT operations dropped off significantly from the 
previous year due to a staff reduction in the local country office of the U.S. Drug Enforcement 
Administration (DEA) and the cessation in operations during and after Hurricanes Irma and Maria.  
Operations were suspended from September 6 through October 23, as OPBAT assets were re-directed to 
Puerto Rico and other areas as part of the recovery operation for Hurricane Maria.   
 
Smugglers exploit the wide distribution of numerous islands and the high number of recreational vessels 
flowing through The Bahamas.  Large loads are split up into smaller loads before entering the southern 
Bahamas, sometimes bypassing the customs station in Great Inagua, strategically located between the 
Turks and Caicos Islands, Haiti, the Dominican Republic, and Jamaica.  Traffickers move cocaine 
through The Bahamas via “go-fast” boats, small commercial freighters, maritime shipping containers, and 
small aircraft.  Small sport fishing vessels and pleasure craft also move cocaine from The Bahamas to 
Florida by blending in with legitimate traffic that transits these areas.  Larger “go-fast” and sport fishing 
vessels transport marijuana from Jamaica both to The Bahamas and through The Bahamas into Florida.  
Haitian and Haitian-Bahamian drug trafficking organizations, networked between Haiti and the 
significant Haitian diaspora in The Bahamas, continue to play a role in the movement of cocaine.   
 
Investigations reveal Bahamian drug trafficking organizations use the Turks and Caicos Islands as a 
transshipment point.  Strong familial connections between the Turks and Caicos Islands and The 
Bahamas, coupled with direct flights between Haiti and the Turks and Caicos Islands, result in many 
Bahamian smugglers traveling to Haiti via the Turks and Caicos Islands with large amounts of cash for 
future smuggling ventures.   
 
Aerial drug transshipment remains a cause for concern.  Small, privately owned and operated planes carry 
loads of cocaine from and between significant source countries in South America into the Caribbean.  
Law enforcement information suggests that drug trafficking organizations utilize airdrops and remote 
airfields to deliver cocaine shipments to the Turks and Caicos Islands and to The Bahamas from 
Venezuela and Colombia. 
 
U.S. Customs and Border Protection officers working at preclearance facilities at the Nassau and Freeport 
international airports have interdicted cocaine, marijuana, steroids, and currency.  To attract tourism from 
its Spanish-speaking neighbors, The Bahamas concluded an agreement in 2011 to allow Panama-based 
Copa Airlines to begin flights between Nassau and Panama.  The four flights a week remain a 
transshipment route for contraband smuggling. 


INCSR 2018 Volume 1

Bahamian law enforcement agencies leverage their small fleet of vessels by prepositioning them in 
strategic locations on the archipelago.  Effective use of this limited number of vessels over a vast area of 
coverage depends on effective use of quality intelligence and aviation support during critical interdiction 
missions.  The RBDF operates a fleet of nine offshore patrol vessels, 11 coastal patrol vessels, and 
various small boats which conduct regular patrols. 
 
 
3.  Public Information, Prevention, and Treatment 
 
With U.S. support, the Bahamian government partnered with the Organization of American States to 
conduct a comprehensive drug use survey in 2017.  According to the survey respondents, 20 percent of 
male and seven percent of female respondents admitted to smoking marijuana.  Of the respondents who 
admitted to smoking, 40 percent admitted to smoking on a daily basis.  Only one percent of respondents 
admitted to cocaine usage.  Over 40 percent claimed to know a friend or family member who takes illicit 
drugs, with most reporting knowing two or more people.   
 
Following the launch of the survey results, the National Anti- Drug Secretariat began a public information 
campaign, strategically placing billboards around New Providence Island where the problem is most 
concentrated.  The other main institutional bodies are the Bahamas National Drug Council and the 
Sandilands Rehabilitation Center. 
 
The Sandilands Rehabilitation Center offers residential substance abuse treatment programs, drop-in 
treatment programs, substance abuse prevention programs, and relapse prevention programs.  The United 
States partnered with the Sandilands Rehabilitation Center to train, mentor, and certify drug treatment 
professionals both from within and outside government.  Following the certification of its professionals, 
Sandilands and other partners developed a training program for other substance use treatment staff in the 
country to learn about substance use issues.  During 2017, Sandilands trained over 80 staff from local 
hospitals, the prison, the school for boys and girls, and local emergency rooms on New Providence Island 
and Grand Bahama Island.  
 
The Bahamas Department of Correctional Services has a small residential drug treatment program, which 
can accommodate up to 10 inmates at a time.  The United States has provided training for the corrections 
officers that provide drug treatment programs at the facility; several prison guards have also received 
additional training from Sandilands Rehabilitation Center.   
 
 
4.  Corruption 
 
The Government of the Commonwealth of The Bahamas does not, as a matter of government policy, 
encourage or facilitate illicit drug production or distribution, nor is it involved in laundering the proceeds 
of the sale of illicit drugs.  Further, the newly elected government has prioritized addressing public 
corruption as part of its national agenda.  During calendar year 2017, at least three prison officers were 
arrested and charged with possession with intent to supply.  These officials were investigated by the 
prison management in cooperation with the RBPF.   
 
C.  National Goals, Bilateral Cooperation, and U.S. Policy Initiatives 
 
The United States supports a wide range of efforts designed to address crime and violence affecting 
Bahamian citizens, primarily through the Caribbean Basin Security Initiative (CBSI).  CBSI, the security 
partnership between the United States and nations of the Caribbean, seeks to substantially reduce illicit 
trafficking, advance public safety and citizen security, and promote justice.  To support the development 
of regional public security capacities, the United States funds RBDF participation in U.S. maritime

exercises and training programs in maritime law enforcement, intelligence, small boat operations, port 
security, engineering, disaster relief, and maintenance.  Additionally, the United States provides 
equipment and training to the RBDF to enhance interoperability with U.S. forces, maritime domain 
awareness, and command and control.  Security cooperation activities are provided by U.S. Northern 
Command and its components; the U.S. Coast Guard (USCG); the Rhode Island National Guard via the 
State Partnership Program; and subject matter expert exchanges in conjunction with USCG cutter and 
U.S. Navy ship visits to The Bahamas. 
 
The United States delivered training, technical assistance, and equipment needed by Bahamian 
government counterparts to combat transnational organized crime networks and improve citizen security 
in The Bahamas.  In November 2017, the United States signed a contract to install digital recording 
equipment in the Magistrates and Supreme Court courtrooms in New Providence, Grand Bahama, and 
Abaco Islands.  This equipment will be used to record court proceedings in support of Bahamian plans to 
increase justice sector efficiency.  Additionally, the United States donated ballistics vests and protective 
gear to the RBPF’s Drug Enforcement Unit, Central Detective Unit, and Marine Support Services Unit, as 
well as the Customs Marine Unit, and provided new locks for the maximum security wing of the 
Bahamas Department of Corrections.  
 
The United States sponsored officials from the Bahamian police and justice sector to attend the U.S.-
supported International Law Enforcement Academy to receive training focused on money laundering and 
asset forfeiture; corruption and ethics; and international financial strategies.  The United States organized 
a workshop for judges and magistrates and court staff to prepare them for the administrational changes 
involved with the new digital audio recording equipment.  Additionally, a senior U.S. justice advisor 
provided technical assistance to the Ministries of National Security, Legal Affairs, and Finance to help 
establish practices to address issues with corruption.  The advisor provided guidance on draft legislation 
and established a program for increasing contact between these ministries and U.S. counterparts.  The 
United States also supported Bahamian participation in the International Drug Enforcement Conference 
(organized by DEA) and other regional counterdrug training opportunities. 
 
U.S. assistance for demand reduction supports the Ministry of National Security, the Sandilands 
Rehabilitation Center, and nongovernmental organizations.  Additionally, the United States supported 
training focused on drug demand reduction and improved corrections policies addressing drug use and 
demand within prisons. 
 
The Bahamas participated in the annual Multilateral Maritime Interdiction and Prosecution Summit held 
in July 2017, which attracted maritime counterdrug professionals from various central and eastern 
Caribbean nations.    
 
D.  Conclusion 
 
The United States and The Bahamas enjoy a long-standing cooperative relationship against drug 
trafficking and transnational organized crime.  Drug trafficking and related smuggling will remain a 
primary concern for the United States in The Bahamas.  The United States will continue to assist 
Bahamian efforts to counter these networks and increase efficiencies in the administration of justice 
through a range of assistance, and the CBSI framework will continue to bolster Bahamian drug-control 
institutions and enhance U.S. and Bahamian law enforcement relationships.

Belgium 
 
Belgium is a primary entry point for cocaine smuggled into Europe from source countries in 
South America.  The Port of Antwerp is particularly exploited by transnational drug trafficking 
organizations (some of which are also involved in trafficking to the United States) to reach the 
lucrative European drug market.  Smaller volumes of cocaine and other illicit drugs also enter 
and exit the country through human couriers at the country’s airports.  
 
During the first nine months of 2017, Belgian authorities were on pace to seize a record amount 
of cocaine at the Port of Antwerp, mostly concealed within containerized cargo arriving at the 
port.  This upsurge in cocaine trafficking is likely due to the combined result of increased 
cocaine production in Colombia, shifting trafficking patterns caused by successful law 
enforcement efforts at other European ports, and the port’s sprawling geographic scope which is 
difficult to fully police.  Through early October, Belgian authorities had seized approximately 26 
metric tons (MT) of cocaine at the Port of Antwerp, on pace to surpass the 30 MT seized in all of 
2016 and approximately twice the 15.7 MT seized in 2015.   Additionally, South American 
authorities seized over 40 MT of cocaine destined for Antwerp.  
 
Cannabis products remain the most widely-used illicit drugs in Belgium, according to the 
European Monitoring Centre for Drugs and Drug Addiction.  Belgium remains a source country 
for MDMA (ecstasy) and other synthetic drugs destined for local use and international markets, 
primarily in Europe.  Synthetic drugs are increasingly trafficked via the internet using virtual 
currencies, and cyber currency investigations are becoming more common among Belgian police 
authorities. 
 
Belgium and U.S. law enforcement agencies maintain close operational cooperation, focusing on 
cocaine trafficking and drug money laundering.  The United States and Belgium have fully 
operational extradition and mutual legal assistance agreements.

Belize 
 
A.  Introduction 
  
Belize is a transit country for illicit drugs destined for the United States from source countries in 
South America.  Belize is susceptible to the transshipment of illegal drugs due to its position 
along the Central American isthmus, relatively uninhabited terrain, and the hundreds of cayes 
(small islands) off its coast.  The large stretches of unpopulated jungle on the border with 
Guatemala also provide a hospitable environment for growing and trafficking marijuana.  
According to Belizean authorities, marijuana is the most prevalent illicit drug used in Belize.  
The Belizean national legislature decriminalized personal possession of 10 grams or less of 
marijuana on November 2, though it remains a crime to cultivate or sell the drug.  Belize is 
bordered by countries where the drug trade is controlled by well-organized and violent drug 
trafficking organizations.  A concerted effort by those organizations to establish themselves in 
Belize would present serious challenges to the country’s law enforcement and justice institutions. 
 
Drug trafficking organizations predominately use maritime and air routes through Belize.  
Maritime craft avoid law enforcement detection by moving at night and using the hundreds of 
cayes to conceal their movement.  Drug runners primarily use “go-fast” vessels, capitalizing on 
their small profile and powerful motors to evade law enforcement.  Drug trafficking 
organizations use air routes over Belize to smuggle illicit drugs.  The remote and sparsely 
populated terrain (380,000 persons in 8,867 square miles) is well suited for low-trafficked roads 
and undetectable airstrips on which planes can quickly land and refuel to continue their flight to 
countries north or south.   
 
Limited funds, unreliable equipment, and limited human resources hamper the capacity of the 
Belize Coast Guard (BCG) and the police Anti-Narcotics Unit (ANU) to monitor coastal waters.  
The BCG lacks adequate boats to effectively patrol Belize’s Exclusive Economic Zone.  Belize 
has limited technical capacity to monitor air or sea craft.  Belize’s drug control efforts are 
hampered by the same challenges faced by the rest of the country’s security sector – corruption, 
insufficient investigative capacity, an ineffective judicial sector, and a lack of political will.   
  
B.  Drug Control Accomplishment, Policies, and Trends 
  
1.  Institutional Development 
  
The Government of Belize worked to improve its investigative and enforcement capabilities 
across the law enforcement spectrum in 2017, in many cases with U.S. support.  The United 
States provided the ANU with three refurbished Colombian patrol vessels and the associated 
equipment and training, establishing a Belize Police Department (BPD) maritime enforcement 
capability.  The ANU can now collaborate with the BCG on interdiction operations.  The U.S. 
government provided polygraphs for ANU applicants and re-tested ANU staff and others 
involved in joint operations.  The United States provided technical assistance to the Financial 
Intelligence Unit (FIU), a semi-autonomous interagency group mandated to investigate and 
prosecute illicit financial transactions.  The FIU expanded staffing, training, and interagency 
cooperation, but did not prosecute any cases in 2017.   


INCSR 2018 Volume 1  
 
 
 
 
Country Reports 
111 
 
 
Belize and the United States signed an agreement to upgrade Belize’s criminal justice 
information management system.  The United States also continued to support Belize’s 
expansion of COMPSTAT, a crime-tracking and management system combining statistical 
analysis with geographic information to better allocate police resources to high-crime areas.  The 
BPD continued the canine program originally built with U.S. support, and increased community 
policing programs around the country.  The United States continued to support efforts to 
professionalize the police through training for new recruits through the Police Academy and for 
the nascent field training officer program. 
 
Belize is one of six countries (along with Costa Rica, the Dominican Republic, France, 
Guatemala, and the United States) that ratified the Caribbean Regional Maritime Counterdrug 
Agreement.   
 
2.  Supply Reduction 
 
Belize is not a source country for illicit drugs or precursor chemicals, but it continues to be used 
as a transshipment point for both.  Belizean and U.S. authorities have identified the coastal areas 
as rich targets for drug traffickers pushing north from South America.  Belizean security 
organizations have minimal success in limiting this criminal activity.  The BCG and BPD receive 
U.S. assistance in the form of training and equipment, but are unable to routinely utilize assets 
due to insufficient resources for fuel and maintenance. 
 
In April, with U.S. assistance, Belize carried out a successful interagency eradication mission 
targeting marijuana cultivation.  Authorities eradicated 17,588 cannabis plants in 2017, with over 
15,000 of those in the April mission.  Belize also seized 856.63 kilograms (kg) of processed 
marijuana, 58.17 kg of cocaine, and 420 grams of crack cocaine in multiple operations during the 
first nine months of 2017. 
 
In 2012, the United States assisted Belize in establishing a Mobile Interdiction Team (MIT), an 
interagency border security unit.  It initially consisted of 13 members of the Belize Immigration 
and Nationality Departments and the BPD.  In 2017, the MIT grew to 43 members and focused 
on interdicting illicit drugs and other contraband trafficked within and across the country’s ports 
of entry.  The MIT targeted roads, highways, and clandestine border crossing areas throughout 
the border regions.  MIT members are often detailed to other police units, leaving far less than 
the full 43 officers actually working border security at any given time.  
 
3.  Public Information, Prevention, and Treatment 
 
The Belize Ministry of Health’s National Drug Abuse Control Council (NDACC) is the central 
coordinating authority responsible for demand reduction, supply reduction, and control 
measures.  The council had 25 employees and a budget of approximately $225,000 for the Belize 
2018 fiscal year.  The NDACC supports special projects such as a training and certification 
program for personnel specializing in drug and violence prevention, treatment, and rehabilitation.  
NDACC staff reportedly visited 538 classrooms countrywide and taught prevention education 
classes to 16,174 students in 2017.  The NDACC assisted 20 high schools in hosting “drug 


INCSR 2018 Volume 1  
 
 
 
 
Country Reports 
112 
 
week” activities and 175 community empowerment activities nationwide. 
 
According to the NDACC, marijuana is the most widely used illicit drug in Belize, followed by 
crack cocaine.  In 2016, the NDACC Outreach Unit made referrals for 319 clients to 
rehabilitation centers, counseling and support groups, a 24.6 percent increase from 2015.  
Another 44 referrals were made during the first nine months of 2017.  Eleven drug educators and 
seven outreach case workers work for the NDACC countrywide, conducting demand-reduction 
education programs in schools as well as public education campaigns during community 
activities. 
 
Belize has three operational drug rehabilitation centers.  The primary facility is at the Belize 
Central Prison and run by the Kolbe Foundation, a non-governmental organization that also 
manages the prison, and is a residence program open to inmates and members of the public who 
are willing to overcome addiction.  The three-month program can treat up to 120 inmates and 20 
non-inmates. 
 
The other two rehabilitation centers are faith-based residential centers.  Jacob’s Farm has 
capacity for 15 clients for up to six months.  Jacob’s Farm treated 48 substance abuse clients in 
2016 and an additional 54 clients during the first nine months of 2017.  Remar Rehabilitation 
Center has capacity for approximately 30 clients for up to six months, though NDACC is 
currently not referring clients to this institution due to the lack of proper rehabilitation standards.  
  
4.  Corruption  
 
The Government of Belize does not, as a matter of government policy, encourage or facilitate 
illicit drug production or distribution.  However, insufficient resources, weak law enforcement 
institutions, an ineffective judicial system, and inadequate compensation for civil service 
employees and public safety officials facilitate corruption.   
 
Belize lacks laws specifically addressing drug-related corruption.  The Prevention of Corruption 
Act, passed in 2000, includes measures to combat corruption related to illicit monetary gains and 
the misuse of public funds while holding public office.  It also provides a code of conduct for 
civil servants.  Belize did not charge anyone under this act in 2017.  A Special Audit of the 
Immigration and Nationality Department found multiple cases of fraud and corruption within the 
department.  After this revelation and other reports of corruption among senior government 
officials (not related to illicit drugs) and significant public pressure, Belize signed and ratified 
the United Nations Convention against Corruption (UNCAC) on December 12, 2016.  In the 
course of implementing UNCAC, the government completed a self-assessment check list; 
participated in a technical exchange visit in Jamaica; and initiated an impact of corruption 
assessment. Additionally Belize completed the data collection portion of the National Risk 
Assessment (NRA).  The NRA, a terrorist financing and money laundering risk identification 
exercise, is a component of required activities for the next round of Financial Action Task Force 
mutual evaluations.

The United States supports citizen security, law enforcement, and rule of law programs in Belize, 
mainly through the Central America Regional Security Initiative (CARSI).  Through CARSI, the 
United States works with Belize to disrupt and decrease the flow of illicit drugs, weapons, and 
illicit proceeds generated by sales of illicit drugs, and to combat gangs and criminal 
organizations.  Belize partnered with the International Organization for Migration (IOM) to 
upgrade the Migration Information and Data Analysis System (MIDAS) used to track activity at 
Ports of Entry in Belize.  IOM installed MIDAS as part of a project funded by the United States.  
In 2018, Belize expects to join the Advanced Passenger Information System (APIS), managed by 
the Caribbean Community and Common Market (CARICOM).  This initiative will provide 
greater monitoring and control of land, sea, and air based entries.   
 
Other CARSI-funded projects, including the expansion of the MIT, support for justice sector 
institutions, and the provision of equipment and training for police, resulted in improvements to 
law enforcement efforts around the country.  Through CARSI, the United States funds a full-time 
Customs and Border Protection Advisor who works with MIT, Customs, Border Patrol, and 
Immigration. 
 
Belize readily assists in the capture and repatriation of U.S. citizen fugitives.  A bilateral 
extradition treaty between the United States and Belize has been in force since 2001, and a 
bilateral mutual legal assistance treaty between the United States and Belize has been in force 
since 2003.  
 
D.  Conclusion  
  
Belize faces a challenging battle against the threats of drug trafficking, and continued efforts are 
necessary to reduce the impact of drug trafficking and crime in the country.  The United States 
will continue to assist Belize by providing training, equipment, and advisory support, as well as 
support for program development in the law enforcement and justice sectors.  The United States 
encourages Belize to strengthen its public security and law enforcement institutions through 
more effective anti-corruption legislation, comprehensive background checks and vetting of new 
and existing personnel, enhanced training, and continuing education programs.  The United 
States will maintain its strong partnership with Belize and assist in its fight against transnational 
criminal organizations.

Benin 
 
Benin is a transit country for cocaine, heroin, methamphetamine, and chemical precursors used 
to produce illicit drugs.  Cocaine from South America and heroin from Southwest Asia via East 
Africa transit Benin for major markets in Western Europe, as well as a small but growing 
domestic market in Benin.  Locally cultivated cannabis remains the most accessible illicit drug 
for consumption in Benin.  Methamphetamine produced in Nigeria transits Benin for markets in 
Europe, Southeast Asia, and South Africa.  Benin receives registered commercial freight 
shipments from India of the prescription opioid tramadol, both for local consumption and for 
further transshipment to the Sahel.  Beninese authorities intercept and destroy tramadol imported 
without a license. 
 
The Central Office for Repression of Illicit Trafficking of Drugs and Precursors (OCERTID) was 
created in 1999 under the national police to coordinate drug enforcement operations.  
Information sharing and cooperation between the police, the gendarmerie, and other drug law 
enforcement units is not systematic.   
 
Benin is reliant on support from the United States and the United Kingdom for drug enforcement 
activities.  Benin continues to make efforts to improve information-sharing and build trust 
between its domestic agencies, as well as expand cooperation with neighboring countries to 
pursue complex investigations.  Forensic drug chemists and laboratories require additional 
resources to produce analysis on seized drugs that can be used in criminal prosecutions.  With 
technical assistance from the United States, Benin developed a significant written protocol in 
2016 for the handling of illicit drug prosecutions.  Since 2015, the United States has provided 
training to the Benin Navy on maritime vessel maintenance to support its drug interdiction 
efforts.  Benin does not have a bilateral extradition treaty or a mutual legal assistance treaty with 
the United States, though it is party to multilateral conventions that enable such cooperation. 
 
Benin's Law on Control of Drugs and Precursors provides penalties of up to 20 years in prison 
for trafficking drugs.  The government’s coordinating body for national drug issues is the Inter-
ministerial Committee for the Control of Drugs and Psychotropic Substances, which has the 
potential to serve an important role in coordinating, analyzing, and disseminating aggregated 
data for categories of drugs seized by the country’s various enforcement authorities.  OCERTID 
reported seizing 1,167 kilograms of illicit drugs during the first nine months of 2017. 
 
Benin’s national anti-drug policy addresses drug abuse through education programs.  The United 
States supports a substance abuse program jointly administered by the UN Office on Drugs and 
Crime and the World Health Organization that focuses on integrating drug treatment into the 
public health system.  
 
Between 2014 and 2017 Benin sat on the UN Commission of Narcotic Drugs in Vienna, and 
participated in the important plenary vote in March 2017 that secured international control of two 
precursor chemicals (NPP and ANPP) used to make illicit fentanyl.

Bolivia 
 
A.  Introduction 
 
According to estimates from the United States government and the UN Office on Drugs and 
Crime (UNODC), Bolivia is the third largest source country of coca in the world.  It is also a 
major transit zone for Peruvian cocaine.  The United States estimated coca cultivation increased 
by 1,000 hectares (ha) from 2015 to 2016 (to 37,500 ha), while UNODC estimated a 2,900 ha 
increase (to 23,100 ha).  The Bolivian government has inadequate controls over its domestic coca 
cultivation.  Most Bolivian cocaine is exported to other Latin American countries, especially 
Brazil and Argentina, for domestic consumption or for onward transit to West Africa and 
Europe, rather than to the United States.  
 
In September 2017, the United States again determined that Bolivia “failed demonstrably” to 
adhere to its obligations under international drug control agreements and the U.S. Foreign 
Assistance Act of 1961, as amended.  This Presidential determination was based, in part, on 
insufficient justification for the increase in coca production authorized under Bolivian law.  Until 
2017, Bolivian law permitted 12,000 ha of licit coca production per year.  In March, President 
Evo Morales signed into law a bill increasing the licit area of coca production to 22,000 ha.    
 
According to 2016 data from the latest UNODC report, which was partially funded by the 
Bolivian government, 97.1 percent of the coca grown in the Yungas region is sold in the legal 
market.  Nearly 90 percent of the coca grown in Cochabamba’s Chapare region is diverted away 
from the legal market.  Bolivian President Evo Morales remains the president of the coca 
growers’ federation in the Chapare region.  Peruvian officials estimate 42 percent of all Peruvian 
cocaine departs to or through Bolivia via ground or aerial transshipment, commonly known as 
the “air bridge.”  Bolivia reportedly confiscated 17 aircraft involved in drug trafficking in 2017, 
up from 11 reportedly seized in 2016 by the Special Counter-Narcotics Police Force (FELCN). 
 
In traditional (authorized) coca cultivation areas, Bolivia maintains a “social control” policy to 
curb illicit coca production.  Under this approach, the government usually negotiates with coca 
growers to obtain their consent for eradication.  In nontraditional (unauthorized) areas, including 
national parks, eradication is officially mandatory.  
 
B.  Drug Control Accomplishments, Policies, and Trends 
 
 
 
1.  Institutional Development  
 
In March 2017, President Morales promulgated two new narcotics laws to replace the Coca and 
Controlled Substances Law 1008 (1988).  In addition to increasing the licit area of coca 
production from 12,000 ha to 22,000 ha, the General Law on Coca (Law 906) provides a 
framework for the regulation of the production, circulation, transportation, marketing, 
consumption, research, industrialization, and promotion of coca in its natural state.  The new 
Controlled Substances Law (Law 913) includes three key enhancements:  a procedure for the 
payment of informants and plea bargaining in drug-related cases; a procedure for asset forfeiture; 
and a framework for wiretapping in drug-related investigations.  It also provides a legal basis for 


INCSR 2018 Volume 1  
 
 
 
 
Country Reports 
116 
 
two studies – one on coca yield per hectare and another to determine coca leaf-to-cocaine yield.  
The Controlled Substances Law’s implementing regulations remained pending as of November 
2017, but were anticipated to come into effect before the end of the year.   
 
Bolivia has numerous entities with drug control mandates.  The National Drug Control Council 
(CONALTID), chaired by the Ministry of Government, is the central drug control policy-making 
body in Bolivia.  The Vice Ministry for Social Defense and Controlled Substances (VMSD) is 
mandated to combat drug trafficking, regulate coca production, advance coca eradication and 
drug prevention, and execute rehabilitation programs.  The General Law on Coca is enforced 
through a series of regulations that clarify responsibilities between governmental institutions and 
reinforce the role of the National Council for Revaluation, Production, Marketing, Research and 
Industrialization of Coca (CONCOCA) as the point for intergovernmental coordination.  
Biometric registration of all coca producers and sellers is also mandatory by law, and regulations 
exist to monitor coca transportation routes, markets, and industrial research on coca.  
 
FELCN reports to the VMSD and has approximately 1,600 personnel, and the agency focuses 
primarily on interdiction and money laundering cases.  The Joint Eradication Task Force (FTC) 
conducts manual coca eradication with approximately 2,300 personnel.  The Unit for the 
Execution of the Fight against Narcotics (UELICN) plans and funds drug enforcement 
operations.  In 2017, UELICN’s budget remained unchanged from 2016 at $48.3 million, and a 
budget within five percent of this is expected for 2018.  In 2016, Bolivia signed or renewed drug 
control cooperation agreements with Peru, Paraguay, Brazil, Argentina, and Colombia.  
 
Bolivia’s 2016-2020 Strategy to Combat Drug Trafficking and Reduction of Excess Cultivation 
of Coca Leaf prioritizes actions against criminal organizations rather than what the Bolivian 
government considers legitimate farmers who cultivate coca for traditional uses.  The strategy is 
based on four pillars:  reduction of supply; reduction of demand; control of the excess supply of 
coca; and shared international responsibilities.  Current Bolivian coca cultivation far exceeds the 
country’s demand for coca for traditional purposes.  The Inter-American Drug Abuse Control 
Commission of the Organization of American States continues to recommend that Bolivia 
implement a system to monitor narcotics and psychotropic drugs used in healthcare settings to 
ensure the medicines are not diverted for illegitimate uses.  
 
Bolivia receives most of its foreign counternarcotic financial support from the European Union 
(EU).  The EU is currently implementing a three-year (2016-2018) assistance program budgeted 
at $50 million, and also provides an additional $10 million to support UNODC drug control 
programs and technical assistance through a European contractor.  The Bolivian government 
denies that foreign drug cartels operate within its borders, but acknowledges the presence of 
cartel emissaries.  
 
The United States and Bolivia are parties to a 1995 extradition treaty that permits the extradition 
of nationals for the most serious offenses, including drug trafficking.  Bolivia and the United 
States do not have a mutual legal assistance treaty, but both countries can request assistance 
through various multilateral conventions to which both are signatories.

FELCN reported destroying 58 cocaine hydrochloride processing labs and 2,636 rustic cocaine 
labs during 2017, a 49 percent decrease and 18 percent decrease, respectively, from 2016.  
According to the Bolivian government, FELCN seized 11.32 metric tons (MT) of cocaine base 
and 2.93 MT of cocaine hydrochloride through the first 10 months of 2017 – a seven percent 
decrease in cocaine base seizures and an 83.5 percent decrease in cocaine hydrochloride from 
what was seized during all of 2016.  FELCN arrested 3,285 individuals (including 226 foreign 
nationals) on narcotics-related offenses during this same 10-month period in 2017.  Corruption, 
interference by other branches of government, and insufficient judicial resources undermine due 
process and create delays in the administration of justice.   
 
The United States government estimated that coca cultivation was 37,500 ha in 2016, a nearly 
three percent increase from 2015, and that the production potential of coca has doubled over the 
last decade, to 275 MT.  UNODC estimated that 23,100 ha of coca were cultivated within 
Bolivia in 2016, a 14 percent increase from 2015.  UNODC officials have noted that 90 percent 
of the Chapare region’s coca cultivation is destined for illicit cocaine production and not 
traditional consumption.  According to UNODC’s report published in July 2017, there were 
7,200 ha of coca cultivated in the Chapare region, an increase of 20 percent over the previous 
year, when the legal limit for cultivation was lower.  According to the most recently available 
information from the Bolivian government, Bolivian authorities eradicated 6,000 ha of coca as of 
August 2017, compared to 6,577 during all of 2016.  
 
 
3.  Public Information, Prevention, and Treatment 
 
Illicit drug consumption remains low in Bolivia, according to UNODC and the 2016 World Drug 
Report.  According to a joint 2016 CONALTID/UNODC study funded by the European Union 
on drug use in the university student population, 6.1 percent of Bolivian university students had 
used illicit drugs in the previous year.  Broken down by category, five percent of surveyed 
students had used marijuana; 0.8 percent used LSD; and 0.4 percent used cocaine.  In October 
2017, CONALTID, the EU and UNODC launched a “Listen First” campaign aimed at 
preventing the abuse of drugs by children, focusing on parents, prevention staff, health workers, 
teachers, and decision makers.   
 
There are approximately 80 drug treatment and rehabilitation centers in Bolivia. According to the 
Bolivian government’s 2016-2020 strategy, 98 percent of those centers are run by non-
governmental organizations.  There are only two public treatment centers, one in Tarija and one 
in Santa Cruz.  
 
 
4.  Corruption 
 
As a matter of official policy, the Government of Bolivia does not encourage or facilitate illegal 
activity associated with drug trafficking.  However, President Morales and other senior 
government officials have acknowledged serious corruption problems in the judiciary and police.  
In 2017, the Ministry of Anticorruption and Transparency was dismantled and its responsibilities 
transferred to the Ministry of Justice, which was thereafter named the Ministry of Justice and 
Transparency.  Approximately 60 police officers were investigated for corruption associated with

drug trafficking in 2015, the most recent year for which data is available.  The Prosecutor’s 
office reported that during the first nine months of 2016, there were 799 narcotics trafficking 
sentences, resulting in 715 guilty verdicts and 84 acquittals.   
 
FELCN is the only police unit with a known polygraph program.  All FELCN members are 
required to take an annual polygraph test, and those who do not pass are supposed to transfer out 
of the program.  However, reports vary as to whether those two requisites are uniformly applied.  
 
C.  National Goals, Bilateral Cooperation, and U.S. Policy Initiatives 
 
The United States Embassy meets periodically with the Vice Ministry for Social Defense and 
Controlled Substances to discuss Bolivia’s drug control efforts. Bolivia sent participants to three 
courses at the U.S.-funded International Law Enforcement Academy in 2017.  The participants 
represented two Bolivian institutions:  FELCN and Bolivian Customs.  A customs mutual 
assistance agreement between the Government of Bolivia and United States to foster improved 
information sharing was signed in July 2017.  The United States does not have a counternarcotics 
presence in Bolivia, but it consults with international organizations and third-country 
governments involved in supporting Bolivian drug control goals and efforts to strengthen the rule 
of law.  In August, the U.S. Embassy held a briefing for the international diplomatic community 
in Bolivia to explain the methodology used by the U.S. to calculate 2016 coca cultivation 
numbers.  
 
Bolivia participated in the semi-annual Multilateral Maritime Counter Drug Summit held in 
November 2017, which attracted 125 maritime counterdrug professionals from nearly 25 
countries and over 65 international agencies spanning North, Central and South America, and 
Europe.    
 
D.  Conclusion  
 
Bolivia remains the third largest source of coca and cocaine in the world, and a major transit 
country for Peruvian cocaine.  The Government of Bolivia, UNODC, and the United States 
government agree Bolivian coca cultivation is increasing.  For the first time since 2010, UNODC 
estimates coca cultivation is increasing, an assessment reflected by U.S. data since 2012.  More 
importantly, according to U.S. estimates, potential pure cocaine production in Bolivia has 
doubled over the past decade, to 275 MT.  Neither UNODC nor the Government of Bolivia has 
presented information that confirms or disputes this conclusion.  There also appears to be no data 
to support the Bolivian government’s claims that traditional, cultural, and medicinal coca 
consumption has increased, which it made in justifying the increase in the legal limit of coca 
cultivation in the new General Law on Coca from 12,000 ha to 22,000 ha.  
 
Bolivia’s inadequate controls over its legal coca markets remain a matter of concern, as is 
Bolivia’s status as a transit country for cocaine trafficking.  Bolivia’s law allowing the 
cultivation of 22,000 ha of coca exceeds the amount of coca needed for traditional purposes by 
approximately 38 percent, per recent EU reporting.  In 2013, Bolivia re-acceded to the 1961 U.N. 
Single Convention on Narcotic Drugs with a reservation permitting coca to be used only within 
Bolivia for traditional, cultural, and medicinal purposes.  Despite these stated conditions, Bolivia

Country Reports

continues to promote the use of coca in other countries and discuss potential export opportunities 
for coca products.  These actions undermine Bolivia’s commitments to its international drug 
control obligations. 
 
Bolivia needs to strengthen efforts to stem the diversion of coca to cocaine processing by 
tightening controls over the coca leaf trade, achieving net reductions in coca cultivation, and 
improving law enforcement and judicial efforts to investigate and prosecute drug-related 
criminal activity.  Provisions of the new Controlled Substances Law will not be in effect until the 
Bolivian legislature approves the implementing regulations.  The law nonetheless could be a 
significant advance in the fight against drug trafficking, as it will institutionalize the use of 
modern investigative techniques previously absent from the Bolivian legal framework.

Bosnia and Herzegovina 
 
Bosnia and Herzegovina is not a major producer or consumer of illicit drugs, nor is it a producer 
of precursor chemicals.  It is primarily a transit country, positioned between drug production and 
processing centers in Southwest Asia and markets in Western Europe.  The Adriatic coast is also 
a major gateway for South American cocaine en route to European markets.  Drugs are trafficked 
through Bosnia and Herzegovina from Albania, Bulgaria, Croatia, Macedonia, and Montenegro 
for further distribution throughout Europe.  Transnational organized crime groups dominate the 
drug trade within Bosnia and Herzegovina and in the region.  Law enforcement and security 
institutions in Bosnia and Herzegovina remain limited and do not effectively deter trafficking 
through the country.  The fragmented structure of law enforcement agencies impedes their 
effective cooperation in detecting drug-related crimes and pursuing joint investigations.  There is 
little political will to create policies and programs to reduce demand for illegal drugs. 
 
Drug demand is increasing within Bosnia and Herzegovina, but is relatively low in comparison 
with other European countries.  During the first 10 months of 2017, the country’s police agencies 
reported seizing 93.5 kilograms (kg) of heroin; 0.8 kg of cocaine; 322.5 kg of marijuana; 1,753 
cannabis plants; 7.1 kg of amphetamine-type stimulants; 1,523 tablets of MDMA (ecstasy); and 
11,675 tablets of diverted pharmaceutical products.  Many of these seizures resulted from joint 
investigations between Bosnian and Herzegovinian law enforcement agencies and the Ministries 
of the Interior of the Republics of Serbia and Croatia. 
 
At the state level, the State Investigation and Protection Agency (SIPA, an FBI-equivalent 
agency) and the Border Police are responsible for drug control enforcement.  The Customs 
Administration, within the Indirect Taxation Authority (ITA), conducts routine drug seizures at 
border crossing points and inland clearance facilities but does not possess law enforcement 
investigative or arrest authorities.  Drug seizures are transferred to the custody of either the 
Border Police or SIPA for criminal investigation and prosecutorial referral.  At the entity-level, 
the Federation Ministry of Interior, Republika Srpska Ministry of Interior, Brcko District Police, 
and the Ministries of Interior of 10 cantons in the Federation are engaged on drug issues.  During 
the first 10 months of 2017, authorities recorded 1,140 felonies related to illicit drug crimes in 
the country.  
 
Bosnian and Herzegovinian law enforcement agencies face challenges with funding and staffing.  
However, they continue to work closely with the United States to develop their capacity for 
strategic planning and resource management in order to overcome some of these 
challenges.  Their ability to conduct complex investigations requires further development. 
 
Bosnia and Herzegovina cooperates with other international partners on drug control issues.  
Various agencies within the European Union, especially the European Monitoring Centre for 
Drugs and Drug Addiction, work with Bosnian and Herzegovinian law enforcement agencies and 
provide various levels of training and institutional support, as do individual European 
governments and the UN Office on Drugs and Crime.

Brazil 
 
A.  Introduction 
 
Brazil is a significant transit and destination country for cocaine.  The country’s borders with the 
cocaine source countries of Colombia, Peru, and Bolivia are porous and over three times the 
length of the U.S. border with Mexico.  The majority of cocaine transiting Brazil is destined for 
its domestic market and Europe, sometimes via West Africa.  The government views the large, 
violent, and well-organized drug trafficking organizations operating throughout the country as its 
primary domestic security threat.  Brazil suffers from a substantial and growing domestic drug 
consumption problem.  After the United States, Brazil is the world’s second-largest consumer of 
cocaine hydrochloride and likely the largest consumer of cocaine-base products.  The Brazilian 
government appreciates the gravity of the illicit drugs issue and is committed to combating drug 
trafficking, but lacks the capacity to fully stem the flow of illicit drugs across its borders.   
 
In 2017, Brazil continued to feel the effects of a deep economic recession and fiscal short-fall, 
resulting in austerity cuts across the government, including at enforcement and social welfare 
agencies that address drug flows and substance use disorders.  The government continues to 
prioritize border security and pursues a whole-of-government approach to counter drug 
trafficking and other forms of organized and violent crime, working in cooperation with 
international partners.   
 
B.  Drug Control Accomplishments, Policies, and Trends 
 
1. Institutional Development   
 
The Brazilian government’s lead agency for combating drug trafficking is the Federal Police 
(DPF).  The lead agency for policy on reducing drug demand is the National Secretariat for Drug 
Policy (SENAD).  Both DPF and SENAD are part of the Ministry of Justice, the Brazilian 
government’s lead agency for drug control policy.   
 
The DPF’s 2017 budget increased slightly from 2016 levels, but continued to be affected by 
across-the-board fiscal austerity and deep cuts to some operational budgets.  The DPF is capable 
by global standards, but recognizes that its force of 11,000 agents is insufficient to effectively 
combat drug trafficking in addition to other duties.  SENAD’s National Anti-Drug Fund budget 
was cut by 45 percent from 2016 levels. 
 
Reform of drug sentencing laws is a source of public debate, as nearly a third of the Brazilian 
prison population is incarcerated for drug-related crimes (180,000-200,000 people), more than 
any other single crime.  The National Justice Council, which oversees Brazil’s federal judiciary, 
is creating standardized sentencing guidelines that better distinguish between drug consumers 
and traffickers.    
 
Brazil maintains bilateral drug control agreements with the United States and every country in 
South America, in addition to formal partnerships with the UN Office on Drugs and Crime 
(UNODC), the Organization of American States’ Inter-American Drug Abuse Control 


INCSR 2018 Volume 1  
 
 
 
 
Country Reports 
122 
 
Commission, and INTERPOL.  In 2017, Brazil signed an agreement with UNODC to establish a 
joint Port Control Unit at the port of Santos and to work with the European Union-funded 
AIRCOP interdiction program.  Brazil has extradition and mutual legal assistance treaties with 
the United States.   
 
 
2.  Supply Reduction   
 
Brazil remains a major transit route for cocaine from the source countries of Bolivia, Colombia, 
and Peru.  Cocaine products are smuggled across land borders via small aircraft and trucks, as 
well as by boats using the Amazon riverine system.  Brazil's sea ports play a key role in drug 
smuggling, and Brazilian law enforcement and customs continue to improve port screening and 
interdiction.  The majority of cocaine entering Brazil is destined for its domestic market and 
Europe, often through West Africa.  In September, DPF seized 1.1 metric tons (MT) of cocaine 
from an organization utilizing Brazilian ports to transport cocaine to Belgium, thanks in part to 
improved monitoring techniques and cooperation with United States law enforcement.  In 
October, DPF seized 155 kilograms (kg) of cocaine base and 556 kg of high grade marijuana on 
the Amazon River in northern Brazil.  
 
Since 2011, Brazil’s Strategic Border Plan has confronted drug trafficking and transnational 
crime, including by supporting periodic operations.  Operation Sentinela, supervised by the 
Ministry of Justice, is an ongoing intelligence-building effort to coordinate state, local, and 
federal police forces, particularly on the border.  Operation Ágata, coordinated by the Ministry of 
Defense, conducts periodic tactical missions at strategic border points.  These operations took 
place periodically in 2017 with some success, but consolidated seizure statistics were not 
available at the time of this report.  In November 2016, Brazil established the Integrated Border 
Program to improve cooperation among agencies and with international partners. 
 
During the first six months of 2017, the DPF reported seizures of 22 MT of cocaine and 144.6 
MT of marijuana, both figures representing increases over the same period in 2016.  Much of this 
volume was seized at the port in Santos.  Consolidated interdiction data from state police is not 
available. 
  
Brazil conducts recurring marijuana eradication operations in the country’s northeast.  In a single 
operation in May, the DPF eradicated 556,000 square feet of marijuana plantings, with an 
estimated yield of 185 MT.  During the first six months of 2017, the DPF eradicated 966,398 
marijuana plants.   
 
Synthetic drugs are present in Brazil, though combating them is a lower government priority 
given the overwhelming cocaine problem.  In April, police in Rio de Janeiro seized 1,500 pills of 
MDMA (ecstasy) during the arrest of a major synthetic drug dealer.  Overall in 2017, DPF 
reported the seizure of 5,448 dosage units of LSD, 186,285 units of MDMA, and 73,983 units of 
methamphetamine.  Complex synthetic drugs such as MDMA and LSD are usually smuggled in 
small amounts via couriers flying commercial airlines from Europe.   
 
 
3.  Public Information, Prevention, and Treatment   
 


INCSR 2018 Volume 1  
 
 
 
 
Country Reports 
123 
 
There were no new comprehensive drug use surveys in Brazil in 2017.  In 2014, SENAD 
commissioned a national drug use survey, and officials continue to analyze the results for 
publication.   
  
Brazilian federal and state authorities actively promoted drug threat awareness, demand 
reduction, and treatment programs in 2017.  The government continues to implement its 2005 
National Drug Policy via its regular budget process, with emphasis on distance-learning training 
for drug use disorder professionals and civil society organizations and building social service 
capacity at the municipal level.  SENAD’s recently completed five-year, $1 billion signature 
program “Crack:  It’s Possible to Beat It,” constructed a national network of treatment and 
awareness programs.  In 2017, SENAD continued to analyze the program’s results and 
developing its next major drug demand reduction effort.   
 
In Sao Paulo, Brazil’s largest city, the municipal government replaced a drug harm reduction 
program that provided social services and healthcare for 400 crack cocaine users with a 
traditional policing and treatment approach. 
 
Brazil approaches the reintegration of people with substance use disorders into society 
holistically, providing a range of services from medical care to job training.  Brazil’s programs 
are not yet commensurate with the size of the addicted population. 
 
 
4.  Corruption  
 
As a matter of government policy, the Brazilian government does not encourage or facilitate 
illegal activity associated with drug trafficking, and there is little evidence to suggest that senior 
government officials are engaged in such activity.  While there were numerous allegations and 
examples of political corruption throughout Brazil, including at the highest levels of government, 
there were no direct links between political corruption and drug trafficking at the national level.  
Delays in judicial proceedings often resulted in cases being dismissed. 
  
C.  National Goals, Bilateral Cooperation, and U.S. Policy Initiatives 
 
The 2008 U.S.-Brazil Memorandum of Understanding on Narcotics Control and Law 
Enforcement supports capacity building in Brazilian federal and state agencies to combat illicit 
drug trafficking.  In 2017, the United States provided significant training support to Brazilian law 
enforcement through 23 courses reaching nearly 1,000 officers on topics ranging from money 
laundering to community policing.  Cooperation between Brazilian and U.S. law enforcement is 
excellent.   
 
D.  Conclusion 
 
Brazil has institutionalized its commitment to combating illicit drug trafficking and addressing a 
growing domestic consumption problem.  Brazil would benefit from comprehensive population 
surveys to determine the scope of its domestic drug consumption, consolidated nationwide data 
on drug interdiction, increased monitoring of its sea ports, and greater cooperation with 
neighboring countries.

Burma 
 
A.  Introduction 
 
Burma is the world’s second largest source of illicit opiates and a major source of amphetamine-
type stimulants (ATS).  Production of heroin, crystal methamphetamine, and “yaba” pills 
(methamphetamine mixed with caffeine) generally takes place in areas controlled by ethnic 
armed groups along the country’s eastern borders, most notably in parts of Shan State, where 
Burmese authorities have little control.  Burma’s porous borders with India, China, Laos, 
Bangladesh, and Thailand provide ample routes for the flow of precursor chemicals into Burma 
and illegal drugs out to regional markets.  Domestic consumption of illicit drugs is widespread 
and growing within Burma.  While significant volumes of illicit drugs originating from Burma 
reach international markets, Burma is not a major source or transit country for drugs entering the 
United States.  The illicit revenue generated by Burma’s drug trade is estimated to be in the tens 
of billions of dollars annually. 
  
Government institutions engaged in drug control activities generally do not have sufficient 
resources or technical capacity to effectively address the scope of the problem.  Events in 2017 
in northern Rakhine State and the ongoing peace process continue to take precedence in the 
country, posing further challenges to coordinating effective drug control efforts. 
  
B.  Drug Control Accomplishments, Policies, and Trends  
 
 
1.  Institutional Development 
 
The Central Committee for Drug Abuse Control (CCDAC) is Burma’s interagency mechanism 
for coordinating efforts against illicit drugs.  While the CCDAC is committed to its mission, the 
government’s focus on arresting and prosecuting lower-level users and traffickers has placed 
undue burdens on law enforcement, justice, and correctional institutions.  Information about the 
overall prison population is incomplete, but some officials have estimated that 70 percent of 
current inmates have been incarcerated for drug offenses.  The Union Attorney General’s Office 
(UAGO) has estimated that as many as 50 percent of all cases prosecuted in the country relate to 
drug offenses.  However, few major drug trafficking figures or organizations have been 
prosecuted.  Insufficient resources, corruption, and regularly scheduled rotations by police and 
prosecutors all present challenges to developing highly skilled, effective police and justice 
practitioners specialized in drug-related crimes. 
  
The Drug Enforcement Division (DED), a constituent element of the Myanmar Police Force 
(MPF) within the Ministry of Home Affairs, has three sub-divisions (in Rangoon, Mandalay, and 
Taung Gyi) and runs 50 Anti-Narcotics Task Force (ANTF) units throughout the country.  The 
DED continues to make major drug seizures, particularly near key drug producing areas in Shan 
State, but is under-resourced in terms of personnel and equipment.  The DED is supposed to have 
3,994 employees; however, as of August 2017, there were only 1,118.  The country’s antiquated 
criminal legislation does not permit law enforcement actions that are essential for sophisticated 
narcotics investigations, such as controlled deliveries.  
  


INCSR 2018 Volume 1  
 
 
 
 
Country Reports 
125 
 
Burma’s justice system is underdeveloped, and judicial and prosecutorial institutions lack the 
legal framework to effectively prosecute the volume of drug-related crimes and complex drug 
networks.  The UAGO oversees all prosecutions in the country, and consults on legislation in the 
criminal justice field.  Prosecutors (known as “law officers”) in the 71 district- and 330 
township-level law offices handle the bulk of drug prosecutions.  Law officers are generally 
given drug cases after the police have already completed their investigations, with little or no 
engagement beforehand.  The UAGO also oversees prosecutorial training, but specialized 
narcotics prosecution training has not been fully institutionalized.  There are similar dynamics in 
the country’s court system.     
  
Burma’s law enforcement and justice institutions have the capacity to cooperate internationally, 
but outdated regulations need to be amended or updated.  A “central authority” to make and 
receive mutual legal assistance requests is underdeveloped.  Burma passed an extradition law in 
July 2017 that lays out procedures more specifically than outlined in the criminal procedure 
code, and thus facilitates some cross-border criminal justice cooperation.  On a working level, 
DED officers and commanders maintain relationships with counterparts in neighboring 
countries, most notably Thailand and China.  
  
The Ministries of Health and Sports; Social Welfare, Relief and Resettlement; and Education are 
responsible for drug use treatment and prevention.  There is a small, but growing, cadre of health 
and education professionals in the drug control field; however, training programs are relatively 
new in the country, and there are few resources for rehabilitation programs.  
 
 
2.  Supply Reduction 
 
Most opium cultivation and drug production takes place in territory that is not under the control 
of the Burmese government, complicating efforts to reduce supplies.  In 2015, the most recent 
year for which data is available, the UN Office on Drugs and Crime (UNODC) estimated 55,500 
hectares (ha) of opium poppy cultivation, a slight decrease from the prior year.  Heroin and ATS 
production occurs mainly along the country’s eastern border with China and Laos and southern 
border with Thailand.  The introduction of small pill presses has created a cottage industry in 
those areas, making it easy for trafficking organizations to recruit individuals, supply them with 
pill presses, and mass produce tens of millions of pills.  A small pill press operation can 
reportedly produce up to a million tablets a day. 
  
Between January 1 and October 12, 2017, Burmese authorities seized 59,638,430 ATS 
tablets; 854.59 kilograms (kg) of crystal methamphetamine; approximately 1.272 metric tons of 
various grades of opium; 2.74 liters of opium liquid; and 322.19 kg of heroin.  The U.S. Drug 
Enforcement Administration (DEA) estimates that these seizures represent a small fraction of the 
illicit drugs actually produced within the country.  At three drug destruction ceremonies marking 
the annual International Day against Drug Abuse on June 26, Burmese law enforcement officers 
destroyed $386 million worth of seized illicit drugs, compared to $56.31 million in 2016.  Two 
of the largest individual seizures were in July in Mandalay, where police seized a single 
shipment worth $44 million, and in August in Tachileik (Shan State), where the authorities 
seized close to 30 million yaba pills destined for Thailand.  Overall, the varieties of drugs seized 


INCSR 2018 Volume 1  
 
 
 
 
Country Reports 
126 
 
increased from 37 last year to 51 this year, and the data points to a marked increase in the 
production, consumption, and export of ATS.   
  
From January 1 to October 12, 2017, there were 10,973 drug-related arrests from 7,422 cases, a 
statistically similar number of arrests that arose from 8,800 cases in 2016.  The majority of those 
arrested were small-time users or traffickers.  
 
 
3.  Public Information, Prevention, and Treatment 
 
The CCDAC is partnering with UNODC to develop Burma’s first National Drug Use Survey, 
but UNODC had not received permission from the Ministry of Home Affairs to begin collecting 
data at the conclusion of 2017.  Anecdotal information suggests domestic consumption of illicit 
drugs is extremely high, and the country’s existing capacity falls far short of accommodating 
those who seek or need treatment.   
  
The Ministry of Health officially oversees 85 drug treatment facilities, though regional officials 
have indicated that at least some of these facilities are not actually functional.  The Ministry’s 
official statistic of 83,000 intravenous drug users is believed to be a significant 
underestimation.  The incidence of intravenous drug users contracting HIV is believed to be very 
high, and access to treatment and rehabilitation services is very limited.  
   
The Ministry of Health and Sports and the Ministry of Social Welfare, Relief and Resettlement 
rely heavily on the international community to provide training on drug treatment and prevention 
for health and education professionals.  With U.S. funding, the Colombo Plan provided training 
to Burmese health professionals on the U.S.-developed Universal Treatment Curriculum for 
Substance Use Disorders in 2017, and 20 passed the International Certified Addictions 
Professional (ICAP) Exam in June.  This is the first group of ICAP-credentialed professionals in 
the country.  In October, the Colombo Plan launched its Universal Prevention Curriculum 
training series for 30 national trainers, mainly from the Ministry of Education.   
  
The Ministry of Health’s National Methadone Maintenance Therapy (MMT) Program has 51 
sites across Burma, five of which were opened in 2017.  More than 13,000 patients take MMT 
daily, with the two northernmost states of Kachin and Sagaing accounting for 65 percent of 
patients. 
  
CCDAC coordination with civil society is an important element of its awareness-raising 
campaigns.  Non-governmental organizations (NGOs) and international organizations conduct 
training on demand reduction, but there are still significant challenges in reaching rural or remote 
communities.  The United States funds a local NGO, the Substance Abuse Research Association 
(SARA), to provide drug demand reduction training.  In September, SARA conducted its first 
training to community leaders in Myitkyina, Kachin State.  The local government and civil 
society groups actively supported the program, in recognition of the overwhelming problems 
posed by domestic drug consumption. 
 
 
4.  Corruption 
 


INCSR 2018 Volume 1  
 
 
 
 
Country Reports 
127 
 
The Government of Burma does not, as a matter of policy, encourage or facilitate the illicit 
production or distribution of drugs, or the laundering of proceeds from illegal drug transactions.  
However, corruption is widespread in Burma, and illicit proceeds from the drug trade fuel that 
corruption.  There are no concrete details on the dollar value and flow of illicit proceeds because 
transactions are in cash, the banking system is underdeveloped, and the informal “hundi” system 
facilitates financial transactions outside of the banking system.  There are reports that members 
of the military profit directly and indirectly from drug trafficking, but such information has not 
resulted in significant investigations or prosecutions.   
 
C.  National Goals, Bilateral Cooperation, and U.S. Policy Initiatives 
 
Burma is in the process of amending its drug laws and policy in light of these massive 
challenges.  Parliament is considering amendments to the 1993 narcotic law to focus less on first-
time users, and to clearly define thresholds for personal use and trafficking.  Proposed 
amendments would give serious consideration to treatment as an alternative to 
imprisonment.  The CCDAC is working with UNODC to develop a new drug control policy that 
can be used to more effectively identify priorities and allocate resources.  The CCDAC would 
roll out the new policy when the new drug law is passed.  Even if additional resources are 
allocated, the lack of government control of drug-producing areas will remain an enormous 
obstacle to preventing the flow of illicit drugs in and out of the country.  
  
U.S. assistance to Burma supports drug control efforts within the country.  In August 2017, 
Burma signed an amended letter of agreement with the United States that facilitates broadened 
engagement in law enforcement, drug control, and rule of law.   
  
DEA continues to work closely with the DED on operations and building interdiction capacity.  
The United States provides assistance to law enforcement and justice sector officials on drug 
enforcement and related topics.  In 2017, approximately 60 officials from the MPF, Anti-
Corruption Commission (ACC), Bureau of Special Investigation, Fire Services Department, and 
Forest Department benefited from instruction in 27 courses at the U.S.-funded International Law 
Enforcement Academy (ILEA) in Bangkok.  In May 2017, the United States organized the visit 
of the Deputy Minister of Home Affairs to the United States, which included consultations with 
senior U.S. officials, federal and local law enforcement officials, and NGOs.   
  
In May, the United States provided in-country training for Burma’s ACC.  Following the 
training, the ACC Chairman requested case management assistance, which will continue to be 
provided in 2018.  The United States also supported Burmese officials’ participation in public 
corruption and financial investigations courses at ILEA Bangkok.  
  
During 2017, Burmese officials from the UAGO and the Supreme Court participated in U.S.-led 
regional trainings on cybercrime, intellectual property violations, and law enforcement 
coordination.  Additional assistance is planned for 2018 to develop a specialized prosecutorial 
unit within the UAGO for sophisticated crimes with international dimensions, including drug 
trafficking.  The United States is one of the major international partners engaged with the 
Government of Burma on drug treatment and demand reduction.

D.  Conclusion 
 
The scope of Burma’s drug problem – the consumption and trafficking of illicit opiates and ATS 
– is enormous.  Domestic consumption is widespread and degrades communities.  Burma is a 
major source of illicit drugs throughout the region, and illicit profits feed corruption and fund 
non-governmental armed groups.  The resources currently allocated to the problem by Burma’s 
government are insufficient to achieve major improvements in the near term.  The United States 
remains a close partner with the Government of Burma on all elements of the country’s drug 
control policy, and will continue to work with regional and international partners to help the 
Burmese government’s efforts to address its challenges.

Cabo Verde 
 
Cabo Verde remains an important transit hub for cocaine, cannabis, and small amounts of other 
drugs trafficked from Latin America to Europe.  The major international airports on Santiago and 
Sal continue to experience increasing tourist and business travel each year, expanding 
opportunities for drug trafficking via human couriers.  Cargo and cruise ship traffic through the 
major ports on Santiago, Sao Vicente, and Sal, and Cabo Verde’s historic and cultural ties to 
Guinea-Bissau – a significant transshipment point for cocaine – also increase opportunities for 
drug trafficking.  The archipelago’s large maritime territory and minimal interdiction resources 
make Cabo Verde attractive to traffickers using air and maritime routes.  The UN Office on 
Drugs and Crime reports that cannabis, cocaine, hashish, heroin, and methamphetamines are the 
most commonly used drugs in Cabo Verde.  There are reports that synthetic drugs including 
MDMA (ecstasy) are available on the popular tourist islands of Sal and Boa Vista.  
 
Corruption is relatively low in Cabo Verde.  The Government of Cabo Verde is engaged in 
fighting drug trafficking and domestic drug use.  Support from the United States and other 
international donors is helping to improve the competency of Cabo Verdean law enforcement 
agencies to identify and interdict illicit drug shipments.  U.S. support has also increased Cabo 
Verde’s ability to combat money laundering and other financial crimes often associated with 
drug trafficking.  There are few drug demand reduction programs active in the country, and 
recidivism for drug crimes is a major problem.  
 
In August 2017, police seized a reported 1,157 kilogram shipment of cocaine from a private 
yacht in Mindelo.  The yacht had sailed from Fortaleza, Brazil, and was bound for Europe.   
 
The United States and other partners support Cabo Verde in combating illicit drug trafficking 
and associated crime, providing robust and varied training to law enforcement and armed forces 
in Cabo Verde.  The Center for Maritime Security Operations (COSMAR) in Praia and the Joint

Canada 
 
A.  Introduction 
  
In 2017, the Canadian government continued to combat the production, distribution, and 
consumption of illicit drugs.  Canada is a supplier of MDMA (ecstasy), marijuana, and fentanyl 
to the United States.  Canada targets the trafficking of synthetic drugs, particularly fentanyl and 
fentanyl precursors.  Canada and the United States cooperate extensively in drug control efforts 
by sharing information and conducting coordinated operations. 
  
B.  Drug Control Accomplishments, Policies, and Trends 
  
 
1.  Institutional Development 
  
Funding under Canada’s National Anti-drug Strategy (NADS) is approximately $430 million 
over 2012-2017 for prevention, treatment, and enforcement.  Additional drug control activities 
are funded outside the NADS; provinces and territories have significant budgets for prevention 
and treatment.  In June, two government-approved supervised drug injection centers and a 
mobile unit began operation in Montreal.  Vancouver and Ottawa have similar facilities and 
federal regulator Health Canada approved three sites in Toronto in September and is studying 
applications for additional sites in British Columbia. 
 
In April, the Justice Minister introduced legislation (Bill C-45) to provide legal access to 
cannabis and to control and regulate its production, distribution, and sale by July 1, 2018.  The 
bill remains in Parliament and has not yet become law.  The government stated the bill’s purpose 
as preventing young persons from accessing cannabis, protecting public health and public safety 
by establishing strict safety and quality requirements, deterring criminal activity, and reducing 
the burden on the criminal justice system.  Also in April, the government introduced legislation 
(Bill C-46) to enact new criminal offenses for drug-impaired driving and to provide law 
enforcement with enhanced authority to detect and detain suspected impaired drivers by July 1, 
2018.  This bill also remains in Parliament and has not yet become law. 
 
In June, the Minister of Health announced an Opioid Action Plan to educate Canadians about 
risks of opioid use; improve prescribing practices; reduce access to unnecessary opioids; improve 
treatment options; and strengthen data collection.  
 
In August, Health Canada announced the new Access to Cannabis for Medical Purposes 
Regulations (ACMPR) to replace regulations struck down by Federal Court.  The court ruled the 
new regulations allowed Canadians to produce limited amounts of cannabis for their own use for 
medical purposes, or designate someone to produce cannabis for them. 
 
Canada is party to the Inter-American Convention on Mutual Legal Assistance in Criminal 
Matters, and the Inter-American Convention against Corruption.  The Royal Canadian Mounted 
Police (RCMP) is a member of the International Narcotics Control Board's (INCB) Task Forces, 
which includes Project ION (International Operation on New Psychoactive Substances).

2.  Supply Reduction 
  
Canada is a primary source country of high-potency marijuana and MDMA to the United States 
and of synthetic drugs and amphetamine-type stimulants to Asia and Australia.  Synthetic 
opioids have also reached the United States from Canada.  Cannabis cultivation and synthetic 
drug manufacture are concentrated in British Columbia, Quebec, and Ontario.  
Methamphetamine continues to be produced in large quantities.  South America remains 
Canada’s primary source for cocaine, some of which transits the United States, while 
Afghanistan remains Canada’s primary source of heroin.   
 
Canadian officials also report increasing imports of fentanyl from China, largely via mail 
courier.  Recent seizures of multi-kilogram quantities of fentanyl and carfentanil in powder form 
indicate these substances are increasingly manufactured within Canada.  No Canadian 
government drug seizure statistics for 2017 were available at the time of this report. 
  
 
3.  Public Information, Prevention, and Treatment 
  
Health Canada provides approximately $15.7 million annually to support the NADS Prevention 
and Treatment Action Plans.  This funding supported 47 projects under the Substance Use and 
Addictions Program (SUAP) in 2016.  The SUAP supports evidence-based initiatives in health 
promotion, prevention, harm reduction, and treatment. 
 
Canada is providing approximately $8.6 million over five years from the NADS to enhance 
prevention and treatment within First Nations communities, including to address prescription 
drug abuse. 
 
Canada supports various harm reduction initiatives, including supervised consumption sites, the 
use of naloxone to reverse overdoses, and the medical use of diacetylmorphine and other 
medication-assisted therapies for the treatment of opioid dependence.  Between 2012 and 2017, 
Justice Canada is providing approximately $10.6 million per year to evaluate if drug treatment 
courts are an effective method of deterring recidivism among drug offenders.  
 
The most recent data show the prevalence of cannabis use among Canadians aged 15 years and 
older was 11 percent in 2013, up slightly from 2012, but lower than in 2004 (14.1 percent).  
Among students in grades 7-12, 17 percent reported using cannabis in 2014-15.  Use of other 
illicit drugs such as MDMA (0.4 percent), hallucinogens (0.6 percent), cocaine or crack (0.9 
percent) and speed/methamphetamine (0.2 percent) remained largely unchanged since 2004.  Use 
of heroin was not reported.  New data will be available in January 2018. 
 
According to the INCB, Canada is the second largest per capita consumer of prescription opioids 
in the world.  In 2013, 15 percent of Canadians aged 15 years and older reported using an opioid 
pain reliever in the past year.  Among them, two percent reported abusing opioids, a decrease 
from 2012 (five percent). 
  
 
4.  Corruption 
  


INCSR 2018 Volume 1  
 
 
 
 
Country Reports 
132 
 
Canada has strong anti-corruption laws and policies and holds its officials to a high standard of 
conduct.  The Canadian government pursues malfeasant civil servants and subjects them to 
prosecution.  No government officials are known to engage in, encourage, or facilitate illegal 
activity associated with drug trafficking.  Corruption among law enforcement officials is rare. 
  
C.  National Goals, Bilateral Cooperation, and U.S. Policy Initiatives 
  
The United States and Canada exchange forfeited assets through a bilateral asset-sharing 
agreement and share information on customs offenses through a customs mutual assistance 
agreement.  Judicial assistance and extradition matters operate under a mutual legal assistance 
treaty, an extradition treaty, and related law-enforcement protocols, including the long-standing 
memorandum of understanding between the DEA and RCMP by which their representatives 
work with each other on drug-related matters. 
 
Various U.S. federal, state, local, and tribal entities collaborate with RCMP, Canada Border 
Services Agency (CBSA), provincial and local police, and other Canadian law enforcement 
authorities to combat illicit drugs.  Cooperation is coordinated through the Cross Border Law 
Enforcement Advisory Committee, Joint Management Teams, and other bilateral fora.  
Integrated teams of Canadian and U.S. law enforcement authorities operate in several locations 
along the Northern Border across a variety of structures, including Border Enforcement Security 
Taskforces (BEST), Integrated Border Enforcement Teams (IBET), and the Integrated Cross-
border Maritime Law Enforcement Operations (aka "Shiprider"). 
 
Canada participates with the United States and Mexico in the North American Dialogue on Drug 
Policy.  Canada and the United States also continue to exercise a memorandum of understanding 
regarding deployment of U.S. Coast Guard detachments on Canadian Navy ships in the 
Caribbean Sea and Eastern Pacific Ocean, which during the first 10 months of 2017 resulted in 
the seizure of over 5.25 metric tons of cocaine. 
  
D.  Conclusion 
  
The United States cooperates extensively with Canada on law enforcement matters and 
acknowledges the strong and consistent anti-drug efforts of Canada’s federal government. 
 
The United States will continue to work with Canada to stem the flow of illegal drugs across our 
shared border and enhance regulatory frameworks to prevent access to precursor chemicals and 
lab equipment for criminal use.

China 
 
A.  Introduction 
 
China's geographical location, vast land area, massive population, and expanding economy have 
all contributed to it becoming a hub for drug and precursor chemical production and trafficking.  
China also faces significant illicit drug consumption challenges, including synthetic drugs.  
China shares borders with drug source countries in both Southeast and Southwest Asia and 
remains a major destination and transit country for heroin produced in these areas.  Its numerous 
coastal cities with high-volume seaports and its vast network of major international airports 
make China an ideal destination and transit country for illicit drugs, as well as a major source of 
synthetic drugs, new psychoactive substances (NPS), and precursor chemicals used to produce 
illicit drugs.  Domestic Chinese criminal organizations traffic illicit drugs within China as well as 
to international markets, and Chinese authorities have noted the presence of international drug 
trafficking organizations originating from Africa and Mexico operating within the country.  
China's role as a major international financial center has also fueled an increase in illicit drug and 
precursor chemical-related money laundering activities.  
 
China is a major source of NPS and other synthetic drugs, including fentanyl and 
methamphetamine, and domestic use of synthetic drugs (primarily methamphetamine and 
ketamine) is becoming increasingly prevalent.  China's large chemical and pharmaceutical 
industries provide an ideal environment for the illicit production and export of these drugs.  
According to U.S. and international law enforcement sources, a majority of the NPS seized in 
North America and Europe originate from China and can be purchased via the internet and 
shipped or mailed to overseas customers.  Chemical alterations of scheduled drugs to circumvent 
existing anti-drug laws have hampered efforts to stem the flow of these drugs. 
 
The current opioid crisis in the United States underlines the importance of bilateral U.S.-Chinese 
drug control cooperation.  Based on U.S. Customs and Border Protection seizure data, China is 
the principal source country of illicit fentanyl and fentanyl-related compounds in the United 
States, including both scheduled and non-scheduled substances.  The challenges posed by 
trafficking via the internet and small parcel trafficking patterns are formidable and will test the 
cooperative spirit and ingenuity of the law enforcement authorities in both countries. 
 
B.  Drug Control Accomplishments, Policies, and Trends 
 
 
1.  Institutional Development 
 
China’s drug control strategy focuses on prevention, education, illicit crop eradication, 
interdiction, rehabilitation, commercial regulation, and law enforcement.  The Ministry of Public 
Security (MPS) Narcotics Control Bureau is the primary national drug enforcement entity and 
works in conjunction with provincial public security bureau offices.  The Anti-Smuggling 
Bureau within the General Administration of Customs is responsible for the enforcement of 
China’s drug control laws at seaports, airports, and land border checkpoints.  China maintains 
bilateral drug control agreements with many countries and international organizations, including 


INCSR 2018 Volume 1  
 
 
 
 
Country Reports 
134 
 
the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime, and participates in a variety of international drug 
conferences and bilateral meetings. 
 
  
2.  Supply Reduction 
 
According to the National Narcotics Control Commission (NNCC)'s 2017 Annual Drug Report, 
Chinese law enforcement conducted 140,000 drug trafficking-related investigations and made 
168,000 drug related arrests in 2016 (the most recent year for which data is available).  
Authorities also seized a total of 82.1 metric tons (MT) of illicit drugs during this period, 
including 8.8 MT of heroin, 29 MT of methamphetamine, and 10.4 MT of ketamine.  Chinese 
authorities also targeted clandestine labs used to produce NPS and other synthetic drugs, illicit 
drugs, and precursors, destroying 438 clandestine laboratories, and arresting 2,089 suspects in 
2016, as well as seizing 1,584.6 MT tons of precursor chemicals.  
 
In October 2015, China enacted wide-reaching legislation granting MPS the authority to more 
quickly schedule new and emerging drugs deemed to have no identified medical use, including 
substances not used within China.  The legislation also established immediate controls over 116 
NPS.  China’s enactment of this legislation provides a mechanism for enhanced cooperation with 
the United States and other international partners to control the spread of NPS.  China and the 
United States continue to work together to reduce the supply of synthetic opioids such as 
fentanyl and fentanyl analogues from China to the Unites States.  In 2017, China added the 
synthetic opioid U-47700 along with carfentanil and three other fentanyl-type substances to their 
list of controlled substances.    
 
  
3.  Public Information, Prevention, and Treatment 
 
According to NNCC, synthetic drugs – primarily methamphetamine and ketamine – have 
surpassed heroin and other opioids as China’s primary domestic drug threat. NNCC has an 
outreach program to raise awareness of the negative health effects of illicit drug use and promote 
drug demand reduction.  According to the NNCC's 2017 Annual Drug Report, the total number 
of registered illegal drug users in China is 2.505 million, but the actual number of drug abusers is 
estimated to be at least 14 million, according to media reports.  Of the reported registered drug 
users, 1.51 million (60 percent) reportedly use synthetic drugs, while 955,000 (38.1 percent) 
reportedly use opiates and 35,000 (1.4 percent) reportedly use other drugs. According to NNCC, 
60.6 percent of the registered users in China are between 18 and 35 years old.  During this 
reporting period, 445,000 new drug users were identified, a 16.2 percent increase from 2015. 
 
In 2016, NNCC formulated and distributed its “Work Plan on Community-based Drug Treatment 
and Rehabilitation, 2016-2020” to further the development of a community-based drug treatment 
and recovery system.  The Plan supports NNCC efforts to combine methadone maintenance 
treatment and community-based drug treatment and recovery.  In addition to 770 clinics offering 
methadone maintenance treatment, China has in place 3,258 job placement sites and 29,000 
township level offices responsible for community-based drug treatment and recovery work, 
employing 31,000 full-time community workers. 
 
 
4.  Corruption 


INCSR 2018 Volume 1  
 
 
 
 
Country Reports 
135 
 
 
The Ministry of Public Security takes allegations of drug-related corruption seriously, and 
launches investigations when deemed appropriate.  Despite efforts to stem drug-related 
corruption, financial corruption among provincial, prefectural, county, and district government 
officials continues to be a concern.  The Government of China does not, as a matter of 
government policy, encourage or facilitate illicit drug production or distribution, nor is it 
involved in laundering the proceeds of the sale of illicit drugs.  Based on publicly available 
information, no senior Chinese official at the central government level is known to have 
facilitated the illicit production or distribution of drugs in 2017.  Similarly, no senior Chinese 
official from the central government is known to have laundered proceeds from drug-related 
activities. 
 
 C.  National Goals, Bilateral Cooperation, and U.S. Policy Initiatives 
 
The Bilateral Drug Intelligence Working Group (BDIWG) and the Counter Narcotics Working 
Group (CNWG), which reports to the U.S.-China Joint Liaison Group on Law Enforcement 
(JLG), meet annually to exchange views and information on trends in drug abuse and trafficking; 
discuss pertinent laws, regulations, policies and procedures in the respective countries; seek 
progress and address challenges in precursor chemical control; and find mechanisms to cooperate 
on investigations and cases of mutual interest.  At the Law Enforcement and Cybersecurity 
Dialogue in 2017, the United States and China agreed to enhance cooperation and information 
sharing to support mutual consideration of controls on additional NPS, including fentanyl 
analogues.  China and the United States signed a bilateral mutual legal assistance agreement in 
2000, which entered into force in 2001. 
 
D.  Conclusion 
 
Drug control cooperation between the United States and China continues to improve through law 
enforcement operational cooperation and various working groups and consultative mechanisms.  
While drug trafficking, manufacturing, diversion, and other drug-related crimes remain 
significant problems in China, the central government continues to take steps to integrate China 
into regional and global drug control efforts, as well as to address the country’s domestic drug 
problem through enforcement and rehabilitation.  U.S. law enforcement has made inroads in 
building working relationships with provincial public security bureaus, with oversight by central 
authorities, and relations continue to strengthen.

Colombia 
 
A.  Introduction 
 
Colombia is the world’s top producer of cocaine, as well as a source country of heroin and 
marijuana.  Although the Colombian government continues to counter the production and 
trafficking of illicit drugs through aggressive eradication, interdiction, and counter-organized 
crime operations, Colombian coca cultivation and cocaine production exceeded all-time record 
levels during 2016.  The United States estimates potential pure cocaine production surged by 37 
percent, from 520 metric tons (MT) in 2015 to 710 MT in 2016 (the most recent year for which 
data is available).  The United States further estimates coca cultivation increased 18 percent from 
159,000 hectares (ha) in 2015 to 188,000 ha in 2016, exceeding the previously recorded high of 
approximately 170,000 ha in 2001.  
 
The Colombian government reported seizing a total of 405 MT of pure cocaine and cocaine base 
during 2016, an increase of approximately 37 percent over the previous record high of 295 MT 
of pure cocaine and cocaine based seized in 2015.  As of early December 2017, the Colombian 
government reported seizing approximately 449 MT of pure cocaine and cocaine base.  The 
Colombian government is eliminating tons of potential cocaine through manual eradication of 
coca, reporting 17,642 ha of coca eradicated during 2016 and 52,283 ha of coca eradicated 
through mid-December.  Complementary to its forced eradication programs, the Colombian 
government separately sought to eradicate approximately 50,000 via their crop substitution 
program in 2017.  Due to delays in implementing this program, the Colombian government 
extended the deadline to meet this goal to May 2018.  There was insufficient data available to 
analyze the results of these efforts at the time of this report. 
 
According to the U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA), approximately 92 percent of 
the cocaine samples seized in the United States in 2016 and subject to laboratory analysis were 
of Colombian origin.  
 
B.  Drug Control Accomplishments, Policies, and Trends 
 
1. Institutional Development 
 
Despite signing a historic peace accord with the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia 
(FARC) that set in motion a disarmament, demobilization, and reintegration process for FARC 
ex-combatants, the Colombian government continues to have difficulty providing government 
services to Colombia’s neglected rural regions.  In 2015, the Government of Colombia 
announced a drug control strategy with three lines of effort:  rural development programs to 
reduce drug cultivation; law enforcement to dismantle organized crime groups; and public health 
approaches to address domestic drug consumption.  The Colombian government recognizes the 
illicit drug trade and the organized criminal groups it empowers are the greatest threats to peace 
and security in Colombia, and the 2015 drug control strategy constitutes a major component of 
its plan for the implementation of its 2016 peace accord with the FARC.  
 


INCSR 2018 Volume 1  
 
 
 
 
Country Reports 
137 
 
The Colombian government suspended aerial eradication of coca in October 2015, but conducts 
a forced manual eradication program that targets larger areas of cultivation known as “industrial 
plots,” cultivation in the national parks, and smaller coca cultivators that refuse to voluntarily 
eradicate their coca crops.  
 
With the shift in focus under the new strategy, the government maintains a strong interdiction 
and law enforcement focus by aggressively targeting organized criminal groups.  These efforts 
include: improved coordination among security forces on investigations and operations; 
enhanced initiatives to seize precursor chemicals used to produce cocaine; targeted anti-money 
laundering efforts; and legal reforms to facilitate the arrest, prosecution, and sentencing of 
members of organized criminal groups.  The extradition relationship between Colombia and the 
United States is robust and productive.  
 
 
2.  Supply Reduction 
 
The United States estimates the area devoted to coca cultivation in Colombia increased 18 
percent from 159,000 hectares (ha) in 2015 to 188,000 ha in 2016, surpassing cultivation levels 
last seen in 2007.  In 2016, the Department of Nariño became the leading source of coca 
cultivation in Colombia, with a more than a 50 percent increase to 39,500 ha.  Coca cultivation 
also experienced significant increases in the departments of Antioquia (to 18,000 ha, a 33 percent 
increase), Cauca (to 32,000 ha, an 18.5 percent increase), and Norte de Santander (to 36,000 ha, 
an 18 percent increase).  
 
Several factors contributed to the surge in coca cultivation in Colombia since 2013, including the 
end of aerial spraying and indications that FARC elements urged farmers to plant coca, 
purportedly to take advantage of the Colombian government’s peace accord coca crop 
substitution program.  Furthermore, counter-eradication tactics employed by coca growers have 
impeded the government’s manual eradication efforts, including blocking eradicators from 
accessing fields; placing improvised explosive devices in coca fields to kill, injure, and 
demoralize eradicators and slow eradication operations; and planting fields in inaccessible areas, 
including national parks, indigenous areas, and remote regions.  
 
The Colombian Ministry of Defense reports that police and military forces have forcibly 
manually eradicated 50,100 ha of coca through December 6, 2017, which was more than double 
the amount forcibly eradicated during 2016 and exceeded the Colombian government’s 50,000 
ha goal for 2017.  The United States estimates that 1,100 ha of opium poppy were under 
cultivation in Colombia in 2015, the most recent year for which data is available.  
 
Colombia continued to make drug interdiction one of its drug control priorities, linking it to a 
stable post-peace accord environment, the extension of citizen security and rule of law 
throughout Colombia, and the countering of illegal armed groups that have plagued Colombia for 
decades.  Colombian authorities reported seizing approximately 390 MT of pure cocaine and 
cocaine base during the first 10 months of 2017, as well as 197 MT of marijuana, and 348 
kilograms of heroin, and destroyed 3,186 cocaine base laboratories and 248 cocaine 
hydrochloride (HCl) laboratories.

3.  Public Information, Prevention, and Treatment 
 
There are indications that drug use has increased among Colombian youth, with marijuana the 
substance of choice.  Use of inhalants and a cocaine by-product called “basuco” is high among 
those displaced by years of internal conflict in Colombia.   
 
In 2015, Colombia reevaluated its approach to drug demand reduction.  It de-criminalized and 
regulated the production, possession, and use of marijuana for medical purposes.  It launched a 
new national demand reduction plan for 2015 – 2021, which addresses consumption as a 
preventable and treatable public health issue instead of as a criminal matter.  Acknowledging 
severe criminal sanctions disproportionately impact the most vulnerable in the drug-trafficking 
chain and contribute to prison overcrowding, the Colombian government is exploring 
alternatives to incarceration, especially within the juvenile justice system.  The Colombian 
government created a juvenile drug court in Medellin and is planning juvenile drug courts in 
three other departments.  Colombia focuses treatment on youth substance abusers.  The 
Colombian government is also working to expand restorative justice programs and programs that 
teach life, leadership, and cultural skills to youth treatment and detention centers.  The 
Colombian government will soon begin training treatment professionals in the U.S.-developed 
treatment and prevention curriculum.  
 
The Colombian National Police has a prevention unit of 2,000 instructors who teach drug use 
prevention to vulnerable school children nationwide. 
 
 
4.  Corruption 
 
As a matter of policy, the Government of Colombia does not encourage or facilitate illicit drug 
production or distribution, nor the laundering of proceeds of illicit drugs.  Colombia’s 
independent attorney general and inspector general have both publicly identified anti-corruption 
efforts as a priority for their institutions.  A series of high-profile corruption scandals in 2017 
revealed serious institutional vulnerabilities, including in the justice sector, though they also 
demonstrated the government’s willingness to pursue corruption cases wherever they may lead, 
and a political climate that increasingly enables such sensitive prosecutions. 
 
Despite stated government interest in strengthening the capabilities of its institutions against 
corruption, it faces challenges effectively implementing the 2011 anti-corruption statute, 
including difficulty securing strong penalties.  Of 2,458 sanctions issued for public corruption 
since 2011, one quarter resulted in imprisonment, one quarter involved house arrest, and half did 
not receive any detention.  In 2016, the number of criminal sanctions for public corruption 
increased more than 45 percent compared to 2012, the first year of application of the anti-
corruption statute. 
 
Notwithstanding the challenges, the Colombian government has made significant strides in 
implementing its 2013 anti-corruption strategy to improve transparency of, and public 
confidence in, government institutions.  The Secretary for Transparency estimated the 
government was close to meeting 80 percent of its commitments under this strategy.  The 2014 
transparency and access to public information law was implemented in 2016, requiring all 


INCSR 2018 Volume 1  
 
 
 
 
Country Reports 
139 
 
government entities to release information pertaining to salaries, management evaluations, the 
hiring processes, and the public budget. 
 
Additionally, the Colombian government made efforts to build inter-agency partnerships that 
address corruption, such as the creation of the Anti-Corruption Coordination Committee, 
comprised of the Colombian National Police (CNP), the Financial Information and Analysis 
Unit, and the office of the president.  
 
C.  National Goals, Bilateral Cooperation, and U.S. Policy Initiatives 
 
The United States provides counter-drug assistance to the CNP, the Colombian military, and 
judicial institutions that investigate, prosecute, and incarcerate drug traffickers, including the 
offices of the attorney general and inspector general, the judiciary, and the corrections system.   
 
The United States supports programs designed to expand Colombia’s rural policing capabilities 
and enable the transition of rural communities out of coca-based economies by expanding the 
presence of the state in post-conflict regions, strengthening licit market linkages, and promoting 
the rule of law and protection of human rights.  The United States supports the Government of 
Colombia’s deployment of Strategic Operational Centers (“CEOs” in Spanish) comprising 
security forces and civilian government agencies to coordinate voluntary and forced eradication 
programs and improve rural security.  CEOs also support interdiction efforts against drug 
trafficking organizations with a focus on high-value targets, and increase access to government 
services and economic opportunities.  In conflict-affected areas where the Colombian 
government has only established minimum security, the United States works with Colombian 
government institutions to respond rapidly to community-identified needs, strengthen local 
institutions and security presence, develop social capital and encourage greater civil-society 
participation, promote land restitution and formalization, and support longer-term economic 
development opportunities.   
 
Through the U.S.-Colombia Action Plan on Regional Security Cooperation, Colombia’s security 
forces export law enforcement capabilities and build regional connections by training Central 
America and the Caribbean counterparts in countering transnational organized crime and drug 
trafficking.  The Action Plan expanded to include more than 341 activities in six countries during 
2016.  Bilateral maritime counterdrug cooperation, exercised under the ship-boarding agreement 
signed in 1997, continues to be one of the most effective in the region, enabling the seizure of 
over 146 MT of cocaine in 2016.  
 
D.  Conclusion 
 
Colombia continues to take steps to combat the drug trade.  These efforts prevent hundreds of 
metric tons of drugs from reaching the United States each year.  The United States government 
believes Colombia’s current drug control strategy can have a lasting impact in curbing coca 
cultivation and cocaine production if the Government of Colombia properly resources the 
strategy; improves coordination between security forces and civilian programs; implements 
enhanced eradication efforts in areas of high coca growth, including areas previously off-limits 
to forced eradication; develops and implements a strategy to deal with coca growers who disrupt

law enforcement officials’ access to coca fields; and re-doubles its commitment to use 
extradition as a tool against individuals involved in drug trafficking.   
 
As stated in the Presidential Determination on Major Drug Transit or Major Illicit Drug 
Producing Countries for Fiscal Year 2018, the U.S. government will continue to closely monitor 
implementation of Colombia’s drug control strategy to ensure progress is made in reducing coca 
cultivation and the production of cocaine.

Costa Rica 
 
A.  Introduction 
 
Costa Rica’s strategic location, vast maritime territory, and the small size of its security forces 
combine to make it an attractive transit and logistics hub for illicit drug trafficking.  In 2017, 
U.S. authorities estimated Costa Rica was among the most heavily transited countries for cocaine 
shipments entering the United States.  During the first 10 months of 2017, Costa Rican 
authorities seized a total of 22.4 metric tons (MT) of cocaine, on par with 2016.  Bulk cash 
seizures from drug proceeds totaled over $26 million over this same period, a three-fold increase 
from 2016. 
 
Though low for the region, the total number of homicides in Costa Rica was on pace to surpass 
600 in 2017, overtaking the record 577 homicides in 2016.  Continued turf-war related shootings 
and cartel-style assassinations have exacerbated heightened public concern and intensified the 
Costa Rican government’s sharp focus on the fight against illicit drug trafficking.  
 
The government significantly increased its security spending in 2017, resulting in important 
increases in law enforcement staffing and transformational equipment purchases.  Institutional 
reforms enabled increased police professionalization, major advances in investigations and 
prosecutions, and improved success in drug interdiction and disruption of drug trafficking 
organizations, as well as drug prevention programs.   
 
B.  Drug Control Accomplishments, Policies, and Trends 
 
 
1.  Institutional Development  
 
Costa Rica enacted encouraging institutional changes in 2017 to combat the heightened threats 
from illicit drugs.  The Ministry of Public Security’s (MPS) budget increased by 11 percent in 
2017, and a reinstated security tax on companies provided a new annual stream of extra-
budgetary resources for law enforcement.  These new resources allowed the hiring of 1,500 new 
police (over 10 percent of the current force) in 2017; another 1,000 officers are scheduled to be 
added in 2018.  Additional personnel increases are also scheduled by mid-2018 for the Coast 
Guard (SNG, by 30 percent); the Border Police (by 20 percent); and the Air Surveillance Service 
(SVA, by 10 percent).  The Specialized Counter Drug Police (PCD) are also in line for more 
officers.  This represents a significant jump in the capacity of the Costa Rican entities 
responsible for the majority drug seizures.  
 
The government continued important police professionalization efforts in 2017, including 
construction of a new police academy, upgrades in the tactical training sites, and began 
additional cooperation between national law enforcement agencies and those of local 
governments. 
 
The reinstated security tax will also allow investment in new capabilities.  The government is 
using the 2017 funds to purchase the country’s first maritime patrol aircraft ($7.5 million).  Costa 
Rica used its own funds to initiate a $9 million purchase from the United States of four highly-

capable patrol boats for its Coast Guard, and has plans in place to purchase radar and other key 
enablers to address an increasing number of illicit flights suspected of trafficking drugs and 
money. 
 
The SNG remained a highly effective regional partner for maritime interdiction, including via 
joint patrols with the U.S. Coast Guard (USCG).  The SNG increased staffing, training and 
maintenance capacity to prepare for the scheduled April 2018 arrival of two 110-foot cutters 
donated by the United States.   
 
The Costa Rican Judicial Investigative Police (OIJ) established a new Organized Crime Section 
in 2017.  The section’s leadership seeks additional opportunities to build its capacity in 
cooperation with the United States and implemented a heavy schedule of U.S.-provided training 
in 2017.  After two years of intensive efforts to strengthen its investigatory capacity, in October 
2017 the Costa Rican National Forensics lab received international accreditation for chemical 
analysis, toxicology, and biochemistry (including DNA testing); the lab is working toward 
accreditation in ballistics in 2018.  The lab is the first in Central America to attain this top-level 
rating and only the third in the Latin America (joining labs in Chile and Mexico).   
 
The five-year old Border Police improved control of Costa Rica’s porous land border with 
Panama, including through expanded use of biometrics and cooperation with Panama.  The Air 
Surveillance Service (SVA) pushed to better control its airspace with additional radar, training 
and operations capacity.  SVA’s support for the Coast Guard will expand significantly in 2018 
with acquisition of the maritime patrol aircraft and improved capability for night operations.  
After a favorable constitutional court ruling, the government expanded use of the Judicial Wire 
Intercept Program (JWIP) in 2017, resulting in notable convictions.  For example, largely based 
on JWIP intercepts, Costa Rican prosecutors convicted a Sinaloa Cartel-affiliated trafficking 
network estimated to have trafficked more than 70 MT of cocaine.   
 
 
2.  Supply Reduction 
 
During the first 10 months of 2017, Costa Rica seized 22.4 MT of cocaine, on course to match 
the volume confiscated in 2016.   In addition, the Costa Rican government, working closely with 
the U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration and regional partners, reported disrupting 22 
international drug trafficking rings in Costa Rica in 2017. 
 
Costa Rica is a regional leader in eradicating and seizing cannabis.  During the first 10 months of 
2017, Costa Rican authorities destroyed 1.5 million cannabis plants and seized an additional 5.2 
MT of loose marijuana.  Local marijuana is produced primarily for domestic use, and additional 
volumes of marijuana are trafficked into the country from Jamaica.  To combat a growing 
cocaine-for-marijuana/arms trade between Jamaica and Costa Rica, the SNG is purchasing more 
capable boats to deploy in the Caribbean. 
 
The Costa Rican government expanded cooperation on maritime interdiction and information 
exchange with Panama and Colombia in 2017, and initiated contacts with Jamaica.  A diplomatic 
push to gain more adherents to the San Jose Treaty – which facilitates information exchange and 
cooperation on interdiction operations in the Caribbean area – gained momentum in late 2017.

Seizure totals of illegal drugs other than cocaine and marijuana, including synthetic drugs, 
remained minimal in 2017.  For example, only seven kilograms of heroin were seized in Costa 
Rica through October 2017.  OIJ and the Costa Rican Drug Institute monitor for signs of 
synthetic drugs in Costa Rica, which remain rare. 
 
 
3.  Public Information, Prevention, and Treatment 
 
The production, trafficking, and sale of illicit drugs remain serious criminal offenses in Costa 
Rica, even if laws against personal consumption are rarely enforced.  The Costa Rican Drug 
Institute oversees government drug prevention programs, including publicity campaigns and 
materials for schools.  The Institute on Alcohol and Drug Abuse offers treatment and prevention 
programs, though considerable gaps remain.  With the uptick in violence, the MPS increasingly 
focuses on prevention programs.  The National Police implement the Drug Abuse Resistance and 
Education (DARE) program and the Gang Resistance Education and Training (GREAT) 
program.  GREAT began in August 2013, and has grown from 800 graduates in 2014 to over 
12,000 in 2017. 
 
 
4.  Corruption 
 
The Costa Rican government does not, as a matter of government policy, encourage or facilitate 
illicit drug production or distribution, nor is it involved in laundering the proceeds of the sale of 
illicit drugs.  The growing presence of transnational criminal organizations and the harm they 
inflict on Costa Rican society, including corruption, is a chief concern.  The government 
generally implements a 2006 law that penalizes official corruption; however, there are frequent 
reports of low- and mid-level corruption, and periodic cases of high-level corruption.  The Costa 
Rican government estimates about seven percent of the country’s GDP is lost to corruption.   
 
The new Chief Justice of the Supreme Court approved and launched in November a two-year 
effort to strengthen ethics controls within the judiciary.  The United States actively supports 
efforts to stem corruption.  A corruption and influence peddling scandal that broke in July 2017 
triggered investigations and suspensions of officials – across the three branches of government 
and a state-owned bank – who may have aided a cement importer in obtaining large loans 
without collateral, and receiving import permits among other benefits.  The Attorney General, 
the banking sector supervisor, and the National Assembly are pursuing three separate sets of 
legal proceedings as a result of this scandal.    
 
C.  National Goals, Bilateral Cooperation, and U.S. Policy Initiatives 
 
Costa Rica shares the U.S. priorities of disrupting the flow of illicit drugs and dismantling 
organized crime.  The United States supports Costa Rican efforts to investigate and prosecute 
crimes more effectively, to make its borders more secure, and to increase the safety of its 
citizens, consistent with the Central America Regional Security Initiative (CARSI). 
 
The United States supports police professionalization through a range of training, police 
academy reform, and expanded tactical training capacity.  In 2017, MPS began implementing in 


INCSR 2018 Volume 1  
 
 
 
 
Country Reports 
144 
 
15 pilot municipalities an intelligence-based citizen security initiative (AISEC) based on the 
Colombian model designed to expand cooperation between law enforcement and local 
government to enhance citizen security.  Central to implementation of AISEC is the National 
Police’s expansion of the police intelligence platform (SIMEP) and COMPSTAT crime-tracking 
system developed with U.S. assistance.  The result is a whole-of-government preventative effort 
focused on addressing the drivers of insecurity and criminality in Costa Rica’s most problematic 
neighborhoods.  Costa Rica plans to expand AISEC to all 82 municipalities in 2018.  
 
In the justice sector, the United States supports training programs for investigators, prosecutors, 
and judges on a broad range of topics, including trafficking in persons, money laundering, and 
undercover operations.  In 2017, this led to the publishing of specialized manuals for the 
investigation of drug trafficking and organized crime.  The United States supports a highly-
successful restorative juvenile justice program, the second phase of which will be launched in 
early 2018.   
 
The United States continues to support Costa Rican efforts to further strengthen the SNG and 
SVA’s interdiction capabilities, providing boats with greater reach, a ground-based radar, 
equipment, training, and professional exchanges.  These increasingly professional and capable 
forces are willing partners with still greater potential. 
 
A U.S.-supported Maritime Interdiction Vetted Unit (MIVU) comprised of representatives from 
a specialized law enforcement unit and the SNG was organizationally revamped in 2016, 
retooled with new and better equipment in 2017, and will expand to two units in early 2018.  The 
MIVU, for the second year in a row, netted 20 percent of total cocaine interdictions during the 
first 10 months of 2017.  
 
The United States maintains a bilateral agreement with Costa Rica to suppress illicit traffic by 
sea, which include provisions regarding ship boarding, shipriders, pursuit, entry into territorial 
waters, overflight, order to land, and international maritime interdiction support.  Costa Rica 
participated in the semi-annual Multilateral Maritime Counter Drug Summit held in November 
2017, which attracted 125 maritime counterdrug professionals from nearly 25 countries and over 
65 international agencies spanning North, Central and South America, and Europe.    
 
D.  Conclusion 
 
Costa Rica took a sizeable step forward in 2017 in its efforts to strengthen its ability to combat 
drug trafficking and tackle the rising presence of transnational criminal organizations.  In 
addition to key investments in human capital and equipment, the government’s enactment of a 
security tax will provide an annual source of resources dedicated to security.  That said, Costa 
Rica must maintain its planned security sector growth over 2018 and beyond if it hopes to keep 
up with the rapid increase in drug flows and associated criminality now permeating its territory.   
 
Top priorities for increasing effectiveness and efficiency should continue to include:  1) 
professionalizing police and judicial institutions, with an emphasis on anti-corruption; 2) 
augmenting the use of advanced investigative techniques aimed at organized crime; 3) further 
investment in border security, to include Border and Custom’s Police, and the continued build-up

of the Coast Guard and Air Surveillance Service capabilities to control the country’s sovereign 
territory; and 4) passing laws that specifically target organized crime and its proceeds.  Finally, 
Costa Rica should continue to strengthen its cooperation with regional partners.  Its successful 
engagement with Panama and Colombia, for example, has already yielded results and holds great 
potential.

Cuba 
 
Despite its location between the largest exporters of illegal drugs in the hemisphere and the U.S. 
market, Cuba is not a major consumer, producer, or transit point of illicit drugs.  Cuba’s 
domestic production and consumption remain low due to active policing, strict sentencing, and 
nationwide prevention and public information programs.  Cuba’s intensive security presence and 
interdiction efforts have kept supply down and prevented traffickers from establishing a 
foothold.  Cuba concentrates supply reduction efforts on preventing smuggling through territorial 
waters, rapidly collecting abandoned drugs found washed up on coastal shores, and conducting 
thorough airport searches.  Cuba dedicates significant resources to prevent illegal drugs and their 
use from spreading, and regional traffickers typically avoid Cuba. 
 
The most recent maritime seizure statistics cover 2016, during which the Cuban government 
seized 2.72 metric tons (MT) of illicit drugs (2.5 MT of marijuana and 225 kilograms (kg) of 
cocaine) and detected the territorial incursion of 35 suspect “go-fast” boats.  While most 
maritime seizures are found washed up on the shores of Cuba’s southeastern coast, Cuban 
authorities reported an increase in drugs found washed up on shores in the western provinces of 
Pinar del Rio and Isla Juventud.  Cuban customs reported seizing a total of 32 kg of illicit drugs 
during the first six months of 2017, the majority in the possession of arriving tourists (small 
quantities for personal use).  In comparison, Cuban customs seized 30 kg of illicit drugs during 
calendar year 2016.  The United States and Cuba continue to hold expanded bilateral discussions 
on law enforcement and drug control cooperation.  Enhanced communication and cooperation 
between the United States, international partners, and Cuba, particularly in terms of real-time 
information-sharing, would likely lead to increased interdictions and disruptions of illegal drug 
trafficking. 
 
With respect to international cooperation, the Cuban government reports 40 bilateral agreements 
for counterdrug cooperation, including the U.S.-Cuba counternarcotics arrangement (signed in 
July 2016).  The U.S. Embassy maintains a U.S. Coast Guard (USCG) liaison to coordinate with 
Cuban law enforcement.  USCG and Cuban authorities share tactical information related to boats 
transiting Cuban territorial waters suspected of trafficking and coordinate responses between 
operational command centers.  In addition, the U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) 
established direct communications with Cuba’s National Anti-drug Directorate in July 2016.  
Since then, DEA has received approximately 20 requests for information related to drug 
investigations, as well as cooperation leading to Cuba’s successful arrest of a fugitive wanted in 
the United States. 
 
Cuba has not yet demonstrated a willingness to turn over certain U.S. fugitives of high interest.  
However, within the context of the U.S.-Cuba Law Enforcement Dialogue, Cuba and the United 
States have reestablished communication between the national central authorities of both 
countries, which has greatly enhanced bilateral cooperation in the law enforcement area.  Cuba 
has provided assistance to U.S. state and federal prosecutions by providing evidence and 
information.  Cuba continues to demonstrate a willingness to cooperate on law enforcement 
matters.

Dominican Republic 
 
A.  Introduction 
 
The Dominican Republic is an important transit country for illicit drugs from South America 
destined for North America and Europe.  The Dominican Republic is the top transshipment hub 
for cocaine passing through the Caribbean, and the U.S. government estimates approximately six 
percent of the cocaine bound for North America and Europe transits through the Dominican 
Republic.  Maritime routes, involving the use of “go-fast” boats and commercial containers, 
continue to be the primary method of smuggling drugs into and out of the country.  The country 
is experiencing an increase in drug-related violence, especially as local groups engage in violent 
turf battles to control domestic drug distribution. 
 
To combat the influence of drug traffickers, the Dominican Republic continued its cooperation 
with the U.S. government in 2017 to interdict illicit drug shipments and extradite criminals.  The 
United States works actively with the Dominican Republic to plan and conduct international 
operations to seize illicit drugs and dismantle criminal organizations; however, corruption 
continues to hamper these efforts.  The Dominican government conducts outreach efforts to warn 
youth about the dangers of drugs. 
 
B.  Drug Control Accomplishments, Policies, and Trends 
 
1. Institutional Development 
 
Cooperation remains strong between the Dominican and U.S. governments to combat drug 
trafficking and related transnational crime.  The U.S. government’s primary partners are the 
National Directorate for the Control of Drugs (DNCD); the Dominican National Police (DNP); 
the National Council on Drugs (CND); the Office of the Attorney General; the National 
Intelligence Directorate (DNI); and the Dominican Armed Forces.  The Dominican Specialized 
Corps for Port Security, working in conjunction with U.S. authorities and private port operators, 
continued efforts to improve security at key ports.  The participation of the Dominican 
government in the Cooperative Situational Information Integration system, the Caribbean Basin 
Security Initiative (CBSI), and the Central America Integration System (SICA) enhanced 
relations with the United States and regional Caribbean partners.  Dominican authorities 
continued joint efforts with the Haitian National Police to exchange information by establishing 
liaison officers in their respective headquarters.  
 
The Dominican Republic is a party to the Inter-American Convention against Corruption.  In 
1985, the United States and the Dominican Republic signed an agreement on international 
narcotics control cooperation.  The Dominican Republic signed and ratified the Caribbean 
Regional Maritime Agreement and has a maritime counter-drug agreement with the United 
States that entered into force in 1995.  The United States and the Dominican Republic signed an 
extradition treaty in 2015 that entered into force in December 2016, replacing the 1909 treaty, 
and provides for extradition on a much broader scope of crimes.  In 2012, the United States and 
the Dominican Republic entered into a Permanent Forfeited Asset-Sharing Agreement.  To date, 
approximately $4 million in assets have been shared under this agreement. 


INCSR 2018 Volume 1  
 
 
 
 
Country Reports 
148 
 
 
The Dominican Republic continues to be one of the most active extradition partners in the world 
for the United States.  Although there is no formal bilateral mutual legal assistance treaty 
between the Dominican Republic and the United States, requests for legal assistance are made 
through informal channels and formal means pursuant to multilateral law enforcement 
cooperation treaties and conventions to which the United States and the Dominican Republic are 
parties.  The Dominican Republic processes U.S. requests for legal and judicial assistance in a 
timely manner. 
 
2. Supply Reduction 
 
Illicit drugs are seized throughout the country, but the majority of seizures are made through 
operations targeting vessels from South America.  During the first nine months of 2017, 10.1 
metric tons (MT) of cocaine were seized directly by Dominican forces within the territory of the 
Dominican Republic.  The Dominican government contributed to the seizure of over two MT of 
drugs entering and exiting the Dominican Republic by U.S. authorities and other international 
partners.  On April 30, Dominican authorities, in conjunction with U.S. law enforcement 
agencies, seized five clandestine laboratories that were producing fentanyl from precursor 
chemicals.  This marks the first time that such facilities have been found in the Dominican 
Republic.   
 
Illicit drugs remain available for local consumption and are transshipped to the United States and 
Europe, primarily through maritime routes.  The DNCD and Dominican military continue to 
cooperate with the United States and international partners in planning and conducting 
operations to interdict “go-fast” vessels attempting to deliver illicit narcotics to the southern 
coast, as well as to interdict drugs exiting the Dominican Republic.  One Dominican port, 
Caucedo, is certified under the Container Security Initiative (CSI), a U.S. initiative to help 
increase security for maritime containerized cargo shipped to the United States.  However, the 
other 15 Dominican ports, including Rio Haina, the other major Dominican port handling 
container traffic destined for the United States, are not CSI certified.  The DNCD is increasing 
efforts to combat contraband at the ports. 
 
3. Public Information, Prevention, and Treatment 
 
Local drug use is concentrated in tourist centers and major metropolitan areas, although drug use 
and associated violence occurs throughout the country.  The CND conducted demand reduction 
efforts in 2017 to warn Dominican youth of the negative effects of illicit drug use under the 
Strategic National University Plan on the Prevention and Use of Drugs.  The DNP promoted 
community-based policing as an effective way to deal with crime locally.  With the publication 
of its Community Policing manual, the DNP began outreach at the command level to implement 
community policing concepts more fully in the capital and other major population centers around 
the country. 
 
4. Corruption 
 


INCSR 2018 Volume 1  
 
 
 
 
Country Reports 
149 
 
As a matter of policy, the Dominican government does not encourage or facilitate illicit drug 
production or distribution, nor is it involved in laundering the proceeds of the sale of illicit drugs.  
However, corruption remains endemic.  The Government of the Dominican Republic has taken 
some steps to address corruption among military and law enforcement forces, but corruption 
remains a significant impediment to law enforcement efforts in the country and prosecution of 
corrupt high-level officials is not the norm.  The judiciary is politicized and riddled with 
corruption, and the legal system offers little recourse to those who lack money or influence. 
 
In early 2017, a popular movement, called the Green Movement, developed in response to the 
increased perception of corruption in the government.  The movement was spurred into action by 
the release of information that Brazilian company Odebrecht admitted to paying $92 million in 
bribes in the Dominican Republic.  The ensuing investigation led the Attorney General to bring 
charges against 14 individuals, including a sitting minister.  However, the case remains pending 
and none of the accused was detained at year’s end.  Other anti-corruption investigations have 
been initiated against both elected and appointed officials in the executive, Congress, and the 
judiciary but there have been no convictions in these cases to date. 
  
C.  National Goals, Bilateral Cooperation, and U. S. Policy Initiatives 
 
The United States supports a wide range of efforts designed to address crime and violence 
affecting Dominican citizens, primarily through CBSI.  With CBSI funds, the United States 
government implements programs designed to enhance existing Dominican law enforcement 
capabilities by improving technical and professional abilities to conduct investigations, to enable 
effective prosecution, and to coordinate and participate in drug control efforts with the United 
States and neighboring countries’ law enforcement agencies.  The U.S. law enforcement 
community has strong relationships with its Dominican colleagues, as evidenced by the high 
number of extraditions and deportations of fugitives to the United States. 
 
The United States provided equipment and training in 2017 to increase the capabilities of 
Dominican law enforcement entities, including support for the DNCD drug-detection canine 
units, and other specialized DNCD investigative and reactive units.  The United States enhanced 
DNCD’s computer training, database expansion, and systems maintenance support.  Dominican 
authorities work with neighboring countries to expand the use of a U.S.-supported canine facility 
as a regional training center.  The United States continues efforts to strengthen maritime 
capabilities through training in maritime law enforcement, search and rescue, port security, crisis 
management, and professional development for the Dominican Navy’s officer and enlisted corps.  
The United States provides tactical training, equipment, and other assistance to both the DNCD 
and Dominican military involved in illicit trafficking interdiction. 
 
The United States assists the DNP with its transformation into a professional, civilian-oriented 
organization by providing training at the entry and officer levels as well as technical assistance to 
strengthen strategic planning and communication, operations management and human resource 
systems.  Colombian National Police officers conducted over 50 training activities for DNP 
officers under the U.S.-funded Colombia Action Plan in 2017.   An additional 50 activities are 
planned for 2018 under this trilateral initiative.  The programs provided training for 
approximately 1,000 DNP officers of all ranks in 2017.  The Dominican legislature ratified a 


INCSR 2018 Volume 1  
 
 
 
 
Country Reports 
150 
 
Police Organic Law in 2016 that has the potential to bring about significant institutional 
improvements to the DNP if fully implemented.  The Dominican Republic continues to work 
towards passing legislative proposals related to illicit enrichment and anti-corruption by public 
officials.  Efforts to strengthen the infrastructure of the Financial Analysis Unit remain ongoing. 
 
The United States supports the Dominican Republic's efforts to establish a transparent and 
effective justice sector.  U.S. assistance promotes justice sector reforms by strengthening 
Dominican government capacity to manage and prosecute complex money laundering, fraud, 
public corruption, and illicit trafficking cases, as well as to establish internal controls to prevent 
corruption.  The United States works with the Offices of the Attorney General, Prosecutorial 
Training School, Judiciary, Public Ministry, Public Defense, Supreme Court of Justice, and 
Constitutional Tribunal.  These CBSI programs strengthen justice sector career, integrity, and 
accountability systems, and contribute to building the capacity of the national police and 
prosecutors to develop stronger cases and coordinate efforts leading to more successful 
prosecutions.  As part of CBSI, U.S. assistance strengthens Dominican civil society coalitions for 
citizen security and criminal justice reform, supports community justice houses which increase 
access to justice for vulnerable populations, and provides technical assistance for the 
implementation of the new organic law on police reform.  CBSI funds crime prevention 
programs that help at-risk youth pursue education, vocational training, and employment. 
 
D.  Conclusion 
 
Combating pervasive corruption, restoring public confidence in law enforcement, addressing 
illicit maritime drug smuggling, and confronting rising levels of drug-fueled violence are major 
challenges facing the Dominican Republic.  The Dominican Republic’s aerial and maritime 
interdiction efforts demonstrate institutional capacity and political will to help stem the flow of 
drugs into the country.  The Dominican government must continue to improve its efforts to build 
a coherent, multifaceted drug control program.  Key to that effort will be increased domestic 
cooperation between the DNP, DNCD, and military units, combined with greater cooperation 
with law enforcement agencies in other countries in the region.

Dutch Caribbean 
 
A.  Introduction 
 
The Dutch Caribbean consists of the six entities of the former Netherlands Antilles:  Aruba; 
Curacao; Sint Maarten; Bonaire; St. Eustatius; and Saba.  Curaçao, Sint Maarten, and Aruba 
have “autonomous” country status within the Kingdom of the Netherlands.  The three smallest 
islands – Bonaire, St. Eustatius, and Saba – are part of the country of the Netherlands. 
 
Aruba and Curacao are located 30 to 40 miles north of Venezuela and continue to serve as 
northbound transshipment points for cocaine originating from Colombia and transiting 
Venezuela.  Cocaine is transported via fishing boats and inter-coastal freighters for 
transshipment to the United States, other Caribbean islands, Africa, and Europe.  Sint Maarten, 
the Dutch half of the island of the same name (the French side is called Saint Martin), is located 
in the Eastern Caribbean and is a transshipment hub for cocaine, heroin, and marijuana destined 
for Puerto Rico, the U.S. Virgin Islands, and Europe. 
 
B.  Drug Control Accomplishments, Policies, and Trends 
 
 
1.  Institutional Development 
 
Aruba, Curaçao, and Sint Maarten have a high degree of autonomy over their internal affairs, 
with the right to exercise independent decision-making in a number of drug control areas.  The 
Kingdom of the Netherlands is responsible for the islands’ defense and foreign affairs, and 
assists the governments in their efforts to combat illicit drug trafficking through its support for 
the RST (Dutch acronym for “Special Police Task Force”).  Curacao, Aruba, and Sint Maarten 
have adopted the BOP (Dutch acronym for “law on special investigative techniques”), which 
governs the use of techniques such as electronic surveillance and the infiltration of criminal 
organizations by the police on those islands.  No new drug control programs were initiated in 
2017.  
 
In 2016, the United States, the Kingdom of the Netherlands, Aruba, Sint Maarten, and Curacao 
signed a memorandum of understanding regarding the enhancement of existing cooperation and 
strengthening of law enforcement and the criminal justice system in the Caribbean parts of the 
Kingdom of the Netherlands.  Among the shared law enforcement objectives being pursued 
under the memorandum are efforts to strengthen security at airport, harbors and cruise terminals 
to reduce drug trafficking.  
 
Aruba 
 
Aruba’s police force, the Korps Politie Aruba (KPA), continues to evolve into a regional leader 
in the fight against illicit drug trafficking and transnational criminal organizations.  The KPA is 
at the forefront in collecting and sharing intelligence with regional law enforcement partners.  
Despite systemic problems of prison overcrowding and insufficient resources, the KPA continues 
to investigate trafficking organizations effectively.

Curaçao 
 
Curacao has improved its effectiveness and efficiency in addressing endemic drug-related crime, 
violence, and corruption.  Currently, the Korps Politie Curaçao (KPC) is staffed with 
approximately 400 police officers.  In 2015, the KPC appointed a new police chief dedicated to 
enhancing the leadership and stability of the KPC, which in turn has led to continuing successful 
drug enforcement operations.   
 
St. Maarten 
 
Situated in close proximity to the U.S. Virgin Islands (approximately 100 nautical miles away) 
and Puerto Rico (approximately 200 nautical miles away), St. Maarten/St. Martin is a 
transshipment point for cocaine destined for the United States and Europe.  This small two-
nation island is a challenging place for law enforcement to combat drug trafficking, due in part to 
its separate legal jurisdictions.  In 2015, authorities in St. Maarten lifted the visa requirement for 
Colombian and Venezuelan nationals to travel to St. Maarten.  Colombian and Venezuelan drug 
trafficking organizations operating in St. Maarten/St. Martin mostly utilize Dominican nationals 
to transport large cocaine shipments, via “go-fast” vessels to the United States.  Many of the go-
fast vessels are stored at unlicensed marinas and boatyards located on the French side of St. 
Martin.   
 
According to the U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA), multi-ton quantities of cocaine 
are smuggled into Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin Islands, on a monthly basis.  In 2017, U.S. 
authorities worked effectively with the Korps Politie St. Maarten (KPSM), RST, and Dutch and 
French authorities to seize multi-ton quantities of cocaine destined for Puerto Rico and the U.S. 
Virgin Islands in international waters in the vicinity of St. Maarten/St. Martin. 
 
Bonaire, St. Eustatius, Saba 
 
The National Office for the Caribbean in the Netherlands Ministry of Interior Affairs and 
Kingdom Relations assumes the responsibilities of law enforcement, security, and other 
administrative functions on behalf of the Government of the Netherlands for Bonaire, St. 
Eustatius, and Saba. 
 
2. Supply Reduction 
 
Due to increased information sharing and cooperation between U.S. and Dutch Caribbean law 
enforcement agencies, the opportunity to further disrupt drug trafficking is improving.  
According to DEA reporting, in fiscal year 2017, Dutch Caribbean law enforcement agencies 
(often with U.S. law enforcement support) seized approximately1.9 metric tons (MT) of cocaine 
and approximately 1.22 MT of marijuana; arrested 51major drug traffickers; and seized 
approximately $18,709,978 in illicit assets from drug traffickers.  These statistics do not include 
drug seizures in international waters and seizures by the Royal Netherlands Navy.

United States military volunteers continue to conduct outreach to warn youth on the dangers of 
illicit drugs through ad hoc sports programs.  There is one drug treatment center on Curacao 
which is run by a non-governmental organization, but it is underfunded.  A second treatment 
center operates in Aruba.  Additionally, on Curacao both a shelter for persons suffering from 
substance use disorders and the local DARE program have been discontinued due to lack of 
funding.  Regionally, authorities have identified rehabilitation and treatment as a priority for 
future cooperation with the United States under the 2016 memorandum of understanding. 
 
4. Corruption 
 
None of the Dutch Caribbean countries encourage or facilitate illegal activity associated with 
drug trafficking, nor has any senior government official engaged in such activity, although a 
former Curacao prime minister’s conviction in 2017 for money laundering and fraud is being 
appealed. 
 
C.  National Goals, Bilateral Cooperation, and U.S. Policy Initiatives 
 
The objectives of U.S. drug control policy in the Dutch Caribbean are to promote cooperation 
between law enforcement and military partners, and to reduce illicit drug trafficking.  DEA 
works with their island counterparts to advance joint investigations, both within the Dutch 
Caribbean and the United States. 
 
The Kingdom of the Netherlands supports drug enforcement efforts by continuing to support 
U.S. Air Force Forward Operating Locations in Curaçao and Aruba.  U.S. military aircraft 
conduct detection and monitoring flights over the southern Caribbean Sea.  In addition, the Royal 
Netherlands Navy, as a member of the U.S. Joint Interagency Task Force South (JIATF-S) has 
the lead for JIATF-S drug interdiction operations in the central Caribbean.  The Navy regularly 
conducts interdiction operations in the region, and with the support from the U.S. Coast Guard, 
intercepted approximately two MT of cocaine and approximately 2.48 MT of other drugs during 
the first 10 months of 2017. 
 
The United States maintains bilateral agreements to suppress illicit traffic by sea with the Dutch 
Caribbean nations, which includes provisions regarding ship boarding, shiprider, pursuit, 
technical assistance, over flight, and order to land.   
 
D.  Conclusion 
 
Curaçao and Sint Maarten are still establishing counter-drug organizational structures among 
their various agencies.  It is imperative that both islands embrace regional cooperation and 
intelligence sharing efforts.  Both Curaçao and Sint Maarten can look to Aruba as an example of 
how this is accomplished.

Eastern Caribbean 
  
A.  Introduction 
  
The seven independent countries of Antigua and Barbuda, Barbados, Dominica, Grenada, St. 
Kitts and Nevis, St. Lucia, and St. Vincent and the Grenadines are collectively referred to in this 
report as the Eastern Caribbean (EC). 
 
The region hosts transshipment points for illicit drugs originating from South America and 
destined for North American, European, and Caribbean markets.  Local law enforcement 
agencies estimate that approximately 60 percent of the cocaine transiting the region is bound for 
Europe, while most of the remaining cocaine is ultimately destined for North America.  The 
majority of the marijuana produced in the region is trafficked for local consumption. 
 
Local and international law enforcement authorities believe traffickers are increasingly using 
yachts for drug transit, though “go-fast” boats, fishing trawlers, and cargo ships continue to play 
major transit roles.  Homicide rates and drug-related violent and non-violent crimes (including 
money laundering and bulk cash smuggling) increased throughout the region in 2017.  The 
majority of the homicides are likely a result of turf wars between organized criminal groups 
fighting for control of drug distribution.  Regional law enforcement entities report an increase of 
illicit trafficking in firearms from the United States, Trinidad and Tobago, and Venezuela, and 
see this development as one of the deadliest emerging trends. 
 
Nine consecutive years of declining macroeconomic growth leave EC law enforcement capacity 
increasingly beleaguered.  At the same time, some EC governments are taking steps to improve 
antiquated criminal codes.  In 2017, Antigua and Barbuda passed legislation to require 
mandatory prison sentences for firearm offenses.  St. Lucia is poised to introduce legislation to 
enable special investigative measures, ensure witness anonymity, and enable authorized 
electronic monitoring in early 2018.  However, in some countries, leaders failed to address 
public concerns about official corruption. 
 
B.  Drug Control Accomplishments, Policies, and Trends  
  
 
1.  Institutional Development 
  
The EC countries are parties to the Inter-American Convention Against the Illicit Manufacturing 
of and Trafficking in Firearms, Ammunition, Explosives and Other Related Materials.  All have 
an extradition treaty and a mutual legal assistance treaty in force with the United States.  Several 
are signatories to Inter-American Conventions such as the Convention Against Corruption, the 
Convention on Extradition, the Convention on Mutual Assistance in Criminal Matters, and the 
Convention Against Terrorism.  
 
The United States and Canada completed an $11.25 million refurbishment of the Regional 
Security System’s (RSS) two Maritime Patrol Aircraft in August 2016.  The RSS is a treaty-
based collective defense organization of which the seven EC countries are members, which is 
under-resourced.  These aircraft are used to interdict drug shipments and continue to produce

quantifiable results, including the interruption of many drug trafficking operations and resultant 
arrests of dozens of drug traffickers in 2017.  Grenada, St. Vincent and the Grenadines, Antigua 
and Barbuda, and Dominica have laws that facilitate the prosecution of illicit drug cases, 
including comprehensive civil asset forfeiture laws with a dedicated forfeiture fund to attack 
transnational organized crime by seizing illicit assets.  The laws require forfeited funds are 
channeled to support police, prosecutors, RSS contributions, victim restitution, and drug abuse 
prevention and treatment.  All regional police forces have dedicated drug squads, and several 
receive support from the U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA).  The Antiguan 
Government established a Drug Information Network of Antigua and Barbuda in 2016 for the 
purposes of monitoring drug trends, developing policy, and implementing appropriate solutions. 
  
 
2.  Supply Reduction 
  
Venezuela-based drug traffickers use the region’s many uninhabited islands to move cocaine 
shipments up the island chain for onward transit to North America and Europe.  Cannabis 
cultivation occurs in the mountainous regions of St. Vincent, St. Lucia, Grenada, and Dominica, 
and cultivation appeared to increase on Antigua and Barbuda in 2017.  St. Vincent continues to 
be a primary source for cannabis in the Eastern Caribbean.  Almost all countries in the EC report 
growing traffic from Colombia of a form of cannabis with elevated THC levels known locally as 
“creepy.”   
 
Barbados authorities reported a reduction in maritime seizures during 2017, though it remains 
unclear if this suggests a reduced flow of drugs via Barbados or increased sophistication of 
traffickers in evading detection.  For two years in a row, the St. Vincent Drug Squad reported an 
increase in the transshipment of cocaine from Venezuela, Trinidad and Tobago, and to a lesser 
extent, Colombia.  These shipments involve the use of “mother vessels” that remain off-shore 
(50 nautical miles or beyond), which offload smaller loads of cocaine typically ranging from 
between 20 and 200 kilograms (kg) to local boats.  Traffickers have also been detected 
intermixing shipments of cocaine on boats transporting local produce and construction material 
to northern Caribbean islands.  
 
During the first nine months of 2017, drug seizures in the Eastern Caribbean totaled 658.18 kg of 
cocaine and 267 metric tons of marijuana, according to data shared by local governments with 
DEA.  In the same time period, there were 194 arrests in connection with drug trafficking, and 
the seizure of $1.3 million in illicit drug proceeds.  Although there were some seizures of 
synthetic drugs, the small quantities involved do not represent a new consumption trend. 
  
 
3.  Public Information, Prevention, and Treatment 
  
The region’s drug of choice is marijuana, although abuse of over-the-counter pharmaceutical 
drugs is on the rise.  According to statistics provided by local government entities, almost 90 
percent of the marijuana transiting through the region is for local consumption.  The Government 
of Barbados operates an active Drug Treatment Court.  St. Kitts and Nevis has several programs 
credited by its officials as successful.  Grenada operates several drug treatment programs through 
its Drug Control Secretariat.  Barbados, Grenada, and St. Lucia have drug rehabilitation clinics, 
and Barbados has one that specifically serves youth.

4.  Corruption 
  
As a matter of policy, the region’s governments do not encourage or facilitate the illicit 
production or distribution of narcotic or psychotropic drugs or other controlled substances, or the 
laundering of proceeds from illegal drug transactions.  No senior government officials in the 
Eastern Caribbean were prosecuted for engaging in or facilitating the illicit production or 
distribution of controlled drugs or laundering of proceeds from illegal drug transactions.  
Nonetheless, many observers believe that drug trafficking organizations sometimes elude law 
enforcement through bribery, influence, or coercion. 
 
The United States funded the establishment of an RSS Polygraph Corps in 2014, which certified 
25 polygraphists in the Eastern Caribbean that year.  Regional governments use the corps of 
polygraphists to monitor sensitive police and other institutions.  Eastern Caribbean governments 
have established bilateral agreements allowing polygraph examiners from one EC country to 
conduct polygraph examinations in another EC country. 
  
C.  National Goals, Bilateral Cooperation, and U.S. Policy Initiatives 
  
The United States supports a wide range of efforts designed to address crime and violence 
affecting EC citizens, primarily through the Caribbean Basin Security Initiative (CBSI).  CBSI is 
a security partnership between the United States and Caribbean nations that seeks to substantially 
reduce illicit trafficking, advance public safety and citizen security, and promote justice.  CBSI 
programming in the Eastern Caribbean strengthens the capacity of law enforcement institutions 
to detect, interdict, prosecute, convict, and incarcerate criminals.  The programs support 
information sharing networks, joint interagency operations, and regional training initiatives to 
promote interoperability. 
 
CBSI projects are also underway in maritime and aerial domain awareness; criminal justice 
reform; preventing financial crimes; reducing demand for illegal drugs; and reducing illicit 
trafficking of firearms.  The EC governments and RSS participate fully in CBSI.   
 
The United States maintains bilateral agreements to suppress illicit traffic by sea with Antigua 
and Barbuda, Barbados, Dominica, Grenada, St. Kitts and Nevis, St. Lucia, and St. Vincent and 
the Grenadines, which include provisions regarding ship boarding, shipriders, pursuit, entry into 
territorial waters, overflight, and order to land.  These countries participated in the annual 
Multilateral Maritime Interdiction and Prosecution Summit held in July 2017, which attracted 
maritime counterdrug professionals from various central and eastern Caribbean nations. 
 
D.  Conclusion 
  
The United States encourages the countries of the Eastern Caribbean to continue to embrace 
CBSI partnership and to fulfill their budgetary commitments to the RSS.  The United States also 
encourages the Eastern Caribbean countries to support programming to increase regional drug 
enforcement operations and build regional capacity, through joint training and cooperation.  The

United States further encourages the seven countries to continue to pass legislation to modernize 
their criminal codes, making use of regional best practices in fighting transnational 
organized crime.

Ecuador 
 
A.  Introduction 
  
Situated between two of the world’s largest cocaine producing countries, Ecuador is a major 
transit country for illicit drugs.  Cocaine and heroin from Colombia and Peru are trafficked 
through porous land borders and via maritime routes for distribution to the United States and 
Europe.  While not a major drug producing country, Ecuador is a major transit country for 
chemical precursors to process illegal narcotics and is vulnerable to transnational organized 
crime due to permeable borders and corruption.  While committed to combatting drug 
trafficking, Ecuador’s police, military, and judiciary lack sufficient resources to confront 
transnational criminal challenges.  
 
The new administration of President Lenín Moreno, who took office in May 2017, is committed 
to reducing both drug supply and drug demand, including addressing the public health aspect of 
the issue.  Domestic drug consumption is rising and public treatment facilities are insufficient to 
treat the country’s population with substance use disorders.  The growing drug consumption 
problem was compounded by a 2014 law that decriminalized personal use, possession, and 
consumption of small quantities of most narcotics, hallucinogens, and stimulants.  
  
B.  Drug Control Accomplishments, Policies, and Trends 
  
1.  Institutional Development 
  
The Ecuadorian government is cognizant of the detrimental effects of drug trafficking and 
transnational organized crime throughout the country.  However, during the first 10 months of 
2017, 9,054 individuals were arrested for trafficking-related crimes, compared to a total of 
10,181 during the same period in 2016, a decrease of 11 percent.  In May 2017, the Technical 
Secretariat of Drugs instituted a policy called “Bodegas Vacias” (“Empty Warehouses”) to 
strengthen the drug destruction process and reduce the risks posed by seized illegal substances.  
During the first nine months of 2017, the Technical Secretariat of Drugs said it destroyed 105 
metric tons (MT) of seized illegal substances.     
 
Ecuador’s 2008 constitution categorizes drug abuse as a public health problem and mandates that 
the government develop prevention programs and provide treatment and rehabilitation options 
for persons with substance use disorders.  A criminal code (COIP) that went into effect in 2014 
increased penalties for most crimes, while decriminalizing personal use, possession, and 
consumption of relatively small amounts of narcotics.  
 
The COIP created a tiered approach to drug trafficking and possession with larger amounts 
carrying longer prison sentences.  To improve the efficacy of this tiered approach, in 2015 the 
National Council for the Control of Narcotic Drugs and Psychotropic Substances drastically 
reduced the minimum amount of illicit drugs required to trigger each tier of punishment.  
Ecuador’s Ministry of Interior has invested in developing technological capacities to target drug 
traffickers, including the improvement of a special crime laboratory in Quito.  The laboratory 


INCSR 2018 Volume 1  
 
 
 
 
Country Reports 
159 
 
provides police with tools to catalog and search fingerprint records and conduct DNA tests and 
toxicology screening.  A second laboratory was opened in Guayaquil in March 2016.  
 
The Government of Ecuador has bilateral drug control agreements with many countries in the 
region, including the United States.  The United States and Ecuador have agreements on 
measures to prevent the diversion of precursor chemicals, the sharing of information for currency 
transactions over $10,000, and a customs mutual assistance agreement.  The U.S. Coast Guard 
and Ecuadorian maritime authorities also exercise Maritime Operational Procedures that 
coordinate the boarding of vessels claiming Ecuadorian nationality and stateless vessels in 
international waters.   
 
The United States and Ecuador are parties to an extradition treaty entered into force in 1873 and 
a supplementary treaty entered into force in 1941.  However, Ecuador’s constitution prohibits the 
extradition of Ecuadorian citizens.  Since March 2016, the United States and Ecuador have 
worked to improve administrative processes related to extradition requests.  The United States 
and Ecuador do not have a bilateral mutual legal assistance treaty, but do cooperate under the 
Inter-American Convention on Mutual Assistance in Criminal Matters, as well as relevant UN 
conventions.    
 
2.  Supply Reduction 
  
Ecuador remains a major transit country for cocaine shipments via air, land, and maritime routes, 
and heroin shipments via air and mail.  Drug traffickers use various methods to move shipments, 
including containerized cargo ships, small fishing boats, self-propelled semi-submersible and 
fully-submersible submarines, “go-fast” boats, aircraft, human couriers, and mail.  Transnational 
criminal organizations continue to operate in Ecuador.  
 
Official police statistics indicate cocaine seizures decreased in 2017 from 2016, while heroin 
seizures increased significantly.  Cocaine seizures during the first 10 months of 2017 totaled 54 
MT, including base cocaine, an 11 percent decrease compared to 61 MT of cocaine seized during 
the same period in 2016.  Over this 10-month period, police seized 305 kilograms (kg) of heroin 
compared with 110 kg during all of 2016, and 10 MT of marijuana compared with 12 MT in 
2016.  
 
Maritime seizures by the Ecuadorian Coast Guard decreased significantly in 2017, from a record 
20 MT seized during all of 2016 to approximately four MT over the first nine months of 
2017.  This was largely due to the disbanding of a successful Coast Guard Intelligence Unit that 
coordinated intel-driven operations directly with tactical units.  However, there was a large 
individual bust by the Ecuadorian National Police, in coordination with U.S. government 
agencies, of 5.5 MT of cocaine seized from a merchant vessel refueling in a Santa Elena port.    
 
Ecuadorian National Police, in conjunction with the U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration 
(DEA), seized and destroyed a clandestine cocaine laboratory in September 2017 near the 
Colombian border in northern Ecuador.  In addition to eight arrests, approximately 1.25 MT of 
calcium chloride, 1.2 MT of sodium hydroxide, 1,280 liters of N-propyl acetate, and 700 kg of 


INCSR 2018 Volume 1  
 
 
 
 
Country Reports 
160 
 
pre-packaged cocaine were seized.  The laboratory reportedly was equipped to produce two MT 
of cocaine every 15 days.   
 
Drug traffickers use containerized cargo and shipping containers to smuggle drugs out of 
Ecuador, often concealing drugs in licit cargo.  The Port of Guayaquil is a major South American 
transshipment hub for cocaine concealed in containerized cargo to Europe.  The port authority, 
Contecon, employs security measures at its facility.  However, only seven percent of 
containerized exports are inspected.  Traffickers continue to smuggle liquid chemicals, including 
ether, from Ecuador to Colombia and Peru for cocaine processing.  
 
In 2016, the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime (UNODC) reported no significant coca 
cultivation in Ecuador.  Ecuadorian authorities detected small-scale coca cultivation along the 
northern border.  The police or military immediately eradicate coca or opium poppy plants when 
discovered, although nearly all poppy plants are wild and not cultivated for heroin production.  
During the first 10 months of 2017, the government eradicated 145,074 opium poppy plants, a 
significant increase compared to the 31,227 plants eradicated in first eight months of 2016.  
Comparing these same periods in 2016 and 2017, eradication of coca plants decreased from 
20,896 to 10,100.   
 
Production and consumption of synthetic drugs is not a major issue of concern for Ecuadorian 
authorities, though the government made arrests of organized groups involved in trafficking 
synthetic drugs.  In April 2016, the police arrested 10 Ecuadorian and Colombian members of a 
drug trafficking organization that distributed synthetic drugs in Quito.  In June 2017, the police 
fully dismantled this same drug trafficking group, raiding four locations, arresting five additional 
members, and seizing 68 packs of genetically modified marijuana known locally as “creepy.”  
Ecuador reported the emergence of new psychoactive substances to UNODC.  The future of 
synthetic drugs in Ecuador remains uncertain.  
 
3.  Public Information, Prevention, and Treatment 
  
Domestic drug abuse is a growing challenge in Ecuador.  UNODC carries out demand reduction 
and drug prevention programs in Ecuador with funding from the European Union and other 
international donors.  According to UNODC data, 12.7 percent of university students used some 
type of illicit drug in 2016.  The fourth national survey of student drug use conducted in 2014, 
among ages 12 to 17, indicated the average age of first-time drug users in Quito and Guayaquil 
rose from 13.8 in 2010 to 14.3 in 2014.  All drug offenders are entitled to drug treatment under 
the Ecuadorian constitution, but there is a lack of adequate resources and facilities to treat 
addicts.  As of October 2017, there were 15 publicly funded outpatient drug treatment facilities 
and no public inpatient drug treatment facilities in Ecuador.  Other drug treatment options, such 
as the 198 private facilities that provide drug treatment alternatives, are often prohibitively 
expensive.  
 
Coordination of abuse prevention programs is the responsibility of the Technical Secretariat for 
Drugs.  This government agency, which began its operations in January 2016, is responsible for 
coordinating the overall drug control policy in Ecuador and answers directly to the presidency.  
In 2017, the Technical Secretariat of Drugs conducted drug abuse public awareness campaigns in

schools, as well as training in drug prevention for doctors, psychologists, and social workers.  It 
also promoted a national agreement on drug prevention with local governments and communities 
to foster an integrated approach to the problem.  
 
4.  Corruption 
  
As a matter of policy, the Ecuadorian government does not encourage or facilitate the illicit 
production or distribution of narcotic or other controlled substances, or the laundering of 
proceeds from illegal drug transactions.  President Moreno has made anti-corruption a priority of 
the new administration.  Ecuador’s 2015 revisions to its penal code increased penalties for 
government officials who impede the prosecution of drug traffickers and strengthens the 
definition of conspiracy. 
 
Narcotics-related corruption remains a problem within the public security forces.  On September 
27, two police officers and a former police officer were arrested in Guayaquil for transporting 85 
kg of cocaine in a police vehicle.  A joint operation between U.S. and Ecuadorian law 
enforcement agencies resulted in the seizure of approximately 1.18 MT of cocaine and the arrest 
of three Ecuadorian Navy officials and five Ecuadorian nationals on September 10 after 
intercepting “go-fast” vessels near the coastline of El Oro.   
 
Several government entities are responsible for receiving and investigating corruption 
complaints, but resource constraints and political pressure generally lead to a lack of 
prosecution.    
 
C.  National Goals, Bilateral Cooperation, and U.S. Policy Initiatives 
  
Before 2014, the primary focus of U.S. government assistance and training was to enhance the 
capabilities and resources of Ecuador’s police, military, and judicial agencies, enabling them to 
combat transnational criminal organizations involved in drug trafficking and money laundering.  
These coordinated operations resulted in sustained damages to drug trafficking rings, and helped 
strengthen Ecuador’s sovereignty and national security.  
 
The previous Ecuadorian government’s closure of the U.S. Embassy’s Office of Security 
Cooperation in 2014 reduced bilateral collaboration against illicit drugs.  In 2014, the U.S. 
Department of State’s Bureau of International Narcotics and Law Enforcement Affairs (INL) 
closed its security assistance office in Ecuador.  Despite these setbacks, the United States 
continued to support Ecuador’s security forces in limited ways.  Ecuador participated in the May 
2017 U.S. Coast Guard-sponsored Multilateral Maritime Counterdrug Summit, which enhanced 
bilateral cooperation in combating maritime drug trafficking.  In 2017, the United States 
provided ongoing logistical and operational support for Ecuadorian drug enforcement operations.  
The new Moreno administration expressed interest in enhancing this cooperation.  In June 2017, 
the U.S. Interdiction Committee visited Ecuador and held productive ministerial-level meetings 
with the Government of Ecuador, which reaffirmed the mutual commitment to expand drug 
control cooperation.  
 


INCSR 2018 Volume 1  
 
 
 
 
Country Reports 
162 
 
In 2017, the United States supported Ecuador’s drug prevention efforts in coordination with 
Ecuador’s Technical Secretariat for Drugs, Ministry of Interior, and National Assembly, and 
other governmental and multilateral entities that address drug abuse awareness.  U.S. experts in 
drug prevention and demand reduction visited Ecuador to share best practices and identify areas 
for future collaboration with government officials, police, legislators, students, educators, and 
social and health workers,   
 
Ecuador is making efforts to improve cross border drug control cooperation with Colombia and 
Peru, and Ecuador and Colombia successfully coordinated a number of operations in 2017.  One 
regional success involved cooperation between DEA and its counterpart law enforcement units in 
both Ecuador and Colombia, which led to the indictment in Florida of Edison Prado Alava, a 
U.S. Government Consolidated Priority Organization Target, the highest level drug trafficking 
violator designation.  As a result of regional law enforcement cooperation, Ecuadorian officials 
in April 2017 discovered approximately $14.5 million hidden under the cement floors of Prado’s 
residences in Guayaquil.  Ecuador also increased maritime information sharing with both 
Colombia and Peru in 2017.  The United States will continue to work with Ecuadorian police and 
security officials to increase their interdiction capacity at sea and in port facilities. 
 
The United States maintains a non-binding operational agreement with Ecuador to suppress illicit 
traffic by sea, which includes ship boarding and expedited communications.  Ecuador was a 
participant in the semi-annual Multilateral Maritime Counter Drug Summit in November 2017, 
which attracted 125 maritime counterdrug professionals from nearly 25 countries and over 65 
international agencies spanning North, Central and South America, and Europe.    
 
D.  Conclusion 
  
The United States supports Ecuador’s drug control efforts and strongly encourages Ecuador to 
place a high priority on the interdiction of illicit drugs and the control of chemical precursors, 
both on land and at sea.  To address the growing challenges of drug trafficking resulting from 
record cocaine production levels in Colombia, the Ecuadorian government needs to devote 
additional resources to augment the capacity of the police and military through the acquisition of 
drug interdiction equipment, technology to facilitate investigations, and provision of additional 
training.  The Ecuadorian government should focus on ways to secure containerized, maritime 
cargo from illicit use and increase maritime interdiction capacity.     
 
While the implementation of Ecuador’s 2014 penal code provided new tools to law enforcement 
personnel to conduct surveillance and operations, the lack of regimented investigative training 
continues to hinder Ecuador’s ability to successfully prosecute transnational crime.  The 2015 
revisions to the penal code show Ecuador’s commitment to combatting and reducing drug 
trafficking, but in order to increase interdiction, investigation, and prosecution of transnational 
crime, Ecuador must provide greater resources for implementing the penal code changes into its 
legal system.

Egypt 
 
While Egypt is not a major producer or supplier of illicit drugs or precursor chemicals, there is a 
significant market within the country for hashish and tramadol (a prescription opioid).  Egypt 
also serves as a transshipment point for illicit drugs trafficked from Africa to Europe and is 
developing into a significant smuggling route for fenethylline (an amphetamine-type stimulant) 
produced in Lebanon and Syria destined for Saudi Arabia and other Gulf countries.  The 
Government of Egypt does not encourage or facilitate illicit production or distribution of narcotic 
drugs or other controlled substances, nor does it encourage the laundering of proceeds from 
illegal transactions.  Egypt has strict laws and penalties for officials convicted of involvement in 
illicit drug trafficking activities. 
 
The Anti-Narcotics General Administration (ANGA), under the Ministry of Interior, oversees 
counterdrug operations and cooperates with U.S. law enforcement authorities to identify, detect, 
disrupt, and dismantle national and international drug trafficking organizations.  While ANGA 
works on a limited budget, its equipment is updated on a systematic basis.  Cooperation between 
ANGA, the Egyptian Armed Forces’ Special Forces, and Border Guard units remains good, 
including on large-scale anti-drug campaigns. 
 
ANGA continued to seize large quantities of cannabis and psychotropic pills in 2017.  During the 
first eight months of the year, ANGA and U.S. law enforcement authorities coordinated on 
investigations that resulted in the seizure of nearly 18 metric tons of hashish, 166,260,000 
tramadol tablets, and over 4,820,000 fenethylline tablets.  Most seized cannabis originated in 
Morocco and Lebanon.  The volume of cocaine seized at Cairo International Airport remained 
low at 2.5 kilograms and seizures of MDMA (ecstasy) decreased significantly, totaling less than 
3,000 tablets during the first six months of 2017.  
 
A U.S.-Egyptian mutual legal assistance treaty has been in force since 2001, and extradition 
between the two countries is governed in principle by an 1875 convention, though Egyptian 
cooperation under these instruments has been limited.

El Salvador 
  
A.  Introduction 
  
El Salvador remains a transit country for illicit drugs originating from source countries in South 
America destined for the United States.  In 2017, increased maritime interdiction operations by 
the Salvadoran Navy and increased information-sharing with international partners served to 
push most maritime traffic beyond the 200 nautical mile mark El Salvador claims as its territorial 
waters.  Analysis of drug trafficking trends suggests drug trafficking organizations are trafficking 
cocaine shipments by maritime conveyance deeper into the Pacific Ocean, beyond the 
operational capacity of the Salvadoran Navy to avoid detection. 
 
Transnational cocaine-trafficking organizations use private vehicles to transport cocaine to the 
Guatemalan border along the Pan-American Highway.   
 
In 2017, the Salvadoran government continued implementing Plan El Salvador Seguro (PESS), a 
geographically-targeted approach to reducing crime that targets drug trafficking in the most 
violent municipalities and includes drug prevention components.  The Salvadoran government 
also continued a series of emergency measures launched in 2016 aimed at securing the nation’s 
prisons and dismantling gang leadership structures that play a role in local drug distribution.  In 
2017, the National Civil Police (PNC) of El Salvador dismantled the logistical networks of 
several transnational cocaine trafficking organizations based in Guatemala and operating in El 
Salvador.  A lack of reliable information on the severity of drug consumption and internal 
distribution within El Salvador continues to present a challenge. 
 
B.  Drug Control Accomplishments, Policies, and Trends 
  
          1.  Institutional Development 
  
The Anti-Narcotics Division (DAN) of the PNC is the primary agency responsible for combating 
drug-related crimes throughout El Salvador.  The vetted Grupo Especial Anti-Narcoticos unit 
(GEAN) within the DAN is responsible for conducting sensitive drug investigations.  In 2017, 
the GEAN continued to build institutional links with more advanced Sensitive Investigation 
Units (SIUs) in Guatemala and Colombia, greatly expanding El Salvador’s ability to respond to 
drug trafficking alerts and investigate larger criminal organizations.  El Salvador supports a full-
time liaison officer within the U.S. Joint Interagency Task Force South (JIATF-S) to support 
regional drug control coordination. 
 
El Salvador’s National Electronic Monitoring Center began operations in June 2012 with support 
from the United States.  The center allows Salvadoran law enforcement authorities with judicial 
warrants to intercept electronic communications to support drug trafficking investigations, 
increasing operational coordination between the DAN, GEAN, other Salvadoran investigative 
authorities, and international partners.  This improved intelligence sharing led to the dismantling 
of a Salvadoran drug-trafficking cell with links to Guatemala on February 7, 2017.

A decline in maritime drug trafficking within Salvadoran territorial waters led to decreased 
littoral interdiction operations by the Joint Interagency Task Force “Grupo Conjunto Cuscatlán” 
(GCC).  The unit, equipped for patrols along coastal waterways, saw little drug trafficking in 
2017, and thus focused its operations toward supporting the arrest of gang members operating 
from remote estuarine and coastal safe havens.  The Salvadoran Navy assumed primary 
responsibility for maritime interdiction at or beyond 200 nautical miles from El Salvador’s 
coastline.  In August, the GCC moved its primary headquarters away from military facilities and 
began a transition to a fully civilian police unit focused on anti-gang efforts, but remains 
equipped to coordinate with the Navy on littoral interdiction if maritime trafficking trends shift 
back to where they were in previous years. 
 
El Salvador is party to the Central American Convention for the Prevention of Money 
Laundering Related to Drug-Trafficking and Similar Crimes, the Inter-American Convention 
Against Corruption, the Inter-American Convention on Extradition, and the Inter-American 
Convention on Mutual Assistance in Criminal Matters. 
 
          2.  Supply Reduction 
  
Between January 1 and October 26, 2017, Salvadoran authorities seized approximately 5.67 
metric tons (MT) of cocaine; 599 kilograms (kg) of marijuana; 1.93 kg of crack cocaine; and 
8.36 kg of heroin.  Cocaine seizures declined 54 percent in 2017, after an increase of 230 percent 
in 2016.  The reduced seizures could indicate traffickers are moving maritime loads farther 
offshore and relying less on overland routes.  The diversion of human and material resources 
from the DAN to support anti-gang operations in 2017 played a limited factor in reduced 
seizures.  Salvadoran authorities also seized $802,733 in bulk currency, and arrested 2,949 
individuals on drug-related crimes. 
  
          3.  Public Information, Prevention, and Treatment 
  
Drug use among Salvadorans is a growing concern, particularly among youth.  The government 
has not kept reliable statistics for illegal consumption since 2012.  The PNC has been 
successfully implementing the Gang Resistance Education and Training (GREAT) program in 
public schools throughout Model Police Precinct (MPP) locations, which combine training and 
police-community relation activities.  In 2017, the United States trained and certified 104 
Salvadoran PNC officers as full-time GREAT instructors, raising the total trained since the 
program began in 2010 to 395.  These officers delivered GREAT to 14,323 at-risk youth 
throughout the country.  In addition to the GREAT program, the PNC has established Police 
Athletic leagues in 12 high-crime municipalities, benefitting over 11,000 at-risk youth.  In 2017, 
the United States’ partnership with the PNC continued to support citizen security and prevention 
activities in 37 municipal districts through the MPP Program, with four additional communities 
reaching MPP status by the end of the year.  
 
In 2017, the United States continued to support the Salvadoran Government in the 
implementation of PESS and its geographically-targeted approach to high-crime areas.  As part 
of the sustained support to the MPPs, 1,031 PNC officers were trained and equipped to 


INCSR 2018 Volume 1  
 
 
 
 
Country Reports

implement best practices in effective crime prevention, community policing, intelligence 
collection, and citizen engagement.   
 
          4.  Corruption 
  
The Government of El Salvador does not, as a matter of government policy, encourage or 
facilitate illicit drug production or distribution, nor is it involved in laundering the proceeds of 
the sale of illicit drugs.  However, corruption within the Salvadoran political system remains a 
serious problem.  The United States continues to utilize U.S.-trained Colombian polygraphists 
via the trilateral U.S.- Colombia Action Planto assist El Salvador’s security forces with anti-
corruption efforts.  During the first 10 months of 2017, Colombian polygraphists completed 569 
exams of PNC investigative units, DAN, GCC, Attorney General staff, and U.S.-supported task 
forces.  The Attorney General continued building cases and preparing for trial against former 
officials arrested in 2016, including former Attorney General Luis Martinez and former President 
Antonio Saca, who remain in pre-trial detention, and former President Mauricio Funes, who 
sought and received political asylum in Nicaragua in 2016. 
 
In July, El Salvador’s Legislative Assembly passed reforms to the 2013 Asset Forfeiture law 
which made it more difficult for the Attorney General’s Office to investigate and prosecute illicit 
enrichment and public corruption cases.  The legislation added a statute of limitations and 
heightened evidentiary requirements for all illicit enrichment cases not involving gangs, 
potentially making it more difficult for the Attorney General to prosecute money laundering 
cases related to official corruption and drug trafficking.  In August, the Constitutional Chamber 
of El Salvador’s Supreme Court placed a temporary injunction on the Asset Forfeiture reforms 
while it reviews the constitutionality of these reforms. 
  
C.  National Goals, Bilateral Cooperation, and U.S. Policy Initiatives 
  
The United States supports citizen security, law enforcement, and rule-of-law programs in El 
Salvador through the U.S. Strategy for Central America and the Central America Regional 
Security Initiative (CARSI), supporting El Salvador’s implementation of PESS and the Plan of 
the Alliance for Prosperity, a regional plan developed by the governments of El Salvador, 
Guatemala, and Honduras.  These programs aim to expand Salvadoran capabilities to interdict, 
investigate, and prosecute illegal drug trafficking and other transnational crimes, implement 
prevention programs, and strengthen El Salvador’s justice sector.  The United States also 
supports anti-gang and community policing in El Salvador with equipment, vehicles, training, 
and social and economic programs.  The United States provided Salvadoran law enforcement the 
ability to use COMPSTAT, a statistical analysis tool that tracks the type and location of crime 
reports to more efficiently allocate law enforcement resources; AFIS, an automated fingerprint 
database; and IBIS, a ballistics database. 
 
In 2017, U.S. assistance focused on enhancing the operational capacity of Salvadoran law 
enforcement agencies to interdict drug shipments and combat money laundering and public 
corruption.  Assistance also promoted transparency, efficiency, and institutional respect for 
human and civil rights within law enforcement agencies and the criminal justice system, 
including efforts to professionalize the PNC and reduce the role of the military in civilian

policing.  The United States supported efforts to combat transnational criminal organizations, 
particularly the Mara Salvatrucha (MS-13) and 18th Street gangs, while developing and 
implementing integrated initiatives to disrupt drug trafficking and other criminal activity. 
 
In 2017, U.S. assistance included specialized training for 361 PNC officers in areas such as 
intelligence-led policing, community relations, and complex investigations.  The United States 
also helped strengthen the effectiveness of criminal justice procedures and practices by training 
283 justice sector personnel in asset forfeiture, advanced investigation, and trial skills over the 
first half of the year.  The United States also provided technical assistance to increase 
coordination between justice sector agents and institutions; improve criminal investigations using 
scientific evidence; and build the capacity of the police and prosecutor’s offices. 
 
El Salvador was a participant in the semi-annual Multilateral Maritime Counter Drug Summit 
held in November 2017, which attracted 125 maritime counterdrug professionals from nearly 25 
countries and over 65 international agencies spanning North, Central and South America, and 
Europe.    
 
D.  Conclusion 
  
El Salvador strengthened its capacity to fight transnational crime in 2017, even as drug 
traffickers seemed to shift their maritime routes farther from El Salvador’s coast.  Authorities 
demonstrated increased capacity to lead complex investigations, coordinate and share 
intelligence between agencies and with overseas counterparts, and dismantle organized crime 
structures.  El Salvador still faces formidable challenges, including geographical vulnerability to 
drug trafficking that might cause transit routes to shift back in the future, and must take steps to 
promote sustainable and effective law enforcement institutions.   
 
The successes of 2017 can only be sustained if the Government of El Salvador demonstrates 
continued commitment to crime prevention, security, and rule of law.  Progress in these fields, 
and the emergence of law enforcement actors capable of sharing information and coordinating 
effectively with international partners, likely contributed to the 2017 decline in maritime drug 
trafficking, but the entire continuum of El Salvador’s criminal justice institutions must continue 
to be strengthened to prevent the return of trafficking routes if interdiction efforts in neighboring 
countries continue to advance.  Political will to confront corruption and maintain adequate 
resources for the DAN and Attorney General’s Office, including adequate pay and physical 
protection, remains a challenge, and the corrections system remains overcrowded and 
mismanaged.

Georgia 
 
Georgia’s location along traditional smuggling routes in the Black Sea region leaves it 
vulnerable to transnational criminal organizations that continue to traffic opiates and synthetic 
drugs from Southwest Asia to European markets.  Georgian authorities did not report seizing 
significant amounts of illicit drugs in 2017, however.   
 
 
The Georgian government and non-governmental organizations report substantial drug and 
substance abuse challenges with an estimated 50,000 illicit drug users.  Methadone, heroin, and 
buprenorphine, a synthetic opioid, remain the most commonly used drugs in Georgia, and 
intravenous drug use is reportedly rising.  
 
A 2017 survey revealed a rise in drug consumption by youth with 11 percent of Georgian youth 
reporting marijuana consumption.  The International Organization for Migration, in partnership 
with the Ministry of Education and Science and with U.S. support, launched a drug abuse 
information and prevention campaign targeting Georgian youth in Tbilisi, Shida Kartli, and 
Samegrelo-Zemo Svaneti regions.  The campaign reached 4,067 schoolchildren in eight at-risk 
schools and established substance abuse dialogue between students, educators, and families.  
 
In 2017, a consortium of 40 non-governmental organizations called the National Drug Policy 
Platform worked with the Georgian Parliament’s Health and Social Protection Committee to 
draft proposed amendments to Georgia’s drug law.  If enacted, the amendments would enact 
reforms to treat drug use as a public health issue, including prison treatment programs and 
alternative penalties to incarceration for drug crimes.  While drug trafficking and distribution 
would remain criminal offenses if the amendments are enacted, recreational marijuana use would 
be liberalized, and detention for the purchase, possession, and personal use of marijuana would 
be abolished.     
 
To counter transnational organized crime and support drug-related investigations, Georgia has 
developed intelligence-led policing programs and deployed police attachés to 13 countries to 
assist in investigations.  The United States continued efforts to strengthen Georgia’s drug control 
capacity in 2017 by expanding the existing Tbilisi-based canine interdiction program.  The 
program deployed six additional U.S.-trained canines and Georgian handlers to Kutaisi and 
Batumi.  U.S. trainers have helped the canines to identify marijuana, heroin, cocaine, 
methamphetamine, and synthetic drugs.  
 
The Government of Georgia actively cooperates with a wide range of actors to combat drug 
trafficking and consumption and to develop comprehensive responses to drug dependency.  
These partners include civil society, academia, the UN Office on Drugs and Crime and other 
international organizations, regional partner states, and the European Union.   
 
The United States continues to support Georgia’s fight against crime and illicit drug use and 
trafficking.  The U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration continues to work proactive 
investigations with Georgian law enforcement counterparts and continues to exchange law 
enforcement information.  The Government of Georgia continues to show a strong interest in 
further collaboration with the United States.

Ghana 
 
Ghana remains a transit point for illegal drugs trafficked from South America and Asia to Europe 
and Africa.  Cocaine from Latin America and heroin from Asia are smuggled into the country for 
onward shipment to Europe and the United States.  Cannabis is also produced in substantial 
quantities within Ghana.  Drug trafficking in Ghana has created fertile ground for organized 
crime.  Ghana law enforcement and intelligence agencies have alleged that transnational drug 
trafficking networks operating in the country have links to terrorist organizations, which in turn 
rely heavily on proceeds from the drug trade to finance their activities.  Preliminary reports 
indicate that the volume of cocaine and marijuana seized during the first 10 months of 2017 
declined from the previous year, and the amount of heroin and methamphetamine seized over the 
same period increased.  However, data collection and information sharing with the Government 
of Ghana remain a challenge, making accurate figures difficult to obtain.  In July 2017, Ghana 
reported the largest seizure of methamphetamine in its history when Narcotics Control Board 
Officers working at Kotoka International Airport seized 42 kilograms of methamphetamine from 
a passenger arriving from Johannesburg, South Africa.   
 
Increasing drug use is a public health concern.  Ghana’s government was expected to pass 
legislation at the end of 2017 that would change the penalties for the personal use of narcotics.  
Assuming it passes into law, the Narcotics Control Commission Bill would reduce the stringent 
mandatory five year imprisonment for possession and personal use of illicit drugs.  Under the 
new legislation, personal use would be punishable with a fine of up to approximately $1,400 or 
15 months imprisonment.  The mandatory minimum sentence of 10 years would remain for 
trafficking.   
 
Ghana maintained a high degree of cooperation with the United States and other international 
partners on drug control issues in 2017.  The United States and Ghana continued successful law 
enforcement cooperation under the U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration’s Sensitive 
Investigative Unit program.  Supported by U.S. funding, the United Nations Office on Drugs and 
Crime continued to implement a two-year old program to provide training and equipment to new 
drug enforcement units in four regions.  Ghana continues to work productively with international 
partners on law enforcement operations targeting transnational drug trafficking organizations.  
 
There is no mutual legal assistance treaty between Ghana and the United States, although mutual 
legal assistance can be provided on a reciprocal basis through letters of request.  Extradition 
between Ghana and the United States is governed by the 1931 U.S.-U.K. Extradition Treaty.

Guatemala 
 
A. Introduction 
 
Guatemala remains a major transit country for illicit drugs destined for the United States.  U.S. 
authorities estimate over 1400 metric tons (MT) of cocaine were smuggled through Guatemala in 
2017.  Most of the cocaine smuggled to Guatemala comes directly from South America by boat.  
Mexican drug cartels rely on Guatemalan trafficking networks for receiving, storing, and 
transporting product to the United States through Mexico.    
 
Guatemala’s porous borders and overburdened law enforcement agencies allow criminal 
organizations to traffic illicit drugs, cultivate cannabis and opium poppy, and smuggle precursor 
chemicals.  The virtual absence of a permanent law enforcement presence in many areas of the 
country allow other forms of transnational crime to flourish, including migrant smuggling and 
trafficking in persons, weapons, counterfeit goods, and other contraband. 
 
Key Guatemalan officials relevant to drug control demonstrated political will to counter drug 
trafficking, corruption, and violence.  Guatemala achieved some notable successes in 2017, 
including high levels of drug seizures, the capture of high-profile criminals, improved 
interagency coordination, and enhanced regional cooperation.  However, Guatemala’s fight 
against criminal organizations continues to be hindered by endemic corruption, weak public 
institutions, and inadequate budget resources. 
 
Guatemala is concerned over rising domestic drug consumption, especially among adolescents.  
Authorities are attempting to respond to this emerging trend through expanded drug prevention 
and treatment programs, but are impeded by a lack of sufficient funds, personnel, and technical 
expertise.   
   
B. Drug Control Accomplishments, Policies, and Trends 
 
1. Institutional Development 
 
Guatemala is experiencing dramatic increases of cocaine trafficking by maritime and aerial 
conveyance to its Pacific coast bordering Mexico.  To counter this threat, the Guatemalan 
Defense Ministry expanded operations of the Naval Special Forces (FEN) and increased its 
maritime presence along its pacific coastline and Economic Exclusion Zone (EEZ).  The vast 
majority of the cocaine trafficked into Guatemala originates from Colombia and is shipped 
directly to the Guatemalan coastline.  Considering its limited resources, the FEN achieved 
notable results through both its unilateral and its joint maritime interdiction operations with the 
United States, Mexico, and El Salvador.  The FEN, however, continues to be challenged by the 
myriad maritime smuggling methods used by traffickers, including semi-submersible vessels, 
small fishing boats, and parasitic devices attached to freight ships.   
 
The Guatemalan Air Force plays a critical role in detecting and monitoring aircraft suspected of 
trafficking illegal drugs in and out of Guatemala through its Caribbean and Pacific corridors.  
During the first 10 months of 2017, there were 44 suspected aerial trafficking events, a 238 


INCSR 2018 Volume 1  
 
 
 
 
Country Reports 
171 
 
percent increase from the same period in 2016.  The Air Force does not directly interdict 
suspected drug flights, but shares information with Guatemalan law enforcement to support 
interdiction operations; these coordinated operations saw modest success in 2017.   
 
Thanks in part to U.S. training and assistance, Guatemala made strides in 2017 in improving 
coordination between and among its law enforcement agencies.  The Guatemalan Tax 
Administration (SAT) embedded border police within its units, and plans were developed to 
position complete interagency teams at each port of entry comprising members of the Anti-
Narcotics Police, SAT, and the National Civil Police’s border security force.  U.S. support to the 
border police (DIPAFRONT) led to a doubling in size of the force and successful operations 
with Mexico, Honduras, and El Salvador.  Guatemala’s enhanced border security capacity helped 
deter migrant smuggling, as evidenced by a marked decrease in the arrival of unaccompanied 
children from Honduras in 2017.  Insufficient equipment and supplies remain a challenge, and 
additional personnel remain needed to effectively patrol Guatemala’s borders. 
  
Guatemala is a party to several relevant regional agreements, including the Organization of 
American States’ Inter-American Drug Abuse Control Commission (CICAD), the Caribbean 
Regional Agreement on Maritime Counter narcotics, and the Inter-American Convention on 
Mutual Assistance in Criminal Matters.  A maritime drug control agreement with the United 
States is fully implemented. 
 
Guatemala continues to work closely with U.S. authorities on extradition matters and regularly 
extradites its own citizens, including high-level drug traffickers, to the United States for 
prosecution. 
 
2. Supply Reduction 
 
As evidenced by record drug seizures in 2017, Guatemala remains a major transit corridor.  
During the first 10 months of 2017, authorities seized more than 16 MT of cocaine, on track to 
meet or exceed the total volume seized during all of 2016 (18.5 MT).  Guatemalan law 
enforcement agencies also reportedly confiscated 13 kilograms of heroin; seized more than $3.5 
million in bulk cash; and destroyed 5.3 million cannabis plants and 417 million opium poppy 
plants.  A total of 106 high-profile drug traffickers were arrested through October, and included 
leaders of criminal organizations responsible for trafficking millions of dollars’ worth of cocaine 
through Central America. 
 
In 2016, the government initiated a multifaceted approach to eradicating opium poppy by 
supplementing eradication efforts with community development programs, including efforts to 
promote health, education, and long-term economic development.  Major challenges remain in 
the western highlands, where opium poppy cultivation takes place.  Due to unrest in the region, a 
three-month State of Emergency was declared in the San Marcos region.  This allowed 
Guatemalan officials to resume eradication operations that revealed a steep increase in opium 
poppy cultivation since the last major eradication efforts were undertaken in 2015.  Following 83 
days of eradication operations, government forces reported eradicating 780 hectares (ha) of 
opium poppy cultivated to supply Mexican-based traffickers.  This number includes fields that 


INCSR 2018 Volume 1  
 
 
 
 
Country Reports 
172 
 
were eradicated multiple times because farmers immediately replanted some areas during the 
course of the eradication mission. 
 
The Guatemalan government continues to struggle with estimating the number of hectares under 
poppy cultivation.  The State of Emergency’s extended eradication efforts developed the most 
comprehensive data available to date on poppy cultivation sites, but eradication operations were 
limited by inaccessible mountain roads, and some cultivation was likely missed.   
 
3. Public Information, Prevention, and Treatment 
 
Guatemalan authorities are concerned by domestic drug consumption, and the Guatemalan 
government demonstrated its commitment to confronting the challenge by doubling its budget 
for demand reduction activities in 2017.  A U.S.-funded national survey released by the 
Guatemalan government in 2014 is still the most recent national survey of drug consumption 
trends within the country.  This report estimated that young people aged 11 to 20 used marijuana 
and cocaine at higher rates than their counterparts in countries such as Mexico, Colombia, and 
Costa Rica.  The study identified specific risk factors for Guatemalan adolescents, including easy 
access to illicit drugs, as well as low risk perception associated with the use of marijuana, 
cocaine, and MDMA (ecstasy).  The United States supported Guatemalan efforts to address these 
trends in 2017, helping to promote drug abuse awareness and prevention among municipal 
leaders, teachers, students, parents, and the private sector. 
  
Drug treatment centers in Guatemala are administered under the Ministry of Health.  According 
to government sources, in 2016, approximately 15,000 adults were in residential treatment, the 
majority for marijuana and/or cocaine use.  In 2016, a U.S.-funded study of 30 of the country’s 
100 treatment centers concluded that the majority of drug treatment providers, directors, and 
counselors lacked the technical expertise to meet patient needs.  Further, most centers lack basic 
equipment and do not apply a formal therapeutic model to drug treatment.   
 
U.S. assistance in 2017 took a variety of forms and included a large-scale campaign to raise 
awareness of the health risks and negative social consequences of illegal drugs, coordinated by a 
U.S.-supported Community Antidrug Coalition.  Support was also provided to universal 
prevention workshops to educate students and adults about the neuroscience of drug addiction 
that reached almost 25,000 students and over 2,000 teachers and parents in five different 
departments in Guatemala. 
 
4. Corruption 
 
The Government of Guatemala does not, as a matter of government policy, encourage or 
facilitate illicit drug production or distribution, nor is it involved in laundering of the proceeds of 
the sale illicit drugs.  However, widespread corruption permeates public and private institutions 
and exacerbates the country’s security, governmental, and economic challenges.  Guatemala’s 
Attorney General and the International Commission Against Impunity in Guatemela (CICIG) 
have investigated hundreds of government officials suspected of corruption since 2013.  U.S. 
assistance supports anti-corruption efforts by developing and training specialized vetted units, 
particularly those tasked with countering drug trafficking, money laundering, and criminal gangs. 


INCSR 2018 Volume 1  
 
 
 
 
Country Reports 
173 
 
  
Accomplishments in the broader fight against corruption in 2017 included the creation of an 
internal affairs office and a polygraph team within the SAT, which historically suffered from 
high levels of corruption.  Special prosecutors were embedded within the Ministry of Finances 
and the General Comptroller Office allowing for more efficient processing of corruption charges.  
U.S.-provided training assisted in strengthening the capacity of police and prosecutor units to 
investigate corruption using special investigative methods.  Several high-level government 
officials and their relatives were arrested on corruption-related charges in 2017.  As a 
consequence of these types of investigations, several asset forfeiture cases allowed Guatemala to 
recover more than $5.5 million stolen by corrupt officials.    
 
C. National Goals, Bilateral Cooperation, and U.S. Policy Initiatives 
 
Consistent with the U.S. Strategy for Engagement in Central America, as well as the Central 
American governments’ Alliance for Prosperity initiative, the United States continues to be a key 
provider of assistance aimed at improving the professional capabilities and integrity of 
Guatemala’s police forces and judicial institutions, mainly through the Central America Regional 
Security Initiative (CARSI).  The overall objective of U.S. assistance efforts is to create effective 
and accountable institutions in partnership with the Guatemalan government. 
 
By November 1, 2017, an ongoing U.S. initiative established 74 Model Police Precincts (MPPs) 
across Guatemala, and was on pace to complete the initiative’s goal of establishing 99 MPPs by 
year’s end.  Each precinct is coordinating with municipal authorities and the National Civil 
Police on violence prevention, community policing, security monitoring, and joint patrols.  Small 
sample size surveys have indicated increased trust in the police following implementation of 
MPPs.  The MPP model also led to increased coordination between the Guatemalan National 
Police (PNC) and the municipal police (PMT), which was lacking before. 
 
The United States maintains a bilateral agreement with Guatemala to suppress illicit traffic by 
sea, which include provisions regarding ship boarding, shipriders, pursuit, entry into territorial 
waters, overflight, order to land, and international maritime interdiction support.  Guatemala 
participated in the semi-annual Multilateral Maritime Counter Drug Summit held in November 
2017, which attracted 125 maritime counterdrug professionals from nearly 25 countries and over 
65 international agencies spanning North, Central and South America, and Europe.    
 
D. Conclusion 
 
The United States works closely with Guatemalan authorities to improve the government’s 
capacity to provide security and justice to its citizens.  In 2017, Guatemala made notable 
progress in the fight against criminal organizations, including enhanced institutional capacity, 
improved interagency and regional cooperation, and record interdiction and enforcement gains.  
However, significant challenges remain.  Corruption levels remain high and public confidence in 
government institutions is low.  Limited budget resources hinder the government’s effectiveness.  
Despite Guatemala’s many successes in 2017, the government needs to take additional steps to 
further build sustainable drug control mechanisms, including support for anti-corruption efforts,

accelerated judicial processes, improved interagency cooperation, and adequate financial 
resources for relevant agencies and government ministries.

Guinea-Bissau 
 
Guinea-Bissau is not a significant source country of illicit drugs, but is a significant transit 
country for drug trafficking from South America to Europe.  The country’s weak law 
enforcement capabilities, corruption, porous borders, and convenient location make it susceptible 
to drug trafficking.  Guinea-Bissau’s political system has historically been vulnerable to 
influence by a variety of criminal elements.  The complicity of government officials at all levels 
in this criminal activity inhibits a complete assessment and resolution of the problem.  
 
Following the 2014 elections, the UN Office on Drugs and Crime (UNODC) and the UN 
Integrated Peace-Building Office in Guinea-Bissau initiated Security Sector Reform 
programming.  The United States Coast Guard’s International Port Security Program conducted 
two assessments in 2016 of the Port of Bissau, noting serious efforts to maintain security, yet 
containers continue to enter and leave the country without inspection.  The European Union, 
Portugal, France, Spain, and Brazil have delivered bilateral assistance in years past and maintain 
bilateral cooperation on security issues.  However, efforts at security and law enforcement 
reform continue to be hampered by chronic political instability and lack of robust government 
institutions.  
 
Neither domestic nor international organizations collect data on the quantity of illegal drugs that 
transit Guinea-Bissau.  The country’s borders are poorly controlled.  Inadequate resources, high 
levels of corruption, and lack of professionalism among law enforcement and judicial authorities 
have hampered efforts to seize drug shipments and investigate drug trafficking.  Law 
enforcement and judicial officers are involved in drug trafficking, as are elements of the military.  
Members of the customs service take money to allow passengers and articles to pass through 
border posts without inspection.  Government salaries are inadequate, further encouraging 
corruption at all levels. 
 
UNODC reports that drug abuse is a growing problem in Guinea-Bissau, though still at a 
relatively low level by global standards.  No organization has conducted a systematic study of 
the problem to determine its scope; all assessments are based on anecdotal evidence.  There are 
no government-funded treatment centers in Guinea-Bissau.  The few operational centers are 
privately funded. 
 
Guinea-Bissau does not have a bilateral extradition treaty or a mutual legal assistance Treaty 
with the United States, though it is party to multilateral conventions that enable such 
cooperation.

Guyana 
 
A.  Introduction  
 
Guyana is a transit country for cocaine destined for the United States, Canada, the Caribbean, 
Europe, and West Africa.  Cocaine originating in Colombia is smuggled to Venezuela and 
onward to Guyana by sea and air.  Smugglers also transit land borders and the shared river 
network with Brazil, Venezuela, and Suriname.  Cocaine is concealed in legitimate commodities 
and smuggled through commercial and private air transport, maritime vessels, human couriers, 
“go-fast” boats, and various postal systems. 
 
Drug-related corruption is evident in the country’s criminal justice system and other sectors.  
Drug traffickers are attracted by the country’s poorly monitored ports, remote airstrips, intricate 
river networks, porous land borders, corruption, and weak security sector capacity.  Despite these 
challenges, the Government of Guyana has demonstrated a strong political will to combat the 
trafficking of narcotics in and through Guyana. 
 
B.  Drug Control Accomplishments, Policies, and Trends  
 
 
1.  Institutional Development 
 
Guyana has a comprehensive legal framework in place to support drug-related investigations and 
prosecutions.  Relevant laws include the Anti-Money Laundering and Countering the Financing 
of Terrorism (AML/CFT) Act of 2009; the Interception of Communications Act 2008; the 
Criminal Law Procedure Act (revised in 1998); the Narcotic Drug and Psychotropic Substances 
(Control) Act 1988; and the Maritime Drug Trafficking (Suppression) Act 2003.  In August, the 
Guyanese government amended its AML/CFT law to provide for harsher penalties for anyone 
found to be laundering money.  As a result of this reform, Guyana was removed from the 
Caribbean Financial Action Task Force list of high-risk and non-cooperative jurisdictions. 
 
In December 2016, the Guyanese government launched a National Drug Strategy Masterplan and 
announced the creation of a National Anti-Narcotics Agency (NANA).  NANA coordinates and 
ensures collaboration among the five anti-narcotics agencies, which are the Guyana Police Force 
(GPF), Guyana Revenue Authority (GRA), the Customs Anti-Narcotics Unit (CANU), the 
Special Organized Crime Unit (SOCU), and the Guyana Defense Force (GDF).  The GDF 
supports law enforcement agencies with boats, aircraft, and personnel but has limited capacity 
and lacks law enforcement authority.   
 
The Financial Intelligence Unit (FIU) has the mandate to detect, prevent, and deter money 
laundering and financing of terrorist activities in Guyana.  FIU prepares suspicious transactions 
reports for the SOCU to investigate.  In July, the FIU purchased updated software to detect 
illegal financial activities and was in the process of hiring a financial analyst and a legal advisor 
at the close of 2017.  
 
In 2008 Guyana acceded to, and has submitted requests pursuant to, the Inter-American 
Convention on Mutual Assistance in Criminal Matters, to which the United States is also a party.  


INCSR 2018 Volume 1

Guyana has bilateral counternarcotics agreements with its neighbors and the United Kingdom.  
Guyana is a member of the Organization of American States’ Inter-American Drug Abuse 
Control Commission (OAS/CICAD).  Guyana signed a maritime counternarcotics bilateral 
agreement with the United States in 2001 but has yet to take the necessary domestic action to 
bring the agreement into effect.  The 1931 Extradition Treaty between the United States and the 
United Kingdom is applicable to the United States and Guyana.  In 2017, the United States and 
Guyana each made extradition requests to the other pursuant to this Treaty. 
 
 
2.  Supply Reduction  
 
Guyana has a drug enforcement presence at its international airports, post offices, and, to a lesser 
extent, at port and land-border entry points.  During the first six months of 2017, the GPF 
reported seizing 22 kilograms (kg) of cocaine and approximately 12 kg of cannabis, while 
CANU reported seizing approximately 248 kg of cocaine and approximately 66 kg of cannabis.  
Guyanese authorities initiated 503 prosecutions and convicted 227 individuals for drug 
trafficking during this six-month period. 
 
 
3.  Public Information, Prevention, and Treatment 
 
Guyana has a comprehensive demand reduction strategy that adequately addresses drug 
rehabilitation.  Marijuana is the most widely used illicit drug in Guyana, followed by cocaine.  
The Guyana National Council for Drug Education, Rehabilitation, and Treatment, within the 
Ministry of Public Health, is the only government body responsible for addressing demand 
reduction.  Non-governmental organizations also offer rehabilitation services, with the 
Government of Guyana providing financial assistance.  The Georgetown Public Hospital also 
provides free rehabilitation services for drug users.  The University of Guyana has a demand 
reduction curriculum in place through OAS/CICAD funding.  The Guyanese government also 
conducts anti-drug awareness sessions in secondary schools and has plans to create drug 
treatment courts.  As part of the Caribbean Basin Security Initiative (CBSI), the United States 
supports Guyana by providing targeted training for law enforcement and maritime officers.   
 
 
4.  Corruption  
 
As a matter of policy, the Government of Guyana does not encourage or facilitate the illicit 
production or distribution of narcotics or psychotropic drugs or other controlled substances or the 
laundering of proceeds from illegal drug transactions.  However, a lack of resources, weak law 
enforcement institutions, an ineffective judicial system, and inadequate compensation for civil 
service employees and public safety officials facilitate corruption throughout all sectors.      
 
The Guyanese government has strict policies against corruption, but has difficulty in 
investigating and successfully prosecuting corruption cases.  In May, the government passed the 
State Asset Recovery Act and created the State Asset Recovery Agency, bringing the 
government in full compliance with the United Nation Convention against Corruption.  In 
September, the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime, supported by U.S. funding, 
appointed a representative to Guyana to support and strengthen the national capacity to fight 
anti-corruption and money laundering activities.       


INCSR 2018 Volume 1  
 
 
 
 
Country Reports 
178 
 
 
C.  National Goals, Bilateral Cooperation, and U.S. Policy Initiatives 
 
The United States supports a wide range of efforts designed to address crime and violence 
affecting Guyanese citizens, primarily through CBSI.  CBSI is a security partnership between the 
United States and Caribbean nations that seeks to substantially reduce illicit trafficking, advance 
public safety and citizen security, and promote justice.  Efforts to increase law enforcement 
capabilities, protect borders and ports, strengthen workforce development, and promote anti-
money laundering effectiveness directly address priority concerns shared by Guyana and the 
United States. 
 
The Guyanese government cooperates closely with all relevant U.S. agencies but is limited by 
resource constraints.  The current administration (which took office in May 2015) has expressed 
a strong willingness to cooperate further with the United States on drug control, extradition, 
mutual legal assistance, and other international crime issues. 
 
CBSI-funded programs support Guyana’s maritime operations by providing interdiction assets, 
relevant command and control systems, and associated logistical support and training.  In 2017, 
the United States provided port and maritime training to Guyana’s Coast Guard.  U.S. assistance 
programs also promote law enforcement professionalization and more effective drug 
investigations.  By strengthening Guyana’s drug enforcement capabilities, the United States 
seeks to enhance interagency coordination and help gather better information on drug trafficking 
routes. 
 
D.  Conclusion 
 
The United States enjoys strong cooperation with Guyana in advancing mutual interests against 
the threat of international drug trafficking.  Guyana has shown strong interest in furthering 
collaboration under CBSI.  The United States looks forward to tangible progress on 
investigations, prosecutions, extraditions, security sector capacity enhancement, the engagement 
of at-risk communities, and enforcement of laws against money laundering and financial crimes.  
The major limiting factor is a lack of resources.

Haiti 
 
A.  Introduction 
 
Haiti remains a transit point for cocaine originating in South America and marijuana originating 
in Jamaica, traversing the country’s porous borders en route to the United States and other 
markets.  Traffickers take advantage of Haiti’s severely under-patrolled maritime borders, 
particularly on the northern and southern coasts.  Haiti is not a significant producer of illicit 
drugs for export, although some cannabis is cultivated for local consumption.  Haiti’s primarily 
subsistence-level economy does not provide an environment conducive to high levels of 
domestic drug use. 
 
In 2017, the Haitian government continued to strengthen the Haitian National Police (HNP) and 
its drug enforcement unit (Bureau for the Fight Against Narcotics Trafficking, or BLTS) with 
additional human resources, and officials at the highest levels of government have repeatedly 
committed to fight drug trafficking.  However, seizures of illicit drugs and smuggled cash 
declined in 2017 and the government was unable to adequately secure the borders to reduce the 
flow of illegal drugs.  Principal land border crossings with the Dominican Republic are largely 
uncontrolled and the southern coastline remains virtually law enforcement-free.  The minimal 
interdiction capacity of the Haitian Coast Guard creates a low-risk environment for drug 
traffickers to operate.  While Haiti’s domestic law enforcement interdiction capacity improved 
marginally, a largely ineffective judicial system continues to impede successful prosecution of 
apprehended drug traffickers. 
 
B.  Drug Control Accomplishments, Policies, and Trends  
 
1. Institutional Development 
 
The HNP’s 27th Promotion Class of police cadets graduated in early 2017, and included 84 
women.  The 28th HNP class of 1,050 recruits graduated in December 2017, bringing the total 
number of HNP officers to over 15,400 and exceeding the HNP’s five-year goal (set in 2013) of 
a 15,000 member force.  A larger force will enable the HNP to assume increasing responsibility 
for security, in the wake of the transition from the United Nations Stabilization Mission in Haiti 
(MINUSTAH) to the UN Mission for Justice Support in Haiti (MINUJUSTH), which occurred 
on October 16. 
 
The HNP’s counter-drug unit, BLTS, remains the domestic institution dedicated to interdicting 
drug traffic.  In 2017, the HNP deployed BLTS officers to regional outposts in Malpasse, near 
the border crossing with the Dominican Republic.  Haitian Coast Guard (HCG) officers were 
also deployed to the outpost in Port-de-Paix (north west region), supporting a force of BLTS 
officers already stationed at this post.  In 2018, HNP is planning to add BLTS officers to the 
newly constructed outpost in Jacmel (south east region) and Terrier Rouge (north east region). 
 
U.S.-provided training in 2017 further increased the operational capacities of the Maritime 
Counter Narcotic BLTS-HCG task force, and a partially-vetted BLTS unit participated in 


INCSR 2018 Volume 1  
 
 
 
 
Country Reports 
180 
 
sensitive operations led by the U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA).  Infrastructure 
support for canine units was also installed in Port-au-Prince, Les Cayes, and Cap Haitien. 
 
The HNP faces challenges regulating its internal affairs, particularly in the south and in remote 
provinces, though it continues to work to address the problem.  The HNP’s Office of the 
Inspector General (OIG) investigates reports of officer misconduct, including participation in 
drug trafficking.  In 2017, the HNP took steps toward imposing systematic discipline on officers 
found to have committed abuses or fraud, but civil society continued to allege widespread 
impunity.  The HNP held monthly press conferences that served as awareness campaigns to 
inform the public of their roles and responsibilities, and to report on cases of misconduct.  The 
OIG maintained a 24-hour hotline to receive public reports of police corruption or misconduct.  
As of August 2017, the OIG recommended 11 officers for dismissal, compared with 27 such 
recommendations during the same period in 2016.   
 
The HCG is the sole maritime enforcement agency in the country, responsible for securing the 
country’s maritime borders.  HCG added an additional 42 officers from the 26th HNP class, 
bringing the overall staffing of the unit to 202 officers.  The HCG has operating bases in Cap 
Haitien, Killick (Port-au-Prince), and Les Cayes.  While the HCG has a total of 11 maritime 
vessels, only five are currently operational.  Maritime domain awareness and enforcement are 
daunting tasks for the HCG, considering Haiti’s 1,100 miles of coastline and seven international 
ports.  Operational capacity remains low due to insufficient funding, management deficiencies, 
an inability to refuel, and unavailability of locally procured parts to maintain the vessels reliably.  
These issues prevented the HCG from serving as an effective deterrent force to maritime drug 
trafficking. 
 
Haiti maintains several international agreements on drug control commitments and often 
cooperates effectively with the United States on drug-related cases.  A 1997 bilateral letter of 
agreement on Cooperation to Suppress Illicit Maritime Drug Traffic allows U.S. law 
enforcement agencies to enter Haitian territorial waters and airspace in pursuit of suspect vessels 
or aircraft; to board and search suspect vessels; to patrol Haitian airspace; and to carry members 
of the HCG as ship riders.  Although there is no mutual legal assistance treaty between Haiti and 
the United States, the Haitian government has cooperated on many cases within the limits of 
Haitian law.  A bilateral extradition treaty entered into force in 1905 and, the Government of 
Haiti surrendered persons under indictment in the United States to United States law 
enforcement agencies. 
 
2. Supply Reduction 
 
BLTS executed several successful operations in 2017 that resulted in the seizure of 
approximately 1.02 metric tons of marijuana and 47.85 kilograms (kg) of cocaine during the first 
10 months of the year.  A total of 110 suspects were arrested for drug-related crimes during this 
period, and one high-value target was surrendered to U.S. authorities and prosecuted on drug 
related charges.  DEA and the U.S. Coast Guard (USCG) routinely conduct joint operations with 
BLTS and provide assistance in operational planning and intelligence gathering.  A total of 83 kg 
of cocaine was seized coming out of Haiti in joint operations involving Bahamian law

enforcement and DEA.  There is no significant availability or traffic of illegal synthetic drugs in 
Haiti. 
 
3. Public Information, Prevention, and Treatment 
 
Illicit drug abuse is uncommon in Haiti, as the population’s minimal discretionary income 
mitigates against a widespread drug abuse problem.  The Government of Haiti runs small-scale 
public awareness and demand reduction programs funded through the counternarcotics policy 
commission (CONALD), but there is no data on these programs’ impact or utility.  The United 
States provides funding for the Community Anti-Drug Coalitions of America, which carries out 
drug abuse prevention training with local non-government organizations, and a Haitian private 
sector association called APAAC receives funds from CONALD and conducts prevention and 
awareness activities. 
 
4. Corruption 
 
As a matter of policy, the Haitian government does not encourage or facilitate illegal activity 
associated with drug trafficking, or the laundering of proceeds from illicit drug transactions.  
Effective government action to fight corruption, however, particularly related to illicit drugs, is 
constrained by two major factors.  The first is a historically weak legal framework.  Haiti did not 
specifically codify corruption as a crime until 2014, when a law formally criminalized public 
corruption and set penalties for bribery and illegal procurement.  Implementation of this law 
remains a challenge, but training of judicial personnel on the law’s requirements is 
underway.  Haiti’s asset seizure laws have enabled the financial intelligence unit (Central Unit of 
Financial Investigations) and the HNP’s financial crimes unit (Financial and Economic Affairs 
Bureau) to seize the assets of drug traffickers convicted outside of Haiti.  The Haitian 
constitution’s grant of blanket immunity from prosecution to members of Parliament, however, is 
a point of concern for anti-corruption and drug enforcement efforts. 
 
The second constraining factor is systematically poor judicial performance, due to antiquated 
penal and criminal procedure codes, opaque court proceedings, lack of oversight, and widespread 
judicial corruption.  To date, there have been no successful convictions for drug trafficking, and 
only one conviction on corruption-related charges in Haitian courts.  The Haitian Unit for 
Combatting Corruption advanced 32 corruption-related cases to the judiciary since its inception 
in 2005, but without tangible results. 
 
C.  National Goals, Bilateral Cooperation, and U.S. Policy Initiatives 
 
U.S. drug control initiatives in Haiti focus on improving the capacity of the HNP, BLTS, and the 
HCG to detect, investigate, and deter the flow of illegal drugs.  A 2004 letter of agreement (as 
amended) between the United States and Haiti and a second agreement signed in 2013 (amended 
annually) govern these activities.  Core goals enshrined in the agreements are to increase overall 
counter-drug capabilities, interdict drug shipments, and develop cases against traffickers and 
criminal organizations.  The continued growth of BLTS’s staffing, strong coordination on 
executing drug enforcement operations in conjunction with U.S. agencies, and total seizures of 


INCSR 2018 Volume 1  
 
 
 
 
Country Reports 
182 
 
drugs in 2017 were all positive signs for its operational record.  Still, the continued absence of 
convictions in narcotics cases underscored the ongoing under-performance of the judicial system. 
 
U.S. assistance is directed to the general development of the HNP and the targeted support of the 
BLTS via complementary programs.  Support to the HNP covers a broad range of activities, 
including infrastructure, equipment, and training.  Improved operational capacity and 
professionalism of the HNP are necessary for effective drug enforcement activity in Haiti.  
 
Specific U.S. support to the BLTS includes provision of communications equipment, vehicles, 
non-lethal operational gear, and canine unit training.  U.S. support includes multiple training 
opportunities for BLTS officers, including trainings both in the United States and in third 
countries, such as at the U.S.-supported International Law Enforcement Academy (ILEA) in El 
Salvador.  The United States also funds joint enforcement operations between DEA, the USCG, 
and the HNP/BLTS. 
 
The United States provided training and assistance for the establishment of the joint Maritime 
Counter Narcotic BLTS-HCG task force conducting maritime interdiction operations from its 
base in Les Cayes.  The task force is now looking to increase its patrol and operational 
capabilities in Jacmel.  If successful, this pilot program will expand to other jurisdictions, such as 
Cap-Haitien. 
 
The United States will continue to support training of high ranking HNP officials within the 
United States, including in cooperation with various U.S. police agencies, to develop leaders that 
can serve as agents of change within the HNP.  
 
U.S. assistance also supports refurbishment and maintenance of two INL-purchased vessels and 
one boat donated by the Government of Canada at the Cap Haitien base; law enforcement 
training; mobile training teams and professional development; vessel refurbishment and 
maintenance; electronic equipment; and HCG facility modernization. 
 
D.  Conclusion 
 
The continued institutional development of both the HNP and the BLTS are positive trends that 
have helped to improve public security and have marginally increased Haiti’s ability to interdict 
drug trafficking.  Continued strong cooperation between Haitian and U.S. law enforcement 
yielded important drug seizures and enabled the apprehension and return of an individual 
indicted in the United States to stand trial.  However, the dysfunctional Haitian judicial system 
drastically limits domestic prosecution of drug cases and thus reduces disincentives to trafficking 
operations.  Drug seizures still remain low, and Haiti’s minimal capacity to police its sea and 
land borders continues to be a particular point of concern. 
 
Continued engagement from the United States, particularly in support of BLTS operations and 
general HNP development, will help Haitian law enforcement to capitalize on marginal gains in 
drug interdiction capacity.  The benefits of such gains will be limited if the judicial system 
remains weak and fails to convict drug traffickers.  Only the concurrent strengthening of the

183 
 
judiciary, law enforcement, and border security will enable Haiti to make real progress in 
combatting drug trafficking.

Honduras 
 
A.  Introduction 
 
Honduras is a transit country for cocaine and precursor chemicals used to produce illicit drugs.  
According to U.S. government estimates, the volume of cocaine transiting Honduras in 2017 was 
lower than in 2016, and the number of aircraft suspected of smuggling cocaine into Honduras 
from South America decreased for the second-consecutive year.  However, Honduras remains a 
primary destination country in Central America for cocaine-laden aircraft departing from South 
America.  The Caribbean coast of Central America is vulnerable to drug trafficking due to its 
remoteness, limited infrastructure, lack of government presence, and weak law enforcement 
institutions.   
 
Criminal street gangs responsible for a significant portion of the homicides committed in 
Honduras, such as Mara Salvatrucha (MS-13) and 18th Street, do not appear to be a significant 
part of the transnational drug logistics chain, except as facilitators of trafficking through 
Honduras.  These gangs are typically involved in local drug distribution, extortion, kidnapping, 
and human trafficking.  Nevertheless, their participation in transshipment leads to an increasing 
likelihood of cocaine entering the Honduran drug retail market, as they are often paid in product 
for their services. 
 
B.  Drug Control Accomplishments, Policies, and Trends 
 
1. Institutional Development 
 
Honduran law enforcement institutions, courts, and other agencies demonstrated greater 
effectiveness against drug trafficking in 2017.  This includes both the Honduran National Police 
(HNP) and the Public Ministry, which have dedicated counternarcotic units.  U.S. assistance to 
Honduras in the areas of criminal justice capacity building, information sharing, and training led 
to enhanced coordination, more arrests, and extraditions in 2017. 
 
In 2017, the Honduran government initiated a comprehensive restructuring of the HNP that will 
include establishing new divisions, more direct command and control, new disciplinary 
guidelines, and vetting requirements.  The restructuring effort includes plans to create a 400-
person HNP Antinarcotics Directorate focused exclusively on drug enforcement operations and 
investigations.  While this directorate is not yet operational, the U.S. government provided 
training and advice on design and function. 
 
The Honduran Public Ministry (which includes all prosecutors) demonstrated commitment to 
expanding operations targeting drug trafficking by expanding the Technical Agency of Criminal 
Investigation (ATIC) from 170 to 340 agents, and the Antinarcotic unit (DLCN) from 50 to 285 
agents.   
 
The U.S.-supported HNP Criminal Investigation School (EIC) augmented its curricula to include 
several counternarcotic courses, which provided training to over 300 justice sector officials in 
2017.  The advanced training included coursework on the classification of illegal drugs, 


INCSR 2018 Volume 1  
 
 
 
 
Country Reports 
185 
 
pharmacology, clandestine laboratories, chemical precursors, and trafficking methods.  The EIC 
now incorporates drug control topics in all its courses. 
 
Major challenges for drug control agencies and institutions include corruption, inadequate budget 
resources, and persistent violence.  Corruption, combined with a historically low tax collection 
rate, deprives law enforcement agencies, courts, and prosecutors of critical resources.  The 
Government of Honduras implemented a ten-year security tax in 2014, and while it helped key 
law enforcement institutions, it is widely viewed as inadequate.  Crime continues to be 
unacceptably high in many communities. 
 
Honduras made significant strides in reducing the country’s homicide rate in 2017, which 
declined to an estimated 45 per 100,000 people from its peak of 86 per 100,000 in 2011.  A 
significant portion of the homicides appear linked to turf conflicts between criminal 
organizations involved in drug trafficking and extortion that undermine greater citizen security 
within the country.   
 
Honduras is a party to several regional agreements that focus on drug trafficking, including the 
Organization of American States’ Inter-American Drug Abuse Control Commission and the 
Caribbean Regional Agreement on Maritime Counternarcotics.  Honduras has ratified the Inter-
American Convention on Mutual Assistance in Criminal Matters. 
 
 
2.  Supply Reduction 
 
With support from U.S. law enforcement, the Government of Honduras achieved some success 
in arresting leaders of drug-trafficking organizations in 2017, surrendering many to the United 
States through the extradition process.  These efforts contributed substantially to the 
dismantlement of drug trafficking organizations.  Nevertheless, new criminal bosses and 
syndicate leaders constantly emerge to fill the voids caused by arrests and extraditions, and 
continue to smuggle cocaine and participate in other forms of crime.   
 
The Honduran military made few improvements in 2017 to increase its capabilities to degrade 
and disrupt illicit trafficking.  Although the Honduran Navy responded to over 50 suspected 
maritime trafficking events, only 850 kilograms of cocaine were seized, and significant volumes 
of cocaine continued to reach Honduran shores.   
 
The low success rate in interdicting drug shipments off the Honduran coast appears primarily a 
result of long distances between command and control nodes and the lack of an efficient 
mechanism for the Honduran military to share operational intelligence with Honduran civilian 
security forces in a timely and secure manner.  The Navy also attributes their low seizure rate to 
their lack of access to Honduras’ only Maritime Patrol Aircraft, which is under the jurisdiction of 
Honduras' National Inter-Agency Security Force (FUSINA).  Alleged corruption within some 
military units further impedes progress in active drug corridors, such as the Gracias a Dios 
Department and northern Caribbean coast.  Wiretapping facilities are controlled by the military 
and access to wiretapping results for civilian law enforcement remains inadequate, resulting in a 
significant loss of actionable intelligence. 
 


INCSR 2018 Volume 1  
 
 
 
 
Country Reports 
186 
 
 
3.  Public Information, Prevention, and Treatment 
 
The HNP continued to host targeted community outreach activities in 2017 to foster closer 
relations between the police and citizens, reaching an estimated 100,000 citizens during the year.  
These events were held primarily in the most violence-prone districts of San Pedro Sula and 
Tegucigalpa, where the U.S. government is implementing comprehensive violence-reduction 
programming and often included free medical care from non-governmental organizations and 
police medics.  Indicators of increased public trust include the sustained attendance at these 
events over the year, positive informal polling results, and an increase in calls to 911 and local 
police “tip” lines.   
 
In 2017, through a bilateral agreement, the United States continued to support comprehensive, 
balanced, and coordinated approaches to increase the capacity of the Government of Honduras to 
address and counter the demand for illegal drugs.  Assistance included continuing support to the 
U.S. Gang Resistance Education and Training (GREAT) program, which trained nearly 80,000 
students in 2017.  Other U.S.-supported grants provided support to host country institutions that 
deal with drug treatment and prevention in the highest risk areas of Honduras.  
 
 
4.  Corruption 
 
The Government of Honduras does not, as a matter of government policy, encourage or facilitate 
illicit drug production or distribution, nor is it involved in laundering the proceeds of the sale of 
illicit drugs.  However, corruption remains widespread in public institutions.  In 2017, the 
Special Commission for the Purging and Restructuring of the HNP completed its original 
mission to expunge corrupt police officers from the force, and simultaneously, pursued extensive 
legislation on police reform.  In just over a year, the Special Commission identified and removed 
more than 4,400 police officers.  During the same period, the HNP hired nearly 4,000 new 
officers, and report being on target to reach 26,000 officers by 2022.   
 
In April 2017, the OAS Mission to Support the Fight Against Corruption and Impunity in 
Honduras (MACCIH) completed one year of operations with a series of successes.  These 
included the implementation of an anti-corruption court with national jurisdiction, assisting the 
Public Ministry to create a fully-vetted anti-corruption investigative unit, and conviction of 
several emblematic cases including those involving the theft of funds from the Honduran Social 
Security Institute.  In September, the Honduran congress adopted a reform law proposed by the 
MACCIH.  The new law establishes a commission to supervise electoral campaigns and sets out 
penalties for violations.  These can range from fines to the termination of the candidacy of 
individuals and even parties.  MACCIH plans to continue its work on corruption into 2018, with 
a focus on large scale emblematic case investigations.   
 
C.  National Goals, Bilateral Cooperation, and U.S. Policy Initiatives 
 
The United States continues to provide assistance through the Central America Regional Security 
Initiative (CARSI) aimed at improving the professional capabilities and integrity of Honduran 
justice sector officials, consistent with the U.S. Strategy for Engagement in Central America, and 
the Central American governments’ Alliance for Prosperity initiative.  The overall objective of 


INCSR 2018 Volume 1  
 
 
 
 
Country Reports 
187 
 
U.S. assistance efforts is to reinforce Honduran security and justice sector institutions so they are 
able to fully account for their nation’s security, stability, and prosperity.  
 
The Government of Honduras passed two new police laws in 2017 aimed at overhauling the 
entire national police force – the Police Organic Law and the Police Career Law.  Signature 
articles of the laws include the creation of an internal investigative body (DIDAPOL) aimed to 
eliminate the need for any future purges of the force, and the designation of specialized 
directorates in charge of policing priorities such as transit, special operations, border/frontier 
police, and dignitary protection, among others.  Once implemented, these new laws will support 
mutual goals of increasing the size and quality of the professional civil police force. 
 
With U.S. government assistance, the HNP established a total of 24 Model Police Precincts 
(MPP) in Honduras since 2014.  These MPPs operate in the highest-crimes areas of Tegucigalpa 
and San Pedro Sula.  The MPP program works with the HNP to operationalize the Honduran 
Model for Community Policing.  The model advocates elevated policing in high-crime areas, 
proactive patrol, and community outreach and relationship building.  The HNP also approved the 
Field Officer Training concept which ensures officers have the necessary skill sets to support this 
model. 
 
Honduras made significant progress in reforming and enhancing its border security and 
increasing regional cooperation on border security issues.  In 2017, the Border Police Directorate 
was reformed and now consists of 180 police officers trained by graduates of the U.S. Customs 
and Border Patrol training program.  In 2017, the U.S. facilitated the exchange of Honduran and 
Guatemala officers to participate in reciprocal training by both law enforcement and border 
academies, creating an atmosphere of cooperation and information sharing.  The Honduran 
Border Police Directorate’s special operations unit (GOET) conducts border and tactical support 
missions for the HNP and the Honduran Public Ministry, as well as training for the Directorate. 
 
Honduras participated in the semi-annual Multilateral Maritime Counter Drug Summit held in 
November 2017, which attracted 125 maritime counterdrug professionals from nearly 25 
countries and over 65 international agencies spanning North, Central and South America, and 
Europe.    
 
D.  Conclusion 
 
The United States works closely with Honduran authorities to improve the host government’s 
capacity to provide security and justice to its citizens.  In 2017, Honduras made notable progress 
in the fight against criminal organizations through enhanced institutional capacity, improved 
interagency and regional cooperation, and passage of key pieces of legislation.  These 
achievements are often challenged by significantly high rates of violent crime, inadequate 
budget, and a national police that is in the midst of transformation.  Honduras had many 
successes in 2017, but will need to continue to reform its institutions, accelerate judicial 
processes, pass and implement key legislation, and provide adequate resources to its justice 
sector operators to continue to improve citizen security and strengthen national institutions.

India 
 
A.  Introduction 
 
India’s geographic location and transport links make it an attractive transshipment area for illicit 
drugs bound for Europe, Africa, Southeast Asia, and North America.  Cross-border heroin 
trafficking from Pakistan to India continues to be a major problem due to India’s porous borders 
and limited enforcement capacity that have prevented the Indian Border Security Forces (BSF) 
from reducing smuggling.  There is also evidence that opium poppy is grown illicitly in India, 
especially in the northeastern region.   
 
Given India’s size and large population, accurate estimates of the extent, pattern, and nature of 
the drug problem in India are difficult.  India suffers from the abuse of pharmaceutical drugs 
with a ready supply of drugs easily available over the counter at most pharmacies.  India is 
estimated to legally export twice the amount of pharmaceutical drugs as China, presenting 
widespread opportunity for illicit diversion.  In 2016, India was estimated to legitimately export 
$13 billion worth of pharmaceutical drugs.     
 
India is authorized by the international community to produce licit opium for pharmaceutical 
uses, and is a major producer of precursor chemicals.  India also manufactures organic and 
synthetic licit opiate/psychotropic pharmaceuticals (LOPPS).  India’s large pharmaceutical 
industry is faced with increasing diversion of pharmaceuticals for illicit purposes to the United 
States and other countries.   
 
Trafficking of the opioid tramadol from India is a significant problem.  Seizures of millions of 
tramadol pills originating in India have been made in Asia, Africa, and Europe.  Tramadol is 
currently not a controlled substance in India.   
 
U.S.-based persons illegally obtain controlled pharmaceutical drugs from India via online 
purchase (through both open and restricted “dark web” internet sites) or through traditional call 
centers.  Thousands of illegal mail shipments of pharmaceutical drugs are sent to the United 
States, feeding the current opioid epidemic.       
 
Neighboring countries including Nepal and Bhutan have also identified Indian pharmaceutical 
drugs as a major problem contributing to drug abuse.   
 
India seeks to enhance its law enforcement capacity through increased training for law 
enforcement officers and continues to pursue opportunities for international cooperation in an 
effort to improve the effectiveness of both demand and supply control efforts.  This effort is 
hampered by a lack of resources for law enforcement agencies, particularly human resources.  
Indian law enforcement agencies are much smaller than needed to effectively counter narcotics 
trafficking.  Insufficient information technology, including integrated networks and case 
management software, hamper the day-to-day enforcement of Indian drug laws.   
 
B.  Drug Control Accomplishments, Policies, and Trends

1.  Institutional Development 
 
India continues to tighten regulations and increase training of law enforcement officers.  
However, the capacity of India’s drug law enforcement personnel to collect and analyze data and 
to initiate and conduct complex investigations against criminal drug manufacturing and 
trafficking remains limited by inadequate training, a lack of modern equipment, insufficient 
staffing, and poor interagency coordination. 
 
 
The Narcotics Control Bureau (NCB) is India’s primary national drug control agency, 
established to prevent and combat the abuse of narcotic drugs and psychotropic substances.  
Under India’s stringent Narcotic Drugs and Psychotropic Substances (NDPS) Act of 1985, the 
Directorate of Revenue Intelligence (DRI) and the Indian Customs Service also have 
responsibility for illicit drug investigations.  In 2017, NCB successfully coordinated multiple 
investigations targeting international drug trafficking syndicates and continued expansion of its 
geographic presence across India.   
 
The Central Bureau of Narcotics (CBN) supervises licit cultivation of opium poppy in India.  
CBN is responsible for abuse prevention and law enforcement functions; investigations of 
violations of the NDPS Act including illicit cultivation and production; the issuance of licenses 
for the manufacture of synthetic narcotic drugs; export authorizations; import/export certificates 
for narcotic drugs and psychotropic substances; issuing No Objection Certificates for select 
precursor chemicals; and the import of poppy seeds used in licit poppy cultivation.  CBN 
interacts with the International Narcotics Control Board (INCB) and the governments of other 
countries to supervise international transactions. 
 
The Border Security Force (BSF) and Central Board of Excise Customs (CBEC) share primary 
responsibility for monitoring India’s borders.  CBEC manages official border crossing 
checkpoints with Pakistan and is responsible for checking all cargo and persons entering India.  
Porous borders and capacity limitations limit the effectiveness of BSF and CBEC, complicating 
efforts to combat illegal smuggling.  This porous border contributes to the movement of Afghan-
produced opiates throughout the region.  BSF and CBEC continue to lack the technology 
necessary to keep pace with traffickers using advanced communications systems. 
 
India’s various national and state-level law enforcement agencies face challenges in 
institutionalizing effective coordination.  Poor intelligence exploitation during drug seizures 
results in few investigative leads.  Lengthy delays between drug seizures and prosecutions 
complicate efforts to develop an effective enforcement and prosecution strategy.  The lack of 
modern drug legislation and effective drug courts severely hampers the ability of Indian law 
enforcement agencies to conduct complex drug conspiracy investigations. 
 
The Government of India has entered into bilateral agreements with 23 countries on demand 
reduction and the prevention of illicit trafficking in drugs, psychotropic substances, and 
precursor chemicals.  India has an extradition treaty and a mutual legal assistance treaty with the 
United States, and both are used routinely. 
 
 
2.  Supply Reduction 


INCSR 2018 Volume 1  
 
 
 
 
Country Reports

The diversion of precursor chemicals from licit producers to illicit brokers is a serious problem.  
India-based precursor trafficking organizations are involved in the illicit exportation and 
domestic sale of precursor chemicals such as ephedrine and pseudoephedrine, both of which are 
used in the manufacture of methamphetamine.  In April 2016, approximately 20.5 metric tons 
(MT) of ephedrine were seized in the Mumbai metropolitan area that was to be shipped to 
Mombasa, Kenya.   
 
In light of this challenge, India has undertaken significant efforts to control precursor chemicals 
produced in its large chemical industry and actively participates in international precursor control 
initiatives as Project Cohesion and Project Prism.  
 
Supplies of MDMA and ketamine manufactured in India have also been seized.  In October 
2016, approximately 23.5 MT of methaqualone produced in India were seized in northern India 
in a joint operation between the U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) and DRI 
investigation.   
 
India issues pre-export notifications for exports of precursors using an online system developed 
by the INCB, and administers a sophisticated licensing regime to control dual use pharmaceutical 
products.  India regulates 17 of 23 precursor chemicals listed by the 1988 UN Convention.  Of 
the 17 chemicals, India’s NDPS Act designates five as “Schedule A” substances subject to the 
most stringent controls:  acetic anhydride, ephedrine, pseudoephedrine, n-acetylanthranilic acid, 
and anthranilic acid.  India is a source for acetic anhydride, a necessary precursor material in 
clandestine heroin conversion laboratories.   
 
NCB continues to use satellite imagery and other intelligence methods to track and reduce illicit 
opium poppy cultivation.  Because of the poor quality of satellite imagery, NCB has had to rely 
on visual verification of illicit opium poppy cultivation sites across India.  In India’s northeast 
states, where illicit poppy production is widespread, insurgent groups reportedly protect the 
poppy sites in exchange for compensation from traffickers and cultivators, complicating NCB 
efforts to identify and eradicate illicit cultivation.   
 
 
3.  Public Information, Prevention, and Treatment  
 
India’s demand reduction strategy is under the purview of India’s Ministry of Social Justice and 
Empowerment (MSJE), but NCB acts as a primary coordinator of the strategy.  The MSJE 
operates a three-pronged strategy for demand reduction, including promoting drug abuse 
awareness and education, counseling and treatment programs, and training demand reduction 
volunteers.  India observed the United Nations-sponsored International Day against Drug Abuse 
and Illicit Trafficking on June 26, 2017, with programs focusing on raising awareness of the 
harmful effects of drug abuse.  Drug treatment and rehabilitation services are mainly provided by 
non-governmental organizations.  Accurate information on the national prevalence of drug abuse 
is not available as India has not conducted a national household survey on substance abuse since 
2000-2001.

In July 2016, the Ministry of Social Justice and Empowerment of India, in collaboration with the 
National Drug Dependence Treatment Centre of the All India Institute of Medical Sciences, 
began conducting a survey to compile national and state-level estimates of the numbers of 
persons abusing drugs.  The two-year-long survey will map the presence of treatment and 
rehabilitation services for drug-dependent individuals and identify the gaps in service delivery.  
An opioid dependence survey carried out in Punjab in 2015 found that of the state’s population 
of 28 million, 230,000 persons, mostly male, were opioid dependent and 860,000 were opioid 
users. 
 
 
4.  Corruption 
 
The Government of India does not, as a matter of government policy, encourage or facilitate 
illicit drug production or distribution, nor is it involved in laundering the proceeds of the sale of 
illicit drugs.  In 1964, the Central Vigilance Commission (CVC) was established by law as an 
independent body to issue guidelines and conduct inquiries regarding government corruption.  
The CVC reports to the President of India through the Indian Parliament.  Corruption is 
pervasive across police forces at all levels of government, and officers are rarely held 
accountable for illegal actions.  Official corruption has historically undermined the effectiveness 
of government control regimes for illicit drugs.  Indian media reports allege widespread official 
corruption, with bribes paid to rural police stations and local governance bodies to ignore illicit 
opium poppy and cannabis fields under their jurisdiction.  Corrupt border officials have also 
enabled international trafficking of illicit drugs and precursor chemicals.   
 
C.  National Goals, Bilateral Cooperation, and U.S. Policy Initiatives 
 
Law enforcement agencies in India continued extensive cooperation in 2017 with DEA that led 
to arrests and seizures of significant amounts of narcotics.  Indian law enforcement authorities 
continue to work with DEA to target international drug organizations based in the United States 
and other locations with extensive ties to India.  Investigations have shown that India-based 
informal monetary transfer (“hawala”) organizations have transferred proceeds on behalf of 
multiple drug trafficking organizations.  
 
D.  Conclusion 
 
Significant drug-related challenges facing the Indian government include rising 
methamphetamine manufacturing and trafficking; diversion of controlled substances from both 
licit and illicit channels; smuggling of pharmaceuticals containing narcotic drugs and 
psychotropic substances from India to neighboring countries; and capability deficits and poor 
coordination among India’s various drug enforcement agencies.  
 
The profitability of manufacturing and distribution of methamphetamine and other drugs has 
transformed India from a drug transit country into a significant source of precursor chemicals 
and drugs.  Global demand for methamphetamine, heroin, and drug precursors has given rise to 
precursor chemical entrepreneurs in India who are retooling commercial chemical factories to 
produce ephedrine, methamphetamine, and other drugs illicitly in staggering quantities.  As the 


INCSR 2018 Volume 1

global price and demand for high quality methamphetamine and other drugs continue to grow, so 
too will illicit precursor chemical manufacturing and trafficking networks operating in India.   
 
Indian law enforcement efforts continue to be hampered by an inefficient court system and 
ineffective legal framework for law enforcement and investigative agencies.  Further efforts are 
required to address these institutional challenges, as well as to address official corruption, 
improve interagency coordination, and strengthen law enforcement capacity.

Indonesia 
 
A.  Introduction 
 
Indonesia is both a destination and a transshipment point for illicit drugs.  The sprawling 
archipelago nation faces ongoing drug control challenges due to the country’s long coastlines, 
porous borders and endemic corruption.  Drug trafficking networks also operate at dozens of the 
country’s poorly administered prisons.  Marijuana and methamphetamine are the most widely 
used illicit drugs within Indonesia, and crystal methamphetamine (known locally as “shabu”) has 
become increasingly popular.  Much of the crystal methamphetamine available in Indonesia is 
produced in China and trafficked to Indonesia by maritime conveyance.  A “National Drug 
Emergency” first declared by President Joko Widodo in 2015 remained in effect in 2017.  
According to the National Narcotics Board (BNN), 148 persons convicted for drug offenses were 
on death row in 2017, although none of the planned executions had been carried out.  
 
B.  Drug Control Accomplishments, Policies, and Trends 
 
 
1.  Institutional Development 
 
In 2017, officers of BNN and the Indonesian National Police (INP) continued to move 
aggressively against drug-trafficking suspects.  Indonesian media reported that during the first 10 
months of 2017, 64 drug suspects were killed by law enforcement officers for reportedly 
endangering law enforcement personnel, resisting arrest, or attempting to flee from arrest.  Police 
officials asserted that law enforcement personnel used proportional force and claimed that 
incidents resulting in death were subject to internal review.  The INP chief stated in July that his 
officers would take “firm actions” to deal with international drug syndicates, of which BNN 
estimated there were 72 operating within the country.  Prisons are a key center for drug 
trafficking organizations to coordinate operations.  In February 2017, BNN announced that it had 
found inmates orchestrating the sale of illegal drugs at 39 prisons.  Endemic corruption, 
including in prisons, remained a challenge.  The Indonesian government announced plans in 
2017 to establish maximum-security prisons exclusively for serious drug criminals.   
 
Indonesia continued to coordinate with international partners on drug interdiction, including the 
United States and China.  The United States continued to provide counternarcotics training to 
BNN and the INP, including for more than 45 law enforcement officers at a workshop held in 
January 2017 in Nusa Dua, Bali.  Participants received training in such areas as financial 
analysis, internet investigations, graphic analysis and confidential sources.  U.S. law enforcement 
agencies also continued to share information on international trafficking investigations with 
Indonesian counterparts.  No mutual legal assistance treaty or extradition treaty exists between 
Indonesia and the United States.    
 
 
2.  Supply Reduction 
 
Indonesian law enforcement agencies made a number of significant seizures during 2017.  The 
largest, in July, was assisted by the Jakarta country office of the U.S. Drug Enforcement 
Administration and involved the seizure of approximately one metric ton of crystal 


INCSR 2018 Volume 1  
 
 
 
 
Country Reports

methamphetamine.  This seizure represented the largest to date by Indonesian law enforcement.  
Nevertheless, senior Indonesian drug control officials concede that interdiction efforts are not 
keeping pace with growing drug traffic through the country.  During the first four months of 
2017, BNN reported seizing assets totaling $1.3 million from drug traffickers.  
 
The Government identified 66 new psychoactive substances in Indonesia in 2017.  In mid-2017, 
the Ministry of Health, on the recommendation of BNN, issued a ministerial regulation that 
rendered 43 of these 66 substances illegal. 
 
 
3.  Public Information, Prevention, and Treatment 
 
In February 2017, BNN published a national survey on drug abuse among students aged 11 to 
27, including those at institutes of higher education.  The survey results indicated that the 
number of drug users was four out of every 100 students.  Jakarta, the country’s capital and 
largest city, had the greatest number of student drug users.  Male drug users outnumbered female 
drug users four to one.  The survey found that the most widely used drugs were marijuana, 
methamphetamine and heroin.  According to the study, student drug users showed a 28 percent 
higher incidence of “social aggressiveness” (as defined by brawling with other students and 
carrying out petty crimes).   
 
Rehabilitative services are provided by the Indonesian Government, but supply does not meet 
demand.  BNN was one of the government agencies that provided rehabilitative services, and has 
the capacity to offer treatment to up to 20,000 drug users annually.  However, Indonesia’s total 
drug-using population topped four million, according to BNN estimates.  In 2017, BNN 
announced plans to open hundreds of new medical and social rehabilitation facilities for drug 
users all over Indonesia.  
 
 
4.  Corruption 
 
As a matter of public policy, the Government of Indonesia does not encourage or facilitate any 
illegal activity related to drug trafficking, and no senior government officials were known to be 
institutionally involved in any such activity in 2017.  However, corruption at all levels of 
government and society remain endemic, and continues to undermine the country’s drug control 
efforts.  In May 2017, BNN discovered a lavish, air-conditioned prison cell used by a drug 
convict who was able to operate his narcotics business using a phone and a wireless connection.  
Nevertheless, Indonesia made some progress in 2017 in combating official corruption, primarily 
through the actions of the Corruption Eradication Commission.  
 
C.  National Goals, Bilateral Cooperation, and U.S. Policy Initiatives 
 
In 2017, the United States and Indonesia collaborated to establish a number of drug prevention 
and rehabilitation facilities in accordance with an agreement reached at a February 2016 U.S.-
Indonesia Drug Demand Reduction Workshop held in Jakarta.  In 2017, the two countries 
collaborated to open three drug Outreach and Drop In Centers (in Palembang, South Sumatra; 
Karawang, West Java; and Kendari, Southeast Sulawesi); established two Community Anti-Drug 
Coalitions (in Jakarta and Surabaya); expanded training on U.S.-developed Universal Treatment

Curriculum training for at least 91 drug counselors, doctors and treatment practitioners; and 
credentialed at least 70 people as International Certified Addiction Professionals.  Separately, 
U.S. experts shared experiences with Indonesian judges, prosecutors, and drug professionals on 
how the use of drug courts in the United States had saved money, reduced recidivism, and 
contributed to rehabilitation.  
  
D.   Conclusion 
 
Despite the efforts of the Indonesian government, demand for illicit drugs is believed to be 
growing in Indonesia, and transnational syndicates face little difficulty in moving illicit drugs 
into Indonesia.  The United States will continue to help Indonesian law enforcement interdict 
illicit drugs and disrupt the international drug trade, while also helping Indonesia embrace a wide 
range of interventions aimed at reducing drug use and associated problems.

Iran 
 
Iran is a significant transit and destination country for opiates and cannabis products originating 
in Southwest Asia, as well as a source of methamphetamine for both international and domestic 
consumption.  Most opiates and cannabis products are smuggled into Iran across its land borders 
with Afghanistan and Pakistan, though maritime smuggling has increased over the past several 
years.  Iran is a major transit point for Afghan-produced opiates destined for Europe.  The 
Iranian government claims to allocate more than $700 million annually for border security.  
Although Iran’s interdiction efforts along its eastern border with Afghanistan and Pakistan are 
extensive, joint investigations with international law enforcement partners remain rare. 
 
Iran’s Drug Control Headquarters (DCHQ) is the country’s leading drug policy coordination 
body and reports directly to the president.  The country’s Law Enforcement Force (LEF) 
comprises the country’s uniformed police units, including the Anti-Narcotics Police and border 
interdiction forces.  In May, Iranian authorities claimed that LEF seizures of all illicit drugs 
climbed to 631 metric tons during the 2016-2017 Iranian fiscal year (ending on March 20), a 15 
percent increase over the previous fiscal year.  According to data collected by the UN Office on 
Drugs and Crime, Iran’s total annual seizures of opium, morphine, heroin and hashish have 
regularly ranked among the world’s highest, though no data was available for 2017 at the time of 
this report. 
 
Opium is widely available in Iran, largely as a result of Iran’s status as a major opium transit 
country, and the country has one of the highest opiate addiction rates in the world.  According to 
official Iranian government press statements, there are 2.8 million drug users in Iran.  Other non-
governmental observers claim that the real number of users is higher, and continues to grow.  
Opiates account for the majority of substance use disorders, according to DCHQ.  
Methamphetamine and hashish are also widely used.   
 
Non-governmental organizations and the private sector implement the vast majority of demand 
reduction and treatment programs in the country, including opioid substitution treatment, 
voluntary counseling centers, prison-based treatment, and school-based prevention campaigns.  
Over the course of 2017, Iranian drug control and public health officials publicly emphasized the 
government’s commitment to drug addiction treatment and rehabilitation, claiming to endorse a 
more prevention-based model than Iran’s traditional reliance on harsh punishments.  In October, 
the Iranian government approved legislation limiting the use of the death penalty for drug 
trafficking.  Methadone clinics are increasingly prevalent, and in August, Iran opened its first 
hospital for high-school students suffering from substance use disorders.  The scale of the 
country’s population suffering from substance use disorders, however, appears to exceed the 
availability of treatment and rehabilitation programs.

Italy 
 
Italy remains an important transit country and market for illegal drugs.  Synthetic drugs, cocaine, 
hashish, and marijuana are the most commonly consumed illicit drugs within the country.  Law 
enforcement cooperation between the United States and Italy against drug trafficking and other 
forms of transnational crime continues to be excellent.  Throughout 2016, Italian Financial 
Police Guardia di Finanza (GDF) and the U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) 
collaborated on drug seizures and investigations.   
 
Southwest Asian heroin is trafficked into Italy via Middle Eastern and Balkan routes.  Transit 
routes for heroin include the Port of Ancona in Bari and the Bergamo Airport.  Cocaine from 
South America reaches Italy directly via Spain and other transit countries.  The majority of 
cocaine found in Italy originates with Colombian and other South American criminal groups and 
is primarily managed in Italy by the ‘Ndrangheta and Camorra crime syndicates based largely in 
Calabria and Campania.  Italy’s numerous seaports enable the importation of multi-hundred 
kilogram (kg) shipments concealed in commercial cargo or aboard private vessels.  South 
American and Mexican cocaine traffickers use Italy to repatriate drug proceeds via bulk currency 
shipments to Colombia and Mexico and wire transfers throughout the world.  
 
In 2016 (the most recent year for which information is available), Italian authorities seized over 
71 metric tons (MT) of illegal drugs.  This included 4.7 MT of cocaine, primarily from 
Colombia; 496 kg of heroin, mostly from Afghanistan and trafficked via Bulgaria, Greece and 
Albania; 23.9 MT of hashish, mostly smuggled from Morocco and Libya; 41 MT of marijuana 
from Albania; 12,825 doses of amphetamine-type stimulants; and 44.85 kg of amphetamine 
powder.  In 2016, 23,384 people were arrested in Italy on drug-related charges, an 18 percent 
increase from 2015.  Heroin and hashish seizures declined in 2016 from the previous year, but 
cocaine seizures increased by 16 percent, and marijuana seizures jumped by 347 percent.   
 
Since August 2016, the GDF has collaborated with DEA and U.S. Immigration and Customs 
Enforcement (ICE)/Homeland Security Investigations (HSI) on an ongoing transnational drug 
trafficking investigation targeting the ‘Ndrangheta and Camorra crime organizations.  A joint 
DEA-GDF investigation, spanning nine countries and several cities throughout the United States, 
is being carried out in partnership with the U.S. Customs Border Protection (CBP).  To date, this 
investigation has resulted in the seizure of three MT of containerized cocaine entering Italian 
seaports, the seizure of $18,572,470 in bulk currency, and the arrests of 170 ‘Ndrangheta 
members.

Jamaica 
 
A.  Introduction 
 
Jamaica remains the largest Caribbean supplier of marijuana to the United States and a 
significant transit point for cocaine trafficked from South America to North America and other 
international markets.  Traffickers also export Jamaican-grown marijuana to other Caribbean 
countries in return for illicit firearms and other contraband.  Jamaica’s geographic position in the 
western Caribbean and its difficult-to-patrol coastline, high volume of tourist travel, and status as 
a major containerized cargo transshipment hub contribute to its use for drug trafficking via 
commercial shipping, small watercraft, air freight, human couriers, and private aircraft. 
 
Jamaican authorities, supported by U.S. government assistance, increased the frequency of land-
based cocaine seizures in 2017 and made significant investments in capabilities to detect and 
interdict maritime trafficking.  The U.S. and Jamaican governments successfully utilized their 
bilateral mutual legal assistance and extradition treaties, as well as agreements on maritime law 
enforcement cooperation and sharing forfeited assets.  Additionally, the U.S. and Jamaica made 
progress in 2017 toward an agreement to formalize information sharing between customs 
agencies.   
 
Jamaica’s drug control efforts face significant challenges from corruption, organized crime, gang 
activity, resource constraints, and an inefficient criminal justice system.  On the positive side, the 
Jamaican government passed legislation in 2017 aimed at reducing court backlogs and neared 
passage of a bill to create a free-standing, independently-resourced organized crime and 
corruption investigative agency.     
 
B.  Drug Control Accomplishments, Policies, and Trends 
 
 
1.  Institutional Development 
 
Cooperation between the United States and Jamaica against illicit drugs and related transnational 
crime remains strong.  The U.S. government’s primary Jamaican partners are the Jamaica 
Constabulary Force (JCF, police), the Jamaica Defense Force (JDF, military), the Jamaica 
Customs Agency, the Major Organized Crime and Anti-corruption Agency (MOCA), the 
Financial Investigation Division of the Ministry of Finance, and the Office of the Director of 
Public Prosecutions.  Jamaica’s Caribbean Regional Drug Law Enforcement Training Center, 
housed at the JCF’s police college, provides drug enforcement training to several regional 
partners. 
 
The United States and Jamaica are bilateral parties to both a mutual legal assistance treaty and an 
extradition treaty.  The countries have a strong extradition and mutual assistance relationship, 
and both treaties were actively and successfully used in 2017.  The United States and Jamaica 
also utilized a reciprocal agreement to share forfeited criminal assets and a bilateral agreement 
on law enforcement cooperation on maritime interdiction of illicit traffickers, including boarding 
of suspicious vessels and embarkation of law enforcement officials on the other country’s ships. 
 


INCSR 2018 Volume 1  
 
 
 
 
Country Reports 
199 
 
In 2017, the U.S. and Jamaican governments made significant progress toward finalizing a 
bilateral customs mutual assistance agreement (CMAA).  The CMAA will provide a legal 
framework for the exchange of trade information between U.S. and Jamaican customs agencies, 
which in the long term will assist in targeting the flow of drugs, guns, and other contraband 
through U.S. and Jamaican ports of entry.  The CMAA is expected to be signed and in effect by 
early 2018.     
 
The Jamaican government made substantial improvements to its capacity to detect and interdict 
maritime traffickers in 2017, and the Government of Jamaica has identified border protection as 
a top security priority.  The JDF Coast Guard, which is responsible for maritime law 
enforcement in Jamaica’s over 92,000 square mile maritime domain, acquired two new offshore 
patrol vessels capable of remaining at sea for up to two weeks.  The Jamaican military also 
signed an agreement to purchase its first fixed-wing intelligence, surveillance, and 
reconnaissance aircraft, with delivery expected in 2018.  The Jamaican government plans to 
assign a military officer to serve as a liaison at the U.S. Joint Interagency Task Force-South in 
Key West, Florida, for coordination of operations against maritime traffickers.   
 
Jamaica’s efforts to bring traffickers to justice are hobbled by an under-resourced, overburdened 
judicial system.  Repeated delays and trial postponements contribute to growing case backlogs; 
frustration among police, witnesses, jurors, and the public; and ultimately impunity for many 
offenders.  In response, the Jamaican government passed a plea bargain reform bill in July, 
drafted with U.S. support, designed to incentivize plea bargaining to increase the courts’ 
efficiency and reduce the backlog of criminal cases.  The Jamaican government also announced 
in September its intention to hire 10 additional prosecutors.    
 
2.  Supply Reduction 
 
Jamaican police and customs agencies continued to carry out land-based cocaine seizures in 
2017.  According to the JCF, authorities seized over 657 kilograms (kg) of cocaine during the 
first nine months of 2017.  Jamaican authorities seized 1,019 kg during the same period in 2016, 
bolstered by a single 800 kg seizure in April 2016.   
 
Significant cocaine seizures at or near the Port of Kingston in 2017 indicated large shipments 
reached Jamaica via commercial shipping containers from South America.  Cocaine also arrives 
in Jamaica via small “go-fast” watercraft from Central and South America, likely with the 
assistance of larger fishing vessels that serve as mother ships.  After reaching Jamaica, some 
cocaine shipments are transshipped in containers through the Port of Kingston onto vessels 
bound for the United States and other international markets.  Other shipments enter the country 
and are divided into smaller quantities for outbound shipment via other means, including 
concealment in luggage, human couriers, air freight, or small watercraft. 
 
In 2015, Jamaica passed legislation to decriminalize the possession and use of small amounts of 
marijuana for personal use, while possession and use of marijuana for medical purposes was 
legalized.  In October, Jamaica’s Cannabis Licensing Authority issued two licenses for legal 
operation in the medical marijuana industry, the first in the country’s history.

During the first nine months of 2017, Jamaican authorities eradicated 191 hectares (ha) of 
cannabis plants and seized approximately 14.34 metric tons (MT) of cured marijuana, according 
to police data.  Jamaican farmers cultivate an estimated 15,000 ha of cannabis every year, 
according to Jamaican law enforcement authorities.  The police, supported by the United States, 
employ an eradication team to cut growing plants, seize seedlings and cured marijuana, and burn 
them in the field.  The team conducts only manual eradication, since Jamaican law prohibits the 
use of herbicides.   
 
Traffickers smuggle Jamaican-grown marijuana out of the country via commercial shipping and 
small watercraft.  Small fishing vessels and speed boats carry marijuana to Haiti, the Cayman 
Islands, and the Bahamas.  A thriving “guns for ganja (marijuana)” trade continues between 
Jamaica and Haiti, as evidenced by seizures in 2017 of illegal firearms traced to Haiti and 
marijuana shipments prepared for embarkation from coastal Jamaica.  In August, Jamaican 
police seized a shipment of over 1.68 MT of marijuana believed destined for Haiti and onward to 
the United States via small watercraft.  Police and customs officials also target marijuana 
shipments smuggled via commercial shipping directly to the United States. 
 
Jamaica prohibits the manufacture, sale, transport, and possession of MDMA (ecstasy) and 
methamphetamine and regulates the precursor chemicals used to produce them.  There were no 
reports of synthetic drugs or precursor chemicals produced or trafficked in Jamaica in 2017.  The 
National Council on Drug Abuse, the Pharmacy Council, and the Ministry of Health work to 
expand awareness among health professionals of the potential for diversion of ephedrine and 
pseudoephedrine to produce methamphetamine. 
 
U.S. law enforcement agencies work closely with Jamaican police and customs officials to 
develop leads, share information, and facilitate interdiction of drug shipments originating in or 
transiting through Jamaica.  The U.S. government has supported the Jamaican police Narcotics 
Division with equipment, including 17 donated vehicles and a training room, as well as training.   
 
 
3.  Drug Abuse Awareness, Demand Reduction, and Treatment 
 
The Ministry of Health’s National Council on Drug Abuse (NCDA), working through the 
primary care system and mental health clinics, provides assessment, counseling, and treatment 
services for substance abusers.  The Jamaican government operates one detoxification center 
located at the University Hospital of the West Indies (UHWI) in Kingston and also offers 
services at Kingston’s Bellevue Hospital (a mental health institution).  In collaboration with the 
Organization of American States’ Inter-American Drug Abuse Control Commission, Jamaica 
offers a university-level certificate program in drug addiction and drug prevention.  The UN 
Office on Drugs and Crime works directly with the Jamaican government and non-governmental 
organizations on demand reduction. 
 
 
4.  Corruption 
 
As a matter of policy, the Jamaican government does not encourage or facilitate illegal activity 
associated with drug trafficking or the laundering of proceeds from illicit drug transactions.  
Jamaican law penalizes corruption, but in practice, corruption remains entrenched and 


INCSR 2018 Volume 1

widespread, and the judicial system has a poor record of prosecuting corruption cases against law 
enforcement and government officials.  The last time a Member of Parliament or similarly high-
ranking official was tried or convicted on corruption charges was in 1990, when a former 
minister of labor was convicted for diverting money from a farm worker program for personal 
gain.  Corruption at Jamaica’s airports and seaports allegedly facilitates the movement of drug 
shipments across borders, and organized crime leaders have historically had ties to government 
officials, creating a permissive environment for drug trafficking.   
 
In 2017, the Jamaican government neared passage of a bill to make the existing Major Organized 
Crime and Anticorruption Agency (MOCA), which investigates organized crime and official 
corruption, fully independent of the police.  MOCA is currently a task force within the JCF; the 
new legislation would make it a free-standing entity with its own dedicated resources, potentially 
increasing its freedom to investigate corruption cases throughout the government. 
 
C.  National Goals, Bilateral Cooperation, and U.S. Policy Initiatives 
 
The U.S. and Jamaican governments coordinate closely on shared priorities related to drug 
control, including investigative capacity, customs cooperation, maritime security, and support to 
the judicial system.  In June 2017, the United States, United Kingdom, Canada, Colombia, 
European Union, and Jamaica collaborated to host a multilateral summit in Jamaica on 
combating transnational crime, which focused on promoting local and regional information and 
intelligence sharing.    
 
The United States supports a wide range of efforts designed to reduce illicit trafficking, advance 
public safety and citizen security, and promote justice through the Caribbean Basin Security 
Initiative (CBSI).  CBSI support to Jamaica includes training, equipment, and logistical 
assistance for interdiction of narcotics and firearms trafficking; combatting cyber-crime, money 
laundering, financial fraud, and other organized crime; improving Jamaica’s efforts to seize and 
forfeit criminally-acquired assets; and enhancing Jamaica’s maritime law enforcement 
capabilities.  The United States funds projects to improve the effectiveness of prosecutors and 
the courts, the National Forensic Sciences Laboratory, and the Financial Investigation Division.   
 
The Jamaican government historically lacked swift and reliable vessels to intercept drug 
traffickers at sea.  To remedy this, the U.S. government donated four interceptor boats to the 
Jamaican Coast Guard in 2017, bringing the total number of vessels donated to Jamaica by the 
United States between 2015 and 2017 to 18, and giving Jamaica one of the Caribbean’s largest 
maritime interdiction fleets.   
 
To increase public and government attention on the need for anti-corruption reforms, the United 
States provides support to Jamaica through the non-governmental organization National Integrity 
Action (NIA).  NIA provides training to government, civil society, and media partners to 
increase awareness and conducts campaigns to increase public demand for more effective action 
against corruption.   
 
The United States supports the establishment of a police polygraph unit to screen all incoming 
police recruits.  The United States provided polygraph certification courses for police officers 


INCSR 2018 Volume 1  
 
 
 
 
Country Reports

and equipped six polygraph exam suites, in cooperation with the Canadian government.  
Jamaican police polygraph examiners began administering tests directly in 2017 and disqualified 
85 recruits during the year.   
 
Jamaica participated in the annual Multilateral Maritime Interdiction and Prosecution Summit in 
July 2017, which attracted maritime counterdrug professionals from various central and eastern 
Caribbean nations.    
 
D.  Conclusion 
 
Cooperation between Jamaica and the United States related to drug trafficking and transnational 
crime strengthened in 2017, as evidenced by continued drug and arms seizures and an increase in 
high-level extraditions of wanted criminals to the United States from Jamaica.  Supported by 
U.S. assistance, Jamaican patrol vessels and aircraft are increasingly well-equipped to police 
Jamaica's waters, but to ensure that new equipment increases interdiction capacity, additional 
investment in training, maintenance, and information sharing will be necessary.   
 
Progress against drug trafficking will also significantly depend on efforts to combat corruption 
and strengthen the judicial system so traffickers and their political patrons are held criminally 
accountable.  New legislation to create an independent anti-corruption investigation agency and 
U.S.-supported programs to weed out corrupt police officials may represent a step forward in this 
regard.

Kazakhstan 
 
A.  Introduction 
 
Kazakhstan is a transit country for Afghan heroin and other opiates destined mainly for Russia 
and Europe.  In addition to growing imports of synthetic drugs, Kazakhstan faces cultivation and 
trafficking of cannabis within the country, mostly from the Chu valley of the Zhambyl region on 
the southern border with Kyrgyzstan.  Kazakhstani officials are also concerned about internet 
sales of illicit drugs. 
 
In keeping with trends seen elsewhere in Central Asia, the volume of heroin seized within 
Kazakhstan and along its borders declined in 2017.  The reported street-price of heroin in 
Kazakhstan has increased by approximately six-fold since 2008.   
 
B.  Drug Control Accomplishments, Policies, and Trends 
 
 
1.  Institutional Development 
 
The fight against drug addiction and drug trafficking is a priority for Kazakhstan.  Kazakhstan 
has historically used four-year programs to combat drug trafficking and addiction; the last such 
program finished in 2016.  In 2017, Kazakhstan’s anti-narcotics law enforcement activities were 
integrated into a National Security Strategy.  Drug Demand Reduction and Treatment projects 
are implemented in line with the National Program of Healthcare “Densaulyk” (Health) for 
2016-2019. 
 
Kazakhstan embraces regional cooperation to counter drug trafficking, including by hosting the 
Central Asia Regional Information and Coordination Center (CARICC) in Almaty, which is 
mandated to promote regional information sharing and cooperative operations to combat 
transnational drug trafficking.  It also cooperates with several countries on a bilateral basis and 
through multilateral fora such as the Shanghai Cooperation Organization (SCO), Collective 
Security Treaty Organization (CSTO), Commonwealth of Independent States (CIS), and the 
Eurasian Group on Combating Money Laundering and Terrorism Financing (EAG).  Kazakhstan 
provides training assistance to Afghanistan and other states in the region.  Several cadets from 
Afghanistan currently study at the Academies of the Ministry of Internal Affairs (MVD) and the 
Border Guard Service. 
 
In April, the Prosecutor General’s Office (PGO) signed a memorandum of understanding with 
the United Nations to establish a Regional Hub to serve as a training and research platform for 
Central Asian countries on threats including illicit drug trafficking.   
 
A mutual legal assistance treaty was ratified by the U.S. Senate on September 15, 2016 and went 
into force following the exchange of instruments of ratification on December 6, 2016.   
 
Kazakhstan withdrew customs control on the Kazakhstan-Kyrgyzstan border on August 12, 
2015, due to the Kyrgyz Republic’s accession to the Eurasian Economic Union (EAEU).  A new 
freight rail line that opened in 2016 from Gorgan, Iran through Turkmenistan to Beineu in

western Kazakhstan may provide new opportunities for trafficking in the future.  New methods 
of drug trafficking are also being utilized, including sales through bank payment systems, 
internet sales, and mail services. 
 
Kazakhstan faces an emerging threat from the production, trafficking and abuse of new 
psychoactive substances (NPS).  Draft amendments to improve current legislation pertaining to 
NPS and their precursors were in development in late 2017.  Kazakhstan previously introduced 
criminal liability for trafficking of narcotic analogues in a new Criminal Code which entered into 
force in 2015.   
 
 
2.  Supply Reduction 
 
During the first nine months of 2017, law enforcement agencies seized 38.5 metric tons (MT) of 
illegal drugs, an increase from the 36.7 MT seized in the same period in 2016, although seizures 
of opiates decreased.  This included 126.6 kilograms (kg) of heroin (down from 196.6 kg in 
2016), 439.6 kg of hashish (an increase from 431.7 kg in 2016), and 32.2 MT marijuana (32.3 
MT in 2016).   
 
Law enforcement and special services registered 3,101 drug-related crimes in 2017 (a decrease 
from the 3,657 in 2016), including 242 cases of drug smuggling (down from 260 in 2016), 1,885 
cases related to drug sales (2,213 in 2016), and 23 drug-related crimes committed by organized 
criminal groups (50 in 2016).  The Ministry of Internal Affairs (MVD) claimed to have disrupted 
10 drug trafficking organizations in 2017 (down from 11 in 2016), and initiated 33 criminal cases 
against members of those drug trafficking organizations (a significant drop-off from the 51 in 
2016).  The MVD conducted 26 internal controlled delivery operations in 2017 (30 of 2016).   
 
 
3.  Public Information, Prevention, and Treatment 
 
The MVD Counternarcotics Department cooperates with 73 NGOs on drug demand reduction 
and the medical and social rehabilitation of persons suffering from substance abuse 
disorders.  New narcology standards, treatment methods, prison addict rehabilitation, and harm 
reduction programs are in development but remain antiquated. 
 
The MVD worked with NGO and youth organizations to organize 18,000 demand reduction 
events (compared to 10,391 in 2016), reaching over 400,000 people (510,000 in 2016).   
 
The government reported 25,000 registered persons with substance abuse disorders in 2017, 
down from 27,269 in 2016.  The number of heroin users appears to be decreasing in Kazakhstan, 
though contacts report an increase in the number of people addicted to new psychoactive 
substances.  However, official statistics on registered drug users likely drastically undercounts 
the total number of actual users, as there a negative social and economic repercussions for 
anyone that registers with the government as an illicit drug user. 
 
 
4.  Corruption 
 


INCSR 2018 Volume 1  
 
 
 
 
Country Reports

The Government of Kazakhstan does not, as a matter of government policy, encourage or 
facilitate illicit drug production or distribution, nor is it involved in laundering the proceeds of 
the sale of illicit drugs.  However, there are instances of corruption among law enforcement 
agencies, particularly among front line border guards, whose low salaries incentivize bribe 
requests.  The government rewards citizens for reporting police corruption. 
 
C.  National Goals, Bilateral Cooperation, and U.S. Policy Initiatives 
 
Kazakhstan is committed to continuing drug demand and supply reduction efforts and 
strengthening international cooperation.  To reduce the illicit inflow of drugs, Kazakhstan plans 
to revise its border procedures for foreign nationals, especially from countries identified as illicit 
drug trafficking threats.  The government is also developing measures to identify and combat 
sea-based supply channels. 
 
The United States continues to support counternarcotics capacity building with relevant 
authorities.  The U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration signed a memorandum of understanding 
with the MVD in November 2016 to support bilateral drug control efforts and information 
sharing, allowing a closer relationship, information sharing, and joint operations.  The United 
States supports efforts to strengthen Kazakhstan’s border security, including efforts to expand 
Kazakhstan’s Coast Guard capacity on the Caspian Sea.  In 2017, the United States organized 
thirty programs for Kazakhstani drug enforcement officers.  All U.S. government programs aim 
to improve Kazakhstan’s capacity to combat drug-trafficking and drug demand, and enjoy full 
host government support and shared funding.   
 
D.  Conclusion 
 
Kazakhstan remains concerned about regional drug trafficking trends linked to illicit drug 
production in Afghanistan.  To confront an increasing synthetic drug threat, Kazakhstan is taking 
steps to assess the situation, identify fentanyl-related products, counter new methods of shipping 
and trafficking, and conduct demand reduction campaigns, including measures to more 
effectively identify drug users.  The government is seeking to expand its drug control 
cooperation with international partners, especially the United States, and is also taking steps to 
combat existing and emerging public health and national security threats posed by drug 
trafficking and addiction.

Kyrgyz Republic 
 
A.  Introduction 
 
The Kyrgyz Republic lies along a significant transit route for illicit drugs moving north from 
Afghanistan to Russia and other international markets.  Opiates originating from Afghanistan, as 
well as other illicit drugs, are smuggled into the country from Tajikistan across the porous 
border.  The Kyrgyz Republic’s geographic location, limited resources, and weak criminal 
justice system make it a prime transshipment location.  The country’s membership in the 
Eurasian Economic Union, and ongoing interstate highway construction, may increase the 
Kyrgyz Republic’s vulnerability as a transit route for Russia-bound drug trafficking.  The reform 
of the state’s law enforcement system that started in 2016 remains ongoing.  The State Service 
on Drug Control of the Kyrgyz Republic (SSDC) and the Main Directorate on Combating Illicit 
Drug Trafficking under the Kyrgyz Ministry of Interior were merged into the new Counter 
Narcotics Service (CNS) under the jurisdiction of the Kyrgyz Ministry of Interior (MOI).  As a 
result of the merger, the CNS is now responsible for coordinating national efforts to combat 
illicit trafficking of drugs and precursor chemicals, while the Ministry of Health remains 
responsible for monitoring the legal trade in controlled drugs. 
 
B.  Drug Control Accomplishments, Policies, and Trends 
 
 
1.  Institutional Development 
 
The SSDC was officially dissolved on November 30, 2016, and the new CNS was launched on 
January 1, 2017, with the appointment of Azamat Araev as Chief of the new institution.  Only 
approximately 15 percent of the SSDC’s 300-person staff joined CNS, as the majority transferred 
to MOI or other law enforcement institutions, and others retired or were dismissed.  CNS staffing 
numbered approximately 190 at the end of 2017.  Approximately 30 percent of the equipment 
accumulated by the SSDC was transferred to MOI units and other law enforcement agencies.    
 
The Kyrgyz Republic is a member of the Central Asia Regional Information and Coordination 
Center (CARICC), which promotes regional information sharing and coordinated operations to 
combat transnational drug trafficking.  In October 2017,  Grigorii Pustovitov, the former 
representative of the Russian MOI to the Kyrgyz Republic, was appointed as the new director of 
CARICC.  The Kyrgyz Republic does not have an extradition agreement with the United States.  
Although the Kyrgyz Republic does not have a mutual legal assistance agreement with the 
United States, it is a signatory to multilateral legal instruments that could be used to facilitate 
such cooperation. 
 
 
2.  Supply Reduction 
 
During the first eight months of 2017, there was an overall decrease in drug seizures and 
criminal cases involving drugs compared to the same period in 2016.  The country’s law 
enforcement agencies registered 1,157 drug-related criminal cases – versus 1,840 cases in 2016 – 
and of these cases, 967 were investigated and 870 were sent to court.  The total amount of illegal 
drug seized by all law enforcement agencies was approximately 12 metric tons (MT), including 


INCSR 2018 Volume 1  
 
 
 
 
Country Reports 
207 
 
psychotropic substances and precursor chemicals.  These seizure totals were down from the same 
period in 2016 (18.16 MT) and significantly below totals from 2015 (over 28 MT for the year).  
According to the MOI, the categories of seized drugs included: 62.7 kilograms (kg) of heroin; 21 
kg of opium; approximately 10.7 MT of cannabis products; and approximately 1.17 MT of 
precursor chemicals. 
 
 
3.  Public Information, Prevention, and Treatment 
 
The Kyrgyz Republic works to reduce demand for illegal drugs and improve treatment through 
cooperation with international partners, including the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime 
(UNODC) and the U.S.-sponsored Community Anti-Drug Coalition.  Programs focus on 
improving the capacity of treatment professionals, as well as educating youth and communities 
on the dangers of illegal drugs.  The United States supports UNODC efforts to reverse or 
neutralizing policies that criminalize behavior of key populations and limit access to treatment 
services.  The activities include organizing high-level advocacy meetings, supporting technical 
experts groups, reviewing policy and legal documents, and building the capacity of health care 
workers, law enforcement agencies and civil society organizations.   
 
According to the country’s national HIV monitoring center, HIV continues to rise among 
injecting drug users.  HIV among people who inject drugs has risen from 12.4 percent in 2013 to 
14.3 percent in 2016.  There are an estimated 18,000 to 20,000 injecting drug users in the 
country, according to a joint study conducted by Kyrgyz authorities and the United Nations in 
2016.    
 
 
4.  Corruption 
 
The Government of Kyrgyz Republic does not, as a matter of government policy, encourage or 
facilitate illicit drug production or distribution, nor is it involved in laundering the proceeds of 
the sale of illicit drugs.  However, corruption continues to exist within the country’s law 
enforcement agencies.  While Kyrgyz law provides criminal penalties for public officials 
convicted of corruption, the government does not implement the law effectively.  Bribery to 
avoid investigation or prosecution is problematic at all levels.  Likewise, law enforcement 
officers, particularly in the southern part of the country, use arbitrary arrest, detainee abuse, and 
the threat of criminal prosecution to extort citizens. 
 
The only government body empowered to investigate corruption is the anticorruption branch of 
the State Committee for National Security (GKNB).  It is not an independent government entity.  
The agency’s cooperation with civil society is limited, and its investigations lead to very few 
prosecutions. 
 
C.  National Goals, Bilateral Cooperation, and U.S. Policy Initiatives 
 
U.S. policy objectives focus on strengthening the existing capacity of the country’s law 
enforcement bodies, expanding their ability to investigate and prosecute criminal cases, 
enhancing anti-corruption efforts, and increasing overall security in the country.    
 


INCSR 2018 Volume 1  
 
 
 
 
Country Reports 
208 
 
In 2017, officers from the MOI and Customs service attended a series of training courses in the 
Kyrgyz Republic by the U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA).  The DEA training 
covered basic and advanced drug investigation techniques, airport interdictions, and drug unit 
management.  Outside of the training program there has been little engagement from the MOI 
and Customs on drug control efforts.  For nearly a year a memorandum between the MOI and 
DEA, which is needed to replace the memorandum between the DEA and SSDC, has yet to be 
approved by the MOI. 
 
D.  Conclusion 
 
The Kyrgyz Republic’s need for international drug control cooperation is likely to continue 
given the lack of resources within Kyrgyz law enforcement institutions.  The United States 
remains committed to assisting the Kyrgyz government’s efforts to reform and strengthen its law 
enforcement institutions.

Laos 
  
A.  Introduction  
  
Laos is a significant transshipment hub for amphetamine-type stimulants (ATS), and is a major 
source country of opium.  Located in the heart of the regional drug trade in Southeast Asia, Laos 
shares 3,000 miles of porous land borders with Myanmar, Thailand, China, Cambodia, and 
Vietnam.  Although infrastructure remains rudimentary in Laos, improving road, bridge, and 
communication networks have increased opportunities for drug trafficking throughout the 
country. 
 
Poppy cultivation in Laos decreased 96 percent between 1998 and 2007 due to aggressive 
government action and international cooperation, particularly U.S. alternative development 
assistance.  Although significant amounts of opium poppy are still grown in Laos, often in 
remote and difficult to access areas, overall cultivation appears to have been relatively stable 
over the last decade, if not declining marginally.  According to the most recent UN Office on 
Drugs and Crime (UNODC) opium survey, an estimated 6,200 hectares (ha) of opium poppy 
were cultivated within Laos in 2014 and 5,700 ha in 2015.  A survey completed by Lao and 
Chinese technical staff estimated that 5,328 ha of opium poppy were cultivated within the 
country in 2017. 
 
Most of the opium produced in Laos is destined for export and refinement into heroin, with only 
a small percentage consumed in Laos.  Laos is not a significant source of opiates trafficked to the 
United States. 
 
Laos has a significant domestic market for illicit drugs, especially ATS.  While ATS production 
within Laos appears to be minor, drug seizure data suggests that ATS may be transiting through 
Laos from neighboring countries in increasing quantities.  
 
B.  Drug Control Accomplishments, Policies, and Trends 
  
 
1.  Institutional Development 
  
Since 1989, the United States has provided Laos approximately $45 million in law enforcement 
and counter-drug assistance, which helped to eliminate much of Laos’ opium poppy cultivation.  
The Lao Bureau for Drug Control and Supervision (LBDC) and the Counternarcotics Police 
Department (DCD), both under the Ministry of Public Security, are the main coordinating bodies 
for the implementation of drug demand reduction, crop control, alternative development, and law 
enforcement activities.  The top policy-making body for drug control is the National Steering 
Committee to Combat Drugs (NSCCD), chaired by the Prime Minister.  Lao drug police are 
organized into 18 provincial counter-drug police divisions known as Counter Narcotics Units 
(CNUs), one for each province and the Vientiane Capital.   
 
Laos does not have a bilateral extradition or a mutual legal assistance treaty with the United 
States, though Laos has acceded to multilateral conventions that enable mutual legal assistance 


INCSR 2018 Volume 1  
 
 
 
 
Country Reports

cooperation.  While Lao authorities are receptive to training opportunities, bilateral cooperation 
with the United States on international drug trafficking investigations has been rare to date. 
 
 
2.  Supply Reduction 
  
Lao drug control authorities have recently been increasing their cooperation on border control 
and interdiction with counterparts in neighboring countries. 
 
In January 2017, Laos joined other Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) Member 
States in adopting the ASEAN Cooperation Plan to Tackle Illicit Drug Production and 
Trafficking in the Golden Triangle (2017-2019).  The Plan is a concerted effort to solve drug 
problems in Southeast Asia, and builds on both the Safe Mekong Joint Operation Project, which 
began in 2013, and the ASEAN Work Plan on Securing Communities Against Illicit Drugs 
(2016-2025). 
 
As a result of this increased collaboration, three major Lao drug lords were arrested in 2017.  A 
five-year hunt for suspected drug lord, Xaysana Keophimpha, ended in his arrest at 
Suvarnabhumi airport in Bangkok in January.   Khonpasong Soukkaseum, known as Xiengther, 
and three of his associates were arrested near the Lao capital of Vientiane in February.  In April, 
Sisouk Daoheuang was arrested in the northern Lao city of Luang Prabang. 
 
During the first six months of 2017, the DCD reportedly seized 68.35 kilograms (kg) of heroin; 
84.2 kg of opium; 2.97 metric tons of cannabis; 93 kg of crystal methamphetamine; 1.9 million 
ATS tablets; and 55.9 kg of precursor chemicals.  The DCD investigated 1,403 drug cases and 
arrested 2,141 people for suspected drug crimes, including 40 foreigners.  Statistics for the 
second half of the year have not yet been released. 
 
The Lao government continues to support longstanding efforts to assist former poppy-growing 
farmers by fostering alternative livelihoods, mostly financed by donors.  In 2016, the U.S. 
government launched a three-year, $1.5 million alternative development program with the 
UNODC in Houaphan province.  The project includes the development of coffee plantations, 
improved technology for livestock production, opium detoxification, and building the 
management skills and capacities of local organizations.   
  
 
3.  Public Information, Prevention, and Treatment 
  
The Lao government raises awareness of the risks and negative consequences of illicit drugs 
through mass media such as television, radio, newspaper, and other channels. 
 
ATS use is thought to be concentrated among Laos’ youth population, mostly consumed as 
“yaba,” a mixture of methamphetamine and caffeine also popular in Thailand.  The Lao 
government estimates 40,000 users of the drug within the country, although this figure is likely 
an underestimate.   
 
Government drug treatment facilities lack the resources to provide evidence-based treatment and 
post-discharge follow-up.  To support demand reduction efforts, the United States supports

adoption of community-based, voluntary treatment.  The United States has provided 
approximately $600,000 to the UNODC and the World Health Organization to establish and 
operate 28 community-based treatment centers providing screening and counseling services at 
district hospitals across six provinces.  The United States is also funding the translation and 
training for Lao National Trainers on the U.S.-developed Universal Prevention Curriculum. 
 
 
4.  Corruption  
 
The Government of Laos does not, as a matter of government policy, encourage or facilitate 
illicit drug production or distribution, nor is it involved in laundering the proceeds of the sale of 
illicit drugs.  However, salaries for police, military, and civil servants are low, and corruption in 
Laos is endemic. 
 
C.  National Goals, Bilateral Cooperation, and U.S. Policy Initiatives 
  
The Lao government’s guiding drug control strategy document, the “National Drug Control 
Master Plan 2016-2020,” was approved in May 2016.  The Master Plan, which was developed 
with support from the United States and the UNODC, articulates nine priorities for the Lao 
government, including: 
 
• 
Formulation and improvement of legal instruments concerning drug 
problems; 
• 
Data/information collection and analysis; 
• 
Education/training/dissemination of the laws and adverse consequences 
from drug abuse; 
• 
Treatment and vocational training for persons suffering from substance use disorders; 
• 
Alternative development, replacing opium poppy and cannabis cultivation; 
• 
Law enforcement; 
• 
Precursor chemical control, analysis, and testing of drug use; 
• 
International cooperation; and 
• 
Streamlining the organizational machinery of the national commission for 
drug control and supervision at the central and local levels. 
 
The Master Plan implements the country’s National Drug Law (promulgated in 2015), and calls 
for a budget of $18 million over five years from 2016-2020.  Funds for implementing the plan 
are expected to come from the Lao government and international donors.   
 
The United States supports the Lao government’s efforts to strengthen the rule of law and 
capacities for combating transnational crime.  Most U.S. drug control assistance to Laos supports 
law enforcement efforts, including training for the DCD, CNUs, and Customs Department. 
  
D.  Conclusion 
  
Drug control cooperation between Laos and the United States continues to evolve and prioritizes 
border security and anti-corruption.  Transnational drug trafficking networks in Southeast Asia 
must be countered by strong regional law enforcement capacity and cross-border cooperation.

Laos’ justice, law enforcement, and security systems lack the resources necessary to counter the 
increased sophistication of drug-related crime that has accompanied the country’s growing 
economic development.  Continued support for institution-building within the Lao government, 
as well as basic law enforcement training emphasizing interdiction, investigation, and 
prosecution is needed.

Lebanon 
 
Lebanon serves as a transit point for cocaine and heroin and serves as a production hub for 
fenethylline, an amphetamine-type stimulant commonly known by the former brand name 
“captagon.”  Cannabis and hashish are also cultivated within Lebanon, mostly produced in the 
Bekaa region.  The primary illicit drugs consumed in Lebanon are hashish, cocaine, 
fenethylline, and MDMA (ecstasy).  
 
The main drug control goals of the Lebanese government remain eradication of illegally-
cultivated cannabis, and stemming the production and trafficking of fenethylline in the Bekaa 
region.  Fenethylline continues to be smuggled through Lebanon to Gulf region states.  Little 
significant eradication activity occurred in 2017, due in large part to instability along the border 
with Syria, combined with a lack of logistical support and equipment for the Internal Security 
Forces’ (ISF’s) eradication efforts.  
 
The Lebanese Armed Forces (LAF) units routinely conduct drug seizures in the course of 
border security and counterterrorism operations.  Law enforcement cooperation and 
coordination mechanisms for information sharing and the disposition of seized materials 
continue to develop between the LAF and partner Lebanese security agencies. 
 
The volume of cocaine entering Lebanon via commercial aircraft in 2017 was estimated to be 
consistent with 2016 levels.  Individual smugglers typically depart from South America and 
transit through other countries en route to Lebanon, usually carrying between three and five 
kilograms of cocaine in their luggage.   
 
The ISF has made strides in combating fenethylline trafficking over the past several years, 
though seizure totals declined in 2017 from 2016.  The ISF seized a total of 7.5 million 
fenethylline tablets during the first nine months of 2017, compared to 10.8 million tablets seized 
over period in 2016.  The ISF also seized production labs and arrested numerous fenethylline 
smugglers.  Lebanese government reports indicate that a total of 2,538 drug seizure events 
occurred during the first nine months of 2017.  During this period, heroin seizures totaled 
approximately two kilograms (kg), down from three kg from the same period in 2016.  Cocaine 
seizures amounted to 113 kg during the same nine-month period, compared to 164 kg seized in 
2016.  Approximately 6.2 metric tons (MT) of hashish were seized, compared to 6.3 MT seized 
in 2016.   
 
The United States does not have a mutual legal assistance treaty or extradition agreement with 
Lebanon, although Lebanon has acceded to multilateral conventions that enable law 
enforcement cooperation.  In 2013, the United States discontinued all material assistance to 
Lebanon’s Internal Security Force’s counter-narcotics unit, based on reports of human rights 
violations.  There has been no U.S. material assistance to this unit within the last four fiscal 
years.  However, U.S. law enforcement entities continue to exchange information with 
Lebanese counterparts on narcotics matters.

Liberia 
 
A.  Introduction 
 
While Liberia is not a significant international transit route for illicit drugs, the country’s 
nascent law enforcement capacity, porous border controls, and proximity to major drug transit 
routes contribute to increasing drug traffic to and through Liberia.  Liberia is also not a 
significant producer of illicit drugs, though domestic drug use, particularly of marijuana, is very 
common.  Other drug usage includes heroin (mostly smoked) and cocaine (snorted).  Local 
authorities have reported increasing prevalence of amphetamine-type stimulants and intravenous 
drugs.  There is no reliable data on drug consumption or overall trends within Liberia due to 
poor transportation and communications infrastructure coupled with a lack of interest to collect 
such data.  Other than marijuana, drugs consumed within Liberia enter the country via 
commercial aircraft, maritime vessels, and across land borders by foot and vehicle traffic. 
 
B.  Drug Control Accomplishments, Policies, and Trends 
 
 
 
1.  Institutional Development  
 
Local law enforcement agencies, including the Liberia National Police (LNP), Coast Guard, 
National Security Agency, and the Liberia Drug Enforcement Agency (LDEA), work in concert 
to fight illicit drug trafficking in Liberia.  Established Nigerian criminal networks operate within 
Liberia, some of which are involved in drug trafficking, and local authorities are aware of the 
threat and are working with the United States to prevent these illicit criminal networks from 
gaining a stronger foothold.   
  
In 2017 the LDEA made a number of interdictions and arrests of drug traffickers based upon 
intelligence and international liaison.  Prior to 2014, the LDEA did not have the capacity to 
perform the basic investigations and surveillance necessary to obtain warrants, maintain chain 
of custody, and present a proper case in court.  Drug enforcement operations have since 
progressed to multi-kilogram seizures and arrests of international drug traffickers.   
  
Improvements to Liberia’s enforcement capacity began in 2014 when the LDEA was 
reorganized and the country’s Controlled Drugs and Substances Act came into effect.  In 2017, 
88 suspected drug traffickers were arrested in 11 separate indictments that led to prison 
sentences totaling 76 years.  An LDEA court liaison team works directly with judges to promote 
effective implementation of the law.  Many of the successful interdictions and seizures during 
2017 resulted from LDEA’s international ties, which led to greater intelligence capabilities and 
intelligence sharing, and resulted in several successful and significant operations. 
  
The LDEA continues to improve its operational capacity and professionalism, including through 
effectively working across the Liberian interagency and outreach to private businesses.  The 
LDEA is increasingly successful using advanced investigative measures including confidential 
sources, controlled deliveries, and international investigations targeting organized criminal 
groups.  The U.S.-Liberia extradition treaty dates from 1939 and is still in effect.  Although a 


INCSR 2018 Volume 1  
 
 
 
 
Country Reports 
215 
 
mutual legal assistance treaty between Liberia and the United States does not exist, Liberia is a 
party to multilateral conventions that enable such cooperation. 
 
 
2.  Supply Reduction   
 
Local marijuana production takes place within Liberia, there is little information available on 
the extent of cannabis cultivation or the trafficking networks involved in distributing it.   
  
During the first 10 months of 2017, the LDEA seized approximately 8.7 metric tons (MT) of 
marijuana; 2.6 kilograms (kg) of cocaine; 11.5 kg of heroin; and 2 kg of methamphetamine.  
The seizure of methamphetamine was the first within Liberia.  Also in 2017, the LDEA made 
significant progress in its fight to counter international drug trafficking through air couriers and 
successfully interdicted five foreign nationals and seized 9 kg of heroin and cocaine at Roberts 
International Airport.  Also, three foreign nationals were arrested and 4 kg of heroin were seized 
during two significant cross-border cases.  
 
 
3.  Public Information, Prevention, and Treatment   
 
The UN Office on Drugs and Crime’s (UNODC) 2012 Preliminary Drug Use Assessment 
Report indicated increased drug use among youths, particularly ex-combatants from Liberia’s 
1989-2003 civil conflict.  Drug use is growing among the emerging middle class and exists in 
expat communities. 
  
The government has conducted very little drug prevention, rehabilitation, or treatment since the 
pre-war era, due to a lack of resources and capacity.  Persons with substance use disorders are 
referred to the only psychiatric hospital in Liberia or to one of the few non-governmental 
organizations (NGOs) working in the field.  One highlight from 2017 was the LDEA- hosted 
2017 International Day Against Illicit Drugs-World Drug Day event that was logistically 
supported by the United States.  The annual event has steadily grown since first being held in 
2003, and promotes drug demand reduction, notes various enforcement efforts, and highlights 
the collaboration between each.  The LDEA also held events to commemorate World Drug Day 
on June 26, stressing the importance of community involvement in the fight against drug abuse.  
As in past years, the event culminated in the public destruction (burning) of confiscated drugs, 
which generated positive media attention and underscored the improved transparency of the 
LDEA.  This year the LDEA destroyed approximately 9.37 MT of marijuana, 7.94 kg of 
cocaine, and 19.32 kg of heroin.  
 
 
4.  Corruption  
 
The Government of Liberia does not encourage or facilitate the production or distribution of 
illicit drugs, nor the laundering of proceeds from illegal drug transactions as a matter of policy.   
  
C.  National Goals, Bilateral Cooperation, and U.S. Policy Initiatives 
 
The United States is working with the Government of Liberia to fight international drug 
trafficking and reduce local demand for illicit drugs.  As part of these efforts, the United States 


INCSR 2018 Volume 1  
 
 
 
 
Country Reports

is providing assistance to build the Government of Liberia’s capacity to develop criminal cases 
against international trafficking organizations active in the country and encouraging judicial and 
prosecutorial application of the country’s relevant drug control laws.  Many of the seizures and 
successful cases recorded in 2017 are a direct result of U.S.-provided training and international 
cooperation in countering international drug trafficking.  
 
D.  Conclusion 
 
The Government of Liberia is committed to preventing transnational criminal organizations 
from gaining a major foothold in its territory, but lacks the resources and capacity to respond 
adequately to this challenge.  Despite significant constraints, the LDEA is also working with 
other regional drug enforcement entities to exchange intelligence and information, which has 
led to the interdiction of international traffickers within Liberia's borders in 2017.  After four 
years of effort to overcome institutional and political resistance, the LDEA has deployed to all 
Liberian Ports of Entry, and given the advancements in LDEA capacity, judicial acceptance, 
and successful prosecutions, it is anticipated that there will be meaningful results in 2018.  The 
United States will continue to support and assist Liberia’s efforts to strengthen its law 
enforcement capacities and fulfill its international drug control commitments.

Malaysia 
 
A.  Introduction 
 
Malaysia is not a significant source country or transit point for U.S.-bound illicit drugs.  
Nevertheless, drug trafficking networks exploit Malaysia as a transit state to supply regional 
markets, and transnational criminal organizations are attempting to expand crystal 
methamphetamine production within the country.  Drugs smuggled into Malaysia from China, 
Thailand, Burma, and Laos include marijuana, heroin, and amphetamine-type stimulants.  
Synthetic drugs originating from China, Iran, Nigeria and India are also trafficked through 
Malaysia including MDMA (ecstasy), nimetazepam (a diverted pharmaceutical drug), and crystal 
methamphetamine.  Nigerian and Iranian traffickers use Kuala Lumpur as a hub, and have used 
commercial courier services to ship drugs into and from Malaysia.  There is no notable 
cultivation of illicit drug crops in Malaysia and local consumption of illicit drugs is limited.  
 
B.  Drug Control Accomplishments, Policies, and Trends 
 
 
1.  Institutional Development 
 
Although the Royal Malaysian Police are generally effective in arresting drug offenders, 
Malaysian prosecutors have shown limited success in prosecuting and convicting drug traffickers 
as Malaysia does not have an effective drug conspiracy law.  Coupled with the high burden of 
proof required for a drug trafficking conviction, which in many cases leads to a mandatory death 
sentence, prosecutors are limited in their ability to charge and prosecute such cases.  
Consequently, drug offenders are often held under Malaysia’s preventive detention laws, which 
allows for detention without trial for up to two years. 
 
Since early 2017, Malaysia has been considering an amendment to the country’s drug laws 
which would allow judges to impose jail terms instead of the mandatory death sentence for drug 
traffickers.  Alternative sentences could encourage drug charges against traffickers by those 
prosecutors who might have deemed the death penalty excessive. 
 
Malaysia has an extradition treaty and mutual legal assistance treaty with the United States and 
bilateral cooperation under these agreements is generally productive.  Malaysia remains an active 
participant in multilateral drug control venues, including to implement commitments under the 
Association of South East Asian Nations (ASEAN) and the UN drug control treaties.   
 
 
2.  Supply Reduction 
 
According to Malaysian authorities, drug trafficking patterns through Malaysia in 2017 remained 
relatively consistent with previous years.  Most drugs entering Malaysia come across the border 
with Thailand, through all available means of conveyance (air, ground, maritime, and human 
couriers).  Drug trafficking organizations have begun using more local nationals as couriers, 
particularly women, to avoid law enforcement profiling.   
 


INCSR 2018 Volume 1  
 
 
 
 
Country Reports 
218 
 
U.S. assistance and information sharing has played a valuable role in assisting Malaysia to 
combat drug trafficking in the country.  As an example, in 2017, Malaysian police uncovered 
illicit ketamine labs in central Malaysia based on information sharing with U.S. law enforcement.  
The United States helped to facilitate communication between Malaysia and other Southeast 
Asian countries that identified the source of the precursors used in these labs and the foreign 
chemists hired to produce the ketamine.  The clandestine laboratory was capable of producing 
several hundred kilograms (kg) of ketamine for export and limited local consumption. 
 
Malaysian authorities seized approximately $30 million worth of illicit drugs during the first six 
months of 2017, according to the latest Malaysian government statistics available, putting 
authorities on course to exceed the $47 million seized in 2016.  Synthetic drugs comprised the 
majority of seizures and may indicate increased trafficking through the country.  Arrests for 
supplying and possessing drugs increased 23 percent and 22 percent, respectively, compared to 
the first half of 2016, while arrests for drug use, based on urinalysis, fell by 28 percent.   
 
 
3.  Public Information, Prevention, and Treatment 
 
Illicit drug consumption remains relatively low in Malaysia, and overdoses are rare.  Malaysia 
promotes drug abuse awareness and prevention via the National Anti-Drug Agency.  Drug 
treatment and rehabilitation clinics exist, but are under-funded and lack of the ability to provide 
comprehensive follow-up care to patients once they leave the clinic.  
 
 
4.  Corruption 
 
Corruption is an endemic issue in Malaysia and touches nearly every government agency.  
However, there are no indications that drug-related corruption is systematic or widespread.  As a 
matter of government policy, Malaysia does not encourage or facilitate illegal activity associated 
with drug trafficking and there are no known senior government officials engaged in such 
activity.  
 
C.  National Goals, Bilateral Cooperation, and U.S. Policy Initiatives 
 
U.S. training continued to play an important role in assisting Malaysian authorities against 
international drug trafficking networks.  The United States continues to send Malaysian police 
for counter-narcotics training at the International Law Enforcement Academy (ILEA) in 
Bangkok.  The U.S. Coast Guard continued its maritime law enforcement training program with 
the Malaysian Maritime Enforcement Agency.  The United States also conducted a one-week 
course on criminal conspiracy and complex investigations in Malaysia in April.  Course 
attendees included officers from the Royal Malaysian Police, who received instruction on how to 
build complex conspiracy investigations, exploit intelligence effectively, and build cases from 
the ground up to ultimately dismantle drug organizations as a whole.  This training proved 
effective in September, when trained authorities seized 300 kg of crystal methamphetamine, 
valued at $5.5 million, and arrested six individuals in three different states.

Senior Malaysian drug control officials also traveled to the United States in 2017 to meet with 
their counterparts at the U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration to expand U.S.-Malaysia 
cooperation.   
 
D.  Conclusion 
 
With U.S. support, Malaysia is engaged in a long-term process to further professionalize 
substance use treatment staff in the country through the Colombo Plan’s International Center for 
Certification and Education of Addiction Professionals.  In 2018, the United States will seek to 
promote further coordination between Malaysian and U.S. law enforcement authorities, 
including joint interdiction efforts, information sharing, and training to further improve 
Malaysia's investigative and prosecutorial capacity.

Mexico 
 
A. Introduction 
 
Mexico is a significant source and transit country for heroin, marijuana, and synthetic drugs 
including methamphetamine destined for the United States and the main transit country for 
cocaine from South America.  Mexico is a source of illicit opium poppy and the primary supplier 
of heroin to the U.S. domestic market.  Narcotics trafficking, corruption, and related violence in 
Mexico pose considerable problems to citizen security and economic development.  According 
to the Government of Mexico, murders increased 26 percent nationally during the first nine 
months of 2017 compared to the same period in 2016.  
 
The Merida Initiative is the U.S. government’s primary mechanism to implement security 
assistance in Mexico.  Merida projects have expanded to disrupt the business model of 
transnational criminal organizations and stem the flow of drugs into the United States.  Projects 
include training and equipment to dismantle clandestine drug labs; a precursor chemical tracking 
program; advanced airport security training; inspection equipment for border crossings and 
checkpoints; and a national information sharing system and telecommunications network along 
Mexico’s southern border to improve law enforcement operations.  Since 2009 the United States 
has provided security assistance program funding specifically for drug interdiction equipment 
and training to law enforcement and military personnel engaged in drug control efforts.  
 
B. Drug Control Accomplishments, Policies, and Trends 
 
1. Institutional Development 
 
Despite continued fiscal austerity, Mexico’s approved 2018 budget allocates an additional $470 
million (for a total of nearly $8 billion) to crime prevention and drug demand reduction and 
treatment programs.  The Interior Secretariat will receive a 5.4 percent (real) budget increase, 
with the bulk of the increase dedicated to strengthening Federal Police operations at the state 
level.  Mexico’s Army (SEDENA) and Navy (SEMAR) will see 13.4 percent and 11.4 percent 
real budget increases, respectively, with most of those new assets dedicated to strengthening 
military and naval infrastructure, much of which will be dedicated to combating transnational 
criminal organizations.   
 
Mexico participates in the Inter-American Convention on Mutual Assistance in Criminal Matters 
and subscribes to the 1996 Anti-Drug Strategy in the Hemisphere and the 1990 Declaration and 
Program of Action of Ixtapa.  Mexico is a regional observer in the Central American Integration 
System and collaborates with Central American countries to improve regional security.  Mexico 
participates with Canada and the United States in the North American Maritime Security 
Initiative in which naval authorities meet regularly to share information, improve response to 
transnational threats, and develop protocols for maritime interdictions.   
 
The current U.S.–Mexico extradition treaty has been in force since 1980 and Mexico remains 
one of the United States’ strongest extradition partners.  Moreover, a bilateral mutual legal 
assistance treaty in force since 1991 fosters a broad range of cooperation in criminal matters.   


INCSR 2018 Volume 1

2. Supply Reduction 
 
The U.S. government estimates opium poppy cultivation in Mexico reached 32,000 hectares (ha) 
in 2016, an increase from 28,000 ha in 2015.  Most opium poppy cultivation occurred in the 
states of Sinaloa, Chihuahua, Durango, and Guerrero.  The Mexican Attorney General’s Office 
(PGR), SEDENA, SEMAR, Foreign Ministry (SRE), and the United Nations Office on Drugs 
and Crime (UNODC) began an opium yield study in 2017 to better estimate the quantity of 
heroin produced in Mexico.  Collection of field samples will continue through the opium poppy 
growing season of early 2018, with analysis planned for spring 2018. 
 
The Mexican military conducts the majority of eradication efforts.  PGR’s National Center for 
Planning, Analysis, and Information to Combat Organized Crime (PGR/CENAPI) publishes drug 
seizure and eradication statistics.  According to PGR/CENAPI, in calendar year 2016 Mexico 
reportedly eradicated 5,478.42 ha of marijuana and 22,436.59 ha of opium poppy.  During the 
first six months of 2017, Mexico reportedly eradicated 1,979.21 ha of marijuana and 20,248.95 
ha of opium poppy.     
 
According to PGR/CENAPI, in calendar year 2016 Mexico seized approximately 13.04 metric 
tons (MT) of cocaine; 841 MT of marijuana; 38,432 cannabis fields; 234.73 kilograms (kg) of 
opium gum; 164,010 opium poppy fields; 26.19 MT of methamphetamine; and 136 clandestine 
laboratories.  During the first six months of 2017, Mexico reportedly seized 7.61 MT of cocaine; 
265.15 MT of marijuana; 14,670 cannabis fields; 251.03 kg of opium gum; 135,244 poppy 
fields; 4.29 MT of methamphetamine; and 70 clandestine laboratories.  PGR/CENAPI has not 
yet provided heroin seizure information for 2016 and 2017. 
 
Increased seizures at the U.S.–Mexico border suggest a rise in fentanyl trafficking.  Synthetic 
drugs are increasingly transported in poly-drug loads and sometimes pressed into pills disguised 
as prescription medications for sale in illicit markets.  In August, using Merida Initiative-funded 
non-intrusive inspection equipment, SEMAR seized 64 kg of material containing fentanyl and 
30,000 fentanyl-laced counterfeit pills at a checkpoint near the Arizona border.  During the first 
nine months of 2017, U.S. Customs and Border Protection had seized 224 kg of fentanyl at U.S. 
southwest border ports of entry, all from privately owned vehicles.  The United States supports 
SEMAR, SEDENA, Federal Police, Customs (SAT), and PGR with information sharing, 
training, and specialized equipment.  In January, SEMAR captured two Sinaloa Cartel 
“superlabs,” seizing over four MT of methamphetamine and thousands of liters of precursor 
chemicals.  
 
In January, Mexico extradited Joaquin “El Chapo” Guzman, former head of the Sinaloa Cartel, 
to the United States to stand trial.  In May, Mexican officials arrested Damaso Lopez Nunez, 
Guzman’s likely successor as the leader of the Sinaloa Cartel.  In addition to Lopez Nunez’s 
arrest, his son Damaso Lopez Serrano surrendered to law enforcement authorities in July at the 
U.S.–Mexico border, the first time a high-ranking cartel leader ever voluntarily surrendered to 
law enforcement authorities in the United States.   
 


INCSR 2018 Volume 1  
 
 
 
 
Country Reports 
222 
 
In July, Mexico’s General Health Council (Consejo de Salubridad General) officially added two 
primary fentanyl precursors, ANPP and NPP, to its list of controlled substances.  The United 
States and UNODC are providing upgrades to Mexico’s National Drug Control System software 
to track precursor chemicals entering Mexico and avoid diversion to illicit use.   
 
The Merida Initiative-funded “Clandestine Laboratory Initiative” trained and equipped Mexican 
law enforcement units to identify and safely dismantle clandestine drug laboratories that produce 
heroin, fentanyl, and methamphetamine.  The Mexican units trained by the United States have 
seized more than 300 clandestine laboratories since 2015.  Between June and August, SEMAR 
reported seizing over 26 MT of methamphetamine, over 38,000 liters of methamphetamine 
precursors, and 16 clandestine methamphetamine laboratories.  The Merida Initiative-funded 
“Fentanyl Training and Protection Initiative” will train and equip Mexican fentanyl response 
teams to safely identify and seize fentanyl.   
 
Canines donated by the Merida Initiative to Mexico made significant seizures of illicit drugs in 
2017, including fentanyl.  At the port of Manzanillo, Merida-donated canines located 1,500 
fentanyl pills hidden inside shoes destined to the United States.  A Merida-donated canine 
detected 120 ten milliliter (ml) vials of ketamine, a 10 ml vial of fentanyl, and another 2 ml vial 
of fentanyl at the Tijuana Airport.  A Merida-donated canine detected over 600 fentanyl tablets 
hidden in a box of coffee at the DHL office in Guadalajara Airport.  From 2012 to 2016, Merida-
donated canines to the Mexican Customs and Federal Police contributed to the detection and 
seizure of 39.84 MT of marijuana and 1.3 MT of cocaine.  
 
In 2017, the Royal Canadian Mounted Police – the first police force in the world to train their 
dogs in fentanyl detection – began training U.S. and Mexican canine units in fentanyl detection.   
 
3. Public Information, Prevention, and Treatment 
 
Mexico’s National Commission Against Addictions (CONADIC) released preliminary data in 
June showing an increase in overall marijuana use, up from six percent in 2011 to 8.6 percent in 
2016, and stable use of cocaine (3.5 percent), inhalants (glue, aerosols, markers, etc., 1.1 
percent), and amphetamine-type stimulants (0.9 percent).  There is no indication fentanyl is 
being used domestically in Mexico.   
 
The United States has supported implementation of court-supervised treatment for criminal 
offenders with drug use problems in Mexico since 2009.  Currently, five Mexican states operate 
29 drug treatment courts including five juvenile courts, all of which received training and 
assistance from the United States.   
 
4. Corruption 
 
The Government of Mexico does not, as a matter of government policy, encourage or facilitate 
illicit drug production or distribution, nor is it involved in laundering the proceeds of the sale of 
illicit drugs.  Although federal anti-corruption standards are improving, corruption continues to 
impede Mexican drug control efforts.

Mexico’s Attorney General Raul Cervantes announced his resignation on October 16, 2017 after 
one year in office, following a push by the ruling Institutional Revolutionary Party to appoint 
him as Mexico’s next Prosecutor General, a new position with a nine-year term that would 
replace the Attorney General.  The Peña Nieto administration announced the appointment of the 
new Prosecutor General would be delayed until after the July 2018 presidential elections. 
 
At the federal level, the Senate has not yet appointed a special anti-corruption prosecutor as 
mandated by Mexico’s National Anti-Corruption System, or approved the selection of the 18 
administrative judges charged with ruling on corruption cases.   
 
Mexico arrested several high-profile former government officials linked to corruption in 2017.  
In July, PGR took custody of former governor of Veracruz Javier Duarte, who went into hiding 
in Guatemala and faces federal and state corruption charges.  Mexico also seeks the extradition 
from Panama of former governor of Quintana Roo Roberto Borge.  Nayarit state officials opened 
an investigation against current governor Roberto Sandoval.  In October, former Governor of 
Tamaulipas Eugenio Hernandez Flores was arrested on Mexican charges of misuse of public 
funds and use of illicit funds.   
 
C. National Goals, Bilateral Cooperation, and U.S. Policy Initiatives 
 
Through the Merida Initiative, in 2017 the United States launched a program to create an 
information sharing system for Mexico that will be interoperable with U.S. law enforcement 
systems.  The program vastly improves Mexico’s capability to partner with U.S. law 
enforcement to counter terrorism, dismantle transnational criminal organizations (TCOs), curtail 
irregular migration, and identify criminals and special interest aliens. 
 
The United States and Mexico held the first-ever trilateral National Fentanyl Conference in May 
for forensic chemists from Mexico, the United States, and Canada to share best practices on the 
detection, analysis, and handling of fentanyl.  On August 10, the U.S.–Mexico Bilateral Drug 
Policy Working Group met for the third time and shared progress reports in the effort to combat 
illicit drugs, and highlighted avenues for sustained future cooperation.   
 
In May, the United States and Mexico held the first Cabinet-level Strategic Dialogue on 
Disrupting TCOs to define a new approach to addressing the business model of TCOs, with 
emphasis on drug production, drug distribution, cross-border movement of cash and weapons, 
drug demand markets, and illicit revenue.  The second Cabinet-level Dialogue in December  
continued to advance this bilateral approach.  
 
The fourth Security Cooperation Group was held in Mexico City in October  as a sub-Cabinet 
level working group of the Strategic Dialogue on TCOs.  The meeting reviewed joint U.S.–
Mexico efforts to weaken TCO networks; stem opium poppy cultivation and heroin production; 
combat the movement of fentanyl and other illicit opioids; reduce demand for illicit drugs in the 
United States; enhance border security; and increase efforts to deny transnational criminals 
revenue and involvement in money laundering, human smuggling, and human trafficking.

D. Conclusion 
 
Drug trafficking, corruption, and related violence remain substantial challenges to citizen 
security in Mexico.  Illicit drug cultivation is a particular challenge, with data trends suggesting 
illicit opium poppy cultivation will continue to grow.  The United States will increase bilateral 
cooperation to work toward achieving security goals shared by both nations, to include denying

Morocco 
 
Morocco remains one of the top cannabis-producing countries in the world, with Europe being a 
primary market.   Moroccan authorities’ enhanced deployment of x-ray scanners at the port of 
Tangier, as well as enhanced use of canine interdiction units and other border controls, appears 
to be deterring traffickers from the use of commercialized containers for smuggling activity, and 
drug trafficking networks are increasingly turning to the use of “go-fast” boats and non-
commercial airplanes to smuggle cannabis products into Spain.  Moroccan hashish is also 
smuggled south into Mauritania, where it is further trafficked across Mali and into Libya for 
onward transshipment and distribution.  In an emerging trend, hashish is also smuggled to South 
America and the Caribbean where it is being exchanged for cocaine that is then transported to 
Europe for distribution.  Traffickers are also expanding trafficking routes within the country by 
moving hashish south and then to Morocco’s coast for non-commercial maritime shipment to 
Europe or overland shipment to African markets.   
 
Over the past decade, Moroccan cannabis farmers have been substituting traditional seeds with 
hybrid strains capable of producing larger yields and higher THC levels.  Yields obtained from 
hybrid seeds and improved agricultural techniques are three to five times higher than those 
obtained from traditional cannabis farming methods.  THC levels have increased from 
approximately 15 percent to an estimated 23 percent, on average.  Open source research indicates 
that European demand for higher potency THC products drove the switch to hybrid seeds.  
Accurate cannabis cultivation and hashish production estimates are not available.   
 
Morocco also remains a transit point for the maritime shipment of cocaine smuggled into Europe 
but has made progress in countering trafficking activity.  Cocaine seizures increased in 2017, 
which Moroccan authorities attribute to increased surveillance, border controls and to continued 
cooperation with Spanish and other European partners.  On October 4, Moroccan authorities 
reported seizing approximately 2,588 kilograms of cocaine having a street value estimated 
between $40 and1$100 million.  This cocaine was stored at multiple locations near Rabat, 
Bouznika, and Nador, awaiting further transshipment to Europe.  It was reported that the cocaine 
was 93 percent pure, thus enabling traffickers to add cutting agents and diluents that increase 
volume thereby maximizing profits.  The government announced that 13 suspects were arrested 
in connection with the coordinated operation, and the ringleaders appeared to be of Dutch and 
Moroccan origin.  In January and February 2017, Moroccan police also conducted operations 
that resulted in the confiscation of more than 200,000 MDMA (ecstasy) tablets.  
 
The United States has a mutual legal assistance treaty with Morocco that entered into force in 
1993.  The U.S. does not have an extradition treaty with Morocco, but Morocco has been willing 
to surrender fugitives to the U.S. via extradition, deportation, expulsion, or otherwise lawful 
removal pursuant to its domestic law.

Mozambique 
 
Mozambique is increasingly being used as a transit point for heroin and the precursor chemicals 
required for its production, as well as for hashish.  South Asian drug trafficking networks are 
increasingly exploiting Mozambique as a transit hub both to access the South African market and 
to move products through neighboring countries to markets in Europe, and North America.  Drug 
interdiction efforts in Kenya and Tanzania, coupled with the Combined Maritime Forces 
operations in the Indian Ocean, may have encouraged traffickers to develop these alternative 
southern routes through Mozambique.  Drug control efforts in Mozambique are hampered by 
financial constraints, endemic corruption, the country’s long coastline, and relatively unguarded 
land border. 
 
Mozambique has a vast coastline, similar in size to the American west coast, which is largely 
unpatrolled by maritime and land forces.  Heroin and hashish primarily arrive in the country via 
maritime shipment from South Asia.  Shipments are either hidden in containerized cargo or 
arrive on ships, which anchor illegally off Mozambique’s northern coastline and utilize smaller 
watercraft to transport their cargo to informal, isolated beach landing sites.  Once in the country, 
heroin and hashish can easily be warehoused and transported via the national highway system to 
any of six neighboring countries.  Access to major international air and cargo hubs in South 
Africa allow for further distribution.  A smaller quantity of heroin and hashish exits the country 
on direct flights to South Africa and Portugal hidden in either personal baggage or air cargo. 
 
Mozambique would benefit from additional efforts to strengthen its insufficient law enforcement 
capacity.  The government is receptive to increased border security and law enforcement 
engagement.  The U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration has established a positive working 
relationship with the office of the Attorney General and the Republic of Mozambique Police to 
enhance cooperation and information sharing.  Mozambique also signed memorandums of 
understanding with Vietnam and Belarus in 2017 to promote greater law enforcement 
cooperation. 
 
The United States has neither a bilateral mutual legal assistance treaty nor an extradition treaty 
with Mozambique.  Some mutual legal assistance requests are processed under multilateral 
conventions that enable such cooperation.

The Netherlands  
 
The Netherlands is a significant transit country for illicit drugs, especially cocaine, entering 
through the port of Rotterdam.  The Netherlands also remains an important source country of 
synthetic drugs, primarily MDMA (ecstasy), primarily for international markets.  The volume of 
internet-facilitated trafficking of synthetic drugs has increased significantly.  Usage of new 
psychoactive substances is reportedly limited, though para-fluoroamphetamine (4-FA) is 
growing in popularity.  
  
The Dutch Opium Act prohibits the possession, commercial distribution, production, import, and 
export of all illicit drugs.  The act distinguishes between “hard” drugs (e.g., heroin, cocaine, 
MDMA), and “soft” drugs (cannabis products).  Sales of less than five grams of cannabis 
products are “tolerated” (illegal but not prosecuted) in regulated establishments called “coffee 
shops.”  Since 2015, the Opium Act also criminalizes preparation of cannabis cultivation.  The 
national government encourages local governments to implement a residency requirement that 
limits coffee shop purchases to residents of the Netherlands.  Enforcement is a local matter, with 
most municipalities adhering to this requirement except in a few cities, including Amsterdam.  
  
Dutch police and mail delivery companies established a Mail/Parcel Intervention Team (PIT) in 
2017 to intercept outbound envelopes and parcels containing small amounts of drugs often 
purchased through both open and restricted (“dark web”) internet sites  
  
Authorities in the port of Rotterdam arrested several port employees for suspected involvement 
in drug smuggling in 2017.  In 2016, the most recent year for which data is available, authorities 
seized 43 metric tons (MT) of cocaine destined for the Netherlands, including 14 MT at the 
country’s ports.  Cocaine traffickers consider the Netherlands a reliable transportation hub.  
Passengers on flights from the Dutch Caribbean, Suriname, and Venezuela are subject to “100 
percent screening” for drugs.  
  
Historically, Dutch and U.S. law enforcement agencies have maintained close operational 
cooperation, but due to a recent reorganization of the Dutch police and capacity issues, there has 
been a significant decrease in the exchange of information.  The United States and the 
Netherlands have fully operational extradition and mutual legal assistance agreements.  
  
The Royal Netherlands Navy patrols the Dutch Caribbean for drug interdiction operations.  The 
Netherlands has a memorandum of understanding with the United States, which enables the 
deployment of U.S. Coast Guard Law Enforcement Detachment Teams and Airborne Use of 
Force Detachments on Royal Netherlands Navy vessels to suppress illicit trafficking in the 
waters of the Caribbean.  The Netherlands is a party to the Caribbean Regional Maritime 
Agreement and a partner in the U.S. Joint Interagency Task Force South.  The Netherlands is a 
member of the Maritime Analysis and Operation Centre-Narcotics.

Nicaragua 
 
A.  Introduction  
  
Nicaragua remains a transit route for illicit drug trafficking.  Nicaragua’s long Atlantic and 
Pacific coasts, large inland lakes, porous border crossings, and sparsely-populated and 
underdeveloped Caribbean coastal region provide a favorable environment for international 
criminal groups to exploit – smuggling contraband, including drugs, weapons, currency, and 
people.  Domestic production of marijuana also occurs and Nicaragua faces a growing 
domestic market for illegal drugs.  
  
The Government of Nicaragua’s Strategic Plan for 2016-2022 and three national strategies 
include lines of effort to strengthen the fight against organized crime, drug trafficking, and 
drug use.  Its “Retaining Wall” (Muro de Contención) strategy endorses a coordinated effort 
to stop drug traffickers from entering the country; however Nicaragua does not have 
sufficient resources to exercise complete control over its air, land, and sea borders.  
Nicaragua’s limited technical and logistical capacity to conduct successful interdiction 
operations, including a lack of dedicated air assets, is further challenged by limited mobility 
and communications to patrol the sparsely populated regions in the Caribbean region where 
some traffickers operate freely. 
  
Widespread corruption and a lack of transparency at all levels of government hinders 
Nicaragua’s efforts to fight drug trafficking. 
  
B.  Drug Control Accomplishments, Policies, and Trends  
  
 
1.  Institutional Development  
  
In 2017, Nicaragua took steps toward regional integration and cooperation with 
international bodies to support the fight against drug trafficking; however, limited 
information sharing, a lack of transparency, and limited working-level cooperation 
constrained the efficacy of Nicaragua’s outreach.  Nicaragua does not have any vetted units, 
which hinders its participation in bilateral and regional operations against organized crime 
and drug trafficking.  
      
Nicaragua maintains close ties with Russia.  In April, officials of both countries inaugurated 
a Global Navigation Satellite System ground station in Managua that they claim will support 
the fight against drug trafficking and organized crime.  In October, the Russian-funded 
international police counternarcotics training facility was inaugurated with a regional 
training mission.  
  
The Government of Nicaragua signed two memorandums of understanding in 2017 with 
Taiwan and Mexico dealing with security and military cooperation. 
  
The National Nicaraguan Police and Nicaraguan military are the primary institutions 
countering drug trafficking in the country.  There is limited information sharing between the 


INCSR 2018 Volume 1  
 
 
 
 
Country Reports 
229 
 
two institutions and there is limited coverage of the country particularly in the sparsely-
populated Caribbean Coast.  The Nicaraguan government reported it is developing a new 
national counter-drug intelligence system to improve the flow of information at the national 
level, and 600 officers were added to the police force in 2017 to strengthen citizen security 
and expand police presence.   
  
The Cooperative Situational and Information Integration System, which enables greater 
international law enforcement intelligence sharing, remains in effect, as does the maritime 
counterdrug bilateral agreement signed in November 2001.  Information sharing from 
Nicaragua is limited, however, and often not accurate or timely. 
  
The Inter-American Convention on Mutual Legal Assistance in Criminal Matters, to which 
Nicaragua and the United States are both parties, facilitates the sharing of legal information 
between countries.  However, cooperation in this area is not robust due to the low volume of 
requests.  In the past, the Government of Nicaragua has rarely provided assistance within 
requested timeframes.   
  
The United States and Nicaragua are parties to an extradition treaty signed in 1905 and 
ratified in 1907, but the Nicaraguan constitution bars the extradition of Nicaraguan citizens.  
An International Criminal Police Organization Red Notice is usually required for wanted 
individuals in order for the Government of Nicaragua to cooperate with the United States in 
expelling non-Nicaraguan citizen fugitives.   
  
 
2.  Supply Reduction  
  
There was no discernible change in the volume of drugs transiting Nicaragua in 2017.  
However, there continued to be evidence of increased domestic drug use, increased illegal 
drug production (mainly of marijuana), and the existence of clandestine airstrips in remote 
areas of the country.  Though some traffickers continue to smuggle illicit drugs through the 
isolated Caribbean Coast, many trafficking organizations have shifted their operations to 
deep-water routes in the Pacific Coast using larger, longer-range transportation.  This allows 
larger quantities of drugs to travel further out to sea, avoiding detection by law enforcement 
and the threat of pirates in the Caribbean regions.  Drug traffickers are also adapting 
equipment and technology such as GPS to submerge and later locate drug loads.  Illicit 
drugs are also trafficked via land and air.  There were several seizures of cocaine at the land 
border crossing with Honduras in 2017.   
  
The Government of Nicaragua reported that authorities seized 4.8 metric tons (MT) of 
cocaine during the first 10 months of 2017, an increase over the 4.17 MT seized in all of 
2016.  Authorities reported seizing 1.17 MT of marijuana over this same 10-month period in 
2017, compared to 1.96 MT seized during all of 2016.  Nicaraguan authorities reportedly 
destroyed, both on their own and in joint operations with Honduras, 994,787 cannabis plants 
growing in the country’s north central regions and along the Caribbean Coast, significantly 
higher than the 275,000 destroyed in 2016.  Authorities reported seizing $5,134,993 in cash, 
vehicles and boats worth $506,000,  arresting 3,181 people for drug crimes, and conducting 
7,833 operations targeting local and international drug trafficking.

Country Reports

Nicaragua inconsistently shared information on seizures with the United States in 2017, 
including evidence about the destruction of illicit drugs.  
   
 
3.  Public Information, Prevention, and Treatment  
 
There are no reliable national statistics on drug consumption within Nicaragua, but there are 
anecdotal reports of increased use of marijuana, crack, and cocaine, especially in the 
Caribbean Coast regions and among adolescents.  The lack of statistics makes it difficult to 
measure the impact of prevention and treatment programs.  
  
The Government of Nicaragua reports the Nicaraguan National Police, in coordination with 
the Ministry of Education and the Institute Against Alcoholism and Drug Addiction, 
provided drug prevention education for more than 240,000 youths in 165 schools, technical 
institutes, and universities in 2017.  Due to continued resource constraints, however, these 
programs only reached 15 percent of the school age population.  The Nicaraguan 
government also reported offering drug prevention activities for 748 public servants and 
5,905 juvenile offenders, and at-risk youth not attending school, to include educational 
movie screenings, prevention talks, neighborhood meetings, marches to raise awareness, 
and sports and cultural activities to raise awareness and to prevent violence and drug use.  
  
The police have cooperation agreements with 12 of Nicaragua’s 22 drug rehabilitation 
centers, all of which are privately run by non-governmental organizations (NGOs), to which 
they refer persons with substance use disorders.  In 2017, the 11 centers that provided 
information reported serving 9,054 people, of which 48.6 percent consumed illicit drugs, 
mainly marijuana, inhalants, cocaine, and crack.  Private treatment centers in Nicaragua 
offer two models of patient service:  out-patient and residential.  Free treatment centers are 
scarce in Nicaragua, and some treatment centers charge a high monthly fee between $2,000 
and $3,000 per patient. 
  
NGOs continue efforts to prevent drug use and provide treatment to those suffering from 
substance use disorders.  The United States provides support to fund programs focused on 
citizen security, drug prevention, and life skills for at-risk youth, including a grant for a 
multi-media drug and violence prevention campaign that has reached more than one million 
people.  
  
 
4.  Corruption  
  
The Government of Nicaragua does not, as a matter of government policy, encourage or 
facilitate illicit drug production or distribution, nor is it involved in laundering the proceeds 
of the sale of illicit drugs.  However, Nicaragua’s close relationship with Venezuela, reports 
of institutional corruption at all levels, and international claims that officials in Nicaragua 
were complicit in money laundering are of concern.  During 2017 several police officers 
were arrested for corruption, and more than 60 were dishonorably discharged, but there 
were no official corruption cases directly linked to drug trafficking.  Independent security 


INCSR 2018 Volume 1  
 
 
 
 
Country Reports

analysts note that prosecution of police corruption cases has been isolated to low-ranked 
officers, despite allegations of involvement by middle and high-ranking officials.  
  
During the year an alleged international drug trafficker from Colombia and a wanted MS-13 
member from El Salvador were arrested in Nicaragua on drug trafficking charges.  Both of 
these foreign suspects carried Nicaraguan national identification cards and one was 
allegedly assisted by a local judge.  The judge and her son are under investigation for 
allegedly receiving money to free a Nicaraguan accused of organized crime and for 
facilitating issuance of the identification card.   
  
The Managua Appeals Court absolved two people previously convicted of drug trafficking 
and organized crime in a high profile 2012 case linked to the death of Argentinian singer 
Facundo Cabral in Guatemala.  The court significantly reduced their prison sentences, but 
confirmed the sentences of the other 20 people convicted in the case. 
  
Nicaragua’s criminal law contains provisions against corruption such as bribery, abuse of 
authority, influence peddling, and embezzlement.  There is also a law regarding the 
investigation and prosecution of organized crime (Law 735).  Law 735 provides for the 
establishment of a unit to administer seized assets, but there is little transparency or public 
accountability in how seized assets are managed.  In addition, a lack of checks and balances 
within the judicial system and corruption hinder meaningful prosecution of serious crimes in 
the country.  
  
C.  National Goals, Bilateral Cooperation, and U.S. Policy Initiatives 
  
The Nicaraguan government has demonstrated some willingness to investigate and take 
action against drug-related activities.  In 2017, in line with U.S. policy to reduce the flow of 
illegal drugs to the United States and improve security in Central America, the United States 
assisted Nicaragua by supporting drug control efforts, including infrastructure, targeted 
equipping and training of Nicaraguan security forces, and funding prevention programs with 
NGOs. 
  
The United States cooperates with the Nicaraguan Navy to enhance maritime interdiction 
capacity.  In 2017, the United States donated a Forward Operating Post at a strategic 
transshipment point in the northeastern Caribbean in support of the Nicaraguan Navy 
efforts.  Refurbished boats and communication equipment provided through U.S. assistance 
have been used in significant seizures.  The United States trained the Nicaraguan Navy 
special reaction team and others in areas such as tactical and strategic communications, 
maritime engine overhaul, maintenance and operations of boats, and combat lifesaving to 
enhance the Nicaraguan Navy’s capacity.  The Nicaraguan Navy has approved joint patrols 
with the U.S. Coast Guard.  Coordination between the U.S. Drug Enforcement 
Administration, the U.S. Joint Interagency Task Force South, and Tactical Analysis Teams 
with Nicaraguan authorities resulted in successful interdictions of one metric ton of cocaine, 
$1.6 million in cash, and the seizure of a “go-fast” boat in 2017.  The United States also 
supported the participation of a police commissioner at the International Drug Enforcement 
Conference in 2017 to strengthen regional interoperability, and continues to support the 


INCSR 2018 Volume 1  
 
 
 
 
Country Reports 
232 
 
integration of Nicaragua into the Cooperative Situational and Information Integration 
System.  
  
The United States continues to provide resources to non-governmental drug demand 
reduction programs in the North and South Caribbean Autonomous Regions and the 
Managua area, where populations are vulnerable to drugs and violence.  These grant 
projects have served to increase citizen security through drug prevention awareness 
campaigns, community development, youth leadership training, and alternative education 
intervention programs for at-risk youth in Nicaragua. 
 
The United States maintains a bilateral agreement with Nicaragua to suppress illicit traffic by 
sea, which include provisions regarding ship boarding, shipriders, pursuit, entry into territorial 
waters, overflight, order to land, and international maritime interdiction support.  Nicaragua was 
a participant in the semi-annual Multilateral Maritime Counter Drug Summit held in November 
2017, which attracted 125 maritime counterdrug professionals from nearly 25 countries and over 
65 international agencies spanning North, Central and South America, and Europe.    
  
D.  Conclusion  
  
The Government of Nicaragua has developed policies and programs to combat drug 
trafficking, reduce drug demand, and enhance institutional coordination.  The Nicaraguan 
government should improve its efforts to combat organized crime by expanding its capacity 
to monitor air, land, and maritime space within the vulnerable Caribbean coast and Pacific 
border regions of the country.  Attention should also be increased to broadening coverage of 
drug prevention programs and drug rehabilitation facilities.

Nigeria 
 
A.  Introduction 
 
Nigeria is a significant transit country for heroin and cocaine destined for Europe, and to a much 
lesser degree, the United States.  Nigerian organized criminal networks remain major actors in 
trafficking cocaine and heroin worldwide, facilitated by the extended Nigerian diaspora, and 
have become major producers and traffickers of methamphetamine primarily to and around 
Southeast Asia.  Widespread corruption in Nigeria facilitates criminal activity, and, combined 
with Nigeria’s central location along major trafficking routes, enables criminal groups to flourish 
and make Nigeria an important trafficking hub.  
 
The Nigeria Drug Law Enforcement Agency (NDLEA) enforces laws against drug trafficking 
and abuse and leads in demand reduction and drug control policy development.  Weak inter-
agency cooperation, insufficient criminal enterprise investigative capacity, and inadequate 
electronic evidence collection all contribute to a dearth of apprehensions of major traffickers.  
Although all Nigerian law enforcement agencies have representatives at Nigeria’s ports of entry, 
joint operations among them have been historically rare – a situation improved somewhat in 
2017 due to the inception of a new joint agency task force sponsored by the United Kingdom 
with U.S. assistance. 
 
B.  Drug Control Accomplishments, Policies, and Trends  
 
4. Institutional Development 
 
In 2017, the NDLEA introduced a new interagency task force to target drug trafficking and other 
crimes, sponsored by assistance the United Kingdom with U.S. assistance.  The Joint Border 
Task Force (JBTF), funded and overseen by the United Kingdom’s National Crime Agency 
(NCA) and based in Lagos, is a multi-agency effort to target, interdict, disrupt, dismantle, and 
prosecute Nigerian based transnational criminal organizations.  The task force, developed in 
consultation with NCA and the U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA), is a fully-vetted 
and well-trained Nigerian law enforcement and criminal intelligence unit based at the Murtala 
Muhammed International Airport (MMIA) in Lagos, Nigeria.  The airport is viewed as the 
gateway for Nigerian criminal organizations involved in drug smuggling and an array of other 
illegal cross border activity.   
 
The NDLEA leads the JBTF, contributing 140 officers.  The officers receive mentoring and 
investigative assistance by NCA officers embedded in the unit.  The task force also includes 20 
investigative officers from the National Agency for the Prohibition of Trafficking of Persons 
(NAPTIP), along with two NAPTIP prosecutors and four NDLEA prosecutors. 
 
In addition to establishing the unit, NCA refurbished the NDLEA MMIA Airport Command 
office building.  The United States provided airport interdiction training for the unit and donated 
two generators for the newly refurbished command center.  Drug seizures at MMIA totaled 
approximately 1.22 metric tons (MT) during the first nine months of 2017, an increase of 
approximately 600 percent in comparison to the same period in 2016.

Extradition between Nigeria and the United States is governed by the 1931 U.S.-U.K. 
Extradition Treaty.  There is a bilateral mutual legal assistance treaty in force between Nigeria 
and the United States.  In addition, the United States and Nigeria are parties to various 
multilateral conventions that contain provisions for mutual legal assistance. 
 
5. Supply Reduction 
 
In 2017, the United States continued to provide mentoring and investigative support to assist in 
reforming the NDLEA from a reactive investigative agency to an intelligence-led, proactive 
force.  During the first 10 months of 2017, the NDLEA reported seizing approximately 376.8 
MT of cannabis; 359.25 kilograms (kg) of methamphetamine; 80.66 kg of cocaine; 51.48 kg of 
heroin; 2.9 kg of amphetamine-type stimulants; 124.6 kg of ephedrine; and over 22.77 MT of 
other psychotropic substances.  
 
The U.S.-supported Sensitive Investigative Unit (SIU) is credited with seizing 18.45 kg of 
cannabis, 18.2 kg of methamphetamine and 4 kg of heroin.  Additionally, the SIU provided 
intelligence to other international drug agencies that led to the seizure of 9.2 kg of cocaine and 
62.82 kg of methamphetamine. 
 
In 2017, the NDLEA’s budget was approximately $25.5 million, which represented no 
incremental change in funding from 2016.  Of this amount, $46,760 was allocated for NDLEA 
staff training, an increase of $5,000 from the previous year. 
 
Since 2011, 11 clandestine methamphetamine laboratories have been detected in Nigeria, making 
Nigeria an emerging major producing country for methamphetamine.  In February 2016, the 
NDLEA discovered one clandestine laboratory capable of producing between three and four 
metric tons (MT) of methamphetamine every seven to 10 days.  One kg of 99 percent pure 
Nigerian-produced methamphetamine sells for as little as $7,500 in Lagos and over $150,000 in 
Southeast Asian countries such as Malaysia.  
 
 
3.  Public Information, Prevention, and Treatment 
 
There were frequent media reports citing government officials warning of increased drug use in 
Nigeria in 2017.  Anecdotal reporting suggests there is a growing local market for drugs, such as 
cocaine, that have traditionally only been trafficked through the country to international 
destinations.  While cocaine remains accessible only for the wealthy, prescription drugs such as 
codeine, tranquilizers and tramadol are easily accessible on the streets of Lagos despite the best 
efforts of the government.   
 
The NDLEA’s Demand Reduction Directorate has reinvigorated its programs targeting youth, 
sex workers, community leaders, and transport workers.   In 2017, the NDLEA counseled and 
rehabilitated 1,602 persons suffering from substance use disorders, a decrease of 46 percent from 
the previous year.  
 
5. Corruption 


INCSR 2018 Volume 1  
 
 
 
 
Country Reports 
235 
 
 
The Government of Nigeria does not encourage or facilitate the production or distribution of 
illicit drugs, nor the laundering of proceeds from illegal drug transactions as a matter of policy.  
Corruption remains an endemic problem within Nigeria, however, and to reduce corruption’s 
impact on drug trafficking, the NDLEA has partnered with the United States and the United 
Kingdom in the creation of fully vetted units within the agency.  The three units operating within 
the NDLEA are the U.S.-supported SIU; the U.K.-supported Combined Inter-Agency Task Force 
(CIATF); and the JBTF.  The vetting process involves a complete background check, annual 
polygraph examinations and a structured interview of each candidate.  The objective is to recruit 
trusted members, who have no history of previous corrupt activity and are capable of handling 
and processing sensitive intelligence and working high profile investigations.   
 
In June 2017, the NDLEA arrested an Inspector of Police, Bola Adigun, attached to the 
Economic and Financial Crimes Commission, for transporting cannabis.  In August and 
September 2017, the JBTF arrested 13 individuals, including staff members of two airport 
ground handling companies at the MMIA for drug trafficking through the airport. 
 
C.  National Goals, Bilateral Cooperation, and U.S. Policy Initiatives 
 
The NDLEA had two primary national goals for 2017; the passage of a Drug Sentencing Bill 
requesting a mandatory minimum five-year sentence for drug possession and an increase of 
15,000 personnel.  The sentencing bill had not passed through the National Assembly as of 
November, and, although the President approved the agency’s request for an increase in 
personnel, funding has not been allocated to begin recruitment. 
 
D.  Conclusion 
 
The United States will continue to engage the Government of Nigeria to combat drug trafficking, 
corruption, money laundering, and other criminal issues.  The institutional and societal factors 
that contribute to these activities remain deeply rooted and will require a comprehensive and 
collaborative effort.  Progress will require sustained Nigerian government efforts and political 
will.

Pakistan 
 
A.  Introduction 
 
Pakistan continues to be one of the world’s top transit corridors for opiates and cannabis 
products, which are trafficked through the porous borders with Afghanistan and Iran.  Illicit 
drugs are then distributed globally through Pakistan’s seaports, airports, postal services, and 
unpatrolled coastal areas.  The United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime (UNODC) estimates 
Pakistan is the destination and transit country for approximately 40 percent of the opiates 
produced in Afghanistan.  Pakistan is also a major transit country for precursor chemicals used to 
produce heroin and methamphetamine, though Pakistan is only able to interdict a fraction of the 
chemicals diverted through the country.   
  
Overall opium poppy cultivation within Pakistan increased by an estimated 51 percent from 2015 
to 2016, according to the most recent available U.S. estimates.  Most opium poppy cultivation 
continues to take place within the Federally Administered Tribal Areas (FATA) and Khyber 
Pakhtunkhwa (KP) province, enabled by low levels of economic development and civilian 
security in the regions.    
   
In 2017, Pakistan’s law enforcement agencies reported multiple noteworthy seizures and claim to 
have disrupted eight drug trafficking organizations identified by Pakistan.  Pakistan’s Anti-
Narcotics Force (ANF), the country’s lead drug enforcement agency, reported that during the 
first 10 months of 2017, it seized approximately 26.65 metric tons (MT) of morphine and heroin; 
31.78 MT of opium; 386 kilograms of cocaine; and 97.46 MT of hashish.  Overall 2017 seizures 
represent a 28 percent decrease from 2016, and the total volume of cocaine seized in 2017 
decreased nearly two-fold.  The Government of Pakistan’s budget limitations and, in some cases, 
lack of political will hindered drug control efforts.  As poppy cultivation and opiate production 
increase in Afghanistan, Pakistan’s limited resources and law enforcement capacity will be 
further strained. 
   
Domestic drug consumption continues to be an area of concern.  According to a 2013 UNODC 
nationwide survey, Pakistan is home to 6.7 million drug users, and approximately 20 MT of 
heroin is consumed within the country annually.  Pakistan currently lacks the capacity to provide 
effective, non-residential substance use disorder treatment and to systematically incorporate a 
scientific-based approach to drug prevention education.   
 
B.  Drug Control Accomplishments, Policies, and Trends 
 
 
1.  Institutional Development 
 
In 2017, the Ministry of Narcotics Control (MNC) was reestablished as a cabinet-level ministry, 
with organizational oversight of ANF.  The reorganization raised the profile of the MNC and 
reinforced the Government of Pakistan’s commitment to counter illicit drugs, but it remains to be 
seen what practical consequences result from the change.  The Government of Pakistan has also 
indicated that it plans to increase the ANF’s budget and resources in 2018.  By June 2018, the 


INCSR 2018 Volume 1  
 
 
 
 
Country Reports 
237 
 
ANF anticipates establishing a new coastal Regional Directorate in Balochistan, to more than 
double the agency’s capacity in the province by adding 32 officers and 704 officials.   
   
ANF coordinated illicit drug investigations with multiple foreign counterparts in 2017, including 
the United States, United Kingdom, Canada, Sri Lanka, Malaysia, and the United Arab 
Emirates.  Pakistan hosts at least 32 foreign Drug Liaison Officers as part of its Paris Pact 
obligations.  ANF also partnered with the U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) and the 
United Kingdom’s National Crime Agency to operate the Special Investigation Cells 
(SICs).  However, in 2017, DEA was unable to obtain any drug samples for forensic analysis in 
the United States, as the ANF claims seized drugs are the property of the courts, which alone 
may determine whether to provide such samples.   
   
In 2017, ANF chaired the 10th Inter-Agency Task Force meeting, comprising 27 Pakistani 
agencies and intended to enhance coordination and communication on drug control.  Staffed at 
senior levels by Pakistan Army officers, ANF is a civilian law enforcement agency 
constitutionally mandated to serve as Pakistan’s lead drug control entity.   
   
ANF’s 2017 federal budget was $20.2 million, while its budget for 2018 is projected to increase 
to $21.6 million.  Nevertheless, even taking the 2018 budget increase into account, the funds are 
insufficient to support ANF’s daunting mission and limit its capacity to adequately perform key 
sustainability functions, such as operational maintenance of vehicles and equipment.  Over 65 
percent of ANF’s budget is used to pay the salaries of its 3,100 employees, who are thinly 
deployed across 40 stations and field offices.  These posts span every province and territory, 
except the FATA.  In 2017, the ANF Academy provided instruction to over 1,000 trainees across 
Pakistan’s law enforcement community.  Pakistan Customs is the only federal law enforcement 
agency conducting routine drug control operations in every province and territory, including the 
FATA.   
   
The United States and Pakistan do not have a bilateral mutual legal assistance treaty.  Pakistan is 
a party to relevant multilateral law enforcement conventions that have mutual legal assistance 
provisions.  The U.S. and Pakistan can also make and receive requests for assistance on the basis 
of domestic laws.  Enforcement of the 1931 Extradition Treaty between the United States and the 
United Kingdom (adopted by Pakistan upon independence) has been problematic.   
 
 
2.  Supply Reduction 
 
Pakistan’s main opium poppy growing areas are in FATA and Khyber Pakhtunkhwa 
(KP).  Insecurity and extremist activity in these regions have prevented reliable ground surveying 
to determine precise cultivation levels.  During the first 10 months in 2017, ANF reported that 
240 hectares (ha) of poppy were cultivated during the 2016-2017 growing season, of which 149 
ha were eradicated.  However, 2016 U.S. government estimates indicated that approximately 
1,400 ha were under cultivation in traditional poppy growing areas.  Alternative livelihood and 
development programs for farmers, including distribution of seeds, agricultural training, and 
construction of small scale roads and irrigation projects, have discouraged poppy cultivation in 
some communities of KP and FATA.  However, Pakistan depends heavily on foreign assistance 


INCSR 2018 Volume 1  
 
 
 
 
Country Reports 
238 
 
to implement and monitor such programs.  Absent continued assistance, the economic viability 
and sustainability of these alternative crops remain in question. 
   
According to a 2009 UNODC study, the most recent available, 160 to 200 MT of Afghan heroin 
and 350 to 400 MT of opium were trafficked from Afghanistan to Pakistan annually.  Despite its 
best efforts, Pakistan is only able to interdict a fraction of that traffic.  ANF represents 0.5 
percent of Pakistan law enforcement and the rest of the nearly 600,000 police and paramilitary 
forces in Pakistan lack rigorous drug interdiction training and most do not address it as part of 
their core mission.  
   
ANF is responsible for conducting complex drug investigations with a small staff, while working 
within a judicial system where prosecutors and judges are overworked, underpaid, and ill-
prepared to successfully prosecute cases that involve modern investigative techniques.  During 
the first 10 months of 2017, ANF registered 1,029 drug arrest cases.  Pakistan does not have a 
conspiracy law and dictates that a suspect must be caught in the act to be apprehended.  These 
legal limitations have hindered ANF’s ability to apprehend high-value targets or kingpins.  The 
vast majority of prosecuted cases were low-level possession or small quantity courier 
trafficking.  ANF reported that 96 percent of the total cases brought to trial resulted in 
convictions, with 20 percent of the convictions overturned on appeal.  Suspects arrested by ANF 
are tried in special narcotics courts that hear only those cases brought by ANF’s own prosecutor 
corps.  ANF does not provide the United States with any documentation to support the high 
conviction rate claim, and ANF officials suggest that lengthy trial and appeal processes mean 
that suspects can spend years in pre-trial or under-trial detention before a final verdict is reached. 
   
Since passage of the Fair Trial Act in 2013, ANF can submit evidence gathered from telephone 
intercepts so long as they first receive permission from a judge to conduct the wiretap.  However, 
since the process for initiating judicial wire intercept takes six months at a minimum, the target 
telephone number is nearly always dropped by the target before the wiretap can be initiated.  For 
ANF to meet its mandate, it and the associated elements of the judicial system that try illicit drug 
cases will require greater public resources.  The Government of Pakistan would benefit from a 
comprehensive review of the country’s 2010 Counternarcotics Strategy, last amended in 2011, to 
facilitate improved coordination of provincial drug control efforts.  Though the ANF is a federal 
agency, Pakistan devolved considerable authority to its provinces under a 2010 amendment for 
responsibilities including health and social welfare.  Enhanced coordination between provincial 
and federal efforts would benefit overall drug control performance within the country. 
 
 
3.  Public Information, Prevention, and Treatment   
 
UNODC’s 2013 nationwide drug use survey indicated that 6.7 million Pakistanis aged 15 to 64 
had used drugs for non-medical purposes at least once in the previous 12 months.  In total, the 
survey classified 4.25 million drug users aged 15 to 64 as suffering from substance use 
disorders.  Cannabis and opioids were the most prevalent drugs consumed, with 4 million and 2.7 
million users, respectively.  The survey results also showed that for the 1.5 million female drug 
users, the majority reported misuse of opioid-based painkillers or synthetic tranquilizers and 
sedatives, rather than the cannabis, heroin, and opium used by male drug users.  Clinics and the 
ANF indicate an increased use of Iran-sourced crystal methamphetamine. 


INCSR 2018 Volume 1  
 
 
 
 
Country Reports 
239 
 
   
In 2017, Pakistan continued efforts to raise public awareness about the dangers of illicit drug 
use.  ANF conducted 230 public awareness raising activities and lectured frequently at 
universities, colleges, and schools about drug awareness.  In 2017, ANF also launched the ANF 
Youth Ambassador program and worked to develop standardized treatment protocols.  Evidence-
based, donor-funded training is increasing the impact of these campaigns.   
   
Pakistan could make better use of provincial-level institutions, such as hospitals and schools, to 
provide non-residential treatment options for patients with substance use disorders.  In 2017, 
Pakistan’s drug treatment capacity, with fewer than 100 clinics operating nationwide, remained 
insufficient.  Very few public hospitals offer either residential or non-residential substance use 
disorder treatment services.  Due to insufficient government resources, non-governmental 
organizations (NGOs) operate more than 90 percent of Pakistan’s detoxification centers.  As a 
result, cost remains the primary obstacle preventing widespread access to treatment, leaving the 
vast majority of those suffering from opioid addiction without help.  According to the most 
recent UNODC estimate, fewer than 30,000 drug users receive detoxification therapy 
annually.  Because Pakistan lacks the institutional capacity to serve women, the majority of drug 
users receiving treatment are men.  Donor-funded “train-the-trainer” programs have increased 
the number of addiction centers that provide evidence-based treatment.  These efforts could 
reduce remission rates, which currently approach 80 percent. 
 
 
4.  Corruption 
 
The Government of Pakistan does not, as a matter of government policy, encourage or facilitate 
illicit drug production or distribution, nor is it involved in laundering the proceeds of the sale of 
illicit drugs.  However, corruption remains a challenge, undermining the country’s criminal 
justice system.  The National Accountability Board (NAB) is Pakistan’s apex anti-graft agency 
responsible for eliminating corruption.  Since it was established more than 16 years ago, the 
NAB has recovered more than $2 billion and has received and taken action on more than 
320,000 complaints.  However, despite parliamentary oversight committees, an independent 
judicial system, and a critical free press that exposes corrupt practices, the consequences for 
convicted perpetrators are rarely severe.  Corruption corrodes the government’s ability to address 
illicit drugs, as bribed public servants may facilitate movement of contraband or otherwise 
interfere with the arrest and prosecution of suspects.      
 
C.  National Goals, Bilateral Cooperation, and U.S. Policy Initiatives   
 
The United States remains strongly committed to a comprehensive approach to drug control 
assistance in Pakistan.  U.S. supply reduction assistance builds Pakistani capacity to interdict 
drug shipments and dismantle criminal organizations.  The United States strives to help all 
relevant Pakistani law enforcement entities develop their capacity to conduct sophisticated 
operations, such as controlled deliveries, financial crime investigations, and container 
profiling.  To effectively counter illicit drug trafficking and transnational organized crime, the 
United States aims to help Pakistan cultivate a model for collaborative, intelligence-driven, and 
corruption-free law enforcement by facilitating interagency, cross border, and international 
coordination.  The United States also provides alternative means for farmers to grow licit crops 


INCSR 2018 Volume 1  
 
 
 
 
Country Reports 
240 
 
instead of poppy, including the distribution of seeds, the construction of small roads, and 
alternative livelihood irrigation projects.   
   
Over the past five years, U.S. supply reduction assistance has mainly funded poppy reduction 
programs and ANF interdiction activities.  In 2017, bilateral cooperation on interdiction 
programs between the United States and Pakistan shifted to a more strategic framework, 
including monthly assessment meetings and cross-border training with Afghan counterparts.  To 
promote an effective and self-sustaining interdiction capability, the United States continues to 
work on strengthening and diversifying cooperation with ANF, Pakistani Customs, and other law 
enforcement agencies with a drug control mandate. 
   
To support demand reduction and recovery efforts, the United States funds various drug 
treatment and practitioner training programs.  In 2017, the U.S. government continued its 
assistance to NGOs operating free-of-charge drug treatment centers and prevention activities, 
prioritizing the funding of projects benefitting women and children, and providing training for 
drug treatment professionals to improve evidence-based protocols.  Working with the Colombo 
Plan and UNODC, the U.S. government funded 411 drug awareness campaigns, reaching over 
49,000 people throughout Pakistan, and provided free of cost residential treatment for 866 
patients with substance use disorders, including 64 women and 245 adolescents.  In 2018, 
planned U.S. assistance will facilitate a greater focus on scientific-based approaches to treatment 
and prevention and increased capacity-building and utilization of provincial-level institutions, 
particularly in the health, social-welfare, and education sectors. 
 
D.  Conclusion 
 
Although Pakistan continues to face enormous economic and security challenges that often 
supersede drug trafficking in national security priorities, the challenges posed by transnational 
organized crime are interconnected with the country’s security and stability.  By utilizing the 
existing Inter-Agency Task Force and encouraging greater information sharing among its law 
enforcement and military entities, Pakistan could more effectively reduce drug trafficking and 
encourage its law enforcement agencies to coordinate engagement, share information more 
readily, and expend limited resources more efficiently.  This would also combat the nexus 
between drug trafficking and transnational organized crime, including funding of terrorist 
networks.  Increased public awareness about the drug trade and its negative societal influences 
would further solidify concerted government action across law enforcement agencies.  Similarly, 
greater mobilization of provincial institutions could provide an important multiplier effect for 
interdiction, prevention, and service-delivery, in the context of increasing risk and insufficient 
public funds.

Panama 
 
A.  Introduction  
 
With cocaine production more than doubling in neighboring Colombia since 2013, Panama has 
witnessed an increased flow of illicit drugs through its land borders and territorial waters.   
 
Although Panama is not a major source country of illicit drugs, transnational criminal 
organizations, principally Colombian and Mexican groups, move drugs and other contraband 
through Panama’s remote Darien jungle region as well as its coastal areas.  Panama is a global 
transit hub, and its canal and robust transportation infrastructure are exploited by drug traffickers 
to smuggle cocaine to the United States and across the globe.  Although Panama does not suffer 
from extensive domestic drug consumption, the flow of drugs from Colombia presents an 
increased risk for domestic drug abuse as local traffickers are more frequently paid with product 
instead of cash.   
 
Despite these challenges, Panama is an emerging regional leader in the fight against the 
international drug trade and transnational criminal organizations.  Panama is a regional, strategic 
ally and a committed partner for U.S. interdiction and drug control efforts.  The United States 
enjoys strong partnerships with all of Panama’s security services, which demonstrate increasing 
resolve and capacity to confront drug trafficking.  In 2017, the U.S. and Panama established a 
bilateral High-Level Security Dialogue to address the commitments by both countries to confront 
transnational drug trafficking organizations.   
 
B.  Drug Control Accomplishments, Policies, and Trends  
 
1. Institutional Developments  
 
Panama significantly strengthened its drug interdiction efforts in 2017.  At the same time, U.S. 
assistance to Panama in the areas of training, operational capacity enhancement, and support for 
vetted units led to better interagency coordination, more arrests, and record-level drug seizures.  
Panama is increasingly capable of conducting operations against transnational criminal 
organizations and proactively targeting drug trafficking.    
 
With the support of U.S.-provided aviation assets and training, Panama’s Coast Guard (SENAN) 
is developing the cadre of pilots necessary for future counter-narcotic air operations.  The steady 
development of SENAN’s aviation program also directly supports the operations of Panama’s 
border force (SENAFRONT), allowing for an extended presence in remote parts of the Darién 
jungle – a traditional haven for drug smugglers.  In 2017, SENAFRONT used U.S. aviation 
support to expand its operations against drug trafficking, establishing two new border outposts 
on the Panama/Colombia border to deter drug trafficking and other transnational threats.  This 
increased presence in the Darién allowed SENAFRONT to expand the number, scope, and 
complexity of operations in 2017 to combat drug trafficking in the jungle region.  
 
Panama continues to improve training for its National Police (PNP) and security forces with its 
National Security University (NSU).  In 2017, Panama continued integrating training for all of its 


INCSR 2018 Volume 1  
 
 
 
 
Country Reports 
242 
 
security forces into this single institution.  The NSU also made progress on obtaining 
international certification which will improve professionalization, recruiting, and retention for all 
of the services while providing a shared baseline experience to promote joint operations.  
Panama’s professional security forces training practices is a best practice in the region, and the 
country is becoming a regional hub for training.   
 
Panama’s significant reduction of homicides in 2017 was attributed to its adoption of an U.S.-
style “intelligence-led policing” model.  Panama uses COMPSTAT (comparative statistics) to 
better understand crime trends, and in 2017, implemented the U.S.-style “Real-Time Crime 
Centers” (RTCC) model nationwide.  New policies within the PNP ensure the proper use of both 
data systems across all of Panama’s police districts.  While some challenges remain, the centers 
are operational and cement a major U.S.-backed effort to reduce violent crime in Panama.  The 
centers have already yielded results against gangs and drug trafficking.   Four other Central 
America countries are considering similar centers. 
 
September 2017 marked the first anniversary of Panama’s nationwide implementation of the 
accusatory justice system.  This reform changed how criminals are prosecuted, making it more 
like the U.S. system with witness testimony, cross examination, and plea bargaining.  The United 
States continues to support the transition through training judges, prosecutors, forensic analysts, 
and investigators.  Despite its progress, Panama still has difficulty pursuing cases involving 
money laundering, organized crime, complex financial crimes, and criminal forfeiture, and 
Panamanian officials remain susceptible to corruption.  Numerous arrests in drug cases still 
produce too few successful prosecutions of high-level leaders of drug trafficking organizations.   
 
The United States and Panama are parties to a mutual legal assistance treaty and an extradition 
treaty, but Panama’s constitution does not permit extradition of Panamanian nationals.  The 2002 
Salas-Becker Agreement enables cooperation on bilateral maritime interdiction.  This includes 
the use of “ship-riders,” allowing Panamanian security officers to go aboard U.S. air and 
maritime assets.  In 2017, Panama and the United States conducted training to enhance the 
effectiveness of the agreement and counter-trafficking operations by improving detection, 
monitoring, interdiction, and apprehension of traffickers.   
 
Panama’s Ministry of Public Security budget increased in 2017 for the ninth consecutive year.  
However, its security institutions continue to face challenges involving inter-agency cooperation, 
effective management of their procurement processes, and limited budget resources.  Panama’s 
security forces are often hampered by their inability to pay for basic costs associated with core 
security and drug enforcement missions.    
 
 
2.  Supply Reduction  
 
Panama seized approximately 42 metric tons (MT) of illicit drugs during the first nine months of 
2017, reflecting the increasing ability of Panama’s security services to act on operational 
intelligence.  With U.S. assistance, SENAN routinely interdicted drug traffickers at sea.  The 
United States partners with Colombia’s Navy to help SENAN develop its maintenance and 
operational capacities.  In 2017, the United States provided training and equipment for SENAN 
that enabled it to successfully interdict more illicit drugs.  The United States and Panama 


INCSR 2018 Volume 1  
 
 
 
 
Country Reports 
243 
 
continue exploring options for Panama to obtain maritime patrol aircraft (MPA) to increase the 
effectiveness of maritime interdiction.  When cued by MPA or intelligence from the U.S. Joint 
Interagency Task Force South (JIATF-S), SENAN acted upon 90 percent of reports and 
interdicted 80 percent of targeted vessels.  During the first nine months of 2017, SENAN 
successfully conducted 63 maritime drug interdictions and seized more than 19.7 MT of drugs.   
 
U.S. and Panamanian law enforcement units collaborate closely on drug trafficking, which, in 
2017, included several high-profile investigations involving a nexus to U.S. cases.  Panamanian 
units vetted by the U.S. government and working in partnership with U.S. law enforcement 
agencies conducted sensitive investigations and operations related to drug trafficking, money 
laundering, migrant smuggling, and other transnational crimes.  Between January and mid-
October 2017, investigations and operations by these vetted units resulted in 310 arrests and the 
seizure of over 12.5 MT of cocaine and 2.3 MT of marijuana, $2.25 million in cash, and 
counterfeit items with a street value of approximately $8.5 million.  These figures represent a 
marked increase over 2016, demonstrating significant progress. 
 
 
3.  Public Information, Prevention, and Treatment  
 
Unlike some other Central American countries, Panama has not seen high levels of drug usage or 
gang activity from international groups like MS-13.  However, local gangs are involved in 
criminal activity, particularly in the Caribbean port city of Colón, and Panamanian officials have 
expressed concerned that instability in nearby countries could lead to increased drug usage and 
gang activity in Panama.  The increased flow of drugs from Colombia presents the greatest 
consumption risk within Panama, as local traffickers are increasingly paid with product in lieu of 
cash. 
 
Panama funds some drug demand reduction programs in schools and the Ministry of Health 
supports a drug-counseling program.  The United States, in collaboration with NGOs, funds drug 
treatment and prevention training for treatment service professionals in Panama.  The United 
States continues to partner with the PNP and SENAFRONT to implement programs such as 
Drug Awareness and Resistance Education (DARE), the Gang Resistance Education and 
Training program (GREAT), and the Community Policing Strategy to help at-risk youth.  
Panama has not conducted a drug-demand study since 2008 and has not updated its published 
strategy on drug demand reduction since 2007, making it difficult to assess current trends.   
 
The Government of Panama has not reported significant problems associated with synthetic drug 
use, though synthetics have reached the streets of Panama and government officials have 
expressed concern.   
 
 
4.  Corruption  
 
The Government of Panama does not, as a matter of government policy, encourage or facilitate 
illicit drug production or distribution, nor is it involved in laundering the proceeds of the sale of 
illicit drugs.  However, transnational criminal organizations target the security services, customs, 
and justice sector to facilitate drug trafficking, and as a result, official corruption at all levels 
remains a concern.  Panamanian authorities recognize the threat and actively investigate officials 


INCSR 2018 Volume 1  
 
 
 
 
Country Reports 
244 
 
for corruption.  As a sign of progress, investigations, arrests, and prosecutions of officials and 
members of the security forces increased in 2017.  Additionally, in 2017 SENAN began 
establishing an internal affairs unit to monitor its own ranks for signs of corruption.   Panama 
will need to continue to institutionalize these aggressive steps to reduce the threat of drug 
trafficking-fueled corruption.   
 
C.  National Goals, Bilateral Cooperation, and U.S. Policy Initiatives  
 
The United States supports citizen security, law enforcement, and rule-of-law programs in 
Panama to expand Panamanian capabilities to interdict, investigate, and prosecute illegal drug 
trafficking, money laundering, and other transnational crimes while strengthening Panama’s 
justice sector.  The United States maintains a binding operational agreement with Panama to 
suppress illicit traffic by sea, which includes ship boarding and expedited communications. 
 
In 2017, the United States continued to provide assistance to modernize and maintain SENAN, 
SENAFRONT, and PNP vessels, equipment, and facilities in support of interdiction efforts in 
2017.  U.S.-provided aviation assets have helped SENAN expand its ability to support joint drug 
enforcement operations.  The United States supports trilateral cooperation with Panama and 
Colombia, whereby Colombian law enforcement, justice sector, and military experts train their 
Panamanian counterparts.    
 
In March 2017, the United States and Panama, together with Costa Rica and Colombia, executed 
Operation Kraken, a month-long multinational surge of drug interdiction operations with 
enhanced joint and combined efforts among the participating nations.  The operation served as a 
proof of concept on the efficacy of MPA in Panama’s littoral waters, resulting in increased 
seizures and arrests, while simultaneously demonstrating Panama’s ability to collaborate and 
coordinate with the United States on high-intensity operations.  Panama’s performance also 
underscored the need for Panama to acquire its own MPA capable of detecting drug trafficking 
vessels far off the country’s coast.  The commitment and competency demonstrated by Panama’s 
security forces lays an important foundation for future combined efforts.  Kraken also infused a 
sense of confidence in Panama’s security forces that has led them to develop increasingly 
assertive and complex operations to disrupt the transnational criminal organizations that threaten 
the U.S. homeland. 
 
In 2017, in order to fortify strong bilateral cooperation and ensure implementation of the shared 
security agenda efficiently, expeditiously, and consistently, the United States and Panama 
established the High Level Security Dialogue (HLSD).  While Panama’s government has been a 
faithful and eager partner, its bureaucracy often lacks authority to advance reforms without 
executive-level guidance.  The HLSD allows Panama and the United States to consolidate a 
shared strategic vision for strengthening combined counternarcotic operations. 
 
D.  Conclusion  
 
Panama has established itself as a regional leader in drug interdiction and seizures, and a regional 
strategic ally in the global effort to fight transnational criminal organizations and the flow of 
drugs into the United States.  2017 witnessed a significant improvement in Panama’s capabilities 


INCSR 2018 Volume 1

and its aggressiveness in fighting the drug trade.  Nevertheless, the increasing volume of drug 
trafficking through and around Panama exceeds its security services capacity to manage the 
challenge alone.   
 
While Panama is laying the groundwork for systemic improvements, lingering bureaucratic and 
institutional incapacities hinder its ability to dismantle and prosecute transnational criminal 
organizations.  The United States continues to support Panama’s implementation of systemic 
reforms and is committed to working with all Panamanian security services to encourage 
stronger and more organized support for drug control efforts.

Paraguay 
 
Paraguay made significant increases in drug seizures and illicit crop eradication in 2017.  
Nevertheless, Paraguay remains among the largest source countries for marijuana in the Western 
Hemisphere, and a transit country for Andean cocaine.  Traffickers exploit the country’s porous 
land borders, clandestine airstrips, lack of air radar, extensive internal waterways, and under-
resourced, often corrupt law enforcement and judicial officials to transit cocaine, mainly to 
Brazil and through Brazil to overseas markets, though rarely the United States.  Transnational 
criminal organizations engage in drug trafficking and other illicit activities, aided by corruption 
and legal impunity, including ongoing allegations of senior-level government involvement. 
 
During the first nine months of 2017, the National Anti-Drug Secretariat (SENAD) seized and 
destroyed 996 metric tons (MT) of processed marijuana (compared to 276 in all of 2016) and 1.2 
MT of cocaine (compared to 1.57 in all of 2016) and eradicated 1,343 hectares (ha) of cannabis 
(compared to 1,298 ha in all of 2016).  Also during the first nine months of 2017, the Paraguayan 
National Police (PNP) seized and destroyed 350.5 MT of processed marijuana (compared to 
137.6 in all of 2016), eradicated 794 ha of cannabis (compared to 413 in all of 2016) and seized 
91 kilograms of cocaine (compared to 19 in all of 2016).  Authorities uncovered and destroyed 
two marijuana and two cocaine clandestine drug laboratories.  Internationally, two of Germany’s 
largest-ever cocaine seizures (1.5 MT in March and 1.6 MT in April) were hidden in shipping 
containers originating from Paraguay.  In December, Paraguayan authorities, with U.S. and 
Brazilian assistance, arrested Brazil's most wanted alleged drug trafficker. 
 
The United States and Paraguay are parties to a 2001 extradition treaty that remains in force.  
There is no bilateral mutual legal assistance treaty, though both countries are party to multilateral 
conventions providing for cooperation in criminal matters.  In October, Paraguayan President 
Cartes issued a decree approving a national drug policy that was drafted in 2016 with assistance 
from the UN Office on Drugs and Crime. 
 
Drug treatment specialists report an increase in domestic drug consumption.  Paraguay 
conducted its last national study on drug use in 2014.  Outpatient community-based drug 
treatment programs, supported by the United States and other donors, supplement the Ministry of 
Health’s single 27-bed inpatient detoxification facility.  Paraguay’s new asset forfeiture 
legislation, signed in September, allocates 50 percent of proceeds to demand reduction and crime 
prevention efforts.  
 
U.S. law enforcement cooperation continues to help facilitate drug seizures, arrests, and the 
presentation of cases for prosecution by Paraguayan authorities.  Increased efforts by the 
Government of Paraguay to enhance interagency coordination, improve the judicial system’s 
ability to prosecute cases quickly and effectively, and reduce corruption would help further deter 
narcotics production and trafficking.

Peru 
 
A.  Introduction 
 
Peru remained the second-largest producer of cocaine and cultivator of coca in 2016, the most 
recent year for which data is available, with an estimated 44,000 hectares (ha) of coca under 
cultivation.  Peruvian cocaine is transported to South American countries for domestic 
consumption or for onward shipment to Europe, East Asia, Mexico, and the United States.  Peru 
is a major importer of precursor chemicals used for cocaine production.  President Pedro Pablo 
Kuczynski’s administration released Peru’s 2017-2021 drug control strategy in May 2017.  
Peru’s coca eradication organization (CORAH) eradicated 20,735 ha of coca during the first 10 
months of 2017.  The Ministry of Defense maintained authority of the Valley of the Rivers 
Apurimac, Ene, and Mantaro (VRAEM)’s emergency zone.  The military and the Peruvian 
National Police (PNP) anti-drug unit, DIREJANDRO, conducted autonomous and joint drug 
enforcement operations in the VRAEM.  Sendero Luminoso (Shining Path) continues to operate 
in the VRAEM and relies on cocaine trafficking for funding.  The group killed four military 
personnel and 17 police officers in 2017.  Domestic consumption of illicit drugs is growing, 
particularly in major coastal cities and mid-sized cities east of the Andes where drug production 
occurs.  Additional drug rehabilitation centers are needed to treat the estimated 200,000 illicit 
substance abusers. 
 
B.  Drug Control Accomplishments, Policies, and Trends 
 
 
1.  Institutional Development 
 
The Peruvian government’s drug control strategy includes goals for eradication, interdiction, and 
alternative development.  It also addresses associated issues such as the control of precursor 
chemicals, organized crime, money laundering, and the rule of law.  The Kuczynski 
administration released Peru’s 2017-2021 drug control strategy in May, and dedicated $214 
million toward implementation in 2017, a $3 million increase over 2016.  Peru contributed $21.2 
million toward eradication efforts and concomitant aviation support, $1.3 million more than the 
2016 contribution.   
 
A 2015 law authorized the Peruvian Air Force to conduct intercepts of suspicious aircraft 
entering Peruvian airspace without appropriate flight clearance authorization.  The law is in 
effect and includes a ‘last resort’ measure that allows for lethal intercepts in the case of non-
compliance.  However, both U.S. and international law prohibit using lethal force against civil 
aircraft, regardless of whether the aircraft is being used for drug trafficking.  
 
Peru approved the National Anti-Money Laundering and Terrorist Financing policy in 
September, which charges government entities with implementing policies to prevent, detect, and 
sanction money laundering and terrorist financing.  In December 2017, the Ministry of Justice’s 
(MOJ) Anti-Money Laundering and Terrorist Finance Working Group planned to issue the 
National Plan Against Money Laundering and Terrorist Financing; however, government entities 
will not receive additional funding for implementation.  The former National Commission for 


INCSR 2018 Volume 1  
 
 
 
 
Country Reports 
248 
 
Seized Assets (CONABI) was relaunched as a national program (PRONABI) under the MOJ in 
May. 
 
The MOJ announced it intends to complete implementation of the New Criminal Procedure Code 
(NCPC), which transitions the legal system from an inquisitorial to an accusatory system, by July 
2020.  In 2017, 29 out of 33 districts were operating under the NCPC, with 16 districts operating 
exclusively under the new system.  All districts are required to adjudicate corruption and 
organized crime cases under the NCPC.  Four districts in Lima, handling approximately 40 
percent of the national caseload, have not yet implemented the NCPC.   
 
Peru and the United States have an international bilateral extradition treaty.  
Drug control authorities have observed the presence of synthetic cannabinoids entering Peru 
from the country’s northern border with Ecuador.  The drug is produced in Colombia and 
trafficked through Ecuador and Peru for distribution in Chile.    
 
 
2.  Supply Reduction 
 
The U.S. government estimates that 44,000 ha of coca were under cultivation in Peru in 2016, a 
16 percent decrease from the 2015 estimate of 53,000 ha.  The U.S. 2016 estimate for potential 
pure cocaine production remained steady at 410 metric tons (MT) due to coca yield and maturity. 
 
In 2017, CORAH conducted eradication operations in Peru’s Ucayali, Pasco, Huanuco, and 
Loreto regions.  Peru eradicated 20,735 ha through the first 10 months of 2017, completing 83 
percent of its annual goal of 25,000 ha.  The GOP began working on an integrated alternative 
development plan for the VRAEM, a region accounting for an estimated 65 percent of Peru’s 
total potential pure cocaine production. 
 
DIREJANDRO received a $12.3 million budget in 2017.  During the first 10 months of 2017, 
this unit seized 31.7 MT of cocaine product, including 11.5 MT of cocaine base and 20 MT of 
cocaine hydrochloride.  It also seized 12.2 MT of marijuana, destroyed 308 cocaine laboratories, 
and seized 92.5 MT of coca leaf. 
 
The movement of cocaine by small aircraft from Peru remains a threat; however, the number of 
illicit drug flights remained constant in 2017.  Illicit flights continue to originate from the areas 
of Ciudad Constitucion and the Junin-Huancavelica border zone.  Large cocaine seizures 
continue to occur in source zone areas and the coastal, northern border between Peru and 
Ecuador.  Law enforcement confiscated one aircraft in 2017.  The police and military continued 
to destroy clandestine runways – 78 runways as of October 31, 2017, compared to 74 runways 
during all of 2016. 
 
Peruvian, Colombian, Mexican, and Eastern European traffickers maintain sophisticated 
networks within Peru to ship cocaine to Europe, East Asia, Mexico, the Caribbean, the United 
States, and other Western Hemispheric countries.  Peru and the United States undertake joint 
maritime operations that permit U.S. authorities to board Peruvian flagged vessels in 
international waters.  In joint investigations with U.S. law enforcement, DIREJANDRO 


INCSR 2018 Volume 1  
 
 
 
 
Country Reports 
249 
 
identified and disrupted major international cocaine trafficking organizations using maritime and 
air conveyances to ship cocaine for export. 
 
During the first 10 months of 2017, officials at Lima’s Jorge Chavez International Airport seized 
800 kilograms (kg) of cocaine.  Joint PNP and Customs operations at the Port of Callao led to the 
seizure of approximately 3.69 MT of cocaine.  Cusco International Airport officials seized 12.98 
kg of cocaine. 
 
Several PNP investigations resulted in the seizure of financial assets.  One case resulted in the 
seizure of $65 million from an organization tied to corruption, money laundering, and drug 
trafficking.  In a second case, the PNP seized $15 million in assets from a drug trafficking 
organization responsible for smuggling 100 kg of cocaine through the Port of Callao.  In another 
case, the PNP seized $4 million in aircraft and vehicles linked to the incarcerated former 
Governor of Ucayali. 
 
 
3.  Public Information, Prevention, and Treatment 
 
Peru’s anti-drug agency (DEVIDA) estimates there are approximately 200,000 persons addicted 
to illicit substances nationwide: 60,000 cocaine users, 130,000 marijuana users, and 10,000 users 
of other illicit substances.  Abuse of inexpensive, highly addictive coca paste is increasing.  Drug 
abuse is increasing, particularly along drug trafficking routes in midsized cities east of the Andes 
and in transit cities along the coast. 
 
DEVIDA’s budget for drug abuse prevention increased from $14.9 million in 2016 to $15.2 
million in 2017.  DEVIDA operates a drug counseling services hotline and a prevention program 
for parents and children aged 10-14. 
 
Public treatment facilities in Peru remain insufficient, providing only 160 beds for persons with 
substance use disorders.  Fewer than 10 percent of women addicted to drugs seek and receive 
drug treatment.  Peruvian mental health hospitals added five additional beds for inpatient drug 
treatment services for women, bringing the total number of beds for women to 20 nationwide.  
DEVIDA and the Ministry of Health operate 180 mental health and drug services facilities.  Peru 
has approximately 400 privately-run therapeutic community centers, but only 24 meet public 
health legal standards.  In 2017, the Ministry of Health opened three community mental health 
centers, bringing the national total to 32.  Of Peru’s 66 prisons nationwide, few offer inmate 
treatment programs. 
 
 
4.  Corruption 
 
The Government of Peru does not encourage or facilitate the illicit production or distribution of 
drugs or other controlled substances, or the laundering of proceeds from illegal drug transactions.  
Corruption is widespread, however, eroding faith in Peru’s institutions and damaging Peru’s 
generally positive investment climate.  According to September 2017 polling, Peruvians view 
security and corruption as the country’s most pressing problems, and listed the Judiciary, 
Congress, and the PNP as the country’s most corrupt institutions.  Corruption scandals have 


INCSR 2018 Volume 1  
 
 
 
 
Country Reports 
250 
 
ensnarled many of Peru’s political figures, including former Presidents, members of Congress, 
regional governors, and ministry officials.   
 
The National Anti-Corruption Court launched in March.  Peru’s High-level Anti-corruption 
Commission (CAN) issued the National Integrity and Anti-Corruption Policy in September, 
setting guidelines and standards for all entities in the public sector, private sector, and civil 
society.  The CAN issued the National Plan on Integrity and Combating Corruption (2017-2021) 
in November. 
 
C.  National Goals, Bilateral Cooperation, and U.S. Policy Initiatives 
 
The United States funds projects to support Peru’s drug control strategy through training, 
technical assistance, capacity building, intelligence, and the targeted provision of equipment to 
the Peruvian government and through international organizations and non-governmental 
implementers. 
 
The United States and Peru jointly finance manual coca eradication and alternative development 
(AD) efforts.  The United States provides aviation support to eradication and interdiction 
activities.  While Peru has not made the decision to commence eradication operations in the 
VRAEM, the PNP has increased interdiction operations there.  
 
In communities where AD followed eradication, coca cultivation dropped by 90 percent 
according to 2015 UNODC data.  To reduce dependence on illicit coca cultivation, the United 
States partners with Peru to implement AD projects.  With U.S. technical and institutional 
assistance, DEVIDA invested approximately $32 million in 2016 towards AD.  U.S.-supported 
efforts created over 20,700 new jobs in 2016, assisted over 37,500 families, and planted 9,179 
new ha of cacao and coffee.  
 
U.S. support to the PNP helped to enhance law enforcement capabilities and support citizen 
security.  Interdiction programs increased seizures of illicit drugs and precursor chemicals, 
disrupting the flow of illegal substances leaving Peru via commercial and non-commercial 
routes.  The U.S.-supported Model Police Station program in Callao’s Juan Ingunza precinct, 
focusing on community policing, led to a 12 percent reduction in crime in the district. 
 
U.S. assistance helped Peruvian Customs launch a Tactical Command Center and Immigration 
Intelligence Unit at Jorge Chavez International Airport in 2017 to modernize customs and 
immigration practices.  The program implemented the Automated Targeting System-Global, 
began the Biometrics Identification Transnational Migration Alert Program (BITMAP), and 
funded multiple trainings on drug concealment methods, impostor detection, fraudulent 
documents, cybercrimes, and passenger risk analysis. 
 
The United States continued to support Peru’s transition to the accusatory system by providing 
training to judicial operators and judges.  The United States also provided specialized training 
and study tours on anti-corruption. 
 


INCSR 2018 Volume 1  
 
 
 
 
Country Reports 
251 
 
To support treatment and recovery for persons suffering from drug addiction, the United States 
sponsored the Guiding the Recovery of Women (GROW) training program to certify trainers on 
specialized drug treatment for female patients.  In total, 840 healthcare professionals have 
received GROW training.   
 
The United States provided assistance to the Public Ministry’s specialized unit on environmental 
crimes to strengthen their investigations into transnational criminal organizations’ involvement in 
illegal mining and illegal logging.  The United States supported the launch of the Public 
Ministry’s Office of Strategic Criminal Analysis, which commenced operations in November.  
The office will include one financial crimes analyst.   
 
D.  Conclusion 
 
The Kuczynski government demonstrates the political will to address drug production and 
trafficking, including eradication and interdiction programs.  Peru increased resources to treat 
those addicted to illegal drugs.  The U.S. partnership with Peru to implement its drug control 
strategy remains critical in combating the production and trafficking of illicit drugs.

Philippines 
 
A.  Introduction 
  
Following the May 2016 election of President Rodrigo Duterte, the Philippine Government has 
prioritized the fight against illicit drugs.  This campaign has involved every law enforcement 
agency and multiple other government agencies in efforts to carry out supply and demand 
reduction programming.  There has been controversy over the conduct of the campaign, with 
accusations of vigilante killings and “extra-judicial killings” allegedly conducted by law 
enforcement, coupled with denials from Philippine government officials.  The Philippine 
Government now estimates approximately 4.7 million people are involved in the use and 
trafficking of illicit drugs.   
 
Use of “shabu,” the street name for methamphetamine, continues to grow and addiction to 
methamphetamine remains the most significant drug problem in the Philippines.  Marijuana is 
the second most widely used drug and there is limited but growing cannabis cultivation within 
the Philippines, mostly for local consumption.  Inhalants are the third most abused controlled 
substance according to the Dangerous Drug Board (DDB).  Cocaine is rare in the Philippines, 
due to high prices and limited demand, but club drugs, such as MDMA (ecstasy) and controlled 
pharmaceuticals, have become more prevalent.  Systemic poverty, public corruption, and porous 
borders create an environment where drug trafficking is very lucrative, with a relatively low risk 
of successful interdiction or prosecution.  Transnational organized criminal organizations have 
established operational elements throughout the urban areas of the Philippines.  The Philippine 
Drug Enforcement Agency (PDEA) claimed that 24,848 of 42,036 villages or barangays in the 
country reported drug-related crimes during the first 10 months of 2017. 
 
The Philippines is a regional transit route for drug trafficking and remains a destination for 
diverted chemicals used in the production of methamphetamine due to weak chemical controls 
and a lack of port security.  The primary source country for these methamphetamine precursors is 
China. 
 
B.  Drug Control Accomplishments, Policies, and Trends 
  
 
1.  Institutional Development 
  
Philippine law enforcement and justice sector agencies lack sufficient resources, personnel, and 
effective tools to identify, investigate, and prosecute members of transnational drug trafficking 
organizations.  Restrictions imposed by the Anti-Wiretapping Act of 1965 continue to bar the use 
of judicially authorized interception of criminal communications.  Legal constraints prevent plea 
bargaining, and drug-related asset forfeiture laws are rarely used.  Many drug-related cases are 
dismissed for failure to follow the strict evidentiary procedures in the Comprehensive Dangerous 
Drugs Act of 2002.  Despite the ongoing anti-drug campaign and the potential for reform, 
prosecution and adjudication of drug-related cases continue to face significant procedural and 
administrative delays.   
 


INCSR 2018 Volume 1  
 
 
 
 
Country Reports 
253 
 
Responsibility for the drug campaign has alternated between PDEA and the Philippine National 
Police (PNP).  On March 6, Executive Order 15 created the Inter-Agency Committee on Anti-
Illegal Drugs (ICAD).  Chaired by PDEA, ICAD is a collection of 20 member agencies divided 
into four categories:  environment; justice; advocacy; and rehabilitation and reintegration.  On 
October 10, President Duterte issued an interagency memorandum designating PDEA as the 
“sole agency” for conducting operations in the government’s war on drugs, shifting 
responsibility for the drug campaign from PNP to PDEA over concerns of corruption within the 
PNP.  On December 5, President Duterte lifted the suspension on PNP involvement, directing 
them to support PDEA’s counterdrug operations.   
 
The Philippines has extradition and mutual legal assistance treaties with the United States, and 
regularly coordinates extradition and mutual legal assistance requests with the United States.  
Cooperation is excellent, although bureaucratic procedures slow execution of the requests.   
 
 
2.  Supply Reduction 
  
During the first 10 months of 2017, PDEA conducted 34,744 drug enforcement operations.  This 
included dismantling two clandestine methamphetamine laboratories, one drug storage 
warehouse, and several cannabis cultivation facilities.  These operations resulted in PDEA filing 
17,776 cases and arresting 66,672 individuals.   
 
The Philippines produces and consumes cannabis, with cultivation occurring primarily in the 
remote, mountainous regions of Luzon and Mindanao.  During the first nine months of 2017, 
PDEA reported the seizure of approximately 464.3 kilograms (kg) of cannabis products; 948.2 
kg of methamphetamine; 8.7 kg of cocaine; 275 MDMA tablets; and trace amounts of ephedrine, 
a precursor chemical that can be used to produce methamphetamine.  PDEA completed six 
marijuana interdiction operations, which resulted in the seizure of marijuana valued at $534,000. 
 
While significant amounts of high purity methamphetamine originating in Mexico were seized in 
2017, China remains the primary source of methamphetamine bulk shipments trafficked into the 
Philippines via cargo ships and fishing vessels largely controlled by Chinese organized criminal 
groups.  Philippine law enforcement agencies continue to monitor the potential presence of Latin 
American drug trafficking groups in the country. 
 
Drugs are also smuggled into the country by drug couriers exploiting international flights to the 
Philippines, both as a method for importing drugs into the country and for transshipment 
elsewhere.  Philippine law enforcement agencies note an increasing number of West African 
drug syndicates smuggling methamphetamine and cocaine into the Philippines for transshipment 
and distribution throughout Southeast Asia.  
 
U.S. assistance has supported the development of PDEA’s Airport Inter-Agency Drug 
Interdiction Task Group (AIDITG).  The AIDITG promotes interagency coordination to address 
transnational threats by bringing together officials from PDEA, the PNP, the National Bureau of 
Investigation, the Bureau of Customs, and Bureau of Immigration at the three largest 
international airports.  AIDITG was responsible for several drug courier arrests and the 
interdiction of multiple parcels containing drug shipments during 2017.

3.  Public Information, Prevention, and Treatment 
  
The DDB is developing comprehensive and integrated national drug abuse prevention and 
control programs.  Along with its partner agencies, DDB continues to formulate policies on drug 
prevention and control; develop and implement preventive education programs; adopt and utilize 
effective treatment and rehabilitation programs; and conduct research on vital aspects of the drug 
abuse problem.   
 
The DDB’s preventive education, training, and information division implements programs aimed 
at increasing public awareness on substance use disorder.  In 2017, the DDB initiated drug 
demand reduction programs through partnerships with international development donors.  PDEA 
also launched a preventive education and community involvement service to implement the 
agency’s drug prevention campaign and community involvement initiatives.  Activities include 
seminars, photo exhibits, and conferences on preventive drug education in partnership with 14 
accredited non-governmental organization partner agencies.  
 
The Department of Health (DOH) is establishing in-patient drug treatment centers, including 
infrastructure and health care professional training.  Additionally, DOH is developing an 
outpatient drug treatment program, which includes a voluntary, community-based treatment 
model to be piloted in six facilities at the local government unit level. 
 
 
4.  Corruption 
  
From the beginning of the Duterte administration’s drug campaign, numerous politicians have 
been accused of involvement in the drug trade.  PDEA reports that during the first nine months 
of 2017, it arrested numerous high-value targets, including 114 elected officials, government 
employees, and law enforcement officials.  Insufficient resources and judicial mechanisms often 
lead to the dismissal of drug cases due to technicalities associated with the custody and 
disposition of evidence.  Despite the dismissals, a large number of low-level drug cases remain 
active in the system, clogging court dockets and delaying justice for all cases, not just drug 
defendants.   
 
C.  National Goals, Bilateral Cooperation, and U.S. Policy Initiatives 
 
Philippine authorities have eagerly sought to cooperate with foreign governments on 
international drug trafficking investigations, most significantly the United States, the People’s 
Republic of China, the Republic of Korea, and Australia.  The Philippines is also a member of 
various international enforcement organizations, including INTERPOL, the Customs 
Cooperation Council, and the Association of Southeast Asian Nations-Police.  U.S. assistance 
continued to bolster the AIDITG and PDEA airport units by providing both equipment and 
training.   
 
In September, the United States and the Philippines signed an amendment to a bilateral 
agreement to support drug demand reduction efforts in the Philippines.  This amended agreement 
will provide additional funding to develop a comprehensive drug demand reduction program 


INCSR 2018 Volume 1  
 
 
 
 
Country Reports 
255 
 
covering community-based and national capacity-building interventions.  The United States also 
provided drug education kits to PDEA in 2017 to assist in their community outreach and school-
based demand reduction programs. 
 
D.  Conclusion 
  
The Philippine government’s prioritization on reducing drug trafficking and use resulted in a 
surge of enforcement actions in 2017.  However, the capability of Philippine law enforcement 
and criminal justice institutions to prosecute significant drug traffickers successfully remains 
hampered, due to the inability to use judicially authorized intercepts of criminal communications, 
limited use of plea bargaining, and an inefficient drug asset forfeiture system.  Continued U.S.-
Philippine collaboration on drug demand reduction programs has the potential to help develop 
the community-based interventions needed to reduce drug use and lessen the burden on the 
country’s overstretched law enforcement agencies and criminal justice system.

Portugal 
 
Portugal is a transshipment point for illicit drugs originating from South America destined for 
other European countries, but is neither a center of drug production nor a significant source of 
drugs destined for the United States.  Revenues garnered from in the illicit drug trade in Portugal 
are repatriated to drug traffickers in South America.  In addition to direct shipments from South 
America, transnational drug trafficking networks consistently use Portuguese-speaking Guinea-
Bissau and Cabo Verde in West Africa as transshipment, refueling, and storage points for 
cocaine-laden vessels from South America en route to Europe.   
 
The Government of Portugal vigorously investigates and prosecutes drug traffickers traversing 
Portuguese territory.  It also continues to enforce 2013 legislation criminalizing the possession 
and sale of certain analogue chemicals used to produce psychoactive substances.  In 2017, 
Portuguese law enforcement authorities continued to prioritize interdiction efforts targeting 
cocaine trafficking into the country.  In addition to cocaine, MDMA (ecstasy), hashish, and 
heroin remain accessible to users within the country. 
 
Portugal focuses much of its drug control effort on treatment and prevention.  Since 2001, 
“personal use” quantities of drugs have been decriminalized.  Drug possession is still prohibited, 
however, and those individuals found by law enforcement to have personal use amounts are 
referred to the Drug Addiction Dissuasion Commission, consisting of multi-disciplinary teams 
charged with assessing users and deciding the appropriate sanction and referral to educational or 
treatment programs.  The Portuguese Ministry of Health’s Institute on Drugs and Drug Addiction 
operates numerous drug treatment centers.  Universal drug use prevention is part of the 
Portuguese school curriculum.  Law enforcement entities patrol the areas surrounding schools to 
prevent and protect students from drug trafficking, as part of the “Safe Schools” initiative.  Law 
enforcement also participates in community awareness and training activities. 
 
Portugal’s law enforcement cooperation with the United States and other international partners to 
combat drug trafficking continues to be outstanding.  The U.S. Drug Enforcement 
Administration and the Portuguese Judicial Police conducted multiple, successful joint 
investigations throughout 2017. 
 
A customs mutual assistance agreement is in force between Portugal and the United States, as are 
protocols to the 2003 U.S.-EU extradition and mutual legal assistance agreements.  Lisbon is 
also home to the European Monitoring Center for Drugs and Drug Addiction 
(EMCDDA).  Portugal is also a member country of the Maritime Analysis and Operations 
Center-Narcotics (MAOC-N), headquartered in Lisbon.  The United States is a permanent 
observer to MAOC-N.

Russia 
 
Russia remains a major destination country for heroin and other Afghan opiates.  Smuggled 
opiates are primarily trafficked into Russia through Central Asian countries.  Other illicit drugs, 
including cocaine, are typically smuggled in via St. Petersburg and Black Sea ports by drug 
couriers or concealed within maritime shipments originating largely in the Caribbean and South 
America. 
 
The Ministry of Internal Affairs (MVD) and the Federal Security Service (FSB) are Russia’s two 
federal agencies responsible for drug-related investigations.  In an October 2017 press release, 
General Andrei Khrapov, Head of the MVD Main Directorate for Drug Control, reported that 
synthetic drugs have surpassed heroin in the Russian drug market.  The rise in the manufacture, 
trafficking, and use of synthetic drugs, including cathinones, cannabinoids, and synthetic opioids, 
represent a troubling epidemic.  The MVD has reported targeting synthetic drugs sold via the 
internet and restricted internet sites (commonly referred to as the “dark web”), and in September 
2017, they effectively shut down the Russian Anonymous Marketplace, a dark web hub which 
included over 1,300 websites selling illegal drugs.  In 2016, the most recent year for which 
statistics are available, Russian law enforcement seized 21.7 MT of illegal drugs.  Of this total 
amount, 1.4 MT were opiates (including 965 kilograms of heroin); four MT were synthetic 
drugs; 15 MT were cannabis products; and 1.4 MT were psychotropics.   
 
In April 2016, the government disbanded the Federal Narcotics Control Service (FSKN) and 
assigned its functions largely to the MVD, which absorbed many of FSKN’s employees.  The 
Ministries of Health and Labor were slated to assume responsibility for drug user rehabilitation.  
It is not yet known which agency will be responsible for domestic demand reduction.  The MVD 
took over management of statistical information about illicit drugs, but released very little new 
data. 
 
According to multiple sources, drug users in Russia have numbered between 7.3 to 8.5 million 
for the past several years.  At an October 2017 Saint Petersburg conference, experts reported that 
in 2016, there were 637,482 people incarcerated in Russia, for which 63 percent were for drug 
offenses, and 10 percent of whom are HIV positive.  In addition, 54.5 percent of Russian 
narcologists list religion as “the most suitable therapy” for drug addiction, and as a result, drug 
addiction in Russia is typically treated with antipsychotic drugs suited to treat schizophrenia, 
instead of agonist and antagonist agents.  Analysts have also ascribed spotty progress and metrics 
to poor interagency and inter-sectoral cooperation, and to the lack of a cohesive national 
rehabilitation program.   
 
In 2013, Russia terminated its letter of agreement with the United States that funded 
counternarcotic capacity-building programs.  In December 2016,   President Putin appointed 
Vladimir Kolokoltsev, Minister of Internal Affairs, as Chair of the State Anti-Drug Committee 
which coordinates Russia's drug control policy.  The U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration 
currently has working relationships with the FSB and the Federal Customs Service, and to a 
lesser degree with the MVD.

Senegal 
 
Senegal’s location and transportation infrastructure make it a transit point for drug traffickers 
moving illicit drugs into Europe and across West Africa.  Cocaine is trafficked into and through 
Senegal by land and sea from neighboring countries including Guinea-Bissau and Mali, then on 
to Europe by sea and air.  Locally, cannabis is cultivated in the southern Casamance region for 
domestic use and to supply markets across West Africa.  Anecdotal evidence suggests that 
transnational drug trafficking networks are less active in Senegal than in some other West 
African countries due to Senegal’s comparatively stronger enforcement efforts.   
 
In 2017, Senegalese seizures of the Catha Edulis (khat) plant, already slowing in 2016, ceased 
completely.  Seizures of multi-ton quantities of marijuana continued.  The lack of khat seizures is 
likely the result of its low prioritization by Senegalese authorities given the difficulty in 
successfully prosecuting criminal cases.   
 
Senegal’s 1997 Drug Law was amended in 2006 with tougher penalties for drug trafficking.  
Senegal’s latest drug control plan, drafted in 2016 and launched in March 2017, aims to reduce 
the cultivation, production, and trafficking of drugs, as well as to inform the population of the 
dangers of illicit drug use, and the need to rehabilitate persons with substance use disorders.  
While Senegal continues to lack the resources to reliably identify and seize illicit drugs, the 
capabilities and professionalism of Senegalese authorities are slowly improving, particularly 
with assistance from international partners. 
 
Senegal collaborates with partners from the Economic Community of West African States 
(ECOWAS) to combat drug trafficking.  In addition, Senegal participates in regional conferences 
that address prosecuting drug trafficking cases.  For example, in October 2017, Senegal hosted 
the 7th Plenary Meeting of the West African Network of Central Authorities and Prosecutors 
against Organized Crime, sponsored by the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime.  In 2017, 
the United States continued to provide assistance to strengthen the capacities of the Gendarmerie, 
the Marine Nationale, and the Senegalese National Police to monitor, detect, and interdict drug 
traffickers in Senegal’s maritime approaches and territory.  
 
The United States and Senegal do not have a bilateral mutual legal assistance treaty or an 
extradition treaty.  Senegal is a party to multilateral law enforcement conventions that have 
mutual legal assistance provisions. 
 
The Government of Senegal has the political will to fight drug trafficking, but limited 
infrastructure and funding impede its efforts.  Incremental improvement is taking place, but 
continued support from the United States and other international partners remains critical.

Serbia 
 
Serbia is not a significant source or consumer country of illicit drugs but remains a transit area 
for drugs smuggled through its territory to other European markets, including opiates originating 
in Afghanistan and cocaine originating in South America.  Some small clandestine laboratories 
produce synthetic drugs within the country for local use, and cannabis is the most widely used 
illicit drug domestically. 
  
Amphetamine-type stimulants and new psychoactive substances (NPS) are produced in small 
quantities in clandestine labs throughout Serbia (primarily synthetic cannabinoids).  These drugs 
are mainly exported to Western Europe, but also supply a small but growing domestic market.  In 
2017, the authorities investigated and raided the first large clandestine laboratory detected within 
the country used to produce MDMA (ecstasy), seizing 52 kilograms (kg) of tablets and 80 kg of 
raw production materials.  This clandestine laboratory was in Belgrade, and a five member group 
was arrested and charged with the crime of illegal drug production and trafficking.  Fifty hashish 
processing labs, varying from small to large, were raided in 2017.  Cocaine is not widely 
consumed in Serbia due to its high cost, and the volume of cocaine seized during the first half of 
2017 was notably below that of previous years.  While Serbian authorities believe heroin and 
MDMA use is declining within the country, NPS use is believed to be rising.  According to the 
Counter-Narcotics Unit of the Ministry of the Interior (MOI), fentanyl, fentanyl analogues, and 
ketamine have not been detected in Serbia, and precursor chemical diversion through the country 
has not been significant. 
 
Serbia established the MOI Service for Abuse of Drugs and Drug Trafficking in 2014 which is 
responsible for drug-related investigations and addiction prevention programs.  Treatment and 
prevention of drug addiction is mainly the responsibility of the Ministry of Health, but non-
governmental organizations also provide services.  Bigger cities such as Belgrade, Nis, and Novi 
Sad have police units dedicated to curbing the use of illicit drugs and investigating drug-related 
crimes.  Serbian law enforcement has been shifting to a more centralized approach by creating a 
database of criminals and investigations that can be accessed by all 27 departments throughout 
the country.  The MOI plans on standing up new narcotics interdiction and intervention units – 
comprised of counternarcotics police and border police – to better meet operational needs along 
the country’s borders.  
  
The United States provides ongoing assistance to the MOI to support criminal justice capacity 
building.  The Serbian government also seeks to amplify its cooperation with regional partners to 
address drug trafficking throughout the Western Balkans, in line with European Union standards.

South Africa 
 
South Africa is the largest market for illicit drugs in sub-Saharan Africa, and serves as a 
transshipment point for cocaine and heroin primarily destined for Europe.  South American 
cocaine enters South Africa primarily via air to Johannesburg’s O.R. Tambo International 
Airport.  A portion is distributed for local consumption and the remainder is trafficked 
internationally, often controlled by Nigerian criminal organizations.  Heroin, primarily of Afghan 
origin, typically arrives in ports in Tanzania, Kenya, and Mozambique from South West Asia 
before being subsequently smuggled by land into South Africa, often transiting Zambia and 
Botswana.  Heroin not consumed within South Africa is then trafficked via air to Europe, 
although a small percentage is shipped to the United States.  Methamphetamine (known locally 
as “tik”), methcathinone (“cat”), and methaqualone are synthesized from precursor chemicals 
imported primarily from India and China. 
 
Cannabis is the most commonly used illicit drug in South Africa.  A dangerous trend that has 
emerged in poorer communities is the use of a combination of heroin and marijuana called 
“nyaope.”  Such drugs are often adulterated with other substances.  Quantification of domestic 
drug use is difficult.  The South Africa Police Service (SAPS) annual crime statistics indicate 
that drug-related crime continued to rise between April 2016 and March 2017. The stated goals 
of South Africa’s National Drug Master Plan are to “reduce illicit drug supply, demand, and 
harm,” but insufficient resources and limited capacity challenge implementation.  An ongoing 
nationwide anti-crime operation, Operation Fiela, focuses enforcement efforts on geographic 
areas identified as havens of illegal drugs, weapons, and other illegal activities, but has attracted 
controversy for its alleged targeting of foreign nationals.  The nation-wide operation involves 
South African police and military raids, and has resulted in the arrest of an estimated 10,000 
suspects and the seizure of large quantities of weapons and drugs. 
 
South Africa cooperates with international counterparts to increase the impact of its efforts 
against transnational drug trafficking and other forms of crime.  U.S. law enforcement agencies 
effectively coordinate with South African counterparts on investigations and operations, and 
provide training to build capacity.  In 2017, coordinated U.S.-South African operations led to the 
arrests of individuals involved in criminal activity linked to the United States and the 
identification of conspirators in transnational crime syndicates.  South Africa also investigates 
shipments suspected by the United States to contain drugs and other illicit contraband.  U.S.-
sponsored training has helped to strengthen the ability of South Africa’s law enforcement 
agencies to conduct complex criminal investigations and cooperate with international 
counterparts.   
 
The United States and South Africa regularly exchange mutual legal assistance and extradition 
requests under bilateral treaties.

Spain 
 
Spain remains an important transit point in Europe for cocaine originating from South America 
and for hashish from Morocco, especially across the Strait of Gibraltar.  Cocaine arrives in Spain 
in large containerized shipments and in lower-volume shipments via recreational boats, sailboats, 
and within parasitic devices attached to cargo ships.  Spanish law enforcement efforts continued 
to be effective in 2017, combining strong border control and coastal monitoring, sophisticated 
geospatial detection technology, domestic police action, anti-corruption and internal affairs 
investigations, and international cooperation. 
 
The Spanish government is preparing to launch a new national drug strategy for 2017-2024 that 
will focus on prevention, risk reduction, treatment, and supply reduction.  In evaluating 
outcomes from its 2008-2016 strategy, Spanish authorities observed slight reductions in 
experimental and occasional use of cannabis and cocaine by its domestic population. 
 
Domestic drug production is minor, save for localized cannabis cultivation.  There are a small 
number of illegal labs involved in cutting, mixing, and reconstituting cocaine and heroin.  
Transnational criminal organizations frequently ship cocaine in raw form mixed within cargo to 
avoid detection.  In 2016, the most recent year for which data is available, law enforcement 
seizures of cocaine decreased by 28 percent from 2015, totaling 15.63 metric tons (MT).  Heroin 
seizures remained stable at 253 kilograms in 2016.  Hashish seizures declined 14.7 percent to 
324.4 MT.  Seizures of MDMA (ecstasy) increased by more than 150 percent, to 346,848 dosage 
units in 2016.  Marijuana seizures increased by 32 percent to 21.1 MT.   
 
Spain continued to enjoy excellent bilateral and multilateral law enforcement cooperation with 
international partners in 2017.  Cooperation on EU operations in the Mediterranean continued, 
and U.S. law enforcement agencies maintained strong working relationships with Spanish police 
and customs authorities, leading to significant drug seizures and arrests.  For example, in a 
February 2017 joint operation with the U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration targeting 
members of a Colombian drug trafficking organization operating in Spain, the Spanish National 
Police made 24 arrests and seized 2.45 MT of cocaine.  In a May 2017 operation coordinated 
with U.S. law enforcement, a Spanish customs ship interdicted a Venezuelan-flagged ship 800 
nautical miles from Cape Verde, seizing over 2,2 MT of cocaine and arresting seven Venezuelan 
crew members.  In a July 2017 coordinated operation with U.S. Homeland Security 
Investigations, Spanish Customs arrested a Spanish citizen following a successful international 
controlled delivery of a parcel containing approximately 600 grams of cocaine concealed within 
vehicle alternators.

Suriname 
 
A.  Introduction  
 
Suriname is a transit zone for South American cocaine en route to Europe, Africa, and, to a lesser 
extent, the United States.  Cargo containers carry most illicit drugs smuggled through Suriname, 
but smaller fishing vessels also carry drugs out to sea for transfer to larger freighters.  The 2016 
introduction of seasonal direct commercial flights between the United States and Suriname could 
create additional opportunities for drug trafficking.  Suriname’s sparsely populated coastal region 
and isolated jungle interior, together with weak border controls and infrastructure, make illicit 
drug detection and interdiction efforts difficult.  There is little evidence of illicit drug production 
within Suriname.  
 
B.  Drug Control Accomplishments, Policies, and Trends  
 
 
1.  Institutional Development  
 
The Government of Suriname is officially opposed to illicit drug trafficking, but little political 
will has been demonstrated to pursue vigorous enforcement.  Suriname’s practical ability to 
apprehend and prosecute drug traffickers remains inhibited by drug-related corruption, 
bureaucratic hurdles and the lack of financial and material resources.  The Suriname Police Force 
(KPS) is responsible for the detection and combating of drug-related activities with five units 
having specific drug control responsibilities.  The KPS Narcotics Unit investigates and arrests 
individuals involved in trafficking illicit drugs, and the Narcotics Intelligence Unit (NIU) gathers 
intelligence related to illegal drug trafficking.  At the airport, the Combating International Drug 
Trafficking Unit (BID) is a 32-person team that screens airport passengers on outbound flights, 
and there is a police canine unit responsible for inspecting luggage.     
 
In July 2017, the U.S.-funded, UN-sponsored Container Control Unit at the Terminal of Nieuw 
Haven (Port of Paramaribo) assisted Surinamese authorities in detecting and seizing a record of 
1.7 metric tons of cocaine in a shipping container destined for Europe.  The Unit’s operating 
protocol requires permission and oversight of Surinamese Customs authorities. 
   
Suriname installed an automated biometrics border control system for travelers at points of entry 
in 2013 and amended the criminal code to allow DNA as evidence in 2014.  The National 
Assembly approved the “Acquisition and Sentence Transfer Enforcement” law in October 2016.  
This legislation is meant to establish the conditions under which a sentence issued by a foreign 
court would be applied within Suriname, as well as the conditions involved in applying the 
verdicts of Surinamese courts abroad. 
 
Suriname is a party to the Inter-American Convention against Corruption and Migrant 
Smuggling and the Inter-American Convention on Mutual Assistance in Criminal Matters.  Since 
1976, Suriname has shared drug-related information with the Netherlands as part of   a mutual 
legal assistance agreement among former Dutch colonies to exchange crime-related data.  In 
1999, the United States and Suriname completed a comprehensive bilateral maritime 


INCSR 2018 Volume 1  
 
 
 
 
Country Reports 
263 
 
counternarcotics enforcement agreement that remains in force.  Suriname has also signed 
bilateral agreements to combat drug trafficking with Brazil, Venezuela, and Colombia. 
  
 
2.  Supply Reduction 
 
Suriname is not a source country for illegal drugs or precursor chemicals, but it continues to be 
used as a transshipment point for illicit drugs.  During 2017, there was an increase in the volume 
of drugs seized in the country, which may be due to increased drug production in Colombia.  
Worsening economic conditions in Suriname may also have produced increased incentives for 
criminal activity.  During the first nine months of 2017, Surinamese authorities seized 
approximately 2.88 metric tons of cocaine; 16.5 liters of liquid cocaine; 57.6 kilograms (kg) of 
marijuana; three kg of hashish; and 393 MDMA (ecstasy) tablets. 
 
 
3.  Public Information, Prevention, and Treatment  
 
Illicit drug use is relatively rare in Suriname, with marijuana being the primary drug consumed 
locally.  There is one free, government-run detoxification center; other treatment centers are run 
by non-governmental organizations.  In 2014, law-makers adopted new legislation allowing 
treatment for drug addiction as an alternative to criminal sentencing.  As recently as October 
2017, implementing protocols for this legislation were still being drafted. 
 
In 2017, the police launched a three-week information campaign to increase awareness of the 
dangers of drugs and trafficking drugs.  The program was in response to an increase in December 
2016 of youth bringing packages to the postal service that contained drugs.  The majority of 
individuals did not know the contents of packages nor the person who gave them the packages. 
   
After two years of inactivity, in 2017 the government appointed new members for the National 
Antidrug Board (NAR).  The board is responsible for coordinating all outreach efforts on drug 
use by both government and nongovernment organizations.  The board is also partially 
responsible for drafting the National Drugs Master Plan and National Drug Prevention Plan. 
     
4.  Corruption  
 
The National Parliament passed an Anti-corruption law in September 2017.  The law requires 
additional implementing rules to be created by state decree and the naming of one or more 
specialized prosecutors for corruption cases.  Corruption pervades many government offices in 
Suriname, but local criminal investigations of alleged corrupt acts are rare and local prosecutions 
even rarer.  President Desire Bouterse and Member of Parliament Ronnie Brunswijk have been 
convicted of drug trafficking in absentia in separate court cases in the Netherlands and France.  
Dino Bouterse, son of President Desire Bouterse, was sentenced in March 2015 to prison in New 
York for drug smuggling and other crimes. 
 
C.  National Goals, Bilateral Cooperation, and U.S. Policy Initiatives  
 
The United States supports a range of efforts designed to address crime and violence in 
Suriname, primarily through the Caribbean Basin Security Initiative (CBSI).  CBSI is a security 


INCSR 2018 Volume 1  
 
 
 
 
Country Reports

partnership between the United States and Caribbean nations that seeks to substantially reduce 
illicit trafficking, advance public safety and citizen security, and promote justice.   
 
CBSI support to Suriname includes training and equipment, primarily to the KPS and justice 
sector actors, to prevent and interdict drug trafficking, enhance maritime law enforcement 
capabilities, combat money laundering, and support at-risk youth programs. 
 
D.  Conclusion 
 
Suriname continues to be a transit country for illicit drugs originating in South America.  The 
United States encourages the Government of Suriname to combat corruption and take further 
steps to increase the effectiveness of drug interdiction efforts within the country, as well as 
subsequent investigations and prosecutions.

Tajikistan 
 
A.  Introduction  
  
Sharing a porous 835-mile border with Afghanistan, Tajikistan is situated along one of the main 
transit corridors for Afghan opiates and cannabis products.  While there is a small domestic 
market for these drugs in Tajikistan, the bulk of the opiates and cannabis products trafficked 
through the country are destined for Russia, Eastern Europe, and further international markets.   
 
A 2012 assessment by the United Nations Office of Drugs and Crime (UNODC) estimated 75 to 
80 metric tons (MT) of heroin and 18 to 20 MT of opium transit Tajikistan annually, with most 
of the drugs transiting north by vehicle and trains.  Though Tajikistan is the major route for 
heroin trafficking from Afghanistan, according to UNODC’s 2017 World Drug Report, Tajik 
authorities are only seizing a small quantity of the opiates transferred through the country, 
although seizure statistics are only one measure of effective drug control efforts.  Since the 
number of registered persons suffering from substance use disorders in Tajikistan has remained 
relatively stable over the past several years, it is unclear whether usage rates are increasing, 
although there is concern over the growth in availability of synthetic drugs and new psychoactive 
substances (NPS) in the country.  The government appears to have the political will to counter 
domestic trafficking in drugs but must contend with pervasive corruption at all levels. 
 
B.  Drug Control Accomplishments, Policies, and Trends 
  
 
1.  Institutional Development 
  
Tajik drug control agencies are capable and have benefited from years of international donor 
support.  They are generally well-equipped and regularly receive training from donor funded 
international organizations and the United States.   
 
In 2017, U.S. assistance programming focused on developing a curriculum for new drug officer 
recruits to the Drug Control Agency (DCA), along with providing needed regional infrastructure 
for the organization.  Cooperation on investigations with U.S. law enforcement agencies in 
Tajikistan is very good.   
 
Tajikistan does not have an extradition or mutual legal assistance treaty with the United States, 
though Tajikistan is party to multilateral conventions which enable law enforcement cooperation. 
 
 
2.  Supply Reduction  
  
According to statistics provided by the DCA, overall drug seizures totaled 3.37 MT during the 
first nine months of 2017, a 24 percent increase from seizures made during the same period in 
2016.  Opium accounted for the bulk of seizures, followed by hashish.   
 
Opium seizures increased to 821 kilograms (kg) over this nine-month reporting period, up by 
nearly 100 percent from the same period in 2016.  Hashish seizures increased by 13 percent, 
totaling approximately 2.49 MT, while cannabis seizures rose by two percent, to 563 kg. 


INCSR 2018 Volume 1  
 
 
 
 
Country Reports 
266 
 
 
In a multi-year trend, heroin seizures in Tajikistan continued to decline.  Fifty-three kg were 
seized during the first nine months of 2017, a 36 percent decrease from the same period of 2016.  
There was a six percent decline in the number of MDMA (ecstasy) pills seized, from 10,107 to 
9,515. 
 
Most agencies with drug enforcement responsibilities reported seizing reduced volumes of illicit 
drugs in 2017.  The Border Guards Service was the exception, reporting a large increase in 
seizures that led to an overall increase in the volume of seized drugs within the country.  Even 
with this increase, overall seizure rates remain significantly below what was recorded several 
years ago.  The DCA has offered various reasons to explain why seizure totals have trended 
downward, including: shifting trafficking patterns; an expanded Tajik security presence along the 
country’s border with Afghanistan; and renewed focus by the Tajik government on substance 
abuse prevention.   
 
 
3.  Public Information, Prevention, and Treatment 
 
Awareness-raising activities to warn about the danger of illicit drugs are funded by Tajikistan 
and international donors.  The media, printed materials, and sporting events raise understanding 
of the dangers of illicit drug use and promote healthy lifestyles.  The government has embarked 
on greater youth engagement on a number of issues, including drug demand reduction.  The 
Ministry of Health provides treatment services in Dushanbe and four other regional centers 
where residential in-house treatment and methadone maintenance services are provided.  Of the 
12 methadone treatment centers in Tajikistan, three are funded by the U.S. government.  A pilot 
prison project was started in 2017, providing 13 inmates with methadone therapy.  
 
There were 6,930 registered persons with substance use disorders within Tajikistan as of October 
2017, including 167 women.  Three-hundred and forty individuals were added to the rolls during 
the first nine months of 2017.  The number of registered persons suffering from addiction has 
remained relatively stable over the past several years, in large part because addicted individuals 
may remain registered for up to five years.  Of the total number of registered persons suffering 
from substance use disorders, 5,591 are addicted to heroin, with injection being the preferred 
means of use, and approximately 85 percent of registered users are between 35 to 59 years old.  
Official statistics probably underestimate the true number of Tajikistanis addicted to drugs 
because of hesitancy to register with the government.   
 
 
4.  Corruption 
  
The Government of Tajikistan does not, as a matter of government policy, encourage or facilitate 
illicit drug production or distribution, nor is it involved in laundering the proceeds of the sale of 
illicit drugs.  In 2017, there were no reports of senior government officials or law enforcement 
officers being involved in drug trafficking.  However, extremely low salaries for state workers, 
the profitability of illegal drug sales, and the dearth of other licit economic opportunities make 
accepting drug money attractive.  
 
C.  National Goals, Bilateral Cooperation, and U.S. Policy Initiatives 


INCSR 2018 Volume 1  
 
 
 
 
Country Reports 
267 
 
   
During the first nine months of 2017, the U.S. government contributed or dedicated $1.8 million 
in assistance to Tajikistan’s drug control efforts.  The aid has been in the form of training, 
buildings, equipment and other expenses.  Most of the assistance has focused on the DCA, the 
principal drug enforcement organization in the country, although some has gone to border and 
other security forces.  While the DCA is a competent, willing, and professional investigative 
body, its effectiveness is limited by poor coordination with other domestic and regional law 
enforcement bodies, and a lack of modern investigative tools.  Effective use of court ordered 
electronic communications intercepts should be further developed.  
 
The U.S. government has funded and supported a vetted unit within the DCA, whose members 
are polygraphed by the U.S. government.  The unit is intended to focus on high level traffickers 
and organizations, and obtained10 criminal convictions in 2017. 
 
D.  Conclusion 
  
With seizures declining over the past few years, Tajikistan should undertake an in-depth 
assessment of its drug control efforts.  Corruption remains pervasive in Tajikistan and negatively 
impacts the country’s drug control efforts.  The Tajik government has demonstrated some 
willingness to tackle high-level corruption in the past, having filed charges against senior drug 
control officials in 2015 and 2016.

Tanzania 
 
Tanzania is a significant transit country for illicit drugs, notably Southwest Asian heroin and 
South American cocaine, with domestic drug use increasing within the country.  Tanzania-based 
trafficking organizations and courier networks operate globally, and play a prominent role in the 
Southwest Asian heroin trade.  Tanzania produces cannabis for domestic consumption and 
international distribution.  
 
Tanzania’s geographical location, high levels of corruption, and porous borders present 
considerable challenges to drug interdiction strategies.  Traffickers exploit Tanzania’s 854 mile 
coastline and inadequate security at Tanzanian seaports, specifically those in Dar es Salaam and 
Tanga.  Southwest Asian heroin is transported in multi-hundred kilogram quantities by small 
oceangoing vessels to Zanzibar and the Tanzanian coastline.  From Tanzania, heroin is 
distributed to retail markets and user populations throughout Africa, Asia, Europe, and North 
America.  Large quantities of heroin are sent across the land border with Kenya for 
transshipment to Europe and North America.  Smaller amounts (three to five kilograms) are sent 
to Europe from Dar es Salaam via commercial flights and overnight air cargo companies.  South 
American cocaine is trafficked into Tanzania by couriers on commercial flights to Dar es Salaam 
for further international distribution.  Precursor chemicals primarily from Asia are brought 
through Tanzanian ports, and used to produce methamphetamine and psychotropic substances in 
clandestine labs to supply domestic and international markets. 
  
The Tanzanian Drug Control and Enforcement Authority (DCEA), the Tanzania Intelligence and 
Security Service (TISS), the Tanzanian Police Service’s Anti-Narcotics Unit, and the Tanzanian 
Peoples Defence Force (TPDF) contribute to Tanzania’s fight against illicit drug trafficking.  
These agencies work with U.S. and other international law enforcement partners.  In May 2017, 
Ali Khatib Haji Hassan,  (aka Shkuba), one of Tanzania’s most influential drug kingpins, and 
two of his associates were extradited to the United States.  In October, the DCEA and TPDF 
seized 127 kg of heroin and arrested 12 suspects  following the interception of a dhow off the 
coast of Zanzibar. 
 
Extradition between Tanzania and the United States is governed by the 1931 U.S.-U.K. 
Extradition Treaty.  There is no bilateral mutual legal assistance treaty between Tanzania and the 
United States, though both countries are parties to various multilateral conventions with 
provisions for assistance which can be provided on a reciprocal basis through letters of request.  
 
The Government of Tanzania does not encourage or facilitate the production or trafficking of 
illicit drugs as a matter of policy, but corruption remains a barrier to effective enforcement.  
Drug traffickers use their considerable financial resources to influence politicians, law 
enforcement officers, and others in positions of power.  
 
The United States seeks to promote improved interdiction operations and limit the corrosive 
effects of drug-related corruption in Tanzanian institutions through law enforcement cooperation 
and by encouraging a strong Tanzanian government commitment to drug interdiction and 
criminal justice capacity building.

Thailand 
 
A.  Introduction 
 
Thailand remains a net importer of illicit drugs for domestic use, and drug trafficking into and 
through the country remains a significant problem.  No significant quantities of opiates, 
methamphetamine, or other illegal drugs were cultivated or produced in Thailand in 2017, 
though various transnational criminal organizations continue to exploit Thailand both as a market 
and transit country for illicit drugs destined for regional and international markets.  The primary 
drugs of concern continue to be amphetamine-type stimulants (ATS), specifically 
methamphetamine originating in Burma, and heroin.   
 
According to the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime, the Thai government has not 
reported eradicating opium poppy since 2013.  However, in 2017, the Thai Office of Narcotics 
Control Board (ONCB) reported that 1,965 kilograms (kg) of opium poppy plants were seized 
during the first six months of 2017, compared to 662.2 kg during all of 2016.  Heroin seizures 
have increased in Thailand since a significant drop in 2015, and methamphetamine seizures have 
also increased since 2016.  Through the first six months of 2017, the country was on pace to 
register historic levels of methamphetamine seizures, in both tablet and crystal form.  
 
B.  Drug Control Accomplishments, Policies, and Trends 
 
 
1.  Institutional Development 
 
Thailand has bilateral extradition and mutual legal assistance treaties with the United States.  
Thailand is an effective and cooperative partner of the United States, with U.S. assistance 
facilitating and enhancing that cooperation.  
 
 
2.  Supply Reduction  
 
Methamphetamine trafficking and abuse continues to be the primary drug concern in Thailand.  
The production of methamphetamine in Burma by non-state armed groups and by other regional 
producers remains an issue of great concern for Thailand.  The ONCB estimated that 80 percent 
of the drugs smuggled into Thailand entered through its northern border.  In 2016 (the most 
recent year for which data is available), ONCB seized approximately 2.23 metric tons (MT) of 
crystal methamphetamine and 9.75 MT of methamphetamine tablets.  During the first six months 
of 2017, Thailand law enforcement had already surpassed total 2016 figures for 
methamphetamine tablet seizures, having seized approximately 10.3 MT tablets, as well as 
approximately 1.92 MT of crystal methamphetamine.  
 
Trafficking in heroin through Thailand remains a challenge for Thai law enforcement agencies, 
as seizures increased over the first six months of 2017.  According to ONCB, Thai authorities 
seized 285.1 kg of heroin between January and June 2017, compared to the total volume of 278.3 
kg of heroin seized during all of 2016.

Use of MDMA (known locally as “ya-E”) in Thailand remained stable in 2017, and confined 
mainly to Bangkok and tourist areas.  MDMA is typically smuggled into Thailand by couriers on 
commercial aircraft from Europe.  Malaysia is also a primary route for MDMA crossing into 
southern Thailand, with reports indicating cross-border trafficking by Singapore and Malaysian 
traffickers at ports-of-entry along the Thai-Malaysian border.  According to ONCB, Thai 
authorities seized 11.2 kg of MDMA during the first six months of 2017, compared to 
approximately 21.73 kg during all of 2016.    
 
Thai authorities have reported an increase in the availability of cocaine within Thailand over 
recent years, though the market remains limited to foreigners and affluent Thais.  The drug is 
most often found in private residences and entertainment venues in Bangkok, as well as popular 
tourist destinations in various provinces.  The cocaine market is largely controlled by Africa-
based trafficking networks, though South American and Chinese trafficking groups are also 
involved in bulk cocaine smuggling through Thailand, typically for further export to Australia 
and China.  According to ONCB, approximately 10.4 kg were seized during the first six months 
of 2017, compared to 42.05 kg during the entirety of 2016.  
 
Marijuana continued to be readily available throughout Thailand and the region.  Though limited 
quantities of cannabis are cultivated domestically, most of the marijuana seized in Thailand 
originates from Laos.  During the first six months of 2017, ONCB reported seizing 
approximately 15.58 MT of dried marijuana, comparable to the pace of total seizures in 2016 
(29.27 MT for the entire year).  Krathom (mitragyna speciosa is a plant indigenous to Thailand 
with psychoactive properties that is also abused as a recreational drug, primarily in Thailand’s 
southern provinces.   
 
There is limited ketamine abuse in Thailand, mainly among younger users who prefer it as a 
cheaper (and perceived safer) alternative to MDMA.  However, seizure numbers suggest that 
ketamine use may be increasing.  According to ONCB, Thai authorities seized 107.7 kg of 
ketamine during the first six months of 2017, compared to 169.7 kg during all of 2016.  Most 
ketamine entering Thailand is believed to originate from India and/or China. Ketamine is also 
transshipped from other countries such as Malaysia and Singapore into Thailand.  South Asian 
and Taiwanese drug trafficking organizations are prominently involved in ketamine trafficking.  
 
Thailand’s penalties for drug-related offenses are severe and can include the death penalty for 
those convicted of possession of more than 20 grams of Schedule I substances with “intent to 
sell,” a punishment reportedly last used in 2009.  
 
 
3.  Public Information, Prevention, and Treatment 
 
According to press reporting, Thailand is estimated to have as many as 2.7 million illicit drug 
users in the country.  Thailand carries out comprehensive demand reduction programs, 
combining drug use prevention programs with treatment for those suffering from substance use 
disorders.  According to ONCB, drug treatment programs have reached over 700,000 persons 
with substance use disorders since 2011.  The Thai government also invests in building 
awareness of the perils of drug addiction, but the effectiveness of these awareness programs is 
difficult to gauge.

4.  Corruption  
 
As a matter of policy, the Thai government does not permit, encourage, or facilitate illicit 
production or distribution of narcotic/psychotropic drugs or other controlled substances, or the 
laundering of drug proceeds, by individuals or government agencies.  However, corruption 
remains a problem in Thailand, and some officials are susceptible to bribery.   
 
C.  National Goals, Bilateral Cooperation, and U.S. Policy Initiatives 
 
Thai and the U.S law enforcement agencies enjoy a strong cooperative relationship and support 
from the highest levels of the Thai government.  The U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration 
(DEA) continued to work closely with Thai law enforcement authorities on coordinated 
investigations in 2017.  Thailand is one of several countries in which DEA maintains Sensitive 
Investigative Units (SIUs).  Thai SIU participants receive specialized training and undergo a 
rigorous vetting process.   
 
Additionally, the United States provides a stream of training and assistance to Thai law 
enforcement and criminal justice entities specific to drug trafficking.  Through the U.S.-funded, 
Thailand-hosted International Law Enforcement Academy and other programs, the United States 
and Thailand are working to enhance regional cooperation to combat transnational crime.  The 
United States also provides training and other assistance to Thai customs officials, Thai Maritime 
Police, and other law enforcement authorities to improve border protection and investigation 
skills.  Thailand uses U.S.-developed curriculum to support training and professionalization of its 
substance treatment workforce.  With U.S. support, the program is establishing a cadre of 
national trainers who will disseminate the training throughout the country.  
 
D.  Conclusion  
 
The U.S. government enjoys a particularly close and collaborative relationship with Thai law 
enforcement.  The United States will continue to assist the Thai government in its efforts to 
promote greater cooperation between its police and prosecutors, prevent corruption, and further 
advance regional drug control cooperation.

Trinidad and Tobago 
 
A.  Introduction 
 
Trinidad and Tobago’s close proximity to Venezuela, open coastline, and direct transportation 
routes to Europe, Canada, and the United States make it an ideal location for cocaine and 
marijuana transshipment.  While some marijuana is produced locally, much is imported from 
other islands in the Caribbean – and increasingly from South America – due to its perceived 
higher quality.  Other illicit drugs, including cocaine, heroin, and MDMA (ecstasy), also transit 
Trinidad and Tobago or remain on the islands for domestic consumption.  
 
The Government of Trinidad and Tobago continues to make progress in its ability to investigate 
complex illicit drug cases, but remains challenged by insufficient resources and capacity.  Robust 
interdiction efforts continued in 2017, though fewer drugs were seized overall compared to 2016.  
The government’s strong commitment to drug demand reduction persists, though treatment 
capacity remains under-resourced, and more data is needed to accurately quantify drug usage 
within the country.  
 
Declining government revenues due to decreased oil and gas production, combined with lower 
oil and gas prices, will likely create further resource constraints for government agencies charged 
with implementing and enforcing drug control policy.  
 
B.  Drug Control Accomplishments, Policies, and Trends 
 
1.  Institutional Development 
 
Trinidad and Tobago demonstrates continued commitment to drug control through bilateral 
cooperation with the United States and other countries, including intelligence sharing with 
countries of origin, transit, and destination.  The Government of Trinidad and Tobago regularly 
communicates with local, regional, and international organizations, collaborating on international 
and national drug control priorities.  Trinidad and Tobago’s drug control institutions remain 
challenged by deficiencies in staffing and funding.  
 
To combat illicit drug trafficking and other forms of organized crime more effectively, the 
Ministry of National Security announced in September 2017 the creation of a new Organized 
Crime Intelligence Unit.  This new unit merged the previous Organized Crime, Narcotics, and 
Firearms Bureau and the Criminal Gang and Intelligence Unit to reduce barriers to information 
sharing and improve collaboration on investigations.  Distrust, however, within and between 
certain units of law enforcement, the military, and the intelligence community remains, and 
continues to impede interagency coordination.  
 
Specialized law enforcement units that target illicit drugs, organized crime, and maritime 
interdiction receive support from international donors through specialized training and 
equipment.  International support has enhanced the ability of Trinidad and Tobago’s law 
enforcement and investigative units to track sophisticated criminal networks trafficking drugs.  
In March 2017, the Trinidad and Tobago Coast Guard, in partnership with the United States 


INCSR 2018 Volume 1  
 
 
 
 
Country Reports 
273 
 
Coast Guard, intercepted a fishing vessel carrying approximately 4.2 metric tons of cocaine, 
cited as the largest seizure in the Atlantic Ocean since 1999.  Domestic cannabis eradication 
efforts increased in 2017 compared to 2016. 
 
Trinidad and Tobago has mutual legal assistance treaties with the United States, Canada, and the 
United Kingdom.  The country is also party with the United States to a narcotics control and law 
enforcement letter of agreement; a maritime law enforcement agreement that enables the United 
States to patrol Trinidad and Tobago’s waters and detain vessels suspected of trafficking drugs; 
and a customs mutual assistance agreement, which allows for the exchange of information, 
intelligence, and documents to assist in the prevention and investigation of customs offenses.  
The United States also maintains an extradition treaty with Trinidad and Tobago. 
 
2.  Supply Reduction 
 
Marijuana is the only known locally-produced illicit drug within Trinidad and Tobago.  
Production is concentrated in small farms in heavily forested, mountainous regions.  
Traditionally, local producers compete with imports from St. Vincent and the Grenadines, 
Jamaica, and Guyana that are perceived to be of a higher quality.  
 
Law enforcement information suggests that increasing amounts of marijuana are entering the 
country via Venezuela, as part of a trend of increased trade of both licit and illicit goods between 
the two countries.  Other illicit drugs, primarily cocaine, but also small amounts of heroin and 
MDMA (ecstasy), are trafficked through the country by transnational organized crime groups 
operating in Trinidad and Tobago, exploiting its close proximity to Venezuela and vulnerabilities 
at ports of entry.  The main destination for these drugs continues to be the European market.  
Anecdotal reports also suggest that trafficking of small amounts of ketamine takes place.  
 
In collaboration with several international partners, Trinidad and Tobago law enforcement 
entities seized approximately 705 kilograms (kg) of marijuana and 74.2 kg of cocaine within the 
country during the first eight months of 2017, compared to seizures totaling approximately 1.2 
MT and 292 kg, respectively, of both drugs during all of 2016.  
 
3.  Public Information, Prevention, and Treatment 
 
Information on drug-use trends in Trinidad and Tobago is anecdotal, though the government 
continues to seek resources to conduct a national-level survey to obtain baseline data on drug 
usage.  The primary drug used is marijuana, followed by cocaine.  Drug treatment professionals 
assess that drug usage continues to increase among youth.  There are a number of drug treatment 
programs in Trinidad and Tobago supported by the government, non-governmental 
organizations, religious groups, and hospitals.  Challenges remain in integrating existing criminal 
justice, healthcare, welfare, and education systems to effectively treat drug use disorders, and 
there is a need to train more prevention specialists and treatment service providers to accredited 
standards.  Trinidad and Tobago’s 2014 National Drug Policy and its companion Operational 
Plan for Drug Control in Trinidad and Tobago 2014-2018 are designed to reduce both the supply 
of and demand for illegal drugs.  Drug prevention efforts include school-based education 
programs; training for educators; anti-drug media campaigns; and special outreach events.  


INCSR 2018 Volume 1  
 
 
 
 
Country Reports 
274 
 
 
4.  Corruption 
 
The Government of Trinidad and Tobago neither directly encourages nor facilitates the illicit 
production or distribution of drugs nor the laundering of proceeds from the sale of illicit drugs.  
No charges of drug-related corruption were filed against senior government officials in 2017.  
Media and anecdotal reports of drug-related corruption in the ranks of the Police Service, 
Prisons, Defense Force, Customs and Excise Division, and port employees are common.  The 
Police Complaints Authority, an independent law enforcement oversight body, recorded 212 
complaints, including fraud and corruption, through September 22, 2017. 
 
C.  National Goals, Bilateral Cooperation, and U.S. Policy Initiatives 
 
The United States supports a wide range of efforts designed to address crime and violence 
affecting citizens in Trinidad and Tobago, primarily through the Caribbean Basin Security 
Initiative (CBSI).  CBSI is a security partnership between the United States and the Caribbean 
that strives to substantially reduce illicit trafficking, advance public safety and citizen security, 
and promote justice.  CBSI programming in Trinidad and Tobago focuses on law enforcement 
and military capacity building, justice sector capacity building, and juvenile justice.  CBSI 
projects that include Trinidad and Tobago are underway to increase law enforcement capacity-
building and regional law enforcement and justice sector cooperation; support criminal justice 
reform; prevent financial crimes; support demand reduction; reduce illicit trafficking of firearms; 
and increase maritime and aerial domain awareness.  The Government of Trinidad and Tobago is 
an active partner in CBSI programs.  The United States maintains a binding operational 
agreement to suppress illicit traffic by sea with Trinidad and Tobago, which includes ship 
boarding and expedited communications. 
 
D.  Conclusion 
 
The United States and Trinidad and Tobago enjoy a cooperative relationship against drug 
trafficking and transnational organized crime.  The entities and individuals working to combat 
drug trafficking in Trinidad and Tobago, however, continue to face considerable institutional 
challenges.  In spite of current budget challenges, the Government of Trinidad and Tobago 
should continue to implement reforms and programs to improve the capacity of its law 
enforcement and criminal justice institutions to detect illicit drug trafficking and effectively 
investigate, arrest, and prosecute suspected drug traffickers.  The United States will continue to 
assist these efforts to bolster Trinidad and Tobago’s drug-control institutions.

Turkey 
 
A.  Introduction 
 
Turkey remains a significant transit country for illicit drug trafficking.  Heroin, opium, and 
cocaine are generally trafficked through Turkey to European markets, and amphetamine-type 
stimulants (ATS) are trafficked to markets in the Middle East and Southeast Asia.  Turkish 
authorities continue to seize large amounts of opiates and hashish in Turkey, and the 
Government of Turkey remains committed to upholding its international drug control 
obligations.  Turkish law enforcement agencies remain strongly committed to disrupting illicit 
drug trafficking. 
 
B.  Drug Control Accomplishments, Policies, and Trends 
 
1.  Institutional Development 
 
The Turkish National Police (TNP) Narcotics Department is the country’s most proactive 
counterdrug force and has jurisdiction for drug-related crimes in urban areas.  The U.S. Drug 
Enforcement Administration (DEA) often partners with the TNP Narcotics Department.  The 
Jandarma, a component of the Ministry of Interior (MOI) responsible for rural areas outside the 
jurisdiction of the TNP, also plays a significant role, especially in the country’s cannabis 
eradication programs.  TNP intelligence frequently leads to rural areas, in which case the two 
agencies conduct investigations and seizures together.  Turkey’s Coast Guard, also under the 
MOI, has some drug control responsibilities, and the Ministry of Customs and Trade, Directorate 
General of Customs Guards, is also a counterpart to the DEA.  The Ministry of Health is 
responsible for regulating pharmaceutical products and for issues relating to importation of 
chemicals for legitimate use.   
 
The Turkish International Academy against Drugs and Organized Crime (TADOC) is an 
important resource for providing advanced training to law enforcement professionals from within 
Turkey and across neighboring states.  The UN Office on Drugs and Crime (UNODC) sponsors 
training sessions at TADOC for narcotics police from Central Asia and other states.  TADOC 
also partners with DEA, the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe, the Turkish 
International Cooperation and Development Agency, and other mutual security organizations in 
the planning and execution of training projects, instructor fellowship exchanges, and workshops 
throughout the region.  U.S. and Turkish cooperation on extradition and mutual legal assistance 
relations are governed by the 1981 United States-Turkey extradition and mutual legal assistance 
treaty.  
 
2.  Supply Reduction 
 
Most heroin trafficked via Turkey is marketed in Western Europe, where Turkish traffickers 
control much of the distribution.  Turkey also is a transit route for opiates smuggled overland 
from Afghanistan mostly via Iran.  Major Turkish smugglers are frequently involved in both 
heroin sales and transport, as well as limited production and smuggling of synthetic drugs.  Some 


INCSR 2018 Volume 1  
 
 
 
 
Country Reports 
276 
 
criminal elements in Turkey reportedly have interests in heroin laboratories operating in Iran 
near Turkey’s border.  Heroin arrives in Turkey as a finished product from Afghanistan.  
 
Turkey also serves as a transit route for methamphetamine smuggled by air from Iran and bound 
for markets in Southeast Asia, as well as ATS originating in Eastern Europe bound for countries 
in the Middle East. 
 
While cocaine is generally transshipped through Turkey to European markets, there are 
indications of a growing market in Turkey.  Cocaine arrives from South America, often in cargo 
ships destined for Turkish ports.  Seizures indicate cocaine is predominately hidden inside 
passenger luggage or hidden on persons.   
 
Turkey is a transit route for opium smuggled overland from Afghanistan via Turkmenistan, 
Azerbaijan, and Georgia en route to Western Europe.  While the Balkan Route into Western 
Europe remains heavily used, evidence suggests traffickers also use a more northerly route 
through Azerbaijan, Georgia, Russia, and Ukraine.  Turkey and India are the only two licit 
traditional poppy-growing countries recognized by the U.S. government and the International 
Narcotics Control Board.  Opium is produced in Turkey under strict domestic controls and 
international treaty obligations.  The Turkish Grain Board strictly controls licit opium poppy 
cultivation and pharmaceutical morphine production, with no apparent diversion into the illicit 
market.   
 
Cannabis products, primarily hashish, either enter Turkey from Afghanistan, Lebanon, and 
Albania, or are locally cultivated and produced in Turkey, primarily for local consumption.  
 
The TNP uses TADOC to train officers on drug trafficking interdiction and investigation 
techniques.  Border control initiatives and upgrades include the deployment of x-ray machines 
and ion scanners to Turkey’s eastern borders.   
 
Drug proceeds are often moved to and through Turkey informally, despite the fact only banks 
and authorized money transfer companies can legally move money.  Money exchange bureaus, 
jewelry stores, and other businesses believed to be part of the informal hawala banking system 
are investigated only if the business is directly tied to an existing drug or other criminal 
investigation.  
 
According to Turkish authorities, during the first six months of 2017, Turkish authorities seized 
approximately 6.47 metric tons (MT) of heroin; 590 kilograms (kg) of morphine base; 14,828 
liters of acetic anhydride; 1.06 MT of cocaine; 579 kg of cannabis; 2,462,000 fenethylline 
tablets; 18,000,000 tramadol tablets; 116 kg of methamphetamine; 38 kg of synthetic 
cannabinoids; 40 kg of MDMA; and 39 kg of opium. 
 
3.  Public Information, Prevention, and Treatment 
 
A Deputy Prime Minister chairs the High Council for Fighting Drugs, whose members include 
six ministries and civil society, and coordinates drug prevention and treatment programs.  Drug-

related treatment is provided by public agencies, private entities and nongovernmental 
organizations (NGOs), and is mainly funded through the state and health insurance.  
 
Most Turkish treatment services for those with substance use disorders are aimed at achieving a 
drug-free life and dealing with addiction in general and not specifically for users of illicit drugs.  
These programs include psychotherapeutic and supporting methods, with the majority of drug-
related treatment services taking place within inpatient settings.  
 
While illegal drug use remains modest in scale in Turkey compared to other regional countries, 
the number of people seeking treatment for substance use disorders is increasing.  The Ministry 
of Education provides funding to an NGO for the development and implementation of a healthy 
living and anti-drug curriculum for schools.  The Ministry of Health has responsibility for 
promoting drug awareness and providing treatment, but it remains underfunded and does not 
conduct regular, periodic drug use surveys.  
 
4.  Corruption 
 
As a matter of government policy, Turkey does not encourage or facilitate illicit production or 
distribution of narcotic or psychotropic drugs or other controlled substances, or the laundering of 
proceeds from illegal drug transactions.  No senior-level government official is alleged to have 
participated in such activities in 2017.  
 
C.  National Goals, Bilateral Cooperation, and U.S. Policy Initiatives 
 
The United States works closely with Turkey to offer regional training opportunities to Turkish 
law enforcement officials and at the TADOC center to provide additional tools to Turkish 
officials and their international counterparts.  Turkey hosts several international counter drug 
forums with goals to enhance investigative abilities, cooperation, and relationships between 
international law enforcement agencies.  
 
D.  Conclusion 
 
The United States will continue to work with Turkish law enforcement agencies to strengthen 
Turkey’s ability to combat drug trafficking, money-laundering, and financial crimes, and reduce 
the flow of Afghan heroin to international markets.  The United States will also continue to 
support Turkey’s work as a regional leader in drug control training and education.

Turkmenistan 
 
Turkmenistan is located along a transshipment route used by transnational drug-trafficking 
networks to smuggle Afghan opiates to Turkish, Russian, and European markets.  Illicit drugs 
are smuggled into Turkmenistan both directly from Afghanistan and through Iran.  Turkmenistan 
is not a major producer or source country for illicit drugs or precursor chemicals.  Most drug 
seizures occur along Turkmenistan's rugged and remote 500-mile border with Afghanistan and 
its 713-mile frontier with Iran, where the Government of Turkmenistan directs the bulk of its law 
enforcement resources and personnel.   
 
Turkmenistan does not encourage or facilitate the illicit production or distribution of illicit drugs 
or other controlled substances.   
 
Prices for heroin, opium, and marijuana remain among the highest in the Central Asia region, 
according to local observers, and these drugs are reportedly increasingly scarce within 
Turkmenistan.  In 2017, the government held two "drug-burn" ceremonies, one in January and 
the other in June, destroying an undisclosed amount of illegal drugs.  State television 
occasionally reports on drug seizures. 
 
The Central Asian Regional Information and Coordination Center reported a slight decline in the 
amount of drugs seized during the first six months of 2017.  The Turkmen government reported 
no evidence of synthetic drug production in Turkmenistan during the year, and according to the 
2017 UN World Drug Report, the country is not a major trafficking route for synthetic drugs.  
 
Turkmenistan does not have an extradition treaty or mutual legal assistance agreement with the 
United States, but it is a party to the 1988 UN Drug Convention, which provides a mechanism to 
provide legal assistance in accordance with its provisions. 
 
Cooperation between international partners and Turkmenistan's drug enforcement agencies, 
which continue to need increased resources, training, and equipment, remains important to 
improving drug control efforts.  Since 2016, however, the Turkmen government has scaled back 
its drug control cooperation with U.S. agencies.  The United States encourages Turkmenistan to 
continue its long-term efforts to stem the flow of illicit drugs by working with international 
partners.

Ukraine 
 
Although Ukraine is not a major drug producing country, its location astride several important 
drug trafficking routes into Western Europe leaves it vulnerable to significant drug transit.  
Ukraine’s numerous ports on the Black and Azov seas, its extensive river routes, and its porous 
northern and eastern borders make Ukraine an attractive route for drug traffickers into the 
European Union’s (EU) illicit drug market. 
 
Heroin and other opiates from Afghanistan are trafficked through Russia, the Caucasus, and 
Turkey, before passing through Ukraine.  South American cocaine is moved through Ukrainian 
seaports and airports for both domestic use and onward transit to EU countries.  Ukrainian law 
enforcement occasionally interdicts large shipments of drugs in commercial shipments transiting 
southern ports.  Usually, however, drugs are found in small quantities, ranging from several 
grams to several hundred grams.  As long as Russia continues to arm, train, and fight alongside 
forces in eastern Ukraine and tolerate and foster volatile criminal “statelets” on its border, 
Ukraine will remain vulnerable to drug transit. 
 
The use of synthetic drugs and psychotropic substances, especially amphetamine-type stimulants, 
has been rapidly increasing in Ukraine over the past decade, following international trends.  
Synthetic drugs are trafficked to Ukraine primarily from Poland, Lithuania, and the Netherlands, 
but they are also produced locally in small clandestine labs.  Most domestic drug abuse, 
however, continues to be focused on drugs made from illicit drug crops (cannabis and opium 
poppy) grown in the region.  These account for more than 90 percent of the total drug market in 
Ukraine.  In most instances, these drugs are either locally produced or supplied from Russia and 
Moldova. 
 
During the first nine months of 2017, Ukrainian law enforcement agencies eliminated 126 
clandestine labs and dismantled 44 organized criminal drug trafficking groups.  As part of these 
operations, a total of approximately 9.82 metric tons of narcotics, psychotropic drugs and other 
controlled substances were seized, including 4.8 kilograms (kg) of cocaine and 536.5 kg of 
psychotropic drugs (including two large shipments of fenethylline totaling 426 kg, destined for 
the United Arab Emirates and Kuwait). 
 
The United States is providing assistance to help Ukraine bring its law enforcement institutions 
up to European standards, facilitating Ukraine’s integration into Euro-Atlantic institutions.  The 
U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration and U.S. Customs and Border Protection have 
established good working relationships across the Ukrainian law enforcement sector and ongoing 
U.S. training programs have deepened these relationships.  The United States also assists the 
National Police of Ukraine in developing its capacities and continues to support efforts to 
strengthen the State Border Guard Service’s capability to control Ukraine’s 3,490 mile-long 
border.

United Kingdom 
 
The United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland (UK) is a significant consumer 
country of illicit drugs, and, to a lesser extent, a transshipment route for drugs destined for other 
international markets.  Transnational criminal organizations that traffic drugs into the UK also 
engage in a wide assortment of additional criminal activity, such as financial crimes and money 
laundering.  The most commonly used drug by UK adults is marijuana, followed by cocaine.  
However, among 16- to 24-year-olds, cocaine use falls to third place, following marijuana and 
MDMA (ecstasy).   
 
The Psychoactive Substances Act came into effect in May 2016 and established a blanket ban 
across the UK on synthetic substances that simulate the effects of traditional illicit narcotics.  
The law created new powers for police to shut down illegal “headshops” and UK-based online 
dealers.  Alongside the legislation, the UK rolled out new education programs targeting at-risk 
youth and provided capacity-building training to local areas to help them prevent and respond to 
the use of these substances.  Since the passage of the legislation, the UK has arrested nearly 500 
individuals and shut down 332 headshops. 
 
Drug overdoses and deaths were at an all-time high within the UK in 2017, and many of these 
can be attributed to opioids.  Fentanyl has been responsible for approximately 60 deaths in the 
UK since late 2016, and use of the drug appears to be growing in the UK, though not on the scale 
as in the United States and some other countries.  As in the United States, most fentanyl and 
fentanyl analogues are manufactured in China and purchased on restricted internet sites.  Heroin 
purity is generally higher in the UK than in the United States, and there is far less prescription 
opioid abuse in the UK, which may limit fentanyl’s popularity.   
 
The United States and the United Kingdom enjoy an excellent bilateral relationship and 
cooperate closely on multilateral drug enforcement efforts.  The United States and UK have a 
memorandum of understanding allowing U.S. Coast Guard Law Enforcement teams and 
Airborne Use of Force Detachments to operate from the platforms of UK naval vessels in the 
Caribbean.  The United States continues to conduct coordinated drug trafficking and money 
laundering investigations with the UK National Crime Agency and Metropolitan Police Service, 
as well as Police Scotland, the Police Services of Northern Ireland, and other UK law 
enforcement agencies.  The United States has provided lead information on drug shipments 
bound for the UK, including couriers, parcels, and containerized cargo.

Uzbekistan 
 
Uzbekistan remains a significant transit country for Afghan opiates.  Traffickers exploit the 
country’s shared borders with Afghanistan and Tajikistan to smuggle illicit drugs through 
Uzbekistan primarily to Russia and Europe.  Traffickers capitalize on Uzbekistan’s 
infrastructure, corruption, and rugged border terrain.  The lengthy border with Tajikistan presents 
Uzbekistan’s biggest challenge to interdicting illicit drugs.  
 
Uzbekistan is not a significant producer of illicit drugs based on international assessments, 
including by the UN Office on Drugs and Crime (UNODC).  On an annual basis, Uzbekistan 
conducts a “Black Poppy” eradication campaign to destroy illicitly cultivated opium poppy and 
cannabis.  In 2016, the last year for which information is available, authorities uncovered 1,070 
cases of illegal drug cultivation and eradicated an aggregate cultivated area of approximately half 
a hectare.  
 
During the first six months of 2017, Uzbek law enforcement opened 2,995 criminal cases related 
to illicit drugs; made 2,154 arrests; and seized a total of 1,088 kilograms (kg) of illegal drugs.  
From this total volume, 766.2 kg of opium were seized, as well as 251.7 kg of cannabis, 60.5 kg 
of hashish, 10.2 kg of heroin, and 348 grams of new psychoactive substances.  As was the case 
with other Central Asian republics, the reported amounts of seized opium, hashish, and heroin 
were significantly less than the respective amounts reportedly seized over the first six months of 
2016.  
 
Uzbekistan’s drug control cooperation with the United States and international partners is 
limited.  Uzbekistan is a full member of the Central Asia Regional Information and Coordination 
Center (CARICC) and participates in regional UNODC and European Union-sponsored drug 
demand reduction and border control programs.  It has also signed cooperation agreements with 
other Central Asian countries, Russia, Latvia, the Czech Republic, Japan, and China.  The United 
States has provided training and equipment to assist the Uzbek government to modernize its 
border crossing checkpoints, improve forensic capabilities, develop its judicial institutions, and 
enhance the effectiveness of its law enforcement agencies.  The U.S. Drug Enforcement 
Administration (DEA) has agreements in place with Uzbek law enforcement agencies to allow 
joint investigations and intelligence exchanges, but these agreements have not translated into 
significant operational cooperation.  In 2017, DEA closed its office in Tashkent but plans to 
maintain liaison and provide training administered from the regional DEA office in Almaty, 
Kazakhstan.  
 
Given the lack of independent data on drug use and trafficking within the country, it is difficult 
to estimate the true extent of the problem and whether or not Uzbekistan’s low seizure statistics 
accurately reflect law enforcement efficacy.

Venezuela 
 
A.  Introduction 
 
Venezuela remained a major transit country for illicit drug trafficking in 2017.  Due to its porous 
western border with Colombia, current economic crisis, weak judicial system, sporadic 
international drug control cooperation, and permissive and corrupt environment, the country is a 
preferred trafficking route for illicit drugs, predominantly cocaine, from South America to the 
Caribbean region, Central America, the United States, Western Africa, and Europe.  
 
There is insufficient data to determine current drug consumption trends within Venezuela, but 
marijuana is believed to be the most commonly consumed illicit drug, followed by crack cocaine 
and “basuco” (cocaine paste).  
 
Limited coca cultivation occurs along Venezuela’s border with Colombia.  Some precursor 
chemicals used to produce cocaine are trafficked through Venezuela, but the quantity is 
unknown.  In 2017, Venezuelan authorities did not release statistics on seizures of drug labs or 
precursor chemicals.  The Venezuelan government has not reported the production of new 
psychoactive substances or other synthetic drugs within Venezuela.  
 
In 2017, the President of the United States determined Venezuela failed demonstrably to adhere 
to its obligations under international counternarcotics agreements.  In 2017, the Venezuelan 
government engaged in minimal bilateral law enforcement cooperation with the United States.  
Venezuelan authorities do not effectively prosecute drug traffickers, in part due to political 
corruption.  Additionally, Venezuelan law enforcement officers lack the equipment, training, and 
resources required to significantly impede the operations of major drug trafficking organizations.  
  
B.  Drug Control Accomplishments, Policies, and Trends 
  
 
1.  Institutional Development 
 
In 2013, the Venezuelan National Anti-Narcotics Office (ONA) developed a National Anti-Drug 
Plan for 2015-2019 that sought to reduce drug consumption and increase prevention activities.  
ONA reported it worked closely with civil society to provide anti-drug education training and 
athletic programming in different areas of the country to increase awareness and prevent 
consumption.  ONA has the legal authority to seize the assets of individuals connected with drug 
trafficking.  
 
Despite a nearly 134 percent increase in coca cultivation and a more than 200 percent increase in 
potential pure cocaine production in neighboring Colombia from 2013 to 2016, ONA reported 
seizing only 32 metric tons (MT) of drugs during the first six months of 2016 (the most recent 
year for which data provided by ONA is available), compared to 66 MT of illegal drugs seized 
during the first eight months of 2015.  Of those drug seizures, 60 percent occurred in Zulia state, 
located in northwest Venezuela along the Colombian border.  According to the National Guard’s 
(GNB) official website, the GNB seized 2.03 MT of cocaine and 1.04 MT of marijuana during 
the first 10 months of 2017.  In 2016, the most recent year for which data is available, the Public

Ministry reported investigating over 19,761 individuals for suspected drug crimes, leading to 
formal charges against 10,521.  
 
In 2004, the United States and Venezuela entered into a mutual legal assistance treaty pledging 
both countries to cooperate in investigating, prosecuting, preventing, and suppressing crime, 
including drug trafficking.  While Venezuela and the United States have had a bilateral 
Counternarcotics Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) since 1978, drug control cooperation 
between Venezuela and the United States has been very limited and inconsistent since 2005, 
when Venezuela refused to sign a negotiated addendum to the MOU to improve anti-drug 
cooperation.  
 
In 1997, the U.S. and Venezuelan governments updated a customs mutual assistance agreement 
and a 1991 bilateral maritime counterdrug agreement that authorizes U.S. officials to board 
Venezuelan flagged vessels suspected of trafficking drugs in international waters, as long as the 
Venezuelan government permits the search.  
 
Venezuela is party to the Inter-American Convention against Terrorism, the Inter-American 
Convention against Corruption, and the Inter-American Convention on Mutual Assistance in 
Criminal Matters.  Venezuela remains an active member of the Inter-American Drug Abuse 
Control Commission.  
 
The United States and Venezuela are parties to an extradition treaty that entered into force in 
1923.  Although the 1999 Venezuelan constitution bars the extradition of Venezuelan nationals, 
Venezuela occasionally expels or deports non-Venezuelan fugitives either directly to the United 
States or to third countries from which they can be extradited to the United States for 
prosecution. 
  
 
2.  Supply Reduction 
 
Venezuela remains a major transit country for cocaine shipments via aerial, terrestrial, and 
maritime routes.  Most flights suspected of trafficking narcotics depart from Venezuelan states 
bordering Colombia.  Trafficking by maritime conveyance includes the use of large cargo 
containers, fishing vessels, and “go-fast” boats, and there were some indications that maritime 
trafficking from Venezuela may have increased in 2017.  
 
Illicit narcotics that transited Venezuela in 2017 were destined for the Caribbean, Central 
America, the United States, West Africa, and Europe.  Colombian drug-trafficking organizations 
facilitate the transshipment of illicit drugs through Venezuela.  According to media reports, 
Mexican drug-trafficking organizations also maintain a presence in Venezuela.  
 
The Venezuelan government occasionally reports drug seizures, arrests, and destruction of drugs 
and airstrips to the public.  Venezuela is not a member of the Cooperative Situational 
Information Integration System, through which countries predetermine some information to 
share with the United States.  Venezuelan authorities similarly did not share evidence about the 
destruction of illicit drugs with U.S. officials.  In August 2017, Venezuelan law enforcement 
officials reported seizing two cocaine processing labs in Zulia along the Colombian border.

3.  Public Information, Prevention, and Treatment 
 
The consumption of illicit drugs in Venezuela remained opaque in 2017, since recent statistical 
data is unavailable.  The most recent data on domestic drug consumption in Venezuela was 
provided by the UN Office on Drugs and Crime in 2011, which noted that cocaine and cannabis 
use among adults was 6.4 percent and 1.56 percent, respectively.  Use of synthetic drugs and 
opioids is less frequent.  
 
ONA implemented a National Treatment System in 2013 as a nationwide program to treat 
substance use disorder.  The system uses professional care for detoxification and social 
reinsertion of those suffering from substance use disorders through a three-level program that 
includes the Center of Family Guidance, the Specialized Center for Prevention and 
Comprehensive Assistance, and the Socialist Therapeutic Community.  At that time, ONA 
reported 37,549 individuals in treatment facilities along with 3,032 family members.  ONA has 
not released any new figures since 2013.  
 
 
4.  Corruption 
 
Public corruption is a major problem in Venezuela that enables drug trafficking organizations to 
move and smuggle illegal drugs.  President Maduro declared a National Economic Emergency 
and granted himself decree powers in January 2016, which included goals of combatting 
corruption and defending Venezuela from a variety of threats.  The National Assembly (NA) 
refused to endorse the emergency decree or the subsequent requests for extension.  The Supreme 
Court annulled the NA’s decision and at the end of 2017, the emergency decree remained in 
effect.  The government did not release updated statistics, and there is no evidence that measures 
authorized under the decree have been effective tools to combat corruption.  
 
Two nephews of Venezuelan first lady Cilia Flores, Efrain Campo Flores and Francisco Flores 
de Freitas, were arrested in Port-au-Prince, Haiti, in November 2015 and expelled to the United 
States.  In November 2016, a federal court in New York convicted both nephews of conspiracy 
to traffic 800 kilograms of cocaine to the United States.  In 2017, the nephews were unsuccessful 
in overturning their convictions on appeal.  
 
In 2017, the U.S. Department of Treasury designated Venezuelan Vice President and former 
Aragua state Governor and Minister of the Interior Tarek El Aissami and his business associate 
Samark Lopez Bello as “Specially Designated National and Blocked Persons (SDN)” under the 
Foreign Narcotics Kingpin Designation Act (Kingpin Act) for collaborating with Mexican drug 
cartels and facilitating multiple shipments of drugs from Venezuela to the United States and 
Mexico.  The Venezuelan government has yet to take action against these or other government 
and military officials with known links to the FARC or the Mexican cartels.  President Maduro 
called the sanctions designation a “foreign plot to destabilize their government.”  
 
In 2013, the U.S. Department of the Treasury added Vassyly Kotosky Villarroel-Ramirez, a 
former captain in the Venezuelan National Guard, to the SDN list.  The Venezuelan National 
Guard reported the arrest of Villarroel-Ramirez in July of 2015.

The 2010 Organic Law on Drugs imposes penalties ranging from eight to 18 years in prison for 
military and security officials convicted of participating in or facilitating drug trafficking. 
  
C.  National Goals, Bilateral Cooperation, and U.S. Policy Initiatives 
 
Drug control cooperation between Venezuela and the United States has been limited and 
inconsistent since 2005, when Venezuela refused to sign a negotiated addendum to the MOU to 
improve cooperation.  After participating for the last three years, Venezuela did not attend the 
2017 International Drug Enforcement Conference.  The United States and Venezuela continue to 
exercise a 1991 maritime bilateral agreement allowing for each country to board vessels of the 
opposite flag suspected of illicit drug trafficking in international waters.  In 2016, the 
Venezuelan government cooperated with the United States Coast Guard in six documented 
maritime drug interdiction cases, compared to 10 cases in 2015, two cases in 2014, 10 cases in 
2013, and five cases in 2012.  
  
D.  Conclusion 
 
Venezuela failed to make demonstrable efforts to combat illegal drug activity in 2017.  The 
government was often complicit in the country’s rampant corruption and made minimal efforts to 
prosecute corrupt officials or suspected drug traffickers.  The Venezuelan government repeatedly 
defended and celebrated the achievements of officials the United States Department of the 
Treasury sanctioned for corruption or drug-trafficking.  With the exception of regularly granting 
boarding rights to Venezuelan-flagged vessels detained on the high seas by the U.S. Coast 
Guard, the Venezuelan government consistently rebuffed meaningful engagement.  To advance 
cooperation, the Venezuelan government could increase the exchange of information to 
ultimately lead to more drug-related arrests, dismantle organized criminal networks, prosecute 
criminals engaged in narcotics trafficking, and stem the flow of illicit drugs transiting Venezuela.  
However, the Venezuelan government continues to show a complete lack of will.

Vietnam 
 
A.  Introduction 
 
Vietnam is not a significant source or transit country for illicit drugs entering the United States, 
but remains a significant transshipment point for international criminal organizations that traffic 
heroin, amphetamine-type stimulants (ATS), and cocaine to markets throughout East Asia and 
the Pacific.  Historically, the cultivation and production of illicit drugs within Vietnam has been 
uncommon, but investigations conducted by the Vietnamese police in 2017 indicate that 
production of ATS is increasing. 
 
The Government of Vietnam reports that approximately 90 percent of the illicit drugs seized in 
the country originate in Laos, Cambodia, Burma, and China and are smuggled into the country 
via overland routes.  Lesser volumes of illegal drugs are smuggled through Vietnam via sea and 
air routes by use of human couriers and commercial cargo services.  Vietnam’s drug interdiction 
capacities are limited by poor equipment and training, as well as the rugged and remote terrain 
that defines much of the country’s borders.   
 
Heroin remains the most commonly trafficked and abused illegal drug in the country, with 
persons addicted to heroin accounting for approximately 73 percent of the country’s registered 
users.  ATS is commonly available in both pill form and crystal methamphetamine and is the 
second most commonly trafficked and abused drug.  From 2016 to 2017, the cost of crystal 
methamphetamine in Vietnam continued to decline, signifying increasing availability.  Cocaine 
trafficking and use is increasing in Vietnam, and Vietnamese police are arresting an increasing 
number of cocaine couriers with ties to international drug trafficking organizations operating 
through Vietnam’s international airports.   
 
B.  Drug Control Accomplishments, Policies, and Trends 
 
1. Institutional Development   
 
In 2017, Vietnam’s prime minister allocated $95 million through 2020 to support drug control 
and drug prevention, and the country continued to implement its 2011 comprehensive anti-drug 
strategy.  Vietnam works with neighboring countries to carry out interdiction operations, with 
border liaison offices situated along the country’s borders with China, Laos and Cambodia.  The 
United States promotes counter-drug information sharing, coordination of operations, and 
capacity building with Vietnam’s Ministry of Public Security. 
 
Despite this, several factors still significantly inhibit Vietnam’s ability to effectively investigate 
and prosecute drug trafficking organizations.  Vietnam’s counternarcotics police receive little to 
no formal training, and lack the resources necessary to conduct complex investigations.  
Furthermore, Vietnam’s penal code lacks a conspiracy statute and prohibits the introduction of 
many types of evidence normally used to prosecute complex organized crime cases. 
 
Vietnam does not have a mutual legal assistance or an extradition treaty with the United States.  
The decision to engage bilaterally with the United States on international drug trafficking

investigations is made on a case-by-case basis in accordance with a memorandum of 
understanding between the U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) and Vietnam’s 
Ministry of Public Security.  
 
 
2.  Supply Reduction   
 
According to the Government of Vietnam, in 2016, Vietnamese police investigated 
approximately 19,333 drug related cases and arrested 29,963 people involved in drug related 
crimes.  According to official Government of Vietnam statistics, during the first six months of 
2017, Vietnamese police investigated approximately 11,834 drug related cases and arrested 
17,680 people involved in drug related crimes, representing an approximate 22 percent increase 
in investigations and 20 percent increase in arrests over the same period in 2016.  During this 
same six-month period, Vietnamese police seized 442 kilograms (kg) of heroin; 82 kg of opium; 
85 kg of cannabis; 779 kg of ATS and other synthetic drugs; 347,900 ATS tablets; 1.6 kg of 
cocaine; and 5,600 kg of khat.   
 
Synthetic drug production is rare in Vietnam, as there is a ready supply of synthetic drugs 
entering Vietnam from neighboring countries.  However, in the first six months of 2017, the 
Vietnamese police dismantled a nation-wide drug trafficking organization that operated 13 
clandestine ATS laboratories throughout southern Vietnam that produced an estimated 300 kg of 
ATS tablets per month.   
 
 
3.  Public Information, Prevention, and Treatment   
 
The Government of Vietnam promotes and funds drug abuse and awareness programs as part of 
its comprehensive anti-drug strategy.  However, the willingness of Vietnamese citizens to seek 
drug abuse treatment is limited by the fear of involuntary incarceration in “drug rehabilitation 
centers,” which, in reality, are no different than prisons and provide minimal actual treatment for 
addiction. 
 
In 2016, the United States budgeted $1.6 million to support medication assisted therapy for more 
than 15,000 patients, both to prevent HIV transmission and to improve treatment outcomes 
among intravenous drug users.  Despite this support, the Government of Vietnam reports that the 
total number of registered heroin and ATS users rose 5.4 percent between 2015 and 2016, to 
222,236 people.  The Government of Vietnam also reports that approximately 33 percent of 
HIV-positive patients in Vietnam contracted the disease as a result of intravenous drug abuse. 
 
 
4.  Corruption  
 
Corruption is endemic in Vietnam and plagues almost every sector of the government.  However, 
there is no information that senior counternarcotics officials are directly involved in corruption 
that impacts their ability to pursue an aggressive drug control agenda, and there are no 
indications that drug-related corruption is widespread in Vietnam. 
  
C.  National Goals, Bilateral Cooperation, and U.S. Policy Initiatives 
 


INCSR 2018 Volume 1  
 
 
 
 
Country Reports 
288 
 
Vietnamese police continued to expand their cooperation with foreign governments in 2017 to 
combat regional drug trafficking, particularly with China, Laos, and Cambodia.  The Vietnamese 
police also collaborated closely with Australian and U.S. law enforcement authorities to target 
international drug trafficking organizations.  In 2016, Vietnam’s Ministry of Public Security 
renewed its memorandum of understanding with DEA.  As a result, in 2016 and 2017, 
information-sharing expanded dramatically between DEA and Vietnam’s law enforcement 
authorities and the number of coordinated U.S.-Vietnamese investigations increased 
significantly. 
 
Beginning in 2016, the United States initiated a comprehensive, four-year assistance program to 
strengthen the capacity of Vietnam’s drug enforcement police.  The program is designed to 
create a cadre of 100 subject matter experts on drug trafficking investigations within the 
Vietnamese police force. 
 
D.  Conclusion 
 
Vietnam continues to struggle with controlling drug trafficking and abuse, but maintains an 
aggressive posture against drug trafficking organizations.  Senior law enforcement officers 
continue to maintain support for increased engagement with the United States on both 
investigations and capacity building.  Barring any significant policy shifts, Vietnam’s law 
enforcement capacity is poised to continue to grow and professionalize with international 
support.  The United States encourages the Government of Vietnam to consider taking additional 
steps to modernize and expand its capacity to provide treatment and rehabilitation programs for 
those suffering from substance use disorders.

Legislative Basis for the INCSR 
 
The Department of State’s International Narcotics Control Strategy Report (INCSR) has been 
prepared in accordance with section 489 of the Foreign Assistance Act of 1961, as amended (the 
"FAA," 22 U.S.C. § 2291).  The 2019 INCSR, published in March 2019, covers the year January 
1 to December 31, 2018 and is published in two volumes, the second of which covers money 
laundering and financial crimes.  In addition to addressing the reporting requirements of section 
489 of the FAA (as well as sections 481(d)(2) and 484(c) of the FAA and section 804 of the 
Narcotics Control Trade Act of 1974, as amended), the INCSR provides the factual basis for the 
designations contained in the President’s report to Congress on the major drug-transit or major 
illicit drug producing countries initially set forth in section 591 of the Kenneth M. Ludden 
Foreign Operations, Export Financing, and Related Programs Appropriations Act, 2002 (P.L. 
107-115) (the "FOAA"), and now made permanent pursuant to section 706 of the Foreign 
Relations Authorization Act, Fiscal Year 2003 (P.L. 107-228) (the "FRAA").   
 
Section 706 of the FRAA requires that the President submit an annual report no later than 
September 15 identifying each country determined by the President to be a major drug-transit 
country or major illicit drug producing country.  The President is also required in that report to 
identify any country on the majors list that has "failed demonstrably . . . to make substantial 
efforts" during the previous 12 months to adhere to international counternarcotics agreements 
and to take certain counternarcotics measures set forth in U.S. law.  U.S. assistance under the 
current foreign operations appropriations act may not be provided to any country designated as 
having "failed demonstrably" unless the President determines that the provision of such 
assistance is vital to U.S. national interests or that the country, at any time after the President’s 
initial report to Congress, has made "substantial efforts" to comply with the counternarcotics 
conditions in the legislation.  This prohibition does not affect humanitarian, counternarcotics, 
and certain other types of assistance that are authorized to be provided notwithstanding any other 
provision of law.  
 
The FAA requires a report on the extent to which each country or entity that received assistance 
under chapter 8 of Part I of the Foreign Assistance Act in the past two fiscal years has "met the 
goals and objectives of the United Nations Convention Against Illicit Traffic in Narcotic Drugs 
and Psychotropic Substances (the "1988 UN Drug Convention").”  
 
Beginning in 2007, pursuant to The Combat Methamphetamine Enforcement Act (CMEA) (The 
USA Patriot Improvement and Reauthorization Act 2005, Title VII, P.L. 109-177), amending 
sections 489 and 490 of the Foreign Assistance Act (22 USC 2291h and 2291) section 722, the 
INCSR was expanded to include reporting on the five countries that export the largest amounts 
of methamphetamine precursor chemicals, as well as the five countries importing the largest 
amounts of these chemicals and which have the highest rate of diversion of the chemicals for 
methamphetamine production.  This expanded reporting also includes additional information on 
efforts to control methamphetamine precursor chemicals, as well as estimates of legitimate 
demand for these methamphetamine precursors, prepared by most parties to the 1988 UN Drug 
Convention and submitted to the International Narcotics Control Board.  The CMEA also 
requires a Presidential determination by March 1 of each year on whether the five countries that 
legally exported and the five countries that legally imported the largest amount of precursor

chemicals (under FAA section 490) have cooperated with the United States to prevent these 
substances from being used to produce methamphetamine or have taken adequate steps on their 
own to achieve full compliance with the 1988 UN Drug Control Convention.  This determination 
may be exercised by the Secretary of State pursuant to Executive Order 12163 and by the Deputy 
Secretary of State pursuant to State Department Delegation of Authority 245-2. 
 
Although the Convention does not contain a list of goals and objectives, it does set forth a 
number of obligations that the parties agree to undertake.  Generally speaking, it requires the 
parties to take legal measures to outlaw and punish all forms of illicit drug production, 
trafficking, and drug money laundering; to control chemicals that can be used to process illicit 
drugs; and to cooperate in international efforts to these ends.  The statute lists actions by foreign 
countries on the following issues as relevant to evaluating performance under the 1988 UN Drug 
Convention: illicit cultivation, production, distribution, sale, transport and financing, and money 
laundering, asset seizure, extradition, mutual legal assistance, law enforcement and transit 
cooperation, precursor chemical control, and demand reduction.  
 
In attempting to evaluate whether countries and certain entities are meeting the goals and 
objectives of the 1988 UN Drug Convention, the Department has used the best information it has 
available.  The 2019 INCSR covers countries that range from major drug producing and drug-
transit countries, where drug control is a critical element of national policy, to small countries or 
entities where drug issues or the capacity to deal with them are minimal.  The reports vary in the 
extent of their coverage.  For key drug-control countries, where considerable information is 
available, comprehensive reports are provided.  For some smaller countries or entities where 
only limited information is available, reports include whatever data the responsible U.S. 
diplomatic mission could provide.  
 
The country chapters report upon actions taken – including plans, programs, and, where 
applicable, timetables – toward fulfillment of Convention obligations.  Because the 1988 UN 
Drug Convention’s subject matter is so broad and availability of information on elements related 
to performance under the Convention varies widely within and among countries, the 
Department’s views on the extent to which a given country or entity is meeting the goals and 
objectives of the Convention are based on the overall response of the country or entity to those 
goals and objectives.  Reports will often include discussion of foreign legal and regulatory 
structures.  Although the Department strives to provide accurate information, this report should 
not be used as the basis for determining legal rights or obligations under U.S. or foreign law.  
 
Some countries and other entities are not yet parties to the 1988 UN Drug Convention; some do 
not have status in the United Nations and cannot become parties.  For such countries or entities, 
we have nonetheless considered actions taken by those countries or entities in areas covered by 
the Convention as well as plans (if any) for becoming parties and for bringing their legislation 
into conformity with the Convention’s requirements.  Other countries have taken reservations, 
declarations, or understandings to the 1988 UN Drug Convention or other relevant treaties; such 
reservations, declarations, or understandings are generally not detailed in this report.  For some 
of the smallest countries or entities that have not been designated by the President as major illicit 
drug producing or major drug-transit countries, the Department has insufficient information to 
make a judgment as to whether the goals and objectives of the Convention are being met.

Major Illicit Drug Producing, Drug-Transit, Significant Source, 
Precursor Chemical, and Money Laundering Countries  
 
Section 489(a)(3) of the FAA requires the INCSR to identify:  
(A) major illicit drug producing and major drug-transit countries;  
(B) major sources of precursor chemicals used in the production of illicit narcotics; or  
(C) major money laundering countries.  
These countries are identified below. 
 
Major Illicit Drug Producing and Major Drug-Transit Countries  
 
A major illicit drug producing country is one in which:  
(A) 1,000 hectares or more of illicit opium poppy is cultivated or harvested during a year;  
(B) 1,000 hectares or more of illicit coca is cultivated or harvested during a year; or  
(C) 5,000 hectares or more of illicit cannabis is cultivated or harvested during a year, unless the 
President determines that such illicit cannabis production does not significantly affect the United 
States.  [FAA § 481(e)(2)]  
A major drug-transit country is one:  
(A) that is a significant direct source of illicit narcotic or psychotropic drugs or other controlled 
substances significantly affecting the United States; or  
(B) through which are transported such drugs or substances. [FAA § 481(e)(5)]  
 
The following major illicit drug producing and/or drug-transit countries were identified and 
notified to Congress by the President on September 11, 2018, consistent with section 706(1) of 
the Foreign Relations Authorization Act, Fiscal Year 2003 (Public Law 107-228):  
 
Afghanistan, The Bahamas, Belize, Bolivia, Burma, Colombia, Costa Rica, Dominican 
Republic, Ecuador, El Salvador, Guatemala, Haiti, Honduras, India, Jamaica, Laos, 
Mexico, Nicaragua, Pakistan, Panama, Peru, and Venezuela.  
 
Of these 22 countries, Bolivia and Venezuela were designated by the President as having “failed 
demonstrably” during the previous 12 months to adhere to their obligations under international 
counternarcotics agreements and take the measures set forth in section 489(a)(1) of the FAA.  
The President determined, however, in accordance with provisions of Section 706(3)(A) of the 
FRAA, that continued support for bilateral programs to aid the people of Venezuela is vital to the 
national interests of the United States. 
 
Major Precursor Chemical Source Countries  
 
The following countries and jurisdictions have been identified to be major sources of precursor 
or essential chemicals used in the production of illicit narcotics:  
 
Afghanistan, Argentina, Bangladesh, Bolivia, Brazil, Burma, Canada, Chile, China, 
Colombia, Costa Rica, Dominican Republic, Ecuador, Egypt, El Salvador, Germany, 
Guatemala, Honduras, Hong Kong, India, Indonesia, Japan, Mexico, the Netherlands,

Nigeria, Pakistan, Peru, Poland, Republic of Korea, Singapore, South Africa, Switzerland, 
Taiwan, Thailand, the United Kingdom, and Venezuela.  
 
Information is provided pursuant to section 489 of the FAA in the section entitled "Chemical 
Controls." 
 
Major Money Laundering Countries  
 
A major money laundering country is defined by statute as one “whose financial institutions 
engage in currency transactions involving significant amounts of proceeds from international 
narcotics trafficking” [FAA § 481(e)(7)].  More information on the methodology is set forth in 
Volume II of the INCSR in the section entitled "Legislative Basis and Methodology for the 
INCSR."  The following countries/jurisdictions have been identified this year in this category:  
 
Afghanistan, Albania, Algeria, Antigua and Barbuda, Argentina, Armenia, Aruba, 
Azerbaijan, Bahamas, Barbados, Belgium, Belize, Benin, Bolivia, Bosnia and Herzegovina, 
Brazil, British Virgin Islands, Burma, Cabo Verde, Canada, Cayman Islands, China, 
Colombia, Costa Rica, Cuba, Curaçao, Cyprus, Dominica, Dominican Republic, Ecuador, 
El Salvador, Georgia, Ghana, Guatemala, Guyana, Haiti, Honduras, Hong Kong, India, 
Indonesia, Iran, Italy, Jamaica, Kazakhstan, Kenya, Laos, Liberia, Macau, Malaysia, 
Mexico, Morocco, Mozambique, Netherlands, Nicaragua, Nigeria, Pakistan, Panama, 
Paraguay, Peru, Philippines, Russia, Senegal, Serbia, St. Kitts and Nevis, St. Lucia, St. 
Vincent and the Grenadines, Sint Maarten Spain, Suriname, Tajikistan, Tanzania, 
Thailand, Trinidad and Tobago, Turkey, Ukraine, United Arab Emirates, United 
Kingdom, United States of America, Uzbekistan, Venezuela, and Vietnam. 
 
Further information on these countries/jurisdictions and United States money laundering 
policies, as required by section 489 of the FAA, is set forth in Volume II of the INCSR in the 
section entitled "Money Laundering and Financial Crimes."

Presidential Determination No. 2018-21806 
 
MEMORANDUM FOR THE SECRETARY OF STATE 
 
SUBJECT:  Presidential Determination on Major Drug Transit or Major Illicit Drug Producing 
Countries for Fiscal Year 2019 
 
By the authority vested to me as President by the Constitution and the laws of the United States, 
including Section 706(1) of the Foreign Relations Authorization Act, Fiscal Year 2003 (P.L. 
107-228) (FRAA), I hereby identify the following countries as major drug transit or major illicit 
drug producing countries:  Afghanistan, The Bahamas, Belize, Bolivia, Burma, Colombia, Costa 
Rica, Dominican Republic, Ecuador, El Salvador, Guatemala, Haiti, Honduras, India, Jamaica, 
Laos, Mexico, Nicaragua, Pakistan, Panama, Peru, and Venezuela. 
 
A country’s presence on the foregoing Majors List is not necessarily a reflection of its 
government’s counternarcotics efforts or level of cooperation with the United States.  Consistent 
with the statutory definition of a major drug transit or drug producing country set forth in section 
481(e) (2) and (5) of the Foreign Assistance Act of 1961, as amended (FAA), the reason major 
drug transit or illicit drug producing countries are placed on the list is the combination of 
geographic, commercial, and economic factors that allow drugs to transit or be produced, even if 
a government has engaged in robust and diligent narcotics control law enforcement measures. 
 
Pursuant to Section 706(2)(A) of the FRAA, I hereby designate Bolivia and Venezuela as 
countries that have failed demonstrably during the previous 12 months to adhere to their 
obligations under international counternarcotics agreements and take the measures set forth in 
section 489(a)(1) of the FAA.  Included with this determination are justifications for the 
designations of Bolivia and Venezuela, as required by Section 706(2)(B) of the FRAA.  I have 
also determined, in accordance with provisions of Section 706(3)(A) of the FRAA, that support 
for programs to aid the promotion of democracy in Venezuela are vital to the national interests of 
the United States. 
 
Combatting the ongoing United States opioid epidemic is one of my Administration’s most 
urgent priorities.  The Consolidated Appropriations Act of 2018, which I signed into law this 
spring, dedicated nearly $4 billion in additional funding to confront this national crisis.  My 
Administration is committed to addressing all factors fueling this drug crisis, which is 
devastating communities across America, including steps to curb over-prescription, expand 
access to treatment and recovery programs, improve public education programs to prevent illicit 
drug use before it begins, and to strengthening domestic drug enforcement at our borders and 
throughout our Nation.  Alongside these massive and historic United States efforts, I expect the

Introduction 
 
8 
 
governments of countries where illicit drugs originate and through which they transit to similarly 
strengthen their commitments to reduce dangerous drug production and trafficking. 
 
In this respect, I am deeply concerned that illicit drug crops have expanded over successive years 
in Colombia, Mexico, and Afghanistan, and are now at record levels.  Drug production and 
trafficking in these three countries directly affect United States national interests and the health 
and safety of American citizens.  Heroin originating in Mexico and cocaine from Colombia are 
claiming thousands of lives annually in the United States.  Afghanistan’s illicit opium economy 
promotes corruption, funds the Taliban, and undermines the country’s security, which thousands 
of United States service men and women help defend.  Despite the efforts of law enforcement 
and security forces, these countries are falling behind in the fight to eradicate illicit crops and 
reduce drug production and trafficking.  These governments must redouble their efforts to rise to 
the challenge posed by the criminal organizations producing and trafficking these drugs, and 
achieve greater progress over the coming year in stopping and reversing illicit drug production 
and trafficking.  The United States will continue its strong support for international efforts 
against drug production and trafficking, as well as to strengthen prevention and treatment efforts 
in the United States.  The urgency of our national drug epidemic requires significant and 
measurable results immediately, in the coming year and in the future.   
 
You are authorized and directed to submit this designation, with the Bolivia and Venezuela 
memoranda of justification, under Section 706 of the FRAA, to the Congress, and publish it in 
the Federal Register.

MEMORANDUM OF JUSTIFICATION FOR MAJOR ILLICIT 
DRUG TRANSIT OR ILLICIT DRUG PRODUCING 
COUNTRIES FOR FY 2019 
 
Bolivia 
 
During the past 12 months, the Bolivian government has failed demonstrably to make sufficient 
efforts to meet its obligations under the international counternarcotics agreements or to uphold 
the counternarcotics measures set forth in Section 489 (a)(1) of the Foreign Assistance Act 
(FAA) of 1961, as amended (FAA 
 
According to coca cultivation estimates from the United States government, the Government of 
Bolivia, and the UN Office on Drugs and Crime (UNODC), Bolivia remains the third largest 
producer of cocaine in the world.  It is also a major transit zone for Peruvian cocaine.  Cocaine 
cultivation in Bolivia continues to increase; the United States government estimated coca 
cultivation increased by three percent to 37,500 hectares (ha) in 2016 from 36,500 in 2015.  Per 
United States government estimates, potential pure cocaine production has more than doubled in 
Bolivia over the past decade, and increased eight percent to 275 metric tons from 2015 to 2016. 
 
In addition to excessive production levels, Bolivia’s inadequate controls over its legal markets 
are of concern.  Until 2017, Bolivian law permitted 12,000 hectares of licit coca production per 
year.  In March 2017, President Evo Morales signed into law a bill that replaces Bolivia’s former 
counternarcotics law and nearly doubles those limits; the area available for licit coca production 
will increase from 12,000 to 22,000 hectares.  This exceeds the amount of coca needed for 
traditional purposes by 38 percent, according to a European Union (EU) estimate.  UNODC 
officials have estimated that 90 percent of the Chapare region’s coca cultivation is destined for 
illicit cocaine production and not traditional consumption. 
 
In 2013, Bolivia re-acceded to the 1961 U.N. Single Convention on Narcotic Drugs with a 
reservation permitting coca to be used only within Bolivia for traditional, cultural, and medicinal 
purposes.  Despite these stated conditions, Bolivia continues to promote the use of coca in other 
countries and discuss potential export opportunities for coca products.  These actions undermine 
Bolivia’s commitments to its international drug control obligations. 
 
As a matter of official policy, the Government of Bolivia does not encourage or facilitate illegal 
activity associated with drug trafficking.  President Morales and other senior officials have 
acknowledged serious corruption problems in the judiciary and police.  Approximately 60 police 
officers were investigated for corruption associated with drug trafficking in 2015, the most recent 
year for which data is available.  Corruption, interference by other branches of government, and 
insufficient judicial resources undermine due process and create delays in the administration of 
justice. 
 
Increased Bolivian counternarcotics cooperation with other countries and in international fora 
would be welcome.  Bolivia receives most of its foreign counternarcotic financial support from 
the European Union (EU).  The EU is currently implementing a three-year (2016-2018)

assistance program budgeted at $50 million, and also provides an additional $10 million to 
support UNODC drug control programs and technical assistance through a contractor.  The 
United States has not had a counternarcotics presence in Bolivia, but U.S. officials consult with 
international organizations and third-country governments involved in supporting Bolivian drug 
control goals and efforts to strengthen the rule of law.  A customs mutual assistance agreement 
between the Government of Bolivia and United States to foster improved information sharing 
was signed in July 2017, which permits information exchanges and collaboration to prevent 
illegal shipments and related criminal activities, including drug trafficking. 
 
Bolivia participated in the semi-annual Multilateral Maritime Counter Drug Summit held in 
November 2017, which attracted 125 maritime counterdrug professionals from nearly 25 
countries and over 65 international agencies spanning North, Central and South America, and 
Europe.  The United States and Bolivia are parties to a 1995 extradition treaty that permits the 
extradition of nationals for the most serious offenses, including drug trafficking.  Bolivia and the 
United States do not have a mutual legal assistance treaty, but both countries can request 
assistance through various multilateral conventions to which both are parties. 
 
In accordance with United States legislation, the determination that Bolivia has failed 
demonstrably to make substantial efforts to adhere to its obligations under international 
counternarcotics agreements and to take counternarcotics measures set forth in the FAA results 
in the withholding of certain kinds of U.S. assistance, with exceptions for humanitarian and 
counternarcotics assistance under the FAA.  United States assistance to and relations with 
Bolivia are extremely limited.  It is not in the vital interest of the United States to grant a national 
interest waiver to Bolivia, given that any assistance necessitating such a waiver is neither 
contemplated by the United States, nor actively pursued by the Government of Bolivia.

MEMORANDUM OF JUSTIFICATION FOR MAJOR DRUG 
TRANSIT OR ILLICIT DRUG PRODUCING COUNTRIES FOR 
FY 2019 
 
Venezuela 
 
During the past 12 months, the Venezuelan government failed demonstrably to make sufficient 
efforts to meet its obligations under the international counternarcotics agreements or to uphold 
the counternarcotics measures set forth in section 489 (a)(1) of the Foreign Assistance Act of 
1961, as amended (FAA).  A national interest waiver for Fiscal Year 2019 for Venezuela permits 
support for United States government-funded bilateral assistance programs vital to the national 
interest of the United States, such as democracy building and human rights advocacy. 
 
Venezuela remained a major drug-transit country in 2018.  Venezuela is one of the preferred 
trafficking routes for illegal drugs, predominately cocaine, from South America to the Caribbean 
region, Central America, the United States, Western Africa, and Europe, due to its porous 
western border with Colombia, weak judicial system, sporadic international counternarcotics 
cooperation, and permissive and corrupt environment.   
 
Public corruption, including among senior government officials, is a major problem in 
Venezuela, making it easier for drug-trafficking organizations to smuggle illegal drugs.  The 
Venezuelan government, as a matter of policy, does not encourage or facilitate illicit drug 
production or distribution, nor does it condone laundering the proceeds of the sale of illicit drugs; 
however, the Maduro regime knowingly maintains a United States designated Narcotics Kingpin 
in its Cabinet.  
 
On February 13, 2017, the United States designated Venezuelan Executive Vice President 
Tareck El Aissami pursuant to the Foreign Narcotics Kingpin Designation Act for his 
involvement in international narcotics trafficking activities.  El Aissami facilitated, coordinated, 
and protected other narcotics traffickers operating in Venezuela.  Specifically, El Aissami 
received payment for the facilitation of drug shipments belonging to Venezuelan drug kingpin 
Walid Makled Garcia.  El Aissami also is linked to coordinating drug shipments to Los Zetas, a 
violent Mexican drug cartel, as well as providing protection to Colombian drug lord Daniel 
Barrera Barrera and Venezuelan drug trafficker Hermagoras Gonzalez Polanco. 
 
In November 2016, nephews of Venezuelan first lady Cilia Flores, Efrain Campo Flores and 
Francisco Flores de Freitas, were convicted by a federal court in New York of conspiracy to 
traffic 800 kg of cocaine to the United States.  In 2017, the nephews were unsuccessful in 
overturning their convictions on appeal.  In August 2016, the United States unsealed indictments 
against General Nester Luis Reverol Torres, the former director of ONA and former commander 
of the National Guard, and Edylberto Jose Molina Molina, former sub-director of ONA, for 
participating in an international cocaine trafficking conspiracy.  Immediately following the U.S. 
indictments, President Nicolas Maduro appointed Reverol as Minister of Interior, Justice, and 
Peace, in which he is responsible for overseeing both ONA and the National Guard.    
 


INCSR 2019 Volume 1

In September 2015, the United States unsealed indictments against former Bolivarian 
Intelligence Service (SEBIN) chief of finance Pedro Luis Martin Olivares and former anti-drug 
official in the Scientific, Penal, and Criminal Investigative Corps (CICPC) Jesus Alfredo Itriago 
for alleged involvement in drug trafficking activities affecting the United States.  In 2013, the 
U.S. Department of the Treasury added Vassyly Kotosky Villarroel-Ramirez, a former captain in 
the Venezuelan National Guard, to the “Specially Designated National and Blocked Persons 
(SDN)” list under the Foreign Narcotics Kingpin Designation Act (Kingpin Act).  The 
Venezuelan National Guard reported the arrest of Villarroel-Ramirez in July of 2015. 
 
In 2008, the Treasury designated former Minister of Defense and current Trujillo state Governor, 
Henry Rangel Silva and Guárico state Governor Ramón Emilio Rodríguez Chacín as “Specially 
Designated Narcotics Traffickers” pursuant to the Foreign Narcotics Kingpin Designation Act 
for assisting the Fuerzas Armadas Revolucionarias de Colombia (FARC) in trafficking narcotics. 
 
The Venezuelan government has yet to take action against these or other government and 
military officials with known links to the FARC or Mexican drug cartels. 
 
In 2018, the Venezuelan government engaged in minimal bilateral law enforcement cooperation 
with the United States.  Venezuelan authorities do not effectively prosecute drug traffickers, in 
part due to political corruption.  Additionally, Venezuelan law enforcement officers lack the 
equipment, training, and resources required to significantly impede the operations of major drug 
trafficking organizations.  The Venezuelan government occasionally reports drug seizures, 
arrests, and destruction of drugs and airstrips to the public, but did not share evidence about the 
destruction of illicit drug with U.S. officials. 
 
Drug control cooperation between Venezuela and the United States has been limited and 
inconsistent since 2005, when Venezuela refused to sign a negotiated amendment to the U.S.-
Venezuela bilateral Letter of Agreement on drug control cooperation.  The United States and 
Venezuela have a bilateral agreement for counter drug operations.  The agreement enables both 
countries to stop, board, and search vessels flying the other’s flag.  Furthermore, this agreement 
enables direct case information sharing, and expedited vessel registry checks.  In 2016, the 
Venezuelan government cooperated with the United States Coast Guard in six documented 
maritime drug interdiction cases, compared to 10 cases in 2015.  Venezuela did not attend the 
2017 International Drug Enforcement Conference for the first time in four years. 
 
To advance cooperation with the United States, the Venezuelan government could increase the 
exchange of narcotics-related information to lead to more drug-related arrests, help dismantle 
criminal networks, aid in the prosecution of criminals engaged in narcotics trafficking, and stem 
the flow of illicit drugs transiting Venezuela. 
 
The United States and Venezuela are parties to an extradition treaty that entered into force in 
1923.  Although the 1999 Venezuelan constitution bars the extradition of Venezuelan nationals, 
Venezuela periodically extradites or deports non-Venezuelan nationals to the United States for 
prosecution.

Pursuant to Section 706 of the Foreign Relations Authorization Act of Fiscal Year 2003, FRAA, 
though Venezuela has failed demonstrably, a national interest waiver under the FRAA allows the

Overview 
 
Volume 1 of the 2019 International Narcotics Control Strategy Report provides an overview of 
actions taken during the previous year by the governments of nearly 70 countries to reduce illicit 
drug production, trafficking, and use.  This global challenge bears more direct impact on the 
health and safety of Americans than at any time in our history.  According to data from the 
Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, more than 70,000 people died in the United States 
from drug overdoses in 2017, making drug overdoses the leading cause of premature deaths in 
the country.  The vast majority of the illicit drugs responsible for these deaths originate outside 
the United States, placing drug supply and demand reduction among the most urgent U.S. 
foreign policy priorities. 
 
Opioids continue to fuel the majority of U.S. overdose deaths.  What began as a prescription 
drug problem and morphed into a heroin epidemic has shifted to misuse of highly potent 
synthetic opioids, particularly fentanyl and its analogues.  Synthetic opioids are frequently laced 
into heroin and other drugs, or pressed into counterfeit pills and sold to often unsuspecting users, 
adding to the risk of overdose.  These shifts have resulted in a staggering loss of American lives 
in recent years.  Deaths from synthetic opioids, primarily fentanyl, soared to nearly 30,000 in 
2017, up more than 45 percent from 2016.   
 
Trafficking in these drugs offers numerous advantages to criminals.  Synthetic drugs can be 
manufactured virtually anywhere, and production costs are low.  The extreme potency of 
synthetic opioids lets traffickers reap high profits from small volumes.  Criminals exploit the 
tools of global e-commerce to sell these drugs online directly to consumers and, due to their 
potency, small quantities of drugs can be delivered through the mail and express consignment 
services at minimal risk of detection.  Virtually any community with a postal address and internet 
connectivity is at risk, and what began in North America has metastasized into what the United 
Nations now calls “a global opioid epidemic.”    
 
Trafficking and abuse of synthetic opioids has become a top concern of governments across 
Africa, South Asia, and the Middle East, particularly involving counterfeit or illicitly 
manufactured tramadol.  Within the European Union, over three dozen new synthetic opioids 
have been detected since 2009, with 13 reported in 2017, including 10 fentanyl analogues.  This 
expansion is likely to continue, as traffickers adapt to outmaneuver regulatory controls and law 
enforcement efforts as they seek new markets.   
 
These are considerable challenges that will test the capacities, resourcefulness, and political will 
of the international community.  On September 24, 2018, President Trump launched the Global 
Call to Action on the World Drug Problem at the United Nations in New York City, where 130 
countries committed to take further action to address and counter the world drug problem, 
including the emerging threat of synthetic drugs.  Policies and legal frameworks developed to 
meet the drug control challenges of the previous century may require adjustments for the 21st 
century.  The United States and many countries, for example, have enacted legal reforms to 
control new psychoactive substances (NPS) based on their psychoactive effects or chemical 
similarity to controlled drugs, rather than precise chemical structures.  In December 2018, China 


INCSR 2019 Volume 1 
 
Policy and Program Developments 
 
16 
 
committed to control fentanyl compounds as a class.  Once implemented, this move should help 
thwart illicit chemists and manufacturers who quickly change their illicit formulations to non-
regulated analogues to evade law enforcement. 
 
Effective global responses will need to target all vulnerabilities in the supply chain exploited by 
criminals, including online trafficking facilitated by virtual currencies and other emerging 
technologies.  Further steps must also be taken to safeguard the integrity of international mail 
and express consignment services from criminal misuse, including the collection and sharing of 
advance electronic data to help identify suspicious parcels.  The United States is committed to 
deploying the full range of its diplomatic, law enforcement, and foreign assistance tools to 
facilitate global action in these areas and, by doing so, to increase the cost, risk, and difficulties 
associated with trafficking and misusing synthetic opioids and other NPS.     
 
While we adjust our posture to address these emerging 21st century threats, the United States will 
remain deeply engaged in working with partners to address traditional drug threats, particularly 
cocaine, heroin, and methamphetamine, which continue to inflict a heavy toll in the United 
States and many countries around the world.  Experts from the United Nations and other 
organizations have warned that surging production, trafficking, and use of methamphetamine in 
some South East Asian countries has reached crisis proportions.  Coca cultivation and cocaine 
production remains at historically high levels in Colombia, fueling rising use and overdose 
deaths in the United States and threatening Colombia’s efforts to establish enduring peace and 
security throughout its territory.  Opium poppy cultivation and heroin production remain rampant 
in Afghanistan, undermining stability and economic development and fueling the Taliban 
insurgency and corruption.  In Mexico, powerful transnational criminal organizations continue to 
reap billions of dollars in profits from controlling trafficking routes for methamphetamine, 
heroin, fentanyl, and cocaine into the United States, increasing corruption and violence.    
 
These are daunting challenges, and like-minded governments will need to continue working 
together in the years to come to reverse the tide.  Progress will also require further steps to 
reduce demand for illicit drugs, including through expanding access to evidence-based treatment 
and recovery programs, and improving programs to prevent illicit drug use before it begins.  The 
United States is committed to working through regional bodies, multilateral channels, and 
bilaterally with like-minded governments to promote coordinated international responses to 
address these challenges.

Demand Reduction 
 
Drug demand reduction is a key foreign policy tool for addressing the interconnected threats of 
drugs, crime, and violence.  The goal of demand reduction strategies calls for a comprehensive, 
balanced approach to the drug problem that targets prevention, treatment, recovery, research, and 
international cooperation.  
 
Recognizing that substance use is a major public health threat, and that drug use is a preventable 
and treatable disease, many countries are requesting INL-sponsored technical assistance to 
improve and develop effective policies aimed at reducing use.  INL works closely with 
international partners to coordinate and execute capacity building and training activities for 
service providers in drug prevention, treatment, and recovery.  INL also promotes the sharing of 
critical information and evidence-based studies to preserve the stability of societies threatened by 
the drug trade. 
 
The drug demand reduction program has four pillars: (1) develop the drug demand reduction 
workforce, (2) professionalize drug treatment, prevention, and recovery services, (3) build global 
networks and community coalitions, and (4) address populations with special clinical needs.  In 
achieving these objectives, INL supports the following: 
• Capacity building, training, mentoring, and credentialing aimed to educate governments, 
public organizations, and practitioners in the field on evidence-based practices in drug 
prevention, treatment and recovery; 
• Development of drug-free community coalitions internationally, involving law 
enforcement and public/private social institutions aimed at preventing drug use and its 
consequences; 
• Research, development, and outcome based evaluation efforts to determine the 
effectiveness of drug prevention and treatment programs; and  
• Development of innovative tools to increase knowledge of and decrease deaths caused by 
toxic adulterants found in illicit substances.  
 
Recognizing that there are populations with special clinical needs in the development and pattern 
of substance use disorders, INL supports technical assistance to address their unique treatment 
needs associated with substance use and related violence.   
 
Significant completed and ongoing INL-funded demand reduction projects for 2018 include: 
 
Universal Prevention Curriculum:  INL’s Universal Prevention Curriculum (UPC) consists of 
two series, one for coordinators/managers of prevention programs and one for prevention 
implementers/prevention workers.  This training program is based on the United Nations Office 
on Drugs and Crime (UNODC) Standards for Drug Use Prevention, offering innovative 
evidence-based approaches to drug prevention in a variety of settings such as family, school, 
workplace, media, and the community.  The development of examinations and an International 
Certified Prevention Specialist credential is in the process of being developed.  The effectiveness 
of the school-based program is currently being evaluated with INL support in collaboration with 
the Cayetano Heredia University in Lima, Peru.

Regional Treatment Training:  INL supports the work of the Colombo Plan, UNODC, and the 
Organization of American States to strengthen the workforce providing drug prevention, 
treatment and recovery services through intensive trainings and credentialing examinations at the 
national level.  These trainings improve the quality of services, helping prevent the initiation of 
drug use and improving treatment outcomes, lowering relapse rates, and generating overall 
greater confidence in the treatment system.  Through 2018, the curriculum has been disseminated 
in 56 countries – Afghanistan, Bahamas, Bangladesh, Benin, Bhutan, Botswana, Cambodia, 
Cameroon, Cote d’Ivoire, Egypt, Estonia, Ethiopia, Fiji, Gambia, Georgia, Ghana, Guatemala, 
India, Indonesia, Iraq, Japan, Kazakhstan, Kenya, Kyrgyzstan, Laos, Liberia, Madagascar, 
Malaysia, Maldives, Mexico, Mongolia, Mozambique, Myanmar, Namibia, Nepal, Nigeria, 
Niger, Pakistan, Peru, Philippines, Samoa, Senegal, Seychelles, South Africa, South Korea, Sri 
Lanka, Tajikistan, Tanzania, Thailand, Togo, Tunisia, Turkmenistan, Uganda, United Arab 
Emirates, Uzbekistan and Vietnam.   
 
Child Addiction Initiative:  INL is supporting the development of evidence-based training to 
establish effective and appropriate drug prevention and treatment practices to young children 
(aged 12 and under) exposed to drugs.  This initiative is in response to increasing reports of acute 
and growing substance use disorders among children in Asia, Africa and South America, where 
age-appropriate treatment may be unavailable or not scientifically sound.  Working with a panel 
of global child drug addiction experts, INL developed six child-focused psychosocial and 
pharmacological treatment training courses to serve as a tool to help strengthen international 
capacities in this field.  This program is being implemented through Colombo Plan and UNODC 
in collaboration with the University of North Carolina. 
 
Women’s Drug Treatment Initiatives:  INL supports research-based prevention, treatment, and 
recovery programs in high-risk countries to improve services for addicted women and their 
children, a chronically under-served and stigmatized population.  In 2018, INL redesigned its 
Guiding the Recovery of Women (GROW) curriculum addressing the unique needs of women 
with substance use disorders across the globe.  The first course of four of the new curriculum 
Women’s Interventions for Substance Exposure (WISE) completed its pilot testing in December 
2018 and will complete the remaining three courses in the spring of 2019 before it is peer 
reviewed and finalized.  
 
Alternatives to Incarceration:  The United Nations Special Session on Drugs Outcome 
Document and the U.S.-sponsored CND resolution in 2016 called on countries to support 
alternatives to incarceration and proportionate sentencing, especially for drug dependent, 
nonviolent offenders.  Alternatives to incarceration – including an emphasis on gaining access to 
drug treatment and care – can occur before an arrest, at an initial court hearing, within the jail, at 
re-entry and through community corrections such as probation.  In 2018, INL supported the 
development of training for policymakers and agency heads from both the public health sector 
and criminal justice sector to discuss critical areas of need within a particular country related to 
alternatives to incarceration.  The course was pilot tested in Jamaica in October and will also be 
pilot tested in Guyana in 2019 before undergoing a peer review process and finalization.

Intranasal Naloxone Feasibility Study:  In 2016, INL support to UNODC and the World 
Health Organization initiated a feasibility study (Stop Overdose Safely, or S-O-S) on community 
management of opioid overdoses, including the intranasal use of naloxone.  This study includes 
training for people likely to witness overdoses on how to correctly administer naloxone.  In 
2018, training was provided for trainers and researchers from Ukraine, Tajikistan, Kyrgyzstan, 
and Kazakhstan to prepare for country-wide roll outs of trainings and data collection. 
 
Development of the International Consortium of Universities for Drug Demand Reduction 
(ICUDDR):  In June 2018, INL and a consortium of international organization partners and 
universities from around the world held its third ICUDDR meeting in partnership with San Diego 
University in San Diego, with participation from representatives of 32 universities from 24 
countries.  The ICUDDR is a network of universities working together to promote academic 
programs in addition studies (drug prevention and treatment) to further the dissemination of 
evidence-based practices and develop the drug demand reduction workforce.  With INL support, 
ICUDDR membership grew by 565 percent in two years to 137 members in 47 countries.   
 
Drug-Free Communities:  INL assists civil society and grassroots organizations to form and 
sustain effective community anti-drug coalitions aimed at preventing substance use disorders in 
their communities.  INL support has resulted in the establishment of over 280 active coalitions 
consisting of over 6,700 volunteers in 23 countries around the world (Argentina, Brazil, Costa 
Rica, Dominican Republic, Ecuador, Honduras, Mexico, Paraguay, Peru, Uruguay, Cape Verde, 
Ghana, Kenya, Mauritius, Senegal, South Africa, Togo, Uganda, Kyrgyzstan, Tajikistan, 
Philippines, Indonesia, and Albania).

Methodology for U.S. Government Estimates of Illegal Drug 
Production 
 
Introduction 
 
Illicit drug crops are grown, refined into illegal drugs, trafficked, and sold on the street by 
criminal enterprises that attempt to conceal every step of the process.  Accurate estimates of such 
criminal activity are difficult to produce.  The estimates of illicit drug production presented in the 
INCSR represent the United States government’s best effort to assess the current dimensions of 
the international drug problem.  They are based on agricultural surveys conducted with satellite 
imagery and scientific studies of crop yields and the likely efficiency of typical illicit refining 
labs.  As we do every year, we publish these estimates with an important caveat: they are 
estimates.  While we must express our estimates as numbers, these numbers should not be seen 
as precise figures.  Rather, they represent the midpoint of a band of statistical probability that 
gets wider as additional variables are introduced and as we move from cultivation to harvest to 
final refined drug.  
 
As needed, the United States government revises its estimate process and occasionally the 
estimates themselves – in the light of field research and technological advancements.  The 
clandestine, violent nature of the illegal drug trade makes field research difficult.  Geography is 
also an impediment, as the harsh terrain on which many drugs are cultivated is not always easily 
accessible.  This is particularly relevant given the tremendous geographic areas that must be 
covered and the difficulty of collecting reliable information over diverse and treacherous terrain.  
Weather can affect our ability to gather data, particularly in the Andes, where cloud cover can be 
a major problem.   
 
Improved technologies and analytical techniques may also lead us to produce revisions to United 
States government estimates of potential drug production.  This is typical of annualized figures 
for most other areas of statistical tracking that must be revised year to year.  When possible, we 
apply these new techniques to previous years’ data and adjust appropriately, but often, especially 
in the case of new technologies, we can only apply them prospectively.  These illicit drug 
statistics represent the current state of the art.  As new information and technology becomes 
applicable, the accuracy of the estimates will improve. 
 
Cultivation Estimates 
 
The Unites States government conserves limited personnel and technical resources by employing 
sample survey methodologies to estimate illicit crop cultivation and concentrating survey efforts 
on areas with strategic amounts of illegal cultivation or areas most likely to have illicit crop 
cultivation.  Each year, analysts review a variety of datasets – including eradication data, seizure 
data, law enforcement investigations information, previous field locations, and other information 
– to determine areas likely to have illegal cultivation, and revise and update the search area, if 
necessary.  They then survey and estimate cultivation in new areas using proven statistical 
techniques. 
 


INCSR 2019 Volume 1 
 
Policy and Program Developments 
 
21 
 
The resulting estimates meet the U.S. government’s need for an annual estimate of illicit crop 
cultivation for each country.  They also help with eradication, interdiction, and other law 
enforcement operations.  As part of the effort to provide accurate and comprehensive 
assessments, the areas surveyed are often expanded and modified, so direct comparison with 
previous year estimates is sometimes not possible.   
 
Production Estimates 
 
Illicit crop productivity depends upon a number of factors.  Changes in weather, farming 
techniques, soil fertility, and disease prevalence can produce widely varying yields from year to 
year and place to place.  Some illicit drug crop areas are not easily accessible to the U.S. 
government, which can make scientific information difficult to obtain.  However, we continually 
strive to improve our drug production estimates.  The relative productivity of poppy crops in 
some cases can be estimated using imagery, and our confidence in coca leaf yield continues to 
improve as a result of field studies conducted in Latin America.  Coca fields which are less than 
18 months of age (“new fields”) produce much less leaf than mature fields.  In Colombia, for 
example, fields on average get their first small harvest at six months of age; in Bolivia and Peru, 
fields are usually first harvested at 12 months of age.  The U.S. government estimates include the 
proportion of new fields detected each year and adjust leaf production accordingly. 
 
Processing Estimates 
 
The wide variation in processing efficiency achieved by narcotics producers complicates the task 
of accurately assessing the quantity of cocaine or heroin that could be refined from a crop.  
Differences in the origin and quality of the raw material and chemicals used, the technical 
processing method employed, the size and sophistication of laboratories, the skill and experience 
of local workers and chemists, and decisions made in response to enforcement pressures all 
affect production.   
 
The U.S. government estimates for coca leaf, cocaine, marijuana, opium, and heroin production 
are potential estimates; that is, it is assumed that all of the coca, cannabis, and poppy grown is 
harvested and processed into illicit drugs.  This is a reasonable assumption for coca leaf in 
Colombia.  In Bolivia and Peru, however, the U.S. government potential cocaine production 
estimates do not remove for coca leaf locally chewed and used in products such as coca tea.  In 
Southwest and Southeast Asia and Latin America, it is not unrealistic to assume that virtually all 
poppy is harvested for opium gum, but substantial amounts of Asian opium are consumed or 
stored rather than being processed into heroin; the proportion of this opium ultimately processed 
into heroin is unknown. 
 
Other International Estimates 
 
The United States helps fund estimates done by the United Nations in some countries.  These 
estimates use different methodologies from the U.S. government assessments and utilize a mix of 
imagery and ground-based observations.  The UN estimates are often used to help determine the 
response of the international donor community to specific countries or regions.

There have been some efforts for the U.S. government and the UN to understand each other’s 
methodologies with the goal of improving both sets of estimates.  These efforts are ongoing. 
 
This report also includes data on drug production, trafficking, seizures, and consumption that 
come from host governments or non-governmental organizations.  Such data is attributed to the 
source organization, especially when we cannot independently verify it.

*Not included on this list is the “State of Palestine,” which, according to the United Nations, has 
purportedly acceded to the UN Convention against Corruption (2014), to the UN Convention 
against Transnational Organized Crime (2015), and to the 1988 UN Drug Convention (December 
29, 2017).  The Government of the United States of America notified the United Nations that it 
does not believe the “State of Palestine” qualifies as a sovereign state and does not recognize it 
as such.  Therefore, the Government of the United States of America believes that the “State of 
Palestine” is not qualified to accede to the Conventions and does not believe that it is in a treaty 
relationship with the “State of Palestine” under the Conventions.

International Training 
 
International counternarcotics training is managed and funded by the U.S. Department of State’s 
Bureau of International Narcotics and Law Enforcement Affairs (INL), and implemented by 
various U.S. law enforcement organizations including the Drug Enforcement Administration 
(DEA), the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI), Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE), 
U.S. Customs and Border Patrol (CBP), and U.S. Coast Guard.  Major objectives are: 
 
•  Contributing to enhanced professionalism of the basic rule of law infrastructure for carrying 
out counternarcotics law enforcement activities in countries which cooperate with and are 
considered significant to U.S. narcotics control efforts; 
 
•  Improving technical skills of drug law enforcement personnel in these countries; and 
 
•  Increasing cooperation between U.S. and foreign law enforcement officials. 
 
INL-funded training supports U.S. counternarcotics priorities worldwide, and focuses on 
encouraging foreign law enforcement agency self-sufficiency.  The overarching goal of U.S. 
counternarcotics training is to support the development of effective host country enforcement 
institutions, capable of removing drugs from circulation before they can reach the United States.  
U.S training can take two forms: as part of a planned bilateral assistance program in target 
partner countries; and as regional training with international participants from multiple countries.  
The regional training provided at International Law Enforcement Academies (ILEAs) consists of 
both general law enforcement training as well as specialized training for mid-level managers in 
police and other law enforcement agencies. 
 
U.S. bilateral training assistance program works closely with international organizations 
including the UN Office on Drugs and Crime (UNODC) and the Organization of American 
States.  The United States coordinates assistance planning with other donors through 
mechanisms such as the Dublin Group (an informal body of countries and organizations that 
provide law enforcement training), and the Paris Pact (an informal network of states dedicated to 
stopping the spread of Afghan opiates).  The United States continuously works to promote 
burden-sharing with our allies in the provision of training, as well as ensuring that our respective 
efforts are complementary and directed towards common goals. 
 
International Law Enforcement Academies (ILEAs) 
 
The International Law Enforcement Academies (ILEAs) pursue three core objectives:  building 
the capacity of foreign criminal justice partners of the United States to stop crime before it 
impacts the United States; fostering partnerships across national borders within important 
regions of the world; and advancing partner nations’ engagement with U.S. law enforcement 
agencies.  These academies are an important part of the interagency U.S. effort to combat 
transnational criminal organizations.  
   
Since the first ILEA opened in Budapest in 1995, the program has grown to six facilities 
worldwide, and has provided training to approximately 70,000 students in from countries in 


INCSR 2019 Volume 1

Africa, Europe, Asia, and across Latin America.  The ILEA program hosts approximately 150 
courses per year.  The program implements a number of key programming initiatives including 
an anti-corruption course series, courses focused on countering violent extremism, and 
executive-level symposiums on combating transnational criminal organizations.  Training 
includes specialized skill development and tactics in law enforcement areas such as 
counternarcotics; investigating money laundering and financial crimes; cybercrime 
investigations; border control; and countering all forms of trafficking including weapons, 
wildlife, and trafficking in persons.  ILEA also works with senior officers and administrators on 
principles of leadership and effective management at ILEA Roswell.  The ILEAs help to develop 
an extensive network of alumni who exchange information with their regional and U.S. 
counterparts and assist in transnational investigations.  Many ILEA graduates become the leaders 
and decision-makers in their respective law enforcement organizations.  The Department of State 
coordinates with the Departments of Justice, Homeland Security and Treasury, and with foreign 
government counterparts to implement the ILEA program. 
 
Africa.  ILEA Gaborone (Botswana) opened in 2001 and the Regional Training Center in Accra 
(Ghana) opened in 2012.  ILEA Gaborone delivers one multi-week leadership and development 
course annually and also specialized courses for police and other criminal justice officials to 
boost their capacity to work with U.S. and regional counterparts.  These courses concentrate on 
specific methods and techniques in a variety of subjects, such as anticorruption, financial crimes, 
border security, crime scene investigations, counternarcotics, explosives, trafficking in weapons 
and wildlife, gender-based violence, and community policing.  A Regional Training Center is 
operated in Accra, Ghana, in coordination with the ILEA, and addresses the unique needs of the 
West African region.  ILEA Gaborone and RTC Accra provided training to approximately 2,015 
students in 2018. 
 
Asia.  ILEA Bangkok (Thailand) opened in 1999, and focuses on enhancing regional cooperation 
against transnational crime threats in Southeast Asia with ASEAN member states.  ILEA 
Bangkok’s specialized courses focus on counternarcotics, anticorruption, financial crimes, 
environmental crimes, and trafficking in persons, weapons, and wildlife ILEA Bangkok trained 
approximately 1,107 students in 2018. 
 
Europe.  ILEA Budapest (Hungary) was the first ILEA and was established in 1995.  ILEA 
Budapest delivers three  multi-week leadership and development courses annually and also offers 
specialized courses on regional threats such as anticorruption, organized crime, cybercrime, 
financial crimes, women in law enforcement, gender-based violence, and  specialized training for 
judges and prosecutors.  ILEA Budapest trained approximately 1,060 students in 2018. 
 
Global.  ILEA Roswell (New Mexico) opened in September 2001.  ILEA Roswell hosts senior 
officials and policy makers including top prosecutors, judges, police commanders and lawmakers 
to discuss policy formulation and enforcement to facilitate an effective criminal justice system in 
these priority areas.  These delegates are at the senior levels of leadership in their countries, and 
are positioned to implement substantive changes to the criminal justice systems upon their return.  
ILEA Roswell draws senior officials from all participating ILEA countries.  ILEA Roswell 
trained approximately 324 students in 2018.

Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) 
  
The mission of the DEA is to enforce the controlled substances laws and regulations of the 
United States.  As part of this mission, DEA seeks to bring to justice the criminal organizations 
and principal members of Drug Trafficking Organizations (DTOs) based in the United States or 
foreign nations involved in the cultivation, manufacture, or distribution of controlled substances, 
as well as the money laundering of illicit finances derived from drug trafficking.  
 
To achieve this mission, DEA has nearly 10 percent of its Special Agent and Intelligence Analyst 
work force permanently assigned overseas at 90 DEA foreign offices located in 69 countries.  
DEA’s foreign offices act as conduits of actionable and strategic information, intelligence, and 
evidence to law enforcement and prosecutorial components in the United States and vice versa.  
In this manner, DEA is able to identify, target, and dismantle the entire global spectrum of the 
DTO.  DEA foreign offices are tasked with four principle missions:  
 
• Conduct bilateral and multilateral investigations with host law enforcement partners;  
• Coordinate counternarcotics intelligence gathering with host governments;  
• Implement training programs for host country police and prosecutor agencies;  
• Support the advancement and development of host country drug law enforcement 
institutions. 
 
The emphasis placed on each objective is determined by the host nation’s unique conditions and 
circumstances as it relates to their drug trafficking threat, infrastructure and law enforcement 
capabilities.  DEA works side-by-side with host nation counterparts to develop relevant training, 
promote intelligence sharing, conduct bilateral investigations, and support joint counter-drug 
operations.  The vast majority of DEA foreign efforts and resources are dedicated to conducting 
international drug and drug money laundering investigations.  In addition to that mandate, in 
2018 DEA dedicated considerable effort in the fields of training, multinational law enforcement 
collaboration, and forensic science. 
 
International Training:  In Fiscal Year 2018, DEA Training Division conducted 81 formal 
(bilateral) and multilateral seminars for 2,628 participants from 73 countries.  DEA has been 
conducting international counter-narcotics training since its creation in 1973.  DEA is recognized 
as the world pioneer in international training and serves as the model for a variety of 
international law enforcement training efforts.  The specific courses and curricula offered by 
DEA have evolved over the years in response to experience, changes in law enforcement 
priorities, current international narcotics trafficking situations, new technologies, and specific 
requests of the host governments.  All DEA international training programs have as a major 
objective the building of regional working relationships between countries. 
 
International Drug Enforcement Conference (IDEC) - Strengthening International 
Relations:  In 1983, IDEC was established to institutionalize regional cooperation of drug law 
enforcement officials from countries within the Western Hemisphere.  Over the years IDEC has 
evolved into an important global forum where the highest ranking agency leaders and prosecutors 
from around 125 countries gather to develop a cooperative vision and establish strategies for 


INCSR 2019 Volume 1

38 
combating DTOs.  Participants continue to build, balance, and integrate the tools of law 
enforcement power to combat these criminal networks and build a framework for international 
cooperation to protect all our citizens from the violence, harm, and exploitation wrought by drug 
trafficking and commensurate threats to national security.  IDEC is an operational targeting 
opportunity and global forum for important topical issues in international drug enforcement, and 
to identify and attack DTO vulnerabilities.  IDEC initiatives have demonstrated that a 
multilateral enforcement approach has a cumulative effect as member nations increasingly 
coordinate their law enforcement efforts to investigate and prosecute major DTOs and their 
leaders and to seize and block their assets.  The 36th annual IDEC is scheduled for April 2019 in 
Baku, Azerbaijan, where it will be co-hosted by the Republic of Azerbaijan government and 
DEA. 
 
The Special Testing and Research Laboratory’s Programs:  The Heroin and Cocaine 
Signature Programs (HSP/CSP) at the DEA Special Testing and Research Laboratory (STRL) 
determine the geographic origins of heroin and cocaine seizure samples.  In addition, the 
laboratory maintains a Methamphetamine Profiling Program (MPP) that determines the synthetic 
routes and precursors employed in producing methamphetamine.  The classification schemes for 
these programs were developed using authentic samples collected from drug source countries 
world-wide, as well as drug processing laboratories within those countries.  By collaborating 
with partner nations, numerous such “authentics” are submitted annually to the laboratory from 
the DEA foreign offices.  Currently, the laboratory classifies several thousand drug exhibits 
seized within the United States and abroad annually.   
 
The Signature and Profiling Programs provide the counterdrug intelligence community with 
science-based heroin and cocaine source data and intelligence information regarding 
methamphetamine synthesis.  The HSP, CSP, and the MPP are viewed as crucial tools to 
investigate and support strategic intelligence regarding illicit production, trafficking, and 
availability of these three high profile drugs within the United States and foreign countries.  Over 
the past several years, the laboratory has established a robust Emerging Trends Program to 
analyze new psychoactive substances for enforcement and intelligence purposes.  This group has 
identified over 400 synthetic cannabinoids, substituted cathinones, opioids and powerful 
hallucinogenic compounds that have come into the drug market.   
 
To assist with addressing the nation’s current opioid crisis, STRL developed and implemented a 
new Fentanyl Signature Profiling Program (FSPP).  Through an in-depth analysis including 
quantitation, impurity profiling, isotopic characterization, and occluded solvents analysis, the 
FSPP provides unique science-based forensic investigative leads on seizures where linkages 
were unknown or only suspected; real-time data to investigators; answers to key questions from 
the counterdrug intelligence/enforcement community and U.S. policymakers; and direct support 
to the National Drug Control Strategy.  Since its inception, this program has established 36 
linkages involving 65 cases and 152 samples from DEA seizures of 250 kilograms of fentanyl.  
 
Office of Global Enforcement/Financial Investigations (OGF):  The Office of Global 
Enforcement, Financial Investigations Section (OGF) at DEA Headquarters serves as DEA’s 
lead body for coordinating DEA’s efforts across domestic and foreign offices with respect to the 
targeting of the financial aspects of drug trafficking organizations (DTO).  OGF works in 


INCSR 2019 Volume 1

conjunction with DEA field offices, foreign counterparts, and the inter-agencies to support and 
provided guidance in via a variety of investigative tools, as well as by providing oversight on 
DEA’s undercover financial investigation.  OGF facilitates cooperation between countries, 
resulting in the identification and prosecution of money laundering organizations operating on 
behalf of DTOs, as well as the seizure of assets and denial of revenue around the world.  OGF 
regularly briefs and educates United States government officials and diplomats, foreign 
government officials, and military and law enforcement counterparts regarding the latest trends 
in money laundering, narcoterrorism financing, international banking, offshore corporations, 
international wire transfer of funds, and financial investigative tools.   
  
In conjunction with the DEA Office of International Training, OGF conducts training for DEA 
field offices, as well as foreign counterparts in order to share strategic ideas and promote 
effective techniques in financial investigations.  During 2018, OGF participated and led a 
number of workshops and strategy sessions focused on money laundering trends, engagement 
with financial institutions, guidance and overview on undercover money laundering operations, 
virtual currency, and investigative case coordination. 
 
DEA has prioritized having a financial component to its investigations by making it a key 
component of Priority Target Operations, the Domestic Cartel Initiative, and Organized Crime 
Drug Enforcement Task Force investigations.  DEA has approximately 20 dedicated financial 
investigative teams across DEA’s domestic offices, as well as approximately three foreign-based 
DEA team in Mexico, Peru, and Colombia.

United States Coast Guard (USCG) 
 
The U.S. Coast Guard plays a crucial role in efforts to keep dangerous illict drugs moving by sea 
from reaching the United States.  Working within the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) 
in carrying out its responsibilities within the National Drug Control Strategy, the USCG 
maintains a multi-faceted, layered approach to attack Transnational Organized Crime (TOC) 
networks and their transport of illicit contraband from South America toward the United States 
via the Caribbean Sea, the Eastern Pacific Ocean, and through the littorals of Central America 
and Mexico.  The overarching strategy is to increase maritime border security through a layered 
offensive system that extends beyond U.S. land borders to attack the networks responsible for 
smuggling drugs.  This system begins overseas, spans the offshore regions, and continues into 
U.S. territorial seas and ports.  The USCG’s mix of cutters, aircraft, boats, and deployable 
specialized forces, as well as international and domestic partnerships, allow the Coast Guard to 
leverage its unique maritime law enforcement authorities and competencies to address threats 
and improve security throughout the maritime domain. 
 
USCG efforts focus on removing illicit drugs close to their origins and as far from U.S. shores as 
possible where drug shipments are in their most concentrated bulk form.  Moreover, these illicit 
cargoes are most vulnerable while in transit at sea through international waters where 
interdiction forces have the highest tactical advantage and best opportunity to interdict drug 
movements.  The next step in the maturation of maritime law enforcement is conducting 
operations to disrupt and dismantle the TOC networks by targeting any illicit activity in which 
they are engaged, to include drug, migrant, weapons and bulk cash smuggling, human 
trafficking, and illegal, unreported, or unregulated fishing. 
 
Counternarcotics Operations:  Detection of drug-trafficking vessels occurs principally through 
the collection, analysis, and dissemination of tactical information and strategic intelligence 
combined with effective sensors operating from land, air, and surface assets.  The six million 
square mile transit zone is far too expansive to randomly patrol; targeting information is 
necessary to focus efforts.  Upon detection, U.S. and partner nation law enforcement agencies 
provide monitoring, relaying data, imagery, and position information until an appropriate 
interdiction asset arrives on scene.  The U.S. Coast Guard is the lead U.S. federal agency for 
drug interdiction on the high seas and takes tactical control of U.S. and allied assets for the 
interdiction and apprehension operational phase.  A crucial ingredient for continued maritime 
drug interdiction success is the USCG’s counterdrug bilateral agreements and operational 
procedures held with over 40 partner nations.  By facilitating operational communications and 
enabling law enforcement officers to stop, board, and search vessels suspected of illicit maritime 
activity, these agreements deter smugglers from using another nation’s vessel and/or territorial 
seas as a haven from U.S. law enforcement efforts. 
 
International Cooperative Efforts:  In 2018, the USCG had personnel permanently assigned 
overseas as Coast Guard Liaison Officers, Defense Attachés, and Support to Interdiction and 
Prosecution team members to facilitate maritime counterdrug activities, including security 
assistance, intelligence collection and dissemination, and to liaise with the U.S. interagency and 
international community.  The USCG, in concert with the U.S. Department of State, hosts three 
counter drug summits per year: an annual Multilateral Maritime Interdiction and Prosecution

Summit (Caribbean) and two semi-annual Multilateral Maritime Counter Drug Summits (Central 
and South America).  These summits have a combined annual attendance of more than 35 
countries, over 60 international agencies, and more than 300 experts.  Topics include maritime 
interdiction, prosecution, criminal investigations, and improving regional success in all aspects 
of the interdiction continuum.  To counter trans-Atlantic drug flows, the USCG continues to 
work with U.S. Africa Command to expand maritime training and operations for West African 
countries through the African Maritime Law Enforcement Partnership.  
 
International Training and Technical Assistance:  The USCG provides international training 
and technical assistance to enhance the interdiction capacities of international partners.  The 
Technical Assistance Field Team, a joint initiative between the USCG and the U.S. Southern 
Command (SOUTHCOM), is a team of nine Coast Guard engineers and logisticians whose 
purpose is to professionalize and improve the operational readiness of 11 Caribbean maritime 
forces through technical assistance visits.  The USCG’s Security Assistance Program offers both 
resident training programs and mobile training teams (MTTs) to partner nation maritime services 
around the world to advance the capability of their naval and coast guard forces.  In Fiscal Year 
2018, the USCG deployed 55 MTTs to 26 countries, and approximately 297 students from 64 
countries attended 297 resident courses at USCG training installations.  
 
Operational Highlights:  In Fiscal Year 2018, the USCG expended over 2,400 cutter days, over 
1,400 Airborne Use of Force capable helicopters days, and over 3,400 surveillance aircraft hours 
on counter drug patrols, and USCG Law Enforcement Detachments deployed for over 600 days 
aboard U.S. Navy, British, Dutch, and Canadian warships.  As a result, the USCG disrupted 222 
drug smuggling attempts, which included the seizure of 160 vessels, detention of 602 suspected 
smugglers for further investigation and prosecution, and removal of 209.6 metric tons (MT) of 
cocaine and 24.4 MT of marijuana.

U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) 
 
The Department of Homeland Security’s U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) processes 
all goods, vehicles, and people entering and exiting the United States.  CBP officers are charged 
with identification and prevention of terrorist travel to the United States and interception of illicit 
drugs and other contraband, improperly classified merchandise, unlicensed technology and 
material, weapons, ammunition, fugitives, undocumented immigrants, and unreported currency 
at America’s 329 international ports of entry (POEs). 
 
United States Border Patrol (USBP) agents are assigned the mission of securing the border 
against all threats between the POEs along the over 8,000 miles of land and coastal border.  
These threats include criminal/undocumented aliens, drug smugglers, potential terrorists, wanted 
criminals, and persons seeking to avoid inspection at the designated POEs.  CBP’s drug 
interdiction activity includes staffing 35 permanent and 140 tactical checkpoints nationwide.  
CBP checkpoints utilize experienced agents, canine teams, technology, and shipper-CBP 
partnerships to detect and apprehend the above mentioned threats.  Additionally, agents patrol 
targeted border areas that are frequent entry points for the smuggling of drugs and people into the 
Unites States. 
 
Since its creation, CBP has also been charged with the border regulatory functions of passport 
control and agriculture inspections in order to provide comprehensive, seamless border control 
services.  This merger of responsibilities is intended to simplify border security operations and is 
termed: "One face at the border."  CBP is the nation’s first line of defense against the 
introduction of dangerous drugs from foreign sources. 
 
U.S. Customs and Border Protection's (CBP) Air and Marine Operations (AMO) is a critical 
component of CBP's risk-based and layered approach for border security, with 1,300 federal 
agents, 248 aircraft, and 331 marine vessels operating throughout the United States and Puerto 
Rico.  AMO interdicts unlawful people and cargo approaching U.S. borders, investigates 
criminal networks and provides domain awareness in the air and maritime environments, and 
responds to contingencies and national taskings.   
 
International Training and Assistance:  As part of its efforts to extend the nation’s zone of 
security beyond U.S. ports of entry, CBP works with other U.S. government and foreign 
government partners to provide a wide array of short-term and long-term technical training and 
assistance to countries throughout the world in conjunction with the Department of State, as 
appropriate.  These programs are designed to standardize and build the capacity of foreign 
government organizations to implement more effective customs trade operations, border 
policing, and immigration inspection.   
 
International Visitors Program:  The State Department’s International Visitors Program can 
provide an opportunity for foreign customs officials and other foreign officials to consult with 
their U.S. counterparts and appropriate high-level managers in CBP Headquarters.  International 
visitors can also participate in on-site tours of selected U.S. ports and field sites to observe actual 
CBP operations.

Port of Entry Interdiction Training:  The correct approach to border interdiction varies with 
border environments, e.g., land, seaport, rail, and airport.  Training are designed for the problems 
encountered and interdiction techniques useful for each type of operation.  CBP also provides 
specialized U.S. Border Patrol training in techniques used by smugglers who do not use official 
ports of entry to cross borders, but who attempt to smuggle contraband in lightly patrolled border 
areas. 
 
International Bulk Currency Smuggling Training:  With an increased enforcement focus on 
money laundering, organized criminals and terrorists have turned to bulk cash smuggling to 
move valuables across borders.  Bulk Currency Smuggling training assists foreign government 
enforcement personnel in identifying techniques used by bulk currency smugglers.  Further, CBP 
training helps international partners to design and implement programs to counter that threat, 
resulting in seizures of millions of dollars from the proceeds of crime. 
 
Overseas Enforcement Training:  Overseas Enforcement Training encompasses a curriculum 
which includes Border Enforcement Training; Supply Chain Security; Detection, Interdiction 
and Investigation; Concealment Methods; Bulk Currency Smuggling; False and Fraudulent 
Documents; Train-the-Trainer; Anti-Corruption; Targeting and Risk Management; Hazardous 
Materials; and X-ray Systems.  These courses can also be conducted at foreign ports of entry.  
They include both basic training and refresher training/mentoring abroad for graduates of 
training at U.S. port facilities.   
 
CBP Attachés, Representatives and Advisors and Special Customs’ Programs:  A growing 
network of attachés, representatives and advisors who serve in U.S. diplomatic missions, U.S. 
military bases, or directly for foreign border security agencies.  Attachés have a broad mandate, 
including enforcement and investigative activities on behalf of CBP.  They also exchange expert 
information with foreign counterparts, improving the effectiveness of law enforcement activity, 
policies, and resources relating to border enforcement.  Their efforts help to ensure that 
enforcement cooperation is seamless across borders and that the battle against illegal 
transnational activity is effective. 
 
Customs Mutual Assistance Agreements:  CBP and U.S. Immigration and Customs 
Enforcement (ICE) co-lead negotiations on Customs Mutual Assistance Agreements (CMAAs).  
CMAAs are negotiated with foreign governments and provide for mutual assistance in the 
enforcement of customs-related laws.  Under the provisions of CMAAs, CBP provides assistance 
to its foreign counterparts and receives reciprocal assistance from them primarily in the exchange 
of information that facilitates the enforcement of each country’s laws.  As of the end of Fiscal 
Year 2017, the United States had signed 80 CMAAs, with three signed during Fiscal Year 2017.  
CMAAs also provide a foundational basis for the development and implementation of other 
subsequent cooperation-based arrangements with foreign partners, especially as it relates 
initiatives that require information sharing and protections related thereto.   
 
CBP Preclearance Field Office:  Preclearance operations involve the strategic stationing of 
CBP law enforcement personnel overseas to inspect travelers prior to boarding U.S.-bound 
flights.  Through preclearance, CBP Officers conduct the same immigration, customs, and 
agriculture inspections of international air travelers typically performed upon arrival in the 


INCSR 2019 Volume 1 
 
 
 
 
USG Assistance 
 
44 
United States before departure from foreign airports.  CBP has more than 600 law enforcement 
officers and agriculture specialists stationed at 15 air preclearance locations in six countries.  The 
aviation security benefits of preclearance are substantial because a uniformed, U.S. law 
enforcement officer interviews the precleared passenger before he or she boards the plane.  This 
added security layer provides an additional opportunity to detect and stop threats as early in the 
process as possible. 
 
In addition to enhancing security, preclearance has the potential to increase capacity and create 
growth opportunities for airports and air carriers in the United States and abroad, while 
improving the passenger experience.  Preclearance generates the potential for significant 
economic benefits for the United States and our international partners by facilitating travel 
through all gateways, creating an overall increase in clearance capacity, and maximizing aircraft 
and gate utilization.  For travelers, preclearance leads to faster connections and the ability to exit 
the airport immediately upon landing the United States. 
 
National Targeting Center:  The National Targeting Center (NTC) collaborates with 
international partners to identify, disrupt, and manage risks in the cargo and passenger 
environments through information sharing and implementing joint targeting operations in 
accordance with memoranda of understanding and CMAAs.  As part of this collaboration, the 
Center hosts representatives from participating foreign agencies, and works with these 
international liaisons, as well as with other U.S. government agencies, to detect and disrupt 
terrorism, threats to national security and public safety, and transnational criminal activity 
including but not limited to drug smuggling operations and drug trafficking organizations and 
their associates.  The NTC also provides training and technical assistance in risk assessment and 
targeting to foreign Customs, Immigration and other border enforcement agencies.   
 
DOD Preclearance:  The Customs Border Clearance Agent (CBCA) program is designed to 
permit cargo consigned to the care of the Department of Defense (DoD), as well as returning 
military personnel, to be pre-cleared for import/entry into the Customs Territory of the United 
States.  The preclearance of such cargo and personnel is accomplished by DoD personnel that 
have been trained by CBP officers to perform pre-clearance inspections.  CBCA personnel 
conduct Customs and Agricultural inspections and certify personnel and cargo have met all CBP 
and USDA entry requirements, as well as Defense Travel Regulations, prior to departing to the 
U.S.  CBCA inspections are conducted at 28 locations in seven foreign countries throughout the 
Middle East. CBP officers also provide Technical Assistance Visits and annual Site 
Inspections/Certifications at these DoD preclearance facilities.  
 
Immigration Advisory Program:  Immigration Advisory Program (IAP) works with air carriers 
and host authorities, at foreign airports, to prevent terrorists and other high-risk passengers from 
boarding U.S.-bound flights.  CBP’s Joint Security Program (JSP) is a component of the IAP 
with the goal of identifying high-risk air travelers and contraband arriving and departing the host 
country.  In 2014, IAP and JSP expanded to include the deployment of Police Liaison Officers 
(LO) to foreign partner law enforcement agencies to enhance information exchange posed by 
terrorist and criminal travel.  IAP, JSP and LO play a central role in CBP’s multi-layered strategy 
to mitigate threats before they reach the United States.  IAP currently operates in 20 distinct 
engagements across the globe.

Introduction 
 
 
Chemicals play two critical roles in the production of illicit drugs: as chemical inputs for the 
production of synthetic drugs such as methamphetamine and fentanyl; and as refining agents and 
solvents for processing plant-based materials such as coca and opium poppy into cocaine and 
heroin.  Preventing criminals from gaining access to chemicals needed to produce illicit drugs is 
a key international obligation codified by the United Nations Convention Against Illicit Traffic 
in Narcotic Drugs and Psychotropic Substances of 1988 (1988 UN Drug Convention), and an 
enduring challenge.  This challenge has taken on new importance in recent years, corresponding 
to the growing threat of synthetic opioids and synthetic drug analogues known as new 
psychoactive substances (NPS).  Comprehensive efforts to prevent chemical diversion require 
strong national efforts to control the production, transport, sale, and storage of these substances, 
as well as international coordination and information sharing between governments and 
cooperation from private industry.   
 
Some of the most widely-known chemicals used to produce plant-based drugs include potassium 
permanganate (used to produce cocaine) and acetic anhydride (used to produce heroin).  
Preventing diversion of such chemicals depend on how nations improve their internal controls 
and take the initiative to join international regulatory efforts such as the ones managed by the 
International Narcotics Control Board (INCB).  The international community recognizes 
adherence to international regulatory efforts as an essential commitment to improve efforts 
against diversions of chemicals used to produce plant-based drugs.    
 
Some illicit drug production methods have remained relatively constant through the years, 
involving the same common chemicals, particularly those used to refine traditional plant-based 
drugs such as cocaine and heroin.  Chemicals used as key ingredients to produce synthetic drugs 
and NPS have shifted more regularly.  The United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime 
(UNODC) has identified over 850 different forms of NPS and estimate the number of potential 
fentanyl analogues alone to number in the thousands.  Innovations in synthetic drug design and 
production continue to accelerate as drug producers seek to evade drug controls and tailor 
products to meet evolving consumer demand.  Sustained cooperation and expanded information 
sharing both within and between national governments is critical to keep pace with emerging 
trends in this field. 
 
In March 2017, the 60th session of the United Nations Commission on Narcotic Drugs (CND) 
decided unanimously, at the request of the United States, to require all state parties to the 1988 
UN Drug Convention to control the two key precursor chemicals used to produce illicit fentanyl: 
4-anilino-N-phenethylpiperidine (ANPP) and N-phenethyl-4-piperidone (NPP).  This binding 
international obligation went into effect in October 2017, and serves as a prime example of how 
the international drug control system should swiftly react to emerging drug control challenges 
and threats to public health, and to take concrete action to save lives, when quickly and properly 
applied.   
 
In March 2018, at the 61st CND, the United States introduced a resolution focusing on the non-
medical use of synthetic opioids and their precursors, including fentanyl and its analogues.  


INCSR 2019 Volume 1

Specifically, the U.S. resolution, which the CND ultimately adopted by consensus, promotes 
expanded use of existing tools developed by UNODC and INCB that facilitate real-time 
cooperation between international law enforcement partners to disrupt the illicit supply chain of 
these dangerous precursors. 
 
The International Framework 
 
The 1988 UN Drug Convention is the legal framework for international cooperation to prevent 
precursor chemical diversion.  Specifically, the 190 UN member states that are party to the 
convention are required, under Article 12, to monitor their international trade in the chemicals 
listed in Tables I and II of the Convention.  These chemicals have legitimate industrial uses and 
the tables are updated regularly to account for changes in the manufacture of illicit drugs.  State 
parties are required to share information with one another and with the INCB on their 
international transactions involving these chemicals to identify and prevent diversion for illicit 
purposes.  Article 12, Sections 8 and 9 of the Convention requires licensing or similar control of 
all persons and enterprises involved in the manufacture and distribution of listed chemicals.   
 
Resolutions from the CND – the treaty-based body within the UN system with prime 
responsibility for international drug-control policy – have provided additional guidance to states 
parties on how to implement their obligations according to specific best practices.  These 
resolutions have also encouraged greater dissemination and use of the INCB’s International 
Special Surveillance List (ISSL) – a mechanism for monitoring chemicals not regulated by the 
Convention but for which substantial evidence exists of their use in illicit drug manufacture.   
 
The INCB is an independent, quasi-judicial monitoring body for the implementation of the three 
UN international drug control conventions – the 1988 UN Drug Convention, the Single 
Convention on Narcotic Drugs of 1961 as amended by the 1972 Protocol, and the Convention on 
Psychotropic Substances of 1971.  The INCB monitors compliance with the drug control treaties 
and proposes appropriate remedial measures and technical assistance to governments that are not 
fully applying the provisions of the treaties or are encountering difficulties in applying them.  
The United States provides funding to the INCB to monitor the measures called for in the 
Conventions, and to improve detection and tracking of chemicals subject to diversion. 
 
In addition to ISSL, the INCB has developed a number of instruments to address the challenges 
of precursor chemicals: 
 
• The Pre-Export Notification Online system (PEN Online) is an online database system that 
enables the exchange of information between member states on the import and export of 
chemicals required for the manufacture of illicit drugs, and to provide the ability to raise alerts to 
stop suspect shipments before they reach illicit drug manufacturers.  The system facilitates 
information sharing on the global level by collecting data on precursor chemical trafficking and 
use trends, and then publicizing this data.  In practice, electronic responses are sent to exporting 
countries which are required to acknowledge receipt and confirm clearance to export chemicals.  
Since the PEN Online system was first launched in March 2006, 162 governments have 
registered to use it.  On average, there are 2,910 PEN pre-export notifications made monthly via 


INCSR 2019 Volume 1 
 
 
 
 
Chemical Controls 
 
48 
 
the online system.  More than 35,000 pre-export notifications have been submitted using the 
PEN Online system. 
 
• The Precursors Incident Communication System (PICS) is another INCB tool that facilitates 
real-time communication exchange among law enforcement officials worldwide.  The system 
supports intelligence sharing and facilitates direct coordination and collaboration among national 
authorities to advance investigations on chemical trafficking.  As of November 2018, more than 
2,300 incidents communicated through PICS; an increase of more than 230 from the previous 
year.  Those incidents involved more than 30 different countries and territories.  The system has 
registered users from 109 countries and territories, representing nearly 250 agencies.   
 
In addition to PEN Online and PICS, the INCB manages task forces to implement Project Prism, 
Project Cohesion, and Project ION — three INCB international initiatives in matters related to 
chemicals used in the illicit manufacture of drugs, specifically synthetic drugs (Project Prism), 
heroin and cocaine (Project Cohesion), and NPS (Project ION).  These ongoing mechanisms 
facilitate coordinating the monitoring of chemical transactions and targeted, time-bound 
intelligence-gathering operations.   
 
The Board also maintains a Precursor Task Force and a Project ION Task Force.  At the 61st 
CND, the Precursor Task Force held a side event delivering presentations on flexible approaches 
to drug precursor control.  Those included examples of voluntary cooperation with industry in 
Germany; regulatory measures in the United States to reduce administrative burdens on control 
measures; and steps to cope with non-scheduled precursor chemicals in China. 
 
The Project ION Task Force is primarily engaged in the coordination, collection, and 
communication of strategic and operational information and intelligence related to synthetic NPS 
with little or no known medical, scientific, or industrial uses.  This task force promotes 
international operational initiatives by supporting national authorities' efforts in preventing non-
scheduled NPS from reaching consumer markets.  Additionally, the INCB recently implemented 
a special project (Project Opioids) to interdict the illicit distribution and sales of synthetic opioids 
by developing partnerships and practical actions with governments and relevant industries.   
 
Regional Bodies.  The regulatory framework codified by the United Nations does  
not exist in isolation.  Regional bodies, such as the European Union (EU) and the Organization 
of American States (OAS) actively work in partnership with the United States on multilateral 
chemical control initiatives, including the implementation of CND resolutions. 
 
Chemical Control Activities and New Trends 
 
Fentanyl.  Fentanyl is a powerful and deadly Schedule II synthetic opioid that is between 50 
and 100 times more potent than morphine.  Within North America, drug traffickers are 
increasingly lacing illicit fentanyl into heroin and other drugs to create a more potent high for 
users.  Fentanyl is also pressed into pill form and sold as counterfeit prescription opioid pills.  
In many instances, buyers are not aware of the presence of fentanyl in heroin, alternatively the 
user may have sought out fentanyl-laced heroin for the greater high.   
 


INCSR 2019 Volume 1 
 
 
 
 
Chemical Controls 
 
49 
 
Fentanyl is responsible for a surging number of overdose fatalities in the United States, 
Canada, and some European countries.  Specifically in the United States between 2017 and 
2018, fentanyl-related overdose claimed the lives of more than 30,000 Americans.  In Canada, 
from January to June 2018, opioids, mainly fentanyl and its analogues, were responsible for 
nearly 2,100 overdose deaths.  While fentanyl deaths have been highest in North America, 
fentanyl availability and overdose deaths have also increased in other parts of the world.  In the 
United Kingdom, 122 fentanyl-related deaths were recorded from between 2017 and March 
2018, up from 58 recorded in 2016.   
 
The two precursor chemicals used to produce illicit fentanyl and fentanyl-related substances 
(for example, acetyl fentanyl) are NNPP and ANPP.  While there are several chemicals and 
pathways to manufacture fentanyl, the NPP and ANPP processing method is currently the 
preferred one used by clandestine manufacturers.  On October 18, 2017, these two chemicals were 
added to Table I (internationally controlled chemicals) of the 1988 UN Drug Convention, 
implementing the decision of the 2017 CND.  With the addition of ANPP and NPP, there are 
now 28 chemicals controlled under Table I.  International control of these chemicals under the 
1988 UN Drug Convention requires states parties to the convention to institute domestic 
regulation of the import and export of ANPP and NPP, which is intended to reduce their 
availability to criminals and reduce their availability in the illicit supply chain.   
 
The INCB has identified a list of 93 fentanyl-related substances with no currently known 
legitimate medical or industrial uses, beyond limited research and analytical purposes.  Seventy-
seven of those substances are not currently scheduled under any of the three UN drug 
conventions.  In response to Member State requests, the Board disseminated this list of fentanyl-
related substances and invited all countries to refrain on a voluntary basis from any manufacture, 
import, export or distribution of the substances on the list.  The list is a valuable tool used by 
DEA and international law enforcement practitioners to increase identification and detection of 
fentanyl-related substances in criminal channels. 
 
New Psychoactive Substances and Opioid Analogues.  NPS are substances of abuse, either in 
a pure form or a preparation, that are not controlled by the 1961 Convention or the 1971 
Convention, but which may pose a public health threat.  Producers modify and experiment with 
new chemical formulas in a search for new NPS that can avoid detection by authorities and skirt 
the international control regime.   
 
The rapid proliferation of NPS is creating a critical challenge for law enforcement officials 
worldwide because of the speed in which they can be reformulated and remarketed to avoid 
international control.  Over 850 formulations of NPS were reported to the United Nations 
through 2018, exceeding the capacity of law enforcement and regulatory authorities to curb this 
problem.  Traffickers sell these substances via the Internet, through both open and non-indexed 
online websites (the so-called “Dark Web”), then utilize international mail and express 
consignment shipments to deliver them.  Because of the extreme potency of these substances, 
tiny quantities, often only milligrams, are required to generate powerful and deadly highs; 
consequently, such small shipments can easily evade law enforcement and regulatory detection.

The UNODC’s Global Synthetics, Monitoring Analyses, Reporting and Trends (SMART) 
program helps law enforcement and forensic officials to combat the challenges posed by NPS 
through increased information sharing worldwide.  The United States is a staunch supporter of 
the Global SMART program as a critical tool to increase voluntary cooperation among member 
states in sharing information on NPS trafficking and use trends on a global level.  Data collected 
and analyzed by Global SMART informs CND scheduling decisions that affect international 
control of NPS under the UN drug conventions.  This information is available on online portals, 
and is used to generate reports updating member states on the scope of this problem.   
 
Illicit manufacture, trafficking, and use of synthetic opioids and NPS are poised to expand to 
new countries and regions.  Many countries in the Middle East and Africa have reported 
increased trafficking and misuse of the synthetic opioid tramadol.  Misuse of tramadol could lead 
to a demand for even more toxic forms of synthetic opioids.  Criminals have been quick to 
capitalize on the low risk and cost of synthetic opioids, and continue to develop and introduce 
new analogues to markets.  In 2012, governments reported just three synthetic opioid NPS to the 
United Nations, increasing to 10 in 2016.  By 2018, according to the INCB, 37 countries had 
reported seizing 40 different opioid-type NPS, mostly fentanyl or fentanyl-related substances.   
 
In addition to new fentanyl analogues, counterfeit variations of oxycodone, tramadol, and other 
pharmaceutical products continue to make inroads in the United States and other markets.  
Trafficking and abuse of synthetic opioids has become a top concern of governments in Africa, 
South Asia, and the Middle East, particularly related to counterfeit or illicitly manufactured 
tramadol.  Within the EU, 38 synthetic opioid NPS have been detected since 2009, with 13 
reported in 2017, including 10 fentanyl analogues. 
 
The international legal framework for drug control is struggling to keep pace with the speed by 
which criminals can develop new NPS.  The United Nations drug control treaties, as well as the 
laws of many countries, continue to control drugs individually according to their chemical 
structure – a time consuming process.  Many countries – including the United States – have 
enacted legislative reforms within the scope of international law to review and control NPS 
based on their psychoactive effects or broader category of classification (class-based scheduling), 
rather than precise chemical structure.   
 
In November 2018, during the G-20 Meeting in Buenos Aires, China agreed to reclassify 
fentanyl as a controlled substance in its internal list of regulatory precursor chemicals.  
According to China’s Foreign Ministry, the country will schedule the entire category of fentanyl-
type substances as controlled substances, and start the process of revising relevant laws and 
regulations.  Full implementation of this announced reform could make an important impact in 
reducing the availability of fentanyl analogues.   
 
Carfentanil.  Carfentanil is a particularly potent fentanyl analogue not approved for use in 
humans that is contributing to opioid-related overdose deaths.  Used as a veterinary tranquilizer 
for large mammals, carfentanil is up to 100 times more potent than fentanyl, and controlled 
under Schedule II of the Controlled Substances Act.

Evidence obtained from seized drug supplies indicates that carfentanil is commonly used as an 
adulterant in other illicit drugs, such as heroin or cocaine, or mixed with diluents and pressed 
into counterfeit prescription pills.  According to data obtained from National Forensic 
Laboratory Information System (NFLIS), there have been at least 2,900 domestic carfentanil 
encounters in over 21 states in the United States since 2016.   
 
The presence of carfentanil in the illicit drug market poses a serious threat to the public health 
given users are often unaware the product they are purchasing contains carfentanil.  At the 61st 
CND in March 2018, based on the WHO’s recommendation, UN Member states voted to 
internationally control carfentanil and five other fentanyl analogues under Schedules I and IV of 
the 1961 Single Convention on Narcotic Drugs.    
 
The Single Convention on Narcotics Drugs of 1961 is an international treaty barring production 
and supply of specific narcotic drugs of similar effects except under license for specific 
purposes, such as medical treatment and research.  Schedules I and IV of the 1961 Single 
Convention on Narcotic Drugs are considered the strictest level of controls of dangerous 
narcotics and their production components.   
 
Heroin.  Heroin is derived from the opium poppy plant and can be lethal if taken on regular 
basis.  Traffickers are increasingly mixing fentanyl into heroin to stretch supplies and maximize 
profits, often without the knowledge of users.  The main precursor chemical used to produce 
heroin is acetic anhydride, a substance also widely used in legitimate industry.  Drug trafficking 
organizations continue to channel acetic anhydride to illicit producers through diversion, or 
smuggling.  Acetic anhydride may also be used as a compound substance to produce a chemical 
reaction in the production of methamphetamine.     
 
According to the INCB, there has been a sharp increase in the demand for acetic anhydride for 
illicit purposes since 2016, particularly in the EU.  However, detected attempts by traffickers to 
divert the substance from international supply channels have gradually decreased in number.  
One reason for the detected decline in diversion attempts could be that traffickers have 
succeeded in diverting and stockpiling sufficient amounts.   
 
Seizures of acetic anhydride of suspected European origin continued in Europe and West Asia in 
2017 and 2018.  In total, 20 countries reported seizing shipments of acetic anhydride in 2017, 
amounting to almost 127,000 liters.  The largest volume of total seizures was reported by 
Afghanistan (37,700 liters), followed by Turkey (23,200 liters) and Iran (20,300 liters).  
Countries reporting total seizures of more than 5,000 liters included Bulgaria, Mexico, Japan, the 
Netherlands, and Pakistan. 
 
Despite the fact that diversion attempts appear to have decreased since 2016, suspicious requests 
for supplies of acetic anhydride continue to be posted on certain online trading platforms.  In this 
regard, the United States continues to work closely with participant countries of the INCB 
Precursor Task Force of Project Prism and Project Cohesion to counter acetic anhydride 
diversion.  The United States also provides assistance to expand international use of the INCB’s 
PEN Online and PICS to control and to monitor the diversion of acetic anhydride and other 
chemicals.

For activities under Project Prism and Project Cohesion, participating governments are requested 
to register points of contact (focal points) for their relevant national authorities involved in 
precursor control, such as national regulatory, law enforcement, customs and drug control 
agencies, and to actively use the system to communicate all incidents involving precursor 
chemicals.  Governments that have not yet registered PICS points of contact for their national 
authorities involved in precursor control may request an account by writing to incb.pics@un.org.    
 
Methamphetamine.  Methamphetamine is produced using a variety of methods, but most 
require one or more of the following precursor chemicals: pseudoephedrine; ephedrine; 
pharmaceutical products containing these chemicals; phenyl-2-propanone (P-2-P); and 
phenylacetic acid.  Use of ephedrine and pseudoephedrine in the illicit manufacture of 
methamphetamine is predominant in Asia, Oceania, Africa and in some regions in Europe.  In 
the Western Hemisphere, the bulk of illicitly manufactured methamphetamine is made using P-2-
P-based methods. 
 
As these precursor chemicals have become more difficult to obtain due to increased controls, 
traffickers have started using other chemicals, or seeking non-controlled pre-precursor chemicals 
or esters, and derivatives of phenylacetic acid to produce the precursor chemicals necessary for 
methamphetamine production.   
 
In 2017, seizures of phenylacetic acid were predominantly in Mexico, with 19.5 metric tons 
(MT) seized in clandestine methamphetamine laboratories.  It was not clear if the phenylacetic 
acid seized in Mexico had been illicitly manufactured from one of its precursors, such as 2-
phenylacetamide, which is also controlled in Mexico.  
 
Traffickers, particularly in Europe, may be still using the pre-precursor APAAN, or alpha-
phenylacetoacetonitrile for the production of methamphetamine.  This chemical was added to the 
list of internationally controlled chemicals under the 1988 UN Drug Convention in 2014.  In 
Europe, there are limited legitimate uses for APAAN, and therefore imports are likely to be 
intended for conversion to benzyl methyl ketone (BMK), an amphetamine precursor.  According 
to the INCB, three European countries reported seizing APAAN between 2016 and 2017. 
Together, the amounts seized totaled less than 600 kilograms (kg) in 2017, less than half the 
amount seized in 2016.     
 
Methamphetamine production takes place domestically within the United States and worldwide.  
Domestic small production capacity laboratories (SPCLs) are the most frequently encountered 
type of clandestine laboratory.  These SPCLs tend to be low production operations (grams or 
ounces), and make up only a small percentage of the drug that is consumed in the United States.  
The emergence of the “one-pot labs” (a.k.a. “shake-n-bake” labs) constitute the majority of 
SPCLs found domestically.  These laboratories typically use two-liter plastic soda bottles, 16-20 
ounce drink containers, and other such receptacles.  Only rudimentary technical skills are 
required to manufacture methamphetamine using these methods. 
 
Pseudoephedrine and ephedrine are the principal precursor chemicals used in the SPCLs and are 
purchased over the counter from retail pharmacies and convenience stores.  Most of the

methamphetamine available in the United States, however, is produced abroad, and trafficking 
across the U.S. southern border increased exponentially in 2018.  Traffickers increasingly prefer 
new production methods to manufacture methamphetamine that do not require ephedrine and 
pseudoephedrine.  These methods were identified in 98 percent of all samples seized by the DEA 
in the United States in 2017.   
 
Most large-scale manufacturers in Mexico are believed to use the P-2-P method to manufacture 
the precursor chemicals required to produce methamphetamine.  However, there have been some 
indications of a possible shift to the phenylacetic acid method.  Mexican authorities seized large 
volumes of phenylacetic acid (20 MT) in 2017.  Chemical analysis of future seizures may help 
provide additional analysis on emerging production methods used by Mexican drug trafficking 
organizations.  
 
Countries in Africa and Asia, where precursors like P-2-P and APAAN are relatively unknown, 
continue to rely on ephedrine and pseudoephedrine to produce top quality methamphetamine.  
There are indications, however, that Mexican alternate methods to produce methamphetamine 
are being expanded in Africa.  Moreover, traffickers may also be shifting to adopt the use of 
APAA, or Alpha-phenylacetoacetamide, as a substitute chemical for P-2-P and APAAN.  This 
shift began after APAAN was scheduled under Table I of the 1988 UN Drug Convention in 
2014.  In 2018, the INCB recommended that APAA be added to the list scheduled under Table I.   
 
Cocaine.  Potassium permanganate, an oxidizer, is the primary chemical used to remove the 
impurities from cocaine base.  It has many legitimate industrial uses, including waste-water 
treatment, and as a disinfectant and deodorizer.  During the first 10 months of 2018, more than 
30 countries shipped more than 25,500 MT of potassium permanganate to over 120 importing 
countries and territories.  Potassium permanganate can also be combined with pseudoephedrine 
to produce methcathinone, a synthetic psychoactive stimulant controlled under the 1971 UN 
Convention.  
 
In South America, the only region of the world where large quantities of coca leaf are cultivated, 
traffickers continue to divert chemicals from legitimate industry, either from domestic or 
international sources, for cocaine production.  A growing trend cited by law enforcement 
officials is the recycling of chemicals, which allows clandestine laboratory operators to reuse 
chemicals up to four times before they need to be replaced.  The two main sources of the 
potassium permanganate used for illicit purposes appear to be diversion from licit domestic 
distribution channels and subsequent smuggling to illicit processing sites either within the same 
country or across sub-regional borders, and illicit manufacture.  Traffickers are also producing 
their own potassium permanganate, particularly in Colombia. 
 
Alternative precursor chemicals as well as solvent mixtures used in cocaine manufacturing have 
also been detected.  Countries in Central and South America have a variety of other chemicals 
under national control, which are known to have been used in the illicit manufacture of cocaine.  
These include common acids and bases, oxidizing agents, solvents used for the extraction of 
cocaine base from coca leaves and for the conversion of cocaine base into cocaine hydrochloride, 
as well as precursors of and substitutes for potassium permanganate.

Additionally, traffickers continue to recycle the chemical containers, making it difficult to trace 
the origin of the chemicals inside.  INCB’s Project Cohesion monitors the imports of potassium 
permanganate to cocaine processing areas.  The United States, the INCB, and other international 
partners encourage countries in South and Central America to continue sharing information on 
these new trends. 
 
Future Trends.  Drug traffickers will continue to adapt to new production methods and exploit 
chemicals not controlled under the Convention or domestic laws.  To avoid enforcement 
pressure, criminals will also continue to take advantage of countries with limited enforcement 
and regulatory capacity, and frequently obtain chemicals produced within countries where illicit 
drugs are produced, thereby escaping international monitoring, surveillance, and interdiction 
efforts.  It is critical to continue efforts to strengthen the capacity of law enforcement, public 
health institutions, and transportation and shipment industries to minimize illicit precursor 
chemical diversion.  It is also important to enhance international cooperation to combat the 
threats posed by domestic chemical diversion. 
 
Toxic adulterants is also of concern as drug traffickers continue to manipulate illicit drug 
composition with distinct pharmacological products.  Drug traffickers have traditionally mixed 
non-toxic materials such as lactose and glucose into drug supplies to increase profitability, but 
there is growing evidence that traffickers are increasingly mixing banned or controlled toxic 
substances including pharmaceutical drugs and fungicides into illicit drugs to increase drug 
potency and produce enhanced psychoactive effects.   
 
Many street drugs contain multiple toxic adulterants, numerous controlled substances, and 
impurities from the heroin manufacturing process.  However, crime laboratories, emergency 
departments, and medical examiners do not routinely test for adulterants unless given a specific 
reason to do so.  It is vital that law enforcement authorities continue to test drug samples for 
toxic adulterants, alerting public health authorities of additional negative effects toxic adulterants 
can cause to the body, including death.    
 
Major Chemical Source Countries and Territories 
 
This section focuses on individual countries with large chemical manufacturing industries that 
have significant trade with drug-producing regions and those with significant chemical 
commerce susceptible to diversion domestically for smuggling into drug-producing countries.  
Designation as a major chemical source country does not indicate a lack of adequate chemical 
control legislation or the ability to enforce it.  Rather, it recognizes that the volume of chemical 
trade with drug-producing regions, or proximity to them, makes these countries the sources of 
the greatest quantities of chemicals liable to diversion.  The United States, with its large 
chemical industry and extensive trade with drug-producing regions, is included on the list.   
 
Many other countries manufacture and trade in chemicals, but not on the same scale, or with the 
broad range of precursor chemicals, as the countries in this section.  These two sections are 
broken down by region.

Nigeria   
 
Nigeria’s National Agency for Food and Drug Administration and Control (NAFDAC) is the 
primary government agency responsible for preventing diversion of precursor chemicals in 
Nigeria.  Since 2011, 11 clandestine methamphetamine laboratories have been detected in 
Nigeria, making Nigeria an emerging major producing country for methamphetamine.  In 
addition to the emerging methamphetamine threat, Nigeria is also developing into a major 
transshipment country for ephedrine, a precursor chemical used in the production of 
methamphetamine.  Precursor chemicals – mainly ephedrine – are imported from India and 
China then diverted to the laboratory operators.   
 
In July 2018, the National Drug Law Enforcement Agency’s Sensitive Investigative Unit 
reported that it seized 50 kg of ephedrine destined for a methamphetamine lab in Anambra, 
Nigeria.  The ephedrine was produced in India then shipped to Ghana.  From Ghana it was 
smuggled to Kano, Nigeria and was seized in Kogi, Nigeria while in route to Anambra.  
Aggregate 2018 seizure data pertaining to precursor chemicals were not available at the time of 
this report. 
 
South Africa 
 
South Africa is a leading regional importer of chemicals used in the production of illicit drugs, 
particularly synthetic drugs.  The South African Police Services (SAPS) has a trained, dedicated 
clandestine laboratory team.  The SAPS division of the Directorate for Priority Crime 
Investigations (DPCI) estimates 40-50 clandestine laboratories are dismantled annually within 
the country.  According to statistics released in September 2018, SAPS reported a 10.5 percent 
increase in drug-related crimes from fiscal years 2016-2017 to 2017-2018.  Enforcement teams 
from the South African Revenue Service (SARS) also seize illicit drugs and precursor chemicals, 
including ethanol and toluene.   
 
Ephedrine and pseudoephedrine used in South Africa to synthesize methamphetamine largely 
originate in Nigeria and India.  South African authorities regularly report newly identified 
precursor substances used in illicit drug production to the INCB.  South Africa also submits 
information on seized precursor shipments to the INCB’s PICS.  Restricting and analyzing the 
trade of precursors are mandated by the South Africa National Drug Policy, which mandates the 
establishment of computerized inventory control systems for scheduled chemicals and regulating 
and monitoring the purchase of medicines containing precursors via a registry system.  Such 
measure have not been fully implemented.  
 
The nexus between wildlife trafficking and trafficking in precursors and illicit drugs is being 
investigated.  U.S. law enforcement collaboration with South Africa on investigations is 
productive but sporadic, and U.S. authorities regularly share information on container shipments 
suspected of containing possible illicit materials with South African counterparts.

Canada   
 
Canada has a large chemical industry and strong legislation, which allow for effective regulatory 
controls over the industry.  Canada’s “Controlled Drugs and Substances Act” (CDSA) and its 
regulations provide the legislative framework for the control of chemical precursors.  Health 
Canada submits an annual report to the INCB with respect to its obligations under the 1988 UN 
Drug Convention.  The annual report provides information on licit imports and exports for the 
previous year, stopped shipments and seizures, and refusals of permit applications due to 
objections from foreign authorities.  The report also details information received from the INCB, 
and incomplete or invalid application information. 
  
Canada cooperates fully with the INCB in cases where shipments may pose a concern.  
Scheduling of substances under the CDSA and its regulations give law enforcement agencies the 
authority to take action against activities that are not in accordance with the law.  These 
instruments also authorize Health Canada to communicate information collected to law 
enforcement agencies, border control officers, foreign competent authorities and the INCB if 
necessary.  As a state party to the 1988 UN Drug Convention, Canada is obligated to impose 
controls on substances in response to decisions of the CND.  Canada continues to explore ways 
to prevent the illicit diversion of chemical precursors through legislative and regulatory channels.   
 
Mexico   
 
Mexico has several major chemical manufacturing and trade industries that produce, import, or 
export chemicals required for illicit drug production.  Mexican laws regulate the production and 
use of many of these substances and the Mexican Federal Commission for the Protection Against 
Sanitary Risk (COFEPRIS) is responsible for enforcing chemical control laws.  In addition, 
Mexico controls all chemicals listed in the 1988 UN Drug Convention.  Mexican government 
agencies, to include Customs and the Mexican Regulatory Agency, continue to monitor the 
importation of controlled precursor chemicals, but this has not significantly deterred local 
methamphetamine production. 
 
Although Mexico-based transnational criminal organizations are major producers of 
methamphetamine, imports of methamphetamine precursors pseudoephedrine and ephedrine are 
outlawed, and they are not produced legally within the country.  Mexico regulates the 
importation of precursor chemicals, including phenylacetic acid, methylamine, hydriodic acid, 
and red phosphorous.  The importation of formaldehyde and ammonium chloride continues to be 
monitored due to their potential diversion, as these chemicals can be used to manufacture 
methylamine, a key chemical for methamphetamine production.   
 
Despite monitoring and regulations, illicit precursor importers attempt to move chemicals 
undetected within the country.  Importers continue to mislabel shipments, which poses a 
challenge for law enforcement in detecting the importation of chemicals coming from source 
countries such as India and China.  Importers also exploit regulatory vulnerabilities in Central 
America to smuggle precursor chemicals into Guatemala and Honduras and eventually to 
Mexico for use in methamphetamine production.

The Mexican government controls two fentanyl precursor chemicals NPP and ANPP.  While 
these controls have not fully deterred criminal organizations from obtaining these chemicals, it 
has forced criminals to seek chemical alternatives, while providing Mexican regulatory and law 
enforcement agencies a legal basis to seize these substances and file criminal or civil charges 
against those illegally importing them.  Despite controls, the small quantities needed for fentanyl 
production present a challenge to law enforcement in the detection of these chemicals as they 
enter Mexico.   
 
Mexico participates in international efforts to control precursors and has a strong bilateral 
working relationship with the United States.  Mexico signed a memorandum of cooperation with 
the United States in 2012 to address precursor chemicals and clandestine laboratories.  The two 
governments also cooperate to share best practices with Central American countries affected by 
the trafficking of precursor chemicals.  U.S. government agencies continue to provide training 
and equipment to both Mexican and Central American law enforcement agencies to address 
existing and emerging synthetic drug threats in the region.   
 
The United States   
 
The United States manufactures and/or trades in almost all 28 chemicals listed in Tables I and II 
of the 1988 UN Drug Convention to which it is a party, and it has laws and regulations 
implementing chemical control provisions.   
 
The foundation of U.S. chemical control is the Chemical Diversion and Trafficking Act of 1988.  
This law and subsequent chemical control provisions of the U.S. drug law are interwoven into 
the Controlled Substances Act of 1970, rather than individual stand-alone legislation.  The DEA 
is responsible for administering and enforcing these laws.   
 
The Department of Justice, primarily through its U.S. Attorneys, handles criminal and civil 
prosecutions at the federal level.  In addition to registration and recordkeeping requirements, the 
legislation requires importers and exporters to file import or export notifications at least 15 days 
before the transaction is to take place.  The 15-day advanced notification permits DEA to 
evaluate the transaction.  However, the legislation and regulations allow for a waiver of the 15-
day advance notification if a company has an established business relationship for a specified 
listed chemical or chemicals with its foreign customer that has been reported to DEA, subject to 
the criteria in the Code of Federal Regulations.  In these cases, same-day notification is permitted 
for future shipments.  Diversion investigators and special agents communicate with exporting 
and importing government officials in this process.  The legislation also gives the DEA the 
authority to suspend shipments.   
 
U.S. legislation requires chemical handlers to report to DEA suspicious transactions such as 
those involving extraordinary quantities or unusual methods of payment.  Criminal penalties for 
chemical diversion are strict; the penalties for some chemical trafficking offenses involving 
methamphetamine are tied to the quantities of drugs that could have been produced with the 
diverted chemicals.  If the diversion of listed chemicals is detected, persons or companies may be 
prosecuted or the DEA registration may be revoked.

The Combat Methamphetamine Epidemic Act of 2005 (CMEA) mandated DEA to establish total 
annual requirements, import quotas, individual manufacturing quotas, and procurement quotas 
for three List 1 chemicals:  pseudoephedrine, ephedrine, and phenylpropanolamine.  This 
affected those DEA-registered importers and manufacturers that wish to import or conduct 
manufacturing activities with these chemicals.  The CMEA also restricted retail level 
transactions of nonprescription drug products that contain ephedrine, pseudoephedrine, or 
phenylpropanolamine, now known as “scheduled listed chemical products.”  The CMEA and 
other chemical control legislation are aimed at preventing the illicit manufacture of illegal drugs 
domestically and internationally.   
 
The United States has played a leading role in the design, promotion, and implementation of 
cooperative multilateral chemical control initiatives.  The United States also actively works with 
other concerned nations, and with the UNODC and the INCB to develop information sharing 
procedures to better control precursor chemicals and non-controlled substances used in the illicit 
production of drugs. U.S. officials are members of a combined task force for both Project 
Cohesion and Project Prism.  The United States has established close operational cooperation 
with counterparts in major chemical manufacturing and trading countries.  This cooperation 
includes information sharing in support of chemical control programs and to prevent chemical 
diversion. 
 
Central America and the Caribbean   
 
Costa Rica 
 
Costa Rica has a stringent licensing process for the importation and distribution of precursor 
chemicals, and has implemented precursor diversion prevention measures recommended by the 
INCB.  Costa Rica has controls for Table I and Table II precursor and essential chemicals as 
defined by the 1988 UN Drug Convention. 
  
The Costa Rican government’s National Plan on Drugs for 2018-2025 recognizes the 
international problem of production and trafficking of chemical precursors.  Costa Rica has yet 
to seize large amounts of the substances compared to elsewhere in the region and imports a 
relatively low volume of precursor chemicals.   
 
The Costa Rican Drug Institute has a special unit dedicated to the control and regulation of 
precursor chemicals, and this unit has broad powers to monitor and respond to illegal 
activity.  By law, importers and businesses that handle chemical precursors or certain types of 
prescription drugs are required to submit monthly reports through an online tracking 
system.  During the first 10 months of 2018, there were 2,336 authorized import transactions, 
licensed to 199 registered importers of chemical precursors (three occasional importers and 196 
regular importers).  The system tracks the movement of chemical precursors and solvents and 
also generates alerts.  Costa Rica received one specific alert during the January-October 2018 
period for possible participation of one importer in irregular activity.  The source of the alert 
provided limited information, which was in the process of being verified and investigated at the 
time of this report.

Dominican Republic   
 
The Dominican Republic has implemented a chemical control regime in accordance with Article 
12 of the 1988 UN Drug Convention.  Dominican laws regulate the production and use of the 28 
chemicals listed in the Convention and the Dominican Republic annually submits information 
required by the Convention.  The National Directorate for Drug Control (DNCD) is responsible 
for enforcing chemical control laws. 
 
The Dominican Republic does not have a large petrochemical industry engaged in the 
manufacturing, importation, and exportation of chemical products.  Chemicals for industrial 
production are imported from the United States.  The two largest chemical imports are sodium 
carbonate and toluene, used in the Dominican Republic as an additive for gasoline and as a 
solvent for paint.   
 
The DNCD regulates and enforces the importation and use of precursor chemicals.  The DNCD 
receives pre-notifications for precursor imports and issues certificates of importation.  The 
DNCD also controls and regulates prescription drugs and issues annual permits to medical 
doctors, clinics, and hospitals, maintaining a register of the type of drug and amount each doctor 
prescribes each year, especially for drugs containing opiates.  Clinics and hospitals are mandated 
to report prescriptions for certain drugs before dispensing them and the DNCD verifies that the 
prescription number and the doctor are valid before authorizing the sale.  The DNCD is taking 
steps to automate its paper-based chemical control registration. 
  
El Salvador   
 
El Salvador is party to the 1988 UN Drug Convention, and invokes its rights to pre-notification 
of scheduled precursor chemicals under Article 12.  Precursor chemical trafficking remains a 
regional threat, as methamphetamine production continues to spread from Mexico into 
neighboring Guatemala.  
  
With U.S. assistance, the INCB trains the Government of El Salvador and its national authorities 
to comply with the provisions of the three international drug control conventions in the 
regulatory control of the licit trade in narcotic drugs and psychotropic substances, and the 
monitoring of precursor chemicals.  The ultimate goal is to facilitate the appropriate availability 
of internationally controlled substances for medical, scientific and industrial purposes, yet 
prevent their abuse and diversion to illicit channels.   
 
Guatemala   
 
In 2018, the Guatemalan Vice Minister of Counter Narcotics devoted increased attention to the 
problem of precursor chemical diversion, after an annual seizure of 26 MT of precursor 
chemicals used to produce heroin, cocaine hydrochloride, and methamphetamine.  However, the 
Ministry of Health is responsible for the regulation of chemicals in Guatemala and lacks the 
investigative depth to verify any information beyond cursory regulatory permits.   
 


INCSR 2019 Volume 1 
 
 
 
 
Chemical Controls 
 
60 
 
Due to a lack of cooperation between investigators and regulators, the Guatemalan government 
determined that it lacked legal standing to seize these chemicals, and these 26 MT were 
ultimately returned to their owner.  Existing Guatemalan laws and regulations are not sufficiently 
utilized to determine whether chemical imports are ultimately used for legitimate commercial 
purposes or diverted to produce illicit drugs.  Additionally, there are no verifications in place that 
would allow authorities to determine whether quantities of imports are reasonable for stated 
commercial purposes.   
 
To improve the local government’s capability to manage the precursor chemical issue, the U.S. 
government supported training to increase the Guatemalan government’s ability investigate, and 
interdict precursors in 2018, as well as promote improved interagency cooperation.  The United 
States is also working with Guatemalan authorities to establish a Precursor Chemicals Response 
Team, and provides training to local investigators on precursor cases.  In addition, the United 
States is providing training for up to 50 drug detection canines to detect precursor chemicals and 
synthetic drugs, including fentanyl.  
  
Since 2005, the Guatemalan government has been storing large quantities of seized precursor 
chemicals, though an incinerator donated by the United States in 2017 continues to be utilized by 
local authorities to reduce the backlog.  As of October 2018, there were approximately 2,400 MT 
of seized precursor chemicals in Guatemala.  Authorities are working to consolidate seized 
precursors currently stored around the country at the incinerator site.   
 
Honduras   
 
Precursor chemical diversion continues to be a problem in Honduras.  The Government of 
Honduras works closely with U.S. authorities to disrupt the importation and diversion of 
precursor chemicals through Honduras.  The United States provides training and other assistance 
to help strengthen the capacity of Honduran institutions responsible for controlling precursor 
chemicals.   
 
Scientific knowledge within Honduras about precursor chemicals is limited and often out of date, 
and information sharing between government institutions regarding synthetic drug and precursor 
chemical trafficking is challenging.  The responsibility for the control of precursor chemicals is 
spread through a variety of agencies in Honduras including the Directorate of Investigation and 
Intelligence; the Directorate for the Fight against Drug Trafficking; the Public Ministry; the 
HNP; the Health Ministry, the Agency of Sanitary regulation and the Customs Authority.  These 
agencies have limited experience working together and do not have an established means to 
collaborate comprehensively to combat the diversion of precursor chemicals. 
 
The 1989 Law on the Misuse and Illicit Traffic of Drugs and Psychotropic Substances is the 
current legislation governing the illicit movement of precursor chemicals, but the legislation does 
not adequately address synthetic drug trafficking or precursor chemicals.  The Precursor 
Chemical and Synthetic drug Board is working with health, justice, and law enforcement 
officials to draft a specific law to address the trafficking of chemical precursors.

Argentina 
 
Argentina’s proximity to top cocaine producing nations and its role as a large producer of 
chemical precursors makes it vulnerable to the use of precursors in the production of illegal 
narcotics.  Argentina has enacted legislative measures to curb the illicit use and diversion of 
chemical precursors.  The Security Ministry’s National Register of Chemical Precursors was 
created in 2005.  Its Federal Council for Chemical Precursors is responsible for analysis and 
investigations of crimes associated with chemical precursor diversions.  Argentina maintains a 
focus on chemical precursors used in the production of cocaine, but is shifting attention towards 
those used in the production of methamphetamines and synthetic drugs. 
 
Brazil  
 
Brazil is one of the world’s 10 largest chemical producing countries by volume.  Brazil licenses, 
controls, and inspects essential and precursor chemical products, including potassium 
permanganate and acetic anhydride, in conformity with its obligations under the 1988 UN Drug 
Convention.  Controls on both potassium permanganate and acetic anhydride allow for 
commercial sales without restriction for quantities of up to one kg for potassium permanganate 
and one liter of acetic anhydride. 
 
The Brazilian Federal Police (DPF) Chemical Division controls and monitors 146 chemical 
products in conjunction with 27 DPF regional divisions and 97 resident offices.  The Chemical 
Division is composed of two units: the Chemical Control Division, subordinate to the DPF 
Executive Directorate, and the Criminal Diversion Investigations unit under the Organized Crime 
Division.  Both divisions routinely coordinate and share information when conducting 
administrative inspections and criminal investigations. 
 
The Brazilian National Health Surveillance Agency (ANVISA) controls precursor chemical 
substances used in the pharmaceutical industry.  In March 2017, ANVISA added ANPP and NPP 
to its list of controlled chemical substances, without banning their use. 
 
Regulatory guidelines require chemical handlers to be registered and licensed to conduct 
activities such as manufacturing, importing, exporting, storing, transporting, commercializing 
and distributing chemicals.  The DPF uses a National Computerized System of Chemical Control 
to monitor all chemical movements in the country, including imports/exports, and licensing.  
This system requires all companies to register with an online system and to report all activity 
conducted, including the submission of monthly reports for all chemical related movements and 
existing chemical inventories. 
 
Brazil reports to the INCB its annual estimates of legitimate requirements for ephedrine and 
pseudoephedrine for quantities above 10 grams, and P-2-P in any amount using the INCB’s PEN 
Online.  The DPF routinely uses PEN Online in cases of international trade and in coordination 
with UN member states to alert importing countries with details of an export transaction.

Chile complies with its international obligations to the 1988 UN Drug Convention and furnishes 
reports through the International Narcotic Control Board’s online reporting system, PEN Online.  
Chile has a large mining industry engaged in the manufacturing, import, and export of chemical 
products.  Most of the chemical substances seized by law enforcement are those used for the 
processing of cocaine products, such as sulfuric acid, hydrochloric acid, acetone and sodium 
hydroxide.  Since 2009 there have been no seizures of ephedrine and pseudoephedrine, used as 
precursors for methamphetamine.  The largest imports of controlled chemical substances and 
related products come from Germany and the United States, while Ecuador and Bolivia are the 
primary export destinations. 
 
The regulatory entity for chemical controls is the Unit of Controlled Chemical Substances 
(DSQC), a sub secretariat of the Ministry of Interior and Public Safety.  The DSQC manages the 
System of Registration and Administration of Controlled Chemical Substances (SIREGAD-
SQC), which collects information on the production, manufacture, preparation, importation, and 
exportation of chemical substances that could be used in the production of illicit drugs.  
Companies that import, export, or manufacture chemical precursors must register with 
SIREGAD-SQC, maintain customer records, and are subject to regular inspections.  The new 
online SIREGAD-SQC has improved capabilities for real-time data, and can analyze controlled 
chemical trends in Chile.  Currently, 586 companies are registered in the system.  In 2018, the 
government proposed to add 15 new chemical substances to the country’s control list, among 
them adulterants, bulking drugs derived from cocaine, and substances used for the manufacture 
of synthetic drugs.   
 
Chilean law enforcement entities have specialized chemical diversion units and dedicated 
personnel assigned responsibility for investigating chemical and pharmaceutical diversion cases.  
Customs, which is not a traditional law enforcement agency, has a risk analysis unit that profiles 
suspicious imports and exports, which may include chemical precursors. 
 
During 2017, the Ministry of Interior conducted training sessions for law enforcement and 
security personnel to highlight the role of chemical precursor agents in the illegal manufacture of 
psychoactive drugs.  From 2017 to 2018, the DSQC conducted 304 inspections and audits, which 
resulted in sanctioning procedures against 64 companies for failure to comply with the 
registration and declaration requirements for Chilean precursor chemicals. 
 
Ecuador   
 
Under Ecuadorian law, potassium permanganate and acetic anhydride are designated as 
controlled chemicals.  Buying, selling, or importing such chemicals requires the permission of 
the Ministry of Interior, the primary agency responsible for precursor chemical control in 
Ecuador.  According to Article 219 in the 2014 Penal Code, the use of precursor chemicals to 
produce, manufacture, or prepare illicit materials, such as cocaine or heroin is punishable by 
three to five years in prison.  
 
The chemical unit of the National Antinarcotics Directorate (DNA) in the Ecuadorian National 
Police plays an active role in chemical control by carrying out investigations and intelligence

operations.  Although DNA’s chemical unit is a highly competent entity, its small size and 
outdated technology hinder operations.  The unit conducts limited operations in Esmeraldas and 
Huaquillas, where drug labs and trafficking are prevalent, due to the porous land borders with 
Colombia and Peru.  Because of its small workforce of only 26 employees, the chemical unit 
must often rely on ad hoc support from police officers from other units who generally lack 
adequate chemical training.  
 
Ecuador has been importing large quantities of potassium permanganate for at least the past 
decade.  According to the Central Bank of Ecuador, during the first eight months of 2018, 
Ecuador imported 31.2 MT of potassium permanganate, compared to 40.8 MT in all of 2017.  
Potassium permanganate is a controlled chemical and requires an import license in order to be 
imported into the country.  Most 2018 imports of potassium permanganate originated from 
China.  Similar to potassium permanganate, acetic anhydride is also a controlled chemical 
requiring an import license.  During the first eight months of 2018, Ecuador imported 49.21 MT 
of acetic anhydride, compared to 0.12 MT imported during all of 2017.  There were few imports 
of acetic anhydride imports in 2017 due to vendor difficulties in complying with importing 
controls that year.  Most 2018 imports of acetic anhydride originated from Mexico.  Traffickers 
also continue to smuggle liquid chemicals, including ether, from Ecuador to Colombia and Peru 
for cocaine processing.  
 
Venezuela 
 
Limited coca cultivation occurs along Venezuela’s border with Colombia.  Some precursor 
chemicals used to produce cocaine are trafficked through Venezuela, but the quantity is 
unknown.  In 2018, Venezuelan authorities did not release statistics on seizures of drug labs or 
precursor chemicals.  The Venezuelan government has not reported the production of NPS in 
Venezuela. 
 
Asia   
 
Bangladesh   
 
Transnational drug trafficking organizations with connections to Burma and India operate within 
Bangladesh.  Over the past three years, Bangladeshi law enforcement agencies have reported 
trafficking of synthetic drugs such as “yaba” (a mixture of caffeine and methamphetamine, 
sometimes with heroin) and diverted pharmaceutical drugs, such as phensedyl (codeine-based 
cough syrup).  Bangladesh has successfully engaged bilaterally with India to control the 
diversion of phensedyl, and Bangladeshi law enforcement agencies work closely with DEA to 
seize and disrupt illicit drugs and chemicals.  According to the Bangladesh Ministry of Home 
Affairs, phensedyl diversion into the country reduced dramatically in 2018. 
 
In October 2018, Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina approved in principle the draft of 
“Narcotics Control Act 2018,” (NCA 2018) which prescribes a death sentence as a maximum 
punishment for anyone involved in producing, smuggling, distributing or using over five grams 
of yaba or amphetamine-type stimulants (ATS).  The minimum sentence is life in prison.  NCA 
2018 also prescribes between five and 15 years in jail for carrying, trafficking, or smuggling less

than five grams of yaba.  Furthermore, NCA 2018 prescribes a death sentence as maximum 
punishment, and life imprisonment as a minimum, for anyone involved in producing, smuggling, 
distributing, or using 25 grams or more of “Category A” drugs, which include heroin or cocaine.  
Yaba and ATS are elevated to Category A drugs under the NCA 2018.  Officials at the 
Department of Narcotics Control (DNC) and other law enforcement agencies have stated that 
drug offenders exploited loopholes under existing legislation in order to evade punishment. 
 
The Government of Bangladesh is committed to the implementation of the 1988 UN Drug 
Convention and regional agreements regarding control of narcotic drugs, psychotropic 
substances and precursor chemicals.  Twenty-three of the 28 precursor chemicals listed in the 
1988 UN Drug Convention are included in the “Schedule of Drugs” of NCA 1990 to comply 
with the provisions of Article 12 of the 1988 UN Drug Convention.  NCA 1990 also allows 
financial investigations and freezing of assets derived from trafficking in drugs and precursors.  
The government provides the INCB with annual estimates of Bangladesh’s legitimate use 
requirements for imports of the four precursors frequently used in the manufacture of ATS—3, 
4-MDP-2-P, pseudoephedrine, ephedrine, and P-2-P under CND Resolution 49/3. 
 
The Directorate General of Drug Administration has developed a draft national drug policy, 
approved by the Cabinet in December 2016, in response to the threat posed by the abuse of, and 
trafficking in, pharmaceutical preparations and other drugs.  The “National Drug Policy 2016” 
replaced the “National Drug Policy 2005” and aims to ensure that the manufacturing of 
medicines is in compliance with international standards to increase export of pharmaceutical 
items.  The new policy also proposes forming a National Drug Regulatory Authority to stop the 
adulteration of medicines and raw materials.  Responsible authorities will be required to update 
the price of drugs every year and publish the updated prices online. 
 
Bangladesh has a nascent but growing commercial pharmaceutical industry.  Besides meeting 97 
percent of the local demand, many pharmaceutical companies are exporting medicines to over 
122 countries.  In 2015, the first Bangladeshi company received U.S. Food and Drug 
Administration (FDA) approval to export a prescription drug for hypertension to the United 
States, followed by a second approval to export a cardiovascular drug.  Other top listed 
pharmaceutical companies are now trying to get FDA approval to enter the U.S. market. 
 
Bangladeshi pharmaceutical companies focus primarily on branded generic final 
formulations.  About 85 percent of the drugs sold in Bangladesh are generic and 15 percent are 
patented drugs.  Bangladesh manufactures more than 450 generic drugs, sold under 5,300 
registered brands that have 8,300 different dosages and strengths.  These include a wide range of 
products from anti-ulcerants, flouroquinolones, anti-rheumatic non-steroid drugs, non-narcotic 
analgesics, anti-histamines, and oral anti-diabetic drugs.  Bangladesh is also producing high-tech 
medicines like anticancer drugs, hormonal products, enzymes and coenzymes at a limited scale, 
meeting only four percent of Bangladesh’s total requirements.  As such, Bangladesh’s chemical 
imports are primarily in these pharmaceutical categories.  
 
China   
 


INCSR 2019 Volume 1 
 
 
 
 
Chemical Controls

China has implemented a strict licensing regime for the production, sale, and transport of drug 
precursor chemicals.  The National Narcotics Control Commission of China (NNCC) is the 
agency with primary responsibility for drug precursor chemical control.  China maintains a list of 
controlled precursor chemicals called the “Catalogue of Precursor Chemicals,” which currently 
includes 32 drug precursor chemicals.  China’s catalogue includes notable precursors potassium 
permanganate (cocaine), acetic anhydride (heroin), and ephedrine and pseudoephedrine 
(methamphetamine).  In February 2018, China added key fentanyl precursors ANPP and NPP to 
the catalogue.  China regularly provides precursor shipment data the INCB’s Pre-Export 
Notification system. 
 
During the November 2018 G-20 Meeting in Buenos Aires, China agreed to reclassify fentanyl 
as a controlled substance in its internal list of regulatory precursor chemicals.  According to 
China’s Foreign Ministry, the country will schedule the entire category of fentanyl-type 
substances as controlled substances, and start the process of revising relevant laws and 
regulations.  Full implementation of this announced reform could make an important impact in 
reducing the availability of fentanyl analogues.   
 
Both U.S. law enforcement and China’s NNCC recognize the diversion of drug precursors to 
illicit manufacture as a significant problem in China.  In their 2017 Annual Drug Report, the 
NNCC reported 388 cases of drug precursor-related crime, an increase of 39.6 percent over the 
previous year.  Additionally, the NNCC reported seizing 2,384 MT of precursor chemicals, an 
increase of 50.5 percent over the previous year.  U.S. law enforcement reports that the most 
common diversion tactic used by traffickers is the intentional mislabeling of shipments 
containing precursors.  Perpetrators caught mislabeling precursor shipments often face only civil 
penalties and small fines rather than criminal charges.  The challenge of preventing precursor 
diversion is further exacerbated by China’s ineffective enforcement of land, air, and sea transport 
regulations. 
   
Hong Kong Special Administrative Region  
 
Hong Kong, a Special Administrative Region of the People’s Republic of China, is neither a 
drug manufacturing nor chemical producing economy.  With well-developed logistics 
connectivity to China, one of the world’s largest precursor chemical exporters, Hong Kong’s 
chemical trade is mostly in the form of imports for consolidation and subsequent re-export or 
transshipments; only small amounts are consumed locally by industrial, pharmaceutical, testing 
or education activities.   
 
In 2017, the most recent year for which data is available, controlled chemical imports totaled 
approximately 12.32 MT, with approximately 1.31 MT re-exported.  Hong Kong supports 
international efforts to prevent precursor chemical diversion through a combination of effective 
legislation, strong law enforcement, and close collaboration with the INCB, other foreign 
counterparts, and the business community. 
 
The Control of Chemicals (COC) Ordinance, in effect since 1996, is Hong Kong’s basic 
legislation for regulating possession, manufacture, transport, and distribution of designated 
controlled chemicals.  In May 2018, the COC Ordinance (Amendment of Schedule 2) Order 


INCSR 2019 Volume 1 
 
 
 
 
Chemical Controls 
 
66 
 
2018 and the Hong Kong Dangerous Drugs Ordinance (DDO) (Amendment of First Schedule) 
Order 2018 came into effect.  The COC Order added a total of 29 chemicals, including ANPP 
and NPP, two precursor chemicals used in the synthesis of fentanyl and its analogues, and all 
chemicals in the 1988 UN Drug Convention, to Schedule 2 of the COC.   
 
The DDO Order added additional synthetic drugs to the First Schedule of the DDO, including 
EPH, MPA, MDMB-CHMICA, SF-APINACA, and the synthetic opioid U-47700.  The COC, 
which establishes a licensing regime over importers, exporters, dealers, traders, manufacturers, 
and handlers of the designated chemicals, applies equally to imports, exports, and 
transshipments.  Permits for every shipment are mandatory.  Government approval for all 
premises and containers used to store such chemicals is also mandatory.  The maximum penalty 
for illicit chemical trafficking is imprisonment for 15 years and a fine of $130,000.  The 
Controlled Chemicals Group (CCG) of the Hong Kong Customs and Excise Department’s Drug 
Investigations Bureau administers and enforces the Ordinance.  
 
Permit applications to handle controlled chemicals, including those for the partial removal of 
chemicals while in transit, must be received by CCG at least 10 days prior to the proposed date 
of activity.  CCG uses this interim period to establish the bona fides of a proposed shipment, 
including through coordination with foreign counterparts via the Pre-Export Notification System.  
Export permits are only issued upon receipt of “No Objection” letters from competent authorities 
in importing jurisdictions.  While Hong Kong does not control sales of over-the-counter 
medicines containing ephedrine and pseudoephedrine, CCG does investigate reports of possible 
diversion or parallel trading involving those substances. 
 
Hong Kong supports international efforts to prevent illicit chemical diversion, though tends to be 
less engaged when chemicals transiting Hong Kong are not controlled in the territory. 
 
India  
  
India’s Narcotic Drugs and Psychotropic Substances Act (NDPS) provides the country’s 
legislative framework to implement precursor chemical control obligations required by the 1988 
UN Drug Convention.  The Act requires control measures pertaining to finished pharmaceutical 
products as well as chemicals used to manufacture those products.   
 
India regulates 19 of the 28 precursor substances scheduled in Tables I and II of the 1988 UN 
Drug Convention.  Of the 19 substances, India’s NDPS Act designates five as “Schedule A” (i.e., 
subject to the most stringent controls): acetic anhydride; ephedrine; pseudoephedrine; n-
acetylanthranilic acid; and anthranilic acid. 
 
India continues to participate in international precursor control initiatives such as the INCB-led 
Project Cohesion and Project Prism.  Nevertheless, precursor chemical diversion from licit 
producers to illicit brokers remains a challenge.  India-based precursor trafficking organizations 
are involved in the illicit exportation and domestic sale of precursor chemicals such as ephedrine 
and pseudoephedrine, both of which are used in the manufacture of methamphetamine.

To avoid Chinese controls on the export of precursors, DEA has observed entrepreneurs and 
dealers shift to India as their new source of supply for precursor chemicals and domestic 
production of drugs including fentanyl.  Multi-ton shipments of precursor materials from India 
have been shipped to Africa and Mexico.  This trend is expected to continue.    
 
Republic of Korea (South Korea) 
 
The Republic of Korea’s well-developed commercial infrastructure renders it an attractive 
location for criminals to obtain and transship precursor chemicals.  Precursor chemicals used to 
manufacture illicit drugs are imported from the United States, Japan, India, and China, and then 
either resold within South Korea or smuggled into other countries.  In 2017, the most recent year 
for which data is available, South Korea imported approximately 38.25 MT of ephedrine, up 
from 28.5 MT in 2016, and approximately 37.75 MT of pseudoephedrine.  As of September 
2018, Korean authorities controlled 33 precursor chemicals, two more than in 2016.  Acetic 
anhydride remains the chemical of greatest concern.  The Republic of Korea imports acetic 
anhydride for legitimate use, such as film production, cigarette filters, and other industrial and 
medical applications.  Law enforcement investigations have traced illicit acetic anhydride 
exports from South Korea to Pakistan and countries in the Middle East. 
  
Both the Korea Customs Service and Ministry of Food and Drug Safety (MFDS) participate in 
INCB-led taskforces, including Projects Cohesion and Prism, which monitor imports of 
potassium permanganate and chemicals used to produce amphetamine-type stimulants.  Korean 
law enforcement authorities also cooperated with Southeast Asian nations to verify documents 
and confirm the identities of importing businesses, including by physical inspection. 
  
The National Assembly passed a law in 2011 requiring manufacturers and exporters of precursor 
chemicals to register with the government.  The MFDS periodically provides training and 
updates to South Korean businesses to keep them from unknowingly exporting precursor 
chemicals to fraudulent importers. 
 
Illegal precursor chemical shipments can be hidden by exploiting South Korean customs and 
chemical regulations.  Most chemicals are shipped by containerized cargo via ocean 
freighters.  The 1,000 kg reporting requirement threshold in the current regulations makes the 
Republic of Korea vulnerable to the “smurfing” of acetic anhydride – a diversion method in 
which smugglers make multiple small quantity purchases from different retail outlets to avoid 
detection, then combine them for shipment.  South Korean authorities work closely with U.S. 
counterparts to track suspect shipments. 
 
Singapore   
 
Singapore’s geographic advantage and robust port infrastructure contribute to its rank as one of 
the world’s top trade hubs, including for the trade of precursor chemicals.  The Government of 
Singapore continues to be a partner with the United States and other concerned countries in 
international chemical control initiatives to prevent the diversion of synthetic drug precursor 
chemicals, including ephedrine, pseudoephedrine and other essential primary chemicals, like 
potassium permanganate and acetic anhydride.  Singapore is one of the largest distributors of

acetic anhydride in Asia.  Used in film processing and the manufacture of plastics, 
pharmaceuticals, and industrial chemicals, acetic anhydride is also the primary acetylating agent 
for heroin.  
 
Singapore does not produce ephedrine or pseudoephedrine; however, Singapore sees significant 
volumes of ephedrine and pseudoephedrine coming through its ports.  In 2017, Singapore 
exported approximately 21 MT of pseudoephedrine (down from 35.29 MT in 2016) and 6.55 MT 
of ephedrine (down from 8.78 MT in 2016).  Singapore imported approximately 23 MT of 
pseudoephedrine and 6.38 MT of ephedrine in 2017 (down from 37.6 MT and 10 MT in 2016).  
 
Most of the ephedrine imported to Singapore originated from India and Taiwan, the bulk of 
which is then re-exported to Indonesia’s pharmaceutical companies.  The imported 
pseudoephedrine originates mostly from India, China, Germany, and Taiwan, and is also often 
re-exported to pharmaceutical companies in Indonesia.  Singapore also exports both chemicals to 
Vietnam, Cambodia, Malaysia, and Nepal for pharmaceutical purposes.  Ephedrine and 
pseudoephedrine that are not re-exported and remain in Singapore are used primarily by the 
domestic pharmaceutical industry.  
 
In 2017, Singapore imported approximately 9.57 MT and exported 9.73 MT of acetic anhydride.  
Singapore imported 23.5 MT and exported 5.26 MT of potassium permanganate.  Singapore uses 
potassium permanganate in the treatment of reclaimed water, rainwater, and seawater, which 
Singapore relies on for over 70 percent of its water supply.   
 
Singapore imported 100 grams of phenyl-2-propanone in 2017.  Singapore did not export any 
phenyl-2-propanone in 2016.  Singapore did not import or export any ANPP and NPP, the two 
primary chemicals used to produce illicit fentanyl and fentanyl analogues.  Since 2012, the 
Singapore Central Narcotics Bureau (CNB) had no diversion-related seizures of ephedrine and 
pseudoephedrine.  
 
The CNB is the competent authority in Singapore for the 1988 UN Drug Convention and is 
tasked with undertaking measures to prevent the diversion of ephedrine and pseudoephedrine.  
All imports, exports and transshipments of these controlled substances require a permit from the 
CNB, and supporting documentation must be kept by the companies for a minimum of two years 
and made available for inspection by the CNB.  Supporting documents may include invoice, sale 
contracts, and documentary proof from the competent authority of the exporting countries.  The 
movement of these controlled substances is also tracked and monitored by CNB.  If the permit 
application is approved, CNB will provide Pre-Export Notification or PEN-Online to the 
competent authority of the importing country for any exportation of substances.  
 
Information on all goods imported and exported through Singapore’s borders must be provided 
in advance to enable Singapore Customs, the Immigration and Checkpoints Authority or other 
controlling agencies to facilitate legitimate and secured trade through measures such as timely 
pre-clearance risk assessment.  Singapore does not currently require advance cargo manifest 
information nor screen transshipments unless they involve conveyances from select countries of 
international concern, a Singapore consignee, or contain strategic or controlled items, including 
certain chemicals.  However, Singapore is conducting a three-year trial of the World Customs 


INCSR 2019 Volume 1 
 
 
 
 
Chemical Controls 
 
69 
 
Organization’s Cargo Targeting System that utilizes carriers’ electronic cargo manifest data 
including transshipments to identify high-risk shipments across a variety of threats.   
 
Singapore solicited carriers to provide data on a voluntary basis; as of October 2018, 11 shipping 
lines were transmitting manifest data electronically, representing over 50 percent of the cargo 
shipments in Singapore.  In instances where precursor diversion for illicit drug manufacturing 
purposes was suspected, Singapore’s authorities have assisted foreign law enforcement agencies.  
The Government of Singapore conducts site visits of companies dealing with controlled 
chemicals to ensure awareness of the requirements and overall compliance.  
 
The Port of Singapore is the world's second busiest port in terms of shipping tonnage and is the 
world's busiest transshipment port.  Singapore’s authorities have never reported a diversion of 
precursor chemicals used in the manufacturing of methamphetamine from Singapore's 
pharmaceutical, biotechnology, and fine chemical industries, nor have they reported the seizure 
of any domestic clandestine methamphetamine laboratories.   
 
Taiwan   
 
The Taiwan Ministry of Economic Affairs Industrial Development Bureau imposes strict 
reporting requirements in tracking the production, distribution, sale, storage, and export/import 
of 25 of the 28 precursor chemicals scheduled under the 1988 UN Drug Convention.  As of 
December 31, 2018, Taiwan’s government had not imposed controls over ANPP and NPP.  In 
January 2019, however, Taiwan’s Ministry of Justice initiated a process to control these 
chemicals.  
 
Taiwan’s Food and Drug Administration (TFDA) supervises the trade and use of finished 
products containing ephedrine, pseudoephedrine, and other chemicals under the Controlled 
Drugs Act, including by end-users such as hospitals.   
 
Thailand   
 
Thailand is not a major source country for drug precursors, nor are precursors widely imported 
into Thailand.  Domestic drug production is relatively limited.  The major drug threat to Thailand 
is finished product, such as crystal methamphetamine and methamphetamine tablets.  
 
According to Thai authorities, most chemicals and precursors are imported for legitimate 
medical and industrial purposes.  For exports, Thai chemical companies sometimes do not 
adequately identify their potential customers and may not be fully aware of the intended use of 
chemical shipments. 
 
The legal and regulatory framework for preventing the diversion of precursors is extensive and 
long-standing, beginning with the Commodity Control Act of 1952.  More recently, Order 
32/2599 (2016) of the National Council for Peace and Order introduced new regulations to 
monitor the import, export, production, trafficking, and possession of precursors and chemicals.  
Pre-export notification is conducted to mitigate diversion.  The Precursor Chemical Control 
Committee, which has been in place since 1993, formulates national strategy on precursor

control.  Thailand is compliant with the controlling chemicals listed under the 1998 UN Drug 
Convention.  
 
In 2018, there were two noteworthy seizures of sodium cyanide totaling 18.5 MT.  Sodium 
cyanide is a non-regulated base chemical used to produce benzyl cyanide, which is a U.S. List I 
precursor chemical.  The chemicals were seized at the border, transiting through Thailand en 
route to Burma for possible use in methamphetamine production.  Although stable in-shipment, 
sodium cyanide produces deadly hydrogen cyanide vapor when mixed with an acid.   
 
Europe   
 
Chemical diversion control within the EU is based upon EU regulations binding on all 28 
member states.  EU regulations meet the chemical control provisions of the 1988 UN Drug 
Convention, including provisions for record-keeping on transactions in controlled chemicals, a 
system of permits or declarations for exports and imports of regulated chemicals, and authority 
for governments to suspend chemical shipments.  EU regulations are updated regularly and 
directly applicable in all EU member states.   
 
EU regulations establish common risk management rules to counter chemical diversion at the 
EU’s borders.  Member states are responsible for investigating and prosecuting violators.   
 
The U.S.-EU Chemical Control Agreement, signed May 28, 1997, is the formal basis for U.S. 
cooperation with the EU and its member states in chemical control through enhanced regulatory 
cooperation and mutual assistance.  The agreement calls for annual meetings of a Joint Follow-
up Group to review implementation of the agreement and to coordinate positions in other areas, 
such as national or joint positions on chemical control matters before larger multilateral fora, 
including the CND.   
 
In December 2013, the EU adopted new basic legislation that strengthens controls on ephedrine 
and pseudoephedrine, and tightens controls on companies in the EU using acetic anhydride.   
 
For external trade, the change strengthened controls on medicinal products containing ephedrine 
or pseudoephedrine exported from or transiting through the EU.  The EU developed a new 
category of scheduled substances (Category 4), imposed mandatory export authorization and pre-
export notification, and extended enforcement power to stop and seize cargo if there is 
“reasonable doubt” concerning the shipment.  For trade within EU territory, compulsory 
registration of end-users for acetic anhydride was introduced by creating a new subcategory 
(2A).  Additionally, a definition of “user” was added for natural or legal persons possessing 
substances for purposes other than placing them in the market.   
 
Other amendments to the regulation to facilitate tracking and enforcement include: clarifying 
definitions for scheduled substance and natural products; strengthening the rules for licensing 
and registration by introducing explicit criteria for granting or refusing licenses and registrations; 
increasing the power of competent authorities to control non-scheduled substances; 
implementing a quick reaction mechanism to add new chemicals to the list of scheduled

substances via the so-called 'catch-all'-provision; and developing an EU database on drug 
precursors, and improving data protection provisions.   
 
In 2015, a Commission Delegated Regulation and a Commission Implementing Regulation 
entered into force (replacing previous implementation legislation).  These regulations complete 
the revision of the EU drug precursor legislation that started at the end of 2013.  However, the 
EU is currently carrying out an evaluation of the EU drug precursor legislation. This is expected 
to be finalized by the end of 2019.  If needed, the EU may introduce amendments to its drug 
precursor legislation.  Additionally, on November 23, 2018, the EU introduced new legislation 
for a quick response to public health and social threats against NPS.  The new legislation intends 
to strengthen the EU Early Warning System and risk assessment procedures on NPS and shortens 
control processes.  
 
Bilateral chemical control cooperation continues between the United States and the EU as well as 
its member states.  Many EU member states participate in voluntary initiatives such as Project 
Cohesion and Project Prism.  In 2007, the EU established guidelines for private sector operators 
involved in trading in precursor chemicals, with a view to offering practical guidance on the 
implementation of the main provisions of EU legislation on precursor chemicals, in particular the 
prevention of illegal diversion.  These guidelines, now titled “Guidelines for Operators – Drug 
Precursors' Control in the EU,” have been updated in 2017.   
 
Germany   
 
Germany continues to be a leading manufacturer of legal pharmaceuticals and chemicals that can 
be used to produce illicit drugs.  According to the most recent available data from 2017, 
Germany was one of the largest global exporters of ephedrine (20.6 MT) and pseudoephedrine 
(259.1 MT), as reported by the Global Trade Atlas (GTA) database, which relies on statistics 
from the European Commission Statistics Office (Eurostat).  Most of the 28 scheduled precursors 
under international control and listed in Tables I and II of the 1988 UN Drug Convention are 
manufactured and/or sold by the German chemical and pharmaceutical industry.  
 
Germany’s National Precursor Monitoring Act complies with EU regulations. Germany has a 
highly developed chemical sector, which is tightly controlled through a combination of national 
and EU regulations, law enforcement action, and voluntary industry compliance.  Cooperation 
between the chemical and pharmaceutical industry, merchants, and German authorities is a key 
element in Germany’s chemical control strategy.   
 
Germany works closely with the UNODC, and is an active participant in chemical control 
initiatives led by the INCB, including Project Prism and Project Cohesion.  The United States 
works closely with Germany’s chemical regulatory agency, the Federal Institute for Drugs and 
Medical Devices, on chemical control issues and exchanges bilateral information to promote 
transnational chemical control initiatives.  German agencies cooperate closely with their U.S. 
counterparts to identify and stop chemical precursor diversion.

The Netherlands   
 
The Netherlands has a large chemical industry with large chemical storage facilities, and 
Rotterdam serves as a major chemical shipping port.  The Netherlands has strong legislation and 
regulatory controls over the industry, and law enforcement authorities track domestic shipments 
and work closely with international partners.  Trade in precursor chemicals is governed by the 
1995 Act on the Prevention of Misuse of Chemicals to Prevent Abuse of Chemical Substances 
(WVMC), which aims to prevent the diversion of legal chemicals.  Parliament approved minor 
legislative changes October 9, 2018, to bring the WVMC in line with changes in EU Regulation.  
Chemical substances are also governed under The Act on Economic Offences and the Opium 
Act, and EU regulations. 
  
Production of synthetic drugs is significant in the Netherlands.  Recent trends show an increase 
in new types of precursors and pre-precursors to circumvent national and international 
legislation.  APAAN is used in amphetamine production and acetic anhydride is used as a pre-
precursor for benzyl methyl ketone (BMK).  Safrole continues to be used as a pre-precursor for 
piperonyl methyl ketone (PMK), though availability has decreased since 2014.  The main (pre-) 
precursors used in the Netherlands are APAA, PMK, and BMK-glycidates. 
  
In recent years, law enforcement, especially in the south, reinforced its efforts to combat 
synthetic drugs and pre-precursors.  
  
The Financial Investigation Service (FIOD) of the Ministry of Finance oversees implementation 
of the WVMC and has responsibility for law enforcement efforts targeting precursors.  Customs 
monitors the trade and production of chemicals. 
  
The chemical industry is legally obliged to report suspicious transactions.  The Netherlands 
abides by all EU regulations for drug precursors.  The Netherlands an active participant and an 
initiator of the INCB-led Project Prism taskforce.  The Dutch government also continues to work 
closely with the United States on precursor chemical controls and investigations.  The 
Netherlands has had a memorandum of understanding with China since 2004 concerning 
chemical precursor investigations. 
  
The Netherlands requires a license for the manufacture and trade of ephedrine.  Relevant reports 
on suspicious transactions are shared nationally and internationally.  The Netherlands also 
monitors a number of non-registered substances used in the production of methamphetamine.   
 
Poland  
 
Poland is both a transit country for drug trafficking and the source of production of synthetic 
drugs for Western European markets.  Poland is one of the major source countries of 
amphetamine-type stimulants in the European market, and in recent years the production of 
methamphetamine has also emerged.  The manufacturing process and the distribution of illicit 
drugs are handled by organized criminal syndicates, which establish, equip, and supply 
clandestine laboratories.  Polish police have reported changes in the modus operandi of criminal

groups, which have started to divide amphetamine manufacturing into stages.  These production 
stages take place in various locations, which tend to change frequently. 
 
The 2005 Act on Counteracting Drug Addiction prohibits the production, import, and marketing 
of precursor chemicals in Poland.  The State Sanitary Inspector exercises supervision over 
compliance with this prohibition.  The division of roles and responsibilities for drug and 
chemical controls in Poland are delineated in a 2011 Memorandum of Understanding between 
the Chief Sanitary Inspector, Commander of the National Police, Customs Service Chief, and 
Chief Pharmaceutical Inspector.  The memorandum lists the goals of the memorandum; general 
provisions; and applicable laws, procedures, and protocols for each entity, as well as information 
sharing agreements.  
 
Poland’s precursor chemical controls are governed by a number of national anti-drug laws, 
which also implement UN and EU requirements on chemical controls.  Most recently, updated 
anti-drug regulations came into force, namely the Act of July 20, 2018, which amended the 2005 
Act on Counteracting Drug Addiction and the Act on the State Sanitary Inspection, as well as the 
August 17, 2018, law regarding the Health Ministry’s list of psychotropic substances, intoxicants 
and NPS.  These recent amendments aim to strengthen the scope of NPS risk assessments, due to 
their growing availability. 
 
The Ministry of Health’s State Sanitary Inspector and State Pharmaceutical Inspector are the lead 
entities in implementing drug and chemical controls.  The State Sanitary Inspector is in charge of 
controls for category 2 and 3 drug precursors (such as permanganate and acetic anhydride), and 
supervises manufacturing, importation, and commercial entities associated with handling these 
substances.  The State Pharmaceutical Inspector is the competent authority in controlling 
category one drug precursors (such as ephedrine and pseudoephedrine) and supervises 
manufacturing, importation, and commercial entities associated with handling these substances.  
In situations of possible illegal handling of said precursors, the relevant Chief Inspectors notify 
the Central Bureau of Investigation Police (CBŚP).  In 2015, an amendment to the 2001 
Pharmaceutical Law came into force, restricting the sale of over-the-counter medical products 
containing psychoactive substances (including pseudoephedrine). 
 
According to the September 6, 2001, Pharmaceutical Law, manufacturers, importers, and 
distributors of pharmaceutical substances must be an approved business entity on Poland’s 
National Register of manufacturers, importers, and distributors of active substances, run by the 
State Pharmaceutical Inspector.  A business entity wanting to enter the market must apply for a 
license, and the State Pharmaceutical Inspector will conduct an inspection of the business entity 
within 60 days.  If approved, the business entity can be registered and begin operating.  The State 
Pharmaceutical Inspector conducts control audits on all registered entities every three years 
thereafter.  Poland’s National Registry complies with EU-Directive 2011/62/EU relating to 
medicinal products for human use.   
 
Polish law enforcement activities are mainly focused on the detection and prevention of the 
illegal production of synthetic stimulants, including the control of precursors and pre-precursors.  
These activities are coordinated by the Central Bureau of Investigation Police (CBŚP), in close 
cooperation with the State Sanitary Service.  In 2016, police reportedly dismantled 24

laboratories: 18 for the production of amphetamine; three for methamphetamine; two for 
mephedrone; and one producing an NPS (4-CMC).  In July 2017, CBŚP, in cooperation with the 
State Sanitary Inspection, dismantled a laboratory producing 4-chlorometcatinone (4-CMC), 
seizing a total of 128 kg of substances in various stages of production, including over 56 kg of 
finished product. 
 
While retail shops selling NPS are actively identified and shut down, challenges persist with 
online sellers of NPS within Poland.  The State Sanitary Inspectorate have also found difficulties 
in prosecuting transnational crimes outside the EU concerning illegal chemical product trade 
through e-commerce.  
 
The Republic of Poland enters information into the PEN system for all exports and imports of 
drug precursors.  This information is forwarded to the International Narcotics Control Board by 
the Main Pharmaceutical Inspector in cooperation with the Chief Sanitary Inspector. 
  
Switzerland   
 
The Government of Switzerland continues to be a strong partner with the United States and other 
concerned countries in international chemical control initiatives to prevent the diversion of 
synthetic drug precursor chemicals, including ephedrine and pseudoephedrine, and other 
primarily essential chemicals, including potassium permanganate and acetic anhydride.  
Switzerland is a significant importer and exporter of ephedrine and pseudoephedrine.   
 
In 2017, according to the most recent available U.S. data, Switzerland imported approximately 
70.94 MT of pseudoephedrine (2nd largest importer) and 1.8 MT of ephedrine (19th largest 
importer).  Switzerland exported approximately 47.3 MT of pseudoephedrine (4th largest 
exporter) and 178 kg of ephedrine (5th largest exporter) during the same period.  Data from Swiss 
Customs shows negligible differences in the amounts listed above, with the exception of 
ephedrine imports, which Swiss Customs data lists at just 176 kg for 2017. 
 
Swiss control measures concerning precursor chemicals such as ephedrine and pseudoephedrine 
are governed by the Federal Narcotics Control Ordinance and the Federal Department of Home 
Affairs’ Ordinance on the Directory of Narcotics.  The Ordinances require importers and 
exporters of ephedrine and pseudoephedrine to obtain a license from Swissmedic, Switzerland’s 
relevant regulatory authority, and require chemical manufacturers to provide “end user” 
certificates.  To more effectively deter illegal dissemination of these precursor chemicals, 
regulations were enacted in October 2017 requiring a license and “end user” certificates for 
import or export of preparations containing these precursor chemicals.  In 2018, there were no 
significant changes reported to Swiss legislation regarding import and export of these substances. 
 
Switzerland participates in multilateral chemical control initiatives led by the INCB, including 
Project Prism and Project Cohesion.  Switzerland also participates in the International Import and 
Export Authorization System (I2ES), which facilitates effective implementation of import and 
export authorization systems for legal international trade in narcotic drugs and psychotropic 
substances.

Swiss law enforcement agencies have established close cooperation with the Swiss chemical 
manufacturing and trading industries and counterparts in major chemical manufacturing and 
trading countries.  This cooperation includes information exchanges in support of chemical 
control programs and in the investigation of diversion attempts.  Cooperation between U.S. and 
Swiss law enforcement agencies on chemical control related issues is excellent, particularly with 
the Swiss Federal Criminal Police. 
  
The United Kingdom   
 
The UK is a leading producer of precursor chemicals commonly used to manufacture illicit 
drugs.  However, because the UK applies a strict regulatory regime to control the production and 
trade of precursor chemicals, only relatively small amounts of these chemicals are believed to be 
diverted for illicit use.  Between January 2017 and early 2018, the UK Border Force seized over 
two metric tons of precursor chemicals destined for northwest England intended for the illicit 
manufacture of amphetamine-type stimulants and methamphetamine.  Law enforcement 
authorities estimate that this volume of chemicals had the potential to produce as much as two 
metric tons of unadulterated amphetamine sulphate, with an estimated street value of over $51 
million.  The United States and United Kingdom cooperate closely in international bodies to 
promote global regulation of precursor chemical.   
   
Middle East   
 
Egypt 
 
Egypt oversees the import and export of all internationally-recognized chemicals through a 
committee composed of the Ministry of Interior (ANGA), Ministry of Finance (Customs), and 
Ministry of Health (Pharmaceutical).  This committee approves or denies requests to import or 
export chemicals.  Over the past few years, there was a spike in the importation of ephedrine.  
With the large amounts of ephedrine imported relative to the population of Egypt, it is possible 
that not all of it is used for legitimate medicinal production.  However, the Egyptian government 
has not reported any large scale diversion of ephedrine or observed any increase in the use of 
methamphetamine.   
 
During 2018, there was an increase in the amount of tramadol seized by the Egyptian 
government at the ports.  There was also an increase in the amount of heroin smuggled into the 
country, as well as a rise in new drugs combining aromatic plants – such as marjoram or incense 
– infused with synthetic cannabinoids up to 100 times as powerful as natural marijuana.    
 
United Arab Emirates 
 
The United Arab Emirates (UAE) is a major cargo transshipment point, and therefore an ideal 
transit point for precursor chemicals used to produce illicit drugs.  UAE chemical controls and 
customs regulations are based on international conventions, Gulf Cooperation Council 
guidelines, and local laws and ordinances.  In the UAE, the Ministry of Health (MOH), Ministry 
of Climate Change and Environment, and the Export Control Executive Office are responsible 
for the licensing of export and transshipment of controlled chemicals.  UAE authorities adhere to 


INCSR 2019 Volume 1 
 
 
 
 
Chemical Controls 
 
76 
 
UN conventions related to the shipment of chemical precursors and other commodities through 
established licensing procedures.     
 
According to UAE Ministerial Decree No. 1986 issued in 1995, the MOH must approve the 
import of chemicals listed in the 1988 UN Drug Convention, which includes ANPP, NPP, 
potassium permanganate, and acetic anhydride.  The UAE signed onto and implemented the 
convention in May 1990 with publication in the official gazette.  According to the 2015 GCC 
Unified Guide for Customs Procedures at First Points of Entry, shipments of restricted goods 
must include approvals and authorizations from the competent authorities.  These shipments 
must also include the Harmonized System codes for hazardous goods and chemicals on the 
packing list.   
 
In August 2007, the UAE government enacted Federal Law Number 13 of 2007, which bans the 
export or re-export of certain strategic and controlled items and established penalties for parties 
involved in the diversion of controlled shipments, including chemical and biological materials.  
The law authorizes government bodies to restrict or ban the import, export, or re-export of goods 
deemed a threat to UAE national security, foreign policy, natural resources, public health and 
safety, or the environment.   
 
On January 7, 2018, the MOH issued a ministerial decree updating the list of banned 
medications, narcotics, and psychotropic drugs.  The MOH cited concerns over individuals 
importing large quantities of controlled drugs potentially destined for resale rather than personal 
use.  Pharmacy law No. 4 of 1983 and Narcotics Law No. 14 of 1995 warn travelers entering the 
UAE against bringing in controlled or psychotropic medicines and illegal narcotics.  On 
February 10, 2018, the Anti-Narcotics Council approved strategic indicators for combatting 
drugs in order to intensify drug enforcement efforts.   
 
Transshipment of methamphetamine and cocaine precursors is virtually non-existent in UAE 
ports.  However, the UAE is a crossroads for methamphetamine from Iran, heroin from 
Afghanistan, and cocaine from Latin America, in the form of finished product.  Traffickers 
generally prefer to use larger ports in order to increase the odds of evading detection due to the 
large shipping volume at such ports.  Dubai’s Jebel Ali Port is the largest container port in the 
Middle East and the ninth largest in the world, with a total volume of 15.4 million twenty-foot 
equivalent units (TEU) in 2017 and capacity of approximately 20 million TEU.  The Dubai 
Airport Free Zone (DAFZA) and Dubai International Airport Cargo Gateway, formerly Dubai 
Cargo Village, handled 1.74 million tons of freight in 2017 and the Al Maktoum Airport (DWC) 
972,295 tons of air cargo in 2017. 
 
Significant Illicit Drug Manufacturing Countries   
 
This section is also broken down by region and focuses on illicit drug manufacturing countries, 
their chemical control policies, and related efforts.

Inadequate border security and weak enforcement capacity hamper control of precursor 
chemicals in Afghanistan.   
 
Both acetic anhydride and ammonium nitrate are illegal in Afghanistan and have no legitimate 
uses.  Hydrochloric acid, acetone, and sulfuric acid are controlled substances and subject to 
seizure for other reasons, such as customs violations.  Ammonium chloride is not illegal, but if 
found at a laboratory site, Afghan authorities seize and destroy it.  Since 2013, the United States 
has supported the UNODC Container Control Program (CCP) to develop units in Kabul and at 
key ports of entry on Afghanistan’s borders with Pakistan, Uzbekistan, Tajikistan, and Iran.  
Through training and assistance, CCP promotes effective container controls to prevent drug 
trafficking and other illicit activities and to facilitate legitimate trade.  The program enables 
effective information sharing with other countries participating in CCP, especially the 
neighboring Central Asian states. 
 
The Precursor Control Unit (PCU) of the Counter Narcotics Police of Afghanistan is a 
specialized unit devoted to combating the precursor problem.  Afghanistan uses the INCB’s 
PICS to enhance information sharing between national authorities on precursor incidents.  The 
PCU communicates directly with the Central Asian Regional Information and Coordination 
Center for Combating Illicit Trafficking of Narcotic Drugs, Psychotropic Substances and their 
Precursors as well as the Pre-Export Notification system.  Beginning in early 2016, the United 
States funded capacity building for regional PCU staff through a UNODC training program. 
 
Afghanistan maintains a Drug Regulation Committee (DRC) to monitor and regulate the licit 
precursor chemical trade.  The DRC licenses chemicals for licit use and stores data on the use of 
chemicals so authorities can better understand emerging trends.  The DRC also authorizes 
investigations and spot checks on companies importing chemicals. 
   
Burma   
 
The illicit production and export of synthetic drugs in Burma continued to increase in 2018, and 
Shan State has become the locus of synthetic drug production in the region.  The fact that Burma 
does not have a major chemical industry and does not manufacture the precursor chemicals 
necessary to produce heroin and ATS on an industrial scale indicates the sheer volume of 
essential and precursor chemicals smuggled into the country from elsewhere.     
 
Organized criminal syndicates transport precursor chemicals into Burma across porous borders 
primarily from China, and to a lesser degree from Thailand and India.  The precursor chemicals 
are then diverted to clandestine laboratories and refineries in regions of northern and eastern 
Shan State that are under the control of armed ethnic groups or militias.  Recent record-breaking 
seizures along the Burmese-Thai border indicate the establishment of numerous clandestine 
laboratories in key transit towns on the Burmese side of the border.  The best available 
information suggests that significant methamphetamine production takes place in clandestine 
laboratories that operate in the Wa Self-Administered Division in Shan State.     
 


INCSR 2019 Volume 1 
 
 
 
 
Chemical Controls 
 
78 
 
The Supervision Committee for the Control of Precursor Chemicals, which functions within the 
Central Committee for Drug Abuse Control (CCDAC), monitors the possession, use, sale, 
production, and transportation of chemical precursors.  Importers of licit chemicals are required 
to use a pre-import notification system to obtain a certificate of verification from the CCDAC, 
and retailers must also apply for a certificate to transport chemicals across and within Burma’s 
borders.  After the Committee added two precursors (ANPP and NPP) in 2017, there are now 28 
identified precursor chemicals prohibited for import, sale or use in Burma.    
 
However, authorities faced overwhelming challenges that fundamentally limited their ability to 
control the illicit import and diversion of precursor chemicals for use in the production of illegal 
narcotics.  The most significant of these challenges involve extremely porous borders, 
particularly those portions of the border in eastern Shan State that are not under government 
control.  A UNODC finding showed that 70 percent of law enforcement officials in border areas 
had not received any specialized training to police cross-border crimes, nor any training on how 
to conduct presumptive drug and precursor tests in the field. 
 
During the first nine months of 2018, Burmese authorities reported seizing 450,000 tablets of 
pseudoephedrine; 18.66 metric tons of caffeine powder; 47,787 liters of sulfuric acid; 165,733 
liters of hydrochloric acid; 190,578.25 liters of ethyl ether; and 75,450.15 liters of sodium 
hydroxide.  Burma is a party to the 1988 UN Drug Convention, but has not instituted laws to 
meet all of the UN chemical control provisions. 
 
The United States funds UNODC’s support for Border Liaison Offices to strengthen border 
management.  This program includes capacity-building trainings for frontline officers on 
effective uses of field test kits, training-of-trainers courses, and delivery of field test kits.  
UNODC, also with U.S. support, hosted a High-Level Asia Regional Conference on Precursor 
Control in November 2018.  Heads of law enforcement agencies from ASEAN and neighboring 
countries shared information and discussed steps needed to establish a coordinated response to 
precursor chemical diversion and trafficking in the Asia-Pacific region. 
 
Indonesia 
 
Indonesia’s 2009 National Narcotics Law gave the country’s National Narcotics Board of 
Republic of Indonesia (BNN) the authority to monitor narcotics and precursor production at 
pharmaceutical plants, and to conduct investigations and arrests in response to precursor and 
narcotics violations.  Although there were several laws and regulations regarding the import and 
export of precursor chemicals, the extent of enforcement was largely unknown.   
 
Regarding the two most widely sought-after precursor chemicals used for cocaine and heroin 
production – potassium permanganate (cocaine) and acetic anhydride (heroin) – the United 
States was unaware of a single seizure in 2018 by Indonesian law enforcement.  BNN reported 
that it regularly conducts unannounced inspections to companies that are listed importers of 
precursor chemicals.  In the past year, BNN hired an additional 300 personnel.   
 
Every year, through the Ministry of Health, Indonesia reports estimates of its legal domestic 
narcotics precursors to the International Narcotics Control Board.  The bulk of precursors comes

in via ocean routes from China, Taiwan, and India; however, Indonesia is not a prime destination 
for precursors, as the vast majority of illegal narcotics is not manufactured within country.   
  
Pakistan   
 
Pakistan is a destination and transshipment point for diverted shipments of acetic anhydride and 
other precursor chemicals used in the production of heroin and amphetamine-type stimulants.  
Pakistan does not domestically produce industrial-scale quantities of either acetic anhydride or 
ephedrine, though it has chemical and pharmaceutical industries with a legitimate, albeit modest, 
demand for these substances.   
 
Pakistan enforces a basic precursor control regime as part of its obligations under the UN drug 
control conventions, covering the import of seven multi-use chemicals: acetic anhydride; 
pseudoephedrine; anthranilic acid; acetone; potassium permanganate; methyl-ethyl ketone; and 
toluene.  The country’s Anti-Narcotics Force (ANF) is charged with managing precursor control 
and does so largely by conducting ground checks on importing businesses, licensing those 
businesses, and reviewing Pre-Export Notifications (PENs) requesting the sale of these 
substances within Pakistan.  Besides ANF, 15 federal and provincial agencies share 
responsibility for chemical control throughout the country.  Per UN Commission on Narcotic 
Drugs Resolution 49/3, ANF established two review committees to manage the precursor control 
mechanism, the Committee for Granting Non Objection Certificates to Companies and Firms for 
Use of Precursor Chemicals and the Committee for Quota Allocation to Pharmaceutical 
Companies.  
   
During the first nine months of 2018, ANF received 63 PENs, approving 54 and denying nine.  It 
is likely that significant imports of precursor chemicals circumvent the PENs system via 
mislabeled shipping containers and by maritime smuggling along Pakistan’s coastline.  During 
the first nine months of 2018, ANF reported seizing 4,283 liters of acetic anhydride.  
   
In 2018, both ANF and Pakistani Customs continued to submit information via the International 
Narcotics Control Board Precursor Incident Communication System, which distributes real-time 
information on precursor seizures to law enforcement agencies worldwide.   
 
The Andean Region   
 
Bolivia   
 
Bolivia’s government passed a Controlled Substances Law in March 2017 that schedules 
precursor chemicals in coordination with the International Narcotic Control Board.  Precursor 
chemicals continue to be diverted through black market channels into Bolivia for processing 
cocaine.  According to the Chemical Substances Investigations Group (GISUQ) of the Bolivian 
counterdrug police (FELCN), the majority of these chemicals come from Brazil, Argentina and 
Chile. 
 
The most common chemicals seized as contraband match those commonly found in drug 
factories (where base paste is prepared) and cocaine labs (where base paste is transformed into 


INCSR 2019 Volume 1 
 
 
 
 
Chemical Controls

cocaine HCl).  In addition to serving as a transit country for illicit drug shipments, Bolivia is also 
a source country for coca and cocaine processing.  The number of labs within Bolivia that 
process Peruvian base paste and Bolivian base paste into cocaine has significantly increased over 
the last five years.  The most common chemicals found in cocaine factories and labs are sulfuric 
acid; hydrochloric acid; sodium carbonate; caustic soda; phenacetin; sodium metabisulfite; 
activated carbon; ethyl acetate; and levamisole.  The last five products are not listed as controlled 
substances under Bolivian law, and GISUQ believes they are alternative chemicals that drug 
producers use to avoid law enforcement controls.  Traffickers use activated carbon to deodorize 
and discolor water and other liquids, and phenacetin, a highly toxic analgesic, is used to increase 
the volume of cocaine. 
 
The GISUQ is charged with locating and interdicting chemicals used in the traditional cocaine 
process, such as sulfuric acid, hydrochloric acid, and gasoline.  The GISUQ coordinates 
activities with the General Directorate for Controlled Substances, a civilian entity under the 
Government of Bolivia that administers and licenses the commercialization and transport of 
controlled substances listed under Bolivian domestic law.  Under the Controlled Substances Law, 
violation of controlled substances could result in penal action against all participants, a change 
from the old law wherein unlicensed transport and commercialization generated only an 
administrative violation.  The new law provides the legal framework for GISUQ, in coordination 
with other agencies, to add or eliminate chemical substances controlled under Bolivian law. 
 
The Bolivian government does not have control regimes for ephedrine and pseudoephedrine.  
The GISUQ, however, coordinates with the Ministry of Health to supervise and interdict illegal 
commercialization of methamphetamine.  In September 2016, the Ministry of Health created the 
State Agency of Medicines and Health Technologies to regulate the use and commercialization 
of synthetic drugs. 
 
In 2018, the GISUQ seized 236.8 MT of solid substances and 597,210 liters of liquid precursor 
chemicals.    
 
Colombia   
 
Precursor chemical diversion in Colombia is a serious problem that the government is working to 
address.  The Colombian government has tightened controls on coca-processing chemicals, 
though traffickers still are able to import them illicitly into Colombia.  Colombian police and 
military forces have stepped up enforcement efforts.  The Ministry of Justice reported that during 
the first nine months of 2018, the Colombian National Police (CNP) and military forces seized 
18,681 MT of solid precursors and 3,815,216 gallons of liquid precursors. 
 
The Colombian government controls the import and distribution of chemicals needed for 
processing coca leaves into cocaine, such as sulfuric acid, hydrochloride acid, and potassium 
permanganate, as well as cement.  It limits production, distribution, and storage of precursors 
nationwide and prohibits gasoline and other chemicals in certain zones.  Additionally, 
Colombian companies are not authorized to export ephedrine or pseudoephedrine in bulk form.  
Colombian law bans all pharmaceutical products containing ephedrine or pseudoephedrine from 
domestic distribution.  


INCSR 2019 Volume 1 
 
 
 
 
Chemical Controls 
 
81 
 
 
Since 2015, the government has focused on regulating essential chemicals for drug production 
and has expanded its enforcement efforts related to these chemicals.  Also in 2015, the 
government began implementing the Information System for the Control of Substances and 
Chemical Products (SICOQ), a tracking tool that the CNP and the Ministry of Justice developed 
to strengthen the control of chemicals in real time.  In October 2018, more than 5,811 companies 
were registered in the platform, which allows the government to track the movement of 
chemicals.  However, of the over 5000 registered companies, only 3,330 have valid government-
issued authorizations for the legal use of controlled substances and chemical products as of 
October 26, 2018.  The remainder either have not yet been inspected or must provide additional 
information regarding their use of chemicals in their businesses. 
 
While the Colombian government has strengthened chemical-control legislation, traffickers are 
still able to camouflage precursors to import them clandestinely into Colombia.  Although 
chemical companies require government permission to import or export specific chemicals and 
controlled substances, the CNP have the burden to prove seized chemicals were intended for 
illicit drug production.  Further, to bring U.S. charges against an illicit chemical trafficker, the 
CNP must be able to prove that the trafficker had knowledge that the chemicals seized were 
going to produce drugs that would end up in the United States.  Additionally, traffickers and 
clandestine laboratories recycle controlled chemicals and replace controlled chemicals with non-
controlled chemicals. 
 
The CNP created a special unit specifically tasked with the interdiction of precursor chemicals.  
The Colombian Marines have also increased their efforts against precursor chemicals traveling 
via rivers, particularly in the Department of Nariño, the department that produces the most coca 
and cocaine in Colombia.  Nariño has over 745 miles of rivers and few roads connecting it to the 
rest of the country, making the riverine route the most attractive option for precursor traffickers.  
Recognizing this challenge, the Colombian Marines have increased the operational tempo on the 
rivers to better cover riverine chokepoints, areas through which traffickers must cross to move 
illicit chemicals. 
 
Peru   
 
Peru is a producer and major importer of chemicals essential to cocaine production.  Chemicals 
are principally imported into Peru licitly by wholesalers through the Port of Callao and are later 
diverted for illicit purposes by smaller actors for cocaine production.  Peru requires all chemical 
sector entities to obtain a license. 
 
Peru’s authority to regulate the precursor chemicals used in illicit drug production is based on 
Legislative Decree 1126 and the regulation set forth in Supreme Decree 010-2015EF, which 
establish protocols for sanctions and fines related to the chemical industry.  However, Supreme 
Decree 010-2015EF is not effectively enforced.  The National Superintendence of Tax 
Administration (SUNAT) is the regulatory agency handling all issues related to the chemical 
industry, but SUNAT does not have law enforcement powers and is limited to investigative 
activities.  SUNAT coordinates with the Peruvian National Police (PNP) to combat diversion of 
precursor chemicals. 


INCSR 2019 Volume 1

The PNP’s Precursor Chemical Unit, DEPCIQ, reported an increase in PNP seizures of precursor 
chemicals over the first nine month of 2018 in comparison to the same period in 2017 – from 
7,826 MT in 2017 to 8,199 MT.  Peru continued to implement the 2015 Precursor Chemicals 
Initiative to cover approximately 70 percent of roads in the VRAEM, the Peru-Bolivia border, as 
well as the Junín, Ayacucho, and Lima regions, utilizing 12 backscatter x-ray scanners in 
strategic corridor routes. 
 
Alleged corruption within SUNAT and the PNP fosters mistrust between the entities, leading to 
an unwillingness by either to share investigative information related to precursor chemicals.   
 
The Ministry of Health manages estimates of Peru’s INCB licit demand for ephedrine, 
pseudoephedrine, and P-2-P.  The Ministry’s Health Department does not have a regulatory or 
enforcement arm to prevent the diversion of chemicals.  According to INCB records, Peru does 
not have strict controls to prevent the diversion of ephedrine, pseudoephedrine, and P-2-P.  
Indications suggest that ephedrine and pseudoephedrine are entering the country in larger 
quantities than required by the INCB assessment.   
 
Major Exporters and Importers of Pseudoephedrine and Ephedrine (Section 722, Combat 
Methamphetamine Epidemic Act “CMEA”)   
 
This section of the INCSR is produced in response to the CMEA’s Section 722 requirement to 
report on the five major importing and exporting countries of the identified methamphetamine 
precursor chemicals.  In meeting the CMEA requirements, the Department of State and DEA 
considered the chemicals involved and the available data on their export, import, worldwide 
production, and the known legitimate demand.  The available data does not address illicit 
trafficking and production.   
 
Ephedrine and pseudoephedrine are no longer the preferred chemicals for methamphetamine 
production shipped to the United States, since traffickers are increasingly using substitutes or 
pre-precursors.  The phenomenon of substitute chemicals used in methamphetamine production 
is particularly observed in Mexico, where the nitrostyrene method is used to produce P-2-P, 
which starts from benzaldehyde and nitroethane, or from the intermediary product 1-phenyl-2-
nitropropene, and in Europe, where the method using APAAN, are largely used.  
Phenylpropanolamine, a third chemical listed in the CMEA, is not a methamphetamine 
precursor, although it can be used as an amphetamine precursor.   
 
In 2000, the FDA issued warnings concerning significant health risks associated with 
phenylpropanolamine.  As a result, phenylpropanolamine is no longer approved for human 
consumption.  Phenylpropanolamine is still imported for veterinary medicines, and for the 
conversion to amphetamine for the legitimate manufacture of pharmaceutical products.  
Phenylpropanolamine is not a methamphetamine precursor chemical, and trade and production 
data are not available on phenylpropanolamine.  Therefore, this section provides information 
only on ephedrine and pseudoephedrine.

The Global Trade Atlas (GTA), compiled by Global Trade Information Services, Inc. 
(WWW.GTIS.COM), provides export and import data for ephedrine and pseudoephedrine 
collected from major trading countries.  However, given the reporting cycles by participating 
countries, data often lags behind one year.  The most recent year for which full-year data is 
available is 2017.  The data, including data from the previous year, is continually revised as 
countries review and revise their data.  GTA data analysis and a chart identifying the sources of 
the data are presented in the tables at the end of this section.    
 
During the preparation of the 2018 CMEA report, GTA data for U.S. exports and imports for 
both ephedrine and pseudoephedrine for calendar years 2014-2016 were updated in light of 
revised estimates provided by DEA.  For the 2019 CMEA report, GTA data for U.S. exports and 
imports for both ephedrine and pseudoephedrine for calendar years 2015-2017 were also updated 
in light of revised estimates provided by DEA.   
 
Obtaining data on legitimate demand also remains problematic.  Such data is still not sufficient 
to enable any accurate estimates of diversion, or to comply with the economic and compliance 
analyses required by the CMEA report.  There are significant numbers of countries that have yet 
to report regularly to the INCB on their reasonable estimates about the trade in the end products 
that form the basis of legitimate demand – although each year the number of countries reporting 
increases.   
 
Nevertheless, many countries do not report trade in ephedrine and pseudoephedrine when it is 
incorporated into a finished pharmaceutical product, in the form of finished dosage units such as 
liquids, tablets, and capsules, due to concerns that this type of information is commercially 
sensitive.  Further challenges include governments that may not be able to ascertain this data if, 
for example, they do not subject pharmaceutical preparations to national control, or if a different 
ministry with different or less stringent means of oversight regulates preparations versus bulk 
chemicals.   
 
Ephedrine and pseudoephedrine pharmaceutical products are not specifically listed chemicals 
under the 1988 UN Drug Convention.  Therefore, reporting licit market trade and demand for 
ephedrine and pseudoephedrine as well pharmaceutical products derived from them is voluntary.  
Even so, the trend toward better reporting has been positive.   
 
Thus far, the economic analysis required by the CMEA remains challenging because of outdated, 
insufficient, and unreliable data.  Often the collection and reporting of such data requires a 
regulatory infrastructure that is beyond the means of some governments.  It is also important to 
note that not all countries are familiar with the methodology and data sources used by the GTA 
to report the final numbers and some countries dispute the accuracy of the data.  This increases 
the difficulty of comparing import or export totals across years.  Itt remains challenging to 
determine with precision the top-five countries exporting and importing the largest amount of 
pseudoephedrine and ephedrine.  
 
Nevertheless, the United States will continue to urge countries in diplomatic and technical fora – 
in both bilateral and multilateral settings – to provide reporting on their licit domestic 
requirements for methamphetamine precursor chemicals to the INCB.  The United States will

also continue to work with the INCB and with authorities in the reporting countries to secure 
explanations for anomalies between reported imports and reported licit domestic requirements, 
and to follow the development of other chemicals used in the production of methamphetamine.  
 
This report provides export and import figures for both ephedrine and pseudoephedrine for 
calendar years 2015-2017.  The report illustrates the wide annual shifts that can occur in some 
countries, reflecting such commercial factors as demand, pricing, and inventory buildup.  GTA 
data on U.S. exports and imports have been included to indicate the importance of the United 
States in international pseudoephedrine and ephedrine trade.  Complete data on the worldwide 
production of pseudoephedrine and ephedrine are not available because major producers will not 
release this proprietary data.

Afghanistan 
 
A.  Introduction 
 
Afghanistan remains the dominant source of the world’s illicit opiate supply.  The insurgency 
and widespread corruption present major challenges to the central government’s efforts to 
establish the physical and economic security necessary to bring the illicit drug trade under 
control.  The UN Office on Drugs and Crime (UNODC) and the Afghan Ministry of Counter 
Narcotics (MCN) estimate the total area under opium poppy cultivation in Afghanistan for the 
2018 season to be approximately 262,673 hectares (ha).  This is a decrease of 20 percent in area 
under cultivation compared with 2017, due largely to an ongoing drought and lower market 
prices.  Afghan opium is typically refined into heroin or morphine in Afghanistan or neighboring 
countries for export.   
 
A symbiotic relationship exists between the insurgency and illicit drug trafficking.  Traffickers 
provide weapons, funding, and material support to the insurgency in exchange for protection.  
Some insurgents traffic drugs or tax their production and transportation to finance their 
operations.  However, trafficking is not limited to insurgent-controlled areas.  The drug trade is 
also a primary driver of corruption, which undermines governance and rule of law throughout 
Afghanistan.  
 
Afghanistan suffers from widespread illicit drug use.  The U.S.-supported 2015 Afghanistan 
National Drug Use Survey profiling urban, rural, and national drug use conservatively estimated 
that roughly 11 percent of the population tested positive for one or more drugs, including 5.3 
percent of the urban population and 13 percent of the rural population.  Drug use by women and 
children is among the highest documented worldwide, and 38.5 percent of rural households 
tested positive for some form of illicit drug.  These figures portend a massive health crisis that 
Afghans are gradually acknowledging.   
 
Senior Afghan government officials state that the government recognizes the deleterious impact 
of illegal drugs and is attempting to address the problem, citing the 2015 adoption of the 
National Drug Action Plan (NDAP) as proof.  Despite public displays of support for this 
comprehensive national drug control strategy, the Afghan government has been slow to 
implement it.  The Afghan government will require financial and technical assistance from the 
international community for the foreseeable future to achieve the NDAP’s objectives. 
 
B.  Drug Control Accomplishments, Policies, and Trends 
 
1. Institutional Development 
 
The Afghan government is publicly committed to confronting the drug problem in Afghanistan, 
focusing particularly on what it identifies as the underlying root causes of the drug economy, 
including instability, poverty, organized crime, and lack of economic opportunity.  MCN is the 
lead agency for developing drug control policy and coordinating related government activities.  
As part of President Ashraf Ghani’s reform agenda, the Afghan National Unity Government 
(GNU) has pledged “to intensify efforts to control narcotic production and sale.”  MCN is also

Country Reports

working to “mainstream” drug control into the activities of the entire government.  Enlisting the 
support of other ministries to counter illicit drugs requires top-level Afghan government support, 
which has been historically lacking.  
 
To combat drug trafficking, the Afghan government, with assistance from the United States and 
other donors, operates the Criminal Justice Task Force (CJTF), a self-contained judicial unit 
established under the 2010 Counter Narcotics Law and housed at the Counternarcotics Justice 
Center (CNJC).  CNJC also houses the Counter Narcotics Tribunal and a detention center.  It 
serves as the central facility for the investigation, prosecution, and trial of major drug and drug-
related corruption cases.  From December 22, 2017, through September 22, 2018 (the first nine 
months of 2018 according to the solar calendar), the CNJC processed 269 cases, involving 322 
suspects.  From these cases, the government confiscated approximately 1.69 metric tons (MT) of 
heroin, along with 19.4 MT of raw opium, 3.87 MT of morphine, and 31.09 MT of hashish. 
 
The United States and Afghanistan have neither a bilateral extradition treaty nor a mutual legal 
assistance treaty in force, but they do cooperate on investigations on a case-by-case basis.  
Afghanistan’s new penal code authorizes confiscating assets (including land, structures, and 
vehicles) used in, or earned through, narcotics production and trafficking.  However, the 
government did not have procedures in place to distribute the proceeds of seized assets to 
support law enforcement. 
 
 
2.  Supply Reduction 
 
According to the 2018 Afghanistan Opium Survey – jointly produced by UNODC and MCN – 
growers cultivated 262,673 ha of opium poppy in 2018, a 20 percent decrease from 2017.  MCN 
analysis suggests the decrease is due to both lowered crop yield resulting from drought 
conditions and a low market price following 2017’s record crop.  The 2018 poppy cultivation 
figure for Helmand province was 136,798 ha, which was the highest of any province and 48 
percent of the 2018 country total.  U.S. government estimates for 2018 Afghanistan opium 
production were not available at the time of this report.  Aside from opium, Afghanistan 
cultivates cannabis and produces significant amounts of hashish.  The latest available cannabis 
survey (2012) estimates that 10,000 ha of commercial cannabis cultivation is sufficient to 
potentially produce approximately 1,400 MT of hashish. 
  
Poppy eradication decreased in 2018, with officials destroying 327 ha of opium poppy fields, 
compared to 750 ha in 2017.  This is well short of eradication totals in 2015 (3,760), 2014 
(2,692), and 2013 (7,348).  Only four provinces conducted eradication in 2018, and the majority 
of eradication took place in Nangarhar province (287 ha).  Deteriorating security conditions, 
changes in the way eradicated fields are verified, a lack of political will, Taliban control over 
many rural areas, and MCN’s ineffective management of the Afghan inter-ministerial process all 
contributed to anemic eradication efforts in 2018.  The United States supports the Afghan 
government-led eradication efforts through the Governor-Led Eradication (GLE) program that 
reimburses provincial governors at a rate of $250 per hectare for costs associated with verified 
poppy eradication.

The Counter Narcotics Police of Afghanistan (CNPA) are increasingly able to plan and conduct 
effective counterdrug operations.  The United States supports specialized units within the CNPA, 
including the Sensitive Investigative Unit (SIU) and the National Interdiction Unit (NIU).  These 
units are mentored by the U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) and U.S. Special 
Operations Forces, a relationship that has increased access to key military enablers and has led to 
record seizures.  During the first nine months of 2018, the NIU and the SIU conducted 85 joint 
operations and reported the seizure of drugs and chemicals worth more than $109 million, 
including nine MT of opium, 1.3 MT of heroin, and 15.7 MT of morphine base, according to 
figures provided to DEA by the Afghan specialized units.  Additionally, the NIU and SIU 
arrested 175 individuals during this period, including 29 leaders identified by DEA as “Major 
Targets.”    
 
Primary trafficking routes into and out of Afghanistan are through the Balkan route (Iran to 
Turkey to Eastern and Western Europe); the southern route (Pakistan and Iran to Africa, Europe, 
Asia, the Middle East, and Canada); and the northern route (Central Asia to the Russian 
Federation).  Clandestine drug laboratories within Afghanistan and in neighboring countries 
process a large portion of the country's opium into heroin and morphine, illicitly importing large 
quantities of precursor chemicals to facilitate production.  NIU operations targeting these 
laboratories and chemicals resulted in the destruction of over 100 laboratories and the reported 
seizure of nearly 93,800 liters and 16.3 MT of precursor chemicals during the first nine months 
of 2018.   
 
 
3.  Public Information, Prevention, and Treatment 
 
The Afghan government acknowledges that Afghanistan has one of the highest substance abuse 
rates in the world.  The 2015 Afghanistan National Drug Use Survey identified that rural drug 
use is far higher than urban use, and more than 38 percent of rural Afghan households included 
at least one member who tested positive for some form of illicit drug.  To stem the effects of this 
public health crisis, the United States funded a rural treatment pilot project to expand substance 
abuse treatment to the hardest hit local communities, in addition to continuing to support 86 drug 
treatment centers across the country in conjunction with the Ministry of Public Health.  The 
demand for treatment and prevention services far exceeds the capacity of the centers, most of 
which have extensive waiting lists for new patients.  The United States also supports UNODC’s 
global children’s addiction program to develop protocols for treating children, training treatment 
staff, and delivering services through non-governmental organizations.  
 
The United States engages in robust public information programming and funds communication 
and outreach programs aimed at discouraging poppy cultivation, preventing drug use, and 
encouraging licit crop cultivation.  The United States also supports an anti-drug curriculum in 
Afghan schools, which has trained more than 1,900 teachers and reached more than 600,000 
students in 900 schools.    
 
 
4.  Corruption 
 
The Afghan Government as a whole does not encourage or facilitate illicit drug production or 
distribution, nor is it involved in laundering illicit proceeds.  Widespread and longstanding 


INCSR 2019 Volume 1  
 
 
 
 
Country Reports 
98 
 
credible allegations and media reporting suggest, however, that many individual government 
officials directly engage in, and benefit from, the drug trade.  Corrupt practices range from 
facilitating drug activities to benefiting from drug trade revenue streams, to thwarting arrests and 
prosecutions. 
 
C.  National Goals, Bilateral Cooperation, and U.S. Policy Initiatives 
 
In, 2015, President Ghani approved a four-year National Drug Action Plan (NDAP), establishing 
three interrelated goals:  1) decrease the cultivation of opium poppy; 2) decrease the production 
and trafficking of opiates; and 3) reduce the demand for illicit drugs while increasing the 
provision of treatment for users.  The NDAP targets all facets of the drug trade, from cultivation 
and production to trafficking and use, by employing incentives such as alternative development 
and deterrents such as eradication, interdiction, and prosecution.  The U.S. government’s drug 
control priorities for Afghanistan include disrupting the drug trade and targeting drug revenues 
that finance the insurgency; developing licit alternative livelihoods; strengthening law 
enforcement and eradication efforts; reducing the demand for drugs; and building the Afghan 
government’s drug control capacity.  
 
More broadly, the United States seeks to restore Afghanistan’s agriculture economy, to 
strengthen its institutional capacity, and to disrupt the nexus of drugs, insurgents, and corruption.  
Agriculture accounts for one quarter of Afghanistan’s gross domestic product and employs 
approximately 62 percent of its workforce; a key challenge to reducing drug production is 
developing economically viable alternatives to poppy and sustained workforce employment.  The 
United States, in coordination with Afghan and international partners, promotes licit crop 
production where poppy is cultivated and funds projects designed to support farmers and agri-
businesses in targeted value chains, including wheat, livestock, and high-value horticulture.  
 
The United States is currently implementing alternative development initiatives, within the 
framework of the Afghanistan Integrated Country Strategy, to reduce illicit drug production and 
promote sustainable agriculture-led economic growth.  The Boost Alternative Development 
Interventions through Licit Livelihoods (BADILL) project, implemented by UNODC, aims to 
strengthen and diversify licit livelihoods of small and marginal farmers through alternative 
development methods.  The project supports and strengthens selected value chains in production, 
processing, quality control, and market linkages across 13 target provinces.  The Community-
Based Agriculture and Rural Development projects implemented by the UN Development 
Program (UNDP) work to improve household income while reducing dependency on illicit 
poppy cultivation for selected communities in 12 high-poppy cultivating districts in Badghis, 
Farah, and Nangarhar provinces.  The projects will also develop and strengthen community-
based agri-business infrastructure, such as irrigation, transportation, and storage facilities. 
 
D.  Conclusion 
 
The illicit cultivation, production, trade, and use of illicit drugs undermine public health and 
good governance in Afghanistan, while fueling corruption, providing significant funding for 
insurgents, and eroding security.  Opium cultivation is most prevalent where physical and 
economic infrastructure is least developed, and where the Afghan government lacks control.

Afghanistan will not succeed in combating the drug trade and drug use until Afghans view illicit 
drugs as a serious domestic problem.  That awareness is slowly building, but will remain 
incomplete until the Afghan government demonstrates the political will to challenge vested 
political and economic interests more robustly.  
 
Most importantly, security will need to be established in areas controlled or contested by the 
Taliban before meaningful progress can be expected.  Afghanistan cannot interdict or eradicate 
itself out of this problem.  Alternative development, demand reduction, and public information, 
are important elements of a comprehensive poppy reduction strategy.  Increased efforts to 
enforce Afghan laws against illicit poppy cultivation and to arrest traffickers are necessary for 
success.  In addition to mainstreaming drug control efforts into other existing national strategies 
and programs, Afghanistan must actively combat corruption at all levels of government to regain 
public trust in its counterdrug campaigns, and ensure that provincial governors and other sub-
national officials genuinely cooperate on national drug control plans and policies.  None of these 
achievements would be sufficient by itself, and each faces significant challenges in the coming 
years.  Success in countering Afghanistan’s place in the global drug trade will not come quickly 
or easily.

Albania 
 
Albania is both a source country of cannabis and, increasingly, a transit country for cocaine and 
heroin commanded largely by organized crime elements moving illicit drugs from source 
countries into European markets.  The volume of drug seizures and number of drug-related 
arrests in 2018 was significant, driven largely by Albanian law enforcement cooperation with 
international partners, increased international pressure, and Albania’s efforts to accede to the 
European Union.   
 
Albania’s role as source or market for illicit drugs beyond cannabis is minor, but there has been 
an increase in seizures of cocaine transiting Albania to Europe, in addition to discoveries of 
heroin and cocaine processing labs in northern and central Albania.  Albanian crime groups 
traffic cocaine and heroin to European markets from source countries in South America and 
Asia. 
 
Albania’s institutions are moderately equipped to fight drug crimes, but corruption at every level 
of government limits their overall effectiveness.  Official corruption is pervasive and fosters an 
environment in which drug traffickers are largely able to operate with impunity.   
 
Efforts to eradicate and prosecute cannabis growers have been extensive but uneven, and 
disrupting the drug trafficking infrastructure that has developed over two decades is a challenge.  
A high rate of unemployment and weak rule of law have created an ideal environment for the 
organized crime groups driving Albania’s drug control problem.  Albania’s exportation of 
cannabis and movement of illicit drugs to European markets is a highly lucrative enterprise for 
drug traffickers.  The status quo, which infrequently leads to convictions or imprisonment, is no 
deterrent for criminals.  Albania is, however, moving towards justice reform to prosecute and 
convict criminals of trafficking drugs by leveraging organized crime affiliation.  Prosecutors now 
combine drug-related charges with organized crime charges.   
 
U.S. assistance supports Albania’s integrated border-management risk analysis to identify 
potential drug traffickers; law enforcement training on investigative techniques; provision of 
equipment to enhance drug search capabilities; and implementation of justice reforms that are 
impacting the legal landscape of drug trafficking.  Sustained U.S. engagement has increased 
Albania’s ability to detect drug smuggling at borders and set up a framework for Albania to 
target organized crime rings moving illicit drugs across the globe.  It is vital that the Albanian 
government continues implementation of justice reform and works to erode the influence of 
organized crime.

Algeria 
 
Algeria is principally a transit country for illicit drugs rather than a center of production or 
consumption.  The Government of Algeria is actively working to address the problem through 
increased enforcement and treatment efforts.  Although the Algerian government’s security 
forces focus primarily on counter-terrorism efforts and border security, officials have become 
increasingly concerned about possible links between al-Qa’ida in the Islamic Maghreb and drug 
trafficking.  Algerian authorities report the bulk of drugs transiting Algeria consisted of cannabis 
originating from Morocco.  Traffickers also smuggle smaller quantities of cocaine, heroin, and 
psychotropic drugs into and through Algeria.  Most of these drugs travel by sea to Europe, while 
some are smuggled overland to Middle Eastern destinations.  Algeria‘s borders stretch over 
4,000 miles and are sparsely populated and difficult to monitor.  Cannabis resin remains the most 
widely consumed and transited drug, though cocaine, heroin, and psychotropic substances are 
also used and trafficked through the country.  
 
The government is combatting domestic consumption of illicit drugs through expanding facilities 
for treating drug addiction.  Currently, there are 42 Intermediate Addiction Treatment Centers 
(CISAS) operating in Algeria.  Patients received at these centers rose from 9,897 in 2007 to 
22,444 in 2017.  Voluntary hospitalization, therapeutic interventions, and outpatient 
consultations form the basis of CISAS treatment. 
 
Algerian law provides for jail time of up to two years for use and between 10-20 years for drug 
trafficking and distribution.  For consumption cases, the law gives preference to treatment over 
penal judgments.  Algeria has updated its drug control regulations to conform to international 
agreements, including relevant UN treaties.  Algeria works within the Euro-Mediterranean 
cooperation network MedNET, created in 2006 to advance regional cooperation in the fight 
against drugs. 
 
The National Office for the Fight Against Drugs and Addiction coordinates the Government of 
Algeria’s drug policies and produces official reports on the country’s drug problem.  The 
National Police, Customs, and National Gendarmerie are responsible for day-to-day 
enforcement.  During the first eight months of 2018, authorities seized 27.7 metric tons of 
cannabis and 958,476 doses of psychotropic substances, and arrested 33,595 individuals on drug-
related charges.  In May 2018, authorities seized a shipment of 701 kilograms of cocaine in the 
port of Oran.  Algeria would benefit from further training to boost counterdrug capabilities of its 
security forces.

Argentina 
 
Transnational criminal organizations utilize Argentina as a transshipment point for Andean 
cocaine destined to European and other international markets.  Domestic cocaine processing and 
consumption are growing concerns, and the consumption of domestically processed cocaine base 
is prevalent in poorer neighborhoods.  U.S.-Argentine security cooperation has strengthened 
under President Mauricio Macri’s administration.  The Security Ministry has adopted best 
practices from U.S. law enforcement, strengthening collaborative criminal intelligence efforts 
between federal and provincial forces through interagency task forces.  An interagency task force 
launched in 2018 in Salta province focuses on a key entry point for Andean cocaine.   
 
The government unveiled a national program to combat drug trafficking in 2016 that proposed 
increased targeting of drug trafficking organizations and efforts to reduce cocaine base 
consumption.  A presidential decree in 2016 declared a state of national emergency that resulted 
in the federal Drug Demand Reduction Agency implementing demand reduction policies 
throughout the country.  The government continues to deploy federal forces into major urban 
centers in response to public safety concerns.  These efforts reduce resources available for 
combating smuggling at the border and along key corridors.  In July 2018, President Macri 
issued executive decree 683 authorizing the military to support domestic civilian security efforts 
against non-state actors, including transnational drug traffickers.    
 
Seizures of cocaine conversion laboratories and the availability of cocaine base suggested 
increased domestic processing.  Official statistics show seizures of cocaine, marijuana, and 
synthetic drugs all increased from 2015 to 2017.  During the first 10 months of 2018, Argentine 
authorities reported seizing approximately 137.8 metric tons (MT) of marijuana and 5.56 MT of 
cocaine, a 66 percent increase and a 35 percent drop, respectively.  Most cocaine seizures were 
in the Salta and Jujuy provinces bordering Bolivia and Paraguay.  Marijuana seizures primarily 
were in the Misiones and Corrientes provinces, bordering Brazil and Paraguay.  Argentina is a 
regular participant in the semi-annual Multilateral Maritime Counter Drug Summits, which bring 
together maritime counterdrug professionals from nearly 25 countries and over 65 international 
organizations spanning North, Central and South America, and Europe. 
 
Argentina adopted legal and procedural reforms to improve investigations and prosecutions of 
drug trafficking and other criminal enterprises.  These reforms allow for greater use of certain 
special investigative measures, including informants and undercover officers in investigations.  
New legislation enabling cooperating witnesses helped advance corruption cases. 
 
Constructive measures Argentina could undertake include focusing interdiction efforts on 
targeted regions and transportation sectors; allowing defendant cooperation for sentence 
reductions and controlled deliveries to further investigations; further enhancing federal and 
provincial coordination; boosting judicial efficiency in case management, investigations, and 
prosecutions; increasing border security resources; and coordinating drug supply and demand 
reduction strategies. 
 
Argentina’s extradition, customs, and mutual legal assistance treaties with the United States are 
utilized to the benefit of both countries.

Armenia 
 
Armenia is primarily a transit country for illicit drugs originating in Southwest Asia and destined 
for markets in Europe and Russia.  Most drug supplies transiting Armenia originate in 
Afghanistan and transit Iran before entering Armenia over land borders or by aerial 
transshipment.  The Armenian Government maintains directive control over law enforcement, 
border enforcement, prosecutorial, and judicial functions.  Russian border guards manage 
Armenia’s borders with Turkey and Iran and compose part of the immigration staff at the 
Yerevan and Gyumri international airports.  Armenian law enforcement agencies typically do not 
cooperate with the Armenian customs service on international investigations. 
 
A popular revolution in April-May 2018 resulted in a new government that promised to fight 
corruption, but said little about illicit drugs until October 2018, when the acting prime minister 
pledged to eliminate drug trafficking through Armenia’s Syunik province.  Despite an increase in 
the volume of drugs seized over the first six months of 2018 compared to the same period in 
2017 that included some highly publicized seizures, there have been no arrests of high-level 
criminal figures related to drug trafficking.  Interceptions of large shipments remain rare.   
  
Between January and June 2018, Armenian law enforcement registered 512 criminal cases 
involving illegal distribution of illicit drugs, including 45 cases of drug smuggling.  Authorities 
seized 32.2 kilograms (kg) of illicit drugs, 25.5 grams of psychotropic substances, and three 
grams of precursor chemicals.  Heroin seizures increased by over 300 percent in the first six 
months of 2018 compared to the same period in 2017, which could be due to better screening 
practices at borders and checkpoints and/or a more robust focus on anti-drug policing.  Multi-ton 
quantities of heroin, nevertheless, likely continue to pass through Armenian borders.   
  
On May 1, two Iranian nationals flying to Armenia were detained carrying “large quantities” of 
opium, methamphetamine, and heroin.  In June, Armenia announced the investigation of a 
transnational criminal group that attempted to smuggle opium, heroin, and marijuana from Iran 
through Armenia to Georgia.  On September 30, a Guatemalan citizen was detained at Yerevan’s 
international airport for smuggling 3.5 kg of cocaine.

The Bahamas 
 
A.  Introduction 
 
The Bahamas is not a significant drug producing country, but remains a significant transshipment 
point for illicit drugs bound for the United States and other international markets.  The Bahamas’ 
location, less than 50 miles off the coast of Florida at its closest point, makes it a natural conduit 
for drug trafficking.  The Bahamian archipelago stretches over a nautical area the size of Florida 
with over 700 islands and 2,000 cays, the vast majority of which are uninhabited.  The Bahamas 
boasts 10 international airports, 56 airstrips, and more than 80 marinas.  Traffickers blend in 
among numerous pleasure craft moving between Florida and The Bahamas.  Trafficking also 
occurs through commercial freighters and commercial and private planes.  Trafficking enables 
and strengthens transnational criminal organizations and gang activity.  
 
The United States and The Bahamas enjoy a long-standing history of law enforcement 
cooperation.  There is strong political will within the Bahamian government to tackle drug 
trafficking and organized crime.  Operation Bahamas, Turks and Caicos (OPBAT), a tripartite 
agreement dating back to the 1980s, spells out the obligations of The Bahamas, Turks and Caicos 
Islands, and the United States to improve their effectiveness in the fight against drug trafficking.  
Bolstered by this agreement, Bahamian and U.S. law enforcement agencies have partnered in 
several major law enforcement operations targeting trafficking organizations.  In 2018, these 
operations resulted in numerous arrests and the seizure of cocaine and marijuana.  
 
Demand for cocaine within the country remains low, though a small domestic market does exist.  
Use of marijuana, including among adolescents, remains a concern.  The government is 
reviewing a 2018 CARICOM Regional Commission on Marijuana report that recommended the 
declassification of marijuana as a dangerous drug and its reclassification as a controlled 
substance; however, the government has not proposed any associated policy changes. 
 
B.  Drug Control Accomplishments, Policies, and Trends 
 
 
1.  Institutional Development 
 
During 2018, there was a notable increase in communication, effectiveness, and cooperation 
between Bahamian law enforcement agencies and the United States.  New leadership in the 
Royal Bahamas Police Force (RBPF) and Ministry of National Security, as well as the leadership 
within the Royal Bahamas Defense Force (RBDF), were integral to many of these 
improvements. 
 
The Bahamas passed a new Proceeds of Crime Bill in March 2018, which strengthened the 
measures to recover any income or assets received from criminal activity and created a new 
category for unexplained wealth.  The Bahamas also updated The Financial Transactions 
Reporting Act in 2018, which increased reporting requirements, as well as abilities for 
investigation into financial matters by relevant bodies.  
 


INCSR 2019 Volume 1  
 
 
 
 
Country Reports 
105 
 
The greatest challenge to the host government in tackling the trafficking issue remains the 
weakness of the Bahamian criminal justice sector.  While the average time between initial 
arraignment and trial in 2017 was within 90 days for minor offenses, for more serious matters, 
such as those involving trafficking, smuggling, firearms, or gang violence, regular adjournments 
prolonged cases, in some instances for several years.  Many accused choose to go to trial, 
confident the courts will take years to move their case through the system and the government 
will eventually drop the charges.  Despite these challenges, the Judiciary has begun making 
important improvements.  In 2018, the Magistrate Courts, Supreme Court, and Court of Appeals 
courts introduced U.S.-provided digital audio recording equipment in the courtroom to record 
procedures and serve as the official record in the Magistrate’s courts.  The Judiciary expects this 
improvement to increase both the transparency and efficiency of the justice sector. 
 
The Bahamas signed a comprehensive maritime agreement with the United States in 2004, which 
continues to enable cooperation in counterdrug and migrant interdiction operations in and around 
Bahamian territorial waters.  The Bahamas has an extradition and mutual legal assistance treaty 
(MLAT) in place with the United States.   
 
 
2.  Supply Reduction 
 
U.S. law enforcement agencies integrate with the RBPF and RBDF to gather law enforcement 
intelligence, conduct investigations, and execute interdictions.  These operations are supported 
by marine, technical, and training resources provided through U.S. assistance programs.  With a 
small population base (353,000 according to the 2010 Census) and significant territory to cover, 
pooling U.S. and local resources and knowledge are essential to efficient deterrence and 
interdiction. 
 
Beginning in January, four major law enforcement operations targeting trafficking networks 
were executed within The Bahamas in 2018.  All four operations resulted in multiple arrests, as 
well as weapons and drug interdictions.  For three of the four operations, the RBPF and RBDF 
worked in partnership - a first in many years and a sign of increasing cooperation between the 
two agencies.  Additionally, the RBPF and RBDF prioritized the forward deployment of their 
marine assets throughout the archipelago, improving interdictions further afield, including 
numerous interdictions from the windward pass and throughout the southern Bahamian islands.   
 
On March 20, Bahamian security forces successfully executed Operation Northern Strike, one of 
the most significant Bahamian-planned, executed, and led operations in recent history.  With 
technical assistance and planning support from U.S. law enforcement, Bahamian law 
enforcement accomplished their mission of targeting transnational criminal organizations 
responsible for trafficking drugs, people, and weapons, arresting 51 individuals and confiscating 
narcotics, weapons, and currency.  On September 24, RBPF and RBDF forces successfully 
executed Operation Tidal Surge in the Abaco Islands, targeting another smuggling network.  
This operation resulted in 26 arrests and the seizure of cocaine, marijuana, and weapons.  This 
operation demonstrated the ability of these Bahamian forces and U.S. law enforcement to work 
together and across a distance in the archipelago.  On November 5, RBPF forces intercepted two 
high-speed vessels travelling from Andros Island to Nassau resulting in the seizure of nearly 900 
kilograms (kg) of marijuana.

During the first 10 months of 2018, coordinated U.S.-Bahamian operations in The Bahamas led 
to 203 arrests and the seizure of approximately 176 kg of cocaine, 5.66 metric tons of marijuana, 
and $1,693,809 in currency and $43,400 in assets.  Joint operations also eradicated 2,520 
cannabis plants – an amount similar to 2017 and an indication that cannabis cultivation remains 
steady.  U.S. and local law enforcement investigations indicate that illicit trafficking through The 
Bahamas remains high.  The total number of major operations increased significantly from the 
previous year due to increased levels of cooperation. 
 
Throughout 2018, traffickers continued to split up larger loads into smaller loads before entering 
the southern Bahamas.  Traffickers move cocaine through The Bahamas via “go-fast” boats, 
small commercial freighters, maritime shipping containers, and small aircraft.  Traffickers move 
cocaine from The Bahamas to Florida by blending in with legitimate traffic that transits these 
areas.  Larger go-fast and sport fishing vessels transport marijuana from Jamaica both to The 
Bahamas and through The Bahamas into Florida.  Haitian and Haitian-Bahamian drug trafficking 
organizations, networked between Haiti and the significant Haitian diaspora in The Bahamas, 
continue to play a role in the movement of cocaine. 
 
 
3.  Public Information, Prevention, and Treatment 
 
With U.S. support, the Bahamian government partnered with the Organization of American 
States to conduct a comprehensive drug use survey in 2018.  According to the survey 
respondents, 20 percent of male respondents admitted to smoking marijuana, while the same was 
true for 7 percent of females.  Of the respondents who admitted to smoking, 40 percent admitted 
to smoking on a daily basis.  Only 1 percent of respondents admitted to cocaine usage.  Over 40 
percent claimed to know a friend or family member who takes illegal drugs, with most reporting 
knowing two or more people.   
 
The Public Hospitals Authority offers residential substance abuse treatment programs, drop-in 
treatment programs, substance abuse prevention programs, and relapse prevention programs.  
The United States partnered with the Public Hospitals Authority to train, mentor, and certify drug 
treatment professionals both from within and outside government.  Following the certification of 
its professionals, the Public Hospitals Authority and other partners developed a training program 
for other substance use treatment staff in the country to learn about substance use issues.  From 
the completion of the certification program in 2016, the Public Hospitals Authority has trained 
over 150 staff from local hospitals, the prison, the school for boys and girls, and local emergency 
rooms on New Providence Island and Grand Bahama Island.  
 
The Bahamas Department of Correctional Services has a small residential drug treatment 
program, which can accommodate up to 21 inmates at a time.  The United States has provided 
training for the corrections officers that provide drug treatment programs at the facility; several 
prison guards have also received additional training from the Public Hospitals Authority.  
  
 
4.  Corruption 
 


INCSR 2019 Volume 1  
 
 
 
 
Country Reports 
107 
 
The Government of the Commonwealth of The Bahamas does not, as a matter of government 
policy, encourage or facilitate illicit drug production or distribution, nor is it involved in 
laundering the proceeds of the sale of illicit drugs.  Further, Free National Movement 
government has prioritized addressing public corruption as part of its national agenda.  During 
calendar year 2018, at least four government employees were arrested and charged with drug-
related offenses.  These officials were investigated by the RBPF.    
 
C.  National Goals, Bilateral Cooperation, and U.S. Policy Initiatives 
 
The United States supports a wide range of efforts designed to reduce illicit trafficking, advance 
public safety and citizen security, and promote justice through the Caribbean Basin Security 
Initiative (CBSI).  In 2018, a CBSI-funded maritime surveillance system radar was installed in 
the southern-most island of Great Inagua to provide greater visibility of maritime and air traffic 
through the windward pass.  CBSI funds have also been used over the past two years to provide 
maintenance and logistic support for the RBDF maritime interceptor vessels.  In addition, 
security cooperation activities with the RBDF enhance capabilities in maritime law enforcement, 
intelligence, small boat operations, port security, engineering, disaster relief, and maintenance.   
 
The United States and The Bahamas maintain close maritime law enforcement cooperation and 
coordination under a comprehensive maritime agreement to combat illicit trafficking of illicit 
drugs by sea and air.  The Bahamas is a regular participant in the annual Multilateral Maritime 
Interdiction and Prosecution Summit and hosted the sixth iteration of the summit in Nassau on 
August 7-8, 2018, bringing together over 100 maritime counterdrug professionals from over 15 
countries from across the Caribbean and Europe. 
 
The United States has delivered training, technical assistance, and equipment needed by 
Bahamian government counterparts to combat transnational organized criminal networks and 
improve citizen security in The Bahamas.  In October 2018, the United States completed the 
installation of digital recording equipment in the Magistrates and Supreme Court courtrooms in 
New Providence, Grand Bahama, and Abaco Islands.  The courts use this equipment to record 
court proceedings in support of Bahamian plans to increase justice sector efficiency.  
Additionally, the Embassy donated ballistics vests and protective gear, a new Leica macroscope, 
and updated licenses and training on IBM computer programs to the RBPF.  Finally, the 
Embassy provided training for the Internal Affairs Division within the Bahamas Department of 
Corrections.  
 
The United States sent officials from the police and justice sector to external training focused on 
organized crime, investigating gangs, and trafficking in persons.  The United States organized a 
training for magistrates and registrars to prepare them for the administrational changes involved 
with the new digital audio recording equipment.  Additionally, the United States provided a 
senior justice advisor to meet with key staff in the Ministries of National Security, Legal Affairs, 
and Finance to provide technical assistance as these ministries establish practices to address 
issues with corruption.  The advisor provided guidance on draft legislation, as well as established 
a program for increasing contact between these ministries and several U.S. counterparts.  The 
United States supported Bahamian participation in the International Drug Enforcement 
Conference (organized by DEA) and other regional counterdrug training opportunities.

U.S. assistance for demand reduction supports the Ministry of National Security, the Public 
Hospitals Authority, and nongovernmental organizations.  Additionally, the United States 
supported training focused on drug demand reduction and improved corrections policies 
addressing drug use and demand within prisons.  
 
D.  Conclusion 
 
The United States and The Bahamas enjoy a long-standing cooperative relationship against drug 
trafficking and transnational organized crime.  Drug trafficking and related smuggling will 
remain a primary concern for the United States in The Bahamas.  The United States will continue 
to assist Bahamian efforts to counter these networks and increase efficiencies in the 
administration of justice through a range of assistance, and OPBAT and the CBSI framework 
will continue to bolster Bahamian drug-control institutions and enhance U.S. and Bahamian law 
enforcement relationships.

Belgium 
 
Belgium is a primary entry point for cocaine smuggled into Europe.  South America-based drug 
trafficking organizations transport cocaine through the Port of Antwerp to reach the lucrative 
European drug market and beyond.  Highly profitable cocaine sales in Europe strengthen the 
various drug trafficking organizations, allowing them to expand their reach to other points 
around the world, including the United States.  
 
The Port of Antwerp has experienced record-breaking cocaine seizures over the past several 
years from within containerized cargo arriving at the port.  This is the result of increased coca 
production in Colombia, the port’s relative exposure as an area difficult to fully police, and 
successful law enforcement at other European ports.  Belgian authorities seized approximately 
30 metric tons (MT) of cocaine in 2016, approximately 41 MT of cocaine in 2017, and 
approximately 36 MT of cocaine during the first 10 months of 2018 at the Port of Antwerp.  In 
addition, South American authorities seized approximately 28 MT of cocaine destined for 
Antwerp during the same period in 2018.  
 
The seized cocaine in 2017 alone would have generated more than $1.2 billion in drug proceeds, 
and consequently, significant drug money laundering.  Criminal networks increasingly use 
virtual currencies to facilitate illicit drug trafficking in Belgium.  The online sale of synthetic 
drugs, including via non-searchable web sites (“Dark Web”), has increased significantly, 
resulting in more cyber currency investigations by Belgian police authorities. 
 
Belgium and U.S. law enforcement agencies maintain close operational cooperation, focusing on 
cocaine trafficking and drug money laundering.  The United States and Belgium fully utilize 
extradition and mutual legal assistance agreements.  Despite strong international information 
sharing and cooperation, local capacity issues have prevented police from fully carrying out 
many large-scale drug investigations.  Drug trafficking organizations appear to operate with little 
fear of legal reprisal, in part due to the relative lack of applicable criminal sanctions. 
 
Belgium has not historically been a source of precursor chemicals used to produce illicit drugs, 
despite a robust chemical industry.  Belgium has, however, served as transit point for precursor 
chemicals sourced out of China and India and destined for clandestine synthetic drug laboratories 
in the Netherlands, Mexico, and elsewhere.

Belize 
 
A.  Introduction 
  
Belize is a major transit country for illegal drugs that originate from countries in South America.  
Due to Belize’s location and sparse population, transnational criminal organizations exploit both 
clandestine and legal airstrips to refuel or offload drugs, primarily cocaine, for further 
transshipment by land through Guatemala or Mexico and ultimately to the United States.  
Traffickers also exploit Belize’s offshore barrier islands and porous coastline to move drug 
shipments by “go-fast” boats.  Authorities in 2018 successfully seized 996.2 kilograms (kg) of 
cocaine from aircraft carrying illicit drugs, the first major interdictions in eight years.  Better-
resourced drug interdiction efforts in neighboring Guatemala and nearby Honduras will increase 
the likelihood that traffickers will expand their efforts to exploit Belize’s permissive environment 
and limited law enforcement capacity.   
 
The Belizean police, military, and Coast Guard share responsibility for drug interception, but 
none is adequately resourced.  Belize has no air defense systems, no radar systems capable of 
monitoring night flights, and no maritime radar.  It has significant equipment and equipment 
maintenance needs, limited law enforcement response capability, and systemic investigative and 
prosecutorial limitations.  These resource constraints directly inhibit Belize’s ability to interdict 
shipments and prosecute traffickers.  
  
B.  Drug Control Accomplishment, Policies, and Trends 
  
1.  Institutional Development 
  
The Government of Belize is cognizant of the dangers posed by its status as a transit point.  It is 
particularly concerned that growing violence in Belize is, and will increasingly be, tied to the 
drug trade.  However, Belize’s domestic criminal concerns are focused on extremely high levels 
of local gang-related violence, which is not yet clearly tied to transnational organized crime.  
Members of transnational criminal gangs, such as MS-13, have been arrested in Belize, but such 
regional groups do not appear to be organized in the country.  Given Belize’s resource 
constraints, most of its law enforcement and legislative initiatives are necessarily tied to 
domestic gang activity.  U.S.-funded programs focus on improving specialized units, police and 
criminal justice procedures, border security, technology, information sharing (internally and 
regionally), forensic improvements, and police professionalism.   
 
Belize assists in the capture and repatriation of U.S. citizen fugitives through provisions of the 
Belize Immigration Act.  Extraditions from Belize have been less successful.  A bilateral 
extradition treaty between the United States and Belize has been in force since 2001, and a 
bilateral mutual legal assistance treaty between the United States and Belize has been in force 
since 2003.  Belize also has an extradition treaty with Mexico.  
 
Belize also has a shiprider agreement with the United States (1992, amended in 2000).  Belize’s 
other shiprider agreements are the Agreement Concerning Co-operation in Suppressing Illicit 
Maritime and Air Trafficking in Narcotic Drugs and Psychotropic Substances in the Caribbean

Area and the Proliferation Security Initiative Agreement.  Regionally, Belize is a party to the 
Inter American Convention on Mutual Legal Assistance and the Caribbean Community 
(CARICOM) Mutual Legal Assistance Treaty.  Belize also has a Mutual Legal Assistance Act, 
which provides a basis for considering request for legal assistance with countries with which it 
does not have a legal assistance treaty.  Belize is giving consideration to adhering to the 
CARICOM Arrest Warrant Treaty. 
 
A Pharmaceutical Ad Hoc Committee, established in 2014 to assess the trends relating to the 
movement of pharmaceutical drugs in Belize, dissolved from inactivity.  In late 2018, the 
Ministry of National Security instructed the National Security Council to establish a task force to 
begin collecting precursor chemical data. 
 
2.  Supply Reduction 
 
Belize operates a multi-agency approach to drug interdiction.  The Belize Police Department is 
the primary agency responsible for drug law enforcement.  It has two U.S.-supported specialized 
units – the Anti-Narcotics Unit comprised of 15 police officers and Mobile Interdiction Team 
comprised of 38 members.  The Belize Coast Guard is responsible for the protection of Belize’s 
territorial waters and interdiction of illicit activities in the maritime environment.  The Belize 
Defense Force (army) is often used as a supplemental force.  Interdiction activities are 
coordinated through the Joint Intelligence Operations Center.   
 
Since November 2017, eight aircraft became stranded in Belize, mainly due to suspected damage 
from rough landings at illicit strips.  Authorities seized 556.2 kg of cocaine from one of the 
planes.  An additional seizure of 440 kg of cocaine was made after a ninth illicit aircraft landing.  
Based on the size of the aircraft that are known to have landed, the smallest being a Cessna and 
the largest a Hawker jet, the potential quantity of narcotics transported ranges from 300 to 3,000 
kg per aircraft.  It is unknown how many total aircraft landed and successfully departed 
undetected.   
 
The Belize Defense Force, Coast Guard, Anti-Narcotics Unit, and other police forces conducted 
multiple cannabis eradication operations in the first nine months of 2018.  The Anti-Narcotics 
Unit seized 44.32 kg of cannabis and arrested six persons between those seizures and the aircraft 
interdiction; the Mobile Interdiction Team seized approximately 31 kg of cannabis and arrested 
six persons at highway checkpoints in the same timeframe.  If other seizures are made by the 
police, the numbers are not disseminated. 
 
3.  Public Information, Prevention, and Treatment 
 
Belize’s domestic drug use is difficult to quantify, and no data is collected by the government.  
Historically, marijuana is the primary illicit drug used in the country.  In November 2017, Belize 
decriminalized the possession of up to 10 grams of marijuana for both recreational and medicinal 
purposes.  There are some indications that there is increasing public use of cocaine and crack 
cocaine.  However, Belize does not have the capacity to locally test for cocaine, other narcotics, 
or synthetics by its forensic services.  The public health sector is able to test for marijuana and 
cocaine.

Belize’s National Drug Abuse Control Council (within the Ministry of Health) is the lead agency 
in the prevention and control of drug abuse.  The Council provides drug education prevention 
programs to schools and communities.  Its objective is to reduce the demand and supply of drugs 
and alleviate the associated consequences.  From 2015-2017, the Council provided drug 
prevention education programs to 48,138 students.  Its outreach services for persons living with 
drug addiction grew from 256 clients in 2015 to 373 clients in 2017 (the most recent available 
data).  Its other efforts include attending regional fora and organizing community health and 
education fairs, workshops on drugs and the workplace, and prevention training for school 
counselors.   
 
Belize’s central prison, co-managed by the government and a church-affiliated non-
governmental organization The Kolbe Foundation, launched the Ashcroft Rehabilitation Center 
in 2018.  The program features a group-based approach to address personality disorders, 
substance abuse, and habitual addiction, all aimed at inmate reform reducing recidivism rates, 
including drug-related crimes. 
  
4.  Corruption  
 
The Government of Belize does not, as a matter of government policy, encourage or facilitate 
illicit drug production or distribution.  However, insufficient resources, weak law enforcement 
institutions, an ineffective judicial system, and inadequate compensation for civil service 
employees and public safety officials facilitate corruption.   
 
Belize lacks laws specifically addressing drug-related corruption.  The Prevention of Corruption 
Act, passed in 2000, includes measures to combat corruption related to illicit monetary gains and 
the misuse of public funds while holding public office.  It also provides a code of conduct for 
civil servants.  Belize did not charge anyone under this act in 2017 or 2018.  A Special Audit of 
the Immigration and Nationality Department found multiple cases of fraud and corruption within 
the department.  After this revelation and other reports of corruption among senior government 
officials (not related to illicit drugs) and significant public pressure, Belize signed and ratified 
the United Nations Convention against Corruption (UNCAC) in 2016.  In the course of 
implementing UNCAC, the government completed a self-assessment checklist; participated in a 
technical exchange visit in Jamaica; and initiated an impact of corruption assessment.  
 
C.  National Goals, Bilateral Cooperation, and U.S. Policy Initiatives  
 
U.S.-funded programs support citizen security, border security, and rule of law programs aimed 
to improve Belize’s security structures.  U.S. assistance, consistent with the U.S. Strategy for 
Central America, through the Central America Regional Security Initiative (CARSI), focuses on 
building transparency and accountability, capacity building, and other institutional-level 
improvements.   
 
Belize is a participating member of the CARICOM Implementation Agency for Crime and 
Security (IMPACS), which provides research and passenger data support through the Joint 
Regional Communications Center based in Barbados.  IMPACS is assisting Belize in

implementing the Advance Passenger Information System (APIS), a widely-used data 
interchange system that allows air and sea carriers to streamline and transmit traveler data.  APIS 
is recognized by commercial carriers and the international community as the standard for 
passenger processing and enhanced security in the commercial air and vessel environment.  Once 
implemented, commercial carriers will be able to share information with Belizean officials on 
individuals and cargo flagged by international law enforcement authorities for suspicious 
behavior or outstanding warrants, including related to drug crimes. 
 
Belize is also focused on improving its information and data sharing processes and is working 
with the United States and international partners.  The Joint Information Operations Center was 
designed to be the hub for collating and sharing information within Belize and with international 
partners.  Through the information sharing process, its goal is to combat transnational criminal 
threats and transnational criminal networking by addressing the reduction of violent crime, 
border crossings, weapon smuggling, human and drug trafficking, and dismantling of local 
criminal networks.  U.S. advisors are working with the Government of Belize to improve the 
policies and procedures that will provide a better process for responses to transnational threats 
and drug crimes. 
 
The United States and Belize have signed Letters of Agreement (LOAs) concerning both drug 
control and maritime security.  The LOAs, dated August 2010, include elements of establishing 
the police vetted unit and its area of responsibility, security sector reform, drug control, 
transnational crime, demand reduction, and community policing.   
 
The United States also maintains a bilateral agreement with Belize to suppress illicit traffic by 
sea and air, which includes provisions for ship boarding, ship riders, pursuit, entry to investigate, 
over flight of territorial seas, order to land, and for the use of third-party platforms.  Belize is a 
regular participant in the semi-annual Multilateral Maritime Counter Drug Summits, which bring 
together maritime counterdrug professionals from nearly 25 countries and over 65 international 
organizations spanning North, Central and South America, and Europe. 
 
D.  Conclusion  
  
Belize faces a challenging drug control environment and strong leadership is necessary to reduce 
the impact of drug trafficking and crime in the country.  The United States will continue to assist 
Belize’s law enforcement and justice sectors by providing training, advisory, and institutional 
support to combat drug trafficking.  The United States encourages Belize to strengthen its public 
security and law enforcement institutions through more effective anti-corruption legislation, 
modern drug control legislation, comprehensive background checks and vetting of new and 
existing personnel, enhanced training, and continuing education programs.

Benin 
 
Benin is a significant transshipment point for cocaine, heroin, methamphetamine, and chemical 
precursors used to produce illicit drugs.  Nigerian drug syndicates partner with Beninese 
nationals based in Benin.  Cocaine from South America and heroin from Southwest Asia via East 
Africa transit Benin for major markets in Western Europe.  Methamphetamine produced in 
Nigeria transits Benin for markets in Europe, Southeast Asia, and South Africa.  There was also 
some evidence of illicit drug trafficking to the United States in 2018, according to U.S. law 
enforcement authorities. 
 
Locally cultivated cannabis remains the most accessible illegal drug for consumption in Benin.  
There is a small but growing domestic market in Benin for heroin, cocaine and 
methamphetamine.  Benin receives registered commercial freight shipments from India of the 
prescription opioid tramadol, destined for the Sahel, with high levels of local consumption and 
abuse.  Tramadol pills exceeding the usually prescribed dosage by tenfold (500 milligrams vs 50 
milligrams) are commonly sold in Benin.  
 
Benin introduced new measures in 2018 aimed at improving efficiency and performance in law 
enforcement and judicial operations.  In January, Benin merged its National Police and 
Gendarmerie to create a single law enforcement unit, the Republican Police.  The merger 
eliminated overlapping responsibilities in practice between units involved in drug control.  In 
September, a specialized criminal court with exclusive jurisdiction for drug-related crimes began 
hearing cases.  The ability of police and courts to insulate themselves from corruption and 
partiality remains a longstanding challenge in Benin and the region. 
 
The Central Office for Repression of Illicit Trafficking of Drugs and Precursors (OCERTID) was 
created in 1999 under the national police to coordinate drug enforcement operations.  OCERTID 
reports monthly statistics on drug seizures; the national drug lab lacks equipment to test drugs or 
confirm purity.  Benin's Law on Control of Drugs and Precursors provides penalties of between 
one and 20 years in prison for trafficking drugs.  Individuals prosecuted for drug-related crimes 
in Benin are typically human couriers.  The Government of Benin must continue to make 
progress in improving coordination between its relevant agencies and build cooperation and trust 
with neighboring countries to successfully pursue complex case investigations.  
 
Benin does not have a bilateral extradition treaty or a mutual legal assistance treaty with the 
United States, though it is party to multilateral conventions that enable cooperation.

Bolivia 
 
A.  Introduction 
 
Although illicit drug consumption remains low in Bolivia, it remains the third largest source 
country of coca in the world, according to UN Office on Drugs and Crime (UNODC) estimates, 
and is also a major transit zone for Peruvian cocaine.  In March 2017, President Evo Morales 
signed into law a bill increasing the licit area of coca production from 12,000 hectares (ha) to 
22,000 ha.  However the United States government estimated 2017 cultivation amounts to be 
31,000 ha (a modest decrease in coca cultivation from 2016 to 2017), and UNODC estimated 
Bolivia coca cultivation to be 24,500 ha (an increase of 1,400 ha from 2016 to 2017), both in 
excess of the limits established by the Government of Bolivia.  European Union (EU) studies 
reveal that domestic demand for the traditional, cultural, and religious use in Bolivia is less than 
15,000 ha.   
 
The Bolivian government has inadequate controls over its domestic coca cultivation, and 
UNODC calculated an estimated 35-48 percent of the coca that was cultivated in 2017 did not go 
to the two authorized coca markets for sale.  The United States government estimated cocaine 
production potential in Bolivia to be 249 metric tons (MT) in 2017.  Most Bolivian cocaine is 
exported to other Latin American countries, especially Brazil and Argentina, for domestic 
consumption, or for onward transit to West Africa and Europe, rather than to the United States. 
 
In September 2018, the United States again determined that Bolivia “failed demonstrably” to 
adhere to its obligations under international drug control agreements and the U.S. Foreign 
Assistance Act of 1961, as amended.  This Presidential determination was based, in part, on 
insufficient justification for the increase in coca production authorized under Bolivian law.  
According to the 2017 UNODC report, 91 percent of the coca grown in the Yungas region, 
approximately 20,822 MT, is sold in the legal market.  Conversely, nearly 91 percent of the coca 
grown in Cochabamba’s Chapare region, approximately 21,738 MT, is diverted away from the 
legal market.  Bolivian President Evo Morales is “president in perpetuity” of the coca growers’ 
federation in the Chapare region.   
 
Peruvian officials estimate 41 percent of all Peruvian cocaine departs to or through Bolivia via 
ground or aerial transshipment, commonly known as the “air bridge.”  Bolivia reportedly 
confiscated seven aircraft involved in drug trafficking in 2018, down from 17 reportedly seized 
in 2017 by the Special Counter-Narcotics Police Force (FELCN).  In traditional (authorized) 
coca cultivation areas, Bolivia maintains a “social control” policy to curb illicit coca production.  
Under this approach, the government usually negotiates with coca growers to obtain their 
consent for eradication.  In nontraditional (unauthorized) areas, including national parks, 
eradication is officially mandatory. 
 
B.  Drug Control Accomplishments, Policies, and Trends 
 
 
 
1.  Institutional Development  
 


INCSR 2019 Volume 1  
 
 
 
 
Country Reports 
116 
 
In March 2017, President Morales promulgated two new laws to replace the Coca and Controlled 
Substances Law 1008 (1988).  In addition to increasing the licit area of coca production from 
12,000 ha to 22,000 ha, the General Law on Coca (Law 906) provides a framework for the 
regulation of the production, circulation, transportation, marketing, consumption, research, 
industrialization, and promotion of coca in its natural state.  The new Controlled Substances Law 
(Law 913) includes three key enhancements:  a procedure for the payment of informants and 
plea-bargaining in drug-related cases; a procedure for asset forfeiture; and a framework for 
wiretapping in drug-related investigations.  It also provides a legal basis for two studies – one on 
coca yield per hectare and another to determine coca leaf-to-cocaine yield.  Both studies are 
under way by UNODC with European EU funding and their results are expected in the second 
half of 2019.  As of November 2018, the Controlled Substances Law’s implementing regulations 
were still pending approval from the Bolivian legislature and not in effect. 
 
Bolivia has numerous entities with drug control mandates.  The National Drug Control Council 
(CONALTID), chaired by the Ministry of Government, is the central drug control policy-making 
body in Bolivia.  The Vice Ministry for Social Defense and Controlled Substances (VMSD) is 
mandated to combat drug trafficking, regulate coca production, advance coca eradication and 
drug prevention, and execute rehabilitation programs.  The General Law on Coca is enforced 
through a series of regulations that clarify responsibilities between governmental institutions and 
reinforce the role of the National Council for Revaluation, Production, Marketing, Research and 
Industrialization of Coca (CONCOCA) as the point for intergovernmental coordination.  
Biometric registration of all coca producers and sellers is also mandatory by law, and regulations 
exist to monitor coca transportation routes, markets, and industrial research on coca. 
 
FELCN reports to the VMSD and comprises approximately 1,700 personnel, and is the agency 
that focuses primarily on interdiction and money laundering cases.  The Joint Eradication Task 
Force (FTC) conducts manual coca eradication with approximately 2,300 personnel.  The Unit 
for the Execution of the Fight against Narcotics (UELICN) plans and funds drug enforcement 
operations.  In 2018, UELICN’s budget remained unchanged from 2017 at $48.3 million; 
however, a budget increase of about 25 percent is expected for 2019.  In 2018, Bolivia, with 
UNODC support, created the Regional Center for Counternarcotics Intelligence (CERIAN), a 
regional fusion center for intelligence analysis and information sharing based in Santa Cruz with 
the participation of Brazil, Argentina, and Paraguay.  Other border countries may join once a 
framework is finalized. 
 
Bolivia’s 2016-2020 Strategy to Combat Drug Trafficking and Reduction of Excess Cultivation 
of Coca Leaf prioritizes actions against criminal organizations rather than what the Bolivian 
government considers legitimate farmers who cultivate coca for traditional uses.  The strategy 
includes four pillars:  reduction of supply; reduction of demand; control of the excess supply of 
coca; and shared international responsibilities.  Current Bolivian coca cultivation far exceeds the 
country’s demand for coca for traditional purposes.  The Inter-American Drug Abuse Control 
Commission of the Organization of American States continues to recommend that Bolivia 
implement a system to monitor narcotics and psychotropic drugs used in healthcare settings to 
ensure the medicines are not diverted for illegitimate uses.

Bolivia receives most of its foreign counternarcotic financial support from the EU.  The EU is 
currently implementing a $50 million three-year (2016-2018) assistance program, and provides 
an additional $10 million to support UNODC drug control programs and technical assistance.  
The Bolivian government denies that foreign drug cartels operate within its borders, but 
acknowledges the presence of cartel emissaries. 
 
The United States and Bolivia are parties to a 1995 extradition treaty that permits the extradition 
of nationals for the most serious offenses, including drug trafficking.  Bolivia and the United 
States do not have a mutual legal assistance treaty, but both countries can request assistance 
through various multilateral conventions to which both are signatories. 
 
 
2.  Supply Reduction  
 
FELCN reported destroying 93 cocaine hydrochloride processing labs and 1,004 rustic cocaine 
labs during 2018, a 62 percent increase and 62 percent decrease, respectively, from 2017.  
According to the Bolivian government, FELCN seized 10.48 MT of cocaine base and 7.59 MT 
of cocaine hydrochloride in 2018 – a 7.4 percent decrease and 153 percent increase, respectively, 
from what was seized during the first 10 months of 2017.  FELCN arrested 3,986 individuals on 
drug-related offenses in 2018.  Corruption, interference by other branches of government, and 
insufficient judicial resources undermine due process and create delays in the administration of 
justice. 
 
The United States government estimated that coca cultivation was 31,000 ha in 2017, a 17 
percent decrease from 2016, and that the production potential of cocaine decreased 9 percent 
from last year to 249 MT.  The modest reduction in the U.S. cultivation estimate is attributable to 
better survey data and analysis.  UNODC estimated that 24,500 ha of coca were cultivated within 
Bolivia in 2017, a 6 percent increase from 2016.  UNODC officials have noted that 91 percent of 
the Chapare region’s coca cultivation is destined for illicit cocaine production and not traditional 
consumption.  According to UNODC’s 2017 report published in August, there were 8,400 ha of 
coca cultivated in the Chapare region, an increase of 17 percent over the previous year.  
According to the most recently available information from the Bolivian government, Bolivian 
authorities eradicated 8,600 ha of coca as of October, compared to 7,237 ha during all of 2017.  
The Bolivian government estimates it needs to eradicate 11,000 ha of coca yearly to see a net 
reduction in coca cultivation. 
 
 
3.  Public Information, Prevention, and Treatment 
 
Illicit drug consumption remains low in Bolivia, according to UNODC and the 2016 World Drug 
Report.  According to a joint 2016 CONALTID/UNODC study funded by the European Union 
on drug use in the university student population, 6.1 percent of Bolivian university students had 
used illicit drugs in the previous year.  Broken down by category, 5 percent of surveyed students 
had used marijuana; 0.8 percent used LSD; and 0.4 percent used cocaine.  In October 2017, 
CONALTID, the EU and UNODC launched a “Listen First” campaign aimed at preventing the 
abuse of drugs by children, focusing on parents, prevention staff, health workers, teachers, and 
decision makers. 
 


INCSR 2019 Volume 1

There are approximately 80 drug treatment and rehabilitation centers in Bolivia.  According to 
the Bolivian government’s 2016-2020 Strategy to Combat Drug Trafficking and Reduction of 
Excess Cultivation of Coca Leaf, 98 percent of those centers are run by nongovernmental 
organizations.  There are only two public treatment centers, one in Tarija and one in Santa Cruz.  
 
 
4.  Corruption 
 
As a matter of official policy, the Government of Bolivia does not encourage or facilitate illegal 
activity associated with drug trafficking.  However, President Morales and other senior 
government officials have acknowledged serious corruption problems in the judiciary and police.  
In 2017, the Ministry of Anticorruption and Transparency was dismantled and its responsibilities 
transferred to the Ministry of Justice, which was thereafter named the Ministry of Justice and 
Transparency.  
 
FELCN is the only police unit with a known polygraph program.  All FELCN members are 
required to take an annual polygraph test, and those who do not pass are supposed to transfer out 
of the program.  However, reports vary as to whether those two requisites are uniformly applied. 
 
C.  National Goals, Bilateral Cooperation, and U.S. Policy Initiatives 
 
The United States Embassy meets periodically with the Vice Ministry for Social Defense and 
Controlled Substances and FELCN officials to discuss Bolivia’s drug control efforts.  Bolivia 
sent participants to five courses at the U.S.-funded International Law Enforcement Academy in 
2018.  The participants represented two Bolivian institutions: FELCN and the Financial 
Investigative Unit.  The United States does not have a counterdrug presence in Bolivia, but it 
consults with international organizations and third-country governments involved in supporting 
Bolivian drug control goals and efforts to strengthen the rule of law.  
 
Bolivia participated in the semi-annual Multilateral Maritime Counter Drug Summit held in 
May, which attracted 125 maritime counterdrug professionals from nearly 25 countries and over 
65 international agencies spanning North, Central and South America, and Europe.  In 
conjunction with the Multilateral Maritime Counter Drug Summit, the Vice Minister of Social 
Defense visited the State Department and requested continued cooperation and exchange of 
information of eradication imagery and data. 
 
D.  Conclusion  
 
Bolivia remains the third largest source of coca and cocaine in the world, and a major transit 
country for Peruvian cocaine.  For the second time since 2010, UNODC estimates coca 
cultivation is increasing and, even with a decrease in U.S. coca cultivation estimates, both 
UNODC and U.S. 2017 estimates are well above the government-sanctioned limit of 22,000 ha.  
Despite a decrease in U.S. estimates in 2017, potential pure cocaine production in Bolivia 
remains historically high at 249 MT when compared to 170 MT less than a decade ago.  There is 
no available data to support the Bolivian government’s statements that traditional, cultural, and 
medicinal coca consumption have increased, which it made in justifying the increase in the legal 
limit of coca cultivation in the new General Law on Coca from 12,000 ha to 22,000 ha.  This 


INCSR 2019 Volume 1  
 
 
 
 
Country Reports 
119 
 
limit exceeds the amount of coca needed for traditional purposes by approximately 38 percent, 
per EU reporting. 
 
Bolivia’s inadequate controls over its legal coca markets remain a matter of concern, as is 
Bolivia’s status as a transit country for cocaine trafficking.  In 2013, Bolivia re-acceded to the 
1961 U.N. Single Convention on Narcotic Drugs with a reservation permitting coca to be used 
only within Bolivia for traditional, cultural, and medicinal purposes.  Despite these stated 
conditions, Bolivia continues to promote the use of coca in other countries and discuss potential 
export opportunities for coca products.  These actions undermine Bolivia’s commitments to its 
international drug control obligations. 
 
In addition, Bolivia should strengthen efforts to stem the diversion of coca to cocaine processing 
by tightening controls over the coca leaf trade, achieving net reductions in coca cultivation, and 
improving law enforcement and judicial efforts to investigate and prosecute drug-related 
criminal activity.  Provisions of the new Controlled Substances Law are still not in effect nor will 
they be until the Bolivian legislature approves the implementing regulations.  The law 
nonetheless could be a significant advance in the fight against drug trafficking, as it will 
institutionalize the use of modern investigative techniques previously absent from the Bolivian 
legal framework.

Bosnia and Herzegovina 
 
Bosnia and Herzegovina is not a major producer or consumer of illicit drugs or precursor 
chemicals.  It is primarily a transit country, positioned between drug processing centers in 
Southwest Asia and markets in Western Europe.  The Adriatic coast is also a major gateway for 
South American cocaine destined for Europe.  
 
Transnational criminal organizations dominate the drug trade in the Balkans and largely traffic 
cannabis, heroin, and cocaine.  Bosnian criminal organizations often operate outside of the 
Balkans, though leaders of these organizations reside within the country.  Law enforcement and 
security institutions in Bosnia and Herzegovina remain limited and do not effectively deter 
trafficking.  The fragmented structure of law enforcement agencies and inter-agency rivalries 
impede effective cooperation in detecting drug crimes and pursuing joint investigations.  There is 
little coordination between units that could connect drug activity to larger organized crime and 
money laundering operations.  Little political will exists to create policies and programs to 
reduce demand for illicit drugs.  Corruption is an endemic problem, which can also hamper 
effective investigations and prosecutions. 
 
Drug demand is increasing within Bosnia and Herzegovina, but remains relatively low compared 
with other European countries.  During the first 10 months of 2018, police seized 3.35 kilograms 
(kg) of heroin; 2.7 kg of cocaine; 1.84 metric tons of marijuana/cannabis products; 2,500 tablets 
of cannabis sativa and 8,998 cannabis plants; 23.9 kg and 10.6 liters of amphetamine-type 
stimulants; 1,605 tablets and 17.7 kg of MDMA (ecstasy); and 67,968 tablets of diverted 
pharmaceutical products.  Many of these seizures resulted from joint investigations with 
neighboring countries.  
 
Nationally, the State Investigation and Protection Agency (SIPA) and the Border Police are 
responsible for drug control enforcement.  The Customs Administration, within the Indirect 
Taxation Authority, conducts routine drug seizures at border crossings but does not possess 
investigative or arrest authorities.  Seized drugs are transferred to either the Border Police or 
SIPA for criminal investigation and prosecution.  At the entity-level, the Federation Ministry of 
Interior, Republika Srpska Ministry of Interior, Brcko District Police, and the 10 cantonal 
Ministries of Interior are engaged on drug issues.  During the first 10 months of 2018, Bosnian 
police filed 2,014 reports related to drug crimes. 
 
Bosnia and Herzegovina law enforcement agencies’ ability to conduct complex investigations is 
limited.  Bosnia and Herzegovina continues to work closely with the United States to develop its 
interdiction, investigative, and prosecutorial capacity, and also cooperates with the European 
Monitoring Centre for Drugs and Drug Addiction, the UN Office on Drugs and Crime, and other 
bilateral partners.

Brazil 
 
A.  Introduction 
 
Brazil is a significant transit and destination country for cocaine.  The country’s borders with the 
cocaine source countries of Colombia, Peru, and Bolivia are porous and over three times the 
length of the U.S. border with Mexico.  The government views the large, violent, and well-
organized drug trafficking organizations operating throughout the country as its primary 
domestic security threat.  Brazil suffers from a substantial and growing domestic drug 
consumption problem.  After the United States, Brazil is the world’s second-largest consumer of 
cocaine hydrochloride and likely the largest consumer of cocaine-base products.  The Brazilian 
government appreciates the gravity of the illicit drugs issue and is committed to combating drug 
trafficking, but lacks the capacity to fully stem the flow of illicit drugs across its borders. 
 
In 2018, Brazil entered into another year of economic recession and fiscal short-fall, combined 
with inflation, resulting in austerity cuts across the government, including at enforcement and 
social welfare agencies that address drug flows and substance use disorders.  The government 
continues to prioritize border security and pursues a whole-of-government approach to counter 
drug trafficking and other forms of organized and violent crime, working in cooperation with 
international partners.   
 
B.  Drug Control Accomplishments, Policies, and Trends 
 
1. Institutional Development   
 
The Brazilian government’s lead agency for combating drug trafficking is the Federal Police 
(DPF).  The lead agency for policy on reducing drug demand is the National Secretariat for Drug 
Policy (SENAD).  SENAD is part of the Ministry of Justice, the Brazilian government’s lead 
agency for drug control policy. 
 
The DPF’s 2018 budget increased by 18 percent, a significant increase over 2017 levels.  
However, DPF operations continued to be impacted by across-the-board fiscal austerity and deep 
cuts to some operational budgets.  The DPF is capable by global standards, but recognizes that its 
force of 11,000 agents is insufficient to effectively combat drug trafficking in addition to other 
duties.  SENAD’s National Anti-Drug Fund budget was cut by 11 percent from 2017 levels. 
 
Reform of drug sentencing laws is a source of public debate, as nearly a quarter of the Brazilian 
prison population is incarcerated for drug-related crimes (150,000 people), more than any other 
single crime.  The National Justice Council, which oversees Brazil’s federal judiciary, is creating 
standardized sentencing guidelines to better distinguish between drug consumers and traffickers. 
 
Brazil maintains bilateral drug control agreements with the United States and every country in 
South America, in addition to formal partnerships with the UN Office on Drugs and Crime 
(UNODC), the Organization of American States’ Inter-American Drug Abuse Control 
Commission, and INTERPOL.  In May, the United States and Brazil launched a Permanent 
Security Forum to facilitate bilateral cooperation and plan coordinated strategies in six areas, 


INCSR 2019 Volume 1

including drug trafficking.  Brazil has extradition and mutual legal assistance treaties with the 
United States.   
 
 
2.  Supply Reduction   
 
Brazil remains a major transit route for cocaine from the source countries of Bolivia, Colombia, 
and Peru.  Cocaine products are smuggled across land borders via small aircraft and trucks, as 
well as by boats using the Amazon riverine system.  Brazil's seaports play a key role in drug 
smuggling, and Brazilian law enforcement and customs continue to improve port screening and 
interdiction.  The majority of cocaine entering Brazil is destined for its domestic market and 
Europe, often through West Africa.  In August, Brazilian police in conjunction with United 
States law enforcement seized 2.2 metric tons (MT) of cocaine from a drug trafficking 
organization in Belém, Para destined for Antwerp, Belgium.  In September, Brazilian police 
cooperated with United States law enforcement to seize 840 kilograms of cocaine HCL base in 
Manaus, Amazonas destined for transport to the port of Belém at the mouth of the Amazon 
River.   
 
Since 2011, Brazil’s Strategic Border Plan has confronted drug trafficking and transnational 
crime, including support of periodic operations.  Operation Sentinela, supervised by the Ministry 
of Justice, is an ongoing intelligence-building effort to coordinate state, local, and federal police 
forces, particularly on the border.  Operation Ágata, coordinated by the Ministry of Defense, 
conducts periodic tactical missions at strategic border points.  These operations took place 
periodically in 2018 with some success, but consolidated seizure statistics were not available at 
the time of this report.  In April, Brazil approved the Strategic Plan of the Integrated Border 
Program, established in November 2016 to improve cooperation among agencies and with 
international partners. 
 
The first nine months of 2018 saw an increase of counter drug operations and seizures of cocaine 
and other illicit drugs, though aggregate volumes have not yet been made available.  A lack of a 
central uniformed reporting system makes consolidated statistical data difficult to attain.   
 
Brazil conducts recurring cannabis eradication operations in the country’s northeast.  In a single 
operation in June, the DPF eradicated approximately 2.5 hectares of cannabis plantings, with an 
estimated yield of 88 MT.  Comprehensive statistics for cannabis eradication in 2018 have not 
yet been released. 
 
Synthetic drugs are present in Brazil, though combating them is a lower government priority 
given the overwhelming cocaine problem.  Complex synthetic drugs such as MDMA and LSD 
are usually smuggled in small amounts via couriers flying commercial airlines from Europe.  A 
study published in June based on data from the Brazilian National Health Surveillance Agency 
(ANVISA) showed an increase of opioid sales by 465 percent in Brazil between 2009 and 2015,

Brazilian federal and state authorities continued to actively promote drug threat awareness, 
demand reduction, and treatment programs in 2018.  The government continues to implement its 
2005 National Drug Policy via its regular budget process, with emphasis on distance-learning 
training for substance use disorder professionals and civil society organizations and building 
social service capacity at the municipal level.  In 2018, SENAD approved a new resolution that 
provides for studies to realign the National Drug Policy.  
 
Brazil approaches the reintegration of people with substance use disorders into society 
holistically, providing a range of services from medical care to job training. Brazil’s programs 
are not yet commensurate with the size of the addicted population. 
 
 
4.  Corruption  
 
As a matter of government policy, the Brazilian government does not encourage or facilitate 
illegal activity associated with drug trafficking, and there is little evidence to suggest that senior 
government officials are engaged in such activity.  While there were numerous allegations and 
examples of political corruption throughout Brazil, including at the highest levels of government, 
there were no direct links between political corruption and drug trafficking at the national level.  
Delays in judicial proceedings often resulted in cases being dismissed. 
  
C.  National Goals, Bilateral Cooperation, and U.S. Policy Initiatives 
 
The 2008 U.S.-Brazil Memorandum of Understanding on Narcotics Control and Law 
Enforcement supports capacity building in Brazilian federal and state agencies to combat illicit 
drug trafficking.  In 2018, the United States provided significant training support to Brazilian law 
enforcement through 29 courses reaching nearly 1,000 officers on topics ranging from money 
laundering to community policing.  Cooperation between Brazilian and U.S. law enforcement is 
excellent.  The United States also regularly engages with Brazilian security forces and the Brazil 
Navy to strengthen cooperation against drug trafficking through subject matter expert exchanges, 
forums, and other engagements.  The U.S.-Brazil Permanent Security Forum on Security 
launched in May 2018 as a formal mechanism to coordinate six thematic areas of cooperation, 
including drug trafficking.  The drug trafficking working group convened in September.   
 
D.  Conclusion 
 
Brazil has institutionalized its commitment to combating illicit drug trafficking and addressing a 
growing domestic consumption problem.  Brazil would benefit from comprehensive population 
surveys to determine the scope of its domestic drug consumption, consolidated nationwide data 
on drug interdiction, increased monitoring of its seaports, and greater cooperation with 
neighboring countries.

Burma 
 
A.  Introduction 
 
Burma continues to be a major source of illicit opiates and amphetamine-type stimulants (ATS).  
According to the UN Office on Drugs and Crime (UNODC), Burma is the world’s second largest 
source country of opium poppy cultivation, and one of the largest producers of heroin.  Burma is 
also one of the world’s largest producers of methamphetamine, primarily in the forms of 
crystallized methamphetamine and “yaba” tablets (caffeine with small doses of 
methamphetamine).  In 2018, countries across Southeast Asia and beyond experienced record-
breaking seizures of crystal methamphetamine and yaba tablets that originated in Burma.  
Production sites for heroin and ATS are generally situated in Shan State along Burma’s eastern 
borders in areas controlled by ethnic armed groups and militias.  There are also mobile ATS 
laboratories along the Burma-Bangladesh border, which have created another hub for ATS 
trafficking.  Precursor chemicals are brought to these production sites from outside the country, 
primarily from China. 
  
Illicit drugs produced in Burma are trafficked throughout the region, with routes extending 
beyond the Mekong countries to Australia and New Zealand.  Burma is not a major source of or 
transit country for drugs entering the United States.  Domestic consumption of illicit drugs is 
substantial and widespread, though it varies by region.  However, there are no reliable 
comprehensive studies providing statistics on the scope of the problem.  
  
B.  Drug Control Accomplishments, Policies, and Trends  
 
 
1.  Institutional Development 
 
The Central Committee for Drug Abuse Control (CCDAC) is Burma’s interagency mechanism 
for coordinating drug control efforts, which involve multiple ministries and justice institutions.  
In February 2018, the CCDAC passed and enacted a National Drug Control Policy in accordance 
with recommendations from the 2016 UN General Assembly Special Session on the World Drug 
Problem (UNGASS).  The 1993 Narcotic Drugs and Psychotropic Substances Law was amended 
in February 2018 to be consistent with the new policy. 
 
Burma’s Drug Enforcement Division (DED) is the country’s primary interdiction force, but it 
lacks resources commensurate with the size of the problem.  Burma’s justice system is 
underdeveloped, and judicial and prosecutorial institutions lack the legal framework to 
effectively handle the volume of drug-related crimes and complex drug networks.  The DED is 
theoretically allotted nearly 4,000 employees; however, as of August 2018, there were only 
1,164 employees on staff.  The country’s criminal legislation does not permit law enforcement 
actions that are essential for sophisticated narcotics investigations, such as controlled deliveries.  
Accordingly, there have been few investigations and prosecutions of mid- or high-ranking drug 
trafficking suspects. 
 
In June 2018, President Win Myint ordered the establishment of a Drug Abuse Reporting 
Department within his office to identify drug offenders.  While the initiative shows a growing 


INCSR 2019 Volume 1  
 
 
 
 
Country Reports 
125 
 
recognition of drug use and trafficking in the country, it has thus far not provided law 
enforcement with the tools or resources necessary to interdict significant drug networks.  
  
The Ministry of Social Welfare, Relief, and Resettlement (MSW) and the Ministry of Health and 
Sports (MOHS) share responsibilities for addressing drug treatment, and rehabilitation.  The 
MSW established a new Department of Rehabilitation in January 2018 to oversee rehabilitation 
facilities and services.  The Government of Burma recognizes that the social sector remains 
significantly underfunded, and that the country still lacks a corps of health and social welfare 
officials qualified to provide services to those using or addicted to drugs.   
 
The amended Narcotic Drugs and Psychotropic Substances Law places more focus on treating 
drug use as a public health matter rather than exclusively as a criminal justice matter.  However, 
law enforcement authorities continue primarily to arrest and prosecute low-level users and 
traffickers due to inadequate resources and poor understanding of the new law, as well as limited 
access to health services for drug users.  The majority of tips sent to the Drug Abuse Reporting 
Department concern low-level drug dealers, and the burden for handling these cases falls on law 
enforcement, justice, and correctional institutions.  According to CCDAC reports, 48 percent of 
prisoners nationwide were arrested for drug-related offences; in Kachin and Shan States, this 
figure is closer to 70 or 80 percent.  The Union Attorney General’s Office (UAGO) has 
estimated that as many as 50 percent of all cases prosecuted nationwide relate to drug offenses.    
 
The UAGO oversees all prosecutions in the country, and consults on legislation in the criminal 
justice field.  Prosecutors below the Union level work in 14 state and regional, 71 district, and 
330 township level law offices.  In addition to the lack of resources and rudimentary 
investigative techniques, they face challenges including: inconsistent testimony from civilian 
witnesses; the requirement to have a township elder present during a search warrant; and a lack 
of by-laws for implementation of the Narcotics Law.  The UAGO recognizes the benefits of 
police-prosecutor cooperation on investigations and prosecutions.  However, there has been no 
specialized drug prosecution training to date, and prosecutors receive drug cases after the police 
have already completed their investigations, without prior consultations, which makes 
prosecutions more difficult.   
 
Burma’s law enforcement and justice institutions have the ability, in principle, to cooperate 
internationally.  However, due to lack of experience and exposure to international institutions, 
local law enforcement and judicial officials have limited understanding of regulations relating to 
extraditions and mutual legal assistance.  On a working level, DED officers and commanders 
maintain relationships with counterparts in neighboring countries, most notably Thailand and 
China.  Burma signed new agreements related to drug control in 2018; in addition, Burma is 
undergoing the process to sign memoranda of understanding with Indonesia and the Philippines 
on law enforcement cooperation.   
 
 
2.  Supply Reduction 
 
According to the 2017 UNODC Burma Opium Survey, an estimated 41,000 hectares of opium 
poppy were cultivated in Shan and Kachin States, representing a 25 percent decrease from to the 
results of the 2015 survey.  Shan State remains the largest source of opium cultivation.  The 


INCSR 2019 Volume 1  
 
 
 
 
Country Reports 
126 
 
Burmese government and UNODC are conducting a survey for the 2018 opium poppy season, 
the results of which are expected to be released in early 2019.  DED officials anticipate that 
opium and heroin production will continue to decline due to low opium prices and reduced 
regional demand for opium and heroin. 
 
During the first nine months of 2018, Burmese authorities seized approximately 84,148,000 ATS 
tablets; 2.57 metric tons (MT) of opium; 750.6 kilograms (kg) of heroin; 2.68 MT of crystal 
methamphetamine; 72.2 kg of concentrated opium; 29.7 kg of low-grade opium; 1.97 liters of 
opium oil liquid; 353.5 kg of brown opium powder; and 11.65 liters of liquid opium.  At three 
drug destruction ceremonies on June 26 marking the annual International Day Against Drug 
Abuse, law enforcement officers destroyed $187 million worth of seized narcotic drugs, a 
reduction of more than 50 percent compared to the $386 million worth of seized illicit drugs 
destroyed in 2017.   
 
During the first nine months of 2018, there were 14,008 drug-related arrests, compared to 13,734 
arrests during the entire year in 2017.  As of September 30, there had been 9,784 drug-related 
prosecutions, compared to 9,366 in all of 2017.  In January, law enforcement officials seized 30 
million methamphetamine pills and more than two metric tons of crystal methamphetamine and 
heroin in Shan State.  This single seizure, worth $54 million on the illicit market, was the largest 
of the year. 
 
Drug traffickers are consolidating larger volumes of drugs for transport, compared to small retail 
trafficking in the past.  In June 2018, 12 drug traffickers received prison sentences up to 48 years 
in connection with a 2015 case involving the largest single seizure ever of ATS in Southeast Asia 
(and second largest in the world), worth $26.7 million.   
 
 
3.  Public Information, Prevention, and Treatment 
 
The Ministry of Home Affairs did not grant the CCDAC permission to develop Burma’s first 
National Drug Use Survey in 2018, despite an agreement with UNODC and the United States to 
support and fund the project.  Anecdotally, domestic consumption of illicit drugs is extremely 
high, especially associated with migrant workers in extractive industries, such as jade and gold 
mines.  The country’s existing public health capacity falls far short of accommodating those who 
seek or need treatment.   
 
The government, with technical support from UNODC, adopted the first National Drug Control 
Policy in February 2018.  The policy references international best practices and aligns with the 
approach of the 2016 UNGASS and complies with the three international drug conventions.   
   
The MOHS and the MSW rely on the international community to provide much of the training 
on drug treatment and prevention that health and education professionals receive.  The United 
States continues to fund the Colombo Plan, which trains health professionals on the U.S.-
developed Universal Treatment Curriculum for Substance Use Disorders and teachers from the 
Ministry of Education on the Universal Prevention Curriculum.  Basic education teachers 
received drug prevention curriculum assistance for the first time in 2018, and expressed 
eagerness to benefit from additional capacity-building programs.  The United States also 


INCSR 2019 Volume 1  
 
 
 
 
Country Reports 
127 
 
provides support through local organizations to deliver effective training in life skills and 
behavior change interventions as well as link drug users to various services, including 
detoxification, methadone maintenance, HIV testing and AIDS treatments.  The United States 
also supports drug use prevention through community engagement activities, including a 
successful Facebook social media campaign. 
 
The MOHS National Methadone Maintenance Therapy Program opened four new sites in 2018 
and now has a total of 55 sites nationwide.  Currently, there are 26 major and 47 minor drug 
treatment centers, and the Government of Burma plans to open an additional three major and 
nine minor centers.  Significant challenges remain to reaching rural and remote communities.  
The U.S. government has donated health and recreational materials to the CCDAC rehabilitation 
center, and worked with local authorities in 2018 to launch Kachin State’s Drug Use Prevention 
Strategic Plan.  A similar plan is in development for northern Shan State. 
 
 
4.  Corruption 
 
The Government of Burma does not, as a matter of policy, encourage or facilitate the illicit 
production or distribution of drugs, or the laundering of proceeds from illegal drug transactions.  
However, corruption is widespread in Burma, and illicit proceeds from the drug trade fuel 
corruption.   
 
The Anti-Corruption Commission has made important strides in building capacity to identify and 
investigate corruption, and has initiated important cases.  However, it still lacks the resources to 
lead a systematic fight against corruption.  Government officials participate regularly in 
conferences and trainings on corruption and related topics sponsored by international partners.   
 
C.  National Goals, Bilateral Cooperation, and U.S. Policy Initiatives 
 
CCDAC, in collaboration with UNODC, developed Burma’s first modern National Drug Control 
Policy in 2018, which presents a comprehensive approach to tackling the drug situation, 
involving government, non-government, and civil society stakeholders.  In addition to law 
enforcement and criminal justice efforts, it includes health and social policy responses, outlining 
a path to promoting sustainable alternative development for opium poppy farmers, and 
promoting international cooperation.  Major changes in this policy include increasing compliance 
with international standards of human rights.   
 
In August 2017, Burma signed an amended Letter of Agreement with the United States that 
facilitates broadened engagement in law enforcement, drug control, and rule of law issues.   
 
The U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) continues to work closely with the DED on 
operations and the collaboration has expanded to regional level cooperation in forms of 
intelligence sharing and conducting joint investigations.  However, the government’s ongoing 
objections to Leahy vetting for in-country police training has hindered U.S. efforts to conduct in-
country capacity building trainings.  DEA provided joint interdiction training for Burmese and 
Thai law enforcement officials in late 2018, and introduced specialized technical equipment to 
assist Burmese officials in interdicting and analyzing drug shipments.  During the year, 38 law

enforcement officials attended 16 courses at the International Law Enforcement Academy in 
Bangkok.  Burmese law enforcement officials also participated in additional international 
training opportunities, including courses pertaining to illicit drugs; cyber-enabled crime; and 
crimes against children.   
 
D.  Conclusion 
 
The scale of Burma’s drug problem – the consumption and trafficking of illicit opiates and ATS 
– is enormous.  Domestic consumption is widespread and degrades many communities.  Burma 
is a major source of illicit drugs throughout Southeast Asia, and illicit proceeds from the trade 
threaten political stability in many places.  Burma requires legal and organizational reforms to 
facilitate effective criminal investigations and transparent criminal prosecutions, and the country 
needs to dedicate resources to building law enforcement capacity to investigate and effectively 
prosecute drug traffickers and interdict drugs and precursor chemicals in order to see 
improvements in the future.  The United States remains a close partner with the Government of 
Burma on all elements of the country’s drug control policy and will continue to work with 
regional and international partners to help the country address its challenges.

Cabo Verde 
 
Cabo Verde remains an important transit hub for cocaine, cannabis, and small amounts of other 
drugs trafficked from Latin America to Europe.  The archipelago’s extensive maritime territory, 
minimal interdiction resources, and remote parts of its 10 islands make Cabo Verde vulnerable to 
trafficking via aerial and maritime conveyance.  Tourist and business traffic continues to expand 
through the major international airports on the islands of Santiago and Sal and the secondary 
airports on the islands of Boa Vista and Sao Vicente, expanding opportunities for drug 
trafficking via human couriers.  Expanding cargo and cruise ship traffic through the country’s 
major ports on Santiago, Sao Vicente, and Sal also increase opportunities for drug trafficking.  
The UN Office on Drugs and Crime reports that cannabis, cocaine, hashish, heroin, and 
methamphetamine are the most commonly used illicit drugs in Cabo Verde.  There are reports 
that synthetic drugs including MDMA (ecstasy) are available on the tourist destination islands of 
Sal and Boa Vista.  
 
Corruption is relatively low in Cabo Verde.  Support from the United States and other 
international donors is helping to improve the capacity of Cabo Verdean law enforcement 
agencies to identify and interdict illicit drug shipments.  U.S. support has also increased Cabo 
Verde’s ability to combat money laundering and other financial crimes often associated with 
drug trafficking.  There are few drug demand reduction programs active in the country, and 
recidivism for drug crimes is a major problem.  
 
In August 2017, police seized a reported 1,157 kilogram shipment of cocaine from a private 
yacht in Mindelo, headed from Brazil to Europe.  The crew, three Brazilians and a French 
national, were found guilty and are serving a 10-year sentence.  
 
The United States and other partners support Cabo Verde in combating drug trafficking and 
associated crime, providing robust and varied training to law enforcement and armed forces in 
Cabo Verde.  The Center for Maritime Security Operations (COSMAR) in Praia and the Joint 
Operations Center in Mindelo provide oversight of Cabo Verde’s maritime territory.  U.S. Africa 
Command partners with Cabo Verdean authorities on periodic patrols in the region to interdict 
suspected drug shipments and other illicit activities, as well as providing training and building 
capacity within Cabo Verdean security sector institutions.

Canada 
 
A.  Introduction 
  
The Government of Canada continued to combat the production, distribution, and consumption 
of illicit drugs in 2018.  Canada and the United States cooperate extensively in drug control 
efforts, including by sharing information and coordinating operations.  Canada is a source of 
MDMA (ecstasy), cannabis, and fentanyl to the United States.  Canada aggressively targets the 
trafficking of synthetic and conventional drugs, particularly fentanyl and fentanyl precursors. 
  
B.  Drug Control Accomplishments, Policies, and Trends 
  
 
1.  Institutional Development 
  
Canada’s national drug control policy is codified by the Canadian Drugs and Substances Strategy 
(CDSS), which was announced in 2016 and includes four pillars – prevention, treatment, harm 
reduction and enforcement.  The Strategy has a five-year budget (2017-2022) of $660 million.  
Provinces and territories have separate dedicated budgets to address problematic substance use.  
  
In May 2017, Canada’s Parliament passed Bill C-37, amending the Controlled Drugs and 
Substances Act.  The bill authorized temporary scheduling to control dangerous emerging drugs 
and streamlined the process for establishing supervised consumption sites.  It also prohibits 
unregistered importation of devices that could be used to manufacture controlled substances, 
such as pill presses and encapsulators, and authorizes Canadian border officers to open mail 
weighing 30 grams or less that may contain controlled substances.  
  
Effective October 17, 2018, the production, sale, and use of recreational cannabis (Cannabis Act) 
became legal throughout Canada.  However, under this legislation, unauthorized cross-border 
movement of cannabis remains subject to criminal prosecution. 
  
Canada continued to experience a growing number of opioids-related overdose deaths, with over 
8,000 deaths since 2016, including 3,996 in 2017; there were more than 1,000 apparent opioid-
related deaths during the first quarter of 2018. 
  
Canada is party to the Inter-American Convention on Mutual Legal Assistance in Criminal 
Matters, and the Inter-American Convention against Corruption.  The Royal Canadian Mounted 
Police (RCMP) is a member of the International Narcotics Control Board's (INCB) Task Forces, 
including Project ION (International Operation on New Psychoactive Substances). 
  
 
2.  Supply Reduction 
  
Canada is a primary source of cannabis and MDMA to the United States, and a source of 
synthetic drugs and amphetamine-type stimulants to Asia and Australia.  Synthetic opioids have 
also reached the United States from Canada.  Cannabis cultivation and synthetic drug 
manufacture are concentrated in British Columbia, Quebec, and Ontario.  Methamphetamine also 
continues to be produced in Canada.  South America remains Canada’s primary source for 


INCSR 2019 Volume 1  
 
 
 
 
Country Reports 
131 
 
cocaine, some of which transits the United States.  Afghanistan remains Canada’s primary source 
of heroin.    
  
Canadian officials report that the volume of fentanyl trafficked from China decreased in 2018, 
and the majority of fentanyl seizures were trafficked in powder form through the postal stream 
with minimal concealment.  During the first six months of 2018, Canada seized 20 fentanyl 
shipments totaling 1.28 kilograms (kg) in powder form.  In 2017, there were 113 seizures for a 
total of 11.95 kg seized in powder form. 
  
 
3.  Public Information, Prevention, and Treatment 
  
The Substance Use and Addictions Program is a federal program under the CDSS.  It provides 
$28.3 million annually to Canada’s provinces, territories, non-governmental organizations and 
other stakeholders, particularly for activities and research to combat the opioid crisis. 
  
The Canadian government produces and implements various public education materials and 
campaigns to inform Canadians about the health and safety risks of using dangerous drugs and 
substances, including opioids, and cannabis.  One of the government’s priorities is to reduce the 
negative stigma associated with seeking mental health services and treatment for substance use 
disorders.  Health Canada plans to invest more than $350 million annually in community 
programming to help address the mental wellness needs of First Nations and Inuit populations. 
  
Canada’s comprehensive approach to substance use involved various harm reduction initiatives, 
including: needle exchange programs; supervised consumption sites; overdose prevention sites; 
and legislation to protect individuals seeking emergency assistance for overdoses.  Canada also 
supports medication-assisted therapies for the treatment of opioid dependence, and naloxone is 
widely available without a prescription, including in all First Nations primary health care centers.  
  
According to the INCB, Canada is the second largest per capita consumer of prescription opioids 
in the world.  In 2015, 13 percent of Canadians aged 15 years and older reported using an opioid 
pain reliever in the past year.  Among them, 2 percent reported abusing opioids, a decrease from 
2012 (5 percent).    
  
The Government collects substance use prevalence data through the Canadian Tobacco Alcohol 
and Drugs Survey and the Canadian Student Tobacco, Alcohol and Drugs Survey.  The most 
recent data showed the prevalence of cannabis use among Canadians aged 15 years and older 
was 16 percent in 2018, up from 2013 (11 percent).  In 2016-17, 17 percent of students in grades 
7 to 12 (approximately 340,000) reported using cannabis in the year preceding the survey, 
unchanged from 2014-15.  Use of other illicit drugs such as MDMA (0.4 percent), hallucinogens 
(0.6 percent), cocaine (0.9 percent) and methamphetamine (0.2 percent) remained largely 
unchanged since 2004.   
  
 
4.  Corruption 
  
Canada has strong anti-corruption laws and policies and holds its officials to a high standard of 
conduct.  The Canadian government pursues malfeasant civil servants and subjects them to 


INCSR 2019 Volume 1  
 
 
 
 
Country Reports 
132 
 
prosecution.  No government officials are known to engage in, encourage, or facilitate illegal 
activity associated with drug trafficking.  Corruption among law enforcement officials is rare. 
  
C.  National Goals, Bilateral Cooperation, and U.S. Policy Initiatives 
  
The United States and Canada exchange forfeited assets through a bilateral asset-sharing 
agreement and share information on customs offenses through a customs mutual assistance 
agreement.  Judicial assistance and extradition matters operate under a mutual legal assistance 
treaty, an extradition treaty, and related domestic legislation and law-enforcement protocols, 
including a memorandum of understanding (MOU) between the U.S. Drug Enforcement 
Administration and RCMP.  
  
U.S. federal, state, local, and tribal entities collaborate with RCMP, Canada Border Services 
Agency (CBSA), provincial and local police, and other Canadian law enforcement authorities to 
combat drug trafficking.  Cooperation is coordinated through the Cross Border Law Enforcement 
Advisory Committee, Joint Management Teams, and other bilateral groups.  Integrated teams of 
Canadian and U.S. law enforcement authorities operate along the Northern Border across a 
variety of structures, including Border Enforcement Security Taskforces (BEST), Integrated 
Border Enforcement Teams (IBET), and the Integrated Cross-Border Maritime Law 
Enforcement Operations (aka "Shiprider").  
  
Canada participates with the United States and Mexico in the North American Dialogue on Drug 
Policy (NADD).  On November 9, 2018, Canada hosted the third annual high-level NADD in 
Ottawa.  Canada also takes part in the North American Maritime Security Initiative, a joint 
operations and information sharing effort to target suspect vessels.  Through a longstanding 
MOU, U.S. Coast Guard detachments are deployed on Canadian Navy ships in the Caribbean 
Sea and Eastern Pacific Ocean, which resulted in the seizure of over 3.64 metric tons of cocaine 
during the first six months of 2018. 
  
D.  Conclusion 
  
The United States cooperates extensively with Canada on law enforcement matters and 
acknowledges the strong and consistent anti-drug efforts of Canada’s federal government.  The 
United States will continue to work with Canada to stem the flow of illegal drugs across our 
shared border and enhance regulatory frameworks to prevent access to precursor chemicals and 
lab equipment for criminal use.

China 
 
A.  Introduction 
 
China's geographical location, vast land area, massive population, and expanding economy have 
all contributed to the country becoming a hub for drug and precursor chemical production and 
trafficking.  China also faces significant illicit drug consumption challenges, including synthetic 
drugs.  China shares borders with drug source countries in both Southeast and Southwest Asia 
and remains a major destination and transit country for heroin produced in these areas.  Its 
numerous coastal cities with high-volume seaports and its vast network of major international 
airports make China an ideal destination and transit country for illicit drugs.  China is a major 
source of synthetic drugs, new psychoactive substances (NPS), and precursor chemicals used to 
produce illicit drugs.  Domestic Chinese criminal organizations traffic illicit drugs within China 
as well as to international markets, and Chinese authorities have noted the presence of 
international drug trafficking organizations originating from Mexico and Southeast Asia 
operating within the country.  
 
China is a major source of NPS and other synthetic drugs, including fentanyl and 
methamphetamine, and domestic use of synthetic drugs (primarily methamphetamine and 
ketamine) is becoming increasingly prevalent.  China's large chemical and pharmaceutical 
industries provide an ideal environment for the illicit production and export of these drugs.  
According to U.S. and international law enforcement sources, China remains a major source of 
NPS seized in North America and Europe, which are often purchased via the internet and 
shipped to overseas customers.  Chemical alterations of scheduled drugs to circumvent existing 
anti-drug laws have hampered efforts to stem the flow of these drugs. 
 
The current opioid crisis in the United States underlines the importance of bilateral U.S.-Chinese 
drug control cooperation.  Based on U.S. Customs and Border Protection seizure data, China is 
the principal source country of illicit fentanyl and fentanyl-related compounds in the United 
States, including both scheduled and non-scheduled substances.  The challenges posed by 
trafficking via the internet and small parcel trafficking patterns are formidable and will test the 
cooperative spirit and ingenuity of law enforcement authorities in both countries. 
 
B.  Drug Control Accomplishments, Policies, and Trends 
 
 
1.  Institutional Development 
 
China’s drug control strategy focuses on prevention, education, illicit crop eradication, 
interdiction, rehabilitation, commercial regulation, and law enforcement.  The Ministry of Public 
Security (MPS) National Narcotics Control Commission (NNCC) is the primary national drug 
enforcement entity and works in conjunction with provincial public security bureau offices.  The 
Anti-Smuggling Bureau within the General Administration of Customs is responsible for the 
enforcement of China’s drug control laws at seaports, airports, and land border checkpoints.  
China maintains bilateral drug control agreements with many countries and international 
organizations, including the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime, and participates in a 
variety of international drug conferences and bilateral meetings.  There is no extradition treaty 


INCSR 2019 Volume 1  
 
 
 
 
Country Reports 
134 
 
between China and the United States.  China and the United States signed a bilateral mutual legal 
assistance agreement in 2000, which entered into force in 2001.  Despite the existence of a 
mutual legal assistance agreement, many outstanding requests by both the United States and 
China remained unfulfilled.  
 
  
2.  Supply Reduction 
 
According to the NNCC's 2017 Annual Drug Report (published June 2018), Chinese law 
enforcement investigated 140,000 drug – related cases, including 102,000 trafficking-related 
investigations and made 169,000 drug related arrests in 2017, a slight increase over the previous 
year.  Chinese authorities also targeted clandestine labs used to produce NPS and other synthetic 
drugs, illicit drugs, and precursors, destroying 317 clandestine laboratories, arresting 1,345 
suspects, and seizing 2,384 metric tons (MT) of precursor chemicals in 2017, an increase of 50 
percent over the previous year.  In 2017, Chinese authorities seized a total of 89.2 MT of illicit 
drugs, including 9.5 MT of heroin (an increase of 8 percent), 28.2 MT of methamphetamine (a 
decrease of 3 percent), and 7.3 MT of ketamine (a decrease of 30 percent). 
 
In February 2018, China added two fentanyl precursors, NPP and 4-ANPP, to the controlled 
substances schedule.  In August, China scheduled an additional 32 NPS, including two fentanyl 
analogues, bringing the total number of controlled NPS and related precursors to 175 and the 
total number of controlled fentanyl analogues to 25.  During the reporting period, the NNCC 
initiated “equipment control” measures requiring the registration of nuclear magnetic resonance 
spectrometry equipment that could be used in synthetic drug production. 
 
The NNCC identified the emergence of new types of NPS as a particular challenge.  According 
to China’s National Narcotics Laboratory, 230 types of NPS, including 34 previously 
unidentified substances, were found in China during 2018.  At the November 2018 Group of 20 
summit, China announced plans to control all fentanyl-related substances as a class to get ahead 
of traffickers who switch to non-scheduled NPS as individual substances are scheduled.  No 
timeline for implementation had been announced by the end of 2018. 
 
  
3.  Public Information, Prevention, and Treatment 
 
According to NNCC, synthetic drugs – primarily methamphetamine and ketamine – have 
surpassed heroin and other opioids as China’s primary domestic drug threat.  In public 
statements, the NNCC identified the increase in NPS abuses cases as an emerging trend, and, in 
addition to ketamine, identified methcathinone and the synthetic cannabinoid JWH-018 as 
commonly abused NPS.  According to the NNCC's 2017 Annual Drug Report, the total number 
of registered illegal drug users in China is 2.553 million, but the actual number of drug abusers is 
estimated to be at least 14 million, according to media reports.  Of the reported registered drug 
users, 1.538 million (60.2 percent) reportedly used synthetic drugs, while 970,000 (38 percent) 
reportedly used opioids (e.g., heroin) and 46,000 (1.8 percent) reportedly used cocaine, cannabis, 
and other drugs.  According to NNCC, 18 to 35 year olds were the largest demographic among 
registered drug users (55.6 percent).  In 2018, 344,000 new registered drug users were identified, 
with synthetic drug abusers accounting for 77.1 percent of new registered drug users.

In 2016, NNCC formulated and distributed its “Work Plan on Community-based Drug Treatment 
and Rehabilitation, 2016-2020” to further the development of a community-based drug treatment 
and recovery system.  The Plan supports NNCC efforts to combine methadone maintenance 
treatment and community-based drug treatment and recovery.  In addition to 770 clinics offering 
methadone maintenance treatment, China has in place 3,258 job placement sites and 29,000 
township level offices responsible for community-based drug treatment and recovery work, 
employing 31,000 full-time community workers.  According to the NNCC annual report, China 
placed 321,000 drug users into compulsory rehabilitation, and ordered another 260,000 people 
for treatment at community rehabilitation centers.  NNCC has an outreach program to raise 
awareness of the negative health effects of illicit drug use and promote drug demand reduction. 
 
 
4.  Corruption 
 
The Ministry of Public Security takes allegations of drug-related corruption seriously, and 
launches investigations when deemed appropriate.  Despite efforts to stem drug-related 
corruption, financial corruption among provincial, prefectural, county, and district government 
officials continues to be a concern.  The Government of China does not, as a matter of 
government policy, encourage or facilitate illicit drug production or distribution, nor is it 
involved in laundering the proceeds of the sale of illicit drugs.  Based on publicly available 
information, no senior Chinese official at the central government level is known to have 
facilitated the illicit production or distribution of drugs in 2017.  Similarly, no senior Chinese 
official from the central government is known to have laundered proceeds from drug-related 
activities. 
 
 C.  National Goals, Bilateral Cooperation, and U.S. Policy Initiatives 
 
The U.S.-China Bilateral Drug Intelligence Working Group, the Counter Narcotics Working 
Group, and a group of chemists and experts meet annually to exchange information on drug 
trends; discuss laws, regulations, and policies; seek progress and address challenges in precursor 
chemical control; and improve cooperation on investigations of mutual interest.  The August 
scheduling of 32 NPS was a result of these working-level exchanges.  During the reporting 
period, Chinese and U.S. law enforcement agencies cooperated in several drug-related 
investigations and officials from both countries met frequently outside of the formal dialogue 
mechanisms to discuss practical cooperation. 
 
D.  Conclusion 
 
Drug control cooperation between the United States and China continues to improve through law 
enforcement operational cooperation and various working groups and consultative mechanisms.  
While drug trafficking, manufacturing, diversion, and other drug-related crimes remain 
significant problems in China, the central government continues to take steps to integrate China 
into regional and global drug control efforts, as well as to address the country’s domestic drug 
problem through enforcement and rehabilitation.  U.S. law enforcement has made inroads in 
building working relationships with provincial public security bureaus, with oversight by central 
authorities, and relations continue to strengthen.

In order to confront the emerging trend of NPS and stem the future flow of fentanyl and other 
synthetic opioids to the United States, China should implement and strictly enforce as soon as 
possible the announced class-based scheduling of fentanyl related substances.  China also should 
strengthen enforcement of chemical control laws to prevent the diversion of drug precursors to 
illicit drug manufacture.

Colombia 
 
A.  Introduction 
 
Colombia is the world’s top producer and exporter of cocaine, as well as a source country of 
heroin and marijuana.  Colombian coca cultivation and cocaine production exceeded all-time 
record levels during 2017 (the most recent year for which data is available).  The United States 
estimates potential pure cocaine production increased by 19 percent, from 772 metric tons (MT) 
in 2016 to 921 MT in 2017.  The United States further estimates coca cultivation increased 11 
percent from 188,000 hectares (ha) in 2016 to 209,000 ha in 2017.  On March 1, 2018, the U.S. 
and Colombian governments agreed to an ambitious Five-Year Goal to reduce Colombia’s coca 
cultivation and cocaine production by 50 percent by the end of 2023.  Since taking office on 
August 7, 2018, Colombian President Ivan Duque has endorsed this goal and instituted an 
aggressive plan for police and military to increase coca eradication, interdiction, and operations 
targeting criminal organizations to achieve the Five-Year Goal.  In December 2018, the Duque 
administration released its whole-of-government drug control strategy, which aims to reduce 
drug consumption, decrease supply, dismantle criminal organizations, disrupt illicit financial 
flows, and increase state presence and economic opportunity in poor rural areas where criminal 
organizations and coca cultivation thrive.   
 
In 2018, the Colombian government took initial steps to increase efforts to reduce cocaine 
availability.  Colombia reported seizing or assisting with the seizure of over 450 MT of pure 
cocaine and cocaine base.  Coca eradication efforts increased, particularly since President Duque 
took office.  The Colombian government reported eradicating approximately 85,000 ha of coca 
during the calendar year through forced eradication and the crop substitution program, which 
resulted from the peace accord between the Colombian government and the Revolutionary 
Armed Forces of Colombia (FARC).  By increasing eradication results, the Colombian 
government eliminated tons of potential cocaine from the drug supply chain.  
 
According to the U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA), over 90 percent of the cocaine 
samples seized en route to and in the United States by U.S. law enforcement in 2017, and 
subjected to laboratory analysis, were of Colombian origin. 
 
B.  Drug Control Accomplishments, Policies, and Trends 
 
1. Institutional Development 
 
Colombia’s 2016 peace accord with the FARC ended a 52-year conflict, established new 
institutions to pursue justice for past crimes, and set in motion a disarmament, demobilization, 
and reintegration process for FARC ex-combatants.  Colombia continues to struggle with 
persistent security, governance, and economic challenges in neglected rural regions vacated by 
the FARC.  The Colombian government recognizes the illicit drug trade and the organized 
criminal groups it empowers are the greatest threats to peace and security in Colombia. 
 
The Colombian government suspended aerial eradication of coca in October 2015, but President 
Duque has publicly stated his intent to restart the use of aerial spray as a component of an 


INCSR 2019 Volume 1  
 
 
 
 
Country Reports 
138 
 
integrated drug control strategy that includes both manual and aerial eradication combined with 
interdiction, alternative development, and counter-criminal network operations.  
 
 
2.  Supply Reduction 
 
The United States estimates coca cultivation in Colombia increased 11 percent from 188,000 ha 
in 2016 to 209,000 ha in 2017.  In 2017, the Nariño department remained the leading coca-
producing region in Colombia, with an estimated 46,000 ha, up from 39,500 ha in 2016.  Other 
top coca-producing departments also saw increases from 2016 to 2017:  Norte de Santander 
(from 36,000 ha to 42,800 ha); Cauca (from 32,000 ha to 39,000 ha); and Putumayo (from 
19,500 ha to 21,000 ha).   
 
Several factors contributed to the surge in coca cultivation in Colombia since 2013, including:  
the end of aerial spray of glyphosate on coca; a crop substitution program that created perverse 
incentives for coca growers to grow more coca; and the failure of the FARC to comply with the 
illicit drug provisions of the peace agreement.  Drug traffickers employ effective counter-
eradication tactics such as protests and the use of improvised explosive devices in coca fields to 
kill, injure, and demoralize eradicators and to slow eradication operations. 
 
The Colombian government continued to make drug interdiction one of its drug control 
priorities, alongside investigating, prosecuting, and dismantling criminal groups and extraditing 
top drug traffickers to the United States.  Reducing the availability of illicit drugs requires a 
stable post-peace accord environment, the extension of citizen security and the rule of law 
throughout Colombia, economic development in rural areas, and the countering of illegal armed 
groups that have plagued Colombia for decades.  Colombian authorities, and third countries 
using Colombian intelligence, reported seizing over 450 MT of pure cocaine and cocaine base in 
2018, as well as approximately 250 MT of marijuana, over 320 kilograms of heroin, and 
destroyed 3,855 cocaine base laboratories and 319 cocaine hydrochloride (HCl) laboratories.   
 
 
3.  Public Information, Prevention, and Treatment 
 
According to the most recent National Household Survey of Drug Consumption, from 2014, 
drug use in Colombia rose between 2008 and 2013, making Colombia the country with the fourth 
highest consumption of cocaine and marijuana in South America.  Previously, it had one of the 
lowest consumption rates in the region.  As of 2013, there were over three million consumers of 
all categories of illicit drugs in Colombia, of which around two million were in major cities 
including Bogota, Medellin, and Cali. 
 
There are indications that drug use continues to increase among Colombian youth, with 
marijuana the substance of choice.  Use of inhalants and a cocaine by-product called “basuco” is 
high among those displaced by years of internal conflict in Colombia.  The Colombian National 
Police (CNP) has a prevention unit of 2,000 instructors who teach drug prevention to vulnerable 
schoolchildren nationwide. 
 
On October 1, 2018, two months after assuming office, President Duque signed a decree 
instructing the CNP to confiscate any drugs held by individuals in public spaces and issue a fine.  


INCSR 2019 Volume 1  
 
 
 
 
Country Reports 
139 
 
Legislation and judicial rulings previously allowed citizens to carry small amounts of marijuana 
and cocaine for personal use. 
 
Colombia focuses treatment on youth substance abusers.  Acknowledging that severe criminal 
sanctions disproportionately affect the most vulnerable in the drug-trafficking chain and 
contribute to prison overcrowding, the Colombian government created a juvenile drug court in 
Medellin and is planning juvenile drug courts in five other departments.  The Colombian 
government is working to expand restorative justice programs and programs that teach life, 
leadership, and cultural skills to youth treatment and detention centers.  The Colombian 
government will begin training professionals in the U.S.-developed Universal Treatment 
Curriculum and Universal Prevention Curriculum in 2019.  These curricula will provide 
evidence-based methods for improving treatment and prevention within Colombia. 
 
 
4.  Corruption 
 
As a matter of policy, the Colombian government does not encourage or facilitate illicit drug 
production or distribution, nor the laundering of proceeds of illicit drugs.  Nevertheless, 
corruption remains a significant problem.   
 
There were a series of high-profile corruption cases in 2018, including in Colombia’s justice 
sector where at least three Supreme Court justices are under investigation for, or charged with, 
corruption related to their positions.  The Colombian Supreme Court recently convicted the chief 
anticorruption prosecutor for corruption.  The prosecution of such high-profile, powerful 
individuals can be seen as a reflection of strengthened justice institutions, which have the 
capacity, political will, and autonomy to investigate, prosecute, and adjudicate corruption.   
 
Notwithstanding these notable corruption cases, the Colombian government has made significant 
strides in implementing its 2013 anticorruption strategy to improve transparency of, and public 
confidence in, government institutions.  The 2014 transparency and access to public information 
law was implemented in 2016, requiring all government entities to release information pertaining 
to salaries, management evaluations, the hiring processes, and the public budget.  
 
The government held an August 2018 referendum on anticorruption measures that would have 
strengthened accountability and transparency measures such as public bidding for contracts and 
imposed harsher penalties for those convicted of corruption.  While the referendum failed to 
meet the participation threshold, among the 11.5 million Colombian citizens who voted, 99 
percent voted in favor of the anticorruption measures. 
 
Colombia benefits from an independent attorney general (Fiscal) and inspector general 
(Procurador), both of whom publicly identify anticorruption efforts as a priority for their 
institutions.  Between August 1, 2016 and October 30, 2018, the Attorney General’s office 
opened 2,332 corruption investigations, 788 of which were against current government 
employees.  Two-hundred and three of those were against judicial branch employees, including 
106 investigations of current employees of the Attorney General’s office.  Another 550 were 
against former government employees and 994 were against private citizens.

C.  National Goals, Bilateral Cooperation, and U.S. Policy Initiatives 
 
On December 13, 2018, the Duque administration released its counternarcotics strategy, which 
sets clear goals and mandates a whole-of-government approach in key drug supply regions of the 
country.  The strategy outlines four pillars that aim to reduce growing domestic consumption, 
decrease the supply of drugs, dismantle criminal organizations, and disrupt illicit financial flows.  
It also focuses on increasing state presence and economic opportunity in poor rural areas where 
criminal organizations and coca cultivation thrive.  The strategy is an important step toward 
achieving the U.S.-Colombia bilateral goal to cut coca cultivation and cocaine production in 
Colombia by 50 percent by the end of 2023. 
 
The United States provides counter-drug assistance to the CNP, the Colombian military, and 
judicial institutions, including the offices of the attorney general and inspector general, the 
judiciary, and the corrections system, which investigate, prosecute, and incarcerate drug 
traffickers and other criminals.  The United States supports integrated programs designed to 
expand Colombia’s rural policing capabilities, while enabling the transition of rural communities 
out of coca-based economies by expanding the presence of the state in post-conflict regions, 
strengthening licit market linkages (for example promoting alternative crops such as coffee, 
cacao, palm, fruits, and vegetables), and promoting the rule of law and protection of human 
rights.  A notable example of this whole-of-government approach is the “Antioquia Libre de 
Coca (Free of Coca)” initiative, which brings together national and local governments, police 
and military forces, and the private sector to achieve sustainable drug control and development 
objectives.  Antioquia was the only major coca-growing department to see a decrease in hectares 
under cultivation in 2017, according to U.S. government estimates.   
 
Through the U.S.-Colombia Action Plan on Regional Security Cooperation, Colombia’s police 
and military export law enforcement capabilities and build regional connections by training 
Central America and Caribbean counterparts to counter transnational organized crime and drug 
trafficking.  The Action Plan expanded to include 415 activities in nine countries during 2017.  
Bilateral maritime counterdrug cooperation, exercised under the Agreement to Suppress Illicit 
Traffic at Sea that was signed in 1997, continues to be one of the most effective in the region, 
enabling the seizure of over 146 MT of cocaine in 2016. 
 
D.  Conclusion 
 
The illicit drug situation in Colombia remains a top concern of the U.S. government.  The CNP 
and military forces have begun to increase efforts to stem coca cultivation and cocaine 
production.  Colombia can achieve the Five-Year Goal to cut coca cultivation and cocaine 
production by 50 percent by the end of 2023 through aggressive implementation of and 
resourcing for its new whole-of-government drug control strategy, which seeks to increase 
eradication, interdiction, and counter-network operations, as well as to achieve sustainability of 
short-term efforts through rural development.  Extradition remains a crucial tool against 
individuals involved in drug trafficking, and demonstrates the cooperative effort of Colombia 
and the United States.  The U.S. government stands by the Colombian government in its efforts 
to achieve our shared objectives to combat illicit drug cultivation and trafficking.  The U.S. 
government will continue to closely monitor the development and implementation of Colombia’s

drug control strategy to ensure progress is made to reduce the production and trafficking of illicit 
drugs.

Costa Rica 
 
A.  Introduction 
 
Costa Rica’s strategic location, vast maritime territory, and the small size of its security forces 
combine to make it an attractive transit and logistics hub for illicit drug trafficking.  In 2018, 
Costa Rica remained one of the primary countries in the region for transshipment of cocaine to 
the United States.  During the first nine months of 2018, Costa Rican authorities seized a total of 
22.3 metric tons (MT) of cocaine.   
  
Though low for the region, the murder rate in Costa Rica surpassed 600 homicides in 2018, 
setting a new record for the third year in a row.  Continued turf war-related shootings and cartel-
style assassinations have exacerbated heightened public concern and intensified the Costa Rican 
government’s sharp focus on the fight against illicit drug trafficking.  
  
The government continued to increase its security spending in 2018, despite a severe fiscal crisis, 
allowing the hiring of more police officials across all services.  Institutional changes are also 
leading to additional police professionalization, major advances in investigations and 
prosecutions, and improved success in drug interdiction and disruption of drug trafficking 
organizations, as well as prevention programs.    
 
B.  Drug Control Accomplishments, Policies, and Trends 
 
 
1.  Institutional Development  
 
The Costa Rican government enacted encouraging institutional changes to combat the 
heightened threats from illicit drugs.  The Ministry of Public Security’s (MPS) budget increased 
by five percent in 2018, on top of an 11 percent increase in 2017.  This was further boosted by a 
reinstated security tax on companies (in 2017) which now provides a new annual stream of extra-
budgetary resources earmarked for security equipment and additional personnel.  As a result, the 
national police added 1,500 new officers between 2017 and 2018; the Coast Guard (SNG) grew 
by a third, the Border Police added officials; and the Air Surveillance Service (SVA) doubled its 
cadre of pilots and mechanics.  This represents continued growth in the capacity of the Costa 
Rican entities responsible for the majority drug seizures.     
  
The government continued important police professionalization efforts in 2018, including 
outfitting a new police academy, upgrades in the tactical training site, and additional cooperation 
between national law enforcement agencies and those of local governments. 
  
The reinstated security tax will also allow investment in new capabilities.  Through Foreign 
Military Sales (FMS), the government purchased a plane for $7.5 million that will be converted 
into the country’s first maritime patrol aircraft, which will be in service by late 2019.  Costa Rica 
also used its own funds to initiate a $9 million purchase of four highly capable interceptor/patrol 
boats for its Coast Guard, which will be delivered in 2019-2020. 
  


INCSR 2019 Volume 1  
 
 
 
 
Country Reports 
143 
 
The SNG remained a highly effective regional partner for maritime interdiction, including a 
growing desire to develop joint operations with the U.S. Coast Guard (USCG).  The arrival of 
three U.S.-donated 110-foot USCG cutters in April 2018 transformed the SNG.  The cutters have 
been used to great effect, and without pause, to establish Costa Rica’s first blue-water patrol in 
the busiest cocaine transit zone – at a fraction of the cost of using U.S. assets.   
  
Following on its success as the first lab in the region to receive international accreditation in key 
disciplines, the Costa Rican National Forensics lab was reaccredited in October 2018 for 
chemical analysis, toxicology, and biochemistry (including DNA testing), and successfully 
added ballistics.  This is the first lab in Central America to attain this top-level rating and only 
the third in the Latin American region (joining labs in Chile and Mexico).  The accreditation of 
the lab enhances the credibility of forensic evidence in the investigation and prosecution of 
cases, including cases of drug trafficking and crime and violence with linkages to drug 
trafficking.       
  
The six-year-old Border Police improved control of Costa Rica’s porous land border with 
Panama, including much expanded use of biometrics and improved cooperation with 
Panama.  The Air Surveillance Service (SVA) pushed to better control its airspace using radar 
technology supported by the United States.  In December, a multi-year project was initiated to 
donate and nationalize four twin-engine transport helicopters, providing Costa Rica with the 
ability, for the first time, to insert law enforcement teams where needed to counter the use of 
illicit airfields.  The helicopters will also support maritime interdiction missions.  SVA’s support 
for the Coast Guard will further expand upon the arrival of the maritime patrol aircraft (in late 
2019), and with improved capability for night-operations.  After a favorable constitutional court 
ruling in 2017, the government continued to expanded use of the Judicial Wire Intercept Program 
(JWIP) in 2018, and now boasts the largest JWIP capacity in Central America.   
 
 
2.  Supply Reduction 
 
During the first nine months of 2018, Costa Rica seized 22.3 MT of cocaine, already exceeding 
the amount seized during all of 2017.  In addition, the Costa Rican government, working closely 
with the U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration and regional partners, reportedly disrupted more 
than 20 international drug trafficking rings in Costa Rica during the first 10 months of the year. 
  
Costa Rica is a regional leader in eradicating and seizing marijuana.  During the first nine 
months of 2018, Costa Rican authorities destroyed 1.25 million plants and seized an additional 
4.3 MT of loose marijuana.  Local marijuana is grown primarily for domestic use.  To combat a 
growing cocaine-for-marijuana/arms trade between Jamaica and Costa Rica, the SNG will 
deploy more advanced maritime patrol boats in 2019 in the Caribbean. 
  
The government expanded cooperation on maritime interdiction and information exchange with 
Panama and Colombia in 2018, and initiated contacts with Jamaica.  
  
Seizure totals of illicit drugs other than cocaine and marijuana, including synthetic drugs, 
remained minimal in 2018.  For example, no heroin was seized in Costa Rica during the first 
nine months of the year, compared to only seven kilograms during the same period in 


INCSR 2019 Volume 1  
 
 
 
 
Country Reports 
144 
 
2017.  Organismo de Investigación Judicial (OIJ) and the Costa Rican Drug Institute monitor for 
signs of synthetic drugs in Costa Rica, which remain rare.  However, capacity building in this 
area increased in 2018, particularly related to identification of precursor chemicals, as well as 
understanding the criminal networks and patterns involved in its trafficking. 
 
 
3.  Public Information, Prevention, and Treatment 
 
The production, trafficking, and sale of illicit drugs remain serious criminal offenses in Costa 
Rica, even if laws against personal consumption are rarely enforced.  The Costa Rican Drug 
Institute is the government agency that oversees drug prevention programs, including publicity 
campaigns and materials for schools.  The Institute on Alcohol and Drug Abuse also offers 
treatment and prevention programs, though considerable gaps remain.  With the uptick in 
violence, the MPS is increasingly focused on prevention programs.  The National Police 
implement the Drug Abuse Resistance and Education (DARE) program and the Gang Resistance 
Education and Training (GREAT) program.  GREAT began in August 2013, and has grown from 
800 graduates in 2014 to over 15,000 in 2018. 
 
 
4.  Corruption 
 
The Costa Rican government does not encourage or facilitate illicit drug production or 
distribution, nor is it involved in laundering the proceeds of the sale of illicit drugs.  The growing 
presence of transnational criminal organizations and the harm they inflict on Costa Rican society, 
including corruption, is a chief concern.  The government generally implements a 2006 law that 
penalizes official corruption; however, there are frequent reports of low- and mid-level 
corruption, and periodic cases of high-level corruption.  The Costa Rican government has 
estimated it loses about seven percent of its GDP annually to corruption.   
  
The judicial branch is in the midst of a two-year effort to strengthen ethics controls within the 
judiciary.  The United States is actively supporting this and related efforts to stem corruption.   
  
A corruption and influence peddling scandal that broke in July 2017 has triggered investigations 
and suspensions of officials, and continues to cause political ripples.  The Judiciary has been 
most severely hit, with the head of the Supreme Court opting for early retirement, and a second 
justice removed from the court.  Three separate legal proceedings are being pursued by the 
Attorney General, the banking sector supervisor, and the National Assembly.    
 
C.  National Goals, Bilateral Cooperation, and U.S. Policy Initiatives 
 
Costa Rica shares the U.S. priorities of disrupting the flow of illicit drugs and dismantling 
organized crime.  The United States supports Costa Rican efforts to investigate and prosecute 
crimes more effectively, to make its borders more secure, and to increase the safety of its 
citizens, consistent with the Central America Regional Security Initiative (CARSI). 
  
The United States supports police professionalization through a range of training, police 
academy reform, and expanded tactical training capacity.  In 2018, the Costa Rican government 
adopted a U.S.-supported community security program as its national crime reduction plan.  In 


INCSR 2019 Volume 1  
 
 
 
 
Country Reports

so doing, they significantly expanded an intelligence-based citizen security initiative based on a 
Colombian model program designed to increase cooperation between law enforcement and local 
government to enhance citizen security.  The result is a whole-of-government preventative effort, 
“Sembremos Seguridad,” focused on addressing the drivers of insecurity and criminality, 
including drug trafficking, in Costa Rica’s most problematic neighborhoods.  Costa Rica plans to 
expand Sembremos Seguridad to all 82 municipalities.  
  
In the justice sector, the United States supports training programs for investigators, prosecutors, 
and judges on a broad range of topics, including trafficking in persons, money laundering, and 
counternarcotics.  The United States supports a highly successful restorative juvenile justice 
program, the second phase of which was launched in early 2018.   
  
The United States continues to support Costa Rican efforts to further strengthen the SNG and 
SVA’s interdiction capabilities, providing boats with greater reach, a ground-based radar, 
equipment, training, and professional exchanges.  These increasingly professional and strategic 
forces are willing partners with great potential.  In early 2018, the first Costa Rican liaison 
reported to the U.S. Joint Interagency Task Force South, marking an important milestone for 
multilateral cooperation on maritime drug interdiction. 
  
A U.S.-supported Maritime Interdiction Vetted Unit (MIVU) comprised of representatives from 
a specialized law enforcement unit and the SNG was organizationally revamped in 2016, 
retooled with improved equipment in 2017, and expanded to two units in 2018.   
 
D.  Conclusion 
 
Costa Rica took another step forward in 2018 in its efforts to strengthen its ability to combat 
drug trafficking and tackle the rising presence of transnational criminal organizations.  In 
addition to key investments in human capital and equipment, the government’s enactment of a 
security tax will provide an annual font of resources dedicated to security.  That said, Costa Rica 
must maintain its planned security sector growth over the mid-term if it hopes to keep up with 
the rapid increase in drug flows now permeating its territory, and the associated criminality.   
  
Top priorities for increasing effectiveness and efficiency should continue to include:  1) 
professionalizing police and judicial institutions, with an emphasis on anti-corruption; 2) 
augmenting the use of advanced investigative techniques aimed at organized crime; 3) further 
investment in border security, to include Border and Customs Police, and the continued build-up 
of the Coast Guard and Air Surveillance Service capabilities to control the country’s sovereign 
territory; 4) passing laws that specifically target organized crime and its proceeds; and 
5) continuing to strengthen Costa Rica’s cooperation with regional partners.  Its successful 
engagement with Panama and Colombia, for example, already yields results.

Cuba 
 
Cuba is not a major consumer, producer, or transit point of illicit drugs.  Cuba’s domestic 
production and consumption remain low due to active policing, strict sentencing, and nationwide 
prevention and public information programs.  Cuba’s intensive security presence and interdiction 
efforts have kept supply down and prevented traffickers from establishing a foothold.  Cuba 
concentrates supply reduction efforts on preventing smuggling through territorial waters, rapidly 
collecting abandoned drugs found washed up on coastal shores, and conducting thorough airport 
searches.  Cuba dedicates significant resources to prevent illicit drugs and their use from 
spreading, and regional traffickers typically avoid Cuba. 
 
While most maritime seizures are found washed up on the shores of Cuba’s southeastern coast, 
Cuban authorities have reported an increase in drugs found washed up on shores in the western 
provinces of Pinar del Rio and Isla Juventud.  The United States and Cuba continue to hold 
expanded bilateral discussions on law enforcement and drug control cooperation.   
 
With respect to international cooperation, the Cuban government reports 40 bilateral agreements 
for counterdrug cooperation, including the U.S.-Cuba Operational Cooperation Arrangement to 
Counter Illicit Traffic in Narcotics and Psychotropic Substances (signed in July 2016).  The U.S. 
Embassy maintains a U.S. Coast Guard (USCG) liaison to coordinate with Cuban law 
enforcement, particularly the Cuban Border Guards.  USCG and Cuban authorities share tactical 
information related to boats transiting Cuban territorial waters suspected of trafficking and 
coordinate responses between operational command centers.  In addition, the U.S. Drug 
Enforcement Administration (DEA) established direct communications with Cuba’s National 
Anti-drug Directorate in July 2016.  Since then, DEA has received approximately 20 requests for 
information related to drug investigations, as well as cooperation leading to Cuba’s successful 
arrest of a fugitive wanted in the United States. 
 
Cuba has demonstrated a willingness to turn over some U.S. fugitives of high interest.  Cuba and 
the United States continue to share communication between the national central authorities of 
both countries, which has greatly enhanced bilateral cooperation within the context of the U.S.-
Cuba Law Enforcement Dialogue.  Cuba has provided evidence and information to assist U.S. 
state and federal prosecutions.  In another first in law enforcement cooperation, on July 7, 2018, 
the USCG turned over drug samples and a case package on two Jamaican nationals detained by 
Cuban Border Guard after the USCG collected their jettisoned drugs.  Cuba continues to 
demonstrate a willingness to cooperate on law enforcement matters.

Dominican Republic 
 
A.  Introduction 
 
The Dominican Republic is the top transshipment hub for cocaine passing through the 
Caribbean, and the U.S. government estimates approximately 90 percent of the cocaine bound 
for North America and Europe through the Caribbean transits through the Dominican Republic.  
Maritime routes, involving the use of “go-fast” boats and commercial containers, continue to be 
the primary method of smuggling drugs into and out of the country.  The country is experiencing 
an increase in drug-related violence, especially as local groups engage in violent turf battles to 
control domestic drug distribution. 
 
To combat the influence of drug traffickers, the Dominican Republic continued its cooperation 
with the U.S. government in 2018 to interdict illicit drug shipments and extradite criminals.  The 
United States works actively with the Dominican Republic to plan and conduct international 
operations to seize illicit drugs and dismantle criminal organizations; however, corruption 
continues to hamper these efforts.  The Dominican government conducts outreach efforts to warn 
youth about the dangers of drugs. 
 
B.  Drug Control Accomplishments, Policies, and Trends 
 
1. Institutional Development 
 
Cooperation remains strong between the Dominican and U.S. governments to combat drug 
trafficking and related transnational crime.  The U.S. government’s primary partners are the 
National Directorate for the Control of Drugs (DNCD); the Dominican National Police (DNP); 
the National Council on Drugs (CND); the Office of the Attorney General; the National 
Intelligence Directorate (DNI); and the Dominican Armed Forces.  The Dominican Specialized 
Corps for Port Security, working in conjunction with U.S. authorities and private port operators, 
continued efforts to improve security at key ports.  The participation of the Dominican 
government in the Cooperative Situational Information Integration system, the Caribbean Basin 
Security Initiative (CBSI), and the Central America Integration System enhanced relations with 
the United States and regional Caribbean partners.  Dominican authorities continued joint efforts 
with the Haitian National Police to exchange information by establishing liaison officers in their 
respective headquarters. 
 
The Dominican Republic is a party to the Inter-American Convention against Corruption.  In 
1985, the United States and the Dominican Republic signed an agreement on international 
narcotics control cooperation.  The Dominican Republic signed and ratified the Caribbean 
Regional Maritime Agreement and has a maritime counterdrug agreement with the United States 
that entered into force in 1995.  The United States and the Dominican Republic signed an 
extradition treaty in 2015 that entered into force in December 2016, replacing the 1909 treaty, 
and provides for extradition on a much broader scope of crimes.  In 2012, the United States and 
the Dominican Republic entered into a Permanent Forfeited Asset-Sharing Agreement.  Through 
2018, approximately $4 million in assets have been shared under this agreement.  
 


INCSR 2019 Volume 1  
 
 
 
 
Country Reports 
148 
 
The Dominican Republic continues to be one of the most active extradition partners in the world 
for the United States.  Although there is no formal bilateral mutual legal assistance treaty 
between the Dominican Republic and the United States, requests for legal assistance are made 
through informal channels and formal means pursuant to multilateral law enforcement 
cooperation treaties and conventions to which the United States and the Dominican Republic are 
parties.  The Dominican Republic processes U.S. requests for legal and judicial assistance in a 
timely manner. 
 
2. Supply Reduction 
 
Illicit drugs are seized throughout the country, but the majority of seizures are made through 
operations targeting vessels from South America.  During the first eight months of 2018, 3.3 
metric tons (MT) of cocaine were seized directly by Dominican forces within the territory of the 
Dominican Republic.  During the same period, the Dominican government contributed to the 
seizure of 2.14 MT of cocaine entering and exiting the Dominican Republic by U.S. authorities 
and other international partners. 
 
Illicit drugs remain available for local consumption and are transshipped to the United States and 
Europe, primarily through maritime routes.  The DNCD and Dominican military continue to 
cooperate with the United States and international partners in planning and conducting 
operations to interdict go-fast vessels attempting to deliver illicit narcotics to the southern coast, 
as well as to interdict drugs exiting the Dominican Republic.  One Dominican port, Caucedo, is 
certified under the Container Security Initiative (CSI), a U.S. initiative to help increase security 
for maritime containerized cargo shipped to the United States.  However, the other 15 Dominican 
ports, including Rio Haina, the other major Dominican port handling container traffic destined 
for the United States, are not CSI certified.  The DNCD is increasing efforts to combat 
contraband at the ports. 
 
3. Public Information, Prevention, and Treatment 
 
Local drug use is concentrated in tourist centers and major metropolitan areas, although drug use 
and associated violence occurs throughout the country.  The CND conducted demand reduction 
efforts in 2018 to warn Dominican youth of the negative effects of illicit drug use under the 
Strategic National University Plan on the Prevention and Use of Drugs.  The DNP promoted 
community-based policing as an effective way to deal with crime locally.  With the publication 
of its Community Policing manual, the DNP began outreach at the command level to implement 
community policing concepts more fully in the capital and other major population centers around 
the country. 
 
4. Corruption 
 
As a matter of policy, the Dominican government does not encourage or facilitate illicit drug 
production or distribution, nor is it involved in laundering the proceeds of the sale of illicit drugs.  
However, corruption remains endemic.  The Government of the Dominican Republic has taken 
some steps to address corruption among military and law enforcement forces, but corruption 
remains a significant impediment to law enforcement efforts in the country and prosecution of 


INCSR 2019 Volume 1  
 
 
 
 
Country Reports 
149 
 
corrupt high-level officials is not the norm.  The judiciary is politicized and riddled with 
corruption, and the legal system offers little recourse to those who lack money or influence.  
 
A popular movement called the Green Movement that developed in response to the increased 
perception of corruption in the government, continued to protest impunity and pressure for 
greater transparency in 2018.  The perceived inaction against those that received $92 million in 
bribes from Brazilian company Odebrecht spurred the continuation of popular unrest against the 
government.  The Attorney General initially brought charges against 14 individuals, but 
eventually only presented charges against seven, including a previously sitting minister.  The 
judicial case began in late 2018 and will be heard before the Supreme Court.  While several 
judges were suspended in 2018 due to alleged links to narcotic traffickers and other officials in 
the executive and judiciary have been suspended from their functions due to anti-corruption 
investigations, there have been no convictions in these cases to date.  
 
C.  National Goals, Bilateral Cooperation, and U.S. Policy Initiatives 
 
The United States supports a wide range of efforts designed to reduce illicit trafficking, advance 
public safety and citizen security, and promote justice through CBSI.  With CBSI funds, the 
United States government implements programs designed to enhance existing Dominican law 
enforcement capabilities by improving technical and professional abilities to conduct 
investigations, to enable effective prosecution, and to coordinate and participate in drug control 
efforts with the United States and neighboring countries’ law enforcement agencies.  The U.S. 
law enforcement community has strong relationships with its Dominican colleagues, as 
evidenced by the high number of extraditions and deportations of fugitives to the United States. 
 
The United States provided equipment and training in 2018 to increase the capabilities of 
Dominican law enforcement entities, including support for the DNCD drug-detection canine 
units, and other specialized DNCD investigative and reactive units.  The United States enhanced 
DNCD’s computer training, database expansion, and systems maintenance support.  Dominican 
authorities work with neighboring countries to expand the use of a U.S.-supported canine facility 
as a regional training center.  The United States continues efforts to strengthen maritime 
capabilities through training in maritime law enforcement, search and rescue, port security, crisis 
management, and professional development for the Dominican Navy’s officer and enlisted corps. 
 
The United States provides tactical training, equipment, and other assistance to both the DNCD 
and Dominican military involved in illicit trafficking interdiction.  The United States assists the 
DNP with its transformation into a professional, civilian-oriented organization by providing 
training at the entry and officer levels as well as technical assistance to strengthen strategic 
planning and communication, operations management and human resource systems.  The 
Dominican legislature ratified a Police Organic Law in 2016 that has the potential to bring about 
significant institutional improvements to the DNP if fully implemented.  The Dominican 
Republic continues to work towards passing legislative proposals related to illicit enrichment and 
anti-corruption by public officials.  Efforts to strengthen the infrastructure of the Financial 
Analysis Unit remain ongoing. 
 


INCSR 2019 Volume 1  
 
 
 
 
Country Reports

The United States supports the Dominican Republic's efforts to establish a transparent and 
effective justice sector.  U.S. assistance promotes justice sector reforms by strengthening 
Dominican government capacity to manage and prosecute complex money laundering, fraud, 
public corruption, and illicit trafficking cases, as well as to establish internal controls to prevent 
corruption.  The United States works with the Offices of the Attorney General, Prosecutorial 
Training School, Judiciary, Public Ministry, Public Defense, Supreme Court of Justice, and 
Constitutional Tribunal.  These CBSI programs strengthen justice sector career, integrity, and 
accountability systems, and contribute to building the capacity of the national police and 
prosecutors to develop stronger cases and coordinate efforts leading to more successful 
prosecutions.  As part of CBSI, U.S. assistance strengthens Dominican civil society coalitions for 
citizen security and criminal justice reform, supports community justice houses that increase 
access to justice for vulnerable populations, and provides technical assistance for the 
implementation of the new organic law on police reform.  CBSI funds crime prevention 
programs that help at-risk youth pursue education, vocational training, and employment.  These 
programs support broader drug control efforts by enhancing life skills, facilitating positive 
interaction with police and improving communities’ trust in and willingness to work with police, 
thereby making communities more resilient to crime including crime with a nexus to drug 
trafficking, distribution, and drug use.   
 
The Dominican Republic regularly participates in two recurring events to promote cooperation 
against maritime trafficking; the Multilateral Maritime Counter Drug Summit and the 
Multilateral Maritime Interdiction and Prosecution Summit.  These two events bring together 
counterdrug professionals from over 30 countries and over 80 international organizations 
spanning North, Central, and South America, and Europe. 
 
D.  Conclusion 
 
Combating pervasive corruption, restoring public confidence in law enforcement, addressing 
illicit maritime drug smuggling, and confronting rising levels of drug-fueled violence are major 
challenges facing the Dominican Republic.  The Dominican Republic’s aerial and maritime 
interdiction efforts demonstrate institutional capacity and political will to help stem the flow of 
drugs into the country.  The Dominican government must continue to improve its efforts to build 
a coherent, multifaceted drug control program.  Key to this effort will be increased domestic 
cooperation between the DNP, DNCD, and military units, combined with greater cooperation 
with law enforcement agencies in other countries in the region.

Dutch Caribbean 
 
A.  Introduction 
 
The Dutch Caribbean consists of Aruba, Curaçao, Sint Maarten, Bonaire, St. Eustatius, and Saba.  
Aruba, Curaçao, and Sint Maarten are autonomous countries within the Kingdom of the 
Netherlands.  Bonaire, St. Eustatius and Saba are special municipalities of the country of the 
Netherlands. 
 
Aruba and Curaçao are located 30 to 40 miles north of Venezuela and continue to serve as 
northbound transshipment points for cocaine originating from Colombia and transiting 
Venezuela.  Cocaine is primarily transported via fishing boats and inter-coastal freighters for 
transshipment to the United States, other Caribbean islands, Africa, and Europe.  Sint Maarten is 
located in the Eastern Caribbean and is a transshipment hub for cocaine, heroin, and marijuana 
ultimately destined for Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin Islands as well as Europe. 
 
B.  Drug Control Accomplishments, Policies, and Trends 
 
 
1.  Institutional Development 
 
Aruba, Curaçao, and Sint Maarten have a high degree of autonomy over their internal affairs, 
with the right to exercise independent decision-making in a number of drug control areas.  The 
Kingdom of the Netherlands is responsible for the islands’ defense and foreign affairs, and 
assists the governments in their efforts to combat drug trafficking through its support for the RST 
(Dutch acronym for “Special Police Task Force”).   
 
In 2016, the United States, the Kingdom of the Netherlands, Aruba, Sint Maarten, and Curaçao 
signed a memorandum of understanding (MOU) to enhance existing cooperation and strengthen 
law enforcement and criminal justice systems in the Caribbean parts of the Kingdom of the 
Netherlands.  No new counterdrug programs were initiated in 2018.  
 
Aruba 
 
Aruba’s police force, the Korps Politie Aruba (KPA), continues to evolve into a regional leader 
in the fight against narcotics trafficking and international criminal organizations.  The KPA is at 
the forefront in collecting and sharing intelligence with regional law enforcement partners.  
Despite insufficient resources, the KPA continues to investigate trafficking organizations 
effectively.  The Organized Crime Unit of the KPA conducted several successful investigations 
during fiscal year 2018, which led to the seizure of over 380 kilograms (kg) of cocaine; 75 kg of 
marijuana; one kg of heroin; $2,100,000 in illicit drug proceeds; and the arrest of multiple 
subjects.    
 
Curaçao 
 
Curaçao’s police force, the Korps Politie Curaçao (KPC), works closely with the U.S. Drug 
Enforcement Administration (DEA) to diminish the flow of illegal drugs transiting from 


INCSR 2019 Volume 1  
 
 
 
 
Country Reports 
152 
 
Venezuela and Colombia to the Dutch Caribbean.  In June 2018, the KPC seized approximately 
102 kg of cocaine, eight kg of heroin, and 11 firearms in a single incident.  During the first 10 
months of 2018, the KPC seized approximately 1.6 metric tons (MT) of cocaine and eight kg of 
heroin.  KPC continues to investigate trafficking organizations effectively, but institutional 
weaknesses remain. 
 
St. Maarten 
 
St. Maarten/St. Martin is a transshipment point for cocaine in the Caribbean to the United States, 
partially due to its proximity to the U.S. Virgin Islands (approximately 100 nautical miles away) 
and Puerto Rico (approximately 200 nautical miles away), as well as to Europe.  This small two-
nation island is a challenging place for law enforcement to combat drug trafficking due to its 
separate legal jurisdictions between the Kingdom of the Netherlands (St. Maarten) and France 
(St. Martin).   In 2015, authorities in St. Maarten lifted the visa requirement for Colombian and 
Venezuelan nationals to travel to St. Maarten.  Colombian and Venezuelan drug trafficking 
organizations operating in St. Maarten/St. Martin mostly utilize Dominican nationals to transport 
large cocaine shipments, via “go-fast” vessel to the United States.  Many of the go-fast vessels 
are stored at unlicensed marinas located on the French side of St. Martin.   
 
According to DEA, multi-ton quantities of cocaine are smuggled into Puerto Rico and the U.S. 
Virgin Islands via go-fast vessels from St. Maarten/St. Martin on a monthly basis.  In 2018, U.S. 
authorities worked effectively with Dutch, French, and Dutch Caribbean authorities to target 
maritime vessels trafficking large quantities of cocaine from St. Maarten/St. Martin to Puerto 
Rico and the U.S. Virgin Islands.  These operations resulted in the seizure of approximately 1.67 
MT of cocaine and $143,000 in drug proceeds. 
 
Bonaire, St. Eustatius, Saba 
 
The National Office for the Caribbean in the Netherlands Ministry of Interior Affairs and 
Kingdom Relations assumes the responsibilities of law enforcement, security, and other 
administrative functions on behalf of the Government of the Netherlands for Bonaire, St. 
Eustatius, and Saba. 
 
2. Supply Reduction 
 
Due to increased intelligence sharing and cooperation between Dutch Caribbean law 
enforcement organizations and U.S. authorities, the opportunity to further disrupt drug 
trafficking is improving.  In addition, the aforementioned MOU promotes enhanced police 
enforcement and better organization for airport security and harbor/cruise terminal security with 
the goal of reducing drug trafficking.  According to DEA, in 2018, Dutch Caribbean authorities 
working with U.S. law enforcement support seized approximately 3.64 MT of cocaine; 454 kg of 
marijuana; nine kg of heroin; conducted 112 drug related arrests; and seized approximately 
$2,243,000 in assets from drug traffickers.  These statistics do not include seizures by the Dutch 
Navy.   
 
3. Public Information, Prevention, and Treatment  


INCSR 2019 Volume 1  
 
 
 
 
Country Reports 
153 
 
 
Drug treatment and prevention is accomplished through a combination of privately and publicly 
funded foundations on each of the islands.  Sint Maarten has one drug treatment foundation that 
suffered severe damage from Hurricane Irma in 2017 and has yet to fully recover. 
 
4. Corruption 
 
None of the Dutch Caribbean countries, as a matter of government policy, encourages or 
facilitates illegal activity associated with drug trafficking; however, in October 2018 
approximately 500 kg of seized cocaine were stolen from the KPC’s evidence vault in Curaçao.  
There is an ongoing investigation, but the evidence obtained at this juncture points to internal 
corruption in the local police force as the catalyst of the theft.   
 
C.  National Goals, Bilateral Cooperation, and U.S. Policy Initiatives 
 
The objectives of U.S. drug control policy in the Dutch Caribbean are to promote cooperation 
between law enforcement and military partners, and to reduce illicit drug trafficking.  DEA 
works with its island counterparts to advance joint investigations, both within the Dutch 
Caribbean and the United States. 
 
The Kingdom of the Netherlands supports drug control efforts by continuing to support U.S. Air 
Force Forward Operating Locations in Curaçao and Aruba.  U.S. military aircraft conduct 
detection and monitoring flights over the southern Caribbean Sea.  In addition, the Dutch Navy 
regularly conducts drug interdiction operations in the region as the lead for Task Group 4.4 under 
the auspices of Joint Interagency Task Force South.  With support from the U.S. Coast Guard, 
the Royal Netherlands Navy interdicted approximately 5.1 MT of cocaine during the first 10 
months of 2018 (not including Dutch Caribbean Coast Guard seizures).   
 
D.  Conclusion 
 
Eight years after the dissolution of the Netherlands Antilles, Curaçao and Sint Maarten are still 
establishing counterdrug organizational structures among their various agencies.  It is imperative 
that both islands embrace regional cooperation and intelligence sharing efforts.  Both Curaçao 
and Sint Maarten can look to Aruba as an example of how this is accomplished.

Eastern Caribbean 
  
A.  Introduction 
 
The Eastern Caribbean (EC) refers to the independent countries of Antigua and Barbuda, 
Barbados, Dominica, Grenada, Saint Kitts and Nevis, Saint Lucia, and Saint Vincent and the 
Grenadines collectively in this report.     
 
The EC is a transshipment point for cocaine and marijuana destined for North America, Europe, 
and the Caribbean.  There is cannabis cultivation in all EC countries, mostly for local 
consumption, and the amount grown varies from country to country.  There is a low local 
demand for cocaine, and negligible use of synthetic drugs.   
 
The geographic and jurisdictional diversity of the EC represent major challenges to combatting 
the illegal drug trade.  These countries do not have sufficient maritime resources to effectively 
patrol their entire coastlines.  Although traffickers use a variety of vessels like yachts and cargo 
ships to transport illicit drugs, “go-fast” boats are still popular, which enable traffickers to avoid 
capture by accessing multiple territorial waters.   
 
B.  Drug Control Accomplishments, Policies, and Trends  
  
 
1.  Institutional Development 
 
All EC countries have strong working relationships with the United States on drug control 
operations.  Grenada’s National Anti-Drug Strategy (2014-2018) was near completion at the end 
of 2018, and covers legislation, interdiction, education, and public awareness.  With the 
assistance of the Organization of American States, Saint Vincent and the Grenadines is in the 
process of establishing a new National Drug Council and creating a national drug policy.  Saint 
Kitts and Nevis has increased the size of its police force and opened a new forensics laboratory.  
Saint Lucia appointed a new drug squad commander in October 2018.  Antigua and Barbuda 
passed the 2018 Misuse of Drugs (Amendment) Act that exempts from criminal liability “a 
person who is in possession of a maximum of 15 grams of the drug Cannabis or Cannabis resin,”  
although smoking in public and selling it remains illegal.  Children under the age of 18 are 
required to participate in drug counseling if caught with cannabis or cannabis resin.  Barbados 
and Saint Vincent and the Grenadines are planning to allow cultivation, domestic use, and export 
of medicinal marijuana under licensing controls to countries where medicinal cannabis is legal.  
Saint Vincent and the Grenadines is also considering legalization of cannabis for religious 
purposes. 
 
All of these countries have extradition and mutual legal assistance treaties in force with the 
United States.  All have signed or ratified the Inter-American Convention against Corruption and 
the Inter-American Convention against Terrorism.  Antigua and Barbuda and Saint Lucia ratified 
the Inter-American Convention on Extradition.  Antigua and Barbuda, Dominica, and Grenada 
have signed and/or ratified the Inter-American Convention on Mutual Assistance in Criminal 
Matters.   
  


INCSR 2019 Volume 1  
 
 
 
 
Country Reports

2.  Supply Reduction 
 
During the first nine months of 2018, drug seizures in the EC totaled 661 kilograms of cocaine 
and nine metric tons of marijuana, according to data received from each country.  Saint Kitts and 
Nevis reported eradicating 45 hectares (ha) of cannabis, while Saint Lucia (10.5 ha), Saint 
Vincent and the Grenadines (eight ha), Dominica (1.2 ha), Antigua (.8 ha), and Grenada (.1 ha) 
reported eradicating smaller amounts of cultivation.  During the same period, Antigua and 
Barbuda reported 142 drug-related arrests with 70 prosecutions and 66 convictions.  Barbados 
reported 105 drug-related arrests with 105 prosecutions.  Dominica reported 49 drug-related 
arrests, 45 prosecutions, and 18 convictions.  Grenada reported 240 drug-related arrests, 401 
prosecutions, and 275 convictions.  Saint Kitts and Nevis reported 205 drug-related arrests, 205 
prosecutions, and 97 convictions.  Saint Lucia reported 146 drug-related arrests.  Saint Vincent 
and the Grenadines reported 213 drug-related arrests, 186 prosecutions, and 182 convictions.   
 
Some countries report a growing market for strains of marijuana from the United States and 
Canada.  Some countries also report an increase in the use of commercial cargo airlines and 
different types of marine vessels for transshipment.  Barbados reported more small-scale 
trafficking in 2018. 
 
The United States has provided assistance to all of the countries in the form of training and 
equipment.  This assistance has built better relationships for operational law enforcement 
purposes.        
 
 
3.  Public Information, Prevention, and Treatment 
 
Reliable statistics on consumption and use are not available, but the most commonly used drug is 
marijuana.  All of the countries have some form of drug demand reduction programming.  
Barbados, Grenada, and Saint Vincent and the Grenadines have implemented the U.S. Drug 
Abuse Resistance Education (DARE) program for youth.  Barbados also has programs through 
the National Council on Substance Abuse, the Centre for Counseling Addiction Support 
Alternative, and Alcoholics Anonymous.  The National Council on Substance Abuse monitors 
the programs through qualitative assessments, surveys, and pre- and post-tests.  The National 
Drug Avoidance Committee in the Ministry of Education operates Grenada’s programs.   
 
Notably, Saint Kitts and Nevis has four formal programs.  The Explorer program targets children 
in the 5-12 year age range.  Mentoring Advising Guiding Instructing Children (MAGIC) teaches 
children about the harmful effects of drugs.  Teen and Police Service (TAPS) targets 
predominantly at-risk or troubled teens.  Operation Future brings children and parents together to 
learn about the perils of drug use.   
 
Saint Lucia’s Substance Abuse Advisory Council Secretariat develops policies and programs 
tailored to individuals, communities, and the entire country.  Saint Vincent and the Grenadines 
has numerous programs, including police youth clubs and summer programs and a local cadet 
force.  The Pan Against Crime Initiative celebrated its 10th anniversary in 2018, and teaches 
young people to play steel drums.  For adults, Saint Vincent and the Grenadines has a Monday 
night radio program that allows police to reach a large audience with anti-drug messaging.

Not every country has drug rehabilitation clinics.  Antigua and Barbuda has two private 
rehabilitation centers.  Barbados has five drug rehabilitation clinics, while Saint Lucia and Saint 
Vincent and the Grenadines has one each.   
  
 
4.  Corruption 
  
As a matter of policy, the region’s governments do not encourage or facilitate the illicit 
production or distribution of narcotic or psychotropic drugs or other controlled substances, or the 
laundering of proceeds from illegal drug transactions.  In 2018, there were no arrests of senior 
government officials for drug-related activity. 
  
C.  National Goals, Bilateral Cooperation, and U.S. Policy Initiatives 
  
The United States supports a wide range of efforts designed to address crime and violence 
affecting EC citizens, primarily through the Caribbean Basin Security Initiative (CBSI).  CBSI is 
a security partnership between the United States and Caribbean nations that seeks to substantially 
reduce illicit trafficking, advance public safety and citizen security, and promote justice.  CBSI 
programming in the Eastern Caribbean strengthens the capacity of law enforcement institutions 
to detect, interdict, prosecute, convict, and incarcerate criminals.  The programs support 
information sharing networks, joint interagency operations, and regional training initiatives to 
promote interoperability. 
 
The United States maintains bilateral agreements to suppress illicit traffic by sea with Antigua 
and Barbuda, Barbados, Dominica, Grenada, St. Kitts and Nevis, St. Lucia, and St. Vincent and 
the Grenadines, which include provisions regarding ship boarding, shipriders, pursuit, entry into 
territorial waters, overflight, and order to land.  
 
In addition to the bilateral agreements the United States has with each country, the United States 
signed an agreement with the Regional Security System (RSS).  The main drug control goals of 
that agreement include supporting operations of the RSS Air Wing and the RSS Digital Forensic 
Lab and collaborating on training for all member states.   
 
D.  Conclusion 
  
The United States enjoys strong operational cooperation with EC countries on drug control 
matters.  Through these relations, these countries prosecuted at least 10 major traffickers in 2018.  
The United States strongly recommends that all countries meet their financial commitments to 
the RSS and, for those in arrears, pay their back dues.  The United States also recommends that 
standard operating procedures for communication and coordination domestically and 
internationally between and among EC countries be further developed and implemented, where 
those procedures do not already exist.

Ecuador 
 
A.  Introduction 
  
Situated between two of the world’s largest cocaine producing countries, Ecuador is a major 
transit country for illicit drugs.  Cocaine and heroin from Colombia and cocaine from Peru is 
trafficked through porous land borders and via maritime routes for distribution to the United 
States and Europe.  While not a major drug producing country, Ecuador is a major transit country 
for chemical precursors to process illicit drugs and is vulnerable to transnational organized crime 
due to permeable borders and corruption.  While committed to combating drug trafficking, 
Ecuador’s police, military, and judiciary lack sufficient resources to confront transnational 
criminal challenges.  
 
The government of President Lenin Moreno, who took office in May 2017, remains committed 
to reducing both drug supply and drug demand, as reflected in a new 2017-2021 National Drug 
Prevention and Control Plan.  Domestic drug consumption is rising and public treatment 
facilities are insufficient to treat the country’s population suffering from substance use disorders.   
 
In the first quarter of 2018, the drug trafficking group Oliver Sinisterra Front, led by a former 
Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia (FARC) guerrilla member, carried out attacks, 
kidnappings, and killings of journalists, military personnel, and private citizens along Ecuador’s 
northern border with Colombia.  To respond to this threat, the Ecuadorian government has 
increased security forces at the border, strengthened cooperation with Colombia, and issued a 
new Northern Border Security, Peace, and Development Plan.  The Moreno government has also 
made positive steps to expand cooperation with the United States and other international partners 
to fight transnational crime and drugs.   
  
B.  Drug Control Accomplishments, Policies, and Trends 
  
1.  Institutional Development 
  
The Ecuadorian government is concerned about the detrimental effects of drug trafficking and 
transnational organized crime throughout the country.  During the first 10 months of 2018, 
10,144 individuals were arrested for trafficking-related crimes, compared to 9,054 during the 
same period in 2017, an increase of 12 percent.  In April 2018, as part of a government-wide 
downsizing initiative, President Moreno eliminated the Technical Secretariat of Drugs (SETED) 
that was previously responsible for coordinating the overall drug control policy in Ecuador.  The 
Ministry of Health assumed coordination and oversight of drug prevention, demand reduction, 
and treatment programs.  The Ministry of Interior is now responsible for combating the 
production, trafficking, sale, and use of illicit drugs, as well as regulating the use of controlled 
substances and destroying seized substances.  The now defunct SETED destroyed 35 metric tons 
(MT) of seized illegal substances during the first six months of 2018.  The Ministry of Interior 
reported it destroyed 16 MT of seized illegal substances between July and October.  In early 
October, Ecuadorian media reported that 26.4 MT of seized drugs were being stored in five 
warehouses nationwide, waiting to be incinerated.

Ecuador’s 2008 constitution categorizes drug abuse as a public health problem and mandates that 
the government develop prevention programs and provide treatment and rehabilitation options to 
persons with substance use disorders.  A criminal code (COIP) that went into effect in 2014 
increased penalties for most crimes, while decriminalizing personal use, possession, and 
consumption of relatively small amounts of narcotics.  The COIP created a tiered approach to 
drug trafficking and possession, with larger amounts carrying longer prison sentences.   
 
In September 2015, the National Assembly approved amendments to the 2014 COIP that created 
a table of drug quantities and penalties, drastically reducing the minimum amount of narcotics 
required to trigger each tier of punishment.  In 2016, Ecuador established two special crime 
laboratories in Quito and Guayaquil.  
 
The Government of Ecuador has bilateral drug control agreements with many countries in the 
region, including the United States.  The United States and Ecuador have agreements on 
measures to prevent the diversion of precursor chemicals, the sharing of information for currency 
transactions over $10,000, and a customs mutual assistance agreement.  In April 2018, the 
Ministry of Interior signed a MOU with DHS to establish a Transnational Criminal Investigative 
Unit, and a framework agreement MOU with U.S. Immigration and Custom Enforcement and the 
DEA to facilitate drug control and border security cooperation and information sharing.  
 
In June 2018, the Ecuadorian Ministry of Defense and U.S. Department of Defense signed a 
memorandum of agreement to place an Ecuadorian liaison officer at the U.S. Joint Interagency 
Task Force-South (JIATF-S) in Florida.  In September 2018, U.S. Customs and Border Patrol, 
under the authority of JIATF-S, initiated regular maritime patrol flights in coordination with the 
Ecuadorian Ministries of Defense and Interior and with the participation of Ecuadorian military 
and police riders, to monitor and interdict maritime drug trafficking in the Eastern Pacific.  The 
U.S. Coast Guard and Ecuadorian maritime authorities also exercise Maritime Operational 
Procedures that coordinate the boarding of vessels claiming Ecuadorian nationality and stateless 
vessels in international waters.  In October 2018, the Minister of Interior, the Attorney General, 
and DEA signed an MOU regarding information exchange.  DEA continues to support a vetted 
unit within the National Police Antinarcotics Division. 
 
The United States and Ecuador are parties to an 1873 extradition treaty and a supplementary 
treaty that entered into force in 1941.  However, Ecuador’s constitution prohibits the extradition 
of Ecuadorian citizens.  The United States has worked with the Moreno administration to 
improve administrative processes related to extradition requests.  The United States and Ecuador 
do not have a bilateral mutual legal assistance treaty, but cooperate under the Inter-American 
Convention on Mutual Assistance in Criminal Matters, as well as relevant UN conventions.     
 
2.  Supply Reduction 
  
Ecuador remains a major transit country for cocaine shipments via air, land, and maritime routes, 
and heroin shipments via air and mail.  Drug traffickers use various methods to move shipments, 
including containerized cargo ships, small fishing boats, self-propelled semi-submersible and 
fully-submersible submarines, “go-fast” boats, aircraft, human couriers, and mail.  Ecuadorian 
maritime trafficking networks consistently use routes south of the Galapagos Islands to 


INCSR 2019 Volume 1  
 
 
 
 
Country Reports 
159 
 
destinations in Central America to circumvent law enforcement interdiction efforts.  
Transnational criminal organizations, many based in Mexico and Colombia, continue to operate 
in Ecuador.  
 
Official police statistics indicate that during the first 10 months of 2018, cocaine seizures totaled 
54 MT, equal to the 54 MT of cocaine seized during the same period in 2017.  The volume of 
heroin seized during this same 10-month period totaled 198 kilograms (kg), a decline from 2017, 
when 305 kg were seized during the same period.  Twelve MT of marijuana were seized during 
the first 10 months of 2018, compared with 10 MT during the first 10 months in 2017.  In the 
month of August 2018 alone, several Ecuadorian National Police (ENP) units in conjunction 
with DEA carried out a series of highly effective operations that resulted in the seizure of 4.7 MT 
of cocaine hydrochloride, 14 MT of calcium chloride, 9.45 kg of heroin, and 21 arrests.  
 
Maritime seizures of all illicit drugs totaled 5.8 MT during the first 10 months of 2018, compared 
to approximately 6.8 MT in all of 2017.  This included three MT of cocaine seized in 
international waters close to the Galapagos Islands as a result of the first deployment of a 
Customs and Border Protection (CBP) P-3 maritime patrol aircraft to Ecuador in September 
2018.  
 
Drug traffickers use containerized cargo and shipping containers to smuggle drugs out of 
Ecuador, often concealing drugs in licit cargo.  The Port of Guayaquil is a major transshipment 
hub for cocaine concealed in containerized cargo to Europe.  The port authority, Contecon, 
employs security measures at its facility but inspects only 7 percent of containerized exports.  
During the first 10 months of 2018, the port authority inspected 38,745 containers.  In July 2018, 
the United States and Ecuador signed a Declaration of Principles incorporating Ecuador into the 
Container Security Initiative, which permits CBP personnel to be posted at the Port of Guayaquil 
to work with Ecuadorian authorities to strengthen the port security and facilitate trade.   
 
The last survey on coca cultivation in 2014 by the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime 
(UNODC) showed no significant coca cultivation in Ecuador.  In 2018, Ecuadorian authorities 
detected small-scale coca cultivation along the northern border.  The government’s policy is for 
the police or military to eradicate immediately coca, poppy, or cannabis when discovered, 
although nearly all poppy plants are wild and not cultivated for heroin production.  Largely due 
to the refocusing of security efforts in response to violence on the northern border in early 2018, 
the government decreased eradication of coca plants from 10,100 to 3,798 and did not eradicate 
any poppy plants, compared to the 145,074 poppy plants eradicated during the first 10 months of 
2017.     
 
Synthetic drug production and consumption is an issue of growing concern for Ecuadorian 
authorities, and the government has made arrests of organized groups involved in trafficking 
synthetic drugs.  Ecuador has reported to UNODC the emergence of new psychoactive 
substances. 
 
3.  Public Information, Prevention, and Treatment

Domestic drug abuse is a growing challenge in Ecuador.  UNODC carries out demand reduction 
and drug prevention programs in Ecuador with funding from the United States, European Union, 
and other international donors.  In May 2018, UNODC held a U.S.-funded policymakers 
workshop for 70 National Assembly members and their advisors on the nature, prevention, and 
treatment of drug use disorders.  According to UNODC data, 12.7 percent of university students 
used some type of illicit drug in 2016.  All drug offenders are entitled to drug treatment under the 
Ecuadorian constitution, but there is a lack of adequate resources and facilities to treat those with 
addictions.  As of October 2018, there were 45 publicly funded outpatient drug treatment 
facilities and 12 public inpatient drug treatment facilities in Ecuador.  Other drug treatment 
options, such as the 198 private facilities that provide drug treatment alternatives, are often 
prohibitively costly.  
 
In January 2018, the Ecuadorian government launched the “2017-2021 National Plan for 
Comprehensive Prevention and Control of the Socio-Economic Phenomenon of Drugs.”  In 
2018, the Ministry of Health, Ministry of Interior, and ENP conducted drug abuse public 
awareness campaigns targeted at teachers, religious leaders, children, and youth, among others.  
The Government of Ecuador also launched in January 2018 a public awareness television 
campaign called “Por Un Mar Sin Drogas” (“For a Sea without Drugs”) to highlight the dangers 
of drug abuse and deter fishermen from engaging in drug trafficking.    
  
4.  Corruption 
  
President Moreno has made anticorruption a priority of his administration.  A number of 
prosecutions in 2017-2018 have led to the conviction of government officials involved in 
corruption cases, including a six-year prison sentence for former Vice President Jorge Glas for 
illicit association in connection with the Brazilian company Odebrecht’s corruption scandal.   As 
a matter of policy, the Ecuadorian government does not encourage or facilitate the illicit 
production or distribution of narcotic or other controlled substances, or the laundering of 
proceeds from illegal drug transactions.  In February 2018, a national referendum approved a 
lifelong ban from public office of government officials convicted of corruption.  The National 
Assembly is also considering proposals for a new law to recover illicit proceeds from corruption.  
 
Drug-related corruption remains a problem within the public security forces.  On September 12, 
two members of the Ecuadorian Air Force were arrested for carrying one metric ton of cocaine in 
the Ecuadorian military base in Manta.  In October, Ecuadorian authorities arrested and said they 
intended to prosecute seven military officials and six civilians for altering the Armed Forces’ 
inventory system and trafficking ammunition to the drug trafficking group Oliver Sinisterra 
Front.     
 
Ecuador has looked to increase international cooperation on anticorruption.  The Ministry of 
Foreign Affairs entered into a Memorandum of Understanding on Anti-Corruption with UNODC 
in 2017 to exchange international best practices on transparency, education, and prevention.  In 
July 2018, Ecuador joined the Open Government Partnership, an international civil society 
initiative that promotes government transparency. 
 
C.  National Goals, Bilateral Cooperation, and U.S. Policy Initiatives 


INCSR 2019 Volume 1  
 
 
 
 
Country Reports

The Moreno administration has expressed a strong commitment to work with international 
partners, including the United States, to fight transnational crime and drug trafficking and 
strengthen security, particularly in its northern border area.  Between January and April 2018, the 
Oliver Sinisterra Front conducted a series of bombings and attacks against the military and police 
in Esmeraldas province that resulted in the death of four military officers and culminated in the 
kidnapping and murder of three journalists and two private citizens.  The Government of 
Ecuador augmented its security presence along the northern border with Colombia to over 
12,000 military and police personnel.  The Moreno administration also increased its 
communication and coordination with Colombian authorities.  At Ecuador’s request, the U.S. 
government provided assistance and training in post-blast investigations.  In September 2018, the 
Government of Ecuador launched a Northern Border Security, Peace and Development Plan to 
provide a comprehensive approach to respond to insecurity on the northern border, and has 
proposed new laws to strengthen public security and strategic intelligence.   
 
The U.S. and Ecuadorian governments reestablished in 2018 a framework for growing bilateral 
security and drug control cooperation.  During a June 2018 visit to Ecuador, U.S. Vice President 
Mike Pence announced the United States would provide $3.45 million in new bilateral funding 
for capacity-building and technical assistance programs to strengthen Ecuador’s criminal justice 
and law enforcement capabilities.  Additionally, per the request of the Ecuadorian government, 
the United States reestablished its Office of Security Cooperation at Embassy Quito in August 
2018, which the previous Ecuadorian government had closed in 2014.   
 
In 2018, the United States supported Ecuador’s drug prevention efforts in coordination with 
Ministry of Interior, National Assembly, SETED and other governmental and multilateral 
entities.  In June 2018, the Community Anti-Drug Coalition of America organization began 
conducting U.S.-funded trainings and workshops in Duran to develop anti-drug use community 
coalitions.    
 
Throughout 2018, the United States provided ongoing logistical and operational support for 
Ecuadorian counterdrug operations.  As a result of regional cooperation among DEA, the 
Ecuadorian police, and Colombian law enforcement, Edison Prado Alava, a U.S. Government 
Consolidated Priority Organization Target, was extradited to the United States in February 2018 
and pleaded guilty to charges in a Southern Florida court.  Pursuant to the April 2018 agreement, 
the Ecuadorian National Police established a new Transnational Crime Investigative Unit that 
received U.S. training.  The United States continues to work with Ecuadorian police and security 
officials to increase their interdiction capacity at sea and in port facilities, including through the 
P-3 program and Container Security Initiative.   
 
Since 2006, the United States has maintained an operational arrangement with Ecuador to stop, 
board, and search Ecuadorian vessels reasonably suspected of drug smuggling encountered at 
sea.  Ecuador is a founding member of the semi-annual Multilateral Maritime Counterdrug 
Summit, which brings together maritime counterdrug professionals from approximately 25 
countries and over 60 international agencies spanning North, South and Central America, and 
Europe.

D.  Conclusion 
  
The United States supports Ecuador’s drug control efforts and strongly encourages Ecuador to 
take further steps to interdict illicit drugs and control of chemical precursors, both on land and at 
sea.  To address the growing challenges of drug trafficking, the Ecuadorian government will 
need to continue working with international partners and devote additional resources to augment 
the capacity of the police and military through improved communications, equipment, and 
technology to facilitate investigations, and provision of additional training for the police and the 
military.  The Ecuadorian government should also focus on securing containerized, maritime 
cargo from illicit use and increasing maritime interdiction capacity.

El Salvador 
  
A.  Introduction 
  
El Salvador remains a transit country for illicit drugs originating from source countries in South 
America destined for the United States.  In 2018, El Salvador maintained an active maritime 
presence though interdiction operations by the Salvadoran Navy and information-sharing with 
international partners that served to push most maritime traffic beyond the 200 nautical mile 
mark El Salvador claims as its territorial waters.  Analysis of drug trafficking trends suggests 
drug trafficking organizations are trafficking cocaine shipments by maritime conveyance farther 
offshore into the Pacific Ocean, beyond the operational capacity of the Salvadoran Navy, to 
avoid detection. 
 
Transnational cocaine-trafficking organizations use private vehicles to transport small amounts 
of cocaine to the Guatemalan border along the Pan-American Highway.   
 
The Salvadoran government continues to implement Plan El Salvador Seguro (PESS), a 
geographically targeted approach to reducing crime in the most violent municipalities that 
includes support for drug prevention components.  The Salvadoran government also continued a 
series of emergency measures launched in 2016 aimed at securing the nation’s prisons and 
dismantling gang leadership structures that play a role in local drug distribution, and transitioned 
the majority of the measures into the penal code.  A lack of reliable information on the severity 
of drug consumption and internal distribution within El Salvador continues to present a 
challenge. 
 
B.  Drug Control Accomplishments, Policies, and Trends 
  
          1.  Institutional Development 
  
The Anti-Narcotics Division (DAN) of the National Civil Police (PNC) is the primary agency 
responsible for combating drug-related crimes throughout El Salvador.  The vetted Special Anti-
Narcotics Group (GEAN) within the DAN is responsible for conducting sensitive drug 
investigations.  In 2018, the GEAN continued to build institutional links with more advanced 
Sensitive Investigation Units (SIUs) in Guatemala and Colombia, greatly expanding El 
Salvador’s ability to respond to drug trafficking alerts and to investigate larger criminal 
organizations.  El Salvador supports a full-time liaison officer within the U.S. Joint Interagency 
Task Force South (JIATF-S) to support regional drug control coordination. 
 
El Salvador’s National Electronic Monitoring Center began operations in June 2012 with support 
from the United States.  The center allows Salvadoran law enforcement authorities with judicial 
warrants to intercept electronic communications to support drug trafficking investigations, 
increasing operational coordination between the DAN, GEAN, other Salvadoran investigative 
authorities, and international partners.  This improved intelligence sharing proved pivotal in the 
August conviction of 61 leaders and members of the transnational criminal gang Mara 
Salvatrucha (MS-13) on more than 150 criminal charges including drug trafficking.   
 


INCSR 2019 Volume 1  
 
 
 
 
Country Reports 
164 
 
A sustained decline in maritime drug trafficking within Salvadoran territorial waters led to 
decreased littoral interdiction operations by the Joint Interagency Task Force “Grupo Conjunto 
Cuscatlán” (GCC).  The unit, equipped for patrols along coastal waterways, encountered little 
drug trafficking in 2018, and thus continued its focus on operations supporting the arrest of gang 
members operating from remote estuarine and coastal safe havens.  The Salvadoran Navy 
maintains primary responsibility for maritime interdiction at or beyond 200 nautical miles from 
El Salvador’s coastline.  The average interdiction occurs between 400-500 nautical miles 
offshore, and suspects are detained and escorted ashore for processing by the Salvadoran justice 
system.  The GCC maintains its primary headquarters away from military facilities and with a 
primary emphasis on anti-gang efforts, but remains equipped to coordinate with the Navy on 
littoral interdiction if maritime trafficking trends shift back to where they were in previous years.  
The deterioration of the GCC’s relationship with the Salvadoran Navy limited the GCC’s ability 
to regularly support naval interdictions. 
 
In August 2018, El Salvador’s Attorney General and the Director of the PNC announced the 
arrests of over 350 MS-13 gang members and the seizure of 100 vehicles, property, and 
businesses during a complex yearlong investigation.  The arresting agents secured warrants of 
known gang members, affiliates, and co-conspirators on charges including homicide, drug 
trafficking, money laundering, and terrorism.  As a result of United States assistance and 
training, the coordinated takedown represented a significant increase of the Government of El 
Salvador’s capability to debilitate MS-13 operations through large-scale arrest operations with 
asset forfeitures. 
 
El Salvador is party to the Central American Convention for the Prevention of Money 
Laundering Related to Drug-Trafficking and Similar Crimes, the Inter-American Convention 
Against Corruption, the Inter-American Convention on Extradition, and the Inter-American 
Convention on Mutual Assistance in Criminal Matters. 
 
          2.  Supply Reduction 
  
Between January 1 and November 20, Salvadoran authorities seized approximately 12.45 metric 
tons (MT) of cocaine, 877 kilograms (kg) of marijuana, and 3.39 kg of “crack” cocaine.  Cocaine 
seizures in 2018 increased 120 percent compared to the same period in 2017, due to the GEAN 
and Salvadoran Navy’s increased cooperation and intelligence-driven operations with U.S. 
maritime authorities.  In November, the Salvadoran Navy conducted an operation based on 
information provided by international partners that resulted in the seizure of 6.38 MT of cocaine 
250 nautical miles off the coast of El Salvador, representing the largest seizure in Salvadoran 
history.  El Salvador continued to divert human and material resources from the DAN to support 
anti-gang operations in 2018, though the impact on seizures was limited.  During the first 10 
months of 2018, Salvadoran authorities seized $550,314 in bulk currency – a 31 percent decrease 
compared to the same period in 2017 – and arrested 2,949 individuals on drug-related crimes. 
 
          3.  Public Information, Prevention, and Treatment 
  
Drug use among Salvadorans is a growing concern, particularly among youth.  The government 
has not kept reliable statistics for illegal consumption since 2012.  The PNC has been 


INCSR 2019 Volume 1  
 
 
 
 
Country Reports 
165 
 
successfully implementing the Gang Resistance Education and Training (GREAT) program in 
public schools throughout Model Police Precinct (MPP) locations, which combine training and 
police-community relation activities.  In 2018, the United States trained and certified 80 
Salvadoran PNC officers as full-time GREAT instructors, raising the total trained since the 
program began in 2010 to 470.  In 2018, these officers delivered GREAT to over 25,000 at-risk 
youth throughout the country.  In addition to the GREAT program, the PNC established Police 
Athletic Leagues (PAL), benefitting over 18,800 at-risk youth.   
 
As of October, the United States’ partnership with the PNC continued to support citizen security 
and prevention activities in 50 municipal districts through the MPP Program, with four additional 
communities scheduled to reach MPP status by the end of 2018.  The MPP, GREAT, and PAL 
programs now cover all 19 delegations across El Salvador, and were nationalized into the 
Government of El Salvador’s National Prevention Strategy.  These programs support broader 
drug control goals by facilitating positive interaction between youth and police and improving 
communities’ trust in and willingness to work with police, thereby making communities more 
resilient to crime including crime with a nexus to drug trafficking and use.   
 
In 2018, the Government of El Salvador launched its School Resource Officer Program charged 
with the protection and education of students while promoting safety and respect for law 
enforcement.  The United States provides training to support this initiative, and certified 60 
officers in the program during 2018.  
 
          4.  Corruption 
  
The Government of El Salvador does not, as a matter of government policy, encourage or 
facilitate illicit drug production or distribution, nor is it involved in laundering the proceeds of 
the sale of illicit drugs.  However, corruption within the Salvadoran political system remains a 
serious problem.  The United States continues to utilize U.S.-trained Colombian polygraphists 
via the trilateral U.S.-Colombia Action Plan to assist El Salvador’s security forces with 
anticorruption efforts.  During the first 10 months of 2018, Colombian polygraphists completed 
630 exams of PNC investigative units, DAN, GCC, Attorney General staff, and U.S.-supported 
task forces, with plans to complete an additional 250 exams by the end of 2018.  In September, 
Attorney General Douglas Melendez successfully won a conviction against former President 
Antonio Saca on corruption and money laundering charges, which marks the first former 
Salvadoran president tried and convicted for illegal acts during his time in office.  Melendez, 
who made large strides in combating corruption in El Salvador, completed his three-year term in 
January.  It is unclear whether his successor, Raul Melara, will demonstrate the same 
commitment to combating corruption.  
 
In July, El Salvador’s legislative assembly passed new legislation giving greater autonomy to the 
country’s Financial Investigation Unit (FIU), in an effort to comply with a request from the 
Egmont Group, a network of international FIUs.  However, a Presidential veto in August over 
constitutional concerns resulted in the suspension of El Salvador’s FIU from the Egmont Group, 
for its inability to maintain operational independence and autonomy.  The Legislative Assembly 
managed to override a presidential veto in October, following intense pressure by the 
international community, and the law will be reviewed by the Constitutional Chamber of the 


INCSR 2019 Volume 1  
 
 
 
 
Country Reports 
166 
 
Supreme Court.  El Salvador now has until July 2019 to avoid being expelled completely from 
Egmont, which could further complicate prosecution of corruption cases.   
 
C.  National Goals, Bilateral Cooperation, and U.S. Policy Initiatives 
  
The United States supports citizen security, law enforcement, and rule-of-law programs in El 
Salvador through the U.S. Strategy for Central America and the Central America Regional 
Security Initiative (CARSI), supporting El Salvador’s implementation of PESS and the Plan of 
the Alliance for Prosperity, a regional plan developed by the governments of El Salvador, 
Guatemala, and Honduras.  These programs aim to expand Salvadoran capabilities to interdict, 
investigate, and prosecute illegal drug trafficking and other transnational crimes, implement 
prevention programs, and strengthen El Salvador’s justice sector.  The United States also 
supports anti-gang and community policing in El Salvador with equipment, vehicles, training, 
and social and economic programs.  The United States provided Salvadoran law enforcement the 
ability to use COMPSTAT, a statistical analysis tool that tracks the type and location of crime 
reports to more efficiently allocate law enforcement resources; AFIS, an automated fingerprint 
database; and IBIS, a ballistics database. 
 
In 2018, U.S. assistance focused on enhancing the operational capacity of Salvadoran law 
enforcement agencies to interdict drug shipments and combat money laundering and public 
corruption.  Assistance also promoted transparency, efficiency, and institutional respect for 
human and civil rights within law enforcement agencies and the criminal justice system, 
including efforts to professionalize the PNC and reduce the role of the military in civilian 
policing.  The United States supported efforts to combat transnational criminal organizations, 
particularly the MS-13 and 18th Street gangs, while developing and implementing integrated 
initiatives to disrupt drug trafficking and other criminal activity. 
 
In 2018, U.S. assistance included specialized training for over 1,000 PNC officers in areas such 
as intelligence-led policing, community relations, and complex investigations.  The United States 
also helped strengthen the effectiveness of criminal justice procedures and practices by training 
349 justice sector personnel in asset forfeiture, advanced investigation, and trial skills.  The 
United States also provided technical assistance to increase coordination between justice sector 
agents and institutions; improve criminal investigations using scientific evidence; and build the 
capacity of the police and prosecutor’s offices. 
 
The August 2000 United States-El Salvador bilateral agreement allows U.S. authorities to use the 
El Salvador International Airport as a forward operating location.  It also allows U.S. access to 
ports and other governmental facilities in connection with aerial detection, monitoring, and 
tracking of illicit drug trafficking operations.  El Salvador is a regular participant in the semi-
annual Multilateral Maritime Counter Drug Summits, which bring together maritime counterdrug 
professionals from nearly 25 countries and over 65 international organizations spanning North, 
Central and South America, and Europe. 
 
D.  Conclusion 
  


INCSR 2019 Volume 1  
 
 
 
 
Country Reports 
167 
 
El Salvador maintained its capacity to fight transnational crime in 2018, even as drug traffickers 
continued to shift their maritime routes further from El Salvador’s coast and beyond its territorial 
waters.  Authorities demonstrated increased capacity to lead complex investigations, coordinate 
and share intelligence between agencies and with overseas counterparts, and dismantle organized 
crime structures.  El Salvador still faces formidable challenges, including the political 
uncertainty of the future Attorney General and President following the February 2019 national 
elections.  
 
The successes of 2018 can only be sustained if the Government of El Salvador demonstrates 
continued commitment to crime prevention, security, and rule of law.  Progress in these fields, 
and the emergence of law enforcement actors capable of sharing information and coordinating 
effectively with international partners, likely contributed to the 2018 decline in maritime drug 
trafficking, but continued strengthening of the entire continuum of El Salvador’s criminal justice 
institutions needs to be strengthened to prevent the return of trafficking routes if interdiction 
efforts in neighboring countries continue to advance.  Political will to confront corruption and 
maintain adequate resources for the DAN and Attorney General’s Office, including adequate pay 
and physical protection, remains a challenge, and the corrections system remains overcrowded 
and mismanaged.

Georgia 
 
Georgia’s location along traditional smuggling routes in the Caucuses leaves it vulnerable to 
transnational criminal organizations that continue to traffic opium, heroin, and the main 
precursor chemical used to produce heroin, acetic anhydride.  In April 2018, 15 metric tons of 
acetic anhydride were seized at Georgia’s port of Poti on the Black Sea – one of the largest 
seizures in history.  The chemicals originated in China and were destined for Afghanistan to 
process heroin.  Despite record high opium production in Afghanistan, drug seizures in Georgia 
have declined since 2016.   
 
The Georgian government and non-governmental organizations report substantial drug and 
substance abuse challenges with an estimated 50,000 illicit drug users in the country.  Synthetic 
and “club” drugs remain the most popular, particularly with the younger generation.  April 2018 
police raids on two popular Georgian nightclubs led to riots in Tbilisi.  Thousands protested the 
raids as excessive abuses of authority and urged authorities to introduce less strict drug 
policies.  Georgian authorities expressed concern that this type of citizen response may hinder 
future drug operations for fear of reprisal.  In July 2018, the Constitutional Court of Georgia 
ruled unconstitutional blanket restrictions on marijuana use.  The Constitutional Court also noted 
that imposing responsibility on marijuana use would be reasonable under specific circumstances 
such as threats to third persons, use in educational facilities, use on public transport, and use in 
the presence of juveniles.  There is insufficient evidence to evaluate whether this will affect the 
consumption, sale, and transit of other illicit drugs. 
 
The Government of Georgia actively cooperates with a wide range of actors to combat drug 
trafficking and consumption and to develop comprehensive responses to drug dependency.  
These partners include civil society, academia, the UN Office on Drugs and Crime and other 
international organizations, regional partner states, and the European Union.   
 
The United States continues to support Georgia’s fight against crime and illicit drug use and 
trafficking.  Georgia Minister of Internal Affairs Giorgi Gakharia met with the acting 
administrator of the U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration on July 25, 2018, and both parties 
affirmed their commitment to bilateral relations and combating drug trafficking in Georgia and 
the Caucasus region.

Ghana 
 
Ghana remains a transit and destination point for illicit drugs trafficked from Asia and South 
America to other African nations, Europe, and the United States.  Heroin and controlled 
pharmaceuticals from Asia, as well as cocaine from South America, are smuggled into the 
country for limited local consumption and onward shipment.  Crystal methamphetamine 
produced in clandestine laboratories in Nigeria also transits the country.  Precursor chemicals 
required to produce crystal methamphetamine are believed to be diverted from Ghanaian 
sources.  Cannabis is also produced in substantial quantities within Ghana, primarily for 
domestic use but also trafficked to international markets.  Officials report that the illegal 
importation and abuse of tramadol, a controlled pharmaceutical, is increasingly problematic. 
 
Ghana law enforcement and intelligence agencies have alleged that transnational drug trafficking 
networks operating in the country have links to organized crime and terrorist organizations.  
Preliminary reports indicate that the volume of cocaine and heroin seized by Ghanaian 
authorities in 2018 was slightly less than in previous years, while the volume of seized cannabis 
increased.  However, fragmented data collection and incomplete information sharing make 
accurate figures difficult to obtain. 
 
Ghana’s government continues to push for modifications to its drug control laws.  The Narcotics 
Control Commission Bill, which is pending approval in Parliament, will direct the government to 
treat drug use as a public health issue.  It will also address gaps in interagency coordination and 
enhance the government’s toolset for fighting precursor chemicals.  The legislation would reduce 
the stringent mandatory five-year imprisonment for possession and personal use of illicit drugs.  
The mandatory minimum sentence of 10 years would remain for trafficking. 
 
Ghana maintained a high degree of cooperation with the United States and other international 
partners on drug control issues in 2018.  The United States and Ghana continued successful law 
enforcement cooperation under the U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration’s Sensitive 
Investigative Unit program.  Supported by U.S. funding, the UN Office on Drugs and Crime 
continued to implement a program to provide training and equipment to new drug law 
enforcement units in four regions.  Ghana continues to work productively with international 
partners on law enforcement operations targeting transnational drug trafficking organizations and 
to attend U.S.-sponsored trainings that improve their capabilities.  There is no mutual legal 
assistance treaty between Ghana and the United States, although mutual legal assistance can be 
provided on a reciprocal basis through letters of request.  Extradition between Ghana and the 
United States is governed by the 1931 U.S.-U.K. Extradition Treaty.

Guatemala 
 
A. Introduction 
 
Guatemala is a transit country for precursor chemicals and illicit drugs bound for U.S. markets.  
Well-established criminal networks exploit the country’s strategic location, porous borders, and 
widespread corruption to facilitate drug trafficking through the country.  Although precise 
volumes are difficult to determine, U.S. authorities estimate transnational criminal organizations 
smuggled more than 1,400 metric tons (MT) of cocaine through Guatemala during 2018 by air, 
land, and sea.  While the bulk of cocaine arrives directly from South America via maritime 
conveyances, noncommercial air and overland smuggling from Panama, Costa Rica, Nicaragua, 
El Salvador, and Honduras remain persistent threats.  Mexican cartels rely on Guatemalan 
networks and organizations to receive, store, and transport drugs to the United States through 
Mexico.   
 
In addition to trafficking illicit drugs and precursor chemicals through Guatemala, criminal 
organizations cultivate cannabis and opium poppy within the country, and coca cultivation was 
detected for the first time in 2018.  The absence of a permanent law enforcement presence in 
many areas of the country allows other forms of transnational crime, including alien smuggling 
and trafficking in persons, weapons, counterfeit goods, and other contraband, to flourish. 
 
Ongoing political crises and high turnover of key government officials present challenges to U.S. 
cooperation on security and countering drug trafficking.  Key Guatemalan government drug 
control officials lack the necessary political will to effectively counter drug trafficking and 
corruption.  While Guatemala achieved some notable successes in 2018, including high levels of 
drug seizures and a number of extraditions of criminals charged with drug offenses in the United 
States, Guatemala’s fight against criminal organizations continues to be hindered by endemic 
corruption, weak public institutions, and inadequate resources. 
 
U.S. assistance helped establish 99 Model Police Precincts (MPP) throughout Guatemala.  In 
2018, these locations improved citizen security and the relationships between police and the 
communities they serve.  A decline in homicides and other violent crimes, noted since 2009, 
continues, and local police are embracing community-policing methods.  MPPs support broader 
drug control efforts by facilitating positive interaction with police and improving communities’ 
trust in and willingness to work with police, thereby making communities more resilient to crime 
including crime with a nexus to drug trafficking, distribution, and drug use.     
   
B. Drug Control Accomplishments, Policies, and Trends 
 
1. Institutional Development 
 
High volumes of cocaine are trafficked into Guatemala along its Pacific Coast, although trends 
suggest much of the flow moved offshore in favor of direct routes from Colombia to Mexico for 
much of 2018.  The Guatemalan Special Naval Forces (FEN) has been successful in disrupting 
maritime networks, pushing maritime trafficking further west, and 2018 was another record year 
in seizures.  The FEN continues to face myriad maritime threats and trafficking challenges, 


INCSR 2019 Volume 1  
 
 
 
 
Country Reports 
171 
 
including the use of semi-submersible and low-profile vessels; small “pangas” boats; parasitic 
devices attached to larger ships; and an increase in “go-fast” vessels that are faster and hold 
larger shipments than pangas.  In response to FEN pressure at sea, traffickers increasingly turned 
to aerial conveyance in 2018, with considerable success. 
 
Guatemala lacks the capacity to intercept inbound aircraft suspected of trafficking drugs, and 
trafficking organizations are easily capable of shifting landing locations as necessary.  The 
Guatemalan Air Force plays a critical role in detecting and monitoring aircraft suspected of 
trafficking illicit drugs in and out of Guatemala, but lacks capacity, including rotary wing assets.  
Guatemalan interdiction efforts resulted in the seizure of a single air-delivered cocaine load in 
2018 (on the ground) and the seizure of several aircraft, including some hidden by traffickers in 
remote locations.  Guatemalan agencies only disabled two suspected clandestine airfields in 
2018, and one of those returned to operational use within two weeks.  Traffickers will likely 
continue to exploit Guatemala’s capacity gaps in this sector.   
 
U.S. assistance to Guatemala in the areas of vetted units, information sharing, and training led to 
better coordination and drug seizures in 2018.  U.S. support to the border police (DIPAFRONT) 
enabled the addition of 100 agents to its force, now totaling 530, and the agency implemented 
successful binational operations with Mexico, Honduras, and El Salvador in 2018.  Challenges 
still remain, including lack of infrastructure, equipment, supplies, and personnel.  Guatemalan 
and U.S. law enforcement experts have estimated that 2,500 DIPAFRONT agents are needed to 
effectively patrol Guatemala’s borders. 
  
Guatemala is a party to several relevant regional agreements, including the Organization of 
American States’ Inter-American Drug Abuse Control Commission, the Caribbean Regional 
Agreement on Maritime Counter Narcotics, and the Inter-American Convention on Mutual 
Assistance in Criminal Matters.  A maritime drug control agreement with the United States is 
fully implemented. 
 
Guatemala continues to work closely with U.S. authorities on extradition matters and regularly 
extradites its own citizens, including high-level drug traffickers, to the United States for 
prosecution. 
 
2. Supply Reduction 
 
In May 2018, nearly 75,000 coca plants were discovered by Guatemalan authorities on one 
hectare (ha) of land in the municipality of Cobán.  This was the first known identification of coca 
cultivation within Guatemala, and the plants were subsequently destroyed.  
 
The Guatemalan government continues to struggle with estimating the number of ha under 
opium poppy cultivation in the San Marcos region, close to the border with Mexico.  Guatemalan 
government authorities do not have an accurate estimate, and limited government presence and 
operations since the state of emergency in 2017 have reduced visibility into the current situation.  
While government authorities have informally claimed there is less poppy cultivation due to 
declining prices, there is no independent confirmation of these claims.  High turnover in 
Guatemalan agencies led to the cancelation and/or delay of multiple eradication missions in 


INCSR 2019 Volume 1  
 
 
 
 
Country Reports 
172 
 
2018, and budgeted alternative development projects planned for San Marcos were not 
implemented by the Ministry of Agriculture.   
 
Seizures increased each year since 2016 despite insufficient interdiction resources.  During the 
first 10 months of 2018, Guatemalan authorities reported seizing approximately 13.96 MT of 
cocaine, surpassing the total amount seized during all of 2017.  During this same period, 
Guatemalan agencies reported confiscating seven kilograms of heroin, more than $3.6 million in 
bulk cash, and eradicating approximately 80 ha of opium poppy and 40 ha of cannabis.   
 
Arrests of high-profile traffickers were down in 2018 to 53, approximately half the number 
arrested in 2017. 
 
3.    Public Information, Prevention, and Treatment 
 
A U.S.-funded national drug-use survey released in 2014 remains the most recent.  That survey 
reported young people aged 11 to 20 used marijuana and cocaine at higher rates than their 
counterparts in Mexico, Colombia, and Costa Rica.  It also identified specific risk factors for 
Guatemalan adolescents, including easy access to illicit drugs, as well as low risk perception 
associated with the use of marijuana, cocaine, and MDMA (ecstasy).  Since the government 
lacks sufficient resources to address these emerging trends, a U.S. government grant helped 
reach over 19,000 students and promote drug abuse awareness and prevention among municipal 
leaders, teachers, students, parents, and the private sector. 
  
The Ministry of Health administers drug treatment centers in Guatemala, but the agency has not 
provided updated statistics on treatment centers.  A 2016 U.S.-funded study of 30 of the 
country’s 100 treatment centers concluded the majority of drug treatment providers, directors, 
and counselors lack expertise to meet the needs of patients.  Most centers lack basic equipment 
and do not apply a formal therapeutic model to drug treatment.  
 
Guatemalan authorities are concerned about internal drug use and have provided additional 
resources to fight it, but resources remain insufficient.  There is some evidence that criminal 
organizations are attempting to create demand for illicit drugs in Guatemala to generate new 
markets.  The coca plantation discovered in May, for example, appeared designed to meet 
internal consumption demands. 
 
4. Corruption 
 
The Guatemalan government does not, as a matter of policy, encourage or facilitate illegal drug 
production or distribution, nor is it involved in the laundering of the sale of illicit drug proceeds.  
However, corruption permeates public and private institutions and exacerbates the country’s 
security, governance, and economic challenges.  Guatemala’s Attorney General and the UN-
backed International Commission Against Impunity in Guatemala (CICIG) have investigated 
hundreds of government officials suspected of corruption.  U.S. assistance also supports 
anticorruption efforts by developing and training specialized vetted units, particularly those 
tasked with countering drug trafficking, money laundering, and criminal gangs.

Accomplishments in the broader fight against corruption in 2018 included several high profile 
corruption cases resulting in convictions, including former Vice President Roxana Baldetti.  She 
was convicted in the first of several corruption cases and sentenced to more than 15 years in 
prison.  Former Minister of Government, Mauricio Lopez-Bonilla, was also convicted and 
received a sentence of more than eight years.  U.S. officials assisted efforts to build capacity for 
police and prosecutorial units that apply enhanced special investigative methods.  As a result of 
investigations, several asset forfeiture cases allowed Guatemala to recover more than $4.5 
million, along with more than 100 assets, such as vehicles, airplanes, boats, real property, and 
equipment.  The seized property will be sold or donated to state institutions and help strengthen 
state institutions involved in the fight against corruption.  Unfortunately, the government’s 
expulsion of CICIG from Guatemala calls into question its commitment to fight entrenched 
corruption.    
 
C. National Goals, Bilateral Cooperation, and U.S. Policy Initiatives 
 
Consistent with the U.S. Strategy for Central America and the Central America Regional 
Security Initiative (CARSI), and in support of the Central American governments’ Alliance for 
Prosperity, the United States continues to be a key provider of assistance to improve the 
professional capabilities and integrity of Guatemala’s security and judicial institutions to create 
sustainable, effective structures and organizations to fight illicit drug production and trafficking. 
 
The United States maintains a bilateral agreement with Guatemala to suppress illicit traffic by 
sea and air, which includes provisions for ship boarding, shipriders, pursuit, entry to investigate, 
over flight of territorial seas, order to land, and interdiction support.  Guatemala also participates 
in the semi-annual Multilateral Maritime Counter Drug Summit, which attracts counterdrug 
professionals from nearly 25 countries and over 65 international agencies spanning North, 
Central, and South America, as well as Europe.   
 
D. Conclusion 
 
Guatemala made progress in the fight against criminal organizations in 2018, including enhanced 
institutional capacity, improved interagency and regional cooperation, and record interdictions.  
Significant challenges remain, including high turnover of government officials in key law 
enforcement roles and lack of political will in key areas.  Corruption levels remain high, and, 
according to U.S. government-funded studies, public confidence in government institutions is 
low.  Following the government’s actions against CICIG, there is growing concern about high-
level Guatemalan commitment to the fight against corruption and impunity.  Limited budget 
resources hinder the government’s effectiveness and ability to address the challenges associated 
with drug trafficking.  The Guatemalan government needs to work to build sustainable 
counterdrug mechanisms, including accelerated judicial processes, improved interagency 
cooperation, and provide adequate financial support and personnel to relevant agencies and 
government ministries.

Guyana 
 
A.  Introduction  
 
Guyana is a transit country for cocaine destined for the United States, Canada, the Caribbean, 
Europe, and West Africa.  Cocaine originating in Colombia is smuggled to Venezuela and 
onward to Guyana by sea or air.  Smugglers also transit land borders and the shared river 
network with Brazil, Venezuela, and Suriname.  Cocaine is concealed in legitimate commodities 
and smuggled through commercial and private air transport, maritime vessels, human couriers, 
“go-fast” boats, and various postal systems. 
 
Drug traffickers are attracted by the country’s poorly monitored ports, remote airstrips, intricate 
river networks, porous land borders, as well as corruption and under-resourced security sector.  
Despite these challenges, the Government of Guyana has demonstrated political will to combat 
the trafficking of illicit drugs in and through Guyana. 
 
B.  Drug Control Accomplishments, Policies, and Trends  
 
 
1.  Institutional Development 
 
The Government of Guyana’s drug control institutions are the Guyana Police Force, Guyana 
Revenue Authority, Customs Anti-Narcotics Unit, Special Organized Crime Unit, and Guyana 
Defence Force.  These agencies are responsible for the implementation of the National Drug 
Strategy Master Plan 2016-2020, and the National Anti-Narcotics Agency oversees these efforts.  
Despite this coordination mechanism, corruption and limited resources have historically limited 
the effectiveness of these drug control agencies. 
 
In February 2018, the Government of Guyana passed the Witness Protection Act and the 
Protected Disclosures Act to complement its existing legislative regime addressing corruption 
and drug trafficking.    
 
In 2008, Guyana acceded to and has since filed information requests under the Inter-American 
Convention on Mutual Assistance in Criminal Matters, to which the United States is also a party.  
Guyana has bilateral drug control agreements with its neighbors and the United Kingdom.  
Guyana is also a member of the Organization of American States’ Inter-American Drug Abuse 
Control Commission (OAS/CICAD).  Guyana signed a maritime drug control bilateral 
agreement with the United States in 2001, but has yet to take the necessary domestic action to 
bring the agreement into effect.  The 1931 Extradition Treaty between the United States and the 
United Kingdom is applicable to the United States and Guyana, and Guyana honors that treaty. 
 
 
2.  Supply Reduction  
 
The Government of Guyana’s National Drug Abuse Control Unit trains public health officers, 
teachers, social workers, and civil society groups as part of the government’s supply reduction 
strategy.  The Guyanese government has a drug enforcement presence at its international 
airports, post offices, and, to a lesser extent, at seaport and land-border entry points.  Drug

control agencies reported several interdiction efforts and drug-related seizures and convictions 
during the first nine months of 2018.  During the first nine months of 2018, authorities seized 
164.9 kilograms (kg) of cocaine and 889 kg of cannabis.  Guyanese authorities initiated 358 
prosecutions and convicted 24 individuals for drug trafficking. 
 
 
3.  Public Information, Prevention, and Treatment 
 
Guyana has a growing domestic drug consumption problem.  Marijuana is the most widely used 
illicit drug in Guyana, followed by cocaine.  The Guyanese government has also reported seizing 
smaller amounts of synthetic drugs, including MDMA (ecstasy).  Guyana has a comprehensive 
demand reduction strategy that adequately addresses drug rehabilitation.  The Ministry of Public 
Health, Ministry of Education, and Ministry of Social Protection are responsible for addressing 
demand reduction.  Non-governmental organizations also offer rehabilitation services, with the 
government providing financial assistance.  The Georgetown Public Hospital also provides free 
rehabilitation services for drug users.  The University of Guyana has a demand reduction 
curriculum in place through OAS/CICAD funding.  The Government of Guyana conducts anti-
drug awareness sessions in secondary schools and has plans to create drug treatment courts.  As 
part of the Caribbean Basin Security Initiative (CBSI), the United States supports Guyana 
through targeted training for law enforcement and maritime officers.    
 
 
4.  Corruption  
 
As a matter of policy, the Government of Guyana does not encourage or facilitate the illicit 
production or distribution of narcotics or psychotropic drugs or other controlled substances or the 
laundering of proceeds from illegal drug transactions.  However, a lack of resources, weak law 
enforcement institutions, an ineffective judicial system, and inadequate compensation for civil 
service employees and public safety officials facilitate corruption throughout all sectors.        
 
C.  National Goals, Bilateral Cooperation, and U.S. Policy Initiatives 
 
The United States supports a wide range of efforts designed to address crime and violence 
affecting Guyanese citizens, primarily through the Caribbean Basin Security Initiative (CBSI).  
CBSI is a security partnership between the United States and Caribbean countries that seeks to 
substantially reduce illicit trafficking, advance public safety and citizen security, and promote 
justice.  Efforts to increase law enforcement capabilities, protect borders, air and seaports, 
strengthen workforce development, and promote anti-money laundering effectiveness directly 
address priority concerns shared by Guyana and the United States. 
 
The Government of Guyana cooperates very closely with all relevant U.S. agencies and 
departments, but is limited by resource constraints.  The current administration, which took 
office in May 2015, has expressed a strong willingness to cooperate with the United States on 
drug control, extradition, mutual legal assistance, and other international crime issues. 
 
CBSI-funded programs support Guyana’s maritime operations by providing interdiction assets, 
relevant command and control systems, and associated logistical support and training.  In 2018, 
the United States provided port and maritime training to Guyana’s Coast Guard.  U.S. assistance

programs also promote law enforcement professionalization and more effective drug 
investigations.  By strengthening Guyana’s drug control capacities, the United States seeks to 
enhance interagency coordination within the Guyanese government including to gather better 
information on drug trafficking routes. 
 
D.  Conclusion 
 
The United States enjoys strong cooperation with Guyana in advancing mutual interests against 
the threat of international drug trafficking.  Guyana has shown strong interest in furthering 
collaboration under CBSI.  The United States looks forward to tangible progress on 
investigations, prosecutions, and extraditions; expanding security sector capacity; engaging at-
risk communities; and enforcing laws against money laundering and financial crimes.  To 
advance cooperation, Guyana should take steps to implement the 2001 counterdrug bilateral 
agreement with the United States to suppress illicit trafficking by sea and air.  Guyana should 
seek to enhance its anti-corruption initiatives and fully pursue prosecutions for drug trafficking 
in accordance with its laws.

Haiti 
 
A.  Introduction 
 
Haiti remains a transit point for cocaine originating in South America and marijuana originating 
in Jamaica, traversing the country’s porous borders en route to the United States and other 
markets.  This traffic takes advantage of Haiti’s severely under-patrolled maritime borders and 
its extensive land border with the Dominican Republic.  Haiti’s main drug enforcement unit, Le 
Bureau de Lutte Contre le trafic de Stupèfiants (Bureau for the Fight Against Narcotics, or 
BLTS) led several successful investigations and joint interdiction operations against drug 
trafficking organizations along the southern coast in 2018.  Haiti is not a significant producer of 
illicit drugs for export, although there is cultivation of cannabis for local consumption.  Haiti’s 
primarily subsistence-level economy does not provide an environment conducive to high levels 
of domestic drug use. 
 
In 2018, the Haitian National Police (HNP) strengthened the BLTS with additional officers, and 
officials at the highest levels of the government have spoken about the need to fight drug 
trafficking.  However, seizures of illicit drugs and smuggled cash declined and the government is 
unable to secure the country’s borders to stem the flow of illicit drugs.  The HNP and the Haitian 
government have recently begun to address the uncontrolled border crossings with the formation 
of a border police unit (POLIFRONT), based in Morne Casse, near the Ouanaminthe border 
crossing with the Dominican Republic in Haiti’s Northeast Department.  POLIFRONT plans to 
expand to border crossing points at Anse-a-Pitre, Malpasse, and Belladere.  The minimal 
maritime interdiction capacity of the Haitian Coast Guard (HCG) creates a low-risk environment 
for drug traffickers.  While Haiti’s interdiction capacity has improved marginally, a largely 
ineffective judicial system continues to impede successful prosecution of apprehended drug 
traffickers. 
 
B.  Drug Control Accomplishments, Policies, and Trends  
 
1. Institutional Development 
 
The HNP’s 28th Promotion Class graduated 1,022 recruits, including 117 women, in December 
2017.  The 29th HNP class of 692 recruits graduated in September 2018, bringing the total 
number of HNP officers to nearly 16,000.  A larger force will help the HNP assume increasing 
responsibility for security as the UN Mission for Justice Support in Haiti starts to drawdown by 
October 2019. 
 
The BLTS focuses on interdicting illicit drug trafficking.  In 2018, the HNP deployed BLTS 
officers to Terrier Rouge and Ouanaminthe.  The BLTS also plans to add officers in Jacmel in 
the Southeast Department, as well as in Anse-a-Pitres.  The United States continues to provide 
training to the Maritime Counter Narcotics Task Force, made up of BLTS and HCG officers.  In 
April, the United States finished installing a modular unit at the Cap Haitien seaport for BLTS 
officers to use as an operational base. 
  


INCSR 2019 Volume 1  
 
 
 
 
Country Reports 
178 
 
The HNP’s Office of the Inspector General (OIG) investigates reports of officer misconduct, 
including participation in drug trafficking.  The HNP still faces challenges regulating its internal 
affairs, particularly in more remote areas in Haiti.  The OIG recommended officers for discipline 
for various offenses in 2018, but most of its recommendations have thus far gone unmet.  The 
HNP held monthly press conferences to inform the public of their roles and responsibilities, and 
to report cases of misconduct.  The OIG maintains a 24-hour hotline to receive public reports of 
police corruption or misconduct.  As of August 2018, the OIG had recommended 23 officers for 
dismissal, compared with 11 such recommendations in 2017. 
  
The HCG is the sole maritime enforcement agency in the country.  An additional 42 officers 
from the 29th HNP promotion class joined the HCG, bringing the overall size of the unit to 204 
officers.  The HCG has operating bases in Cap Haitien, Killick (Port-au-Prince), and Les 
Cayes.  The force has 15 maritime vessels, but only five are currently operational, with seven of 
the remaining 10 vessels non-repairable due to age.  Maritime domain awareness and 
enforcement are daunting tasks for the HCG, considering Haiti’s 1,100 miles of coastline and 
seven international ports.  Operational capacity remains low due to insufficient funding, 
management deficiencies, an inability to refuel, and unavailability of locally procured parts to 
maintain the vessels.  These issues have prevented the HCG from serving as an effective 
deterrent force to maritime drug trafficking.   
  
Haiti maintains several international agreements on drug control commitments and often 
cooperates effectively with the United States on drug-related cases.  A 1997 bilateral letter of 
agreement on Cooperation to Suppress Illicit Maritime Drug Traffic allows U.S. law 
enforcement agencies to enter Haitian territorial waters and airspace in pursuit of suspect vessels 
or aircraft, to board and search suspect vessels, to patrol Haitian airspace, and to carry members 
of the HCG as passengers.  Although there is no mutual legal assistance treaty between Haiti and 
the United States, the Haitian government has cooperated on many cases within the limits of 
Haitian law.  A bilateral extradition treaty entered into force in 1905, and the Government of 
Haiti has willingly surrendered persons under indictment in the United States to U.S. law 
enforcement agencies. 
 
2. Supply Reduction 
 
During the first 10 months of 2018, BLTS executed several operations that resulted in the seizure 
of 371 kilograms (kg) of marijuana and 28 kg of cocaine.  In addition, the HNP arrested 76 
suspects for drug-related crimes during this period.  There is no significant availability or traffic 
of illicit synthetic drugs in Haiti. 
 
3. Public Information, Prevention, and Treatment 
 
Illicit drug abuse is uncommon in Haiti, as the population’s minimal discretionary income 
mitigates against a widespread drug abuse problem.  The Government of Haiti runs small-scale 
public awareness and demand reduction programs funded through the drug control policy 
commission (CONALD), but there is no data on these programs’ impact or usefulness. 
 
4. Corruption 


INCSR 2019 Volume 1  
 
 
 
 
Country Reports 
179 
 
 
The Haitian government as an institution does not encourage or facilitate illegal activity 
associated with drug trafficking, or the laundering of proceeds from illicit drug 
transactions.  However, effective government action to fight corruption, particularly related to 
illicit drugs, is constrained by two major factors coupled with a lack of political will.  The first is 
a historically weak legal framework.  Haiti did not codify corruption as a crime until 2014, when 
a law formally criminalized public corruption and set penalties for bribery and illegal 
procurement.  Implementation of this law, including training of judicial personnel on the law’s 
requirements, remains a challenge.  Haiti’s asset seizure laws have enabled the financial 
intelligence unit (Central Unit of Financial Investigations) and the HNP’s financial crimes unit 
(Financial and Economic Affairs Bureau) to seize the assets of drug traffickers convicted outside 
of Haiti.  The Haitian constitution’s grant of blanket immunity from prosecution to Members of 
Parliament is a point of concern for anticorruption and drug enforcement efforts. 
 
The second constraining factor is systematically poor judicial performance, due to antiquated 
penal and criminal procedural codes, opaque court proceedings, lack of judicial oversight, and 
widespread judicial corruption.  To date, there have been five successful convictions for drug 
trafficking, and only one conviction on corruption-related charges in Haitian courts.  The Haitian 
Anti-Corruption Unit has advanced 32 corruption-related cases to the judiciary since its inception 
in 2005, but without tangible results. 
 
C.  National Goals, Bilateral Cooperation, and U.S. Policy Initiatives 
 
U.S. drug control initiatives in Haiti focus on improving the capacity of the HNP, BLTS, and the 
HCG to detect, investigate, and deter the flow of illicit drugs.  A 2004 letter of agreement (as 
amended) between the United States and Haiti and a second agreement signed in 2013 (amended 
annually) govern these activities.  Core goals outlined in the agreements are to increase overall 
counter-drug capabilities, interdict drug shipments, and develop cases against traffickers and 
criminal organizations.  Since 2012, five drug-related arrests have led to trials and convictions.   
  
U.S. assistance supports the development of the HNP and the targeted support of BLTS via 
complementary programs.  Support to the HNP covers a broad range of activities, including 
infrastructure, equipment, and training.  Improved operational capacity and professionalism of 
the HNP are necessary for effective drug enforcement activity in Haiti.  
  
Specific U.S. support to the BLTS includes provision of communications equipment, vehicles, 
non-lethal operational gear, canine and maritime units, and training.  U.S. support also includes 
training opportunities for BLTS officers in the United States and in third countries, such as at the 
U.S.-supported International Law Enforcement Academy (ILEA) in El Salvador.  The United 
States also supports the HNP’s Joint Maritime Counternarcotics Task Force through joint 
enforcement operations between the U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration, the U.S. Coast 
Guard, the HCG, and the BLTS.  
  
The United States will continue to support training of high-ranking HNP officials in the United 
States, including in cooperation with various U.S. law enforcement agencies, to develop leaders 
that can serve as change agents within the HNP.

D.  Conclusion 
 
The continued institutional development of both the HNP and BLTS is a positive trend that has 
helped improve public security and has marginally increased Haiti’s capacity to interdict drug 
trafficking.  However, the dysfunctional Haitian judicial system drastically limits domestic 
prosecution of drug cases and thus reduces disincentives to trafficking operations.  Drug seizures 
remain low, and Haiti’s minimal capacity to police its sea and land borders continues to be a 
particular point of concern.   
 
Continued U.S. engagement in support of BLTS operations and general HNP development will 
help Haitian law enforcement capitalize on marginal gains in drug interdiction capacity.  The 
benefits of such gains will be limited, however, if the judicial system remains weak, corrupt, and 
fails to convict drug traffickers.  Only the concurrent strengthening of political will, the 
judiciary, law enforcement, and border security will enable Haiti to make real progress in 
combating drug trafficking.

Honduras 
 
A.  Introduction 
 
Honduras is a transit country for cocaine destined for the United States and precursor chemicals 
used to produce illicit drugs.  The Caribbean Coast of Honduras is vulnerable to drug trafficking 
by land, sea, and air due to its remoteness, limited infrastructure, and lack of government 
presence.  Drug trafficking organizations are shifting their strategy to take advantage of these 
vulnerabilities by sending smaller shipments by fast boat or small airplane, making detection and 
interdiction increasingly challenging for Honduran authorities. 
 
Despite advances, the overall security situation in Honduras remains challenging.  While the 
homicide rate continues to drop, the overall crime rate remains high especially where elevated 
levels of criminal activity make it difficult for the under-resourced Honduras National Police 
(HNP) to operate.  Transnational criminal street gangs, such as Mara Salvatrucha (MS-13) and 
18th Street, are not a significant part of the international drug logistics chain, except as 
facilitators of shipments through Honduras and small-scale local distributors. 
 
The restructuring of the HNP, improvements in investigative and operational training for both 
the police and Public Ministry (PM), and the use of interagency task forces to strike against 
traffickers increased the interoperability of government entities to counter drug trafficking.  Drug 
seizures by the HNP in 2018 surpassed 2017 levels.  The Honduran government initiated a purge 
of the HNP in 2016 to remove corrupt or otherwise unqualified officers from duty; 5,218 HNP 
officers have been removed from duty as of November 1, 2018.  The HNP’s lack of strong, mid-
level management following the police purge along with a dearth of officers with significant 
counterdrug experience has hampered the force from staying ahead of evolving drug smuggling 
threats.  However, the Government of Honduras continues its efforts to develop capacity to 
counter drug trafficking, and to increase seizures and disrupt criminal networks. 
 
B.  Drug Control Accomplishments, Policies, and Trends 
 
1. Institutional Development 
 
The political will of the Honduran government to combat drug trafficking and to coordinate with 
U.S. law enforcement agencies in doing so remains high.  Challenges for drug control 
institutions include corruption, inadequate budget resources, and persistent violence.  Corruption, 
combined with low tax collection rates, deprives law enforcement agencies, courts, and 
prosecutors of critical resources.  The security tax, instituted in 2014 to offset funding challenges 
for security agencies, helped key law enforcement institutions somewhat, but funds are 
inadequate to meet the significant personnel, equipment, and technology needs required to 
address drug trafficking in Honduras.   
 
U.S. assistance to Honduras in the areas of vetted police units, interagency task forces, criminal 
justice capacity building, information sharing, and training provided a foundation for 
government institutions to coordinate their efforts in the fight against the trafficking of illicit 
drugs.  During 2018, the Government of Honduras emphasized interagency operations focused 


INCSR 2019 Volume 1  
 
 
 
 
Country Reports

on specific geographic areas experiencing spikes in criminal activity.  These operations have 
resulted in a high number of arrests, arms seizures, and significant marijuana seizures, but have 
not yielded notable cocaine seizures or disruptions to drug trafficking organizations.  The HNP 
Special Forces Directorate’s elite unit, the TIGRES, has been instrumental in providing the 
tactical, operational support required for these operations. 
 
The HNP Antinarcotics Directorate (DNPA), created in 2018, began tactical operations in 
September with support from other HNP Directorates.  The DNPA faces various challenges 
associated with being a new police directorate.  As of October, the DNPA had 135 personnel, the 
bulk of whom are recent police academy graduates or officers with limited experience in drug 
operations.  DNPA does not have an established headquarters, so personnel and leadership work 
from various locations.  In January 2018, the HNP moved the Financial Crimes Task Force 
(OPIF) from the Directorate of Police Investigations to the DNPA to address the financial 
aspects of drug investigations.  The U.S. government provides advisory support to the DNPA in 
the areas of organizational development, inter-directorate information sharing, operational 
planning, and financial investigations.  
 
The U.S.-supported HNP Criminal Investigation School (EIC) provides coursework on the 
classification of illicit drugs, pharmacology, clandestine laboratories, chemical precursors, and 
trafficking methods, and incorporates drug control topics in all other courses offered.  The HNP 
remains committed to utilizing continuing education as a means to professionalize their force 
generally, but also as a way to improve the investigative capacity of the force to counter drug 
trafficking.  The Honduran National Congress increased the EIC budget from approximately 
$20,000 in 2016 to $1.3 million in 2018.  The Government of Honduras is also investing, with 
support from U.S. and international donors, in a specialized training academy that will include a 
dedicated school for counterdrug training. 
 
Honduras is party to several regional agreements that focus on drug trafficking, including the 
Organization of American States’ Inter-American Drug Abuse Control Commission and the 
Caribbean Regional Agreement on Maritime Counternarcotics.  Honduras has ratified the Inter-
American Convention on Mutual Assistance in Criminal Matters. 
 
 
2.  Supply Reduction 
 
The willingness of civilian and military entities to combat illicit drug trafficking and steps taken 
by the Government of Honduras over previous years to create new drug control entities has not 
yet translated into significant increases in drug seizures or notable disruptions to drug trafficking 
organizations.  Drug trafficking organizations, recognizing the improved capabilities of 
Honduran security forces, have begun moving drug shipments in smaller amounts to avoid 
detection and interdiction by Honduran authorities.  While seizures by Honduran authorities in 
their territorial and maritime domain are down, there is no concrete information to suggest the 
overall volume of illicit drugs being trafficked through Honduras has decreased.  During the first 
nine months of 2018, there was a threefold increase in seizures of cocaine transiting Honduras 
according to U.S. government data, seized mostly by non–Honduran authorities in territories 
outside of Honduras.  In contrast to this assessment, in September, the Ministry of Defense 
claimed that Honduras achieved a 50 percent reduction in the volume of drugs transiting 


INCSR 2019 Volume 1  
 
 
 
 
Country Reports 
183 
 
Honduras, and destroyed nearly 50 clandestine airstrips.  The U.S. government is still working to 
corroborate this information. 
 
The Honduran Navy made efforts during 2018 to modernize its surface fleet and initiated the 
purchase of new vessels, but has not made a commensurate increase in operational budget and it 
is uncertain when the vessels will become an active part of the fleet.  Fuel availability is a 
significant limitation for the Honduran Navy to interdict suspected drug trafficking vessels, as 
these ships often operate at long distances from the Navy’s control nodes and current fuel 
budgets are miniscule compared to the need.   
 
The military controls wiretapping facilities and access to wiretapping results for civilian law 
enforcement remains inadequate, resulting in a significant loss of actionable intelligence for 
interdictions that could occur on land.  The U.S. government is working with the Ministry of 
Security to gain additional access to the wiretapping facilities to assist in the development of 
intelligence for drug control entities.   
 
The Ministry of Defense stated an interest in increasing information sharing with the United 
States on both licit and illicit maritime activities.  Furthermore, the U.S. government began 
discussions in 2018 with the Ministry of Defense to train and outfit a Maritime Interdiction Unit 
(Fuerzas Especiales Navales) to be modeled after a similar U.S.-supported unit in Guatemala.  
The current aerial interdiction law in Honduras prevents the United States from sharing radar or 
other information related to illicit trafficking by air.  The Honduran government does not 
currently have the capacity to track all suspected drug trafficking flights into or out of 
clandestine airstrips without outside support.  
 
The analytic capabilities of the Merchant Marine (DGMM) Department of Analysis and 
Maritime Control, created in 2016, continue to improve and support the fight against drug 
trafficking.  The Honduran Navy and the U.S. authorities receive the majority of DGMM’s 
intelligence, but the Honduran Navy is limited in its ability to make patrols based on this 
information because of resource constraints.  Poor port security, inadequate container inspection 
protocols, and complicated interagency procedures limit the ability of Honduran authorities to 
act on DGMM’s information on suspect vessels or containers in port.   
 
 
3.  Public Information, Prevention, and Treatment 
 
The primary focus of the Honduran government remains on improving security and economic 
conditions in Honduras.  Public information on drug use is insufficient.  Prevention and 
treatment programs are limited in both scope and geography.  The National Directorate of 
Investigation and Intelligence released a report in August 2018 identifying data collection on 
drug use as a critical gap that inhibits an appropriate approach to drug use prevention and 
treatment.  The DNPA’s Prevention Department is staffed by only two individuals, neither of 
whom have formal training in drug use prevention.  
 
The United States supports comprehensive, balanced, and coordinated approaches to increase the 
capacity of the Government of Honduras to address and counter the demand for illegal drugs.  
Assistance included support to the Gang Resistance Education and Training (GREAT) Program,

estimated to have reached 100,000 students in 2018.  Other U.S.-supported grants provided 
support to host country institutions that deal with drug treatment and prevention in the highest 
risk areas of Honduras.  
 
 
4.  Corruption 
 
The Government of Honduras does not, as a matter of government policy, encourage or facilitate 
illicit drug production or distribution, nor is it involved in laundering the proceeds of the sale of 
illicit drugs.  However, corruption remains widespread in public institutions.  The Special 
Commission for the Purging and Restructuring of the HNP completed its original mission to 
expel corrupt police officers from the force in 2017 and is slated to disband in January 2019.  
The HNP continues to hire new police officers to achieve its target of 26,000 by 2022, and as of 
October 2018 numbered about 18,500 officers.  
 
In April 2018, the OAS Mission to Support the Fight Against Corruption and Impunity in 
Honduras (MACCIH) completed two years of operations.  The Honduran anticorruption court 
and the PM’s Anti-Corruption Unit (UFECIC), stood up with the support of MACCIH, began to 
investigate and try high-level corruption cases.  Since late 2017, MACCIH has launched several 
large-scale corruption cases, including against current and former public officials.  An UFECIC 
and MACCIH investigation against former First Lady Rosa Elena Bonilla de Lobo for alleged 
misuse of public funds, fraud, and money laundering, led to her arrest in February 2018.  In June, 
UFECIC, in conjunction with MACCIH investigators, announced the Pandora Case.  The case 
accuses 38 individuals, including a former Secretary of Agriculture and several Congresspersons, 
of acts of fraud, money laundering, falsifying documents, and abuse of authority.  MACCIH 
continues to pursue a legislative agenda to strengthen anticorruption laws and reduce impunity.     
 
C.  National Goals, Bilateral Cooperation, and U.S. Policy Initiatives 
 
The United States provides assistance through the Central America Regional Security Initiative 
(CARSI) to improve the professional capabilities of Honduran justice sector institutions, 
consistent with the U.S. Strategy for Engagement in Central America, and the Central American 
governments’ Alliance for Prosperity Initiative.  The overall objective of U.S. assistance is to 
reinforce Honduran security and justice sector institutions so they can account for their nation’s 
security, stability, and prosperity.   
 
The U.S. government provides advisory and logistical support along with equipment to various 
HNP directorates, the PM, and the military to improve host country capacities to investigate and 
disrupt drug trafficking in Honduras.  Specifically, the United States trains and equips HNP 
special units such as the Violent Crimes Task Force, the National Anti-Kidnapping Unit, the 
TIGRES, and the Special Tactical Operations Group (GOET).  U.S. assistance to community 
policing efforts continued during 2018 and an additional seven Model Police Precincts (MPPs) 
were established.  These MPPs support broader drug control efforts by facilitating positive 
interaction with police and improving communities’ trust in and willingness to work with police, 
thereby making communities more resilient to crime including crime with a nexus to drug 
trafficking, distribution, and use.   U.S.-supported HNP vetted units include the Transnational 


INCSR 2019 Volume 1  
 
 
 
 
Country Reports 
185 
 
Anti-Gang Unit, the Sensitive Investigations Unit, and the Transnational Criminal Investigative 
Unit, which address drug trafficking and other transnational crime.     
 
The United States maintains a bilateral agreement with Honduras to suppress illicit traffic by sea, 
which includes provisions for shipboarding, shipriders, pursuit, entry to investigate, overflight, 
order to land and for the use of third-party platforms.  Honduras is a regular participant in the 
semi-annual Multilateral Maritime Counter Drug Summits, which bring together counterdrug 
professionals from nearly 25 countries and over 65 international organizations spanning North, 
Central and South America, and Europe. 
 
D.  Conclusion 
 
The United States works closely with Honduran authorities to improve the host government’s 
capacity to provide security and justice to its citizens and combat drug trafficking.  In 2018, 
Honduras made progress in improving investigative capacity and the interoperability of security 
forces to fight criminal organizations but was not able to translate these improvements into 
notable disruptions to drug trafficking organizations.  Inadequate resources and the inability to 
interdict the frequent, small shipments of illicit drugs through Honduras remain as difficult 
challenges.  The Government of Honduras will need to continue on its path to reform its 
institutions, accelerate judicial processes, and provide adequate resources to its justice sector 
operators to achieve greater success against drug trafficking organizations.

India 
 
A.  Introduction 
 
India’s geographic location and transport links make it an attractive transshipment point for illicit 
narcotics bound for Europe, Africa, Southeast Asia, and North America.  Cross-border heroin 
trafficking from Pakistan to India continues to be a major problem due to India’s porous borders 
and capacity deficits that prevent the Indian Border Security Forces (BSF) from reducing 
smuggling.   
 
In 2018, India exported over $17 billion of licit pharmaceutical drugs, and it has been the leading 
generic drug manufacturer in the world for several years.  Estimates suggest that India exports 
twice the volume of pharmaceutical drugs as China.  Drug traffickers exploit this commercial 
infrastructure – and India’s rare combination of technical expertise and chemical source supplies 
– to market dangerous synthetic drugs in the United States and elsewhere.  U.S. and international 
law enforcement authorities have voiced concerns that transnational criminal organizations could 
target India’s pharmaceutical laboratories and chemists to produce illicit fentanyl and fentanyl 
analogues. 
 
U.S.-based customers obtain illegal pharmaceutical drugs from India through online pharmacies, 
non-indexed web sites (“Dark Web”), or call centers.  Thousands of mail shipments of illicit 
pharmaceutical drugs are sent to the United States each year, feeding the current opioid 
epidemic.  Neighboring countries including Nepal and Bhutan have also identified Indian 
pharmaceutical drugs as a major problem.  
 
Trafficking of the opioid tramadol from India is another serious drug control challenge.  India is 
the leading global producer of licit tramadol, and approximately 50 companies in the country are 
licensed to legitimately manufacture the drug.  However, billions of tablets of mostly counterfeit 
tramadol originating in India have been seized across Asia, Africa, and Europe.   
 
India is authorized to produce licit opium for the manufacture of pharmaceuticals and is a major 
producer of precursor chemicals.  There is evidence that opium is also grown illicitly in India, 
especially in the country’s northeast.   
      
India appears to be committed to addressing its drug-related challenges but faces resources and 
capacity limitations, as well as insufficient law enforcement presence relative to its population 
size.  Additionally, a lack of information technology, including integrated networks and case 
management software, hampers day-to-day enforcement of Indian drug laws.   
 
B.  Drug Control Accomplishments, Policies, and Trends 
 
 
1.  Institutional Development 
 
India continues to tighten regulations and increase law enforcement officer training.  However, 
the capacity of India’s drug law enforcement personnel to collect and analyze data and conduct 
complex criminal drug manufacturing and trafficking investigations remains limited by 


INCSR 2019 Volume 1  
 
 
 
 
Country Reports 
187 
 
inadequate training, a lack of modern equipment, insufficient staffing, and poor interagency 
coordination. 
 
 
To fulfill India’s United Nations treaty obligations for drug control, the Government of India 
implemented the Narcotic Drugs and Psychotropic Substances (NDPS) Act, 1985.  This Act gave 
rise to the Narcotics Control Bureau (NCB), India’s primary drug agency responsible for 
combating and preventing narcotic drugs and psychotropic substances.  In 2018, 24 NCB officers 
attended a week-long training conducted by the U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) 
on precursor chemicals and diversion. 
 
In addition to the NCB, India’s Directorate of Revenue Intelligence (DRI), Central Bureau of 
Narcotics (CBN), Border Security Force (BSF), Indian Customs Service (ICS), and the Ministry 
of Home Affairs (MHA) play a role in stemming the drug trafficking in India.  India’s DRI, 
housed under the Central Board of Indirect Taxes and Customs, is the primary anti-smuggling 
intelligence and investigative law enforcement agency.  Its responsibilities include investigating 
violations of the NDPS Act. 
 
The Central Bureau of Narcotics (CBN) supervises the licit cultivation of opium poppy in India.  
CBN is also responsible for the issuance of licenses required for the manufacture of synthetic 
narcotic drugs and psychotropic substances listed in the NDPS Act, as well as import/export 
authorizations for the movement of precursor chemicals and pharmaceutical drugs to and from 
India.  Furthermore, CBN is the central agency authorized to interact with the International 
Narcotics Control Board and international governments in supervising international transactions 
of regulated substances. 
 
BSF and ICS share primary responsibility for monitoring India’s borders.  ICS manages official 
border crossing checkpoints with Pakistan and is responsible for checking all cargo and persons 
entering India.  However, porous borders and capacity issues limit both agencies’ effectiveness 
in combatting illegal smuggling, cultivation, and production.  The porous borders also contribute 
to the movement of Afghan-produced heroin throughout the region, enabling regional terrorist 
groups in Afghanistan and Pakistan.  BSF and ICS continue to lack the technology necessary to 
keep pace with traffickers.    
 
India’s various national and state-level law enforcement agencies face challenges in 
institutionalizing effective coordination.  Poor intelligence exploitation during drug seizures 
limits investigative leads.  Lengthy delays between drug seizures and prosecutions also 
complicate efforts to develop an effective enforcement and prosecution strategy.  Finally, a lack 
of modern drug legislation and effective drug courts also severely hamper Indian law 
enforcement agencies’ ability to conduct complex drug conspiracy investigations. 
 
The Government of India has entered into bilateral agreements or memoranda of understanding 
for mutual cooperation to reduce demand and prevent the illicit trafficking of narcotics, 
psychotropic substances, and precursor chemicals with 36 countries.  India participates in mutual 
legal assistance treaties with 39 countries, including the United States.  India also maintains 
extradition treaties with at least 28 countries plus additional extradition arrangements.

2.  Supply Reduction 
 
India has seen a sharp rise in pharmaceutical and chemical diversion cases with investigative 
links to the United States as illicit distributors increasingly connect with less-regulated markets 
such as India for their supply.  Online sales (over both surface and non-indexed websites) and 
call center operations based in India continue to feed the U.S. appetite for opioids.   
 
Based on leads passed from the DEA, Indian drug authorities in Gujarat, Mumbai, and other 
cities within India, made numerous seizures of diverted controlled drugs in 2018, most of which 
were destined for the U.S. illicit market.  In 2018, Indian authorities acting on DEA information 
seized over 7.4 million tablets of tramadol destined for illicit diversion in the United States.  In 
September, DEA and DRI also worked together to safely dismantle the first known illicit 
fentanyl laboratory in India, and seized approximately 11 kilograms (kg) of fentanyl.   
 
In June 2018, Indian law enforcement raided multiple pharmaceutical factories illegally 
producing ketamine, resulting in the seizure of approximately 308 kg of ketamine and two metric 
tons of raw materials to manufacture ketamine, hashish, cocaine, and opium.  The drug 
trafficking organization involved in these raids was responsible for trafficking ketamine to 
Australia, Canada, the Democratic Republic of the Congo, Kenya, Malaysia, Mozambique, 
Nepal, Spain, Sri Lanka, Switzerland, the United Kingdom, and Vietnam, demonstrating India’s 
role as a central transit point for international drug trade.  One month later, officials seized 
approximately 300 additional kg of ketamine at two separate locations. 
 
The first seizure of Indian fentanyl, believed to have been destined for the U.S. market, occurred 
in August 2018 in Mexico.  In September, Indian Law Enforcement in conjunction with DEA 
successfully arrested three individuals involved in the operation of a fentanyl laboratory 
including a Mexican cartel member and a PhD-level chemist.   
 
In October 2018, Indian law enforcement officials arrested a Pakistani national involved in 
trafficking 300 kg of heroin near the Nepal border, with a believed terrorism nexus.  Seizures of 
MDMA (ecstasy) and ketamine manufactured in India have also been observed. 
 
In 2017 (the most recent data available as of this report), NCB continued to use satellite imagery 
and other intelligence methods to track and reduce illicit poppy cultivation.  NCB’s coordination 
and enforcement resulted in the identification and destruction of over 2,430 hectares (ha) of 
opium poppies (compared to 2,635 ha in 2016).  The U.S. government has not validated these 
figures.  In India’s northeast, where illicit poppy production is widespread, insurgent groups 
reportedly protect the poppy sites in exchange for compensation from traffickers and cultivators, 
complicating NCB efforts to identify and eradicate the sites. 
 
In 2017, cannabis cultivation was also detected, totaling about 3,446 ha.  This supply was 
subsequently destroyed.  The U.S. government has not validated this data.  
 
 
3.  Public Information, Prevention, and Treatment  
 


INCSR 2019 Volume 1  
 
 
 
 
Country Reports 
189 
 
There is significant pharmaceutical drug abuse in the country, with a ready supply of drugs 
available over the counter at most pharmacies.  However, given India’s size and large 
population, accurate estimates of the extent, pattern, and nature of its drug problem are difficult.  
Commonly reported drugs of abuse in India include heroin, opium, cocaine, ephedrine, cannabis, 
and MDMA.  India’s Ministry of Social Justice and Empowerment (MSJE) and NCB manage 
India’s public demand reduction strategy, which promotes drug abuse awareness, education, 
counseling, and treatment programs – and trains demand reduction volunteers.   
 
Additionally, India’s National AIDS Control Organization (NACO) is implementing programs to 
reduce public health consequences of drug use in regions with a high concentration of injecting 
drug users, especially the Northeast and Punjab regions.  Over 213 centers in the country provide 
services to 22,510 injecting drug users of the total estimated 160,968-person population of 
people who inject drugs in India, according to NACO statistics. 
 
In terms of broader drug use, an opioid dependence survey carried out in Punjab in 2015 found 
that of the state’s 28 million-person population, 230,000 people were opioid dependent and 
860,000 were opioid users. 
 
To better understand the national prevalence of drug abuse, MSJE and the National Drug 
Dependence Treatment Centre of the All India Institute of Medical Sciences  launched a survey 
to compile national and state-level estimates of the numbers of persons abusing drugs in July 
2016.  The two-year-long survey, originally scheduled for release in late 2018, will map the 
presence of treatment and rehabilitation services for drug-dependent individuals and identify the 
gaps in service delivery. 
 
 
4.  Corruption 
 
Although the Government of India does not encourage or facilitate drug trafficking, national and 
local government officials have been implicated in drug-related corruption.  Official corruption 
has historically undermined the effectiveness of government control regimes for illicit drugs, and 
Indian media reports allege widespread official corruption, with bribes paid to rural police 
stations and local governance bodies to ignore illicit poppy and cannabis fields under their 
jurisdiction.  Corrupt border officials also enable the movement of heroin and precursor materials 
across the border.  For example, in October 2018, the Anti-Corruption Bureau arrested an opium 
inspector and a contracted computer data operator posted at NCB for allegedly taking bribes 
from local farmers.   
 
C.  National Goals, Bilateral Cooperation, and U.S. Policy Initiatives 
 
U.S.-Indian law enforcement cooperation led to numerous high-yield and high-value seizures 
throughout 2018.  NCB, DRI and DEA made joint arrests and seized significant amounts of 
narcotics.  U.S. and Indian law enforcement authorities also continue to target international drug 
organizations based in the United States and other locations with extensive ties to India.  
Investigations have shown that Indian organizations have transferred proceeds from narcotics 
trafficking on behalf of multiple drug trafficking organizations.

D.  Conclusion 
 
India’s booming pharmaceutical and chemical industries are world leaders in pharmaceutical 
exports, particularly generic drugs.  However, the large industry is fragmented, insular, and in 
some ways, difficult to regulate.  Laws, regulations, and government enforcement have not kept 
adequate pace with the growth, and India is experiencing increased diversion from both licit 
pharmaceutical manufacturers and clandestine laboratories.   
 
In 2018, Indian NCB and DRI worked closely and effectively with DEA and regional 
counterdrug partners in Bangladesh, Nepal, Sri Lanka, and the Maldives.  Through this regional 
cooperation, Indian officials were able to make or facilitate numerous arrests and seizures.  
Further developing this relationship through intelligence sharing and cross training could lead to 
continued operational improvement. 
 
This collaboration will be critical in 2019, as significant narcotics-related challenges facing the 
Indian government include growing production and trafficking of synthetic drugs such as 
fentanyl, as well as diversion of controlled substances from both licit and illicit channels; 
pharmaceutical smuggling from India to neighboring countries; and poor coordination among 
India’s drug enforcement agencies.  
 
The profitability of manufacturing and distributing methamphetamine and other drugs has 
transformed India into a significant global source for precursor chemicals and drugs.  Global 
demand for fentanyl, methamphetamine, heroin, and other dangerous drugs has given rise to 
precursor chemical entrepreneurs in India who are retooling commercial chemical factories to 
illicitly produce large volumes of ephedrine, methamphetamine, and other drugs.  As global 
demand for synthetic drugs continues to grow, so too will India’s illicit manufacturing and 
trafficking networks.

Indonesia 
 
A.  Introduction 
 
As a transshipment and destination point for illicit drugs, the Indonesian government struggles 
with the maritime interdiction and border control issues inherent in policing the more than 
17,000 islands comprising its territory.  With the world’s fourth largest population, Indonesia is a 
significant consumer of cannabis, crystal methamphetamine, and MDMA (ecstasy).  Much of the 
methamphetamine available in Indonesia originates in China, Taiwan, or Burma.  MDMA is 
usually sourced from China, but also reaches Indonesia from the Netherlands, while cannabis is 
primarily grown in northern Sumatra for domestic consumption.  The Indonesian Government, 
including the National Narcotics Board of the Republic of Indonesia (BNN) and Indonesia 
National Police (INP), continued efforts to investigate, disrupt, interdict, and prosecute crimes 
related to illicit drugs in 2018, and some traffickers continued to receive the death penalty.   
 
B.  Drug Control Accomplishments, Policies, and Trends 
 
 
1.  Institutional Development 
 
Officers of BNN and INP continued to move aggressively against drug-trafficking suspects, and 
President Joko Widodo has called for strong enforcement measures to address the on-going drug 
emergency in Indonesia.  International non-governmental organizations periodically criticize 
excessive use of force in counterdrug operations.  On October 23, hundreds of residents attacked 
and burned a local police precinct building in Aceh following the suspicious death of a drug 
suspect, who was allegedly tortured while in police custody.  Four police were investigated for 
committing “procedural violations.”   
 
BNN’s 2018 budget included funding prevention, eradication, and demand reduction programs.  
According to BNN, each of the three deputies responsible for Prevention, Eradication, and 
Rehabilitation and Community Empowerment were provided equal funding.   
 
BNN opened three new facilities to respond to narcotics supply and demand challenges: 1) a 
narcotics lab – the first of its kind in Indonesia – to address emerging issues related to new 
psychoactive substances; 2) a canine-unit training facility to increase drug interdictions at border 
areas and major entry points; and 3) a BNN community office pilot project in Surabaya to 
encourage the public to provide information and tips.  BNN also purchased new equipment, 
including x-rays and scanners, and located them at air and seaports known to be entry points for 
illicit drugs. 
 
In an effort to disrupt a key drug smuggling route, BNN signed a Memorandum of 
Understanding (MOU) with PT (Pelabuhan Indonesia IV), a state owned enterprise that covers 
one of the biggest seaports in eastern Indonesia, Makassar Seaport.  Internationally, BNN also 
signed a MOU with the Kingdom of Morocco to share information involving illicit drug 
production and trade, evidence seizure, drug rehabilitation and research.  Indonesian authorities 
also continued to coordinate with partners on drug interdiction, including the United States and 
Taiwan.

BNN reported that during the first 10 months of 2018, 111,000 individuals were incarcerated on 
drug-related charges, and more than half of those specifically for trafficking.  The United States 
provided counterdrug training for BNN and the INP, including for more than 45 law enforcement 
officers in February in Medan, North Sumatra.  Participants received training in financial 
analysis, internet investigations, graphic analysis, and cultivating confidential sources.  No 
mutual legal assistance treaty or extradition treaty exists between Indonesia and the United 
States.    
 
2. Supply Reduction 
 
BNN and INP continued to interdict illicit drugs successfully during 2018, and U.S. assistance 
proved helpful in this regard.  Indonesian law enforcement made a number of significant seizures 
during the year.  The largest, in February, was based on joint cooperation between BNN, INP, 
Indonesia Customs Narcotics Enforcement Team (CNET), Illegal Unreported and Unregulated 
Fishing (IUUF) Task Force, and U.S. authorities that resulted in an initial seizure of 
approximately 470 kilograms (kg) of crystal methamphetamine from a fishing vessel operated by 
a Taiwanese syndicate, followed two weeks later by the seizure of another 725 kg of crystal 
methamphetamine from a fishing vessel suspected of being operated by the same Taiwanese 
organization.  These seizures represent the largest Indonesian drug seizures to date. 
 
 
3.  Public Information, Prevention, and Treatment 
 
BNN did not publish any national surveys or research in 2018; the agency’s most recent drug 
research was published in December 2017.  According to the December 2017 research, an 
average of 30 people died daily within the country from overdoses. 
  
Rehabilitative services are provided by the Indonesian government, but supply does not meet 
demand.  BNN is one of the government agencies that provides rehabilitative services, and has 
the capacity to offer treatment to up to 20,000 drug users annually.  However, Indonesia’s total 
drug-using population tops four million, according to BNN statistics. 
 
 
4.  Corruption 
 
The Indonesian government did not encourage or facilitate any illegal activity related to drug 
trafficking, and no senior government officials were known to be institutionally involved in any 
such activity.  However, corruption at all levels of government and society continues to be 
endemic, and undermines the country’s drug control efforts.  Nevertheless, Indonesia made some 
progress in 2018 in combating official corruption, primarily through the actions of the 
Corruption Eradication Commission.   
 
C.  National Goals, Bilateral Cooperation, and U.S. Policy Initiatives 
 
In 2018, the United States and Indonesia continue to follow through on most of the areas of 
bilateral drug demand reduction cooperation agreed upon in February 2016 at the U.S.-Indonesia 
Drug Demand Reduction Workshop in Jakarta.  In October, two Community Anti-Drug

Coalitions (in Jakarta and Surabaya) graduated from two-year training programs that give 
communities the skills to assess their own local drug problems, inventory the community’s 
resources, and execute unique solutions to address problems.  
 
The United States is also working with the Indonesian Maritime Police and Maritime Security 
Agency to promote interagency collaboration and cooperation within Indonesia, and to build 
maritime patrol and interdiction capacity. 
  
D.   Conclusion 
 
Despite the efforts of the Indonesian government, demand for illicit drugs is believed to be 
growing in Indonesia.  Indonesia’s commitment to reducing drug consumption and enforcing its 
drug control laws remains firm.  The United States will continue to support Indonesian law 
enforcement efforts to disrupt the international drug trade, particularly in the maritime arena, 
while also helping Indonesia embrace a wide range of interventions aimed at reducing drug use 
and associated problems.

Iran 
 
Iran is a significant transit and destination country for opiates and cannabis products originating 
mostly in Afghanistan.  Significant volumes of methamphetamine are also produced and 
consumed within Iran, as well as trafficked to international markets.  Most opiates and cannabis 
products are trafficked into Iran across its land borders with Afghanistan and Pakistan.  Drug 
supplies transiting Iran are trafficked overland across Iran’s northern borders, primarily through 
Turkey and Azerbaijan, and to a lesser extent into Iraq.  Heroin and other opioids are also 
trafficked by maritime conveyance from Iran into Eastern Africa, for further transshipment to 
international markets.   
 
Iran’s Drug Control Headquarters (DCHQ) is the country’s leading drug policy coordination 
body and reports directly to the country’s president.  The Law Enforcement Force (LEF) 
comprises the country’s uniformed police units, including the Anti-Narcotics Police and border 
interdiction forces.  According to media reports quoting DCHQ senior officials, Iranian 
authorities seized a total of 370 metric tons of all categories during the first five months of Iran’s 
lunar calendar in 2018 (March 21 – August 22).  During this period, seizures of heroin, 
morphine, and opium significantly outpaced what was seized during the same period in 2017 – 
by 17 percent, 58 percent, and 3 percent, respectively.     
 
The Iranian government recognizes that illicit drug consumption within Iran is a serious 
challenge, and increasingly prevalent.  In 2018, DCHQ authorities estimated that 2.8 million 
people regularly use some form of illicit drug within the country, with half that total suffering 
from substance use disorders.  Other Iranian authorities and non-governmental organizations 
have cited higher estimates.  Opium is the most widely-used illicit drug in Iran, according to 
Iranian authorities, followed by cannabis products and methamphetamine (known locally as 
“shisheh,” or “glass”).  Approximately 43 percent of Iran’s inmate population is jailed for drug 
offenses, according to media reports.  Non-governmental organizations and the private sector 
implement the vast majority of demand reduction and treatment programs in the country, 
including opioid substitution treatment, voluntary counseling centers, prison-based treatment, 
and school-based prevention campaigns.  
 
The UN Office on Drugs and Crime maintains a field office in Tehran that provides some 
training and capacity support to Iranian authorities, including on demand reduction, drug 
interdiction, and forensic analysis of drug seizures.  Iran maintains liaison relationships with 
some neighboring countries, but operational cooperation on investigations appears limited.  Drug 
control cooperation between Iran and European states has been limited partially due to concerns 
over the Iranian government’s widespread application of the death penalty for drug offenses.  In 
January 2018, the country’s strict trafficking laws were amended, raising the threshold that 
triggers the death penalty in drug possession cases.

Jamaica 
 
A.  Introduction  
 
Jamaica remains the largest Caribbean source country of marijuana and a significant transit point 
for cocaine trafficked from South America to North America and other international markets.  
Traffickers also export Jamaican-grown marijuana to other Caribbean countries in return for 
illicit firearms and other contraband.  Jamaica’s geographic position in the western Caribbean 
and its difficult-to-patrol coastline, high volume of tourist travel, and status as a major 
containerized cargo transshipment hub contribute to its use for drug trafficking via commercial 
shipping, small watercraft, air freight, human couriers, and private aircraft. 
 
The U.S. and Jamaican governments continue to successfully utilize bilateral legal assistance and 
extradition treaties, as well as agreements on maritime law enforcement cooperation and sharing 
forfeited assets.  Additionally, the United States and Jamaica made progress in 2018 toward an 
agreement to formalize information sharing between customs agencies.   
 
Jamaica’s drug control efforts face significant challenges from corruption, organized crime, gang 
activity, resource constraints, and an inefficient criminal justice system.   
 
B.  Drug Control Accomplishments, Policies, and Trends 
 
 
1.  Institutional Development 
 
Cooperation between the United States and Jamaica against illicit drugs and related transnational 
crime remains strong.  The U.S. government’s primary Jamaican partners are the Jamaica 
Constabulary Force (JCF, police), the Jamaica Defense Force (military), the Jamaica Customs 
Agency, the Major Organized Crime and Anti-corruption Agency (MOCA), and the Financial 
Investigation Division of the Ministry of Finance.  Jamaica’s Caribbean Regional Drug Law 
Enforcement Training Center, housed at the JCF’s police college, provides counterdrug training 
to several regional partners. 
 
The United States and Jamaica are bilateral parties to both a mutual legal assistance treaty and an 
extradition treaty.  The countries have a strong extradition and mutual assistance relationship, 
and both treaties were successfully used in 2018.  The United States and Jamaica also utilized a 
reciprocal agreement to share forfeited criminal assets and a bilateral agreement on law 
enforcement cooperation on maritime interdiction of illicit traffickers, including boarding of 
suspicious vessels and embarkation of law enforcement officials on the other country’s ships. 
 
In 2018, the U.S. and Jamaican governments made some progress toward finalizing a bilateral 
customs mutual assistance agreement (CMAA).  The CMAA will provide a legal framework for 
the exchange of trade information between U.S. and Jamaican customs agencies, which in the 
long term will assist in targeting the flow of drugs, guns, and other contraband through U.S. and 
Jamaican ports of entry.  The CMAA is still under review by the Jamaican government and is not 
expected to be signed and in effect until 2019.  The Jamaican government ended in 2018 an 
existing non-binding memorandum of understanding previously used to share intercept 


INCSR 2019 Volume 1  
 
 
 
 
Country Reports 
196 
 
information, on the basis that it did not meet the legal framework required under the Jamaican 
constitution.  The absence of a formal agreement to share intercept information has hampered 
U.S. investigations in some areas.  The United States and Jamaica are currently in negotiations to 
find a way forward to reaching a mutually agreeable mechanism to restore this longstanding area 
of cooperation between both governments.    
 
The Jamaica Defense Force Coast Guard is responsible for maritime law enforcement in 
Jamaica’s over 92,000 square mile maritime domain.  The Jamaican military purchased its first 
fixed-wing intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance aircraft, and held the launch ceremony 
on November 14, 2018.  Additionally, the Jamaican government has assigned a military officer 
to serve as a liaison at the U.S. Joint Interagency Task Force South in Key West, Florida, for 
coordination of operations against maritime traffickers.   
 
Jamaica’s efforts to bring traffickers to justice are hobbled by an under-resourced, overburdened 
judicial system.  Repeated delays and trial postponements contribute to significant case backlogs; 
frustration among police, witnesses, jurors, and the public, and; impunity for many offenders.  In 
response, the Jamaican government passed a plea bargain reform bill in 2017, drafted with U.S. 
support and designed to incentivize plea bargaining to increase the courts’ efficiency and reduce 
the backlog of criminal cases.   
 
2.  Supply Reduction 
 
According to the JCF, authorities seized 63 kilograms (kg) of cocaine over the first nine months 
of 2018.  Jamaican authorities seized 658 kg during the same period in 2017.  In 2018, the JCF’s 
forces have been stretched thin by various state of emergency operations. 
 
Significant cocaine seizures at or near the Port of Kingston have indicated that large shipments 
reached Jamaica via commercial shipping containers from South America.  Cocaine also arrives 
in Jamaica via small “go-fast” watercraft from Central and South America, likely with the 
assistance of larger fishing vessels that serve as mother ships.  After reaching Jamaica, some 
cocaine shipments are transshipped in containers through the Port of Kingston onto vessels 
bound for the United States and other international markets.  Other shipments enter the country 
and are divided into smaller quantities for outbound shipment via other means, including 
concealment in luggage, human couriers, air freight, or small watercraft. 
 
In 2015, legislation to decriminalize the possession and use of small amounts of marijuana for 
personal use went into effect.  During the first nine months of 2018, Jamaican authorities 
eradicated 186 hectares (ha) of cannabis plants and seized approximately 20.2 metric tons of 
cured marijuana, according to police data.  Jamaican farmers cultivate an estimated 15,000 ha of 
cannabis every year.  The police, supported by the United States, employ an eradication team to 
cut growing plants, seize seedlings and cured marijuana, and burn them in the field.  The team 
conducts only manual eradication, since Jamaican law prohibits the use of herbicides.   
 
Traffickers smuggle Jamaican-grown marijuana out of the country via commercial shipping and 
small watercraft.  Small fishing vessels and speed boats carry marijuana to Haiti, the Cayman 
Islands, and the Bahamas.  A thriving “guns for ganja (marijuana)” trade continues between 


INCSR 2019 Volume 1  
 
 
 
 
Country Reports 
197 
 
Jamaica and Haiti, as evidenced by seizures in 2018 of illegal firearms traced to Haiti and 
marijuana shipments prepared for embarkation from coastal Jamaica.  Police and customs 
officials also target marijuana shipments smuggled via commercial shipping directly to the 
United States. 
 
Jamaica prohibits the manufacture, sale, transport, and possession of MDMA (ecstasy) and 
methamphetamine and regulates the precursor chemicals used to produce them.  There were no 
reports of synthetic drugs or precursor chemicals produced or trafficked in Jamaica in 2018.  The 
National Council on Drug Abuse, the Pharmacy Council, and the Ministry of Health work to 
expand awareness among health professionals of the potential for diversion of ephedrine and 
pseudoephedrine to produce methamphetamine. 
 
U.S. law enforcement agencies work closely with Jamaican police and customs officials to 
develop leads, share information, and facilitate interdiction of drug shipments originating in or 
transiting through Jamaica.  The U.S. government has supported the Jamaican police’s Narcotics 
Division with equipment, including 17 donated vehicles and a training room, as well as training.   
 
 
3.  Drug Abuse Awareness, Demand Reduction, and Treatment 
 
The Ministry of Health’s National Council on Drug Abuse (NCDA), working through the 
primary care system and mental health clinics, provides assessment, counseling and treatment 
services for substance abusers.  The Jamaican government operates one detoxification center 
located at the University Hospital of the West Indies in Kingston and also offers services at 
Kingston’s Bellevue Hospital (a mental health institution).  In collaboration with the 
Organization of American States’ Inter-American Drug Abuse Control Commission, Jamaica 
offers a university-level certificate program in drug addiction and drug prevention.  The UN 
Office on Drugs and Crime works directly with the Jamaican government and non-governmental 
organizations on demand reduction. 
 
 
4.  Corruption 
 
As a matter of policy, the Jamaican government does not encourage or facilitate illegal activity 
associated with drug trafficking or the laundering of proceeds from illicit drug transactions.  
Jamaican law penalizes corruption, but in practice, corruption remains entrenched and 
widespread, and the judicial system has a poor record of prosecuting corruption cases against law 
enforcement and government officials.  The last time a Member of Parliament or similarly high-
ranking official was tried or convicted on corruption charges was in 1990, when a former 
minister of labor was convicted for diverting money from a farm worker program for personal 
gain.  Corruption at Jamaica’s airports and seaports allegedly facilitates the movement of drug 
shipments across borders, and organized crime leaders have historically had ties to government 
officials, creating a permissive environment for drug trafficking.   
 
In October 2018, the Jamaican government passed a bill to make MOCA, which investigates 
organized crime and official corruption, fully independent of the police.  MOCA was previously 
a task force within the JCF; the new legislation makes it a free-standing entity with its own 


INCSR 2019 Volume 1  
 
 
 
 
Country Reports 
198 
 
dedicated resources, potentially increasing its freedom to investigate corruption cases throughout 
the government. 
 
C.  National Goals, Bilateral Cooperation, and U.S. Policy Initiatives 
 
The U.S. and Jamaican governments coordinate closely on shared priorities related to narcotics 
control, including investigative capacity, customs cooperation, maritime security, and support to 
the judicial system.  
 
The United States supports a wide range of efforts designed to reduce illicit trafficking, advance 
public safety and citizen security, and promote justice through the Caribbean Basin Security 
Initiative (CBSI).  CBSI support to Jamaica includes training, equipment, and logistical 
assistance for interdicting illicit drugs and firearms trafficking; combating cybercrime, money 
laundering, financial fraud, and other organized crime; improving Jamaica’s efforts to seize and 
forfeit criminally-acquired assets; and enhancing Jamaica’s maritime law enforcement 
capabilities.  The United States also funds projects to improve the effectiveness of prosecutors 
and the courts, the National Forensic Sciences Laboratory, and the Financial Investigation 
Division.   
 
To increase public and government attention on the need for anticorruption reforms, the United 
States provides support to the non-governmental organization National Integrity Action (NIA).  
NIA provides training to government, civil society, and media partners to increase awareness and 
conducts campaigns to increase public demand for more effective action against corruption.   
 
The United States and Jamaica entered into a bilateral agreement to suppress maritime illicit 
trafficking in 1998.  This agreement includes provisions to stop, board, and search suspect 
vessels, the authority to overfly Jamaica’s territorial waters, the ability to order to land, and the 
use of third-party boarding platforms.  Jamaica is a regular participant in the Multilateral 
Maritime Interdiction and Prosecution Summits, which bring together maritime counter drug 
professionals from more than 20 countries across the Caribbean, Europe, and the United States. 
 
D.  Conclusion 
 
Cooperation between Jamaica and the United States related to drug trafficking and transnational 
crime continued to be strong in 2018, as evidenced by the high number of high-level extraditions 
of wanted criminals from the United States to Jamaica.   
 
Progress against drug trafficking will significantly depend on efforts to combat corruption and 
strengthen the judicial system so traffickers are held criminally accountable.  New legislation to 
create an independent anticorruption investigation agency and U.S.-supported programs to weed 
out corrupt officials may represent a step forward in this regard.

Kazakhstan 
 
A.  Introduction 
 
Kazakhstan is a transit country for Afghan heroin and other opiates destined for Russia and 
Europe.  Kazakhstan’s law enforcement agencies continued to report declining volumes of 
seizures of Afghan heroin in Kazakhstan in 2018, continuing a multi-year trend.  Official 
statistics were not available at the time of this report.  Kazakhstani authorities credited this 
reported decline to the Government of Kazakhstan’s effort to enhance border security in the 
south of the country, as well as a possible shift in trafficking patterns away from Central Asia in 
favor of routes through South Asia and the Balkans.  The U.S. government lacks sufficient 
information to corroborate these possible explanations.  
 
Cultivation and trafficking of cannabis occurs within Kazakhstan, with most cannabis originating 
in the Zhambyl region on the southern border with the Kyrgyz Republic.  Law enforcement 
conducts operations to eradicate cultivation and interdict trafficking of cannabis within those 
areas of the country.  The Government of Kazakhstan has expressed growing concern about the 
use and trafficking of synthetic drugs within Kazakhstan, many of which are purchased via the 
internet and imported into the country from Russia, China, Southeast Asia, and Europe.   
 
B.  Drug Control Accomplishments, Policies, and Trends 
 
 
1.  Institutional Development 
 
The Government of Kazakhstan  pursues efforts to prevent drug addiction and combat drug 
trafficking as high priorities, and has integrated counterdrug activities into its National Security 
Strategy.  Kazakhstan implements drug demand reduction treatment projects in line with its 
national healthcare program for 2016-2019.  
 
Kazakhstan embraces regional cooperation to counter drug trafficking, including by hosting of 
the Central Asia Regional Information Coordination Center for Combating Illicit Trafficking of 
Narcotic Drugs, Psychotropic Substances and their Precursors (CARICC).  The country’s law 
enforcement agencies use CARICC as a platform to exchange operational information on 
transnational drug trafficking in Central Asia.  The government cooperates with various 
multilateral organizations on drug control activities and policy discussions, including the United 
Nations Office on Drugs and Crime (UNODC); the Shanghai Cooperation Organization (SCO); 
the Collective Security Treaty Organization (CSTO); the Commonwealth of Independent States 
(CIS); and the Eurasian Group on Combating Money Laundering and Terrorism Financing.  
Kazakhstan continues to provide training assistance to Afghanistan and other states in the region.  
Cadets from Afghanistan, the Kyrgyz Republic, and Tajikistan study at Kazakhstan’s Ministry of 
Internal Affairs and Border Guard Service academies.  
 
In 2018, Kazakhstan’s law enforcement agencies participated in several counterdrug operations 
and exercises under a CSTO regional umbrella operation called “Kanal” (Channel).  Kazakhstan 
hosted two operations under this initiative, in May and September, respectively.  In cooperation 
with UNODC, Kazakhstan also implemented five capacity building projects to counter illicit 


INCSR 2019 Volume 1  
 
 
 
 
Country Reports 
200 
 
trafficking of narcotics, psychotropic substances and their precursors in Central Asia and other 
neighboring countries.  SCO members adopted an Anti-Narcotics Strategy for 2018-2023, an 
action plan for its implementation, and a “concept of prevention of abuse of narcotics and 
psychotropic substances.”    
 
In 2016, Kazakhstan developed draft legislation that would allow scheduling of potentially 
dangerous psychoactive substances as analogues of narcotic drugs and psychotropic substances, 
including on an emergency basis.  The law still awaits approval by Kazakhstan’s parliament.      
 
 
2.  Supply Reduction 
 
During the first nine months of 2018, Kazakhstan’s law enforcement agencies reported detecting 
6,516 criminal drug-related offences, including 2,147 drug-related crimes, 1,446 illicit drug 
sales, and 172 instances of drug smuggling.  Law enforcement agencies reported conducting six 
controlled delivery operations that resulted in the seizure of 16.5 kilograms (kg) of illicit drugs.  
The Ministry of Internal Affairs (MVD) reported disrupting nine drug trafficking organizations, 
initiating 15 criminal cases targeting organized criminal groups, and initiating 12 cases targeting 
illicit drug sales.  Law enforcement reported seizing 18.9 metric tons (MT) of illicit drugs in total 
(down from 38.5 MT during the same period in 2017), including 55.3 kg of heroin (126.6 kg in 
2017); 740 kg of hashish (439.6 kg in 2017); 7.4 kg of opium; and 16.4 MT of marijuana (32.3 
MT in 2017).  
 
Kazakhstan conducted its annual cannabis eradication operation from May 20 through October 
20.  During the first nine months of 2018, the MVD reported detecting 1,571 internet sites 
involved in illicit drug sales, and the Ministry of Information and Communications blocked 
1,446 of those sites.  Another 125 sites are still under review.      
 
The MVD reported seizing approximately 1.8 kg of synthetic drugs in 2018, including 1.2 kg of 
pyrovalerone, 856 grams of fentanyl, and 23.8 grams of methylmethcathinone.  The relatively 
small synthetic drug seizure totals may not accurately reflect the true scale of trafficking within 
the country.  Kazakhstani agencies have limited forensic capacity to identify new psychoactive 
substances, and the country’s current legislation does not criminalize analogue substances. 
 
 
3.  Public Information, Prevention, and Treatment 
 
The MVD Counternarcotics Department cooperates with 73 non-governmental organizations 
(NGOs) on drug demand reduction activities and the medical and social rehabilitation of persons 
suffering from substance abuse disorders.  New narcology standards, treatment methods, prison 
addict rehabilitation, and harm reduction programs are in development, but remain antiquated.  
 
The Counternarcotics Department worked with the Ministry of Health, the Ministry of Education 
and Science, and NGOs to conduct 6,453 drug demand reduction events in 2018, reaching over 
333,000 youth.  The government also introduced a new program in schools to assist with early 
diagnosis of drug use.  A drug use prevention project initiated by the MVD and the Ministry of 
Education and Science called “Young Police Assistants” has reached 55,000 school children.

The government reported 23,105 registered drug users in 2018, including 1,704 women and 126 
minors. 
 
 
4.  Corruption 
 
The Government of Kazakhstan does not, as a matter of government policy, encourage or 
facilitate illicit drug production or distribution, nor is it involved in laundering the proceeds of 
the sale of illicit drugs.  However, there are instances of corruption among law enforcement 
agencies, particularly among front line law enforcement officers, whose low salaries incentivize 
bribe requests.  The government rewards citizens for reporting police corruption 
 
C.  National Goals, Bilateral Cooperation, and U.S. Policy Initiatives 
 
Kazakhstan is committed to advancing its drug demand and supply reduction goals and 
strengthening international cooperation in these fields.  To reduce the illicit inflow of drugs, 
Kazakhstan plans to revise its border procedures for foreign nationals, especially from countries 
identified as illicit drug trafficking threats.  The government is also developing measures to 
identify and combat maritime trafficking channels.   
 
The United States continues to support drug control capacity building with relevant authorities.  
The U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) signed a memorandum of understanding 
(MOU) with the MVD in November 2016 to support bilateral drug control efforts and 
information sharing, allowing a closer relationship, information sharing, and joint operations.  
DEA also signed an MOU with Committee for National Security of the Republic of Kazakhstan 
(KNB) on June 27, 2018, which yielded fruitful cooperation over the course of the year.  The 
United States supports efforts to strengthen Kazakhstan’s border security, including efforts to 
expand Kazakhstan’s Coast Guard capacity on the Caspian Sea.  In 2018, the United States 
organized 36 training programs for Kazakhstani drug enforcement officers.  All U.S. government 
programs aim to improve Kazakhstan’s capacity to combat drug trafficking and drug demand, 
and enjoy full host government support and shared funding.   
 
D.  Conclusion 
 
Kazakhstan remains concerned about regional drug trafficking trends linked to illicit drug 
production in Afghanistan.  To confront the increasing synthetic drug threat, Kazakhstan should 
work to finalize and adopt its pending legislation that would allow it to schedule narcotic 
analogues for control, including on an emergency basis, a step that will greatly enhance its 
ability to counter this threat.  The government is seeking to expand its drug control cooperation 
with international partners, especially the United States, and is also taking steps to combat 
existing and emerging public health and national security threats posed by drug trafficking and 
addiction.

Kenya 
 
Kenya is a significant transshipment route for illicit drugs destined for other international 
markets, and, to a lesser extent, a consumer country of illicit drugs.  Transnational criminal 
organizations that transship drugs through Kenya also engage in a wide range of additional 
criminal activity, including corruption, money laundering and wildlife trafficking.  Drug 
trafficking organizations utilize Kenya as a transshipment point for heroin and to a lesser extent, 
cocaine and methamphetamine.  The most commonly used illicit drug by Kenyan adults is 
cannabis, followed by heroin and diverted pharmaceutical drugs. 
 
The Narcotic Drugs and Psychotropic Substances (Control) Act of 1994 and its various 
amendments provide the basis for drug law enforcement within Kenya.  Criminal asset forfeiture 
laws are also in place allowing for the seizure and forfeiture of proceeds from drug trafficking, as 
well as assets used in furtherance of such crimes.  The Anti-Narcotic Units of the Kenya Police 
Service enforce narcotics laws throughout the country, while other law enforcement agencies 
frequently assist in drug enforcement matters.   
 
The importation of heroin into Kenya is a major focus of law enforcement authorities.  This 
criminal activity brings with it a multitude of other threats, including corruption and increased 
local use of the drug.  Although heroin is used throughout Kenya, consumption is most prevalent 
along the coastal area surrounding Mombasa.  Heroin enters Kenya both through maritime 
smuggling and over land borders, primarily in the south of Kenya.  Cocaine frequently transits 
Kenya, primarily by couriers traveling commercial airlines.  Although a majority of the cocaine 
is destined for other markets, there is evidence of local cocaine trafficking and consumption.   
 
The United States and Kenya enjoy an excellent bilateral relationship and fully cooperate on 
multilateral drug enforcement efforts.  The U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration works closely 
with Kenya to target national and international drug trafficking organizations.  In turn, Kenyan 
counternarcotics law enforcement authorities also liaise with their counterparts in neighboring 
countries and throughout the region, fostering a coordinated multinational approach in targeting 
transnational criminal organizations.

Laos 
  
A.  Introduction  
  
Laos is a major drug source country of illicit opium cultivation, and a significant transit hub and 
consumer of other illicit drugs, particularly amphetamine-type stimulants (ATS).  Most of the 
opium grown in Laos is destined for export and refinement into heroin, with only a small 
percentage consumed in Laos.  Laos is not a significant source of opiates being sent to the United 
States.  ATS production within Laos appears to be limited but increasing, and seizure data 
indicates that ATS trafficking into Laos from neighboring countries is increasing, fueling rising 
drug use within the country.  Laos shares approximately 3,000 miles of porous land and riverine 
borders with Burma, Thailand, China, Cambodia, and Vietnam.  Although infrastructure remains 
rudimentary, improving road, bridge, and communication networks in Laos have increased 
opportunities for drug trafficking. 
 
Poppy cultivation in Laos decreased 96 percent between 1998 and 2007 due to aggressive 
government action and international cooperation, particularly U.S. alternative development 
assistance.  Although significant amounts of opium poppy are still grown in Laos, often in 
remote and difficult to access areas, overall cultivation appears to have been relatively stable in 
recent years, if not declining marginally.  According to the most recent UN Office on Drugs and 
Crime (UNODC) Laos Opium Survey, Laos cultivated an estimated 6,200 hectares (ha) of opium 
poppy in 2014 and 5,700 ha in 2015.  The most recent available data, from a survey completed 
by Lao and Chinese technical staff, found 5,328 ha of opium poppy in 2017. 
 
B.  Drug Control Accomplishments, Policies, and Trends 
  
 
1.  Institutional Development 
  
Since 1989, the United States has provided Laos approximately $47 million in law enforcement 
and drug control assistance, which helped to eliminate much of Laos’ opium poppy cultivation.  
The Lao Bureau for Drug Control and Supervision (LBDC) and the Counternarcotics Police 
Department (DCD), both under the Ministry of Public Security, are the main coordinating bodies 
for the implementation of drug demand reduction, crop control, alternative development, and law 
enforcement activities.  The top policy-making body for drug control is the National Steering 
Committee to Combat Drugs (NSCCD), chaired by the Prime Minister.  Lao drug police are 
organized into 18 provincial counterdrug police divisions known as Counter Narcotics Units 
(CNUs), one for each province and Vientiane Capital.   
 
Laos does not have a bilateral extradition or a mutual legal assistance agreement with the United 
States, though Laos has acceded to multilateral conventions that enable such cooperation.  While 
the Lao are receptive to training opportunities, bilateral cooperation with the United States on 
international drug trafficking investigations has been rare to date.

Lao drug control authorities have increased their cooperation over the past several years on 
border control and interdiction with counterparts in neighboring countries.  In January 2017, 
Laos joined other ASEAN Member States in adopting the ASEAN Cooperation Plan to Tackle 
Illicit Drug Production and Trafficking in the Golden Triangle (2017-2019).  The Plan is a 
concerted effort to solve drug problems in the Golden Triangle, and builds on both the Safe 
Mekong Joint Operation Project, which began in 2013, and the ASEAN Work Plan on Securing 
Communities Against Illicit Drugs (2016-2025).  In October 2018, Laos took over hosting the 
Safe Mekong Coordination Center and will play the role of host until January 2019.  The Safe 
Mekong Operation Project on Drug Control is specifically focused on disrupting the flow of 
drugs out of the Golden Triangle and intercepting the flow of chemical precursors into the 
Golden Triangle.  The Safe Mekong initiative partner countries are China, Laos, Thailand, 
Vietnam, Burma, and Cambodia.  
 
Several Lao drug traffickers were arrested and sentenced in 2017-18.  Lao national Xaysana 
Keophimpha was arrested at Suvarnabhumi airport in Bangkok in January 2017 and sentenced to 
life in prison in Thailand in March 2018.  Several of his associates have also been arrested, 
including Sisouk Daoheuang (arrested in Laos) and Akarakit Worarojcharoendet (arrested in 
Thailand), and have been sentenced to lengthy prison terms or are awaiting sentencing. 
 
During the first six months of 2018, the DCD reportedly seized 71.13 kilograms (kg) of heroin; 
53.36 kg of opium; 5.9 kg of cannabis; 102.83 kilogram (kg) of crystal methamphetamine; 
1,775,360 ATS tablets (weighing 260.53 kg), and 25.9 kg of precursor chemicals.  The DCD 
investigated 2,947 drug cases and arrested 4,404 people, including 110 foreign nationals.  
Statistics for the second half of the year were not available at the time of this report.  The Lao 
government also continues to support longstanding efforts to assist former poppy-growing 
farmers by fostering alternative livelihoods, mostly financed by donors. 
 
In 2016, the U.S. government launched a three-year, $1.5 million alternative development 
program with the UNODC in Houaphan province.  The project focus includes the development 
of coffee plantations and improved technology for livestock production.  In 2018, the U.S. 
government signed a new $1.225 million Letter of Agreement (LOA) with the Lao Department 
of Customs focused on improving border security and disrupting the flow of illicit substances 
into Laos.  The U.S. government has an existing LOA with the Ministry of Public Security’s 
Counternarcotics Police Division and capacity building trainings with Lao CNUs are ongoing.  
  
 
3.  Public Information, Prevention, and Treatment 
  
The current Lao government, led by Prime Minister Thongloun Sisoulith, has made combating 
illicit drugs a top priority, and the Lao government has increased efforts to raise awareness of the 
risks and negative consequences of illicit drugs through mass media such as television, radio, 
newspaper, and other channels. 
 
ATS use is thought to be concentrated among Laos' youth population, mostly consumed as 
“yaba,” a mixture of methamphetamine and caffeine that is popular throughout Southeast Asia.  


INCSR 2019 Volume 1  
 
 
 
 
Country Reports 
205 
 
The Lao Government uses an estimate of 40,000 consumers, although this figure is likely an 
underestimate.   
 
Government drug treatment facilities lack the resources to provide evidence-based treatment and 
post-discharge follow-up.  To support demand reduction efforts, the United States supports the 
adoption of community-based, voluntary treatment.  The United States has provided 
approximately $600,000 to the UNODC and the World Health Organization to establish and 
operate 28 Community-Based Treatment centers providing screening and counseling services at 
district hospitals across six provinces.  The United States is also funding the translation and 
training for Lao National Trainers on the U.S.-developed Universal Prevention Curriculum and 
Universal Treatment Curriculum, with the Colombo Plan and UNODC as the implementers. 
 
 
4.  Corruption  
 
The Lao government does not encourage or facilitate the illicit production or distribution of 
narcotic or other controlled substances, or the laundering of proceeds from illegal drug 
transactions.  However, salaries for police, military and civil servants are low, and corruption in 
Laos is endemic. 
 
C.  National Goals, Bilateral Cooperation, and U.S. Policy Initiatives 
  
The Lao government’s guiding drug control strategy document, the “National Drug Control 
Master Plan 2016-2020,” was approved in May 2016.  The Master Plan, which was developed 
with support from the United States and the UNODC, articulates nine priorities for the Lao 
government, including: 
 
•         Formulation and improvement of legal instruments concerning narcotic; 
•         Data/Information collection and analysis; 
•         Education/Training/Dissemination of the laws and adverse consequences 
     resulting from drug abuse; 
•         Treatment and vocational training for drug addicts; 
•         Alternative development, replacing opium poppy and cannabis cultivation; 
•         Law enforcement; 
•         Precursor control, analysis and test of drug use; 
•         International cooperation; and 
•         Streamlining the organizational machinery of the national commission for 
    drug control and supervision at the central and local levels. 
 
The Master Plan implements the country’s National Drug Law (promulgated in 2015), and calls 
for a budget of $18 million over five years from 2016-2020.  Funds for implementing the plan 
are expected to come from the Lao government and international donors.   
 
The United States supports Laos’ goal to strengthen the rule of law by 2020 and to create a better 
environment for combating transnational crime.  Most U.S. counterdrug assistance to Laos 
supports law enforcement efforts, including training for the DCD, CNUs, and Customs 
Department.

D.  Conclusion 
  
Drug control cooperation between Laos and the United States is increasing and continues to 
emphasize border security and improved law enforcement capacity.  Drug trafficking networks 
across Southeast Asia ignore national borders, requiring strong regional law enforcement 
capacity and cooperation.  Laos’ justice, law enforcement, and security systems lack the 
resources necessary to counter the increased sophistication of drug-related crime that has 
accompanied the country’s growing economic development.  Continued support for institution 
building within the Lao government as well as basic law enforcement training, emphasizing 
interdiction, investigation, and prosecution, remains needed.

Liberia 
 
A.  Introduction 
 
While Liberia is not a significant transit country for illicit narcotics, the country’s nascent law 
enforcement capacity, porous border controls, and proximity to major drug transit routes 
contribute to trafficking to and through Liberia.  While Liberia is also not a significant producer 
of illicit drugs, local drug use is very common.  There is no reliable data on drug consumption 
trends within Liberia because of poor transportation and communications infrastructure, and a 
lack of capacity within the Government of Liberia to undertake the necessary research.  
However, a recent U.S.-administered survey of Liberian youth found that marijuana, tramadol, 
and methamphetamine are the drugs of choice.  Other drug usage includes heroin (mostly 
smoked) and cocaine (snorted).  Local authorities have reported an increased prevalence of 
amphetamine-type stimulants (ATS) and intravenous drugs.  Other than marijuana, locally 
consumed drugs enter Liberia via commercial aircraft, maritime vessels, and across land borders 
by foot and vehicle traffic.  Drug use among the country’s youth population is a growing public 
concern. 
 
B.  Drug Control Accomplishments, Policies, and Trends 
 
 
 
1.  Institutional Development  
 
Local law enforcement agencies, including the Liberia National Police (LNP), Coast Guard, 
National Security Agency, and the Liberian Drug Enforcement Agency (LDEA), work in 
concert to fight drug trafficking in Liberia.  Established Nigerian criminal networks operate 
within Liberia, some of which traffic drugs.  Local authorities are aware of the threat and are 
working with the United States and other international partners to prevent illicit criminal 
networks from gaining a stronger foothold.   
 
During 2018, the LDEA made a number of interdictions and arrests of drug traffickers based 
upon intelligence and international cooperation.  Drug seizures have increased from a few 
grams of drugs on a single user to multi-kilogram seizures and arrests of international drug 
traffickers.  This is a significant change, as prior to 2013, the LDEA did not have the capacity to 
perform the basic investigations and surveillance necessary to obtain warrants, maintain chain 
of custody, and present a proper case in court.  
 
Since 2014, when the LDEA Act and a Controlled Drugs and Substances Act came into effect, 
Liberian pursuit and prosecution of drug trafficking has increased.  In 2015, 107 individuals 
were arrested under the new Anti-Drug Law with seven indictments; in 2016, there were 70 
arrests with 24 indictments leading to 20 prosecutions.  In 2017, there were 88 arrests with 11 
indictments and 10 prosecutions, leading to a cumulative total of 76 years of imprisonment.  
During the first 10 months of 2018, there were 83 arrests with nine indictments and four 
prosecutions.  The decline in indictments and prosecutions in 2018 can be attributed to the 
December 2017 election of a new President who spent several months staffing his 
administration.  Notably, in December of 2016, the LDEA facilitated the transfer and arrest of a 
Pakistani heroin dealer wanted by the U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration, which resulted in 


INCSR 2019 Volume 1  
 
 
 
 
Country Reports 
208 
 
in his conviction in a U.S. court in May 2018.  Many of the effective interdictions and seizures 
during 2018 came about because of LDEA’s increased cooperation with international partners, 
which has led to greater intelligence sharing and capacity to collect and act on intelligence. 
 
The LDEA continues to improve its operational capacity and professionalism, with such 
activities as using confidential sources; working with private businesses; initiating controlled 
deliveries; investigating international smuggling groups; and effectively working across 
Liberian government agencies.  The U.S.-Liberia extradition treaty dates from 1939 and is in 
effect, and while no mutual legal assistance treaty between Liberia and the United States exists, 
Liberia is a party to multilateral conventions that enable such cooperation. 
 
 
2.  Supply Reduction   
 
Local marijuana production is not seen as a major concern by the public, and while there is little 
information on the extent of local cannabis cultivation, or the local sales networks, marijuana is 
clearly the most widely available drug in the country. 
 
In 2018, the LDEA seized a total of approximately 4.5 metric tons (MT) of marijuana, 4.8 
kilograms (kg) of cocaine, 12.5 kg of heroin, and 6 kg of methamphetamine (a new class of 
illicit drugs just seen in Liberia over the past two years).  Also in 2018, the LDEA made 
significant progress in its fight to counter international drug trafficking through air couriers, and 
successfully interdicted six foreign nationals and seized 267 kg of khat (a traditional stimulant 
used in Northern Africa and the Arabian Peninsula), four kg of heroin, and two kg of cocaine at 
Roberts International Airport.   
 
 
3.  Public Information, Prevention, and Treatment   
 
Due to a lack of resources and capacity, the government has conducted very little drug 
prevention, rehabilitation or treatment since the 1970’s (pre-civil war), with persons with 
substance use disorders being referred to the only psychiatric hospital in Liberia or to one of the 
few non-governmental organizations (NGOs) working in the field.  A bright spot was on June 
26, when the LDEA hosted International Day Against Illicit Drugs-World Drug Day, 
logistically supported by the United States, which achieved the largest public turnout for this 
annual event since it was first held in 2003.  The event promoted drug demand reduction and 
community engagement in fighting drug abuse, underscored various enforcement efforts, and 
highlighted Liberian inter-agency security cooperation to combat drug trafficking and 
transnational crime.  The 2018 event culminated in the public destruction (burning) of seized 
drugs, an action widely covered in the media as it demonstrated a new level of transparency.  
The LDEA destroyed 4.38 MT of marijuana, 4.9 kg of cocaine and 12.3 kg of heroin at this 
event. 
 
 
4.  Corruption  
 
The Government of Liberia does not encourage or facilitate the production or distribution of 
illicit drugs, nor the laundering of proceeds from illegal drug transactions, as a matter of policy.   
  


INCSR 2019 Volume 1  
 
 
 
 
Country Reports 
209 
 
C.  National Goals, Bilateral Cooperation, and U.S. Policy Initiatives 
 
The United States is working with the Government of Liberia to fight international drug 
trafficking and reduce local demand.  Among ongoing initiatives, the United States is funding a 
$2.4 million project through the U.N Office on Drugs and Crime to enhance the capacities of 
Liberian law enforcement agencies to counter transnational crime and trafficking of drugs and 
other contraband.   While these efforts continue, U.S. assistance seeks to build the Government 
of Liberia’s capacity to develop criminal cases against international trafficking organizations 
active in the country, and encourage judicial application and attorney understanding of anti-drug 
laws.  Many of the seizures and successful cases recorded in 2018 are a direct result of 
international cooperation in countering international drug trafficking.  
 
D.  Conclusion 
 
The Government of Liberia is committed to preventing transnational criminal organizations 
from gaining a major foothold in its territory, but lacks the resources and capacity to respond 
adequately to this challenge.  Despite significant constraints, the LDEA is also working with 
other regional drug enforcement entities to exchange intelligence and information – 
collaboration that has led to the interdiction of international traffickers within Liberia's borders.  
After four years of effort to overcome institutional and political resistance, the LDEA has 
deployed to all the Liberian Ports of Entry, and given the advancements in LDEA capacity, 
judicial acceptance, and successful prosecutions, it is anticipated that 2019 will see significant 
results.  The United States will continue to support and assist Liberia’s efforts to strengthen its 
law enforcement capacities and fulfill its international drug control commitments.

Malaysia 
 
Malaysia is not a significant source country or transit point for U.S.-bound illicit drugs.  
Nevertheless, trafficking through Malaysia to supply international markets continues and 
transnational criminal organizations are attempting to expand crystal methamphetamine 
production within the country.  Drugs smuggled into Malaysia include marijuana, heroin, and 
amphetamine-type stimulants.  Synthetic drugs are also trafficked through Malaysia, including 
MDMA (ecstasy), nimetazepam (a diverted pharmaceutical drug), and crystal methamphetamine.  
There is no notable cultivation of illicit drug crops in Malaysia and local demand and 
consumption for illicit drugs is limited.  
 
Although the Royal Malaysian Police are generally effective in arresting drug offenders, 
Malaysian prosecutors have shown limited success in prosecuting and convicting drug traffickers 
as Malaysia does not have an effective drug conspiracy law.  Coupled with the high burden of 
proof required for a drug trafficking conviction, which in many cases leads to a mandatory death 
sentence, prosecutors are limited in their ability to charge and prosecute such cases.  The new 
Prime Minister, elected in May 2018, is seeking to abolish the death penalty in Malaysia, and 
currently has support in Parliament for the measure. 
 
Drug trafficking through Malaysia in 2018 remained relatively consistent with previous years.  
Overall, Malaysian authorities seized approximately $23 million worth of drugs in the first half 
of 2018, according to the latest Malaysian government statistics available, which is a 17 percent 
decrease from the same time period last year.  Arrests for supplying and possessing drugs 
decreased 2 percent and 5 percent, respectively, compared to the first half of 2018, while arrests 
for drug use, based on urinalysis, fell by 27 percent.   
 
Malaysia has an extradition treaty and mutual legal assistance treaty with the United States and is 
generally cooperative in these cases.  The United States continues to send Malaysian police for 
counter-drug training at the International Law Enforcement Academy in Bangkok.  The U.S. 
Coast Guard continued its maritime law enforcement training program with the Malaysian 
Maritime Enforcement Agency.  In 2019, the United States will seek to promote further 
coordination between Malaysian and U.S. law enforcement authorities, including joint 
interdiction efforts, information sharing, and training to further improve Malaysia's investigative 
and prosecutorial capacity.

Mali 
 
Mali is a transit point for illicit drugs trafficked mostly to Europe.  Instability and lawlessness 
stemming from the ongoing violent extremist conflict in Central and Northern Mali pose 
challenges to the government’s modest drug interdiction efforts, while offering the violent 
extremists a source of revenue by providing protection for illicit shipments.  Senior officials have 
requested international assistance in both interdiction and in combatting the growing domestic 
use of illicit drugs in the country.    
 
The Ministry of Security has a dedicated office for drug control, the interagency Central 
Narcotics Office, with approximately 140 officers, detailed from the Police, Immigration, 
Gendarmes and Customs services.  Although the ministry maintains a number of international 
liaison relationships, regional drug control cooperation is virtually non-existent.    
 
Drug trafficking is concentrated along the southern and western Malian borders.  Mali’s 4,500 
miles of borders are mostly unpatrolled, and the movement of almost all goods is unregulated.  
Illicit drugs have also been trafficked through the country by aerial conveyance, though on a 
lesser scale.  
 
There is a growing concern from Mali’s government and traditional and religious leaders over 
the growing use of illicit drugs among the population, primarily among young people.  
Consumption of methamphetamine, flunitrazepam, and the synthetic opioid tramadol is growing, 
fueled by high employment and low costs.  
 
Corruption among counterdrug officials is a concern, and the United States supports a number of 
on-going security and governance programs to address this matter.   
 
Mali and the United States share common goals of reducing the use and traffic of illicit drugs, 
and in denying violent extremists access to revenue from the sale of such contraband.  The 
United States is increasing its efforts to work with Mali to combat the illicit flow of drugs 
through the country, as well as work with the government on domestic efforts to reduce demand 
for dangerous drugs.

Mexico 
 
A.  Introduction 
 
Mexico is a significant source and transit country for heroin, marijuana, and synthetic drugs 
destined for the United States and a main transit country for cocaine from South America.  
Mexico is a source of illicit opium poppy and believed to be the primary source of heroin to the 
U.S. domestic market.  Mexico is also a main transit route for fentanyl originating from China.  
Drug trafficking and its related violence and corruption in Mexico pose considerable problems to 
citizen security and economic development.  According to the Mexican government, murders 
increased 19 percent nationally (to 27 murders per 100,000 residents) during the first eight 
months of 2018 compared to the same period in 2017.   
 
The Merida Initiative is the U.S. government’s primary mechanism to implement civilian 
security assistance in Mexico.  Merida Initiative projects disrupt transnational criminal 
organizations and hinder their ability to produce and traffic drugs to the United States.  
Assistance includes training and equipment to dismantle clandestine drug labs; a poppy 
eradication tracking program; advanced airport security technology; inspection equipment for 
border crossings and checkpoints; and reconnaissance technologies to improve maritime 
interdiction.  The United States also provides security assistance for drug interdiction equipment 
and training to military and law enforcement personnel.   
 
B.  Drug Control Accomplishments, Policies, and Trends 
 
1.  Institutional Development 
 
On July 1, Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador of the National Regeneration Movement party 
(MORENA) won Mexico’s presidential election with 53 percent of the vote.  The new 
administration has expressed a commitment to reducing crime and violence, including through 
the creation of a new Public Security Ministry, increased investigation and prosecution of 
financial crimes, and cannabis legalization and regulation as a purported crime-reduction 
measure.  Mexico’s 2018 federal budget for justice and national and domestic security increased 
6.2 percent compared to 2017.   
 
Mexico is party to several legal agreements relevant to drug control, including the Inter-
American Convention on Mutual Assistance in Criminal Matters, the 1996 Anti-Drug Strategy, 
and the 1990 Ixtapa Declaration and Program of Action.  Mexico is a regional observer in the 
Central American Integration System and participates with Canada and the United States in the 
North American Maritime Security Initiative to share information, improve response to 
transnational threats, and develop protocols for maritime interdictions.  Mexico participates with 
the United States and Canada in the North American Dialogue on Drug Policy.  The current 
U.S.-Mexico extradition treaty has been in force since 1980, and Mexico remains one of the 
United States’ strongest extradition partners.  Moreover, a bilateral mutual legal assistance treaty 
in force since 1991 fosters a broad range of cooperation in criminal matters.

The U.S. government estimates opium poppy cultivation in Mexico reached 44,100 hectares (ha) 
in 2017, an increase from 32,000 ha in 2016.  Most poppy cultivation occurred in the states of 
Sinaloa, Chihuahua, Durango, and Guerrero.  A team from the Mexican Attorney General’s 
Office (PGR), Army (SEDENA), Navy (SEMAR), Foreign Ministry (SRE), and the United 
Nations Office on Drugs and Crime (UNODC) is working on a new opium yield study with the 
support of the U.S. government to estimate heroin production.  The United States is supporting 
the project with equipment donations and is collaborating closely with the Mexican government 
to use the yield study data to establish mutually agreed upon production estimates. 
 
PGR’s National Center for Planning, Analysis, and Information to Combat Organized Crime 
(PGR/CENAPI) publishes drug eradication and seizure statistics for civilian law enforcement 
agencies.  According to PGR/CENAPI, in calendar year 2017, Mexico eradicated 4,231 ha of 
marijuana and 29,207 ha of opium poppy.  During the first six months of 2018, Mexico 
eradicated 1,162 ha of cannabis and 17,288 ha of opium poppy.  In calendar year 2017, Mexico 
reportedly seized approximately 12.6 MT of cocaine; 416 MT of marijuana; 34,841 cannabis 
fields; 766.9 kilograms (kg) of opium gum; 202,279 poppy fields; 11.3 MT of 
methamphetamine; 356 kg of heroin; and 103 clandestine laboratories.  During the first six 
months of 2018, Mexico reportedly seized approximately 5.53 MT of cocaine; 110.7 MT of 
marijuana; 16,267 cannabis fields; 38.5 kg of opium gum; 149,357 poppy fields; 6.3 MT of 
methamphetamine; 316 kg of heroin; and 37 clandestine laboratories.   
 
The United States supports SEMAR, SEDENA, the Federal Police, Customs (SAT), and PGR 
with intelligence, training, and specialized equipment.  In August, SEMAR seized and destroyed 
more than 130 MT of processed methamphetamine and more than 29,000 liters and 10,000 kg of 
precursor chemicals from multiple clandestine laboratories and underground storage facilities in 
Sinaloa and Durango.  SEMAR used equipment and training provided by DEA under the Merida 
Initiative to handle and destroy the chemicals on site.   
 
Since January 2018, SEMAR has seen a significant increase in maritime seizures, capturing 11.4 
MT of cocaine, almost all of it in the Eastern Pacific.  The U.S. government supported the 
seizures through information-sharing and foreign assistance efforts, including four CASA 235 
aircraft with U.S.-managed intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance (ISR) upgrades.  The 
ISR-enabled video systems will generate inalterable aerial footage, making it a possible source of 
evidence for use in court proceedings.  The United States recently completed upgrades to four 
SEMAR Maritime Patrol Aircraft, and is supporting SEMAR interdiction and information 
gathering efforts.   
 
During the first nine months of 2018, U.S. Customs and Border Protection seized 151 kg of 
fentanyl at U.S. southwest border ports of entry.  In April, officials in Tijuana seized 361 small 
fentanyl packets that had been prepared for street-level distribution.  In August, a Merida-
donated canine team discovered 2.6 kg of fentanyl pills and 1.1 kg of crystal methamphetamine 
during an inspection at a commercial shipping office in Jalisco.  In September, Baja California 
State Police uncovered a suspected carfentanil pill production mill (carfentanil is a fentanyl 
analogue and up to100 times as potent).  At the site, police found precursor chemicals and a 
kilogram of suspected carfentanil.

Canines donated through the Merida Initiative to Mexico made significant seizures of illicit 
drugs in 2018, including fentanyl.  In May, Merida-donated canines discovered 25 liters of 
chemical precursor and 450 liters of hydrochloric acid at parcel companies in Durango and 
Guadalajara.  In July, a Merida-donated canine team located 1,280 liters of sulfuric acid at a 
parcel company in Guadalajara, and 4.9 kg of methamphetamine during an inspection in 
Michoacan.   
 
In 2018, Mexican officials consolidated oversight of counterdrug efforts under a new Office of 
National Drug Policy (ONPD) within PGR.   
 
3.  Public Information, Prevention, and Treatment 
 
In 2018, Mexico’s National Commission Against Addictions (CONADIC) released official 
results from a national survey of drug, alcohol, and tobacco usage.  The study showed overall 
marijuana use at 8.6 percent (up from 6 percent in 2011); stable cocaine use at 3.5 percent; 
inhalants at 1.1 percent; and amphetamine-type stimulants at 0.9 percent.  There was no 
indication of domestic fentanyl use in Mexico.   
 
The United States supports the implementation of court-supervised treatment for criminal 
offenders with drug use problems in Mexico.  Currently, six Mexican states operate 30 drug 
treatment courts including six juvenile courts, all of which receive training and assistance from 
the Merida Initiative to facilitate court-supervised drug treatment and social reinsertion. 
 
4.  Corruption 
 
As a matter of government policy, Mexico does not encourage or facilitate illicit drug production 
or distribution, nor is it involved in laundering the proceeds of the sale of illicit drugs.  
Nevertheless, corruption continues to impede Mexican drug control efforts.  Mexico’s National 
Anti-Corruption System seeks to address impunity for corruption, but implementation is not yet 
complete.  The Senate has not yet appointed a special anticorruption prosecutor or approved the 
selection of the 18 administrative judges charged with ruling on corruption cases.   
 
A joint working group between the new Lopez Obrador administration and civil society is 
devoted to transforming the PGR into a new Fiscalia General de la Republica, which would 
make the Attorney General’s Office autonomous from the Presidency.  In September, MORENA 
submitted a bill to congress that would allot one year for the transition from PGR to the new

A number of high-ranking government officials faced corruption-related charges in 2018, 
including five former governors currently in custody on pre-trial detention.  A sixth, former 
Veracruz Governor Javier Duarte, pleaded guilty to criminal association and money laundering 
charges in September and received a sentence of nine years.  Federal and state authorities have 
opened corruption investigations into former Governor of Nayarit Roberto Sandoval and former 
Governor of Veracruz Flavino Rios.  In total, nearly 20 former governors have been sentenced, 
face corruption charges, or are under formal investigation.

C.  National Goals, Bilateral Cooperation, and U.S. Policy Initiatives 
 
The Merida Initiative is the primary driver of bilateral security cooperation, and it plays a key 
role in addressing the U.S. opioid epidemic through its efforts to stop illicit opioids from being 
produced in Mexico and trafficked into the United States.  The U.S. government works closely 
with multiple federal and state agencies of the Mexican government on fentanyl detection and 
seizure.  The Merida Initiative supports training for Mexico’s fentanyl response teams and for 
canines and handlers on fentanyl detection; gas chromatography machines for the PGR forensics 
laboratory to test unknown drug samples; and non-intrusive inspection equipment to help 
interdict the transportation of fentanyl and other illicit items.   
 
In February 2018, experts from the Royal Canadian Mounted Police (RCMP), with funding from 
the Merida Initiative, provided canine fentanyl detection training in Mexico City.  RCMP trained 
canine teams from the Federal Police and SAT; subsequent training in October focused on 
SEDENA and PGR canine programs.  In July, the Nogales Border Patrol Station and the 
Consulate General Nogales’ Regional Security Office conducted a fentanyl class for 34 Mexican 
law enforcement officials, including federal and state police and customs officials.  In August, 
DEA opioid and synthetic drug experts provided fentanyl awareness and processing procedures 
training to 70 officers of the Sonora State Police.   
 
As of August, the Government of Mexico had deployed a U.S.-funded biometric data sharing 
program  in all of its 52 migration processing stations.  The program supports Mexico’s ability to 
detect threats and has vastly improved Mexico’s capability to partner with U.S. law enforcement 
to dismantle transnational criminal organizations and impove border control.  As of October, 
authorities had identified hundreds of gang members and drug traffickers. 
 
In Mexico City, the bilateral Drug Policy Working Group has taken the lead to operationalize 
agreements reached at the 2017 cabinet-level meetings of the “Strategic Dialogue on Disrupting 
Transnational Criminal Organizations” and the “Security Cooperation Group” (a sub-cabinet 
group with participants from more than 20 U.S. and Mexican federal agencies).  The working 
group met for the fourth time in January 2018, headed by the Embassy Mexico City’s Deputy 
Chief of Mission and PGR.  The group focuses on implementing projects to diminish illicit drug 
production, enhance interdiction efforts, and share best practices to respond to drug demand in 
both countries. 
 
D.  Conclusion 
 
Drug trafficking, corruption, and related violence remain substantial challenges for citizen 
security in Mexico.  The United States will continue to look for opportunities to enhance bilateral 
cooperation and work toward achieving shared goals through effective targeting of transnational 
criminal networks, opium poppy eradication, improved interdiction of illicit drugs, and 
cooperation against money laundering in both countries.

Morocco 
 
Morocco is one of the top cannabis and hashish-producing countries of the world, with Europe 
being a primary market.  Traffickers may be decreasing the use of commercialized containers for 
smuggling activity due to the deployment of x-ray scanners at the port of Tangier, and increasing 
the use of “go-fast” boats and non-commercial airplanes to smuggle drugs into Spain.  
Traffickers may also be expanding internal routes by moving hashish south and then to 
Morocco’s coast for non-commercial maritime shipment to Europe or overland shipment to 
African markets.  Moroccan hashish is also smuggled south into Mauritania, and then moved east 
across Mali and Niger into Libya for onward transshipment and distribution.     
 
Over the past decade, Moroccan cannabis farmers have substituted traditional seeds with hybrid 
strains capable of producing larger yields and higher tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) levels.  Yields 
obtained from hybrid seeds and improved agricultural techniques are three to five times higher 
than those obtained from traditional cannabis farming methods.  Media and U.S. law 
enforcement reporting indicates that the switch to hybrid seeds was driven by market forces as 
European customers demanded a higher quality THC product.  Accurate estimates for cannabis 
cultivation and hashish production levels are not available.   
 
Morocco remains a transit point for the commercial and non-commercial maritime shipment of 
cocaine smuggled into Europe.  South American and Mexican drug trafficking organizations 
utilize West Africa as a transit point for cocaine smuggled into the European market, and 
Morocco remains a key transit point for this route.  Transnational criminal organizations take 
advantage of Morocco’s pre-existing hashish transportation networks to facilitate the flow of 
cocaine from West Africa to Europe.  During 2018, a coordinated operation between the U.S. 
Drug Enforcement Administration and Morocco law enforcement dismantled a commercial 
maritime operation smuggling cocaine from Brazil to Europe via containerized shipping 
transiting the port of Casablanca, arresting one Brazilian and five Moroccans.  Six vehicles, 541 
kilograms of cocaine, and approximately $1.5 million were seized.  Media reports indicate 
Moroccan hashish continues to be smuggled to South America and the Caribbean in exchange 
for cocaine transported to Europe for distribution.   
 
The United States has a mutual legal assistance treaty with Morocco that entered into force in 
1993.  The U.S. does not have an extradition treaty with Morocco, but Morocco has been willing 
to surrender fugitives to the United States via deportation, expulsion, or otherwise lawful 
removal pursuant to its domestic law.

Mozambique 
 
Mozambique continues to be a transit point for heroin, hashish, cocaine, and precursor 
chemicals.  Transnational criminal organizations based in Asia and South America use 
Mozambique as a transit hub both to access the South African market and to move products 
through neighboring countries to their final destinations in Europe and North America.  Cocaine 
transiting through Mozambique from South America is also becoming more prevalent given the 
ease of access.  Resource constraints, endemic corruption, its long coastline, and porous 
unguarded land borders hamper drug control efforts in Mozambique.  
 
Criminal organizations exploit Mozambique’s vast, largely unpatrolled coastline.  Heroin and 
hashish are primarily imported via maritime shipments from South Asia.  Shipments arrive 
hidden in cargo containers or on ships anchored illegally off Mozambique’s coastline where they 
are off-loaded onto smaller watercraft.  Cocaine from South America arrives via commercial 
flights, transported by courier, or hidden in air cargo.  Once in the country, illicit drugs can easily 
be warehoused and transported via the national highway system to any of six neighboring 
countries.  Access to major international air and cargo hubs both in Mozambique and South 
Africa allow for further international distribution.   
 
The U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) has established a working relationship with 
the office of the Attorney General (PGR) and Mozambique’s National Criminal Investigations 
Service (SERNIC).  SERNIC investigates and prosecutes all major criminal activity in 
Mozambique.  In 2018, SERNIC agreed to establish a joint DEA/SERNIC drug investigative 
unit to combat transnational organized crime.  The primary objective of this bilateral cooperation 
is to increase Mozambique’s law enforcement capacity and promote future sustainability.  
 
Although systemic challenges remain, SERNIC executed two significant arrests of well-known 
international heroin brokers.  Notably, in addition to indicting the suspects on drug-related 
charges, the PGR identified and evaluated evidence of official corruption.  As a result, 
investigators expect those involved will be penalized and additional arrests will be made, serving 
as a good example of the Government of Mozambique’s political will to confront drug-related 
crime and corruption.   
 
The United States has neither a bilateral mutual legal assistance treaty nor an extradition treaty 
with Mozambique.  Some mutual legal assistance requests are processed under multilateral 
conventions that enable such cooperation.

The Netherlands  
 
The Netherlands is a significant transit country for illicit drugs, especially cocaine, entering 
through the port of Rotterdam.  The Netherlands also remains an important source country of 
synthetic drugs, primarily MDMA (ecstasy), destined for international markets.  The volume of 
internet-facilitated trafficking of synthetic drugs through the country has increased significantly.  
  
The Dutch Opium Act prohibits the possession, commercial distribution, production, preparation 
of production, import, and export of all illicit drugs.  The act distinguishes between “hard” drugs 
(e.g., heroin, cocaine, MDMA), and “soft” drugs (cannabis products).  Sales of less than five 
grams of cannabis products are “tolerated” (illegal but not prosecuted) in regulated 
establishments called “coffee shops.”  Enforcement is a local matter; for example, some cities 
choose to implement a requirement limiting coffee shop purchases to local residents, while 
others, including Amsterdam, do not.  
  
A study by the police estimated that the total revenue of synthetic drugs production in the 
Netherlands in 2017 was close to 20 billion euros.  Synthetic drug producers are considered to be 
at the source of various other types of crime, including local government corruption, especially 
in the south of the Netherlands.  The national government prioritized fighting organized drugs 
groups.  
  
Dutch police and mail delivery companies established a Mail/Parcel Intervention Team (PIT) in 
2017 to intercept outbound envelopes and parcels containing small amounts of drugs. 
  
The port of Rotterdam is a European import hub for cocaine from South America.  In 2017 (the 
most recent year for which data is available), authorities seized 5.3 metric tons of cocaine in the 
port of Rotterdam.  However, due to increased efforts by authorities, Dutch drug smuggling 
gangs increasingly use the port of Antwerp as a point of entry.  There have been incidents of 
fraud and corruption within the port authority and associated businesses.    
  
Historically, Dutch and U.S. law enforcement agencies have maintained close operational 
cooperation, but due to a recent reorganization of the Dutch police and capacity issues, there has 
been a significant decrease in the exchange of information.  The United States and the 
Netherlands have fully operational extradition and mutual legal assistance agreements.  
  
The Royal Netherlands Navy patrols the Dutch Caribbean for drug interdiction operations.  The 
Netherlands has a memorandum of understanding with the United States, which enables the 
deployment of U.S. Coast Guard Law Enforcement Detachment Teams and Airborne Use of 
Force Detachments on Royal Netherlands Navy vessels to suppress illicit trafficking in the 
waters of the Caribbean.  The Netherlands is a party to the Caribbean Regional Maritime 
Agreement and a partner in the U.S. Joint Interagency Task Force South.  The Netherlands is a 
member of the Maritime Analysis and Operation Centre-Narcotics.

Nicaragua 
 
A.  Introduction  
  
Nicaragua remains a transit route for illicit drug trafficking, and domestic production of 
marijuana also occurs in the country.  Nicaragua’s long Atlantic and Pacific coasts, large inland 
lakes, porous border crossings, and sparsely populated and underdeveloped Caribbean coastal 
region provide a favorable environment for international criminal groups to smuggle contraband, 
including drugs, weapons, currency, and people.  Although there is no statistical data to 
determine current drug consumption trends within Nicaragua, marijuana and crack cocaine are 
believed to be the most commonly consumed illicit drugs within the country.  
  
Nicaragua does not have sufficient resources to exercise complete control over its air, land, and 
sea borders.  Nicaragua’s limited technical and logistical capacity to conduct successful 
interdiction operations, including a lack of dedicated air assets, is further challenged by limited 
mobility and communications to patrol the sparsely populated parts of the Caribbean region 
where some traffickers operate freely.  
 
Nicaragua’s efforts to fight drug trafficking are hindered by widespread corruption 
within the ranks of the police, the prosecutor general’s office, and the supreme court.  Drug 
control cooperation between Nicaraguan authorities and international counterparts is limited and 
inconsistent, and all levels of government lack transparency. 
  
B.  Drug Control Accomplishments, Policies, and Trends  
  
 
1.  Institutional Development  
  
The Nicaraguan National Police and Nicaraguan military are the primary institutions responsible 
for countering drug trafficking in the country.  There is limited information sharing between the 
two institutions and there is limited law enforcement coverage of the country, particularly in the 
sparsely populated Caribbean Coast region.  The Nicaraguan military continues to target illicit 
drugs through its “Retaining Wall” strategy, which incorporates land-based, air, and maritime 
patrolling from permanent bases located at key border crossings and maritime and air routes.  
Coupled with limited resources, however, the principal challenge for Nicaraguan authorities in 
2018 was the politicization of the police and the restive political climate resulting from the 
government’s harsh repression of widespread protests.  
      
On August 23, the Government of Nicaragua appointed Francisco Diaz, who was sanctioned by 
the United States under the Global Magnitsky Act, as the new National Police Director.  Diaz 
was sanctioned due to his involvement in serious human rights abuses against political 
opponents.  According to local security experts, a police unit tasked with anti-organized crime 
responsibilities is also involved in grave violations of human rights, including illegal detentions 
of protestors.  The police promoted 452 officers of this unit in September.  
 
Nicaragua maintains close ties with Russia.  In April, Russia trained 20 police officers from 
Central America, Mexico, and the Dominican Republic at a Russian Counternarcotics Training 


INCSR 2019 Volume 1  
 
 
 
 
Country Reports 
220 
 
Center in Managua, but the effectiveness of cooperation agreements with Russia against drug 
trafficking is not yet visible.  Also in April, the Nicaraguan and Honduran military forces signed 
a cooperation agreement to continue joint operations and maintain security levels in both 
countries; however, a lack of vetted units, limited information sharing, lack of transparency, and 
limited working-level cooperation hinder regional operation efforts against organized crime and 
drug trafficking. 
  
Nicaragua participates in the Cooperative Situational and Information Integration System, which 
enables greater international law enforcement intelligence sharing.  A maritime counterdrug 
bilateral agreement has also been in place between Nicaragua and the United States since 2001.  
However, information sharing from Nicaragua is limited, and often not accurate or timely.   
  
The Inter-American Convention on Mutual Legal Assistance in Criminal Matters, to which 
Nicaragua and the United States are both parties, facilitates the sharing of legal information 
between countries.  In spite of being part of this treaty, cooperation in this area is not robust due 
to the low volume of requests.  In the past, the Government of Nicaragua has rarely provided 
assistance within requested time frames.  
 
The United States and Nicaragua are parties to an extradition treaty signed in 1905 and ratified in 
1907, but the Nicaraguan Constitution bars the extradition of Nicaraguan citizens.  Cooperation 
by the Government of Nicaragua with extradition requests has historically been very limited.  An 
International Criminal Police Organization Red Notice is usually required for wanted individuals 
in order for the Government of Nicaragua to cooperate with the United States in expelling non-
Nicaraguan citizen fugitives.    
 
  
2.  Supply Reduction  
  
There was no discernible change in the volume of drugs transiting Nicaragua in 2018.  However, 
there continues to be evidence of increased domestic drug use, increased illegal drug production 
(mainly of marijuana), and the existence of clandestine airstrips in remote areas of the country.  
Though some traffickers continue to smuggle illicit drugs through the isolated Caribbean Coast, 
many trafficking organizations have shifted their operations to deep-water routes off the Pacific 
Coast using larger, longer-range transportation.  This allows larger quantities of drugs to travel 
further out to sea, avoiding detection by law enforcement and the threat of pirates in the 
Caribbean regions.  
  
Illicit drugs are also trafficked via land and air.  Beginning in April 2018, drug trafficking 
organizations changed their routes due to roadblocks raised during the political unrest. 
Traffickers temporarily utilized more sea vessels and aircraft as alternatives, but at the close of 
2018 there was evidence that traffickers were slowly returning to land routes.  
 
The Nicaraguan government reported that it conducted 4,416 operations targeting local and 
international drug trafficking in 2018, a 44 percent reduction from the 7,833 operations 
conducted in 2017.  The government also reported seizing 2.58 metric tons (MT) of cocaine 
during the first nine months of 2018, a 46 percent decrease from the 4.8 MT seized in all 2017.  
The Nicaraguan Navy reported seizing 725 kilograms of the total cocaine seized in the country.  


INCSR 2019 Volume 1  
 
 
 
 
Country Reports 
221 
 
Authorities also reportedly seized 1.58 MT of marijuana; destroyed 36,821 cannabis plants 
growing along the country’s Caribbean Coast; and seized $11,263,060 in cash, 295 vehicles, 150 
weapons, 926 communications devices, and four boats.  Authorities reportedly arrested 2,305 
people for drug crimes (1,138 of whom had been formally accused in court as of October).  
Nicaraguan authorities do not share with U.S. officials any information about their methods of 
destroying seized illicit drugs. 
   
 
3.  Public Information, Prevention, and Treatment  
 
There are no reliable national statistics on drug consumption within Nicaragua, but there are 
anecdotal reports of increased use of marijuana, crack, and powder cocaine, especially in the 
Caribbean Coast regions and among adolescents.  The lack of statistics makes it difficult to 
measure the impact of prevention and treatment programs.  
  
The Government of Nicaragua reports that the Nicaraguan National Police, in coordination with 
the Ministry of Education, the Institute Against Alcoholism and Drug Addiction, rehabilitation 
centers, and other government institutions, provided drug prevention education for 12,167 youths 
in 164 schools in 2018.  In 2018 the government reached only 5 percent of the 240,000 youth 
reached in 2017, and only 1 percent of the school age population.  The Nicaraguan government 
also reported offering drug prevention activities for 19,201 young people with substance use 
disorders and 648 juvenile offenders, to include educational movie screenings, prevention talks, 
neighborhood meetings, as well as marches, sports, and cultural activities to raise awareness and 
to prevent violence and drug use.  
  
The police have cooperation agreements with 14 of the 22 privately run drug rehabilitation 
centers, to which they refer substance abusers.  In 2018, the government referred 134 youth to 
the 14 centers.  According to administrators at private rehabilitation centers, as a result of the 
socio-political unrest, there is an exponential increase in requests for rehabilitation for young 
people between 15-25 years of age. 
  
Private treatment centers in Nicaragua offer two models of patient service: outpatient and 
residential.  Free treatment centers are scarce in Nicaragua, and some treatment centers charge a 
high monthly fee between $2,000 and $3,000 per patient.  Non-governmental organizations 
continue efforts to prevent drug use and provide treatment to those suffering from substance 
abuse.  The United States provides support to fund programs focused on citizen security, drug 
prevention, and life skills for at-risk youth, including a grant for a multi-media drug and violence 
prevention campaign that has reached more than one million people. 
  
 
4.  Corruption  
  
The Government of Nicaragua does not, as a matter of government policy, encourage or facilitate 
illicit drug production or distribution, and there were no public indications that it is involved in 
laundering the proceeds of the sale of illicit drugs. 
  
Nicaragua’s close relationship with Venezuela, reports of institutional corruption at all levels, 
and international claims that officials in Nicaragua were complicit in money laundering are of 


INCSR 2019 Volume 1  
 
 
 
 
Country Reports 
222 
 
concern.  In December 2017, the U.S. Department of Treasury sanctioned Roberto Rivas under 
Global Magnitsky authority for corruption.  Rivas was serving as President of the Supreme 
Electoral Council.  The Office of the Controller General of Nicaragua failed to investigate his 
corruption and the origin of his considerable personal wealth. 
  
The head of a counterdrug patrol, who had been sentenced to an 11-year prison term for killing a 
woman and two children during a failed  operation in July 2015, was promoted in September 
2018 to the rank of Commissioner and decorated for “heroic actions” while supposedly in 
prison.  
 
Although Nicaragua’s criminal law contains provisions against corruption such as bribery, abuse 
of authority, influence peddling, and embezzlement, the politicization of and corruption within 
the police and the judicial system hinder meaningful prosecution of serious crimes.  There is also 
a law regarding the investigation and prosecution of organized crime (Law 735), but in 2018 it 
was used to criminalize government opponents.  Law 735 provides for the establishment of a unit 
to administer seized assets; however, there is no public accountability in how seized assets are 
managed.  In 2018, the government did not enforce criminal laws against corruption; instead, 
there was impunity for corrupt officials loyal to the ruling political party.  
 
C.  National Goals, Bilateral Cooperation, and U.S. Policy Initiatives 
  
Bilateral drug control cooperation between Nicaragua and the United States is limited and 
inconsistent.  However, the Nicaraguan government has demonstrated some willingness to take 
action on information about drug-related activities provided by the U.S. Drug Enforcement 
Administration (DEA).  Information provided by DEA to Nicaraguan authorities resulted in 
successful interdiction of 2.3 MT of cocaine and $12.7 million in cash in 2018.  The United 
States also supported the participation of two police officers at the International Drug 
Enforcement Conference in 2018 to strengthen regional interoperability, and continues to support 
the integration and active participation of Nicaragua into the Cooperative Situational and 
Information Integration System. 
  
The United States cooperates with the Nicaraguan Navy to enhance maritime interdiction 
capacity.  In 2018, the United States provided equipment to support drug interdiction, 
refurbished four boats and trailers, and provided parts for two additional boats at a total cost of 
$600,753. 
  
In 2018, consistent with U.S. policy to reduce the flow of illegal drugs to the United States and 
improve security in Central America, the United States assisted Nicaragua by funding drug 
demand reduction programs with non-governmental organizations.  The programs are 
implemented in the North and South Caribbean Autonomous Regions, the Managua area, and 
some departments on the Pacific side of the country, where populations are vulnerable to drugs 
and violence.  These grant projects have served to increase citizen security through drug 
prevention awareness campaigns, community development, youth leadership training, and 
alternative education intervention programs for at-risk youth in Nicaragua. 
 


INCSR 2019 Volume 1  
 
 
 
 
Country Reports 
223 
 
The United States maintains a bilateral agreement with Nicaragua to suppress illicit traffic by 
sea, which includes provisions regarding ship boarding, ship riders, pursuit, entry into territorial 
waters, overflight, order to land, and international maritime interdiction support.  Nicaragua was 
a participant in the semi-annual Multilateral Maritime Counter Drug Summit held in May, which 
attracted 125 maritime counterdrug professionals from 26 countries and over 65 international 
agencies spanning North, Central, and South America and Europe.    
  
D.  Conclusion  
  
The Government of Nicaragua has developed policies and programs to combat drug trafficking 
and reduce drug demand, but should improve its efforts to combat organized crime by expanding 
its capacity to monitor air, land, and maritime space within the vulnerable Caribbean Coast and 
Pacific border regions of the country.  Productive and more transparent efforts to combat 
organized crime would require a change in government policy, a political commitment to fight 
corruption, and the professionalization of the police, as well as halting the counterproductive 
diversion of police resources to the repression of peaceful protesters.

Niger 
 
Niger is a transit point for illicit drug trafficking and is also experiencing a rapidly expanding 
drug consumption problem.  Instability stemming from ongoing violent extremist conflict in the 
country’s southern and western regions, as well as instability in Libya to the North – all pose 
challenges to the government’s drug interdiction efforts.    
 
Illicit drug trafficking is concentrated along Niger’s southern border with Nigeria, as well as 
within Northern Niger and the city of Agadez.  The National Police of Niger have a dedicated 
counterdrug unit, the Central Office for the Suppression of Illicit Traffic in Narcotic Drugs, 
consisting of approximately 100 officers.   
    
Transnational criminal organizations are involved in trafficking drugs through Niger.  Illicit 
opioids and other pharmaceutical drugs are readily available, as are cannabis and hashish 
originating from Morocco.  The Government of Niger and civil society leaders are increasingly 
concerned with growing illicit drug use among the population, primarily among youth.  
Consumption of methamphetamine, flunitrazepam, and the synthetic opioid tramadol is growing, 
fueled by high unemployment and low costs.   
 
The director of the National Police and other security officials have identified illicit proceeds 
from the drug trade as corrosive to their respective organizations.  The United States has several 
programs to assist the Government of Niger in addressing corruption, operational planning, and 
improving border management, through support to the border police known as the Directorate of 
Territorial Surveillance (Direction de la Surveillance du Territoire).

Nigeria 
 
A.  Introduction 
 
Nigerian drug traffickers remain the preeminent international drug trafficking threat based in 
Africa.  Nigerian trafficking networks operate in the United States as well as throughout Africa, 
South America, Europe, and Asia.  Nigerian drug traffickers have strengthened partnerships with 
international cocaine and heroin distribution networks to procure and distribute significant 
quantities of drugs in the United States and other lucrative markets.   
 
Nigeria is also experiencing an opioid epidemic.  The most widely used opioid in Nigeria is 
tramadol, a pharmaceutical product originating mostly from India.  Both legitimate Indian 
pharmaceutical companies and illicit clandestine labs mass-produce and ship tramadol and 
counterfeit tramadol tablets in 200, 225, and 250-milligram dosages for the Nigerian market.  
Members of the Nigerian Customs Service (NCS) regularly interdict container loads of tramadol 
at Apapa Port in Lagos based on intelligence from the National Drug Law Enforcement Agency 
(NDLEA).  The NCS declines to release the tramadol to NDLEA for destruction, and NDLEA 
reports that NCS officers frequently sell seized tramadol back to its original owners.  Codeine is 
also widely abused, particularly by women in northern Nigeria. 
 
B.  Drug Control Accomplishments, Policies, and Trends  
 
1. Institutional Development 
 
During 2018, the NDLEA received a major boost in capacity following the complete 
refurbishment of the NDLEA Murtala Muhammed International Airport (MMIA) Command 
office building into a state-of-the-art complex, which is now the site of the newly formed Joint 
Border Task Force (JBTF).  The $10 million JBTF project is mostly funded and overseen by the 
United Kingdom’s National Crime Agency (NCA).  The JBTF is a multi-agency effort to target, 
interdict, disrupt, dismantle, and prosecute Nigerian-based transnational criminal organizations.  
The task force, a joint endeavor supported by both the United States and the United Kingdom, is 
comprised of fully vetted and well-trained Nigerian law enforcement investigators.  MMIA is 
viewed as the gateway for Nigerian criminal organizations involved in drug smuggling, as well 
as the movement of unlawful proceeds; human trafficking/smuggling; wildlife trafficking; 
weapons trafficking; and an array of other illegal cross-border activity.  The NDLEA is the lead 
agency at the JBTF, contributing 140 officers and investigators who receive mentoring and 
investigative assistance from U.S. and UK law enforcement professionals embedded within the 
unit.  The task force is further comprised of 20 investigative officers from the National Agency 
for the Prohibition of Trafficking of Persons (NAPTIP), as well as six prosecutors. 
 
2. Supply Reduction 
 
In 2018, the United States continued to assist in transitioning the NDLEA from a reactive agency 
to an intelligence-driven one through mentoring and investigative support.  During the first eight 
months of 2018, the NDLEA reported the arrests of 4,736 individuals on drug trafficking charges 
(4,395 men and 341 women).  The agency seized approximately 59 metric tons (MT) of 


INCSR 2019 Volume 1  
 
 
 
 
Country Reports 
226 
 
cannabis; 119 kilograms (kg) of methamphetamine; 17 MT of tramadol; and approximately eight 
MT of codeine-infused cough syrup.  The NDLEA reports that in 2018, the agency destroyed 
267 MT of seized drugs overall. 
 
In addition to these totals, the U.S.-supported NDLEA Sensitive Investigative Unit (SIU) is 
credited with seizing and destroying over 1,700 hectares of cannabis plantations; six-and-a-half 
MT of processed cannabis; four MT of tramadol; four kg of cocaine; and 250 kg of ephedrine.  
The SIU seized properties and financial instruments approximately totaling $2 million and 
arrested 25 drug traffickers.  Additionally, the SIU shared intelligence with counterparts in Benin 
and Japan that led to seizures of methamphetamine totaling 40 kg.  
 
3. Public Information, Prevention, and Treatment 
 
Consumption of illicit and misused drugs within Nigeria is increasing alarmingly.  The United 
Nations Office on Drugs and Crime (UNODC) has called on the government of Nigeria to 
address the growing abuse of pharmaceuticals by many Nigerian youths.  
 
While cocaine is not readily accessible to the middle and lower classes, drugs such as codeine, 
rohypnol, and tramadol are accessible and available from street vendors on the streets of every 
city and town in Nigeria.   
 
The NDLEA’s Demand Reduction Directorate nominally has programs that target youth, sex 
workers, community leaders, and transport workers.  However, resources allocated for 
counseling and rehabilitation for substance use disorders are negligible.  
 
4. Corruption 
 
A large percentage of senior government officials are engaged, either directly or indirectly, in 
corrupt practices.  In 2017 (the latest available data), the annual operating budget for the NDLEA 
was approximately $25,450,000.  Salaries alone for the 5,001 NDLEA personnel were estimated 
at approximately $24,000,000, leaving the entire organization to operate on a meager $1,450,000 
per year.  NDLEA is comprised of 42 commands that typically each receive approximately 
$2,800 per month to fund their operations, to include fuel for vehicles and generators, utilities, 
travel, and various investigative expenses.  In 2018, NDLEA staff from various commands 
reported that no funds were dispersed.  This failure at both the institutional and federal 
government levels encourages NDLEA staff to supplement their salaries and enforcement 
activities through the acceptance of bribes and extortion. 
 
C.  National Goals, Bilateral Cooperation, and U.S. Policy Initiatives 
 
The NDLEA’s primary national goals for 2018 were the passage of a Drug Sentencing Bill 
requesting a mandatory minimum five-year sentence for drug possession, and an increase of 
15,000 personnel.  The sentencing bill remained pending before the National Assembly at the 
conclusion of 2018, and although President Muhammmadu Buhari approved the agency’s 
request for an increase in personnel in 2017, funding had not been allocated to begin recruitment.

D.  Conclusion 
 
The NDLEA provides a framework for the Government of Nigeria to pursue its drug control 
objectives and cooperate with international partners to achieve these goals.  To increase the 
agency’s effectiveness, the government of Nigeria will need to provide, and equitably distribute, 
increased funding and training to the NDLEA.  The United States will continue to engage the 
Government of Nigeria to combat drug trafficking, corruption, money laundering, and other 
criminal issues.  The institutional and societal factors that contribute to these criminal activities 
remain deeply rooted and will require a comprehensive and collaborative effort.  Progress will 
require sustained Nigerian government efforts and an increased political will.

Pakistan 
 
A.  Introduction 
 
Pakistan continues to be one of the world’s top transit corridors for opiates and cannabis 
products, which are trafficked through the country’s porous borders with Afghanistan and 
Iran.  Once in Pakistan, illicit drugs are subsequently trafficked globally through Pakistan’s 
seaports, airports, postal services, and unpatrolled coastal areas.  The United Nations Office on 
Drugs and Crime (UNODC) estimates Pakistan is the destination and transit country for 
approximately 45 percent of the opiates produced in Afghanistan.  Pakistan is also a major transit 
country for precursor chemicals used to produce heroin and methamphetamine, though Pakistan 
is only able to interdict a fraction of the chemicals funneled through the country.   
  
Due to a lack of reliable data since 2016, it is difficult to estimate current levels of poppy 
cultivation.  Most opium poppy cultivation continues to take place in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa (KP) 
province and the areas formerly known as the Federally Administered Tribal Areas (FATA), 
enabled by low levels of economic development and civilian security in these regions.    
   
In 2018, Pakistan’s law enforcement agencies reported to have disrupted 13 domestic and 
international drug trafficking organizations.  Pakistan’s Anti-Narcotics Force (ANF), the 
country’s lead drug enforcement agency and staffed at senior levels by the Pakistani military, 
reported that during the first 10 months of 2018 it seized approximately 53 metric tons (MT) of 
morphine, heroin, opium, cocaine, and hashish – a two-thirds decrease from what was seized 
during the same period in 2017.  The Government of Pakistan’s budget limitations and, in some 
cases, lack of political will hindered drug control efforts.  As poppy cultivation and opiate 
production increase in Afghanistan, Pakistan’s limited resources and law enforcement capacity 
will be further strained. 
   
Domestic drug consumption continues to be an area of concern.  According to a 2013 UNODC 
nationwide survey, Pakistan is home to 6.7 million drug users, and approximately 20 MT of 
heroin is consumed within the country annually.  Pakistan currently lacks the capacity to provide 
effective, non-residential treatment for substance use disorder and to incorporate an evidence-
based approach systematically to drug prevention education.   
 
B.  Drug Control Accomplishments, Policies, and Trends 
 
 
1.  Institutional Development 
 
ANF is an agency within Pakistan’s Ministry of Narcotics Control (MNC).  In 2018, the MNC 
finalized a long-awaited revision of its national drug control policy, last amended in 2011.  
Formal publication of the policy is expected in early 2019.  The Ministry also initiated a 
precursor control oversight mechanism, though such efforts were still nascent at the close of 
2018.  
   
ANF’s 2018 budget was $18.6 million, a 9 percent increase over 2017.  The Government of 
Pakistan indicated that it plans to increase ANF’s budget in 2019 to $19.3 million.  Nevertheless, 


INCSR 2019 Volume 1  
 
 
 
 
Country Reports 
229 
 
the funds are insufficient to support ANF’s daunting mission and limit its capacity to perform 
key functions adequately, such as operational maintenance of vehicles and equipment.  Over 60 
percent of ANF’s budget is used to pay the salaries of its 3,100 employees, who are thinly 
deployed across 40 stations and field offices.  These posts span every province and territory, 
except the former FATA.  ANF anticipates establishing a new coastal regional directorate with 
jurisdiction along the Makran Coast.  The coastal directorate will more than double the agency’s 
capacity in the province by adding 25 officers and 655 staff.  However, due to budget 
constraints, personnel have not been hired yet.  In 2018, the ANF Academy provided instruction 
to over 300 trainees across Pakistan’s law enforcement community.  
   
In 2018, ANF continued nominally to chair the Inter-Agency Task Force (IATF), comprising 27 
Pakistani agencies and intended to enhance coordination and communication on drug 
control.  However, the IATF’s effectiveness is negligible and it did not meet in 2018.   
   
ANF coordinated illicit drug investigations with multiple foreign counterparts in 2018, including 
the United States, United Kingdom, Canada, South Africa, Malaysia, Greece, Spain, Poland, 
Germany, and the United Arab Emirates.  Pakistan hosts 39 foreign Drug Liaison Officers as part 
of its Paris Pact obligations.  ANF also partnered with the U.S. Drug Enforcement 
Administration (DEA) and the United Kingdom’s National Crime Agency to operate several 
Special Investigative Cells (SICs).   
   
The United States and Pakistan do not have a bilateral mutual legal assistance treaty.  Pakistan is 
a party to relevant multilateral law enforcement conventions that have mutual legal assistance 
provisions.  The United States and Pakistan can also make and receive requests for assistance on 
the basis of domestic laws.  Enforcement of the 1931 Extradition Treaty between the United 
States and the United Kingdom (adopted by Pakistan upon independence) has been problematic.   
 
 
2.  Supply Reduction 
 
In 2018, Pakistan’s law enforcement agencies reported multiple noteworthy seizures and claim to 
have disrupted 13 domestic and international drug trafficking organizations.  ANF reported that 
during the first 10 months of 2018, it seized approximately five MT of morphine and heroin; four 
MT of opium; 2.5 kilograms of cocaine; and 41.5 MT of hashish.  Overall 2018 seizure totals by 
ANF represent a two-thirds decrease from 2017, and the total volume of cocaine seized in 2018 
was negligible.  Twenty additional law enforcement agencies reported arresting nearly 36,000 
individuals for drug trafficking.  Those agencies reported seizing over 106 MT of morphine, 
heroin, opium, cocaine, and hashish, as compared to 51 MT seized during the same period in 
2017. 
   
According to a 2009 UNODC study, the most recent available, 160 to 200 MT of Afghan heroin 
and 350 to 400 MT of opium were trafficked from Afghanistan to Pakistan annually.  Pakistan is 
only able to interdict a fraction of that traffic.  The overwhelming majority of drugs trafficked 
through Pakistan are destined for global markets, while a minority is consumed within Pakistan.  
ANF represents less than one-half of 1 percent of Pakistan law enforcement personnel in the 
country.  The rest of the nearly 700,000 police and paramilitary forces in Pakistan lack rigorous 
drug interdiction training, and most do not address it as part of their core mission.  


INCSR 2019 Volume 1  
 
 
 
 
Country Reports 
230 
 
   
Pakistan’s main opium poppy growing areas are in the former FATA and Khyber Pakhtunkhwa 
(KP).  Insecurity and extremist activity in these regions have prevented reliable ground surveying 
to determine precise cultivation levels.  ANF reported 34 hectares (ha) of poppy were cultivated 
during the 2017-2018 growing season, all of which were reportedly eradicated.  However, these 
figures are unreliable.  The most recent U.S. government estimates from 2016 indicate that 
approximately 1,400 ha were under cultivation in traditional poppy growing areas.  Alternative 
livelihood and development programs for farmers, including distribution of seeds, agricultural 
training, and construction of small-scale roads and irrigation projects, have discouraged poppy 
cultivation in some communities of KP.  Pakistan depends heavily on foreign assistance to 
implement and monitor such programs.  The United States government has provided over $50 
million since 1989 for these types of programs, benefitting over 1.2 million Pakistanis and 
contributing to an estimated 87 percent decrease in poppy cultivation since that time. 
 
ANF is responsible for conducting complex drug investigations with a small staff, while working 
within a judicial system where prosecutors and judges are overworked, underpaid, and ill-
prepared to prosecute cases that involve modern investigative techniques.  Suspects arrested by 
ANF are tried in special drug courts that hear only those cases brought by ANF’s own prosecutor 
corps.  During the first 10 months of 2018, ANF registered 1,000 drug arrest cases.  ANF 
reported that 96 percent of the total cases brought to trial resulted in convictions, with 20 percent 
of the convictions overturned on appeal.  However, the vast majority of prosecuted cases were 
low-level possession or small quantity courier trafficking.  Pakistan has a conspiracy law, but it 
is rarely pursued in drug cases, hindering prosecutions of high-value targets.  Lengthy trial and 
appeal processes mean that suspects can spend years in pre-trial or under-trial detention before a 
final verdict is reached. 
   
Though the ANF is a federal agency, Pakistan devolved considerable authority to its provinces 
under its 18th amendment in 2010 for responsibilities including health and social welfare.  
However, provincial drug control units are still in nascent stages of operation.  Enhanced 
coordination between provincial and federal efforts would benefit overall drug control 
performance within the country, as would enhanced coordination between federal agencies 
through the IATF. 
 
 
3.  Public Information, Prevention, and Treatment   
 
UNODC’s 2013 nationwide drug use survey indicated that 6.7 million Pakistanis aged 15 to 64 
had used drugs for non-medical purposes at least once in the previous 12 months.  In total, the 
survey classified 4.25 million drug users aged 15 to 64 as suffering from substance use 
disorders.  Cannabis and opioids were the most prevalent drugs consumed.  The survey results 
also showed that for the 1.5 million female drug users, the majority reported misuse of opioid-
based painkillers or synthetic tranquilizers and sedatives, rather than the cannabis, heroin, and 
opium used by male drug users.   
   
In 2018, Pakistan continued efforts to raise public awareness about the dangers of illicit drug 
use.  ANF conducted 245 public awareness-raising activities and lectured frequently at 
universities, colleges, and schools about drug awareness.   


INCSR 2019 Volume 1  
 
 
 
 
Country Reports 
231 
 
 
ANF opened two new drug treatment centers in 2018, adding 120 beds and increasing existing 
capacity by 62 percent.  However, Pakistan could make better use of provincial-level institutions, 
such as hospitals and medical centers, to provide non-residential treatment options.  Pakistan’s 
drug treatment capacity, with fewer than 100 clinics operating nationwide, remains 
insufficient.  Due to insufficient government resources, non-governmental organizations (NGOs) 
operate more than 90 percent of Pakistan’s detoxification centers.  Because Pakistan lacks the 
institutional capacity to serve women, the majority of drug users receiving treatment are 
men.  Donor-funded “train-the-trainer” programs have increased the number of addiction centers 
that provide evidence-based treatment.   
 
 
4.  Corruption 
 
The Government of Pakistan does not, as a matter of government policy, encourage or facilitate 
illicit drug production or distribution, nor is it involved in laundering the proceeds of the sale of 
illicit drugs.  However, corruption remains a challenge, undermining the country’s criminal 
justice system.  The National Accountability Board (NAB) is Pakistan’s anti-graft agency 
responsible for eliminating corruption.  Since it was established more than 17 years ago, the 
NAB has recovered more than $2 billion and has received and taken action on more than 
370,000 complaints.  Yet, the consequences for convicted perpetrators are rarely 
severe.  Corruption corrodes the government’s ability to address illicit drugs, as bribed public 
servants may facilitate movement of contraband or otherwise interfere with the arrest and 
prosecution of suspects.      
 
C.  National Goals, Bilateral Cooperation, and U.S. Policy Initiatives   
 
The United States remains strongly committed to a comprehensive approach to drug control 
assistance in Pakistan.  U.S. supply reduction assistance builds Pakistani capacity to interdict 
drug shipments and dismantle criminal organizations.  The United States strives to help all 
relevant Pakistani law enforcement entities develop their capacity to conduct sophisticated 
operations, such as controlled deliveries, financial crime investigations, and container 
profiling.  To counter illicit drug trafficking and transnational organized crime effectively, the 
United States aims to help Pakistan cultivate a model for collaborative, intelligence-driven, and 
corruption-free law enforcement by facilitating interagency, cross-border, and international 
coordination.  The United States also provides alternative means for farmers to grow licit crops 
instead of poppy, including the distribution of seeds, the construction of small roads, and 
alternative livelihood irrigation projects.   
   
Over the past five years, U.S. supply reduction assistance has mainly funded poppy reduction 
programs and ANF interdiction activities.  In 2018, bilateral cooperation on interdiction 
programs between the United States and Pakistan shifted to a more strategic framework, 
including a focus on cross-border cooperation with Afghan counterparts and an emphasis on 
capacity building, rather than assistance for daily operating costs.  The United States continued 
to strengthen and diversify cooperation with law enforcement agencies, including by signing a 
memorandum of understanding with a provincial drug control department for the first time.  
   


INCSR 2019 Volume 1  
 
 
 
 
Country Reports 
232 
 
To support demand reduction and recovery efforts, the United States funds various drug 
treatment and practitioner training programs.  In 2018, the U.S. government continued its 
assistance to NGOs operating free-of-charge drug treatment centers and prevention activities, 
prioritizing the funding of projects benefitting women and children, and providing training for 
drug treatment professionals to improve evidence-based protocols.  Working with the Colombo 
Plan and UNODC, the U.S. government funded 53 drug awareness campaigns in 2018, and 
provided free-of-cost residential treatment for nearly 500 patients with substance use disorders, 
including 28 women and 140 adolescents.  The U.S. government also provided training to 330 
youth leaders and teachers, as well as 65 drug treatment professionals.  U.S. assistance continued 
to focus on evidence-based approaches to treatment and prevention. 
 
D.  Conclusion 
 
Pakistan continues to face enormous economic and security challenges that often supersede drug 
trafficking in national security priorities, thus limiting attention and resources put toward drug 
control.  Pakistan could reduce drug trafficking more effectively by encouraging its law 
enforcement agencies to better coordinate engagement, share information more readily, and 
expend limited resources more efficiently.  There is also a need for greater investigative focus on 
the financial aspects of the drug trade, including better training to counter money laundering.  
Pakistan should also look to strengthen drug control cooperation with neighboring countries, do 
more to target high-level drug kingpins rather than low-level traffickers, and focus on maritime 
interdiction along the Makran Coast.  Greater mobilization of provincial institutions could 
provide an important multiplier for interdiction, prevention, and service delivery.

Panama 
 
A.  Introduction  
 
Panama is not a major producer of illicit drugs, but transnational criminal organizations take 
advantage of the country’s transportation infrastructure, free trade zones, and the canal to 
smuggle cocaine to the United States and other international markets.  Although Panama does 
not suffer from extensive domestic drug consumption, the increasing flow of drugs from 
Colombia makes greater domestic drug use a distinct possibility.  
 
Panama is a regional leader in the fight against the international drug trade and transnational 
criminal organizations, and a trusted strategic U.S. partner in interdicting illicit drug shipments.  
The United States collaborates well with all of Panama’s security services, which continue to 
make progress in developing their institutional capacity.   
 
B.  Drug Control Accomplishments, Policies, and Trends  
 
1. Institutional Developments  
 
Panama continues to improve its security institutions, with U.S. assistance playing an important 
role.  While the Ministry of Public Security increased its budget for the tenth consecutive year in 
2018, Panamanian security institutions continue to face challenges with interagency cooperation, 
procurement management, and budget constraints hampering its ability to combat human and 
drug trafficking networks.  Panama’s security forces are often hampered by their inability to fund 
basic costs associated with core security and drug enforcement missions.  In an attempt to 
overcome challenges in interagency operational coordination, the Ministry of Public Security has 
since created an interagency task force led by a former Minister of Public Security.  The 
effectiveness of this task force on Panama’s drug enforcement operations are to be determined. 
 
Panama’s National Police (PNP) continues to reform its training of Antinarcotics Police Officers.  
Through the National Public Safety Institute, basic and commissioned officers receive ongoing 
basic and advance training, including drug identification, overdose response, and tactical 
entries/takedowns, basic drug investigations, as well as undercover operations, complex 
conspiracy courses.    
 
In 2018, the Government of Panama fully implemented Real Time Crime Centers (DACTERS in 
Spanish) throughout the country, providing data analytics that contributed to a significant 
reduction in major crimes including homicides and drug trafficking.  The PNP uses comparative 
statistics (COMPSTAT) to analyze criminal trends, redistributing its resources and officers that 
resulted in greater success against gangs and drug trafficking in 2018.  
 
In 2016, Panama fully implemented an accusatory justice system similar to the U.S. system to 
increase transparency, reduce pretrial detention, and adjudicate cases quicker.  Since the 
transition to the accusatory justice system, the length of time required to resolve cases dropped 
from an average of 296 days to 42 days, according to a 2018 academic study.  According to 
Panama’s Office of Drug Prosecution, since 2016, Panama convictions of drug-related crimes 


INCSR 2019 Volume 1  
 
 
 
 
Country Reports 
234 
 
have been above 90 percent, achieving a 98 percent conviction rate in 2018.  While the 
Government of Panama continues to demonstrate an increased capacity in drug prosecutions, 
there still remains challenges in the investigation and prosecution of complex cases. 
 
The United States collaborates effectively with Panama’s 27 district attorneys responsible for 
prosecuting drug trafficking crimes, especially those handling maritime interdiction cases in 
conjunction with the Panamanian Coast Guard (SENAN) and border force (SENAFRONT), 
which patrol rivers and coastal areas.  Although the number of drug-related prosecutions 
increased in 2018, few leaders of drug trafficking organizations were successfully prosecuted.  
The justice sector continues to struggle with complex cases such as money laundering, organized 
crime, and criminal forfeiture cases, and official corruption remains a problem.  
  
Panama has mutual assistance and extradition treaties with the United States, but Panama’s 
constitution does not permit extradition of Panamanian nationals. 
   
2.  Supply Reduction  
 
Panamanian authorities seized approximately 73 metric tons (MT) of illicit drugs in 2018.  With 
U.S. assistance, SENAN routinely interdicted maritime narcotics shipments, often based on 
information provided by U.S. authorities or other Panamanian agencies.  When provided 
intelligence by the United States or other international partners, SENAN acted upon 90 percent 
of reports and 20 percent of operations resulted in seizures.  SENAN seized 22.5 MT of illicit 
drugs, mostly cocaine, and 28 vessels; 77 individuals were arrested in the course of these 
operations.  In 2018, SENAN’s interdiction success rate of targeted maritime vessels increased 
by eight percent as compared to 2017. 
 
Panamanian units vetted by the U.S. government and working in partnership with U.S. law 
enforcement agencies conducted sensitive investigations and operations related to illicit drugs, 
money laundering, migrant smuggling, and other transnational crimes.  In 2018, investigations 
and operations by these vetted units resulted in 568 arrests and the seizure of over 26 MT of 
cocaine and 202.7 MT of marijuana – increases of approximately 32 percent and 3,875 percent, 
respectively, from what was seized in 2017 and approximately $5.53 million in cash.  
Approximately $5.53 million in cash and counterfeit items with a street value of approximately 
$1.86 million were also seized in 2018, demonstrating significant progress in the development of 
Panama’s capabilities. 
 
The United States provided state-of-the-art scanning equipment to the Tocumen international 
airport in 2018 to modernize the processing of more than 15 million passengers transiting this 
terminal per year.  The equipment operates at a much lower x-ray spectrum, capable of 
producing full body images that enhances the detection of small quantities of drugs and other 
commonly smuggled items.  The United States provided similar equipment at the Marcos A. 
Gelabert Airport, a secondary facility that handles direct flights to Colombia and Costa Rica.  
 
3.  Public Information, Prevention, and Treatment  
 


INCSR 2019 Volume 1  
 
 
 
 
Country Reports 
235 
 
Panama has not experienced high levels of drug usage or gang activity from transnational groups 
active in other Central American countries.  Local gangs, operating primarily in the Caribbean 
coast, take part in a variety of criminal activities.  Panamanian officials are increasingly 
concerned that instability in other countries in the region could eventually spill into Panama and 
lead to increased drug usage and gang activity.  The increased flow of drugs from Colombia 
presents greater risks for domestic drug use as well.  The government of Panama has not reported 
significant use of synthetic opioids, though synthetic drugs have reached the streets of Panama 
and likely transit the canal in container ships. 
 
Panama has modest drug demand reduction programs in schools and the Ministry of Health 
supports a drug-counseling program.  Panama has not conducted a drug-demand study since 
2015 and has not updated its published strategy on demand reduction since 2007, making it 
difficult to assess current trends.  
 
The United States partners with the PNP to implement programs such as the Drug Awareness 
and Resistance Education (DARE), and the Gang Resistance Education and Training Program 
(GREAT), as well as community policing initiatives, to help at-risk youth.  
  
4.  Corruption  
 
The Government of Panama does not, as a matter of policy, encourage or facilitate illegal drug 
production or distribution, nor is it involved in laundering the proceeds of the sale of illicit drugs.  
However, transnational criminal organizations target the security services, customs, and justice 
sector to facilitate drug trafficking, raising concerns about official corruption at all levels.  
Panamanian authorities recognize the threat and actively investigate officials for corruption.  
 
As part of this effort, the United States assisted SENAN in establishing an internal affairs unit in 
2017.  In 2018, this unit dramatically increased the number of pre-employment background 
investigations and polygraph examinations.  As a result, SENAN rejected multiple individuals 
with criminal records or other derogatory information.  An investigation from this unit also led to 
the arrest and conviction in 2018 of two crew members accused of providing locations of patrol 
vessels to drug traffickers.  Panama will need to continue to institutionalize these aggressive 
steps to reduce the threat of drug trafficking-fueled corruption.  
 
C.  National Goals, Bilateral Cooperation, and U.S. Policy Initiatives  
 
Consistent with the U.S. Strategy for Central America and through the Central America Regional 
Security Initiative (CARSI), the United States supports citizen security, law enforcement, and 
rule-of-law programs in Panama to expand Panamanian capabilities to interdict, investigate, and 
prosecute drug trafficking, money laundering, and other transnational crimes while strengthening 
Panama’s justice sector.  The United States provides assistance to modernize and maintain 
SENAN, SENAFRONT, and PNP vessels, equipment, and facilities in support of interdiction 
efforts.  U.S.-provided aviation assets have helped SENAN expand its ability to support joint 
drug enforcement operations.  The United States supports trilateral cooperation with Panama and 
Colombia, whereby Colombian law enforcement, justice sector, and military experts train their 
Panamanian counterparts.

In April 2018, the United States and Panama, together with Costa Rica and Colombia, executed 
OPERATION KRAKEN II, a month-long multinational surge of interdiction operations modeled 
on a previous effort taken in 2017.  During this operation, the combined forces seized 9.9 MT of 
cocaine, 1.7 MT of marijuana, and apprehended 59 individuals of various nationalities.  This 
operation demonstrated Panama’s ability to efficiently work with the United States and regional 
partners in complex environments.   
 
The bilateral Salas-Becker Agreement to cooperate on maritime interdiction permits Panamanian 
security officers to accompany U.S. maritime patrol aircraft and vessels.  The United States 
provides training to Panamanian authorities to improve implementation of the agreement and 
enhance interdiction operations.  In May, the United States committed to send five experienced 
attorneys to Panama to assist in standardizing procedures for prosecuting maritime crime and 
mentoring prosecutors.  The United States also established a new program in 2018 to provide 
expert guidance to help Panamanian authorities build maritime interdiction capacity, enhance 
investigative techniques, and apply best practices during preparation of maritime crime cases for 
prosecution.  Bilateral U.S.-Panamanian engagement on security issues is facilitated by the High-
Level Security Dialogue, an ongoing coordination mechanism initiated in 2017. 
 
D.  Conclusion  
 
Panama has established itself as a regional leader in drug interdiction, and a strategic ally in U.S. 
efforts to fight transnational criminal organizations and the flow of drugs into the United States.  
The Panamanian government has made significant achievements in reforming its justice sector 
institutions and developing the capacity of its law enforcement agencies.  Despite the 
Panamanian government’s willingness to combat organized crime and drug trafficking, the 
increasing volume of drugs from Colombia and the spillover of criminality from neighboring 
countries exceeds the capabilities of Panama’s security services to manage these challenges 
alone.   
 
While Panama continues its efforts to lay the groundwork for systemic improvements, 
bureaucratic and institutional deficiencies prevent it from effectively dealing with transnational 
criminal organizations.  The United States continues to support Panama’s implementation of 
reforms and remains committed to partnering with the country’s security services to conduct 
more effective and organized actions against transnational crime and drug trafficking.

Paraguay 
 
Paraguay made progress in seizing cocaine shipments and improving interagency coordination 
against illicit drugs in 2018, but remains among the largest source countries for marijuana in the 
Western Hemisphere and a transit country for Andean cocaine.  Traffickers exploit the country’s 
porous borders, clandestine airstrips, lack of airspace control, extensive internal waterways, and 
under-resourced law enforcement and judicial officials to transit cocaine, mainly to Brazil or 
through Brazil to overseas markets, though rarely the United States.  Transnational criminal 
organizations engage in drug trafficking and other illicit activities, aided by corruption and legal 
impunity.  President Abdo Benitez took office on August 15, and his Administration has shown 
initiative in pursuing counterdrug activities.    
 
During the first nine months of 2018, the National Anti-Drug Secretariat (SENAD) seized and 
destroyed 893 metric tons (MT) of processed marijuana and eradicated 1,222 hectares (ha) of 
cannabis.  During the first 10 months of 2018, SENAD seized and destroyed 714 kilograms (kg) 
of cocaine.  This included a 448 (kg) seizure, SENAD’s single largest seizure since 2012.  In 
September, SENAD also arrested Paraguayan alleged drug kingpin Reinaldo Javier “Cucho” 
Cabaña.  During the first nine months of 2018, the Paraguayan National Police seized and 
destroyed 54 MT of processed marijuana, eradicated 874 ha of cannabis, and seized 99 kg of 
cocaine.  There were 125 convictions on drug trafficking charges in 2018. 
 
The United States and Paraguay are parties to a 2001 extradition treaty that remains in force.  
There is no bilateral mutual legal assistance treaty, though both countries are party to multilateral 
conventions providing for cooperation in criminal matters.  In June, government representatives 
issued the 2017 – 2022 Paraguayan National Policy on Drugs.  The National Civil Aviation 
Authority began installing a radar system in July to monitor illicit air travel and ultimately feed 
into law enforcement systems. 
 
Paraguayan authorities report an increase in domestic drug consumption.  Outpatient community-
based drug treatment programs, supported by the United States and other donors, supplement the 
three main government-run drug treatment centers, including the Ministry of Health’s 30-bed 
inpatient detoxification facility.  Paraguay’s 2017 asset forfeiture legislation allocates 50 percent 
of proceeds to demand reduction and crime prevention efforts.  
 
U.S. law enforcement cooperation continues to help facilitate drug seizures, arrests, and 
prosecutions by Paraguayan authorities.  Increased Paraguayan government efforts to enhance 
interagency coordination, improve the judicial system’s ability to prosecute cases quickly and 
effectively, and reduce corruption would help further deter drug production and trafficking.

Peru 
 
A.  Introduction 
 
Peru was the second-largest producer of cocaine and coca, with an estimated 49,800 hectares 
(ha) under cultivation in 2017, the most recent year for which data is available.  Potential pure 
cocaine production in Peru increased to 491 metric tons (MT).  Though the amount cultivated 
throughout much of Peru decreased in 2017, increased cultivation in the Valley of the Rivers 
Apurímac, Ene, and Mantaro (VRAEM) negated the successes realized in the remainder of the 
growing region.  Eradication efforts in the VRAEM are complicated by limited access and 
significant security challenges that threaten the safety of eradicators.  The areas of Apurimac and 
Puno account for two-thirds of the country’s cultivation.  Despite this, Peru has demonstrated 
great successes in alternative development and eradication programs as represented by the 
decreases in coca cultivation and cocaine production outside of the VRAEM.   
 
Peruvian cocaine is trafficked throughout South America, traveling to Europe, East Asia, 
Mexico, and the United States.  In addition to coca cultivation, Peru is a major importer of 
precursor chemicals for cocaine production.  Following former President Pedro Pablo 
Kuczynski’s resignation in March 2018, President Martín Vizcarra’s government has maintained 
the commitment to implementing Peru’s 2017-2021 drug control strategy eradication goals.  
During the first nine months of 2018, Peru’s coca eradication force (CORAH) eradicated 20,843 
ha, completing 83 percent of its annual goal of 25,000 ha.  The military and the Peruvian 
National Police’s (PNP) anti-drug unit (DIREJANDRO) conducted joint counter-drug operations 
in the VRAEM.  Peru approved the VRAEM Strategy 2021, which involves heavy investment in 
development but does not include eradication operations in the region.  
 
The terrorist group Sendero Luminoso (Shining Path), relying upon cocaine trafficking for 
funding, maintains a strong hold in the VRAEM.  In 2018, the group killed four military 
personnel and four police officers, and continued to provide a safe haven for drug traffickers. 
 
B.  Drug Control Accomplishments, Policies, and Trends 
 
 
1.  Institutional Development 
 
The Peruvian government’s 2017-2021 drug control strategy includes goals for eradication, 
interdiction, and alternative development.  It also addresses the control of precursor chemicals, 
organized crime, money laundering, and the rule of law.  In 2018, the Government of Peru 
allocated $134 million towards implementation of this strategy, $16.5 million less than 
2017.[1]  Peru contributed $21.2 million towards eradication efforts and concomitant aviation 
support in 2018, which is equivalent to its 2017 contribution.   
                                                     
 
 
 
[1]Budget calculated from relevant budget line items in Peru’s Ministry of Economy and Finance (MEF) website.  The MEF’s online 
budget contained a calculation error in previous years in which eradication numbers were duplicated on multiple lines.  The correct 
counternarcotics strategy implementation budgets from previous years are as follows:  $150.8 million (2017), $142 million (2016), 
and $145.1 million (2015).

A 2015 law authorized the Peruvian Air Force to intercept suspicious aircraft entering Peruvian 
airspace without appropriate flight clearance authorization.  The law includes a measure that 
allows for lethal force in the case of non-compliance.  Though the “shoot down” policy is 
designed to be applied only as a last resort option, it is inconsistent with U.S. and international 
law prohibiting the use of lethal force against civil aircraft. 
 
Peru published the 2018-2021 Anti-Money Laundering and Terrorist Financing National Plan in 
March, which includes prevention, detection, and sanctioning activities based on identified 
sectoral vulnerabilities.  With U.S.-provided technical assistance, Peru passed legislation creating 
a civil asset forfeiture regime in August.   
 
The Ministry of Justice is implementing the New Criminal Procedure Code (NCPC), which 
transitions the legal system from an inquisitorial to an accusatory system.  In 2018, 31 of 34 
judicial districts were operating under the NCPC, with 20 districts operating exclusively under 
the new system.  All 34 judicial districts are required to adjudicate corruption and organized 
crime cases under the NCPC.  Three districts in Lima, handling approximately 35 percent of the 
national caseload, will complete the transition by July 2020. 
 
Peru and the United States have an international extradition treaty.   
    
 
2.  Supply Reduction 
 
The U.S. government estimates that 49,800 ha of coca were under cultivation in Peru in 2017, a 
13 percent increase from the 2016 estimate of 44,000 ha.  The U.S. estimate for potential pure 
cocaine production increased from 410 MT in 2016 to 491 MT in 2017 due to coca yield and 
maturity. 
 
As of September 30, CORAH eradicated 20,843 ha of its annual goal of 25,000 ha in Peru’s 
Ucayali, Pasco, Huánuco, and San Martín regions.  On October 10, the Peruvian government 
approved the VRAEM Strategy 2021, which involves heavy investment in social and economic 
development, but does not include eradication operations for the region that accounts for an 
estimated 65 percent of Peru’s total potential pure cocaine production. 
 
DIREJANDRO received a $12.3 million budget in 2018, identical to its 2017 budget.  During the 
first nine months of 2018, this unit seized 39.7 MT of narcotics, including 9.6 MT of cocaine 
base, 17.2 MT of cocaine hydrochloride, and 12.8 MT of marijuana.  DIREJANDRO units 
destroyed 243 cocaine laboratories and seized 61.8 MT of coca leaf. 
 
The movement of cocaine by small aircraft from Peru to Bolivia and Brazil remains a significant 
concern to the United States, even though the number of illicit drug flights remained constant in 
2018.  Illicit flights continue to originate from the areas of Ciudad Constitución and the Junín-
Huancavelica border zone.  Large cocaine seizures continue to occur in source zone areas and the 
coastal, northern border between Peru and Ecuador.  Peruvian authorities continue to see high-
THC Colombian marijuana (known locally as “cripy”) enter Peru across the country’s northern 
border with Ecuador, for distribution in Chile.

The police and military continued to destroy clandestine runways – 64 runways through 
September 30, 2018, compared to 78 runways in 2017. 
 
Peruvian, Colombian, Mexican, and Eastern European traffickers maintain sophisticated 
networks to ship cocaine to Europe, East Asia, Mexico, the Caribbean, the United States, and 
other Western Hemisphere countries.  Peru and the United States undertake joint maritime 
operations that permit U.S. authorities to board Peruvian-flagged vessels in international 
waters.  In joint investigations with U.S. law enforcement, DIREJANDRO identified and 
disrupted major international cocaine trafficking organizations using maritime and air 
conveyances.   
 
During the first nine months in 2018, PNP and Customs officials at Lima’s International Airport 
and the Port of Callao seized 7.1 MT of cocaine, arresting 108 smugglers.  These officials also 
seized 29 fraudulent passports at ports of entry.  PNP and Customs officials registered 5,136 
individuals in the Biometrics Identification Transnational Migration Alert Program (BITMAP).  
In May, DIREJANDRO’s Sensitive Investigative Unit executed “Operation Empresario,” which 
resulted in the seizure of 1.3 MT of cocaine and the arrest of 13 members of a Peruvian-
Colombian drug trafficking organization that was shipping cocaine from the Port of Paita in 
Peru’s north. 
 
PNP investigations resulted in the seizure of financial assets.  One case resulted in the seizure of 
$15 million worth of properties from a money laundering organization tied to corruption and 
drug trafficking.  In another case, the PNP seized $3.6 million worth of gold bullion that was 
destined to Swiss company Metalor from the Puno-based Minerales Del Sur company, which had 
prior links to laundering drug trafficking proceeds.  In July, the U.S. Drug Enforcement 
Administration (DEA) signed a cooperative agreement with several Peruvian law enforcement 
agencies to establish vetted investigative units handling money laundering cases linked to drug 
trafficking.  
 
 
3.  Public Information, Prevention, and Treatment 
 
Peru’s anti-drug agency (DEVIDA) estimates 200,000 Peruvians are addicted to illicit 
substances; 60,000 cocaine users, 130,000 marijuana users, and 10,000 users of other illicit 
substances.  Use of inexpensive, highly addictive coca paste is increasing.  Drug use is increasing 
along drug trafficking routes in midsize cities east of the Andes and in coastal transit cities. 
 
DEVIDA’s budget for drug abuse prevention and treatment increased from $14.9 million in 2017 
to $15.2 million in 2018.  Drug abuse counseling services reach over 30,000 people annually. 
 
Public treatment facilities in Peru remain insufficient, with only 169 beds for patients.  Less than 
10 percent of female addicts seek and receive drug treatment.  Mental health hospitals added 22 
beds for inpatient drug treatment and mental disorder services for women, bringing the total 
number of beds for women to 42 nationwide.  DEVIDA and the Ministry of Health (MINSA) 
operate 162 mental health and drug services facilities used by over 15,000 patients.  Peru has 
approximately 400 privately run therapeutic community centers, but only 24 meet public health

legal standards.  MINSA opened 55 community mental health centers, bringing the total to 77 
nationwide.  Of Peru’s 66 prisons nationwide, few offer drug treatment and rehabilitation 
programs. 
 
 
4.  Corruption 
 
The Government of Peru does not encourage or facilitate the illicit production or distribution of 
drugs.  Corruption is widespread, eroding faith in Peru’s institutions and damaging Peru’s 
generally positive investment climate.  According to October 2018 polling, 94 percent of 
Peruvians think there is high-level corruption in Congress, the Judiciary, the Attorney General’s 
Office, regional governments, and the PNP.  Corruption scandals have ensnarled many of Peru’s 
political figures, including former presidents, members of Congress, Supreme Court justices, 
National Magistrate’s Council representatives, and ministry officials.   
 
Peru approved the 2018-2021 National Plan on Integrity and Combating Corruption in April, 
which calls for the development of OECD-recommended activities to address public corruption.  
President Vizcarra approved measures to strengthen integrity and combat corruption, including 
the creation of the Public Integrity Secretariat, the implementation of centers to report 
corruption, and a requirement of high-level officials to issue sworn statements on conflicts of 
interest.  In July, the Peruvian government passed a legislative decree that would bar public 
officials from holding government positions when they have committed certain crimes. 
 
C.  National Goals, Bilateral Cooperation, and U.S. Policy Initiatives 
 
The United States funds projects to support Peru’s drug control strategy through training, 
technical assistance, capacity-building, intelligence, and the targeted provision of equipment. 
 
The United States and Peru jointly finance manual coca eradication and alternative development 
efforts.  The United States provides aviation support to eradication and interdiction 
activities.  While Peru has not made the decision to commence eradication operations in the 
VRAEM, the PNP has increased interdiction operations there with DEA assistance.   
 
In communities where alternative development followed eradication, coca cultivation dropped by 
just less than 90 percent using 2016 data provided by the UN Office on Drugs and Crime.  With 
technical and institutional assistance from the United States, DEVIDA invested $29 million in 
2018 towards alternative development.  In 2018, U.S.-supported alternative development efforts 
generated an estimated 30,000 new jobs, assisted 41,439 families, and supported these families 
in the planting, maintenance, and improvement of 75,620 ha of cacao and coffee. 
 
U.S. support to the PNP helped to enhance law enforcement capabilities and support citizen 
security.  Interdiction programs increased seizures of illicit drugs and precursor chemicals.  The 
U.S.-supported Model Police Station Program focuses on community policing in five Callao 
neighborhoods, and has led to a 39 percent reduction in crime since 2015.  The United States is 
supporting the PNP’s educational reform project by assisting with the establishment of a 
specialized criminal investigations academy, which will include a virtual shooting range, forensic 
laboratories, and a simulation courtroom.

The U.S.-supported Ports and Custom’s Program worked with the PNP’s Precursor Chemicals 
Investigation Divisions (DIVICDIQ) and the National Superintendence of Customs and Taxes 
(SUNAT) to establish a Joint Tactical Taskforce that processes interagency intelligence products 
to conduct viable checkpoint operations in high-risk areas, such as the VRAEM.  The program 
provided capacity-building initiatives to enhance the operational effectiveness of PNP and 
SUNAT officials, including trainings on canine operations, drug concealment methods, imposter 
detection, and passenger risk analysis.  The program continued its work with the Tactical 
Command Center, the Immigration Intelligence Unit, and BITMAP. 
 
The United States continued to collaborate with the American Bar Association’s Rule of Law 
Initiative in 2018 to support Peru’s transition to the accusatory system with training to judicial 
operators.  The United States also sponsored Peruvian judges to attend the Department of 
Justice’s Judicial Studies Institute and provided specialized trainings on illegal mining and 
anticorruption investigations.   
 
To support treatment and recovery for persons suffering from drug addiction, the United States 
sponsored the Guiding the Recovery of Women (GROW) Training Program to certify trainers on 
specialized drug treatment for female patients.  In total, 1,200 healthcare professionals have 
received GROW training.  To improve the quality of services for Peru’s LGBTI community, the 
United States initiated the Sexual Orientation and Gender Identity specialized drug treatment 
training course in October for 45 healthcare professionals and civil society leaders.  In 
coordination with the OAS and DEVIDA, the United States also initiated an adolescent drug 
treatment court pilot project and supported the launch of a school-based drug prevention project. 
 
The United States continued a mentoring project in 2018 to assist Peru to increase asset 
forfeiture convictions.  The project has led to 36 asset forfeiture convictions and sentences.  The 
United States assisted specialized prosecutorial units on environmental crimes to strengthen their 
investigations into transnational criminal organizations’ involvement in illegal mining and 
logging.  The United States also supported the Public Ministry’s Office of Strategic Criminal 
Analysis, which supports active organized crime cases. 
 
D.  Conclusion 
 
President Vizcarra demonstrates the political will to address drug production and trafficking.  In 
2018, Peru increased resources to treat vulnerable populations afflicted by illegal substance 
abuse.  The U.S. partnership with Peru to implement its drug control strategy remains critical; 
however, both sides should work toward implementing robust counterdrug efforts in the 
VRAEM, to include eradication, interdiction, and alternative development.

Philippines 
 
A. Introduction 
 
The Philippines remains a regional transit and destination point for illicit drug trafficking, 
particularly for methamphetamine and its precursors from China.  “Shabu” (the local street name 
of methamphetamine hydrochloride) and marijuana rank respectively as the first and second 
most widely consumed drugs in the Philippines.  Philippine President Rodrigo Duterte’s antidrug 
campaign continued to receive domestic and international scrutiny due to accusations of “extra-
judicial killings” by police and vigilante groups.  To date, more than 1.3 million individuals have 
surrendered to authorities, as key government entities have taken steps to intensify 
implementation of both supply and demand reduction programs.  Nonetheless, drug trafficking 
remained a highly lucrative illicit business with limited risks due to systemic poverty, ineffective 
criminal justice institutions, outdated drug control laws, poorly controlled maritime borders, and 
public corruption.   
 
B. Drug Control Accomplishments, Policies, and Trends 
 
1.  Institutional Development 
 
Due to the administration’s prioritization of efforts to combat illicit drug production, trafficking, 
and use, multiple government agencies took steps to amplify drug control engagement in 2018.  
Limited financial, human, and technical resources and competing bureaucratic interests 
hampered effective policy coordination.  The Comprehensive Dangerous Drugs Act of 2002 
designates the Dangerous Drugs Board (DDB) under the Office of the President as the country’s 
lead policy and strategy-making body on drug control and prevention.  During 2018, the DDB 
benefited from strong leadership that sought to implement a comprehensive, multi-sector 
approach to reduce both supply and demand.  The Dangerous Drugs Act also created the 
Philippine Drug Enforcement Agency (PDEA) as the DDB’s implementing arm and lead law 
enforcement agency for drug control.   
 
With an executive order issued by President Duterte in 2017, the Philippine Drug Enforcement 
Agency took over as chair of the Interagency Committee on Anti-Illegal Drugs, a newly 
established 21-agency body created to implement drug policy under four clusters: enforcement; 
justice; advocacy; and rehabilitation and reintegration.  The PDEA effectively collaborated with 
the DDB on drug control and prevention in 2018.  Other executive branch entities, the judiciary, 
and local government units played an increasingly important role in drug control policy, though 
these efforts were at times disjointed and uncoordinated.  In order to bring together these 
multiple efforts under one comprehensive strategy, the Dangerous Drugs Board drafted a 
Philippine Anti-Drug Strategy, which was formally approved by President Duterte via executive 
order on October 29.  Implementation on this strategy will begin in early 2019.   
 
The use of plea bargains in drug cases resumed after the Supreme Court struck down as 
unconstitutional a 2002 provision barring their use in late 2017.  However, inadequate 
coordination between the treatment facilities, law enforcement, and the judiciary have challenged 
the plea bargain’s effective implementation.  Restrictions imposed by the 1965 Anti-Wiretapping

Act, which bars the use of intercepted criminal communications in court, remained in place.  The 
Philippines are party to both an extradition treaty and a mutual legal assistance treaty with the 
United States, and regularly coordinates extradition and mutual legal assistance requests.  
Cooperation is excellent, although bureaucratic procedures slow execution of the requests.  The 
Philippines maintains a cooperative relationship with international partners, including the United 
States, on transnational drug interdictions and demand reduction.   
 
2.  Supply Reduction 
 
According to the PDEA, trafficking organizations use critical entry points (68 major seaports; 11 
international airports; a 22,548-mile coastline; and the mail and parcel system) for both 
transshipment and drop-off points to smuggle drug shipments.  Most high-volume drug 
smuggling cases involve foreign nationals.  Chinese drug syndicates dominate the illegal drug 
trade through bulk smuggling via cargo ships and foreign-flagged fishing vessels, according to 
Philippine authorities.  These organizations have also established clandestine laboratories and 
illegal chemical warehouses in key locations throughout the Philippines.  Authorities also note 
evidence of drug syndicates operating from Africa and Latin America. 
 
Philippine authorities have conducted operations against both international drug syndicates and 
local dealers.  During the first 10 months of 2018, the PDEA conducted 25,467 counterdrug 
operations, which dismantled four clandestine methamphetamine laboratories and led to the 
arrest of 23,749 individuals.  The government addresses the negligible cannabis cultivation 
through a pilot alternative development program in Cebu, La Union, and Kalinga. 
 
Trafficking organizations commonly utilize multiple simultaneous shipments in the belief that 
authorities would catch some but not all of the illicit shipments.  For example, on August 7, a 
joint Bureau of Customs and Philippine Drug Enforcement Agency operation seized 355 
kilograms of shabu (with an estimated street value of $63 million) from two magnetic scrap 
lifters originating from Malaysia at the Manila International Container Port (MICT).  However, 
on August 8, authorities discovered four already empty identical lifters of the same origin 
suspected to have contained $127 million in shabu.  The Philippine Drug Enforcement Agency 
later issued a statement indicating that large amounts of shabu seized from between July and 
October contain the same “synthetic impurities” and “production methods” as the shipment 
interdicted at the MICT.   
 
3.  Public Information, Prevention, and Treatment 
 
The government currently estimates that 4.7 million individuals are involved in either the use or 
trafficking of drugs.  The DDB conducted the most recent nationwide survey of drug use in 
2015, which revealed the majority of drug users are male, employed adults (18-59 years old) 
with a high school education.  The top three drugs by use are methamphetamine, marijuana, and 
(to a lesser extent) cocaine.  Injection continues to rise as a method of drug use increasing 
exposure to other risk factors such as Hepatitis C and HIV/AIDS.   
 
In 2018, the government’s counterdrug strategy increasingly incorporated drug demand 
reduction programs.  Key agencies in government, such as the DDB, the PDEA, the Departments 


INCSR 2019 Volume 1  
 
 
 
 
Country Reports 
245 
 
of Interior and Local Government, Health, Education, and Social Welfare, and local officials are 
working to incorporate drug treatment, prevention, and rehabilitation efforts that are evidence-
based and appropriate in a local context.  Civil society and the faith-based community are highly 
active in drug demand reduction in the Philippines and work with government and law 
enforcement officials, when appropriate, to develop solutions to address the country’s drug 
problem.  DDB’s new antidrug strategy aims to bring these activities under one national 
approach.   
 
4.  Corruption 
 
As a matter of public policy, the Government of the Philippines does not encourage or facilitate 
any illegal activity related to drug trafficking.  However, endemic corruption is present at 
multiple levels of government and there are frequent allegations of public officials linked to drug 
trafficking.  The Comprehensive Dangerous Drugs Act of 2002 imposes criminal penalties for 
government officials found to have benefited from drug trafficking proceeds.   
 
C. National Goals, Bilateral Cooperation, and U.S. Policy Initiatives  
 
Cooperation between the Philippines and the United States related to drug policy strengthened in 
2018 through ongoing transnational interdiction assistance efforts and a new bilateral agreement 
designed to increase Philippine capability to reduce drug use through prevention, treatment, and 
rehabilitation.  With this assistance, the United States has supported Philippine government 
officials, including law enforcement, with developing evidence-based prevention and treatment 
protocols.  U.S. assistance has supported the interdiction of methamphetamine shipments to the 
Philippines through parcel services from California in collaboration with PDEA’s Airport 
Interagency Drug Interdiction Task Group.  U.S. assistance is also working with the Philippine 
government to expand the provision and access to justice.   
 
D. Conclusion 
 
Complementing the surge in enforcement actions that took place in 2017, 2018 saw significant 
expansion in government drug demand reduction efforts.  As these efforts continue to expand 
across multiple sectors, key government authorities will need to ensure these programs are 
complementary and evidence-based.  Expansion in treatment accessibility, plea bargain 
agreements, and community-based services could provide an effective alternative to pretrial 
detention for low-level drug offenders in overcrowded detention facilities.  Enforcement actions 
could be further complemented through better collaboration between law enforcement and 
prosecutors in order to identify, investigate, and prosecute transnational criminal organizations.

Russia 
 
Russia remains a major destination country for heroin and other Afghan opiates.  Smuggled 
opiates are primarily trafficked into Russia through Central Asian countries.  Other illicit drugs, 
including cocaine, are typically smuggled into the country via St. Petersburg and Black Sea ports 
by drug couriers or concealed within maritime shipments originating largely in the Caribbean 
region and South America. 
 
The Ministry of Internal Affairs (MVD) and the Federal Security Service (FSB) are Russia’s two 
federal agencies responsible for drug-related investigations.  In October 2017, the availability of 
synthetic drugs surpassed heroin in the Russian drug market.  The MVD has reported targeting 
synthetic drugs sold via the internet and non-indexed internet sites (“Dark Web”).  In September 
2017, authorities effectively shut down the Russian Anonymous Marketplace, a Dark Web hub 
featuring over 1,300 websites selling illicit drugs.  In 2017, the most recent year for which 
statistics are available, Russian law enforcement seized 24.4 metric tons (MT) of illicit drugs.  Of 
this total amount, 977.3 kilograms were opiates; 5.6 MT were synthetic drugs; 14.3 MT were 
cannabis products; and 437.3 kilograms were psychotropic substances. 
 
In 2016, the government disbanded the Federal Narcotics Control Service (FSKN) and assigned 
its functions largely to the MVD, which absorbed many of FSKN’s employees.  Since December 
2016, Minister of Internal Affairs Vladimir Kolokoltsev has served as Chair of the State Anti-
Drug Committee, which coordinates Russia’s drug control policy.  The Ministries of Health and 
Labor assumed responsibility for drug user rehabilitation and Ministries of Health and Education 
for prevention of drug use.  In February 2018, President Putin introduced amendments to the 
National Anti-Drug Policy Strategy confirming the MVD’s coordinating role.  The MVD took 
over management of illicit drug statistical information, but released less data as compared with 
its predecessor.  
 
According to the MVD State Anti-Drug Committee’s report for 2017, there were 2.2 million 
drug users and 208,681 drug crimes registered in Russia.  MVD detected 7,179 drug crimes 
committed through the internet in 2017.  Drug addiction in Russia is typically not treated 
according to evidence-based modern protocols, and is often treated with antipsychotic drugs 
suited to treat schizophrenia.  Experts from civil society have also criticized Russian addiction 
treatment and rehabilitation programs due to poor interagency and inter-sectoral cooperation, and 
for the lack of a cohesive national rehabilitation program. 
 
In 2013, Russia terminated its letter of agreement with the United States that funded counterdrug 
capacity-building programs.  The U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration has a well-established 
robust relationship with all host-country counterparts, including the MVD, FSB, Federal 
Customs Services, Moscow City Police, and General Prosecutor’s Office.

Senegal 
 
Historically, Senegal’s location and transportation infrastructure have made it a transit point for 
the movement of illicit drugs from West Africa to Europe, mostly cocaine.  International 
trafficking networks have utilized Senegalese fishing vessels to smuggle cocaine shipments into 
and through the country, according to law enforcement reports.  In 2018, however, both maritime 
and land-based trafficking activity through Senegal appeared to diminish, perhaps due to an 
increase in direct maritime and aerial transshipment from South America to Europe. 
 
Locally, cannabis is cultivated in the southern Casamance region for domestic use and to supply 
markets across West Africa.  Seizures of multi-ton quantities of marijuana continued in 2018, but 
the bulk of these actions occurred in the northern part of Senegal and involved truck-borne 
cannabis shipments from southern Mali. 
 
Senegal’s 1997 Drug Law was amended in 2006 with tougher penalties for drug trafficking.  
Senegal’s latest drug control plan, launched in 2017, aims to reduce the cultivation, production, 
and trafficking of illicit drugs, as well as to inform the population of the dangers of illicit drug 
use, and promote the rehabilitation of persons with substance use disorders.  As of 2018, the 
effectiveness of the plan remains unproven.  While Senegal continues to lack the resources to 
reliably identify and seize illicit drugs, the capacity and professionalism of Senegalese 
authorities are slowly improving, particularly with assistance from international partners. 
 
Senegal collaborates with partners from the Economic Community of West African States 
(ECOWAS) to combat drug trafficking.  For example, in September 2018, the Senegalese 
National Police and the Drug Law Enforcement Agency of The Gambia signed a memorandum 
of understanding to increase coordination and collaboration on drug enforcement issues.  In 
2018, the United States continued to provide assistance to strengthen the capacities of the 
Gendarmerie, the Marine Nationale, and the Senegalese National Police to monitor, detect, and 
interdict drug traffickers in Senegal’s maritime approaches and territory. 
 
The United States and Senegal do not currently have a bilateral mutual legal assistance treaty or 
an extradition treaty, but Senegalese government has asked that that treaties be negotiated in the 
future.  Senegal is a party to multilateral law enforcement conventions that have mutual legal 
assistance provisions. 
 
The Government of Senegal has the political will to fight drug trafficking, but limited 
infrastructure and funding impede its efforts.  Incremental improvement is taking place, but 
continued support from the United States and other international partners remains critical.

Serbia 
 
Serbia is not a significant source or consumer country of illicit drugs but remains a transit area 
for drugs smuggled through its territory to other European markets, including opiates originating 
in Afghanistan and cocaine originating in South America.  Some small clandestine laboratories 
produce synthetic drugs within the country for local use, and cannabis is the most widely used 
illicit drug domestically. 
 
Amphetamine-type stimulants and new psychoactive substances (NPS) are produced in small 
quantities in clandestine labs throughout Serbia (primarily synthetic cannabinoids).  These drugs 
are mainly exported to Western Europe and the Middle East, but also supply a small but growing 
domestic market.  In 2018, seizures of cocaine, marijuana, and amphetamines decreased, while 
seizures of heroin increased by 12 percent.  The Ministry of Interior (MOI) reported that drugs 
continue to be trafficked along the “Balkan Route” into Europe, primarily entering Serbia from 
Kosovo and Albania, with Serbian drug trafficking groups facilitating logistics.  While Serbian 
authorities believe heroin and MDMA (ecstasy) use is declining within the country, NPS use is 
believed to be rising.  According to the Ministry of Interior’s (MOI) Counter-Narcotics Unit, 
fentanyl, fentanyl analogues, and ketamine have not been detected in Serbia, and precursor 
chemical diversion through the country has not been significant.  To better monitor the 
importation of possible precursor chemicals, Serbia’s 2005 Law on Precursor Drugs is being 
amended to require more stringent licenses and permits to better track the use of the chemicals.    
 
Serbia established the MOI Service for Abuse of Drugs and Drug Trafficking in 2014, which is 
responsible for drug-related investigations and addiction prevention programs.  Treatment and 
prevention of drug addiction is mainly the responsibility of the Ministry of Health, but 
nongovernmental organizations also provide services.  Bigger cities such as Belgrade, Nis, and 
Novi Sad have police units dedicated to curbing the use of illicit drugs and investigating drug-
related crimes.  Serbian law enforcement has been shifting to a more centralized approach by 
creating a database of criminals and investigations that can be accessed by all 27 departments 
throughout the country.   
 
The United States provides ongoing assistance to the MOI to support criminal justice capacity 
building.  The Serbian government also seeks to amplify its cooperation with regional partners to 
address drug trafficking throughout the Western Balkans, in line with European Union standards.

Spain 
 
Spain is a leading transit point in Europe for cocaine originating from South America and for 
hashish from Morocco.  Cocaine arrives in Spain in large containerized shipments and in lower-
volume shipments via recreational boats, sailboats, and within parasitic devices attached to cargo 
ships.  Transnational criminal organizations frequently traffic cocaine mixed within cargo to 
avoid detection.  Domestic illicit drug production is minor, although there are a small number of 
indoor cannabis cultivation operations and clandestine labs involved in cutting, mixing, and 
reconstituting cocaine and heroin. 
 
The drug control efforts of Spanish authorities have resulted in record-breaking drug seizures, 
utilizing strong border control and coastal monitoring; sophisticated geospatial detection 
technology; domestic police action; internal affairs investigations; and international cooperation.  
In 2017, the most recent year for which data is available, Spain seized and destroyed a record 
477 metric tons (MT) of illicit drugs.  The volume of seized cocaine more than doubled from 
2016, totaling 40.96 MT in 2017.  Heroin seizures more than doubled to 524 kilograms.  In April 
2018, Spanish authorities seized nearly nine MT of cocaine at the port of Algeciras, hidden in a 
shipment of bananas.  This was the largest cocaine seizure in European history.  In July 2018, 
Spain arrested 10 Algeciras stevedores who were working with drug cartels to facilitate 
trafficking through the port. 
 
In February 2018, the Spanish government approved a 2017-24 national strategy to fight drug 
addiction.  The strategy prioritizes equal access to treatment for minors, women, and the elderly.  
Spanish authorities estimate that 9.5 percent of Spaniards consume cannabis and two percent 
consume cocaine.   
 
Spain continued to enjoy excellent bilateral and multilateral law enforcement cooperation with 
international partners in 2018.  Cooperation on EU operations in the Mediterranean continued, 
and U.S. law enforcement agencies maintained strong working relationships with Spanish police 
and customs authorities, leading to significant drug seizures and arrests.  November 2018, 
Spain’s parliament approved new legislation to ban certain small high-speed watercraft from 
Spanish waters.  The law provides for the creation of a registry for exempted boats of this type – 
which are frequently used to smuggle illicit drugs, especially in the vicinity of the Strait of 
Gibraltar – and permits Spanish customs to seize unregistered ships regardless of whether drugs 
or other contraband are found onboard.

Suriname 
 
A.  Introduction  
 
Suriname is a transit zone for South American cocaine en route to Europe, Africa, and, to a lesser 
extent, the United States.  Cargo containers carry most illicit drugs smuggled through Suriname, 
but smaller fishing vessels, commercial and private air transport, and human couriers also 
conceal cocaine.  Suriname’s sparsely populated coastal region and isolated jungle interior, 
together with weak border controls and infrastructure, make illicit drug detection and interdiction 
efforts difficult.  There is little evidence of illicit drug production within Suriname.  
 
B.  Drug Control Accomplishments, Policies, and Trends  
 
 
1.  Institutional Development  
 
The Government of Suriname is officially opposed to illicit drug trafficking, but Suriname’s 
practical ability to apprehend and prosecute drug traffickers remains inhibited by drug-related 
corruption, bureaucratic hurdles, and the lack of financial and material resources.  The Suriname 
Police Force (KPS) is responsible for detecting and combating drug-related activities with five 
units having specific drug control responsibilities.  The KPS Narcotics Unit investigates and 
arrests individuals involved in trafficking illicit drugs, and the Narcotics Intelligence Unit 
gathers intelligence related to illegal drug trafficking.  At the country’s major international 
airport, the Combating International Drug Trafficking Unit (BID) screens passengers on 
outbound flights.  The BID team receives training from international experts, and is assisted by a 
canine unit for inspecting luggage.  
 
The Container Control Unit (CCP) is the fifth unit with specific drug control responsibilities.  It 
uses risk analysis and other proactive techniques to systematically target high-risk containers.  
The government replaced all members of the U.S.-funded, UN-implemented Container Control 
Unit at the Terminal of Jules Sedney Haven (Port of Paramaribo) in August 2018.  The Unit’s 
operating protocol requires permission and oversight of Surinamese Customs authorities during 
inspections. 
 
The Ministry of Justice and Police included the creation of an Integrated Security Plan in the 
2019 draft budget.  Under the plan, police, military, and the Directorate of National Security 
would intensify cooperation on a variety of security issues, including combatting the trafficking 
of illicit drugs and strengthening technical investigation skills.   
 
Drug prevention and control activities are coordinated by Suriname’s National Drug Master 
Plan, developed under the aegis of the National Antidrug Board.  This document is supposed to 
be developed every five years, but the most recent plan expired in 2015.  The Government of 
Suriname reported that a new plan for the period 2018-2022 was near completion at the end of 
2018. 
 
Suriname is a party to the Inter-American Convention against Corruption and Migrant 
Smuggling and the Inter-American Convention on Mutual Assistance in Criminal Matters.  Since 


INCSR 2019 Volume 1  
 
 
 
 
Country Reports 
251 
 
1976, Suriname has shared drug-related information with the Netherlands as part of a mutual 
legal assistance agreement among former Dutch colonies to exchange crime-related data.  
Suriname has also signed bilateral agreements to combat drug trafficking with Brazil, Venezuela, 
and Colombia.  A comprehensive bilateral maritime counterdrug enforcement agreement 
between the United States and Suriname has been in force since 1999.  Suriname does not have a 
mutual legal assistance agreement or extradition treaty in place with the United States. 
  
 
2.  Supply Reduction 
 
Suriname is not a source country for illicit drugs or precursor chemicals, but it continues to be a 
transshipment point for illicit drugs.  During the first nine months of 2018, Surinamese 
authorities seized approximately 648 kilograms (kg) of cocaine; 16.4 liters of liquid cocaine; 
569.1 kg of marijuana; 875 grams of hashish; 524 grams of MDMA (ecstasy) powder; and 504 
MDMA tablets.  Authorities seized less cocaine, but more marijuana and MDMA compared to 
the first three quarters of 2017.  With support from U.S. authorities, Surinamese law enforcement 
agencies seized a self-propelled semi-submersible vessel in Saramacca on March 1, 2018, the 
first ever seized in Suriname.  Local authorities seized a Cessna 210 aircraft containing 488 kg of 
cocaine two weeks later.  The Attorney General’s Office received 139 drug-related cases from 
police for additional investigation and brought 71 cases to court. 
 
 
3.  Public Information, Prevention, and Treatment  
 
Illicit drug use is relatively rare in Suriname, with marijuana being the primary drug consumed 
locally.  Police have warned of growing use of MDMA in powder form (locally called “sukru”) 
as a party drug.  There is one government-run detoxification center, and other treatment centers 
are run by non-governmental organizations.  The government’s National Antidrug Board (NAR) 
continued awareness activities including meeting with drug prevention and treatment 
stakeholders. 
     
4.  Corruption  
 
As a policy matter, the Government of Suriname does not encourage or facilitate illegal activity 
associated with drug trafficking.  However, widespread and credible allegations suggest that 
corruption pervades many government offices and that corruption has influenced the 
government’s investigation of some cases.  The National Parliament passed an anti-corruption 
law in September 2017.  President Desire Bouterse had not signed the act into force as of 
October 2018.  The Minister of Justice and Police announced his intention to create an integrity 
commission after 10 police officers were arrested, five on narcotics-related charges, in a span of 
three weeks.  
 
Local criminal investigations and prosecutions of alleged corrupt acts are rare.  However, in 
October a court convicted and sentenced a customs officer to nine months in prison and a 
customs broker to two months in prison in one of the largest drug trafficking cases of 2017, an 
attempt to smuggle 395 kg by shipping container.  Courts in the Netherlands, France, and the 
United States convicted senior government officials of drug trafficking in previous reporting 
periods.

C.  National Goals, Bilateral Cooperation, and U.S. Policy Initiatives  
 
The United States supports a range of efforts designed to address crime and violence in 
Suriname, primarily through the Caribbean Basin Security Initiative (CBSI).  CBSI is a security 
partnership between the United States and Caribbean nations that seeks to substantially reduce 
illicit trafficking, advance public safety and citizen security, and promote justice.  CBSI support 
to Suriname includes training and equipment, primarily to the KPS and justice sector actors, to 
prevent and interdict drug trafficking, enhance border enforcement capabilities, and combat 
money laundering.  Recent changes to weaken the structure of KPS support for drug control 
efforts, if not remedied, will complicate U.S.-Suriname bilateral efforts. 
 
D.  Conclusion 
 
Suriname continues to be a transit country for illicit drugs originating in South America.  The 
United States encourages the Government of Suriname to combat corruption and take further 
steps to increase the effectiveness of drug interdiction efforts within the country, as well as 
subsequent investigations and prosecutions.

Tajikistan 
 
A.  Introduction  
  
Tajikistan sits astride one of several illicit drug trafficking routes for opiates and cannabis 
leaving Afghanistan en route to markets in Russia and Eastern Europe, and to a lesser extent, 
Central Asia.  Known as the “Northern Route,” a 2018 United Nations Office on Drugs and 
Crime report estimates that between 2011 and 2015, 44 to 74 metric tons of heroin transited the 
route annually, the bulk of which is believed to have transited Tajikistan to the Kyrgyz Republic 
and Uzbekistan.  During the same period, Tajikistan accounted for 34 percent of all opiate 
seizures in Central Asia.  However, the actual amounts seized compared to the estimated flows 
trafficked through the country were strikingly low.  
 
After several years of decline, the first nine months of 2018 saw an increase in opiate seizures in 
Tajikistan.  It remains unclear whether the increase is directly linked to an increase in heroin 
production resulting from the record opium crop in Afghanistan in 2017. 
 
As in past years, the number of registered drug users in the country (primarily heroin users) 
remains relatively unchanged; however, that may be more a result of the way individuals are 
enrolled in the program than indicative of a stable drug-use population.  Anecdotal information 
indicates the price of street-level heroin increased substantially in 2018 as availability may have 
declined. 
 
B.  Drug Control Accomplishments, Policies, and Trends 
  
 
1.  Institutional Development 
  
Tajikistan’s drug investigative and interdiction agencies are capable and have the needed 
legislative tools.  U.S. law enforcement authorities cooperate well with their Tajik counterparts 
on drug cases, but Tajikistan’s focus appears to be on the domestic market rather than 
interdicting drugs transiting to foreign markets.  This issue is exacerbated by a lack of feedback 
and information sharing by other international partners.   
 
In 2018, U.S. government drug control assistance focused on Tajikistan’s Drug Control Agency 
under the President of Tajikistan (DCA) and supported training, equipment and infrastructure 
projects.   
 
Tajikistan does not have an extradition or mutual legal assistance treaty with the United States, 
though Tajikistan is party to multilateral conventions that enable law enforcement cooperation. 
 
 
2.  Supply Reduction  
  
According to statistics provided by the DCA, the total volume of all illicit drug seized during the 
first nine months of 2018 was approximately 3.27 metric tons, a three percent decrease from the 
same period in 2017.  The decline is attributed to a 42 percent decline in the amount of hashish 
and cannabis interdicted.  However, opiate seizures increased overall by 42 percent, with 201 


INCSR 2019 Volume 1  
 
 
 
 
Country Reports 
254 
 
kilograms (kg) and 1,313 kg of heroin and opium seized, respectively.  When compared to the 
same period in 2017, heroin seizures increased by 74 percent, while seized opium increased by 
38 percent.  The reason given for the increase in opiate seizures according to government 
officials was the large opium crop in Afghanistan, which they believed resulted in an increase in 
heroin manufacture and export.  All agencies involved in drug interdiction or investigation saw 
increases in opiate seizures, while simultaneously seeing a decline in cannabis seizures.  During 
the first nine months of 2018, over 15,500 MDMA (ecstasy) tablets were seized, a significant 
increase compared to 2017. 
 
Tajik authorities estimated that the street price per kilogram of heroin from January to July 
increased from $7,000 to $8,000, while the kilogram price of opium during that period declined 
from $1,600 to $1,200. 
 
There were 266 kg of the precursor chemical acetic anhydride seized in 2018.  Historically, the 
Northern Route has not been a conduit for precursors entering Afghanistan, the ultimate 
destination for the chemical.     
 
 
3.  Public Information, Prevention, and Treatment 
 
There are 6,888 registered persons with substance use disorders in Tajikistan, down slightly from 
the 6,930 in 2017.  Individuals can elect to register for five years, which means their number 
remains relatively stable year to year.  Being registered is a last resort for most users, since it 
denies the use government employment, a driver’s license and, because a marriage permit 
requires a drug test, the ability to marry.  However, if they elect to, registration allows 
intravenous drug users to receive methadone through internationally funded HIV prevention 
projects.   
 
A recent U.S. government funded survey estimated there were between 29,000 and 50,000 
intravenous drug users in Tajikistan.  Anecdotal information indicates that street-level heroin 
was harder to obtain in 2018, with the dosage-unit price increasing substantially in the past year, 
forcing low-income addicts to find other drugs, generally less expensive and easily obtained 
prescription pain killers.  Opium is abused more than heroin.  Crystal methamphetamine is 
available, but its higher price limits its use to the wealthy.  New psychoactive substances have 
yet to make an impact on the local drug market.  
 
 
4.  Corruption 
  
In stated policy, the Government of Tajikistan does not encourage or facilitate illegal activity 
associated with drug trafficking.  In April 2018, the deputy head of the Ministry of Internal 
Affairs drug investigation section was arrested for soliciting a bribe.  Under a 2016 law, he was 
convicted in October, fined $8,700, released, and ordered by the court to return the 
approximately $19,700 bribe he received.  That law was amended in mid-2018, making 
imprisonment mandatory for future cases.  Extremely low salaries for state workers, the 
profitability of illegal drugs, and the dearth of other profitable business options all contribute to 
corruption within the country’s counterdrug forces.

C.  National Goals, Bilateral Cooperation, and U.S. Policy Initiatives 
   
During the first nine months of 2018, the U.S. government contributed or dedicated $4.9 million 
in assistance to Tajikistan’s drug control efforts.  The aid consisted of training, buildings, 
equipment and other expenses.  Most of the assistance focused on the DCA, the principal drug 
enforcement organization in the country.  The U.S. government has a strong relationship with the 
DCA. 
 
D.  Conclusion 
  
After years of decline, increased seizures are a positive indicator of effort, but seizures still 
remain very low as a percentage of the estimated amount of drugs transiting Tajikistan.  The 
increase in price and drop in availability of heroin at the street level may result from increased 
effectiveness of law enforcement conducting local investigations.  However, there may be other 
factors influencing availability.

Tanzania 
 
Tanzania is a significant transit country for illicit drugs.  Domestic drug use is also increasing.  
Tanzania-based trafficking organizations and courier networks operate globally, and play a 
prominent role in the Southwest Asian heroin trade.  In 2018, Tanzanian courts convicted and 
upheld convictions of numerous drug traffickers.  During the year, Tanzanian authorities 
demonstrated increased interdiction capacity with several seizures resulting from authorities’ 
quick response to real time intelligence.  In several incidents, Tanzanian citizens were arrested 
for narcotics trafficking in various African and Asian countries.   
 
Tanzania’s geographical location, prevalence of corruption, and porous borders present 
considerable challenges to drug interdiction.  Traffickers exploit Tanzania’s 854 mile coastline 
and inadequate security at Tanzanian seaports.  Southwest Asian heroin is transported in multi-
hundred kilogram quantities by small vessels to Zanzibar and the Tanzanian coastline.  Large 
quantities of heroin transit Tanzania’s land border with Kenya for transshipment to Europe and 
North America.  Smaller amounts (three to five kilograms) are trafficked to Europe, India, and 
North America from Dar es Salaam via commercial flights and air cargo.  South American 
cocaine is trafficked into Tanzania by air for further international distribution.  Tanzania 
produces cannabis and khat for domestic consumption and regional distribution. 
 
The Tanzanian Drug Control and Enforcement Authority (DCEA), the Tanzania Intelligence and 
Security Service (TISS), the Tanzanian Police Service’s Anti-Narcotics Unit, the Tanzanian 
Peoples Defence Force (TPDF), and Tanzanian Maritime Police contribute to Tanzania’s fight 
against illicit drug trafficking.  These agencies work with U.S. and other international law 
enforcement partners.  Regional cooperation on drug interdiction is improving. 
 
Extradition between Tanzania and the United States is governed by the 1931 U.S.-U.K. 
Extradition Treaty.  There is no bilateral mutual legal assistance treaty between Tanzania and the 
United States, though both countries are parties to various multilateral conventions with 
provisions for assistance. 
 
The Government of Tanzania does not encourage or facilitate the production or trafficking of 
illicit drugs as a matter of policy, but corruption remains a barrier to effective enforcement.  
Drug traffickers use their considerable financial resources to influence politicians, law 
enforcement officers, and others in positions of power.  
 
The United States promotes improved interdiction operations through law enforcement 
cooperation and by encouraging a strong Tanzanian government commitment to drug 
interdiction, combatting corruption, and improving criminal justice and rule of law.

Thailand 
 
A.  Introduction 
 
Thailand remains a drug transit route for trafficking to international markets, and domestic drug 
use is a significant challenge.  Thailand does not cultivate or produce any significant quantities 
of opiates, methamphetamine, or other illicit drugs.  Various transnational criminal organizations 
continue to exploit Thailand as a destination and transit country for heroin and amphetamine-
type stimulants (ATS) originating from Myanmar, specifically methamphetamine.   
 
According to the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime, the Thai government has not 
reported eradicating opium poppy since 2013.  However, in 2017, the Thai Office of Narcotics 
Control Board (ONCB) reported that approximately 1.97 metric tons (MT) of opium poppy 
plants were seized during the first six months of 2017, compared to 662.2 kilograms (kg) during 
all of 2016.  Heroin seizures have increased in Thailand since a significant drop in 2015, and 
methamphetamine seizures have also increased since 2016.   
 
B.  Drug Control Accomplishments, Policies, and Trends 
 
 
1.  Institutional Development 
 
The Narcotics Act 2522 (1979) and the Psychotropic Substances Act 2518 (1975) are the 
primary laws relating to drug offenses in Thailand.  The Narcotics Control Board (NCB) has 
overall responsibility for the prevention and suppression of illegal drug use.  The Act on 
Measures for the Suppression of Offenders in an Offence Relating to Narcotics 2534 (1991) 
provides for asset seizure related to drug trafficking cases.  Criminal penalties vary by narcotics 
classification, generally ranging from the imposition of fines to life imprisonment.  Thai law 
provides for capital punishment for those convicted of possession of more than 20 grams of 
Schedule I substances with “intent to sell” though the death penalty is not commonly imposed; 
the last reported execution of a drug offender was in 2009. 
 
Thailand has bilateral extradition and mutual legal assistance treaties with the United States.  
Thailand is an effective and cooperative partner, with U.S. assistance facilitating and enhancing 
that cooperation. 
 
 
2.  Supply Reduction  
 
Methamphetamine production and trafficking by non-state armed groups and other regional 
producers in neighboring Burma remains a serious challenge for Thailand.  Thai authorities 
estimate that 90 percent of the crystal methamphetamine smuggled into Thailand enters across 
the Burma border.  While a portion of the methamphetamine is intended for the domestic Thai 
market, most of it is trafficked to other Asian markets.  A notable amount is trafficked south 
from Thailand into Malaysia.  Seizures were at record levels in 2018.  Between January and 
September, Thailand seized approximately 12.97 MT of crystal methamphetamine, compared to 
a total of 7.61 MT total during all of 2017.  Thailand is similarly on track to surpass record high 
seizure totals of methamphetamine tablets (“yaba”) from 2017.  As of September 2018, Thailand 


INCSR 2019 Volume 1  
 
 
 
 
Country Reports 
258 
 
had seized 222 million yaba tablets compared to 239.9 million total tablets during all of 2017.  
Despite the uptick in seizures, the price of yaba has decreased by approximately 40-50 percent in 
the Bangkok metropolitan area, suggesting an expansion in supply. 
 
Similar to the methamphetamine trade, heroin supplies trafficked through Thailand also 
originates largely from Burma.  Thai authorities report the involvement of West African crime 
syndicates that use Thai nationals (generally females) to carry drugs onward to China, Malaysia, 
and other regional markets.  Heroin seizures remained largely stable in 2018.  During the first 
nine months of 2018, Thai authorities reported seizing 570 kg of heroin, compared to 593 kg 
during same period in 2017.  
 
MDMA (known locally as “ya-E” or “ecstasy”) is typically smuggled into Thailand from 
Malaysia.  Domestic use is trending upward, but is largely confined to Bangkok and other tourist 
areas.  Tablets remain relatively expensive with a street price ranging from $12-18.  As of 
September 2018, Thai authorities had seized 187,163 tablets.  
 
Cocaine trafficking and abuse remains limited in the domestic market.  Annual cocaine seizures 
are generally around 50 kg and have never exceeded 70 kg.  During the first nine months of 
2018, Thai authorities seized approximately 22 kg of cocaine.  Thai authorities attribute most 
cocaine trafficking to West African crime syndicates, which largely smuggle cocaine from South 
America via air transport. 
 
Marijuana continues to be readily available throughout Thailand and the region.  Though limited 
quantities of cannabis are cultivated domestically, most of the marijuana seized in Thailand 
originates from Laos.  Marijuana seizures are trending downward.  Through September 2018, 
Thai authorities had seized a total of 13.19 MT, compared to an average of 30 MT in previous 
years. 
 
 
3.  Public Information, Prevention, and Treatment 
 
Substance abuse has been a high-profile social and public health problem in Thailand for 
decades.  According to press reporting and academic studies, an estimated three million people 
between the ages of 12-65 years old, or 5.8 percent of the total population, have used at least one 
illegal addictive substance at some point in their lives.  Thailand carries out comprehensive 
demand reduction programs, combining drug use prevention programs with treatment for those 
suffering from substance use disorders.  Drug treatment and rehabilitation is offered at hospitals, 
as well as some military camps, temples, and mosques. Methadone use is approved for 
detoxification treatment under the national health coverage.  
 
 
4.  Corruption  
 
Official corruption remains a challenge in Thailand and the sale of illicit drugs is sometimes 
facilitated by complicit law enforcement officers.  As a matter of policy, though, the Thai 
government does not permit, encourage, or facilitate illicit production or distribution of 
narcotic/psychotropic drugs or other controlled substances, or the laundering of drug proceeds, 
by individuals or government agencies.  Thai authorities frequently prosecute corrupt officials.

C.  National Goals, Bilateral Cooperation, and U.S. Policy Initiatives 
 
The United States and Thailand enjoy a strong cooperative relationship on law enforcement 
matters.  The U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) and other federal law enforcement 
agencies continued to work closely with their Thai counterparts on coordinated investigations in 
2018.  Thailand is one of several countries in which DEA maintains Sensitive Investigative Units 
(SIUs).  Thai SIU participants receive specialized training and undergo a rigorous vetting 
process. 
 
Additionally, the United States provides a stream of training and assistance to Thai law 
enforcement and criminal justice entities specific to drug trafficking.  Through the International 
Law Enforcement Academy and other programs, the United States and Thailand are working to 
enhance regional cooperation to combat transnational crime.  The United States also provides 
training and other assistance to Thai customs officials, Thai Maritime Police, and other law 
enforcement authorities to improve border protection and investigation skills.  Thailand uses 
U.S.-developed curriculum to support training and professionalization of its substance treatment 
workforce.  With U.S. support, the program is establishing a cadre of national trainers who will 
disseminate the training throughout the country. 
 
D.  Conclusion  
 
The U.S. government enjoys a particularly close and collaborative relationship with Thai law 
enforcement.  The United States will continue to assist the Thai government to promote greater 
cooperation between its police and prosecutors, prevent corruption, and further advance regional 
drug control cooperation.

Trinidad and Tobago 
 
A.  Introduction 
 
Trinidad and Tobago is a twin-island nation in the Southern Caribbean.  The country’s close 
proximity to Venezuela, porous borders, and direct transportation routes to Europe, the United 
States, and Canada make it an ideal location for illicit drug transshipment.  While there is some 
local marijuana production, the majority of marijuana consumed domestically is imported from 
other islands in the Caribbean and South America.  Cocaine and other illicit drugs also transit the 
country or remain on the islands for domestic consumption. 
 
The Trinidad and Tobago government continues to make incremental progress in its ability to 
investigate drug cases, but remains challenged by insufficient resources and capacity.  Law 
enforcement seized more marijuana and cocaine in 2018 compared to 2017.  The government 
remains committed to drug demand reduction, though treatment capacity is under-resourced and 
there is a lack of comprehensive data regarding domestic drug use. 
 
B.  Drug Control Accomplishments, Policies, and Trends 
 
1.  Institutional Development 
 
Trinidad and Tobago demonstrates continued commitment to drug control through bilateral 
cooperation with the United States and other countries.  Trinidad and Tobago’s drug control 
institutions, however, remain challenged by deficiencies in staffing and funding.  There are 
ongoing efforts to break down existing silos within Trinidad and Tobago’s intelligence 
community, the military, law enforcement, and other agencies, though distrust continues to 
impede coordination. 
 
In May, Trinidad and Tobago’s Parliament passed an Anti-Gang Act, now in effect, that 
criminalizes gang membership and otherwise aims to suppress criminal gang activity, which are 
viewed by the country’s authorities as among the primary drivers of drug trafficking and violent 
crime.  In August, the government named a new Minister of National Security, and appointed its 
first permanent Commissioner of Police since 2012.  Though the government’s draft 2019 budget 
proposes a slight decrease overall for national security matters, there are a number of initiatives 
to enhance police effectiveness, including a broad restructuring of the police service, which 
could improve drug control efforts. 
 
Trinidad and Tobago, in collaboration with the Organization of American States’ Inter-American 
Drug Abuse Control Commission, also continues to expand a Regional Counterdrug Intelligence 
Training School to serve the English-speaking member states in the Caribbean. 
 
Trinidad and Tobago has mutual legal assistance treaties with the United States, Canada, and the 
United Kingdom.  The country is also party with the United States to a drug control and law 
enforcement letter of agreement; a maritime law enforcement agreement that enables the United

and Tobago Coast Guard vessels to board suspected ships in Trinidad and Tobago waters; and a 
customs mutual assistance agreement, which allows for the exchange of information to assist in 
the prevention and investigation of customs offenses.  
 
The United States also maintains an extradition treaty with Trinidad and Tobago, and the 
Trinidad and Tobago government is largely cooperative with respect to extradition and mutual 
legal assistance matters. 
 
2.  Supply Reduction 
 
Marijuana is the only known locally produced illicit drug in Trinidad and Tobago. Production is 
concentrated in small farms in heavily forested, mountainous regions.  Traditionally, local 
producers compete with imports from St. Vincent and the Grenadines, Jamaica, and Guyana that 
are perceived to be of a higher quality.  Law enforcement information suggests that marijuana 
continues to enter the country via Venezuela, as part of a trend of increased trade of both licit 
and illicit goods between the two countries.  
 
Other illicit drugs, primarily cocaine, are trafficked through the country by local and 
transnational organized crime groups, exploiting its close proximity to Venezuela, porous 
coastlines, and vulnerabilities at ports of entry.  The main destination for these drugs continues to 
be the European market, often via Africa, but some also reach the United States and Canada.  
Criminal groups utilize commercial airlines, cargo ships, and small, privately owned boats and 
yachts to transport illicit drugs.  Anecdotal reports continue to suggest that small amounts of 
ketamine originating from Asia are also trafficked through the country. 
 
Trinidad and Tobago law enforcement entities seized approximately 1.34 metric tons of 
marijuana and 325 kilograms (kg) of cocaine within the country during the first nine months of 
2018, compared to seizures totaling approximately 956 kg and 47 kg, respectively, for the same 
period in 2017.  Robust crop, seedling, and cured plant eradications continued in 2018. 
 
3.  Public Information, Prevention, and Treatment 
 
Information on drug-use trends in Trinidad and Tobago is largely anecdotal given the lack of 
comprehensive data.  The primary drug used is marijuana, followed by cocaine.  Drug treatment 
professionals assess that drug usage continues to increase among youth.  There are a number of 
drug treatment programs in Trinidad and Tobago supported by the government, non-
governmental organizations, religious groups, and hospitals.  
 
Trinidad and Tobago’s 2014 National Drug Policy and its companion Operational Plan for Drug 
Control in Trinidad and Tobago 2014-2018 aim to reduce both the supply of and demand for 
illegal drugs.  Drug prevention efforts include school-based education programs, training for 
educators, anti-drug media campaigns, and special outreach events.  The United States supported 
adolescent drug intervention training in 2018, including for police, prison, and probation officers.  
The United States also supported a Juvenile Court Project, which established two children’s 
courts, promoted innovative youth peer resolution mechanisms, and introduced a restorative

justice approach to managing youth in conflict with the law, including with respect to drug 
matters. 
  
4.  Corruption 
 
The Government of Trinidad and Tobago neither directly encourages nor facilitates the illicit 
production or distribution of drugs nor the laundering of proceeds from the sale of illicit drugs.  
No charges of drug-related corruption were filed against senior government officials in 2018.  
Media and anecdotal reports of drug-related corruption in the ranks of the Police Service, Prison 
Service, Defense Force, Customs and Excise Division, and port employees are common.  
 
C.  National Goals, Bilateral Cooperation, and U.S. Policy Initiatives 
 
The United States supports a wide range of efforts designed to address crime and violence 
affecting citizens in Trinidad and Tobago, primarily through the Caribbean Basin Security 
Initiative (CBSI).  CBSI is a security partnership between the United States and Caribbean 
nations that seeks to substantially reduce illicit drug trafficking, advance public safety and citizen 
security, and promote justice.  The Trinidad and Tobago government is an active partner in CBSI 
programs.  
 
Through CBSI, the United States continues to provide training and support to law enforcement 
and security agencies responsible for drug control, including the Police Service, Transnational 
Organized Crime Unit, Customs and Excise Division, Prison Service, and Coast Guard.  This 
support, together with joint law enforcement cooperation on drug trafficking investigations, 
resulted in a number of substantial drug seizures in 2018.  In May, for example, the Trinidad and 
Tobago Police Service’s Organized Crime and Intelligence Unit arrested and charged five airport 
personnel for attempting to smuggle 86.8 kg of cocaine – with an estimated street value of 
approximately $34 million – bound for New York from Trinidad’s Piarco International Airport.  
 
The United States maintains a bilateral agreement with Trinidad and Tobago to suppress illicit 
traffic by sea and air.  This agreement includes provisions for ship boarding, shipriders, pursuit, 
entry to investigate, and over flight of territorial seas. 
 
D.  Conclusion 
 
The United States and Trinidad and Tobago enjoy a cooperative relationship against drug 
trafficking and transnational organized crime.  The individuals and units working to combat drug 
trafficking in Trinidad and Tobago, however, continue to face considerable institutional 
challenges.  The Trinidad and Tobago government should continue to implement reforms to 
improve the capacity of its law enforcement and criminal justice institutions to detect drug 
trafficking and effectively investigate, arrest, and prosecute suspected drug traffickers in a timely 
manner.

Turkey 
 
Turkey remains a transit country for illicit drug trafficking.  Heroin, opium, and cocaine are 
generally trafficked through Turkey to European markets, and amphetamine-type stimulants 
(ATS) are trafficked to markets in the Middle East and Southeast Asia.  Turkish authorities 
continue to seize large amounts of opiates and hashish in Turkey.  Cooperation is inhibited by 
the Government of Turkey’s detention of a U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) local 
staff member for more than a year without charge. 
 
The Turkish National Police Counter Narcotics Department is the country’s most proactive 
counterdrug force.  DEA works with the Counter Narcotics Department.  Components of the 
Ministry of Interior, also have some drug control responsibilities, and the Ministry of Health is 
responsible for regulating pharmaceutical products and the importation of chemicals for 
legitimate use.  The United States offers regional training opportunities to Turkish officials to 
provide additional skills to combat the illicit drug trade, although no Turkish official participated 
in trainings in 2018.   
 
Most heroin trafficked via Turkey is destined for Western Europe.  Turkey is also a transit route 
for opiates smuggled from Afghanistan via Iran.  Turkish smugglers are frequently involved in 
both heroin sales and transport, as well as production and smuggling of synthetic drugs.  
Transnational criminal networks reportedly have interests in heroin conversion laboratories 
operating in Iran near the Turkish border.  The government strictly controls licit opium poppy 
cultivation and pharmaceutical morphine production, with no apparent diversion into the illicit 
market.   
 
Turkey is a transit route for methamphetamine smuggled from Iran and bound for Southeast 
Asia, as well as amphetamine-type stimulants from Eastern Europe destined for the Middle East.  
Cocaine is trafficked from South America through Turkey to Europe.  Hashish is imported or 
grown domestically for local consumption.   
 
According to Turkish authorities, during the first 10 months of 2018, Turkish authorities seized 
more than 71 metric tons (MT) of marijuana; nearly 15 MT of heroin; more than one MT of 
cocaine; nearly 300 kilograms (kg) of opium; nearly 400 kg of methamphetamine; seven million 
MDMA (ecstasy) tablets; and 16 million fenethylline tablets.   
 
Illegal drug use in Turkey is relatively low, compared to other countries in the region, but there 
seems to be an increase in the number of people seeking treatment.  Turkey does not encourage 
or facilitate illicit production or distribution of narcotics or other controlled substances, or the 
laundering of proceeds from illegal drug transactions.  No senior-level government official is 
alleged to have participated in such activities in 2018.

Ukraine 
 
Although Ukraine is not a major drug source country, its location astride several important drug 
trafficking routes into Western Europe leaves it vulnerable as an important transit country.  
Ukraine’s numerous ports on the Black and Azov seas, its extensive river routes, and its porous 
northern and eastern borders make Ukraine an attractive route for drug traffickers into the 
European Union’s (EU) illicit drug market. 
 
Heroin from Afghanistan is trafficked through Russia, the Caucasus, and Turkey, before passing 
through Ukraine.  Latin American cocaine is moved through Ukrainian seaports and airports for 
both domestic use and further transit to EU countries.  Ukrainian law enforcement occasionally 
interdicts large shipments of drugs in commercial shipments transiting southern ports.  Usually, 
however, drugs are found in small quantities, ranging from several grams to several hundred 
grams.  Russian aggression in eastern Ukraine, including arming, training, and fighting alongside 
separatists, has created a new vulnerability for drug transit through the region. 
 
The use of synthetic drugs and psychotropic substances, especially amphetamine-type stimulants, 
has been rapidly increasing in Ukraine over the past decade, following international trends.  
Synthetic drugs are trafficked to Ukraine primarily from Poland, Lithuania, and the Netherlands, 
but they are also produced locally in small clandestine labs. 
 
Most domestic drug abuse, however, continues to be focused on drugs made from illicit drug 
crops (cannabis and opium poppy) grown in the region.  These account for more than 90 percent 
of the total drug market in Ukraine.  In most instances, these drugs are either locally produced or 
supplied from Russia and Moldova. 
 
During the first 10 months of 2018, Ukrainian law enforcement agencies (National Police of 
Ukraine, or NPU) reportedly detected and disrupted 37 international drug trafficking routes, 
dismantled 115 clandestine labs, and eliminated 63 organized criminal drug trafficking groups.  
Approximately 3.89 metric tons of narcotics, psychotropic drugs, and other controlled substances 
were seized, including 38.9 kilograms (kg) of cocaine and 32 kg of psychotropic drugs.     
 
The United States is providing assistance to help Ukraine bring its law enforcement institutions 
up to European standards, facilitating Ukraine’s integration into Euro-Atlantic institutions.  The 
U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration has established good working relationships across the 
Ukrainian law enforcement sector, and ongoing training programs have deepened these 
relationships.  Through a variety of projects, the United States also assists the NPU in developing 
its capacities while simultaneously strengthening the Border Guards capability to control 
Ukraine’s 3,490 mile-long border.

United Kingdom 
 
Although the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland (UK) is not a source 
country for illicit drugs, it faces a serious domestic drug problem and is a major consumer and 
transshipment country.  Transnational criminal organizations continue to engage in drug 
trafficking within the UK, as well as additional criminal activity to include violent and financial 
crimes.  Demand in the UK for all common forms of illicit drugs is high.  The country’s 
consumption rates for cocaine and heroin are among the highest in Europe.  There are significant 
seizures of cannabis at UK borders, and UK authorities regularly disrupt domestic cannabis 
growth, varying from as few as 10 plants to warehouse quantities.  “Crack” cocaine use has 
increased, particularly in rural and coastal towns.  Crack cocaine has been linked to drug-
trafficking networks active in England, Wales, and Scotland.   
 
Fentanyl and fentanyl analogues are also present in the UK, though not on the scale seen in 
North America.  Although testing limitations prevent UK authorities from fully ascertaining the 
scale of the problem, 122 fentanyl-related deaths were recorded from between 2017 and March 
2018.  Most fentanyl and fentanyl-related analogues available in the UK are manufactured in 
China and purchased on restricted internet sites, the so-called “Dark Web.”  In 2018, the 
National Crime Agency reported its first conviction for trafficking in fentanyl.  Unlike the 
United States, where historic widespread availability of prescription medicine was a driving 
force for opioid abuse and the use of fentanyl, there is far less prescription opioid abuse in the 
UK.  As the illicit online trade grows, the UK is among the largest global purchasers of drugs on 
the Dark Web, and a survey taken in 2018  showed that more than a quarter of British drug users 
bought substances on the Dark Web paying with cryptocurrency.   
 
The United States and the United Kingdom enjoy an excellent bilateral relationship and 
cooperate closely on multilateral drug enforcement efforts.  U.S. authorities continue to conduct 
coordinated drug trafficking and money laundering investigations with the UK National Crime 
Agency and Metropolitan Police Service, as well as Police Scotland, the Police Services of 
Northern Ireland, and other UK law enforcement agencies.  U.S. authorities also regularly 
provide lead information on drug shipments bound for the UK, including couriers, parcels, and 
containerized cargo.

Uzbekistan 
 
A. Introduction 
 
Sharing an 85-mile border with Afghanistan, Uzbekistan remains a significant transit country for 
Afghan opiates.  Traffickers exploit the country’s shared borders with Afghanistan and 
Tajikistan to smuggle illicit drugs through Uzbekistan primarily to Russia and Europe.  
Criminals capitalize on Uzbekistan’s good infrastructure, corruption, and rugged border terrain 
to traffic drugs.  Uzbekistan’s long, poorly protected border with Tajikistan presents the 
country’s biggest challenge to interdicting illicit drugs.  Ten border crossing points along the 
Tajik-Uzbek border re-opened in 2018 after having been closed for more than a decade, 
increasing the risk of drug trafficking.   
 
B. Drug Control Accomplishments, Policies, and Trends 
 
 
1. Institutional Development 
 
Uzbekistan’s drug control strategy is detailed in the “Program of Complex Measures on 
Counteracting Drug Abuse and Illicit Trafficking for 2016-2020.”  The strategy outlines 
government agency responsibilities to restrict illicit drug trafficking, reduce demand, prevent 
abuse, improve enforcement-related legislation, and cooperate with international partners.  The 
Ministry of Interior, the State Security Service, the State Border Protection Committee, and the 
State Customs Committee are responsible for combatting narcotics trafficking, while the 
National Information and Analytical Center for Drug Control (NCDC) oversees policy 
coordination, data collection, and capacity development, but does not have an operational role.  
An NCDC-led interagency working group is drafting a law to amend the Criminal Code and 
relevant regulations to include provisions for new psychoactive substances (NPS).    
 
Uzbekistan shares drug enforcement information with its neighbors through the Central Asia 
Regional Information and Coordination Center (CARICC) and has two law enforcement 
professionals working on the CARICC staff in Almaty, Kazakhstan.  Uzbekistan also participates 
in several regional programs implemented by the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime 
(UNODC), including the Container Control and Border Liaison Office programs, as well as the 
Central Asia and South Caucasus Mutual Legal Assistance Network.  Uzbekistan has signed 
cooperation agreements with other Central Asian countries, Russia, Latvia, the Czech Republic, 
Japan, and China.  Cooperation is generally focused on programs rather than operational 
activities.  
 
Uzbekistan has neither an extradition treaty nor mutual legal assistance agreement with the 
United States.  The U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) has Memoranda of 
Understanding (MOUs) in place for joint investigative activities and intelligence exchanges with 
the Ministry of Interior and the Office of the Prosecutor General’s Financial Intelligence Unit 
dedicated to money laundering investigations.  The DEA also has an MOU with the NCDC, 
facilitating information sharing and joint training.

Uzbekistan is not a significant source country of illicit drugs.  Although Uzbek officials identify 
the country’s poorly protected border with Tajikistan as the biggest challenge to interdicting 
smuggled drugs, it is likely that significant quantities also enter the country through official 
border crossing points, primarily from Tajikistan and Kyrgyzstan. 
 
On an annual basis, Uzbekistan conducts a “Black Poppy” eradication campaign to destroy 
illicitly cultivated opium poppy and cannabis.  In 2017, the last year for which information is 
available, Uzbek authorities uncovered 895 cases of illegal drug cultivation – a 16 percent 
decrease from 2016 – and eradicated an aggregate cultivated area of 0.33 hectares.  During the 
first six months of 2018, Uzbek authorities registered 2,332 drug-related offenses – a 22 percent 
drop from the same period in 2017 – and detained 1,751 persons.  Also during the first six 
months of 2018, the government reported seizing 188.1 kilograms (kg) of marijuana; 179.1 kg of 
opium; 33 kg of hashish; and 14.9 kg of heroin.  Opium seizures have dropped considerably 
since 2016, declining 44.8 percent by volume in 2017 and again by 76.6 percent during the first 
six months of 2018 in comparison to the same period in 2017.  The NCDC attributes this decline 
to enhanced deterrence due to interdiction efforts at the country’s borders, as well as to changing 
patterns of drug trafficking from Afghanistan that might be reducing the flow of drugs through 
Uzbekistan.  The United States lacks sufficient information to verify these claims. 
 
By volume, reported NPS seizures in 2017 fell to 361 grams from 579 grams in 2016.  However, 
the NCDC believes that drug use within Uzbekistan is shifting away from Afghan-sourced 
opioids to NPS and synthetic drugs, particularly Iranian-sourced methamphetamine and synthetic 
cannabinoids known locally as “spice” from China.  During the first six months of 2018, the 
authorities seized 247 NPS substances.   
 
 
3. Public Information, Prevention, and Treatment 
 
Official data on domestic drug consumption is unreliable.  According to the latest available 
official statistics from 2017, the number of registered drug users declined by 23 percent from 
2016 to 8,036.  Of this population, heroin users constituted 32.6 percent, and cannabis users 32.2 
percent.  UNODC estimates that only 2.3 percent of drug users are female.  The last study of 
drug use prevalence in Uzbekistan was conducted in 2006 by UNODC.   
 
Uzbekistan administers demand reduction and treatment programs.  The government regularly 
organizes outreach to school administrators on addiction prevention and support to persons with 
substance use disorders.  The EU is training local government representatives in prevention 
techniques.  With U.S. and UNODC support, Uzbekistan is implementing a long-term continuing 
education project to professionalize all substance use treatment staff in the country.  In 2018, 
UNODC conducted a series of trainings for 136 doctors on treatment and care for intravenous 
drug users.  In 2017, 2,202 patients – including 1,485 in-patients – received treatment.  Over 95 
percent of such patients were male.  Drug treatment institutions also support phone “hotline” 
consultations, but these efforts likely reach only a small proportion of those suffering from 
substance use disorders.  Furthermore, as Uzbekistan prohibits opioid substitution therapy, 
treatment options are limited.

INCSR 2019 Volume 1  
 
 
 
 
Country Reports

Uzbekistan is implementing a National Anti-Corruption Action Plan and does not encourage or 
facilitate illegal activity associated with drug trafficking.  However, there is evidence of 
corruption at multiple levels of government, which confounds national drug control efforts.  
Some government officials have reportedly been convicted on corruption charges.  Although 
most cases target low to mid-level officers, there are occasional high-profile cases, such as 
Uzbekistan’s former prosecutor general, who is under investigation for alleged extortion, bribery, 
and abuse of office.   
 
C. National Goals, Bilateral Cooperation, and U.S. Policy Initiatives 
 
Uzbekistan’s drug control strategy seeks to increase the institutional capacity of the country’s 
law enforcement and criminal justice institutions through training.  In 2018, the U.S. government 
provided training and equipment to assist the Uzbek government to modernize its border 
crossing checkpoints, improve forensic capabilities, develop judicial capacity, and enhance the 
effectiveness of law enforcement agencies.  However, the agreements between the DEA and 
Uzbek agencies have not translated into significant operational cooperation.  Since closing its 
office in Uzbekistan in 2017, the DEA maintains liaison relationship from the regional DEA 
office in Almaty, Kazakhstan.  
 
D. Conclusion 
 
Drug control cooperation between the United States and Uzbekistan continued to grow slowly in 
2018.  Uzbekistan made progress in regional cooperation and data sharing with CARICC 
members and the United States.  However, given the lack of independent data on drug use and 
trafficking within the country, it is difficult to estimate the true extent of the problem and 
whether Uzbekistan’s low seizure statistics accurately reflect law enforcement efficacy.  
Sustainable anti-corruption practices, an independent drug use study, and increased exposure to 
international best practices could promote sustainable improvements in Uzbekistan’s ability to 
combat transnational drug trafficking.

Venezuela 
 
A.  Introduction 
 
Venezuela continues to be a major drug-transit country and is one of the preferred trafficking 
routes in the Western Hemisphere for illegal drugs, predominately cocaine.  In 2018, 
Venezuela’s porous border with Colombia, weak judicial system, almost nonexistent 
international drug control cooperation, and permissive and corrupt environment provided ideal 
conditions for drug trafficking operations and associated violence. 
 
There is insufficient data to determine current drug consumption trends in Venezuela.  The 
Venezuelan National Anti-Narcotics Office (ONA) has not published any statistics since 2015.  
In 2018, under the government of former President Nicolás Maduro, the country’s porous 
borders offered a permissive environment to known terrorist groups involved in drug trafficking, 
including the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia (FARC) and the National Liberation 
Army (ELN).  The Maduro government took no action against individuals and companies 
designated as Specially Designated Narcotics Traffickers by the U.S. Department of Treasury for 
playing a significant role in international drug trafficking.  
  
B.  Drug Control Accomplishments, Policies, and Trends 
  
 
1.  Institutional Development 
 
In 2013, the Venezuelan National Anti-Narcotics Office (ONA) developed a National Anti-Drug 
Plan for 2015-2019 that sought to reduce drug consumption and increase prevention activities.  
ONA reported working closely with civil society to provide anti-drug education training and 
athletic programming in different areas around the country to increase awareness and prevent 
consumption. 
 
In May 2014, Venezuela signed an international agreement with Russia to cooperate in the fight 
against drugs.  Venezuela announced joint operations between the Russian Federal Drug Control 
Service and ONA.  The 2010 Organic Law on Drugs increased the penalties for drug trafficking 
and gave ONA the authority to seize the assets of individuals connected with drug trafficking. 
 
Conflicting statistics make it difficult to assess 2018 seizures.  On February 4, ONA reported that 
since 2005 it had seized 658 metric tons (MT) of drugs, destroyed 284 laboratories, seized 37 
planes, and closed 481 illegal landing strips.  Additionally, on September 28, ONA President 
Juan Grillo told the media that ONA had seized more than 22 MT of drugs in 2018, and added 
that the government seized 35 percent more marijuana compared to 2017.  However, during an 
October 25 press conference, OFAC-sanctioned Attorney General Tarek William Saab shared 
that since August 2017, the government had seized almost 20 MT of drugs (7.2 MT of cocaine, 
12 MT of marijuana and other illicit substances).  Saab also claimed that Venezuela had seized 
23 planes, closed 14 illegal landing strips, and arrested 49 people linked to drug trafficking.

Venezuela remains a major transit country for cocaine shipments via aerial, terrestrial, and 
maritime routes.  Most flights suspected of trafficking drugs depart from Venezuelan states 
bordering Colombia, mainly from Zulia state. Trafficking by maritime conveyance includes the 
use of large cargo containers, fishing vessels, and “go-fast” boats. 
 
The vast majority of illicit drugs that transited Venezuela in 2018 were destined for the 
Caribbean, Central America, the United States, West Africa, and Europe.  Colombian drug-
trafficking organizations – including the FARC, ELN, and other criminal groups – facilitate the 
shipment of illicit drugs through Venezuela.  
 
The Venezuelan government occasionally reports drug seizures, arrests, and destruction of drugs 
and airstrips to the public.  Venezuela is not a member of the Cooperative Situational 
Information Integration System through which countries predetermine information to share 
automatically with the United States.  Venezuelan authorities similarly do not share evidence 
about destruction of illicit drugs with U.S. officials. 
 
 
3.  Public Information, Prevention, and Treatment 
 
The consumption of illicit drugs within Venezuela, especially cannabis and cocaine, remained a 
problem in 2018, but recent statistical data is unavailable.  ONA implemented a National 
Treatment System in 2013 as part of a nationwide program to treat substance use disorder.  The 
system uses professional care for detoxification and social reinsertion of those suffering from 
substance use disorders through a three-level program that includes the Center of Family 
Guidance, the Specialized Center for Prevention and Comprehensive Assistance, and the 
Socialist Therapeutic Community.   
 
 
4.  Corruption 
 
Although the Venezuelan government under former President Maduro did not officially 
encourage or facilitate illicit drug production or distribution as a matter of stated policy, public 
corruption was a major problem that made it easier for drug-trafficking organizations to move 
and smuggle illicit drugs.   
 
Two nephews of former Venezuelan first lady Cilia Flores, Efrain Campo Flores and Francisco 
Flores de Freitas, were arrested in Port-au-Prince, Haiti, in November 2015 and expelled to the 
United States.  In December 2017, a U.S. federal court sentenced both nephews to 18 years in 
prison following their convictions on drug trafficking charges. 
 
The Treasury Department has imposed sanctions on at least 22 individuals and 27 companies by 
designating them as Specially Designated Narcotics Traffickers pursuant to the Foreign 
Narcotics Kingpin Designation Act.  These designations include current or former Venezuelan 
officials: in 2008, General Hugo Carvajal, General Henry Rangel Silva, and Ramón Rodríguez 
Chacín; in 2011, Freddy Bernal Rosales and Amilicar Jesús Figueroa, Major General Cliver 
Alcalá Cordones, and Ramón Isidro Madriz; in 2017, then Vice President Tareck El Aissami and 
front man Samarak López, and; in 2018, Pedro Luís Martín and two of his associates.  The 
Maduro government failed to take action against these or other government and military officials

Country Reports 
271 
 
with known links to the FARC or the Mexican cartels in 2018.  The government called the 
sanctions designation a “foreign plot to destabilize our government.” 
  
C.  National Goals, Bilateral Cooperation, and U.S. Policy Initiatives 
 
Drug control cooperation between Venezuela and the United States has been limited and 
inconsistent since 2005, when Venezuela refused to sign a negotiated addendum to the 
Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) to improve anti-drug cooperation.  The United States 
and Venezuela continue to exercise a 1991 maritime bilateral agreement allowing each country 
to board vessels of the opposite flag suspected of illicit drug trafficking in international waters. 
 
D.  Conclusion 
 
In 2018, the Venezuelan government failed to make demonstrable efforts to combat illegal drug 
activity and prosecute corrupt officials or suspected drug traffickers, including those sanctioned 
by the United States government.  The Maduro administration demonstrated a complete lack of 
will to make much-needed policy changes to enforce existing laws.  This created an extreme 
level of impunity exacerbated by lack of transparency and high levels of corruption.

Vietnam 
 
A.  Introduction 
 
Vietnam is not a significant source or transit country for illegal drugs entering the United States, 
but remains a significant transshipment point for international criminal organizations that traffic 
heroin, amphetamine-type stimulants (ATS), and cocaine to markets throughout East Asia and 
the Pacific.  Historically, the cultivation and production of illegal drugs within Vietnam has been 
uncommon, and the Vietnamese police did not conduct any investigations in 2018 targeting ATS 
production in the country. 
 
The Government of Vietnam reports that approximately 90 percent of the illicit drugs seized in 
the country originate in Laos, Cambodia, Burma, Thailand, and China and are smuggled into the 
country via overland routes.  Lesser volumes of illegal drugs are smuggled through Vietnam via 
sea and air routes by use of human couriers, sea freight, and commercial cargo services.  
Vietnam’s drug interdiction capacities are limited by poor equipment and training, as well as the 
rugged and remote terrain that defines much of the country’s borders. 
 
Heroin remains the most commonly trafficked and abused illegal drug in the country, with 
persons addicted to heroin accounting for approximately 85 percent of the country’s registered 
users.  ATS is commonly available in both pill form and as crystal methamphetamine and is the 
second most commonly trafficked and used drug.  From 2017 to 2018, the cost of crystal 
methamphetamine in Vietnam continued to decline, signifying increasing availability.  Cocaine 
trafficking is also increasing in Vietnam, and 2018 saw the largest cocaine seizure on record in 
Vietnam. 
 
B.  Drug Control Accomplishments, Policies, and Trends 
 
1. Institutional Development   
 
In 2017, Vietnam’s government allocated $95 million through 2020 to support drug control and 
drug prevention, and the country continued to implement its 2011 comprehensive anti-drug 
strategy.  Vietnam works with neighboring countries to carry out interdiction operations, with 
border liaison offices situated along the country’s borders with Laos and Cambodia.  The United 
States promotes counterdrug information sharing, coordination of operations, and capacity 
building with Vietnam’s Ministry of Public Security. 
 
Despite this, several factors still significantly inhibit Vietnam’s ability to investigate and 
prosecute drug trafficking organizations effectively.  Vietnam’s counterdrug police receive little 
to no formal training, and lack the resources necessary to conduct complex investigations.  
Furthermore, Vietnam’s penal code lacks a conspiracy statute and prohibits the introduction of 
many types of evidence normally used to prosecute complex organized crime cases. 
 
Vietnam does not have a mutual legal assistance or an extradition treaty with the United States.  
The decision to engage bilaterally with the United States on international drug trafficking 
investigations is made on a case-by-case basis in accordance with a memorandum of

understanding between the U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) and Vietnam’s 
Ministry of Public Security.  
 
 
2.  Supply Reduction   
 
According to the Government of Vietnam, in 2017, Vietnamese police investigated 
approximately 22,346 drug related cases and arrested 34,494 people involved in drug related 
crimes.  According to official Government of Vietnam statistics, during the first six months of 
2018, Vietnamese police investigated approximately 12,863 drug related cases and arrested 
18,472 people involved in drug related crimes, representing an approximate 9 percent increase in 
investigations and a 5 percent increase in arrests over the same period in 2017.  During this same 
six-month period, Vietnamese police seized 880 kilograms (kg) of heroin, twice the amount of 
heroin seized during 2017; 81 kg of opium; 1,090 kg of cannabis; 414 kg of ATS and other 
synthetic drugs; 485,000 ATS tablets; 100 kg of cocaine; and 2.5 metric tons of khat. 
 
Synthetic drug production is rare in Vietnam, as there is a ready supply of synthetic drugs 
entering Vietnam from neighboring countries.  In April 2017, the Vietnamese police dismantled 
a nation-wide drug trafficking organization that operated 13 clandestine ATS laboratories 
throughout southern Vietnam, but they did not identify any other clandestine ATS laboratories 
for the remainder of 2017 or the first half of 2018. 
 
 
3.  Public Information, Prevention, and Treatment   
 
The Government of Vietnam promotes and funds drug abuse and awareness programs as part of 
its comprehensive anti-drug strategy.  However, the willingness of Vietnamese citizens to seek 
drug abuse treatment is limited by the fear of involuntary incarceration in “drug rehabilitation 
centers,” which, in reality, are no different from prisons and provide minimal actual treatment for 
addiction. 
 
In 2017, the United States budgeted $1.4 million to provide technical support for medication 
assisted therapy and other programming to address the substance abuse issues that drive HIV 
transmission, including intravenous drug abuse. The Government of Vietnam reports that the 
total number of registered heroin and ATS users is 224,690 people, which represents a less than 
one percent increase from the previous year.  The Government of Vietnam also estimates that 
approximately 25 percent of new HIV infections in 2017 resulted from intravenous drug abuse. 
 
 
4.  Corruption  
 
Corruption is endemic in Vietnam and plagues almost every sector of the government.  However, 
Vietnam’s Ministry of Public Security and other agencies involved in drug control operations 
continue to pursue an aggressive drug control agenda, as is evidenced by the year-to-year 
increases in drug-related investigations, arrests, and seizures. 
  
C.  National Goals, Bilateral Cooperation, and U.S. Policy Initiatives

Vietnamese police continued to expand their cooperation with foreign governments in 2018 to 
combat regional drug trafficking, particularly with China, Laos, and Cambodia.  The Vietnamese 
police also collaborate closely with Australian and U.S. law enforcement authorities to target 
international drug trafficking organizations.  In 2016, Vietnam’s Ministry of Public Security 
renewed its memorandum of understanding with DEA.  As a result, in 2017 and 2018, 
information-sharing expanded dramatically between DEA and Vietnam’s law enforcement 
authorities, and the number of joint U.S.-Vietnamese investigations increased significantly. 
 
In 2017, the United States began a comprehensive, four-year assistance program intended to 
strengthen the capacity of Vietnam’s counternarcotics police.  The program is designed to create 
a cadre of 100 subject matter experts on drug trafficking investigations within the Vietnamese 
police force.  This program continued through 2018, and remains on track for completion in 
2020. 
 
D.  Conclusion 
 
Vietnam continues to struggle with controlling drug trafficking and abuse, but maintains an 
aggressive posture against drug trafficking organizations.  Senior law enforcement officers 
continue to maintain support for increased engagement with the United States on both 
investigations and capacity building.  Barring any significant policy shifts, Vietnam’s law 
enforcement capacity is poised to continue to grow and professionalize with international 
support.  The United States encourages the Government of Vietnam to consider taking additional 
steps to modernize and expand its capacity to provide treatment and rehabilitation programs for 
those suffering from substance use disorders.
