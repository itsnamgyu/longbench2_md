Interest Rate Cuts vs. Stimulus Payments:
An Equivalence Result
Abstract: I derive a general condition on consumer behavior ensuring that,
in a simple textbook model of demand-determined output, any path of aggregate
inflation and output that is implementable via interest rate policy is also imple-
mentable through time-varying uniform lump-sum transfers (“stimulus checks”)
alone. The condition is satisfied in popular models of non-Ricardian consumer
behavior (e.g., HANK, OLG). Across these models, the transfer-only policy that
closes a given demand shortfall is well-characterized by a small number of mea-
surable sufficient statistics. My results extend to environments with investment if
transfers are supplemented by a second standard fiscal tool—bonus depreciation.

Introduction
The prescription of standard New Keynesian theory is to conduct stabilization policy through
changes in short-term interest rates. In recent years, much policy and academic interest
has centered on the question of whether—and if so, how—alternative policy tools could be
used to replicate monetary stimulus when nominal interest rates are constrained by a zero or
effective lower bound (ELB).1 Prior work has in particular identified tax policy, often labeled
unconventional fiscal policy, as an attractive option (Correia et al., 2008, 2013): time-varying
tax rates manipulate intertemporal prices just like monetary policy and thus can replicate
any desired monetary allocation.
In this paper I ask whether conventional fiscal policy—that is, fiscal instruments that are
already part of the standard stabilization policy toolkit—are similarly sufficient to replicate
any given monetary policy. The setting for much of my analysis is a textbook business-cycle
model with nominal rigidities and without capital, extended to allow for more general, non-
Ricardian household consumption behavior. The conventional fiscal stabilization tool that I
consider are uniform, deficit-financed transfers (“stimulus checks”), a policy instrument used
in all recent U.S. recessions. My first contribution is to identify a general sufficient condition
under which any time paths of aggregate output and inflation that are implementable via
interest rate policy are also implementable solely by adjusting the time path of such uniform
lump-sum taxes and transfers. It follows in particular that, under my condition, standard
output and inflation targeting rules remain uniquely implementable even with a binding
ELB. Next I argue that this theoretical result is also practically relevant: I show that my
sufficient condition holds in popular models of non-Ricardian consumption behavior, includ-
ing heterogeneous-agent (HANK) and overlapping-generations (OLG) models. Furthermore,
for all of these models, the required stimulus check policy that closes any given demand
shortfall is well-characterized by a very small number of empirically measurable “sufficient
statistics.” At conventional values for these sufficient statistics, stimulus check policies of the
magnitudes already observed in practice suffice to stabilize the economy in the face even of
relatively sizable shortfalls in private spending. Finally, I show that all of these conclusions
extend to richer models with investment as long as stimulus checks are supplemented by a
second, similarly conventional fiscal tool: bonus depreciation stimulus.

Environment & equivalence result.
My model economy features a policymaker with
access to two instruments: nominal interest rates and uniform, lump-sum taxes and transfers.
My objective is to characterize the space of allocations implementable through manipulation
of these two instruments. All results apply to (linearized) perfect foresight transition paths,
or equivalently to the model’s first-order perturbation solution with aggregate risk. Key for
me are properties of the two matrices Cib and Cτ, whose (t, s)th entries are, respectively, the
derivatives of partial equilibrium consumption demand at time t with respect to a) a change
in the time-s rate of interest on bonds and b) a uniform lump-sum transfer paid out at time
s. Note that Cτ is a matrix of intertemporal marginal propensities to consume (iMPCs), as
studied first in Auclert et al. (2018).
In this environment I establish that, if Cτ is invertible—a condition that I will refer to
as strong Ricardian non-equivalence—, then any sequence of aggregate output and inflation
that can be attained via interest rate policy is also implementable by only adjusting the time
profile of uniform lump-sum transfers. The proof begins with the household consumption-
savings problem. A feasible monetary policy is a path of nominal interest rates together with
a path of lump-sum taxes or transfers that ensures a balanced government budget. Through
the household problem, this policy induces some path of net excess consumption demand.
Can a transfer-only policy—that is, a policy that only changes the time profile of taxes and
transfers, again subject to budget balance—engineer the same path of net excess demand?
For Ricardian households, the answer is no: for them, only the net present value of transfers
matters, so any budget-feasible transfer policy leaves spending unchanged. Mathematically,
this is reflected in Cτ being rank-1. If instead the timing of transfers matters (in the strong
sense that Cτ is invertible), then there does exist some path of transfers and taxes alone that
perturbs consumption demand in exactly the same way as the baseline monetary policy. Since
this monetary policy was by assumption budget-balanced, the equivalent transfer policy is
feasible as well. The argument is then completed by showing that, in my environment, two
policies that generate the same partial equilibrium net excess consumption demand paths
must be accommodated in general equilibrium through the same market-clearing adjustments
in prices (inflation, wages, . . . ) and quantities (output, hours worked, . . . ). Though revenue-
equivalent in net present value terms, the two policies do invariably induce different short-run
government debt dynamics: while interest rate policy can in principle have aggregate effects
even if outstanding debt is fixed, uniform stimulus checks work only because they change
the time path of government bonds held by the private sector.
Under the conditions of my equivalence result, transfer payments can serve as a perfect
3


substitute for interest rate policy in the eyes of a conventional “dual mandate” policymaker.
Formally, my results imply that systematic policy rules like the well-known (flexible) inflation
forecast target criteria (Woodford, 2011) continue to be implementable even if nominal rates
are constrained by a binding lower bound. In particular, this conclusion holds completely
independently of the menu of non-policy disturbances hitting the economy.
Practical relevance & policy characterization.
I next discuss the practical rel-
evance of the theoretical equivalence result. I first ask what assumptions on economic prim-
itives are required to ensure the high-level condition of “strong Ricardian non-equivalence”.
My main finding here is that this condition holds generically in standard analytical models
of non-Ricardian consumer behavior, notably including perpetual-youth overlapping gener-
ation models (Blanchard, 1985), spender-saver models (Campbell & Mankiw, 1989; Bilbiie,
2008), and models with bonds in the consumer utility function (Michaillat & Saez, 2018).
I also numerically verify the condition in several HANK models. Intuitively, in all of these
settings, time-varying paths of taxes and transfers will re-shuffle demand over time, e.g., by
moving households away to or towards borrowing constraints (HANK), or by redistributing
across cohorts (OLG). This however still leaves a second question: even if Cτ is technically
invertible, the inverse C−1
τ
may be ill-behaved, and so stabilization through stimulus checks
may require excessively large and erratic fluctuations in transfers and government debt.
My next finding is that—across all of these models of non-Ricardian consumer behavior—
the transfer policy that is needed to close any given shortfall in aggregate demand is very
well-characterized by a small number of measurable sufficient statistics. Mathematically, to
characterize this transfer policy, I require the full inverse matrix C−1
τ —a potentially high-
dimensional and complicated object. My main result is that this large matrix can be obtained
very accurately from just three measurable numbers: the economy’s average MPC ω; the
slope θ of how consumers spend a lump-sum income gain over time; and the rate of interest
¯
r. If ω is close to ¯
r (as in standard permanent-income models of consumption), then C−1
τ
is ill-behaved, and so the required transfer payments and movements in government debt
diverge. For empirically relevant levels of the statistics {ω, θ, ¯
r}, in contrast, even moderate
increases in transfers suffice for aggregate cyclical stabilization. I provide an illustration in
a calibrated quantitative HANK model. Here, to close a transitory demand shortfall of one
per cent, the policymaker could equivalently (i) cut rates by a cumulative 150 basis points or
(ii) increase transfers by around $600 per household, similar in scope to the stimulus check
policy enacted as part of the 2008 Economic Stimulus Act.
4


Extensions & limitations.
As the final step in my argument, I extend the model en-
vironment to also feature capital. Conventional monetary policy now operates through two
levers: by directly affecting (i) the household consumption-savings decision and (ii) the firm
investment decision. Transfer policy is still enough to replicate arbitrary stimulus to con-
sumer demand. For firm investment, it is straightforward to show that a second, similarly
conventional fiscal instrument will suffice: bonus depreciation stimulus. I thus conclude that,
even in this extended environment, two entirely conventional fiscal tools suffice to replicate
any desired monetary stimulus.
While most of my analysis is concerned with aggregates, I also briefly discuss important
limitations to my equivalence result in the presence of microeconomic heterogeneity. First,
I emphasize that—for my equivalence result to apply to HANK-type models—I require par-
ticular (though standard) assumptions on wage-setting. These assumptions are consistent
with arbitrary levels of wealth effects in labor supply, but not with cross-sectional dispersion
in those wealth effects. I review the empirical evidence on such dispersion and conclude that
the scope for this channel to materially affect the equivalence result is limited. Second, my
macro-equivalent interest rate and lump-sum transfer policies are generally not equivalent
household-by-household: nominal interest rate cuts mostly act by directly stimulating con-
sumption at the top of the liquid wealth distribution, whereas the macro-equivalent transfer
stimulus almost exclusively acts at the bottom. Thus, compared to a given interest rate
policy, the macro-equivalent transfer delivers the same macroeconomic stimulus at smaller
cross-sectional consumption dispersion. The normative implications of this positive obser-
vation are studied in McKay & Wolf (2022a).
Related literature.
The paper relates and contributes to several strands of literature.
First, the analysis is motivated by the recent experience of limits to conventional mone-
tary policy space, caused in particular by: a binding ELB on nominal rates due to arbitrage
between bonds and money; adverse effects of further rate cuts on bank profitability (Brunner-
meier & Koby, 2018); rates on most outstanding mortgages being close to the ELB (Berger
et al., 2018); and durables spending adjustments already having been pulled forward in time
(McKay & Wieland, 2019). Prior work has argued that unconventional fiscal instruments can
be used to substitute for monetary stimulus if needed (Correia et al., 2008, 2013); I instead
clarify the conditions under which conventional fiscal stimulus tools can do the same.2
2Another related policy tool that has received both academic as well as substantial policy interest are
helicopter drops of money—that is, money-financed transfer payments (e.g., see Bernanke, 2002; Gal´
ı, 2020;
5


Second, I relate to an important prior literature on the stimulative effects of transfer
payments in the absence of Ricardian equivalence. Blanchard (1985), Woodford (1990) and
Bilbiie et al. (2013) all emphasize that, if private planning horizons are finite (due to death) or
borrowing constraints bind, then public debt can in principle stimulate spending through its
role as private liquidity. Bilbiie et al. (2021) furthermore show that redistribution from savers
to spenders in a two-type model can perfectly mimic monetary demand stimulus. Relative
to this line of work, my contribution is to: (i) identify a general condition—applicable across
all of these environments as well as more general ones—under which uniform, time-varying
taxes and transfers are stimulative in the precise sense that they can perfectly replicate
monetary policy; and (ii) show that the required paths of taxes and transfers can in fact be
characterized as a function of a small number of empirically measurable sufficient statistics.
For measurement of these sufficient statistics I am fortunate to rely on important recent
empirical contributions (notably Parker et al., 2013; Fagereng et al., 2018).
Third, my proof of policy equivalence relies heavily on equilibrium characterizations in
sequence space (Boppart et al., 2018; Auclert et al., 2019). So far, the sequence-space set-
up has been used to analytically characterize general equilibrium effects (Auclert & Rognlie,
2018; Auclert et al., 2018) or to construct general equilibrium counterfactuals for unobserved
shocks (Wolf, 2020). I instead use the same observations to sidestep constraints on policy
space. Echoing classical general equilibrium theory (Arrow & Debreu, 1954), the sequence-
space perspective reveals that two policies are equivalent if they induce the same net excess
demand paths. As such, my equivalence results are conceptually distinct from Correia et al.
(2013) and Farhi et al. (2014)—there, equivalence comes from identical wedges in optimality
conditions. The advantage of my approach is that it can be applied readily to conventional
fiscal instruments (like stimulus checks); the obvious challenge is that characterization of the
equivalent policy requires additional arguments (my analysis of C−1
τ ).
Outlook.
The rest of the paper proceeds as follows. Section 2 sets up the baseline model,
and Section 3 presents the main theoretical result on the set of implementable allocations.
Section 4 then establishes that my equivalent transfer-only stabilization policies can robustly
be characterized as a function of a small number of measurable sufficient statistics. I discuss
the role of micro heterogeneity in Section 5, and finally extend my results to a model with
investment in Section 6. Section 7 concludes.
Reis & Tenreyro, 2022). My results reveal that, under natural assumptions on consumer spending behavior,
even deficit-financed, uniform transfer payments are sufficient to replicate monetary stimulus.

Environment
I begin with a description of the environment in Section 2.1. My assumptions on consumption
behavior will be purposefully general, requiring only the existence of an aggregate consump-
tion function. Section 2.2 discusses particular models that fit into this general environment.
2.1
Model outline
Time is discrete and runs forever, t = 0, 1, . . .. The model economy is populated by house-
holds, unions, firms, and a government, and is initially at its deterministic steady state. I
study linearized perfect foresight transition paths.3 The overall set-up is kept deliberately
close to the textbook New Keynesian business-cycle framework (Woodford, 2011; Gal´
ı, 2015).
At time t = 0, the policymaker announces paths for her policy instruments. My objective
is to characterize the set of allocations that she can implement. The realization of a variable
x at time t along the equilibrium perfect foresight transition path will be denoted xt, while
the entire time path will be denoted x
x
x = {xt}∞
t=0. Hats denote (log-)deviations from the
deterministic steady state and bars denote steady-state values.
The aggregate consumption function.
Households consume and supply labor, with
total consumption and hours worked denoted by ct and ℓt, respectively. Due to frictions in
the labor market, hours worked are taken as given by households and set by optimizing labor
unions, to be discussed in detail later.4 Given paths of income, households decide on their
consumption and savings. Rather than specifying the details of this consumption-savings
problem, I here simply summarize its solution in the form of an aggregate consumption func-
tion. Section 2.2 will consider several particular models of household consumption behavior
that fit into this general framework.
Before stating and discussing the aggregate consumption function I begin with the house-
hold budget constraint. Total income of the household sector consists of: labor earnings
(1 −τℓ)wtℓt, where wt is the real wage and τℓis the (assumed fixed) labor tax rate; uniform
lump-sum transfer receipts τt; and dividends dt. Households can invest in nominally risk-free
3My results can thus equivalently be interpreted as applying to the first-order perturbation solution of
an analogous model with aggregate risk (e.g. Boppart et al., 2018; Auclert et al., 2019).
4I allow for unions in the interest of generality and empirical relevance. For all models except for the
quantitative heterogeneous-household model of Section 4, the alternative standard case of frictionless labor
supply will correspond to the flexible-wage limit of my union model. I further discuss the role of labor supply
in HANK models in Section 5.1.

liquid bonds with nominal returns ib,t. The real return to saving is affected by the inflation
rate πt. The period-t budget constraint of the aggregated household sector is thus
ct + bt = (1 −τℓ)wtℓt + 1 + ib,t−1
1 + πt
bt−1 + τt + dt
(1)
where bt denotes real bond holdings. Given any sequence of household income and asset
returns, optimal household behavior yields time paths of aggregate consumption demand c

with the derivative evaluated at the deterministic steady state. The (t, s)th entry of each of
those infinite-dimensional linear maps is the response of aggregate consumption demand at
time t to a marginal change in input q at time s. The linear map Cτ—which indicates how
aggregate consumption demand will respond to changes in lump-sum transfers—will play
a central role in characterizing the allocations implementable by the policymaker through
stimulus check policy. To build further intuition I will in Section 2.2 provide closed-form
characterizations of this map in various familiar models of household consumption decisions.
Unions & firms.
I summarize the production and wage bargaining block through three
key relations. First, a unit continuum of firms produces the final output good using a labor-
8


only production technology:
yt = y(ℓt)
Price-setting is subject to the usual Rotemberg adjustment costs, giving a textbook New
Keynesian Phillips Curve (NKPC) in prices (Gal´

deviation from price target
+ βπt+1
(5)
where χp(•) gives the deviation from the price target and κp is the slope of the price-NKPC.
Finally, wage bargaining is similarly subject to adjustment costs and so induces a general
wage-NKPC, linking wage inflation to the static labor optimality wedge (Erceg et al., 2000):

(6)
where 1 + πw

wt−1(1 + πt) denotes wage inflation, χw(•) gives the deviation from the wage
target, and κw is the slope of the wage-NKPC. I discuss the derivation of (6) for particular
assumptions on household preferences in Appendices B.2 to B.6.
Policy.
The government flow budget constraint is
1 + ib,t−1
1 + πt
bt−1 + τt = τℓwtℓt + bt
(7)
The policymaker sets nominal interest rates ib,t and uniform lump-sum taxes and transfers
τt subject to the flow budget constraint (7) and the requirement that limt→∞bt = ¯
b.
The remainder of this paper will study the implications of constraints on this policy
toolkit. I will focus on two particular kinds of restrictions: transfer-only policies and interest
rate-only policies.
Definition 1. A transfer-only policy is a policy that sets ib,t = ¯
ib for all t.
In a transfer-only policy, the policymaker is forced to keep nominal interest rates fixed,
perhaps due to a binding effective lower bound. In light of the ELB’s empirical relevance,
most discussion in this paper will center on the extent to which a restriction to transfer-only
policies meaningfully constrains the policymaker. I note that, for such a policy, the direct
mapping from policy instrument to consumer spending is fully governed by the matrix Cτ.
9


Definition 2. An interest rate-only policy is a policy that sets, for all t = 0, 1, . . . ,
τt = τℓwtℓt + (1 −1 + ib,t−1
1 + πt
)¯
b.
(8)
Definition 2 gives the natural opposite to a transfer-only policy: in an interest rate-only
policy, the policymaker is free to adjust the path of nominal rates, but forced to passively ad-
just lump-sum transfers/taxes to balance the budget period-by-period. This policy thus op-
erates by manipulating intertemporal prices, without any time variation in the total amount
of government debt in the hands of households.5 For such a policy, the direct mapping from
policy instrument to consumer spending is governed by the following map:
˜
Cib
≡
Cib
−¯
b × Cτ,•,−1,
(9)
Intuitively, ˜
Cib combines the direct effect of the nominal rate change itself (Cib) together with
the implied movement in taxes required to balance the budget (second term).6
Equilibrium.
I am now in a position to define a perfect foresight transition equilibrium in
this economy. As usual, I throughout restrict attention to equilibria in which all sequences
of policies and macroeconomic aggregates are bounded (Woodford, 2011).
Definition 3. An equilibrium is a set of government policies {ib,t, τt, bt}∞
t=0 and a set of
macroeconomic aggregates {ct, ℓt, yt, wt, πt, dt}∞
t=0 such that:
1. Consumption is consistent with the aggregate consumption function (2).
2. Wage inflation πw
t together with {ℓt, ct, wt}∞
t=0 are consistent with the wage-NKPC (6).
3. The paths {πt, wt, ℓt}∞
t=0 are consistent with the price-NKPC (5), and dividends are given
as dt = yt −wtℓt.
4. The output market clears: yt = ct for all t ≥0, the government budget constraint (7)
holds at all t, and limt→∞b
bt = 0. The bond market then clears by Walras’ law.
An allocation of macroeconomic aggregates {ct, ℓt, yt, wt, πt, dt}∞
t=0 is said to be implementable
if it can be supported as an equilibrium sequence.
5More generally, an interest rate policy is a policy that freely sets nominal rates ib,t and then ensures bud-
get balance in net present value terms (i.e., limt→∞b
bt = 0) through some fixed tax-and-transfer adjustment
rule. (8) is simply a particularly transparent example of such a financing rule.
6Note that, if ¯
b = 0, then—to first order—no financing is required, so ˜
Cib = Cib.
10


Note that Definition 3 specifies policy directly as a path of policy instruments {ib,t, τt, bt}∞
t=0.
As is well-known, policies of this sort generically do not induce unique equilibria (Sargent &
Wallace, 1975). To address this challenge, I will later also discuss equilibria induced by pol-
icy rules for interest rates and transfers. I call an allocation {ct, ℓt, yt, wt, πt, dt}∞
t=0 uniquely
implementable if it is the only equilibrium sequence consistent with those rules.
2.2
Detailed models of household consumption behavior
I will now give examples of several canonical models of household behavior that are consistent
with the general aggregate consumption function (2).
The purpose of this discussion is
twofold: first, to illustrate the generality of the model set-up in Section 2.1; and second, to
already give some intuition for the shape and properties of the key matrix Cτ (which will
feature prominently in Sections 3 and 4).
Analytical models.
All analytical results in the remainder of the paper will rely on the
following four tractable models of the consumption-savings problem.
1. Permanent-income consumers. The classical representative-agent literature on mon-
etary policy transmission assumes standard permanent-income consumers (Gal´
ı, 2015;
Woodford, 2011). Preferences of the household often take the particular form

The consumption-savings problem is then simply to choose sequences {c
c
c,b
b
b} to maximize
(10) subject to the budget constraint (1), and the solution to this problem is the aggregate
consumption function (2).
Studying the solution to this problem (with ¯

denoting the steady-state real rate), it is straightforward to show that

(11)
Following receipt of lump-sum income, permanent-income households consume the annu-
ity value of that receipt in each period, giving the expression for CR
τ . In particular, any
sequence of transfers with zero net present value does not affect household consumption
11


at all. For future reference, it will be useful to note that Cτ in this simple model is a
function of only one object: the steady-state real interest rate ¯
r.
2. Spenders and savers. A simple extension of the canonical permanent-income model
adds a margin µ ∈(0, 1) of spenders—households that hold no wealth and immediately
consume any income. Combining this mechanical spending behavior with the consump-
tion function of savers, we again get an aggregate consumption function (2). It is straight-
forward to see that, in this case, we have
CH
τ
=
(1 −µ) × CR
τ + µ × I
(12)
where I denotes the identity matrix. For future reference, it will be useful to note that
the average marginal propensity to consume (MPC) ω in this economy is given as
ω = (1 −µ) ×
¯
r
1 + ¯
r + µ × 1
Solving for µ and plugging into (12), we see that here we can obtain CH
τ as a function of
only two objects: the steady-state real interest rate ¯
r and the economy’s average MPC ω.
3. Overlapping generations of households. A canonical model of non-Ricardian house-
hold consumption behavior is one with overlapping generations of households (OLG) (e.g.,
see Blanchard, 1985). I consider a simple perpetual-youth departure from the permanent-
income model (10), with households surviving from period to period at rate θ ∈(0, 1],
bonds paying out as fair annuities, and newborns receiving the wealth of dying households.
Detailed model equations (which closely follow Angeletos & Huo (2021)) are presented
in Appendix B.4, fully characterizing the model-implied aggregate consumption function
(2). Importantly, I in Appendix C.1 I furthermore show that Cτ in this model satisfies

where the sense of the approximation ≈is made precise in Appendix C.1, and the MPC ω

has a very simple shape. On the
one hand, because households die over time, spending following lump-sum income receipt
is front-loaded, decaying at rate θ (i.e., entries below the main diagonal of COLG
τ
). On the

other hand, household exit also implies that future income receipt only partially affects
spending today, with the strength of anticipation effects (i.e., above the main diagonal of

) also governed by θ—that is, there is a single “slope” θ governing how household
spending reacts to lump-sum income receipt over time. Overall we see that Cτ is yet again
a simple object. Relative to the spender-saver model, the main difference is that the OLG
set-up not only generates elevated MPCs (ω >

r), but also a gradual time profile of
spending (i.e., the off-diagonal entries of Cτ are not flat, unlike for CH
τ ).
4. Bonds in the household utility function. My fourth and final analytical model is one
with bonds in the household utility function. Models of this sort have recently become
popular as an analytical alternative to full heterogeneous-household models; intuitively,
the reduced-form preference for wealth reflects the precautionary savings motive present
in proper incomplete-markets models (Kaplan & Violante, 2018; Michaillat & Saez, 2018).

where the MPC ω and the slope coefficient θ are now complicated functions of model
primitives. Comparing (15) and (13), we see that the analytical OLG and bond-in-utility
models induce similar mappings from income to consumer spending. In the bond-in-utility
model, upon income receipt, households optimally spend their income gradually, ensuring
wealth returns to target over time; similarly, they gradually increase spending prior to a
future income receipt to smooth out both consumption and wealth. Interestingly, as in
the OLG model, both the gradual spending time profile as well as anticipation effects are
governed by a common parameter (the “slope” θ), so Cτ is yet again low-dimensional.

A quantitative “HANK”-type model.
The set-up of Section 2.1 is similarly consistent
with quantitative heterogeneous-agents models of the consumption-savings problem. In a

where I have additionally allowed dividends dit to be type-specific, and household borrowing
is now subject to an-hoc (tight) borrowing constraint b. I assume that unions demand the
same hours worked from all households, so that ℓit = ℓt for all i ∈[0, 1]; the corresponding
union wage bargaining problem is presented in detail Appendix B.6. I will return to the role
of these assumptions on household labor supply in Section 5.1.
The household consumption-savings decision is now to choose sequences of consumption
and savings, {c

again obtain an aggregate consumption function (2). This consumption function—and in
particular the derivative matrix Cτ—now does not admit any closed-form characterization.
However, these objects can be recovered straightforwardly using the computational methods
developed by Boppart et al. (2018) and Auclert et al. (2019).
Outlook.
The remainder of the paper will proceed in two main steps. First, in Section 3,
I will identify a general sufficient condition on Cτ ensuring that transfer policies can replicate
arbitrary monetary stimulus. This analysis will only require the general set-up of Section 2.1,
and so in particular will apply to all of the specific models reviewed just now. Second, in
Section 4, I will then use those particular models and their Cτ’s to (i) verify my sufficient
condition and (ii) explicitly characterize the macro-equivalent stimulus check policy that
closes any given shortfall in aggregate spending. In this characterization, the three objects
discussed in this section—the MPC ω, the spending “slope” θ, and the steady-state interest
rate ¯
r—will play a key role. As it will turn out, even in rich HANK environments, these
three objects will suffice to characterize my equivalent stimulus check policies.

Interest rate cuts vs. stimulus checks
This section presents my main theoretical result on the set of implementable allocations.
Section 3.1 begins with the general sufficient condition for policy equivalence, and Section 3.2
discusses the implications of this result for macroeconomic policy rules.
3.1
A sufficient condition for aggregate policy equivalence
I begin with a preliminary definition: a property of the consumption derivative map Cτ that
I refer to as strong Ricardian non-equivalence. This property will turn out to be a general
sufficient condition for my core equivalence result.
Definition 4. A consumption function C(•) exhibits strong Ricardian non-equivalence if the
linear map Cτ is invertible. I denote its inverse by C−1
τ .
Under the Barro (1974) definition of Ricardian equivalence, the time path of (lump-sum)
taxes used to finance any given fiscal expenditure is completely irrelevant for consumption—
only the present value matters. We already saw this in the expression for Cτ in the permanent-
income model (see (11)): there Cτ is rank-1, and so in particular it is not invertible. With
non-Ricardian households, on the other hand, the timing of transfers also begins to matter,
increasing the rank of Cτ; strong Ricardian non-equivalence corresponds to the limit case of
invertibility. Section 4.1 will establish that the various analytical models of non-Ricardian
consumption discussed in Section 2.2 indeed generically satisfy this property.
The equivalence result.
I am now in a position to state the policy equivalence result.
Proposition 1. Consider the model of Section 2.1, and let b
c
c
c be a path of household con-
sumption with zero net present value, i.e., P∞

(18)
Then the two policy instruments τ and ib are macro-equivalent: any aggregate allocation
that is implementable with transfer-only policy is also implementable with interest rate-only
policy, and vice-versa.
An easy-to-interpret sufficient condition ensuring the direction “⇐” in the equivalence
condition (18) is the notion of strong Ricardian non-equivalence: if Cτ is invertible, then the
15


space of aggregate allocations implementable using transfer-only policies is at least as large
that implementable using interest rate-only policies.
Proof sketch.
Key to the proof of Proposition 1 is the insight that both interest rate
as well as transfer policies only directly perturb the model’s equilibrium conditions in two
places: first, the left-hand side of the output market-clearing condition C(•) = y
y
y(ℓ
ℓ
ℓ); and
second, the sequence of government budget constraints (7).
In partial equilibrium—i.e., prior to general equilibrium price and quantity adjustments—
a feasible monetary policy is simply a budget-neutral perturbation of relative intertemporal
prices, inducing a path of net excess consumption demand

Note that, since my definition of an interest rate policy includes its financing, this demand

amount of government bonds held by households, thereby affecting the severity of liquidity

ment). Since the initial monetary policy was consistent with fiscal budget balance, and so
since b

ment also works in reverse: any transfer-only policy that is consistent with the government
budget constraint (7) (i.e., limt→∞b
bt = 0) necessarily induces a perturbation of consumption
demand with zero net present value, and so by (18) we can always find an equivalent interest
rate-only policy. To summarize, this first step leverages the fact that both policies equally
flexibly manipulate the same lever: the consumption-savings decision of households.
Given that the transfer and nominal interest rate policies are both budget-feasible and
both perturb the output market-clearing condition by exactly the same amounts time period
16


by time period, it then follows via the implicit function theorem that they must also induce
the same general equilibrium paths of inflation, hours worked, wages, and dividends. The
intuition is simple: if, for example, the excess demand path induced by some monetary pol-
icy is accommodated in general equilibrium through increases in inflation and hours worked,
then the same inflation and hours worked paths are also consistent with agent optimality and
market-clearing after the equivalent transfer policy. This proof strategy is a simple applica-
tion of the Arrow & Debreu (1954) approach to general equilibrium characterization using
state-by-state (here t-by-t) net excess demand functions. Finally, the proof also reveals that
the two policies are revenue-equivalent in general equilibrium: e.g., if increases in economic
activity and inflation lead to an additional budget surplus after a rate cut, then the exact
same budget surplus also opens up after the equivalent transfer stimulus.7
Discussion of assumptions.
The first step of my argument relied on two assumptions:
(i) the existence of an aggregate consumption function C(•), and (ii) the restriction that both
policies operate only by manipulating that function. Many macroeconomic models induce
such consumption functions—e.g., ranging from the models reviewed in Section 2.2 to those
with behavioral biases (like Laibson et al., 2020; Lian, 2021)—, and so strong Ricardian
non-equivalence is a useful, quite widely applicable sufficient condition. By (ii), however,
my conclusions do not immediately extend to models in which monetary policy acts through
multiple levers, e.g., firm investment. I discuss such extensions in Section 6.
The second (general equilibrium) step of my proof requires that two policies with identical
effects on partial equilibrium net excess consumer demand are accommodated in the same
way in general equilibrium. The shape of the wage-NKPC (6) plays an important role in
ensuring that this is indeed the case. While this shape is entirely standard for representative-
agent models and for those in particular nests the limiting special case of flexible labor supply,
it requires additional assumptions in the case of cross-sectional household heterogeneity (as
in HANK models). I will return to this point in Section 5.1.
3.2
Implications for policy practice & policy rules
The equivalence result in Proposition 1 was phrased in terms of perfect foresight transition
paths, or equivalently in terms of impulse responses to policy shocks in a linearized model
7This notion of revenue equivalence is perfectly analogous to the discussion of interest rate policy and
distortionary taxation (i.e., unconventional fiscal policy) in Correia et al. (2013).
17


with aggregate risk. By the results in McKay & Wolf (2022b), such equivalence in terms of
responses to policy shocks also implies equivalence in terms of policy rules: in response to
any set of non-policy shocks (e.g., supply or demand), the aggregate outcomes implied by
any given nominal interest rate rule can equivalently be implemented using a transfer-only
rule. This subsection fleshes out the details on this observation. Throughout I will be relying
on the perfect-foresight notation adopted in this paper; I discuss the interpretation of my
equivalent policy rules from a recursive aggregate-risk perspective in Appendix C.6.
Adding non-policy shocks.
To state my results on the equivalence of policy rules, I
extend the baseline model to feature a rich menu of non-policy shocks: wedges {ε
ε
εc,ε
ε
εp,ε
ε
εw} to
the aggregate consumption function (2) as well as the Phillips curves (5) - (6), corresponding
to simple reduced-form representations of canonical demand and supply shocks. Given such
shock paths, I now ask whether the space of allocations that the policymaker can implement
through commitment to policy rules is affected by constraints on nominal rates ib,t (e.g., a
binding ELB). Under the conditions of Proposition 1, the answer turns out to be “no”.
Policy rule equivalence.
I will present my equivalence results for two particular kinds
of interest rate policy rules: implicit targeting rules and explicit instrument rules (Giannoni
& Woodford, 2002). As I will argue below, implicit targeting rules in particular are a relevant
description of actual stabilization policy practice.
A classical implicit targeting rule specifies a relationship between policy targets. For a
standard dual-mandate policymaker, and written in the perfect-foresight notation adopted
throughout this paper, such a rule takes the general form
Bπb
π
π
π + Byb
y
y
y = 0
0
0
(19)
(19) specifies a relationship between inflation and output along the perfect-foresight transi-
tion path. It nests as special cases strict inflation targeting (b
πt = 0 and so Bπ = I, By = 0
0
0),
strict output targeting (b
yt = 0 and so Bπ = 0
0
0, By = I), as well as the canonical implicit
targeting rule of a dual-mandate policymaker,
b
πt + λ(b
yt −b
yt−1) = 0,
t = 0, 1, 2, . . .
where λ is a function of policymaker preferences and model primitives (e.g., see Woodford,
2011, for a derivation). Strong Ricardian non-equivalence is sufficient to ensure that, if a rule
of the general form (19) can be (uniquely) implemented using an interest rate-only policy
(i.e., with a policy as in Definition 2), then the same is true for a transfer-only policy.
18


Corollary 1. Suppose that the implicit targeting rule (19) implemented through an interest
rate-only policy induces a unique equilibrium. Then, under the conditions of Proposition 1
and strong Ricardian non-equivalence, the rule (19) implemented through a transfer-only
policy also induces a unique equilibrium featuring the same aggregate allocation.
When implementing the targeting rule (19) through interest rate policy, the policymaker
in the background sets nominal interest rates so that aggregate demand is consistent with
output and inflation sequences satisfying (19). By my high-level assumption of strong Ri-
cardian non-equivalence, she can engineer that exact same required time path of aggregate
excess demand through transfers—she simply needs to set transfers equal to
b
τ
τ
τ
=
C−1

× demand target
The proof of Corollary 1 formalizes the argument. I note that those results have an important
implication for policymaking practice: they imply that, even if nominal interest rates are
constrained (e.g., due to a binding effective or zero lower bound), standard (flexible) inflation
targeting rules of the general form (19) can still be implemented—the only difference is that
the policymaker now does so through a different instrument.8
The same logic extends to explicit instrument rules—that is, rules that explicitly specify
the value of the policy instrument as a function of observables. Again written in linearized
perfect-foresight notation, typical rules of this sort take the general form
b
i
i
ib = Bπb
π
π
π + Byb

(20)
(20) here specifies a mapping from inflation and output into nominal interest rates along the
perfect-foresight transition path. For example, a simple Taylor rule would take the form
b
ib,t = ϕπb
πt + ϕyb
yt,
t = 0, 1, 2, . . .
8Bernanke (2015) succinctly summarizes the salience of this implicit targeting perspective for actual
Federal Reserve policymaking:
“The Fed has a rule. The Fed’s rule is that we will go for a 2 percent inflation rate. We will
go for the natural rate of unemployment. We put equal weight on those two things. We will
give you information about our projections about our interest rates. That is a rule and that is
a framework that should clarify exactly what the Fed is doing.”
My main result simply states that, under my assumptions, this rule can equivalently be implemented using
a different policy instrument, giving exactly the same equilibrium outcomes of inflation and output.
19


and so Bπ = ϕπ × I, By = ϕy × I. With interest rates set according to (20), taxes under my
definition of an interest rate-only policy rule adjust in the background to ensure a balanced
government budget (recall Definition 2). In particular, for my environment in Section 2.1,

As before, strong Ricardian non-equivalence is sufficient to ensure that the equilibrium dy-
namics induced by a rule of the form (20)-(21) can equivalently be implemented uniquely
through an explicit transfer-only policy rule.
Corollary 2. Suppose that, given a sequence of shocks {ε

(22) is an explicit instrument rule for taxes and transfers. Just like (20) did for interest
rates, (22) is a rule that gives the time path of taxes and transfers as a function of time
paths of inflation and output (as well as the deficit). Intuitively, the rules (20) and (22) are
equivalent because they both imply the same mapping from macroeconomic aggregates—
output and inflation—into aggregate demand. The only difference is the instrument that is
used to achieve that mapping.9 Appendix C.6 further elaborates on how the perfect-foresight
relationship (22) can be interpreted as a policy rule from a recursive perspective.
Taking stock.
The analysis in this section has established my first main result: under
the sufficient condition of strong Ricardian non-equivalence, constraints on monetary policy
do not affect the space of (aggregate) allocations that are implementable by the policymaker.
Relative to prior work (e.g., Correia et al., 2008, 2013), a key difference is that my conclusion
relies only on a conventional fiscal policy tool: deficit-financed (uniform) stimulus checks.
While appealing, the generality of my sufficient condition for policy equivalence also
invites obvious further questions. First, the condition on Cτ is not phrased in terms of model
9Of course it is important to note that policy rules that are “simple” in interest rate space—e.g., in the
sense that Bπ and By are diagonal, as in simple Taylor rules—need not be simple in transfer space. Intuitively,
nothing guarantees that C−1

primitives. Do standard models of non-Ricardian consumption behavior—like those reviewed
in Section 2.2—actually imply that Cτ is invertible? Second, even if so, the inverse C−1
τ
may
be ill-behaved, and so the policymaker may require implausibly large or erratic sequences of
transfers for stabilization. Section 4 deals with these questions.

Characterizing the equivalent policy
The purpose of this section is to ascertain the practical relevance of my theoretical equivalence
result. By the analysis of Section 3, this requires a characterization of C−1
τ —the potentially
complicated infinite-dimensional object that governs the mapping from any possible shortfall
in consumer spending b

I will establish two main results about C−1
τ . First, for the various models of the consumption-
savings problem reviewed in Section 2.2 (and including in particular the heterogeneous-agent
model), I will show that the required inverse C−1
τ
exists and is either exactly or approximately
pinned down by a small number of measurable “sufficient statistics”: the average MPC ω;
the spending profile “slope” θ; and the steady-state interest rate ¯
r. Second, for empirically
relevant values of these three sufficient statistics, I will find that the inverse is well-behaved—
smooth and moderately sized transfer payments suffice for aggregate stabilization in the face
of typical shortfalls in aggregate spending b
c
c
cPE.
The remainder of the section establishes these conclusions in two steps. In Section 4.1,
I first provide explicit formulas for C−1
τ
in my analytical models. Sections 4.2 and 4.3 then
show that these simple formulas continue to characterize C−1
τ
very well even in state-of-the-art
heterogeneous-agent models of the consumption-savings problem.
4.1
Policy equivalence in analytical models
My sufficient condition of strong Ricardian non-equivalence turns out to be satisfied in all of
the analytical models of non-Ricardian consumption behavior studied in Section 2.2. That is,
10I focus on expected shortfalls in demand since they are arguably the relevant target for policy (see my
discussion after Corollary 1). To instead map a given path of interest rates into the equivalent transfer (as
is needed for explicit rules, see Corollary 2), I would also require ˜
Cib. In the models I consider, the only
additional parameter required to characterize ˜
Cib is the elasticity of intertemporal substitution, so all results
extend straightforwardly (see Appendix C.2).
In richer models ˜
Cib may be more complicated; however,
whatever its shape, invertibility of Cτ suffices to ensure that transfers can function as a perfect substitute.
21


for all of these, households are non-Ricardian in the strong sense that, through manipulation
of the time paths of transfers, it is possible to generate any desired time path of net excess
demand. In this section I first establish this result and furthermore argue that the potentially
complicated inverse C−1
τ
actually takes a simple form. The latter result will pave the way for
my general sufficient statistics formula presented in Section 4.3.
Proposition 2. Consider the analytical models of the household consumption-savings prob-
lem discussed in Section 2.2. In all models of except for the permanent-income consumer,
Cτ is invertible. In particular:11
1. In the spender-saver model, CH
τ
is invertible if there is a non-zero margin of spenders,
i.e., µ > 0.
2. In the overlapping generations model, COLG
τ
is invertible if households die with positive
probability, i.e., θ < 1.
3. In the bond-in-utility model, CBiU
τ
is invertible if households value wealth and the marginal
utility of wealth is diminishing, i.e., α, η > 0.
As already discussed, in the standard permanent-income model, only the present value of
transfers matters, so CR
τ has rank-1 and thus is not invertible. For the spender-saver model,
invertibility is straightforward to establish—in fact it can be seen quite easily from the model-
implied aggregate Euler equation (e.g., as in Bilbiie et al., 2013, 2021): through spenders,
transfers appear as a wedge in the aggregated date-t Euler equation, thus suggesting that
taxes and transfers can manipulate spending over time just like conventional interest rate
policy. The explicit expression for (CH
τ )−1, here for simplicity displayed for the special case
¯
r = 0, translates this classical Euler equation perspective to my matrix set-up:
(CH
τ )−1
=
1
ω × I
(23)
By (23), to engineer a dollar of extra spending at some date t, the policymaker simply needs
to increase transfers at date t by 1
ω dollars.12 Intuitively, the policymaker here leverages the
11The proof of Proposition 2 also establishes invertibility for linear combinations of these models—like the
hybrid OLG and spender-saver model that underlies my sufficient statistics formula in Section 4.3.
12If ¯
r > 0, then savers also increase their spending by an amount equal to the annuity value of the transfer,
and in fact they do so forever. To offset this effect, the off-diagonal elements of (CH
τ )−1 in that case are small
and negative. I present the full expression in Appendix C.1.

again for simplicity that ¯

Recall from Section 2.2 that the main difference between the spender-saver and OLG models
was the time pattern of household spending: in OLG, households gradually spend before and
after any income receipt, with both gradual spending as well as anticipation effects governed
by the single parameter θ. (24) and (23) differ precisely because of these dynamic effects: to
engineer a dollar of demand at some date t, the policymaker needs to give money at date t
(still scaling in ω−1) but now also take away money at t−1 and t+1, to prevent leakage across

periods. Importantly, this tridiagonal shape, also illustrated in the right panel of Figure 1,
follows only because spending decays and builds up over time at a constant rate θ. A second
important feature of (24) is that the expression for (COLG
τ
)−1 is still low-dimensional: the
inverse is governed by the average MPC ω and the slope parameter θ.14
Finally—and unsurprisingly in light of the discussion in Section 2.2—the intuition from
the OLG model extends with very little change to the bond-in-utility model. As I show in
Appendix C.1, (CBiU
τ
)−1 has the exact same tridiagonal shape as that displayed in the right
panel of Figure 1 for the OLG model, with both gradual spending as well as anticipation
effects again governed by a common coefficient θ.
Taking stock.
The analysis in this section constitutes the first step to ascertaining the
practical relevance of my policy equivalence result. I have shown that, in popular analytical
models of non-Ricardian consumption behavior, my sufficient condition for policy equivalence
not only holds, but in fact the all-important inverse C−1
τ
is also low-dimensional and has a
simple, intuitive shape. This result is very promising because we already know from prior
work (e.g., Auclert et al., 2018) that consumption behavior even in rich heterogeneous-agent
environments looks similar to that in the simpler analytical models studied here. Sections 4.2
and 4.3 will leverage this observation and turn it into a simple, empirically measurable
sufficient statistics formula that provides a robust characterization of all of C−1
τ .
4.2
A quantitative HANK model
The quantitative analysis throughout the remainder of this section will rely on the most popu-
lar and empirically relevant model of non-Ricardian consumption behavior: a heterogeneous-
household incomplete-markets model, as popularized in the recent HANK literature (Kaplan
et al., 2018; Kaplan & Violante, 2018). This section presents the parameterization and dis-
cusses the model-implied consumption behavior, while Section 4.3 shows my main result:
C−1
τ
exists, is well-behaved, and is in fact (approximately) low-dimensional.
Parameterization.
I consider a calibrated version of the model of Section 2.1, with the
aggregate consumption function coming from the heterogeneous-household consumption-
savings problem described in Section 2.2. I only present a very brief overview of the (stan-
dard) parameterization here, and relegate further details to Appendix B.6.
14The two coefficients are in fact related as ω = 1 −θ, so (COLG
τ
)−1 in this case turns out to be one-
dimensional. With general ¯
r the expression becomes two-dimensional, as shown in Appendix C.1.

Households face the same income process as in Kaplan et al. (2018), and can self-insure
by saving, but not borrowing. I calibrate total liquid bond holdings to the amount of liquid
wealth in the U.S. economy; corporate wealth, instead, is perfectly illiquid, with households
receiving dividend payments as a function of their labor productivity. The economy is closed
with a simple constant-returns-to-scale production function as well as conventional degrees of
nominal wage and price stickiness. This general equilibrium closure is of course irrelevant for
the main results of this section (which only concern partial equilibrium consumer behavior,
i.e. Cτ); rather, the model closure will only start to matter once I report general equilibrium
experiments (as I do at the end of Section 4.3 as well as in Section 5).
Properties of Cτ.
In an important contribution, Auclert et al. (2018) establish the fol-
lowing two observations concerning the properties of Cτ in quantitative heterogeneous-agent
models. First, they argue that the model-implied first column of Cτ—that is, the response of
consumption demand over time to a lump-sum income gain today—is consistent with empir-
ical evidence on consumer spending behavior (e.g., Parker et al., 2013; Fagereng et al., 2018).
This finding reaffirms my claim that, for the purposes of my analysis, this heterogeneous-
agent model is a quantitatively and empirically relevant one.
Second, they show that a
mixture of spender-saver and bond-in-utility models is similarly rich enough to match the
available evidence on the first column of Cτ; furthermore, when done so, this mixture model
tends to approximately agree with HANK on the entirety of the matrix Cτ.
I combine these two observations with my results in Sections 2.2 and 4.1. The analysis
there had revealed that, in analytically tractable models, a small number of measurable
statistics—the objects {ω, θ, ¯
r}—suffice to characterize C−1
τ .
But since these models are
known to look similar to HANK (at least as far Cτ is concerned), it follows that the very
same statistics may even characterize the potentially complicated, infinite-dimensional object
C−1
τ
in HANK. The analysis in the next section confirms these conjectures.
4.3
A simple sufficient statistics approximation
This section presents my three-coefficient “sufficient statistics” approximation to C−1
τ
and
documents its high accuracy in quantitative heterogeneous-agent models. The key takeaway
will be that, for empirically supported values of my sufficient statistics, the stimulus check
policies required to deal with ordinary cyclical fluctuations are robustly moderate in size and
smooth over time, suggesting that stimulus checks are indeed a practically relevant tool for
aggregate stabilization.
25


Approximating C−1
τ .
Guided by the insights from the analysis in Sections 4.1 and 4.2,
I propose to approximate Cτ and C−1
τ
through a small number of measurable objects: the
average MPC ω, the spending slope θ, and the rate of interest ¯
r. I do so in two steps.
1. Using only the slope θ and and the interest rate ¯
r, I construct an approximation of Cτ in
the shape implied by overlapping-generations or bond-in-utility models (i.e., (13)).15
2. I combine the matrix from the first step with a spender-saver spending matrix (see (12)),
with the weights chosen to hit my desired third statistic—the target impact MPC ω.
This second step is necessary to disentangle ω and θ (which in OLG or spender-saver
models are necessarily tied together as ω = 1−
θ
1+¯
r). The end result is my approximation
Cτ(ω, θ, ¯
r), and from there I simply compute the inverse Cτ(ω, θ, ¯
r)−1.
Further details are provided in Appendix C.3, including in particular explicit formulas
for Cτ(ω, θ, ¯
r)−1. Overall, this two-step approximation yields a matrix Cτ(ω, θ, ¯
r) and inverse
Cτ(ω, θ, ¯
r)−1 that is nothing but a simple combination of the intuitions reviewed in Sec-
tions 2.2 and 4.1: consumer spending decays and anticipation effects build up at constant
rates over time (the slope coefficient θ), with a margin of mechanical spenders added to
disentangle this dynamic rate θ from the level of the average MPC ω.
Accuracy.
As it turns out, this three-dimensional approximation Cτ(ω, θ, ¯
r)−1 provides a
highly accurate description of consumption behavior in HANK models. While the analysis
in this section will only look at the preferred calibration of my heterogeneous-agent model,
I in Appendix C.4 document the robustness of my conclusions by also looking at several
alternative, materially different HANK model parameterizations.
Figure 2 begins by displaying several individual columns of C−1
τ
taken from (i) the full
heterogeneous-agent model (shades of grey) and (ii) the sufficient statistics approximation
(orange dashed), with the three sufficient statistics {ω, θ, ¯
r} set to values that agree with the
heterogeneous-agent model: ω = 0.30, θ = 0.82, and ¯
r = 0.01—all values that are consistent
with empirical evidence (e.g., Fagereng et al., 2018).16 My first observation is that the orange
15Note that I can do so using θ and ¯
r alone precisely because the impact MPC is then—by the household
budget constraint—necessarily given as 1 −
θ
1+¯
r. I also note here that my sufficient statistics approximation
actually does not exactly impose the shape displayed in (13), but rather I consider a slight modification that
ensures that aggregate budget constraints are always satisfied. I thank an anonymous referee of alerting me
of this important point. See Appendix C.3 for details.
16To be precise, I set ¯
r to its value in the heterogeneous-agent model, ω = Cτ(1, 1), and finally θ is set to
ensure that Cτ(ω, θ, ¯
r)(2, 1) = Cτ(2, 1).
26

the sufficient statistics approximation Cτ(ω, θ, ¯

r is set as in
the heterogeneous-agent model (to 1 per cent), and {ω, θ} are set to match Cτ(1, 1) and Cτ(2, 1).
The lines correspond to columns {1, 6, 11, 16}, with lighter shades indicating farther-out columns.
dashed lines indeed simply combine the intuitions from the spender-saver and overlapping-
generations (or bond-in-utility) models presented in the two panels of Figure 1: to engineer a
dollar of excess demand at date t, the policymaker would need to pay out transfers somewhat
in excess of ω−1 at date t (at around $6 here), and then take money away in adjacent
periods to prevent the cross-period leakage in spending. The second observation is that this
very simple logic also describes the full heterogeneous-agent model, with the orange lines
qualitatively and quantitatively close to the grey lines throughout.
Why does the three-coefficient formula so accurately capture consumption behavior even
in the rich heterogeneous-household model?
Intuitively, in that model, some households
are up against the borrowing constraint (so they act like spenders), while others will be up
against it in the future with some probability, so they engage in precautionary savings (which
in reduced-form looks like a direct preference over wealth holdings, see Kaplan & Violante,
2018). By my results in Section 4.1, three simple (and measurable!) parameters are already
enough to capture these spending dynamics with a high degree of accuracy.
Next, Figure 3 shows several different “typical” target paths of net excess demand that
a policymaker may wish to implement (grey) together with the sequences of transfers and

is either taken from the actual heterogeneous-agent model (black) or from my

spending that I consider all have a peak of one per cent of steady-state consumption, but
they are quite distinct in shape: short-lived in the left panel, persistent in the middle panel,
and hump-shaped in the right panel, thus capturing a range of policy-relevant scenarios.
As expected in light of Figure 2, I find that, for all three time paths, the actual required
transfer sequence and the sufficient statistics prediction are extremely close. I will return to
the magnitudes of the required stimulus check policies in the next paragraph.
Appendix C.4 repeats the exercises of Figures 2 and 3 for two alternative calibrations
of my heterogeneous-agent model: one with much lower household wealth and thus higher
MPCs, and the other one with high wealth and so low MPCs. The matrix C−1

sufficient statistics approximation remains extremely accurate for all of them.17
17In Appendix C.7 I furthermore consider model extensions with behavioral households (e.g., cognitive
discounting), consistent with recent evidence on the strength of anticipation effects (Ganong & Noel, 2019).
I show that in this case a simple four-parameter extension of my formula provides an accurate description

and transfer (black) policies in the calibrated HANK model, chosen to generate the net excess
demand path displayed in the middle panel (grey). For transfers and debt I show the differences
between their paths under the two policies as the black line.
Practical policy implications.
So far I have emphasized that my sufficient statistics
formula yields an approximation Cτ(ω, θ, ¯
r)−1 that accurately reflects consumer behavior in
rich HANK models, no matter the parameterization. A second important point is that, for
empirically relevant values of {ω, θ, ¯
r}, the entries of this inverse are moderate in size. We
can see this in Figure 2, with the diagonal entries of Cτ(ω, θ, ¯
r)−1 somewhat larger than ω−1,
and the off-diagonal entries relatively small and quickly converging to zero away from the
main diagonal. Given that empirical evidence suggests elevated average MPCs ω, it follows
that even moderately sized transfer stimulus suffices to close meaningful aggregate spending
shortfalls. We also see this in Figure 3, which reveals that stimulus checks of the magnitudes
observed in practice (e.g., around $600, as in 2008), are predicted to close aggregate demand
shortfalls of around one per cent.18
Figure 4 provides a final illustration by studying stabilization policy in response to a
contractionary demand shock ε
ε
εc—that is, a shock that temporarily depresses partial equi-
librium consumer spending, here with a peak effect of -1 per cent. By the classical divine
coincidence logic, it is possible to perfectly stabilize inflation and output in the face of such
a contractionary shock. To do so, policy needs to increase consumer spending to offset the
1 per cent contraction in demand (= $150 per household), shown in the middle (grey). The
of consumer behavior, with the fourth parameter governing the strength of behavioral frictions.
18Appendix C.3 elaborates further: I provide explicit expressions for the entries of Cτ(ω, θ, ¯
r)−1 and
furthermore repeat the exercises in Figure 3 for a range of credible values of my sufficient statistics.
29


usual policy prescription would be to do so through a cut in interest rates (left panel, green);
in my heterogeneous-agent model, this requires a relatively short-lived nominal interest rate
cut with a cumulative total of around 150 basis points.19 The black lines indicate how to
achieve the exact same perfect stabilization instead using lump-sum tax-and-transfer policy
alone: transfers initially go up (here by around $600), before then being financed through
higher taxes down the line. Unsurprisingly in light of Figures 2 and 3, this time path is again
predicted almost perfectly by my sufficient statistics formula (orange, dashed). Finally, the
right panel shows that the moderate stimulus check policy brings with it a moderate and
transitory increase in government debt. Cyclical stabilization through stimulus check pol-
icy thus requires no implausibly large or erratic fluctuations in taxes, deficits, or aggregate
government debt. In particular, stimulus check policies of the magnitude seen in the 2008
Economic Stimulus Act already suffice to deliver meaningful stimulus and replicate sizable
interest rate cuts, thus allowing classical aggregate demand management even when mone-
tary policy is constrained by a lower bound.
5
The role of microeconomic heterogeneity
My analysis so far has been concerned exclusively with policy instrument equivalence at the
aggregate level. Microeconomic heterogeneity played a role only to the extent that popular
heterogeneous-agent consumption models are a natural (and empirically relevant) candidate
to satisfy my sufficient condition of strong Ricardian non-equivalence.
This section sheds further light on the scope and the limitations of the policy equivalence
result in the face of microeconomic heterogeneity. First, in Section 5.1, I gauge the extent to
which realistic microeconomic heterogeneity in labor supply decisions can break the aggregate
equivalence result. I argue that this is possible in theory, but unlikely to matter much in
practice. Second, in Section 5.2, I emphasize that equivalence at the aggregate level does
not necessarily imply equivalence household-by-household.
5.1
Wealth effects and household labor supply
To understand how household heterogeneity and wealth effects in labor supply can in princi-
ple challenge my equivalence result, it will be useful to recall the proof sketch of Proposition 1.
19This implied direct mapping from interest rates to consumer net excess demand is broadly consistent
with recent empirical evidence (e.g., see Table 4 in Crawley & Kuchler, 2021).
30


As the first step of the argument, I consider nominal interest rate and transfer policies that
induce identical paths of spending. This however is in general not enough to ensure equiv-
alence in general equilibrium—the two policies also need to induce identical responses of
household labor supply. In my environment, the specific wage-NKPC (6)—which impor-
tantly depends only on aggregate consumption ct—ensures that interest rate and stimulus
check policies with identical direct effects on consumer spending indeed also induce identical
labor supply responses, as required.
I conclude from this discussion that it is not wealth effects in labor supply per se that
threaten the equivalence result; rather, a potential challenge are heterogeneous wealth effects,
which would allow two policies with identical effects on total spending to potentially lead to
different responses of labor supply. I here use two experiments to argue that the scope for
such heterogeneity to materially threaten the equivalence result is likely to be limited.
An alternative union bargaining protocol.
Some form of nominal wage rigidity is
widely argued to be necessary to match business-cycle dynamics in general (Christiano et al.,
2005; Smets & Wouters, 2007) and consumption responses to macro shocks in particular
(Auclert et al., 2020; Broer et al., 2020); importantly, it is also consistent with microeconomic
evidence (Grigsby et al., 2019). The derivation of my wage-NKPC (6) relies on one particular
union bargaining protocol that only responds to changes in aggregate consumption, thus
ensuring that my two candidate interest rate and stimulus check policies also lead to identical
responses of labor supply. The exact same bargaining protocol has also been used in other
recent contributions to the HANK literature (Auclert et al., 2021; Aggarwal et al., 2022;
McKay & Wolf, 2022a). An alternative union bargaining protocol (used e.g. in Auclert et al.,
2018) instead has the union respond to a weighted average of individual household marginal
utilities (rather than marginal utility at the average, as in my protocol). Appendix C.5
extends my HANK model environment to such an alternative protocol.
The main takeaway from my analysis in Appendix C.5 is that the equivalence result
continues to hold almost exactly even under the alternative protocol. Intuitively, equivalence
is now not exact because the interest rate and transfer policies that induce identical responses
of consumer spending will generically not induce identical changes in the weighted average
of consumer marginal utilities that enters the union problem. As a result, the adjustments
in labor supply—b

Matching empirical evidence on labor supply responses.
Empirical evidence on
household labor supply suggests that marginal propensities to earn (MPE)—that is, the
response of earned income to a one-time, unexpected lump-sum transfer—are moderate in
size, ranging from around 1% - 3% (Cesarini et al., 2017; Golosov et al., 2021), and somewhat
increasing in household income, roughly doubling from the lowest to the highest income
quartile (Golosov et al., 2021). Standard heterogeneous-household models with flexible labor
supply struggle with both observations (Auclert et al., 2020): MPEs are predicted to be of the
same order of magnitude as MPCs, and MPEs tend to be highest for high-MPC households.
My solution is to adjust household preferences: I consider a hybrid of standard separable and
Greenwood et al. (1988) GHH preferences (as originally proposed by Auclert et al., 2020)
to match average MPEs, and then allow for preference heterogeneity across households to
also match the cross-sectional MPE gradient. To make the heterogeneity particularly stark I
consider a two-type model of savers (with bonds in their utility function) and spenders, with
their MPEs matched to the first and fourth quartiles of income reported in Golosov et al..
Full results are again reported in Appendix C.5.
In the model with empirically relevant and heterogeneous MPEs, I find that the policy
equivalence result again holds almost exactly. The intuition is simply that heterogeneity in
MPEs is small relative to the level of the average MPC. For example, with an MPC of 30%
(an empirically relevant number for stimulus checks of the size studied in Section 4) and
MPEs of 2% for spenders and 4% for savers (in line with Golosov et al.), the direct demand
stimulus associated with either transfers or the equivalent rate cut is an order of magnitude
larger than the difference in labor supply response across households. Aggregate equilibrium
dynamics are thus still dominated by the demand effects at the heart of Proposition 1.
5.2
Non-equivalence at the household level
My equivalence result applies to macroeconomic aggregates, but it does not necessarily hold
household-by-household. I in this section first provide a brief general discussion of this point
and then present a quantitative illustration taken from the HANK model of Section 4.
Household-level consumption functions.

environment described in Section 2.2. Along a perfect foresight transition path, consumption

Distributional outcomes in a HANK model.
I provide a numerical illustration of
this non-equivalence at the household level by returning to the quantitative HANK model of
Section 4. In this environment I compute the evolution of consumption along the household
wealth distribution in response to the macro-equivalent nominal interest rate and stimulus
check policies displayed in Figure 4.
I find that, while macro-equivalent, interest rate and transfer stimulus policies can have
materially different effects in the cross-section of households. Figure 5 presents the results,
splitting the impact consumption response by household liquid wealth percentile (x-axis) into
(a) the direct effects of the policy instrument (green and blue)—defined as the response of
consumption demand to the policy instruments {i
i
ib,τ
τ
τ} alone, fixing all non-policy variables at
their steady state values forever—and (b) the residual indirect effects (shaded purple) coming
from general equilibrium feedback. As discussed above, the two policies by construction
induce the exact same indirect effects household-by-household. The direct effects, on the
other hand, are only guaranteed to integrate to the same number across the entire population,
33


Figure 5: Left panel: The green line shows the time-0 direct household spending response by
liquid wealth percentile to the nominal interest rate policy of Figure 4. The shaded purple area

equivalent uniform transfer stimulus (dark blue and shaded purple).
but need not agree household-by-household. Figure 5 reveals that the direct effects are indeed
quite heterogeneous. On the one hand, nominal interest rate cuts work mostly by directly
stimulating the consumption of the rich (green). This is not surprising: wealthy households
substitute intertemporally, while poor households are close to their borrowing constraint and
so do not. Thus, at the low end of the liquid wealth distribution, monetary policy operates
largely through the shaded purple indirect effects (Kaplan et al., 2018).20
On the other
hand, the equivalent lump-sum transfer policy (blue) mostly acts at the bottom: it relaxes
borrowing constraints and so stimulates consumption of the poor, while the Ricardian rich
households barely respond (since the policy has zero net present value).
Putting the pieces together we see that, relative to a given nominal interest rate cut,
stimulus checks that deliver the exact same aggregate stabilization do so at strictly smaller
cross-sectional consumption dispersion. In Figure 5, monetary stimulus—once all general
equilibrium effects are taken into account—is roughly distributionally neutral (green line
20There is, of course, a second effect: lower interest rates redistribute from bondholders (rich households)
to the government. Since taxes and transfers are uniform, the lower interest rate expenses are then passed
on to all households. These redistributive effects, however, only matter at longer horizons; in the short
term, consumption of rich households increases because of intertemporal substitution, and lower government
interest rate expenses are largely absorbed by a reduction in outstanding debt (see (B.17)).

consumption inequality (blue line plus purple area).21 The normative implications of this
positive observation are explored in detail in McKay & Wolf (2022a).

Extension to investment
As the final step in my argument, I argue that the policy equivalence result extends straight-
forwardly to a richer environment with investment if stimulus checks are complemented by
a second, similarly standard fiscal tool: bonus depreciation stimulus.
6.1
A brief sketch of the environment
I augment the model of Section 2.1 to allow for productive capital. The firm block in this
extended environment closely follows the tradition of standard business-cycle modeling (e.g.
Smets & Wouters, 2007; Justiniano et al., 2010). I provide a brief sketch of this familiar
model here, and relegate further details to Appendix B.7.

21The relatively flat cross-sectional incidence profile seen in the left panel of Figure 5 is consistent with
empirical evidence (see McKay & Wolf, 2022a, and the references therein). My specification of the incidence
of dividends (see Appendix B.6) is one of the model features required to deliver this result.
35


To summarize, intermediate goods producers hire labor on spot markets, invest, pay out
dividends, and save in liquid bonds, perhaps subject to financing constraints.22 My only twist
to this entirely familiar model block is that I allow for a general fiscal investment stimulus
policy τ
τ
τ f(•), mapping investment today into future payments to the firm. Importantly, this
general set-up nests the popular bonus depreciation stimulus policy, in which investment
today reduces tax liabilities in the future (Zwick & Mahon, 2017; Koby & Wolf, 2020). I will
index time-t investment stimulus policies by a single parameter τf,t.
Proceeding exactly as in Section 2.1, we can define an aggregate investment function
I(•); I relegate a discussion of the arguments of this function to Appendix B.7, as it is not
essential here. For my purposes, the only important consideration is that fiscal stimulus is
one of those arguments, with the direct effects of such stimulus summarized by the following
derivative matrix:
Iτf
≡
∂I(•)
∂τ
τ
τ f
Statements about the degree to which conventional fiscal instruments can be used to replicate
monetary stimulus will be statements about the properties of Iτf (and of course Cτ, as before).

The remainder of the model is unchanged. The extension of the equilibrium definition in
Definition 3 is then straightforward, and provided in Appendix B.7.
6.2
Policy equivalence with conventional fiscal instruments
In this extended model, monetary policy operates through two channels: first, as before, it
affects household consumption demand, and second, it changes firm investment and so labor
hiring as well as intermediate goods production. Thus, transfer stimulus policy alone is now
insufficient to replicate the effects of (infeasible) conventional monetary policy—exactly as in
Correia et al. (2013), an additional instrument is needed. In a straightforward generalization
of Proposition 1, Proposition 3 shows that invertibility of Cτ and Iτf is sufficient to leave the
space of implementable output-inflation allocations unchanged.
22Capital or investment adjustment costs could be added without affecting any of the subsequent results.
36


Proposition 3. Consider the extended model of Section 6.1. Suppose that Cτ and Iτf are
both invertible, and consider an allocation {π∗
t , y∗
t }∞
t=0 that is implementable using an interest
rate-only policy. Then it is similarly implementable through time-varying uniform transfer
and bonus depreciation policies alone.
Transfer stimulus now only replicates the consumption channel of monetary policy trans-
mission. If additionally Iτf is invertible, then the general form of investment stimulus consid-
ered in (25) suffices to replicate the investment channel, and so leave the set of implementable
aggregate allocations unchanged. The final step of my argument is to ascertain that bonus
depreciation stimulus can indeed perturb firm investment demand over time as required in
Proposition 3. Unlike the stimulus check case, however, this logic is now entirely straightfor-
ward and in particular can closely follow the work of Correia et al. (2013). For a particularly
transparent example, suppose that intermediate goods firms are not subject to any financial
frictions, as in most conventional business-cycle models. Then bonus depreciation is equiv-
alent to a standard investment subsidy (e.g., see the discussion in Winberry, 2021; Koby &
Wolf, 2020), and so the firm budget constraint becomes
djt = pI
ty(ℓjt, kjt) −wtℓjt −[kjt −(1 −δ)kjt−1]
|
{z
}
≡ijt
+τf,tit
Bonus depreciation stimulus is thus equivalent to an investment subsidy, and so the discussion
of Correia et al. (2013) applies completely unchanged: interest rates ib,t and the subsidy τf,t
both enter investment optimality conditions as wedges, and so the investment channel of
monetary policy can be replicated simply by matching those wedges.23
Taking stock.
Taken together, the results in this section as well as in Section 4 give the
headline practical takeaway of my paper: even in quite large-scale quantitative structural
models of the business cycle, an entirely conventional mix of fiscal instruments—transfer
stimulus payments together with bonus depreciation tax stimulus—suffice to replicate any
desired monetary allocation. The investment side of the argument is straightforward: bonus
depreciation as the standard fiscal tool is sufficiently close to a simple investment subsidy
that I was able to adapt the original results of Correia et al. with very little change. On the
23Binding financial frictions are unlikely to change this overall conclusion: constrained firms would now
both respond to intertemporal investment incentives as well as to the cash flow shock itself, thus presumably
even increasing the potency of bonus depreciation stimulus (Koby & Wolf, 2020). I leave a more detailed
discussion of the shape of Iτf in this case to future work.

consumption side, on the other hand, an entirely different argument was needed—one that
I provided in Sections 3 and 4, constituting the main contribution of the paper.

Conclusion
Over the past decade, much academic and applied policy interest has centered on the question
of how to replicate monetary stimulus when nominal interest rates are constrained.
The central contribution of this paper is to show that, in business-cycle models that are
entirely standard except for the presence of non-Ricardian consumers, a conventional mix of
fiscal instruments—in particular including uniform, deficit-financed stimulus checks—suffices
to replicate the aggregate effects of an arbitrary monetary policy. The core insight is a formal-
ization of the notion that interest rate and stimulus check policies can manipulate consumer
demand “equally flexibly.” This model property—together with a net excess demand ap-
proach to equilibrium characterization `
a la Arrow & Debreu—establishes policy equivalence.
My second main result is an explicit characterization of the transfer policy needed to close
any given shortfall in aggregate demand; in particular I show that, even in state-of-the-art
quantitative heterogeneous-household models, this transfer policy is well-characterized by a
very small number of already measured sufficient statistics.
I leave several important extensions for future work. First, it would be interesting to
compare interest rate and stimulus check policies in a full Ramsey problem. Steps in this
direction are taken in McKay & Wolf (2022a). Second, to the extent that the linear map Cτ
changes over the business cycle, the required transfer stimulus will also depend on the aggre-
gate state of the economy. Future empirical work should try to better measure that state de-
pendence. And third, the policy equivalence logic presented here applies not only to uniform
transfer stimulus; for example, analogous equivalence results could also be established for
policies that redistribute across households or through transfers targeted at sub-populations.
If (large) swings in the amount of outstanding government debt are intrinsically undesirable,
then such alternative equivalent, budget-neutral policies become attractive.

I now present a constructive proof of Proposition 1: leveraging (18) I will show how to construct
a transfer-only policy replicating any interest rate-only policy, and vice-versa. The decomposition
in (A.2) and (A.3) will prove useful in this constructive proof.
1. An interest rate-only policy is a tuple {ib,t, τt}∞
t=0 with
b
τt = b
τ e
t −¯
bb
ib,t−1
so that b
τ x
t = −¯
bb
ib,t−1. By (18), there exists a path of transfers {τ ∗

t=0 such that
Cτ × b

Since the interest rate-only policy by construction has zero net present value, it follows that the
transfer-only policy b

has zero NPV:

Now consider the transfer-only policy tuple {¯

t=0. I will verify that, at the initial
{ct, ℓt, yt, wt, πt, dt}∞
t=0, all markets still clear and all agents still behave optimally. First, by
(A.5) and the definition of b
τ e
t , we still have that limt→∞b
bt = 0. Second, by construction of b
τ ∗
t in
(A.4), the path b

the initial allocation was an equilibrium.

Now consider the interest rate-only policy tuple {i∗

t=0. As before I will verify that,
at the initial {ct, ℓt, yt, wt, πt, dt}∞
t=0, all markets still clear and all agents still behave optimally.
First, by (A.7) and the definition of b
τ e
t , we have that b
bt = 0 for all t, so indeed the policy
is a valid interest rate-only policy. Second, by construction of b
i∗
b,t in (A.6), the path b
c is still
consistent with optimal household behavior given {wt, ℓt, πt, dt; i∗
b,t, ¯
τ + b
τ e
t + b
τ ∗
t }∞
t=0. Finally, all
other model equations are unaffected, so the guess is verified, because the initial allocation was
an equilibrium.

Model details
This appendix contains supplementary model details. I begin in Appendix B.1 by discussing
in more detail the price-NKPC (5). Appendices B.2 to B.5 derive the optimality conditions
for household consumption behavior for the various analytical models of Section 2.2 (and also
justify the form of the wage-NKPC (6)). Appendix B.6 does the same for my quantitative
heterogeneous-agent model, and also discusses the model calibration for Sections 4 and 5.
Finally Appendix B.7 presents the extended model with investment.
B.1
Sticky-price retailers
To derive the price-NKPC (5), let 1 −α denote the elasticity of output with respect to
total labor input at the steady state, 1 −θp ∈(0, 1) denote the probability of a price re-set,
and ϵp the substitutability between different retail varieties in aggregation to the final good.
We can then follow the derivations in Gal´
ı (2015) to arrive at the following log-linearized
price-NKPC:

(B.1) is the log-linearized version of (5).

log-linearized aggregate budget constraint and Euler equation:

Unions order aggregate consumption and employment streams according to the preferences

Spender-saver model
All wealth in the economy is held by savers.

The union orders consumption and employment streams according to a weighted average of
the preferences of savers and spenders. Since spenders and savers have identical steady-state
consumption and hours worked (and identical preferences), it follows that to first order union
bargaining again gives rise to the wage-NKPC (B.4).24
24To see this, it is instructive to consider the flexible-price limit (as for example done in Bilbiie et al.
(2021)). For an individual household i ∈{R, H} we have the usual optimality condition

Unions thus bargain with the same static labor supply target as before, so we again get (B.4).

Overlapping generations of households
At each point in time there is a unit continuum of households i ∈[0, 1], each discounting the
future at rate β and surviving from period to period at rate θ. Preferences of an individual
household i are thus

All households supply common hours worked (as intermediated by the sticky-wage union),
so ℓit = ℓt. Households invest in fair annuities, and so their date-t budget constraint is (see

This Euler equation together with the linearized aggregate household budget constraint fully
characterize the evolution of aggregate consumption.
The union orders consumption and employment streams according to the preferences of
its member households. The fact that all cohorts share the same steady-state consumption
and hours worked implies that optimal union bargaining to first order again yet again gives
rise to the wage-NKPC (B.4), analogously to the spender-saver model (see Footnote 24).

where β(1 + ¯

with separable preferences over consumption, wealth, and hours worked (see (14)), the static
labor supply wedge is yet again given as (B.5) and so as before union bargaining gives (B.4).
B.6
Heterogeneous households
This section completes the description of the quantitative heterogeneous-agent model studied
in Section 4. I first discuss my assumptions on union bargaining (which are revisited in
Section 5.1) and then describe the model calibration.
Union bargaining.
I assume that unions order aggregate consumption and employment
streams according to “as-if” representative-agent preferences:

Given these union preferences, we can yet again follow exactly the same steps as in Erceg
et al. (2000) to arrive at (B.4).
Note that, if unions instead maximized an equal-weighted average of household utility
(as in Auclert et al., 2018),

(B.15)
then a weighted average of household marginal consumption utilities—rather than marginal
consumption utility evaluated at the aggregate consumption level ct—would enter the static
labor wedge and thus (B.4). The model would thus be inconsistent with a wage-NKPC of
my assumed form (6). I discuss this case further in Section 5.1 and Appendix C.5.

Model calibration.
I first discuss the parameterization of the model’s steady state, and
so in particular the induced aggregate consumption function C(•).

Table B.1: HANK model, steady-state calibration.
The values of all parameters relevant for the model’s deterministic steady state are dis-
played in Table B.1. For my quantitative analysis I slightly enrich the preferences displayed
in (16) to allow for exogenous household death at rate ϱ. Preference parameters {γ, φ, ϱ}
as well as the labor substitutability εw are set to standard values. The average return on
(liquid) assets is set in line with standard calibrations of business-cycle models, and the
discount rate is then disciplined through the total amount of liquid wealth. As in McKay
et al. (2016), I assume that households cannot borrow in the liquid asset. Next, for income
risk, I adopt the 33-state specification of Kaplan et al. (2018), ported to discrete time. For
share endowments, I assume that
dit =



0
if ep

χ0(ep
it −ep)χ1 × dt
otherwise
53


where ep
it is the permanent component of household i’s labor productivity. I set the param-
eters {ep, χ0, χ1} as in Wolf (2020). On the firm side, I assume constant returns to scale
in production, and set the substitutability between goods to a standard value. Finally, the
average government tax take, transfers, and debt issuance are all set in line with direct em-
pirical evidence. Relative to Definition 3, I slightly generalize the model to allow for non-zero
government spending, giving the new market-clearing condition
yt = ct + gt
(B.16)
Note that, for all experiments, I keep government expenditure fixed at gt = ¯
g, so its presence
only matters for the steady-state fiscal tax-and-transfer system, and does not directly show
up anywhere in equilibrium dynamics.
In the second step I set the remaining model parameters (which exclusively govern dy-
namics around the deterministic steady state). For the baseline interest rate-only policy
considered in Section 4.3, I consider an interest rate rule of the form
b
ib,t = ϕπb
πt + mt
where mt is the monetary shock, set to give the gradually decaying path of nominal rates
displayed in Figure 4. In a slight generalization of Definition 2, I assume that the baseline
interest rate-only policy is not financed through taxes and transfers adjusting period-by-
period (as in (8)), but instead consider a more general fiscal financing rule of the form
b
bt = ρbb

(B.17)
and with ρb ∈(0, 1). Total transfers adjust residually to balance the government budget.
Since bt evolves gradually over time, it follows that an interest rate cut at time t only
feeds through to higher transfers with a delay.
While the financing rule in Definition 2
was conceptually simpler, the alternative fiscal rule (B.17) has the advantage that interest
rate movements are not accompanied by (counterfactual) large contemporaneous changes in
transfers. This completes the specification of policy for the baseline monetary experiment.
I present the rule parameterizations as well as all other model parameters in Table B.2.
Alternative calibrations.
For my robustness checks in Appendix C.4 I consider two
alternative model calibrations: one with less liquid wealth (¯

where the dividend function aggregates over both intermediate goods producers and sticky-

market, and since productivities are equalized across firms j, two sequences ib

ib and τ

τ f that in-
duce the same paths of investment also invariably induce the same paths of output and labor
hiring. However, since interest rates and investment subsidies enter the budget constraint
differently, the implied dividend paths may be different.
Given investment subsidies to firms, the government budget constraint is adjusted to give
1 + ib,t−1
1 + πt
bt−1 + τt + τf,t({it−q}t

(B.22)

All other parts of the model are unchanged relative to Section 2.1. We thus arrive at the
following equilibrium definition:
Definition 5. An equilibrium is a set of government policies {ib,t, τt, τf,t, bt}∞
t=0 and a set of
aggregates {ct, ℓt, yt, it, kt, wt, πt, dt, pI

5. The output market clears: yt = ct + it for all t ≥0, the government budget constraint

bt = 0. The bond market then clears by Walras’ law.

Supplementary theoretical results
This section presents supplementary theoretical results. Appendices C.1 and C.2 characterize
Cτ, C−1
τ
as well as ˜
Cib in the analytical models of Section 2.2. Appendix C.3 presents further
details on my sufficient statistics formula, and Appendix C.4 documents the accuracy of
this approximation in alternative HANK model calibrations. Appendix C.5 shows that, for
various alternative specifications of labor supply decisions, my policy equivalence result still
holds nearly exactly. Appendix C.6 elaborates on my rule equivalence results from a recursive
perspective. Finally Appendices C.7 and C.8 extend the policy equivalence result to some
even richer model environments and to targeted transfers, respectively.
C.1
Cτ and C−1
τ
in analytical models
This section characterizes the matrix Cτ as well as its inverse in my various analytical models
of non-Ricardian consumption behavior. For the overlapping-generations and bond-in-utility
models, my characterization of Cτ (though not C−1
τ ) will be approximate in the following
particular sense of asymptotic equivalence.
Definition 6. Two sequences of n×n matrices {An} and {Bn} are said to be asymptotically
equivalent if
1. An and Bn are uniformly bounded in strong norm:
||An||, ||Bn|| ≤M < ∞,
n = 1, 2, . . .
2. Dn ≡An −Bn goes to zero in weak norm as n →∞:
lim
n→∞|An −Bn| = lim
n→∞|Dn| = 0
Here the strong (or operator) norm is defined as
||A|| = max

x∗(A∗A)x

where ∗denotes conjugate transpose, while the weak norm (or Hilbert-Schmidt norm) is

defined as

In (13) and (15) I use the symbol “≈” to indicate such asymptotic equivalence. In words,
asymptotic equivalence for my purposes simply means that, as we look at farther-out rows
and columns, the entries of the matrix of interest converge to the “approximate” shape that
I am indicating.

Overlapping generations of households.
I begin with the shape of COLG
τ
as dis-
played in (13). From the discussion in Appendix B.4 it follows that the matrix COLG

gives dollar responses of consumption to dollar changes in income—is fully characterized by
the following pair of linearized (not log-linearized) budget constraint and Euler equation:

Proposition C.1. Consider the consumption-savings problem of a household sector with

I begin with the shape of CBiU

loss of generality set this term equal to 1. We then arrive at the following result:
Proposition C.2. Consider the consumption-savings problem of a household with bonds in

˜

For all of the analytical models presented in Section 2.2, the two consumption derivative
matrices Cτ and ˜
Cib are extremely tightly related. This section establishes this claim and
reveals the precise shape of the relationship.

0. Plugging this into the optimality conditions and re-arranging, we see that the impulse
response of c∗is identical to the impulse response of c to a date-0 interest rate change scaled
by γ. That is, we have
C∗
τ(•, 1) = Cτ(•, 1) −e1 = γ ˜
Cib(•, 1)
60


where e1 = (1, 0, 0, . . . )′. This gives the first column of (C.11):
˜
Cib(•, 1) = −1
γ (e1 −Cτ(•, 1))
Similarly, for date-1 shocks, we have
C∗
τ(•, 2) = Cτ(•, 2) −e2 = −γ ˜
Cib(•, 1) + γ ˜
Cib(•, 2)
where e2 = (0, 1, 0, . . . )′. Thus we get
˜
Cib(•, 2) = −1
γ (e1 −Cτ(•, 1) + e2 −Cτ(•, 2))
giving the second column of (C.11). All other columns follow analogously.
It is immediate that this argument applies without change to the spender-saver model.

Again defining b

is again identical to the impulse response of c to a date-0 interest rate change scaled by γ.
The previous argument thus continues to apply unchanged, and in particular also applies for
all further columns of ˜
Cib.
Finally, the argument is only slightly more involved for the bond-in-utility model. Here
the two consumption derivative matrices are characterized by the system

The analysis in this section confirms my claim in Footnote 10: in my analytical models,
knowledge of Cτ (and thus my three sufficient statistics {ω, θ, ¯
r}) together with the intertem-
poral elasticity of substitution γ−1 already suffices to also fully characterize ˜
Cib.
C.3
The sufficient statistics formula
My sufficient statistics formula maps the three observables {ω, θ, ¯
r} into the matrix Cτ (and
thus its inverse C−1
τ ). The formula proceeds in two steps.
First, given {θ, ¯
r}, I construct a matrix C(1)
τ
that has the same asymptotic shape as that
of the overlapping-generations and bond-in-utility models. Specifically, I first set

τ ), and date-0

r (the first row of C(1)
τ ), as in (13).
I then construct the remaining columns of C(1)
τ
as a function of the first row and column,
and in a way that respects budget constraints. For the second column, I set
C(1)
τ (•, 2) = C(1)
τ (1, 2) ×
 
1
−C(1)
τ (•, 1)(1 + ¯
r)
!
+
 
0
C(1)
τ (•, 1)

This expression builds on the intuition of the “fake-news” algorithm of Auclert et al. (2019):
the first term is the response of households to a date-1 income shock announced at date-0
but then reversed at date 1; the second term then undoes that date-1 reversal, ensuring that
the sum gives us the actual response to a date-1 income shock—that is, C(1)
τ (•, 2). Relative
to the more naive strategy of simply imposing the asymptotic shape (13) throughout, this
alternative approach has the appeal that household budget constraints are always satisfied.
I thank an anonymous referee of alerting me of this important point.
Continuing recursively, I then set
C(1)
τ (•, h) = C(1)
τ (1, h) ×

τ (•, 1)(1 + ¯
r)

h = 3, 4, . . .
This specifies the entire matrix C(1)
τ
as a function only of {θ, ¯
r}, and does so in a way that
imposes the asymptotic shape (13) yet does not violate any budget constraints.
Second, I add a margin of spenders to disentangle the MPC ω and the spending slope
θ. Note that, in my construction of C(1)
τ , the MPC is mechanically given as
1 −
θ
1+¯


. To
match any desired arbitrary MPC ω I then simply set
Cτ
=
θ −(1 −ω)(1 + ¯
r)
θ
× I

(1 −ω)(1 + ¯
r)
θ
× C(1)
τ
It is straightforward to verify that the resulting Cτ matches the desired MPC ω. I have thus
mapped my three sufficient statistics {ω, θ, ¯
r} into a matrix Cτ(ω, θ, ¯
r) that (i) matches the
average MPC ω and spending slope θ, and (ii) is consistent with lifetime household budget
constraints. From here I can then also construct C−1
τ (ω, θ, ¯
r). Note that existence of this
inverse is ensured as long as θ < 1 and ω ≥1 −

Unlike the analytical models considered in Section 2.2, the
mixture model underlying the sufficient statistics formula does not admit a straightforward
characterization of the C−1

Perturbing the sufficient statistics.
I here further substantiate my claim that, for
empirically relevant values of the sufficient statistics, even moderately sized stimulus check
policies suffice to close meaningful shortfalls in aggregate spending. To do so I repeat the
exercise of Figure 3 for a range of values of my sufficient statistics {ω, θ, ¯
r}. Specifically,
I continue to fix ¯
r = 0.01, consider ω ∈{0.2, 0.3, 0.4, 0.5} and then pin down the slope θ
by requiring the same ratio
θ
1−ω as in my quantitative heterogeneous-household model. The
range of MPCs ω that I consider is chosen to contain and in fact go beyond the range of
estimates available from the literature (e.g. Parker et al., 2013; Fagereng et al., 2018).
Results are displayed in Figure C.1. The figure illustrates my claim: across the range of
empirically relevant values for my sufficient statistics, the required stimulus check policies
25Inspecting Figure 2, we see that convergence to these limits tends to be very quick.
26To derive (C.18), I leverage the fact that Cτ(ω, θ, ¯
r) is asymptotically Topelitz, implying that its inverse
is also asymptotically Toeplitz. I then leverage known expressions for that inverse (see Gray, 2006). The
detailed argument is available upon request.

C−1
τ
in alternative HANK calibrations
The analysis in Section 4.3 confirmed the accuracy of my three-parameter sufficient statistics
formula for Cτ and C−1
τ
in the baseline calibration of my heterogeneous-household model. I
here repeat the same exercise for two materially different model calibrations: one with very
low liquid wealth (implying a counterfactually large average MPC of ω = 0.64) and one with
a lot of liquid wealth (implying a counterfactually small average MPC of ω = 0.12). Results
are reported in Figures C.2 and C.3.
The takeaways from these figures are twofold.
First, changing the model calibration
materially affects the model-implied consumption map Cτ and its inverse C−1
τ . As expected,
for low liquid wealth, the inverse C−1
τ
looks closer to a simple spender-saver model (recall
Figure 1 and notice the y-axis scale) and the required transfer stimulus policies are even
smaller than in my baseline analysis. For high liquid wealth, the inverse C−1
τ
looks closer
to an overlapping-generations or bond-in-utility model (again recall Figure 1 and notice the
y-axis scale), and the transfer stimulus policies required to close a given shortfall in demand
are now much larger. Second, even though Cτ looks very different across calibrations, my
sufficient statistics formula throughout approximates C−1
τ
and thus the implied equivalent
transfer stimulus policies very well.

Heterogeneous wealth effects in labor supply
This section elaborates on my discussion of the role of heterogeneity in wealth effects in labor
supply across households (see Section 5.1). I first present results for an alternative union
bargaining protocol and then consider an alternative model with preference heterogeneity,
designed to match empirical evidence on heterogeneity in marginal propensities to earn
(Golosov et al., 2021). Results for both are reported in Figure C.4.

This is the specification of the wage-NKPC originally derived in Auclert et al. (2018) and
implied by the union objective (B.15). I note that, in this case, my policy equivalence result
will not hold exactly: two interest rate and stimulus check policies with identical direct
effects on net excess demand (and so ct) will not necessarily have identical direct effects on
c∗
t, thus inducing different wedges in the economy’s aggregate supply relation (C.19).
Are these differential labor supply effects likely to materially undermine the policy equiv-
alence result? The left panel Figure C.4 suggests that the answer is “no”. To construct the
panel, I first compute impulse responses to a gradual monetary policy shock (with persis-
tence 0.6), normalized to in general equilibrium increase consumption on impact by one per
cent (grey). I then follow the steps in the proof of Proposition 1 to construct a stimulus
check policy with identical effects on partial equilibrium consumer spending. The general
equilibrium impulse response of consumption to this policy is displayed as the blue dashed
line. The main takeaway is that the two lines are very close, with the stimulus check policy
overall slightly more stimulative than the (not-quite-)equivalent interest rate cut.
The intuition for the results displayed in Figure C.4 is somewhat subtle. Both policies
by design lead to a response of partial equilibrium consumption demand with zero present
value—initially positive and then later on negative. Under my baseline wage-NKPC (6),
this initial decrease and later increase in the average marginal utility of consumption leads
to an initial decrease and later increase of union labor supply. With the alternative formu-
lation (C.19), on the other hand, the labor supply response is governed by average marginal
utility. Since most of the consumption adjustment following the transfer policy comes from
high-MPC households (who tend to consume less), average marginal utility of consumption
changes by more than after the equivalent rate cut—it drops by more initially and expands
by more later on. It then follows that labor supply also contracts by more initially and
expands by more later on, so the overall partial equilibrium net excess demand path (which
equals consumption demand less labor supply) is more front-loaded after the stimulus check

policy. But we know from Auclert et al. (2018) that more front-loaded excess demand paths
lead to a bigger boom in general equilibrium, so stimulus check policy will stimulate output
by more—exactly as we see in Figure C.4. This effect however is moderate in size, for two
reasons. First, average marginal utility and marginal utility at the average are still not too
different, so the desired labor supply response is also not too different. Second, any such
transitory differences in desired labor supply matter even less in general equilibrium as long
as wages are at least moderately sticky (Christiano, 2011), as is the case in my model.
Mixture model results.
My second exercise is designed to speak as closely as possible
to the empirical evidence reported in Golosov et al. (2021). Those authors report marginal
propensities to earn (MPEs)—defined as the response of labor income to an unearned lump-
sum wealth gain—of up to $3 per additional $100 in wealth, with the response roughly
two times larger for the highest-income households compared to the lowest-income ones (see
their Table 3.2). These estimates are roughly twice as large as those reported in prior work,
notably Cesarini et al. (2017) (see Table J.1 of Golosov et al.). While it is straightforward
to match such average MPEs in heterogeneous-agent models (see Auclert et al., 2020), it is
much harder to match the cross-sectional dispersion in MPEs (which is what matters for my
policy equivalence result). Intuitively, the challenge is that, in standard models of household
68


consumption and labor supply, MPEs are increasing (in absolute value) with MPCs.27 Since
poorer households tend to have higher MPCs, this would also imply that they have higher
MPEs (in absolute value), inconsistent with the empirical evidence reviewed above.
My solution is to consider a two-type spender-saver model with preference heterogeneity
chosen to ensure higher MPEs for low-MPC households. Specifically, I consider a model with
so-called “GHH-plus preferences” (Auclert et al., 2020); savers have preferences

Here the two coefficients {δR, δH} control the strength of wealth effects in labor, with δ = 0
corresponding to standard separable preferences and δ = 1 corresponding to GHH prefer-
ences. I calibrate the consumer part of the model to induce consumption behavior similar
to my baseline HANK model—matching in particular ω = 0.3—and MPEs consistent with
Golosov et al. (2021)—an MPE of $3.5 for savers and an MPE of $1.8 for spenders. The
model parameterization is reported in Table C.1. All other parameters are set exactly as in
my baseline HANK model, as reported in Tables B.1 and B.2.28
The model features cross-sectional heterogeneity in wealth effects in labor supply, so the
policy equivalence result will not hold exactly. The right panel of Figure C.4 however reveals
that it continues to approximately hold. I already in the main text gave the intuition for why
the magnitude of the inaccuracy is so small (recall Section 5.1). I here instead focus on the
direction of the error. The intuition is exactly opposite to that of the adjusted HANK model
studied above. Savers have a larger MPE, so labor supply initially contracts by relatively
more after an interest rate cut, and later on increases by relatively more. The total implied
27This follows straightforwardly from the standard labor supply optimality condition with separable pref-
erences over consumption and labor supply. See Auclert et al. (2020) for details.
28Except for δH and δR and thus their wealth effects in labor supply, I treat spenders and savers entirely
symmetrically.

net excess demand path is thus more frontloaded after the interest rate policy, and so now
the interest rate cut is slightly more expansionary, as seen in the right panel of Figure C.4.
Summary.
My conclusion from the previous two experiments is that cross-sectional het-
erogeneity in wealth effects in labor supply is unlikely to materially threaten my headline
policy equivalence result. However, it is important to note that this takeaway hinges on the
equivalent stimulus check policy being moderate in size: by the evidence in Golosov et al.
(2021), for very large transfers, we would expect the cross-sectional heterogeneity in labor
supply responses to become larger relative to the demand stimulus of the policy (i.e., MPEs
are larger relative to MPCs). The fact that equivalent stimulus check policies are moderate
in size—the key takeaway of Section 4—is thus an integral part of my argument.
C.6
A recursive perspective on equivalent fiscal rules
The equivalence results for policy rules in Section 3.2 were presented using perfect-foresight
notation.
I here elaborate on the interpretation of my equivalent rules from a recursive
aggregate risk perspective. To build further intuition I also provide a closed-form example
of an equivalent explicit transfer rule in a simple overlapping-generations environment.
From perfect-foresight transitions to recursive rules.
Recall that my discus-
sion in Section 3.2 was split into two parts: implicit targeting rules and explicit instrument
rules. For implicit targeting rules, we saw that the policy rule itself remains the same—only
the instrument that is used to implement the rule changes. By the proof of Corollary 1, we
can write the path of transfers that implements the desired implicit targeting rule as

cPE is the net excess demand sequence that ensures aggregate output market-clearing,
characterized explicitly in the proof of Corollary 1. What happens in the analogous linearized
economy with aggregate risk? Prior work has established that linearized perfect-foresight
transition paths are identical to shock impulse responses—i.e., conditional expectations—in
linearized economies with aggregate risk (Boppart et al., 2018; Auclert et al., 2019). So
consider the analogous linearized economy with aggregate risk at its initial date 0, subject
to some initial date-0 shocks. It then follows from (C.23) that, to implement her desired
implicit targeting rule, the policymaker at date 0 needs to sets current and expected future
values of transfers as

In words, at each date t, the policymaker revises current and expected future transfers to
households to make sure that she generates the time path of current and expected future
consumer spending required to implement her desired targeting rule. Starting from date 0,
the recursion (C.27) affords a full characterization of the equilibrium sequence of transfers
in the linearized economy with aggregate risk.
A similar argument applies to explicit instrument rules. Recall that, for the perfect-
foresight transition equilibrium, the equivalent explicit transfer rule takes the form

response to any macro shock. At date 0 the policymaker thus sets current and expected

(C.30) is an explicit instrument rule in the sense of Giannoni & Woodford (2002): it specifies,
at each date t, the current and expected future values of the policy instrument as a function
of lagged, current, and expected future values of macro aggregates. Note that the dependence
on lagged aggregates is here encoded in the lagged instrument term Et−1

It is important to note that the shape of the mapping from macro aggregates to policy
instruments in (C.30) may in general be quite complicated, and in particular can be much
more complicated than the policy rules typically considered in recursively specified models
with aggregate risk. To see this, consider instead a familiar simple Taylor rule:

like (C.31) to characterize the potentially complicated time path of expected future interest
rates embedded in (C.32). Things are generally not as simple for the equivalent transfer
rule (C.30)—the matrix product C−1
τ
˜
Cib need not be proportional to an identity matrix, so
current and future transfers may depend in a much more complicated way on current and
expected future output and inflation. The next paragraph provides an explicit worked-out
example illustrating this discussion using my analytical OLG model.

A simple explicit transfer rule.
By (C.30), the recursively written explicit transfer
rule that replicates the simple Taylor rule (C.31) sets transfers as

To further characterize this general rule expression I consider the special case of a simple OLG
model, leveraging my closed-form expressions for ˜

algebra reveals that for this model we have that
(COLG

(C.34)
Plugging (C.34) into (C.33), we see that mapping the simple Taylor rule (C.31) into transfer
space does indeed result in an almost equally simple explicit transfer-only rule:

active demand management
(C.35)
If transfers are set according to this simple policy rule, then they in the linearized equilibrium
with aggregate risk indeed satisfy the general recursion (C.33).
Thus, in this particular
environment, an interest rate policy that responds to contemporaneous macro aggregates is
equivalent to a still quite simple transfer-only policy that responds to current and one-period-
lagged aggregates, with the response coefficients given from (C.34). The rule representation
in this special case is so simple because the map (COLG
τ
)−1 ×( ˜
COLG
ib
)—while not proportional
to an identity matrix—is nevertheless quite special: it is tridiagonal with repeating rows,
so we can summarize the potentially very complicated expectation revisions in (C.33) with
just one simple equation, (C.35). This is exactly analogous to the Taylor rule (C.31) being
equivalent to the more complicated expression (C.32).
I emphasize, however, that the precise shape of the equivalent explicit transfer-only rule
invariably depends on ˜
Cib—an object that is likely to be shaped by forces outside of my
particular model, most notably household mortgage refinancing. Those forces may result in
a more complicated ˜
Cib, implying that we may in general not be able to collapse the general
73


recursive representation (C.30) to a very simple explicit rule like (C.35).29 What will not
depend on this precise shape, however, is the fact that—given my characterization of Cτ—
practical implementation of the potentially complicated equivalent transfer rule (C.30) will
robustly only require moderately sized fluctuations in transfers.
C.7
Other model extensions
I consider three further model extensions: behavioral models of the consumption-savings
decision, durable consumption, and a richer network production structure.
Behavioral consumption models.
The equivalence result extends without change to
standard behavioral models of the household consumption-savings decision. For example,
the classical cognitive discounting (Gabaix, 2020) and sticky information (Mankiw & Reis,
2002) models can be fit into my general aggregate consumption function set-up by proceeding
as follows. Define E as a linear map whose (i, j)th entry indicates the fraction of households
at time i that are aware of a future shock that will materialize at date j. In the cognitive
discounting and sticky information cases, this map is respectively given as
ECD =







(1 −ψ)2

where the coefficient ψ in both cases indicates the severity of the behavioral frictions—
cognitive discounting in the first case, and the arrival of information about future shocks in
the sticky information case. For any input q ∈{w, ℓ, π, d, τ, ib} to the aggregate consumption
function, we then obtain the behavioral analogue of the consumption derivative matrix,
denoted C†
q, from its full-information analogue Cq by computing (see Auclert et al., 2019)
C†
q(t, s) =
min(t,s)
X
p=1
(Ep,s −Ep−1,s)Cq(t −p + 1, s −p + 1)
(C.36)
I emphasize two main takeaways from this analysis. First, it illustrates my claims in Sec-
29Of course that is not surprising. If interest rates and transfers induce spending dynamics with very
different time profiles, then simple rules for one instrument (like a Taylor rule) will be equivalent to quite
complicated rules for the other.
74


tion 3.1: the sufficient condition of strong Ricardian non-equivalence is general, and applies
in particular also to standard behavioral models of consumption. Second, in quantitatively
relevant but behavioral models of consumption (as e.g. in Auclert et al., 2019), an extended
version of my sufficient statistics formula applies: by (C.36), Cτ is now characterized by my
three sufficient statistics (ω, θ, ¯
r) (which give the full-information benchmark) together with
a fourth statistic (ψ) reflecting the severity of behavioral frictions. Empirical evidence along
the lines of Ganong & Noel (2019) could be used to discipline this additional parameter and
implement an extended version of my sufficient statistics formula.
Durable goods.
The results in this paper extend without change to a model with
durables as long as durables and non-durables can be produced costlessly out of some com-
mon final good; that is, if real relative prices of the two goods are always 1 and we can write
the aggregate resource constraint as
yt = ct + dh
t −(1 −δ)dh
t
|
{z
}
et
(C.37)
where et is total household expenditure, ct is non-durables consumption, dh
t is the stock of
durables, and δ is the depreciation rate. Letting Eτ denote the analogous derivative map
for the response of total spending to lump-sum income, the key condition for my results to
extend to this model is that Eτ is invertible—strong Ricardian non-equivalence now applied
to total spending. The details of the argument are straightforward and thus omitted: interest
rate and transfer policies can perturb net excess demand for the common final good equally
flexibly and are thus also equivalent in general equilibrium, by exactly the same argument
as in the proof of Proposition 1.30
I emphasize that the assumptions underlying this extended equivalence result are empir-
ically relevant: relative durable goods prices tend to not respond much to standard business-
cycle fluctuations (House & Shapiro, 2008; McKay & Wieland, 2019; Beraja & Wolf, 2020),
suggesting that the aggregation to a common aggregate resource constraint (C.37) is sensi-
ble. It is furthermore also an assumption made in recent quantitative structural explorations
of durable goods spending (e.g., Berger & Vavra, 2015).
30If non-durables and durables were not produced out of a common final good (and so their relative prices
could fluctuate), then it would of course still be possible to engineer a sequence of transfers that mimics a
given interest rate policy’s effect on total spending. Nothing guarantees, however, that the composition of
that spending would be the same. If relative prices can move then the composition will matter in general
equilibrium, thus breaking equivalence.
75


Network production.
The policy equivalence result leverages properties of consumer
spending behavior and as such is robust to many different possible model extensions on the
production side of the economy. I here provide one illustration using a simple model of
roundabout production (e.g., see Phaneuf et al., 2018).
Differently from my baseline model, intermediate goods firms now produce using both
labor as well as the intermediate good itself, with production function
yt = qϕ
t ℓ(1−α)(1−ϕ)
t
where ϕ ∈[0, 1) denotes the share of intermediates in production. A standard cost mini-
mization problem gives marginal costs as
mct =
 
1
(1 −α)(1 −ϕ)ϕ
ϕ
1−ϕ
!1−ϕ
w1−ϕ
t
ℓα(1−ϕ)
t
and so, in log deviations,
c
mct = (1 −ϕ)

b
wt + αb
ℓt

Following the same steps as in the derivation of (B.1) we thus find that
b
πt =
(1 −θp)(1 −

r)
θp
(1 −α)(1 −ϕ)
1 −α + αεp

b
wt + αb

+ βb
πt+1
(C.38)
The only effect of roundabout production is thus to flatten the price-NKPC, leaving the
headline policy equivalence result entirely unchanged.
C.8
Targeted transfers
My analysis throughout was focussed on uniform lump-sum taxes and transfers. This was by
design: my objective was to establish that, in standard models of non-Ricardian consumption
behavior, manipulating taxes and transfers over time can manipulate spending just like
changes in intertemporal prices—that is, stimulus checks are stimulative even without any
redistribution. In models with microeconomic heterogeneity (like HANK), it is of course
also possible to consider transfer policies aimed at sub-populations of households and thus
(in part) operational through redistribution. My results extend with little change to such
alternative policy experiments.
Recall from the proof of Proposition 1 that the key requirement for policy equivalence
76


is that, for ay excess demand sequence b
c
c
c with zero net present value, we can find a transfer
policy that induces a net excess demand path of b
c
c
c.
To see how this can be done using
targeted transfers, consider a transfer targeted at some subgroup of households (group a)
and financed using taxes on another subgroup (group b). I denote the transfer to group a
by b
τ
τ
τ x and write the corresponding tax financing as b

respectively, the effect of any given transfer policy b

Analogously to the proof of Proposition 1, a sufficient condition for policy equivalence is now
simply that every net excess demand path with zero net present value lies in the image of
Cx
τ . Differently from my main analysis, characterizing Cx
τ does not require MPCs averaged
across the entire household cross-section, but MPCs averaged across the subgroups a and b.
For practical policy purposes, there are two key differences between my uniform policies
and such targeted policies. First, the latter also work explicitly through redistribution across
households, and thus in particular can affect net excess demand even with period-by-period
budget balance and without any fluctuations in aggregate government debt. Second, it is
unclear ex ante whether targeted transfers need to be larger or smaller in per capita terms.
On the one hand, to engineer a given spending response by targeting a smaller group of
households, the required transfer size per capita increases mechanically. On the other hand,
if targeted households have larger MPCs, the required transfer decreases in size. I leave a
detailed characterization of such macro-equivalent targeted transfers to future work.

I consider each of the three analytical models in turn.
1. Spender-saver model. It is straightforward to verify that, expressed in terms of µ and ¯

the inverse (CH

(D.8)
This completes the constructive proof: as long as µ ∈(0, 1], this linear map is well-defined
and maps bounded sequences of b
c
c
c into bounded sequences of b
τ
τ
τ.

2. Overlapping-generations model.
I will show that, for every bounded sequence of con-
sumption b
c
c
c∗, there exists a bounded sequence of transfers b
τ
τ
τ ∗that induces this sequence
of consumption, thus establishing invertibility. From the Euler equation (C.3) it follows
that we must have
b
τ ∗
t + 1
β
b
b∗
t−1 = [1 −θ(1 −βθ)]b
c∗
t −βθb
c∗
t+1
(1 −βθ)(1 −θ)
Since b
b−1 = 0 this expression already gives b
τ ∗
0 (as long as θ < 1, as assumed). Next we
get from the budget constraint (C.2) that
b
b∗
t =
βθ
(1 −βθ)(1 −θ)(b
c∗
t −b
c∗
t+1)
Combining this with the expression for b
τ ∗

b
τ ∗
t = −θb
c∗
t−1 + (1 + βθ2)b
c∗
t −βθb
c∗
t+1
(1 −βθ)(1 −θ)
establishing the claim. Collecting coefficients, we obtain the closed-form expression (C.5).
3. Bond-in-utility model. I will proceed as I did for the overlapping-generations model. From
the Euler equation (C.7) it now follows that we must have
b
b∗
t =
1
η
γ [1 −β(1 + ¯
r)]

b
c∗
t −β(1 + ¯

As long as α, η > 0 we have that β(1 + ¯
r) < 1, so the denominator is positive and the
expression is well-defined. Next we get from the budget constraint (C.6) that
b
y∗
t = b
c∗
t + b

t −(1 + ¯

Thus we have that

establishing the claim.
Finally I note that the above arguments also immediately imply invertibility whenever
an overlapping-generations or bond-in-utility matrix is combined with a margin of spenders,
as done in my sufficient statistics formula:
Cτ = (1 −µ) × COLG
τ
+ µ × I,
or
Cτ = (1 −µ) × CBiU
τ
+ µ × I,
µ ∈(0, 1)
The key step in the argument is to note that the eigenvalues of COLG
τ
and CBiU
τ
are all strictly
positive.31 Since the eigenvalues of Cτ are equal to µ > 0 plus (1 −µ) times the eigenvalues
of COLG
τ
or CBiU
τ
, it follows that Cτ is also invertible.
D.4
Proof of Proposition 3
By assumption, the allocation {π∗
t , y∗
t }∞
t=0 is implementable using an interest rate-only policy
tuple {i∗
b,t, τ ∗
t , 0}∞
t=0. Now consider the alternative policy tuple {¯
ib, τ ∗
t + b

t=0 where

(D.10)
I now claim that this policy tuple similarly engineers the allocation {π∗
t , y∗
t }∞
t=0. First, with
b
τ
τ
τ †
f set as in (D.9), the investment, output and labor demand paths are unchanged; however,
as remarked in Appendix B.7, the dividend paths may be different. The transfer path b
τ
τ
τ † is
constructed to offset both the missing monetary stimulus as well as neutralize any potential
dividend-related effects: to see this, note that we have
b

Next note that, since they induce the same paths of consumption, investment, hours worked
and production, and since by assumption wages are unchanged, the initial policy {i∗
b,t, τ ∗
t , 0}∞
t=0
31This follows from my closed-form expressions for (COLG
τ
)−1 and (CBiU
τ
)−1 in Appendix C.1: both matrices
are positive definite (they are both diagonally dominant with positive diagonals) so all their eigenvalues are
strictly positive, and so the same is true for COLG
τ
and CBiU
τ
.

and the new policy {¯

τ †

f,t}∞
t=0 have the same present value in the augmented govern-
ment budget constraint (B.22), exactly as in the proof of Proposition 1. With limt→∞b
bt = 0
in the initial equilibrium, it then follows that we must also have limt→∞b
bt = 0 in the new
one, as required. All other model equations are unaffected, so the guess is verified.

Plugging into the optimality conditions (C.2) - (C.3) and matching coefficients, we get the
following system of equations characterizing behavior in response to an anticipated income

ϑcb + ϑbb −1

(D.11)
ϑcτh + ϑbτh
=
0,
h = 0, 1, . . . , H −1

(D.15)
[1 −θ(1 −βθ)] ϑcτH −βθϑcbϑbτH
=
(1 −βθ)(1 −θ)
(D.16)
I will begin by characterizing the solution of this system. From (D.11) and (D.14) we have
ϑbb
=
θ
ϑcb
=
1
β −θ
Next, from (D.13) and (D.16), we have that
ϑcτH
=
1 −βθ
84


ϑbτH
=
βθ
Finally, from (D.12) and (D.15),
ϑcτh
=
βθϑcτh+1 = (βθ)H−h(1 −βθ)
ϑbτh
=
−βθϑcτh+1 = −(βθ)H−h(1 −βθ)
This characterizes the full solution.
I can now prove the various asymptotic statements of Proposition C.1. First we have
that
b
cH,H = ϑcb
H−1
X
ℓ=0
ϑℓ
bbϑbτH−ℓ−1 + ϑcτH
Plugging in from the closed-form expressions above and simplifying:
lim
H→∞cH,H = (1 −θ)(1 −βθ)
1 −βθ2
= const.
Next looking below the main diagonal:
b
cH+1,H = ϑcb
H
X
ℓ=0
ϑℓ
bbϑdτH−ℓ
and so
1
θb
cH+1,H = ϑcb
ϑbb
(ϑbbb
bH−1,H + ϑbτH) = ϑcbb
bH−1,H + (1 −θβ) = b
cH,H
Similarly
1
θb
cH+ℓ,H = ϑcb
ϑbb
ϑbbb
bH+ℓ−2,H = b
cH+ℓ−1,H
The proof reveals that the result holds for any H, not just H →∞.
Finally I look above the main diagonal. Here we have
b
cH−1,H = ϑcb
H−2
X
ℓ=0
ϑℓ
bbϑbτH−ℓ−2 + ϑcyH−1
We thus have that
1
βθb
cH−1,H = ϑcb
H−2
X
ℓ=0
ϑℓ
bbϑbτH−ℓ−1 + ϑcτH = b
cH,H −ϑcbϑH−1
bb
ϑbτ0
85


The last term goes to zero as H →∞. Similarly we have
b
cH−ℓ,H = ϑcb
H−ℓ−1
X
ℓ=0
ϑℓ
bbϑbτH−ℓ−2 + ϑcτH−ℓ
and so
1
βθb
cH−ℓ,H = ϑcb
H−ℓ−1
X
ℓ=0
ϑℓ
bbϑbτH−ℓ−1 + ϑcτH−ℓ+1 = b
cH−ℓ+1,H −ϑcbϑH−ℓ
bb
ϑbτ0
where the last term again goes to zero as H →∞, completing the argument.

Plugging into the optimality conditions (C.6) - (C.7) and matching coefficients, we get the

ϑcτH −β(1 + ¯

γ [1 −β(1 + ¯

=

(D.22)
I now state and prove two useful properties of this system.
86


Lemma D.1. Consider the system (D.17) - (D.22). The solution satisfies
ϑcb
ϑbb
ϑbτH = ϑcτH
(D.23)
Proof. By (D.20) we have that
ϑcb
ϑbb
= β(1 + ¯
r)ϑcb + η
γ [1 −β(1 + ¯
r)]
(D.22) furthermore gives
ϑcτH
ϑbτH
= β(1 + ¯
r)ϑcb + η
γ [1 −β(1 + ¯
r)]
Combining the two, the claim follows.
Lemma D.2. Consider the system (D.17) - (D.22). The solution satisfies
ϑcτh
ϑcτh+1
= βϑbb,
h = 0, 1, . . . , H −1
(D.24)
and
ϑbτh
ϑbτh+1
= βϑbb,
h = 0, 1, . . . , H −2
(D.25)
Proof. (D.18) and (D.21) together imply that
ϑcτh =
β(1 + ¯
r)
1 + β(1 + ¯
r)ϑcb + η
γ [1 −β(1 + ¯
r)]ϑcτh+1
(D.17) and (D.20) furthermore give
ϑbb =
(1 + ¯
r)
1 + β(1 + ¯
r)ϑcb + η
γ [1 −β(1 + ¯
r)]
The first part of the statement thus follows. Finally, since we for all h = 0, 1, . . . , H −2 have
that
ϑcτh
ϑcτh+1
=
ϑbτh
ϑbτh+1
the second part follows as well.
87


D.7
Proof of Proposition C.2
The proof of Proposition C.2 relies on Lemmas D.1 and D.2. My derivations below further-
more leverage the fact that the impulse response of wealth holdings is given as
b
bt,H =
t
X
ℓ=0
ϑℓ
bbϑbτt−ℓ
I begin with the MPC at time H. Here we have that
b
cH,H = ϑcb
H−1
X
ℓ=0
ϑℓ
bbϑbτH−ℓ−1 + ϑcτH
Plugging in from the closed-form expressions above and simplifying:
lim
H→∞b
cH,H =
ϑcb
1 −βϑ2
bb
ϑbyH−1 + ϑcτH
But by (D.18) - (D.19) and (D.21) - (D.22) ϑbτH−1 and ϑcτH are actually independent of H,
so b
cH,H converges to some constant.
Next I look below the main diagonal. Here we have that
b
cH+1,H = ϑcb
H
X
ℓ=0
ϑℓ
bbϑdτH−ℓ
Now let θ ≡ϑbb. Then we have
1
θb
cH+1,H = ϑcb
ϑbb
(ϑbb b
dH−1,H + ϑbτH) = ϑcb b
dH−1,H + ϑcτH = b
cH,H
Similarly
1
θb
cH+ℓ,H = ϑcb
ϑbb
ϑbb b
dH+ℓ−2,H = b
cH+ℓ−1,H
I have thus proven the half of (C.8) below the main diagonal. The proof reveals that the
result holds for any H, not just H →∞.
Finally I look above the main diagonal. Here we have
b
cH−1,H = ϑcb
H−2
X
ℓ=0
ϑℓ
bbϑbτH−ℓ−2 + ϑcτH−1
88


We thus have that
1
βθb
cH−1,H = ϑcb
H−2
X
ℓ=0
ϑℓ
bbϑbτH−ℓ−1 + ϑcτH = b
cH,H −ϑcbϑH−1
bb
ϑbτ0
But with ϑbb inside the unit circle—the stable solution of the system (D.17) and (D.20)—it
follows that second term converges to zero for H →∞, establishing the claim.32 Proceeding
analogously for any ℓ> 0, we have
b
cH−ℓ,H = ϑcb
H−ℓ−1
X
ℓ=0
ϑℓ
bbϑbτH−ℓ−2 + ϑcτH−ℓ
and so
1
βθb
cH−ℓ,H = ϑcb
H−ℓ−1
X
ℓ=0
ϑℓ
bbϑbτH−ℓ−1 + ϑcτH−ℓ+1 = b
cH−ℓ+1,H −ϑcbϑH−ℓ
bb
ϑbτ0
thus completing the proof of the half of (C.8) above the main diagonal.
32This argument leverages the fact that θbτ0 →0, which follows from Lemma D.2 together with the fact
θbb is inside the unit circle.

What Explains the Stock Market’s Reaction to Federal Reserve Policy?
Ben S. Bernanke and Kenneth N. Kuttner
NBER Working Paper No. 10402
March 2004
JEL No. E44, G12
ABSTRACT
This paper analyzes the impact of changes in monetary policy on equity prices, with the objectives
both of measuring the average reaction of the stock market and also of understanding the economic
sources of that reaction. We find that, on average, a hypothetical unanticipated 25-basis-point cut
in the federal funds rate target is associated with about a one percent increase in broad stock indexes.
Adapting a methodology due to Campbell (1991) and Campbell and Ammer (1993), we find that the
effects of unanticipated monetary policy actions on expected excess returns account for the largest
part of the response of stock prices.

Introduction
The ultimate objectives of monetary policy are expressed in terms of macroeconomic vari-
ables such as output, employment, and inßation. However, the inßuence of monetary policy
instruments on these variables is at best indirect. The most direct and immediate effects of
monetary policy actions, such as changes in the federal funds rate, are on the Þnancial mar-
kets; by affecting asset prices and returns, policymakers try to modify economic behavior
in ways that will help to achieve their ultimate objectives. Understanding the links between
monetary policy and asset prices is thus crucially important for understanding the policy
transmission mechanism.
This paper is an empirical study of the relationship between monetary policy and one
of the most important Þnancial markets, the market for equities. According to the con-
ventional wisdom, changes in monetary policy are transmitted through the stock market
via changes in the values of private portfolios (the “wealth effect”), changes in the cost of
capital, and by other mechanisms as well. Some observers also view the stock market as
an independent source of macroeconomic volatility, to which policymakers may wish to
respond. For these reasons, it will be useful to obtain quantitative estimates of the links
between monetary policy changes and stock prices. In this paper we have two principal
objectives. First, we measure and analyze in some detail the stock market’s response to
monetary policy actions, both in the aggregate and at the level of industry portfolios. Sec-
ond, we try to gain some insights into the reasons for the stock market’s response.
Estimating the response of equity prices to monetary policy actions is complicated by
the fact that the market is unlikely to respond to policy actions that were already anticipated.
Distinguishing between expected and unexpected policy actions is therefore essential for
discerning their effects. A natural way to do this is to use the technique proposed by
Kuttner (2001), which uses federal funds futures data to construct a measure of “surprise”
rate changes.1 To explain the economic reasons for the observed market response to policy
1Cochrane and Piazzesi (2002) proposed using the change in term eurodollar rates to measure policy
surprises, while Rigobon and Sack (2002) utilized the eurodollar futures rate. While these measures provide
informative gauges of interest rate expectations over a slightly longer horizon, G¨
urkaynak et al. (2002)
1


surprises requires an assessment of how those policy surprises affect expectations of future
interest rates, dividends, and excess returns. To do this, we adapt the procedure developed
by Campbell (1991) and Campbell and Ammer (1993), which uses a vector autoregression
(VAR) to calculate revisions in expectations of these key variables.
The results presented in section 2 of the paper show that the market reacts fairly strongly
to surprise funds rate changes. SpeciÞcally, for a sample consisting of the union of days
with a change in the target funds rate target and days of meetings of the Federal Open
Market Committee (FOMC), we estimate that the CRSP value-weighted index registers a
one-day gain of roughly one percent in response to a hypothetical surprise 25-basis-point
easing. The market reacts little, if at all, to the component of funds rate changes that are
anticipated by futures market participants. A comparable reaction is observed at a monthly
unit of observation.
These results are broadly consistent with those of other studies which have looked at
the link between monetary policy and the stock market. Thorbecke (1997), for example,
documented a response of stock prices to shocks from an identiÞed vector autoregression
(VAR); in a similar vein, Jensen et al. (1996) and Jensen and Mercer (1998), examined the
market’s response to discount rate changes. This paper improves on these earlier efforts by
using a measure of monetary policy based on futures data, which more cleanly isolates the
unanticipated element of policy actions. In that sense, this paper resembles the more recent
work of Rigobon and Sack (2002), who reported a signiÞcant response of the stock market
to interest rate surprises derived from eurodollar futures. That paper’s main innovation was
the use of a novel, heteroskedasticity-based estimator to correct for possible simultaneity
bias, an approach subsequently extended by Craine and Martin (2003). The analysis in this
paper takes a more conventional event-study approach, while controlling directly for certain
kinds of information jointly affecting monetary policy and stock prices. Section 2 also
includes an assessment of the results’ sensitivity to potential outliers, and an exploration
of certain kinds of asymmetries in the market’s response. Additional analysis distinguishes
showed that federal funds futures are the best predictors of target funds rate changes one to Þve months
ahead.

between policy actions that affect the expected level of future interest rates, versus those
that affect only the timing of rate changes.
Section 3 takes up the question of what explains equity prices’ response, an issue not
addressed by any of the papers cited above. The approach taken here is an adaptation of the
VAR method proposed by Campbell (1991) and Campbell and Ammer (1993). The main
Þnding is that policy’s impact on equity prices comes predominantly through its effect on
expected future excess equity returns. SpeciÞcally, we Þnd that while an unanticipated rate
cut (for example) generates an immediate rise in equity prices, it tends to be associated
with an extended period of lower-than-normal excess returns. Some effect of policy on
equity returns can be traced to revisions in cash ßow forecasts, but very little is directly
attributable to changes in expected real interest rates. One interpretation of this result is
that monetary policy surprises are associated with changes in the equity premium, a point
we discuss further below. But in the absence of a fully-developed asset pricing model, it is
impossible to distinguish this interpretation from a simple market overreaction.
Relatively few papers to date have attempted to provide an explanation for the market’s
reaction to monetary policy. One effort along these lines is that of Patelis (1997), who
also used the Campbell-Ammer framework to perform a decomposition similar to ours.
Goto and Valkanov (2000) used a somewhat different VAR-based method to focus on the
covariance between inßation and stock returns. Both relied on policy shocks derived from
identiÞed VARs, however, rather than the futures-based surprise used in our analysis. Boyd
et al. (2001) also considered the linkage between policy and stock prices. Their analysis
focused on the market’s response to employment news, rather than to monetary policy
directly, however.

The reaction of equity prices to changes in the target
federal funds rate
This section focuses on the immediate impact of monetary policy on equity prices, both for
broad stock market indices and for industry portfolios. As noted in the introduction, how-
ever, one difÞculty inherent in measuring policy’s effects is that asset markets are forward
looking and hence tend to incorporate any information about anticipated policy changes.
Some effort is therefore required to isolate the unexpected policy change which might plau-
sibly generate a market response. This does not say that asset prices respond to monetary
policy only when the Fed surprises the markets, of course. Naturally, asset prices will also
respond to revisions in expectations about future policy, which in turn may be driven by
news about changing economic conditions. Our focus on unexpected policy actions allows
us to circumvent difÞcult issues of endogeneity and simultaneity, and discern more clearly
the stock market reaction to monetary policy.
One convenient, market-based way to identify unexpected funds rate changes relies on
the price of federal funds futures contracts, which embody expectations of the effective
federal funds rate, averaged over the settlement month.2 Krueger and Kuttner (1996) found
that the federal funds futures rates yielded efÞcient forecasts of funds rate changes. Kuttner
(2001) subsequently used these futures data to estimate the response of the term structure
to monetary policy. The analysis in this section employs a similar method to gauge the
response of equity prices to unanticipated changes in the federal funds rate from 1989
through 2002.
2.1
Measuring the surprise element of policy actions
A measure of the surprise element of any speciÞc change in the federal funds target can be
derived from the change in the futures contract’s price relative to the day prior to the policy

of Trade. The implied futures rate is 100 minus the contract price.

action. For an event taking place on day d of month m, the unexpected, or “surprise” target
funds rate change can be calculated from the change in the rate implied by the current-
month futures contract. But because the contract’s settlement price is based on the monthly
average federal funds rate, the change in the implied futures rate must be scaled up by a
factor related to the number of days in the month affected by the change,
∆iu =
D
D−d

f 0
m,d −f 0
m,d−1

,
(1)
where ∆iu is the unexpected target rate change, f 0
m,d is the current-month futures rate and D
is the number of days in the month.3 The expected component of the rate change is deÞned
as the actual change minus the surprise, or
∆ie = ∆i−∆iu .
(2)
Getting the timing right is, of course, crucial for event-study analysis. Before 1994,
when the Fed instituted its current policy of announcing changes in the funds rate tar-
get, market participants generally became aware of policy actions on the day after the
FOMC’s decision, when it was implemented by the Open Market Desk. Following Rude-
busch (1995) and Hilton (1994), we assign most pre-1994 rate changes to the date of the
Desk’s implementation. As documented in Kuttner (2003), however, the sample contains
several minor deviations from this pattern. Six of these correspond to days on which the
Desk allowed the funds rate to drift downward in advance (and presumably in anticipation)
of the FOMC’s decision, with the full awareness that its inaction would be interpreted as
an easing of policy. A seventh exception occurred on December 18, 1990, when the Board
of Governors made an unusual late-afternoon announcement of a cut in the discount rate,
3Because the monthly average of the effective federal funds rate on which the contract is based is very
close to the average target rate, this method generally provides a good gauge of the surprise change in the
target federal funds rate. In order to minimize the effect of any month-end noise in the effective funds rate,
however, the unscaled change in the one-month futures rate is used to calculate the funds rate surprise when
the change falls on one of the last three days of the month. Also, when the rate change occurs on the Þrst day
of the month, f 1
m−1,D is be used instead of f 0
m,d−1. See Kuttner (2001) for details.

from which market observers (correctly) inferred a 25-basis-point rate cut.
The policy of announcing target rate changes, which began in February 1994, eliminates
virtually all of the timing ambiguity associated with rate changes in the earlier part of the
sample. Moreover, because the change in the target rate is usually announced prior to the
close of the futures market, the closing futures price generally incorporates the day’s news
about monetary policy. The only exception is October 15, 1998, when a 25-basis-point
rate cut was announced after the close of the futures markets. In this case, the difference
between the opening rate on the 16th and the closing rate on the 15th is used to calculate
the surprise.
2.2
Baseline event study results
One approach to measuring the impact of Federal Reserve policy on the stock market is to
calculate the market’s reaction to funds rate changes on the day of the change. The market
may of course also react to the lack of a change in the funds rate target, if a change had
been anticipated. Because this approach involves looking at the response to speciÞc events,
it might be described as an “event-study” style of analysis. For the purpose of this paper,
the relevant sample of events is deÞned as the union of all days when the funds rate target
was changed, and days corresponding to FOMC meetings. The Þrst “event” in the sample
is the June 1989 25-basis-point rate cut, and the last corresponds to the FOMC meeting
in December 2002. The 17 September 2001 observation is excluded from the analysis, as
that day’s rate cut occurred on the Þrst day of trading following the September 11 terrorist
attacks. Altogether, the sample contains 131 observations.
Table 1 presents a selection of descriptive statistics on the policy surprises and stock
returns in our sample.
The statistics are reported both for the pre-1994 period, when
changes in the funds rate target were generally unannounced and frequently occurred be-
tween scheduled FOMC meetings, and the post-1994 period when all rate changes were
announced, and most coincided with FOMC meetings. As measured by the standard devi-
ation, the typical funds rate surprise in both periods is roughly 10 basis points; by contrast,
6


equity prices are half again as volatile post-1994 as pre-1994. In both subsamples, equity
returns are roughly ten percent more volatile on the monetary policy “event” days than on
“non-event” days, consistent with policy actions inducing a market reaction of some kind.
Baseline estimates of the reaction of equity prices to monetary policy appear in Table 2.
The results in column (a) of the table are based on a regression of the CRSP value-weighted
return on the raw change in the federal funds rate target,
Ht = a+b∆it +εt ,
(3)
making no distinction between surprise and expected changes; Ht represents the stock re-
turn, and it is the funds rate target. The regression used for the results in column (b)
Ht = a+be∆ie
t +bu∆iu
t +εt ,
(4)
distinguishes between expected and unexpected funds rate changes, ∆ie
t and ∆iu
t , using the
decomposition described above in section 2.1.
In both speciÞcations, the error term εt represents factors other than monetary policy
that affect stock prices on event days. These factors are assumed to be orthogonal to the
changes in the federal funds rate appearing on the right-hand side of the regression. Section
2.3 below discusses the validity of this assumption in some detail, and section 2.4 presents
results that control directly for one observable source of endogeneity.
Although it has the expected negative sign, the response to the raw target rate change
reported in column (a) of Table 2.2 is small and insigniÞcant. When the target rate change
is broken down into its expected and surprise components, however, the estimated stock
market response to the latter is negative and highly signiÞcant: the results reported in col-
umn (b) imply a −4.68% one-day return in response to a one percentage point surprise rate
cut.4 The R2 indicates that 17% of the variance in equity prices on these “event” days is
associated with news about monetary policy. While Fed policy accounts for a nontrivial

7


portion of the variance of stock returns on event days, clearly it is far from the only piece
of new information affecting stock returns.
The negative relationship between funds rate surprises and stock returns is readily vis-
ible in Figure 1. Also apparent, however, are a number of observations characterized by
very large changes in equity prices — some exceeding three standard deviations in mag-
nitude. This naturally raises the question of whether the results reported in the Þrst two
columns of Table 2 are sensitive to the inclusion of these observations.
To determine which observations might have an unduly large effect on the regression
results, we computed inßuence statistics for each observation in the sample. These statis-
tics are calculated from the quadratic form ∆ˆ
b′
t ˆ
Σ−1∆ˆ
bt, where ∆ˆ
bt is change in the vector
of regression coefÞcients resulting from dropping observation t, and ˆ
Σ is the estimated co-
variance matrix of the coefÞcients. The distribution of these statistics, plotted in Figure 2,
conÞrms that six observations, all with statistics in excess of 0.3, exert an unusually large
inßuence on the estimates; the comparable statistics for the remaining observations are all
well below 0.2 and most are less than 0.05. The six observations associated with the large
inßuence statistics are labeled in Figure 1: 8 August 1991, 2 July 1992, 15 October 1998, 3
January 2001, 20 March 2001, and 18 April 2001. The Þrst two of these are associated with
events other than monetary policy actions, while the most recent four arguably represent
unusual reactions to monetary policy actions. Each is in its own way is revealing.
All three of the candidate outliers occurring during the easing cycle that began in 2001
are classiÞed as such because of their abnormally large reactions to the funds rate surprises.
The unexpected 50-basis-point intermeeting rate reductions on 3 January and 18 April were
both greeted euphorically, with one-day returns of 5.3% and 4.0% respectively. The 50-
basis-point rate cut on 20 March was received less enthusiastically, however. Even though
the cut was more or less what the futures market had been anticipating, Þnancial press
reported that many equity market participants were “disappointed” the rate cut hadn’t been
an even larger 75 basis point action. Consequently, the market lost more than 2%.
Another unusually vehement reaction to a Fed action is associated with the 25-basis-
8


point intermeeting rate cut on 15 October 1998, which was taken in response to unsettled
conditions in the Þnancial markets — speciÞcally, the deteriorating situations in Asia and
Russia. For whatever reason, the unexpected intermeeting cut lifted equities over 4%.
The stock market fell less than 0.3% on 2 July 1992. What makes this reaction unusual,
however, is the fact that it came on a day when the Fed unexpectedly cut the funds rate target
by 50 basis points. The decision to cut was no doubt inßuenced by that day’s unusually
bleak employment report, in which reported payroll employment fell by 117 thousand. This
raises the issue that some of the “surprise” rate changes in the sample may in fact represent
endogenous responses to economic news, such as the employment report. This possibility
is investigated in greater detail below in section 2.4.
The Þnal candidate outlier is 21 August 1991, when the CRSP value-weighted index
rose 2.7% on a day associated with an FOMC meeting. The futures market had apparently
priced in some possibility of a rate cut on that day, but the FOMC’s decision to leave rates
unchanged generated a small, positive surprise. The Þnancial press reported that the stock
market jump was a response to the resolution of the attempted coup in Russia — clearly an
event with no direct relation to that day’s FOMC decision.
Two additional observations are highlighted in Figure 1: 17 May and 16 August 1994.
While their relatively low inßuence statistics (0.05 and 0.04) do not qualify them as out-
liers, they stand out as unusual instances in which equities rose in spite of signiÞcant,
positive funds rate surprises. As noted in Kuttner (2001), a similarly anomalous response
is observed in the response of bond yields on those dates. The reason seems to be that both
of these larger-than-expected 50-basis-point rate hikes were accompanied by statements by
the FOMC suggesting that further rate increases were not imminent. This interpretation is
consistent with the results reported below in section 2.6 indicating that the three-month-
ahead futures rates fell on the dates in question.
Columns (c) and (d) of Table 2 show the effect of dropping the six candidate outliers
identiÞed above. (The two observations from 1994 are retained.) The estimated response
to funds rate surprises is still negative and signiÞcant, but smaller in magnitude: −2.55, as
9


opposed to −4.68. The response to the expected component is smaller (and now no longer
signiÞcant at the 0.05 level), as is the response to the raw funds rate change in column (c).
Excluding the six outliers also decreases the R-squared from 0.17 to 0.05.
2.3
Orthogonality revisited
As noted above, the event-study results reported in section 2.2 rely on the assumption
that the error term is orthogonal to funds rate changes. One reason for a violation of this
condition would be a contemporaneous response of monetary policy to the stock market.
There are, however, no clear examples of instances in which a drop in equity prices led the
FOMC to cut rates, or the inverse. Even in monthly data, evidence for such a systematic
reaction is elusive.5 Moreover, to the extent the FOMC did respond in this way, it would
tend to reduce the size of the estimated response to the funds rate surprise.
The orthogonality condition would also fail to hold if monetary policy and the stock
market both responded jointly (and contemporaneously) to new information. For exam-
ple, the release of data indicating weaker-than-expected economic growth would plausibly
cause the stock market to decline, and make a cut in the funds rate target more likely.6 As
in the case of a direct policy response to the stock market, the resulting tendency for rate
cuts to be associated with stock market declines would lead to a downward bias in the size
of policy’s estimated market impact. A similarly attenuated reaction would be observed
if surprise policy actions were thought to reveal private information about the state of the
economy.7
Instances of direct, same-day policy responses to economic news are rare in our sample
— at least in recent years, when the FOMC meeting schedule dictated the timing of most
policy actions. During the pre-1994 subsample, however, it was not uncommon for the
5See, for example, Bernanke and Gertler (1999) and Fuhrer and Tootell (2003). Some evidence to the
contrary was obtained by Rigobon and Sack (2003), however.
6The 17 September 2001 is an extreme example of just such a joint response: the Fed’s 50 basis point rate
cut and the stock market’s sharp drop were both clearly spurred by the previous week’s terrorist attacks.
7Romer and Romer (2000) suggested that such an information advantage could account for the bond
market’s response to monetary policy. However Faust et al. (2003) found little evidence to support this view.
10


FOMC to cut rates on the heels of weaker-than-expected employment data. In fact, ten
of the 23 rate cuts from June 1989 through July 1992 coincided with the release of the
employment report. The analysis in section 2.4 below addresses this issue directly by
allowing for a different market response on employment release days.
Recent studies have proposed two generic solutions to the endogeneity and joint-
response issues. One is to use intraday data in a relatively narrow “event window” sur-
rounding the FOMC’s announcement, thus distinguishing the impact of the policy change
from the effects of news arriving earlier or later in the day.
Applying this approach,
G¨
urkaynak et al. (2004) reported, in work subsequent to ours, an equity price response
that was virtually identical to that obtained from daily data. (Using intraday data did, how-
ever, result in a considerable improvement in the R2.) Also in subsequent work, D’Amico
and Farka (2003) uncovered a similar reaction using an approach incorporating intraday
data in a VAR speciÞcation.
The other generic solution is more statistical in nature. Rigobon and Sack (2002),
for example, used an estimator which, by exploiting the heteroskedasticity introduced by
exogenous monetary policy actions, yields consistent estimates of the market’s response.
In a related approach, Craine and Martin (2003) developed a multivariate factor model that
allows all asset prices to respond to common, unobserved information shocks. In the end,
however, both studies report results that are very close to those obtained from event-study
methods.
A correlation between the error term and the regressors in (4) could also arise if the
regressors were measured with error. This possibility was explored by Poole et al. (2002)
in the context of Treasury yields’ response to monetary policy. They assumed the measure-
ment error in the funds rate surprise was uncorrelated with other factors affecting yields,
turning it into a classical errors-in-variables problem. To gauge the size of the measurement
error, Poole et al. calculated the variance of the futures rate on days when the actual funds
rate change was in line with the consensus market expectations reported by the Wall Street
Journal; using this estimate, they found the attenuation in the bond market’s response was
11


typically on the order of Þve to ten percent.
Overall, the alternative econometric methods that have been used to correct for mismea-
surement of the funds rate surprises uniformly yield results similar to those relying on the
event-study methodology used in section 2.2. Moreover, to the extent that the event-study
results are biased, that bias tends to understate the true response to monetary policy. Thus,
it seems safe to proceed using the event-study approach, bearing in mind that it may yield
slightly conservative estimates of the stock market’s reaction to monetary policy.
2.4
Employment releases and subsample stability
This section investigates the robustness of the results reported in section 2.2 along two di-
mensions. One issue has to do with the joint response of monetary policy and the stock
market to economic news. As noted above, ten funds rate cuts in the pre-1994 part of the
sample occurred on the same day as the employment report. After 1994, with rate changes
more or less dictated by the exogenous scheduling of FOMC meetings, this becomes less of
an issue. As is evident in Figure 1, these observations are characterized by little, if any, cor-
relation between the funds rate surprise and the stock return. In these instances, the “good
news” for the stock market represented by the Fed’s actions seems to have been almost
exactly offset by the “bad news” about economic activity contained in the employment
report.
Another issue concerns the stability of the estimated relationship. The avoidance of
a same-day response to employment reports (and other economic news) is one possible
reason the relationship might have changed in the early 1990s. The FOMC’s practice of
explicitly announcing rate changes, which began in February 1994, may also have altered
the stock market’s response to monetary policy.
To explore the possibility of different responses either post- 1994, or on days associated
with employment releases, we interact the surprise rate change with dummy variables: one
equal to 1 starting with the 4 February 1994 observation, and another equal to 1 on the
days of pre-1994 employment releases. Table 3 reports the response of the CRSP value-
12


weighted index to surprise rate changes in the presence of these interactive dummies. Like
Table 2, columns (a) and (b) give the results for the full sample, and columns (c) and (d)
give the results for the sample excluding the six candidate outliers identiÞed above.
At Þrst glance, the results in column (a) appear to show that the entire equity price
response can be traced to the post-1994 period. The coefÞcient on the surprise itself is
only −1.25 and insigniÞcant; that on the surprise interacted with the post-1994 dummy is a
highly signiÞcant −6.87. This conclusion would be premature, however, as this regression
neglects the possibility of endogeneity in the policy response prior to 1994. Including the
surprise interacted with the employment release dummy as in column (b), increases the
magnitude of the surprise response, and the positive interaction term implies a near-zero
response to policy when it coincides with an employment release. These coefÞcients are
statistically signiÞcant at only the 0.10 level however, and the post-1994 interaction term
remains large and highly signiÞcant.
The signiÞcance of the post-1994 term is heavily inßuenced by the six outliers identi-
Þed above, however. With those observations excluded, as in column (c), post-1994 rate
surprises have only a slightly larger effect, and the difference is not statistically signiÞcant.
The coefÞcient on the surprise itself −2.29, and signiÞcant at the 0.05 level. But when
the employment interaction term is included, the surprise coefÞcient grows to −3.57. This
effect is almost exactly offset for employment release days by the 3.33 coefÞcient on the
interaction term. Both are now highly signiÞcant, and the post-1994 dummy remains in-
signiÞcant. Thus, if the six candidate outliers are discarded as unrepresentative, there is no
evidence of a break in 1994. Furthermore, the results conÞrm that the endogeneity problem
discussed above reduces the OLS estimates of the market’s response to policy surprises.
2.5
Asymmetries
Another set of questions concerns asymmetries, broadly deÞned: the possibility that the
equity price response to monetary policy depends on the direction of the action, or on the
context in which it occurred. As above in section 2.4, interactive dummy variables are used
13


in the regression to investigate these questions.
One possibility is that the magnitude of the market’s response depends the sign of the
surprise. To allow for this, a dummy variable was set to 1 for those 37 observations with
positive surprises. An interaction term involving this dummy and the surprise rate change
was then included in the regression. The interactive term involving the employment release
is also included, in order to pick up the smaller impact of funds rate surprises on employ-
ment release days. As above, the regressions are run with and without the six candidate
outliers identiÞed earlier. The results reported in Table 4 provide weak support at best for
this form of asymmetry. For the full sample, in column (a) of the table, the coefÞcient on
the interaction term indicates a smaller effect of positive surprises, but the difference is not
statistically signiÞcant. There is virtually no difference for the no-outlier sample, shown in
column (d).
A related kind of asymmetry can be modeled by including interactive dummies for rate
changes associated with increases in the funds rate, and with surprises associated with no
change in the funds rate. The full sample contains 14 observations of the former, and 76 of
the latter. The results of this exercise appear in columns (b) and (e) of the table for the full
and no-outlier samples. Again, the statistically insigniÞcant coefÞcient in the rate increase
interaction variable suggests the direction of movement is not an important determinant
of the market’s reaction. The positive and statistically signiÞcant estimated coefÞcient on
the “no change” interaction variable does, however, indicate that the market responds very
little, if at all, to policy “inactions.” This presumably means that the failure to move at any
speciÞc FOMC meeting may be viewed largely as postponing the inevitable.
A third sort of asymmetry has to do with the context of the rate decision: whether it
was taken at an FOMC meeting (109 observations), or represented a change in the direc-
tion of short-term interest rates (Þve observations). Interaction terms involving suitably-
constructed dummy variables are again used to capture possible differences in the market’s
response. The sign of the FOMC interaction term is unclear a priori. Decisions taken at
FOMC meetings may be less subject to the sort of endogeneity issues discussed above,
14


which would tend to increase the impact of rate changes on these days. On the other hand,
intermeeting changes (at least those not associated with employment reports) may convey
an urgency on the part of the FOMC which would tend to increase the size of the response.
To the extent that interest rate reversals have a larger impact on expected future interest rates
than other rate changes, these changes in the target federal funds rate would be expected to
elicit a larger stock market response.
Columns (c) and (f) of Table 4 show the results from a regression that includes the
FOMC and reversal interaction terms, along with employment report and post-1994 re-
gressors. The coefÞcient on the surprise term remains an economically and statistically
signiÞcant −3.97 for the full sample, and −3.67 for the no-outlier sample. In the full sam-
ple, the measured response is smaller on FOMC days; this difference disappears, however,
when the candidate outliers are excluded. Reversals seem to have a large additional impact
on the stock market: −6.33 for the full sample, and −17.62 for the no-outlier sample. In
the latter case, the implausibly large estimate is driven almost entirely by the single obser-
vation in the southeast corner of Figure 1, corresponding to the Þrst rate increase in 1994.
Clearly, reversals in the direction of rate changes have occasionally been met with extreme
market reactions, which accounts for the exaggerated response. With only Þve observations
in the sample, however, inference on the additional stock market impact of reversals is haz-
ardous at best. “Dummying out” these observations at least provides further conÞrmation
that the baseline results are not dependent on the inclusion of these events.
Taken together, the results presented above conÞrm the existence of a strong one-day
reaction of the stock market to unanticipated changes in federal funds rate. Just how strong
this response is depends on whether the handful of potentially anomalous observations are
viewed as representative, or discarded as outliers. The estimated response is stable over
time, once the tendency for the FOMC to react to employment news in the early part of the
sample is controlled for. The estimated reaction does, however, appear to be smaller (or
nonexistent) for policy surprises associated with no change in the funds rate target.
15


2.6
Timing versus level surprises
While the results presented above are consistent with a strong response of equity returns to
funds rate surprises, that response is anything but uniform. In some cases, the reaction is
muted, while in others the reaction seems out of proportion with the size of the measured
surprise. One explanation for the lack of uniformity is that funds rate surprises differ in
their impact on expected future short-term interest rates. Many of the surprises in the
sample may have been interpreted as an advancement or postponement of a more-or-less
inevitable change in policy, while others were viewed as altering the expected path of the
funds rate for months to come. Surprises with a more durable on policy expectations would
naturally tend to have a larger effect on equity prices than those which merely altered the
timing of policy actions.
One way to gauge policy surprises’ impact on expected future short-term rates is to
examine the relationship between the surprises and the change in the fed funds futures
rates in subsequent months. This relationship is depicted in Figure 3, which plots the
change in the three-month-ahead futures rate against the funds rate surprise for the 131
observations in our June 1989 through December 2002 sample. The 45 degree line in the
Þgure corresponds to a one-for-one response of the three-month futures rate to the current
month funds rate surprise. Observations lying along a shallower line (i.e., those below the
45 degree line in the northeast quadrant and above in the southwest quadrant) are therefore
those associated with a less than one-for-one effect on three-month-ahead expectations;
those lying along a steeper line had a greater-than one-for-one effect. As noted above, the
announcements accompanying the two rate hikes in May and August 1994 actually lowered
three-month-ahead interest rate expectations, and as a result those two observations fall in
the southeast quadrant.
Regressing the change in the three-month-ahead futures rate on the policy surprise
yields an estimated slope coefÞcient of 0.65, as shown in column (a) of Table 5. This
suggests the impact of policy surprises on expectations is typically much less than one-for-
one; the difference is signiÞcant at the 0.01 level. A plausible interpretation of this result
16


is that many of the unexpected funds rate changes in the sample are to a large extent sur-
prises only with regard to the timing of policy actions. As shown in columns (b) through
(d), FOMC meetings and “no change” surprises tend to be associated with an even smaller
response of expectations.
In order to determine the extent to which differences in policy surprises’ impact on ex-
pectations can help explain the stock market’s response, our approach is to deÞne a variable
reßecting the difference between the surprises’ effects on current and three-month-ahead
interest rate expectations, and include this term in the equity return regressions. SpeciÞ-
cally, our “timing surprise” variable is deÞned as the difference between the change in the
three-month-ahead futures rate and the current funds rate surprise, i.e., the vertical distance
from each observation to the 45 degree line in Figure 3. The timing surprise for an action
with equal effects on current and expected future interest rates would thus be zero; those
with a smaller effect on expected future interest rates would be negative. Results from the
stock return regressions that include the timing surprise term appear in Table 6.
For comparison purposes, columns (a) and (c) of the table simply reproduce the baseline
results reported earlier in Table 2, with and without the six candidate outliers. Columns
(b) and (d) report the regression results when the timing surprise term is added to the
regression. The inclusion of this term increases the magnitude of the coefÞcient on the
current-month surprise, which goes from −4.68 to −6.20 for the full sample. Because
this coefÞcient can now be interpreted as the impact of a funds rate surprise that changes
expectations by the same amount (i.e., with the timing surprise equal to zero), this implies
a larger stock price response to those policy surprises that affect the level of interest rates
expected to prevail three months hence.
Similarly, the statistically signiÞcant, negative coefÞcient on the timing surprise term
says that surprises with a less-than one-for-one impact on expectations (i.e., those for which
the change in the three-month futures rate is smaller than the current-month surprise) have
a correspondingly smaller effect on stock prices. In the extreme case of a “pure” timing
surprise with no effect on the expected level of rates, the response is given by the difference
17


between the two coefÞcients: −1.91 for the full and 0.09 for the no-outlier sample. (Neither
is statistically signiÞcant at even the 0.10 level.) The results therefore show that policy
actions affect stock returns only to the extent that they alter the expected level of rates in
the months ahead.
2.7
Results based on monthly data
An alternative way to deÞne the policy surprise is to focus on the expected change in
policy at a regular, monthly horizon. Unlike the event study approach, the regular timing
is amenable to the time series analysis employed below in section 3 to assess the causes of
the market’s response. It is worth noting that in this approach, any month could potentially
contain a surprise policy action, and that a failure to change the funds rate target in any
month could represent a policy surprise. Consequently, the monthly time-series approach
is less susceptible to any sample selection issues that might arise in the context of the
event-study methodology.
The use of monthly data calls for a slightly different gauge of unanticipated policy
actions. Since the price of the federal funds futures contract is based on the monthly average
federal funds rate, a natural deÞnition of the month-t surprise would be

day of month t −1. (The notation ¯
∆is used to distinguish this from the conventionally-
deÞned Þrst difference operator.)
This deÞnition of the funds rate surprise raises a time aggregation issue. Measuring
the surprise in terms of the average funds rate will tend to attenuate the size of the policy
surprises, as discussed in detail in Evans and Kuttner (1998). Unfortunately, without mak-
ing speciÞc assumptions about the days of possible rate changes, there is no clean way to
correct for this problem.9 Consequently, some caution is required when interpreting the
magnitude of the surprises measured in this way. It is also important to note that the endo-
geneity issue discussed above in section 2.4 is almost certainly going to be more relevant
to monthly funds rate surprises than it was for the day-ahead surprises. Rate changes that
were unanticipated as of the end of the prior month may well include a systematic response
to economic news, such as employment, output and inßation.
The results shown in Table 7 support the view that the month-ahead surprises incorpo-
rate an endogenous reaction to economic developments. The table reports the parameter
estimates and R2 from a regression of the monthly policy surprises on the surprise element
of key economic reports, calculated as the difference between the number released and the
consensus expectation for that number, compiled by Money Market Services.10 Over the
full May 1989 through December 2002 sample, there appears to be a signiÞcant within-
month impact of several data releases on the funds rate target: nonfarm payrolls, industrial
production, retail sales, and core PPI, although these latter two have the “wrong” (i.e.,
negative) sign.
This relationship seems to be much stronger in the early part of the sample, however.
The second column of the table shows the results for the same regression estimated from
May 1989 through September 1992 (the date of the last rate cut associated with an em-
ployment report). The Fed’s reaction to bad payroll employment news is now particularly
pronounced. Moreover, the regression accounts for nearly half of the variance of the funds
9One solution would have been to assume that post-1994 rate changes were always expected to occur
at scheduled FOMC meetings. The three intermeeting rate cuts in 2001 have made this assumption less
plausible, however.

rate surprises. By contrast, in the more recent February 1994 through December 2002
subsample, there is very little evidence of a within-month reaction to economic news, as
shown in the third column of the table. Only retail sales is signiÞcant, and the regression
now accounts for a much smaller share of the variance of funds rate surprises.11

Column (a) reports the estimates for the full sample, consisting of all 164 months from
May 1989 through December 2002. As in the earlier results, there is a strong, statistically
signiÞcant negative response to unanticipated rate increases, and little or no response to the
anticipated actions. The ¯
R2 indicates that nearly 7% of the monthly stock return variance
can be traced to unanticipated policy actions.
It is interesting to note that the magnitude of the response, −11.43, is about twice that
found in the event-study analysis. This difference in magnitudes is readily explained by
the time aggregation issue alluded to earlier. In fact, if funds rate changes on average take
place in the middle of the month (for example, if rate changes were distributed uniformly
over the days of the month), then the magnitude of the estimated monthly surprises will be
attenuated by one-half, which would explain the doubling of the estimated response of the
stock price.
The negative relationship between policy surprises and stock returns is also evident in
the scatterplot of the data in Figure 4. As in the daily data, a number of observations stand
out as potential outliers, again raising the question of whether the results are sensitive to
their inclusion. As above, inßuence statistics were calculated for each observation in the
sample; those with statistics in excess of 1.5 are ßagged as outliers in the plot. (The most
11Again, retail sales is signiÞcant with the “wrong” sign. But this result is due entirely to an anomalous

funds rate target.

conspicuous of these is the data point deep in the southwest quadrant, which corresponds
to September 2001.) Dropping these ten observations makes little difference to the results,
however. In fact, as shown in column (b) of Table 8, the estimated coefÞcient of −14.26 is
somewhat larger than it is for the full sample, and the ¯
R2 rises to 0.096.
The monthly data contain very little evidence for the sorts of asymmetries uncovered in
the daily data. As shown in columns (c) and (d), there is no indication that the stock price
response depends on the sign of the surprise, or on the direction of the rate change. Nor is
there any evidence of a different response to policy reversals, or to the MMS employment
surprises.12
We have so far focused on the responses of broad equity indexes, but of course it is also
possible to examine the responses of more disaggregated indexes. Table 9 reports estimates
of (7) for the ten industry portfolios constructed from CRSP returns as in Fama and French
(1988).13 The most responsive industries are high tech and telecommunications, with co-
efÞcients half again as large that for the overall value-weighted index. On the other end of
the spectrum, energy and utilities are only half as responsive as the overall market, and the
relevant coefÞcients are statistically insigniÞcant.14 The low R2s indicate that very little
of those industries’ variance is associated with unexpected policy actions. The estimates’
precision is, however, not sufÞcient to reject the hypothesis of an equal reaction for all 10
industries.
A natural question is the degree to which the pattern of responses of industry portfolios
is consistent with the implications of the CAPM — that is, whether the observed responses
are proportional to the industries’ market “betas”. A straightforward way to address this
question is to obtain industry betas from a regression of the excess return in industry i, yi,t,
12Interestingly, the employment surprise is negative and signiÞcant in a univariate regression (not reported),
but becomes insigniÞcant once the federal funds surprise is included. This is consistent with the Þndings of
Boyd et al. (2001), and corroborates their conjecture that the policy response accounts for equities’ perverse
response.
13The Fama-French portfolio data are available from mba.tuck.dartmouth.edu/pages/faculty/ken.french.

not seem to depend on Þrm capitalization.

(8)
estimated on the same May 1989 to December 2002 sample used to estimate the response
to monetary policy.15 The industry response implied by the CAPM can then be expressed
as:
ˆ

i = ˆ
βi × ˆ

(9)
where ˆ
bu is the estimated response of the CRSP value-weighted excess return to funds rate
surprises.
Figure 5 plots these Þtted responses to monetary policy against the estimated responses,
ˆ
bu
i , reported in Table 9, along with the 80% conÞdence intervals associated with those esti-
mates. Also plotted is the 45-degree line that the points would lie on if the CAPM perfectly
accounted for variation across industries. Although the Þt is not perfect, the points line up
reasonably well along the 45-degree line, suggesting that the one-factor CAPM does a good
job of explaining the observed industry variation. High-tech’s measured sensitivity to mon-
etary policy is in fact somewhat less than its beta would imply, while telecommunications’
is somewhat greater. On the other end of the spectrum, the utilities and energy industries’
low market betas for the most part account for their muted response to monetary policy.
The CAPM-implied response represented by the 45-degree lies within the conÞdence in-
tervals associated with the estimated responses, although given the imprecision of those
estimates, this is clearly not a powerful test.
15Using betas based on the sum of contemporaneous and lagged market covariances, as in Campbell and
Vuolteenaho (2003), makes virtually no difference to the results. Campbell and Vulteenhaho’s proposed
two-factor decomposition also yields very similar results to those reported in the text.

3
Policy, fundamentals and stock prices
Having documented the reaction of equity returns to Federal Reserve policy in section 2
above, we now turn to the more difÞcult question of what explains the observed reaction.
There are three broad reasons why an unexpected funds rate increase may lead to a decline
in stock prices: it may be associated with a decrease in expected future dividends, a rise in
the future expected real interest rates used to discount those dividends, or an increase in the
expected excess returns (i.e., the equity premiums) associated with holding stocks. Simple
regressions of equity returns on surprise changes in the federal funds rate are silent on the
question, so a more structured approach is required to disentangle the various effects.
The approach of this paper is an adaptation of the method used by Campbell (1991),
and Campbell and Ammer (1993). In brief, their method uses a log-linear approximation to
decompose excess equity returns into components attributable to news about real interest
rates, dividends, and future excess returns, then employs a VAR methodology to obtain
proxies for the relevant expectations.16 We take the Campbell-Ammer framework one
step further, however, by relating the proxies for expectations to the news about the path
of monetary policy embodied in the surprises derived from federal funds futures. This
allows us to estimate the impact of federal funds surprises on expected future dividends,
real interest rates, and expected future excess returns. It turns out that the largest effects
come from revisions to expectations of future excess returns, and to expectations of future
dividends. Real interest rates have a very small direct impact.
The object of this analysis is the (log) excess return on equities, denoted yt+1. This
is deÞned as the total return on equities (price change plus dividends), minus the risk-free
rate (the one-month Treasury bill yield). The return dated t + 1 is measured over period
t, i.e., from the beginning of period t to the beginning of period t + 1. Let ey
t+1 represent
the unexpected (relative to expectations formed at the beginning of period t) excess return
during period t, i.e., yt+1 −Etyt+1.
16Because VARs require periodic time series data, the subsequent analysis will use the monthly measure
of the funds rate surprises.
23


Using the linearization developed by Campbell and Shiller (1988), we can express the
period t unexpected excess return on equity in terms of the revision the expectation of
discounted future dividends, the real interest rate, and future excess returns. (A sketch of
the derivation can be found in the appendix.) The decomposition can be written as:
ey
t+1 = ˜
ed
t+1 −˜
er
t+1 −˜
ey
t+1
(10)
where the es represent the revision in expectations between periods t and t +1, and the tilde
denotes a discounted sum, so that

∑

ρ jyt+1+j .
The discount factor ρ, which comes out of the linearization, represents the steady-state ratio
of the equity price to the price plus dividend; following Campbell and Ammer (1993), this
is set to 0.9962. As emphasized by Campbell (1991), (10) is really nothing more than a
dynamic accounting identity relating the current excess return to revisions in expectations.
As such, it contains no real economic content, much less any speciÞc asset pricing model;
such a model would be required to provide a link between the conditional expectations of
future returns and economic variables (e.g., consumption).
Implementing this decomposition requires empirical proxies for the expectations ap-
pearing in (10). The approach of Campbell (1991) and Campbell and Ammer (1993) is to
model expectations using a Vector Autoregression (VAR) involving the variables of inter-
est (excess returns and the real interest rate) along with any other indicators that might be
helpful in forecasting those variables. Calculating the discounted sum of the revisions in
expectations is straightforward; to do so involves writing the n variable, p lag VAR as a
24


Þrst-order system,
zt+1 = Azt +wt+1 ,
(12)
where zt+1 is an appropriately stacked np × 1 vector containing the excess equity return,
the real interest rate, and any additional indicators. With the VAR expressed in this form,
the ingredients of (10) are given by
ey

sywt+1 ,

˜
ed
t+1
=
ey
t+1 + ˜
ey
t+1 −˜
er
t+1 ,
where sy and sr are appropriate 1×np selection matrices.
Two features of the Campbell-Ammer method deserve further comment. One is its
parametric approach to constructing long-horizon expectations of stock returns: one has
to assume that the dynamics of equity returns many years in the future are adequately
captured by a parsimonious VAR model. To a large extent, this parametric approach is
forced upon us, as the relatively short experience with federal funds futures is not sufÞcient
to directly estimate the long-horizon impact on stock asset returns, particularly in light of
the questionable small-sample properties of long-horizon regressions (see Nelson and Kim
(1993)). But as discussed below, the use of the VAR does allow us to estimate the dynamics
of stock returns over a longer sample than the period for which futures data are available.
A second important feature of the approach is that dividends are not included explicitly
as a variable to be forecast; given ey
t+1, ˜
ey
t+1 and er
t+1, ed
t+1 is backed out from (10). In
principle, it would be possible to forecast dividends directly in the VAR, and instead back
out an implied ˜
ey
t+1. In practice, however, this is complicated by a strong seasonal pattern,
and a root near unity in the dividend process. It is important to note that to the extent that the
VAR understates the predictability of excess returns, treating dividends as a residual means
25


that the method will end up attributing too much of the return volatility to dividends.17
3.1
The forecasting VAR
The Þrst step is to set up a VAR to capture the dynamic correlations between the excess
equity return and the real interest rate (calculated as the one-month bill yield minus the log
difference in the non-seasonally-adjusted CPI). The VAR must therefore include these two
variables at a minimum, plus whatever other variables that might be useful in forecasting
them. (One important constraint, of course, is that these variables are available in real
time.) We follow Campbell and Ammer (1993) in using a six-variable one-lag system
that included, besides the real rate and equity return: the relative bill rate (deÞned as the
three-month bill rate minus its 12-month lagged moving average), the change in the bill
rate, the (smoothed) dividend price ratio, and the spread between the 10-year and one-
month Treasury yields. For comparability with the Campbell-Ammer (1993) results, we
use January 1973 as the starting date for estimation.
3.2
A variance decomposition of equity returns
Equation (10) expresses the current month’s excess equity returns into three components,
which may be correlated with one another. The variance of the current excess return can
therefore be broken down into the sum of the three variances, plus (or minus) the relevant
three covariances,
Var(ey
t+1)
=
Var(˜
ed
t+1)+Var(˜
er
t+1)+Var(˜
ey
t+1)−

(14)
giving a sense of the relative contributions of news about real interest rates, dividends, and
expected future excess returns to ßuctuations in the current excess return. The results of this

with the observed behavior of dividends. Such a comparison is beyond the scope of the present paper,

decomposition appear in Table 10. For comparison, the table displays results for the full
1973–2002 sample and for the subsample beginning in May 1989, when the federal funds
futures data became available. The columns labeled “total” show the total contribution,
and those labeled “share” expresses that contribution as a percentage of the excess return
variance, i.e., normalizing by Var(ey
t+1).
The results for the full 1973–2002 sample are similar to those reported by Campbell
and Ammer (1993) for their 1973–87 sample. In particular, the variance in expected future
excess returns accounts for the majority of the variance of the current equity return: 76%,
compared with Campbell and Ammer’s 101%. Dividends make a correspondingly larger
contribution of 24.5%, as opposed to Campbell and Ammer’s 14%. In both cases, the con-
tribution of the real interest rate is negligible (0.3% and 3% respectively) and statistically
insigniÞcant.
The 1989–2002 subsample yields somewhat different results, as shown in the right-hand
portion of the table. Considerably less variance is attributed to revisions in expectations of
future excess returns, and the dividend component now plays a somewhat larger role. The
main reason for this seems to be a decline in the forecastability of equity returns in recent
years, consistent with the observed fall in the adjusted R-squared from 0.04 to basically
zero. With returns less forecastable, the Campbell-Ammer methodology by default assigns
more of the excess return variance to dividend news.
3.3
The effects of federal funds surprises
The most straightforward way to analyze the impact of monetary policy within the frame-
work introduced above is to include the federal funds surprises in the VAR as an exogenous
variable
zt+1 = Azt +φ¯
∆iu
t+1 +w⊥
t+1
(15)
where φ is an n × 1 vector capturing the contemporaneous response of the elements of
zt+1 to the unanticipated rate change period t + 1.
The new disturbance term w⊥
t+1 is
27


by construction orthogonal to the funds rate surprise. This effectively breaks the VAR’s
one-month-ahead forecast error into a component having to do with news about monetary
policy, φ ¯
∆iu
t+1 and a component incorporating information about things other than policy.
Because ∆iu
t+1 represents a prediction error from a rational forecast made at time t, it
should be orthogonal to zt.18 Consistent estimates of both A and φ can therefore be obtained
by Þrst estimating the VAR’s parameters, and then regressing the VAR’s one-step-ahead
forecast errors on the funds rate surprises. Normally, there would be no advantage to the
two-step procedure over simply estimating (15) directly. But in our case, using the two-step
procedure allows us to estimate the VAR dynamics (i.e., the coefÞcients in the A matrix)
over a sample longer than the period for which federal funds futures are available.19 The
longer sample will of course tend to improve the estimates’ precision.
3.3.1
The dynamic response to funds rate surprises
Incorporating the federal funds surprises into the VAR in this way allows us to do two
things. First, because it extracts an orthogonal element from the wt forecast error, we can
use it to calculate the dynamic responses of the variables in the VAR to the orthogonal
component. The k-month response to a one-percentage-point surprise increase in the funds
rate can be calculated quite simply as Akφ.
An obvious question to arise at this point concerns the relationship between these
futures-based funds rate surprises and the more familiar monetary policy shocks derived
from an identiÞed VAR. The methods used to construct the one-month-ahead funds rate
forecasts differ, of course, with one using the futures market’s implicit forecast, and the
other using a reduced-form econometric model. Forecast methodologies aside, however,
the orthogonalization procedure described above is conceptually equivalent to ordering the
federal funds rate Þrst in a VAR system. Since this precludes any contemporaneous re-
18Krueger and Kuttner (1996) showed that in practice, the federal funds futures prediction errors are gen-
erally uncorrelated with lagged information.
19Faust et al. (2002) used a similar procedure. SpeciÞcally, they estimate the VAR parameters over the full
sample, but choose an orthogonalization based on the response of interest rates over the post-1989 subsample.
28


action of the funds rate to economic news, the surprises calculated in this way may well
incorporate an endogenous policy response to information arriving within the month. Con-
sequently, the impulse responses may represent the effects of things other than monetary
policy per se.
One way to minimize this problem would be to purge the futures-based funds rate sur-
prises of any contemporaneous response to the economy by projecting them onto the rele-
vant information variables, such as the data news obtained from the MMS survey. Alterna-
tively, since the results above in section 2.7 indicate there has been little, if any, correlation
between the funds rate surprises and data news since 1994, the φ estimated only on the
post-1994 subsample should be relatively free from this endogeneity problem. This is the
approach taken in the results presented below.
The upper-left-hand panel of Figure 6 displays the dynamic response of excess returns
calculated in this way. The initial decline of 11.6% (not shown, because of the difference
in scale) is followed by another month of negative returns, and then by several months of
near-zero excess returns.20 After six months, equities begin to exhibit small positive excess
returns, peaking at 0.16% per month (1.9% at an annual rate), and continuing for a period
measured in years.
The contractionary funds rate surprise also leads to a sizable increase in the relative bill
rate, which persists several months (essentially by construction). The real T-bill rate rises
sharply at Þrst, but the increase is relatively short-lived, and all but disappears after four
months. In the near term, the dynamics of equity excess returns are dominated by the effects
of rising interest rates. But as these effects die out, the long-run effect of the dividend-price
ratio, which rises as a result of the fall in equity prices, reasserts itself. This leads to the
highly persistent, positive excess returns visible in the impulse response function.
20This 11.6% response differs slightly from the results in section 2.7 because the dependent variable is the
forecast error in the log excess return, rather than the raw nominal return.
29


3.3.2
Explaining the stock market’s reaction to Fed policy
The second thing this approach allows us to do is calculate the impact of the federal funds
surprises on the discounted sums of expected future excess returns, interest rates, and div-
idends. And since it is these sums that are related to the current excess return through
(10), this provides a natural way to determine the source (or sources) of the stock market’s
reaction to monetary policy.
One way to assess policy’s effect on these discounted sums is simply to use the VAR to
calculate ˜
ed
t+1, ˜
er
t+1, and ˜
ey
t+1, which represent the revisions in expectations of the relevant
present values, and regress these variables in turn on ∆iu
t+1. Although this would provide
the answer we are after, the standard errors would be misleading, as they would fail to take
into account the dependence of the ˜
es on the estimated parameters of the VAR.
An alternative way to do the same calculation is to write out the ˜
es in terms of the VAR
coefÞcients. Taking ˜
ey
t+1 as an example:
˜
ey
t+1
=
syρA(1−ρA)−1wt+1 or
=
syρA(1−ρA)−1(φ¯
∆iu
t+1 +w⊥
t+1) .
(16)
The response of the present value of expected future excess returns to the federal fundsrate
surprise is just
syρA(1−ρA)−1φ .
(17)
Thus, the response of expected future excess returns depends not only on the φ vector, but
also on the VAR dynamics represented by A. Similarly, the response of the present value
of current and expected future real returns is
sr(1−ρA)−1φ ,
(18)
30


and the implied response of the present value of current and expected future dividends is
syφ+syρA(1−ρA)−1φ+sr(1−ρA)−1φ
(19)
or alternatively
(sy +sr)(1−ρA)−1φ .
(20)
The standard errors for these responses are calculated using the delta method, as in Camp-
bell and Ammer (1993).
The results of these calculations appear in Table 11. With the VAR estimated over the
entire 1973–2002 sample, funds rate surprises have a large, marginally signiÞcant impact
on the discounted sum of future excess returns, accounting for just over half of the contem-
poraneous response excess returns, equal to −11.55. The reason for this large contribution
is readily understood in terms of the impulse responses plotted in Figure 6. Though small,
funds rate shocks are estimated to have a highly persistent positive effect on excess returns.
Discounting these future positive excess returns back using a discount factor near unity
yields a large negative impact on the current excess return. The −4.82 impact of funds
rate surprises on dividends is nearly as large as that of future excess returns, and it too is
signiÞcant at the 0.10 level. The impact on the discounted sum of real rates is very small,
however, accounting for less than one percentage point of the excess return response.
The results are qualitatively similar when the VAR is estimated over the shorter 1989–
2000 sample. The only noteworthy difference is the smaller impact on expected future
excess returns, which now account for a statistically insigniÞcant 3.29 percentage points of
the −11.01% response. The reason for this can be traced to the smaller amount of long-
run forecastability in excess returns in the post-1989 sample. In fact, the impulse response
functions from this truncated sample (not shown) are nearly identical to those for the full
1973–2002 sample, shown above. The main difference is that the response of the excess
return is negligible after six months or so, and it is this difference that accounts for the
smaller contribution of future excess returns.

Conclusions
This study has documented a relatively strong and consistent response of the stock market
to unexpected monetary policy actions, using federal funds futures data to gauge policy
expectations. For broad stock market gauges like the CRSP value-weighted index, an un-
expected 25-basis-point rate cut would typically lead to an increase in stock prices on the
order of one percent. The result is robust to the exclusion of outliers and to the choice of
windows for measuring the stock market’s response. There is some evidence of a larger
market response to policy changes that are perceived to be relatively more permanent, and
a smaller response to unexpected inaction on the part of the FOMC. We also Þnd that re-
actions to monetary policy surprises tend to differ across industry-based portfolios, with
the high-tech and telecommunications sectors exhibiting a response half again as large as
that of the broad market indices. Other sectors, such as energy and utilities, seem not to
be signiÞcantly affected by monetary policy. The industry responses to monetary policy
changes seem broadly consistent with the predictions of the standard CAPM.
Although we have found an effect of monetary policy on the stock market of reasonable
size, we should emphasize that monetary policy surprises are responsible for only a small
portion of the overall variability of stock prices. Our method also does not allow us to
determine the role played by anticipated monetary policy in stock price determination.
Stocks are claims to real assets, so if monetary neutrality holds stock values should be
independent of monetary policy in the very long run. In the medium term, however, real
and nominal volatility induced by the form of the monetary policy rule may well inßuence
stock values.
A more difÞcult question is why stock prices respond as they do to monetary policy.
We have tried to make progress on this question by asking whether monetary policy af-
fects stock values through its effects on real interest rates, expected future dividends, or
expected future stock returns. The results presented in this paper showed, perhaps surpris-
ingly, that the reaction of equity prices to monetary policy is, for the most part, not directly
attributable to policy’s effects on the real interest rate. This Þnding is the result of the
32


relatively transitory movements in real interest rates induced by surprise policy actions. In-
stead, the impact of monetary policy surprises on stock prices seems to come either through
its effects on expected future excess returns or on expected future dividends. (The exact
breakdown between these two channels depends somewhat on the choice of sample, which
appears to affect the long-horizon forecastability of excess returns.)
Economically, how should we interpret the result that monetary policy affects stock
prices in signiÞcant part by affecting expected excess returns? Taken literally, this result
suggests that tight money (for example) lowers stock prices by raising the expected equity
premium. This could come about in at least two ways. First, tight money could increase
the riskiness of stocks directly, for example, by raising the interest costs or weakening the
balance sheets of publicly owned Þrms. Second, tight money could reduce the willingness
of stock investors to bear risk, for example by reducing expected levels of consumption,
as in Campbell and Cochrane (1999), or because of its association with higher inßation,
as in Brandt and Wang (2003). These linkages open up the possibility of new ways in
which monetary policy may affect real activity — for example, by affecting the level of
precautionary saving.
An alternative interpretation of our results is that the large movements in excess returns
associated with monetary policy changes reßect excess sensitivity or overreaction of stock
prices to policy actions. A more tightly structured analysis that encompasses a wider class
of assets may help to differentiate these interpretations. In any case, further exploration of
the link between monetary policy and the excess return on equities is an intriguing topic
for future research.

Appendix: deriving equation 10
This appendix provides a brief sketch of the derivation of the log-linearized relationship
between the current excess return, expected future excess returns, dividend growth, and real
interest rates given in (10). The derivation roughly follows Campbell and Shiller (1988) and
Campbell (1991).
The starting point is simply the deÞnition of the stock return, Ht+1:
1+Ht+1 ≡P
t+1 +Dt
P
t
(1)
where P is the stock price and D is the dividend. Taking logs and letting ht+1 = ln(1+Ht+1)
yields:
ht+1 = ln(P
t+1 +Dt)−ln(P
t) .
(2)
The next step is to derive a log-linear approximation to ln(Pt+1 +Dt). One way to do this
is to Þrst-difference, and express the change in the log of the sum as the weighted sum of
the log differences
∆ln(P
t+1 +Dt) ≈ρ∆pt+1 +(1−ρ)∆dt
(3)
where ρ is the steady-state P/(D+P). “Integrating” this expression gives
ln(P
t+1 +Dt) ≈k +ρpt+1 +(1−ρ)dt ,
(4)
substituting this into the expression for ht+1, substituting δt for dt−1 −pt, and combining
terms gives
ht+1
≈
k −ρδt+1 +δt +∆dt
(5)
≈
k +(1−ρL−1)δt +∆dt .
(6)
The next step is to solve forward, giving
δt
=
(1−ρL−1)−1(ht+1 −∆dt −k)
(7)
=
∞
∑
i=0
ρi(ht+1+i −∆dt+i)−k/(1−ρ) .
(8)
34


Substituting this, and a similar expression for δt+1, into (5) and collecting terms yields:
ht+1 −Etht+1 = −
∞
∑
i=1
ρi(Et+1 −Et)ht+1+i +
∞
∑
i=0
ρi(Et+1 −Et)∆dt+1+i
(9)
which corresponds to equation 1 in Campbell (1991).
A breakdown of excess returns can then be derived by expressing the equity return ht+1
as the sum of a risk-free rate and an excess return
ht+1 = rt+1 +yt+1 .
(10)
Because it is assumed that rt+1 is known at time t, the “excess return surprise” yt+1−Etyt+1
is the same as the overall return surprise ht+1−Etht+1. So the risk-free rate can be included
in the two-way breakdown as follows:
yt+1 −Etyt+1 = −
∞
∑
i=1
ρi(Et+1 −Et)(yt+1+i +rt+1+i)+
∞
∑
i=0
ρi(Et+1 −Et)∆dt+1+i
(11)
or as
yt+1 −Etyt+1
=
−
∞
∑
i=1
ρi(Et+1 −Et)yt+1+i −
∞
∑
i=1
ρi(Et+1 −Et)rt+1+i +
∞
∑
i=0
ρi(Et+1 −Et)∆dt+1+i .
(12)
Again, because Etrt+1 = rt+1, it doesn’t matter whether the summation involving the rs
begins at 0 or 1. Finally, letting ey
t+1 represent the “excess return surprise” and replacing
the summations with the corresponding ˜
es yields (10).

Table 10
A variance decomposition of excess equity returns
The table reports the decomposition of the variance of the current excess equity returns
into the variances of revisions in expectations of dividends, real interest rates, future excess
returns, and the covariances between these three components. The excess equity return
is the difference between the CRSP value-weighted return and the one-month Treasury
bill rate. A six-variable VAR(1) is used to construct forecasts of future real interest rates
and excess returns. The VAR includes the excess equity return, the real interest rate, the
relative bill rate (deÞned as the three-month bill rate minus its 12-month lagged moving
average), the change in the three-month bill rate, the smoothed dividend price ratio, and
the spread between the 10-year and one-month Treasury yields. Parentheses contain t-
statistics, calculated using the delta method.

Table 11
The impact of monetary policy on dividends, interest rates, and future returns
The table reports the impact of monetary policy surprises on the current excess equity
return, and the discounted sums of future excess equity returns, current and future real
interest rates, and current and future dividends. The six-variable VAR(1) used to construct
real interest rate and excess equity return forecasts is estimated over the sample indicated
in the column headings, and the contemporaneous response to the funds rate surprises
is estimated on the February 1994 to December 2002 subsample. Parentheses contain t-
statistics, calculated using the delta method.

Figure 1. Federal funds rate surprises and equity returns, daily data. The Þgure is a
scatterplot of one-day CRSP value-weighted equity returns against the surprise element of
changes in the federal funds rate, for the 131 event days in the sample. Observations are
distinguished by their association with FOMC meetings, intermeeting target rate changes,
the release of employment reports, and changes in the direction of rate movements (rever-
sals). The six observations with boldface date labels are those ßagged as candidate outliers
on the basis of regression inßuence statistics. The two observations with italicized date
labels are those associated with unusual announcements by the FOMC.

scatterplot of one-day changes in the three-month-ahead federal funds futures rate against
the surprise element of changes in the federal funds rate, for the 131 event days in the
sample. Observations are distinguished according to whether the reaction of three-month-
ahead expectations are greater than, less than, equal to, or opposite in sign from the federal
funds rate surprise. The two observations with date labels are those associated with unusual
announcements by the FOMC.

Figure 6. The dynamic responses of excess equity returns, interest rates, and the
dividend-price ratio to federal funds rate surprises. Each panel depicts the response of
the indicated variable to a one percentage point federal funds rate surprise. The contempo-
raneous response to the funds rate surprises is estimated on the February 1994 to December
2002 subsample. A six-variable VAR(1), estimated over the 1973–2002 sample, is used to
project the future path of each variable. Because of the large difference in scale, the initial
excess return response is not shown. Each variable is experessed in monthly percentage
terms.
