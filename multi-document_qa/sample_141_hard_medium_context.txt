From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia
In this Chinese name, the family name is Teoh (赵).
Teoh Beng Hock (20 April 1979 – 16 July 2009) was a Chinese Malaysian journalist
and political aide to Ean Yong Hian Wah, a member of the Selangor state legislative
assembly and state executive council. On 15 July 2009, the Malaysian Anti-Corruption
Commission (MACC) took Teoh into custody for questioning about allegations of
corruption. Teoh was found dead the next morning on the rooftop of a building adjacent
to the MACC offices. Pakatan Rakyat leaders and a number of federal government
officials called for a Royal Commission of inquiry into Teoh's death.[1]
Family
​
[ edit ]
Teoh was the third child of Teoh Leong Hwee (born 1953). He had an elder brother; Teoh Beng
Kee (Chinese: 赵铭基) (born 1976), elder sister; Teoh Lee Jun (Chinese: 赵丽君) and a younger
sister; Teoh Lee Lan (1980,Chinese: 赵丽兰). His father was a taxi driver, and his mother, Teng
Shuw Hor (1953) is a housewife.
Teoh was engaged to 28-year-old teacher Soh Cher Wei after a two-year courtship, and had been
planning to register his marriage with her the day following his death. A photo shoot on the same
day, followed by a honeymoon and wedding reception in October had also been planned. At the
time of Teoh's death, Soh was two months pregnant; she told the press she intended to keep the child.[2] National Registration
Department regulations only allow a father's name to be included on the birth certificate if he is physically present at the time of birth;
after this was publicised through the press, Women, Family and Community Development Minister Shahrizat Abdul Jalil said she
would ask the NRD to look into the matter. Shahrizat also stated her ministry would assist in transferring Soh from her current school
to one closer to her hometown, and look into assisting Teoh's family since he was their sole breadwinner.[3]
Prime Minister Najib Razak later met with Teoh's family to express his condolences. Najib told them he would direct the Attorney-
General and relevant government departments to look into Teoh's family's wish that his child bear the Teoh surname.[4] On 15 August
2009, Soh completed the traditional Chinese marriage ceremonies, together with Teoh Lee Lan, Beng Hock's younger sister, acting as
a proxy. Kerk Kim Hock, a distant uncle of Teoh and the family's acting spokesperson, told the press that completion of the marriage
rites now entitled Soh to have her name engraved on Teoh's gravestone as his wife.[5]
Sequence of events
​
[ edit ]
MACC officials claimed that the interrogation had lasted for about 9 hours. According to the MACC also, Teoh was freed at 3.45 am—
however without proper explanation, his possessions, including his mobile phone, remained in MACC custody. MACC officials also
claimed that Teoh asked to stay the night at the MACC office, and was claimed to be last seen alive around 6 am. Teoh was found
dead at 1.30 pm later in the day. The investigation had been into allegations that Ean Yong had paid RM2,400 for flags to be used in
Merdeka Day celebrations, but not taken delivery of the flags. Teoh's colleagues who had also been questioned claimed that they
were put under pressure from MACC officers, including being denied access to legal counsel and food or drink.[6] Teoh's mobile
phone was still in the possession of MACC officials when he was found dead at 1.30 pm despite the MACC's claims that Teoh was
released at 3.45 am. The mobile phone was later handed to the police for investigation.[7]
One of Teoh's colleagues, Tan Boon Wah, later filed suit against the MACC for false imprisonment. In the case, Tan Boon Wah v.
Datuk Seri Ahmad Said Hamdan, Ketua Suruhanjaya, Suruhanjaya Pencegahan Rasuah Malaysia and Others, the High Court ruled
that because Tan was interrogated after normal working hours, he had been subject to false imprisonment, and ordered the MACC to
pay him damages. Tan's lawyer, Karpal Singh, said that Teoh's family could also sue the MACC for damages, citing this ruling.
Democratic Action Party Parliamentary leader and former Opposition Leader Lim Kit Siang lamented that "Teoh Beng Hock would not
have died if MACC had followed the law" and interrogated him during the day.[8]
Teoh's family and others have called the MACC's version of events into question. When the investigating officer involved briefed the
MACC's advisory board, several members of the board "asked why he chose to stay back. Any detainee would have run for his life!
The investigating officer replied that since Teoh wanted to stay back, he allowed it." During this briefing it also emerged that no official
records of Teoh's detention or his release existed.[9] In August, a video of men in uniform assaulting a man in their custody began
circulating as a supposed video of Teoh's interrogation. The Bukit Aman federal police headquarters denied the men were police
personnel. The video had previously been circulated in June as a supposed example of police interrogation techniques, ruling out the
possibility of it involving Teoh. A political observer attributed the video's popularity to the government's failing to provide adequate
clarification about the circumstances of Teoh's interrogation: "The authorities are shedding little light about what happened to Teoh.
This allows rumour mongers to spread ridiculous things."[10]
Response to death
​
[ edit ]
Some lawyers have argued that the law does not authorise the MACC to hold witnesses in custody, and that since Teoh was not a
suspect, he should not have been held in custody. The Malaysian Human Rights Commission (SUHAKAM) called the duration of
Teoh's questioning "inhumane and cruel."[1] The president of the Bar Council, K. Ragunath, said the MACC had contravened the
Federal Constitution by denying Teoh legal counsel during questioning, as well as the Lockup Rules 1953, which require all detainees
to be locked up between 6.30 pm and 6.30 am to rest. Ragunath called Teoh's interrogation tantamount to torture.[11] Ean Yong's
lawyer insisted that as "Teoh's movement was restricted, this amounts to an arrest," despite the MACC's insistence that Teoh was
only a voluntary witness.[12] Mohamad Ramli Manan, a senior official who retired from the Anti-Corruption Agency (before it became
the MACC), agreed:
It is against established law and practice to interrogate them (suspects) in the night. The lock-up rules demand that they be
sent to a lock-up by at least 8 pm... Witnesses are sent back to their offices or homes and asked to be present at another
appointed date. I don't know why they had to call Teoh at 5 pm. This may be due to poor planning or some evil intention or
evil purpose on their part. ... The rights of a witness are protected more than that of a suspect, who is under detention...the
person can demand that the interview be adjourned to the next morning. ... The examining officer has to oblige, failing which
this becomes an (unlawful) detention or arrest. ... This shows that Teoh was definitely in the custody of the MACC. Under
Section 15 of the Criminal Procedure Code, an arrest occurs when you confine the person (physically). Thus, there was
unlawful detention or arrest of Teoh.[13]
Another former ACA official, Abdul Razak Idris, disputed Ramli's view of the interrogation process, saying: "The Act provides that we
can interview anytime. Investigators are supposed to work 24 hours."[14]
In response to calls from civil society and political leaders for a Royal Commission, Deputy Prime Minister Muhyiddin Yassin stated
the Cabinet would consider setting up a Royal Commission of inquiry.[15] Initial police findings suggested foul play was not involved in
Teoh's death, but his friends and relatives insisted Teoh had not committed suicide, pointing to the fact that he was to be married, and
that his fiance was pregnant.[16] Teoh's family lawyers claimed that during questioning by the police, his family had been asked
questions suggesting that they were primarily interested in "[absolving] MACC officers from liability" by pursuing the possibility of a
suicide. A week after Teoh's death, his family vigorously insisted there was no possibility he had killed himself: "Teoh was joyful and
had no problems at work. Teoh had no financial issues, got along well with everyone and was preparing for his wedding." One detail
which seemed to strike the police was Teoh's shoes; when his body was discovered, his shoes were apparently significantly damaged
and worn. Teoh's fiancee "said that Teoh had several pairs and seldom changed them unless they were damaged, but on that fateful
day, he wore a new pair."[17]
The United Malays National Organisation (UMNO)-owned newspaper Berita Harian published an op-ed by New Straits Times Press
managing editor Zainul Ariffin Isa criticising the response to Teoh's death, stating that criticisms of the MACC were an attempt to
undermine Malay institutions. Zainul was particularly critical of Selangor Menteri Besar Khalid Ibrahim for his criticism of the MACC
officers' handling of the case, saying it was not right for Khalid to question "those of the same race as him."[18]
At the weekly Malaysian Cabinet meeting on 22 July following Teoh's death, the Cabinet transferred all MACC officers involved in the
probe of graft allegations against the Selangor government to other assignments, pending the official police inquiry.[18] The Cabinet
also decided to establish a Royal Commission of inquiry into the MACC's interrogation procedures, but not Teoh's death, allowing the
standard inquest to pursue the matter.[19]
Royal Commission of inquiry
​
[ edit ]
In a joint statement, Pakatan Rakyat leaders called the Royal Commission's terms of reference insufficient, saying that the "question
[of how Teoh died] cannot be separated from the more general issue of how the MACC conducts investigations."[20] The Pakatan
Rakyat statement insisted that the Commission probe the following questions:
*why was Teoh's case allegedly involving an amount less than RM2,500 is [sic] pursued with such aggression and urgency?
why was Teoh and another so-called "witness" kept overnight and interrogated with such oppression?
why was Teoh's hand phone in the custody of the MACC when the MACC insisted that he was only a witness; why did
the MACC initially deny they took his handphone?
why would Teoh spend the night at the MACC's office if he was free to go especially since he was scheduled to be
married the next morning?
why would Teoh commit suicide (as alleged by MACC and others) in these circumstances, when he is about to get
married, with his fiancé expecting their child, and with no sign or history of depression or mental illness?[21]
Robert Phang, a member of the MACC advisory board, suggested that "Though the royal commission's scope is wide, it can be
opened up further to dig deeper into issues not cleared by the inquest," such as establishing a reason for Teoh's death.[9] Also being
investigated is a mystery letter written on the letterhead of MACC, alleging MACC, Hishamuddin bin Hashim was involved with the
torture of Teoh Beng Hock and former Menteri Besar Khir Toyo had prior knowledge of it.[22][23]
The Royal Commission of Inquiry concluded that Teoh was not murdered but had committed suicide due to the aggressive
interrogation tactics by three MACC officers.[24] Teoh's family have rejected the RCI's findings and insisted that Teoh was
murdered.[25] The Bar Council of Malaysia have also questioned the RCI's findings.[26] A coalition of 126 NGOs have called the
Commission's findings a whitewash as it did not address the concerns regarding the interrogation methods by the MACC.[27] Prime
Minister Najib Tun Razak has defended the RCI's findings and called on all quarters not to question the findings.[28] The Malay daily
Utusan Malaysia, which is owned by UMNO, defended the MACC and blamed DAP for Teoh's death.[29]
The three MACC officers involved in interrogating Teoh have been suspended pending an investigation by the police.[30]
Further developments
​
[ edit ]
On 10 February 2012, Teoh Meng Kee, Beng Hock’s elder brother filed an application at the Court of Appeal to review the open
verdict stating that Teoh Beng Hock committed suicide delivered by the Coroner’s Court in 2011, after his application was rejected by
the High Court on 1 December 2011.[31] The Court of Appeal on 5 September 2014 set aside the open verdict stating that "a person
or persons were responsible" for Teoh's death.[32][33]

REPORT OF THE ROYAL COMMISSION OF INQUIRY INTO 
THE DEATH OF TEOH BENG HOCK 
Introduction 
(1] 
On the 
16" July 2009 
[“the 
16"”], 
at about 1.30pm 
a security 
guard attached to a commercial company occupying premises in a multi- 
storey building known 
as Plaza Masalam [“Plaza Masalam”] 
in Shah 
Alam, Selangor, discovered the body of a male person lying face down 
on the 5" floor exterior landing of the building. He was later identified 
as Mr Teoh Beng Hock [“TBH”], 
a Malaysian Chinese who was 
the 
political secretary to an executive councillor of the State government 
of Selangor. 
[2] 
A day earlier, on the 15'July 2009 [“the 15"”], TBH was taken 
in 
by officers 
of the Selangor Malaysian Anti-Corruption Commission 
[“the Selangor MACC”] for questioning 
at 
its headquariers located on 
the 14" floor of Plaza Masalam. 
[3] 
Police who arrived at the scene on the 16" confirmed that TBH 
was dead. 
The police investigating officer for this case was one ASP 
Ahmad 
Nazri 
Zainal [ASP 
Nazri”]. 
Since 
he classified 
this case 
as 
one of sudden death, a coroner’s inquest proceeded under section 337 
of the Criminal Procedure Code. After interrupted hearings stretching 
over seventeen months, the coroner on the 5"January 2011 
returned 
an open verdict. He was unable to rule out either suicide or homicide 
as the cause of death. 
[4] 
There was 
a public outcry over this decision, particularly from 
the family members of TBH who demanded that a Royal Commission 
of Inquiry be set up to investigate 
into the death of TBH while 
in the 
custody of 
a law-enforcement agency, namely, the Selangor MACC.


  
  
Royal Commission of Inquiry 
[5] 
Acceding 
to 
this request, 
the Yang di-Pertuan Agong, 
acting 
pursuant to section 
2 (1) (d) and section 
3 (1) of the Commissions of 
Enquiry Act 1950 [“COE Act”], on the 26" January 2011 appointed 
us 
_ 
as Commissioners for this Royal Commission of Inquiry [“the RCI”] with 
| 
the following terms of reference: 
1. 
“to enquire whether or not there was any impropriety 
in the 
conduct of the examination of Teoh Beng Hock in the course 
of an investigation into a Shah Alam report number 0052/2009 
by the Malaysian Anti-Corruption Commission 
in 
relation 
to 
its standing 
orders 
and 
practices 
and 
to recommend 
any 
appropriate action, where necessary; and 
2. 
to enquire 
into 
the 
death 
of Teoh 
Beng 
Hock 
and 
the 
circumstances surrounding and contributing to his death.” 
[6] 
The timeframe mentioned in our letter of appointment to complete 
this inquiry and to render a report to the Yang di-Pertuan Agong was 
three months from the date of the issuance of our commission. This 
was 
the 25" April 
2011. 
But pursuant 
to 
our request 
to 
the Yang 
di-Pertuan Agong, this period was extended to the 25" June 2011. 
Representation 
[7] 
We commenced taking evidence in this inquiry on the 14" February 
2011, after settling preliminaries and procedures 
in meetings from the 
29" January 2011 onwards. Aside from the conducting officers assisting 
the RCI, four parties sought representation by advocates under section 
18 of the COE Act. They were: 
1, 
the Bar Council of Malaysia; 
2. 
the MACC;:


  
  
3. the State government of Selangor; 
4. the family of TBH. 
| 
[8]. 
Soon after their application was allowed, counsel for the family 
of TBH, Mr Karpal Singh and Mr Gobind Singh Deo, requested for an 
adjournment of the inquiry due to their engagement as counsel 
in the 
trial of the former deputy prime minister Dato’ Seri Anwar Ibrahim on a 
criminal charge for sodomy in the High Court at Kuala Lumpur. Further, 
both were 
of the view that the conducting 
officers assisting 
the RCI 
would 
be biased since they were officers from the Attorney-General’s 
Chambers. 
[9] 
Mr Malik Imtiaz Sarwar [“Mr Malik Imtiaz’], counsel representing 
the State government of Selangor, appeared to share this view. When 
we decided against granting the adjournment and the discharge of the 
conducting officers as we found 
no basis of their being biased 
or to 
have a tendency towards bias at that stage, Mr Karpal Singh and Mr 
Gobind Singh Deo informed 
us that they had instructions to subject 
our decision to judicial review by the High Court. 
[10] 
Subsequently, when this did not materialise, further arguments 
were submitted 
to 
us 
by these counsel 
that there was 
a pending 
application by the Attorney-General of Malaysia to have the decision of 
the coroner reviewed. 
According to them, this should be disposed of 
before the RCI continued with its task. 
In addition, there was a demand 
by them that the Chairman of the RCI should recuse himself since he 
is 
a sitting judge of the Federal Court of Malaysia. We believed that 
the primary objective for raising these grounds was to compel the RCI 
to adjourn its proceedings. When this was turned down, both Mr Karpal 
Singh and Mr Gobind Singh Deo on the 16" February 2011 declared that 
they would not be participating 
in this inquiry since they did not wish 
“to lend legitimacy” to 
it. The next day, Mr Malik Imtiaz followed 
suit, 
citing as an additional reason that the RCI should not hear evidence 
afresh but adopt that disclosed 
at the coroner’s inquest, an approach 
with which we disagreed.


  
  
Procedure adopted 
[11] 
The procedure adopted by the RCI during this inquiry was similar 
to that 
of previous 
Royal Commissions 
of Enquiry. The conducting 
' 
Officers 
after consulting 
us 
and 
the remaining 
represented 
parties, 
provided 
a 
list of witnesses 
to be called. 
All these witnesses turned 
up 
to 
testify. They were questioned extensively and intensely 
by 
us 
and counsel for the represented parties. Some of them were examined 
against statements made by them 
to the police, investigation diaries, 
declassified investigation papers and other documents requested by us 
and provided 
for by the Malaysian Anti-Corruption Commission 
[“the 
MACC”] and police as well as exhibits tendered during the coroner's 
inquest. We must state that to a large extent the MACC was cooperative 
in supplying the materials we requested. 
[12] 
Though counsel representing the remaining parties were supposed 
to be impartial 
in assisting us to arrive at the truth of what happened 
to TBH on that fateful night of the 15 and early morning of the 16", 
except for the conducting officers, each side took a diagonally opposite 
approach 
in their questioning of the witnesses and submissions made. 
Dato’ Sri Muhammad Shafee Abdullah, counsel for the MACC, defended 
the MACC officers called to testify, while the team of lawyers from the 
Malaysian Bar [“the Bar’] questioned them extensively, protractedly and 
relentlessly to ensure that “no stone was left unturned” to arrive at the 
truth. This mode of questioning was beneficial 
to us since 
it enabled 
us to view the evidence from different perspectives. 
[13] 
To assist us in our own investigation was Mr Michael Leslie Squires 
["the 
investigator’] whose services were secured through 
the public 
prosecutor under section 
16 (2) of the COE Act. He was an ex-police 
officer from Liverpool, England and was the former chief investigator of 
the Independent Commission Against Corruption [the ICAC”] of Hong 
Kong. Mr Squires was able to conduct some investigations which were 
of assistance to us but of greater importance to us was 
his input on 
the investigation and interrogation procedures and practices adopted


  
in other jurisdictions. This enabled us to understand how questioning 
should 
be conducted 
to 
get maximum 
results 
properly and 
lawfully 
rather than to employ unscrupulous techniques to obtain the same. 
The standard of proof 
[14] 
To come 
to 
a finding 
of fact by 
us, there must be 
a particular 
level of proof to satisfy us. For the standard of proof required, we have 
based our finding on a balance of probabilities sliding to proof beyond 
reasonable doubt [see Briginshaw v Briginshaw and another (1938) 
60 CLR 336, 362]. 
[15] 
We adopted this approach for the reason that our finding may 
cause serious damage 
to the reputation 
of some individuals but this 
must be measured against the death of a person while 
in the custody 
of a law-enforcement agency, where the only witnesses are persons 
whose conduct is being investigated. Further, there are the inherent and 
harsh realities of meeting “a blue wall of silence” based on brotherhood 
ties among officers of the organisations involved. 
Second term of reference 
[16] 
Of the two terms of reference referred 
to us, the first 
is much 
dependent on our investigation and findings on the second. And since 
there will be 
a substantial degree of overlapping between the two, we 
approach our report by dealing first with the second term of reference 
before returning to the first. 
[17] 
To fully appreciate our finding, we propose to illustrate the facts 
before proceeding to give our decision with reasons therefor. 
Facts 
[18] 
The State government of Selangor at the time of TBH’s death was 
controlled by the Pakatan Rakyat, 
a coalition 
of parties 
in opposition


  
at the Federal government level. Each state assemblyman 
in the State 
of Selangor was granted 
an allocation 
of RM500,000.00 
per annum 
from the state coffers for projects and programmes carried out 
in 
his 
constituency. 
But not all state assemblymen were allowed 
to decide 
on how this should 
be applied. 
Such privilege was only reserved 
to 
those from the party 
in power of the day. 
A Selangor state executive 
councillor had an additional allocation of RM100,000.00 per annum on 
top of his standard allocation. 
[19] 
There was no uniform approach on how to spend this allocation. 
Much depended on the preference of the entitled state assemblymen 
to decide on how this was to be used. But 
it must be borne 
in mind 
that any expenditure incurred on 
a single project was not to exceed 
a 
sum of RM20,000.00. 
[20] 
The expenses for the projects undertaken were paid out by the 
respective 
District Office 
or Land 
Office where the constituency was 
located. 
[21] 
In the constituency of Seri Kembangan, the state assemblyman 
at the material time was Yang Berhormat [“the Honourable”] Ean Yong 
Hian Wah [“YB Ean’]. He was and is also an executive council member 
of the 
State government 
of Selangor. 
During 
our 
inquiry, 
we were 
informed 
that he elected 
to spend 
his allocation 
on “small 
projects” 
and “programmes” for the years 2008 and 2009. 
[22] 
Small projects involved civil construction works such as repairing 
damaged drains, fences, retaining walls and the like. Programmes involved 
the staging of events to foster better understanding and rapport among 
persons residing 
in the area. An example was the “Pesta Tanglung” 
[Lantern Festival] and another was the promotion of the release of a 
certain member 
of the Pakatan Rakyat who was 
in detention under 
the Internai Security Act [“the ISA”] at the material time as well as for 
the abolition of that Act [though we find 
it strange that such a struggle 
should fall within the ambit of “mesra rakyat” (citizens’ gathering)).


  
  
  
[23] 
From June 2009 right up to the 
1% March 2010 [when he was 
transferred out], the deputy director of the Selangor MACC was one 
Hishamuddin Hashim [“HH”]. As deputy director, 
he was 
in charge of 
investigations and intelligence-gathering by the Selangor MACC 
in the 
State 
of Selangor. 
It 
is 
of interest 
to note that he appeared 
to have 
absolute authority 
to 
investigate anyone whom 
he suspected 
to 
be 
involved 
in any corrupt practice 
in 
the 
state without even 
informing 
or obtaining the consent of his superiors 
in the MACC headquarters 
in Putrajaya [“HQ”] or his superior on the ground, the director of the 
Selangor MACC. Fortunately, we were informed by the current deputy 
chief commissioner of the MACC that this shortcoming has been rectified 
and that certain categories 
of cases dealt with 
by the MACC 
in any 
state now require approval and consent from HQ before investigations 
can commence. 
[24] 
Around the 21* June 2009, HH said that he received information 
from a source which alleged that Selangor state assemblymen entitled 
to the use 
of the allocation were engaged 
in submitting false claims 
and that certain Pakatan Rakyat state assemblymen were using the 
allocation 
in 
the 
interest 
of their 
political 
parties 
instead 
of for 
the 
benefit of the public. The source suggested that claims submitted by 
these 
state assemblymen 
be 
investigated. 
This information 
received 
by HH was reduced into writing and tendered as an exhibit marked 
| 
207. 
[25] 
Acting on this information, HH ordered his subordinate, Mohamad 
Anuar Ismail [“Anuar”’] on the 24" June 2009, 
to file a formal written 
complaint to say that the state assemblymen of Selangor had filed false 
claims to the District Office for programmes which did not take place 
and suggested action be taken to ascertain whether any offences set 
out in the Malaysian Anti-Corruption Commission Act 2009 [“MACC Act’] 
had been committed. Anuar filed this complaint on the 13" July 2009 
[exhibit 
| 61].


  
  
[26] 
Following 
from this, numerous documents from various District 
Offices and Land Offices in Selangor where such claims were managed 
were seized. This attracted much publicity and was extensively reported 
in the local media. 
i27] 
_ Then on the 14 July 2009, HH gave 
a briefing to his officers 
outlining 
the 
plan for an operation. 
He focused 
on 
two areas: 
Seri 
Kembangan which 
is the constituency of YB Ean and another known as 
Kampung Tunku which is under a different state assemblyman. He then 
directed that there should be nine teams, each engaging 
in different 
activities, 
for example, one to check with the registry of businesses to 
ascertain who the proprietors of the firms were which had made claims 
for projects or programmes while another was to search various targeted 
premises for incriminating evidence. 
[28] 
Facing insufficient manpower, HH requested for officers from other 
MACC branches 
in Selangor as well as from HQ to assist. Anuar was 
appointed by HH as the investigating officer [“the [O”] for this operation 
despite there being available another more senior officer, Hairul Ilham 
Hamzah 
[“Hairul 
llham”], who was the head 
of investigations 
in the 
Selangor MACC. 
All 
in 
all, thirty-three officers were involved and on 
the morning 
of the 
15", HH commanded them 
to proceed. 
Further, 
HH decided that Anuar was to take on Seri Kembangan whilst Hairul 
Ilham was to concentrate on Kampung Tunku. 
Events in the SUK building 
[29] 
_ 
Anuar and his team of four officers first went to the service centre 
of YB Ean 
in Seri Kembangan. On being informed that the claims 
in 
question were dealt with 
by YB 
Ean’s 
office 
at the 
state secretariat 
building [“the SUK building’] 
in Shah Alam, Selangor, he together with 
his men proceeded there on the same afternoon of the 15". 
At about 
3.00pm at the 15" floor office of YB Ean they met TBH. According to 
Anuar, 
after identifying 
himself he requested TBH 
to 
deliver 
to him


  
  
and his team documents concerning claims under the allocations for 
the years 2008 and 2009. He and 
his team intended 
to check these 
against four suspicious documents which they had extracted from the 
files taken from the District Office and Land Office. TBH complied and 
provided 
the documents required. 
However, 
instead 
of limiting 
their 
investigation 
to this, one accompanying officer by the name of Mohd 
Najeib Anmad Walat 
[“Najeib”] probed into the laptop of TBH. He found 
four suspicious documents [D94, D95, D96 and D97 
in exhibit 
| 
197, 
ie exhibits D94 
to D97]. These were said 
to be drafts and involved 
quotations for projects paid out under the allocation. 
[30] 
Soon thereafter, YB Ean, upon being 
notified 
by TBH through 
the mobilephone 
of the presence 
of MACC 
officers, 
rushed 
to 
his 
office from a sitting of the Selangor state assembly to meet with Anuar 
and 
his team. 
He was accompanied 
by 
a large number of reporters. 
A heated exchange 
of words took place between YB Ean and Anuar 
centred mainly on the MACC’s right of entry without a search warrant. 
Intimidated 
by the presence 
of the reporters 
in YB Ean’s office who 
were roaming around 
freely, Anuar and 
his team 
left and withdrew 
to the 
car park 
of the SUK building. 
He then 
met Hairul Ilham who 
happened 
to 
be 
also there on 
his assigned 
mission. After receiving 
further instructions from HH 
as 
to what 
to 
do, Anuar and 
his team, 
accompanied by 
Hairul 
Ilham, returned 
to YB Ean’s office. There he 
met TBH again. 
Not long thereafter YB Ean came back 
to the office, 
and this time he requested 
his lawyer to be present. 
Mr Manoharan 
s/o Malayalam [“Manoharan’], his lawyer, arrived shortly thereafter and 
further verbal arguments ensued, centring on the demand by Anuar to 
bring 
in TBH 
for questioning 
at the Selangor MACC office. A picture 
depicting this scene was captured by a newspaper reporter from “The 
Star’ and was published the next day. 
[31] 
Eventually 
a compromise was 
reached whereby TBH was 
encouraged to go with Anuar and 
his team. According to Manoharan, 
Anuar had promised him that he, Manoharan, could accompany TBH to


  
  
be interviewed but was later “played out” or deceived by Anuar when 
he was not even allowed to see TBH 
in the Selangor MACC office. 
[32] 
According to Anuar, when he met TBH 
in YB Ean’s office, TBH 
was restless and walking 
up and down. This view was supported by 
the testimony of Najeib who was examining TBH’s computers. 
in the 
opinion of Manoharan, 
TBH 
at that material time was shocked to see 
all the compuiers seized. But after speaking with and requesting TBH 
to cooperate with the MACC officers, Manoharan observed that TBH 
was more cheerful and ready to go with Anuar and his team. 
[33] 
TBH left with Anuar’s team shortly before 6.00pm on the 15" in 
his own car. He was in fact escorted by two MACC officers. One Mohd 
Hafiz Izhar Idris [“Hafiz’] carried the central processing unit [“CPU”] of 
the computer seized from YB Ean’s office and sat at the rear of TBH’s 
car. The other was Mohamad Azhar Abang Mentaril [“Azhar’] who carried 
TBH’s laptop and sat next to TBH who drove the car. 
Though Anuar 
and Hafiz insisted that TBH had kept his laptop with him throughout 
the journey, 
this was contradicted 
by video pictures captured on the 
closed-circuit television camera [“cctv’] at the entrance to Plaza Masalam 
on the fourth floor. They explicitly showed Azhar carrying 
a bag with 
TBH’s laptop 
inside, 
while TBH 
had 
nothing 
in 
his hands except 
a 
mobilephone which he was speaking into. 
‘TBH at Selangor MACC 
[34] 
At about 6.15pm 
at the reception area 
of the Selangor MACC 
office, Anuar met TBH. 
Obviously TBH was brought there 
to await 
Anuar’s direction. Here, Anuar again observed that TBH was walking 
up and down as 
if he was looking for something. This prompted Anuar 
to inquire of TBH whether he [Anuar] could be of help. We found this 
rather strange when 
it was Anuar who had insisted that TBH be brought 
in for questioning. Then, according to Anuar, TBH inquired whether he 
could contact 
his lawyer through 
his mobilephone. This request was 
10


  
  
acceded 
to and TBH made 
a 
call. When 
this was completed, Anuar 
‘demanded that TBH switch off his mobilephone. To ascertain whether 
this was complied with, Anuar took TBH’s mobilephone 
to examine 
it 
but returned the same to him with instructions to keep 
it 
in 
his bag. 
Hafiz, who was also at the reception area at that time, observed the 
first part of what took place but was uncertain whether or not Anuar 
returned the mobilephone to TBH. 
[35] 
This aspect of the evidence was crucial when 
it became apparent 
that TBH was one 
of those who are addicted 
to this modern means 
of communication and who, when deprived of his mobilephone, would 
become completely disorientated and helpless in the situation he was in. 
His obsession with this gadget is confirmed by his very close colleague 
Miss Ooi How Oon [“Mandy”] and his fiancée Ms Soh Cher Wei ["Ms 
Soh’] 
as well 
as 
by 
his family members. Mandy described TBH 
as 
a person who could 
not 
live without 
his mobilephone. 
And Ms Soh 
added that TBH spent a lot of time on 
his mobilephone talking to 
his 
family and friends. An illustration of his need to communicate through 
this means was when he called YB Ean 
to inquire where Manoharan 
was. Soon after, he contacted Manoharan to find out where he was. 
“Calming therapy” 
[36] 
Perceiving 
it as an excellent idea 
to “calm” TBH down, Anuar 
placed TBH 
in a section of the Selangor MACC office called Bahagian 
Pendidikan Masyarakat, commonly known as “Pen Mas”. There were 
some 
sofas: 
two single-seaters and 
a three-seater. 
But instead 
of 
allowing TBH to be alone to collect himself, Anuar ordered some officers 
to be his “companions”. 
There were six to seven of them at one time, 
beginning with Hafiz, followed by Azhar and others. Occasionally, Anuar 
would come around to watch over the situation. The instruction by Anuar 
to one of these officers, Azhar, was to collect information from TBH of 
his background: whether he was married, his educational qualifications, 
his previous employment and the like. This was completed 
in just ten 
11


  
  
minutes. Surprisingly, Hafiz also asked the same questions but confessed 
that this was done with the intention of getting to know TBH. In addition, 
another officer Sachianandan 
a/l Krishnasekar [“Sachi”] also repeated 
this line of questioning. 
[37] 
TBH was kept 
in 
this situation from approximately 6.30pm 
to 
-10.40pm. But most of the officers who were there to “accompany” him 
recalled that TBH kept very much to himself, he was quiet, tired and 
only answered questions when asked. 
In fact, at one stage, TBH asked 
-- Sachi as to when he would be able to go home. Sachi informed him that 
this would presumably be after his statement had been recorded. 
[38] 
Also during this time at the Pen Mas area, TBH was approached 
by Najeib who had discovered the four allegedly incriminating documents 
in TBH’s laptop while 
in the SUK building. Intending 
to access TBH’s 
email account 
to again 
have access 
to these 
four documents, 
he 
required TBH 
to type his password into the laptop. TBH complied and 
these four documents were subsequently downloaded and printed 
by 
Najeib and given to Anuar. 
[39] 
In the meantime, at another part of the office, Hairul Ilham, having 
taken over the IO’s job temporarily from Anuar [since Anuar had 
left 
after 8.00pm 
to attend to his personal domestic affairs, 
ie to fetch his 
maid from the airport and take her to his house], ordered one officer 
by the name of Arman Alies [“Arman’] to examine four files containing 
documents obtained from 
the 
District Office and 
Land 
Office. They 
related to claims made under YB Ean’s allocations for the years 2008 
and 2009. Arman was from HQ and was brought 
in specially for the 
purpose of this operation. The relevance of Arman to this inquiry is that 
he subsequently “interviewed” TBH 
in relation 
to these documents. 
[40] 
According to Arman, he looked through some of the documents and 
singled out those that appeared suspicious. Not long after, Hairul Ilham 
gave him another four documents [exhibits D94 to D97] and requested 
12


  
  
him to check on how the prices of the items 
in those documents were 
determined and whether the firms which made the claims from the 
allocation actually did exist. Instead of carrying out this task by himself, 
Arman asked TBH to assist. Further, he also made a request for another 
officer to help out. Hairul Ilham agreed and assigned him one Selangor 
MACC officer by the name of Ashraf Mohd Yunus [“Ashraf"]. 
“Interview” by Arman and Ashraf 
[41] 
TBH was called 
in for this “interview” before these two officers 
at about 10.45pm on the 
15". 
It took place 
in 
a large meeting room 
close to HH’s office. Instead of going through the documents and asking 
questions, Arman reversed 
the method 
and adopted 
an 
inquisitorial 
approach. He gave the documents he had to TBH and demanded that 
TBH 
search 
the 
four 
files 
to 
locate documents which corresponded 
with 
the exhibits D94 
to D97. According 
to 
both Arman 
and Ashraf, 
TBH was unable to locate them. Then, exceeding their specific scope 
of duty, they grilled TBH on 
all those documents 
in the four files, 
nit- 
picking 
as 
to why TBH had signed 
on some approval. forms 
for the 
claims against YB Ean’s rubber stamp. This was done despite TBH’s 
name 
being 
legibly written 
on 
the documents 
to show 
that 
he was 
signing for and on behalf of YB Ean. Questions were directed to TBH 
on the alleged non-compliance with certain Treasury directives on the 
award of contracts, namely, that there should be at least three separate 
quotations before 
a contract could be awarded and that the amount 
for the contract should 
not exceed RM10,000.00 [as both Arman and 
Ashraf feigned 
ignorance 
of this amount having 
been 
increased 
to 
RM20,000.00 by a Selangor government circular which also permitted 
direct awards of such contracts]. 
[42] 
Another important aspect of this “interview” 
is that both these 
officers extracted from TBH the password to his private email account, 
a matter which vexed TBH very much, causing him great concern and 
distress. We will discuss this later 
in this report. 
13


  
  
[43] 
Both Arman and Ashraf agreed that TBH was unable to answer 
many of the questions asked. Most of the time, according to these two 
officers, TBH was silent and just flipped through the documents 
in the 
four files given. 
[44] 
This so-called interview did not terminate until 12.45am on the 
16". So the entire time taken by Arman and Ashraf to question TBH was 
about two hours. Notes made of this “interview” were handed over to 
Hairul Ilham but mysteriously they could not be located for production 
in this inquiry for us to examine. 
[45] 
Ashraf maintained that throughout this “interview” he played no 
part in questioning TBH. During the entire two hours, aside from going 
out to collect 
a copy of the Treasury directives [which were no more 
applicable] and fetching TBH a glass of water to drink, he was tagging 
documents referred to him by Arman. 
[46] 
While TBH was being “interviewed” 
by Arman and Ashraf, YB 
Ean turned 
up 
at the 
14" floor of Plaza Masalam 
at about 11.45om 
with 
a lady lawyer. They demanded to see TBH. 
Hairul Ilham refused 
the request but assured them 
that TBH would 
be released 
at about 
5.00am the following morning. Feeling frustrated YB Ean left. 
Meeting with Lee Wye Wing 
[47] 
After the “interview”, Ashraf ied TBH back to the Pen Mas area. 
There TBH was surprised 
to meet 
a person 
called 
Lee Wye Wing 
[“Lee"], whom he knew. Lee had also been brought in for questioning. 
His episode in the encounter with the Selangor MACC will be elaborated 
upon 
later. However, 
at this stage, we shall focus on what transpired 
between the two of them 
in the early hours of the 16" at the Pen Mas 
area. According to Lee, the meeting between them lasted approximately 
ten to fifteen minutes. Strangely, they were allowed to be alone together 
and 
during 
this time they exchanged experiences 
on how they had 
been taken 
in. They had to speak softly for fear that officers passing 
through the area could listen 
in. 
14


  
[48] 
TBH, according to Lee, complained that the MACC officers had 
taken away 
his mobilephone and 
laptop. 
He 
also lamented 
that 
he 
should 
not have disclosed 
to 
the officers 
his password 
to 
his email 
account. Then he inquired from Lee whether there was any necessity 
to have three quotations before a contract could be awarded. Further, 
he complained that he had requested for his lawyer to be present but 
did not manage to meet him. Generally, Lee observed that TBH had 
many things on 
his mind. From Lee’s perception, 
this could also 
be 
due to the uncertainty of what was going to happen to them next and 
concern over the claim by the MACC officers on the requirement for 
three quotations before a contract could be awarded. Lee disclosed that 
TBH would not have known of such 
a requirement since his work did 
not involve such things. 
In fact Lee said that he [Lee] would 
be 
in 
a 
- 
better position to explain this since 
it was within the scope and ambit 
of his work [a matter upon which we shall elaborate later]. The meeting 
ended when TBH was taken away for his statement to be recorded. 
[49] 
Anuar returned 
after completing 
his domestic chores 
at about 
mid-night on the 15", 
ie going 
into the morning 
of the 
16". He was 
then 
told 
by 
Hairul 
Ilham 
to hand 
over the 
four 
files, 
the exhibits 
- 
-D94 to D97, the notes taken by Arman during his “interview” of TBH, 
and another set 
of documents marked as exhibits 
| 206A, 
| 206B, 
| 
206C and 
| 206D [which we 
shall 
clarify 
later as 
to how they were 
secured] to one officer by the name of Nadzri Ibrahim ["Nadzri"], who 
was directed 
by Hairul Ilham 
to record TBH’s statement. 
Nadzri had 
complied accordingly but instead 
of following 
Hairul 
lIlham’s direction 
immediately after receiving 
it at 12.30am on the 16", Nadzri took his 
time and only commenced recording TBH’s statement one hour later at 
1.30am. This process was only completed at 3.30am. TBH purportedly 
signed the statement. This statement, which is only a photocopy of the 
purported original, 
is marked as exhibit 
| 69. We did not have sight of 
the original. According to Nadzri, there was a toilet break 
in the midst 
of recording this statement. The toilet break took five to ten minutes.

Recording of statement 
[50] 
We were enlightened 
by Nadzri 
that the recording 
of TBH’s 
statement took the form 
of questions and answers. A question would 
be posed 
by Nadzri with documents shown 
to TBH 
and TBH would 
answer 
it. The answers given by TBH would then be keyed into the 
computer by Nadzri 
in the form 
of a narrative and shown 
to TBH 
to 
approve before the next question was asked. 
[51] 
Nadzri observed that during this exercise TBH was serious and 
was constantly looking down. 
His hands were 
in between 
his thighs. 
He was quiet and yawned frequently. He also sighed repeatedly and 
hardly moved. 
[52] 
According 
to 
Nadzri, Anuar 
did 
enter the room while TBH’s 
statement was being recorded. Anuar did not say anything of significance 
except to inquire casually whether things were “OK”. 
[53] _-The other thing 
that happened during 
the recording 
of TBH’s 
statement was the admission 
by Nadzri that he had raised 
his voice 
at TBH and remarked: “Kalau you penat, saya pun penat juga sebab 
saya 
taip statement” 
[“/f you are 
tired, 
| am also tired since 
| have 
to type the statement”]. We find this outburst rather unnecessary and 
uncalled for. First, 
it is from an officer carrying out his duty. He should 
have been more professional 
in 
his approach. And 
if he was indeed 
tired, 
he should have asked to have been relieved and to have been 
replaced by another officer. Second, TBH was not 
a suspect. He was 
a witness called 
in 
to assist the Selangor MACC 
in 
its investigation. 
Courtesy should have been accorded to him. Thus, such treatment 
of 
him by Nadzri was certainly unwarranted. Further, 
if this process was 
tedious, 
it could easily have been adjourned to another day unless, 
of 
course, there was an agenda to put pressure on TBH by continuing to 
record his statement in these circumstances.

. [54] 
After the recording of TBH’s statement, Nadzri had gone searching 
for Anuar, Hairul Ilham having gone home at about 3.00am on the 16". 
Nadzri found Anuar sleeping 
in the prayer room [surau] which was 
situated next to the meeting room. He was instructed by Anuar to leave 
the documents and TBH’s statement on his [Anuar’s] table, and to inform 
TBH to go home. According to this witness, when he told TBH of this, 
TBH requested to be allowed to remain in the office to rest. Nadzri then 
agreed to this but warned TBH not to wander around. Nadzri claimed 
to have told Anuar of this and that the latter had agreed. 
Events after 3.30am on the 16 
[55] 
Ashraf said 
that, 
at about 4.40am 
on 
the 
16", 
while 
he was 
walking past the waiting area outside Nadzri’s room, he noticed TBH 
lying on a sofa. TBH had requested for a drink and Ashraf had fetched 
it for him from the pantry. After this, Ashraf claimed to have departed 
for home leaving TBH where he was, lying on the sofa 
in this area. 
[56] 
Then there was another officer called Raymond Nion anak John 
Timban [‘Raymond”] who affirmed that he saw TBH lying on the sofa 
in this location when he was about to leave for home at about 6.00am 
on the 16". 
[57] 
Anuar, though being the 
IO for the operation, elected 
to sleep 
until the next morning 
in an area supposedly most accessible to the 
public: 
at the reception partitioned 
by 
a screen. 
He did 
not wake up 
until 8.30am on the 16 when many of the staff had reported for work. 
Anuar explained that he had chosen this area because 
it was easily 
accessible 
to 
his officers 
to consult him. 
Strangely, 
however, many 
officers who passed this area did not even see him there. 
[58] 
At about 8.30am on the 16", after waking up from his slumber, 
Anuar declared that he was informed 
by a lady officer called Norsiah 
of a bag she noticed at the sofa 
in front of Nadzri’s room. When Anuar 
17


  
subsequently returned to his room, he saw this bag which he believed 
had been brought 
in by TBH the day before. 
It was on the floor by 
the side of the sofa 
in the area as described by Norsiah. Beside this 
bag was a mobilephone. He took possession of these and placed the 
mobilephone on his table and the bag on a chair in his room. He did not 
check the contents of the bag. We are puzzled by this rather careless 
and indifferent attitude adopted by Anuar in relation to the bag and the 
mobilephone. 
[59] 
We would have thought that Anuar as the IO should have been 
more vigilant and concerned with what was 
in the bag. For ail intents 
and purposes 
it might have been packed with explosives to blow the 
Selangor MACC office up as the office would no doubt be stored with 
incriminating evidence against suspects. Further, 
it defied logic not to be 
curious particularly when the purported owner of this bag was nowhere 
to be seen. A look 
at 
its contents may have given some clues as to 
who he was and where he could possibly be. 
[60] 
But believing 
that TBH may 
still 
be 
in 
the 
office, Anuar went 
around looking for him. He was later joined by Hairul Ilham who had by 
then turned up for work. They could not find- TBH but took no further 
steps 
to determine where 
he was. We would have thought that 
the 
following elementary steps would have been adopted 
to locate TBH: 
first, of course, was to look inside his bag; second, was to contact the 
night security guard, one Mohd Khairudin Denan [“guard Khairudin’] and 
inquire whether he had seen TBH leaving; third, was to contact Nadzri 
[the officer who recorded TBH’s statement] to ascertain whether TBH 
actually stayed the night. 
Discovery of body 
[61]. 
At about 1.30pm on the 16", an officer by the name of Azeem 
Hafeez Jamaluddin [“Azeem”] heard someone shouting from below the 
MACC office that 
a person 
had fallen from 
the building. 
He rushed 
18


  
down accompanied by some other officers. The body was lying on the 
landing at the 5" floor of Plaza Masalam. 
[62] 
Soon thereafter Anuar and Hairul Ilham were informed and Anuar, 
‘upon seeing the body, ascertained that 
it was that of TBH. When. they 
contacted HH, who was at HQ at that time, they were told by HH to go 
immediately to HQ for a briefing on the incident. When they arrived at 
‘the car park of HQ, they were told by HH on the mobilephone to turn 
back and proceed straight to the Shah Alam police station to make a 
report of the incident. 
But when they reached the police station, HH 
commanded them to return to the Selangor MACC office. So until this 
day no police report has been made 
by any Selangor MACC officer 
concerning the death of TBH. 
[63} 
Both Anuar and Hairul Ilham, instead of going straight back to 
the office from the police station as ordered, called for an escort from 
the Selangor MACC. According 
to them, they feared for their safety. 
Apparently, a large crowd had gathered at the Selangor MACC premises 
demanding an explanation as to how this could have happened to TBH 
who was supposed 
to have been 
only interviewed 
by 
the Selangor 
MACC as a witness but instead had been found dead. 
[64] 
Anuar was even more paranoid 
in 
his reaction. On his way to 
HQ with Hairul Ilham as instructed by HH, he instead deviated home to 
inform 
his wife of the incident and for her to take safety precautions. 
He said he felt vulnerable since “The Star’ newspaper had his picture 
published 
that morning arguing 
with Manoharan 
in 
the presence 
of 
TBH. Counsel for the Bar however interpreted the deviation to his home 
as an act of repentance for Anuar to confess to his wife for whatever 
unlawful actions he had taken against TBH. 
[65] 
The police commenced their investigation not long after TBH’s 
body was discovered. This included forensic work on the premises as 
well as on the deceased. The latter was done by forensic pathologists. A 
detailed account of their work will be disclosed and discussed later. 
19


  
[66] 
That evening, ie on the 16", all relevant personnel of the Selangor 
MACC involved 
in the operation remained 
in the premises. But before 
that, the top brass of the MACC in the person of Dato’ Seri Abu Kassim 
Mohamed, the then deputy chief commissioner, and Datuk Mohd Shukri 
Abdul 
[“Datuk Shukri’], 
the then 
national 
director 
of investigations, 
were present at the Selangor MACC office. They were briefed on the 
situation. 
Dato’ Seri Abu Kassim Mohamed 
in 
fact instructed 
all the 
MACC personnel involved to speak the truth and to cooperate with the 
police in their investigation. The police recorded cautioned statements 
on the evening 
of the 16" and the days that followed from 
all those 
involved. 
Police investigation 
- “the note” 
[67] 
— 
In the course of police investigation into the death of TBH, ASP 
Nazri took. possession 
of TBH’s bag. The contents 
of this bag were 
emptied. Among 
the things found were sheets 
of paper which ASP 
Nazri considered to be not significant at that time. He did not carry out 
further investigation into these sheets of paper until prompted to do so 
by Dr Badi’ah Yahya [“Dr Badi’ah”], 
a forensic psychiatrist appointed 
to assist the MACC 
to ascertain the state 
of mind 
of TBH from 
the 
psychological aspect. 
Dr Badi’ah had 
inquired 
of ASP Nazri whether 
there had been anything 
left behind 
by TBH which may amount to 
a 
suicide note, having regard to her experience in similar cases involving 
sudden. death suspected to be suicidal. 
But only much later did ASP 
Nazri take a look again 
at the documents found 
in the bag. When 
he 
found 
a note written primarily 
in Chinese characters, he requested 
a 
colleague to translate 
it to him. When 
he realised that the note may 
be of significance, he brought 
it to the attention 
of his superior who 
then ordered him to send 
it to the chemistry department for analysis of 
- the handwriting. The note was only produced at the inquest before the 
coroner on the 9 August 2010, after the inquest had commenced. We 
marked this note [“the note”] as exhibit 
| 168 (a) 
in the inquiry before 
us. 
20


  
  
[68] _ The note was on of an A4-sized sheet of paper and on 
it were 
writings 
in Chinese characters and 
a few Bahasa Malaysia words. 
A particular part had been scratched out 
in the note. At the inquest 
before the coroner, 
a Chinese interpreter had translated this note as 
follows: 
| 
“Ou Yang 
Dalam keadaan tidak menyalin fail dalam computer saya, mereka 
telah mengambil semua computer itu. Mereka asyik menyalahkan 
kamu. 
Minta maaf. 
Tidak mengerti 
tapi pura-pura mengerti, akhirnya menyusahkan 
kamu. 
Saya kata, ‘mendapat kelulusan YB’ 
Mereka berdegil menaip jadi ‘mengikut arahan YB’ 
Saya tidak dapat membantu kamu, maaf. 
Minta maaf, saya sangat penat, selamat tinggal.” 
[Translated freely from Bahasa Malaysia into English by us 
it 
reads: 
“Ou Yang 
In 
a situation without having copied the files into my computer, 
they took all the computers. They keep on blaming you. 
Sorry. 
Do not understand but pretend to understand, ending up in making 
it difficult for you. 
| said, ‘Obtained YB’s approval’ 
They were stubborn and typed 
it to become ‘according 
to YB’s 
direction’ 
| am unable to assist you, sorry. 
Sorry, 
| am very tired, goodbye.”] 
21


  
  
[69] 
The request made by ASP Nazri to the chemistry department was 
to determine whether the note could have been written 
by TBH. 
For 
the purpose of analysis, aside from the note, ASP Nazri also handed 
the following documents 
to 
the chemistry department 
to be used 
as 
samples of TBH’s handwriting: 
1. 
a photocopy 
of 
a statement recorded 
by Nadzri from TBH 
_with 
the bottom 
part 
of each page containing 
a purported 
signature of TBH: 
2. 
a photocopy of TBH’s national registration identity card [“NRIC”] 
where he had purportedly initialled on the side; 
3. 
an original visa credit card with TBH’s name printed thereon 
and bearing on the reverse side a signature purported to be 
that of TBH; 
4. 
a notebook containing the purported handwritings of TBH. 
[All of these are collectively referred to as “samples”]. 
[70] 
On the 14" October 2009, a chemist from the chemistry department 
by the name 
of Wong 
Kong Yong 
[“Mr Wong’, 
after examining 
the 
writing on the note and comparing 
it with the samples, proffered the 
following opinion: 
_ “The Chinese handwriting 
in documents BH 
1 
[ the note 
] and 
BH 4 
[ the notebook of TBH 
j were probably written by the same 
person and the examination of [the] Bahasa Malaysia handwriting 
on documents BH 
1 and the notebook BH 4 were written by the 
same person. The 
initials on document BH 
1 
and BH 
2 [TBH’s 
statement] were most probably written by the same person.” 
[71] 
Suspecting 
Mr Wong may have erred 
in 
his opinion, 
the 
Bar 
questioned Mr Wong protractedly until Mr Wong had to admit that his 
examination of the note was handicapped by the following. 
22


  
[72] 
First, the standard used for comparison had not been proved 
to be the handwriting of TBH. 
In short, the handwriting 
in the samples 
used 
for comparison 
had 
not been proved 
to 
be 
that 
of TBH. 
For 
this reason, 
his opinion 
at best was that the writing on the note was 
purportedly that of TBH and not that 
it was that of TBH. 
[73] 
Second, the first and second samples [TBH’s statement and his 
NRIC respectively] were photocopies. They were not originals. According 
to Mr Wong, 
a photocopy of any document may leave marks such as 
dark smudges, dots and even 
lines on 
the document, depending 
on 
the generation of the photocopy. And 
in respect of the signature ofa 
person, one could not tell from a photocopy the strength, 
shading, and 
pressure applied 
by the author which was necessary for comparison 
‘work. 
[74] 
Though we accept that there are natural variations in the writing 
and signature of a person, the shortcomings highlighted by Mr Wong, 
which handicapped him, cast grave doubts on the value of his opinion. 
These shortcomings touched 
on 
the fundamental requirements 
to 
determine the authenticity of TBH’s writing on the note. And without the 
original of TBH’s writing, we were unable to accept Mr Wong’s opinion 
that 
it was indeed TBH who wrote the note. 
[75] 
In addition to this, the undue delay in tendering the note at the 
first available opportunity created suspicion of its authenticity. The note 
was first brought to the attention of the coroner more than a year after 
it was purportedly found by ASP Nazri. His indifferent attitude, despite 
being prompted by Dr Badi’ah earlier [who had given him a checklist to 
investigate whether there was a possible suicide note as a person who 
commits suicide may most likely leave behind such 
a note] cannot be 
translated as mere carelessness or neglect. In faci, this created mistrust 
in us on the authenticity of this document, 
ie the note. 
In the light of 
these circumstances and the shortcomings 
in Mr Wong’s opinion, we 
attached no weight to the note 
in our deliberations. 
23


  
  
Tan Boon Wah 
[76] 
Tan Boon Wah was the de facto proprietor of a firm known as 
Merit Link Enterprise [“Merit Link”]. The proprietor was his wife. Merit 
Link. supplied one thousand 
five hundred 
pieces 
of Malaysian 
flags 
intended 
for 
a programme staged 
by YB 
Ean 
in 2008. The cost 
of 
these flags was RM2,400.00. Payment 
for this was made from 
the 
allocation entitlement 
of YB Ean. Suspecting 
that the flags had 
not 
been supplied, the Selangor MACC officers searched Tan Boon Wah’s 
house 
in Cheras, Kuala Lumpur, 
at about 4.00pm on the 
15". When 
Tan Boon Wah informed them that he had to fetch his wife from work 
as well as 
his child, they 
left but returned an hour later at 6.45pm 
to 
continue with their search. There was no search warrant for this exercise. 
Finally at 7.45pm, they took Tan Boon Wah to their office on the 14! 
floor of Plaza Masalam. They also seized his mobilephone, passports, 
bank books and Merit Link’s rubber stamp. 
[77] 
. When they arrived at the office at 8.45pm, Tan Boon Wah was 
placed 
in 
a small room measuring 
10’ x 10’. The light in the room was 
not switched on. There was a single chair with one of the roller wheels 
missing. The only other piece of furniture was a drawer cabinet. As the 
light was not turned on, the only light coming into the room was from 
the outside where a pingpong table was placed. He was kept here for 
an hour. Then, suddenly, 
he heard 
his name being called 
out aloud 
and the light in the room was turned on. Two officers came in. One of 
them was identified as Bulkini Paharuddin [“Bulkini’]. 
[78] 
. 
At forty-eight years 
of age, 
Bulkini was much 
older than 
the 
other officers involved 
in this operation. He was not from the Selangor 
MACC 
but was one 
of those who had been brought 
in from HQ 
for 
the operation. We believe that he considered himself an 
old hand 
in 
interrogation techniques, or “interviews” as the Selangor MACC officers 
involved 
in this operation constantly called 
it. 
According to Tan Boon 
Wah, Bulkini and his team employed various methods to intimidate him 
24


  
and 
to try and make him admit that he did not supply the goods but 
had received and pocketed the money instead. Methods employed were 
mostly psychological, ranging from keeping the room dark, belittling him 
for producing one child only after five years of marriage, threatening to 
-bring his child into the office so she would cry upon seeing the pathetic 
state 
her father was 
in, accusing 
him 
of being unkind 
to 
his family 
by not wanting to return home early by cooperating with the MACC, 
threatening 
to strike him with 
a pouch, forcing him 
to stand 
straight 
without moving and made to look afar [and while this was happening 
he was ridiculed by other officers playing pingpong outside the room], 
calling him “Cina bodoh” [“stupid Chinese’], pointing 
a finger cirectly 
‘at him and close to the bridge of his nose, deriding 
his position as a 
municipal councillor, and threatening to hit him if he refused to cooperate. 
At one time, 
Bulkini even 
sat on the floor to question him while Tan 
Boon Wah was directed 
to 
sit on the damaged chair. Another method 
employed was to try and pressure him to work with the Selangor MACC 
so as not to make Bulkini angry. Of course, 
all these assertions were 
denied by Bulkini and the officers involved. 
[79] 
Another aspect of the evidence was that Bulkini said that at about 
2.30am 
on the 16" after he had finished questioning Tan Boon Wah 
and briefed HH of Tan Boon Wah’'s recalcitrant attitude, he had told Tan 
Boon Wah to go home and 
to bring the relevant documents required 
the following day, 
ie on the 16. Tan Boon Wah instead had chosen 
to stay 
in the office to wait for his wife to produce these documents. 
This was after Bulkini had allowed Tan Boon Wah to communicate with 
his wife. 
This assertion of Bulkini that Tan Boon Wah was free to go 
was contradicted by the following evidence. 
[80] 
First, 
Bulkini 
had 
not consulted anyone 
in 
authority 
to 
permit 
Tan Boon Wah 
to leave. Second, though 
Bulkini had briefed HH 
on 
Tan Boon Wah’s refusal to admit the accusation levelled at him, there 
was no evidence that HH had permitted 
Bulkini 
to release Tan Boon 
Wah. Third, 
if Tan Boon Wah had been released 
but had chosen 
to 
25


  
  
stay instead, then there was no reason why Tan Boon Wah should 
have remained 
to have 
his statement recorded on the 16" 
up 
to as 
late as 11.30am. His statement could have been recorded much earlier. 
Fourth, why had Tan Boon Wah not been issued 
a demand notice to 
produce documents when he had supposedly been released by Bulkini 
whereas in fact he was furnished with such demand notice in the late 
. morning of that day after his statement had been recorded? 
If this was 
the requirement, Bulkini did not comply with 
it when he had offered to 
release Tan Boon Wah. 
Fifth, Tan Boon Wah only had 
his belongings 
returned 
to him 
on 
the 
16" 
after 
his statement had 
been 
recorded. 
And Tan Boon Wah had 
to acknowledge receipt for them. 
If he could 
have been released 
earlier, there would have been 
no necessity 
for 
these subsequent actions. 
Sixth, 
if Tan Boon Wah’s wife was to have 
brought those documents, should Bulkini then not have been interested 
to examine them to ascertain whether Tan Boon Wah had been telling 
the 
truth 
after he 
had 
been accused 
of lying 
over so many hours? 
Instead, 
Bulkini chose 
to leave 
at 3.30am and Tan Boon Wah's wife 
never appeared with the documents, which could only mean that Bulkini 
fabricated this piece of evidence. 
[81] 
Apart from this, there were two important aspects of Tan Boon 
Wah’s and 
Bulkini’s confrontation pertinent to our inquiry. 
First 
is the 
claim 
by Bulkini that 
at about 2.15am on the 
16", 
after questioning 
Tan Boon Wah, and allowing him 
to remain 
in the small room which 
Bulkini claimed that Tan Boon Wah preferred 
to be 
in [something we 
find hard to comprehend], Tan Boon Wah went searching for Bulkini at 
the pantry of the office. He requested for a drink and to be allowed to 
ease himself in the toilet. Since the toilet was right next to the pantry, 
Bulkini accompanied him there despite the fact that he was in the midst 
of his meal. 
Bulkini asserted that at the entrance of the toilet, he saw 
a male Chinese about the same height as Tan Boon Wah who was also 
about to enter the toilet. After Tan Boon Wah had gone 
in but before 
the toilet entrance door was shut, he heard Tan Boon Wah shouting 
in 
Mandarin “Ni loh!”, translated by Bulkini to mean “You fah!”. Deciding 
that his meal took priority over what these two might be talking about, 
26


    
Bulkini returned to the pantry to finish his meal. Tan Boon Wah went 
back to where he had come from. 
Bulkini never saw the other male 
Chinese again. 
[82] 
Some three weeks after the death 
of TBH, 
Bulkini decided 
to 
make 
a further police statement 
on 
the 20" August 2009, 
the 
first 
having been recorded on the 31% July 2009. 
In this further statement 
he claimed that the person whom Tan Boon Wah had shouted at on the 
morning of the 16" was in fact TBH. Though admitting that he had not 
at the material time known TBH, he said that he had recognised him 
from 
a picture shown on the television news broadcast at 8.00pm on 
the 16", lying dead 
in Plaza Masalam. 
What prompted his recollection 
that 
it was the same man he met at the toilet were the clothes worn 
by TBH on that day: white pants and a dark jacket. He explained that 
he had not mentioned this earlier for the reason that he needed to be 
certain. 
But as time went by 
it became apparent to him that 
it must 
have been TBH who Tan Boon Wah saw at the toilet and had shouted 
at. 
[83] 
Tan Boon Wah, though admitting that he did see Bulkini 
at the 
pantry that evening at about the time stated, denied that he either saw 
TBH or spoke to him. 
Instead, Tan Boon Wah affirmed that he met TBH 
on his second visit to the toilet. However, he could not recall the exact 
hour but claimed that no officers were there then. On this occasion, he 
uttered to TBH: “Beng Hock, you are still here?” 
In response Tan Boon 
Wah recalled that TBH could have replied by uttering, “Em”. However 
he was not certain of this. Since he was in a hurry to ease himself he 
did 
not engage 
in further conversation with TBH. 
But when he came 
out of the toilet, TBH was gone. He then went back to the small room 
to sleep until 10.00am on the16". 
[84] 
Though we are still narrating the facts of this case here, we think 
it appropriate at this stage to express our view on the issue of whether 
there was such an encounter between TBH and Tan Boon Wah and 
that Tan Boon Wah had indeed uttered the words “Ni /oh!” at TBH. 
27


  
  
[85] 
The purpose of Bulkini introducing this alleged piece of evidence 
was basically to support the theory that some parties involved 
in the 
claims under YB Ean’s allocation were blaming TBH for disclosing the 
scheme of.arrangement between suppliers of goods and YB Ean which 
the Selangor MACC was investigating. 
[86] 
Having considered the evidence, 
it is our view that this assertion 
of Bulkini was fabricated. The reasons now follow. 
[87] 
First, Bulkini never mentioned this meeting of TBH and Tan Boon 
Wah in the toilet as witnessed by him in his first police statement made 
soon 
after the event. 
By that time 
he would have seen 
the picture 
of TBH 
lying dead 
on the 
5" floor 
of Plaza Masalam. 
Instead, 
this 
disclosure was left to be made almost three weeks later. The lapse of 
time renders this contention dubious. 
[88]. 
| 
Second, 
in order for Bulkini to recognise TBH by the clothes he 
wore there should have been 
a full-length picture of TBH 
lying dead. 
We are doubtful whether such 
a picture disrespectful of the deceased 
would have been telecast 
in any 
of our national television networks, 
_ 
bearing 
in mind the sensitivities involved. 
[89] 
Third, 
Bulkini’s description 
of TBH 
as 
being almost the same 
height as Tan Boon Wah was contradicted 
by 
a photograph tendered 
as exhibit 
| 219. 
it showed TBH and Tan Boon Wah together with TBH 
standing 
a head taller over Tan Boon Wah. 
' 
[90] 
Fourth, we are unable to accept Bulkini’s claim that his recollection 
of the incident and recognition 
of TBH could improve with time. This 
is contrary to normal human recollection of events past. 
[91] 
Fifth, 
the 
toilet was 
located just outside 
the 
pantry. Some 
simple direction from Bulkini would have sufficed. Tan Boon Wah has 
no physical infirmities and as such there was no need for Bulkini to 
28


  
have interrupted 
his meal 
to accompany Tan Boon Wah 
to the toilet. 
Additionally, 
Bulkini occupied 
a superior position 
in the investigation 
vis-a-vis Tan Boon Wah. 
[92] 
Sixth, given that Bulkini was an experienced officer as proved by 
“his long service with the MACC, we were surprised that Bulkini made 
no attempt 
to 
pick 
up any continuation 
of the alleged conversation 
between TBH and Tan Boon Wah 
in the toilet. This was compounded 
by four factors: one, Bulkini speaks and understands Chinese, having 
been educated 
in 
a Chinese school up to primary six level where the 
medium of instruction in Chinese schools in this country is in Mandarin. 
And both TBH and Tan Boon Wah were conversing 
in Mandarin. Two, 
as an experienced officer and given the circumstances of an ongoing 
operation, he should have been more interested in gathering intelligence, 
more so when such a golden opportunity presented itself in the form of 
these two witnesses who were perhaps sharing vital information which 
could have assisted the investigation. Three, the alleged exclamation 
of “Ni 
loh!? 
by Tan 
Boon Wah 
to TBH 
should have piqued 
Bulkini’s 
curiosity to follow up with what was 
to continue between the two 
of 
them. 
But, instead, 
his preference to finish 
his meal took precedence 
over the likelihood 
of 
a scoop. 
Four, 
he was already 
in front 
of the 
entrance 
of the toilet and 
it would 
not have been 
difficult for him 
to 
have remained there 
a 
little longer to 
listen 
in. Any reasonable man 
would have done so given the circumstances at that time. 
193] 
Having 
regard 
to these numerous contradictions 
and 
those 
previously highlighted, we hold that this piece of evidence from Bulkini 
is unworthy of credit and should be rejected. 
Lee Wye Wing [“Lee’] 
[94] 
Lee was a project and programme agent. He arranged and put 
together different parties to carry out projects and programmes funded 
under YB Ean’s allocation. 
In the course of doing so, he also prepared 
29


  
the documentation to secure the approval and payment of the completed 
works. He worked closely with YB Ean and inevitably with TBH, as the 
political secretary to YB Ean. 
[95] 
On the 15", he received instructions to be present at the Selangor 
MACC office. He arrived at 4.30pm the same day and met Sachi, who 
was presumably 
in charge 
of questioning him. When 
he saw Sachi, 
the first thing Sachi did was to demand that he place his mobilephone 
on Sachi’s table. And then Sachi directed him to sit at an area where 
there was 
a 
sofa. 
Sachi 
proceeded 
to 
interrogate 
him 
by informing 
him that the Selangor MACC had enough evidence to charge him with 
an offence. He was then shown 
a number of documents. He recalled 
two programmes associated 
with these documents: 
Pesta Tanglung 
[Lantern Festival] and the campaign 
to abolish the ISA. According 
to 
Sachi, the things ordered for these programmes had not been supplied 
but money had been claimed and collected in respect of them. Further, 
Sachi accused Lee of using the allocation for political purposes. Sachi 
then demanded that he produce documents such as receipts for the 
purchases he had made for the programmes. Though Sachi did not use 
violence on him, 
he had raised 
his voice and acted 
in an aggressive 
manner when questioning him. 
[96] 
. Between 6.00pm and 8.00pm on the 15", Lee was kept 
in the 
pantry. There he met his partner Wong Hong Chae, the proprietor of 
Syarikat Hong Chae, 
a firm which had undertaken some projects and 
‘programmes for YB Ean. He was not permitted to speak to him. And 
then 
at or about 8.00pm, 
he was driven 
by 
a team 
of the Selangor 
.MACC officers to his home in Seremban to collect documents. He was 
supposed 
to hand over 
to them 
receipts which supported 
his claim 
that the work under the programmes and projects had been carried 
out. These officers did 
not search 
his house. He provided them with 
receipts, bank books and statements. His computer CPU was however 
seized. 
30


[97] 
A-set of documents given by Lee to these officers that evening 
were the first pages 
of exhibits 
| 206A, 
| 206B, 
| 206C and 
| 206D. 
These were four sheets of handwritten notes depicting the distribution 
of funds received from 
the four programmes completed and claimed 
for under YB Ean’s allocation. Accompanying each of these four pages 
were supporting documents such as approval letters, confirmation of the 
jobs completed, invoices, approvals by the District Office for payments 
and photographs taken of the events. 
[98] 
After this exercise was completed, Lee was taken back to the 
14 floor of Plaza Masalam. They arrived around midnight. He was then 
placed at the Pen Mas area where he met TBH who was already there. 
There 
is no necessity for us to repeat what transpired between them 
as this has been discussed earlier. Lee was kept there 
until 2.00am 
on the 16" when his statement was recorded. 
[99] 
The recording 
of Lee’s statement took three hours. 
It 
did 
not 
finish until 5.00am on the 16". Then at about 6.00am he had breakfast 
at the pantry and there he met Tan Boon Wah for the first time. Though 
he had heard 
of Tan Boon Wah and knew that he had provided the 
sound system for some of the programmes, Lee had not met him before. 
They spoke but were reprimanded by officers accompanying them and 
told to use only Bahasa Malaysia to converse. Lee stayed there until 
40.30am when one of the officers received a phone call to say that he 
was to be released. He then 
left Plaza Masalam immediately. 
[100] 
Except for the ten to fifteen minutes spent with TBH at the Pen 
Mas area around 12.00am 
on the 
16", 
Lee 
did 
not see TBH again. 
He learned from his niece Lee Kee Hiong at about 5.00pm on the 16" 
that TBH was dead. 
[101] 
Subsequently, after the investigation 
into the use 
of YB Ean’s 
allocation was taken over by HQ from the Selangor MACC, Lee provided 
further documents to the new investigating officer, Anmad Shafik Abdul 
31


  
  
Rahman [“IO Shafik”), to justify that the claims and payments for the 
programmes and projects were aboveboard. 
[102] 
What 
is significant 
in Lee’s testimony was the insight into the 
arrangement for the expenditure of YB Ean’s allocation for projects and 
programmes. Lee first explained the difference between a project [which 
he termed 
a “small project”) and 
a programme, 
as described earlier. 
Then he elaborated that for small projects, because of the requirement 
to use Class F contractors who could be bumiputras only, he arranged 
with a Malay friend of his, one Mohd Harun Abdullah [“Harun”], to set 
up 
a number of bumiputra firms. When YB Ean required certain 
civil 
works to be done 
in 
his constituency or for the constituency that he 
had adopted [since opposition state assemblymen were not provided 
with the allocation, assemblymen from the ruling party in the State of 
Selangor would adopt their constituencies 
so that residents 
in these 
constituencies would also benefit from the allocation], he would prepare 
for submission 
a form known 
as “Borang 
A”. YB 
Ean was required 
to sign on this. 
It was 
a request for the required works to be carried 
out. 
[103]. According to Lee, TBH did assist him in preparing some of these 
forms 
by filling 
in the particulars 
into 
a template 
he had provided 
to 
TBH. This was to save time since TBH could complete this and give 
it 
to YB Ean 
to sign immediately. This form would then be forwarded to 
the respective District Office or Land Office for processing. Work would 
not start until the approval from one of these offices was obtained. And 
when the works were completed, Lee would prepare the invoice for the 
contractor concerned to request for payment. YB Ean would then have 
to sign a form known as “Borang B” to confirm that the works requested 
had been completed. Payment would 
not be made 
until the technical 
siaff of the respective District Office or Land Office had inspected the 
works and confirmed that the costs for the items specified 
in the claim 
were in accordance with the standard amount set down by regulations. 
Only when the respective officer was satisfied as to this would payment 
be made from these offices to the contractor. 
32


| 
[104] 
. As for programmes, though the procedure was somewhat similar 
to small projects, the amount to be spent depended on YB Ean’s budget. 
. When YB Ean decided to stage, for example, the Pesta Tanglung at a 
~ 
cost of RM10,000.00, Lee had to work within this budget. Documentation 
leading to this claim was found in exhibit 
| 206C. For programmes there 
was no necessity to use a bumiputra firm since 
it did not involve civil 
Works. 
[105] 
We noticed some shortcomings in this procedure. There was no 
quotation tendered prior to the approval for a programme. Though Lee 
[and 
Lee Kee Hiong whose role we shall discuss shortly] confirmed 
that he had to work within the budget, there was no one to verify as 
to whether the goods and services supplied for the programme were of 
the value claimed. At least for a small project, there were the standard 
charges 
laid down 
by regulations 
to gauge the cost 
of works carried 
out. But none of this applied to programmes. 
[106] 
According to Lee, TBH had signed on behalf of YB Ean on some 
of the Borang 
B. He had typed his name on these forms and put his 
signature on them except that he had affixed YB Ean’s rubber stamp 
on the place where he had signed. Since there had been no express 
declaration that he had signed this document for and on behalf of his 
principal YB Ean, we were of the view that the MACC officers seized 
upon 
this 
to capitalise 
on 
their threat that TBH 
had committed 
an 
offence. 
[107] 
The next area 
of contention was the first page 
of each 
of the 
exhibits 
| 206A, 
| 206B, 
| 206C and 
| 
206D. 
All these concerned 
programmes. 
In fact one 
of them 
[exhibit 
| 206D] had nothing 
to do 
with YB 
Ean. 
It was 
for 
a 
different constituency, 
namely, Kampung 
Tunku. The state assemblyman there had also engaged the services 
of Lee and he had used 
a firm known as WSK Services fo carry out 
the programme. The proprietor of WSK Services 
ai the material time 
was Lee’s wife. 
33


  
  
[108] 
The distribution 
of the proceeds 
listed 
out on these four first 
pages 
of the 
said documents attracted some 
interest 
in 
the MACC 
Officers, particularly the consistent payments 
to DAP Serdang Aman 
in three of these [exhibits 
| 206A, 
| 206B and 
! 206C] and another to 
“DAP Malaysia” [exhibit 
| 206D]. Lee and Lee Kee Hiong subsequently 
. 
explained 
that these were 
for repayment 
of advances made 
by this 
political organisation 
for the respective programmes. 
In 
the case 
of 
repayment to the DAP Serdang Aman, we were told that YB Ean had 
a service centre there. He had used the DAP set-up for this purpose. 
Apparently, contractors and suppliers for the small projects or programmes 
would go there 
to request 
for payment 
first since the 
District Office 
or Land Office would take one to two months to process their claims. 
Thus, when payment was finally received from 
the 
District Office 
or 
Land Office, reimbursement had to be made 
to the political 
party, 
ie 
‘the DAP. 
[109] 
We find this rather odd when the parties involved in this process 
were unable to exclude political parties from involvement in government 
projects. The allocation was from the budget of the state government. 
lt was supposed 
to 
be spent 
for the 
residents 
living 
in 
a 
particular 
area 
in the state. A political party should not be involved 
in assisting 
financially 
in such activities. Otherwise 
it would attract accusations, as 
it did 
in this case, 
that such fund 
or part of 
it was channelled back 
to the political party. We are unable to comprehend here as to why a 
contractor or an agent undertaking to stage 
a programme or to carry 
‘out a small project required the financial assistance of a political party 
to tide him over for the period while awaiting payment from the District 
Office or Land Office. Surely anyone doing business should have capital 
of his own 
or should 
make arrangements for the same. 
[110] 
Further, Lee had subsequently provided to 
1O Shafik a number 
of receipts issued 
by the DAP 
for the reimbursement 
of the monies 
advanced after HQ had taken over the investigation of the case. 
But 
none of the receipts was an exact match to the amount reimbursed to 
the DAP as listed out 
in the first page of each of the exhibits 
| 206A, 
34


| 206B, 
| 206C and 
| 206D. 
Nevertheless, despite this and based on 
‘the explanation provided 
by 
Lee, and the non-availability 
of TBH 
as 
an important witness, 
the MACC decided 
that the 
investigation 
into 
the suspected impropriety as 
to the use 
of YB Ean’s allocation 
be 
stopped. 
Lee Kee Hiong [“Ms Lee”] 
[111] 
Ms Lee 
is the niece of Lee. She 
is a Klang municipal councillor 
and an active member of the DAP. She was the general manager of 
DAP Malaysia from 2003 to 2008. 
[112] 
Ms Lee described herself as a programme co-ordinator and had 
worked as part-time staff in her uncle’s set-up WSK Services and Hong 
Chae Enterprise [in the latter of which Lee and Wong Hong Chae were 
~ 
in some sort of partnership]. She focused only on programmes where 
payments were made from 
the allocation. We believe that while Lee 
took care of the paperwork, 
Ms Lee did the groundwork, 
like getting 
the suppliers, arranging for services, ensuring attendance of participants 
and arranging 
the 
publicity 
for the programmes. When YB Ean 
had 
an idea for a programme with 
a budget, she would be contacted and 
would 
try to work within the amount allotted 
for 
it. She claimed that 
she also prepared 
the accounts for the programme that was carried 
out. She was also the author of the first page of each of the four sets 
of documents [exhibits 
| 206A, 
| 206B, 
| 206C and 
| 206D). 
[113] 
Although 
Ms 
Lee 
insisted 
that 
she 
did 
not 
solicit 
for these 
programmes, records showed that most of them were given 
to either 
Hong Chae Enterprise or WSK Services. 
[114] 
Ms Lee said that she had known TBH when he was 
a reporter 
and was instrumental 
in getting 
him 
to join the DAP 
as 
a member. 
Though Ms Lee maintained that she did 
not discuss the price of the 
programmes with TBH, she contradicted 
herself when she said 
that 
TBH 
had given 
his 
opinion 
at times 
that some items charged were 
excessive. 
35


  
  
[115] 
Counsel for the MACC suggested that there were improprieties in 
the staging of the programmes where there could have been kickbacks 
to the DAP from the expenditure incurred. He applied to us to demand 
from Lee receipts 
to match each advance made by the DAP and the 
Subsequent reimbursement 
for 
it. We refused 
his application 
on 
the 
ground that this was not within our terms of reference. Further, 
if the 
MACC had desired to pursue 
its investigation into this, 
it could have 
exercised 
its discretion to do so rather than to make use of the RCI. 
Mohd Harun Abdullah [“Harun” 
{116] 
Harun was candid enough 
to admit that he had arranged with 
Lee for the use of a number of bumiputra firms to carry out projects 
under the allocation. To this end he had set up firms where his wife and 
relatives were proprietors. He could not be a proprietor because he was 
blacklisted by the banks from operating a bank account. The operators 
of the bank accounts for these firms were the actual proprietors but 
in 
- practice Lee controlled the bank accounts. The proprietors would sign 
blank cheques which Harun would then hand over to Lee. None of the 
proprietors or Harun himself had carried out any of the works awarded. 
As consideration for this arrangement, Harun would receive 5% to 10% 
of the amount paid for each project as commission. Examples of this 
were reflected 
in exhibits | 206A, 
| 206B, 
| 206C and 
| 206D, though 
involving different firms. 
[117] 
At the request of the Selangor MACC, Harun arrived at the 14" 
floor of Plaza Masalam 
at about 3.00pm on the 15". He was made to 
wait in the waiting room while the officer in charge seemed to “keluar 
masuk, keluar masuk” [“moving 
in and out”] except to engage with him. 
He could not understand this when 
it was the Selangor MACC which 
had wanted him to be present for questioning. 
He felt very anxious. 
It 
was not until after some four hours later at 7.00pm that he was called 
in for questioning. This only took an hour. 
It was finished by 8.00pm. 
The officer who recorded his statement did not tell him to leave. Instead, 
36


  
he was informed to wait for Lee to come back from Seremban before 
he could go. This was a clear and obvious indication of cross-checking 
one witness's statement with that of another which was being carried 
out by those involved 
in the operation on the evening of the 15" and 
into the 16". 
[118] 
After Harun’s statement was recorded, he was asked to wait 
in 
an area outside Nadzri’s room where there was a sofa. At about 2.00am 
on the 16" when there was still no indication that he would be released, 
he used his mobilephone [which surprisingly was not confiscated] to call 
a friend who worked 
in HQ. He related his predicament to her, 
a lady 
by the name of Saemah. Saemah asked to speak directly to any of the 
officers 
in the premises. Harun then opened the door to a room nearby 
and found TBH having 
his statement recorded. The officer recording 
TBH's statement asked him to look for another officer to attend to him. 
-He then found another officer who happened to pass by and handed 
him 
his mobilephone 
for the 
officer 
to speak 
to Saemah. After 
this 
conversation between the officer and Saemah, 
Harun was released. 
This was further confirmation 
that 
a witness was 
not allowed 
to 
go 
home after his statement had been recorded. 
In Harun’s case, 
if not 
for the intervention of Saemah, Harun would have been forced to wait 
into the morning 
of the 16", as happened with the other witnesses. 
Decision on the second term of reference 
[119] 
Having considered 
all 
the evidence 
in 
its 
entirety, we found 
that TBH was driven 
to commit suicide by the aggressive, relentless, 
oppressive and unscrupulous interrogation to which he was subjected 
by certain 
officers 
of the MACC who were involved 
in 
the ongoing 
operation by the Selangor MACC on the night of the 15" and into the 
morning of the 16". 
[120] 
Our reasons to support this finding are as follows. 
37


  
  
Forensic pathological aspects 
Chronology 
[121] 
Soon after the body of TBH was discovered, forensic pathologists 
Dr Khairul Azman Ibrahim [“Dr Khairul’] from Hospital Tengku Ampuan 
~ Rahimah, Klang [“the Kiang hospital’] and Dr Prashant Naresh Samberker 
[“Dr Prashant’] from the University 
of Malaya Medical Centre were 
called 
in to assist in the investigations. 
[122] 
Dr Khairul 
and 
Dr Prashant examined the body 
at the scene 
at 7.30pm on the 16. Rigor mortis was established 
in 
all the limbs. 
The body was then transferred 
to the Klang hospital 
for postmortem 
examination at 9.10pm on the 16". They jointly conducted the autopsy 
on TBH at 12.00pm on the 17" and a joint report was produced by them 
on the 24'July 2009. That report was produced before us as exhibit 
| 
42. 
[123] 
During the inquest the coroner, prompted 
by an opinion given 
on 
the 
first postmortem 
examination 
by one 
Dr Khunying 
Porntip 
Rojanansunan 
[“Dr 
Porntip”], 
a forensic 
pathologist from Thailand, 
who was engaged 
by the State government of Selangor, ordered 
Dr 
_Shahidan Mohd Noor [“Dr Shahidan’] to conduct a second postmortem 
examination on TBH. Dr Porntip had opined that TBH had been beaten 
with a piece of wood over the back of the thighs, an object had been 
thrust up his anus and that he had been manually strangled. 
[124] However, 
it must be emphasised that Dr Porntip was not present 
at the first postmortem examination conducted at the Klang hospital and 
she based her opinion on photographs and the first postmortem report 
which had been sent to her. These photographs had been taken by the 
police and were somewhat lacking in clarity. Dr Prashant had taken his 
own photographs at the first postmortem examination but these were 
~ 
not tendered at the inquest. We came to know of their existence when 
38


  
  
Dr Prashant informed 
us during this inquiry that he had, on 
his own, 
taken photographs as well. By consent of all parties, the photographs 
taken by Dr Prashant were tendered in evidence before us and marked 
as exhibit 
| 190. The importance of these photographs became evident 
during 
the testimony 
of the forensic pathologists before 
us and 
will 
be elaborated upon later 
in this report. The photographs taken 
by Dr 
Prashant were admittedly clearer and of better quality than those taken 
by the police and sent to Dr Porntip. 
[125] 
Dr Shahidan conducted the second postmortem 
at the Sungai 
Buloh Hospital on the 22" November 2009. He produced an undated 
report which we marked as exhibit 
| 82. 
[126] 
Present at the second postmortem examination was Professor Dr 
Peter Vanezis [“Professor Vanezis”] from the United Kingdom [“the UK*] 
who attended the examination as an observer on behalf of the MACC. 
He later produced 
a report dated the 16" December 2009 which was 
marked 
as exhibit 
| 
90. 
Dr Porntip was also present as an observer 
on behalf of the State government of Selangor. She later produced 
a 
report dated the 25" January 2010. 
This was marked as exhibit 
| 89 
in the inquiry before us. 
[127] 
At the coroner’s inquest, 
a barrage 
of questions was directed 
at the forensic pathologists we have mentioned above, 
exploring 
in 
minutiae the various possibilities of how the death of TBH could have 
come about. They verged on the realm of speculation which we should 
avoid. We had instead focused on probabilities based on the evidence 
before us and not on possibilities. For this we shall deal with the various 
aspects of the case. 
Time of death 
[128] 
Except 
for 
Dr Porntip, 
all 
the other forensic pathologists who 
testified 
before 
us agreed 
that the estimated 
time 
of death 
of TBH 
39


  
was between 7.15am and 11.15am 
on the 
16". 
Dr Porntip said 
that 
she was unable to give her views on this because she had not been 
physically present 
at the 
material time 
to see the body 
of TBH. As 
both 
Dr Prashant and 
Dr Khairul were at the scene not long after 
its 
discovery we considered that the time of death of TBH was as stated 
~ 
by them. 
Position of the body when found 
[129] 
The position of TBH’s body when found on the 5* floor of Plaza 
Masalam 
on the 
16" was eight feet 
six inches from 
the wall 
of the 
building and three feet six inches from the outer boundary wall. 
[130] 
According to the evidence of all the forensic pathologists taken 
together with the pattern of injuries sustained by TBH, which we shall 
discuss 
shortly, 
the injuries sustained 
by TBH were consistent with 
those 
of a person falling from 
a height. 
Further, one 
Dr Sallehuddin 
Muhamad [“Dr Sallehuddin”], an associate professor at the University 
of Technology Malaysia, who had carried out simulation tests at Plaza 
Masalam on falling objects, also confirmed that based on the position 
- 
where TBH’s body was found, TBH would have fallen from 
a height 
and from 
a window above, which was believed to be the one marked 
as.| 63j on the sketch plan [exhibit 
| 63] of the Selangor MACC office 
on the 14" floor of Plaza Masalam. The height of the window on the 
14" floor from the level at which TBH’s body was found on the 5" floor 
measured one hundred and eight feet. 
[131] The window on the 14" floor was directly above the place where 
TBH’s body was found. The window had a width of two feet ten inches 
and opened out swivelling upwards from the bottom. 
It opened out to 
a maximum extent of three feet eight inches when fully extended to an 
angle of forty-five degrees. According 
to Professor Vanezis, 
a person 
would have been able to climb out of this window when 
it had been 
opened and extended. 
Since 
this window was 
directly above where 
40 
TO 
a 
  
 


  
TBH’s body was found, we believe that TBH must have exited from 
this 
site. 
Further, various MACC 
officers who were familiar with 
the 
area had testified that this window was never locked. 
It was frequently 
opened by officers for ventilation when smoking 
in the area. 
Pattern of injuries 
[132] 
TBH suffered fractures of the bones of the legs and feet. Some 
of these fractures were seen on x-rays 
to be overlapping each other 
in that the bones were out of their natural alignment as a result of the 
fall from 
a height which TBH sustained, as agreed by all the forensic 
pathologists who testified before us. When TBH fell, he landed feet first 
on the ground, leading to severe fragmented fractures of the bones of 
the feet with overlapping fractures of both lower limb bones. 
It was also 
agreed 
by them that TBH was conscious when 
he fell. According 
to 
Professor Vanezis, TBH was consciously trying to absorb the pressure 
of the 
fall as an instinctive reaction. We are 
in complete agreement 
with this view and conclude that TBH fell from the window on the 14" 
floor and was conscious when he fell. 
[133] 
TBH also suffered fractures in the pelvic region. They were mainly 
of the sacrum 
and 
the coccyx. 
In respect 
of these, 
all 
the forensic 
pathologists agreed that they were due to the initial impact of the fall 
when TBH landed on his feet and buttocks almost simultaneously. 
[134] 
Further injuries suffered by TBH were fractures of the ribs and 
manubrium 
sterni [chest bone]. However, 
the x-rays 
of the chest by 
themselves did not reveal 
a fracture of the manubrium sterni. But Dr 
Prashant maintained that such fracture was due to the bending outwards 
at the junction of the manubrium and sterni and would not have shown 
up on the x-rays. We agree with him since the junction of the manubrium 
and 
sterni 
is 
a cartilage and 
it would have caused 
a sublaxation 
in 
this region, resulting 
in 
a fracture. Such a fracture together with those 
of the 
ribs 
in our opinion was consistent with TBH having falien from 
41


  
a height owing 
to the force transmitted upwards from the legs to the 
chest when the body hit the ground. 
[135] 
TBH also had linear fractures 
of the skull and haemorrhaging 
on the surface of the brain. According to Dr Prashant and Dr Khairul, 
these fractures were due to the transmitted forces from the legs upwards 
through the mandible [jaw bone] and into the skull as a result of the 
fall. Professor Vanezis was more general 
in his opinion and explained 
that these fractures were due to secondary impact as a consequence 
of the fall. Dr Porntip, however, attributed this to a pre-fall injury, 
ie of 
TBH having been 
hit by a blunt object before he fell. 
[136] 
We disagree with 
Dr Porntip. 
If TBH 
had been 
hit 
by 
a blunt 
object and had suffered such severe injury of the head, he could 
not 
have consciously walked 
to the window to exit therefrom. And 
if, 
on 
the other hand, TBH 
had 
been unconscious and thrown 
out 
of the 
window, 
he would 
not have landed 
first on 
his feet and then on 
his 
buttocks almost simultaneously, and finally on his hands. According to 
Professor Vanezis, the duration TBH to impact the ground in a 
fall from 
a height of one hundred and eight feet would have been 
at a rate of 
approximately thirty-two feet per second. This would 
not have given 
him sufficient 
time 
to 
recover consciousness 
to take 
the 
instinctive 
defensive action that he took 
in attempting to break his fall. 
[137] 
On the other hand, 
if TBH had been conscious and forced out 
of the window, there would most probably have been 
a struggle with 
his aggressors. 
Inevitably, 
this would 
have resulted 
in TBH having 
defensive 
injuries on 
his body, 
indicating 
a struggle. There were 
no 
such injuries found by the forensic pathologists. Then there would also 
possibly have been foreign sources 
of deoxyribonucleic acid ["DNA’] 
transmitted onto his body and clothing by the aggressors. But Dr Seah 
Lay Hong [“Dr Seah’], a forensic scientist from the chemistry department 
who conducted the DNA analysis on TBH and his clothing, detected no 
foreign sources 
of DNA in the fingernail clippings 
of TBH and on the 
42 
 


  
back outer side of his jacket except for one which later turned out to 
be that of a person known as Gopala. This person had died as a result 
of a road accident and 
a postmortem examination was carried out on 
him just prior to that on TBH. Hence, there had been contamination of 
that portion of TBH’s jacket as a result of the transmission thereon of 
Gopala’s DNA, owing to the postmortem table not having been scrubbed 
clean completely. 
{138] 
When Dr Prashant and Dr Khairul conducted the first postmortem 
-examination on TBH, they found a fracture of the mandible [jaw bone] with 
bruising 
in the region. From the photographs taken at this postmortem 
by 
Dr Prashant, 
they noticed 
a very 
light pink stain over the neck 
region. Dr Prashant, Dr Khairul and Professor Vanezis attributed this to 
hypostasis, 
ie postmortem staining. Dr Porntip, however, held the view 
that this was due to manual strangulation. Based on the evidence 
of 
the other forensic pathologists, we were unable to accept her view as 
the clear photographs taken by Dr Prashant were proof that the blood 
in this area had seeped into the muscles as a result of the fracture of 
the mandible, leading to postmortem staining. 
[139] 
We found 
Dr Porntip’s view 
to 
be extremely speculative 
and 
therefore unacceptable. 
In our opinion, this light pink stain on the neck 
was most certainly due to postmortem staining. 
It could not have been 
the result of a bruise as claimed by Dr Porntip since 
it was not seen 
by 
Dr Prashant and 
Dr Khairul 
at the 
first postmortem examination. 
This stain was due to the blood from the fracture of the mandible [jaw 
bone] seeping 
into the region 
of the neck, simulating 
a bruise 
after 
TBH had died. 
{140] 
Our view 
is further reinforced 
by Professor Vanezis who said 
that 
if TBH 
had 
been strangled 
before 
his death, 
there would 
have 
been 
petechial haemorrhages 
in the eyes [pinpoint bleeding 
spots]. 
Such spots were completely absent in TBH’s eyes, a fact that even Dr 
Porntip admitted. 
43


  
[141] 
Another factor that ruled out manual strangulation was the absence 
of a fracture of the hyoid bone and laryngeal cartilages [structures in the 
neck]. These would have been damaged had strangulation occurred. 
[142] 
From the photographs taken at the first postmortem examination, 
there were tramline abrasions measuring 
two centimetres 
by 
a_ 
half 
centimetre found over the chest region 
of TBH. The Bar voiced 
its 
suspicion that this could have been caused by physical abuse inflicted 
on TBH 
before he died. But this suspicion was demolished when both 
Professor Vanezis and Dr Porntip said that these tramline abrasions 
were caused 
by the folding and creasing of the clothes worn by TBH 
at the time when he fell. 
Clothing and personal belongings 
[143] 
Photographs taken at the scene where TBH fell and during the first 
postmortem examination showed a number of tears on TBH’s trousers. 
The first was right across the buttock region. Another was at the knee 
area. The third was beside the zipper of the trousers. According to all 
the forensic pathologists, 
such damage 
to 
the clothing 
is commonly 
seen 
in cases of a 
fall from 
a height. This would have included the 
belt which TBH was wearing which was severed near the buckle. 
[144] 
The 
Bar further voiced 
its suspicion 
that this tear on the 
belt 
could have been caused by TBH being held dangling by the belt out 
of the window on the 14" floor and that the 
belt snapped under 
his 
weight. We do not believe this was the case as there was no evidence 
in support of this, and further both Professor Vanezis and Dr Porntip 
acknowledged that such tear in the belt would be common 
in cases of 
_ 
falls from heights resulting from forces exerted during the fall. 
[145] 
Still on the belt, Dr Seah found three contributors of male DNA 
types on it. Two of the contributors were identified. One was TBH himself 
and another was Gopala. Then there was the third which Dr Seah said 
she could not identify against all those whose DNA samples she had 
44 
 


  
taken. This included all the MACC officers who had been involved in the 
case as well as the police officers and hospital personnel who had come 
into contact with TBH after his death. 
By this process of elimination, 
we exclude the possibility of any of the MACC officers involved in this 
case from having resorted to such techniques as holding TBH by the 
belt and dangling him from a height. 
Conclusion on forensic pathologists’ evidence 
[146] 
Having considered 
the evidence as 
a whole on 
this aspect of 
the case, we hold the view that TBH fell out of the window on the 14! 
floor of Plaza Masalam on the morning 
of the 16" directly above the 
place where his body was found later. 
Interrogation 
[147] 
TBH was taken to the Selangor MACC office for questioning just 
before 6.00pm 
on the 
15". 
His attendance, though purportedly upon 
invitation, was secured through 
insistent pressure 
unlike 
Lee’s 
and 
Harun’s attendance where they turned up voluntarily as requested. 
In 
_TBH’s case, he was accompanied by the MACC officers to the Selangor 
MACC office after a commotion and some unpleasant exchanges and> 
arguments 
at the SUK building. 
In 
fact, 
he was escorted there. We 
were not surprised that given the harassed condition he was in, he was 
unsettled when he met Anuar in the reception area on the 14 floor of 
Plaza Masalam. He was forced to go immediately and his mobilephone 
was confiscated by Anuar. To add to this, Manoharan who did turn up 
at the Selangor MACC was not allowed to see TBH as promised. TBH 
was kept in the dark of this fact by the MACC officers. 
First Interrogation 
[148] 
Then TBH was taken to the Pen Mas area. There he underwent 
a so-called “calming therapy” designed 
by Anuar. 
Instead 
of leaving 
TBH alone to ease his nerves as 
a reasonable man would 
left him 
to 
45


  
do, TBH was verbally assaulted by a pack of officers numbering six to 
seven at one time or other during this period who were told to “chat” 
with 
him “to calm 
him down”. 
Repeated questions from them 
of his 
background were asked. This could have been easily secured by Azhar 
who was officially told by Anuar to carry out this task. 
[149] Though Anuar, the creator of this method of interrogation, pleaded 
ignorance 
of this inhume treatment, we 
are 
of the view 
that 
it was 
done with a particular objective: 
to break down TBH’s resistance and 
to force him to say what they wanted. 
An indication of this was what 
happened 
at the time when TBH 
first arrived 
at the Selangor MACC 
office. Anuar who met him 
at the reception area immediately asked 
TBH what he could do to help. This 
is something unusual to do when 
you invite someone to your premises. 
[150] 
To our mind, 
this was 
a tacit invitation 
by Anuar hinting 
that 
TBH should “rat” on his boss, YB Ean, so that TBH would be able to 
extricate himself from the oppressive atmosphere that he found himself 
in, having regard to the fact that TBH had already had had a run-in with 
Anuar at the SUK building when the intention of the Selangor MACC 
to target YB Ean had become apparent. 
[151] 
The therapeutic treatment designed by Anuar to calm TBH down 
through a “chat” at the Pen Mas area must have had a profound effect 
on him. He had to endure this torture for four hours. As observed by 
his “companions” of this “chat”, TBH was reserved, quiet most of the 
time, kept to himself, and only answered questions when asked. Such 
a description 
of TBH’s mocd 
fits the characteristics 
of a person who 
was being intimidated. 
Second Interrogation 
[152] 
The second stage 
of the 
interrogation came from Arman 
and 
Ashraf. Though these MACC officers attempted to describe this process 
46 
 


  
as an interview we find 
it to be more 
like an inquisition. 
Arman and 
Ashraf assumedc the role of inquisitors. They turned the four files over 
to: TBH and demanded that he find for them matching documents 
to 
those obtained from TBH’s laptop. They then went further by picking out 
suspicious documents from the four files and demanded an explanation 
from TBH without first investigating into the matter themselves. 
In fact, 
they exceeded the instructions given to them by Hairul Ilham to only 
find documents in the four files which corresponded to those from TBH’s 
laptop. 
[153] 
Further, 
during 
this process, Arman and Ashraf would 
have 
instilled doubts and fear into TBH by declaring that Treasury directives 
require 
for the 
calling 
of three tenders before 
a contract could 
be 
awarded. There was also 
a claim by them that some of the contracts 
had exceeded the permitted limit of RM10,000.00. Of course this was 
not true. Under 
a Selangor government circular dated the 13' August 
2008, namely, Surat Pekeliling Perbendaharaan 
Bil 
6 Tahun 2008 
[in 
English, Treasury Circular Letter No 
6 of 2008], YB Ean could award 
a contract directly 
to 
any contractor without 
the need 
for 
a tender 
exercise, and further the permitted maximum 
price for each 
of these 
contracts had been increased to RM20,000.00. 
[154] 
Perhaps, to give them the benefit of the doubt, both Arman and 
Ashraf may not have known of this. But, as responsible MACC officers 
they should have ascertained what the real position was before making 
such accusations. On the other hand, 
if both Arman and Ashraf had 
known about 
this, then they were intentionally exploiting TBH’s 
lack 
of knowledge 
or ignorance with false information deliberately aimed 
at confusing him. This was deplorable and must have caused severe 
anxiety to TBH as reflected in his conversation with Lee soon after this 
interrogation session. According to Lee, TBH would not have been in a 
position to know the detailed requirements for projects and programmes 
and 
that 
he, 
Lee, would 
have been 
the 
best person 
to have been 
questioned about this. 
47


  
[155] Another aspect of this interrogation 
of concern was the 
ability 
of Arman and Ashraf to extract from TBH 
his password 
to his private 
email account. To many of us, this may be equivalent to disclosing our 
pin number of our ATM card. At least in the case of an ATM card, the 
extractor may be allowed to withdraw a limited amount of our money at 
any one time before such unauthorised access 
is reported. But 
in the 
case of an email account, 
all our personal information and data would 
be exposed immediately and permanently. This 
is 
a gross violation of 
a person’s rights. TBH would have been very disturbed over this and 
his disappointment and regret 
in divulging his password to Arman and 
Ashraf was further mirrored 
in his conversation with Lee. 
[156] 
We are 
of the view that this regret and concern 
of TBH over 
these matters remained festering within him. An indication of this could 
be seen from his behaviour when his statement was being recorded by 
Nadzri. This was further reflected in his being silent and being 
deep in 
thought when he met Tan Boon Wah near the toilet. Instead of being 
excited and surprised to see a fellow individual 
in a similar distressful 
situation, 
he maintained 
a distance and was virtually silent. 
[157] From 
the evidence adduced, we 
are 
of the opinion 
that both 
Arman and Ashraf were specially selected 
by HH 
[though disguised 
as instructions coming from Hairul Ilham] to carry out this interrogation 
of TBH. They did not ostensibly happen 
to be there and available as 
everyone else was busy. 
In fact there was an excess of officers that 
evening, so much so that many were told 
to go home after a certain 
time. But Arman and Ashraf were instructed to remain for this special 
task despite both having 
prior engagements 
to attend court hearings 
the next day. 
[158] 
HH must have realised that this was an important and delicate 
task to 
be performed 
since TBH was most 
likely the “go-between” 
person 
of YB Ean 
in relation 
to the contractors or suppliers. And 
for 
HH to find evidence to prove his suspicion, he had to focus on TBH to 
- disclose any irregularities or perceived irregularities that may have been 
48 
  
 


  
committed by YB Ean regarding the allocation. Arman was certainly a 
bully and Ashraf, going by past records, was known to be successful in 
securing evidence, according to his superior Hairul Ilham. Furthermore, 
. 
_Arman and Ashraf knew each other well and had worked very well 
together previously as stated by Arman. From police records tendered 
in this inquiry by one DSP Kamaruddin Awang from the Selangor police 
criminal investigation section, out of the twenty cases reported against 
the Selangor MACC officers for assault, Ashraf was involved in fourteen 
of them and was positively identified by 
a majority 
of those who had 
made the reports against him. 
[159] 
From 
this, we doubt Ashraf’s 
role that evening was limited 
to 
that of an office boy, just tagging documents shown to him by Arman, 
and that he took no part in questioning TBH. Such perfunctory work, 
in 
our opinion, did not require one person specifically to perform. Arman 
could have done this himself since he had handed over the four files 
to TBH 
to do the work for him. There was no need for Ashraf to be 
present unless he had a more active role to play. From the way Ashraf 
answered questions by giving selective answers due to feigned memory 
loss at appropriate times, we found his evidence most unreliable. Having 
taken into account all the relevant facts, we conclude that though no 
force involving physical violence may have been applied 
to TBH that 
evening, threats of physical harm were most probably used by Arman 
and Ashraf when interrogating him. 
Third Interrogation 
[160] 
The 
third 
stage 
of the 
interrogation 
kicked 
in when 
Nadzri 
recorded TBH’s statement. 
Initially, we thought 
this process would 
have 
involved TBH 
repeating 
the answers that 
he had 
given 
to 
the 
questions which 
Arman and Ashraf had asked of him. And, therefore, 
Nadzri would have just repeated 
the same questions and typed 
out 
those answers as previously given. But this turned out to be another 
forum of interrogation. Nadzri started afresh and questioned TBH 
all 
49


  
over again. This covered even 
his background which TBH had spent 
- 
four hours earlier repeatedly relating 
to the 
six to seven 
officers 
at 
- the Pen Mas area where he was first taken. Proof of this can be seen 
from TBH’s statement [exhibit 
| 69] recorded by Nadzri. Though Nadzri 
may have been assisted by Arman’s notes taken during Arman’s and 
Ashraf’s interrogation of TBH, yet Nadzri took two hours to accomplish 
his mission which often times as disclosed previously was very tiring for 
both parties. In fact we were puzzled over this inordinate length of time 
taken. 
If Arman and Ashraf had asked 
all the pertinent questions and 
TBH had provided the answers 
[if we are to believe Hairul IIham who 
Stated that he was satisfied that TBH was ready to have his statement 
recorded], then this process should have been over in next to no time 
unless of course: (a) Arman and Ashraf had not been asking questions 
directly related to the documents, thus requiring Nadzri to start afresh, 
or (b) Nadzri deliberately prolonged this process to torture TBH mentally 
and disorientate him to agree to turn against his boss out of despair. 
[161] 
In the course 
of examining 
this 
aspect 
of the evidence, we 
failed 
to understand why the Selangor MACC adopted this approach 
of assigning 
a first 
set 
of officers 
to do the preliminary interview 
or 
interrogation 
of TBH 
at the 
Pen Mas area, followed 
by another set 
of officers, 
ie Arman and Ashraf, 
to interview or interrogate him 
in 
a 
separate room, and yet have another officer, 
ie Nadzri, 
to repeat the 
same process but this time also 
to record 
his statement. This 
is 
not 
only duplicitous of work but contravenes sections 30 (1) (a) and 30 (8) 
of the MACC Act. 
[162]. Section 30 (1) (a) 
of the MACC Act provides: 
“An officer of the commission investigating an offence under this 
~ Act may order any person to attend before him for the purpose 
of being examined orally 
in relation to any matter which may, 
in 
his opinion, assist in the investigation into the offence.” 
50


  
[163] 
Section 30 (8) of the MACC Act says: 
“An officer of the commission examining a person under paragraph 
(1) (a) shall record 
in writing any statement made by the person 
and the statement so recorded shall be read 
to and signed by 
_ 
the person, and where such person refuses to sign the record, 
the officer shall endorse thereon under his hand the fact of such 
refusal and 
the reasons therefor, 
if any, 
stated 
by the person 
examined.” 
[164] 
From a perusal of these sections, we are of the opinion that the 
law requires an 
officer who calls 
in 
a person 
for examination before 
_ 
him 
to also complete the task 
of recording 
his statement. Based 
on 
this interpretation of the above provisions, we are of the view that what 
Anuar did by sending in a group of interrogators under the pretence of 
calming TBH, followed by Arman’s and Ashraf’s interrogation or inquisition 
of TBH, was against the law. Such unlawful intimidatory tactics would 
have had grave consequences upon his mind and would have been 
a 
culminating factor that drove him to suicide. 
[165] 
Returning to Nadzri’s recording of TBH’s statement, we find that 
this process added further strain and duress on TBH. This, as we have 
said, was the third occasion that TBH was questioned. This time 
it was 
worse. His answers were vetted by Nadzri who then restructured them 
before typing them into his computer for TBH to approve. As we have 
observed, this exercise was demanding with documents having 
to be 
referred 
to and checked. 
And for TBH, we find that he would have 
had to be careful with his answers since they were reduced to writing 
and could be used to incriminate him as well as others. Taken 
at this 
time of the night and soon after the tormenting repeated interrogating 
experiences, TBH had reacted aggressively to cause Nadzri to remark, 
“Kalau you penat, saya pun penat juga sebab saya taip statement” ["/f 
you are tired, 
| am tired also because 
| am typing the statement’). This 
must have been the reaction of Nadzri 
in response to some words or 
51


  
acts by TBH. From this we can gather that TBH was utterly frustrated, 
disappointed and angry. Further with such an utterance from Nadzri 
in 
the form 
of a rebuke, TBH could have been driven further to want to 
“escape” from 
it all. 
_ {166] 
What we have described up to this stage are without doubt, 
in 
our opinion, factors contributing immensely to TBH’s decision 
to take 
his. life. However, we believe that there must have been something that 
_ 
happened between 3.30am [after the recording of TBH’s statement was 
completed] and 7.00am 
[the earliest estimated time 
of his death] on 
the 16' that broke the camel's back, so to speak, that propelled TBH 
to commit suicide. 
TBH was not released after his statement was recorded 
[167]. 
Contrary to what various officers, particularly Anuar and Nadzri, 
portrayed to the effect that TBH chose to remain in the Selangor MACC 
office after 
his statement had 
been 
recorded, we 
hold 
a completely 
different view. We believe that he was not released. He was still under 
detention by the Selangor MACC. 
[168] 
Our reasons are these. First, TBH’s attendance at the Selangor 
MACC office was practically effected by force. He had no choice as to 
the time of the “interview” and if it was convenient for him. Evidence has 
shown that he had no choice but to follow Anuar and his men immediately. 
On top of that, he was also escorted. Under such circumstances we 
cannot for a moment perceive that TBH would have desired to remain 
a single minute longer 
if he was indeed free to go. 
In fact this desire 
of his was made known to Sachi when he asked Sachi at the Pen Mas 
area as to when he could go back after having waited for a long time 
there. 
. 
[169] 
Second, 
since cross-checking 
of witnesses’ statements was 
practised 
at the material time, TBH would have had 
to remain 
in the 
52


  
premises 
to wait 
for 
Lee’s 
and Tan 
Boon Wah’s statements 
to 
be 
recorded. Lee only had the recording 
of his statement completed 
at 
5.00am on the 16" and Tan Boon Wah at 11.30am also on the 16". 
[170] 
Third, none of the material witnesses such as Lee, Tan Boon 
-Wah and even Harun was allowed 
to go home after their statements 
had been recorded. As for Harun, he had to use his “connection” to the 
officer at HQ to secure his release. So this effectively demolishes the 
so-called common practice 
in the Selangor MACC that once a witness’ 
statement has been recorded, the witness 
is free to go. 
[171] 
Fourth, 
if TBH 
had 
actually been 
allowed 
to leave 
by Nadzri 
on the purported instruction 
of Anuar, there was no reason why TBH 
should not have been issued with an official notice to bring 
in further 
supporting documents demanded by Nadzri as was done with Tan Boon 
Wah. This would have completed the formality for the exercise of his 
release. 
[172] 
Fifth, there was a written memo issued by HH to all his officers in 
June 2009 that an officer should always accompany a guest or witness 
while he remains on Selangor MACC premises. This came about after 
a previous incident where a visitor at the 14" floor of Plaza Masalam 
had wandered unauthorised into Anuar’s room. Nadzri would not have 
gone against this memo unless he had secured a replacement to keep 
a watch over TBH 
until he left. 
[173] 
Certain Selangor MACC officers who testified before us were at 
pains to create an impression that their office was much sought after as 
a place of refuge, for example, 
in the case of Lee to wait for his wife 
to bring documents while lying down uncomfortably on the sofa where 
he just could not sleep due 
to stress; Tan Boon Wah 
not wanting 
to 
go home because he had had an argument with his wife and preferred 
to remain 
in 
his small room and sleep on the floor; TBH not wanting 
to leave because he was too tired or too embarrassed to face YB Ean 
and preferred again the comfort of the sofa outside Nadzri’s room. 
53


  
[174] 
This 
did 
not make sense 
to 
us. Photographs tendered 
of the 
premises revealed that 
it was 
a working 
office. 
It was government 
premises where security and safety should have been paramount. 
it did 
not have the trimmings of a hotel or even 
a resthouse. And given the 
mental condition of these witnesses who were accused of wrongdoing 
instead 
of being asked 
to assist 
in clarifying matters, we believe that 
none of them would have preferred to stay a single minute longer if they 
have been released. The impression given 
by these Selangor MACC 
officers was certainly not acceptable 
to us and 
is an extremely poor 
excuse to support their contention that TBH, Lee and Tan Boon Wah 
were 
at liberty to leave but were so enamoured 
of the MACC office 
and the treatment they received that they chose not to leave despite 
being free to do so. 
HH’s active participation and involvement 
[175] 
HH had, from his own testimony and that of many of his officers, 
been conspicuously absent from 
all 
the ongoing 
activities that went 
on 
in 
his office throughout the evening 
of the 15 and early morning 
of the 16". The impression given was that he stayed cloistered 
in his 
office appearing only on one occasion to go to the toilet and common 
prayer room [surau] and then leaving for home at about 6.26am on the 
16" to take his children 
to school and returning to the office at about 
8.30am that day. According 
to him, he did 
not take an active part 
in 
this operation except to act as a mentor to his subordinates. He did not 
give directions on the mode and form of the interviews or interrogations 
nor did he have knowledge of whe conducted them and 
in respect of 
- whom. He asserted definitely that he did not cross-check on the results 
from the interviews or interrogations at that material time. 
{176] 
We found him to be arrogant, given to falsehoods, untruthful and 
uncompromising 
in 
his stand. 
His falsehoods, particularly 
of his non- 
active involvement 
in 
the entire operation 
at the material time, were 
exposed from the contradictory statements he made before us. But more 
54


  
compelling was the confirmation from two of his own officers, namely, 
Azeem and Azian who were brave enough to reveal towards the later 
part of our proceedings the actual role of HH 
in this operation despite 
the fact that HH was their superior and 
stiil holds 
a senior position 
in 
the MACC as director of the MACC Negeri Sembilan. 
[177]. According 
to 
them, 
HH 
was 
actively 
involved 
in 
the 
entire 
operation from 
the very 
start. 
He was the 
one who gave 
all 
the 
instructions and directions on how the witnesses were to be interviewed 
and interrogated and by whom. HH had attempted to exclude himself 
from this responsibility and instead shift 
it all to Anuar. He had called 
for 
a meeting on the evening 
of the 16" [after the death 
of TBH was 
discovered] of officers from the Selangor MACC who were involved 
in 
the operation to brief them on this. We find no reason to doubt these 
two witnesses. 
In fact, there 
is contemporaneous evidence to support 
this where Azian, worried about this deceit, had texted 
a message to 
Anuar on his mobilephone to urge Anuar to expose the truth of HH’s 
actual involvement. 
[178] 
We will now point out some discrepancies 
in HH’s evidence of 
his 
purported 
non-active involvement. 
First, Anuar 
as 
the 
10 
of the 
operation did not even know that Tan Boon Wah had been brought 
in 
for questioning. This 
is unusual since Anuar was supposed 
to be the 
coordinator. 
[179] 
Second, Bulkini reported to HH directly of the negative result of 
his interrogation of Tan Boon Wah. According to the chain of command 
and for the purpose of co-ordinating the entire operation, Bulkini should 
have told Anuar, and not HH, 
of this. 
[180] 
Third, Anuar was purportedly sleeping 
the entire early part 
of 
the morning of the 16 away despite being 
in charge of synchronising 
the results of the interrogation of the witnesses [TBH, Lee, Tan Boon 
Wah and Harun] who were stil! being detained on the 14" floor of Plaza 
Masalam. 
55


  
[181] 
Fourth, HH had claimed that he did 
not know that the person 
_ whom he saw at the pantry at 5.45am on the 16" was Tan Boon Wah 
and did not question him about his presence there at such an unearthly 
| 
hour. This was most unusual when, just a month earlier in June 2009, 
HH had himself issued a written circular to all his officers that witnesses 
and visitors 
in the Selangor MACC office should 
be accompanied 
at 
all times. 
This purported 
indifferent attitude 
of HH 
in 
relation 
to the 
presence 
of Tan Boon Wah at the pantry implies that he must have 
_ 
known that Tan Boon Wah was 
still around because 
of the ongoing 
operation and he would have 
in fact given direct instructions that Tan 
Boon Wah should not be released. 
[182] 
Sixth, HH admitted that cross-checking of information extracted 
from various witnesses 
in 
the Selangor MACC 
office was 
a norm. 
If 
‘ Hairul I|ham had gone home at around 3.00am and Anuar was sleeping 
throughout the early part of the morning of the 16" and information from 
TBH and Lee and perhaps Tan Boon Wah 
[if he decided to change his 
mind to bend to the wishes of the Selangor MACC officers] was coming 
in, who was then doing the cross-checking? With HH remaining 
in his 
room and being 
passionately involved 
in this operation, 
it would have 
been he who was doing this job. While doing this, he would have also 
given instructions to various officers involved to do what he considered 
appropriate. 
[183] 
We 
did describe 
HH 
as 
being 
passionately involved 
in 
this 
entire operation. From the start we observed that he was convinced 
of the truth of the information he had received. However, he was fully 
aware of the fact that the information was grounded on the belief of 
the informant that Selangor state assemblymen were receiving monies 
from the allocation without the programmes being held or the projects 
being carried out. 
| 
[184] 
| As the information was grounded on 
a mere belief and without 
supporting 
facts, 
HH 
should 
have exercised 
every caution 
as 
the 
56


complaint was serious in nature and involved the State government of 
Selangor because, as practised, the allocation was not available to the 
state assemblymen in the opposition. Instead of carrying out some basic 
groundwork to satisfy himself as to the veracity of that information, he 
launched a 
full-scale operation involving 
a large number of witnesses 
and mobilised the whole Selangor MACC and sought manpower support 
from other MACC offices as well for this purpose. Though documents 
related to claims on the allocation were previously secured from various 
District Offices and Land Offices, these were not thoroughly checked 
as could be seen from the instructions given by Hairul Ilham to Arman 
to check the four files 
for incriminating evidence when 
this should 
have been carried out much earlier. Other examples of an absence of 
groundwork were the instances where Bulkini and Sachi accused Tan 
Boon Wah and Lee respectively of not carrying out certain programmes 
or projects when this ought to have been first verified. 
[185] 
An elementary approach would have been to have interviewed 
various independent persons who had attended the organised functions 
for the programmes 
to check 
if the programmes were 
held 
or 
to 
have visited the project sites to check whether the projects had been 
completed. Such an approach could have also involved the questioning 
of the officers of the District Office or the Land Office who had certified 
that the programmes were held and the projects were carried out. 
[186] 
Next, questions were directed at witnesses pulled in that evening 
of the 15" on the suspected inflated price of items supplied. We are at 
a loss to understand why the Selangor MACC did not check this out 
earlier with various suppliers for such items to find out their market price. 
And even on the suspicion that there were kickbacks to the DAP from 
these programmes and projects, common sense would have dictated 
that 
it would have been prudent to demand from the DAP 
a 
reply 
to 
these allegations and 
to require the production of relevant receipts 
if 
the monies paid 
out to the DAP were indeed the reimbursements 
of 
advances made earlier. 
5/


  
Anonymous letter 
[187] 
In 
the course 
of the 
inquiry, 
an anonymous 
letter dated 
the 
5" August 2009 
on the letterhead 
of HQ came 
to 
light. Purportedly 
written 
by 
the MACC 
officers 
of Malaysia 
it was addressed 
to 
the 
chief commissioner 
of the MACC. 
It alleged 
the corrupt practices, 
misconduct and abuse 
of power committed 
by HH 
in connection with 
the cases involving TBH and Dato’ Seri 
Dr Mohamad Khir Toyo, the 
former menteri besar [chief minister] of the State of Selangor. HH was 
said to be directly involved 
in the investigation 
in connection with the 
alleged misuse of funds allocated 
to YB Ean. The letter was marked 
as exhibit} 256 in this inquiry. 
[188] 
HH, 
in the course of the inquiry, testified that he was shown the 
letter and 
it was clear that 
it had received the attention of his superior, 
the chief commissioner. However, there was no evidence to suggest that 
a formal investigation on the matter had been carried out, given that 
the MACC has very wide powers to set 
its investigation machinery 
in 
motion. By section 29 of the MACC Act, a report may be made orally or 
in writing, and in the present matter before this RCI, the information that 
set the investigation machinery of the MACC in motion had purportedly 
been conveyed to HH merely over the telephone. 
[189] 
HH 
had been with the MACC 
for about nineteen years 
at the 
material 
time and, 
as 
stated 
earlier, was the deputy director 
of the 
Selangor MACC at the time of the incident, holding the rank of senior 
assistant commissioner 1. 
Based on the evidence gathered during this 
_ inquiry, 
it was clear indeed that HH was in full control of the investigation 
in 
this case, and 
he was 
not merely giving formal directions 
in 
the 
capacity of a superior over his subordinates in the organisation. During 
_the period 
of the operation, twice 
in 
a day, once 
in the morning and 
again 
in the late evening or at night, officers involved 
in the operation 
would brief him of the progress made and he on his part would give 
specific directions 
as 
to 
the further conduct 
of the operation. 
Even 
58


  
when the officers were on the ground, 
they would 
call him 
on their 
mobilephones for directions should they encounter any problem 
in the 
operation, or he would call them to give directions. 
[190] 
In amplification 
of these 
facts, 
it must be noted that HH 
had 
received the information of the alleged corruption involving the Selangor 
state assemblymen 
at 
least 
by 
the 21* June 
2009, 
after which 
he 
_ 
directed Anuar to formally lodge 
a report to initiate investigations into 
the matter and appointed 
him 
as the 
IO. 
On 
13" July 2009, Anuar 
lodged the report adverted to earlier, which sparked off the operation in 
question. 
It was HH who directed Anuar and Hairul to obtain documents 
from the District and Land Offices. According to the evidence, on the 
15" he was in his room throughout the day ostensibly doing his normal 
work while at the same time directing the operation from 5.00pm that 
evening. He never left his room except to go out to the toilet and the 
prayer room [surau] for prayers. 
[191] 
Around 5.45am on the 16", he left his room and then for home 
and returned to the office at 7.15am. He attended the daily briefing by 
the officers involved 
in the operation 
at 8.30am. Around 11.30am, 
he 
left the office for HQ for a discussion on purported unrelated matters 
with 
officers there, 
and 
after that 
he 
left 
for the Attorney-General’s 
office 
in relation 
to other matters. 
En 
route, around 2.00pm, 
he said 
he received a call from Anuar informing him of the death of TBH. He 
directed Anuar and Hairul 
to join him immediately 
at HQ. But before 
they arrived, he and the deputy chief commissioner ieft for the Selangor 
MACC office. 
[192] 
We were unable to accept the testimony of HH as related above 
as the truth, taking into account the activities that were going on during 
the evening of the 15" right up to the morning of the 16" on the 14" 
floor of Plaza Masalam just outside HH’s room. No reasonable man 
would 
be able to accept as true the story 
of HH 
that he was not 
at 
all concerned with what was actually happening 
on 
the premises 
of 
59


  
  
the Selangor MACC right under his nose and which involved several 
witnesses, including TBH, who had been summoned or brought 
in by 
his officers under his direction and were in their care and custody. No 
person in his right mind would believe that HH would have been content 
to just remain 
in 
his room on the same floor where 
all the activities 
referred 
to in this report were going on and was merely waiting to give 
directions 
to the officers involved 
in the operation as and when they 
needed his advice. Such a stance was contrary to his action 
in leaving 
for home 
in the early morning hours of the 16" to take his children to 
school and then rushing to be back in the office for the morning briefing 
on the operation by his officers. This certainly was not the action of 
a man who had no personal interest 
in the ongoing operation, having 
regard to the further fact that he had virtually gone without sleep the 
_ whole of the 15" and the morning of the 16". 
[193] 
On 
the testimony adduced before 
us, however, 
there was 
no 
direct evidence to prove that HH had a hand 
in the death of TBH. But 
as the seniormost officer involved 
in the operation and being physically 
present 
in the office when the officers involved 
in the operation were 
interrogating TBH virtually without 
let, 
he should 
be held responsible 
for the actions taken by him and 
his officers which propelled TBH 
to 
commit suicide. We shall elaborate further on this aspect of the evidence 
under the heading “Fourth interrogation” which now follows, apart from 
what has been stated above. 
Fourth Interrogation 
[194] 
We agree with the submissions of the Bar that HH was just too 
stubborn [such trait was also displayed when he gave evidence before 
us] to retreat from his mistake 
in mounting such 
a massive operation, 
particularly when 
it had received wide and extensive press coverage. 
To overcome his disappointment at the negative results obtained from 
these witnesses up to that stage, he must have resorted to a personal 
and more aggressive interrogation 
of TBH 
since TBH, 
as we have 
60


  
explained, 
held 
the 
vital 
link between YB 
Ean and 
the suppliers 
or 
contractors, and 
if anything were to be made to “stick” on YB Ean, 
it 
would have to be through TBH. 
[195] 
We believe that he must have been assisted upon this foray by 
- Anuar and Ashraf. We name Anuar because his alibi had been proved 
to be false. As disclosed, hardly anyone saw him sleeping at the place 
he claimed to be at between the hours after 3.30am and 7.00am on the 
16". Even guard Khairudin who said that he saw Anuar sleeping 
in the 
visitor's area [ruang fefamu] pointed out an area which was different 
from the area where Anuar claimed to have slept at. The evidence of 
guard Khairudin 
itself was not credible as he was found 
to have with 
him 
a prepared script while testifying 
in the witness box which proved 
beyond peradventure that he had been coached. 
Further, Anuar 
lied 
about the role he had played in order to cover up for HH. And on top of 
these factors, he was a trusted senior officer of HH who was prepared 
to sacrifice himself for HH, the other such officer Hairul Ilham having 
gone home by that time. 
[196] 
As for Ashraf, we found 
it most unusual for him 
to fetch TBH 
a glass 
of water at about 4.40am on the 16". This established three 
things. 
First, Ashraf was around during this time. Second, though TBH 
knew where the pantry was and could have gone there himself to get 
a drink of water, yet he demanded Ashraf’s services. This was most 
extraordinary 
in view of Ashraf’s poor track record on physical abuse 
of suspects, which made 
it unlikely that he would entertain 
a demand 
from a person who was inferiorly situated in relation to him at that point 
in time. 
Though TBH was termed 
a “witness”, 
he was treated more 
like a suspect. Third, was the rather impolite and demanding nature of 
- 
the request: “Hoi! Saya mahu minum air” [“Hoi! 
/ want to drink water’). 
This could be said 
to be downright rude, yet Ashraf complied. From 
this we drew the inference that Ashraf was not thoughtful and generous 
in performing 
this service 
but had done so out of remorse for some 
of the improper things that he and those involved had done 
to TBH 
during the hours of 3.30am fo 7.00am on the 16". 
61


  
  
[197] 
The acts committed by these three persons, namely HH, Anuar 
and Ashraf, were most probably in the form of another round of intensive 
interrogation 
of TBH 
to coerce him 
into making 
a statement 
that 
it 
was YB Ean who directed 
him 
to commit unlawful 
acts 
in handling 
the allocation. This session must have been very taxing on TBH both 
physically and mentally. He had been deprived of sleep throughout that 
night and into the morning and had had to endure persistent, aggressive 
and unscrupulous questioning. His physical condition as described by 
Ashraf when fetching him the glass of water was that TBH had moved 
to sit in an upright position very slowly. This fourth interrogation session, 
to our minds, must have been the final straw that broke the camel’s 
back. 
Raymond 
[198] 
Before we came 
to this finding, we did take into consideration 
the evidence of Raymond who had testified that he saw TBH at 6.00am 
on the 16" lying on the sofa outside Nadzri's room. 
If this was true, 
then TBH must have committed suicide after 6.00am on the 16. This 
would 
fit into the estimated time of death of TBH which was between 
7.15am. and 
11.15am 
on 
the 
16", 
as determined 
by 
the forensic 
pathologists. 
However, despite this, we entertained grave reservations 
over Raymond’s evidence. 
In our opinion, he was not a reliable witness 
and was used by those responsible for TBH’s death to distance them 
from 
their wrongdoings 
by creating 
an impression that TBH was 
not 
only alive at 6.00am on the 16" but was also resting comfortably and 
peacefully on the sofa outside Nadzri’s room. 
[199] 
Raymond 
had 
said 
that 
he 
recognised TBH 
at 6.00am 
that 
morning because 
he had 
first seen him 
prior to this 
in the Pen Mas 
area around 12.00am on the 16" talking to one other Chinese person. 
At that time he had happened to pass by that area on his way to the 
administrative section 
to get some writing paper. 
Next, 
he had said 
that he recognised TBH from “The Star’ news printout shown to him by 
62


  
Anuar earlier, of the latter arguing with Manoharan with TBH standing 
in the. middle. This had been taken at the SUK building. We found this 
claim of Raymond difficult to accept for the following reasons. 
First, 
when Raymond purportedly saw TBH at the Pen Mas area, he did not 
know who TBH was. 
He only had had 
a glance 
at the two Chinese 
persons sitting 
in this area. He had not looked directly at their faces. 
He had only seen their backs and their heads. Second, even though 
TBH’s face appeared 
in the internet news which was downloaded and 
shown 
to him 
by Anuar 
prior 
to 
his coming 
to know that TBH 
had 
died, we doubt that he would have taken particular notice of TBH. The 
focus then was on Anuar who took pains to show off to his colleagues 
that he was being featured 
in the media. Third, the particular location 
where Raymond 
said 
he had seen TBH 
at 6.00am was dark. And 
if 
he had 
not got close to TBH, 
he could not have been certain that 
it 
- 
was indeed TBH. Fourth, what had brought Raymond to the area was 
the coincidence that he was on his way out of the 14 floor of Plaza 
Masalam from his room. This was not his usual route. He said that he 
had 
to come this way because he had forgotten 
to bring his access 
card that was required to open some doors along his normal route. We 
found this strange when other MACC officers informed us that almost 
all the internal doors of the office that evening were disarmed for the 
purpose of the operation 
in order to facilitate the movement of officers, 
including those not from the Selangor MACC office, to enable them to 
move about freely. So this excuse of Raymond to use a different route 
to leave his room was highly suspicious. 
[200] 
Raymond 
in our opinion was used as 
a time-marker by those 
concerned with TBH’s death. Aside from all the contradictions exposed 
to 
support 
our view, 
there was another factor: 
his punch 
card 
to 
indicate the time of his entry into and exit from the office. 
His punch 
card indicates that he had punched out at 6.04am on the 16" and then 
virtually immediately at 6.05am on the same day, 
it shows that he had 
punched 
in again. When questioned on this rather curious act of his, 
he explained that he did so with the intention of not returning 
to the 
63


  
office that day. We found this most illogical. 
First, 
if he was going 
to 
attend court that day during office hours, there was no necessity for 
him to have punched in since 
it would have been physically impossible 
for him to come back to the office while he was in court. Second, 
if he 
had punched 
in to indicate that he was in the office at 6.05am on the 
16", when would he then punch out since he did not intend to return 
to the office that day? We were 
in agreement with the Bar that this 
punching 
in and punching out almost simultaneously was to create the 
firm impression that he was 
in the office at the material time. 
[201] 
As 
it became obvious 
to 
us 
that Raymond’s evidence was 
tailored 
to 
fit certain objectives, which 
in 
this case dovetailed those 
of the MACC officers responsible 
for TBH’s death, we rejected 
his 
evidence as being unworthy of any weight or consideration 
in respect 
of the time he claimed to have seen TBH 
at 6.00am on the 16". 
Forensic psychiatric aspects 
[202] 
To understand the probability that TBH took 
his own 
life, 
the 
traits of his character and the changing states of his mind as a result of 
what he underwent on the 15" and the 16" must be first understood. 
[203] 
Character comprises the aggregate features and traits that form 
the individual nature of a person or thing. 
It is also defined as a moral 
and ethical quality of a person. 
It 
is sometimes used interchangeably 
with the term personality which is the sum total of the physical, mental, 
emotional, and social characteristics of the individual: see 
Dictionary. 
com. 
[204] 
State of mind 
is defined as: 
- 
(a) 
a temporary psychological state; and 
(b) 
the state of the person’s cognitive processes: 
see Dictionary.com. 
64


  
[205] 
An 
individual's 
state 
of mind 
is 
related 
to 
his character and 
personality. Despite the term “mind” which denotes mental status, the 
function and influence of the emotion [which would influence the mind 
in many conditions] must not be ignored. This state of mind 
is most of 
the time predictable, especially in normal and in expected situations. But 
in trying times and when severely-negative life events are experienced, 
such 
as when 
stress 
[physical, emotional 
or mental, 
or 
all 
of them 
together] is overwhelming, the state of mind of the individual could not 
only undergo profound changes but would become unpredictable: see 
Social and Emotional Influences 
on Decision Making and the Brain,

of

[206] 
lt must 
be mentioned 
at 
this juncture 
that the 
state 
of mind 
of an 
individual 
held 
in custody should 
be 
of utmost concern 
to 
his 
custodians. Their sensitivity towards 
the psychological 
state 
of their 
detainee reflects a humanely commendable attitude. This should prevent 
abuse of those held in custody by detainers: see Liability and Wrongful 
In-Custody Deaths by Darrell 
L. Ross, 
in Sudden Deaths in Custody 
by Darell 
L Ross & Theodore C Chan, ed 2006, Totowa, New Jersey, 
Humana Press: 173-202. 
The psychiatrists 
[207] 
To enlighten 
us 
on 
the psychological aspects 
of TBH’s 
mind, 
were three psychiatrists. They were supplied with relevant documents 
tendered 
during 
this 
inquiry 
and 
had 
interviewed 
family members, 
friends and colleagues of TBH. Each of the psychiatrists gave us his/ 
her expert opinion on the matter and these were tendered to us. 
The 
three psychiatrists who submitted their reports to us were: 
(a) 
Dr Badi’ah, 
a forensic psychiatrist and 
Dr Nor Hayati 
Ali 
[‘Dr Hayati"], 
a community psychiatrist from 
the Ministry 
of Health 
of Malaysia, who prepared 
a joint report at the 
request of the MACC; and

Professor Paul Edward Mullen [“Professor Mullen”], Emeritus 
Professor of Forensic Psychiatry, Monash University, Australia, 
who was brought 
in by the Bar and prepared 
a report at 
their request. 
[208] 
In. his report, Professor Mullen furnished the following opinion 
and, made the following observations, which we summarise and also 
- 
quote below. 
[209] 
TBH, according to Professor Muilen, “...was firmly 
in the lowest 
risk group for suicide when he was taken 
into MACC custody.” And 
if TBH 
“...did 
kill 
himself, 
things were 
likely 
to have occurred 
both 
to undermine 
his psychological 
stability and 
to frighten 
him 
literally 
to death. Also, 
his concern for his family, and for his future wife and 
mother of his child, could have been turned into a weapon against him 
by a totally unscrupulous interrogator, as could 
his loyalty and sense 
of responsibility to his colleagues.” 
[210] 
Professor Muilen then stressed that certain interrogation techniques 
would turn “...a law-abiding citizen with no prior experience of being 
in 
the power of apparently unconstrained authority, particularly if they were 
cut 
off from 
all contact with sources 
of help and support...” suicidal 
as “[p]Jeople do 
not 
kill themselves because they have 
a method 
to 
hand, 
they use 
the methods 
at hand 
if they have become 
suicidal. 
The window from which TBH 
fell would have presented an obvious 
and easily accessible method. That there 
is such 
a jarge window so 
easily opened on the 14" floor of any offices, let alone an interrogation 
centre, 
is to me extraordinary.” 
[211] 
Professor Mullen was of the further opinion that “...it would be 
remarkable for anyone to voluntarily remain 
in 
a place where he had 
been interrogated for eight hours in preference to returning home. TBH 
could 
not 
but have been aware 
of the anxiety 
of friends and family 
about his state. Given his enthusiasm for texting and phoning 
it is very 
66


  
difficult to understand that he would 
not have immediately reassured 
them, whatever the time.” 
[212] 
According 
to 
Dr Badi’ah 
and 
Dr 
Hayati, TBH came 
from 
an 
intact family and had a stable job. Having no history of mental illness, 
impulsivity or substance abuse, TBH would be in the low-risk category for 
suicide. 
In fact, he was looking forward to his wedding and his fiancée 
was then pregnant. However, both Dr Badi’ah and Dr Hayati were quick 
with their reservation that nevertheless, “literature review for suicide 
in 
custody showed 
that the protective factors 
in the general population 
may not have the same effect compared to people 
in custody.” 
[213] 
Dr Badi’ah and Dr Hayati further pointed out that during the few 
weeks 
prior to TBH 
being questioned 
by the MACC, 
he had 
had 
to 
face and deal with two life-impacting events which could have added 
stress to his life. These would have changed his habits and demeanour 
subsequently. They were: 
(a) 
the bringing forward 
of the date 
of his wedding from the 
original 
set date 
in 2010 
to 
the 
13" October 2009 upon 
discovering that his fiancée was pregnant; and 
(b) 
the gathering of the documents by the Selangor MACC from 
the District and Land Offices insinuating a misappropriation 
of the allocation by his boss YB Ean. 
According to these two doctors, these could be regarded by TBH as a 
potentially threatening situation. 
Character of TBH 
[214] 
From his family members and friends, we were able to have 
a 
clear description of TBH’s character traits. He was hardworking, diligent, 
responsible, devoted 
to 
his family, loved children, and was faithful 
to 
his boss YB Ean. 
He appeared 
to 
be cruising along fine 
in 
life, and 
67


  
  
there was good reason to believe that the future appeared promising. 
As 
a member of the DAP and the political secretary of YB Ean, TBH 
must have been devoted to its cause. His friends and family members 
found him trustworthy and pleasant. He was seen 
to become angry 
if 
and when the situation warranted 
it. Not known to demonstrate extreme 
emotions, 
he was never seen to succumb to rage. 
Psychological changes 
[215] 
Psychologically, although 
a wedding and the preparation for 
it 
could have been a positive life event for TBH, it could also have brought 
stress to him: see Holmes-Rahe Social Readjustment Rating Scale 
in 
Journal of Psychosomatic Research, (1967) Vol. 11, pp 213-218. Adding 
this to the negative 
life events, 
it could have been worse. 
[216] 
. However, despite the Selangor MACC commencing inquiries and 
| investigation 
in June 2009, 
of which TBH must have become aware, 
he was 
still able 
to take things 
in 
his stride and manage the usual 
stresses and challenges of tife. 
[217] 
But when 
he was taken 
in 
by Anuar on the 
15", TBH shifted 
psychologically from the low-risk group to the high-risk group for suicide. 
We shall now proceed 
to deal with the events which, 
in our opinion, 
pushed him into that stage. 
[218] 
When the MACC officers raided YB Ean’s office and started 
a 
search there, the first person he wanted to contact after communicating 
with his boss, YB Ean, was his lawyer, Manoharan. TBH appeared to 
have been propelled into a fear-inducing situation as shown by the pattern 
of calis that he made when the MACC officers were conducting their 
investigation in the office. He needed reassurance from his colleagues, 
hence the calls he made. He was pacified when given the chance by 
Anuar to discuss his concerns privately for a few minutes with both YB 
Ean and Manoharan 
in the SUK building before he was taken away to 
68


the Selangor MACC office. But when he was not allowed 
to see both 
of them after that when he was 
in the Selangor MACC office, 
he was 
cut off from the outside world. The sense of isolation was intense as 
was demonstrated by his behaviour as described by all those who came 
into contact with him on the 15" and the 16". Added to this was the 
deprivation of the use of his mobilephone. 
[219] 
It was an accepted fact that TBH found companionship 
in 
his 
mobilephone. It was also an instrument most often used by him to relieve 
his stress. The analysis made on TBH’s mobilephone-call pattern showed 
that he would call his friends and family at regular daily intervals. Taking 
his mobilephone away would have meant robbing him of his means to 
reality and sanity. And the MACC officers did just that. Thus, for the 
first time 
in his life, TBH found himself totally and completely isolated 
from the outside world and thrust into desolation. 
[220] 
Another factor which had serious implications 
on TBH was the 
surrendering of his laptop to the officers of the MACC, and worse than 
this was being forced to divuige to the MACC officers the password to 
his email account. As this held the key to many things private, TBH must 
have felt that his privacy was violated under duress, and the secrets of 
his life were in the open. This was a gross violation of TBH’s personal 
right, which would have compounded 
his anxiety and worry. 
[221] 
TBH must have arrived at the Selangor MACC a harassed and 
unsettled man. This turn 
of events 
in 
his 
life was very sudden. 
But 
before he was able to recover, other devastating situations were foisted 
upon him that precipitated him beyond the threshold of his tolerance. 
[222] 
TBH underwent four stages of interrogation as related earlier. His 
interrogators later claimed that these were interviews to extract information 
from witnesses like TBH. But other witnesses testified that techniques 
employed would range from mild interviews to harsh interrogation. All 
these interrogators were known to have applied intimidating approaches 
during the interrogation they carried out. 
69


  
  
  
[223] Even at the outset, the first stage of interrogation was proven to 
be already a psychological burden on TBH. This “therapy” created by 
Anuar lasted for four hours, during which TBH was found to be reserved 
and quiet. Keeping to himself, he was only answering questions when 
asked. 
[224] 
Arman and Ashraf behaved like inquisitors in an inquisition at the 
second stage of the interrogation. They instilled doubts and fear into 
TBH as regards the Treasury directives that required for the calling of 
at least three tenders before a contract could be awarded. But 
if both 
of them intentionally exploited TBH’s ignorance or iack 
of knowledge 
of the new set 
of rulings and directives 
of the State government 
of 
Selangor on this matter, 
their effort to confuse and cause anxiety to 
TBH was most deplorable indeed. 
[225] 
During 
his interrogation, TBH 
had 
to face MACC interrogation 
heavyweights like Arman the bully [who would manipulate his witness 
to obtain evidence], Ashraf the abuser [who was Machiavellian 
in 
his 
method 
to secure evidence] and HH the arrogant leader [who would 
have no qualms in lying as long as his ends were achieved, regardless 
of the means employed]. 
[226] 
HH was described by MACC officer Azian as a workaholic. As a 
boss, he also instilled fear in his officers. Opportunities for promotion 
. 
rested mainly 
in his hands. The whole range of interview-interrogation 
techniques would have been employed by his officers and himself to 
satisfy his desire to obtain results 
in the shortest possible time. Thus, 
it was not 
at 
all surprising that most of his officers, save two strong 
souls [Azeem and Azian] who pointed out the truth, had the inevitable 
habit of lying. 
[227] 
The third stage of interrogation by Nadzri only worsened TBH’s 
plight. This stage only served 
to demonstrate how unscrupulous the 
interrogator could be. Nadzri repeated the whole process of the previous 
70


  
stages 
of questioning 
and 
interrogating TBH. 
He took two hours 
to 
complete an excruciatingly laborious session which proved to be trying 
for both parties. TBH had 
to bear the weight of abusive and intense 
interrogation because he was the vital and sole link between YB Ean 
and 
the contractors and suppliers 
for the projects and programmes. 
Breaking TBH would mean the attainment of a much sought after result 
to get at YB Ean. 
[228] 
Despite the habitual denials by the MACC officers-cum-interrogators, 
it could be safely concluded that their interrogation methods ranged from 
earnest and intensive questioning to outright psychological intimidation 
and physical threats. Since this had been their approach, there was no 
reason to believe that TBH had received different and less aggressive 
treatment as compared with the rest. 
[229] 
By the time the fourth 
or final stage 
of the interrogation was 
over, TBH would have been almost a mental and physical wreck. When 
Ashraf fetched him 
a glass 
of water [demanded 
impolitely by TBH], 
TBH was 
said to have sat up very slowly. 
[230] 
These intense stages of interrogation must have created serious 
doubts 
in TBH’s mind as regards 
his actions 
in relation 
to his duties 
as YB Ean’s political secretary. Signing his name but affixing YB Ean’s 
seal, the absence of at least three quotations before the awarding of 
a project or programme, the alleged kickbacks to the DAP, the direct 
awards of projects, and fixing prices to goods required for projects also 
weighed heavily on his mind. 
Contributing factors 
[231] 
We note that TBH’s relationship with 
his boss, YB Ean, was 
a 
mutually cordial and respectful one. TBH had never been found by his 
family members and close friends to have complained about the latter. 
Thus, attempts 
to plant ideas 
of betrayal 
of his superior would have 
been very stressful to TBH. 
71


  
  
[232] 
There were also other contributing factors such as: 
(a) 
sleep deprivation; 
_(b) 
an uncomfortable and unfamiliar environment; and 
(c) 
being held 
in custody for a long time. 
Conclusion on forensic psychiatric aspects 
[233] 
Tormented 
by this predicament, TBH experienced 
a change 
in 
his state of mind. And 
in 
a matter of hours, this change transformed 
him from being in the low-risk group for suicide into the high-risk group. 
The doubts, extreme emotional 
conflict and 
the immense feeling 
of 
guilt were ail intolerable. Finally, precipitating the irreversible crisis that 
happened 
to him between 3.30am and 7.00am 
on the 16, was 
the 
last straw that broke the camel’s back. Finding no viable strategies to 
surmount the hurdle of accusations levelled, he found himself unable to 
escape from the suffocating quagmire in which he was trapped. Losing 
all hope, TBH would have felt trapped and have succumbed to despair. 
Since the window on the 14" floor was either open or could be easily 
opened and 
it was conspicuous and easily accessible near where he 
was on 
the sofa outside Nadzri’s room, TBH would have found that 
the only way for escape from the torment he was undergoing was by 
jumping out of the window, even though 
it meant taking 
his own 
life. 
First term of reference 
[234] 
In relation to our terms of reference, as stated earlier, we have 
approached the issues by dealing with the second term 
of reference 
first and then with the first. 
To recapitulate, the first term of reference 
reads as follows: 
— 
“1. 
to enquire whether or not there was any impropriety 
in 
the 
conduct of the examination of Teoh Beng Hock in the course 
of an investigation into a Shah Alam report number 0052/2009 
72


  
by the Malaysian Anti-Corruption Commission 
in relation 
to 
its standing 
orders and 
practices and 
to recommend 
any 
appropriate action, where necessary.” 
[235] The facts relating 
to the taking 
of TBH from 
his office on the 
15" floor of the SUK building to the Selangor MACC office on the 15' 
has. been dealt with earlier in this report and we shall not repeat those 
facts here except to allude to them where necessary. 
{236] 
During the course of the inquiry the MACC made available 
to 
this Commission 
its applicable standing orders at the material time of 
the investigation. 
[t also answered certain questions posed and explained 
certain aspects of its operations. 
Search warrant 
[237] 
It was the stand 
of the Selangor MACC that 
all the persons 
who were questioned or interviewed in the investigation then underway 
were called 
in for questioning or interviewing as witnesses and not as 
suspects. However, we note with concern that officers 
of the MACC 
involved in the investigation acted under a misapprehension of the law 
when they purportedly exercised their powers under the MACC Act. 
[238] 
In 
carrying 
out 
their 
raids 
on 
the various places referred 
to 
earlier in this report for the purposes of their investigation, the officers 
purported 
to invoke sections 30 and 
31 
of the MACC Act as well as 
other provisions 
in the Act. 
It was not denied that the officers raided 
the various places without any form of authorisation as required under 
section 31(1) of the MACC Act. For convenience, we reproduce hereunder 
the whole of section 31 which reads as follows: 
“31. 
Power of search and seizure 
(1) 
Whenever 
it appears 
to 
the public prosecutor 
or 
an officer of the commission 
of the rank 
of chief senior 
73


  
_ assistant commissioner or above as authorized by the public 
prosecutor upon information, and after such inguiry as he 
_thinks necessary, that there is reasonable cause to suspect 
that in any place there 
is any evidence of the commission 
of an offence under this Act, he may by written order direct 
an officer of the commission to 
—- 
(a) 
(b) 
(c) 
(d) 
(e) 
enter any premises and there search for, seize and 
take possession 
of, any book, document, record, 
account or data, or other article; 
inspect, make copies of, or take extracts from, any 
book, document, record, account or data; 
search any person who is in or on such premises, 
and for the purpose of such search detain such 
person and remove him to such place as may be 
necessary to facilitate such search, and seize and 
detain any article found on such person; 
break open, examine, and search any article, container 
or receptacle; or 
stop, search and seize any conveyance. 
(2) 
Whenever 
it 
is necessary so 
to 
do, 
an 
officer of the 
commission exercising any power under subsection 
(1) 
may- 
(a) 
(b) 
break open any outer or inner door or window of any 
premises and enter therein to, or otherwise forcibly 
enter the premises and every part thereinto; 
remove by force any obstruction 
to such entry, 
search, seizure or removal as he is empowered to 
effect; or 
74


  
(c) 
detain any person found in 
or on any premises, 
or in any conveyance, searched under subsection 
(1), 
until such premises or conveyance has been 
searched. 
(3) 
Whenever it appears to an officer of the commission that 
there is reasonable cause to suspect that there is concealed 
or deposited in any place any evidence of the commission of 
any offence under this Act and such officer has reasonable 
grounds for believing that, by reason of delay in obtaining 
a written order of the public prosecutor or an officer of the 
commission of the rank of chief senior assistant commissioner 
or above under subsection 
(1), 
the object of the search 
is 
likely to be frustrated, he may exercise in and in respect of 
such place, all the powers mentioned in subsections (1) and 
(2) as if he were directed to do so by an order issued under 
subsection (1). 
(4) 
No person shalf be searched under this section except 
by a person who is of the same gender as the person to be 
searched.” 
[239] 
Section 31(1) enables the public prosecutor [which would include 
a deputy public prosecutor], 
or an officer of the MACC of the rank of 
chief senior assistant commissioner or above who has been authorised 
to that effect by the public prosecutor, 
to empower an 
officer of the 
MACC 
to act under section 31. 
It 
is to be noted that the officer who 
purports to act under section 31 
must 
in the first place be authorised 
by the public prosecutor to do so only upon information which 
is to be 
conveyed to the public prosecutor and after such inquiry as the public 
prosecutor thinks necessary to satisfy him that there is reasonable cause 
to suspect that 
in any place there 
is any evidence of the commission 
of an offence under the MACC Act. Then the public prosecutor may 
by written order direct that officer to do any of the things specified 
in 
the various paragraphs of section 31(1) enumerated above. 
75


  
  
  
[240] 
It therefore becomes crystal clear that an officer of the MACC 
cannot exercise the powers 
of search and seizure under section 
31 
without a written order from the public prosecutor, or an officer of the 
MACC of the rank of chief senior assistant commissioner or above who 
was been authorised so to do by the public prosecutor. 
[241] 
In the course of the inquiry before this Commission, Hairul IIham 
as well as HH were questioned as to where they derived their powers 
of search and seizure. They glibly answered 
that 
it was pursuant 
to 
section 31.:-We note with concern 
that there was 
a purported claim 
that oral authorisation by a deputy public prosecutor in the misty past 
had been given and that this 
in turn had devolved upon the Selangor 
MACC officers. 
But on further questioning, we were unable 
to 
elicit 
from any officer the name of the deputy public prosecutor concerned. 
Furthermore, on his own testimony, HH held the rank of senior assistant 
commissioner oniy 
at the material time and 
not that 
of chief senior 
_ 
assistant commissioner so as to bring him within the ambit of section 
31(1) for any authorisation from any deputy public prosecutor to have 
legal effect. 
[242] 
In the 
light of the foregoing, the purported exercise of powers 
under section 31 
by the MACC officers was fatally flawed 
in that they 
had 
not been authorised 
by 
a deputy public prosecutor or 
a lawfully 
authorised chief senior assistant commissioner to exercise the powers 
conferred by section 31 
as such authorisation must of necessity be 
in 
writing to circumvent any challenge that may be raised 
in relation 
to 
the authenticity of the authorisation. Furthermore, even 
if HH [despite 
the 
lack of rank and 
the absence 
of any written authorisation] 
had 
been 
so authorised 
by 
a deputy public prosecutor, 
he 
still needed 
to 
give 
a written order to his officers to act under section 31. This was 
not done. 
[243] 
On 
the other hand, 
the officers 
of the MACC contended 
that 
when they act under section 31(3), the authorisation and the written 
76


  
order under section 31(1) do not come into play. Therefore, by invoking 
section 31(3), they said that they could proceed to act off their own bat 
as 
it were without any referral back to a deputy public prosecutor or an 
officer of the MACC of the rank of chief senior assistant commissioner 
or above who had been accordingly authorised 
by 
a deputy public 
prosecutor pursuant to section 31(1). 
[244] 
We are unable to accept such 
a distorted interpretation 
of the 
provisions of section 31. Section 31(3) can only come into play where 
officers 
of the MACC enter premises 
as properly authorised under 
section 31(1) and then a situation arises where, 
in the premises under 
search, there 
is reasonable cause to suspect that there 
is concealed 
or deposited 
in those premises any evidence of the commission of an 
offence under the MACC Act. Again, the officer having such reasonable 
cause 
to suspect must base his suspicion on reasonable grounds for 
believing that, by reason of the delay in obtaining a written order under 
subsection (1), the object of the search 
is likely to be frustrated. Then 
only, 
and 
only then, 
may 
he exercise 
all 
the powers mentioned 
in 
subsections (1) and 
(2) of section 31 
as 
if he had been appropriately 
directed pursuant to an order issued under subsection 
(1). 
Recommendations on powers of search 
[245] 
In this context, we wish to stress our concern over the cavalier 
attitude exhibited by the MACC officers in disregarding the intention of 
parliament embodied 
in section 31(1) of the MACC Act and arrogating 
to themselves a power that the law did not, and does not, confer. As 
the 
officers 
of the MACC 
are involved 
in 
investigating offences 
not 
only under the MACC Act but also under various other laws which may 
have somewhat similar provisions as section 31, we recommend that 
all officers of the MACC should have a sound grounding in the various 
facets 
of the applicable laws and 
in the interpretation 
of those laws 
before they are allowed to venture into the field of active operations. 
17


  
[246] 
Officers of the MACC conduct searches under the provisions of 
section 31 
of the MACC Act which are similar to the search provisions 
found 
in many other jurisdictions throughout 
the world 
in 
that they 
require the prior authorisation of a judicial authority of that of a senior 
officer to-conduct searches. 
In certain exigencies, this requirement 
is 
waived and a search may be conducted on the officer's own authority 
in order to preserve evidence which might otherwise be destroyed and 
the search frustrated by the delay 
in applying for a search warrant or 
such authorisation. 
[247] 
In fact the MACC 
is 
in 
a better position than most other law- 
enforcement agencies [*LEA’] around the world in that 
it is maintaining 
the authority of a senior officer to issue warrants in the form of written 
orders 
to search. This 
is not usually the practice and the issuing 
of 
such warrants 
is largely reserved to the judiciary. 
[248] 
In the investigation 
in question, 
it was admitted by a number of 
the MACC officers that there were no written orders in existence under 
section 31(1) of the MACC Act for any of the searches conducted. This 
was despite the fact that such authorisation could have been obtained 
from 
a deputy public prosecutor attached 
to 
the MACC 
or 
a senior 
officer of the MACC who was of or above the rank stipulated 
in section 
31(1). Rather the officers relied on their perceived powers under section 
31{3) to conduct the searches. The searches conducted were clearly an 
abuse of those powers as there was no reason to believe that 
there 
was any likelihood of the searches being frustrated on account of any 
delay 
in obtaining the required authorisation. 
[249] 
In addition, two senior officers, 
namely, HH and 
Hairul 
Ilham, 
relied 
on the existence 
of a chief secretary’s circular of 1984 which, 
they alleged, allows the search of government offices without warrant 
or authorisation. 
Even 
if this were 
true, 
the 
circular requires 
the 
_issuance of an official letter from the chief commissioner of the MACC 
authorising the search 
[a more onerous requirement than obtaining 
a 
78


  
~ 
search authorisation by way of a written order under section 31(1)] and, 
in any event, such an administrative circular was clearly superseded 
_ by the MACC Act and the provisions of section 31. 
[250] 
More disturbingly, the MACC officers indicated 
in evidence that 
this was the usual 
practice, 
and 
it would appear that 
this 
is 
not an 
unusual practice in the MACC as a whole. Parliament clearly intended 
that the provisions 
of section 31(3) were only for emergency use 
in 
exigent circumstances. However, 
it would appear that the MACC officers 
have adopted them 
as common 
practice, 
fostering 
a view 
that the 
MACC can search without warrant or authorisation. Other LEA which 
also have such provisions include the Malaysian 
police, 
the ICAC 
of 
Hong Kong, the UK police, and other LEA around the world. However, 
in 
all circumstances the 
use 
of these powers generates 
a 
report 
to 
justify that use. 
[251] 
We therefore recommend the following in relation to the standard 
operating procedures [“SOP”] of the MACC regarding search: 
(a) 
that 
the commonplace 
use 
of 
section 
31(3) 
cease 
forthwith; 
(bo) 
that the use of the alleged authority under the chief secretary’s 
circular of 1984 cease forthwith; 
(c) 
that, in general, properly issued warrants or written authorisations 
be used as the basis for all searches by MACC officers; 
(d) 
that, 
the issue of those warrants or written authorisations 
be properly justified 
in writing; 
(e) 
that 
the 
use 
of section 
31(3) 
be 
restricted 
to ongoing 
operational circumstances where there is a real and present 
belief that failure to act will result in the destruction or loss 
of evidence. The use 
of section 31(3) should be confined 
to exceptional circumstances 
to emphasise 
the 
rule 
that 
79


  
(f) 
(g) 
(h) 
a written order should always be obtained, save 
in clear 
instances where evidence may be 
in the process of being 
tampered with, removed and/or destroyed; 
that, 
if possible, time should be taken to advise the relevant 
senior officer [or deputy public prosecutor] of the requirement 
by telephone in order that he may issue a verbal authority and 
a written authority may be quickly brought into existence; 
that, in either case, immediately after the search, and, in any 
event within twenty-four hours, a full written justification for 
the search and use of section 31(3) powers [or telephone 
justification] be made to the relevant senior officer [or deputy 
public prosecutor] who 
will then 
indicate 
a 
retrospective 
agreement 
in writing; 
that a record be kept of such occurrences which are to be 
reviewed regularly by a deputy public prosecutor at senior 
level 
in the Attorney-General’s Chambers. 
[252] 
. These suggested amendments to procedures can be accomplished 
by the issue of new SOP regarding searches and incorporated into the 
training programme 
for officers. 
If this 
is 
not considered appropriate, 
then consideration might be given 
to additional legislation through an 
amendment to the MACC Act. 
Applicable standing orders

Act 2009]. 
This standing order repealed SO No 12/98. 
However SO No 2/98, SO No 7/98 and SO No 12/98 were 
in force at 
the time of TBH’s death. 
[255] 
When the MACC officers raided YB Ean’s office on the 15", they 
seized 
a laptop and 
a CPU under section 33 of the MACC Act. 
[256] 
When TBH was brought to the Selangor MACC office at about 
6.15pm 
that day, 
we observe 
that 
he was subjected 
to what was 
82


  
. euphemistically called an “interview” by various MACC officers 
in four 
different stages which culminated 
in 
the 
recording 
of 
his 
purported 
statement under section 30(8) of the MACC Act between 1.30am and 
3.30am on the 16". We note with concern the manner 
in which TBH 
was “interviewed” 
in stages by the MACC officers. The various stages 
of interrogation have been extensively dealt with 
in the earlier part of 
this report and we need not repeat them here. 
Breaches of applicable standing orders 
[257] 
Among the submissions made by the parties was the submission 
that “suspects under investigation by the MACC are granted more legal 
rights than witnesses and that despite the limited scope of protection 
afforded to witnesses, there were nevertheless several infractions of the 
MACC’s standing orders.” We agree and 
list the following infractions: 
(a) 
The search of YB Ean’s office and seizure of TBH’s laptop and 
CPU without authorisation and a written order under section 
31(1) of the MACC Act was in breach of orders 3.4, 4, 
5 and 
6 of SO No 7/98 and of order 4.2 of SO No 12/98. 
(b) 
As the operation had commenced sometime 
in June 2009, 
the failure of the MACC officers to obtain authorisation and 
a written order under section 31(1) to seize the laptop and 
the CPU was totally unjustifiable as there was no basis for 
suspicion 
that evidence would 
be tampered with, removed 
and/or destroyed. 
In addition thereto, the failure of the MACC 
officers to take photographs of and label the laptop and the 
CPU, and the places from where these items were seized as 
well as prepare a sketch plan of the same, was in breach of 
order 4.4.2 of SO No 12/98. 
(c) 
Four documents 
that were 
printed 
out from TBH’s 
laptop 
[exhibits 
D94 
to 
D97] comprised 
two quotations and 
two 
invoices which apparently formed the plank upon which the 
suspicion of the MACC was launched that there was something 
83


  
  
@) 
{e) 
ff 
improper in the claims made. However, these four documents 
were not printed out 
in TBH’s presence for his verification. 
Neither was he asked to sign any seizure list regarding the 
four documents. This 
is 
in breach of orders 4.4.1 and 4.4.4 
of SO No 12/98. 
In these circumstances, the authenticity of 
these four documents 
is moot. 
| 
It was the contention of the MACC that TBH cooperated with 
its officers voluntarily and therefore there was no requirement 
for its officers to comply with the various standing orders as 
well as the written 
law applicable, 
including section 
31. 
In 
our view such 
a contention should never be countenanced 
for the simple reason 
that authorities such 
as 
the MACC 
when challenged as to their failure to comply with standing 
orders and the law may then well say that as the witnesses 
had cooperated 
voluntarily, 
there was 
no requirement for 
compliance with the standing orders and laws. 
If witnesses 
challenge this and say that they did not act voluntarily, the 
MACC will be 
in no position to defend 
its stand. 
The failure of the MACC to issue a written order to TBH to 
be examined orally to assist in investigations was 
in breach 
of order 4.1 
of SO No 2/98. 
The MACC contended 
that 
legal counsel 
for YB 
Ean 
and 
TBH had advised them 
to cooperate with the MACC as 
its 
officers were empowered under the law to do what they did. 
Notwithstanding that advice, 
it 
is our view that the relevant 
provisions of the law should have been observed and correctly 
applied so that the public would be protected. Further, Arman 
and Ashraf who had earlier “interviewed” [in fact interrogated] 
TBH 
pursuant 
to 
section 
30(1) 
of the MACC Act 
did 
not 
subsequently record TBH’s statement under section 30(8). 
It was Nadzri who did this and this was 
in breach of order 
4.2.1 
of SO No 2/98. 
84


  
(g) 
The 
use 
of Nadzri’s own words when 
recording TBH’s 
statement without recording 
the 
latter’s own words gives 
rise to uncertainty as to which parts of the statement were 
the actual answers of TBH and which were not. This was 
in 
breach of order 4.2.5 of SO No 2/98. 
(h) 
The omission 
of the words “Tandatangan 
Pegawai Yang 
Memeriksa” “Signature of Examining Officer’ on the last page 
of TBH’s statement at the portion where Nadzri purportedly 
signed 
off as the recording 
officer was 
in breach 
of order 
4.2.9 of SO No 2/98. 
Treatment of witnesses and suspects 
[258] 
We observe that TBH was originally “invited” to be a witness 
in 
the ongoing investigation 
by the MACC. However, the circumstances 
surrounding his decampment from the SUK 
building, his being escorted 
to the MACC 
office, 
his being interviewed/interrogated 
by the MACC 
officers, the recording of his statement immediately after such interview/ 
interrogation and his remaining 
in the care, custody and control of the 
MACC officers after the statement was recorded, all point to TBH being 
transformed from being 
a prospective witness to being 
a prospective 
suspect. The MACC officers contend that TBH was free to leave after 
his statement had been recorded but that he elected to remain 
in the 
MACC office. 
[259] 
We find 
it impossible 
to believe that he would want to remain 
in the MACC office after having being detained there for almost twelve 
hours. We find the failure of the MACC officers to release TBH after his 
statement had been recorded amounted to cruel conduct and punishment 
inflicted on purpose. We would therefore recommend that all proceedings 
in any MACC 
office be recorded on closed-circuit television [cctv] 
so 
that there can 
be no dispute whether witnesses are detained 
or kept 
in the offices of the MACC against their own free will or whether 
it can 
be said that they are “'voluntarily there as guests of the MACC’”. 
85


  
[260] 
We are of the view that the legal rights of both witnesses and 
suspects should be enacted as part of the MACC Act because the same 
will become transparent and accessible to the Malaysian public through 
such enactment. Providing for these rights through the standing orders 
would not safeguard the public as their observance would largely depend 
on the absolute discretion of the MACC officers concerned and would 
not be transparent in light of the usual classification of such standing 
orders as “official secrets’, 
to which the public will not be privy. 
It 
is 
a cardinal principle of transparency and the democratic process for a 
witness 
or 
a suspect 
to know what 
his rights are when 
he 
is called 
upon to assist in an investigation or when he 
is taken into custody. 
[261] 
In 
the course 
of the 
inquiry, we were concerned 
by the 
total 
lack of consideration for human sensitivities exhibited by the majority 
of the MACC officers. We were shocked to hear that racial expletives 
appeared to be the stock in trade of the interrogation procedure adopted 
by certain of the MACC officers in this case and 
in another. We hasten 
to add that such usage was of course denied by the officers concerned 
but we have no reason to doubt that the same had been uttered having 
regard to the whole background circumstances in which the interrogation 
took place. 
[262] 
We are of the view that the recruitment process of MACC officers 
should include psychological evaluation 
to assess their suitability for 
investigative work 
in the MACC and that they should further be given 
psychological counselling to apprise them of racial and religious sensitivities 
as well as the different levels of the breaking point which individuals 
would have when subjected to severe or intense interrogation. 
Proposed improvements 
[263] 
Submissions put 
in included a non-exhaustive list of issues and 
proposals 
for our consideration 
“as 
a means 
to improving 
the 
legal 
protection to be afforded to witnesses assisting in an MACC investigation’. 
86


  
We have taken note 
of those submissions and reproduce below our 
views on some of them as expressed during the course of this inquiry. 
Some 
of the proposals 
in those submissions coincide with our views 
and we reproduce them below with modifications. 
Qualifications and training 
[264] 
(a) 
(b) 
(c) 
All MACC officers who are to be employed and/or to carry out 
functions as surveillance/raiding/enforcement and investigating 
officers should 
at the minimum 
have completed 
tertiary 
education. 
MACC officers who are to be employed and/or to carry out 
functions as surveillance, raiding, enforcement and investigating 
officers should undergo a more extensive and comprehensive 
training programme. They ought to 
be examined and only 
enlisted 
for service 
if they meet 
the 
required standards. 
Such examination and training should include psychological 
evaluation and psychological counselling respectively. 
The continuing education and training of all MACC officers 
should be made compulsory. 
infrastructure 
[265] 
(a) 
(b) 
The infrastructure of MACC premises and offices should be 
improved and upgraded. Every MACC office should be equipped 
with cctv, surveillance cameras to record the movements and 
actions of every person who enters or leaves the office or 
any of its rooms. 
There should 
be 
a specified waiting room for witnesses 
to 
be placed in while waiting to be interviewed or to have their 
statement recorded. Officers should wait with the witnesses 
to prevent anything untoward happening and also to prevent 
87


  
  
(c) 
(d) 
(e) 
(f) 
(9) 
witnesses involved in the same investigation from communicating 
with each other. Witnesses should 
not be required 
to wait 
for more than thirty minutes except for good reason. 
There should 
be specified rooms for the interviewing and 
recording of the statements of witnesses [“interview rooms’”]. 
Interviews should 
only 
be conducted 
in these rooms 
and 
statements should also be recorded 
in these rooms. They 
should be located on the ground floor of the MACC office and 
should not be locked during the interviewing 
or statement- 
recording session. This will enable the superior officers 
of 
the interviewing or recording officers to check on them from 
time to time to ensure that the interview or the recording of 
the statements 
is done properly and 
in accordance with the 
law. 
Interview rooms 
should 
be equipped 
with one-way 
glass 
mirrors to promote transparency in the interview process and 
to prevent allegations 
of force 
being 
used, 
having 
regard 
also 
to our earlier recommendation that 
all proceedings 
in 
MACC offices be recorded on cctv. 
All interviews and recording of statements of witnesses should 
be captured by way of video or audio recording and equipment 
should be installed 
in the rooms for this purpose. 
There should be a computerised system recording the entry 
and exit of all persons into MACC offices including details 
such as the time, the purpose of the visit and details of the 
person with whom he or she entered or exited the premises. 
This system should be complemented by a witness logbook 
which 
must 
be 
signed 
by 
the witnesses and 
the MACC 
officers. 
There should be proper rooms for MACC officers to rest and/ 
or sleep in 
if work requires them to lengthen their stay in the 
office. MACC officers should no longer be allowed to sleep 
88


  
in their rooms. Evidence led during the proceedings was to 
the effect that officers had 
a rest area 
in the office but 
it 
was not comfortable. They also slept wherever they could 
when they needed to rest. This is not conducive to efficiency 
at work as resting under the conditions they mentioned, for 
example, sleeping on one’s work table, will not give proper 
rest and put one 
in the correct frame 
of mind 
to do one’s 
work, thereby impacting 
on how one deals with witnesses 
and potential suspects. 
Calling up witnesses 
[266] 
Section 30(1) of the MACC Act enables an MACC officer investigating 
an offence under the Act to order any person to attend before him 
to 
be examined orally 
in relation 
to any matter under investigation or to 
produce any book or other stipulated document which may be required 
for the purpose of the investigation. 
[267] 
MACC officers are also given police powers under the Criminal 
Procedure Code [the CPC”]. Section 111(1) of the CPC is so worded that 
where a police officer investigating an offence requires the attendance 
before him of any person, then he “may by order in writing” require 
the attendance before him of that person [emphasis added]. 
[268] 
We observed that during the operation 
in question 
the MACC 
officers without exception relied on verbal! orders which were given to 
require the attendance of witnesses at the Selangor MACC office. While 
we recognise that the urgency of the matter may necessitate the giving 
of verbal orders to attend, such practice must be observed with care. 
In the inquiry before us, witnesses testified that when they questioned 
the authority 
of the MACC officers to do what they were doing, they 
were informed very curtly that the law empowered them to do so. This 
extended to the extent of the officers not even properly showing their 
authority cards before proceeding to question the witnesses. 
89


  
[269] 
We are of the view that MACC officers should 
in 
all instances 
produce their authority cards as required under section 8 of the MACC 
Act when conducting 
any operation 
and 
not 
act 
in 
the high-handed 
manner that they did in the present case by not even properly showing 
their authority cards before proceeding to question the witnesses. 
[270] We are also of the view that, except where the urgency of the 
situation requires acting otherwise, atl MACC officers acting under section 
30(1) of the MACC Act should issue 
a written order for witnesses to 
attend before them. 
In the present case, witnesses testified that when 
they questioned the authority 
of the MACC officers 
to do what they 
were doing, they were informed very curtly that the 
law empowered 
the officers to do so. 
Witnesses to be accompanied 
[271] 
Any witness or suspect under investigation by the MACC should 
at 
all times 
be accompanied 
and escorted 
by 
a designated MACC 
officer who must regularly report the movement of the witness to the 
investigating officer to ensure that he 
is kept informed of the state and 
movements of the witness. We cannot overstress the need for this as 
events have shown that where witnesses or suspects are left to range 
unattended in the MACC office, there would be the probability of untoward 
incidents occurring. This practice would have the added advantage of 
meeting challenges 
of any physical 
or mental abuse 
inflicted on 
the 
witness as there would be a person unconnected with the investigation 
who would have had the charge of the witness [except when interviews 
or interrogation are 
in progress] and who would then be 
in 
a position 
to state what took place 
in the event the question arises. 
Interviewing and statement-recording 
[272] 
Aview was expressed that interviews and the statement-recording 
of witnesses should 
only 
be conducted during 
office hours, 
namely, 
between 9.00am and 5.00pm, and that each session must last for no 
90


  
‘more than one hour at 
a stretch, and breaks between each session 
should 
be 
no 
less than 
fifteen minutes 
each. 
It was observed 
that 
even on the accounts of most MACC officers who conducted interviews 
and recorded statements 
in this operation, the officers said that they 
| regularly stayed overnight and were tired as they had to work for long 
hours. 
[273] 
The MACC, on the other hand, was of the view that the present 
practice of the statement-recording of witnesses being continued beyond 
working hours as necessitated by the circumstances of the case should 
continue. Reliance was placed on the case of Datuk Seri Ahmad Said 
Hamdan and others 
v Tan Boon Wah [2010] 
6 CLJ 142 
in support 
of its stand. 
[274] 
Tan Boon Wah who was the plaintiff 
in the above case was 
a 
witness 
in the inquiry before us and the case itself emanated from the 
investigation carried out by the MACC pursuant to the complaint made 
in Shah Alam report No 0052/2009. 
[275] 
We were apprised of facts in the inquiry which did not surface in 
the proceedings 
in the High Court and the Court of Appeal. We found 
that Tan Boon Wah was kept at the MACC office for a lengthy period 
of time 
to 
put pressure 
on 
him 
and 
to inconvenience 
him. 
He was 
present 
in the MACC office on the evening of the 15", ostensibly for 
the purpose of his assisting 
in the ongoing investigation as a witness. 
However, we found that he was not only interviewed but was interrogated 
in circumstances that should not be permitted. He was confined 
in 
a 
room and 
left there with no lights on, 
left to sleep on the floor [when 
not being questioned], and was not allowed 
to go home even though 
his presence at the Selangor MACC office was not required after about 
2.30am on the 16". 
[276] 
We observed 
that 
he was subjected 
to 
intense pressure and 
threat 
of physical 
violence, 
and verbal 
insults were heaped 
on 
him 
which included racial slurs. We have no reason, having observed 
his 
91


  
  
demeanour, 
to doubt that this was what happened and we therefore 
reject the testimony of the MACC officers to the contrary 
in the form 
of denials. 
His statement was only recorded 
in the late morning of the 
16", a long time after his interrogation by the MACC officers was over. 
This gives the lie to the testimony of the MACC officers that he chose 
to stay behind after being released as he wanted to wait for his wife 
| to bring the required documents over to the Selangor MACC office. His 
wife never came with the documents and despite that his statement was 
recorded 
later that morning. This can only mean that what Tan Boon 
Wah said was true, namely, that he was purposely made to remain 
in 
the Selangor MACC office after the officers were done with him around 
-2.30am that morning. 
[277] 
In situations 
like this where 
a decision has 
to be made as 
to 
whether to accept the evidence of one witness while rejecting that of 
others, 
it would have helped immensely had there been cctv recording 
of what took place. We would stress that any cctv recording system 
that 
is implemented 
in MACC offices should 
be tamperproof so 
that 
there can be no possibility of the recording being doctored. 
[278] 
While accepting 
that the authorities have 
to act 
to investigate 
cases 
of corruption and other crimes 
to protect society 
at large, 
the 
gathering of evidence to so protect society should be done within the 
law with sufficient safeguards to protect the rights of the individual. 
[279] 
In relation 
to the recording 
of statements outside office hours, 
we would 
propose 
that 
in 
exceptional 
circumstances, 
where 
the 
discontinuance 
of the recording 
of the statement of a witness would 
have an adverse impact on the investigation, the recording should be 
allowed to continue beyond office hours but with sufficient rest periods 
and attention being given to the witness’ physical and mental condition 
and well-being. This 
is important because, 
as long as the witness 
is 
in the care 
of the MACC, 
the MACC 
is liable for 
his well-being and 
‘should the witness be kept for long hours and suffer any deterioration 
in his health, the MACC should be held accountable.

Friday, 02 Aug 2024 5:19 PM MYT
KUALA LUMPUR, Aug 2 — Fifteen years after the 2009 death of Teoh Beng Hock in Shah Alam, the
government has agreed to reopen the investigation into his death, promising a transparent and
impartial process free from interference.
Teoh, a former journalist turned aide to former Selangor executive councillor Ean Yong Hian Wah, died
after being held for questioning overnight at the then Selangor Malaysian Anti-Corruption Commission
office in Plaza Masalam, Shah Alam on July 16, 2009.
He had been called to provide information as a witness and not a suspect into a suspected corruption
case.
In July 2011, a Royal Commission of Inquiry concluded that his death was a suicide.
However, in September 2014, the Court of Appeal ruled that Teoh’s death from a fall was caused by “an
unlawful act or acts by unknown individuals.”
Teoh’s family had long sought justice for his death, which occurred outside the Selangor office of anti-
corruption investigators in 2009.
So who was Teoh Beng Hock, and why is his case being reopened after 15 years?

Teoh, born in 1979 in Melaka, graduated from Universiti Kebangsaan Malaysia and began his career as
a journalist at Sin Chew Daily.
Following the general election in 2008, Teoh transitioned to a political role where he served as a
political aide to DAP’s Ean Yong Hian Wah, the then Seri Kembangan state assemblyman and a member
of the Selangor State Executive Council.
