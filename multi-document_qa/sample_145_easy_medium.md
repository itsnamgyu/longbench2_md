# Question

Given the information, what measures can be inferred to be applied to China's energy transition?
① Phase out outdated capacity and promote clean energy: Retire out existing polluting power plants and unabated coal plants, while increasing capital expenditure on clean energy infrastructure, such as renewable energy storage batteries.
② Encourage community-based clean energy investment: For example, communities can collectively purchase solar photovoltaic panels or establish mechanisms for trading excess electricity within the community. These actions benefit both urban energy transitions and consumers/residents.
③ Advance urban energy digitalization: Develop digital solutions for urban power systems and invest in the construction of digital distribution networks to improve electricity utilization efficiency, particularly by applying artificial intelligence to reduce costs and increase efficiency.
④ Address financing challenges: Establish public green banks or similar entities to provide dedicated green financing. In addition to public funding assistance, it is also necessary to attract social capital.
