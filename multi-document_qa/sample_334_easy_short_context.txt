Two Vietnamese illegal workers were jailed by the Shatin Magistrates' Courts yesterday (September 19).

During operation "Twilight" conducted on September 16, Immigration Department (ImmD) investigators raided a food factory in Tuen Mun district. Two Vietnamese men, aged 32 and 49, were arrested while working as odd-job workers.

The illegal workers were charged at the Shatin Magistrates' Courts on September 19 with taking employment after landing in Hong Kong unlawfully and remaining in Hong Kong without the authority of the Director of Immigration, and taking employment while being a person in respect of whom a removal order or deportation order was in force respectively. They pleaded guilty to the charges and were sentenced to 15 months' imprisonment. Meanwhile, one of the males was also charged with one count of remaining in Hong Kong without the authority of the Director after landing in Hong Kong unlawfully. He was sentenced to 15 months' imprisonment, with parts of the sentences to run consecutively, making a total of 18 months' imprisonment.

The ImmD spokesman warned that, as stipulated in section 38AA of the Immigration Ordinance, an illegal immigrant, a person who is the subject of a removal order or a deportation order, an overstayer or a person who was refused permission to land is prohibited from taking any employment, whether paid or unpaid, or establishing or joining in any business. Offenders are liable upon conviction to a maximum fine of $50,000 and up to three years' imprisonment. Under the prevailing laws, it is an offence to use or possess a forged Hong Kong identity card or a Hong Kong identity card related to another person. Offenders are liable to prosecution and upon conviction face a maximum penalty of a $100,000 fine and up to 10 years' imprisonment.

The spokesman reiterated that it is a serious offence to employ people who are not lawfully employable. Under the Immigration Ordinance, the maximum penalty for an employer employing a person who is not lawfully employable, i.e. an illegal immigrant, a person who is the subject of a removal order or a deportation order, an overstayer or a person who was refused permission to land, has been significantly increased from a fine of $350,000 and three years' imprisonment to a fine of $500,000 and 10 years' imprisonment to reflect the gravity of such offences. The director, manager, secretary, partner, etc, of the company concerned may also bear criminal liability. The High Court has laid down sentencing guidelines that the employer of an illegal worker should be given an immediate custodial sentence.

According to the court sentencing, employers must take all practicable steps to determine whether a person is lawfully employable prior to employment. Apart from inspecting a prospective employee's identity card, the employer has the explicit duty to make enquiries regarding the person and ensure that the answers would not cast any reasonable doubt concerning the lawful employability of the person. The court will not accept failure to do so as a defence in proceedings. It is also an offence if an employer fails to inspect the job seeker's valid travel document if the job seeker does not have a Hong Kong permanent identity card. Offenders are liable upon conviction to a maximum fine of $150,000 and to imprisonment for one year. In that connection, the spokesman would like to remind all employers not to defy the law by employing illegal workers. The ImmD will continue to take resolute enforcement action to combat such offences.

Under the existing mechanism, the ImmD will, as a standard procedure, conduct an initial screening of vulnerable persons, including illegal workers, illegal immigrants, sex workers and foreign domestic helpers, who are arrested during any operation with a view to ascertaining whether they are trafficking in persons (TIP) victims. When any TIP indicator is revealed in the initial screening, the officers will conduct a full debriefing and identification by using a standardised checklist to ascertain the presence of TIP elements, such as threats and coercion in the recruitment phase and the nature of exploitation. Identified TIP victims will be provided with various forms of support and assistance, including urgent intervention, medical services, counselling, shelter, temporary accommodation and other supporting services. The ImmD calls on TIP victims to report crimes to the relevant departments immediately.

The Immigration Department (ImmD) announced that the Advance Passenger Information (API) System was implemented today (September 3).

To meet the aviation security requirements of the Convention on International Civil Aviation and to align Hong Kong with other aviation hubs worldwide, as well as to enable the ImmD to further enhance its passenger clearance and enforcement capabilities to prevent undesirables, including potential non-refoulement claimants, from boarding flights heading to Hong Kong, the ImmD implemented the API System today, requiring aircraft operators to comply with the Immigration (Advance Passenger Information) Regulation (Cap. 115Q) by transmitting advance information to the ImmD about flights and passengers heading to Hong Kong.

An ImmD spokesman said, "During check-in for a flight heading to Hong Kong, the aircraft operator will capture the required API data from a traveller's travel document and transmit the API data of each traveller and the aircraft information to the API System, which will instantly process the information and provide a response message, i.e. a board or no-board direction, for each traveller back to the aircraft operator. The aircraft operator shall act upon the direction given through the API System, i.e. to allow or not allow specific travellers to board the aircraft heading to Hong Kong."

To allow sufficient time for over 100 aircraft operators to connect to the API system and to ensure the system will run in a smooth and orderly manner, the rollout will be carried out in phases. A transitional period of around 12 months will also be adopted. The offences and defences, and the miscellaneous provisions under Parts 4 and 5 of the Regulation will come into effect after the transitional period, starting from September 1, 2025.

The spokesman emphasised, "The freedom to travel and the right of Hong Kong residents to enter or leave Hong Kong are guaranteed under Article 31 of the Basic Law and Article 8 of the Hong Kong Bill of Rights as set out in the Hong Kong Bill of Rights Ordinance (Cap.383). Such freedom and right are not affected by the implementation of the API System. The API system will not issue a no-board direction against Hong Kong permanent residents who enjoy the right of abode in Hong Kong."

Lau Kwan-hei pled guilty to one count of breach of secrecy when she appeared at Eastern Court on Wednesday.

The court heard that the 23-year-old had been an invigilator for the Diploma of Secondary Education’s English listening assessment that took place on April 13.

Invigilators are required to sign a confidentiality agreement with the Hong Kong Examinations and Assessment Authority and are only allowed to keep answer books for teaching purposes, as long as they do not publicise them.

Under the username “Miss Lucy”, Lau posted two pages from the exam’s question and answer book on popular Instagram-like Xiaohongshu platform after the assessment, with a caption that asked users “which question did you choose?”

The authority on April 16 filed a report with police after the Xiaohongshu post started circulating on other social media platforms.

The defendant admitted to officers that she shared the questions to “pave the way for starting an online tuition business”.

Principal Magistrate Don So Man-lung on Wednesday slammed Lau for taking advantage of her job and questioned why the prosecution had not charged her with another count of theft.

But prosecutors said invigilators were allowed to take such materials home.

So ordered Lau to be remanded in custody while the prosecution prepared a background report to help inform the court’s decision on sentencing on October 9.

The court has confiscated her phone. It was also told that Lau’s Xiaohongshu account had been taken down.

Screenshots of the now-deactivated account found the user had claimed to have first arrived in the city as a secondary school student, held a bachelor’s degree from Hong Kong Shue Yan University and a master’s from the University of Hong Kong.

The user also wrote that she was currently a secondary school educator and taught online tutorial classes for students newly arrived from the mainland.



Hong Kong is expected to receive more tour groups from mainland China during this year’s National Day “golden week” holiday than in 2023, but industry leaders have said numbers are still unsatisfactory and called for better plans to attract more visitors.

The representatives made the call on Wednesday in a bid to boost tourism in the city as the sector faced challenges, such as trending solo and one-day trips.

Sara Leung Fong-yuen, chairwoman of the Hong Kong Tourism Industry Employees General Union, said the 850 mainland tour groups expected in Hong Kong during the National Day period were not satisfactory.

“The situation is not ideal. There are more solo trips, as well as visitors on one-day journeys. There are not many tourists staying overnight in Hong Kong,” she told a radio programme.

“During the ‘golden week’ holidays before 2018, 300 to 500 mainland tour groups visited Hong Kong every day, so it is not actually ideal when the estimated number cannot exceed 1,000 now,” she said.

The Travel Industry Council earlier estimated as many as 1.2 million mainland Chinese would visit the city during the holiday.

The council, a federation of trade associations, also predicted that the number of inbound tour groups could grow by nearly 10 per cent to 850 during the seven-day mainland holiday that starts on October 1.

Leung noted that hotels still had vacancies over the holiday break, unlike the full bookings over the same period pre-Covid, while the number of non-shopping tours offered by travel agencies was also small.

She attributed the sluggish performance to the city’s weak attractiveness to tours and the growing number of solo and one-day trips among tourists, as well as the absence of a long-term plan for the tourism industry in Hong Kong.

The Culture, Sports and Tourism Bureau is mapping out the city’s tourism development blueprint 2.0, which was scheduled to be released in the second half of this year.

Caspar Tsui Ying-wai, executive director of the Federation of Hong Kong Hotel Owners, also said on the same radio programme that most visitors only made one-day trips, with a few joining tour groups.

“There will be more customers, but overall, our retail and catering industries are expected to see the return on consumption drop by 10 per cent to 20 per cent,” he said.

He added that many restaurants would offer discounts and hotels would launch packages such as featuring fireworks shows on display during the holiday to attract visitors.

The Immigration Department said on Tuesday about 10.03 million people, including residents and tourists, would pass through the city’s sea, land and air crossings from Saturday to October 7.

About 85 per cent of travellers are expected to use land crossings to Macau or neighbouring mainland cities.

Authorities said numbers were set to peak on National Day on October 1, with about 523,000 outbound and 632,000 inbound trips.

Hongkongers will be able to enjoy shopping vouchers, dining discounts and free rides on public transport as the city marks the 75th anniversary of the founding of the People’s Republic of China on October 1.

In addition to special deals at 3,000 eateries, the government earlier announced that about 400 activities would be held to celebrate National Day, including a fireworks display, drone shows and car parades.

The pair of giant pandas gifted by Beijing to Hong Kong are due to arrive in the city on Thursday, but they will not meet the public at least until December.



Hong Kong’s health minister has called on the public not to label people with psychiatric disorders, saying that violent incidents involving psych patients were “isolated cases.”Hong Kong should adopt a more inclusive attitude towards psychiatric patients and do its best to help them recover, Secretary for Health Lo Chung-mau told the press on Tuesday.

Lo’s remarks came around a week after a man was shot in the chest by a police officer called to handle a domestic dispute on September 15. The  38-year-old man, who had a long record of mental illness, was said to have been holding a 30-centimetre long knife and a pair of scissors. He later died in hospital.

On Tuesday, Lo was asked if there was any early identification system for schizophrenic patients whose condition was worsening, and the channels available to the patient’s family to seek help.

The health chief was also asked if contacting the police was the only option, and whether the government would consider setting up a mechanism for the Hospital Authority’s (HA) psychiatric department to handle violent patients together with police and community nursing services.

Lo said he would not comment on individual cases, but his staff and psychiatric nurses had been following the case, he said. The official went on to say that violent incidents were something that “everyone is unwilling to see,” and it was crucial for society not to label psychiatric patients.

“Patients with psychiatric disorders do not necessarily have violent tendencies; these are just isolated cases,” Lo said in Cantonese.

Lo said that patients with psychiatric disorders required not only diagnosis and treatment by doctors, but also the assistance from nurses, social workers and other personnel. The HA currently provided integrated treatment in collaboration with other organisations and multidisciplinary teams, he added.

Police complaint

Last Sunday, the widow and older brother of the deceased man filed a complaint at the Wan Chai police headquarters, questioning why the officer resorted to firing their gun after being called to handle a domestic dispute.

The widow told the press that she had repeatedly asked the police not to shoot and said she had contacted the police for assistance, not for them to “shoot my husband dead.”She also questioned why the force had not tried other means to de-escalate the situation before resorting to gunshots.

Paul Yip, member of the Health Bureau’s Advisory Committee on Mental Health, said on TVB last Sunday that if the police learned that they were handling a case involving a psych patient, or could foresee a dangerous situation, they should step up defensive measures by wearing protective gear and use shields to avoid resorting to lethal weapons.

He added society should treat people with psychiatric disorders with empathy, while different sectors should improve their understanding of mental illness to handle relevant emergency situations more effectively.



A Mainland male was charged at the Sha Tin Magistrates' Courts with making false representation to an Immigration Department (ImmD) staff member, breaching the condition of stay and failing to register and apply for an identity card, and was sentenced to four months' imprisonment and fined $800 on May 31.

The 39-year-old defendant was granted entry to work in Hong Kong as an imported worker. Subsequently, the contract was prematurely terminated but the defendant did not depart Hong Kong within 14 days after the contract was terminated. The defendant was intercepted when he presented himself for departure clearance at a control point on May 26, during which the defendant claimed to the ImmD staff that he had no idea about the termination of his contract. The ImmD staff cast doubt on his explanation and thus began an investigation against the defendant.

In the course of the investigation, the defendant admitted under caution that he was well aware of the termination of his contract and he was required to leave Hong Kong within 14 days after the termination, but he did not depart before the limitation of stay expired because he wished to sightsee in Hong Kong. Moreover, records revealed that the defendant failed to register and apply for an identity card. The defendant was subsequently charged with the offences of making false representation to ImmD staff, breaching the condition of stay and failing to register and apply for an identity card. The defendant pleaded guilty to the charges and was sentenced to a total of four months' imprisonment and fined $800 by the Sha Tin Magistrates' Courts on May 31.

An ImmD spokesman said, "Under the laws of Hong Kong, any person who makes false representation to an Immigration officer commits an offence. Offenders are liable to prosecution and, upon conviction, subject to the maximum penalty of a fine of $150,000 and imprisonment for 14 years."

The spokesman warned, "Any person who contravenes a condition of stay in force in respect of him shall be guilty of an offence. Also, visitors are not allowed to take employment in Hong Kong, whether paid or unpaid, without the permission of the Director of Immigration. Offenders are liable to prosecution and upon conviction face a maximum fine of $50,000 and up to two years' imprisonment. Aiders and abettors are also liable to prosecution and penalties."

Under the Registration of Persons Ordinance, all Hong Kong residents aged 11 or over (including those who have been permitted to stay in Hong Kong for more than 180 days) are required to register for an identity card within 30 days of his entering Hong Kong, except those who are exempted or excluded. Offenders are liable to prosecution and, upon conviction, subject to the maximum penalty of a fine at level 3 and imprisonment for one year.



The Immigration Department (ImmD) mounted a series of territory-wide anti-illegal worker operations codenamed "Twilight", and joint operations with the Hong Kong Police Force codenamed "Champion" and "Windsand", for four consecutive days from July 15 to yesterday (June 18). A total of nine suspected illegal workers and three suspected employers were arrested.

During the anti-illegal worker operations, ImmD Task Force officers raided nine target locations including premises under renovation and restaurants. Five suspected illegal workers and one suspected employer were arrested. The arrested suspected illegal workers comprised two men and three women, aged 24 to 46. Among them, one man and one woman were holders of recognisance forms, which prohibit them from taking any employment. In addition, one man and one woman were suspected of using and being in possession of a forged Hong Kong identity card respectively. One man, aged 28, who was suspected of employing the illegal workers, was also arrested.

During operation "Champion", enforcement officers raided 55 target locations in Central district, including massage parlours and restaurants. Four suspected illegal workers and two suspected employers were arrested. The arrested suspected illegal workers comprised two men and two women, aged 37 to 49. Among them, one woman was a holder of recognisance form, which prohibits her from taking any employment. In addition, one woman was suspected of using and being in possession of a forged Hong Kong identity card. Furthermore, two men, aged 47 and 63, were suspected of employing the illegal workers and were also arrested. Among them, three suspected illegal workers and one suspected employer were handled by the ImmD.

An ImmD spokesman said, "Any person who contravenes a condition of stay in force in respect of him or her shall be guilty of an offence. Also, visitors are not allowed to take employment in Hong Kong, whether paid or unpaid, without the permission of the Director of Immigration. Offenders are liable to prosecution and upon conviction face a maximum fine of $50,000 and up to two years' imprisonment. Aiders and abettors are also liable to prosecution and penalties."

The spokesman warned, "As stipulated in section 38AA of the Immigration Ordinance, an illegal immigrant, a person who is the subject of a removal order or a deportation order, an overstayer or a person who was refused permission to land is prohibited from taking any employment, whether paid or unpaid, or establishing or joining in any business. Offenders are liable upon conviction to a maximum fine of $50,000 and up to three years' imprisonment. Under the prevailing laws, it is an offence to use or possess a forged Hong Kong identity card or a Hong Kong identity card related to another person. Offenders are liable to prosecution and upon conviction face a maximum fine of $100,000 and up to 10 years' imprisonment."

The spokesman reiterated that it is a serious offence to employ people who are not lawfully employable. Under the Immigration Ordinance, the maximum penalty for an employer employing a person who is not lawfully employable, i.e. an illegal immigrant, a person who is the subject of a removal order or a deportation order, an overstayer or a person who was refused permission to land, has been significantly increased from a fine of $350,000 and three years' imprisonment to a fine of $500,000 and 10 years' imprisonment to reflect the gravity of such offences. The director, manager, secretary, partner, etc, of the company concerned may also bear criminal liability. The High Court has laid down sentencing guidelines that the employer of an illegal worker should be given an immediate custodial sentence.

According to the court sentencing, employers must take all practicable steps to determine whether a person is lawfully employable prior to employment. Apart from inspecting a prospective employee's identity card, the employer has the explicit duty to make enquiries regarding the person and ensure that the answers would not cast any reasonable doubt concerning the lawful employability of the person. The court will not accept failure to do so as a defence in proceedings. It is also an offence if an employer fails to inspect the job seeker's valid travel document if the job seeker does not have a Hong Kong permanent identity card. Offenders are liable upon conviction to a maximum fine of $150,000 and to imprisonment for one year. In that connection, the spokesman reminded all employers not to defy the law by employing illegal workers. The ImmD will continue to take resolute enforcement action to combat such offences.

Under the existing mechanism, the ImmD will, as a standard procedure, conduct an initial screening of vulnerable persons, including illegal workers, illegal immigrants, sex workers and foreign domestic helpers, who are arrested during any operation with a view to ascertaining whether they are trafficking in persons (TIP) victims. When any TIP indicator is revealed in the initial screening, the ImmD officers will conduct a full debriefing and identification by using a standardised checklist to ascertain the presence of TIP elements, such as threats and coercion in the recruitment phase and the nature of exploitation. Identified TIP victims will be provided with various forms of support and assistance, including urgent intervention, medical services, counselling, shelter or temporary accommodation and other supporting services. The ImmD calls on TIP victims to report crimes to the relevant departments immediately.
