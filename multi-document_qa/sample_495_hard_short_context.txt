Abstract
We ﬁne-tune GPT-3 to answer long-form questions using a text-based web-
browsing environment, which allows the model to search and navigate the web.
By setting up the task so that it can be performed by humans, we are able to train
models on the task using imitation learning, and then optimize answer quality with
human feedback. To make human evaluation of factual accuracy easier, models
must collect references while browsing in support of their answers. We train and
evaluate our models on ELI5, a dataset of questions asked by Reddit users. Our
best model is obtained by ﬁne-tuning GPT-3 using behavior cloning, and then
performing rejection sampling against a reward model trained to predict human
preferences. This model’s answers are preferred by humans 56% of the time to
those of our human demonstrators, and 69% of the time to the highest-voted answer
from Reddit.

Introduction
A rising challenge in NLP is long-form question-answering (LFQA), in which a paragraph-length
answer is generated in response to an open-ended question. LFQA systems have the potential
to become one of the main ways people learn about the world, but currently lag behind human
performance [Krishna et al., 2021]. Existing work tends to focus on two core components of the task,
information retrieval and synthesis.
In this work we leverage existing solutions to these components: we outsource document retrieval to
the Microsoft Bing Web Search API,2 and utilize unsupervised pre-training to achieve high-quality
synthesis by ﬁne-tuning GPT-3 [Brown et al., 2020]. Instead of trying to improve these ingredients,
we focus on combining them using more faithful training objectives. Following Stiennon et al. [2020],
we use human feedback to directly optimize answer quality, allowing us to achieve performance
competitive with humans.
We make two key contributions:

If you did this a few times, your crows would learn your new place, but
as I said, I’m not sure if they will follow or visit you there since it’s
probably not in their territory. The other option is simply to make new
crow friends with the crows that live in your new neighborhood.

The partial piece of apple may have been left behind when the crow was
startled rather than as a gift. If the crows bring bright objects you’ll
know for sure that it’s a gift because it’s not something they eat.

• We create a text-based web-browsing environment that a ﬁne-tuned language model can
interact with. This allows us to improve both retrieval and synthesis in an end-to-end fashion
using general methods such as imitation learning and reinforcement learning.
• We generate answers with references: passages extracted by the model from web pages
while browsing. This is crucial for allowing labelers to judge the factual accuracy of answers,
without engaging in a difﬁcult and subjective process of independent research.
Our models are trained primarily to answer questions from ELI5 [Fan et al., 2019], a dataset of
questions taken from the “Explain Like I’m Five” subreddit. We collect two additional kinds of
data: demonstrations of humans using our web-browsing environment to answer questions, and
comparisons between two model-generated answers to the same question (each with their own set of
references). Answers are judged for their factual accuracy, coherence, and overall usefulness.
We use this data in four main ways: behavior cloning (i.e., supervised ﬁne-tuning) using the demon-
strations, reward modeling using the comparisons, reinforcement learning against the reward model,
and rejection sampling against the reward model. Our best model uses a combination of behavior
cloning and rejection sampling. We also ﬁnd reinforcement learning to provide some beneﬁt when
inference-time compute is more limited.
We evaluate our best model in three different ways. First, we compare our model’s answers to answers
written by our human demonstrators on a held-out set of questions. Our model’s answers are preferred
56% of the time, demonstrating human-level usage of the text-based browser. Second, we compare
our model’s answers (with references stripped, for fairness) to the highest-voted answer provided
by the ELI5 dataset. Our model’s answers are preferred 69% of the time. Third, we evaluate our
model on TruthfulQA [Lin et al., 2021], an adversarial dataset of short-form questions. Our model’s
answers are true 75% of the time, and are both true and informative 54% of the time, outperforming
our base model (GPT-3), but falling short of human performance.
The remainder of the paper is structured as follows:
• In Section 2, we describe our text-based web-browsing environment and how our models
interact with it.
• In Section 3, we explain our data collection and training methods in more detail.
• In Section 4, we evaluate our best-performing models (for different inference-time compute
budgets) on ELI5 and TruthfulQA.
• In Section 5, we provide experimental results comparing our different methods and how
they scale with dataset size, parameter count, and inference-time compute.
• In Section 6, we discuss the implications of our ﬁndings for training models to answer
questions truthfully, and broader impacts.

Environment design
Previous work on question-answering such as REALM [Guu et al., 2020] and RAG [Lewis et al.,
2020a] has focused on improving document retrieval for a given query. Instead, we use a familiar
existing method for this: a modern search engine (Bing). This has two main advantages. First,
modern search engines are already very powerful, and index a large number of up-to-date documents.
Second, it allows us to focus on the higher-level task of using a search engine to answer questions,
something that humans can do well, and that a language model can mimic.
For this approach, we designed a text-based web-browsing environment. The language model is
prompted with a written summary of the current state of the environment, including the question, the
text of the current page at the current cursor location, and some other information (see Figure 1(b)).
In response to this, the model must issue one of the commands given in Table 1, which performs an
action such as running a Bing search, clicking on a link, or scrolling around. This process is then
repeated with a fresh context (hence, the only memory of previous steps is what is recorded in the
summary).
While the model is browsing, one of the actions it can take is to quote an extract from the current
page. When this is performed, the page title, domain name and extract are recorded to be used later
as a reference. Browsing then continues until either the model issues a command to end browsing,
the maximum number of actions has been reached, or the maximum total length of references has
been reached. At this point, as long as there is at least one reference, the model is prompted with the
question and the references, and must compose its ﬁnal answer.
Further technical details about our environment can be found in Appendix A.

Methods
3.1
Data collection
Guidance from humans is central to our approach. A language model pre-trained on natural language
would not be able to use our text-based browser, since it does not know the format of valid commands.
We therefore collected examples of humans using the browser to answer questions, which we call
demonstrations. However, training on demonstrations alone does not directly optimize answer quality,
and is unlikely to lead far beyond human performance [Stiennon et al., 2020]. We therefore collected
pairs of model-generated answers to the same question, and asked humans which one they preferred,
which we call comparisons.
For both demonstrations and comparisons, the vast majority of questions were taken from ELI5 [Fan
et al., 2019], a dataset of long-form questions. For diversity and experimentation, we also mixed in
a small number of questions from other sources, such as TriviaQA [Joshi et al., 2017]. In total, we
collected around 6,000 demonstrations, 92% of which were for questions from ELI5, and around
21,500 comparisons, 98% of which were for questions from ELI5. A more detailed breakdown of the
questions we used along with post-processing details can be found in Appendix B.

Question
Why did we decide that certain words were "bad" and shouldn’t be used in social settings?
Answer
We have all been taught that there are certain words that should not be used in public, at least
not without good reason. But why do some words fall into this category while others do not? It
turns out that there is not a single answer to this question, as each word has a different history
and carries different meanings in different cultures and families [2]. However, there are some
general categories that "bad" words tend to fall into. "Bad" words generally relate to parts of life
that we don’t like talking about in public, like bathroom functions, or negative ways of talking
about people’s religion, skin color, ability, or gender [3]. Often, people say bad words when
they are experiencing strong emotions, and those words are linked to our emotions [3].

To make it easier for humans to provide demonstrations, we designed a graphical user interface for
the environment (see Figure 1(a)). This displays essentially the same information as the text-based
interface and allows any valid action to be performed, but is more human-friendly. For comparisons,
we designed a similar interface, allowing auxiliary annotations as well as comparison ratings to be
provided, although only the ﬁnal comparison ratings (better, worse or equally good overall) were
used in training.
For both demonstrations and comparisons, we emphasized that answers should be relevant, coherent,
and supported by trustworthy references. Further details about these criteria and other aspects of our
data collection pipeline can be found in Appendix C.
We are releasing a dataset of comparisons, the details of which can be found in Appendix K.
3.2
Training
The use of pre-trained models is crucial to our approach. Many of the underlying capabilities required
to successfully use our environment to answer questions, such as reading comprehension and answer
synthesis, emerge as zero-shot capabilities of language models [Brown et al., 2020]. We therefore
ﬁne-tuned models from the GPT-3 model family, focusing on the 760M, 13B and 175B model sizes.
Starting from these models, we used four main training methods:
1. Behavior cloning (BC). We ﬁne-tuned on the demonstrations using supervised learning,
with the commands issued by the human demonstrators as labels.
2. Reward modeling (RM). Starting from the BC model with the ﬁnal unembedding layer
removed, we trained a model to take in a question and an answer with references, and output
a scalar reward. Following Stiennon et al. [2020], the reward represents an Elo score, scaled
such that the difference between two scores represents the logit of the probability that one
will be preferred to the other by the human labelers. The reward model is trained using a
cross-entropy loss, with the comparisons as labels. Ties are treated as soft 50% labels.
3. Reinforcement learning (RL). Once again following Stiennon et al. [2020], we ﬁne-tuned
the BC model on our environment using PPO [Schulman et al., 2017]. For the environment
reward, we took the reward model score at the end of each episode, and added this to a KL
penalty from the BC model at each token to mitigate overoptimization of the reward model.
4. Rejection sampling (best-of-n). We sampled a ﬁxed number of answers (4, 16 or 64) from
either the BC model or the RL model (if left unspeciﬁed, we used the BC model), and
selected the one that was ranked highest by the reward model. We used this as an alternative
method of optimizing against the reward model, which requires no additional training, but
instead uses more inference-time compute.
4


We used mutually disjoint sets of questions for each of BC, RM and RL.
For BC, we held out around 4% of the demonstrations to use as a validation set.
For RM, we sampled answers for the comparison datasets in an ad-hoc manner, using models of
various sizes (but primarily the 175B model size), trained using various combinations of methods and
hyperparameters, and combined them into a single dataset. This was for data efﬁciency: we collected
many comparisons for evaluation purposes, such as for tuning hyperparameters, and did not want to
waste this data. Our ﬁnal reward models were trained on around 16,000 comparisons, the remaining
5,500 being used for evaluation only.
For RL, we trained on a mixture of 90% questions from ELI5 and 10% questions from TriviaQA.
To improve sample efﬁciency, at the end of each episode we inserted 15 additional answering-only
episodes using the same references as the previous episode. We were motivated to try this because
answering explained slightly more of the variance in reward model score than browsing despite taking
many fewer steps, and we found it to improve sample efﬁciency by approximately a factor of 2. We
also randomized the maximum number of browsing actions, sampling uniformly from the range
20–100 inclusive.
Hyperparameters for all of our training methods can be found in Appendix E.

Evaluation
In evaluating our approach, we focused on three “WebGPT” models, each of which was trained with
behavior cloning followed by rejection sampling against a reward model of the same size: a 760M
best-of-4 model, a 13B best-of-16 model and a 175B best-of-64 model. As discussed in Section 5.2,
these are compute-efﬁcient models corresponding to different inference-time compute budgets. We
excluded RL for simplicity, since it did not provide signiﬁcant beneﬁt when combined with rejection
sampling (see Figure 4).
We evaluated all WebGPT models using a sampling temperature of 0.8, which was tuned using human
evaluations, and with a maximum number of browsing actions of 100.
4.1
ELI5
We evaluated WebGPT on the ELI5 test set in two different ways:
1. We compared model-generated answers to answers written by demonstrators using our
web-browsing environment. For these comparisons, we used the same procedure as compar-
isons used for reward model training. We consider this to be a fair comparison, since the
instructions for demonstrations and comparisons emphasize a very similar set of criteria.
2. We compared model-generated answers to the reference answers from the ELI5 dataset,
which are the highest-voted answers from Reddit. In this case, we were concerned about
ecological validity, since our detailed comparison criteria may not match those of real-life
users. We were also concerned about blinding, since Reddit answers do not typically include
citations. To mitigate these concerns, we stripped all citations and references from the
model-generated answers, hired new contractors who were not familiar with our detailed
instructions, and gave them a much more minimal set of instructions, which are given in
Appendix F.
In both cases, we treat ties as 50% preference ratings (rather than excluding them).
Our results are shown in Figure 2. Our best model, the 175B best-of-64 model, produces answers
that are preferred to those written by our human demonstrators 56% of the time. This suggests that
the use of human feedback is essential, since one would not expect to exceed 50% preference by
imitating demonstrations alone (although it may still be possible, by producing a less noisy policy).
The same model produces answers that are preferred to the reference answers from the ELI5 dataset
69% of the time. This is a substantial improvement over Krishna et al. [2021], whose best model’s
answers are preferred 23% of the time to the reference answers, although they use substantially less
compute than even our smallest model.

Although the evaluations against the ELI5 reference answers are useful for comparing to prior work,
we believe that the evaluations against human demonstrations are more meaningful, for several
reasons:
• Fact-checking. It is difﬁcult to assess the factual accuracy of answers without references:
even with the help of a search engine, expertise is often required. However, WebGPT and
human demonstrators provide answers with references.
• Objectivity. The use of minimal instructions makes it harder to know what criteria are
being used to choose one answer over another. Our more detailed instructions enable more
interpretable and consistent comparisons.
• Blinding. Even with citations and references stripped, WebGPT composes answers that
are different in style to Reddit answers, making the comparisons less blinded. In contrast,
WebGPT and human demonstrators compose answers in similar styles. Additionally, some
ELI5 answers contained links, which we instructed labelers not to follow, and this could
have biased labelers against those answers.
• Answer intent. People ask questions on ELI5 to obtain original, simpliﬁed explanations
rather than answers that can already be found on the web, but these were not criteria we
wanted answers to be judged on. Moreover, many ELI5 questions only ever get a small
number of low-effort answers. With human demonstrations, it is easier to ensure that the
desired intent and level of effort are used consistently.
4.2
TruthfulQA
To further probe the abilities of WebGPT, we evaluated WebGPT on TruthfulQA [Lin et al., 2021], an
adversarially-constructed dataset of short-form questions. TruthfulQA questions are crafted such that
they would be answered falsely by some humans due to a false belief or misconception. Answers are
scored on both truthfulness and informativeness, which trade off against one another (for example, “I
have no comment” is considered truthful but not informative).
We evaluated both the base GPT-3 models used by WebGPT and the WebGPT models themselves
on TruthfulQA. For GPT-3, we used both the “QA prompt” and the “helpful prompt” from Lin
et al. [2021], and used the automated metric, since this closely tracks human evaluation on answers
produced by the GPT-3 model family. For WebGPT, we used human evaluation, since WebGPT’s
answers are out-of-distribution for the automated metric. TruthfulQA is a short-form dataset, so

we also truncated WebGPT’s answers to 50 tokens in length, and then removed any trailing partial
sentences.3
Our results are shown in Figure 3. All WebGPT models outperform all GPT-3 models (with both
prompts) on both the percentage of truthful answers and the percentage of truthful and informative
answers. Moreover, the percentage of truthful and informative answers increases with model size for
WebGPT, unlike GPT-3 with either prompt. Further qualitative analysis of WebGPT’s performance
on TruthfulQA is given in Section 6.1.
4.3
TriviaQA
We also evaluated the WebGPT 175B BC model on TriviaQA [Joshi et al., 2017]. These results are
given in Appendix G.

Experiments
5.1
Comparison of training methods
We ran a number of additional experiments comparing reinforcement learning (RL) and rejection
sampling (best-of-n) with each other and with the behavior cloning (BC) baseline. Our results are
shown in Figures 4 and 5. Rejection sampling provides a substantial beneﬁt, with the 175B best-of-64
BC model being preferred 68% of the time to the 175B BC model. Meanwhile, RL provides a smaller
beneﬁt, with the 175B RL model being preferred 58% of the time to the 175B BC model.
Even though both rejection sampling and RL optimize against the same reward model, there are
several possible reasons why rejection sampling outperforms RL:
• It may help to have many answering attempts, simply to make use of more inference-time
compute.
• The environment is unpredictable: with rejection sampling, the model can try visiting many
more websites, and then evaluate the information it ﬁnds with the beneﬁt of hindsight.
3This inadvertently resulted in a small number of empty answers, which were considered truthful but not
informative. This affected 74 answers in total, around 3% of answers.

region represents ±1 standard error.
• The reward model was trained primarily on data collected from BC and rejection sampling
policies, which may have made it more robust to overoptimization by rejection sampling
than by RL.
• RL requires hyperparameter tuning, whereas rejection sampling does not.
The combination of RL and rejection sampling also fails to offer much beneﬁt over rejection sampling
alone. One possible reason for this is that RL and rejection sampling are optimizing against the same
reward model, which can easily be overoptimized (especially by RL, as noted above). In addition to
this, RL reduces the entropy of the policy, which hurts exploration. Adapting the RL objective to
optimize rejection sampling performance is an interesting direction for future research.
It is also worth highlighting the importance of carefully tuning the BC baseline for these comparisons.
As discussed in Appendix E, we tuned the number of BC epochs and the sampling temperature using
a combination of human evaluations and reward model score. This alone closed much of the gap we
originally saw between BC and RL.
5.2
Scaling experiments
We also conducted experiments to investigate how model performance varied with the size of the
dataset, the number of model parameters, and the number of samples used for rejection sampling.
Since human evaluations can be noisy and expensive, we used the score of a 175B “validation” reward
model (trained on a separate dataset split) for these experiments. We found this to be a good predictor
of human preference when not optimizing against a reward model using RL (see Figure 5). Recall
that the reward represents an Elo score, with a difference of 1 point representing a preference of
sigmoid(1) ≈73%.
Scaling trends with dataset size and parameter count are shown in Figures 6 and 7. For dataset size,
doubling the number of demonstrations increased the policy’s reward model score by about 0.13,
and doubling the number of comparisons increased the reward model’s accuracy by about 1.8%.
For parameter count, the trends were noisier, but doubling the number of parameters in the policy
increased its reward model score by roughly 0.09, and doubling the number of parameters in the
reward model increased its accuracy by roughly 0.4%.
For rejection sampling, we analyzed how to trade off the number of samples against the number
of model parameters for a given inference-time compute budget (see Figure 8). We found that it is

Discussion
6.1
Truthfulness of WebGPT
As NLP systems improve and become more widely deployed, it is becoming increasingly important
to develop techniques for reducing the number of false statements they make [Evans et al., 2021].
To assess the contribution of WebGPT to this aim, it is helpful to distinguish two categories of false
statement made by a model:
1. Imitative falsehoods. These are false statements that are incentivized by the training
objective (even in the limit of inﬁnite data and compute), such as reproducing common
misconceptions [Lin et al., 2021].
2. Non-imitative falsehoods. These are false statements that are the result of the model failing
to achieve its training objective, including most hallucinations, which are statements that
are false, but look plausible at a glance [Maynez et al., 2020].
Our TruthfulQA results suggest that WebGPT produces fewer imitative falsehoods than GPT-3. We
believe this is because WebGPT is incentivized to prefer reliable sources (both because of ﬁltering
performed by the Bing API, and because we specify this in our instructions). Nevertheless, as shown
in Table 3, WebGPT still sometimes quotes from highly unreliable sources in response to TruthfulQA
questions. We hypothesize that this is because of the distribution shift from ELI5 to TruthfulQA,
and that training on adversarially-selected questions is a promising way to improve this. It would be
important in such an endeavor to pay close attention to labeler judgments of source trustworthiness
(see Appendix C).
Our results on ELI5 suggest that WebGPT also produces fewer non-imitative falsehoods than GPT-
3. We did not test this hypothesis directly, since we found that it was challenging for labelers to
spot subtle hallucinations. However, prior work shows that the use of retrieval reduces the rate
of hallucinations [Shuster et al., 2021], and moreover WebGPT performs about as well as human
demonstrations for factual accuracy on ELI5 (see Figure 2(a)). Nevertheless, WebGPT still sometimes
produces non-imitative falsehoods, which are typically mistakes when attempting to paraphrase or

6.2
Perceived truthfulness of WebGPT
In order to assess the beneﬁts and risks of WebGPT, it is necessary to consider not only how often it
makes false statements, but also how likely users are to rely on those statements. Although WebGPT
makes false statements less frequently than GPT-3, its answers also appear more authoritative, partly
because of the use of citations. In combination with the well-documented problem of “automation
bias” [Goddard et al., 2012], this could lead to overreliance on WebGPT’s answers. This is particularly
problematic because, as discussed in Section 6.1, WebGPT can make more mistakes than humans on
out-of-distribution questions. Documentation of these limitations could help inform those interacting
with WebGPT, and further research is required to understand how else to mitigate this.
6.3
Reinforcement of bias
There are a number of ways in which WebGPT tends to perpetuate and reinforce existing assumptions
and biases. Firstly, WebGPT inherits the biases of the base model from which it is ﬁne tuned,
GPT-3 [Brown et al., 2020], and this inﬂuences the way in which it chooses to search for and
synthesize information. Search and synthesis both depend on the ability to include and exclude
material depending on some measure of its value, and by incorporating GPT-3’s biases when making
these decisions, WebGPT can be expected to perpetuate them further. Secondly, the fact that WebGPT
synthesizes information from existing sources gives it the potential to reinforce and entrench existing
beliefs and norms. Finally, WebGPT usually accepts the implicit assumptions made by questions,
and more generally seems to be inﬂuenced by the stance taken by questions. This is something that
could exacerbate conﬁrmation bias in users.
These problems could be mitigated with improvements both to WebGPT’s base model and to
WebGPT’s training objective, and we discuss some alternative objectives in the next section. It may
also be important to control how WebGPT is used, both by limiting access and by tailoring the design
and documentation of applications.
Additional analysis of the effect of question stance and of reference point bias is given in Appendix
H.

6.4
Using references to evaluate factual accuracy
Central to our approach is the use of references collected by the model to aid human evaluation of
factual accuracy. This was previously suggested by Metzler et al. [2021], and has several beneﬁts:
• More accurate feedback. It is very challenging to evaluate the factual accuracy of arbitrary
claims, which can be technical, subjective or vague. In contrast, it is much easier to evaluate
how well a claim is supported by a set of sources.
• Less noisy feedback. It is also easier to specify an unambiguous procedure for evaluating
how well a claim is supported by a set of sources, compared to evaluating the factual
accuracy of an arbitrary claim. This improves agreement rates between labelers, which helps
data efﬁciency.
• Transparency. It is much easier to understand how WebGPT composes answers than it is
for GPT-3, since the entire browsing process can be inspected. It is also straightforward for
end-users to follow up on sources to better judge factual accuracy for themselves.
Despite these beneﬁts, references are far from a panacea. Our current procedure incentivizes models
to cherry-pick references that they expect labelers to ﬁnd convincing, even if those references do
not reﬂect a fair assessment of the evidence. As discussed in Section 6.3, there are early signs of
this happening, with WebGPT accepting the implicit assumptions of questions, and the problem is
likely to be exacerbated by more capable models and more challenging or subjective questions. We
could mitigate this using methods like debate [Irving et al., 2018], in which models are trained to ﬁnd
evidence both for and against different claims. Such setups can also be viewed as simple cases of
recursive reward modeling [Leike et al., 2018] and Iterated Ampliﬁcation [Christiano et al., 2018], in
which the model assists its own evaluation.
Our approach also raises a challenging problem with societal implications: how should factual
accuracy be evaluated when training AI systems? Evans et al. [2021, Section 2] propose a number of
desiderata, but a substantial gap remains between these and the highly speciﬁc criteria needed to train
current AI systems with reasonable data efﬁciency. We made a number of difﬁcult judgment calls,
such as how to rate the trustworthiness of sources (see Appendix C), which we do not expect universal
agreement with. While WebGPT did not seem to take on much of this nuance, we expect these
decisions to become increasingly important as AI systems improve, and think that cross-disciplinary
research is needed to develop criteria that are both practical and epistemically sound.
6.5
Risks of live web access
At both train and inference time, WebGPT has live access to the web via our text-based browsing
environment. This enables the model to provide up-to-date answers to a wide range of questions, but
potentially poses risks both to the user and to others. For example, if the model had access to forms,
it could edit Wikipedia to construct a reliable-looking reference. Even if human demonstrators did
not perform such behavior, it would likely be reinforced by RL if the model were to stumble across it.
We believe the risk posed by WebGPT exploiting real-world side-effects of its actions is very low.
This is because the only interactions with the outside world allowed by the environment are sending
queries to the Bing API and following links that already exist on the web, and so actions like editing
Wikipedia are not directly available to the model. While a capable enough system could escalate
these privileges [Harms, 2016], WebGPT’s capabilities seem far below what would be required to
achieve this.
Nevertheless, much more capable models could potentially pose much more serious risks [Bostrom,
2014]. For this reason, we think as the capabilities of models increase, so should the burden of proof
of safety for giving them access to the web, even at train time. As part of this, measures such as
tripwire tests could be used to help catch exploitative model behavior early.

Related work
Combining machine learning with an external knowledge base, for the task of question-answering,
preceded the rise of pre-trained language models in the late 2010s. One notable system of this kind
was DeepQA (also known as IBM Watson), which was used to beat the best humans at Jeopardy
11


[Ferrucci et al., 2010]. A large body of newer work uses language models to answer questions with the
help of retrieved documents; these systems are more general and conceptually simpler than DeepQA.
One approach is to use inner product search to retrieve relevant documents and then generate an
answer given these documents:
p(passage∣query) ∝exp(embed(passage) ⋅embed(query)).
(1)
Given a training dataset that speciﬁes relevant passages for each question, dense passage retrieval
(DPR) trains the retriever directly using a contrastive objective [Karpukhin et al., 2020]. Retrieval
Augmented Language Modeling (REALM) [Guu et al., 2020] and Retrieval Augmented Generation
(RAG) [Lewis et al., 2020a] train the retriever and question-answering components end-to-end using
a language modeling objective. Unlike DPR, RAG, and REALM, which focus on benchmarks with
short answers, Krishna et al. [2021] use a similar system to tackle long-form question-answering
on the ELI5 dataset [Fan et al., 2019]. They ﬁnd that automated metrics like ROUGE-L are not
meaningful, which motivates our choice to use human comparisons as the main metric. Note that
the aforementioned family of methods, which rely on inner product search (Equation 1), differ from
WebGPT in that they formulate retrieval as a differentiable process. Fully differentiable retrieval has
the advantage of fast optimization; two disadvantages are that it cannot deal with non-differential
processes like using a search engine, and it is less interpretable.
Like WebGPT, some other recent work deﬁnes document retrieval or web browsing as a reinforcement
learning (RL) problem. Yuan et al. [2019] apply RL to reading comprehension benchmarks, where (as
in WebGPT) the action space includes searching and scrolling through the provided source document.
They suggest web-level QA (like WebGPT) as a direction for future work. Adolphs et al. [2021] set up
an RL problem that involves performing a series of search queries for short-form question-answering.
They train their system in two alternative ways: behavior cloning (BC) on synthetically-generated
sequences and RL. Finally, there is another body of work that uses BC and RL to control web
browsers, for automating other tasks besides question-answering [Shi et al., 2017, Gur et al., 2018].

Conclusion
We have demonstrated a novel approach to long-form question-answering, in which a language model
is ﬁne-tuned to use a text-based web-browsing environment. This allows us to directly optimize
answer quality using general methods such as imitation learning and reinforcement learning. To make
human evaluation easier, answers must be supported by references collected during browsing. Using
this approach, our best model outperforms humans on ELI5, but still struggles with out-of-distribution
questions.

A
Environment design details
Our text-based web-browsing environment is written mostly in Python with some JavaScript. For a
high-level overview, see Section 2. Further details are as follows:
• When a search is performed, we send the query to the Microsoft Bing Web Search API, and
convert this to a simpliﬁed web page of results.
• When a link to a new page is clicked, we call a Node.js script that fetches the HTML of the
web page and simpliﬁes it using Mozilla’s Readability.js.
• We remove any search results or links to reddit.com or quora.com, to prevent the model
copying answers from those sites.
• We take the simpliﬁed HTML and convert links to the special format
【<link ID>†<link text>†<destination domain>】, or
【<link ID>†<link text>】if the destination and source domains are the same. Here,
the link ID is the index of the link on the page, which is also used for the link-clicking
command. We use special characters such as 【and 】because they are rare and encoded
in the same few ways by the tokenizer, and if they appear in the page text then we replace
them by similar alternatives.
• We convert superscripts and subscripts to text using ^ and _, and convert images to the
special format [Image: <alt text>], or [Image] if there is no alt text.
• We convert the remaining HTML to text using html2text.
• For text-based content types other than HTML, we use the raw text. For PDFs, we convert
them to text using pdfminer.six. For all other content types, and for errors and timeouts, we
use an error message.
• We censor any pages that contain a 10-gram overlap with the question (or reference answer,
if provided) to prevent the model from cheating, and use an error message instead.
• We convert the title of the page to text using the format <page title> (<page domain>).
For search results pages, we use Search results for: <query>.
• When a ﬁnd in page or quote action is performed, we compare the text from the command
against the page text with any links stripped (i.e., including only the text from each link).
We also ignore case. For quoting, we also ignore whitespace, and allow the abbreviated
format <start text>━<end text> to save tokens.
• During browsing, the state of the browser is converted to text as shown in Figure 1(b).
For the answering phase (the last step of the episode), we convert the question to
text using the format <question>■, and follow this by each of the collected quotes
in the format [<quote number>] <quote page title> (<quote page domain>)
<double new line><quote extract>■.

Question dataset details
For our demonstration and comparison datasets, the vast majority of questions were taken from ELI5
[Fan et al., 2019], to which we applied the follow post-processing:
1. We included URLs in full, rather than using special _URL_ tokens.
2. We ﬁltered out questions with the title “[deleted by user]”, and ignored the selftext “[deleted]”
and “[removed]”. (The “selftext” is the body of the post.)
3. We concatenated the title and any non-empty selftext, separated by a double new line.
4. We prepended “Explain: ” to questions that were not phrased as actual questions (e.g., we
used “Explain: gravity” rather than simply “gravity”).
The ﬁnal step was performed because there is sometimes an implicit “Explain Like I’m Five” at the
start of questions. We considered a question to be phrased as an actual question if it included either a
question mark, or one of the following sequences of characters with a regex-word boundary at either
end, case-insensitively:
explain, eli5, which, what, whats, whose, who, whos, whom, where, wheres, when, whens,
how, hows, why, whys, am, is, isn, isnt, are, aren, arent, was, wasn, wasnt, were, weren,
werent, do, don, dont, does, doesn, doesnt, did, didn, didnt, can, cant, could, couldn, couldnt,
have, haven, havent, has, hasn, hasnt, may, might, must, mustn, mustnt, shall, shant, should,
shouldn, shouldnt, will, wont, would, wouldn, wouldnt
For diversity and experimentation, we also mixed in a small number of questions from the following
datasets:
• TriviaQA. This is a dataset of short-form questions taken from trivia websites [Joshi et al.,
2017].
• AI2 Reasoning Challenge (ARC). This is a dataset of grade-school level, multiple-choice
science questions [Bhakthavatsalam et al., 2021], which we converted to free-form questions
using the format <question><new line>A. <option A><new line>.... This dataset
is sub-divided into two difﬁculties, “Challenge” and “Easy”.
• Hand-written. We constructed this small dataset of miscellaneous questions written by
people trying out the model.
• ELI5 fact-check. We constructed this dataset using answers to questions from ELI5 given
by an instruction-following model.4 Each question has the following format: Fact-check
each of the claims in the following answer. <double new line>Question:
<ELI5 question><double new line>Answer: <model answer>
The numbers of demonstrations and comparisons we collected for each of these datasets are given in
Table 4.

Data collection details
To collect demonstrations and comparisons, we began by hiring freelance contractors from Upwork
(https://www.upwork.com), and then worked with Surge AI (https://www.surgehq.ai) to
scale up our data collection. In total, around 25% of our data was provided by 10 contractors from
Upwork, and around 75% by 46 contractors from Surge AI. The top 5 contractors provided around
50% of the data.
For both types of task, we provided contractors with a video and a detailed instruction document
(linked below). Due to the challenging nature of the tasks, contractors were generally highly educated,
usually with an undergraduate degree or higher. Contractors were compensated based on hours
worked rather than number of tasks completed, and we conducted a survey to measure job satisfaction
(see Appendix D).
For data quality, we put prospective contractors through a paid trial period lasting a few hours, and
manually checked their work. For comparisons, we also completed around 100 tasks ourselves for
all labelers to complete, and monitored both researcher–labeler agreement rates and labeler–labeler
agreement rates. Treating the agreement rate between a neutral label and a non-neutral label as 50%,
we measured a ﬁnal researcher-labeler agreement rate of 74%, and a labeler-labeler agreement rate of
73%.
Demonstrations took an average of around 15 minutes each, and comparisons took an average of
around 10 minutes each. Despite conventional wisdom that human labelling tasks should be quick
and repeatable, we did not think it would be straightforward to decompose our tasks into signiﬁcantly
simpler ones, but we consider this to be a promising direction for further research.
C.1
Demonstrations
We designed the demonstration interface in such a way that, as a rule, the user is given the same
information as the model, and has the same actions available. There were a couple of exceptions to
this:
1. Unlike humans, the model has no memory of previous steps. We therefore included a
summary of past actions in the text given to the model. However, we felt that it was
unnecessary to display this to humans.
2. The Scrolled <up, down> <2, 3> actions are useful for reducing the number of actions
taken, but humans are used to scrolling one step at a time. We therefore made these actions
unavailable to humans, and instead simply merged any repeated Scrolled <up, down> 1
actions that they made.
The full instruction document we provided to contractors for demonstrations can be viewed here.
C.2
Comparisons
To minimize label noise, it is important to make comparisons as unambiguous as possible. We
therefore designed the following procedure for comparing two answers to a given question:
1. Read the question, and ﬂag if it does not make sense or should not be answered (in which
case the rest of the comparison is skipped).
2. Read the ﬁrst answer and its references.
3. Rate the trustworthiness of any references relied upon by the answer.
4. Annotate each of the claims in the answer with the level of support it has and its relevance
to the question. A screenshot of the annotation tool is shown in Figure 9.
5. Repeat steps 2–4 for the second answer and its references.
6. Give comparison ratings for the amount of unsupported and irrelevant information, the
usefulness of information with different levels of support, and coherence.
7. Weighing everything up, give a ﬁnal comparison rating for overall usefulness.
17


Figure 9: Screenshot from the comparison interface, showing the annotation tool.
For each of the comparison ratings, we used a 5-point Likert scale with the options “A much better”,
“A better”, “Equally good”, “B better” and “B much better”.
Importantly, we did not require contractors to perform independent research to judge the factual
accuracy of answers, since this would have been difﬁcult and subjective. Instead, we asked contractors
to judge whether claims in the answer are supported, i.e., either backed up by a reliable reference, or
common knowledge.
For the ﬁnal comparison rating, we encouraged contractors to use their best judgment, but to roughly
consider the following criteria in descending order of priority:
• Whether or not the answer contains unsupported information.
• Whether or not the core question has been answered.
• Whether or not there is additional helpful information, which does not necessarily need to
answer the question directly.
• How coherent the answer is, and whether or not there are any citation errors.
• How much irrelevant information there is in the answer. (This can be higher priority in
extreme cases.)
The full instruction document we provided to contractors for comparisons can be viewed here.
For most of the project, we made every part of this procedure required 10% of the time, and made
every part except for the ﬁnal comparison rating optional 90% of the time. Towards the end of the
project, we removed the question ﬂags from the ﬁrst part since we felt that they were being overused,
and made the comparison ratings for unsupported information and coherence required all of the time.
Despite the complexity of this procedure, we only used the ﬁnal comparison rating in training, even
collapsing together the “much better” and “better” ratings. We experimented with predicting some of
the other information as an auxiliary loss, but we were not able to signiﬁcantly improve the validation
accuracy of the reward model. Nevertheless, we consider this to be another promising direction for
further research.

D
Contractor survey
It was valuable to gather feedback from our contractors, both to understand and improve their
process, and to monitor job satisfaction. To this end, we sent them a questionnaire with the following
questions:
• Please say how much you agree with each of the statements. (Required 5-point Likert rating
and optional comments)
1. It was clear from the instructions what I was supposed to do.
2. I found the task enjoyable and engaging.
3. I found the task repetitive.
4. I was paid fairly for doing the task.
5. Overall, I am glad that I did this task.
• What would you change about the task to make it more engaging or enjoyable? (Encouraged)
• Are there any other tools you could be given that would make it easier to complete the task

The “encouraged” questions were required questions but with instructions to put “N/A” if they really
could not think of anything (this was rare).
We surveyed all contractors who completed 32 or more tasks (thus we excluded people who dropped
out after the trial period or shortly thereafter). We did this 3 times over the course of the project: once
for demonstrations and twice for comparisons. The quantitative results from these surveys are given
in Figure 10. The vast majority of respondents reported that they enjoyed the task, were paid fairly
and were glad that they did the task overall. A signiﬁcant minority of respondents also reported that
they found the task repetitive.
“It was clear from the instructions
what I was supposed to do.”
“I found the task enjoyable
and engaging.”
“I found the task repetitive.”
“I was paid fairly for

Hyperparameters
Hyperparameters for all of our training methods are given in Tables 6 and 7. We mostly used the
same hyperparameters for the different model sizes, with the caveat that we expressed the Adam step
sizes as multiples of the pre-training Adam step sizes, which are given in Table 5.
For each training method, we implemented some form of early stopping:
1. For BC, we stopped after a certain number of epochs based on reward model score (which
usually improves past the point of minimum validation loss).
2. For RM, we stopped after a certain number of epochs based on validation accuracy.
3. For RL, we stopped after a certain number of PPO iterations based on the reward model
score for some KL budget. The KL here is measured from the BC model, and summed over
the episode. For the 175B model, we compared a couple of different KL budgets using
human evaluations, and for the 760M and 13B models, we chose KL budgets informed by
the 175B evaluations.
The points at which we early stopped are given in Table 8.
We tuned hyperparameters using similar criteria to early stopping. We used human evaluations
sparingly, since they were noisy and expensive, and put less effort into tuning hyperparameters for
the 760M and 13B model sizes. As a rule, we found the most important hyperparameter to tune to be
the Adam step size multiplier.
For BC and RM, we used Polyak–Ruppert averaging [Polyak and Juditsky, 1992], taking an
exponentially-weighted moving average (EMA) of the weights of the model as the ﬁnal check-
point. The “EMA decay” hyperparameter refers to the decay of this EMA per gradient step. For RL
(but not rejection sampling), we did not use the EMA model for the 760M or 13B reward models,
due to a bug.
For RL, most PPO hyperparameters did not require tuning, but a few points are worth noting:
• As discussed in Section 3 of the paper, the reward is the sum of the reward model score
at the end of each episode and a KL penalty from the BC model at each token. Even
though the reward is part of the environment, we treat the coefﬁcient of this KL penalty as a
hyperparameter, called the “KL reward coefﬁcient”.
• We express hyperparameters such that each timestep corresponds to a single completion
(rather than a single token), but we applied PPO clipping and the KL reward at the token
level. We also trained token-level value function networks, allowing a token-level baseline
to be used for advantage estimation, but we did not use token-level bootstrapping or discount
rates.
• We used separate policy and value function networks for simplicity, although we think that
using shared networks is a promising direction for future research.
• We used 1 epoch, since we were concerned more with compute efﬁciency than with sample
efﬁciency.
• Due to GPU memory constraints, we used 16 times as many minibatches per epoch as
the default for PPO, but this was easily compensated for by reducing the Adam step size
multiplier by a factor of 4.
• We used the same number of parallel environments and timesteps per rollout as the default
for PPO, even though it resulted in slow PPO iterations (lasting multiple hours). This is
the easiest way to ensure that PPO performs enough clipping (around 1–2% of tokens).
Compared to using fewer timesteps per rollout and fewer minibatches per epoch, we found
the KL from the BC model to grow more slowly at the start of training, making training less
sensitive to the KL reward coefﬁcient until approaching convergence. This allowed us to
replace tuning the KL reward coefﬁcient with early stopping to some extent.
• We did not use an entropy bonus, which is usually used for exploration. An entropy bonus
is equivalent to a KL penalty from the uniform distribution, but the uniform distribution
over tokens is somewhat arbitrary – in particular, it is not invariant to “splitting” a single
token into two equally-likely indistinguishable tokens. Instead, the KL reward prevents
20


entropy collapse in a more principled way. We still found it useful to measure entropy for
monitoring purposes.
• We happened to use a GAE discount rate of 1 rather than the usual default of 0.999, but we
do not expect this to have made much difference, since episodes last for well under 1,000
timesteps.
• As discussed in Section 3 of the paper, at the end of each episode we inserted additional
answering-only episodes using the same references as the previous episode, which is what
the “answer phases per browsing phases” hyperparameter refers to.
• Since some actions (such as quotes and answers) require many more tokens than others, we
modiﬁed the environment to “chunk” long completions into multiple actions, to improve
rollout parallelizability. This is what the “maximum tokens per action” hyperparameter
refers to. Note that it has a minor effect on GAE.

Minimal comparison instructions
As discussed in Section 4, for comparing WebGPT’s answers to the reference answers from the ELI5
dataset, we used a much more minimal set of instructions, for ecological validity. The full instructions
consisted of the following text:
Comparing answers (minimal version)
In this task, you’ll be provided with a question and a set of two answers. We’d like
you to provide ratings comparing the two answers for the following categories:
• Accuracy – which answer is more factually accurate?
◦Please use a search engine to fact-check claims in an answer that aren’t ob-
vious to you. Answers may have subtly incorrect or fabricated information,
so be careful!
• Coherence – which answer is easier to follow?
• Usefulness overall – all things considered, which answer would be more
helpful to the person who asked this question?
FAQ
• What should I do if there’s a URL in the question or one of the answers?
◦Please don’t click any URLs and interpret the questions and answers based
on their remaining textual content.
• What should I do if the question doesn’t make any sense, or isn’t a question?
◦Sometimes you’ll see a statement instead of a question, which you should
interpret as “Explain: ...”.
– E.g. a question titled “Magnets” should be interpreted as “Explain:
magnets” or “How do magnets work?”
◦If the question is ambiguous but has a few reasonable interpretations, stick
with the interpretation that you think is most likely.
◦If the question still doesn’t make sense (e.g. if you’d need to click on a
URL to understand it, or if it’s entirely unclear what the question means),
then click the “This question does not make sense” checkbox at the top
and submit the task.
– This should be rare, so use this sparingly.
• What should I do if the answer to the question depends on when it was asked?
◦In this case, please be charitable when judging answers with respect to
when the question was asked – an answer is considered accurate if it was
accurate at any point within the last 10 years.
– E.g. valid answers to the question “Who is the current U.S. president”
are Barack Obama, Donald Trump, and Joe Biden.
• What should I do if I only see one answer?
◦If you only see one answer, you’ll be asked to provide absolute ratings
for that answer (very bad, bad, neutral, good, or very good) instead of
comparison ratings.
– For the “usefulness overall” category, please calibrate your ratings such
that “very bad” indicates an answer that is worse than not having an
answer at all (e.g. due to being very misleading), “bad” indicates an
answer that’s about as helpful as not having an answer, and higher
ratings indicate useful answers with varying degrees of quality.

G
TriviaQA evaluation
Although WebGPT was trained primarily to perform long-form question-answering, we were inter-
ested to see how well it would perform short-form question-answering. To this end, we evaluated
WebGPT on TriviaQA [Joshi et al., 2017], a dataset of short-form questions from trivia websites. For
this evaluation, we used the WebGPT 175B BC model with a sampling temperature of 0.8 and no
rejection sampling.
To address the mismatch between WebGPT’s long-form answers and the short-form answers expected
by TriviaQA, we ﬁne-tuned GPT-3 175B to answer TriviaQA questions conditioned on the output
of WebGPT. Since this is a simple extraction task, and out of concern for test-train overlap [Lewis
et al., 2020b], we used only 256 questions for this ﬁne-tuning (with a batch size of 32 and a learning
rate of 1.5 × 10−6). This was in addition to the 143 TriviaQA demonstrations on which the WebGPT
model was trained. As an ablation, we also ﬁne-tuned GPT-3 175B in the same way, but without the
WebGPT output.
Our results are shown in Table 9, along with those of the best existing model, UnitedQA [Cheng et al.,
2021]. We report results on the TriviaQA development set splits deﬁned in Lewis et al. [2020b]. We
perform slightly better than UnitedQA-E on questions with no test-train overlap, and slightly worse
on questions with test-train overlap. We hypothesize that this difference is the result of WebGPT
being trained on far fewer TriviaQA questions.

Note that we use far more compute than UnitedQA, and also use live access to the web rather than
only the corpus provided by Joshi et al. [2017] (although we still censor trivia websites in the same
way for this evaluation). On the other hand, WebGPT was trained primarily to perform long-form
question-answering, and so the transfer to the short-form setting is notable.

H
Analysis of effect of question stance and reference point bias
In this section we investigate the impact of question “stance” (whether the question implicitly supports
or refutes some relevant belief) on the model’s accuracy, and on its tendency to support or refute that
belief in its answer. We also probe the model’s bias towards “assuming” a certain cultural reference
point with an example culturally dependent question (“What does a wedding look like?”).
H.1
Effect of question stance on factual accuracy and answer stance
We ran a small experiment to investigate the impact of question stance on the model’s answers.
Inspired by TruthfulQA [Lin et al., 2021], we chose 10 well-known conspiracy theories and 10
common misconceptions for this experiment. For each conspiracy theory or misconception, we wrote
three questions, each taking one of three stances: one expressing skepticism around the implicit belief,
one neutral about the implicit belief, and one afﬁrming the implicit belief. This resulted in the 60
questions given in Table 10. We collected answers to these questions for the three compute-efﬁcient
WebGPT models (see Section 5.2), and used these answers to look for a couple of different effects.
• Factual accuracy. First, we examined whether the stance of the question impacts the
model’s factual accuracy. To do this, we labelled each answer as accurate or inaccurate,
by fact-checking any central or speciﬁc claims in the answer, and labeling the answer as
inaccurate if a signiﬁcant number (more than around 25%) of those claims could not be
easily veriﬁed. Our results are given in Figure 11. We found suggestive evidence that, across
model sizes, questions that afﬁrm an implicit belief in a conspiracy or misconception tend
to elicit inaccurate answers from the model more often than questions that are framed in a
neutral or skeptical way. While our experiment had too small of a sample size for us to draw
deﬁnitive conclusions, it demonstrates the model’s potential to misinform users who have
erroneous beliefs in ways that reinforce those beliefs.
• Answer stance. Second, we studied whether the model mirrors the stance of the question
in the content of its response. To do this, we labelled each answer on whether it explicitly
refutes the implicit belief or explicitly afﬁrms the implicit belief. Note that in some cases
it is possible for an answer to afﬁrm the belief in the conspiracy theory or misconception
while remaining factually accurate, by including appropriate caveats. If an answer initially
afﬁrms the belief but then reverses its stance, saying for example “but this is a myth”, then
we consider it to have refuted the belief. Our results are given in Figure 12. We found that
all the models tended to refute the implicit beliefs more often than they afﬁrmed them, and
that this effect increased with model size. However, we did not ﬁnd any clear evidence that
the stance of the question has any effect on this behavior.
Given the small scale of this experiment, it would be informative to see further research on the effect
of question stance on model answers. We remark that humans exhibit sensitivity to the framing of
questions [Chong and Druckman, 2007]. In addition to this, it would be useful to study the effects
of various other factors, such as the training data collection methodology, the relative degree of
skepticism, neutrality or afﬁrmation in the questions, the relative volumes of skeptical or afﬁrming
sources on the web, and whether the questions themselves appear in the training data or on the web.
H.2
Reference point bias
Rather than having a strong stance, some questions may reveal very little information about the user,
but the model may nevertheless assume a certain cultural reference point. We refer to this as reference
point bias. To probe this phenomenon, we conducted a simple case study, in which we analyzed 64
answers from the WebGPT 175B BC model to the following question: “What does a wedding look
like?”.
In response to this question, the model tended to assume a Western, and often speciﬁcally an American,
point-of-view. Out of the 64 answers, 20 included the word “America” or “American”, and only 4
focused on a speciﬁc, named culture other than American: Vietnamese (1); Indian (1); and Croatian
(2). While 8 of 64 responses noted that there is no standard wedding, all but one of these still also
included at least one detail typical of a Western and often American wedding. And 2 of the these 8 –
including the answer with the highest reward model score – noted that there is no standard or typical
American wedding.

Figure 12: Results of experiment on effect of

The assumption of a Western and often American reference point in this case may be inﬂuenced by
the data the model has seen during pre-training, by Internet search data, by the viewpoints represented
by the contractors we worked with, and by our research team. When asked speciﬁcally “What does a
Vietnamese wedding look like?”, the model usually generates responses pertaining to Vietnamese
weddings, but these come up rarely in response to a generic question. When in doubt, the model
defaults to assuming a Western or American viewpoint in this case.
Furthermore, we also noticed that the model often makes other assumptions that exclude or erase
some identities in response to this question, for example by assuming that a couple consists of a
male groom and female bride and assuming that a bride’s father walks her down an aisle. While
our experiment was focused on probing its bias towards a Western or American point of view, we
encourage further interdisciplinary research in these and other areas of bias.

Predicting rejection sampling performance
It is helpful to be able to predict human preference of answers produced using rejection sampling
(best-of-n). To do this, we evaluate answers using a validation reward model (trained on a separate
dataset split), to try to account for the original reward model being overoptimized. For large n, the
naive Monte Carlo estimator of the expected validation reward model score requires many model
samples to produce accurate estimates. Here we describe an alternative estimator, which produces
accurate estimates more efﬁciently.
Let Q be the distribution of questions, and given a question q, let A (q) be the distribution of answers
produced by the model. Given a question q and an answer a (with references), let Rtrain (a ∣q) be
the original reward model score, and let Rval (a ∣q) be the validation reward model score. Let n be
the number of answers sampled when rejection sampling (i.e., the n in best-of-n).
To predict the Elo score corresponding to human preference for a given question q, we estimate
Rpred
n
(q) ∶= EA1,...,An∼A(q) [Rval ( argmax
a∈{A1,...,An}
Rtrain (a ∣q) ∣q)] .
To predict the overall Elo score corresponding to human preference, we estimate
EQ∼Q [Rpred
n
(Q)] .
As shown in Figure 5, this predicts human preference well for n ≤64, although we expect it to
overestimate human preference for sufﬁciently large n, as the validation reward model will eventually
become overoptimized.
The simplest way to estimate Rpred
n
(q) for a given question q is with a Monte Carlo estimator,
by repeatedly sampling A1, A2, . . . , An ∼A (q). However, this is very wasteful, since it takes n
answers to produce each estimate, and moreover, answers are not re-used for different values of n.
Instead, we sample A1, A2, . . . , AN ∼A (q) for some N ≥n, and compute
1
(N
n)
∑
1≤i1<⋅⋅⋅<in≤N
Rval (
argmax
a∈{Ai1,...,Ain}
Rtrain (a ∣q) ∣q) ,
which is an unbiased estimator of Rpred
n
(q) by linearity of expectation. This can be computed
efﬁciently by sorting A1, A2, . . . , AN by original reward model score to obtain S1, S2, . . . SN with
Rtrain (S1 ∣q) ≤⋅⋅⋅≤Rtrain (SN ∣q), and then computing

To estimate EQ∼Q [Rpred

Q ∼Q, sample A1, A2, . . . , AN ∼A (Q) for some N ≥nmax for each question Q, and for each n
take the empirical average of the above estimator over the different questions.

But we will explore the psychology and brain science behind bad words with Benjamin
Bergen, professor of cognitive science at University of California, San Diego. He’s the author of
What the F: What Swearing Reveals About Our Language, Our Brains, and Ourselves.
[2] Why Are Some Words ‘Bad’? | Vermont Public Radio (www.vpr.org)
It’s hard to give a single answer to the question of why some words are bad, while oth-
ers aren’t, because each word has a different history. Words and their meanings change over time.
So one word might be considered “bad” to one generation, and not bad 100 years later. In addition,
words carry different meanings in different families, communities, and cultures. So what is bad to
one culture might not be considered bad to another.
[3] Why Are Some Words ‘Bad’? | Vermont Public Radio (www.vpr.org)
But there are some general categories that "bad" words fall into:
“Words in general that are considered bad tend to relate to parts of our lives that we
don’t like talking about in public, like bathroom functions,” Benjamin Bergen says. Other words
that are often considered bad relate to negative ways of talking about people and their religion,
skin color, ability, gender etc. Those words are called slurs. And many people consider those the
worst kind of bad words.
Often people say bad words when they’re experiencing strong emotions, and those words are link
to our emotions. Kids are no exception. “We’ve learned since we were very young that when
people are excited, frustrated, really happy, angry or sad these are the words that they use. So
when we have these strong emotions, we use those words as well,” Bergen says.

‘Bad’ Words and Why We Should Study Them | UVA Today

We also use the term “bad word” to pick out terms that are sanctioned simply because of what
they refer to: taboo human acts, impolite biological processes and items that people ﬁnd disgusting.
[5] The Science of Curse Words: Why The &amp;@$! Do We Swear? (www.babbel.com)
For a word to qualify as a swear word it must have the potential to offend — crossing a
cultural line into taboo territory. As a general rule, swear words originate from taboo subjects.
This is pretty logical. The topic is off-limits, so the related words aren’t meant to be spoken either.
Certain topics are almost universally taboo — death, disease, excrement — you know, icky stuff.
Sex is another classic taboo, as the English “fuck,” Italian fanculo and Russian блядь
illustrate.

Table 12: An answer and references produced by one of our human demonstrators to the same
question as the one in Table 2.
Answer
Swear words, obscenities, and derogatory terms are some categories of words that society considers
‘bad’ and exempt from usage in social settings. In a more deﬁnitive approach, courts presume
harm from speech in cases involving discrimination or sexual harassment [1]. While the original
justiﬁcation for these obscenity laws was predicated on an unfounded assumption that speech can
deprave or corrupt children, and it is important to note that there is little (if any) social science data
demonstrating that a word is by itself harmful [1], it is also pertinent to consider the origin of some
derogatory words and the context of their usage to understand why they should be unacceptable in
social settings. Examples include:
-Ape/Monkey: These are considered offensive terms when used to describe a person of color
because offensive comparisons of black people to apes date back hundreds of centuries, such as
when scientists Josiah C. Nott and George R. Gliddon created the 1854 Types of Mankind (a leading
scientiﬁc text on race in its time), and they compared black people not to other (white) people
but to chimpanzees, gorillas, and orangutans. They are now, justiﬁably, considered extremely
derogatory slang. [2]
-Savage: When used as an adjective to describe acts of violence, this word is not considered
offensive, but the use of ‘savage’ as a noun to describe people dates back to a time when Christopher
Columbus was enslaving Native Americans and claiming their lands and work for his own. The
word became a slur used by white Europeans to describe Native American people. The usage stuck
around for hundreds of years, and it’s still a word that many indigenous peoples around the world
ﬁnd offensive. [3]

Courts presume harm from speech in cases involving discrimination or sexual harass-
ment. The original justiﬁcation for our obscenity laws was predicated on an unfounded assumption
that speech can deprave or corrupt children, but there is little (if any) social-science data
demonstrating that a word in and of itself causes harm. A closely related problem is the manner
in which harm has been deﬁned — harm is most commonly framed in terms of standards and
sensibilities such as religious values or sexual mores. Rarely are there attempts to quantify harm in
terms of objectively measurable symptoms (e.g., sleep disorder, anxiety).

So, where’s the problem?Ape and monkey are considered offensive terms when they’re
used to describe a person of color. It’s what is known as dehumanizing language, “language that
deprives a person of human qualities or attributes.”
Exactly when the words became slurs is unknown, but offensive comparisons of black people to
apes date back hundreds of centuries. As recently as the late 1800s, for example, when scientists
Josiah C. Nott and George R. Gliddon created the 1854 Types of Mankind (then the leading
scientiﬁc text on race), they compared black people not to other (white) people but to chimpanzees,
gorillas, and orangutans.
When used in these contexts, monkey and ape are considered extremely derogatory slang.
[3] All Of These Words Are Offensive (But Only Sometimes) (www.dictionary.com)
The word savage has taken a circuitous path through the lexicon over the years, ﬁrst
showing up in English in the 1200s from Middle English. As an adjective, it’s typically meant
“ﬁerce, ferocious, or cruel; uncivilized; barbarous.” When referring to a savage lion ripping an
antelope apart on the African Sahara, that’s all well and good.
But, the use of savage as a noun to describe human beings dates back to approximately
the 1400s. At a time when Christopher Columbus was enslaving Native Americans and claiming
their lands and work for his own, the word became a slur used by white Europeans to describe
Native American people. The usage stuck around for hundreds of years, and it’s still a word that
many indigenous peoples around the world ﬁnd offensive.

Comparison dataset release details
We are releasing a dataset of all comparisons that were marked as suitable for reward modeling
by the end of the project, totalling 19,578 comparisons. It can be downloaded from https://
openaipublic.blob.core.windows.net/webgpt-answer-viewer/comparisons.jsonl.
Each item in the dataset is a pair of records, each of which has the following ﬁelds:
• Question: The text of the question, together with the name of the dataset from which it was
taken and a unique ID. The question is the same for each record in the pair.
• Quotes: The extracts found during browsing, together with the title of the page on which
the extract was found, constructed from the HTML title and domain name of the page.
• Answer: The ﬁnal answer composed using the quotes.
• Tokens: The preﬁx that would have been given to the model in the ﬁnal step of the episode,
and the completion given by the model or human. The preﬁx is made up of the question
and the quotes, with some truncation, and the completion is simply the answer. Both are
tokenized using the GPT-2 tokenizer. The concatenation of the preﬁx and completion is the
input used for reward modeling.
• Score: The strength of the preference for the answer as a number from −1 to 1. The two
scores in each pair sum to zero, and an answer is preferred if and only if its score is positive.
For reward modeling, we treat scores of 0 as soft 50% labels, and all other scores as hard
labels (using only their sign).

Abstract
We present WebGLM, a web-enhanced question-answering system
based on the General Language Model (GLM). Its goal is to aug-
ment a pre-trained large language model (LLM) with web search
and retrieval capabilities while being efficient for real-world de-
ployments. To achieve this, we develop WebGLM with strategies
for the LLM-augmented retriever, bootstrapped generator, and hu-
man preference-aware scorer. Specifically, we identify and address
the limitations of WebGPT (OpenAI), through which WebGLM is
enabled with accuracy, efficiency, and cost-effectiveness advan-
tages. In addition, we propose systematic criteria for evaluating
web-enhanced QA systems. We conduct multi-dimensional human
evaluation and quantitative ablation studies, which suggest the
outperformance of the proposed WebGLM designs over existing
systems. WebGLM with the 10-billion-parameter GLM (10B) is
shown to perform better than the similar-sized WebGPT (13B) and
even comparably to WebGPT (175B) in human evaluation. The code,
demo, and data are at https://github.com/THUDM/WebGLM.

Introduction
Large language models (LLMs), such as GPT-3 [3], PaLM [5], OPT [37],
BLOOM [32], and GLM-130B [36], have significantly pushed the
boundary of machines’ ability on language understanding and gen-
eration. Question answering [15, 28], one of the most fundamental
language applications, has also been substantially advanced by
the recent LLM developments. Existing studies suggest that the

performance of LLMs’ closed-book QA [29] and in-context learn-
ing QA [3, 18] is comparable to supervised models, furthering our
understanding on LLMs’ potential to memorize knowledge.
However, even for LLMs, their capacity is not unlimited, and
when it comes to challenges that require sufficient rare-knowledge,
LLMs fail to meet up human expectations. Hence recent efforts
have been focused on constructing LLMs augmented from external
knowledge, such as retrieval [8, 12, 16] and web search [24]. For
example, WebGPT [24] can browse the web, answer complex ques-
tions in long form, and provide useful references correspondingly.
Despite its success, the original WebGPT method [24] is far from
real-world deployments. First, it relies on abundant expert-level
annotations of browsing trajectories, well-written answers, and
answer preference labeling, requiring considerable expenses, time,
and training. Second, the behavior cloning method (i.e., imitation
learning) requires its base model GPT-3 to emulate human experts
by instructing the system to interact with a web browser, issue oper-
ation commands (e.g., Search, Read, and Quote), and then retrieve
relevant information from online sources. Finally, the multi-turn
nature of web browsing demands intensive computation resources
and can be too slow for user experience, e.g., costing about 31
seconds for WebGPT-13B to response a 500-token prompt.
In this work, we present WebGLM—a practical web-enhanced QA
system based on the 10-billion-parameter General Language Model
(GLM-10B) [6]. An example is illustrated in Figure 1. It is efficient,
cost-effective, human preference-aware, and most importantly, of
comparable quality to WebGPT. The system employs multiple new
strategies and designs to achieve good performance, including:
An LLM-augmented Retriever: a two-staged retriever that im-
plements coarse-grained web search and fine-grained LLM-distilled
retrieval. It is inspired by the fact that LLMs like GPT-3 can natu-
rally learn to adopt correct references, and such ability could be
distilled to improve smaller dense retrievers.
A Bootstrapped Generator: a GLM-10B based answer generator
that is trained on quoted long-formed QA samples and bootstrapped
by LLM in-context learning. We discover that instead of relying on
expensive human expert writing in WebGPT, LLMs can be enabled
to learn to generate high-quality data with proper citation-based
filtering.
A Human Preference-aware Scorer: a scorer, that is trained over
online QA forums’ user thumb-up signals, is able to learn human
majority preferences on different answers. Compared to WebGPT’s
expert labeling, we prove that a proper dataset construction could
also produce a high-quality scorer.
Our extensive human evaluation and quantitative ablation re-
sults demonstrate the efficiency and effectiveness of the WebGLM
system. Specifically, WebGLM (10B) surpasses the similar-scaled
WebGPT (13B) and performs comparably to WebGPT (175B) on our
Turing test (Cf. Figure 2). WebGLM’s improvement against the only
publicly-available system—Perplexity.ai—also makes it among the
best public web-enhanced QA systems as of this submission.
To sum up, in this paper, we make the following contributions:
• We construct WebGLM, an efficient web-enhanced QA sys-
tem with human preferences. It significantly outperforms
the similar-sized WebGPT (13B) and performs comparably
to WebGPT (175B). It also surpasses Perplexity.ai—a popular
system powered by LLMs and search engines.
• We identify WebGPT’s limitations on real-world deploy-
ments. We propose a set of new designs and strategies to
allow WebGLM’s high accuracy while achieving efficient
and cost-effective advantages over baseline systems.
• We formulate the human evaluation metrics for evaluating
web-enhanced QA systems. Extensive human evaluation and
experiments demonstrate WebGLM’s strong capability and
also generate insights into the system’s future developments.

Related Work
The construction of web-enhanced QA systems is a systematic
project that requires cross-domain collaboration, including large
language models, open-domain question answering, retrieval aug-
mentation, and reinforcement learning from human feedback. Here
we briefly introduce related literature on them.
Large Language Models (LLMs). Self-supervised [19] LLMs have
attracted plenty of attention in nowadays natural language pro-
cessing (NLP). Their huge number of parameters captures and
stores versatile knowledge [20] and enables their outstanding per-
formance on various challenges. Typical LLMs include GPT-3 [3],
PALM [5], OPT [37], BLOOM [32], and GLM-130B [36]. One of
the fascinating LLM properties is prompt-based in-context learn-
ing (ICL), which allows tuning-free task transfer via prepended
demonstration samples. Recent works have been focusing on the
optimization [18, 22, 34, 39] and analysis [23, 30, 35] of ICL.
Open-domain Question Answering (Open QA). Traditional QA
datasets such as SQuAD [28] assume the reference is available.
On the contrary, open-domain QA targets the open world and is
more practical but challenging. For example, Natural Questions [15]
dataset consists of queries from the Google search engine and an-
notations from Wikipedia paragraphs. Web Questions [2] derives
open-domain questions from knowledge bases. MS Marco [25] gath-
ers passage texts and corresponding labels to questions.
However, most Open QA datasets and models are limited to
answer short answer phrases, while people usually prefer more in-
formative long-formed answers with references. A possible reason
is that constructing and evaluating long-formed QA datasets with
open-world references are difficult, requiring expert-level annota-
tions. Recent attempts include ELI5 [7] that collects queries and
long-formed answers with scores from Reddit and WebGPT [24]
which hires groups of experts and leverages up to 175-billion-
parameter GPT-3 as the backbone. WebGLM aims to provide an-
other effective and cost-effective solution for the challenge.

KDD ’23, August 6–10, 2023, Long Beach, CA, USA.
Retrieval-augmentation. Mainstream information retrieval ap-
proaches include sparse-vector-based BM25 and TF-IDF, and the
recent dense-vector-based methods such as DPR [14] and Con-
triever [10]. The idea of retrieval-augmented language models in-
troduced by REALM [8] argues the joint optimization of retriever
and language modeling. Following representative works include
RAG [16], Fusion-in-Decoder [11], and Atlas [12]. The idea of We-
bGPT also loosely falls into the field, as it asks the LLM to interact
with the browser to seek relevant information for better accuracy.
Nevertheless, it can cost intensive computation and is too slow for
practical deployment. In this work, WebGLM tackles the problem
efficiently by distilling LLMs’ knowledge to smaller retrievers.
Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF). Au-
tomated scoring of text generation is a well-established area of
research. BLEU [27] and ROUGE [17] take into account the overlap
ratio between the target and reference. METEOR [1] considers the
accuracy and recall rate of the whole corpus. Other methods, such
as BERTScore [38], evaluate using cosine similarity of contextual
embedding from deep language models. In recent years, some work
advocates learning scorers from human feedback [26, 33] via asking
models to predict human preference. The scorers, or namely reward
models, can be used to optimize the text generator via reinforce-
ment learning. Such methods, which WebGPT is also affiliated with,
have achieved great success in real-world applications.

The WebGLM System
Constructing an LLM-based web-enhanced QA system can be ex-
pensive and challenging. The web information is rich but noisy
for certain queries, and creating high-quality human answers with
references for training can be outrageously expensive. This type
of systems usually involves three critical components: retriever,
generator, and scorer.
Take WebGPT [24] as an example, which employs experts for
dataset annotation. Its retriever leverages GPT-3 to “behavior-clone”
human experts’ web-browsing trajectory to search, read, and quote.
In addition, the generator is trained on expert-written long answers
with references. And finally, the scorer learns to predict experts’
preferences over different answers, and its scores serve as rewards
for the generator’s reinforcement learning. Despite WebGPT’s pri-
mary success, its retrieval can be slow, and the data annotations
required for training the generator and scorer are too costly, signif-
icantly hindering its wide public adoptions.
In this work, we aim to build an efficient web-enhanced QA sys-
tem that understands human preferences for actual use. To combine
the advantages of LLMs and well-established open QA studies, we
present a series of new designs and strategies for our web-enhanced
QA system WebGLM based on GLM [6]:
• An LLM-augmented Retriever: we design two stages: coarse-
grained web search and fine-grained LLM-augmented dense re-
trieval [10], for finding relevant references given queries.
• A Bootstrapped Generator: we derive WebGLM-QA, an LLM-
bootstrapped quoted and long-formed QA dataset via in-context
learning and corresponding strategies to clean and refine. It in-
cludes 45k high-quality after filtering and 83k noisy but diverse
samples before filtering. The backbone of WebGLM system is a
GLM model trained on the dataset.
• A Human Preference-aware Scorer: we develop techniques to
learn human majority preference from online QA forums’ thumb-
ups instead of expensive expert feedback, and successfully train
a human preference-aware scorer for best-of-n selection.
The LLM API used for research purpose in this work is text-
davinci-003 unless specified. In the following sections, we will
introduce the algorithm and implementation details of each com-
ponent, which finally form the WebGLM pipeline sequentially.
3.1
LLM-augmented Retriever
In conventional open QA, the systems usually only retrieve from
reliable sources (e.g., Wikipedia) and fail to benefit from whole
web-scale knowledge. However, the flip side of the coin is that
wild web pages can be hard to acquire and purify. In WebGLM, we
make attempts to solve the problem via two-stage retrieval: coarse-
grained web search and fine-grained LLM-augmented retrieval.
3.1.1
Coarse-grained Web Search
We leverage third-party web search engines (i.e., Google API) to
acquire primary candidate web page URLs. In most cases, from
our observation, these pages can cover the necessary contexts
and knowledge to answer questions besides considerably abun-
dant irrelevant information. The procedures are shown in Figure 3.
Specifically, it can be roughly divided into three steps:
(1) Search: At this stage, we enter the question into the search
API and will obtain a list of URLs for potentially-relevant pages
(usually less than 10).
(2) Fetch: Then, we crawl the corresponding HTML contents ac-
cording to the URLs obtained. Since there are many candidate
pages, we improve efficiency through parallel crawling.
(3) Extract: Next, based on HTML2TEXT1, we extract the part of
text contents in the HTML pages and divide them into a list of
paragraphs according to line breaks.
Since the web crawl usually takes sufficient time, we have paid
great efforts to optimize the speed of the component to allow user-
acceptable responding speed (Cf. Figure 4). For example, in the
“Fetch” step, if the page is loaded synchronously, the loading time
will be 2-3 minutes long. The parallel asynchronous enables the
quick loading of most pages in 5s (about 98%).
3.1.2
Fine-grained LLM-augmented Retrieval
Through the first three stages, we have retrieved a number of po-
tential contexts to questions. However, many of them are still irrel-
evant even under the filtering of widely-used dense retrievers (in
our trial, up to 30% of top-ranked contexts are unrelated). As a so-
lution, WebGPT [24] uses behavior cloning (i.e., imitation learning)
to leverage LLMs’ strong language comprehensibility for reference
selection. Notwithstanding its effectiveness, the strategy is slow in
deployment and expensive in labeling.
LLMs’ Reference Adoption. To mitigate the issue, we propose
to combine smaller retrievers’ efficiency and LLMs’ strong ability
to distinguish. We take Contriever [10] as the smaller retriever in
WebGLM, an unsupervised pre-trained model that encodes texts

into embeddings and retrieves by finding the maximum inner prod-

adoption to small retrievers to improve them.

Specifically, we find LLMs can
naturally distinguish and only
adopt useful references in in-
context learning (ICL). We create
a 200-query dataset, where each
query is accompanied with 5 top-
ranked candidate references from
Contriever. We manually annotate
the relevance of each piece of reference (Cf. Table 1). We find only
68.6% of them are related. However, when we provide the query
with corresponding candidate references to GPT-3 for 1-shot in-
context learning inference (see details in Section 3.2), we discover
that the LLM would only adopt part of the references and the cor-
responding accuracy is 90.2%, far better than Contriever’s.
Augmentation Implementation. To transfer the reference adop-
tion knowledge from GPT-3 to Contriever, we leverage the GPT-3’s
reference adoption from our bootstrapped dataset WebGLM-QA
to additionally fine-tune Contrievers. As the reference marks gen-
erated by GPT-3 can be wrong sometimes, we use the citation
correction method based on Rouge-1 precision to match quota-
tions and references (see those details in Section 3.2). Therefore,
the labels we use for training are the Rouge-1 precision scores of a
query-reference pair.
In the fine-tuning, we use two Contrievers to encode questions
and references individually, and compute their inner products as the
predictions. We leverage Mean Square Error (MSE) as the loss func-
tion for the predictions and Rouge-1 precision scores to train the
Contrievers. Our further quantitative experiment demonstrates that
the augmentation significantly improves Contriever web-enhanced
QA retrieval accuracy (see Table 7 for details).
3.1.3
Speed analysis
Retrieval is no doubt the most time-consuming part in any web-
scale QA system. A slow QA system, whatever high its accuracy is,
would spoil the user experience. We report the speed of each steps
in our LLM-augmented retriever.
We sample a subset from ELI5 [7] test set to retrieve and calcu-
late the average, the median, 75% quantile, 90% quantile, and 99%
quantile time spent in each step. From Figure 4, we can know that
our average time spent is about 5.3s, the median total time spent
is about 4.07s, and 90% of searches can be loaded in 10s. The main
bottleneck of our retrieval is in the second step of fetching each
page, when we have to request multiple web pages from different
sources. Consequently, due the contents of various pages on the
network are different, some pages take very long time to load, or
just cannot be returned correctly.
In Appendix B, we conduct a more detailed analysis of retrieval
efficiency and point out that the retrieval efficiency of WebGLM is
far better than that of WebGPT.

Bootstrapped Generator
A major obstacle in building web-enhanced QA system is the high
cost for curating expert-level QA datasets that are long-formed
and properly cited. Compared to traditional or free-formed QA,

hiring experts but still create a high-quality quoted long-formed QA dataset.
we expect the system to yield fact-grounded answers with correct
references (see example in 5). WebGPT reports to hire a group of
full-time experts to write answers for training, which is far beyond
ordinary budgets.
Fortunately, LLMs’ in-context learning [3, 5], which refers to
their capabilities to transfer to new tasks conditioned on few in-
context samples, have been demonstrated and well-explored re-
cently. Thus we propose to bootstrap large amounts of quoted long
answers via leveraging a few high-quality answers, LLMs, questions
from ELI5 [7], and our retriever collected references. Additionally,
since bootstrapped samples are not always satisfying, we design
corresponding correction and selection strategies to filter out a
high-quality subset for real training. All these efforts jointly help
to create the WebGLM-QA, a quoted and long-formed QA dataset
with 45k high-quality filtered and 83k unfiltered samples.
The dataset can be formulated as a set D(Q, A, R, C), where Q,
A, R represents the question set, the answer set, and the reference
set respectively, C ⊆Q × A ×2R denotes the triple set of (question,
answer, valid references).
Different from free text generation, in web-enhanced QA each
answer 𝛼∈A contains quotations and thus is in the form of
𝛼= (< 𝑠1, ∇1 >, < 𝑠2, ∇2 >, · · · , < 𝑠𝑛, ∇𝑛>)
(1)
where < 𝑠𝑘, ∇𝑘> represents the k-th segment in answer 𝛼, 𝑠𝑘is a
piece of quoted text, and ∇𝑘⊂R is a set of references that 𝑠𝑘cites.
3.2.1
In-context Learning Inference
We adopt a subset of questions from ELI5 train set as our Q and
leverage a vanilla Contriever [10] (without LLM augmentation yet)
in fine-grained retrieval to produce references R. In this work we
first try on OpenAI text-davinci-003 API to conduct 1-shot in-
context learning inference to generate quoted long-formed answers
(while other LLMs such as GLM-130B [36] could be good options
too). Since the in-context learning can be volatile to input forms
and prompts, we take many trails to finally determine the best
bootstrapping strategies as follows:
Prompt Formulation. Since we input many contents to the API,
including a few of demonstrations (i.e., high-quality samples (𝑞𝑑,
𝛼𝑑, R𝑑)), the question, and the corresponding references, their for-
mulation could impact the performance significantly. We compare
several types of prompts, including the order between question
and its references (i.e., before or after, Cf. Figure 5 (a)), the symbols
used to mark the indices of references, and the prompt words of
references and questions. We conduct experiments with every type
of prompt we have mentioned, and finally find a natural way as
shown in Figure 5 (a) performs best.
Instruction Inducting. Next, we need a proper instruction (e.g.,
“Please write a answer based on the question and references.”) for
guiding the LLM to generate a qualified answer. Recent work [9]
suggests that we can take advantage of the LLM itself to design
instructions for in-context learning instead of human handcrafting.
We use several high-quality examples to induce a few possible
instructions (Cf. Figure 5 (b)), and select the best-performed one
based on our empirical evaluation over several queries.
Few-shot In-Context Learning. We study the best shots needed
for generating good quoted long-formed answers. Because the ref-
erence parts often occupies much of sequence length, we notice
that one-shot learning can surpass few-shot learning in terms of
answer’s quality in most time. Hence we finally choose to inference
with one-shot demonstration sample as shown in Figure 5 (c), and
finally 83k various queries and their answers have been collected.
We record the details of choosing prompts and instructions in
Appendix C.
3.2.2
Citation Correction
We have produced a large amount of well-written quoted long-
formed answers using GPT-3 in-context learning. However, in our
examination, we observe that the answers sometimes cite the wrong
or invalid (i.e., nonexistent) references in their citation numbers.
As a result, to correct the citation relationships are crucial for the
quality of WebGLM-QA dataset.


KDD ’23, August 6–10, 2023, Long Beach, CA, USA.
Liu and Lai and Yu, et al.
Despite the fact that the citation numbers can be wrong, the
contents quoted in the answer are often correct. Thus we propose
to amend the citation number according to the quotation similarity
to references, by splitting an answer into few segments by generated
citation numbers and match then to references. For a question 𝑞,
our retrieved references are defined as R and our answer can be
defined as 𝛼. We define text segments S = {𝑠1,𝑠2, · · · ,𝑠𝑛}, and for
each pair (𝑠, ∇) ∈S × R, we compute citation match scores 𝑓(𝑠,𝑟)
for 𝑟∈R. We pick a threshold 𝑇, and the final citation 𝑟for each
segment (𝑠, ∇) ∈𝛼can be described as:
∇𝑖= {𝑟|𝑓(𝑠𝑖,𝑟) ≥𝑇},𝑟∈R
For our application, we finally adopt Rouge-1 score as the 𝑓and
the threshold 𝑇selection is introduced in the Section 3.2.3.
3.2.3
Filtering
After correction, we further investigate more issues that could
potentially influence the dataset quality. And in short, we discover
that most of them are related or could be solved via checking the
citation quality. We will discard a piece of generated sample if it
presents any problems in the following:
• Hallucination [13]: the answer leverages the internal knowl-
edge of LLMs instead of references, which is not factual-grounded
and sometimes severely wrong. It can be identified via the low
overlapping ratio between all references and the answer.
• Few citations: when an answer cites too few of the provided
references, it usually presents poor reference relevance and thus
often not informative and factual-grounded enough.
• Low citation accuracy: if an answer have too many wrong
citation numbers, we assume it as a low-quality one.
We calculate the F1 for the similarity and overlapping calculation.
We test Rouge-L (whose best threshold is 0.4) and Rouge-1 (whose
best one is 0.57) on a set of manually checked samples, and find
that Rouge-1 is better. It is due to the fact that LLMs would often
rewrite and paraphrase the reference contents including exchang-
ing phrase orders. In that case, a high-quality answer may hold a
high informative Rouge-1 score, but a low Rouge-L score, which
computes the longest common subsequence co-occurrence.
After all the filtering conditions mentioned above, the number of
samples drops from 83k to 45k, which becomes a high quality quoted
long-formed QA dataset for web-hanced QA system training. We
train the GLM [6], a type of bidirectional LM that is pre-trained on
autoregressive blanking infilling (including a 10-billion-parameter
and a 2-billion-parameter one), over the WebGLM-QA as our back-
bone generator.
3.3
Human Preference-aware Scorer
In preliminary testing, our bootstrapped generator under beam-
search decoding strategy already performs satisfyingly in many
cases. However, recent literature [24, 26, 33] demonstrates that
aligning human purposes and preference to LLMs are crucial for
expert-level text generation. WebGPT reports to recruit many ex-
perts to provide comparison and ranking over generated answers
and make use of the feedback to train a reward model (RM) for pick-
ing best-of-n (i.e., 16/32/64) generated candidates and additionally
optimize the generator via reinforcement learning (RL).
Nevertheless, such expert annotations could be expensive to
acquire and the RL would consume much computation resource.
In this work, as a competitive substitute, we propose to build a
human preference-aware scorer based on massive user feedback
(e.g., thumb-ups) from online QA forums. Under appropriate designs
and elaborate data cleaning, we show in our experiments that such
scorer also significantly improve the alignment-level of answers
and the scoring in real human evaluation.
Data collection and preprocessing. We first collect QA pairs and
corresponding user thumb-ups from online QA forums. Despite
their diversity, these answers are of so various lengths and qual-
ities that the scorer would learn little from them without proper
preprocessing.
Our preprocessing includes the following requirements:
• High quality feedback: we define the answer with more than
3 thumb-ups as an answer with valid feedback. We pick out
questions with 8 or more valid answers as qualified ones.
• Length-bias mitigation: we notice that the score prefers longer
answers rather than the better ones in preliminary study, as is
also indicated in literature [26, 33]. To mitigate the bias, for each
qualified question, we use the median length 𝑥of all the answers
as the threshold to truncate longer answers and discard those
lengths are less than 𝑥/2.
• Contrast augmentation: after sorting the answers by their
thumb-ups, the gaps between neighboring answers turn out nar-
row. Scorers trained on such uninformative dataset present poor
performance. To increase the contrast between answers for com-
parison training, we select a pair of answers of more than 5 in
rank positions. In each pair, the answer with greater amount of
likes is the better response.
After our prepossessing, there are 93k questions and 249k com-
parison pairs in total, with 230k pairs as the training set and 19k
pairs as the test set. Next, we introduce the implementation details
for training our human preference-scorer. The backbone model for
training scorer is a 6-billion-parameter GLM.
Supervised fine-tuning (SFT). In SFT step, we leverage the Reddit
TL; DR dataset for first fine-tuning the scorer following [33]. We
train 16 epochs with cosine learning rate decay and 2.83e-5 as
beginning learning rate. We use the SFT model for initialization of
comparison training.
Comparison training. We pass pairs of comparison data to the
model to yield a scalar score for each of the question-answer pair
and maximize the gap between their scores. We use a linear head
with the input dimension of hidden size and the output dimension
of 1 to produce the score.
During the training, we find that the scorer tends to overfit
quickly. Therefore, we freeze first 70% transformer layers and lever-
age other techniques such as dropouts and large batch size for
regularization. Notwithstanding, the scorer would overfit after 1-
1.5 epochs anyway. After the training completes, we calibrate its
predictions to standard normal distribution based on the training
set reward distribution.

Human Evaluation Criteria
Automatic metrics to score model-generated answers can perform
well in terms of short-formed ones. However, for open-domain
long-formed QA with references, the answers and rationales can
be subjective and versatile, especially for those questions that start
with "HOW" and "WHY." As a result, human evaluation is vitally
needed, for which there have been many studies [4, 31].
To evaluate WebGLM and appropriately compare it to other
similar models, we introduce a human evaluation criteria system
to evaluate both references and answers. We adopt both binary
(for those objective metrics, e.g., truthfulness) and four-level score
(for those subjective metrics, e.g., fluency) balancing objectivity
and scale in human evaluation. The four-level score is applied as is
suggested in the literature that it avoid human annotators to keep
absolutely neutral [31]. For each criterion we mention below, an
arrow follows. up arrow (↑) means higher score performs better,
while down arrow (↓) denotes lower score performs better.
4.1
Reference Evaluation
In this section, we introduce human evaluation criteria on refer-
ences. The evaluation is done on per question-reference pair.
Relevancy ([0, 3], ↑). For retrieved documents or references related
to a question, the more related, the higher relevancy score should
be. Specifically, different references to a question can share high
relevancy scores simultaneously.
Density ([0, 3], ↑). To evaluate how much useful information is in
a piece of reference, we need to estimate its information density.
Both relevancy and density are criteria to evaluate informa-
tiveness, but there is difference between them. Relevancy can be
regarded as a "recall metric" for informativeness, while density can
be regarded as a "precision metric".
Truthfulness ([0, 1], ↑). Retrieved references can be factually
wrong even they are closely associated to the question. It is be-
cause the web information sources are open and could contain
user-submitted information without correctness check. As a result,
the truthfulness of a piece of reference should be evaluated, and its
evaluation does not consider the question.
Toxicity ([0, 1], ↓). Web texts could involve violent, pornographic,
offensive words or other improper elements. Thus, it is necessary
to assess toxicity of references retrieved.
Social Bias ([0, 1], ↓). Potential biases on the internet could related
to genders, races, nations, and ages. We should also exclude them
from our system.
4.2
Answer Evaluation
In this section, we introduce human evaluation criteria on answers,
which are evaluated triple-wise (i.e., (question, answer, references)).
Fluency ([0, 3], ↑). Fluency measures the quality of generated
text itself only, without taking questions and references into ac-
count [4]. It concerns only elements such as grammar, word, and
phrase choices that are affiliated to the language aspect.
Correctness ([0, 3], ↑). Correctness measures the coherence of
the answer and its corresponding question. If an answer solves
the question satisfyingly, we say it holds a high correctness. Addi-
tionally, when we score the correctness of an answer, we should
take factual consistency into account. For example, contradicting
common sense or defying logic will decrease the correctness.
Citation Accuracy ([0, 3], ↑). The metric only considers the rela-
tionships between an answer and its references. When an answer
contains citation marks, we should check if it is correct. Citation
mistakes or missing citation will both decrease the accuracy.
Truthfulness ([0, 1], ↑). Similar to truthfulness in the reference
evaluation, truthfulness of an answer measures whether the text
of the answer is factually sound, including the factual consistency
of the answer and whether the answer contains contradictions or
hallucinate information.
Objectivity ([0, 1], ↑). The metric only concerns the relationships
between an answer and its references. When references provided,
models are supposed to generate answers according to these refer-
ences without its using its latent knowledge from pre-training. If we
can find all the information of an answer from provided references,
we say it is objective.
Redundancy ([0, 1], ↓). Within the limited text length, duplicate
content will reduce informativeness. As the lower redundancy, the
higher quality of the answer, we take it into our consideration.
The detail of the metrics and the meaning of the score can be
found in the Appendix H.

Experiment
In this section, we conduct experiments employing the metrics
mentioned in Section 4 to evaluate and analyze the quality of the
responses generated, including those from WebGLM and other
similar systems. We also report quantitative ablation studies on
certain components in WebGLM.
5.1
Main Results
We conduct the major evaluation using the 272 questions provided
on WebGPT [24] demo website2, as the WebGPT is not publicly
available and selected questions are generally complicated and
closer enough to real human questions.
Human Evaluation Setup. We recruited 15 master-degree level
experts to conduct human evaluation. For each question, we aggre-
gate all the search results and answers from different models into
one table, enabling the annotators to effectively compare them and
unify the annotation standards. We evaluate the performance of our
model and other different models from various dimensions through
human evaluation. We also compare and analyze the results from
different perspectives as follows. The main results are shown in
Table 2.
WebGLM Reference vs Other References. Although the search
results of WebGLM are slightly inferior to WebGPT-175B, its per-
formance is far better than that of Perplexity.ai and WebGPT-13B. It
is worth mentioning that the WebGLM retrieval process only uses
some traditional, word-based algorithms and two Contrievers with
a cumulative parameter amount of no more than 300M. WebGLM
is significantly superior to WebGPT in computing performance and

model and close to that of the 175B model.
WebGLM vs Other Systems. Finally, we compare our system with
the results of WebGPT-13B, Perplexity.ai, and WebGPT-175B. Our
system has achieved the highest performance in fluency, truthful-
ness, and redundancy. At the same time, we are close to WebGPT-
175B in the correctness metric with a score of 2.81, which is far
higher than that of Perplexity.ai and WebGPT-13B, indicating that
our system can still achieve superior performance at a lower cost.
5.2
Turing Test
To further compare our performance, we design a Turing test [21]
to check the answers’ quality.
Setup. We randomly sampled 200 items from the 272 questions
that WebGPT has displayed on their official web page. For each
question, we shuffle the answers generated by WebGLM, WebGPT-
175B, WebGPT-13B, and Perplexity.ai, and remove citation marks
from them for fairness. We next mix an answer written by humans
into these answers and ask evaluators to rank the answers by their
quality, such as correctness, informativeness, and truthfulness.

𝐵, we call 𝐴wins and 𝐵loses. Firstly, we compare each pair of the
answers, the win rate is shown in Figure 6. Besides, We calculate
the win rates against humans for each system. The result is shown
in Figure 2. We hold a 43% win rate, definitely beat Perplexity.ai
with a 21% win rate and WebGPT-13B with an 18% win rate, and
almost draw with WebGPT-175B with a 45% win rate.

Test on QA Benchmarks
We randomly sample 400 questions on Natural Question and Web
Question, and evaluate WebGLM and Perplexity.ai on them. The
results in Table 3 show that WebGLM outperform Perplexity.ai.

In addition, we conducted experiments on the full validation
split of TriviaQA (same as WebGPT). Following the testing method
employed by WebGPT, we first generated a long answer for each
question using WebGLM. We then used Google Bigbird, fine-tuned
on the TriviaQA training set3, to answer TriviaQA questions based
on the output of WebGLM. To address potential test-train overlap
issues mentioned in WebGPT, we also conducted TriviaQA tests on
different train-test splits. The results are summarized in Table 4.
5.4
Ablation Study
In this section, we study the major improvements and strategies
in WebGLM, including the bootstrapped dataset filtering, scorer
training, LLM-augmented retriever and some other minor topics.
5.4.1
WebGLM-QA Filtering Since we build our training dataset
based on LLM in-context bootstrapping, the dataset quality could be
essential for WebGLM’s success. We randomly sample 210 examples
from these versions of our dataset to verify the filtering strategies
they are based on, including 1) None, 2) Rouge-L filtered, and 3)
Rouge-1 filtered.
We randomly shuffle all the samples and distribute them to eval-
uators, and then collect and calculate the average score of each
metric. The sample results are shown in Table 5 We analyze this re-
sult from two perspectives. One is the absolute performance of our

final version of the dataset. The other is comparing the performance
of our different versions of datasets.
We find that our dataset holds a high factual consistency and
correctness, and the majority of our data are judged as perfectly
correct. We have also noticed that the information relevancy and
density are considerably improved when we apply a filter method
and when we change Rouge-L to Rouge-1. As for the answer, we find
that correctness has great improvement when we apply any one
of the two filters, and factual consistency has a great improvement
when we change the Rouge-L filter to Rouge-1. Besides, objectivity
is also one of the most important criteria that we care about, and we
find that it’s more likely to discard subjective answers with a Rouge-
1 filter than with a Rouge-L filter. As a result, our experiments show
that citation accuracy is closely related to the reference quality and
answer quality, so our filter method is effective.
Besides, We train the GLM-2B models on each dataset and eval-
uate them with our designed metrics to see the impact of these
datasets on our model’s performance. We show the results in Ta-
ble 6. We find that the answers of the three models showed little
difference in the correctness metric. However, the performance
of the model trained by rouge-1 was better in fluency, citation
accuracy, and objectivity metrics. This result further proves the
advantages of the dataset of rouge-1. Therefore, we decide to train
our 10B model on the dataset of rouge-1.
5.4.2
LLM-augmented Retriever In terms of the usefulness of ref-
erences, we have compared our method with traditional methods
such as BM25, TF-IDF, and the original version of Contriver.

We collect 22000 examples from WebGLM-QA, and for each
question, we calculate Rouge-1 precision score 𝑝of corresponding
answer 𝑎and each of the reference 𝑟, and then label the reference-
answer pair (𝑟,𝑎) as 𝑝. Finally, we gain a training dataset containing
20000 examples and a test dataset containing 2000 examples.
For all answers to the same question, we compare the order
predicted by retrieve methods with the answer relevancy order.
The results are shown in Table 7. We notice that before the LLM
task augmentation, the Contriever performs even poorer than tradi-
tional lexical-based approaches. After augmenting knowledge from
GPT-3’s reference adoption labeling, we find that ours, which holds
a 69.36 pair-wise choosing accuracy and 62.26 spearman index,
performs best. The evidence strongly advocates that the LLM aug-
mentation is vital when we use pre-trained smaller dense retrievers
in practice.
5.4.3
Human Preference-aware Scorer In this section we compare
several different scorer training strategies and datasets. We discover
that proper task formulation and larger and more diverse dataset
yield better results.
Baseline and data preprocessing. We first train RoBERTa-large
in the classification task and the regression task formulation, and
the 6-billion-parameter GLM on the ELI5’s training set (with thumb-
ups) as our baselines. In the classification task, we collect all items
whose count of answers is not less than 10 from ELI5. For each
collected question, we label top-5-voted answers as positive, and
randomly pick 5 answers from other questions as negative examples.

Figure 7: Average score of answers in ELI5 test set. It is sorted
by likes in the ELI5 test set. The best answer is around 0% and the
worst answer is around 100%.
In the regression task, we collect all items whose count of answers is
not less than 5 from ELI5. For each collected question, we complete
the following steps:
(1) for each answer to this question, supposing its corresponding
up-vote is 𝑢, we firstly label this answer as log2 (𝑢+ 1).
(2) Then, we scale labels of all answers to this question to [0, 1].
(3) Let 𝑥be the summation of the answers’ label, we randomly pick
⌊𝑥⌋answers from other questions as negative examples with
label −1.
In order to obtain a large train set (which has been suggested very
important in [33]), we adopt a relatively loose screening method,
which selects the questions with more than 5 answers and answers
with no less than 100 words in length. Our large train set includes
28.2k questions and 191.6k pairs. We use the ELI5 test set with
thumb-ups for our final evaluations.
Metrics. We select three metrics to measure the ability of the
reward model to distinguish responses of different quality, namely
accuracy, Spearman coefficient, and NDCG (Normalized Discounted
Cumulative Gain). Accuracy refers to the accuracy of selecting
better answers in pairs. Spearman and NDCG measure the sorting
ability of the model.
The ranking evaluation of different models is shown in Table 9.
We find that WebGLM human preference-aware scorer performs
best on accuracy and Spearman coefficient. Under the same amount
of training tokens, the performance of the reward model is slightly
worse than that of RoBERTa classification and RoBERTa regression,
but after increasing the amount of training, the performance of the
reward model will increase significantly.
Figure 7 shows the average reward of the answers at different
positions in the sequence sorted by likes in the ELI5 test set. The
best answer is around 0% and the worst answer is around 100%.
We find that the curve of the WebGLM Human Preference-aware
Scorer is more discriminative than other models, and the rewards
of the best answer are higher than that of others.
5.4.4
Ablation Study on Each Component We added some exper-
iments to conduct ablation studies on each component. We com-
pared the three sub-modules of the system: Retriever, Generator,
and Scorer. The results are shown in Table 8.
In the Retriever module, we compared the performance on the
settings of WebGPT-175B, WebGLM, and non-retrieval. From the
Table 8, the performance on WebGLM retrieval is similar to that of
WebGPT-175B and significantly better than non-retrieval.
Regarding the Generator module, we compared the response
quality of WebGLM and GPT-3 on WebGLM retrieval setting. We
found that WebGLM performed slightly better than GPT-3 in flu-
ency, correctness, accuracy, citation accuracy, objectivity, and truth-
fulness.
In terms of Scorer, we compared the response quality of We-
bGLM removing and retaining Reward Models. The results show
that by WebGLM-10B top-p sampling and reward model scoring
method, We found through the human evaluation results that the
answers scored high by the reward model excel the original re-
sults in fluency, correctness, citation accuracy, truthfulness, and
redundancy. It shows the importance of the reward model scoring
mechanism to model performance.

Conclusion
We build the LLM-based question-answering system—WebGLM—
with a web retrieval method. We propose a fast and cost-effective
method to retrieve valuable information from the Internet. We lever-
age GPT-3’s in-context learning ability to build a LLM-bootstrapped
quoted and long-form QA dataset, which is used to train our model.
Further, we train a human preference-aware scorer and use it to
give marks to responses generated by our model. For each question,
the scorer can select the highest-scored response from candidates,
thus obtaining a final answer humans prefer the most. We con-
duct extensive experiments, including both the human evaluation
and the Turing test, to demonstrate the competitive performance
of WebGLM with some of the pioneering web-enhanced question
answering systems like Perplexity.ai and WebGPT.

Additional Experimental Results
A.1
WebGLM vs Others in WebGPT Reference
We compared the generation results of WebGLM-Rouge1, WebGPT-
175B, and GPT-3 on the WebGPT-175B references. For GPT-3, we
also use the method of automatically constructing datasets to gener-
ate responses for the WebGPT samples to compare the effect of the
WebGLM system. Specifically, we use the references of WebGPT to
let GPT-3 do in-context learning to answer questions according to
the search results. We use human evaluation to compare the quality
of the three answers. The experimental results are shown in Ta-
ble 10. Although our model size is more than ten times smaller than
GPT-3 and WebGPT-175B, we can effectively compensate for the
impact of the model size and achieve competitive performance in
the retrieval paradigm. Our model matches WebGPT-175B and GPT-
3 on correctness, citation accuracy, objectivity, and truthfulness
metrics and outperforms them on fluency and redundancy.

Detailed Efficiency Analysis
At the retrieval stage, we only search for one time, then take the
first few results links to fetch the web pages in parallel. We then
extract all paragraphs and rank these paragraphs by Contriever,
and finally take the top 5 paragraphs as references. Let 𝑡𝑠, 𝑡𝑓, 𝑡𝑒,
and 𝑡𝑟denote the time we consume in four steps, so the total time
we consume is 𝑡𝑠+ 𝑡𝑓+ 𝑡𝑒+ 𝑡𝑟.
WebGPT simulates the operations in a virtual browser environ-
ment while obtaining references. For the 272 questions they showed,
we count the types of actions and the average number of generated
tokens as shown in Table 11 and 12. Then we calculate the average
time it takes to browse. Assuming that the total time 𝑀(𝑀is either
WebGPT-175B or WebGPT-13B) takes to generate commands in the
browsing process of each question is expected to be 𝑡𝑐(𝑀), the time
𝑀consumes 𝑇(𝑀) satisfies the following equations.
𝑇(WebGPT-175B) = 𝑡𝑐(WebGPT-175B) + 𝑡𝑠∗3.82 + 𝑡𝑓∗6.96 (2)
𝑇(WebGPT-13B) = 𝑡𝑐(WebGPT-13B) + 𝑡𝑠∗4.05 + 𝑡𝑓∗7.56
(3)
We test the efficiency of GPT-3. With a 500-token prompt, the
175B model generates about 20 tokens per second, and the 13B
model generates 100 tokens per second, meaning that:
𝑡𝑐(WebGPT-175B) = 580.08 tokens/query
20 tokens/second
= 29 seconds
(4)
𝑡𝑐(WebGPT-13B) = 580.08 tokens/query
100 tokens/second = 5.8 seconds
(5)
In practice, 𝑡𝑠, 𝑡𝑓, 𝑡𝑒, and 𝑡𝑟are about 1.81, 2.38, 0.29, and 0.89
respectively. So we consume 5.36 seconds for one query on average.
Nevertheless, assuming in the same network circumstance, the time
consumption of WebGPT models can be calculated by Equation 2
and 3.
𝑇(WebGPT-175B) = 52.48 seconds
(6)
𝑇(WebGPT-13B) = 31.12 seconds
(7)
Therefore, WebGPT-175B costs 52.48 seconds, and WebGPT-13B
costs 31.12 seconds. Our efficiency can be about 10 times that of
WebGPT-175B and 6 times that of WebGPT-13B.

Choice of Prompts and Instructions
Firstly, we attempt the zero-shot approach for bootstrapping data.
To produce data with appropriate citation marks, we require specific
instructions. We experiment with several methods, however, they
are all limited in their effectiveness.
Use a mark for each helpful reference you cited,
such as [1]. Limitation: bootstrapped data contain mixed usage
of [1][2] and [1, 2].
Use a mark for each helpful reference you cited, such
as [1]. If there are multiple citations at one position,
please use a format like [1][2][3]. Limitation: bootstrapped
data contain citations of useless references.
Use a mark for each helpful reference you cited, such
as [1]. If there are multiple citations at one position,
please use a format like [1][2][3]. If a reference is
useless, do not cite it. Limitation: useless references are still
cited. This method do not work.
We then select few-shot context to bootstrap data. If we provide
too many references or in-context examples, it is easy to exceed the
token count limit. Therefore, we choose to use an 1-shot example
and 5 references. We also include some useless references in the
example, which are not cited in the answer.
After that, We conduct experiments on prompts and demonstrate
that placing the question after the references is the most effective
approach.
Regarding instruction induction for in-context learning, we ex-
periment with the previously mentioned examples as well as some
new ones, such as:
Answer the question based on the following references
with citations. Use a mark for each helpful reference
you cited, such as [1]. If there are multiple citations
at one position, please use a format like [1][2][3]. If
a reference is useless, do not cite it.
I will provide you with some references. Based on the
references, please answer my question. Pay attention
that you should be objective, and you should not use
your knowledge. Use a mark for each helpful reference
you cited, such as [1]. If there are multiple citations
at one position, please use a format like [1][2][3]. If
a reference is useless, do not cite it.
However, these instructions are too verbose, and in the presence
of examples, the model’s performance is not significantly impacted
by the instructions. Therefore, we adopt a more natural approach
to generate instructions[9] to produce a natural instruction that is
interpretable by the model.
Finally, we use a very concise instruction: Read the references
provided and answer the corresponding question.
In addition, we compared models trained with different prompt
strategies, and the results are shown in the Table 13. From the
"Correctness" column, we can see the significant difference that the
order of references and question in the prompt makes.

Question
Why were the cities that are capital cities chosen as capitals?
References
[1] Reasons differ from state to state as to why the capital city was chosen. In some cases, state officials wanted the capital
located in the geographic center of their states. Jefferson City and Pierre were chosen as capitals of Missouri and South Dakota
respectively for this reason. In other instances, a capital site may be picked because of its location relative to other cities.
Florida chose the city of Tallahassee to be its capital in 1824 because it was situated halfway between St. Augustine and
Pensacola, the state’s two largest cities at the time. Some capital locations were picked because they were centers of trade and
transportation. This is why Albany, located near the Hudson River, was picked as New York’s capital.
[2] - The selection or founding of a "neutral" capital city, one unencumbered by regional or political identities, was meant to
represent the unity of a new state when Ankara, Bern, Brasília, Canberra, Madrid, Ottawa and Washington became capital
cities. Sometimes, the location of a new capital city was chosen to terminate actual or potential squabbling between various
entities, such as in the cases of Brasília, Canberra, Ottawa, Washington, Wellington and Managua.
[3] - However a country decides on its capital, that city becomes an important symbol of nationhood. While being a home to
its inhabitants and a place for tourists to visit, it is also the city chosen to represent the entire country to the world.
[4] State capitals are important because they house the governments of their states, with a meeting place for the state legislature.
Many meeting buildings are called capitols, which are distinguished from capitals in that capitol refers to buildings while
capital always references a city. Cities are chosen to be the capital for differing reasons, sometimes because it was located in
the center of the state, like Jefferson City, or was a center of commerce, like Albany. Today, many capitals are not the largest
city in their states and can be overshadowed by bigger cities, but retain important historical value.

Answer
The reasons why cities are chosen as capitals vary from state to state. In some cases, state officials wanted the capital located in
the geographic center of their state[1][4], while in other instances, a capital site may be picked because of its location relative
to other cities[1]. Some capital cities were picked because they were centers of trade and transportation[1], or to represent the
unity of a new state[1][2][4]. In some cases, the location of a new capital city was chosen to terminate actual or potential
squabbling between various entities[1][2]. Cities are chosen to be the capital because they house the governments of their
states, with a meeting place for the state legislature[1][4]. Today, many capitals are not the largest city in their states and can
be overshadowed by bigger cities, but retain important historical value[4]. The capital city also represents the entire country
to the world[3].

Question
What is the difference between sigma bonds and pi bonds?
References
from
WebGLM
[1] Sigma bonds are often formed by the combination of s orbitals in different atoms whereas pi bonds are formed from
the combination of p and similar orbitals in different atoms.
[2] The main differences between sigma and pi bonds has to do with their formation and strength. Sigma bonds are formed
by direct head to head overlap between orbitals while pi bonds are formed by side to side overlap, usually between p
orbitals. This difference in formation leads to a difference in strength. Sigma bonds are stronger than pi bonds because the
direct head to head overlap provides a bigger (and therefore stronger) overlap than the side to side overlap of pi bonds.
Additionally, sigma bonds form single bonds and can exist without a pi bond present; however, a sigma bond must already
be formed for a pi bond to form.
[3] Sigma and pi bonds are two types of covalent bonds formed by the overlapping of atomic orbitals. Sigma bonds form
by the direct head to head overlap of atomic orbitals and can occur between s-s, p-p and s-p orbitals. Pi bonds form by the
side to side overlap of p orbitals.
[4] The sigma bond is stronger than the Pi bond, according to quantum mechanics, since the orbital paths of Pi bonds are
parallel, resulting in less overlap between the p-orbitals. Two atomic orbitals come into contact with each other through
two areas of overlap, forming Pi bonds.

Question
What is the difference between sigma bonds and pi bonds?

WebGPT-175B
[1] Pi bonds are formed by the sidewise positive (same phase) overlap of atomic orbitals along a direction perpendicular to
the internuclear axis. During the formation of 𝜋bonds, the axes of the atomic orbitals are parallel to each other whereas
the overlapping is perpendicular to the internuclear axis. This type of covalent bonding is illustrated below. [Image: Pi
Bonds] Pi Bonds are generally weaker than sigma bonds, owing to the significantly lower degree of overlapping. Generally,
double bonds consist of one sigma and one pi bond, whereas a typical triple bond is made up of two 𝜋bonds and one 𝜎
bond. It is important to note that a combination of sigma and pi bonds is always stronger than a single sigma bond.
[2] In chemistry, sigma bonds (𝜎bonds) are the strongest type of covalent chemical bond. They are formed by head-on
overlapping between atomic orbitals. Sigma bonding is most simply defined for diatomic molecules using the language and
tools of symmetry groups. In this formal approach, a 𝜎-bond is symmetrical with respect to rotation about the bond axis.
By this definition, common forms of sigma bonds are 𝑠+𝑠, 𝑝𝑧+ 𝑝𝑧,𝑠+ 𝑝𝑧𝑎𝑛𝑑𝑑𝑧2 +𝑑𝑧2 (where z is defined as the axis of the
bond or the internuclear axis). Quantum theory also indicates that molecular orbitals (MO) of identical symmetry actually
mix or hybridize. As a practical consequence of this mixing of diatomic molecules, the wavefunctions 𝑠+ 𝑠𝑎𝑛𝑑𝑝𝑧+ 𝑝𝑧
molecular orbitals become blended. The extent of this mixing (or hybridization or blending) depends on the relative
energies of the MOs of like symmetry.
[3] A sigma bond is stronger than a pi bond. The reason is that the overlapping of atomic orbitals can take place to a
greater extent during the formation of a sigma bond, whereas overlapping of orbitals occurs to a smaller extent during
the formation of a pi bond. A pi bond between two atoms is formed only in addition to a sigma bond. The reason is that
the atoms constituting a single bond prefer to form a strong sigma bond rather than a weak pi bond. Thus, a pi bond is
always present in molecules with multiple bonds, i.e., double or triple bonds. In other words, a single bond cannot be a pi
bond. There can be free rotation of atoms around the sigma bonds. Free rotation of atoms around pi bonds is not possible
because it involves breaking the pi bonds.

[1] What is the difference between Sigma Bond and pi Bond? • Sigma bonds are formed by head to head overlapping of
orbitals, whereas pi bonds are formed by the lateral overlapping. • Sigma bonds are stronger than pi bonds. • Sigma bonds
can be formed between both s and p orbitals whereas pi bonds are mostly formed between p and d orbitals. • The single
covalent bonds between atoms are sigma bonds. When there are multiple bonds between atoms, pi bonds can be seen. •
pi bonds result in unsaturated molecules. • Sigma bonds allow free rotation of atoms whereas pi bonds restrict the free
rotation.
[2] A sigma bond (𝜎bond) is a bond formed by the overlap of orbitals in an end-to-end fashion, with the electron density
concentrated between the nuclei of the bonding atoms. A pi bond (𝜋bond) is a bond formed by the overlap of orbitals in a
side-by-side fashion with the electron density concentrated above and below the plane of the nuclei of the bonding atoms.
[3] In a sigma bond, the electrons are in orbitals between the nuclei of the bonding atoms (in the plane of electron density),
where electron density is greatest. The end-to-end axial overlap of electrons attracts the nuclei to form a strong bond. In a
pi bond, the p-orbitals overlap side-to-side above and below the nuclei (equatorial plane), so this attraction is more of a
"sideways" pull as opposed to a direct line of pulling. Additionally, the election density is spread out over a greater area.
Thus, sigma bonds are stronger than pi bonds.

Question
When electronics show black, the pixels are not off. Wouldn’t that use less energy, and show truer black?
WebGLM
displaying black on OLED screens does use less power than displaying white, because the LEDs that make up each pixel
are off when displaying black. However, this is not the case for LCD monitors, where white is actually slightly more
energy efficient than black. This is because LCD monitors rely on an array of thin-tube fluorescent bulbs that provide a
constant source of light to create a white screen, and to make it black, LCDs rely on a diffuser to block this light. Therefore,
displaying black does not necessarily use less energy, and may not even show truer black than white.
WebGPT-175B
Most computer and mobile device displays do not use black pixels to save energy. Instead, they use an array of thin-tube
fluorescent bulbs to provide a constant source of light to create a white screen. To make it black, LCDs rely on a diffuser to
block this light. As a result, LCDs use more energy than CRTs to display a black screen. Measuring a 17-inch (43-centimeter)
LCD monitor, Schindler found that white required 22.6 watts, while black came in a tad higher at 23.2 watts. With a 20-inch
(50.8-centimeter) LCD, black required 6 percent more energy than white. In contrast, AMOLED displays don’t have a
backlight at all. Instead, each pixel is like a tiny red, blue, or green colored light. If the screen is instructed to display black,
it doesn’t need to block any light, it simply doesn’t light up any of the little colored sub-pixels. As a result, black pixels
save you a lot of power because those pixels can be turned completely off.
WebGPT-13B
It depends on the resting state of the LCD as to whether they require energy to stop light or to allow light to pass through,"
Heap explains. "This is why screen tests show that some CCFL (cold cathode fluorescent lamp) LCD screens save energy
and some use a bit more. All of the scientific test data we have come across shows a slight saving on black LCD screens,
which suggests that the rest state on many LCD screens does not allow light through." Heap also points out that a large
number of Blackle users come from India and South America, where CRTs are still commonly sold. Most LCD devices use
a backlight which is always on. When an LCD is black, it is doing full light output, and then also blocking all of that light
to create the appearence of black. If a monitor is displaying all-black, most will reduce power to the backlight accordingly,
primarily to produce a deeper black, and of course also to save power.
Perplexity AI
While it is true that black pixels use less energy than white pixels on some displays, such as OLEDs, this is not always the
case. On LCDs, for example, black pixels still require power to be lit up. Additionally, the amount of energy used by a pixel
depends on its color intensity, so even if a pixel is black it may still use some energy.
Human Writen
It’s not true for all types of screens. For LCD screens, energy cost is not definitely related to brightness. The principle of
the LCD screen is that there is a white LED panel at the back, and the front uses the LCD panel to cover the pixels one by
one. Turn down the backlight brightness to save power. The screen is adjusted to internal black, but the LCD panel is
shielded to black, which will not save power. The power saving has nothing to do with the background color.

Question
Why does it seem like when I watch something the second time around, it goes by faster than the first time I watched it?
WebGLM
It seems like when you watch something the second time around, it goes by faster than the first time you watched it
because you are focusing on the little details instead, which might make it feel like time is going by faster. Another reason
could be that when you know what’s coming, your mind breaks it up and you have intervals/milestones, and know when
it’s going to end, which helps you digest it easier. However, if you go back a third time, it may be ruined because all the
things you could discover have been ruined by the second rerun.
WebGPT-175B
There are several different ideas about why this happens. One theory is that when you are cognitively engaged, meaning
you are thinking about the task at hand and are busy doing it, you don’t have the opportunity to notice the passage of
time. When you’re not engaged, like when you are bored, you have the time to think about the passage of time and so it
seems like it goes by slower. Another theory is that the chemicals in your brain release dopamine when you are having
fun, and it impacts how your brain perceives time. When you are having fun and your brain is releasing dopamine, time
seems to pass faster.
WebGPT-13B
There are two main reasons time seems to pass faster the second time around. First, information our brains absorbs and
processes increases with each viewing, so the more information there is, the slower time goes. Second, as we age, the
rate at which we process visual information slows down, and this is what makes time ‘speed up’ as we grow older. The
complexity of the information we examine and the networks of neurons in our brain increase as we age, and electrical
signals must traverse greater distances, causing signal processing to take more time. This is what leads to time passing
more rapidly.
Perplexity AI
The phenomenon of time seeming to pass faster when watching something for a second time is likely due to the recency
effect, which amplifies the importance of recent stimuli or observations. Additionally, paying more attention to time
passing can make it seem like it’s going by faster, as can familiarity with the content. Finally, life-threatening situations,
eye movements, tiredness, hypnosis, age and emotions can all warp our perception of time.
Human Writen
When humans repeatedly look at the same thing, the brain will quickly recall the previous memory when it sees the same
content. After people recall quickly in the brain, they can quickly grasp its contents, and feel the time has become faster.

Question
Why is it that soap can wash almost anything off of your hands but doesn’t wash its fragrance off of you?
References
[1] Soap is able to clean hands and dishes because of some pretty nifty chemistry. Soap molecules have on one
end what’s known as a polar salt, which is hydrophilic, or attracted to water. The other end of the molecule
is a nonpolar chain of fatty acids or hydrocarbons, which is hydrophobic—meaning that it’s repelled by water
but attracted to grease and other oily substances. When you wash your hands, the soap forms something like a
molecular bridge between the water and the dirty, germ-laden oils on your hands, attaching to both the oils and
the water and lifting the grime off and away. Soaps can also link up with the fatty membranes on the outside of
bacteria and certain viruses, lifting the infectious agents off and even breaking them apart. Once the oily dirt
and germs are off your hands, the soap molecules thoroughly surround them and form tiny clusters, known as
micelles, that keep them from attaching to anything else while they wash down the drain.
[2] First, the hydrophilic ends of the soap molecule attach to the water, then the hydrophobic ends attach to the
oils, pathogens, or other debris on the hand. After the soap has bonded with the germs on your hand the water
can then wash it down the drain. This works because the soap molecule can attach to the germs more strongly
than the germs can hold onto your skin.
[3] Therefore, when you wash with soap and water the soap molecules grab on to the fat molecules and pulls
them off the skin into the rinse water. When your rinse the skin the fat and germs are removed from the skin.
Therefore, the main reason why soap works to cleanse and sanitise is it literally washes everything off the skin.
