ABSTRACT
Federal Reserve policy in the wake of the COVID pandemic has been widely 
criticized as responding too slowly to surging inflation and an overheated labor 
market, thereby exacerbating the inflation problem and impairing macroeconomic 
performance more generally. This paper challenges this view by exploring the 
likely effects of a markedly more restrictive counterfactual monetary policy 
starting in early 2021. Under this policy, the Federal Open Market Committee 
(FOMC) would have strictly followed the prescriptions of a benchmark policy 
rule with labor utilization gauged using the ratio of vacancies to unemployment, 
thereby causing the federal funds rate to rise faster and by much more than 
it actually did. In addition, consistent with the alternative rule-based strategy, 
the FOMC would have provided less accommodative forward guidance than 
what it implicitly provided over time, based on the post-COVID evolution of the 
economic projections made by FOMC participants and major financial institutions. 
Finally, the Fed would have ended its large-scale asset purchases earlier and 
begun shrinking its balance sheet sooner. Because of uncertainty about inflation 
dynamics, simulations of the effects of the counterfactual policy are run using 
different specifications of the Phillips curve drawn from recent studies, with 
each in turn embedded in a large-scale model of the US economy that provides 
a detailed treatment of the monetary transmission mechanism. Using a range of 
assumptions for expectations formation and the interest sensitivity of aggregate 
spending, the various model simulations suggest that a more restrictive strategy 
on the part of the FOMC would have done little to check inflation in 2021 and 
2022, although it probably would have sped its return to 2 percent thereafter. 
Because the modest reductions in inflation suggested by these simulations would 
have come at a cost of higher unemployment and lower real wages, the net social 
benefit of a more restrictive policy response on the part of the FOMC seems 
doubtful; the paper also questions the wisdom of a more rapid and pronounced 
tightening on risk-management grounds.

1. Introduction 
 
Federal Reserve monetary policy has been widely criticized in recent years. For example, 
reacting to guidance from the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC), the Fed’s policymaking 
group, that the federal funds rate was likely to remain near zero for some time to come despite 
the enactment of several major fiscal packages, Lawrence Summers warned in the spring of 2021 
that the FOMC had “underestimated the risks, very substantially, both to financial stability as 
well as to conventional inflation of protracted extremely low interest rates.”1 This early warning 
received widespread attention, as did his reaction later in the year to the Fed’s initially sanguine 
assessment of a string of elevated monthly price increases: “It’s past time for team ‘transitory’ to 
step down.”2 As the FOMC continued to hold the federal funds rate near zero into early 2022 
despite headline PCE inflation as measured by the personal consumption expenditures (PCE) 
index surging to around 7 percent, Summers was joined by a number of other prominent 
economists, including Jason Furman, Michael Bordo, Mickey Levy, John Taylor, and John 
Cochrane.3 In their view, the Fed was moving far too slowly and fueling what was becoming, or 
even in some eyes had already become, a chronic inflation problem. In the wider world, a 
headline in The Economist expressed what may have been a common view at the time: “The 
Federal Reserve has made a historic mistake on inflation.”4 
 
Against this criticism, one might defend the Fed’s delayed tightening by noting the difficulty of 
gauging in real time the persistence of the upward surprises to prices, the actual tightness of the 
labor market, and the prospects for future growth; in addition, a slow-to-tighten strategy could be 
seen as appropriate given the stimulative forward guidance provided by the FOMC in 2020 in 
order to mitigate the adverse consequences of the effective lower bound (ELB) on nominal 
interest rates.5 Certainly, most outside observers at the time shared the FOMC’s expectation that 
inflation was likely to fall back to 2 percent quickly without a need for a marked tightening in 
monetary policy. In June 2021, for example, after several months of elevated price increases and 
the recent passage of a yet another major fiscal package, major financial institutions and private 
forecasters, like the FOMC, anticipated that headline PCE inflation would run close to 2 percent 
in 2022 accompanied by only a modest tightening of monetary policy—an expectation that was

5 Federal Reserve Board governor Waller made these points in a speech given at the May 2022 Hoover Institution 
conference, www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/waller20220506a.htm. With regard to the FOMC’s slow-
to-tighten forward guidance, one difficulty with using this tool is that its effectiveness in future ELB episodes will 
be greatly impaired if policymakers come to be seen as likely to quickly jettison this guidance when conditions 
begin to improve.

largely unchanged at the end of the year.6 As for households, their expectations for inflation over 
the next five years were about the same in mid-2021 as they had been at the start of the year and 
by year’s end had still barely risen.7  
 
Fed policy changed course starting in the spring of 2022. In an effort to rein in inflation that had 
proved to be more persistent than expected, and in the face of what appeared to be quite tight 
labor conditions, the FOMC carried out an extended sequence of unusually large rate hikes that 
raised the federal funds rate by more than 500 basis points between the March 2022 and July 
2023 meetings. In the wake of this policy response, inflation has slowed markedly with 
unemployment remaining low, and as a result the FOMC’s post-COVID policy has come to be 
viewed more favorably. But there still seems to be a general belief that the Federal Reserve erred 
in not responding more proactively and thus allowed economic conditions to be worse than they 
might have been. For example, Eggertsson and Kohn (2023) argue that the Fed’s adoption of  
flexible average inflation targeting in August 2020 unwisely incorporated an inflationary bias 
into FOMC policymaking that inappropriately delayed tightening, although they do not provide 
any estimates of its actual consequences for inflation. 
 
But did the FOMC’s delayed response in fact materially contribute to inflation and more broadly 
impair macroeconomic performance? This paper finds that it probably did not. This conclusion is 
based on an analysis of how economic conditions would likely have evolved under a much 
tighter monetary policy. Under this counterfactual policy, the FOMC in early 2021 would have 
begun following the prescriptions of a benchmark policy rule that would have called for raising 
the federal funds rate appreciably earlier than the FOMC did, and over time by considerably 
more, in response to both the surge in inflation and evidence that the labor market was far more 
overheated than the unemployment rate alone suggested. Consistent with the alternative rule-
based strategy, the FOMC would also have simultaneously provided much less stimulative 
forward guidance about the likely future path of interest rates than it did. Finally, the proposed 
counterfactual strategy would have ended the Federal Reserve’s large-scale asset purchases 
earlier and begun normalizing the size of its balance sheet sooner.  
 
6 The medians of the Q4/Q4 headline PCE inflation projections submitted by the individual FOMC participants for 
the June 2021 meeting were 3.4 percent, 2.1 percent, and 2.2 percent for 2021, 2022, and 2023, respectively; see the 
Summary of Economic Projections, www.federalreserve.gov/monetarypolicy/fomcprojtabl20210616.htm.These 
FOMC forecasts were the same as the projections made in early June 2021 by the major financial institutions that act 
as counterparties to the Fed’s open-market operations; see the Federal Reserve Bank of New York Survey of 
Primary Dealers, www.newyorkfed.org/markets/primarydealer_survey_questions. Similarly, the median projections 
reported in the 2021 Q2 Survey of Professional Forecasters (SPF) (released in May) showed that this group 
expected Q4/Q4 PCE inflation to be 2¾ percent in 2021 but then to moderate to around 2.2 percent in both 2022 and 
2023; see www.philadelphiafed.org/surveys-and-data/real-time-data-research/survey-of-professional-forecasters. In 
all three cases, the median forecast for the level of short-term interest rates at the end of 2022 was only 0.13 percent, 
with the projected level at the end of 2023 ranging from 0.63 percent to 1.25 percent. By late 2021, FOMC 
participants, the primary dealers, and private forecasters all projected PCE inflation to moderate markedly in 2022 
from the elevated 2021 rate and to be close to 2 percent in 2023, with short-term interest rates projected to stand no 
higher than 1.3 percent at the end of 2023 and 2.1 percent in 2024. 
7 The median expectation for inflation over the next five years reported in the University of Michigan household 
survey was 2.7 percent in January 2021, 2.8 percent in June 2021, and 2.9 percent in December 2021. These figures 
are essentially the same as the median expectation reported on average from 2000 to 2019, prior to the onset of 
COVID. Note that the household inflation expectations reported in the Michigan survey tend to be noticeably higher 
than either the PCE or the consumer price index (CPI) measures of actual inflation. See 
data.sca.isr.umich.edu/tables.php.

Given this counterfactual policy, which probably would have been even more restrictive than 
critics would have advocated at the time, the paper then assesses its likely consequences for 
recent US inflation and real activity using model simulations. In light of considerable uncertainty 
about the forces that have actually driven inflation over time, this paper reports simulations 
carried out using four different specifications of the Phillips curve. One of these specifications is 
based on the wage and price equations of FRB/US, the Federal Reserve Board’s model of the US 
economy, while the other three are based on estimated wage and price equations reported in three 
recent papers—Bernanke and Blanchard (2023), Cecchetti and others (2023), and Gagnon and 
Collins (2019). These specifications differ in various ways, including the estimated response of 
wages and prices over time to movements in resource utilization—that is to say, in the slope of 
the Phillips curve. The flatter this slope, the more policymakers have to raise interest rates and 
boost unemployment to offset short-to-medium-run increases in inflation, all else equal. For the 
analysis in this paper, another important feature of these Phillips curve specifications is the 
estimated persistence of short-run movements in inflation, and the potential for them to become 
embedded in long-run inflation expectations over time, either explicitly or implicitly. The better 
anchored such expectations, the smaller the longer-run cost of the “easy” policy followed by the 
FOMC and thus the smaller the potential gain from the counterfactual policy. 
 
To run the simulations, each Phillips curve is in turn incorporated into the structure of the 
FRB/US model, which among other things includes a detailed treatment of how current and 
expected changes in monetary policy influence overall financial conditions, expectations for 
inflation and other factors, and aggregate demand and supply. As a robustness check, for all four 
model specifications a range of assumptions are used for expectations formation and the interest 
sensitivity of aggregate spending. A striking feature of these various simulations is that, across 
almost all the permutations of the Phillips curve and other simulation assumptions, the 
counterfactual monetary policy does little to check inflation in 2021 and reduces it by only a few 
tenths of a percentage point in 2022, although the simulations do show PCE inflation moving 
somewhat more quickly back to the FOMC’s 2 percent target in 2023 and 2024. Overall, these 
results suggest that the Phillips curve is too flat and long-run inflation expectations too well 
anchored for monetary policy to have been able to do much to prevent the inflation surge that 
occurred. Moreover, the simulations suggest that costs in reduced employment and household 
income would have been appreciable had the FOMC tried: The more restrictive policy would not 
only have pushed the economy back into recession, but relative to actual conditions it also would 
have likely resulted in lower real wages, not higher. 
 
One might question these simulation results on the grounds that the rule-based counterfactual 
policy is too gradual, or that inflation expectations might have responded by more than the model 
predicts, or that the simulations ignore the effect tighter monetary policy would have had on 
supply shocks. After considering these possibilities, the paper presents evidence that they were 
either unimportant or improbable. That said, uncertainty about the “true” monetary transmission 
mechanism is considerable, and another model might well yield a more substantial effect. For 
example, Gagliardone and Gertler (2023) use a dynamic stochastic general equilibrium (DSGE) 
model to estimate the economic effects of recent shocks to monetary policy and oil prices, and 
they find that “easy” monetary policy and accompanying forward guidance added about 1½ 
percentage points to inflation in both 2021 and 2022, in contrast to the small effects found using 
FRB/US.

Finally, a different caveat about the simulation results presented in this paper is that they ignore 
an important risk-management consideration. Even if the FOMC is indeed on track to the desired 
soft landing, with inflation apparently coming back to target without any significant increase in 
unemployment, its delay in tightening as inflation surged arguably risked inflation expectations 
becoming unanchored. If that had occurred, the persistent cost in diminished macroeconomic 
stability would have been considerable. Having said that, whether this was ever a serious risk 
and thus worth the assured cost of higher unemployment seems questionable given the slowness 
with which long-run inflation expectations have historically responded to persistent movements 
in actual inflation—something that has continued in recent years. Also, as noted above, risk 
management concerns related to the ELB constraint at least initially pointed in the direction of 
taking a cautious approach to tightening. That said, the FOMC certainly can never count on 
expectations remaining anchored no matter what it does, and for that reason it was correct to 
raise interest rates quickly over the course of 2022 and 2023 in response to elevated inflation and 
the strength of real activity.  
 
The structure of the paper is as follows. Section 2 presents the rationale for an alternative 
strategy under which the FOMC would have adjusted the federal funds rate in response to 
movements in real activity and inflation as prescribed by a modified version of a standard policy 
benchmark, the “balanced approach” rule. A key feature of the counterfactual rule is that it 
measures labor utilization using the ratio of vacancies to unemployment (V/U) instead of the 
unemployment rate, on the grounds that the latter appears to have markedly understated the 
actual tightness of the labor market in recent years. The paper then considers the other two 
components of recent FOMC monetary policy, forward guidance and quantitative easing (QE). 
Based on the evolution of economic projections made by FOMC participants and a group of 
major financial institutions since 2020, section 3 shows that since COVID hit, the FOMC has 
implicitly signaled that conditions would likely lead it to keep the federal funds rate well below 
the prescriptions of the counterfactual rule for an extended period—stimulative forward guidance 
that is eliminated under the counterfactual rule-based strategy. Section 4 completes the 
counterfactual strategy by specifying an alternative path for the Fed’s balance sheet and 
discussing the effects it likely would have had on term premiums. Section 5 reviews the main 
features of the different Phillips curve specifications and the rest of the FRB/US model, and then 
it presents simulation results for some simple shocks that illustrate the ways in which real 
activity and inflation respond to changes in the federal funds rate, forward guidance, and QE-
influenced term premiums in the model. Section 6 then uses the various permutations of model 
structure and simulation assumptions to assess how history might have evolved under the 
counterfactual strategy and considers some possible ways in which the model’s predictions could 
err. Finally, section 7 concludes with a discussion of what the net benefits of a more restrictive 
policy might have been and what risk-management considerations might have suggested. 
 
2. Counterfactual monetary policy based on the balanced approach rule 
 
Although monetary policy cannot be realistically reduced to following a simple rule, a useful 
way to assess the stance of monetary policy in the wake of COVID is to compare the actual path 
of the federal funds rate since early 2020 to that prescribed by a benchmark rule of the sort

highlighted by Taylor (1999) and later dubbed the “balanced approach” (BA) rule by Fed chair 
Yellen:8 
 
𝐼𝐼𝑡𝑡= 𝜌𝜌𝐼𝐼𝑡𝑡−1 + (1 −𝜌𝜌)[𝑅𝑅∗+ 𝜋𝜋𝑡𝑡+ 0.5(𝜋𝜋𝑡𝑡−𝜋𝜋∗) −2.0(𝑈𝑈𝑡𝑡−𝑈𝑈∗)] 
 
In this expression, 𝐼𝐼𝑡𝑡 is the rule’s prescription for the end-of-quarter value of the federal funds 
rate, 𝜋𝜋𝑡𝑡 is the 4-quarter rate of core PCE inflation, 𝑈𝑈𝑡𝑡 is the quarterly average value of the 
unemployment rate, 𝜋𝜋∗ denotes the FOMC’s announced inflation target (equal to 2 percent), and 
𝑅𝑅∗and 𝑈𝑈∗ are the values of the real federal funds rate and the unemployment rate estimated to be 
consistent with full employment and price stability in the longer run. The parameter 𝜌𝜌 determines 
the degree to which policymakers respond gradually to movements in real activity and inflation.9 
 
In analyses of expected macroeconomic performance under different policy rules in a stochastic 
environment—such as Bernanke, Kiley, and Roberts (2019); Chung and others (2019); and 
Bernanke (2020)—the BA rule is found (in the context of stochastic model simulations) to do a 
reasonably good job in helping to stabilize the economy under a range of conditions, including 
situations in which the ELB frequently binds. That said, the same studies suggest that other, 
more complicated rules may potentially do better, so no claim is made here that this benchmark 
rule is the “best” of the many different policy rules that have been proposed over time. However, 
the BA rule, particularly when policymakers are assumed to respond gradually to changes in real 
activity and inflation (𝜌𝜌> 0), has the advantage of mimicking the FOMC’s behavior in the two 
decades or so prior to the first ELB episode.10 As discussed by English, Nelson, and Sack (2003) 
and Bernanke (2004), such gradualist behavior reflects policymakers’ legitimate concerns about 
the reliability of initial readings on economic conditions and other types of uncertainty, aversion 
to overreacting to transitory shocks, and the potential for abrupt interest rate movements to 
generate financial instability.11 Thus, financial market participants and others would likely have

Reserve about the uses and limitations of policy rules in informing monetary policy decisions, see

www.federalreserve.gov/monetarypolicy/challenges-associated-with-using-rules-to-make-monetary-policy.htm. 
Also, see the discussion of rules in Taylor and Williams (2011). The Federal Reserve regularly reports the 
prescriptions of the balanced approach rule (along with others) in its semiannual Monetary Policy Report. 
9 The BA rule differs from the original Taylor (1993) rule by being twice as responsive to resource utilization 
(adjusting for lags when 𝜌𝜌> 0) and by responding to core rather than headline inflation. In this specification, the 
unemployment gap (multiplied by -2.0, the approximate value of the Okun’s Law coefficient) is used in place of the 
more difficult to estimate output gap. 
10 Using quarterly data from 1991Q1 to 2008Q3, the FOMC’s implicit pre-ELB reaction function is estimated to 
equal 𝐼𝐼𝑡𝑡= .64𝐼𝐼𝑡𝑡−1 + .36[15.55 −.068𝑇𝑇𝑇𝑇
𝑡𝑡+ 1.53𝜋𝜋𝑡𝑡−2.27𝑈𝑈𝑡𝑡 ], where a linear time trend, 𝑇𝑇𝑇𝑇
𝑡𝑡, is included in the 
regression to control for changes over time in the equilibrium real interest rate, the FOMC’s implicit inflation target, 
and the natural rate of unemployment. Based on a log-likelihood ratio test, the long-run responses to inflation and 
unemployment in the estimated reaction function are insignificantly different from their values in the balanced 
approach rule, 1.5 and -2.0. Note that estimating a reaction function using data from 2008Q4 on would yield 
downwardly biased estimates of the desired response of the FOMC to movements in unemployment and inflation 
because the ELB has periodically constrained downward movements in the federal funds rate since December 2008.

viewed a counterfactual strategy based on a gradualist version of this benchmark rule as one that 
was aligned with both past practice and good policy outcomes and thus credible. 
 
Figure 1 compares the actual path of the federal funds rate through late 2023, extended through 
late 2025 using the FOMC’s latest projections, to the paths prescribed by the unconstrained BA 
rule using two different settings for 𝜌𝜌, zero and 0.85. For the latter setting, results are also shown 
when the ELB is imposed.12 The rule-based paths are computed conditional on actual and 
projected real activity and inflation, with 𝑅𝑅∗ and 𝑈𝑈∗ set to 0.5 percent and 4.1 percent, 
respectively.13 Unconstrained, the nongradualist version of the BA rule would have called for 
pushing the federal funds rate far below zero in 2020 and keeping below zero through early 2021 
in response to high unemployment, but as the unemployment rate fell and inflation surged, the 
same version would have called for a much more rapid and marked degree of tightening than 
what the FOMC did. With 𝜌𝜌= 0.85, however, the unconstrained rule would have instead 
prescribed a path of the federal funds rate similar to the actual path, albeit still with a noticeable 
excursion below zero for a time. Finally, the gradualist version of the BA rule with the ELB 
imposed yields an intermediate case in which tightening would have begun in 2021Q2 and 
tightened at a relatively moderate pace thereafter, with the result that the federal funds rate would 
have been on average ¾ percentage points higher than its actual/projected path from early 2021 
to late 2025.  
 
This figure would seem to suggest that the average stance of FOMC policy since early 2021 has 
been moderately but not dramatically easy, ignoring any additional stimulus that may have been 
provided through forward guidance and quantitative easing. But that interpretation overlooks an 
important issue confronting the Federal Reserve in recent years, the measurement of labor 
utilization. In the years prior to 2020, the unemployment rate was closely correlated with a 
variety of labor market indicators, suggesting that policymakers could safely focus on it when 
assessing how far the economy was from the level of full employment consistent with long-run 
price stability. Figure 2 illustrates these historical close correlations using the quits rate, the job 
openings rate, the prime-age employment-to-population ratio, a composite index of the level of 
labor market activity published by the Federal Reserve Bank of Kansas City, and the V/U ratio; 
note that the numerator of V/U equals the number of job openings.14 In the figure, the five 
alternative indicators have been rescaled to be comparable to the unemployment rate and, like 
the unemployment rate, are expressed as utilization rates by subtracting 4.1 percent.15 As the 
 
12 The ELB is assumed to equal 12.5 basis points, the midpoint of the lowest target range for the federal funds rate 
used by the Federal Reserve to date, zero to 25 basis points. In principle, the FOMC could have opted for a 
somewhat lower range given that the European Central Bank and some other central banks have at times set their 
policy rates as much as 50 basis points below zero. 
13 The projected 2024-25 values of the federal funds rate, real activity, and inflation are based on the medians of the 
medium-term forecasts submitted by FOMC participants for the December 2023 FOMC meeting and reported in the 
Summary of Economic Projections, www.federalreserve.gov/monetarypolicy/fomcprojtabl20231213.htm, while the 
assumed values of R* and U* equal the median values of their longer-run projections. For the inertial specification 
of the rule, the lagged federal funds rate term equals the dynamically computed value generated by the rule starting 
in 2019Q2, not its actual value. 
14 The composite index is the first principal component of 24 different monthly labor series. See 
www.kansascityfed.org/data-and-trends/labor-market-conditions-indicators/ for further details. 
15 Specifically, each alternative labor market indicator X is rescaled as c1 + c2 * T + c3 * X, where T is a linear time 
trend and c1, c2, and c3 are the coefficients obtained by regressing the unemployment rate on T and X using data 
from 2001Q1 to 2019Q4.

figure shows, all the rescaled alternatives closely tracked the unemployment rate from 2001 to 
2019. But since COVID hit, several of them have diverged markedly from the unemployment 
rate, implying that the initial contraction was less deep and the subsequent swing to tight 
conditions was more pronounced, although the magnitude of the divergence has declined 
appreciably in recent quarters.  
 
Figure 3 illustrates the implications of the post-COVID divergence in these various indicators for 
the prescriptions of the gradualist version of the BA rule subject to the ELB constraint, computed 
conditional on the actual and projected path of core PCE inflation and on the paths of the various 
measures of labor conditions.16 Gauging labor utilization using the rescaled prime-age 
employment-to-population ratio yields a prescribed path similar to the one generated using the 
unemployment rate through late 2022, while a path based on the broad-based labor conditions 
index runs consistently somewhat higher over the entire 2020-25 period. Prescribed paths 
computed using the other three indicators are much more restrictive. On average, the path 
constructed using V/U is 3 percentage points higher than the actual path from 2020 to 2023, 
while the path constructed with the job openings rate is 6½ percentage points higher. Although 
these various calculations make no allowance for the weaker economic conditions that would 
have prevailed under a tighter policy and which would have moderated the BA rule’s 
prescriptions to some extent, the various paths do suggest that actual FOMC policy has probably 
been and continues to be comparatively quite easy relative to what a “normal” rule-based 
strategy would have called for. 
 
With the information available at the time, should the FOMC have placed more weight on these 
alternative indicators of labor utilization and so have tightened earlier and more aggressively? 
Probably, although saying so begs the question of when policymakers should have been expected 
to recognize that the unemployment rate was no longer an adequate guide to the actual tightness 
of the labor market. Certainly 2020 would have been too early: Abandoning years of experience 
on the basis of two or three quarters of data would have been hard to justify, particularly at a 
time when determining the persistence of the discordant signals from different labor market 
indicators would have been extremely difficult. More importantly, the fact that uncertainty about 
“true” labor utilization was unusually high immediately after the pandemic started was, to a large 
degree, irrelevant at the time from a risk-management perspective. In light of plunging 
employment, highly stressed financial markets, and massive uncertainty about the prospects for 
recovery—particularly given the asymmetric risks created by the ELB constraint on nominal 
interest rates and the unknown magnitude of the fiscal actions that would eventually be taken—it 
was clearly appropriate in the spring of 2020 for the FOMC to lower the federal funds rate to the 
ELB and hold it there until the situation became clearer.  
 
Conditions changed appreciably in 2021. Financial markets by then were under much less stress, 
monthly readings on prices came in surprisingly strong over the course of the year, and a wide 
range of indicators increasingly suggested that the labor market was not only recovering rapidly 
but was even overheating. With regard to the FOMC’s recognition of the last development, the 
 
16 Because the FOMC does not report forecasts for the alternative labor indicators, illustrative projections for these 
series are constructed by assuming that FOMC participants would have expected the wedge between the 
unemployment rate and each alternative rescaled indicator to continue to fade away in 2024 and 2025 at a rate of 15 
percent per quarter.

minutes from the June 2021 meeting note that “many participants pointed to the elevated number 
of job openings and high rates of job switching as further evidence of the improvement in labor 
market conditions.”17 By the September meeting, this concern had escalated: “Private-sector job 
openings, as measured by the Job Openings and Labor Turnover Survey, increased further in 
July and continued to suggest that labor demand was extraordinarily high”18 (italics added). 
Given this evidence, and the fact that the unemployment rate was still 5.9 percent in June 2021, 
far above the FOMC’s estimate of its longer-run sustainable level (then 4 percent), one can argue 
that around this time policymakers should have gauged the appropriate stance of monetary policy 
using some alternative to the unemployment rate to measure resource utilization.19 Moreover, the 
risk-management case for systematically deviating from the prescriptions of a benchmark rule in 
a lower-for-longer direction weakened substantially over the course of 2021 as it became 
increasingly clear that a robust economic recovery was solidly under way. Nevertheless, the 
FOMC would have faced considerable communication challenges initially if it had begun 
tightening in response to one or more of the alternative labor market indicators, as it was only 
later in the year that they suggested monetary policy was markedly easy. 
 
If the FOMC had decided to focus on an alternative measure of labor utilization, which one 
should it have chosen? Although the labor conditions index has some appeal because it attempts 
to summarize the signal from a wide range of indicators, a stronger candidate to replace the 
unemployment rate might have been the ratio of vacancies to unemployment. In an Economics 
Letter published by the Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco in October 2021, Barnichon, 
Oliveira, and Shapiro (2021) argued that the V/U measure performed better empirically than the 
unemployment rate as a predictor of both contemporaneous and past wage and price pressures. 
These Fed staffers also stressed that from a theoretical standpoint the ratio was a better measure 
of labor utilization because it reflects both demand and supply factors, something that became 
particularly important post-COVID because of shifts in the Beveridge curve and other signs of 
impairments to the normal functioning of the labor market. What FOMC participants made of 
this argument at the time is as yet unknown, but certainly it is now common for many economists 
to treat V/U as the preferred measure of labor utilization to use in studies of both recent and past 
inflation developments; see, for example, Bernanke and Blanchard (2023); Barnichon and 
Shapiro (2022); Ball, Leigh, and Mishra (2022); and Cecchetti and others (2023). Accordingly, 
the counterfactual monetary policy used in the model simulations discussed below is one that 
 
17 See www.federalreserve.gov/monetarypolicy/fomcminutes20210616.htm. The June 2021 FOMC minutes also 
show, however, that participants still placed great weight on the unemployment rate and other traditional indicators: 
“Many participants remarked, however, that the economy was still far from achieving the Committee's broad-based 
and inclusive maximum-employment goal, and some participants indicated that recent job gains, while strong, were 
weaker than they had expected.” 
18 See www.federalreserve.gov/monetarypolicy/fomcminutes20210922.htm. 
19 Of course, utilization measurement issues extend beyond the labor market. Since COVID hit, disruptions to global 
supply chains as well as shocks to food and energy prices arising from the Russian invasion of Ukraine, avian flu, 
and other factors have hit a variety of product markets, making it difficult to judge the balance between aggregate 
demand and supply. Nevertheless, to the extent FOMC participants focused on the labor market in assessing 
aggregate resource utilization, and thereby implicitly looked through nonlabor supply-side disruptions to product 
markets by treating them as transitory shocks, they were probably wise. With time, these shocks have faded 
appreciably and do not appear to have had permanent macroeconomic effects by, for example, altering long-run 
inflation expectations or trend productivity. Moreover, tighter monetary policy would likely have done little to 
directly reduce the shocks to food, energy, and supply chains, barring draconian actions that would have prevented 
the US economy from recovering and, for example, reducing global oil consumption and so damping energy prices.

strictly follows the prescriptions of the ELB-constrained BA rule beginning in early 2021, with 
labor utilization gauged using the rescaled V/U measure (from here on denoted as ZVU) 
expressed as a difference from the estimated value of the sustainable rate of unemployment, 
U*.20  
 
3. Forward guidance and financial market expectations 
 
If the FOMC had announced in early 2021 that going forward it intended to strictly follow the 
prescriptions of the BA rule with labor utilization gauged using ZVU-U*, its guidance about the 
likely future path of the federal funds rate would presumably have changed to be consistent with 
the counterfactual strategy. If deemed credible, that change in forward guidance would in turn 
have altered the expectations of presumably well-informed financial market participants about 
future economic conditions, resulting in contractionary shifts in longer-term interest rates, 
corporate equity prices, and other financial factors, thereby damping real activity and thus 
inflation. (Less realistically, the change in forward guidance might also have altered the 
expectations of households and other less well-informed agents as well, causing further changes 
in aggregate spending and inflation.) This section reviews the coevolution since 2020 of the 
economic projections made both by the FOMC and by major financial institutions, with the 
objective of measuring changes over time in each group’s implicit expectations for the degree to 
which future monetary policy would deviate from the prescriptions of the counterfactual BA 
rule—expected deviations that would presumably have disappeared once the counterfactual 
strategy was announced. This analysis shows that at each forecast date the two groups always 
had similar expectations for these implicit deviations from the rule, and as time passed the 
expected future deviations became quite large and persistent. As a result, the forward guidance 
the FOMC actually provided over time was implicitly much more accommodative than what it 
presumably would have provided under the more restrictive counterfactual policy.  
 
For the March, June, September, and December meetings of the FOMC, the 7 members of the 
Federal Reserve Board and the 12 regional Reserve Bank presidents each submit their individual 
projections for economic activity over the medium term and in the longer run, conditioned on 
their individual assessment of appropriate monetary policy. Summary information about these 
forecasts is released at the press conference immediately following these meetings and later 
reported in the Summary of Economic Projections (SEP). The dashed lines of figures 4, 5, and 6 
illustrate how the medians of participants’ individual medium-term forecasts for core PCE 
inflation, the unemployment rate, and the federal funds rate, respectively, have evolved at 
selected dates since June 2020. To see how the evolving expectations of policymakers compared 
to the views of financial market participants, the figures also report the corresponding forecasts 
 
20 The assumption that the long-run sustainable value of ZVU is equal to U* is consistent with the results plotted in 
figure 2: The remarkable similarity of the movements in the unemployment rate and the rescaled indicators pre-
COVID indicates that they all must have had more or less the same long-run value prior to 2020, while the ongoing 
realignment of the indicators seen recently suggests that this is still true post-COVID. Of course, one cannot rule out 
the possibility that the equilibrium value of ZVU may have shifted after COVID hit given that such a shift would be 
almost impossible to estimate with any precision within such a short sample period; if so, the ZVU-U* measure may 
overstate or understate the actual inflationary pressure recently coming from the labor market. That said, the results 
reported by both Bernanke and Blanchard and Cecchetti and others show that one can account for recent movements 
in inflation using a Phillips curve in which labor utilization is measured using V/U rather than the unemployment 
rate, with the long-run sustainable level of the former implicitly or explicitly assumed to be unchanged post-COVID.

made by the primary dealers, the large financial institutions who serve as the trading 
counterparties to the Federal Reserve’s open-market operations. Specifically, the solid lines 
show the medians of the projections made by these institutions roughly a week or so before the 
same four FOMC meetings and subsequently reported in the New York Fed’s Survey of Primary 
Dealers (SPD) when the FOMC minutes are released.21 The SPD projections likely have no 
direct effect on the FOMC’s projections because committee participants, who submit their 
individual projections prior to each meeting and generally do not modify them before they are 
summarized at the postmeeting press conference, are first briefed on the SPD results at the 
meeting. 
 
The three figures show that FOMC participants and the primary dealers have consistently had 
quite similar views about the evolving outlook since COVID hit.22 In many respects, this 
similarity is not all that surprising: As Reifschneider and Tulip (2015) document, the forecast 
errors made by the FOMC in recent decades have been about the same as those made by other 
forecasters, presumably because everyone has access to essentially the same set of information. 
Nevertheless, the similarity is particularly striking in the case of core PCE inflation, where for 
each forecast date the inflation paths projected by the two groups differ by at most a tenth or two 
(figure 4). With regard to changes in the projected inflation paths over time, neither group 
anticipated the 2021-22 surge, and both were slow to recognize how high it would go until past 
the actual peak. In addition, both groups always expected core PCE inflation (as well as headline 
PCE inflation, not shown) to fall back to around 2 percent within two or three years. As for the 
unemployment rate, both groups initially underestimated the speed at which the labor market 
would recover, and later, after inflation surged, both came to anticipate that the unemployment 
rate would likely overshoot its longer-run level for a time before gradually converging to around 
4 percent in the longer run (figure 5). Finally, both the FOMC and the primary dealers projected 
in late 2020 that the federal funds rate would likely remain near zero through late 2023, the last 
year of the medium-term forecast period for that release (figure 6). Then, with inflation surging 
and labor market conditions becoming increasingly robust, both shifted for a time to forecasting 
a steady rise in the federal funds rate for several years and later shifted again to projecting that 
the federal funds rate would overshoot its longer-run level for several years.23 
 
21 There are currently 24 primary dealers, although not all of them necessarily answer all the survey questions. One 
question with the use of this survey is the degree to which the reported projections are representative of the views of 
market participants overall; unfortunately, the answer is unknowable owing to a lack of data. That said, the Federal 
Reserve Bank of New York also regularly conducts a survey of roughly 30 other major financial market participants, 
and the federal funds rate projections reported there are quite similar to those reported in the primary dealers survey. 
Because the latter Survey of Market Participants provides less detail on other aspects of the expected economic 
outlook, however, it is not used for this study.  
22 In the case of the FOMC, the plotted values in the first three quarters of each year are linear interpolations of the 
end-of-year projections reported in the Summary of Economic Projections. As a result, the trajectories of these 
plotted paths are probably smoother than what FOMC participants actually anticipated, particularly in the case of the 
federal funds rate. The same is true for the plotted projections of inflation and the unemployment rate for the 
primary dealers. The plotted SPD projections for the federal funds rate, however, are much less affected by such 
smoothing because the Survey of Primary Dealers reports median expectations for the federal funds rate on a 
meeting-by-meeting basis or end-of-quarter basis for the first two or three years of the projection period. As a result, 
the plotted SPD projections are affected by interpolation only for years well into the future. 
23 With regard to long-run inflation expectations, from 2020 on both the FOMC participants and the primary dealers 
always projected it to equal 2 percent. For the unemployment rate, the median of its projected longer-run value 
reported in releases of the SEP equaled 4.1 percent from June through December 2020 and 4 percent thereafter until 
December 2023, when it ticked up again to 4.1 percent. Similarly, the median estimate of the long-run 


Page | 11  
 
 
Each group’s forecasts for real activity, inflation, and the federal funds rate can be used to infer 
its implicit expectations for the degree to which future monetary policy would deviate from the 
prescriptions of the BA rule. To do that for the version of the BA rule used in this study, 
however, requires projections of V/U, which unfortunately neither the FOMC nor the primary 
dealers provide. But without going too far out on a limb, one can make a reasonable guess about 
what their expectations for this labor indicator would have looked like. To do this, let us assume 
that forecasters at time t would have projected the rescaled ratio j quarters ahead, 𝑍𝑍𝑍𝑍𝑍𝑍
෣𝑡𝑡,𝑗𝑗, using 
the rule of thumb 
 
𝑍𝑍𝑍𝑍𝑍𝑍
෣𝑡𝑡,𝑗𝑗= 𝑈𝑈
෡𝑡𝑡,𝑗𝑗+ 𝜔𝜔
ෝ𝑡𝑡,𝑗𝑗,  𝜔𝜔
ෝ𝑡𝑡,0 = 𝜔𝜔𝑡𝑡 and 𝜔𝜔
ෝ𝑡𝑡,𝑗𝑗= 𝜌𝜌𝜔𝜔
ෝ𝑡𝑡,𝑗𝑗−1 for j>0 . 
 
In this expression, 𝑈𝑈
෡𝑡𝑡,𝑗𝑗 is the forecaster’s expectation at time t for the unemployment rate j 
quarters ahead, and 𝜔𝜔
ෝ𝑡𝑡,𝑗𝑗 is the expected path of the difference between the rescaled ratio of 
vacancies to unemployment and the unemployment rate. At each forecast date, the wedge 𝜔𝜔
ෝ𝑡𝑡,𝑗𝑗 is 
initially assumed to equal its last observed actual value, 𝜔𝜔𝑡𝑡. Thereafter, 𝜔𝜔
ෝ𝑡𝑡,𝑗𝑗 declines 
geometrically at quarterly rate 𝜌𝜌, implying that in the long run 𝑍𝑍𝑍𝑍𝑍𝑍
෣𝑡𝑡,𝑗𝑗 converges to 𝑈𝑈
෡𝑡𝑡,𝑗𝑗. Using 
this method with 𝜌𝜌= 0.9, figure 7 shows what the forecasts of ZVU would have looked like.24 
 
Using these projections of real activity, core inflation, and the federal funds rate, figure 8 shows 
the future paths of the deviations from the BA rule implicitly expected by FOMC participants 
and the primary dealers at different points in time. This exercise is not particularly informative 
for forecasts made in 2020 because FOMC participants and the primary dealers at the time both 
expected, and the rule called for, the federal funds rate to be stuck at the ELB well into the 
future. From 2021 on, however, both groups implicitly anticipated that the federal funds rate 
would run persistently well below the prescriptions of the rule for two or three years before 
gradually returning to a more neutral stance. Moreover, by this metric both the FOMC and the 
primary dealers have always been in fairly close agreement since COVID hit about the extent to 
which future policy would be comparatively easy. 
 
unemployment rate reported in the SPD equaled 4.3 percent in June 2020 and 4 percent in all subsequent releases 
except in September 2023, when it briefly ticked up to 4.05 percent. Since COVID hit, the medians of FOMC 
participants’ expectations for the longer-run level of the federal funds rate have always equaled 2½ percent, 
implying a constant estimate of R* equal to 50 basis points. Over the same period, the corresponding medians 
reported in the SPD varied a bit but always stayed within a relatively narrow range of 2¼-2¾ percent, so that their 
estimates of R* have always been between 25 and 75 basis points. 
24 The fading-away property of the hypothetical ZVU projections is consistent with the economic projections made 
by the FOMC and the primary dealers, as they always showed inflation, real activity, and interest rates stabilizing in 
the longer run, thereby implying that they always anticipated that the initial post-COVID disruptions to labor market 
functioning would dissipate over time. Accordingly, these forecasters do not appear to have shared the pessimistic 
view of Blanchard, Domash, and Summers (2022) that the Beveridge curve was unlikely to revert to the pre-COVID 
relationship over the foreseeable future but instead implicitly agreed with the more optimistic view expressed by 
Figura and Waller (2022). Of course, forecasters’ real-time expectations for the speed at which the wedge between 
ZVU and U would dissipate are unknowable, and so setting 𝜌𝜌= 0.9 is somewhat arbitrary. Calibrating this 
parameter to the actual average rate of decline in the wedge between its peak in early 2022 and its current value 
would have yielded a lower value, 0.84, thereby causing the constructed expected future deviations from the BA rule 
to be less persistent than shown in figure 8. But it seems unlikely that forecasters would have anticipated labor 
market functioning to recover as fast as it has, particularly early on when the wedge was rising.

If the FOMC had announced in early 2021 that it intended to follow the counterfactual policy 
described in the prior section, how might the forward guidance implicitly provided by FOMC 
participants’ forecasts have changed? Presumably, the median SEP forecasts for real activity, 
inflation, and interest rates in this counterfactual world would no longer imply any future 
deviations from the rule. And in that case, how might the expectations of the primary dealers and 
others in the financial markets have responded? In the base-case simulations reported below, 
financial market participants are assumed to be both well-informed about the economic 
implications of changes in monetary policy and to regard the change in the FOMC’s forward 
guidance as completely credible. (In other simulations, households and other agents are, less 
realistically, also assumed to be similarly well-informed.) As a result, the anticipated future 
deviations from the rule implicit in the baseline expectations of well-informed agents disappear 
in the simulations of the counterfactual strategy. This assumption does not mean, however, that 
well-informed agents have perfect foresight about how economic conditions will unfold in the 
future. Instead, their expectations at each point in time for the future paths of the federal funds 
rate, inflation, and real activity in the simulations are based only on the shocks to real activity 
and inflation that had already manifested themselves in their real-time projections, not on the 
unanticipated shocks that had yet to occur. 
 
The perfect credibility assumption used in the simulation analysis raises the question of how 
even sophisticated financial market participants might have initially greeted an announcement in 
early 2021 that the unemployment rate would no longer be used to gauge labor utilization. 
Certainly, the communication challenges for the FOMC would have been considerable given 
both the historical centrality of the unemployment rate in public discussions and a general lack of 
public familiarity with V/U at the time. Under the circumstances, the announcement of the 
counterfactual rule-based strategy might not have been initially viewed as completely credible 
until the FOMC had demonstrated its commitment through concrete actions, particularly as the 
motivation for focusing on V/U instead of the unemployment rate probably would not have been 
clear until later in 2021. If so, then the simulation results reported below will tend to overstate 
the economic consequences of the more restrictive counterfactual strategy to some degree. 
 
4. Quantitative easing and term premium effects 
 
The third and last policy tool used by the FOMC in the wake of COVID was large-scale 
purchases of Treasury securities and agency mortgage-backed securities (MBSs).25  This section 
begins by reviewing the quantitative easing actions that the Federal Reserve took after COVID 
hit and the evolving objectives of those actions. It then proposes an alternative path for the 
Federal Reserve’s asset holdings to accompany the adoption of the more restrictive rule-based 
strategy and the accompanying adjustment to forward guidance outlined above. Under the 
counterfactual QE policy, the FOMC would have announced in early 2021 that it intended to 
 
25 Agency MBSs are issued by the Government National Mortgage Association (Ginnie Mae), the Federal National 
Mortgage Association (Fannie Mae), and the Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corporation (Freddie Mac). Ginnie Mae 
obligations are officially backed by the full faith and credit of the US government, and Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac 
obligations have effectively enjoyed this status since 2008, when both agencies were placed in conservatorship by 
the US government. Agency MBSs are therefore similar to Treasury securities with respect to default risk given the 
agencies’ pledge to buy back any loans in the underlying pools that default.

quickly suspend asset purchases and cease the reinvestment of principal and earnings on its 
holdings, thereby causing the size of the Fed’s balance sheet to peak at a much lower level and 
then return it to a more normal ratio to nominal GDP earlier than currently anticipated under the 
FOMC’s actual policy. The section concludes with a discussion of the likely effect of the 
counterfactual QE policy on term premiums, the channel through which asset purchases 
influence financial conditions, real activity, and inflation in the macro model simulations.  
 
To begin, in mid-March 2020 the FOMC announced that, in conjunction with cutting the federal 
funds rate to near zero, it would increase its holdings of Treasury securities by at least $500 
billion, increase its holdings of agency MBSs by at least $200 billion, and reinvest all principal 
payments on its holdings in these securities. Subsequent meeting statements through November 
2020 advised that purchases would continue at a rapid pace, with the result that the overall size 
of the Federal Reserve’s balance sheet exploded from $4.2 trillion in February to $7.3 trillion by 
the end of the year. Thereafter purchases continued at a more moderate pace through April 2022, 
at which point the Federal Reserve stopped its large-scale asset purchase program altogether and 
ended its policy of reinvesting principal repayments, thereby allowing its portfolio to shrink 
passively. All told, the size of the Federal Reserve’s balance sheet rose from less than 20 percent 
of nominal GDP pre-COVID to over 35 percent in early 2022; holdings have since declined to 
around 28 percent of GDP, and in December 2023 the primary dealers projected that they will 
fall below 23 percent by late 2025 (blue line of figure 9).  
 
The Fed’s large-scale asset purchases had two objectives. The first was to ease the widespread 
financial market stress that developed in the spring of 2020, when even the normally smooth 
functioning of the huge Treasury market was temporarily impaired. As financial market stress 
declined appreciably over the course of 2020, the main objective shifted to providing additional 
economic support in an environment in which the federal funds rate was expected to remain 
stuck at the ELB for some time to come. By purchasing longer-term Treasury securities and 
MBSs in volume, with those purchases funded by expanding the amount of short-term 
commercial bank reserves held at the Federal Reserve, the Federal Reserve would reduce the 
stock of long-duration, high-quality, interest-bearing securities available for investors to hold. In 
principle, that reduction would cause term premiums for these and other assets to fall, all else 
equal, thereby pushing down long-term interest rates even while short-term interest rates were 
trapped at the ELB. Lower bond yields in turn would help to support aggregate spending by 
reducing loan rates to businesses and households, supporting equity valuations, and putting 
downward pressure on the real exchange rate.26  
 
What alternative path for the Fed’s balance sheet might have been consistent with the FOMC 
announcing in early 2021 that the federal funds rate would from then on strictly follow the BA 
rule with labor utilization gauged by V/U? The answer is unclear because there is no generally 
accepted benchmark rule for how to adjust the size of the Federal Reserve’s asset holdings in 
response to changing economic conditions.27 The lack of a benchmark reflects in large part 
 
26See Kuttner (2018) for a general overview of these and other possible effects of large-scale asset purchases.  
27 This not to say that no rules have been proposed; see Gagnon and Sack (2018) for an example. Also, Kiley (2018), 
Chung and others (2019), and Bernanke (2020) have used stochastic simulations of the FRB/US model to explore 
the consequences of employing illustrative simple rules for adjusting the size of the Fed’s balance sheet in response 
to changes in economic conditions in environments in which the ELB periodically binds. 


Page | 14  
 
considerable uncertainty about the quantitative effects of asset purchases on financial conditions, 
real activity, and inflation; as Kuttner (2018) and Kim, Laubach, and Wei (2020) document, the 
range of estimates is wide. Another complicating factor is that, once free of the ELB, 
adjustments in the level of the federal funds rate can substitute for adjustments in the size of the 
FOMC’s balance sheet, making the “optimal” setting of each tool dependent on the other; see 
Crawley and others (2022). 
 
For these reasons, the paper takes the simple approach of defining the QE portion of the 
counterfactual monetary policy as a fixed alternative path for the Fed’s asset holdings, expressed 
as a percentage of GDP (red line of figure 9). In 2020 the counterfactual QE policy is the same as 
the one the FOMC actually implemented: With the federal funds rate at the ELB, widespread 
financial market stress, extremely weak labor market conditions, and highly uncertain prospects 
for economic recovery, a massive expansion of the balance sheet was appropriate at the time. A 
different situation arguably prevailed starting in 2021, however, with financial markets operating 
normally, the labor market recovering more quickly than had been anticipated, and inflation 
unexpectedly surging. Under those circumstances, it seems reasonable to assume that the FOMC 
would have paired an announcement of the counterfactual rule-based interest rate strategy with 
more restrictive guidance about the future path of its asset holdings. Specifically, under the 
counterfactual QE policy, the FOMC would have announced at the beginning of 2021 that it is 
ending its purchase program and will no longer reinvest principal and interest payments, thereby 
putting its holdings of Treasury securities and agency MBSs as a percent of GDP on a steady 
downward path that would have tracked well below the actual one. For convenience, this 
alternative “autopilot” path is assumed to be independent of movements in the federal funds rate 
or other changes in economic conditions. 
 
What effect might this counterfactual QE strategy have had on term premiums, the primary 
channel through which asset purchases influence economic activity in the model simulations 
reported below?28 Crawley and others (2022) report results that can be used to answer this 
question. Among other things, they estimate how alternative scenarios for the evolution of the 
Fed’s balance sheet from 2022 to 2027 would shift the projected path of term premiums. To do 
this, they use the arbitrage-free term structure model developed by Li and Wei (2013), which has 
the feature that term premiums today depend in part on the expected future path of the duration-
adjusted stock of Treasury securities and agency MBSs held by the public, expressed as a ratio to 
nominal GDP. Although none of their balance sheet scenarios correspond exactly to the 
counterfactual policy proposed here, their results suggest that the 10-year Treasury term 
premium would have jumped about 35 basis points in early 2021 relative to baseline in response 
to the FOMC’s announcement of the counterfactual QE policy, based on the average difference 
from 2021 to 2025 between the counterfactual path and the actual and SPD-projected path of 
asset holdings.29 Thereafter, the initial 10-year term premium effect relative to baseline would 
 
28 In the versions of the FRB/US model used in the simulation analysis, asset purchases can also influence economic 
activity by reducing the risk and liquidity premiums embedded in mortgage rates and other assets. These additional 
QE channels are assumed not to be at work in the model simulations, however, because financial markets had more 
or less resumed normal functioning by early 2021. 
29 This estimate is based on the following back-of-the-envelope calculation. Crawley and others (2022) present term 
premium estimates for three balance sheet scenarios—a baseline path, a no-runoff path, and a full-runoff path. Based 
on their implementation of the Li-Wei term model, the announcement of their no-runoff path in early 2022 causes 
the 10-year term premium to immediately fall 50 basis points relative to baseline. Expressed as a percent of GDP,

have faded gradually and by late 2025 be close to zero, given that the difference between the 
baseline path and the counterfactual path would be quite small by that point and would 
presumably be expected to disappear altogether in the near future.  
 
5. Inflation dynamics and monetary policy 
 
Rerunning history to see what might have happened to inflation had the FOMC followed the 
proposed counterfactual strategy involves simulating its effects using a complete model of the 
macroeconomy. In such an exercise, the specification of the macro model’s wage and price 
equations—that is, its Phillips curve—is of central importance. Because there is considerable 
debate currently about the “true” dynamics of wages and prices, fueled in large part by the 
failure of almost all forecasters to anticipate the recent inflation surge, this paper takes the 
approach of simulating the effects of changes in monetary policy using four different 
specifications of the Phillips curve, with each one in turn embedded in the structure of FRB/US, 
a large-scale estimated model of the US economy developed and maintained at the Federal 
Reserve Board.30 One of these specifications is based on the wage and price equations in the 
standard version of the FRB/US model, whereas the other three are drawn from recent empirical 
studies. This section begins by discussing the properties of the different Phillips curve 
specifications. It then reviews their implications for the response of real activity and inflation to 
illustrative shocks to monetary policy in the context of the full model, setting the stage for the 
presentation in the next section of the simulated effects of the counterfactual monetary policy 
contemplated in this paper. 
 
Beginning with the standard FRB/US specification, its Phillips curve is a complicated wage-
price system with a New Keynesian design based on Cogley and Sbordone (2008) in which the 
two key equations are for the employment cost index (ECI) measure of hourly compensation and 
core PCE prices, both estimated using data from 1987 to 2017.31 In this system, costly 
adjustment of wages and prices causes inflation to depend on both lagged actual inflation and 
expected near-term inflation, all expressed relative to ‘trend’ inflation, where the latter is defined 
using a survey-based measure of expected long-run inflation. In addition, actual and expected 
inflation depend on resource utilization because of its association with movements in marginal 
 
the difference between expected holdings along the no-runoff path and along the baseline path equals 6.6 percentage 
points on average from 2022 to 2026. By comparison, the average 2021-25 difference between the counterfactual 
holdings path considered here and the actual and SPD-projected path is -4.6 percentage points. Thus, the 
announcement effect of the counterfactual QE strategy should be roughly equal to -50*(-4.6/6.6), or 35 basis points. 
Calibrating the term premium effect of the counterfactual QE policy using their estimates for their full-runoff 
scenario yields a slightly smaller figure. 
30 FRB/US has been used extensively to analyze a wide range of policy issues and to assist the Federal Reserve staff 
in forecasting. Complete documentation of the model’s equations and properties, as well as links to related research 
papers, can be found at the FRB/US project website, www.federalreserve.gov/econres/us-models-about.htm. Laforte 
(2018) provides an overview of the current version of the model. As the FRB staff note on the website, the 
specification of FRB/US assumes optimizing behavior on the part of forward-looking households, nonfinancial 
firms, and financial market participants, and in that sense is similar in spirit to the design of DSGE models. But as 
the staff also note, in comparison to DSGE models, “FRB/US applies optimization theory more flexibly, which 
permits its equations to better capture patterns in historical data and facilitates modeling the economy in greater 
detail.” 
31 In addition, the FRB/US Phillips curve includes various auxiliary equations used to determine headline PCE 
prices, nonpetroleum import prices, and the prices of the major components of GDP.

costs, with utilization measured by the unemployment rate less a time-varying estimate of U*. 
Finally, the FRB/US wage and price equations include additional explanatory terms to control 
for the effects on headline and core inflation of a variety of identifiable exogenous “shocks,” 
including such things as movements in the relative prices of food, energy, and imports; the 
imposition of wage and price controls in the early 1970s; exogenous shifts in trend productivity 
and U*; and so forth.32 
 
The dynamics of the FRB/US Phillips curve, and in general those of the other specifications 
considered in this paper, have several important implications for monetary policy: 
 
• Long-run inflation expectations are reasonably well anchored in simulations and respond 
only slowly to movements in actual inflation, consistent with the observed behavior of 
survey measures over the past 30 years. That said, the experience of the 1960s through 
the late 1980s shows that this stability is not structural but instead depends on the 
commitment of monetary policymakers to keeping inflation low and stable.  
• Movements in labor utilization are estimated to account for only a small portion of the 
quarter-to-quarter or year-to-year movements in inflation seen historically, even prior to 
the late 1980s. Instead, short-run deviations of headline and core inflation from trend 
primarily reflect the effects of exogenous disturbances of various sorts, either identifiable 
ones, such as movements in the relative prices of food, energy, and imports, or 
unexplained shocks.  
• As long as long-run inflation expectations are slow to respond to movements in actual 
inflation and other factors, the ability of monetary policy to influence inflation in the 
short to medium run primarily depends on three things: the sensitivity of real activity and 
labor utilization to changes in policy, the direct sensitivity of inflation to resource 
utilization (that is, the slope of the Phillips curve), and the speed at which inflation 
adjusts to utilization pressures. The flatter the slope and the slower the speed, the less 
effective a given policy action will be in checking undesirable movements in inflation 
from year to year. In this regard, the FRB/US Phillips curve is rather flat and adjustment 
is gradual. 
• Finally, and perhaps most importantly, temporarily tight or weak labor market conditions 
have no persistent effect on inflation as long as long-run inflation expectations remain 
reasonably well anchored. But if these expectations are instead allowed to drift 
appreciably in response to movements in inflation or other factors, perhaps because the 
FOMC fails to convince the public about its commitment to keep inflation under control, 
then allowing the economy to run hot (cold) for a time will cause inflation to be 
permanently higher (lower) unless offset by a subsequent period of weak (strong) 
economic conditions. The same expectational dynamics apply to the longer-run inflation 
effects of transitory movements in the growth rates of relative food, energy, and import 
prices, and other temporary shocks.  
 
For the purpose of gauging the post-COVID contribution of monetary policy to inflation, one 
issue with using the FRB/US wage and price equations is that, as noted earlier, they 
 
32 The FRB/US Phillips curve also incorporates an estimated “error-correction” mechanism that causes both wages 
and prices to adjust slowly over time to bring the ratio of prices to unit labor costs in line with the equilibrium 
markup. This mechanism has only a small effect on the dynamics of inflation in the short to medium run, however.

unsatisfactorily attribute most of the recent surge to unexplained shocks to wages and prices. On 
a Q4-over-Q4 basis, headline PCE inflation rose from just under 1½ percent in 2019 to almost 6 
percent in both 2021 and 2022. Of this 4½ percentage point increase, the standard version of the 
model attributes about 2¾ percentage points averaged across the two years to unexplained post-
COVID shocks, a little under 1 percentage point to increases in relative food and energy prices, 
and almost a percentage point to other factors, including labor utilization but also other factors. 
Another potential issue is that, while the FRB/US Phillips curve is essentially linear, there are 
reasons to suspect that inflation dynamics may actually be nonlinear.33 If so, then the actual 
effect of changes in monetary policy on inflation may differ appreciably from the predictions of 
the standard version of FRB/US.  
 
To a degree, these issues with the FRB/US wage and price equations are addressed by the three 
alternative specifications of the Phillips curve drawn from recent studies: a linear wage-price 
system estimated by Bernanke and Blanchard (2023), a mildly nonlinear Phillips curve estimated 
Cecchetti and others (2023), and a more highly nonlinear set of wage and price equations 
estimated by Gagnon and Collins (2019). Details are provided in the appendix. The following 
summarizes the key features of the three alternative specifications and how they differ from the 
standard FRB/US Phillips curve: 
 
• Similar to the one in FRB/US, the wage-price system in Bernanke and Blanchard has ECI 
labor costs influencing consumer prices and vice versa. In contrast, the Phillips curve 
specification derived from the Gagnon-Collins study has separate equations for ECI wage 
growth and inflation without any interaction of wages and prices. The Phillips curve 
specification derived from Cecchetti and others explains core PCE inflation alone without 
conditioning on wages.34  
• Like the FRB/US specification, all three alternative Phillips curves are estimated using 
pre-COVID data only. However, the start dates of their estimation periods differ 
appreciably in the case of the inflation equation, ranging from the late 1950s and early 
1960s in the case of Gagnon and Collins and Cecchetti and others to 1990 in the case of 
Bernanke and Blanchard. Both Bernanke and Blanchard and Gagnon and Collins use 
similar start dates for estimating their ECI equations, 1990 and 1984, respectively, 
because of limited data availability. 
• The specifications derived from Bernanke and Blanchard and Cecchetti and others use 
V/U as their measure of labor utilization, in contrast to the unemployment measure used 
 
33 One possible nonlinearity arises from the fact that, as documented by Fallick, Villar, and Wascher (2020), there is 
a pileup at zero in the distribution of individual changes in nominal wage rates when aggregate wage growth has 
been low in the recent past because workers are extremely reluctant to accept actual reductions in nominal wage 
rates. Because of this reluctance, the pressure on wage costs and prices exerted by labor utilization should depend in 
part on the prevailing trend inflation rate. 
34 Because the main price inflation measure varies across the four Phillips curve specifications, incorporating the 
alternative specifications into FRB/US requires additional simple bridge equations that link movements in core CPI 
inflation to movements in headline CPI inflation (or vice versa, depending on the main price measure), and 
movements in core PCE to movements in core CPI inflation (or again, vice versa). As a result, all four specifications 
control for the direct effect of movements in the relative prices of food and energy on headline inflation in a 
consistent manner. In addition, the bridge equation linking core CPI inflation to core PCE inflation (or vice versa) 
controls for the greater cyclical sensitivity of the former relative to the latter, again in a consistent manner.

in both the specification preferred by Gagnon and Collins and the standard FRB/US 
specification.  
• Inflation responds nonlinearly to labor utilization in the Phillips curves derived from the 
“hot/cold” specification preferred by Cecchetti and others as well as in the “low-inflation-
bend” specification preferred by Gagnon and Collins. In the former, weak labor market 
conditions are estimated to put almost no downward pressure on inflation whereas strong 
conditions act to boost it modestly. In the latter, inflation is estimated to be quite 
responsive to labor utilization except when trend inflation and labor utilization are both 
low, in which case inflation becomes almost completely insensitive to slack.35 In 
contrast, the Bernanke-Blanchard and the standard FRB/US specifications respond 
linearly and modestly to movements in labor utilization.36 
• In contrast to the FRB/US and the Gagnon-Collins specifications, the Phillip curves 
proposed by Bernanke and Blanchard and by Cecchetti and others attempt to control for 
the effects of disruptions to aggregate supply by including an additional explanatory term 
intended to proxy for such effects. In the former, this term is an index of Google searches 
related to supply chain disruptions; in the latter, it is the manufacturing supplier deliveries 
index published by the Institute of Supply Management (ISM). 
• The Phillips curves estimated by Bernanke and Blanchard and by Cecchetti and others 
include explicit measures of long-run expected inflation as explanatory variables, as does 
the FRB/US specification. In contrast, the Gagnon and Collins specification does not 
include any explicit expected inflation terms but implicitly treats them as adaptive.  
• The inherent persistence of inflation varies across the different specifications. Controlling 
for long-run inflation expectations, persistence is relatively low in both the preferred 
Bernanke-Blanchard specification and in the standard FRB/US specification compared to 
the preferred specification of Cecchetti and others, reflecting in part the use of a longer 
estimation period for the latter. Persistence in the preferred Gagnon-Collins specification 
is also relatively low.  
• In the specifications proposed by Bernanke and Blanchard and Cecchetti and others, as in 
the standard FRB/US Phillips curve, long-run inflation expectations respond slowly to 
movements in actual inflation. In the Cecchetti and others and the FRB/US versions, 
 
35 Specifically, Gagnon and Collins estimate that the responsiveness of inflation to labor utilization falls almost to 
zero in states where the eight-quarter moving average of core CPI inflation is less than 3 percent and the 
unemployment rate is simultaneously greater than the Congressional Budget Office’s estimate of the noncyclical 
rate of unemployment (that is, U*).  
36 Because the specifications by Bernanke and Blanchard and Cecchetti and others use V/U to measure labor 
conditions instead of the unemployment rate, their estimated slope coefficients must be adjusted before they can be 
compared to the U-based ones of the Gagnon-Collins and standard FRB/US specifications. A simple way to make 
this adjustment is to multiply the sum of the estimated V/U slope coefficients (-0.6934 in the case of the Bernanke-
Blanchard linear specification and -0.6824 in the case of the Cecchetti and others for a “hot” labor market) by the 
ratio of the historical standard deviations of V/U and U. From 1990Q1 to 2019Q4, this ratio equals 0.26/1.60, or 
0.1625, which implies that the slope of these two Phillips curves is about -0.11 in unemployment space. In contrast, 
the Gagnon and Collins estimate of the slope in a high inflation environment equals -0.63—roughly six times as 
steep. Determining the effective slope of the Phillips curve in unemployment space in the standard FRB/US model is 
not straightforward because of its more complicated expectational structure, but a back-of-the-envelope calculation 
suggests that its slope is about the same as the Bernanke-Blanchard specification; this calculation assumes that 
expectations are based on the forecasts of a small vector auto-regression (VAR) model. Note that these calculations 
of comparative slopes abstract from the effects of differences in the lag structures of the four Phillips curves or in 
their treatment of long-run inflation expectations.

long-run inflation expectations are also directly influenced by the FOMC’s announced 
inflation target, which acts to limit the extent to which they can drift in simulation 
compared to the Bernanke-Blanchard specification.37 In the Gagnon-Collins 
specification, no unit root is imposed on inflation and wage growth and thus long-run 
inflation expectations are implicitly fixed.38 
 
As Bernanke and Blanchard and Cecchetti and others document, their preferred specifications do 
a reasonably good job of tracking recent movements in actual and expected inflation and, in the 
former case, movements in ECI wage growth as well, despite being estimated using only pre-
COVID data. The reason they do so appears to be primarily as result of two things: the use of 
V/U in place of the unemployment rate to measure labor utilization, and their inclusion of terms 
that attempt to measure the effects of supply disruptions.39 In contrast, the recent out-of-sample 
predictive performance of the Gagnon-Collins model is less clear. As Gagnon recently notes, this 
specification would require a large temporary increase in the effective value of U* post-COVID 
to be able to account for the recent surge in inflation and its subsequent moderation—that is to 
say, what amounts to large unexplained shocks, as in the standard FRB/US specification.40  
 
Monetary policy is only one of many factors affecting inflation in the short to medium run. For 
that reason, the recent importance of unexplained shocks to the Gagnon-Collins and standard 
FRB/US specifications does not necessarily imply that either is a poor way to gauge the inflation 
effects of recent FOMC policy, as long as those shocks are more or less exogenous to changes in 
monetary policy. Symmetrically, the fact that the other two specifications are better able to 
account for recent inflation without resorting to unexplained shocks does not necessarily mean 
that they yield more reliable or even, as will soon be seen, materially different estimates of the 
inflation effects of the counterfactual policy.  
 
37 Specifically, the updating formula for long-run inflation expectations used by financial market participants, 
nonfinancial firms, and households in the standard FRB/US simulations is 𝜋𝜋𝑡𝑡
𝐿𝐿𝐿𝐿𝐿𝐿𝐿𝐿𝐿𝐿= .9𝜋𝜋𝑡𝑡−1
𝐿𝐿𝐿𝐿𝐿𝐿𝐿𝐿𝐿𝐿+ .05𝜋𝜋𝑡𝑡−1 +
.05𝜋𝜋𝑡𝑡−1
∗
, where 𝜋𝜋𝑡𝑡
𝐿𝐿𝐿𝐿𝐿𝐿𝑋𝑋𝑋𝑋is expected long-run inflation, 𝜋𝜋𝑡𝑡 is core PCE inflation expressed at an annual rate, and 𝜋𝜋𝑡𝑡
∗ is 
the FOMC’s announced inflation target. As noted in the appendix, a similar formula is used in the simulations based 
on the Cecchetti and others Phillips curve. In both cases, agents change their long-run inflation expectations 
gradually in response to a permanent change in the target, abstracting from the effects of any accompanying changes 
in actual inflation. 
38 This statement needs to be qualified because Gagnon and Collins allow the intercept and the sum of the lagged 
inflation coefficients in their estimated core CPI and ECI equations to change over time. As a result, trend inflation 
in their model implicitly shifts over time and is estimated to be markedly higher from the late 1960s to 1994 than it 
was from 1995 to 2019. This shift presumably reflects systematic changes in monetary policy over the past 50 years, 
and thus their specification also implicitly allows for the possibility that a persistently lax monetary policy could 
cause these coefficients to shift again. The simulations reported below, however, hold these coefficients constant at 
their 1995-2019 estimated values. 
39 Both specifications (with their accompanying PCE-CPI bridge equations) are also more than able to account for 
the marked declines in both headline and core PCE inflation recorded in 2023, assuming that the Bernanke-
Blanchard shortage variable has continued to gradually move back in line with its pre-COVID level after 2022, as 
the ISM index used by Cecchetti and others has. Both specifications estimate that the decline in V/U from its peak in 
2022Q2 was a relatively minor factor in the 2023 moderation in headline PCE inflation, subtracting only three- or 
four-tenths of a percentage point; declines in relative food and energy prices and especially an easing of supply 
disruptions are estimated to have been much more important.

Regardless of which specification of the Phillips curve is incorporated into the overall FRB/US 
model, its monetary transmission mechanism can be roughly characterized as follows. The 
primary way the FOMC influences the economy is through policy actions and forward guidance 
that influence the expectations of financial market participants and others about the future path of 
the federal funds rate. If the FOMC acts to raise the average level of this expected path, 
corporate bond yields, residential mortgage rates, and other borrowing costs rise, corporate 
equity prices and household wealth fall, and the real exchange rate appreciates, all else equal. 
This general tightening in financial conditions, which is augmented in simulations by 
endogenous increases in risk and term premiums, as well as additional QE-driven exogenous 
shifts in term premiums, in turn puts direct downward pressure on consumer spending, 
residential and nonresidential investment, and net exports; weaker spending in turn prompts 
firms to reduce employment and hours. Magnifying these direct financial effects on aggregate 
spending and the labor market are additional expectational effects as households and firms 
become more pessimistic about future income and sales. Finally, current wage growth and price 
inflation moderate in response to the decline in resource utilization and the implications it has for 
expected future inflation as described above.  
 
To simulate the effects of monetary policy using the four different Phillips curves as well as the 
BA rule, the standard model must be modified to include equations for V/U and ZVU. Consistent 
with its behavior pre-COVID, ZVU is assumed to move one for one with the unemployment rate 
relative to baseline, whereas the equation for V/U is the inverted rescaling formula.41 This 
linearity assumption is important because of the possibility that tighter monetary policy would 
have altered the extent to which post-COVID labor market disruptions caused the Beveridge 
curve first to shift up and later begin shifting back. Presumably, tighter policy would not have 
improved labor market functioning, implying that it would not have caused a larger increase in 
ZVU relative to history compared to the accompanying increase in the unemployment rate. But 
there is the possibility that it might have worsened labor market functioning, thereby resulting in 
a smaller increase in ZVU relative to the unemployment rate than the model would predict and 
so causing the simulations to overstate the actual ability of tighter monetary policy to have 
reduced inflationary pressures arising from an overheated labor market.42 
 
Figure 10 illustrates the dynamics of the FRB/US transmission mechanism by showing the 
simulated full-model response of interest rates, real activity, and inflation to a percentage point 
hike in the federal funds rate that the FOMC announces will last for four quarters, with monetary 
 
41 The inverted formula is 𝑉𝑉/𝑈𝑈𝑡𝑡= 1.107 − 0.146 𝑍𝑍𝑍𝑍𝑍𝑍𝑡𝑡+ 0.005 𝑇𝑇𝑇𝑇𝑇𝑇𝑇𝑇𝑇𝑇𝑇𝑇𝑡𝑡, implying that a change in monetary 
policy that increases ZVU and U by one percentage point reduces V/U by -0.146. The intercept and the time trend 
are suppressed in simulations of the model without any effect on results because baseline tracking residuals are 
applied to all the model’s equations. 
42 A somewhat different possibility is implied by the analysis in Figura and Waller (2022) of the forces that led to an 
upward shift in the Beveridge curve after COVID hit. In that study, they suggested that the upward shift might 
unwind by vacancies declining appreciably without the unemployment rate rising—a prediction that appears to have 
been correct. In principle, these same dynamics may suggest that firms would have responded to tighter monetary 
policy and thus weaker sales by, relative to their actual paths from 2021 to 2023, reducing posted job openings 
noticeably while simultaneously cutting employment by less than would be expected based on its historical 
relationship to aggregate output. If so, then the FRB/US simulations would tend to overstate the effect of the 
counterfactual monetary policy on the unemployment rate while perhaps accurately gauging its effect on V/U.

policy thereafter following the prescriptions of the BA rule. The simulations are run using the 
four different specifications of the Phillips curve and a baseline consistent with being in the steep 
portion of the nonlinear Phillips curves estimated by Cecchetti and others and by Gagnon and 
Collins, as has been the case for the US economy since 2021. In the simulations, financial market 
participants are assumed to be well-informed about the economic implications of the FOMC’s 
announcement, which they treat as completely credible; specifically, their expectations are 
assumed to be consistent with the predictions of the full model. In contrast, households and other 
economic agents are assumed to be less well-informed and revise their expectations in line with 
the average historical behavior of the economy in response to observed changes in economic 
conditions as they occur, based on the predictions of a small VAR model.  
 
As the figure shows, the temporary rise in the federal funds rate causes real activity to weaken 
appreciably for a time, with the peak effect occurring about a year and a half after the initial 
hike; these effects are largely the same across all four Phillips curves. In contrast, inflation 
responses are extremely modest across all the specifications, with the limited exception of the 
highly nonlinear Gagnon-Collins version, where the peak decline in inflation is similar in 
magnitude to the peak increase in the unemployment rate. Nevertheless, the results for even this 
optimistic trade-off case would not seem to suggest much of an ability for monetary policy to 
check undesirable short-run movements in inflation: Taken literally, they imply that the FOMC 
would have had to hike the federal funds rate by 30 percentage points in early 2021 to keep 
headline PCE inflation near 2 percent in 2022.43 
 
These effects may seem surprisingly small given the standard view that Fed monetary policy 
played a major role in first allowing trend inflation to rise to a high level during the 1970s, then 
engineering a major disinflation over the course of the 1980s and early 1990s, and finally 
anchoring the trend at around 2 percent thereafter (at least prior to COVID). For three of the 
specifications, the difference between the simulation results and the inflation dynamics of the 
1970-90 period partly reflects currently estimated slopes of the Phillips curve that are much 
lower than those estimated back in the 1980s, which were derived using data from a period in 
which inflation was quite volatile and persistent. In contrast, the direct short-run effects of 
resource utilization on inflation in the steep portion of the Gagnon-Collins Phillips curve are 
similar in magnitude to estimates reported in the mid-1980s; for example, the estimated Phillips 
curves reported by Gordon and Hall (1985) have slope coefficients—after adjustment to put 
them on an unemployment basis—that are also roughly equal to -0.6. The difference, however, is 
that resource utilization effects on inflation are symmetric in the Gordon-Hall specification and, 
more importantly, are much more persistent, with no apparent anchoring of long-run inflation 
expectations, unlike the situation since the mid-1990s. 
 
Although these simulation results help to illustrate the basic dynamics of FRB/US, they are only 
so useful in gauging what the counterfactual monetary policy might have accomplished: Not 
only does a temporary hike in the federal funds rate differ importantly from a permanent switch 
to a rule-based policy, but the counterfactual strategy also incorporates important changes in 
 
43 If the baseline had instead been constructed to mimic conditions in the years immediately prior to COVID, then 
the Gagnon-Collins specification would have generated essentially no response of inflation to the hike in the federal 
funds rate. Similarly, inflation would be essentially unaffected by the policy shock in the Cecchetti and others 
version if the unemployment rate had been greater than U* in the baseline.

forward guidance and QE policy—things not at play in figure 10. To get a sense of how forward 
guidance operates in the model, figure 11 compares the effects of unannounced and 
preannounced temporary hikes in the federal funds rate using the standard version of the 
FRB/US Phillips curve. (Effects using the other three versions are similar.) Again, financial 
market participants are assumed to have model-consistent expectations and to view the 
announced hikes as completely credible, whereas households and other agents are less well-
informed and do not react directly to the hikes until they occur. The main takeaway from the 
figure is that forward guidance in FRB/US, if credible, has an immediate effect on long-term 
interest rates and other financial conditions that influence real activity and inflation in advance of 
the actual change in the federal funds rate. In fact, the economic effects of a preannounced 
temporary tightening are actually larger than those of an unexpected one because households and 
nonfinancial firms have more time to adjust to the tighter financial conditions.44 
 
Finally, figure 12 illustrates the effects in FRB/US of a jump in term premiums that thereafter 
gradually fades away, using the four different versions of the Phillips curve and the same 
expectational assumptions. The size of the initial jump in the 10-year term premium and its 
subsequent path is calibrated to match that estimated in the previous section to accompany the 
counterfactual QE policy; consistent with previous research using the Li-Wei term structure 
model, accompanying shifts in 5-year and 30-year term premiums are scaled by 0.70 and 0.30 of 
the 10-year shift.45 Real activity declines in response to tighter financial conditions created by 
the higher term premiums, with the peak effect on unemployment occurring two years after the 
initial shock. Again, inflation is little affected. In response to these weaker economic conditions, 
the BA rule prescribes a modestly lower path of the federal funds rate, which serves to mitigate 
somewhat the contractionary effects of the higher term premiums—an effect that illustrates the 
way in which QE actions can serve as a partial substitute for interest rate actions. 
 
6. Simulation results for the counterfactual strategy 
 
With the basic dynamics of FRB/US established, the paper now turns to a full-model assessment 
of how conditions might have evolved under the counterfactual monetary policy. In doing so, the 
base-case assumption continues to be that financial market participants are well-informed about 
the economic implications of changes in monetary policy and have no doubt that the FOMC will 
strictly follow the prescriptions of the BA rule with V/U used to gauge labor utilization, whereas 
other agents are less well-informed and revise their expectations in line with the predictions of a 
small VAR model. However, financial market participants are not assumed to have perfect 
foresight about the specific path the federal funds rate would have eventually followed under the 
BA rule because that would have unrealistically required them to know in advance the future 
shocks to real activity and inflation that would drive the rule-based policy over time. Instead, the 
simulations assume that well-informed agents learn about these shocks only as they occur, as 
embodied in the evolution of the SPD projections from early 2021 to late 2023. To do this 
requires the use of a sequence of SPD-release-specific baselines for the simulations, where each 
 
44 This perhaps surprising behavior is sometimes referred to as the forward-guidance puzzle. As documented in 
Chung (2015), the effect in FRB/US appears to be appreciably smaller and hence more plausible than it is in some 
DSGE models of the US economy, such as the Federal Reserve Board’s Economic Dynamic Optimization (EDO) 
model and especially the well-known Smets-Wouters model.  
45 See, for example, Engen, Laubach, and Reifschneider (2015); Kiley (2018); and Bernanke (2020). 


Page | 23  
 
baseline corresponds to history up to the date of each release and the release’s projections past 
that date. The model simulations then rerun events from early 2021 on subject to the evolving 
shocks to the economy embedded in the baselines, both realized and anticipated in the SPD 
projections, with the exception of the past and projected baseline deviations from the BA rule, 
which are set to zero. (See the appendix for further details.) 
 
Figure 13 and table 1 summarize the model’s predictions for how interest rates, real activity, and 
core inflation would have evolved relative to history and the December 2023 SPD projection if 
the FOMC had followed the counterfactual monetary policy beginning in early 2021. For all four 
versions of the Phillips curve, the simulations show the federal funds rate climbing much more 
rapidly in 2021 and 2022 than it actually did, peaking at just over 8 percent before beginning to 
decline steadily back toward its projected longer-run level as prescribed by the gradualist rule. In 
turn, the versions predict that these tighter financial conditions would have pushed the economy 
into a mild slump in which the unemployment rate would have climbed to around 5 percent by 
2022 and stayed there into 2024, with V/U falling back to its pre-COVID level by 2024. Despite 
the weaker labor market conditions, however, the simulations generally predict that tighter 
monetary policy would have had little or no effect on the surge in inflation in 2021 and 2022 and 
only modest effects thereafter. Results using the Gagnon-Collins specification are somewhat of 
an exception: While this version of the model also suggests that the counterfactual monetary 
policy would have done little to check inflation in 2021, it does predict that inflation would have 
been reduced more appreciably later on, with PCE inflation reduced by a little over ½ percentage 
point in 2022 and slightly more than 1 percentage point in 2023.    
 
Why are the predicted short-term inflation effects of the counterfactual strategy so modest? The 
primary reason was discussed in the previous section: The estimated slope of the Phillips curve is 
fairly low in all four cases, even in the Gagnon-Collins specification. Another limiting factor is 
that inflation is estimated to respond only gradually to changes in labor utilization in all four 
specifications. Moreover, in the three versions of the Phillips curve that explicitly control for 
movements in long-run inflation expectations (FRB/US, Bernanke and Blanchard, and Cecchetti 
and others), these expectations adjust slowly and only modestly to the policy-driven reduction in 
inflation, as shown in table 1. Thus, none of the specifications supports the claim that the FOMC 
should have been able to head off much if any of the inflation surge in 2021-22, although the 
Gagnon-Collins version does suggest that tighter policy could have brought inflation back to 
target somewhat faster than the other specifications.  
 
Another factor limiting the ability of the counterfactual policy to check inflation involves the 
evolution of market expectations in the simulations, illustrated in figure 14 for the standard 
version of FRB/US. (Results generated using the three other versions of the model are similar.) 
In the simulations, when the new counterfactual policy would have been announced in early 
2021, financial market participants would have initially anticipated that this alternative policy 
would hold the federal funds rate at the ELB through 2021 and then put it on a gradual upward 
trajectory back toward its expected long-run level—a path that would have been only marginally 
more restrictive than the one the primary dealers actually expected in March 2021 (see figure 6). 
This similarity reflects the fact that financial markets at the time did not anticipate either the 
coming surge in inflation or the speed at which the labor market would tighten, with the result 
that the announced change in policy would not have initially signaled a radically different future 


Page | 24  
 
path for the federal funds rate. Given such a modest initial effect on expectations, long-term 
interest rates increased only slightly in early 2021 in the simulation relative to baseline, 
abstracting from the modest effect of the rise in term premiums caused by the announcement of 
the counterfactual QE policy. As a result, the switch to the alternative policy would not have 
initially caused overall financial conditions to tighten markedly, thereby limiting the policy’s 
initial contractionary effect. Of course, as time passed the implications of the incoming news on 
inflation and real activity for the expected future path of the federal funds rate under the 
counterfactual policy would have been considerable. By 2021Q4, for example, the simulated 
expected path under the counterfactual policy for 2022-24 was almost 340 basis points higher on 
average than the one the primary dealers and the FOMC actually expected in December 2021. 
Nevertheless, because the full implications of the alternative policy for future interest rates 
would have taken time to emerge, and thereby increased the already substantial inherent lag in 
the effects of monetary policy on the economy, the FOMC would have had little ability to check 
inflationary pressures quickly. 
 
For some of the Phillips curve specifications, the assumption that only financial markets are 
well-informed about the effects of the change in monetary policy acts to noticeably damp the 
response of inflation. Although this base-case assumption seems much more realistic than an 
alternative one in which nonfinancial firms and especially households are also well-informed, 
table 2 reports simulation results for the latter expectational case.46 For the version of FRB/US 
that incorporates the model’s standard wage and price equations, the effect is to modestly boost 
the inflation effects of the counterfactual policy because wage and price setters now recognize 
the persistence of the change in policy, which acts to boost their near-term inflation expectations 
and thus actual inflation relative to the results reported in table 1. Predicted inflation effects also 
increase in the Bernanke-Blanchard version of the model when all agents are well-informed, for 
the same reason. In both cases, the somewhat larger inflation effects result in somewhat smaller 
upward shifts in the path for the federal funds rate relative to baseline—something that helps to 
buffer the now more contractionary effects of shifts in expected household income and business 
sales under this expectational assumption. For the other two specifications of the Phillips curve, 
however, altering this expectational assumption matters less for inflation because the short-run 
inflation expectations implicit in these estimated inflation equations remain essentially adaptive. 
 
The simulation results reported in tables 1 and 2 suggest that the counterfactual strategy would 
have resulted in a fairly moderate recession by historical standards. Even though the interest 
sensitivity of aggregate spending in FRB/US appears to be, if anything, somewhat larger than 
what a simple reduced-form equation would suggest,47 one might nonetheless wonder about the 
 
46 In these simulations, all agents are assumed to update their long-run inflation expectations only gradually in 
response to persistent movements in actual inflation—the same assumption used when only financial market 
participants are well-informed.

possibility of a more substantial contractionary response given that the economic effects of 
interest rate shocks are larger in some DSGE models than they are in FRB/US.48 As a somewhat 
extreme test of this possibility, the simulations are rerun with the sensitivity of consumption, 
investment, and net exports to movements in the cost of capital, loan rates, household wealth, 
and the real exchange doubled; as in the base case, only financial market participants are 
assumed to be well-informed about the economic implications of the more restrictive policy. 
Results from this exercise are reported in table 3. As might be expected, the much greater interest 
sensitivity of spending causes real activity and inflation to decline more appreciably in response 
to the counterfactual policy even though the path of the federal funds rate is now somewhat 
lower relative to the standard sensitivity case. Nevertheless, inflation in 2021 remains essentially 
unchanged under all four specifications of the Phillips curve, although somewhat more 
substantial reductions in inflation are now predicted for 2022 and 2023. 
 
One reaction to these simulation results might be that the counterfactual policy is too gradualist, 
and that the FOMC should have responded to the enactment of several major fiscal packages and 
other post-COVID developments by tightening even more quickly and aggressively in 2021. In 
that way, one might argue, the Fed could have done more to check the initial surge in inflation. 
Such a preemptive response would have been quite difficult for the FOMC to justify at the time, 
given that a nongradualist version of the balanced rule would have called for a negative federal 
funds rate as late as the April 2021 FOMC meeting.49 Moreover, and as noted in the 
introduction, well past that date most outside forecasters did not see a need for a marked 
tightening in monetary policy. But if the FOMC had started tightening rapidly in early 2021, 
steadily raising the federal funds rate to around 5¾ percent by year’s end with policy thereafter 
following the prescriptions of the gradualist balanced approach rule, then model simulations 
suggest that it would not have materially changed the predicted outcomes for real activity and 
inflation, for two reasons. First, well-informed financial market participants would have 
recognized that the more rapid upfront rise in short-term rates under this policy would be 
followed by a corresponding more rapid easing in 2022 and 2023, with the result that long-term 
interest rates and other financial factors are not greatly altered in the simulation relative to the 
base-case simulation results reported in table 1. Second, real activity and inflation respond to 
changes in financial conditions with a lag, which acts to damp their short-run responses to 
changes in financial conditions in the simulation.  
 
Another reaction to these results might be that something important is missing from the FRB/US-
based analysis. One possibility is that the FOMC’s delay in tightening in 2021, or perhaps its 
adoption of flexible average inflation targeting in August 2020, spurred some change in inflation 
dynamics not captured by the different specifications of the Phillips curve.50 One way such a 
 
48 Chung (2015) shows this is case for two DSGE models, the Smets-Wouters model and the Federal Reserve 
Board’s EDO model. Both models are much more sensitive to preannounced hikes in the federal funds rate. 
49 At the time of the late April 2021 meeting, the FOMC had readings on 12-month core CPI inflation and the 
unemployment rate through March (1.6 percent and 6.0 percent, respectively). It also had readings on V/U through 
February (0.78); rescaled, the latter figure equals 6.7 percent. Plugging these numbers into the BA rule with 𝜌𝜌= 0 
yields a prescribed level of the federal funds rate equal to -3.4 percent. In contrast, a similar calculation using 
updated data would have yielded a positive value by the time of the June 2021 meeting. 
50 In its consensus statement on longer-run goals and strategy issued at that time and since reaffirmed annually, the 
FOMC stated that from now on it intends “to achieve inflation that averages 2 percent over time” rather than 
continuing its previous strategy of ignoring past misses. The statement then went on to clarify that “following

change might have manifested is through surprisingly large movements in measures of expected 
inflation. But as Bernanke and Blanchard note, the evolution in their measure of short-run 
inflation expectations post-COVID is about what one would have expected given the pre-COVID 
historical relationship between such expectations and lagged actual inflation. This unsurprising 
behavior is illustrated in figure 15 for median expectations reported in both the Michigan 
University Surveys of Consumers and the Survey of Professional Forecasters, which shows that 
the two survey measures rose in line with the out-of-sample predictions of a simple model 
estimated using pre-COVID data.51  
 
As for measures of long-run inflation expectations, figure 16 shows that they have remained 
remarkedly well anchored in the face of an extremely large and persistent rise in actual 
inflation.52 This apparent stability suggests that, had the counterfactual monetary policy 
succeeded in damping movements in these measures even further, any marginal reduction in 
actual inflation achieved through this channel would have been quite small. In addition, this 
stability helps to explain why inflation has moderated so appreciably in recent quarters. As long 
as long-run inflation expectations remain reasonably well anchored, the standard New Keynesian 
Phillip curve predicts that, once labor utilization is back to its long-run sustainable level, 
inflation should gradually move back to its long-run trend in the absence of new shocks. Thus, it 
is not particularly surprising that inflation has fallen substantially since its peak in early 2022 
given that the labor market now appears to be much less overheated and indications that supply 
chain disruptions have faded appreciably in recent quarters. Of course, the slowing in inflation 
would have presumably been less pronounced if the FOMC had not begun to tighten 
aggressively starting in March 2022. If policy had continued to be extremely easy through the 
present, labor market conditions and the overall economy would certainly have been even 
stronger than they have been, thereby putting more upward pressure on wages and prices. In 
addition, a failure to tighten might have caused long-run inflation expectations to drift up more 
noticeably, potentially giving rise to a chronic inflation problem.  
 
One might also speculate that easy monetary policy might have changed inflation dynamics in a 
way that caused the effects of shocks to become inherently more persistent, even after explicitly 
controlling for movements in long-run inflation expectations. The findings of Bernanke and 
Blanchard do not support this possibility, however, as their specification of the Phillips curve 
does a reasonably good job of explaining recent inflation developments out of sample. However, 
 
periods when inflation has been running persistently below 2 percent, appropriate monetary policy will likely aim to 
achieve inflation moderately above 2 percent for some time.” Importantly, the committee then or later did not say 
how it would respond if past average inflation was running above target, an omission implying that the new strategy 
is asymmetric. (See www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/pressreleases/monetary20200827a.htm.) The practical 
import of the change in strategy for the FOMC’s actual policy actions and forward guidance is not clear, however.  
51 The equations are based on regressions of each survey measure on a constant, its own lag, current CPI inflation, 
and lagged headline CPI inflation over the previous five quarters, using quarterly data from 1990Q1 to 2019Q4. The 
forecasts presented in figure 15 are dynamic and conditioned on the predicted lagged value of the survey, not its 
actual value. 
52 In fact, long-run inflation expectations appear to have been more stable than might have been expected given the 
marked rise in actual inflation. For example, the FRB/US equation used to account for movements in the median 
SPF projection of PCE inflation over the next 10 years—the measure of the expected long-run inflation used in the 
standard version of the model—predicts that this measure would have risen from 2.0 percent in early 2020 to 2.8 
percent by late 2023 in the absence of own-shocks in response to higher core inflation and an unchanged FOMC 
inflation target, rather than only edging up to 2.2 percent.

Cecchetti and others do consider this possibility and conclude that persistence probably has in 
fact changed by reverting back to the higher level estimated to have prevailed on average from 
the early 1960s through 2019. Nevertheless, the simulation results generated using their preferred 
more-persistent specification suggest that, even if persistence has increased, a tighter monetary 
policy would nonetheless have had only a modest effect on inflation.  
 
Another possibility is that the model simulations do not take adequate account of the effect easy 
monetary policy might have had on the relative prices of food, energy, and imports or other 
supply shocks. And in fact, these relative prices, along the two supply disruption measures used 
by Bernanke and Blanchard and Cecchetti and others, are assumed to be completely invariant in 
the simulations to changes in monetary policy. As a check on the validity on this assumption, the 
relative price terms used in the various Phillips curve specification were regressed on their own 
lags plus lags in the real federal funds rate and the output gap (separately and jointly) using pre-
COVID data. The result was that the output gap and the real federal funds rate generally explain 
little of the historical movement in these series; moreover, p-values from exclusion tests are 
typically greater than 5 percent, providing statistical support for treating these relative price 
terms as exogenous. Similar regressions and exclusion tests were run for the ISM manufacturing 
supplier delivery index, with the same result. Finally, simulations of the counterfactual monetary 
policy were run using versions of the model to which were added simple estimated equations for 
the relative price terms and for the ISM index. This exercise yielded results for core PCE 
inflation that were only a tenth or two different from those reported in table 1 for the 2021-23 
period, although effects for the 2024-25 period increased by somewhat more for the three non-
FRB/US Phillips curves.53  
 
Because the Bernanke-Blanchard supply disruption measure shows no noticeable variation prior 
to 2020, no similar regression or simulation tests were run for this explanatory variable. One can, 
however, speculate on whether tighter monetary policy might have helped to mitigate the 
severity of such disruptions, whether measured by this variable or as manifested in other ways. 
In general, it seems improbable that monetary policy could have noticeably affected the direct 
fallout from such events as the war in Ukraine, avian bird flu, production lags in ramping up the 
global supply of semiconductors, or the increased demand for rental living space in the wake of 
COVID pandemic. Still, it does seem possible that tighter monetary policy might have limited to 
some extent the surge in consumer spending on goods during the pandemic, thereby easing 
capacity pressures in the manufacturing and distribution of these goods, with potentially sizable 
effects on their prices. Higher interest rates might also have helped to restrain the surge in travel-
related demand somewhat as fears of COVID diminished, as well as reduced the upward 
pressure on home values. Unfortunately, not enough research has been done on such sector-
specific disaggregated transmission channels to be able to say much about their likely aggregate 
effect.   
 
In contrast to the results presented here, Gagliardone and Gertler (2023) find that easy FOMC 
monetary policy substantially contributed to the inflation surge. Using a DSGE model to parse 
the contributions of policy and energy prices, they estimate that policy “shocks” contributed 
 
53 Out-year results generated using the Cecchetti and others Phillips curve are the most affected by endogenizing the 
supply-shock terms, causing the simulated effects of the counterfactual policy on core PCE inflation to more than 
double to almost a full percentage point reduction in both 2024 and 2025.

about 1½ percentage points to core PCE inflation in both 2021 and 2022, with the 2023 
contribution turning negative, in the version of their model that controls for the effects of FOMC 
forward guidance by matching a proxy rate. Determining why their model yields such a large 
inflation effect relative to the one predicted by FRB/US is difficult because the model structures 
differ in important ways; for example, FRB/US has a more detailed monetary transmission 
mechanism and the design of the DSGE model is more tightly tied to theory. In addition, their 
monetary shocks—identified as movements in interest rate futures occurring in a narrow window 
after FOMC policy announcements—are conceptually different from the policy “surprise” 
considered in this paper, which primarily takes the form of an unexpected announcement in early 
2021 of a permanent change in how the federal funds rate will be set in the future. Finally, the 
procedures used to estimate the two models are quite different.  
 
These differences in model structure and methodology have their respective pros and cons, and 
no assertion is made here that the FRB/US-based estimates reported in this paper are obviously 
better than the ones reported by Gagliardone and Gertler. But two aspects of their model and 
analysis are noteworthy. First, it appears that the effective slope of the Phillips curve embedded 
in their DSGE model is much steeper than even the Gagnon-Collins one.54 Second, some of the 
results reported in their paper seem counterintuitive, such as their estimate that monetary policy 
shocks subtracted more than 1 percentage point from the average annual rate of inflation from 
2016 through early 2020. Their estimate that monetary policy was persistently tight pre-COVID 
seems hard to reconcile with an average level of the federal funds rate during this period that, at 
1.3 percent, was quite low by historical standards. It also seems hard to reconcile with the 
forecast errors made by the primary dealers. In late 2015, the primary dealers projected a path for 
the federal funds rate from 2016 to 2018 that turned out to be 60 basis points higher on average 
than the one the FOMC actually implemented, while projecting an accompanying path for core 
PCE inflation that was close to what actually occurred—a combination of forecast errors that 
seems inconsistent with the claim that monetary policy was surprisingly tight during these years.  
 
Finally, one has to acknowledge that despite all the variations of the FRB/US model considered 
in this paper, the range of reported simulation results almost certainly understates how much 
uncertainty there is about what would have actually happened had the FOMC actually pursued a 
more restrictive policy of the sort considered here. Ball, Leigh, and Mishra (2022), for example, 
propose an extremely nonlinear and rather unorthodox specification of the Phillips curve in 
which the median PCE inflation series is a cubic function of both V/U and the difference 
between headline PCE inflation and median inflation. Evaluated at the recent peak level of V/U, 
their specification implies that a policy-induced decline in V/U of the magnitude reported in 
table 1 would have reduced median inflation by 3.9 percentage points in 2021-22. Although an 
effect of this magnitude leads one to wonder about the robustness of their estimated 
unconventional model, especially as it implies the FOMC should have had a remarkable ability 
 
54 The marked difference in slopes is apparent in some unpublished simulation results using the Gagliardone-Gertler 
model that Mark Gertler has graciously provided. In this simulation, the federal funds rate counterfactually begins 
rising rapidly starting in mid-2021, reaching 3¼ percent by the end of the year and 5¼ percent by late 2022, where it 
remains thereafter. In response, the unemployment rate follows a path that on average is about 1 percentage point 
higher than its actual path, while four-quarter inflation is reduced about 1 percentage point in 2021 and by 2 
percentage points in 2022 and 2023 relative to history. Thus, the response of inflation to unit change in labor 
utilization in their model is roughly twice as large as the one-for-one response reported for the Gagnon-Collins 
Phillips curve reported in table 1.

to fine-tune inflation historically, it does illustrate that there might well be some reasonable 
alternative specification of the Phillips curve that would generate larger inflation effects than the 
ones reported in this paper. Another possibility is that the FRB/US-based simulations 
underestimate the contractionary effect of the counterfactual policy on real activity, and thus 
inflation, even in those simulations in which the interest sensitivity of aggregate spending is 
doubled. Perhaps a policy this restrictive would have inadvertently triggered widespread 
financial distress, pushing the economy into a much deeper recession than shown in the 
simulations, with larger attendant effects on inflation. After all, macro models and forecasters 
more generally have a poor track record in predicting financial crises and recessions. That said, 
the economy so far has remained remarkably strong despite the 500 basis point increase in the 
federal funds rate. 
 
7. Conclusions  
 
This paper uses simulations of the FRB/US model incorporating different specifications of the 
Phillips curve derived from several recent studies, run under different assumptions about 
expectations formation and the interest sensitivity of aggregate spending, to assess what might 
have happened had the FOMC implemented a much more restrictive monetary policy in the 
wake of COVID. Under the counterfactual policy, the FOMC would have adjusted the level of 
the federal funds rate over time as prescribed by the benchmark BA rule, with V/U used as the 
measure of labor utilization rather than the standard unemployment rate; in addition, the FOMC 
would have issued much less accommodative forward guidance about the likely future path of 
the federal funds rate and would have ended its large-scale asset purchase program earlier. As a 
result, the federal funds rate would have started rising rapidly in 2021 and would have stood 4 
percentage points or so higher than it actually did by early 2022.  
 
Under the base-case assumptions for expectations and interest sensitivity, the model predicts that 
real activity would have been materially weaker as a result of the more restrictive strategy, with 
the unemployment rate running at around 5 percent in 2022 and 2023, more than a percentage 
point higher than it actually did. Nevertheless, for all the specifications of the Phillips curve 
considered in this paper, the base-case simulations also suggest that the counterfactual policy 
would have done essentially nothing to check the initial surge in inflation in 2021 and would 
have reduced it by only a few tenths in 2022. The counterfactual policy would, however, have 
helped to bring PCE inflation somewhat more quickly back to 2 percent thereafter, albeit at a risk 
of temporarily undershooting the FOMC’s inflation target for a time. Qualitatively, the 
simulation results are not greatly affected by alternative (and less realistic) simulation 
assumptions. 
 
Overall, what do these results suggest about the degree to which a more restrictive monetary 
policy would have improved recent macroeconomic performance? A crude way to address this 
issue is to measure performance using a quadratic loss function that penalizes deviations of PCE 
inflation from 2 percent and values of the unemployment rate greater than 4.1 percent (the 
FOMC’s current estimate of U*), all cumulated over the period 2021Q1 to 2025Q4. As shown in 
table 4, by this simple metric the loss under the policy actions actually taken by the FOMC is 
less than the simulated loss under the counterfactual policy for all the different permutations of 
Phillips curve specification, expectations formation, and interest sensitivity, with the exception 


Page | 30  
 
of two out of the three estimates derived using the Gagnon-Collins Phillips curve. For these two 
cases, the trade-off between unemployment and inflation is sufficiently favorable to suggest that 
tighter monetary policy might have been worthwhile. 
 
Of course, there are many economic developments that affect social welfare but are not factored 
into these simple loss calculations, such as changes in the distribution of real household incomes. 
Unfortunately, the structure of the FRB/US model is too simple to estimate how tighter monetary 
policy might have affected these more micro considerations. An additional macro consideration 
that the model can address, however, is how tighter monetary policy might have affected average 
real wage rates. As shown in tables 1-3, tighter policy causes the nominal growth rate of ECI 
hourly compensation to consistently fall by more than PCE inflation for three of the four 
specifications of the Phillips curve, with the result that the level of real ECI hourly compensation 
is 1 to 1½ percent lower by late 2025 under the base-case simulation assumptions. The exception 
again is the Gagnon-Collins Phillips curve, where the simulation results would seem to imply 
that tighter monetary policy would have raised the level of the real wage. However, this result is 
most likely an artifact of the different sample periods used to estimate the ECI and core inflation 
equations in that study, as the former uses data that start in the 1980s while the latter uses data 
that start in 1959. If the core inflation equation estimates had instead estimated using the shorter 
ECI sample period, the simulation results would be consistent with the standard finding that 
wages are more sensitive than prices to movements in labor utilization.55 On balance, the 
simulation results do not support the notion that overly easy monetary policy hurt households by 
allowing elevated price inflation to erode their real incomes; instead, a more aggressive 
responsive would have made the situation worse. 
 
Another limitation of these simple loss calculations is that they abstract from risk-management 
concerns. For example, one could argue that, by delaying the onset of tightening, the FOMC 
unwisely courted the risk of inflation expectations becoming unmoored, and the fact that in the 
end they remained well anchored is in some ways beside the point: The cost to the long-run 
stability of the economy would have been considerable if they had reverted to the behavior of the 
1970s, although that cost has to be weighted by its probability of occurring. In this regard, 
history suggests that the odds of expectations becoming unmoored were extremely low as long as 
the FOMC did not delay too long—and after a relatively short delay, the FOMC did rapidly 
make up for lost time in a series of unusually large rate hikes.56 Moreover, other risk-
management concerns arguably worked in the opposite direction initially: In an environment in 
which the ELB can be expected to frequently constrain monetary policy, a lower for longer 
strategy is advisable coming out of a severe economic slump, as was the case in 2020. The 
highly unusual nature of the various shocks hitting the economy at the time also argued for a go-
 
55 A simple way to illustrate this differential sensitivity is to regress the annualized quarterly growth rate of ECI 
wages and salaries deflated by core PCE prices on a constant, two own lags, and the two-quarter moving average of 
the CBO measure of the unemployment gap. Using data from either 1982Q1 to 2019Q4 or from 1982Q1 to 2023Q4 
yields a negative coefficient on the unemployment gap equal to -0.17 with a standard error equal to 0.05, indicating 
that nominal ECI hourly wage growth tends to fall more than core PCE inflation in response to slack. 
56 Using data that starts in the early 1980s, simple regressions run using survey-based measures of long-run inflation 
expectations show that they respond only slowly to changes in actual inflation. Although similar regressions cannot 
be run for the 1960s and 1970s because of a lack of data, the results reported in Stock and Watson (2007) suggest 
that expectations were slow to adjust during this period as well based on their estimates of the time-varying unit-root 
component of trend inflation.

slow approach, at least until it was clear that the step-up in inflation was less transitory than 
originally thought. 
 
Finally, uncertainty about the monetary transmission mechanism is almost certainly greater than 
the range of results reported in this paper, and some other model might well predict that an 
earlier and more aggressive tightening on the part of the FOMC would have done more to keep 
inflation in check in recent years. Alternatively put, it may be that the model simulations 
understate the role of easy monetary policy in contributing to the recent surge in inflation. But 
taking the simulation results at face value, do they suggest that tighter FOMC policy would have 
resulted in better overall macroeconomic performance? Based on simple loss calculations, the 
likely effect of tighter policy on real wage rate, and risk-management considerations, the answer 
appears to be “no.”

Appendix. Additional information on model modifications and simulations 
 
This appendix documents the modifications to the standard FRB/US wage and price equations 
used to align the model’s Phillips curve with alternative specifications proposed in three recent 
studies; other modifications to the model’s equations; and the procedure used to sequentially 
simulate the model subject to a changing set of baselines consistent with the evolution of the 
median projections of real activity, inflation, and the federal funds rate reported in releases of the 
Survey of Primary Dealers from early 2021 through the end of 2023. 
 
Phillips curve modifications 
 
The simulation analysis uses four modified versions of the FRB/US model that incorporate 
different specifications of the wage and price equations. One of these versions is based on the 
model’s standard equations, whereas the other three use alternative specifications based on 
estimates of the Phillips curve reported in Bernanke and Blanchard (2023), Cecchetti and others 
(2023), and Gagnon and Collins (2019). The equation modifications used to incorporate the 
specifications of the latter three into FRB/US are described below. 
 
Bernanke and Blanchard (2023) 
 
This modified version of FRB/US uses an alternative specification for the ECI compensation 
equation; adds new equations for headline CPI inflation, expected CPI inflation over the next 
four quarters and the next 10 years; and uses bridge equations to link core CPI inflation and core 
PCE to the new main price variable, headline CPI inflation. The revised/added equations are as 
follows:

This modified version of FRB/US replaces the standard FRB/US equation for core PCE inflation

the relative price of nonpetroleum imported goods weighted by its expenditure share (model 
mnemonic RPIMGX); and 𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖 is the ISM manufacturing supplier deliveries index (model 
mnemonic ISM). In the model simulations, RPIMGX and ISM are assumed to be exogenous. 
 
In addition to revising the main core PCE price equation, this version also follows Cecchetti and 
others by modifying the coefficients of the standard FRB/US equation for 𝐸𝐸𝜋𝜋𝑡𝑡−1
𝐿𝐿𝐿𝐿 (PTR) in a way 
that makes expected long-run inflation somewhat less sensitive to movements in actual inflation. 
Also, bridge equations linking core CPI inflation to core PCE inflation and headline CPI 
inflation to core CPI inflation are added to this version of the model (as well as to the standard 
version) to ensure consistency of differences in CPI and PCE inflation predictions across the four 
specifications; these bridge equations are the mirror image of the ones added to the Gagnon-
Collins version:

Other model modifications 
 
Because the policy rule measures labor utilization using the rescaled ratio of vacancies to 
unemployment, all versions of the model are modified to include an equation that makes ZVU 
move one for one with the unemployment rate in simulations. In addition, because two of the 
Phillips curve specifications use the unadjusted ratio in place of the unemployment rate, all 
versions of the model include an equation that makes V/U move inversely with the 
unemployment rate as indicated by the inverted renormalization formula. As a result, a 1 
percentage point increase in the unemployment rate causes V/U to fall 0.146 in the simulations. 
 
Another modification concerns the equations for the term premiums embedded in 5-year, 10-
year, and 30-year Treasury yields. The standard specification of these equations is problematic 


Page | 38  
 
because it causes Treasury term premiums to be excessively sensitive to expected movements in 
future resource utilization, to a point that the model becomes unstable under some conditions; 
see Brayton and Reifschneider (2022) for a discussion of this problem. In some previous studies, 
such as Chung and others (2019), this instability problem is mitigated by exogenizing these term 
premiums. Here, an alternative approach is used in which the standard term premium equations 
are replaced by estimated ones that cause term premiums to respond to movements in current but 
not expected resource utilization. This modification somewhat reduces the sensitivity of real 
activity to changes in monetary policy in model simulations; it also better aligns the simulated 
behavior of the FRB/US term premium measures with the behavior of an alternative measure of 
term premiums, such as the ones generated by the Kim-Wright term structure model. The revised 
specifications of the Treasury bond yield equations also allow for the application of exogenous 
QE-related shocks to term premiums. 
 
Finally, bridge equations are added to the model that allow it to keep track of three separate sets 
of baseline data: (1) as denoted by the suffix FINAL, the paths of real activity, inflation, and the 
federal funds rate that match the currently published historical data with the extrapolated 
December 2023 SPD projections appended; (2) as denoted by the suffix RTIME, the paths of real 
activity, inflation, and the federal funds rate that match the extrapolated SPD projections made at 
different release dates between June 2021 and December 2023, with values along the path prior 
to the RTIME release data consistent with published data at the time; and (3) as denoted by no 
suffix, the series in the FRB/US database posted on the Federal Reserve website in late 
September 2023, which includes past and projected values for the much larger set of variables 
included in the model. These bridge equations ensure that the RTIME and FINAL values of the 
unemployment rate, V/U,  and core PCE and CPI inflation move one-for-one with the standard 
model variables in simulation. In the case of the federal funds rate, a bridge equation is used to 
make the standard variable for the federal funds rate (RFF) move one-for-one with movements in 
the inertial BA rule’s prescriptions for RFF_RTIME.57   
 
Simulation procedure using evolving SPD-consistent baselines 
 
As discussed in the main text, the simulations assume that financial market participants—and in 
some cases, other agents as well—are fully knowledgeable about the implications of changes in 
monetary policy for future economic conditions. In particular, in the simulations the expectations 
of such well-informed agents are assumed to be model consistent, in that their expectations 
revise relative to baseline in response to the counterfactual monetary policy as predicted by the 
full FRB/US model. However, these well-informed agents are not assumed to have had perfect 
foresight about the actual shocks to real activity and inflation that would hit the economy in the 
future, and that in turn would influence the simulated path of the federal funds rate under the 
rule-based strategy over time. Instead, in the baseline(s) financial market participants and other 
well-informed agents are more realistically assumed to revise their expectations for the future 
 
57 The arguments of the policy rule also use RTIME values for inflation, the unemployment rate, R*, and U* to 
ensure consistency with the SPD projections. The nonlinear nature of the Phillips curve proposed by Cecchetti and 
others and Gagnon and Collins requires a similar use of RTIME variables to ensure that the timing of any switching 
behavior in simulations is consistent with the SPD projections. The application of baseline tracking residuals to all 
equations means that RTIME variables are not needed for the linear FRB/US and Bernanke-Blanchard specifications

path of the shocks to real activity and inflation over time as they actually did, based on the 
evolution of the economic projections made by the primary dealers. To do this, the following 
multistep simulation procedure is employed: 
 
A. A sequence of baselines is first constructed for the federal funds rate, labor market 
conditions, and inflation. Each baseline corresponds a specific primary dealer survey 
released in the last month of each quarter from late 2019 to the present, in which the 
paths of the RTIME suffix variables in each baseline equal the published historical data 
up to the release date and the contemporaneous SPD-consistent projections thereafter. (In 
the baselines, model variables without suffixes, both endogenous and exogenous, equal 
their values in the currently posted FRB/US dataset.) Each of these evolving baselines 
includes a release-specific set of tracking residuals for all the equations in the model. 
 
B. A first simulation is run that begins in 2021Q1, the starting date of the counterfactual 
monetary policy. (The end date of all simulations is set far into the future to enable the 
calculation of model-consistent expectations.) In this simulation, the current and 
projected values of all endogenous variables and tracking residuals match those in the 
2021Q1 baseline, except that the tracking residuals on the policy rule are set to zero to 
ensure that the simulated path of the federal funds rate strictly follows the prescriptions of 
the inertial BA rule. In simulations that also incorporate a counterfactual path of asset 
purchases, the Treasury yield equations are additionally hit by exogenous QE-related 
shocks to the future path of their term premiums. After the simulation is completed, the 
2021Q1 values of the endogenous variables are overwritten with their simulated values in 
that quarter. 
 
C. Next, the starting date of the simulation is advanced to 2021Q2 and the current and 
projected tracking residuals are updated to match those in the 2021Q2 baseline. Once 
again, the model is simulated with the tracking residuals on the policy rule set to zero 
and, if appropriate, the Treasury yield equations subject to the same set of shocks to the 
path of their term premiums. Once the simulation is complete, the 2021Q2 values of the 
endogenous variables are overwritten with their simulated values in that quarter. 
 
D. This sequential simulation procedure continues through 2023Q4, the release date of the 
most recently released end-of-quarter SPD projections. 
 
If this sequential procedure is run without zeroing out the policy rule tracking residuals and 
without applying the term premium shocks, the past and projected FINAL paths of the federal 
funds rate, labor market conditions, and inflation in the last simulation exactly match those in the 
December 2023 SPD release.

WORKING PAPER
24-11 An Analysis of  Pandemic-Era 
Inflation in 11 Economies 
Ben Bernanke and Olivier Blanchard
May 2024
ABSTRACT
We recently proposed a simple model of the inflation process, estimated it on 
post-1990 US data, and used the results to identify the shocks and transmission 
mechanisms that have determined US inflation since 2019 (Bernanke and 
Blanchard 2023, hereafter BB). Ten central banks expressed interest in using our 
model to study the recent inflation in their own economies, and we agreed to do 
a joint project. This paper summarizes and discusses in broad terms the results 
of the project, leaving details to papers and reports produced by staff at the 
cooperating central banks.
The BB model was intended to capture the joint dynamics of consumer prices, 
wages, and short- and long-run inflation expectations, conditional on the shocks 
to inflation (from energy prices, food prices, and sectoral shortages) and on the 
degree of tightness in the labor market. Our conclusions were that the pandemic-
era inflation in the United States was initially the result of a series of adverse 
relative price shocks and sectoral shortages, each of which had a strong but 
largely transient effect on inflation. The labor market had little effect on inflation 
early on, but increased tightness eventually produced limited but sustained 
pressure on inflation. As the effects of relative price shocks and shortages 
stabilized or reversed, inflation declined, and the role of labor market tightness 
became increasingly important, suggesting that some slowing of activity might be 
necessary to get US inflation all the way back to target.
In some cases, the application of the BB model by the country teams required 
modifications, reflecting factors such as data availability and institutional 
differences. With that caveat, estimation and simulation of the model for each 
of the ten economies has produced results broadly similar to our findings for 
the United States: Relative price shocks and sectoral shortages drove the initial 
surge in inflation, but as these effects have reversed, tight labor markets in most 
(although not all) countries have become a relatively more important factor. 
Despite the broad similarities to the US story, the details—for example, the relative

importance of energy shocks, price shocks, and shortages in driving inflation—

estimated effect of labor market pressure on wage inflation and thus on price 
inflation.
Differences across countries have implications for the costs of returning inflation 
to target from current levels (the “last mile”). Most countries saw labor markets 
tighten over the period. Those that did not and those where the effects of labor 
market tightness on wages have been weak may achieve their inflation targets 
without an increase in unemployment. However, some countries may need some 
loosening of labor market conditions to achieve their inflation targets.
Overall, the episode stands in sharp contrast to the persistent effects of relative 
price shocks in the 1970s. The more transient effects of price shocks this 
time around are traced in large part in the model to more anchored inflation 
expectations and to limited catch-up of real wages. The first is likely due to 
higher credibility of monetary policy; the second is likely due, in good part, to the 
disappearance of wage indexation.
A side effect of the project was to demonstrate the benefits of central bank 
cooperation and of looking at inflation through similar lenses and learning from 
each other. Several central banks have adopted the BB model as part of their 
forecasting framework.

INTRODUCTION 
As inflation came and (so far only partly) went, many explanations have been 
offered for the pandemic-era surge in prices. Some point to strong aggregate 
demand, supported by the buying power of pent-up savings accumulated 
during lockdowns, expansionary fiscal policy (especially in the United States), 
accommodative monetary policies, and, as the pandemic waned, a global 
recovery that came earlier and was stronger than many expected. Others 
emphasize supply-side factors, including sharp increases in the prices of key 
commodities (notably energy and food), disruptions of global supply chains, 
reductions in labor supply (e.g., due to early retirements and declines in 
participation rates), and instances of “greed” (i.e., opportunistic increases in 
margins by some firms in the inflationary environment). 
Beyond the sources of the inflation, much discussion has also focused on 
transmission mechanisms, that is, on the channels by which the shocks hitting the 
economy affected inflation. Consider the sharp rise in energy prices, for example. 
Increases in prices for energy products, such as gasoline, directly affect inflation, 
of course. But higher energy prices have indirect effects as well, for example, 
by increasing costs of production of non-energy goods and services or by 
motivating workers to press for compensation for unexpected past losses in their 
purchasing power. Indirect effects may also operate through short- and long-
run inflation expectations. For example, higher gas prices may lead people and 
firms to increase their short-run inflation expectations, raising wage and price 
pressures. If expectations are not well anchored, these dynamics can lead to the 
possible emergence of wage-price or price-wage spirals.
Since the inflation began, disagreements over its sources and transmission 
mechanisms have led to conflicting conclusions and policy implications. At the 
start, two “teams” emerged. Following the early view of Federal Reserve officials 
that the inflation would be transitory, economists belonging to “Team Transitory” 
argued that the increase in inflation was due mostly to supply factors that were 
likely to reverse relatively quickly. Standard central banking doctrine holds that, 
so long as inflation expectations are reasonably well anchored, there is a case 
for “looking through” temporary supply shocks rather than responding to the 
short-run increase in inflation. A smaller group, “Team Permanent,” held that, to 
the contrary, exceptionally strong demand, arising from large fiscal programs and 
other factors, would put sustained upward pressure on inflation.1 
Today, with inflation well off its peak but still higher in most countries than 
central bank targets, the focus of the discussion has turned to the problem of the 
“last mile,” that is, what it will take and what it will cost to get inflation durably 
back to central bank targets. One point of view is that many countries are already 
there or soon will be, and the fight against inflation has largely been won. An 
opposing view is that the decrease in inflation to date has been due mostly to 
the reversal of supply shocks, a process that is now running its course, and that 
the desired further reduction in inflation may require further substantial cooling 
of the labor market and an increase in unemployment. Deciding who is (and was) 
right in these debates requires a close empirical analysis of the sources of recent 
global inflation and disinflation.

In an earlier paper (Bernanke and Blanchard, June 2023, BB in what follows), 
we developed a small model to assess empirically the relative roles of the various 
shocks and transmission mechanisms in driving inflation, and we fit it to US data. 
A number of central banks around the world found our approach attractive 
and decided to apply our model to their own economies. To benefit from each 
other’s insights, we and the central bank teams agreed to a joint project to 
investigate the applicability of the BB model to other economies. The teams 
worked both independently and in collaboration over the second half of 2023, 
using national data that in most cases ran through 2023Q2. The ten non-US 
central banks participating in the project were the European Central Bank (ECB), 
the Bank of England, the Bank of Japan, the Bank of France, the Bundesbank, 
the Bank of Spain, the Bank of Italy, the National Bank of Belgium, the Bank of 
the Netherlands, and the Bank of Canada (note that the project included both 
the ECB as well as several national central banks within the Eurosystem). The 
US Federal Reserve engaged with the project as an observer, but the US results 
come from an updated version of our work in BB. The two of us coordinated the 
project and consolidated and compared the results. This paper is a cross-country 
summary that presents the main conclusions of the studies by these ten central 
banks and our own work for the United States, focusing on commonalities and 
differences across economies. 
Generally speaking, we find that the commonalities dominate the differences. 
Consistent with the original BB findings for the United States, there is wide 
agreement among the teams that the pandemic-era burst of global inflation 
was due primarily to a succession of adverse shocks to prices—notably global 
increases in energy and food prices and supply disruptions in key sectors. As of 
this writing (March 2024), these shocks have receded substantially, accounting 
for most of the global cooling of inflation. The prominence of shocks to prices 
does not preclude a role for labor markets, however: Also consistent with the 
BB results, in many, although not all, countries, postpandemic labor markets 
became quite tight, presumably reflecting strong aggregate demand together 
with constraints on labor supply. Tight labor markets in turn contributed to 
wage inflation, and consequently to price inflation. Importantly, although the 
inflationary effects of tight labor markets were initially much smaller than the 
effects of shocks to prices, they were more persistent. Thus, as the shocks to 
prices faded or reversed, wage inflation has become the larger factor behind the 
remaining price inflation, which may make further reductions in inflation more 
difficult to achieve. The inflation story is not complete as of this writing, however, 
and the ultimate outcomes remain to be seen. 
The paper is organized as follows. Section 1 presents an overview of the basic 
BB model. Section 2 presents the main findings from the cross-country work 
applying that model. Section 3 concludes and suggests directions for further 
research. An appendix presents the BB model in more detail, as well as detailed 
estimation results for each country. This paper is of necessity only a summary, 
which hits some highlights but cannot cover all the detailed findings of the 
country teams. More extended discussions of the country results are available in 
papers written by the individual teams; the list of available country-level papers, 
with links, is given in the bibliography.

1. THE BASIC MODEL 
In specifying the model used in this project, we made the following choices. 
We chose to base our analysis on a simple model, plausibly but not explicitly 
based on microeconomic foundations. We believed that a simpler model could 
provide useful insights into the sources of inflation and on policy debates without 
sacrificing transparency or ease of replication.2 Other analyses have taken more 
formal, structured approaches (see, for example, Baqaee and Farhi 2022). We 
see room for both research strategies, as a portfolio of approaches provides the 
best test of the robustness of the results. In this instance, it appears that most 
research has led to largely similar conclusions.
We decided to focus on four endogenous variables: price inflation, wage 
inflation, long-run and short-run inflation expectations. Given the discussions on 
the potential strength of wage-price or price-wage interactions, we believed it 
was important to look at wage and price evolutions separately. Other work has 
focused directly on price inflation, or used a different decomposition than ours, 
for example, separating headline inflation between median inflation and the 
deviation of headline from median inflation (Ball, Leigh, and Mishra 2022; Dao, 
Gourinchas, Leigh, and Mishra 2024) or breaking down inflation into services and 
goods components (di Giovanni et al. 2023).
We proceeded in two steps, first writing down and solving a simple analytical 
model, and then estimating an empirical counterpart of the model, based on the 
same analytical structure but with more generous dynamics. Figure 1 shows the 
structure of the empirical model, inclusive of lags. The model has four equations, 
corresponding to the four endogenous variables; the precise equations in the 
analytical and empirical versions of the model are given in the appendix. 
What follows is an informal description of the model and its basic 
implications, as well as of its adaptation for this multicountry project.3 We begin 
with the equation describing the behavior of nominal wages, then turn to the 
equations for consumer prices, long-run inflation expectations, and short-run 
inflation expectations. 
The Wage Equation
In the analytical model, we specified wage inflation as depending on labor market 
tightness, expected short-run inflation, and a catch-up variable. The first two terms 
are standard and need no explanation. The third term, which is typically missing 
from wage Phillips curve specifications but should not, reflects the fact that to the 
extent that past unexpected inflation has led to a decrease in workers’ real wages, 
they may try to “catch up” by pushing for higher nominal wages, all else equal.4 
Note that, in contrast to expected inflation, which is forward-looking, the catch-up 
variable is backward-looking. Thus, the specification allows both past unexpected 
price inflation and future expected price inflation to affect wage inflation.
2	
Large-scale models typically used by central banks have a significant advantage in terms 
of comprehensiveness. But central banks have a responsibility to explain their analyses and 
forecasts to the public, especially during a crisis, and an additional advantage of simple models 
is that they provide a narrative that aids in the banks’ communication.
3	
For a more extended discussion of the assumptions and the implications of the model, see BB.

This is also sometimes referred to as real wage rigidity. Its role in the inflation of the 1970s was 
examined by, among others, Bruno and Sachs (1985). 


6 
WP 24-11  |  MAY 2024
In the empirical counterpart of the model, we allowed for a richer lag structure, 
with wage inflation depending on its own lagged values and lagged values of the 
other determinants (see figure 1). As a measure of labor market tightness, in BB we 
used the ratio of vacancies (job openings) to the number of unemployed persons. 
The argument for using this ratio rather than the unemployment rate alone (as 
in the traditional wage Phillips curve) is that, relative to the unemployment rate, 
this ratio arguably better reflects conditions on both the demand (vacancies) and 
supply (unemployed persons) sides of the labor market.5 We leave a discussion 
of the relation between the unemployment rate and the vacancy-unemployment 
ratio to section 3, but, as we shall see, this relation matters in thinking about what 
increase in the unemployment rate may be needed to return inflation to target. 
As a measure of catch-up, we used the sum over the previous four quarters of 
unexpected inflation (the difference between realized inflation in each quarter 
and the rate of inflation that had been expected). To measure short-run inflation 
expectations, we used, alternatively, one-year inflation expectations as constructed 
by the Federal Reserve Bank of Cleveland or one-year inflation forecasts from the 
Survey of Professional Forecasters. 
We added a trend productivity growth variable, defined as an eight-quarter 
moving average of productivity growth, with productivity measured as the ratio 
of nonfarm business value added to nonfarm employee hours. As the second 
5	
Two labor markets with the same unemployment rates but low or high vacancies obviously 
have very different implications for wage evolutions. The vacancy-unemployment ratio, unlike 
the unemployment rate, is a good indicator of labor market tightness when there are shifts in 
the relation between vacancies and unemployment (the Beveridge curve). We discuss the role 
of Beveridge curve shifts in the conclusion.

and third quarters of 2020 (the onset of the pandemic) were associated with an 
exceptional increase in US unemployment and only a moderate downward effect 
on wage growth, presumably due to a combination of strong fiscal support and 
worker resistance to nominal wage cuts (a de facto zero lower bound on nominal 
wage changes), we allowed for quarterly dummies for 2020Q2 and 2020Q3 
as a simple way of capturing the unusual episode and avoiding contaminating 
other coefficients. Our results were not substantially affected by the inclusion of 
those two dummies.
The Price Equation
In the analytical model, we specified price inflation as simply depending on 
wage inflation and generic price shocks, that is, factors leading to increases in 
prices given wages. 
In the empirical counterpart, we allowed for a richer lag structure, again 
allowing for both lagged values of the dependent variable and current and 
lagged values of the other determinants. We introduced three variables to 
capture price shocks: the relative price of energy (relative to wages), the relative 
price of food, and a measure of sectoral shortages. What has been specific to 
this inflation episode has been the large supply disruptions and the associated 
price spikes in certain sectors, potentially leading in some cases to a price far 
above the usual marginal cost.6 Several proxies for shortages are available. In 
BB we used the number of Google searches for the term “shortage” as a proxy 
for supply disruptions, but alternative measures lead to similar conclusions.7 
We included the productivity growth variable in the price equation, as higher 
productivity reduces unit costs, all else equal.
The Equation for Long-Run Inflation Expectations 
In the analytical model, we specified long-run inflation expectations as depending 
on themselves lagged and on lagged inflation. One can think of the coefficient 
on inflation as reflecting the degree of anchoring of long-run expectations. 
A coefficient of zero would imply complete anchoring of long-run inflation 
expectations (that is, long-run expectations would not depend on inflation).
In the empirical counterpart, we included the same variables but with a 
richer lag structure, thereby allowing unanchoring effects to work with a lag. We 
measured long-run inflation expectations alternately by the Cleveland Fed’s ten-
year inflation expectations measure or the Survey of Professional Forecasters’ 
forecast of inflation over the subsequent ten years.
The Equation for Short-Run Inflation Expectations 
In the analytical model, we specified short-run inflation expectations as 
depending on themselves lagged, on current long-run expectations, and on 
6	
Shortages can lead to an increase in profit if firms, which are suddenly constrained, face 
a demand function with a short-run elasticity less than one. We suspect that much of the 
increase in profits in some sectors has come from such a mechanism, rather than from greed, 
i.e., from an increase in margins by monopolistic firms using the noisier environment as cover. 
7	
For example, the New York Fed’s supply chain index gave results largely similar to ours. Lewis 
Alexander (personal communication) finds good results by applying a large language model to 
the Fed’s Beige Books to identify periods of shortages.

WP 24-11  |  MAY 2024
lagged inflation. As in the other equations, in the empirical counterpart we 
allowed for a richer lag structure. 
Homogeneity, Subsample Stability, and Identification
In BB we estimated the model for the United States using quarterly data for the 
period 1990Q1 to 2023Q2. In the empirical version of the model we allowed for 
four lags for all variables included in each equation. The lag structures were left 
free except for homogeneity restrictions, which imply there is no long-run tradeoff 
between the labor market measure and inflation (a vertical long-run Phillips 
curve). As a result, for given values of the exogenous variables, the estimated 
model delivers a unique “natural” vacancy-unemployment ratio, analogous to 
the natural unemployment rate in traditional specifications. In most cases the 
homogeneity restrictions had little effect on the estimates. We used whole-
sample estimates to compute impulse responses and historical decompositions 
of inflation (see below), but we also estimated the model using data from 1990Q1 
to 2019Q4 to check for subsample stability. In the US data and for most other 
countries there was little evidence of major changes in the coefficients post-2019.8 
Finally, identification was achieved through restrictions on contemporaneous 
coefficients (as in a structural VAR), notably the assumption that wage inflation 
does not react to contemporaneous movements in its determinants. 
Extension to the Other Economies
In extending the model to other economies, to facilitate comparisons the country 
teams tried to stay as close as possible to the model as laid out in the BB paper. 
However, data availability and other factors led in some cases to estimation on 
a shorter sample, or the use of an alternative observable variable. For example, 
some teams used the Federal Reserve of New York supply chain index or a 
composite of several supply disruption measures, rather than the Google trends 
variable. As we shall discuss, in most cases the general specification fits the 
country data reasonably well and delivered clear conclusions. Some teams also 
explored alternatives to the basic specification, motivated by cross-country 
differences in institutions and pandemic-era policies. For example, some teams 
explored the role of the fiscal measures used to limit energy price increases 
in their countries. The Japanese team emphasized the unique nature of their 
country’s labor market, using a specification that allowed for different behavior 
of wages for part-time contract workers and full-time workers. Some teams 
explored the role of import prices, as most of the economies in the project are 
smaller and more open than the United States. The reader is referred to the 
country-specific papers for more details. 
One important caveat is needed before moving on to the results. Because we 
decided to treat several variables in our model as unexplained, the model does 
not provide a full general equilibrium account of the origins of the inflation. As 
noted above, we took the relative price of energy, the relative price of food, the 
8	
The results of homogeneity and subsample stability tests are given in the appendix for each 
equation and each country. One note: Subsample stability of the price equation is strongly 
rejected in most countries. The origin of the rejection, however, is not a substantive change in 
coefficients but a larger standard deviation of residuals in the post-2019 sample.

WP 24-11  |  MAY 2024
measure of shortages, productivity growth, and the degree of labor market slack 
as given. Clearly, a more ambitious project would be to trace these variables 
back to their primitive determinants, including the role of fiscal and monetary 
policies, the intensity of the global pandemic, and Russia’s war on Ukraine. For 
example, fiscal policies (especially in the United States) that increased aggregate 
demand may not only have tightened labor markets but also put upward 
pressure on global food and energy prices, allowed for a stronger passthrough 
of sectoral price shocks to price inflation, and (by increasing consumer demand 
for goods) worsened sectoral shortages. A different view might hold that 
the economic effects of COVID (together with government responses to the 
pandemic) and Russia’s war on Ukraine were the more important sources of the 
rise in commodity prices and (because of the disruption of supply chains) of the 
shortages of many goods, notably durable goods. Our model cannot settle these 
issues, which we leave to future research.9 
Basic Implications: Shocks and Transmission Mechanisms
Although parsimonious, the four relations of the analytical model capture the key 
shocks and transmission mechanisms identified and discussed in the literature. 
Repeating an analysis presented in BB, we can summarize the main implications 
of the analytical model through two impulse response functions,10 to which 
we shall compare the impulse response functions implied by the estimated 
country models later. 
Figure 2 shows the model-predicted effects on inflation of a generic 
adverse price shock—for example, a permanent increase in the relative price of 
energy, or equivalently, a one-time increase in the growth rate of the relative 
price of energy. 
The figure’s two lines correspond to alternative (hypothetical) choices of 
parameters. The direct, immediate effect of the energy price shock on inflation 
is normalized to be the same in both cases. The dynamic effects of the price 
shock on inflation differ in the two scenarios, however, with the difference 
reflecting five factors. 
First, the effect of the energy price shock (or any shock to prices) on inflation 
depends not only on its direct impact on consumer prices (e.g., the price of 
energy goods such as gasoline) but also on its effect on nonenergy goods and 
services, reflecting the fact that energy is an important input to production. 
Second, the initial inflation shock caused by higher energy prices affects 
inflation expectations, which, third, affects nominal wage demands. Fourth, to 
the extent that the inflation shock was unanticipated, wage inflation may be 
further increased, as workers try to recoup previous losses in their purchasing 
power (“catch-up”). Fifth, wage inflation raises production costs, feeding back to 
price inflation. 
9	
As discussed in BB, if one assumes that the price of specific commodities is the result of a 
largely common demand factor and largely idiosyncratic supply shifts, the fact that the first 
common component of a large set of commodity prices went up substantially from 2020Q1 to 
2022Q2 suggests the relevance of aggregate demand. 
10	
See BB for further details on the construction of figures 2 and 3. 


10 
WP 24-11  |  MAY 2024
The overall dynamic effect of an energy price shock on inflation depends 
on the strengths of each of these five effects. If the effects are relatively weak, 
then the dynamic effects will be weaker and shorter, as captured by the lower 
line (“weak feedback”) in figure 2. Symmetrically, the stronger these effects, the 
larger and more persistent will be the dynamic impact of the energy price shock 
on inflation, as captured in the upper line (“strong feedback”) in the figure. As we 
shall show below, in all countries the empirical evidence is much more consistent 
with the story told by the lower line in figure 2 than by the upper line. That is, 
in the recent episode, energy price shocks and other supply shocks had large 
contemporaneous effects on inflation but, because the channels described above 
were weak, these effects tended to reverse relatively quickly, barring new shocks. 
To draw an important contrast, figure 3 shows the dynamic effect on inflation 
of a permanent increase in labor market tightness, to a level above its long-run 
sustainable (“natural”) value. As in figure 2, we compare results for two sets of 
hypothetical model parameters. 
Four factors determine the size and persistence of the inflationary effect of 
a tight labor market. First, labor market tightness has a direct effect on wage 
inflation, via the wage Phillips curve. Second, the effect on consumer price 
inflation depends on the speed with which wages pass through to prices. Third, 
the induced inflation affects inflation expectations. Fourth, higher expected 
inflation affects wage inflation, and in turn price inflation. 
 As in the case of a shock to prices, if these transmission effects are relatively 
weak, the dynamic effects of tight labor markets on inflation will be smaller 
(the lower line in figure 3), and if they are strong the effects will be larger (the 
upper line). As we shall see below, the empirical evidence is that the response 
of inflation to a tighter labor market looks much more like the lower line in the

figure. That is, the initial build-up is limited and thereafter inflation increases 
slowly over time. An important distinction between figures 2 and 3 is evident: The 
effects of price shocks on inflation tend to be transitory while the effects of an 
overheated labor market are more persistent.11
2. THE CROSS-COUNTRY EVIDENCE 
As the impulse response functions illustrate, in an economy in which there are 
both large price shocks (e.g., shocks to energy or food prices) with limited 
dynamic effects and an increasingly tight labor market, our model predicts that 
quarter-to-quarter inflation will be dominated early on by the price shocks. 
However, behind the scenes, the overheated labor market will be leading to slowly 
increasing and persistent wage inflation. Thus, the contribution of tight labor 
conditions to inflation, small in the short run, becomes more important as price 
shocks die away. This pattern, which BB found for the United States, appears to 
characterize most of the other economies studied in this project as well. 
Wage Inflation, Price Inflation, and the Labor Market 
Before showing results based on the estimated models, it is useful to start with 
two figures showing some raw facts. 
Figure 4 shows the evolution of wage inflation (in light blue) and price 
11	
Indeed, as the model has the property that there is a natural vacancy-unemployment ratio, any 
permanent increase in this ratio implies steadily increasing inflation. In a full general equilibrium 
model, this inflation would eventually be brought under control through appropriate policies, 
leading the ratio to go back to its natural value.

inflation (in dark blue) for each economy included in the project, starting in 
2019Q1. The two series show quarterly rates of change, annualized.12 
For all countries, the price series is the local measure of consumer price 
inflation (the Harmonized Index of Consumer Prices for euro members). The 
wage series is that used in estimation in each country. For reasons of both data 
availability and institutional differences, the wage measures used in estimation 
differed somewhat across countries, including for example compensation per 
employee, compensation per hour, and new wage settlements, with nonwage 
benefits included in some cases but not in others. Because of the large shocks 
to hours per employee due to COVID and the different treatments of partial 
employment across countries, alternative wage measures in a given country were 
sometimes quite different and the teams had to decide which one to use in their 
baseline estimations; details and results using alternative wage series are given 
in the respective country papers. For the purposes of the comparison in figure 4, 
the differences are relatively unimportant, and the key conclusion would be the 
same if we plotted other measures of wages.
Figure 4 has two key messages: First, across countries, price inflation in 
recent years has been much more volatile than wage inflation. Second, wage 
inflation has been comparatively smooth, while showing in most although not 
in all countries some increase over time. By the end of our sample, 2023Q2, 
in nearly all countries the decrease in price inflation and the slow increase in 
wage inflation were such that wage inflation exceeded price inflation, implying 
rising real wages. These observations are consistent with the characterization of 
inflation being driven in the short run by volatile price shocks and in the longer 
run by a slow but persistent increase in wage inflation. 
In the BB model, wage inflation is driven by the tightness of the labor market, 
as well as inflation expectations. For context, figure 5 shows the evolution, also 
starting in 2019Q1, of each economy’s measure of tightness of the labor market, 
which, in most cases, is the ratio of measured vacancies to unemployed persons. 
(In some countries, because of data limitations, the variable is defined slightly 
differently but captures the same concept.) In countries for which available 
data allow the construction of vacancy-unemployment ratios, there are some 
surprisingly large differences in average values of the ratio over the sample. 
Presumably, these differences reflect in large part differences in data definitions 
and coverage, particularly of vacancies.13 Given our focus on the dynamic 
behavior of this ratio, these level differences are less important, and, for clarity, 
figure 5 shows vacancy-unemployment ratios normalized to one in 2019Q4. 
Once again, the data tell a clear and common story. After a sharp drop at the 
beginning of the pandemic, the vacancy-unemployment ratio steadily increased 
in most economies. Indeed, in all countries except Japan, Germany, and Belgium, 
the ratio was higher in 2023Q2 than it was in 2019Q4, suggesting that in most 
countries the labor market was substantially tighter at the end of our sample 
than immediately before the pandemic. For the unemployment rate, the more

We report (annualized) quarter-to-quarter movements because the estimations are done using 
quarterly data. Note, though, that the quarterly data are noticeably more volatile than the more 
familiar and more frequently reported annual or four-quarter changes.

Understanding level differences between vacancy measures across countries should be high 
on the research agenda.

conventional measure of labor market tightness, the picture (not shown here) is 
largely the same, with the unemployment rate lower in 2023Q2 than in 2019Q4 
in all but two countries (Japan and Belgium). This suggests that there is more to 
the inflation story than just price shocks and suggests the potential relevance of 
the labor market for the recent inflation. 
Impulse response functions 
Rather than reporting the detailed estimates for each country, the better way 
to summarize the estimation results for each is to show the impulse response 
functions implied by those estimates. The estimated impulse response functions 
can then be compared with those derived from the analytical model earlier. Note 
that the impulse response functions shown below are system outcomes of the 
estimated models, that is, they use all the estimated equations simultaneously in 
solving for dynamic responses. 
Figure 6 shows the dynamic effects (impulse response functions) on inflation 
of a one-time permanent increase in the relative price of energy (dark blue), in 
the relative price of food (light blue), and in the measure of shortages (yellow), 
using the empirically estimated parameters and data choices for each country.14 
The initial increases in each of the price shocks are chosen to equal a one-
standard-deviation change in each of the three variables, computed over the 
post-2019Q4 sample. 
The shapes of the estimated responses are very similar across countries, 
with the sharp initial effects of price shocks subsiding quickly. This pattern is 
qualitatively similar to that shown by the weak feedback case in figure 2. The 
limited dynamic effects of price shocks in most countries reflect all five factors 
described earlier (see also estimation results in the appendix). 
First, weak price-price effects: In most cases, the estimated effect of shocks 
to the prices of energy or food, taking into account the lags, is only slightly larger 
than the share of energy or food prices in the overall consumer price index, 
implying small second-round effects on other (non-energy, non-food) prices. 
Second, dynamic effects are limited by well-anchored inflation expectations, 
with relatively small and slow effects of inflation on both short-run and 
(especially) long-run inflation expectations. 
Third, the “catch-up” effect, the tendency of workers to press for 
compensation for earlier unexpected price increases, appears limited in practice, 
with the estimated coefficient on the catch-up variable in the wage equation 
close to zero in most countries.15 
Fourth, wage inflation appears to adjust slowly to increases in 
inflation expectations. 
Fifth, empirically, wage inflation feeds into price inflation relatively slowly in 
most countries. 
In combination, these factors explain the absence of a price-wage spiral in 
the economies studied in this project, a sharp difference from, for example, the

inflation of the 1970s, when (presumably) inflation expectations were poorly 
anchored and wage indexation automatically increased the importance of 
catch-up effects.16 
Similarly, we can use the country estimates to examine the response 
of inflation to a hot labor market. Figure 7 shows the dynamic effects of a 
permanent increase in labor market tightness, again using the empirically 
estimated parameters for each economy. In the simulations, the increase in 
tightness is assumed to be equal to a one-standard-deviation increase in the 
vacancy-unemployment ratio over the post-2019Q4 sample. 
Recall that the analytical model (figure 3) predicts that a tightening of the 
labor market leads to an initial increase in inflation, with inflation continuing to 
increase over time as dynamic effects come into play. For most economies in the 
project, the empirical impulse responses roughly fit the theoretically predicted 
pattern, but two characteristics of the empirical responses are worth noting. 
First, the initial responses of inflation are often jagged, and second, they are 
small in many cases. The jagged initial responses can be interpreted as reflecting 
the fact that both the level and the rate of change of the measure of labor market 
tightness affect wage inflation.17 The small initial response reflects the small sum 
of coefficients on the labor market variable in the wage equation, that is, in many 
countries the wage Phillips curve appears to be relatively flat.18 For example, after 
four quarters (to look beyond the initial jagged pattern), the estimated effect of a 
one-standard-deviation increase in the vacancy-unemployment ratio on inflation 
varies from from 0.0 percent for Japan to 1.0 percent for the United States19 
The amplification mechanisms, which determine how fast inflation increases 
after the initial effects of the tightening of the labor market, are also empirically 
weak in most countries, so that inflation increases only slowly following a labor 
market tightening. Again, the amplification mechanisms can be enumerated (also 
see estimation results in the appendix): 
First, empirically, expected inflation adjusts slowly to actual inflation, implying 
that inflation expectations remain largely anchored. Second, wage inflation 
adjusts only slowly to the increases in inflation expectations that occur. Third, 
there is again little or no evidence of the catch-up phenomenon. Fourth, wage 
inflation appears, empirically, to pass through only slowly to price inflation. 
So, while the model is constructed so that it has a natural rate property (in 
this case, for the vacancy-unemployment ratio), which implies that a vacancy-
unemployment ratio that remains above its natural rate leads to ever increasing 
inflation, empirically, in many economies, the implied increase in inflation is very 
16	
For evidence along these lines, see Blanchard and Riggi (2013). 
17	
This is not specific to the use of the vacancy-unemployment ratio as the labor market 
variable. The same is true if one uses the unemployment rate. Traditional wage Phillips 
curve specifications often find an effect of not just the level but also the change in the 
unemployment rate on wage inflation. 
18	
Estimation results suggest that the effect of labor market tightness on wage inflation is small 
but statistically significant; in 7 of the 11 economies, the sum of coefficients on the labor market 
variable in the wage regression is significant at the 5 percent level, and there is no evidence of 
a change in this sum during the pandemic, that is, after 2019Q4.
19	
A one-standard-deviation increase in the vacancy-unemployment ratio is 0.26 for the United 
States. Based on the estimated coefficient of the vacancy-unemployment ratio in a regression 
of the unemployment rate on the vacancy-unemployment ratio over the 1990Q1 to 2019Q4 
sample, −4.0, this implies a one-standard-deviation decrease in the unemployment rate of 
about 1 percentage point.

slow. Indeed, the estimated parameters for the euro area imply that a steady 
increase in inflation to a tight labor market is not visible even after four years, 
although beyond this horizon (and not shown in the figure) simulated inflation 
increases steadily but slowly when labor markets remain tight. 
In short, small direct and indirect effects of labor market tightness imply an 
impulse response function similar to the weak feedback case shown in figure 3, 
that is, a relatively small and slow increase in wage inflation, implying a small and 
slow increase in the price inflation induced by wage increases. 
Historical Decompositions 
Estimation and (system) simulations of the model allow us to decompose 
inflation in each quarter and for each country into components due to each of 
the exogenous variables and the equation residuals, with dynamic effects of 
exogenous shocks taken fully into account. Obtaining these decompositions for 
each of the eleven economies (figure 8) is the main contribution of this research 
project, as the decompositions both explain the sources of inflation in each 
country and provide a basis for policy recommendations.
The way to read figure 8 is as follows: 
In each diagram, the solid black line shows actual (quarter on quarter, 
annualized) inflation. The different color bars show the contributions of various 
factors to inflation in each quarter, with bars extending below the x-axis 
corresponding to negative contributions. The contributions of the equation 
residuals are not shown, as they would be hard to interpret; if they were included, 
the estimated components of inflation would sum exactly to actual inflation.
The dark grey bars reflect the role of initial conditions, that is, what the model 
predicts would have happened if there had been no shocks from 2020Q1 on. 
Specifically, the component of inflation shown by the dark grey bar is what would 
have been expected if the relative prices of energy and food had remained the 
same as they were in 2019Q4, the measure of sectoral shortages had remained 
equal to its average value pre-COVID, productivity growth had not changed from 
its average value pre-COVID, and the vacancy-unemployment had remained 
equal to its value in 2019Q4. 
Because the four equations of the model determine together a unique 
value of the vacancy-unemployment ratio consistent with constant inflation 
(absent shocks), the evolution of the dark grey bars in figure 8 tells us, for each 
country, where (according to the model) that ratio was relative to its natural 
rate before COVID struck. In most cases, the heights of the dark grey bars are 
nearly constant over time, implying that the vacancy-unemployment ratio for the 
economy in question was close to its natural level before the pandemic.20 The 
main exception is the United Kingdom, where the effect on inflation of the initial 
conditions increases, suggesting that the UK economy was already overheating 
to some degree in 2019Q4. The United States and Canada show some small 
increase in inflation in the no-shock baseline.
20	 The usual warning about the precision of these conclusions applies here and below. The 
implicit assumption is that the estimated equations remained stable throughout the estimation 
period. Small missing trends in any of the equations, for example, might well lead to a 
different estimate of the implicit natural ratio in 2019Q4, and thus a different evolution of the 
contribution of initial conditions.

The other bars in the diagrams reflect the effects on inflation over time of 
shocks to the various exogenous variables. Again, the bars, being based on 
system impulse response functions, reflect both the direct and indirect effects 
of each of these variables on inflation over time. The dark blue bars represent 
both the direct and indirect effects of the rate of change of the relative price of 
energy on inflation; the light blue bars represent the effects of the relative price 
of food; the yellow bars capture the effects of shortages (measured as deviations 
from the pre-COVID sample mean); the green bars represent the effects of 
productivity growth (also as a deviation from its pre-COVID sample mean); and 
the red bars show the effects on inflation of labor market conditions, measured 
as the deviation of the vacancy-unemployment ratio from its 2019Q4 value. When 
the wage equation includes dummy variables for 2020Q2 and 2020Q3, their 
effects are also reported in the decomposition. 
As the black line in each graph shows the actual path of the country’s 
inflation rate, the differences between the vertical sums of the bars (some of 
them negative) and the black lines reflect the combined direct and indirect 
effects of the four equation residuals. As can be seen, that difference is typically 
small, reflecting a good fit of the estimated equations and thus a reasonably 
comprehensive accounting of the sources of inflation in each economy.

Commonalities 
Our main conclusions are that (i) with some adjustments for institutional and 
policy differences, the basic model works reasonably well for all economies 
and (ii) estimation of the model produces surprisingly similar decompositions 
across economies. In particular, in each of the participating economies, the 
model implies that the inflation dynamics of recent years have been dominated 
by repeated price shocks—most importantly, energy price shocks. Energy prices 
typically contributed negatively to inflation in 2020, very positively in 2021 and 
most of 2022, and negatively thereafter. Interestingly, food price shocks have 
had a different pattern: their contributions to inflation were small until 2022, then 
consistently positive in 2022 and even more so in 2023. 
One might have expected that supply disruptions and shortages would play 
an important role during the acute COVID phase, with less effect thereafter. 
However, for most countries the estimation results suggest that supply problems 
and shortages had little effect on inflation in 2020 but have made consistently 
positive contributions thereafter. Indeed, supply issues were still making 
significant contributions to inflation in 2023Q2, the last quarter covered by the 
decompositions. 
As noted above, as the pandemic-induced disruptions dissipated, the labor 
market in many countries became tighter—in nearly all cases, tighter than the 
pre-COVID period by the end of the sample. Nevertheless, the decompositions 
show that, the labor market generally played a limited role in the evolution of 
price inflation. The contributions of labor market conditions to inflation, shown 
by the red bars in figure 8, are consistently smaller than those of price shocks, 
typically near zero or negative in 2020, then positive but small by 2022 and 
2023. Indeed, the contribution of labor market tightness to inflation is found 
to be nearly equal to zero in five countries: Germany, Italy, Japan, Spain, and 
Belgium. The relatively weak effect reflects primarily the flatness of wage Phillips 
curves in the participating economies, discussed earlier.21
The decompositions also serve as a warning about extrapolating inflation 
based on quarter-to-quarter movements. The shocks to inflation, especially price 
shocks, are volatile, and their effects—both direct and indirect—can obscure 
lower-frequency trends. For example, in the United States in 2023Q2, energy 
price declines accounted for a 1.2 percentage point drop in inflation (at annual 
rates) while higher food prices worked the other way; in Japan, for the same 
quarter, the effect of the energy price decline (1.8 percentage points) was fully 
offset by an increase in food prices (which made a contribution to inflation of 
2.0 percentage points); in Italy, the contributions to inflation in that quarter 
were −5.2 percentage points from energy but 3.6 percentage points from food! 
Discerning the inflation trend through this noise requires close attention to the 
composition of the shocks to the price level. 
To repeat the main theme of this paper, the historical decompositions for 
most countries point to sequences of strong price shocks with limited dynamic 
effects as explaining most of the increase and later decrease in the recent 
21	
In the case of Belgium, the effect of the vacancy-unemployment ratio on wage inflation is 
relatively large and significant. But, as discussed below, there is limited pass-through of wage 
inflation to price inflation, so the effect on price inflation is small. 


31 
WP 24-11  |  MAY 2024
inflation. Labor market tightness, together with a small increase in long-run 
inflation expectations, has led, in some countries, to a slow buildup of wage 
inflation. As price shocks have partly reversed, the contribution of the labor 
market has become relatively larger, although inflation is still buffeted by positive 
and negative price shocks. 
An encouraging finding is that there is little evidence, in any economy, that 
a wage-price or price-wage spiral emerged. In this sense, the episode is clearly 
different from the high-inflation episodes of the 1970s, when increases in the prices 
of oil and other commodities led to demands for higher nominal wages, which in 
turn led to high and persistent inflation. Presumably, the credibility of central banks 
and institutional factors such as the absence of indexation in nearly all countries 
made this inflation episode very different from that of 50 years ago.22 
Returning to the debate with which we introduced the paper: Who was right, 
Team Transitory or Team Permanent? Team Transitory was right that shocks to 
prices (e.g., for energy and food) would have short-lived effects on inflation, but 
it did not anticipate the sequence of large price shocks that together created 
an extended period of inflation. Team Permanent was right to worry about 
labor market tightness but significantly overestimated its likely contribution to 
the inflation early on. As price shocks have receded, inflation has indeed fallen 
substantially; but, with labor markets not yet back in balance, the worries of 
Team Permanent may yet become relevant, as we discuss in the next section. 
Differences
We have so far focused on commonalities, but there are interesting differences 
across economies as well.23 
For example, countries started with very different initial conditions, including 
inherited inflation levels. We saw that the United Kingdom showed signs of 
overheating even before COVID. In most countries, however, the estimation 
results suggest that labor market conditions were roughly at their sustainable 
(“natural”) level in 2019Q4, though the associated levels of inflation before 
the pandemic were quite different. Notably, based on its estimated initial 
conditions, Japan entered the pandemic with an inherited inflation rate of 
0.5 percent, helping to explain why Japanese inflation remained below 5 percent 
throughout the period. 
Some have suggested that, notwithstanding the dominance of price shocks, 
labor market tightness was more important in the United States than in the euro 
area where inflation was mostly imported. The decompositions support this 
distinction, with a very limited role of labor market conditions in the euro area. 
In contrast, the contributions of energy prices have been rather similar, 
although results for the euro area as a whole hide substantial differences among 
euro members, differences that appear to reflect in large part differences in 
fiscal subsidies intended to cap energy prices. For example, in the first three 
22	 Note that our estimation sample starts in 1990 and so cannot directly address the inflation 
of the 1970s. It would be interesting to estimate the same model on the earlier sample and 
compare coefficients, although data issues (e.g., lack of data on inflation expectations) pose an 
important barrier. 
23	 The same warning as before: Some of the differences may reflect noise in estimation rather 
than true underlying differences. 


32 
WP 24-11  |  MAY 2024
quarters of 2022, the sum of the contributions (direct and indirect) of energy 
prices to inflation was 5.6 percentage points for France, 12.1 percentage points 
for Germany, and 9.9 percentage points for Italy. These differences suggest that 
understanding cross-sectional differences in inflation behavior requires a closer 
look at the effects of energy subsidies and other fiscal policies aimed at limiting 
costs to households and firms.24
Japan has had lower inflation, as noted; it also had a smaller increase in 
inflation, an increase that appears to have been almost entirely imported. The 
labor market has played little or no role in Japanese inflation, with no increase in 
the vacancy-unemployment ratio, and, based on the country team’s estimates, a 
very flat wage Phillips curve (for full time workers). 
In contrast to the other countries, the main price shocks in Japan have come 
from the price of food rather than the price of energy, especially since the end 
of 2022. This difference reflects both the government’s measures to directly limit 
the increase in the price of gas and electricity during this period and the large 
share of food in the Japanese CPI (25 percent). Because Japan imports much of 
its food, those prices were also increased by the large depreciation of the yen (by 
nearly 50 percent against the dollar since the start of the pandemic), although 
of course that factor affected the prices of energy and other imports as well. 
Note also that inflation has subsided in Japan even though the central bank did 
not raise interest rates, suggesting a nearly pure scenario of price shocks, with 
limited dynamic effects. 
Belgium is also an interesting case in that it is the only country in the panel 
to still have widespread wage indexation. Based on the experience of the 
1970s, one would have expected this institutional feature to result in a stronger 
wage-price interaction and higher inflation, but this has not been the case. 
Cumulative wage inflation in Belgium has indeed been higher than for the euro 
area: 17.8 percent over the period 2019Q4 to 2023Q2, versus 7.5 percent for the 
euro area over the same period. But cumulative price inflation has been roughly 
the same, 15.6 percent in Belgium versus 15.8 percent in the euro area. Put 
another way, the increase in wage inflation in Belgium has been accompanied 
by a substantial decrease in profit margins. The inability of Belgian firms to raise 
prices by as much as wages likely reflects the fact that Belgium is a small open 
economy operating under fixed exchange rates in the euro area. (The ratio of 
Belgian exports to GDP is 95 percent, and 65 percent of exports are to the rest 
of the European Union.25) The decrease in profit margins may, however, affect 
investment and have longer-lasting effects than our analysis can capture. 
3. IMPLICATIONS AND CONCLUSIONS
For the last part of the project, each team performed a conditional forecast 
exercise, starting from the positions of their respective economies in 2023Q2. 
Assuming that, starting in 2023Q3, there would be no further price shocks and 
24	 This issue is explored in Dao et al. (2023). 
25	 Our conclusion of limited pass-through is in contrast with Gagliardone et al. (2023), who, using 
a panel dataset for 1999–2019 (i.e., pre-COVID), conclude that the pass-through from marginal 
cost to production prices in manufacturing was high in Belgium during that period. Differences 
in the period examined—in wage versus marginal cost, production prices versus consumption 
prices, and manufacturing versus the whole economy—may explain the difference.

that shortages and productivity growth would equal their pre-COVID average, 
the country teams used their estimated models to forecast inflation, based on 
initial conditions in 2023Q2 and the values of the vacancy-unemployment ratio 
prevailing in each country at that time. 
The conclusion for most countries was that the vacancy-unemployment ratio 
had to decrease substantially (that is, labor markets had to come into better 
balance) to bring inflation to target. For example, for the United States, assuming 
that the ratio remained the same as in 2023Q2 implied that inflation would 
stabilize at 3.5 percent; in contrast, a decrease in the ratio to its pre-COVID value 
of 1.2 percent would lead to a decrease in inflation to 2.8 percent at the end of 
2024. A further decrease would be needed to get inflation down to 2 percent by 
the end of 2024. (Note that these figures refer to CPI inflation; the Fed targets 
a different measure of inflation that tends to run a bit lower.) For the euro area, 
while inflation was projected by the estimated model to dip temporarily to 
2 percent in 2024, the model suggested that maintaining that level would also 
require a decrease in the vacancy-unemployment ratio below its pre-COVID 
value for some time. The reason that further reductions in labor market tightness 
were required in these two regions and in other economies, according to the 
model, was again the flatness of the wage Phillips curve. Tight labor markets had 
not contributed very much to the increase in inflation in most economies, but, 
symmetrically, looser labor markets would not reduce inflation very quickly. 
These conditional forecasts are now more than nine months old and thus 
obsolete. But they raise an important issue that is still relevant at the time we 
write. The issue is that most of the decrease in inflation from its peak has been 
due to the reversal of shocks to prices rather than cooling in labor market 
conditions. To the extent that wage inflation was still too high in mid-2023 to 
be consistent with central bank targets, and that wage inflation is relatively 
sticky, the last mile might be more difficult to achieve than the earlier gains 
against inflation. 
Precisely how costly the last mile might be is not yet resolved. In several, 
although not all, countries, the decrease in inflation in the second half of 2023 
was larger than projected by the model’s conditional forecasts or by professional 
forecasters outside of central banks. In the United States in particular, 
productivity growth has recently been strong, making higher wage inflation 
potentially more consistent with price inflation at target. We have not extended 
the project to assess how much of the decrease in inflation since mid-2023 can 
be attributed to better productivity growth, more favorable price shocks, or 
unexplained residuals, in particular in the wage equation. Doing so will have to 
wait until the inflation episode is fully behind us. 
Suppose we stipulate nevertheless, per the model, that returning inflation the 
rest of the way to target will require further decreases in the ratio of vacancies to 
unemployment. The question is what that decrease implies for the unemployment 
rate itself, which is the variable most observers care about. 
The relation between vacancies and unemployment (and thus between 
the vacancy-unemployment ratio and the unemployment rate) is known as the 
Beveridge curve. This curve, drawn in vacancy-unemployment space, is typically 
convex and downward sloping: a decrease in vacancies typically comes with an 
increase in unemployment. Equivalently, a decrease in the ratio of vacancies to 
unemployment, characteristic of looser labor market conditions, typically comes 


34 
WP 24-11  |  MAY 2024
with both a decrease in vacancies and an increase in unemployment. One of the 
contributions of this project has been to examine the Beveridge curve relation in 
each economy. The evidence is shown in figure 9, which plots the vacancy rate 
against the unemployment rate (both normalized) for each participating country. 
The blue dots correspond to the period 2011Q1 to 2019Q4, the green dots to 
2020Q1 to 2023Q1, and the red dot to 2023Q2. 
As the figure shows, there is a striking difference in the behavior of the 
Beveridge curve in the United States and Canada on the one hand, and in the 
other economies on the other. The United States and Canada both experienced 
large increases in their unemployment rates at the start of COVID, and then 
a movement back along a higher Beveridge curve than before. That is, both 
countries showed a strong upward shift in the Beveridge relation during the 
pandemic, implying that a given unemployment rate corresponded to a higher 
vacancy-unemployment ratio than before the pandemic. The other economies 
in our panel do not show comparable shifts. For example, the Beveridge relation 
in the euro area seems to have remained roughly unchanged, and in Japan, if 
anything, the curve seems to have shifted slightly lower during the pandemic. 
We are not aware of any systematic attempt yet to explain these differences. 
One place to look for an explanation might be in the differences in labor market 
policies pursued by various countries during the pandemic. 
As of 2023Q2, then, the question in the United States and Canada was a 
straightforward one: Would the shifts in the Beveridge curve be permanent or 
temporary? If the original shifts upward proved permanent, then reducing the 
vacancy-unemployment ratio by enough to bring inflation to target could involve 
a significant increase in unemployment. In contrast, if the Beveridge curve shifts 
reversed, reducing the unemployment rate associated with any given vacancy-
unemployment ratio, then bringing down that ratio might be done with little 
impact on unemployment.
The evidence since mid-2023 suggests that, in Canada and the United 
States, the initial shift has largely reversed, as vacancy rates have decreased 
while unemployment rates have remained roughly stable.26 If the shift fully 
reverses (i.e., the two Beveridge curves return to their prepandemic positions) 
then the cooling of labor markets, as measured by the decrease in the vacancy-
unemployment ratio, needed to return inflation to 2 percent may require only a 
limited increase in unemployment. Coupled with higher-than-expected sustained 
productivity growth, it might even require no increase in unemployment. The 
evolution of the shift in the Beveridge curve, and the persistence of higher 
productivity growth, are two of the most important dimensions of uncertainty 
facing the Fed today. In contrast, in economies where the Beveridge curve has 
remained stable but a meaningful decrease in the vacancy-unemployment ratio 
is needed to control inflation, successfully navigating the last mile may require 
accepting an increase in unemployment, at least for some time.
26	 One of the authors (Blanchard) is on record as arguing that much of the shift would likely 
remain, and he has been proven wrong. The origins of the shift and of its reversal, as well as the 
absence of such a shift in other countries, is still to be determined.

Conclusions and Extensions
Our joint project with ten central banks, unprecedented to our knowledge, 
has cast light on some important aspects of the recent inflation episode. The 
inflation appears explainable by a simple model, and for most economies, the 
model tells a consistent story. In sum, early on, the sharp inflation experienced 
by most countries was accounted for by shocks directly and indirectly affecting 
price levels, including rising commodity prices, shortages of specific goods, 
and, in some cases, reduced labor supply. Labor markets became tight almost 
everywhere but played almost no role in the inflation takeoff. However, the 
inflation effects of tight labor markets are persistent, so that, as the shocks 
to prices (e.g., for energy and food) have reversed, the wage pressures from 
hot labor markets have become a more important source of inflation. In most 
countries, traversing the last mile back to central bank inflation targets will 
likely require bringing labor markets into better balance by reducing vacancy-
unemployment ratios. The extent to which labor market cooling results in higher 
unemployment depends importantly on both the slope of the wage Phillips 
curve and the slope and position of the Beveridge curve. In countries such as the 
United States, where the Beveridge curve appears to be shifting down toward its 
prepandemic position, the unemployment costs of the last mile could be limited.
Future research might profitably concentrate further on the differences 
among the participating economies as well as the commonalities. For example, 
it would be interesting to better understand how inflation was affected by 
differences in government policies regarding energy subsidies and caps, and by 
policies for supporting workers and firms during the pandemic.
Another direction for future research is to model the role of key variables 
that we have treated as exogenous in this iteration of the model. For example, 
had fiscal policy in various countries (most notably the United States) been less 
generous, would global energy and food prices have been noticeably lower and 
shortages less severe? How much higher would unemployment have been?
Of more narrow interest would be the reconciliation of the estimates for the 
euro area as a whole and those of euro area member countries. Estimated wage 
equations differ substantially across the countries, suggesting that aggregation 
may be misleading. A first step toward resolving the issue was taken by the 
German team, who used a panel data approach with country fixed effects (the 
results are reported in their paper). But panel estimation with fixed effects may 
not go far enough if, for example, the response of wage inflation to labor market 
tightness or other variables varies significantly across countries.
Finally, it would be worth digging further into the role of productivity 
growth. Our decompositions did not attribute much inflation or disinflation 
to productivity growth, but this may be an artifact of a poor specification. 
Productivity growth has differed across countries, with the United States in 
particular emerging from the pandemic with higher productivity growth than in 
the prepandemic period, whereas productivity growth has remained low in much 
of Europe. Whether these productivity trends persist will be an important factor 
in the evolution of unit labor costs and thus, indirectly, a key determinant of the 
costs of the last mile back to inflation targets.

APPENDIX 
The analytical model in BB is composed of four equations.
The wage equation has two components. 
The first gives the nominal wage w, as a function of the expected price level 
pe, and the aspiration real wage wA, all in logs, and a generic measure of labor 
market tightness x: 
The second gives the aspiration wage wA as a linear combination of the 
lagged aspiration wage, wA(–1), the actual lagged real wage w(–1) – p(–1), and a 
generic wage shock zw: 
Combining the two gives the wage equation:
The price equation gives the price level p as a function of the nominal wage 
w, both in logs, and a generic measure of price shocks zp: 
Taking first differences gives the price equation:
Short-run inflation expectations (pe – p(–1)) are assumed to be a function of 
long-run inflation expectations π* and of past inflation:
*
Long-run inflation expectations are assumed to be a function of themselves 
lagged and of past inflation: 
*
*
Given wage and price shocks and labor market tightness, these four 
equations determine the dynamics of price and wage inflation as well as short- 
and long-run inflation expectations. 
The impulse response presented in figure 2 shows the response of inflation to 
a positive price shock, for example an increase in the relative price of energy, for 
two different sets of values of the parameters. The impulse response presented in 
figure 3 shows the response of inflation to a tightening of the labor market, again 
for two different sets of values of the parameters. 
The quarterly empirical model that we estimated in BB and in this project has 
the same structure, but a more generous lag structure.

WP 24-11  |  MAY 2024
The wage inflation equation is
h
Wage inflation depends on lagged wage inflation, lagged expected short-run 
inflation, the lagged ratio of vacancies to unemployment (or, for countries for 
which this ratio is not available, a closely related variable), taken as the measure 
of labor market tightness, the lagged catch-up variable, constructed as the 
sum of unexpected inflation over the previous 4 quarters, an 8-quarter moving 
average productivity growth, and, in some countries, two dummies to capture the 
unusual movements in wages in 2020Q2 and 2020Q3. 
The price inflation equation is 
h
Price inflation depends on lagged price inflation, lagged wage inflation, a 
moving average of productivity growth, and three measures of price shocks: the 
rate of growth of the price of energy relative to the wage, the rate of growth 
of the price of food relative to the wage, and a measure of shortages, based on 
Google trends (or, in some countries, alternative variables or synthetic measures). 
The short-run inflation expectation equation is 
Short-run inflation expectations depend on themselves lagged, on lagged 
long-run expectations, and on current and lagged actual inflation. There is no 
constant term. 
The long-run inflation expectation equation is
Long-run inflation expectations depend on themselves lagged, and on current 
and lagged actual inflation. There is no constant term. 


43 
WP 24-11  |  MAY 2024
The four equations are constrained by homogeneity restrictions, which imply 
no long-run tradeoff between inflation and activity:
The results of estimation of each equation are given in the following four 
tables. In some cases, the country team explored several specifications (e.g., 
alternative choices of the wage variable). The tables present the results of the 
specification emphasized by the country team and used to construct the impulse 
response functions and decompositions shown in the text. The reader is referred 
to the country papers for more details. 
For each equation and variable, the tables give the estimated sum of 
coefficients and the p-value associated with the hypothesis that the sum or the 
set of coefficients is equal to zero. For each equation, they also give the p-value 
associated with the homogeneity hypothesis and with subsample stability. Table 
A1 reports two wage equations for Japan, for full- and part-time workers; the 
equation used in the model simulations is based on a regression of a weighted 
average of both wages on its determinants.
