IMF Executive Board Completes the Third Review of the 
Extended Arrangement under the Extended Arrangement 
under the Extended Fund Facility Arrangement for Egypt  
FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE 
• 
Today the IMF Executive Board completed the third review under the Extended 
Arrangement under the Extended Fund Facility (EFF) for Egypt, allowing the 
authorities to draw the equivalent of about US$820 million (SDR 618.1 million). 
• 
The Egyptian authorities’ recent efforts to restore macroeconomic stability have 
started to yield positive results. Inflation remains elevated but is coming down. A 
flexible exchange rate regime remains a cornerstone of the authorities’ program. 
• 
But the regional environment remains difficult, and complex domestic policy 
challenges require decisive implementation of the authorities’ reform program. 
Continued fiscal consolidation, with strengthened revenue mobilization, to create the 
space needed to expand social programs. ⁠Accelerating structural reforms to help raise 
private sector growth will also be key. 
Washington, DC – July 29, 2024: The Executive Board of the International Monetary Fund 
(IMF) completed the third review of Egypt’s EFF arrangement. This enables the authorities to 
immediately draw about US$820 million (SDR 618.1 million). Egypt’s 46-month EFF 
arrangement was approved on December 16, 2022.  
Macroeconomic conditions have started to improve since the approval of the combined first 
and second reviews of the program in March. Inflationary pressures are gradually abating, 
foreign exchange shortages have been eliminated, and fiscal targets (including related to 
spending by large infrastructure projects) were met. These improvements are beginning to 
have a positive effect on investor confidence and private sector sentiment. At the same time, 
the difficult regional environment generated by the conflict in Gaza and Israel and tensions in 
the Red Sea, as well as domestic policy and structural challenges, call for continued 
implementation of program commitments.  
Maintaining a flexible exchange rate regime and a liberalized foreign exchange system will be 
imperative to avoid a buildup of external imbalances. At the same time, a data-driven 
approach by the Central Bank is needed to lower inflation and inflation expectations. Ongoing 
fiscal consolidation efforts will help place public debt on a decisive downward path. To ensure 
that resources are still available to meet vital spending needs to help Egyptian families, 
including on health and education, particular attention will be needed to strengthen domestic 
revenue mobilization and contain fiscal risks from the energy sector. This will also assist in 
generating some fiscal space to expand social spending in support of vulnerable groups.  
While there has been progress on some critical structural reforms, greater efforts are needed 
to implement the State Ownership Policy (SOP). Such measures include accelerating the 
divestment program, pursuing reforms to streamline business regulations to set up new firms, 
expediting trade facilitation practices, and creating a “level playing field” that avoids unfair 
competitive practices by state-owned companies. Bolstering financial sector resilience and the 
governance practices and competition in the banking sector should also be key priorities. 
These measures are crucial for steering Egypt toward private-sector-led growth that can 
generate jobs and opportunities for everyone.

At the conclusion of the Executive Board’s discussion, Ms. Antoinette M. Sayeh, Deputy 
Managing Director, and Acting Chair, made the following statement: 
“Strengthened reforms under the EFF-supported program are yielding positive results. The 
unification of the exchange rate and the accompanying monetary policy tightening have 
curtailed speculation, brought in foreign inflows, and have moderated price growth. With signs 
of recovery in sentiment, private sector growth should be poised for a rebound.  
“Policy settings are expected to help maintain macroeconomic stability. A sustained shift to a 
flexible exchange rate regime and a liberalized foreign exchange system, continued 
implementation of a tight monetary policy stance, and further fiscal consolidation coupled with 
proper implementation of the framework to monitor and control public investment should 
support internal and external balance. The allocation of a portion of the financing from the Ras 
El-Hekma deal to reserve accumulation and debt reduction provides an additional cushion 
against shocks.     
“Looking ahead, implementation of the structural reform agenda is key to achieving more 
inclusive and sustainable growth. Reforms that boost tax revenue, deliver a more robust debt 
management strategy, and bring additional resources from divestment to debt reduction would 
create space for more productive spending, including additional targeted social spending. 
Restoring energy prices to their cost recovery levels, including retail fuel prices by December 
2025, is essential to supporting the smooth provision of energy to the population and reducing 
imbalances in the sector. Enhancing the governance of state-owned banks, advancing the 
state-ownership policy, increasing fiscal transparency, and leveling the economic playing field 
are critical to securing greater private investment. 
“Risks remain significant. Regional conflicts and uncertainty about the duration of disruption of 
trade in the Red Sea are important sources of external risk. Maintaining appropriate 
macroeconomic policies, including a flexible exchange rate regime, would help ensure 
economic stability. Meaningfully advancing with the structural reform program would 
significantly improve growth prospects. Managing the resumption of capital inflows prudently 
will also be important to contain potential inflationary pressures and limit the risk of future 
external pressures.” 
 


 
 
ARAB REPUBLIC OF EGYPT 
THIRD REVIEW UNDER THE EXTENDED ARRANGEMENT 
UNDER THE EXTENDED FUND FACILITY, MONETARY POLICY 
CONSULTATION CLAUSE, REQUESTS FOR WAIVERS OF 
NONOBSERVANCE OF A PERFORMANCE CRITERION AND 
APPLICABILITY OF PERFORMANCE CRITERIA, AND REQUEST 
FOR MODIFICATION OF PERFORMANCE CRITERIA 
EXECUTIVE SUMMARY 
 
Context: Policy actions taken in March as part of a strengthened program package, 
including unification of the exchange rate and a significant increase in the policy rate, 
combined with the augmentation of the Extended Fund Facility (EFF) Arrangement, the 
recent investment deal with Abu Dhabi Development Holding Company (ADQ) and the 
announcement of financing from the European Union, the World Bank, and other 
international partners, improved FX liquidity and helped restore confidence. Inflation 
has started to fall, though remains elevated, and there are signs that the three-and-a-
half-year contraction of private sector activity is reversing. 
 
Program Performance. The authorities have sustained the shift to a flexible exchange 
rate regime and a liberalized foreign exchange (FX) system and have begun 
implementing the framework for slowing down overall public investment. The policy 
mix is appropriate, even as the Monetary Policy Consultation Clause (MPCC) was 
triggered on account of inflation surprises in February. All but one of the Quantitative 
Performance Criteria (QPC) for end-March were met, with the primary fiscal balance 
including divestment falling short of target solely due to exchange rate valuations 
related to divestment proceeds. The weekly QPC on the balance of the government’s 
overdraft facility at the CBE was also not met for the weeks ending April 18 to May 23 
because of borrowing from the facility in anticipation of receipt of the second tranche 
of the ADQ deal, which was received in late May; the balance on the overdraft facility 
was lowered below the ceiling by May 30, 2024. Reserve buffers are notably stronger. 
The authorities met about half of indicative targets (IT) for end-March including the ITs 
on tax revenue and social spending. Despite the notable improvement in domestic

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND 
financing terms after exchange rate unification, the IT on the maturity of new domestic debt 
issuances through auctions was missed by a narrow margin, due to the reliance on short-term 
Treasury bills (T-bills) before unification (January and February). However, the IT on guarantees was 
missed by a large margin as guarantees denominated in foreign currency were revalued following 
the depreciation of the official exchange rate in early March and new guarantees were issued on 
behalf of the national oil company (EGPC). The authorities met half of the structural benchmarks for 
the review. 
 
Policy Recommendations. Maintaining a flexible exchange rate regime and a liberalized foreign 
exchange system will be imperative to avoid a buildup of external imbalances in the future and 
demonstrate to all stakeholders that “this time is different.” A clear data-driven focus by the Central 
Bank is needed to lower inflation and inflation expectations toward its target. The ongoing fiscal 
consolidation would put debt on a downward path and support efforts to contain demand pressures, 
but looking ahead the authorities will need to (i) make a clear shift toward a tax revenue-based 
consolidation to sustainably increase the primary surplus and make space for priority expenditure, 
(ii) take advantage of the current improvement in market sentiment to develop a more robust debt 
management strategy to lower gross financing needs, and (iii) mobilize additional resources from 
divestment or from operations of public sector entities to help reduce the interest rate burden. 
Transparent and rigorous implementation of the new framework to monitor and control public 
investment will also be critical for macroeconomic stability. Fiscal risks will need to be contained, and 
a stronger effort to put EGPC on a better financial footing may also be needed if current plans fall 
short. On the structural front, early deliverables are now needed to secure investor confidence in the 
commitment to significant reforms, to release constraints to private sector activity, and hand over 
growth to the private sector. These include steps toward enhancing the governance structure of 
state-owned banks, continued strengthening of the competition framework, and efforts to automate 
and modernize trade facilitation procedures to increase efficiency and remove trade barriers. 
 
Program risks. Egypt is buffeted by negative spillovers from the conflict in Gaza and Israel, 
particularly the disruption of trade in the Red Sea, which is significantly reducing Suez Canal receipts, 
eroding an important source of foreign exchange inflows and fiscal revenue. The time period over 
which this source of stress will persist is highly uncertain, and thus it remains as an important 
external source of risk to the outlook. Prolonged inflationary pressures would further erode 
purchasing power. The potential impact of the Ras El-Hekma investment project on the Egyptian 
economy will be positive as it may help boost growth and structurally improve the balance of 
payments. At the same time, it will also require continuous rigor in macroeconomic management to 
ensure that possible risks of overheating are contained. Potential program implementation risks 
include a failure to sustain the shift to a liberalized foreign exchange system, insufficient energy price 
adjustments that do not bring prices to cost recovery levels and do not materially improve the 
financial condition of state-owned companies in the energy sector, difficulty in delivering a 
transparent and comprehensive integration of the off-budget investment program into overall 
macroeconomic policy decision making, and not advancing meaningfully with the structural reform 
program, which would dampen growth prospects. Sustained large surges in portfolio flows could 
complicate macroeconomic management, particularly as they can lead to heightened

macroeconomic volatility. Egypt’s capacity to repay the Fund is contingent on full program 
implementation and the materialization of all projected financing.  
 
Staff supports the authorities’ request for the completion of the third review under the EFF 
Arrangement. Staff also supports the authorities’ requests for a waiver of non-observance of the 
end-June 2024 criterion on overdraft borrowing as it was temporary and corrective action was taken. 
Moreover, staff supports the request for waivers of applicability of the end-June QPCs on net 
international reserves and primary fiscal balance as the Executive Board discussion of the 3rd review 
will take place in early July 2024 after the end-June 2024 test date when the data to assess 
performance on these QPCs is not available. Staff recommends completion of the MPCC consultation 
with the Executive Board.

RECENT DEVELOPMENTS  
1.      
Economic activity remains weak amid signs of an uptick in confidence. Growth slowed to an 
average of 2.5 percent in the first half of FY2023/24 due to weak confidence and foreign exchange 
shortages, which constrained overall investment (Figure 1). The conflict in Gaza and Israel as well as the 
disruptions in the Red Sea are further exacerbating these pressures. Suez Canal revenues deposited at 
the Central Bank fell by 57 percent y/y in the first quarter of 2024. The health of the non-oil private 
sector remains frail despite an uptick in the headline Purchasing Managers’ Index in May 2024 (Figure 2).

(SA, 50+=Expansion) 
 
 
 
2.      
Since the exchange rate unification, outcome metrics suggest the exchange rate is 
market determined. The spread between the official rate and measures of market clearing rates has 
remained closed since early March, the foreign exchange demand backlog at banks has remained zero, 
and daily interbank foreign exchange turnover has increased significantly relative to the pre-unification 
period (about ten times as large as pre-unification levels). The Central Bank of Egypt (CBE) has not 
conducted FX sale interventions since the unification. Several international companies have confirmed 
normalized access to foreign exchange for purposes of dividend repatriation. The official rate has 
remained relatively stable after the unification due to several opposing forces. While additional FX 
inflows due to the Ras El-Hekma deal and nonresident investors brought appreciation pressures, the 
underlying depreciation pressures remained due to high inflation and an increase in FX demand 
associated with the FX backlog clearance at banks.  
3.      
While still high, inflation has generally trended downwards since September 2023. After 
reaching an all-time high of 38 percent in September 2023, annual headline urban inflation fell for a third 
consecutive month to 28.1 percent in May—its lowest level since January 2023— following a temporary 
spike in February that was likely due to greater than expected passthrough of the significant depreciation 
in the parallel exchange rate in January, in addition to idiosyncratic factors, including seasonal food price 
increases around Ramadan and the delayed reflection of education price hikes. Sequentially, inflation was 
about 1 percent m/m in March and April and turned negative in May (-0.7 percent m/m) vs. 11.4 percent 
m/m in February as food prices have eased. The last time a deceleration was recorded was in August

2021. The monetary policy hike in March, as well as the significant reduction in monetary financing of the 
government, are expected to help contain inflation in the coming months.

Strict control of spending has kept discretionary fiscal policy tight in FY2023/24. In the 
first ten months of FY2023/24, the budget sector primary surplus, excluding divestment proceeds 
improved by 1 percent of GDP (y/y) relative to the same period in the previous year, and reached 
2.0 percent of GDP. This improvement was due to a broad-based reduction in primary expenditures. 
Over the same time period, total revenues (excluding divestment proceeds) declined by 0.4 percent of 
GDP compared to the prior year, while tax revenue collection declined by 0.2 percent of GDP due to a 
decline in excise tax collections on tobacco and cigarettes. While discretionary spending remained 
prudent, interest payments increased sharply to 9.0 percent of GDP in the first ten months of 
FY2023/24, accounting for 51 percent of total expenditure and 84 percent of total revenues. Fee hikes 
supported revenue from Suez Canal through December 2023, but the Suez Canal’s monthly 
contribution to the budget has slowed since. The allocation of windfall revenue to the Ministry of 
Finance (MoF) from the sale of development rights in Ras El-Hekma has helped reduce gross financing 
needs and debt. 
5.      
 The FY2024/25 budget approved by parliament in early June targets a primary surplus of 
3.5 percent of GDP, exclusive of divestment proceeds. To reach this target, the budget envisages an 
increase in overall revenues of 1 percent of GDP, with increases in tax revenues and other non-tax revenues 
by 0.7 and 0.3 percent of GDP, respectively. The increase in tax revenues will be supported by a 
combination of tax policy and revenue administration measures (See Text Table 1). Primary expenditure will 
be reduced by 0.5 percent of GDP compared with the estimated outturn for FY2023/24, but social benefits 
to vulnerable households will be protected. Additionally, the MoF plans to secure 1 percent of GDP in 
divestment proceeds to reduce public debt.

Domestic financing 
conditions improved significantly 
after the exchange rate 
unification and policy rate hike. 
Before the unification in early 
March, domestic financing relied 
heavily on short- term T-bills (such 
as 3-month T-bills), private 
placements of Treasury Securities 
mainly at state-owned banks, and 
borrowing from the central bank’s 
overdraft facility. After the unification, the authorities have relied more heavily on weekly T-bill auctions, 
increased issuance of longer-term T-bills (such as 12-month T-bills) and brought the use of the overdraft 
facility down to below the statutory limit at   
the end of March 2024. Subsequently, the government increased reliance on the balance in the overdraft 
facility, temporarily exceeding the statutory limit, in April and May, in anticipation of the receipt of the 
second tranche from the Ras El-Hekma deal, which arrived in late May 2024. The overdraft decreased to 
below the statutory limit by end-May 2024. Nonresident holdings of local currency T-bills and T-bonds, 
measured at face value, have also increased significantly to about US$20 billion in April, an increase by 
about US$19 billion since unification of the exchange rate. The non-resident inflows have pushed down 
the T-bill interest rate below the central bank’s discount rate. Moreover, the authorities are relying less on 
private placements since April and spreads have fallen significantly since the start of the year (Figure 5).

The banking system remains stable so far following the recent increase in interest rates 
and currency depreciation, but some vulnerabilities remain. Banks on average are profitable, liquid 
and have adequate capital that exceed prudential minimums. Banks’ net foreign asset (NFA) positions 
have rebounded sharply reflecting an increase in capital inflows following the announcement of the 
Ras El-Hekma deal and completion of the 1st and 2nd reviews under the EFF arrangement (Figure 6). 
While banks are reported to remain compliant with regulatory limits, foreign currency loans, 
particularly to public sector entities (Figures 7) are not fully matched by foreign currency deposits 
(particularly on the balance sheets of the biggest banks), which would imply a potential vulnerability to 
exchange rate movements, including through credit risks. Banks remain compliant with regulatory 
limits on net foreign exchange open positions.

The current account deficit widened further in the last calendar quarter of 2023. A 
reduction in non-oil exports and a decompression of non-oil imports weakened the non-oil trade 
balance (Figure 8). Prior to the exchange rate unification, remittances remained low relative to 
historical levels due to the large parallel market spread. Additionally, the balance of services also 
deteriorated, predominantly due to a decline in tourism receipts reflecting the impact of the conflict in

Gaza and Israel, although the adverse effects of the conflict on tourism have been less pronounced 
than initially anticipated. The widening of the current account deficit was fully financed by a significant 
increase in the financial account, with a strong increase in foreign direct investment (FDI) boosted by 
net reinvested earnings (in part, from constrained dividend repatriation due to FX shortages prior to 
the unification) and real estate purchases by non-residents and other investments (led by an increase 
in short-term suppliers’ credit) (Figure 9). Preliminary data for 2024: Q1 suggest a further widening of 
the current account deficit, driven by a pronounced decline in Suez Canal receipts (by 60 percent y/y) 
due to disruptions in the Red Sea, and despite a rebound in remittances in March after the exchange 
rate unification. Yet the overall balance of payments (BOP) balance is expected to turn positive as 
inflows, particularly from Ras El-Hekma and T-bills held by nonresidents, provide a significant boost to 
the financial account (the latter explaining a large increase in commercial banks’ net foreign assets). 
Net international reserves were US$32.1 billion at the end of April 2024 (reflecting an increase of 
US$12.3 billion relative to February 2024).1,2

The development of the Ras El Hekma region is not expected to start until 2025. The land 
for the Ras El Hekma project was transferred to a newly established Ras El Hekma for Urban 
Development Project Company. The company was granted golden licenses to develop a freezone and 
an investment zone. The New Urban Communities Authority (NUCA) will function as the regulator for 
the project’s development (e.g., issue licenses and review development plans). The government will 
have a 35 percent interest in the profits generated by the company after all costs incurred have been 
recovered. The authorities have not received the development plan for the 
region from ADQ, which may take a year to complete. Preliminary information shared by the 
authorities suggests that the investment could reach US$150 billion over a period of 20–30 years. The 
authorities suggested that investment in the region could be about US$3-4 billion annually, mostly in 
 
1 A strengthening of commercial bank’s net foreign assets (US$13.3 billion in FY2023/24: Q3) is reflected in the external 
financing needs table (Table 11) in both the sources (changes assets with negative sign) and needs (liabilities).     
2 A reduction in gross international reserves (GIR) is not directly reflected in NIR because of a contemporaneous 
reduction in CBE’s foreign-related liabilities by US$4.9 bn between Feb 2024 (1st and 2nd reviews). This reduction in 
liabilities is primarily explained by CBE repayments of short-term money market liabilities.

the form of FDI and domestic private investments. The authorities noted that most of the basic 
infrastructure already exists in the region. No public sector infrastructure provision is required except 
for bringing electricity grid access to the border of the region. Development is expected to take place 
without any public sector guarantees to support private sector investment. 
10.      Anticipated Cabinet-level changes are unlikely to deter program implementation. 
Following President El-Sisi’s swearing in for a third term in April, the Prime Minister submitted the 
government's resignation in early June. President El-Sisi has commissioned the outgoing prime 
minister to form a new government, the announcement of which could take place later in June. 
However, the authorities have emphasized that the reform agenda under the program is fully aligned 
with domestic reform priorities.  
OUTLOOK AND RISKS  
11.      The macroeconomic framework reflects recent developments and incorporates staff estimates of 
the impact on growth, investment, and the balance of payments from development of the Ras El-Hekma 
region based on the authorities’ very preliminary assumptions regarding FDI inflows related to the 
project (See Text Box 1).  
• 
Real growth for FY2023/24 is projected to slow to 2.7 percent to internalize the weak outturn in the 
first half of the fiscal year. A strong recovery is anticipated in FY2024/25 as the development of the 
Ras El-Hekma region begins and pressures from the conflict and Red Sea disruptions are assumed 
to abate in the second half of the fiscal year. Over the medium term, growth is projected to 
increase to around 5½ percent, as structural reforms to strengthen the business climate bear fruit 
and the state footprint is gradually replaced with private activity. Inflation is expected to trend 
downwards over the next 12 months as base effects unwind and policy tightening takes hold. The 
recent change in the methodology for calculating private investment in the national accounts 
statistics reallocates spending from private consumption to private investment but does not 
change the level of GDP or other expenditure subcomponents.3 
• 
Despite the large depreciation of the official exchange rate upon unification and the increase in the 
policy rate, the debt-to-GDP ratio is projected to follow a downward trajectory, as half of the new 
financing from the Ras El-Hekma deal was applied to debt reduction, primary surpluses are 
sustained, and favorable interest-growth differentials persist.4,5 The decline in the debt ratio is 
expected to start in FY2023/24, earlier than projected at the time of the first and second reviews, 
 
3 In early 2024, the authorities announced a new methodology for estimating private investment, which incorporates the 
following items in private investment: informal private sector investment outside establishments: investment in R&D; 
household expenditures on new residential buildings; and household expenditure on major housing maintenance and 
repair. The change increases private investment and total investment by an estimated 1.6 percent of GDP in FY2023/24 
but there is no change in GDP levels because private consumption (and total consumption) is reduced by the same 
amount. Private sector investment in FY2022/23 is now estimated to represent 36.4 percent of total investment, up from 
a previous estimate of 25.5 percent. The authorities plan to eventually restate the historical GDP by expenditure to 
reflect the change in the methodology. 
4 The debt projection also includes staff’s estimate of the CBE’s negative equity and the government’s recapitalization of 
the CBE. The latter adds to the stock of debt and debt service in subsequent years. 
5 Total anticipated divestment flows to the budget under the program peak at 1 percent of GDP in FY2024/25 and taper 
to 0.5 percent of GDP over the projection period.

primarily on the back of smaller-than-projected exchange rate depreciation during FY2023/24. 
However, for some time, debt, the interest burden, and rollover risk will remain high.  
• 
Projections for net international reserves for FY2023/24 and FY2024/25 have been revised upwards, 
to reflect BOP data for December 2023, the latest NIR data, assumptions on the potential FDI inflows 
related the Ras-El-Hekma deal (Box 1), and the sharp step-increase of nonresident short-term inflows 
to local currency T-bills after the unification. Projections for net portfolio flows for FY2024/25 were 
revised upwards to account for the high demand for Egypt’s bond and T-bill issuances, while keeping 
the projections for the remainder of the program period unchanged from the previous reviews. 
Commercial bank NFA stocks were revised upwards in FY2023/24 to reflect a significant increase 
observed in FY2023/24: Q3, but are projected to remain broadly neutral in FY2024/25 (as capital 
inflows moderate from levels observed in FY2023/24, and inflows are directed to cover a peak in 
projected repayments). External debt service is estimated to increase in FY2024/25, primarily due to 
the increase in short-term debt (T-bills) held by nonresidents.  
12.      Risks to the outlook are significant.  
• 
Chief among the downside risks would be a failure to sustain the shift to a flexible exchange rate 
regime and a liberalized foreign exchange system, monetary policy being too loose to bring 
inflation down, insufficient adjustment of energy prices so that they remain below cost recovery 
levels, difficulty in delivering a transparent and comprehensive integration of the off-budget 
investment program into overall macroeconomic policy decision making, and not advancing 
meaningfully with the structural reform program, which would dampen growth prospects. 
Intensification of regional conflicts and a prolonged disruption in the Red Sea could further 
undermine growth, fiscal revenues, the divestment process, and the external position. A large 
increase in portfolio inflows could increase the risk of capital flow reversals and external 
vulnerabilities; similarly, given the potential size of the Ras El-Hekma investment project at an 
estimated total of $150 billion or about 50 percent of current GDP, a faster-than-expected pickup in 
investment brings the possibility of overheating and exerting upward pressure on the currency, 
potentially leading to phenomena akin to Dutch disease, where cheaper imports and costlier exports 
could disadvantage critical sectors such as manufacturing and agriculture.  
• 
On the upside, external financial market conditions for Egypt could ease more than expected and 
large capital inflows could continue. Larger-than-expected FDI associated with the Ras El Hekma deal 
relative to the baseline or additional similar investments is also an upside risk on growth, provided 
that the authorities are able to minimize any fiscal risks associated with these transactions, such as 
increased use of public-private partnerships or freezones. Inflation could also fall back more quickly 
than projected, particularly if a return of confidence results in a material appreciation of the 
exchange rate. Annex I contains the Risk Assessment Matrix.

Box 1. Preliminary Estimates of Economic Impact of Development of Ras El-Hekma  
This box summarizes staff’s preliminary estimates of the first-round impact on growth, investment, and the balance of 
payments from development of the Ras El-Hekma region. 
The framework at the time of completion of the first and second reviews already incorporated the one-off receipt by 
the New Urban Communities Authority (NUCA) of US$24 billion in new financing from the Ras El-Hekma investment 
deal as well as the conversion of the US$11 billion UAE dollar deposits at the Central Bank (CBE) into local currency. 
From the new financing, US$15 billion was purchased by the CBE to boost international reserves, while the 
remainder remains with NUCA. The Ministry of Finance has received the local currency equivalent of US$12 billion 
from the transaction in its Treasury Single Account, which was used to reduce debt financing.  
To incorporate the development of the region into the macroeconomic framework, in line with the authorities’ 
assumptions, staff assumes an annual inflow of FDI in the range of US$2.5 billion to US$5 billion, of which 70 percent 
is assumed to finance non-oil imports related to the project, in line with staff’s currently used elasticity from FDI 
flows to imports. However, the authorities hope for greater local content. As more information becomes available, 
such as the development plans, staff will revise the macroeconomic framework as needed. Over the program period, 
this implies cumulative increases in FDI of US$12.5 billion, non-oil imports of about US$8.8 billion. The reserve 
accumulation path relative to the adequacy metric now increases more gradually to reach above 120, over the 
medium term (Box Table 1).1 
 BOP: Preliminary Estimate of Impact of Development of Ras El-Hekma 
(In billion US$) 
 
Staff assumes the FDI that remains in the domestic economy finances an increase in construction and building 
activity (Box Table 2) that translates into higher real growth ranging between <0.1 – 0.4 percentage points, relative 
to projections of real growth prior to incorporating assumptions about the development of Ras El-Hekma into the 
program baseline. On the expenditure side of GDP, the FDI boosts private investment, but public spending on 
infrastructure is not assumed to accelerate as public investment is bound under the authorities’ public investment 
ceiling and the authorities have only committed to ensure electricity grid access at the border of the region.

PROGRAM PERFORMANCE 
13.      Program performance for the third review was satisfactory (Table 13). The controlling 
QPCs for the 3rd review are the end-June 2024 QPCs. The authorities did not meet the weekly QPC on 
the overdraft account at the CBE as the government temporarily borrowed from the account in April 
and May as described above. However, as of May 31, 2024, the balance of the account was zero, well 
below the QPC ceiling. Performance relative to the other QPCs for end-June appears on track, but data 
are not available yet to fully assess performance against the targets. As for the end-March QPCs, all 
but one were met. The authorities met the QPC on net international reserve (NIR) by a significant 
margin as reserves were boosted by the increase in nonresident inflows into local currency T-bills in 
March 2024. The authorities also met the QPCs on the reduction of the balance at the CBE’s overdraft 
facility and CBE lending to government agencies but did not meet the QPC for the primary balance 
mainly because the realized exchange rate used to convert the dollar proceeds from Ras El-Hekma 
deal was less depreciated than under program assumptions. The authorities also met four of seven ITs 
for end-March including the ITs on tax revenue and social spending. Despite the improvement in 
domestic financing after unification, the IT on the maturity of new domestic debt issuances through 
auctions was missed by a narrow margin, due to the reliance on short-term T-bills before unification 
(January and February) and the IT on the debt stock was missed by a narrow margin due to high 
interest rates. The IT on guarantees was missed by a large margin as guarantees denominated in 
foreign currency were revalued following the depreciation of the official exchange rate in early March 
and new guarantees were issued on behalf of EGPC. Annual urban inflation exceeded the upper outer 
band under the program for end-March 2024, triggering the MPCC consultation with the Board.  
14.      Half the structural benchmarks (SBs) for the third review were met (Table 15). The 
authorities met the SBs to maintain a flexible exchange rate regime and a liberalized FX system, 
enacted the executive regulations of the Unified Public Finance Law, published comprehensive tax 
expenditure and government procurement contract reports, and introduced a fixed rate, full allotment 
of the CBE’s 7-day deposit operations. 
15.      At the same time, several SBs were not met. Staff proposes to rephase two, modify one, and 
not reset two. 
• 
The SB to introduce a binding requirement to ensure the timely publication of the Central Auditing 
Organization’s (CAO) annual audit reports on the fiscal accounts by end-March 2024 was rephased 
to end-November 2024 and modified to be more specific because the authorities are currently 
amending the law governing the CAO and plan to introduce this requirement into the law rather 
than implement it through a decree; 
 
• 
The SB to prepare a recapitalization plan for the CBE was rephased to end-August 2024 as the 
authorities prepared an initial estimate of the recapitalization needs of the CBE, but require more 
time to refine the estimate and plan for an effective recapitalization strategy;  


ARAB REPUBLIC OF EGYPT 
INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND 15 
• 
The SB on the quarterly implementation of the retail fuel price indexation mechanism was modified 
as it will be temporarily replaced by a firm commitment to restore fuel prices to their cost recovery 
levels by December 2025; 
 
• 
The SB to create a plan to reduce CBE claims on public sector agencies (excluding the MOF) was 
not reset as the authorities have committed to reducing the claims by EGP 150 billion by end-July 
2024 and further reduce CBE claims by EGP 100 billion every fiscal year until the claims are reduced 
to zero as reflected in the QPC on CBE claims on government agencies; and 
 
• 
The SB to prepare a plan to reduce EGPC arrears was not reset because the authorities have 
articulated a strategy to repay EGPC arrears, including measures to boost EGPC revenues through 
increases in energy prices, but stronger conditionality on improving EGPC’s financial situation will 
be considered in the future if the current plan falls short.  
POLICY DISCUSSIONS 
The program objectives remain unchanged from program approval. Policy discussions focused on 
bringing inflation down to the central bank’s target, establishing monetary policy as the main lever for 
demand management in the context of a flexible exchange rate regime, allowing exchange rate flexibility 
to be the first line of policy response to capital inflows and outflows, reducing debt and gross financing 
needs through a revenue-led fiscal consolidation coupled by a comprehensive and cohesive multi-
pronged debt management strategy, containing fiscal risks from off-budget investment and operations of 
Economic Authorities, enhancing the institutional governance framework for state-owned banks, and 
implementing measures to advance the state-ownership policy, fiscal transparency, and leveling the 
playing field across economic agents. The updated Memorandum of Economic and Financial Polices 
(MEFP) reflects the authorities’ commitment to these objectives. 
A.   Exchange Rate and Monetary Policies  
Policy priorities are bringing down inflation, sustaining a flexible exchange rate regime and a liberalized 
FX system, and relying primarily on exchange rate flexibility to manage capital flows. 
16.      Bringing down inflation is the Central Bank of Egypt’s policy priority. The jumbo hike in the 
policy rate on March 6 to 27.25 percent has pushed the policy rate to historic highs, in a significantly 
more aggressive stance than during the 2016–17 stabilization episode (Figure 10); its full impact though 
will be observed with a lag. The growth rate of M2 is also currently lower than the inflation rate, while the 
opposite was true in the 2017 episode. The decrease in headline inflation in April suggests that the 
passthrough from the recent exchange rate depreciation (and appreciation in the parallel market) has 
largely occurred, the impact of FX-related goods shortages have dissipated, and Ramadan-related effects 
have dropped out of food prices. Following a data-dependent approach 


ARAB REPUBLIC OF EGYPT                                                                                         
 
16 
INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND 
informed by three months of consecutive decreases in headline inflation (March, April, and May), the 
CBE’s monetary policy committee held rates unchanged at its May 2024 meeting, judging that the 
current monetary stance 
remains appropriate to place 
inflation on a declining path. In 
addition, given the significant 
reduction in the government’s 
use of CBE overdraft facility, as 
well as the CBE’s sterilization 
efforts associated with FX 
inflows, liquidity conditions are 
also expected to reduce 
inflation pressures. Importantly, 
the CBE is committed to take 
actions if data outturns signal 
deviations from its projected 
inflation path towards 
achieving its target. The MPCC 
bands have been proposed to be tightened relative to the prior review, based on recent inflation 
outturns and revised baseline projection for inflation.  
 
17.      The CBE aims to strengthen its communication strategy and the monetary transmission 
mechanism. The CBE is cognizant of the need to provide market participants adequate guidance in line 
with its commitment to gradually move toward a full-fledged inflation targeting regime. In this context, 
current efforts to refine its measurement of inflation expectations will allow it to strengthen the analytical 
basis for taking rate decisions. The recent adoption of a fixed rate full allotment of its 7-day deposit 
operations will improve the transmission of monetary policy.  
18.      Exchange rate flexibility is a key part of an appropriate policy response to capital inflows 
and outflows. In the case of capital inflows, exchange rate should be allowed to appreciate, once the 
reserve buffers have been rebuilt and official reserves have reached adequate levels, and provided that 
the exchange rate is not overvalued and inflation remains higher than the target level. Capital flow 
management (CFM) measures should not be used to substitute for warranted adjustments in 
macroeconomic policies and reforms, including exchange rate appreciation, reserve accumulation (also 
considering the program’s NIR target and adjusters related to nonresident inflows), fiscal tightening, 
and debt management strategy (e.g., reduce issuance of short-term T-bills). Similarly, in the case of 
capital outflows, exchange rate depreciation would be a key part of adjustment to avoid exacerbating 
external imbalances and allow economic agents to face exchange rate risk, reinforcing the shift to a 
flexible regime where CBE’s foreign exchange interventions are limited to episodes of disorderly 
market conditions. In this context, the program currently includes a volatility-based intervention 
framework that the CBE has not needed to use so far. The authorities agreed that the existing 
intervention framework under the program remains adequate.

(In percent)

B.   Fiscal Policy and Debt Management  
Policy priorities include implementing strong and decisive tax policy changes, particularly related to the 
Value-Added tax (VAT), which are crucial to the success of fiscal consolidation and domestic revenue 
mobilization goals. In addition, continued reduction of untargeted fuel subsidies will also create space for 
high-quality social support measures. Improving the monitoring and execution of public investment, 
including off-budget investment by all state-owned enterprises, will also support macro-economic 
stability. Active debt management should also contribute to reducing gross financing needs and debt. 
 
19.      The authorities are committed to achieve a revenue-based fiscal consolidation with tax 
revenue increasing by 3 percent of GDP over the program period. A key element of the revenue-based 
consolidation strategy is reform of the VAT, which is expected to generate 1.0 percent of GDP in additional 
revenues in a 12-month period, of which 0.2 percent of GDP will be achieved in FY2024/25. The authorities 
have identified 19 VAT exemptions for possible removal out of 58 in the current VAT law and plan to 
submit a package of VAT reforms to parliament by end-November (existing structural benchmark).6 Given 
the significant VAT policy gap in Egypt (about 2.7 percent of GDP), the removal of additional VAT 
exemptions, which are at the heart of the shortfalls associated with the current VAT regime, and other tax 
expenditures identified in the tax expenditure report published in April could yield up to 4.4 percent of 
GDP in additional tax revenue (see MEFP) might be needed to achieve the targeted structural increase in 
medium-term tax revenue.  
20.      In addition, the authorities are studying other options to mobilize domestic resources. These 
include: (i) adopting a carbon tax to support emissions reduction and in light of the implementation of the 
European Union’s (EU) Carbon Border Adjustment Mechanism; (ii) adopting a withholding tax on sales 
from freezones in Egypt to the domestic market; and (iii) participating in the Organization of Economic 
Cooperation and Development’s (OECD) Automatic Exchange of Information (AEOI), on which they 
advanced by completing the Peer Review on Information Exchange on Request of the OECD. Egypt is rated 
as partially compliant to the standard of transparency and exchange of information. The authorities plan to 
address the recommendations raised in the peer review report and provide a self-assessment report by 
2026 to participate AEOI.7 Further, the authorities agreed that new proposals for additional tax incentives 
should be contained, notwithstanding the creation of a freezone within the Ras El-Hekma region, and will 
take advantage of the opportunity to replace the existing fragmented character of corporate income tax 
(CIT) incentives by a transparent, coherent, effective, and efficient framework, solely within the new Income 
Tax Law, which is being drafted with IMF assistance. Relatedly, the authorities will assess the economic

food items, 7 financial related goods and services, 7 education related goods and services, 5 healthcare related goods 
and services, 3 land and housing transactions, and 5 raw materials including crude oil, natural gas, gold, silver, 
electricity, and 11 other services items.  
7 According to the OECD’s report, the total tax return filing rate for registered taxpayers, including legal entities, is low at 
22 percent. To improve tax compliance, the authorities are moving towards digitalization of tax registration and E-filing 
and E-invoicing systems that will strengthen enforcement and supervision to ensure accounting records are in line with 
accounting standards and are available for at least five years.

benefits of the current freezones (existing structural benchmark). To guide tax policy over the medium 
term, the authorities have prepared a draft tax policy strategy document for public comment and debate. 
21.      Higher tax revenues and a reduction in untargeted subsidies would provide more room for 
social protection spending and human capital development. In particular, reducing untargeted fuel 
subsidies, which have increased as a share of GDP in recent years, would create more fiscal space for 
social spending. The authorities have firmly committed to restoring fuel prices to their cost recovery level 
by December 2025. The authorities also raised the subsidized bread price from EGP 0.05 per loaf to EGP 
0.2 per loaf on June 1, 2024.   
22.      The foundation for more targeted and adequate social protection spending exists. The 
authorities have expanded the coverage of the Takaful and Karama cash transfer program to more than 
5 million households and increased the average monthly payments by 45 percent since FY2022/23. The 
social registry has detailed information on 11 million households, which could be assessed for the 
eligibility of cash transfer programs once the results of the new household income survey are available. 
Publication of the latter is a proposed new structural benchmark for end-July 2024. The targeting of food 
subsidies has also improved by removing unqualified individuals and keeping zero growth of the total 
number of beneficiaries. Looking ahead, a steering committee led by the Prime Minister is overseeing a 
consolidation of various social support programs to improve program efficiency by integrating different 
databases and information currently managed by different ministries. A new Social Solidarity and Cash 
Transfer law, which aims at unifying cash transfer programs under Takaful and Karama, has already been 
approved by Egyptian Senate in March 2024 and will be submitted to the House of Representatives,  
23.      The authorities are taking a number of measures to better monitor and control public 
sector activity and fiscal risks, including from public investment.  
• 
The authorities have established a cabinet-level committee chaired by the CAO to gather data, 
analyze, and report on all public investment in Egypt in accordance with Prime Ministerial decree 
No. 739 of 2024. The decree requires all public agencies to report to the committee each September 
and March the implementation amounts and percentages relative to the pre-agreed targets for the 
periods January–June and July–December, respectively. The reports are to be submitted to the Public 
Economic Governance Committee of the Cabinet. The target ceiling under the program on the value 
of total public investment over the period from January–June 2024 is EGP 350 billion and the target 
for FY2024/25 is EGP 1,000 billion (indicative target). 
• 
In line with recent legislated changes, the government submitted to parliament a consolidated 
general government reporting budget that includes all 59 Economic Authorities (EAs), including 
EGPC, along with separate budget proposals for the budget sector and each of the 59 EAs. 
Importantly, the EAs will now be subject to binding ceilings on their debt, adjustment of which will 
require parliamentary approval. The authorities are also making progress in conducting a sector 
classification of the EAs in accordance with the concepts and principles in the Government Finance 
Statistics Manual (GFSM) 2014 (existing structural benchmark) and have requested IMF technical 
assistance to help with the classification exercise. The authorities indicated that removing market 


ARAB REPUBLIC OF EGYPT 
INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND 19 
based EAs from general government fiscal reporting and converting them into public corporations 
could be a lengthy process because it will require legislative changes.  
24.      EGPC poses a considerable fiscal risk to the budget sector as it faces significant liquidity 
issues. Guarantees issued on behalf of EGPC account for about half of government guarantees. A 
series of shocks have undermined EGPC’s financial position. The shocks include foreign exchange 
shortages, downturns in the domestic production of gas and oil, increased subsidies from EGPC to the 
electricity sector, slow adjustment in retail fuel prices, and the depreciation of the exchange rate as 
EGPC has mainly EGP-earning assets but significant U.S. dollar-denominated liabilities. EGPC’s 
operating cashflow is negative and it has accumulated FX payment arrears to international oil 
companies. Domestic banks are requiring government guarantees on all loans to EGPC. The value of 
guarantees issued on behalf of EGPC has increased by about 5 percent of GDP since October 1, 2023, 
due to the impact of the depreciation in the official exchange rate and new guarantees issued by the 
MoF to provide the banking sector with full coverage of any lending risks to EGPC. 
25.      Building on recent measures, the authorities plan a series of actions to improve EGPC’s 
financial situation over time. The authorities raised electricity prices by 7–20 percent in January 2024 
and retail fuel prices in March by 8–20 percent. The authorities have committed to raise retail fuel 
prices, excluding fuel oil sold to the bakeries, and electricity prices until cost recovery levels are 
reached. Moreover, EGPC expects to receive additional foreign currency inflows from export earnings 
of a large refinery it owns, once the refinery becomes fully operational. While its financial position 
gradually improves, EGPC has the capacity to fully service its obligations on time due to an anticipated 
increase of EGP 10-11 billion of monthly revenues from recent and upcoming energy price hikes. With 
most of EGPC domestic liabilities linked to variable rates, anticipated lower interest payments as 
interest rates decrease, and more frequent reimbursement of fuel subsidies bill by the MOF will also 
help. Relatedly, EGPC has developed the contours of a plan to eliminate its arrears to international oil 
companies. Payments earlier this calendar year lowered the arrears balance to about US$5 billion. An 
anticipated payment before the end of FY2023/24 would lower the arrears to around US$3.5–3.8 
billion. 
26.      As a key complement to the fiscal consolidation effort, the authorities are pursuing an 
active debt management strategy to reduce gross financing needs and debt. Public debt is assessed 
as sustainable but not with high probability, and overall risks of sovereign stress are assessed as high 
(Annex II). To reduce gross financing needs, the current baseline already includes the impact of the 
authorities’ earlier agreement with pension funds and insurance funds to extend the maturity of a portion 
of existing debt as well as the agreement with major state banks to issue new three-year T-bonds when 
the existing T-bonds held by those banks mature. The authorities are committed to continue to gradually 
extend the issuance maturity of domestic debt through auction (existing indicative target, see Table 13), 
from 0.52 years at end March to 0.57 years at end-June 2024 (both on a cumulative basis, from the 
beginning of the fiscal year) and to 0.90 years at end-December 2024.  
27.      The authorities are keen to strengthen the broader public debt management function 
with comprehensive reforms along key structural and operational pillars. They see an opportunity 
to indicate a clear break from the past domestic financing operations and signal to the market 


ARAB REPUBLIC OF EGYPT                                                                                         
 
20 
INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND 
accordingly. The overarching commitment is towards phasing out non-market borrowing mechanisms 
(private placements, CBE overdraft) in favor of auctions whose price is determined by market variables. 
The authorities are cognizant that this would entail a cost premium in the short term in favor of 
medium-term capital markets savings. The main reforms are: 
• 
targeting in the medium-term the institutional setup of debt management (reorganization of the 
Debt Management Unit (DMU) along front, middle, and back-office functions), 
• 
the regulatory setup (e.g., harmonizing taxation between resident and non-resident investors),  
• 
domestic debt market development (broadening the investor base and introducing new 
instruments like retail bonds and a revamped primary dealership system that broadens access to 
market participants transparently), and  
• 
improved debt reporting and investor relations.  
28.      As a priority, the DMU will be updating and publishing by December 2024 a medium-term 
debt management strategy as well as undertake other important reforms in the near term. The plan 
will be to articulate a multi-year borrowing plan updated annually and anchored by a portfolio cost and 
risk management framework. The strategy document will include debt portfolio risk tolerance thresholds 
and operational targets, and will cover foreign and domestic debt, cutting across available and potential 
instruments and sources of financing. The revised Primary Dealership setup will be finalized and 
operationalized by end-September 2024. They will improve in the short-term reporting on government 
financing from the domestic market by including information on key domestic financing instruments in the 
current debt reporting framework (including auction results, private placements, and overdraft borrowing). 
They will seek IMF technical assistance where appropriate to help with design, sequencing, and 
implementation of these reforms. 
29.      The recapitalization needs of the CBE should be addressed in an integrated and effective 
manner. While the authorities prepared an initial plan to address the recapitalization needs, a more 
granular and comprehensive quantitative assessment of recapitalization needs over the next five years 
that takes into account both the legacy negative equity and forward-looking income statement dynamics 
is required. In addition, the authorities should prepare a plan for recapitalization that considers both the 
government’s debt management strategy and the need to safeguard CBE balance sheet and its price 
stability mandate. Hence, the structural benchmark on CBE recapitalization is proposed to be reset from 
the original date of April 2024 to August 2024 (reset structural benchmark). 
C.   Financial Sector Policies  
Key issues are ensuring financial stability and strengthening governance practices of state-owned banks. 
 
30.      The financial system appears capable of weathering the initial impact of unification and 
monetary tightening, and strengthening financial sector resilience continues to be a key priority 
for the authorities. The banking system remains on average adequately capitalized and liquidity is 


ARAB REPUBLIC OF EGYPT 
INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND 21 
ample. While banks have remained in compliance with their net open position limits, the CBE, as 
regulator, closely monitors the maturity and composition of banks’ foreign currency assets and 
liabilities, including their exposure to public sector agencies. While banks are reported to remain 
compliant with regulatory limits, foreign currency loans, particularly to public sector entities (Figures 6) 
are not fully matched by foreign currency deposits (particularly on the balance sheets of the biggest 
banks). The CBE also plans to strengthen transparency and communication of financial sector issues, 
including by making better efforts to ensure all public reporting such as the annual financial stability 
report is done on a predictable schedule and without excessive lags.8 Meanwhile, the CBE’s regulatory 
stress tests reportedly point to adequate capital and liquidity buffers under large, combined exchange 
rate and interest rate shocks. To continue testing the resilience of banks, the CBE will complete stress 
tests of the banking sector and share detailed results with IMF staff by end-September 2024 using 
end-March 2024 data; these tests will be prepared in consultation with IMF staff (structural 
benchmark). 
31.      Strengthening governance practices and competition in the banking sector remains a key 
financial sector policy priority. The large presence of state-owned banks in the financial sector 
requires robust governance practices to safeguard financial health of the banking system, ensure a 
robust market-based transmission mechanism for monetary policy, and promote competition by 
levelling the playing field with private banks. To this end, the CBE will commission an independent 
assessment of policies, procedures, and controls of state-owned banks (with CBE and IMF input and 
agreement on terms of reference) by an internationally recognized firm, with the tendering and 
selection process completed by end-October 2024 (proposed new structural benchmark). 
D.   Structural Reform Policies  
The policy focus is on implementing structural measures to advance implementation of the state-
ownership policy including measures to put it on a stronger legal footing, level the playing field among 
economic agents, reduce the state’s economic footprint and thereby provide more room for private sector 
growth, and improve the business climate. 
 
32.      The authorities’ structural reform agenda is centered on implementation of the State-
Ownership Policy (SOP) as a key anchor of program reforms going forward. The authorities sent 
draft legislation to parliament to give key elements of the SOP the force and durability of law, including 
the creation of unit in the Prime Minister’s office with the powers to establish guidelines for the 
governance of state-owned enterprises and to facilitate divestment. They aim to secure passage of the 
legislation before the end of calendar year 2024, and in the interim, will lay the groundwork to establish 
the central unit. The authorities are also making good progress in developing an indicator to monitor 
implementation of the SOP (structural benchmark), which, starting from the next review, would provide a 
way to give better visibility to this critical agenda. Potential elements of the indicator could include 
changes in the share of private sector investment and private sector credit to total investment and total 
 
8 The 2023 Financial Stability Report is currently under compilation and will be published towards the end of calendar 
year 2024. 


ARAB REPUBLIC OF EGYPT                                                                                         
 
22 
INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND 
credit, respectively, and another indicator that reports divestment progress from state-owned enterprises 
operating in non-strategic sectors as defined in the SOP. 
33.      Transparency of state-owned enterprise (SOE) activities is critical to achieving the program 
objective to level the playing field. Greater transparency on SOE sectoral presence, financial situation, 
and financial relations with the government, allows potential investors to better assess the attractiveness 
of investing in a sector. The authorities continue to expand and refine their internal database on SOEs, 
which covers about 80 percent of the known SOEs, and will eventually include all SOEs covered by the 
state-ownership policy. The database will be a key source for preparation of an aggregate annual report 
by end-September 2024 (structural benchmark). The authorities have also taken steps toward meeting a 
forthcoming structural benchmark on the publication of SOE procurement activities. Moreover, the 
authorities plan to publish an annual report containing an evaluation of each divestment undertaken in 
FY2023/24 as envisaged in the SOP.  
34.      Divestment plays an import role in reducing the state’s footprint. The authorities have 
started to implement a more strategic sectoral approach to divestment, based on advice from the 
International Finance Corporation (IFC). Specifically, they are taking steps to enhance the attractiveness 
of aviation, banking, insurance, and telecommunications sectors and thereby the SOEs in those sectors 
to potential investors. While the strategic approach unfolds, the authorities are continuing efforts to 
sell previously identified assets. In FY2023/24, the authorities finalized divestment deals worth 
US$2.2 billion, of which US$2 billion had been captured in the CBE’s FX reserves by end-April 2024. 
35.       The authorities also reaffirmed their commitment to secure the total dollar inflows from 
divestment envisaged at the time of program approval. For FY2024/25, the environment for 
divestment has improved due to greater clarity around the authorities’ policy direction, including more 
certainty for foreign investors in their ability access foreign exchange to repatriate dividends. However, 
the uncertain geopolitical situation in the region and tight global financing conditions could restrain 
investor interest. The authorities are progressing on negotiations to secure the program assumption of 
US$3.6 billion in dollar inflows from divestment, plus another 0.5 percent of GDP in additional 
divestment flows either denominated in EGP or USD.  
36.      Efforts to strengthen the business climate continue. The authorities published earlier this 
year the Executive Regulations implementing the amendment to the Competition Law that was passed 
in December 2022. The amendment empowered the Egyptian Competition Authority (ECA) to control 
mergers that would limit, restrict, or harm the freedom of competition. It also strengthens the ECA’s 
ability to undertake impartial analysis of commercial activity and enforce related decisions including 
those concerning government’s divestment efforts and the impact that such transactions might have 
on competition protection. The ECA has redrafted amendments to the competition law, which were 
initially submitted to Parliament in 2019, to align the independence of the ECA with the independence 
of other regulators with comparable mandates including the CBE and the Financial Regulatory 
Authority (FRA). The redraft also addresses constitutional concerns about the ability of the ECA to issue 
direct administrative sanctions. The amendments are currently undergoing a peer review coordinated 
through the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development and the authorities have 
committed to submit the amendments to parliament by end-October 2024 (proposed structural 


ARAB REPUBLIC OF EGYPT 
INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND 23 
benchmark). Finally, to improve the business environment, the authorities will take a more risk-based 
approach to customs clearance by: 
• 
introducing a “Green Lane” where a percentage of the cargo associated with low risk and 
compliant companies will be released immediately without any controls (proposed new structural 
benchmark); and 
• 
integrating risk-based control between Customs Authority, Export and Import Control Authority, 
National Food Safety Authority, Agricultural and Veterinary Quarantines to reduce the number of 
containers needed to be inspected and thus, reduce the clearance procedures and time of goods 
in ports (proposed new structural benchmark). 
EXTENDED FUND FACILITY PROGRAM MODALITIES 
37.      The Fund-supported program is fully financed. The total financing needed to reach the 
revised net international reserve targets is US$7.7 billion and US$6.8 billion for FY2023/24 and 
FY2024/25, respectively, excluding IMF purchases (Table 11). The authorities have secured firm 
financing commitments for the next 12 months from international partners to close the gap and there 
are good prospects of adequate financing for the reminder of the program period. Assurances also 
remain in place that US$19 billion of official deposits from Arab countries at the CBE will not be 
withdrawn until after the expiration of the EFF arrangement in September 2026 unless they are used 
for the purchase of equities, with the FX proceeds of such sales of equity expected to remain in CBE’s 
foreign reserve assets. The divestment strategy will continue to provide external financing, but with a 
more backloaded profile. The projected asset sales are US$2.8 billion and US$3.6 billion for FY2023/24 
and FY2024/25, respectively. Divestment in FY2023/24 is highly likely to fall short of projections, but 
the authorities are committed to making up the difference during the program period to achieve the 
full divestment envelope of about US$8.7 billion established at the time of program approval. With 
several Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) partners having publicly communicated their support for 
Egypt’s reform program, financing from the European Union, the World Bank and other international 
partners, a substantial pipeline of identified state assets (i.e., the authorities have publicly indicated 
that over 200 SOEs are available for divestment), and with smaller financing gaps in the outer years, 
staff assesses that there are good prospects for the remainder of the arrangement to be fully financed, 
including through multilateral support, additional external issuances, and larger policy adjustments if 
needed.  
38.      The authorities have requested a modification of program conditionality to reflect recent 
developments and to maintain reform momentum. The QPCs for end-June 2024 on NIR and the 
primary balance and QPCs for end-December 2024 on NIR and CBE lending to government agencies are 
proposed to be revised in light of recent developments and new information. The QPC on the budget 
sector’s primary balance would be updated, mainly due to the change in the exchange rate assumption 
for converting FX-denominated divestment proceeds into EGP equivalent, while the changes to the QPC 
on NIR reflect higher-than-anticipated portfolio flows since completion of the 1st and 2nd reviews (in 


ARAB REPUBLIC OF EGYPT                                                                                         
 
24 
INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND 
addition to new preliminary BOP outturns for FY23/24: Q3 and GIR and NIR data as of end-April 2024).9 
Further, the continuous QPC on the balance of CBE lending to public agencies excluding the MOF would 
be updated to reflect the latest plan and commitment by the authorities to reduce it over time. Finally, the 
MPCC upper outer band for end-December 2024 would be lowered relative to the previous review to 
maintain ambition in ensuring policy settings that are consistent with a continued decline in inflation. The 
fourth review is expected to be completed on or after September 15, 2024, and the fifth review is 
expected to be completed on or after March 15, 2025, based on end-June 2024 and end-December 2024 
performance criteria, respectively. 
39.      The authorities have requested several changes to structural benchmarks in the program, 
including adding six new benchmarks—the majority focused on structural reforms. A firm 
commitment by the authorities to reach cost recovery levels for retail fuel prices by December 2025 
would temporarily replace application of the retail fuel indexation mechanism in the related structural 
benchmark. The structural benchmark on CBE recapitalization would be rephased from end-April 2024 
to end-August 2024 and modified to be more specific about the benchmark requirements. The 
structural benchmark on publishing CAO audits of fiscal accounts would be rephased from end-March 
2024 to end-November 2024 and modified to be more specific about the benchmark requirements. 
The structural benchmark on publication of procurement contracts by SOEs would be modified to 
indicate the entity websites on which the reports will be published. The structural benchmark on bank 
stress tests would be modified to be more specific about the benchmark requirements. Staff proposes 
six new structural benchmarks (Table 2 of the MEFP) including an independent risk management 
assessment of state-owned banks, publication of household income survey, publication of the CAO 
audit of the FY2022/23 fiscal accounts, and two benchmarks on customs. Staff proposes to add a data 
requirement on reporting of guarantees.  
40.      Capacity to repay the Fund is adequate but subject to risks and contingent on full program 
implementation and the materialization of all projected financing. Egypt is the Fund’s second largest 
exposure in the General Resources Account. Fund credit outstanding as a share of gross international 
reserves is projected to reach 34 percent in FY2023/24 and decline by the end of the Fund-supported 
program, as repayments are made on credit outstanding under the 2016 Extended Fund Facility, the 2020 
Rapid Financing Instrument, and the 2020 Stand-By Arrangement. Fund obligations as a share of gross 
reserves and of exports are expected to peak at 13 percent and at 10 percent, respectively, in FY2024/25 
(See Table 10). Egypt’s stock of gross and net international reserves exceeds its obligations to the Fund, 
providing a buffer for repayments. Moreover, the composition of reserves has improved with the 
conversion of US$11 billion in UAE dollar deposits at the central bank into EGP-equivalent deposits. More 
generally, improvements in the fiscal and external positions are expected to ensure Egypt's market 
access—a narrowing of sovereign spreads has been already observed—and adequate capacity to repay. 
 
9 As per the TMU, and upward adjustor to the NIR applies to any flow T-bills denominated in local currency held by 
non-residents above program projections (by 50 percent of the excess), with a one-month lag. The lag is aimed to 
provide sufficient time for the CBE to respond to these deviations. Hence, the surge in T-bills held by non-residents 
observed in March 2024 is not captured by the NIR adjustor for this review, but it affects future program targets as it 
resulted in a higher projection for net portfolio flows for the quarter that ends in June 2024, and a resulting increase in 
the NIR targets for the end-June 2024 test date, and subsequent targets, relative to the 1st and 2nd reviews.   


ARAB REPUBLIC OF EGYPT 
INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND 25 
Risks that could affect capacity to repay include a significant structural decline in Suez Canal receipts, 
policy slippages that could lead to higher trade deficits and disruptive capital outflows, and 
materialization of significant contingent liabilities from state-owned enterprises.  
41.      Enterprise risks stem from the size of credit exposure and risks to program implementation. 
Financial risk to the Fund is expected to decline gradually as overall exposure will decrease over the 
medium term. On the business side, the program attempts to tackle long-standing structural challenges 
such as sustaining a flexible exchange rate system and delivering a withdrawal of the state—broadly 
defined—from economic activity to allow the private sector to flourish. This will remain a challenging 
aspect of the program, and failure to advance on the structural reform agenda to boost growth within the 
remainder of the program horizon would generate reputational risks to the EFF arrangement, even if it 
succeeds in delivering economic stabilization.  
42.      Safeguards assessment. Further progress is needed on implementation of the 2023 safeguards 
assessment recommendations. The commitment to conduct a more comprehensive assessment of the 
CBE’s recapitalization needs should be coupled with full implementation of Egyptian Accounting 
Standards (EAS). In addition, other outstanding safeguards recommendations, including establishing an 
agreement that regularizes the use of the 2021 SDR allocation for fiscal purposes should be implemented. 
STAFF APPRAISAL 
43.      The strengthened reform package underlying the EFF-supported program is beginning to 
yield positive results. The unification of the exchange rate together with the accompanying monetary 
policy tightening have curtailed speculation, brought in foreign inflows, and have moderated price 
growth, with inflation falling in March, April, and May and reaching its lowest since January 2023. 
Borrowing terms have improved in recent T-bill auctions. The proceeds from the Ras El-Hekma deal 
have facilitated a significant reduction in the overdraft facility at the CBE to legal limits and a significant 
boost to gross reserves. Private sector growth should be poised for a rebound, even if available data still 
points to weakness in activity. 
44.      Current policy settings are appropriate. Following hikes in key policy rates by a cumulative 
800 basis points in 2024: Q1, the current monetary stance remains appropriate to place inflation on a 
declining trend. A tight monetary policy will remain necessary to ensure a sustained decline in 
underlying inflation. The purchase of proceeds from the Ras El-Hekma transaction for the purposes of 
reserve accumulation have been fully sterilized. Fiscal tightening continues, albeit currently tilted toward 
non-interest expenditure adjustment. Central to achieving consistency in the macroeconomic policy mix, 
the process established under Prime Ministerial Decree 739 of 2024 for establishing a more 
comprehensive management of the overall public investment portfolio is moving ahead, with the first 
submission by all public entities outlining projected investment for FY2024/25 as planned in April. 
45.      As stressed conditions have receded, the authorities’ commitment to strengthening the 
public debt management function and overhauling government borrowing is welcome. The main 
structural and operational reforms would target the institutional setup of debt management, the 


ARAB REPUBLIC OF EGYPT

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND 
regulatory setup, domestic debt market development, and better debt reporting and investor relations. 
Near term priorities – operationalizing the revised Primary Dealership setup by end-September 2024 
and updating and publishing by December 2024 a medium-term debt management strategy—are 
achievable. Prioritizing domestic financing via market mechanisms (auctions), effectively phasing out of 
the short-term recourse to private placements and limiting recourse to the overdraft facility at the CBE 
to within the statutory limit will significantly improve the quality and transparency of the financing mix.  
46.      New forward-looking commitments in the financial sector intend to boost financial 
stability. The financial sector has shown resilience to macroeconomic shocks, including to the needed 
sharp adjustments in the exchange rate and policy rates. A near-term stress test of the banking sector 
will enable banks to properly anticipate and mitigate future risks. A comprehensive forward-looking 
assessment of CBE recapitalization needs is needed to inform a recapitalization plan that considers 
both the central bank balance sheet soundness—thus ensuring the ability to deliver on a sustained 
decline in inflation—and the government’s debt management strategy. The commitment to 
commission an independent assessment of state banks’ policies, procedures, and controls by an 
internationally recognized firm will help enhance governance practices and economic outcomes in the 
state-dominated banking sector.  
47.      Efforts to bolster the legal framework around the implementation of the state-ownership 
policy are welcome. The authorities have sent draft legislation to parliament to embed key elements of 
the state-ownership policy into law, in part through legislating the creation of unit in the Prime 
Minister’s office with the powers to establish guidelines for the governance of state-owned enterprises 
and to facilitate divestment. Work is progressing on developing an indicator to track implementation of 
the state-ownership policy, to be delivered at the next review, which should allow for transparent 
monitoring of progress in this critical area.  
48.      Looking forward, delivering on the pillars of the program and shoring up EGPC’s 
financial position will continue to require significant political effort. Moving forward with an 
ambitious VAT reform in November is crucial to avoiding the risk of a largely expenditure-based 
consolidation and compromising the domestic revenue mobilization goals of the program. More 
ambitious tax reforms may also be necessary to meet program objectives. Near-term tangible 
deliverables on commitments to leveling the playing field and reducing the role of the state will be 
needed to enhance the credibility of the structural reform agenda. In light of the importance of 
reducing fiscal financing needs, priority should be given to channeling more public resources to this 
effort—these resources could come from decisions to increase the share of divestment proceeds going 
to the Treasury but also from redirecting own resources of public sector entities to meet such priority 
needs. A strong plan of action will be needed to mitigate significant fiscal risks associated with SOEs in 
the energy sector, especially EGPC. While the authorities are confident that their reform plans, 
especially the planned restoring retail fuel prices to their cost recovery levels by December 2025, will 
strengthen the financial position of EGPC, further efforts will be needed to limit operational losses, 
improve the commercial orientation of SOEs in the energy sector, and strictly limit excessive recourse 
to government guarantees.

49.      Staff supports the authorities’ requests for waivers of nonobservance and applicability of 
QPC and recommends completion of the required monetary policy consultation and the 
completion of the third review under the EFF arrangement. The nonobservance of the weekly 
criterion on overdraft borrowing between April 18 and May 23 was temporary and corrective action 
has been taken. Staff supports the request for waivers of applicability of the end-June QPCs on net 
international reserve and primary fiscal balance as the data to assess performance on these QPCs 
would not be available by the time of the Board meeting in early July, and there is no evidence that 
these QPCs would not be met and program performance appears to be broadly on track. The attached 
Letter of Intent (LOI) and MEFP present a strong set of policies and the authorities’ commitment to 
pursue the objectives of the strengthened Fund-supported program.

1/ Debt coverage in this table is for the budget sector. The main difference between this table and the debt perimeter in the SRDSF is the treatment of official 
creditor deposits at the central bank (this table does not include these while the SRDSF includes these). This table is based on the information provided by the 
authorities in Egyptian Pound, and IMF staff converted it to the US dollar. The information missing due to data availability will be collected in future program 
reviews.
2/ Debt service on existing debt at end-FY22/23.
3/ Multilateral creditors are simply institutions with more than one official shareholder and may not necessarily align with creditor classification under other IMF 
policies (e.g. Lending Into Arrears)
4/ Debt is collateralized when the creditor has rights over an asset or revenue stream that would allow it, if the borrower defaults on its payment obligations, to 
rely on the asset or revenue stream to secure repayment of the debt. Collateralization entails a borrower granting liens over specific existing assets or future 
receivables to a lender as security against repayment of the loan. Collateral is “unrelated” when it has no relationship to a project financed by the loan. An 
example would be borrowing to finance the budget deficit, collateralized by oil revenue receipts. See the joint IMF-World Bank note for the G20 “Collateralized 
Transactions: Key Considerations for Public Lenders and Borrowers” for a discussion of issues raised by collateral.

Annex I. Risk Assessment Matrix1
 
1 The Risk Assessment Matrix (RAM) shows events that could materially alter the baseline path (the scenario most 
likely to materialize in the view of IMF staff). The relative likelihood of risks is the staff’s subjective assessment of the 
risks surrounding the baseline (“low” is meant to indicate a probability below 10 percent, “medium” a probability 
between 10 and 30 percent, and “high” a probability between 30 and 50 percent). The RAM reflects staff views on the 
source of risks and overall level of concern as of the time of discussions with the authorities. Non-mutually exclusive 
risks may interact and materialize jointly.

2/
Public debt is assessed as sustainable but not with high probability. 
This is based on high risks related to gross financing needs, while 
considering the mitigating impact from the country’s track record of 
sustaining high gross financing needs, supported by stable 
financing by domestic banks, as well as the mitigating impact from 
the Ras El-Hekma deal.
The overall risks of sovereign stress are assessed as high, based on 
the medium term and long term risk assessments below.
Not applicable
Long-term risks are assessed as moderate, as the debt ratio and 
gross financing needs are projected to trend downwards with 
sustained primary surpluses and favorable interest-growth 
differentials, while there are risks to public debt related to pension 
and health cost.
Medium-term risks are assessed as high, given the risk signals from 
the debt fanchart module and the GFN module. The high risk signal 
from the GFN module reflects high average gross financing needs 
over the forecast horizon related to large issuances of short-term 
bills and the large claims of domestic banks on the government. 
Contingent liability related to publicly-guaranteed debt (EGP4,311 
billion as of March 2024) poses significant medium-term risks.

DSA Summary Assessment
Commentary: Public debt is assessed as sustainable but not with high probability, and overall risks of sovereign 
stress are assessed as high. Over the medium term, risks are assessed as high, given the risk signals from the 
GFN module and the debt fanchart modules. The GFN module signals a high risk, given high average gross 
financing needs over the medium term and the large claims of the domestic banks on the government. 
Contingent liability related to publicly-guaranteed debt poses significant medium-term risks. Over the long 
term, risks are assessed as moderate, as the debt ratio and gross financing needs are projected to trend 
downwards. The sustainability assessment considers the the risk mitigating impact from the country’s track 
record of sustaining high gross financing needs, supported by stable financing by domestic banks, as well as 
the mitigating impact from the Ras El-Hekma deal.
Source: Fund staff.
Note: The risk of sovereign stress is a broader concept than debt sustainability. Unsustainable debt can only be 
resolved through exceptional measures (such as debt restructuring). In contrast, a sovereign can face stress 
without its debt necessarily being unsustainable, and there can be various measures—that do not involve a 
debt restructuring—to remedy such a situation, such as fiscal adjustment and new financing.
1/ The near-term assessment is not applicable in cases where there is a disbursing IMF arrangement. In 
surveillance-only cases or in cases with precautionary IMF arrangements, the near-term assessment is performed 
but not published.
2/ A debt sustainability assessment is optional for surveillance-only cases and mandatory in cases where there is 
a Fund arrangement. The mechanical signal of the debt sustainability assessment is deleted before publication. 
In surveillance-only cases or cases with IMF arrangements with normal access, the qualifier indicating probability 
of sustainable debt ("with high probability" or "but not with high probability") is deleted before publication.

Commentary: Public debt is mainly domestic, held by domestic banks, and in local currency, and it is subject to local law. Debt 
is primarily in marketable instruments, including a large share of T-bills. This results in a relatively short maturity of public debt.

Extended projection
Contribution to change in public debt
(percent of GDP)
Commentary: After increasing in FY2022/23 and FY2023/24 (2023 and 2024 in the table and the chart) mainly due to exchange rate depreciation 
(for 2024 this is captured by the residual), public debt is projected to be on a downward trend, with sustained primary surpluses and favorable 
interest-rate growth differential.

Commentary: Analysis from the realism tools does not signal major concerns. The forecast error track record does not signal a 
pattern of optimistic forecast errors. Debt drivers are projected to largely follow the past experience. While 3-year debt reduction is 
above 75th percentile, the primary balance surplus contributes to debt reduction in the next five years by more than the last five 
years, and the baseline growth projection is higher than that suggested by the multiplier tool, these are due to recovery from the 
COVID crisis. The growth projection over the medium term is above the past average, but the latter is affected by several country-
specific and global shocks during that period.

Commentary: Medium-term risks are assessed as high, given the risk signals from the debt fanchart and GFN modules. The high risk signal 
from the GFN module reflects high average gross financing needs and the large claims of the domestic banking sector on the government. 
Contingent liability related to publicly-guaranteed debt (EGP4,311 billion as of March 2024) poses significant medium-term risks.

Commentary for Long-term risk analysis: Long-term risks are assessed as moderate, as the debt ratio and gross financing needs are projected to 
trend downwards with sustained primary surpluses and favorable interest-growth differentials, while there are risks to public debt related to pension 
and health cost.

Annex III. Monetary Policy Consultation 
 
Consultation on Breach of MPCC Target in March 2024. 
Central Bank of Egypt 
The urban headline inflation rate recorded 33.3 percent in March 2024, which falls outside the 3–27 percent 
band agreed upon under the Extended Fund Facility (EFF) concluded in March 2024. This document explains 
the reasons why inflation has breached the upper limit of the inflation consultation band, and then 
discusses policy responses and inflation outlook.  
Inflation Deviation from the Consultation Band 
1.      
Inflation spiked in February. Annual urban headline inflation spiked to 35.7 percent in 
February 2024 from 29.8 percent in January. This came on the back of elevated monthly dynamics. In 
particular, greater-than-anticipated demand pressures related to seasonal effects on food (including 
Ramadan) as well as an increase in education prices (delayed from October 2023 to February 2024), 
in addition to the unexpectedly large depreciation in the parallel market in January, which passed 
through swiftly to domestic prices in February, all pushed inflation upwards in early 2024. Impacted 
by the same dynamics, annual core inflation recorded 29.0 and 35.1 percent in January and February 
2024, respectively.  
 
2.      
Following the February outturn, inflation eased in March but the upper limit of the 
inflation consultation band was still breached. Annual urban headline and core inflation eased to 
33.3 percent and 33.7 percent in March 2024, respectively. This comes as monthly dynamics returned 
to their historical trend instead of increasing following the official exchange rate depreciation on 
March 6, 2024. Nonetheless, the decision to unify the official and parallel foreign exchange markets 
availed foreign exchange liquidity, allowing for the clearance of import backlogs, and the alleviation 
of market uncertainty around the future path of the exchange rate. Thus, the March 2024 inflation 
outturn reflected a muted exchange rate impact and confirmed the notion that the impact of the 
sharp depreciation in the parallel market in January had already passed through to domestic prices in 
February 2024. The exchange rate accounted for 10 percent of monthly headline inflation in March 
2024, compared to 25 percent in February 2024. Hence, the March 6 exchange rate unification served 
as a corrective measure, with little-to-no inflationary impact on prices. 
3.  
Furthermore, the decline in March’s annual inflation rate was driven by subdued price 
increases across the board. The annual slowdown was mainly driven by declining annual food 
inflation, which recorded 45.0 percent in March 2024, its lowest rate since December 2022. This may 
also signal a gradual easing of the food inflation shock, which peaked at 73.6 percent annually in 
September 2023. Additionally, the supply shocks’ contribution to March 2024’s inflation outturn has 
completely abated compared to the sizable (around 30 percent) contribution in February 2024’s 
inflation outturn. In particular, supply shocks fed through to the prices of core food items, as monthly 
core food inflation declined from 19.8 percent in February 2024 to 1.4 percent in March 2024.

4.  
In addition to the previously mentioned inflation developments, the Government 
adopted fiscal measures, such as increasing: (1) electricity prices for both residential and 
commercial use (between 7 and 20 percent across various categories) in January 2024, (2) public 
transportation prices (i.e., railway and metro fares) in January 2024, (3) prices of home landline phone 
contracts (January 2024), (4) the regulated prices of other commodities and services such as medical 
care, and (5) the prices of domestic fuel products through the Fuel Automatic Pricing Mechanism in 
March 2024. These measures added inflationary pressures to March 2024’s monthly headline 
inflation, contributing 7.0 percent through the regulated items’ component.  
Policy Responses 
5.  
This section describes the monetary policy actions taken since March 2022 and their 
transmission to the economy. It also sheds light on the CBE’s monetary policy reaction function 
and the main indicators used to assess the developments in the Egyptian economy. The CBE 
commenced its monetary policy tightening cycle as of March 2022. Monetary policy tools are utilized 
to anchor inflation expectations, and to contain demand-side pressures and second-round effects 
emanating from supply shocks. Decisive countermeasures have been adopted, which included raising 
key policy rates cumulatively by 1900 bps since March 2022 (800 bps in 2022, 300 bps in 2023, and 
800 bps in 2024 Q1). In addition, the reserve requirement ratio was raised in September 2022 from 
14 to 18 percent to complement the tightening stance. Moreover, monetary policy transmission was 
strengthened through phasing out subsidized lending schemes (CBE initiatives) and increasing the 
volume of liquidity absorption, by carrying out the main operation through a fixed rate operation 
with full allotment at the mid-corridor rate.  
6.  
According to CBE assumptions, the cumulative impact of interest rate tightening on 
the real economy peaks after three quarters, consistent with the lag with which monetary 
policy operates. The impact of tightening the policy stance was contractionary on the real economy, 
namely on gross domestic investments, slowing down real GDP growth in the first half of FY 2023/24. 
As such, real GDP growth registered 2.5 percent compared to 4.2 percent during the corresponding 
period of FY 2022/23. Gross domestic investments have been contracting for six consecutive quarters 
as of 2022 Q3, with the contraction mainly driven by the declining contribution of public investments 
throughout FY 2022/23, compared to the previous year. Additionally, private investments have also 
been contracting, albeit at a slower pace, reflecting the cumulative impact of the tightening cycle 
since 2022 Q1, the lag with which monetary policy operates, and its indirect impact on the declining 
real growth of private business sector loans in local currency. 
7.  
The cumulative tightening of key policy rates by 800 bps in 2024 Q1 aims to fast-track 
the disinflation path, by bringing the real interest rate into positive territory. Thus, ensuring a 
sustained decline in underlying inflation and anchoring inflation expectations. The CBE remains 
steadfastly committed to achieving price stability through targeting single-digit inflation, whilst 
assessing the cumulative impact of monetary policy tightening on the prevailing and forecasted 
monetary policy stance.  


ARAB REPUBLIC OF EGYPT

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND 
8.  
Additionally, it should be noted that the CBE's key policy rates are used in accordance 
with a monetary policy reaction function. The CBE reaction function aims to minimize both 
deviations of expected inflation from its target levels, and deviations of expected real economic 
activity from the level considered consistent with full capacity utilization. Accordingly, monetary 
policy decisions are data-driven through monitoring all economic, monetary, and financial 
developments. This is done by tracking a wide range of domestic and global indicators1 to analyze 
the nature, persistence, and breadth of any shocks. This comes in addition to examining the changes 
in international commodity prices and global financial conditions, as well as political developments.  
Inflation Outlook 
9.  
Recent inflation outturns signal the return of monthly dynamics to their usual trend 
prior to March 2022. The CBE's forecast suggests that inflation has peaked and going forward, 
assuming the absence of external shocks, inflation is expected to moderate in 2024, as inflationary 
pressures begin to subside. A significant decline in inflation is anticipated in 2025 Q1 due to the 
combined impact of monetary policy tightening, subsiding impact of previously existing market 
imbalances and a favorable base effect. This is consistent with the monetary policy tightening cycle, 
especially following the cumulative 800-bps policy rate hikes in 2024 Q1.  
10.  
Favorable base effects from the previous year will support annual rates in the near-term 
along with the decline in the underlying trend of inflation. Furthermore, real GDP growth is 
expected to slow down during the current FY 2023/24, in line with the witnessed tightening and the lag 
with which monetary policy operates. Moreover, while M2 growth has accelerated in March 2024, to 
record 25.4 percent following the depreciation of the Egyptian pound, M2 growth (excl. revaluation) 
has declined to reach 10.7 percent in March 2024, compared to 16.5 percent in the previous month, 
and well below M2’s historical average of 15 percent. This points to an acceleration of the monetary 
aggregate solely due to revaluation effects. Additionally, the M2-Real GDP growth differential has been 
narrowing down for four consecutive quarters, recording an average of 17.3 percent in 2024 Q1, 
compared to 25.9 percent in 2023 Q1. In light of the decelerating M2 growth (excl. revaluation) and the 
narrowing M2-Real GDP growth differential, money creation dynamics point towards easing 
inflationary pressures from the money creation side, which has supported the decline in inflation rates 
in the 2023 Q4 and 2024 Q1. These money creation dynamics are expected to continue, consistent with 
the forecasted inflation trajectory.  
11.  
However, there remains to be upside risks to the forecasted disinflation path, including 
an escalation of the current geopolitical tensions, which could lead to higher international 
commodity prices and negative spillovers on services. Other upside risks may include higher than 
expected fiscal consolidation measures; unfavorable climate conditions domestically and 
internationally leading to higher food and commodity prices; and a higher-for-longer tightening of 
global financial conditions.

of M2 growth, and real credit growth to the private sector.

12.  
Nevertheless, in light of the aforementioned risks and macroeconomic developments, 
both globally and domestically, annual inflation rates will more likely deviate from the 
announced target of 7 percent (± 2 p.p.) on average in 2024 Q4. An explanation for deviation will 
be clearly communicated with the stakeholders along with the likely path of inflation to return to 
single digits in order to enhance credibility and transparency, in line with the transition to an inflation 
targeting regime. The CBE will ensure that the monetary policy stance is set at levels to anchor 
inflation expectations, rein in inflationary pressures and thus, place inflation on a sustained declining 
trajectory.

Appendix I. Letter of Intent 
 
June 25, 2024 
Ms. Kristalina Georgieva 
 
 
 
Managing Director 
International Monetary Fund 
700 19th Street, NW 
Washington, D.C. 20431 
 
Dear Ms. Georgieva: 
Our economic program under the Extended Fund Facility (EFF) remains on track. We have sustained 
the shift to a flexible exchange rate regime and a liberalized foreign exchange (FX) system, 
maintained an appropriately tight monetary policy stance aimed at reducing inflation, continued with 
fiscal consolidation, implemented social protection measures, and have begun implementing the 
framework for slowing down overall public investment. These measures, combined with the 
augmentation of our EFF program and the recent investment deal in the Ras El-Hekma region, have 
helped improve FX liquidity and restore confidence. 
However, risks surrounding our economic outlook remain significant. These include negative 
spillovers from the conflict in Gaza—posing challenges for growth, fiscal and external balances—
elevated inflation despite the recent slowdown, high levels of government debt and debt service 
despite fiscal consolidation, and subdued private sector activity despite early signs of improvements. 
In this context, we remain committed to implementing the policies under the program, as outlined in 
the attached Memorandum of Economic and Financial Policies (MEFP) to ensure that we maintain 
macroeconomic stability, rebuild buffers, reduce vulnerabilities, and pave the way for an acceleration 
of private sector-led growth. 
Looking forward, to durably improve our fiscal position and create space for high-quality 
expenditure, we remain committed to mobilizing revenues and reducing untargeted subsidies. Such 
efforts include submitting to parliament amendments to the VAT law later this year to rationalize 
exemptions and our firm commitment to reduce fuel subsidies by restoring fuel prices to their cost 
recovery levels by December 2025. We will take additional steps to protect vulnerable groups of the 
population, especially in light of shocks to households’ purchasing power in a high inflation 
environment. To reduce very high financing needs, we will complement fiscal consolidation efforts 
with a stronger debt management strategy. We will continue to push forward with our divestment 
strategy, and ensure sufficient resources are transferred to the treasury to reduce financing needs.  
We anticipate that the combined impact of recent monetary policy tightening, unification of the 
foreign exchange market, and favorable base effects, as well as increasing domestic and foreign 
demand for Egyptian pound denominated assets will contribute significantly to price stability. 


ARAB REPUBLIC OF EGYPT 
 
 
INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND 
63 
Nonetheless, bringing down inflation is a key policy priority, and we will not hesitate to utilize all 
tools at our disposal to ensure that the policy stance allows for a sustained decrease in underlying 
inflation and safeguards price stability over the medium term. 
To ensure better management of macroeconomic pressures, we have started the implementation of 
a comprehensive monitoring framework for the overall public investment portfolio. We have 
expanded substantially the perimeter of general government fiscal reporting to track broader fiscal 
activities and to better manage fiscal risks. We will also establish a repayment strategy for the EGPC’s 
arrears to international oil companies, and we commit to reduce the stock of government guarantees 
as a ratio of GDP. 
The financial sector has shown resilience to macroeconomic shocks. To safeguard financial stability, 
we will conduct a near-term stress test of the banking sector. Also, to support stronger governance 
practices, we will commission an independent assessment of state banks’ policies, procedures, and 
controls by an internationally recognized firm. 
On the structural reform front, we are developing an indicator to track implementation of the state-
ownership policy, particularly as it pertains to reducing the state’s footprint in a number of economic 
sectors. We will modify trade procedures to improve the business climate and continue with efforts 
to further strengthen the Egyptian Competition Authority. 
Based on the strength of the policies that are described above and set forth in the attached MEFP, 
we request completion of the third review of the arrangement, with the purchase of SDR 618.11 
million. The program remains fully financed. We request Executive Board approval of: (i) waiver of 
non-observance of the weekly ceiling on the government’s overdraft account at the CBE, on account 
of the temporary deviation which has been corrected as of May 30 , and (ii) waivers of non-
applicability of the end-June program targets for net international reserves and the primary balance. 
We also request approval of modifications to the quantitative performance criteria for future 
program reviews in light of developments and new information since the previous review. The 
requested modifications reflect the strengthened commitment to reduce the size of the CBE balance 
sheet as an important element underpinning our inflation stabilization plan and larger NIR balances 
following higher-than-anticipated inflows after unification of the exchange rate. We also request 
approval of completion of the Monetary Policy Consultation with the Executive Board. We met five 
out of ten structural benchmarks for the review and have proposed new timeframes to meet most of 
the outstanding commitments. 
While we are confident that the policies that underpin our program ensure macroeconomic stability 
and achievement of our program objectives, we stand ready to take additional measures, as 
necessary. In accordance with the Fund's policies, we will consult with the IMF on adoption of such 
measures and in advance of revisions to policies contained in the MEFP. We will refrain from any 
policy that would not be consistent with program objectives and commitments. 
The program will continue to be monitored through quantitative performance criteria, indicative 
targets, and structural benchmarks, as described in the MEFP and Technical Memorandum of 


ARAB REPUBLIC OF EGYPT

Understanding (TMU). The fourth review is expected to be completed on or after September 15, 
2024, and the fifth review will be completed on or after March 15, 2025. We will continue our efforts 
to provide timely and accurate data that are needed for program monitoring. We will provide any 
information that has material impact on economic conditions and program objectives. This includes 
information on the development plan of the Ras El-Hekma region once relevant plans have been 
finalized and submitted by Abu Dhabi Development Holding Company (ADQ), the investor with the 
development rights to the region. We will maintain a close regular dialogue with IMF staff to ensure 
timely implementation of our economic program. We will consult IMF staff before making any policy 
changes that impact our economic program with the IMF. 
We consent to the IMF’s publication of this letter, the MEFP, the TMU, and the accompanying 
Executive Board documents.

Attachment I. Memorandum of Economic and Financial Policies 
 
Introduction 
1. 
With significant policy actions and stronger policy commitments, our EFF program is 
back on track and market confidence has returned. Since the policy actions we took in March to 
restore macroeconomic stability including a broad-based increase in fuel prices, we have maintained 
a flexible exchange rate regime and a liberalized foreign exchange system, which will help prevent a 
reemergence of external imbalances and foreign exchange shortages. The latest round of monetary 
policy rate hikes is expected to be sufficient to bring inflation down towards our inflation target, but 
we stand ready to take further action as necessary to secure this goal. Combined with continued 
tight fiscal policies aimed at preserving debt sustainability, the slowed down implementation of 
public investment, as well as the substantial improvement in foreign currency liquidity from the 
US$35 billion investment deal with Abu Dhabi Developmental Holding Company (ADQ), these policy 
actions and commitments helped Egypt regain market confidence and alleviate near-term balance of 
payments pressures. In particular, nonresident holdings of domestic treasury securities increased by 
around $15 billion, the domestic financing situation improved significantly, and net foreign asset 
positions of both the Central Bank of Egypt and commercial banks increased. As committed, we used 
part of the proceeds from the US$35 billion deal to reduce government borrowing needs and 
government domestic debt and boost reserves to lock in the improvement in fundamentals. 
2. 
However, we still face large uncertainty in economic outlook. Negative spillovers from 
the conflict in Gaza and Israel have become more pronounced due to associated trade disruption in 
the Red Sea and the notable reduction in Suez Canal receipts. These have reduced key sources of 
foreign exchange inflows and fiscal revenues. The inflation rate remains high, but has been slowing 
down in recent months, possibly reflecting the positive impact that the unification of the exchange 
rate market had on stabilizing the foreign exchange market, thereby anchoring inflation expectations 
and normalizing pricing behavior in the market and improvements in foreign exchange liquidity, as 
well as the past monetary policy rate hikes. Government debt and gross financing needs continue to 
be elevated, due to exchange rate adjustments, successive and significant interest rates hikes 
contributing to elevate borrowing costs, and intentional reliance on short-term domestic financing to 
avoid locking in high debt service cost for extended period. Private sector activity remains weak, yet 
with recent policy adjustments and future reforms a recovery is expected. 
3. 
In this context, we are committed to continue implementing commitments under the 
EFF to maintain macroeconomic stability and enhance private-sector led growth. We are firmly 
committed to sustaining a flexible exchange rate regime and a liberalized foreign exchange system 
to avoid a buildup of external imbalances and foreign exchange shortages. We will maintain the 
monetary policy stance until we have firm evidence of inflation slowdown and will adjust it in a data-
dependent manner to achieve our inflation target and further anchor inflation expectations. We will 
implement a primarily revenue-based fiscal consolidation to sustainably realize adequate primary 
surpluses, to maintain a downward debt trajectory, and to reduce gross financing needs, supported 


ARAB REPUBLIC OF EGYPT

by an active debt management strategy to be further enhanced and adjusted according to market 
dynamics. We will transparently and rigorously implement the new framework to monitor and 
control overall public investment and to that end we issued and published prime ministerial decree 
number 739 of 2024 and started implementing it. All together, these policy and reform measures will 
more effectively manage aggregate demand and minimize sovereign risks. As macroeconomic 
stability takes hold, we will more forcefully implement our structural reform agenda, including the 
divestment program, gradually withdrawing the state and all public entities from economic activity 
according to our plan and guidelines mentioned in state ownership policy and leveling the playing 
field across economic agents, and improving the competition in the banking sector. These will put 
Egypt on a firmer path to enhance private-sector led growth. 
Recent Developments and Outlook 
4. 
Since the exchange rate unification in March, the exchange rate has been market 
determined, and domestic and external financing conditions have improved. On foreign 
exchange markets, as committed under the EFF, (i) the spread between the official rate and measures 
of market clearing rates has remained closed, (ii) the foreign exchange demand backlog at banks has 
remained zero, and (iii) daily interbank foreign exchange turnover has increased significantly relative 
to the pre-unification period. After the unification of the exchange rate and the monetary policy rate 
hike, demand for local currency Treasury securities increased, with nonresident holdings of local 
currency increasing significantly at prevailing competitive rates. The government now relies much 
less on the central bank’s overdraft facility as committed under the EFF, and the maturity of new 
domestic issuances through auction has increased. 
5. 
The recent investment deal with the ADQ has significantly improved the net external 
financial positions of the Central Bank of Egypt (CBE) and commercial banks and helped 
reduce budget sector gross borrowing needs and debt. The New Urban Communities Authority 
(NUCA) has received new financing of US$24 billion from the Ras El-Hekma investment deal with the 
ADQ. Separately, the UAE’s deposits of US$11 billion at the CBE have been converted to local 
currency for the ADQ’s investment inside Egypt. The CBE has captured US$15 billion of the new 
financing in its foreign exchange reserves, and the government has reduced budget sector debt by 
about half of the local currency equivalent of the new financing of US$24 billion. 
6. 
New investment in the Ras El Hekma region is not expected to start until the master 
plan for the project is finalized and approved during 2025. We completed all the licensing and 
permitting procedures and the land for the Ras El Hekma project will be transferred to the newly 
established Ras El Hekma for Urban Development Project Company. The company has been granted 
golden licenses and will be allowed to develop a freezone and investment zone. The government will 
have a 35 percent interest in the profits generated by the newly established company after all cost 
incurred has been recovered. While we have not received the development master plan for the 
region from ADQ, which may take a year to complete, initial estimates indicate that annual 
investment in the region will be about US$3-4 billion, mostly in the form of FDI and domestic private 
investments. Key private investors are expected to engage in the project on commercially viable 


ARAB REPUBLIC OF EGYPT 
 
 
INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND 
67 
terms. The public sector will not undertake, finance directly or indirectly, nor guarantee financing of 
any new investment in the area designated for the project. 
7. 
However, growth remains relatively weak partially due to external shocks, high inflation, 
and high nominal domestic borrowing costs. Growth slowed to an average of 2.5 percent in the first 
half of FY2023/24 due to weak confidence and foreign exchange shortages, and we project that the 
growth for FY2023/24 would fall short of 3 percent, with the lingering conflict in Gaza and Israel, 
prolonged disruptions in the Red Sea, and very high cost of domestic borrowing. While inflation has 
slowed in recent months, it remains high at 28.1 percent in May. Suez Canal revenues decreased by 
almost 57 percent year-on-year between January and March 2024, with a loss of around US$1.3 billion, 
relative to the same period in 2023, which has negative impact on fiscal revenues, the current account, 
and the CBE’s foreign exchange reserves.  
8. 
Fiscal tightening continues, albeit currently tilted toward non-interest expenditure 
adjustment while protecting needed social spending. Despite a notable year over year increase in 
tax revenues by 34.4 percent during July-April FY2023/24, tax to GDP ratio only stabilized due to 
high inflation. We have achieved a primary surplus of 3.4 percent of GDP in the first ten months of 
FY2023/24. This came with a sharp reduction in capital spending from the budget sector and 
benefited from the initial tranche from the Ras El-Hekma investment despite significantly lower 
receipts from the Suez Canal. However, an increase in interest expense in light of recent FX 
adjustment and interest rate hikes exerted pressures on the overall fiscal balance of the budget 
sector. Going forward, we target a primary surplus of 3.5 percent of GDP exclusive of divestment 
inflows in FY2024/25, in line with our commitment under the EFF and the FY2024/25 budget 
submitted to the parliament. To reach this target, the FY2024/25 budget envisages an increase in tax 
revenue (from both policy and administrative measures) by 0.7 percent of GDP, versus FY2023/24 
projected outturns, and non-tax revenue by 0.3 percent of GDP. On the expenditure side, we plan to 
reduce primary expenditure across the board, while protecting spending on the vulnerable, human 
capital spending and targeted transfers to support the pace of economic recovery.  
9. 
The banking system remains stable following the recent increase in interest rates and 
currency depreciation. Banks on average are profitable, liquid and have adequate capital per 
prudential minimums. In recent months, bank net foreign assets increased significantly with 
additional foreign exchange liquidity in the banking system associated with the ADQ investment deal 
and the unification of the exchange rate. Banks remain compliant with regulatory limits on net 
foreign exchange open positions. 
10. 
Over the medium term, we expect growth to recover and accelerate with stronger 
contribution from private sector, inflation to continue slowing, reserve buffers to increase, 
and debt to keep its downward trajectory. We aim to secure this outlook through continued 
implementation of our program commitments. At the same time, we are mindful of significant risks 
and uncertainty for this outlook, including from regional conflict, portfolio flows, implications of high 
inflation and cost of borrowing, possible uncertainty regarding the precise impact of certain reforms, 
and the size and pace of FDI inflows. We are developing contingency plans that can adequately deal 
with these risks.

Program Performance 
11. 
We remain strongly committed to the EFF program. We met all but one of the end-March 
2024 quantitative performance criteria (QPCs) . We met the end-March QPC of net international 
reserve (NIR) by a significant margin, supported by the exchange rate unification in March and an 
increase in nonresident portfolio inflows to local currency T-bills. We also met the end-March QPCs 
on the reduction of the balance at the CBE’s overdraft facility and CBE lending to public agencies. On 
the fiscal front, we missed the end-March QPC on the primary balance including divestment 
proceeds, solely due to valuation effects, as the exchange rate applicable to the conversion of the 
Ras El-Hekma proceeds was significantly different from assumptions used under the program. We 
missed the weekly QPC on the balance of the government’s overdraft facility at the CBE for weeks 
ending April 18 to May 23 because of borrowing from the facility in anticipation of receipt of the 
second tranche of the ADQ deal, which was received in late May; the balance on the overdraft facility 
was lowered below the ceiling by May 30, 2024. We met the continuous performance criteria on 
non-accumulation of external arrears by the general government and the prohibition on the 
imposition or intensification of exchange restrictions, multiple currency practices, and import 
restrictions. 
12. 
For the end-March 2024 indicative targets (ITs), we met the ITs on tax revenue and social 
spending. We narrowly missed the IT on the maturity of new domestic debt issuances through 
auctions, due to our reliance on short-term T-bills in light of prevailing market uncertainty before the 
exchange rate unification, but the maturity started lengthening after March. The IT on budget sector 
debt for end-March was missed by a small margin as well, due to over reliance on short term 
borrowing. The IT on guarantees was missed by a large margin due to the depreciation of the official 
exchange rate as guarantees denominated in foreign currency are automatically adjusted for 
currency movements and due to guarantees that the Ministry of Finance had to issue to allow EGPC 
to continue borrowing from banks. We met the ITs on the CBE’s FX intervention rule and budget. 
13. 
We also met several structural benchmarks (SBs) for the third review. 
• 
We met the SB on sustaining a flexible exchange rate regime and a liberalized FX system, the SB 
on enacting the executive regulations of the PFM law, the SB on the monthly publication of all 
public procurement contracts that exceed EGP 20 million, the SB on publication of a 
comprehensive tax expenditure report, and the SB on the immediate introduction of fixed rate, 
full allotment 7-day deposit operations, and publishing the results of such operations on CBE’s 
website. 
• 
We did not meet the recurring SB on quarterly implementation of the retail fuel price indexation 
mechanism although we increased prices in March 2024 for all fuel products including those 
covered by the indexation mechanisms with projected annual savings worth 0.3 percent of GDP 
that far exceeds what would have been captured by the formula adjustments (0.07 percent of 
GDP). The SB related to an introduction of a binding requirement to ensure the timely 
publication of the Central Auditing Organization’s (CAO) annual audit reports on the fiscal 
accounts was also not met though progress was achieved in drafting a new CAO law that would

capture this among several other key reforms. Similarly, The SB on CBE recapitalization was not 
met, to allow time for refinements to the proposed plan, while the SB on developing a plan to 
reduce central bank claims on government agencies outside the Ministry of Finance will also 
require additional time to be completed. While we prepared a broad strategy to repay EGPC 
arrears, the SB to prepare a plan to reduce EGPC arrears was not met. 
• 
While the inflation rate in March 2024 exceeded the upper outer band under the Monetary Policy 
Consultation Clause (MPCC), triggering a consultation with the IMF’s Executive Board, the policy 
rate hike in March should slow inflation, and we expect the inflation rate to fall below the MPCC’s 
upper bound for end-June. 
Economic Program 
14. 
The key objectives of the program remain securing macroeconomic stability and 
continuing progress in structural reform agenda. In particular, the objectives include: maintaining 
a flexible exchange rate regime and a liberalized FX system; reducing inflation towards our target 
with appropriate monetary and fiscal and structural policies; a sustained increase in tax revenues; 
reducing untargeted fuel subsidies further to increase space for high-quality social and human 
capital support measures; containing broad public investment; further strengthening our debt 
management strategy to contain gross financing needs and debt; improving governance of state 
banks; and accelerating structural measures that support the implementation of the state-ownership 
policy, enhance e-transparency, and levelling the playing field across economic agents. 
Exchange Rate and Monetary Policies 
15. 
We will maintain a flexible exchange rate regime and a liberalized foreign exchange 
system. As agreed at the time of the 1st and 2nd reviews of the EFF, a comprehensive set of indicators 
will be used to monitor this, including the essential closing of the spread between the official 
exchange rate and measures of the market-clearing rate, the effective elimination of foreign 
exchange demand backlogs at banks, and increased FX turnover in the interbank market relative to 
the period before the exchange rate unification (structural benchmark). We will not introduce or 
intensify exchange restrictions or multiple currency practices, impose or intensify import restrictions 
for balance of payments purposes, or conclude any bilateral payment agreements that are 
inconsistent with Article VIII of the IMF’s articles of agreement (continuous performance criterion). 
Interventions by the CBE in the FX market, if necessary, will continue to be guided by a volatility-
based intervention framework and reserve accumulation goals. 
16. 
We will continue our efforts to rebuild foreign reserve buffers. The CBE will continue to 
accumulate official reserves to support external sustainability, based on the agreed definition of 
reserves that include both Tier 1 and Tier 2 assets of the CBE as well as any other foreign currency 
assets held by the CBE that could be used for reserve management purposes (performance criterion). 
To limit the potential for foreign currency mismatches on banks’ balance sheets when external 
pressures emerge, the CBE will not grant exemptions for commercial banks that breach net foreign 
exchange open position limits and will apply sanctions to any banks that violate the limits, in 


ARAB REPUBLIC OF EGYPT                                                                                         
70 
INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND 
accordance with the regulations (structural benchmark). The CBE will continue to consult with IMF 
staff if aggregate banks’ NFAs show a cumulative decline of US$2 billion over a three-month period 
(consultation clause). We will not accumulate any general government external debt payment arrears 
(continuous performance criterion).  
17. 
Our priority for monetary policy is to reduce inflation towards our inflation target. We 
raised the key policy rate by 200 basis points in February and by 600 basis points in March, to the 
current level of 27.25 percent. The CBE’s Monetary Policy Committee left policy rates unchanged at 
its meeting in late-May 2024, judging the current monetary stance remains appropriate to place 
inflation on a declining path. We will continue to conduct monetary policy decisions in a data-
dependent manner, and we will not hesitate to take actions if data outturns signal deviations from 
our projected inflation path towards achieving our target. In this context, we will adhere to the 
MPCC, which will trigger consultation with the IMF when the headline urban CPI inflation rate (year 
on year) falls outside the range agreed with IMF staff. Over time, the CBE will enhance its capacity to 
monitor inflation expectations, to support our ambition to fully transition to an inflation targeting 
regime. Separately, to support the progress towards achieving the inflation target, the government’s 
use of the overdraft facility at the central bank has been reduced and we are committed to keeping it 
below the statutory limit on a recurrent, weekly basis (performance criterion). The CBE has not 
increased and remains committed to not increase its lending to public sector agencies excluding the 
Ministry of Finance (performance criterion). Furthermore, we commit to taking a first step to reduce 
this stock by EGP 150 billion (about 1 percent of GDP) already by end-July 2024, which is reflected in 
the quantitative targets from September 2024 onwards. We will thereafter reduce the remainder of 
the stock to zero by EGP 100 billion per year, through the preparation of a detailed repayment 
strategy that may rely on the use of operational surpluses obtained by the agencies that had 
benefited from the loans, or other mechanisms (including use of part of the divestiture receipts) that 
should not affect regular budgetary operations including getting at least 50 percent of divesture 
proceeds over the medium term. The CBE will continue to refrain from extending, renewing, or 
introducing any subsidized lending schemes. 
Fiscal Policy and Debt Management 
18. 
We are committed to continuing our fiscal consolidation efforts. 
• 
In FY 2023/24, we will achieve a primary surplus of 2.2 percent of GDP excluding divestment 
proceeds to the budget and 6.2 percent of GDP including divestment proceeds. The divestment 
proceeds in FY2023/24 include the Egyptian pound equivalent of $12 billion proceeds from the 
recent Ras El-Hekma investment deal with ADQ (3.7 percent of GDP) and other divestment proceeds 
(0.15 percent of GDP). 
• 
For FY2024/25, we target a primary surplus of 3.5 percent of GDP excluding divestment proceeds 
and additional 1 percent of GDP from divestment proceeds to be used to reduce gross financing 
needs, as reflected in the budget submitted to the Parliament (performance criterion). This primary 
balance target entails new structural revenue measures that generate an expected improvement in 
tax and non-tax revenue of about 1.0 percent of GDP in FY2024/25 versus projected outturns for 


ARAB REPUBLIC OF EGYPT 
 
 
INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND 
71 
FY2023/24. In this regard, tax measures of 0.7 percent of GDP have been identified, including the 
full year impact of the previously implemented law that eliminated preferential tax treatment and 
exemptions for SOEs, along with rationalization of VAT exemptions, and anti-fraud tax measures. 
We will enact a law to speed up the resolution of tax disputes, which will provide an additional 
0.15-0.2 percent of GDP tax revenue for FY2024/25. We will submit to parliament amendments to 
the VAT law that simplify the VAT, rationalize exemptions, and enhance its efficiency and 
progressivity by November 2024 (structural benchmark). This VAT reform will target a structural 
increase in VAT revenue of at least 1 percent of GDP on a 12-month basis, of which 0.2 percent of 
GDP will be generated in FY2024/25. Dividend receipts are targeted to increase by 0.2 percent of 
GDP, and an additional 0.1 percent of GDP will be obtained through additional measures currently 
under review. In this regard, we are committed to achieving the floor on tax revenues (indicative 
target) and a ceiling on the gross debt of the budget sector (indicative target). We will not introduce 
additional corporate income tax (CIT) exemptions and will significantly limit CIT tax incentives, and 
we will replace existing fragmented character of tax incentives by a transparent, coherent, effective, 
and efficient framework within the new income tax law that is currently being drafted with IMF 
assistance. To protect the revenue base, we will undertake a detailed assessment of the economic 
and financial benefits of the current freezones by end-September 2024 (structural benchmark), and 
in the meantime, we will limit any further expansion of freezones. 
• 
Over the medium term, in line with our Medium-Term Revenue Strategy and considering the 
need to bring down budget sector debt levels to below 85 percent of GDP, we target an increase 
in the primary surplus by FY2026/27 to 5.0 percent of GDP and 5.5 percent inclusive of 
divestment proceeds, with the tax revenue to GDP increasing by around 3 percent of GDP by 
FY2026/27. To achieve this, we will continue with tax revenue-based fiscal consolidation although 
one key challenge is the exceptional high inflation rates recorded along with efforts to better 
capture economic activities covered by GDP and national account calculations that have led to 
almost doubling the value of nominal GDP over the 3-years period extending from FY 2021/22 to 
FY 2024/25. In addition to the VAT measures, we will introduce other tax policy and 
administrative measures such as: widening the tax base by ensuring the full implementation of 
taxation and e-commerce on all traded goods; implementing a new Income tax law by 
FY2025/26 to address existing loopholes; consolidate amendments, and rationalize exemptions 
including possibly those in freezones; adopting a withholding tax on turnover from exports to 
the domestic market from freezones in Egypt; adopting green fees and taxes in line with 
international best practices; implementing reforms adopting the Automatic Exchange of 
Information Standard by FY2026/27; implementing the EU’s Carbon Border Adjustment 
Mechanism (CBAM) requirement; accelerating reform of property taxation to leverage this pro-
growth and progressive source of revenue; and strengthening the e-tax platform to improve tax 
efficiency and reduce the size of the informal economy.  
19. 
We are adjusting domestic fuel prices to make space for better targeted social support. 
While we successfully reduced on-budget fuel subsidies to 0.3 percent of GDP in 2021, the gap between 
fuel prices and cost recovery has grown significantly since mainly due to notable FX adjustments that 
led to depreciated local currency and elevated cost of borrowing, bringing the on-budget fuel subsidy 


ARAB REPUBLIC OF EGYPT                                                                                         
72 
INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND 
to about 1.2 percent of GDP in FY2022/23. To bring fuel prices back in line with the level implied by the 
indexation formula since the start of the EFF program, we increased fuel prices of almost all products in 
March 2024 with annual savings worth 0.3 percent of GDP. While we missed the structural benchmark 
for April 2024 on the retail fuel price indexation mechanism, we are firmly committed to gradually 
restore fuel prices for gasoline, diesel and fuel oil used by industry to their cost recovery level by 
December 2025. The fuel price increases will also help us progress on our decarbonization efforts 
outlined in the updated Nationally Determined Contribution published in 2023. We will strengthen 
communication around the mechanism by explaining the rationale for the pricing decisions and record 
and publish fuel subsidies and any liabilities to Egyptian General Petroleum Corporation (EGPC). 
20. 
We are implementing structural measures to support our fiscal goals. These include: 
• 
In April 2024, we published for the first time an annual tax expenditure report, including available 
details and estimates of tax exemptions and tax breaks broken down by classification, including: 
those provided to companies operating in free economic zones and to all state-owned 
enterprises, including public sector companies, public business sector companies, military-owned 
companies, economic authorities, and joint ventures and partnerships. The report identified tax 
revenue losses due to exemptions of 3.0-4.5 percent of GDP. We will identify poorly targeted 
exemptions that are not benefiting lower income groups and human capital objectives and/or 
that have limited impact on supporting competitiveness of the economy. For such list of well-
identified exemptions, we will work on a plan to gradually streamline them. 
• 
We are currently amending the law governing the CAO and plan to introduce this requirement 
into the law rather than implement it through a decree. In the interim, to achieve the same 
transparency objectives, we will publish CAO’s audit reports for FY2022/23, including on the 
budget sector and Economic Authorities, by end-August 2024 (structural benchmark) and submit 
the CAO law to parliament by end-November 2024 (revised structural benchmark). 
21. 
We are taking additional steps to protect vulnerable groups. With the progress achieved 
in 2023 to broadening the coverage of the Takaful and Karama cash transfer program to 5.3 million 
households, we have focused on increasing the monthly payments to protect the most vulnerable 
against high inflation. Beyond the direct cash transfer to the poor, we continued to raise the 
minimum public sector wage, issued monthly nominal increases to protect public sector employees’ 
wages, and increased pension payments for civil servants in FY2022/23 and FY2023/24 to mitigate 
the impact of inflation. The total social protection package for FY2024/25 reached EGP130 billion, in 
addition of EGP 50 billion cost incurred by the Pension Fund to accommodate recent decisions to 
increase monthly pension payments. To better evaluate the adequacy of our social protection 
programs, we will update the relevant analysis based on the latest household income survey, which 
will be published with the full results by July 2024 (new structural benchmark). To consolidate various 
subsidy programs, a steering committee led by the Prime Minister, will refine the eligibility criteria 
and apply a proper model to establish a conditional cash transfer programs with improved targeting 
in a year. We have drafted a new social protection law to strengthen regulation of various social 
protection programs, and it is currently being considered by the Parliament. We will publish a report 
evaluating the social housing program, and explore further efficiency gains in our food subsidies. On

health, we will continue the rollout of our universal health insurance scheme. We are committed to 
providing support for those most in need, with a minimum level of social spending consistent with 
these objectives (indicative target). 
22. 
We will slow down the implementation of public investment projects, including national 
projects, to ensure domestic and external stability. Comprehensive management of the overall public 
investment portfolio is central to achieving consistency in the macro policy mix and to mitigate pressures 
on foreign exchange. We will monitor and control overall public investment, following the issuance and 
publication of the Prime Ministerial decree number 739 of 2024 requiring all public entities to report 
annual projected investment, including projects contracted or undertaken by entities such as the 
Administrative Capital for Urban Development (ACUD), National Urban Communities Authority (NUCA), 
the National Service Projects Organization, the National Authority for Military Production, and the Arab 
Organization for Industrialization, to a cabinet level committee chaired by the Central Auditing 
Organization (CAO). The first submission outlining projected investment for FY2024/25 has been done as 
planned by April 30, 2024, and submission will be done annually by April 30 thereafter. The committee 
issued directives and reporting instructions to all entities on how to report investment plans and 
investment expenditure, defined as spending on assets with a useful life that exceeds one-year. The 
decree requires all public agencies to report to the committee each September and March the 
implementation amounts and percentages compared to the targets for the periods January–June and 
July–December, respectively. The reports shall be submitted to the Public Economic Governance 
Committee. The target ceiling on the value of total public investment over the period from January–June 
2024 is EGP 350 billion and the target for FY2024/25 is EGP 1,000 billion (indicative target). 
23. 
We have expanded the perimeter of general government fiscal reporting to track 
broader fiscal activities. The general government, as currently defined, excludes fiscal activities 
undertaken by economic authorities (EAs). We revised the PFM law to achieve the following: 
• 
With the FY2024/25 budget submission to parliament, we have reported fiscal indicators for the 
general government for the first time that include all 59 EAs. These entities are required to report 
to the MOF semiannually in FY2024/25 and quarterly in subsequent years once capacity has been 
fully developed at those entities. The MOF in collaboration with the Cabinet is putting in place a 
system to request and receive needed information from these entities to be able to produce 
timely consolidated figures. 
• 
We also introduced binding ceilings on the debt of the entities included in these indicators in the 
annual budget law. Adjustment of ceilings will require recommendation from the MOF based on 
a clear set of criteria, and parliamentary approval. 
These reforms aim at improving transparency in the activities of EAs and strengthening our ability to 
monitor their fiscal performance and the size of overall public investment. In parallel, we will conduct 
a sector classification exercise of all 59 EAs in accordance with the concepts and principles in the 
GFSM 2014 and document the rationale for each classification decision by end-September 2024, 
recognizing that only those EAs that are nonmarket producers should be included in the general 
government (structural benchmark). 


ARAB REPUBLIC OF EGYPT                                                                                         
74 
INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND 
24. 
We will establish a repayment strategy to reduce arrears to international oil companies. 
The Egyptian General Petroleum Company (EGPC) has accumulated payment arrears on supply 
contracts of about US$5 billion, denominated in U.S. dollars. The buildup of arrears reflects several 
factors including foreign exchange shortages, elevated cost of borrowing, a cyclical downturn in the 
domestic production of gas, higher domestic consumption reducing the scope for gas exports, 
significant price deviations from cost recovery, and increased subsidies from EGPC to the electricity 
sector. We are developing a repayment strategy to ensure that no new arrears are accumulated and 
that existing arrears are cleared. Discussions continue to finalize this strategy without further delays. 
In addition, we are firmly committed to adjusting energy prices to reach cost recovery levels as a 
critical component of this strategy, which will also put EGPC on a sounder financial footing. The 
planned adjustments in electricity and fuel prices, together with additional revenues from expanded 
capacity in the oil refinery, will help avoid operational losses, and contain fiscal risks, including those 
associated with the guarantees that the Ministry of Finance had to issue to allow EGPC to continue 
borrowing from banks. Finally, for transparent reporting of arrears, we will resume semi-annual 
publication of EGPC’s financial statement, starting with publication of the end-December 2023 
statement by end-June 2024. More broadly, we also plan other measures to reach a positive 
operating cashflow for EGPC in FY2025/26.  
25. 
To complement fiscal consolidation efforts, we will strengthen the public debt 
management function with envisioned comprehensive reforms along key structural and 
operational pillars. The main reforms would target in the medium-term the completion of the 
institutional setup of debt management (reorganization of the Debt Management Unit (DMU) along 
front, middle, and back-office functions), the regulatory setup, domestic debt market development 
(broadening the investor base, enhancing competition, and introducing new instruments like retail 
bonds and a revamped primary dealership system), enhanced diversification, and better debt 
reporting and investor relations. As a priority, we will be updating and publishing by December 2024 
the medium-term debt management strategy that articulates a multi-year borrowing plan updated 
annually and anchored by a portfolio cost and risk management framework. The strategy document 
will include debt portfolio risk tolerance thresholds and operational targets, and will cover foreign 
and domestic debt, cutting across key and potential instruments and sources of financing. The 
revised Primary Dealership setup will be finalized and operationalized by end-September 2024. We 
will seek IMF technical assistance where appropriate to help with designing, sequencing, and 
implementing these reforms.  
26. 
From a borrowing strategy perspective, and to help contain gross financing needs, we 
will continue to gradually lengthen the maturity of new domestic issuances (indicative target). 
Earlier this year, we agreed with pension funds and insurance funds, both in an excess liquidity 
position, to extend the maturity of existing debt that matures in the next several years in line with 
prevailing market terms. We also agreed with major state banks to voluntarily participate in MOF 
efforts to issue new three-year treasury bonds when the existing bonds held by these banks mature 
in the next several years. We have improved the composition of budget financing by increasing 
financing from multilateral and official bilateral creditors, while reducing the use of the overdraft at 
the CBE. Furthermore, we commit to prioritizing domestic financing via market mechanisms 


ARAB REPUBLIC OF EGYPT 
 
 
INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND 
75 
(auctions) and effectively phasing out in the short-term access to private placements and any CBE 
financing above the regulatory ceiling. We will improve on the short-term reporting on government 
financing from the domestic market by including information on key domestic financing instruments 
in the current debt reporting framework (including auction results, private placements, and overdraft 
borrowing).   
27. 
In addition, we will address the recapitalization needs of the CBE in an integrated 
manner, considering both the government’s debt management strategy and the need to 
safeguard CBE balance sheet and its price stability mandate. While we prepared an initial plan to 
address the CBE’s recapitalization needs, before this plan is finalized and implemented, we will 
conduct a more comprehensive assessment of recapitalization needs that cover the next five years, 
taking into account the planned reduction in the stock of CBE’s credit to public agencies (see ¶17) as 
well as our plan to reduce the CBE’s subordinated debt issued to state-owned banks, by end-August 
2024 (reset structural benchmark). This recapitalization plan, agreed upon by the MOF and the CBE, 
will protect the ability of the CBE to achieve its price stability mandate and consider the 
government’s debt management strategy and associated target to put debt to GDP on a firmly 
downward path. Separately, we will establish an agreement between the CBE and the Ministry of 
Finance that fully regularizes the use of the 2021 SDR allocation for fiscal purposes. 
28. 
We will continue to strengthen fiscal risk management. To monitor potential risks and 
safeguard future fiscal resources, the Ministry of Finance will report annually the payment arrears of 
the budget sector, including to critical SOEs and EAs, within 90 days of the end of the fiscal year 
(recurrent structural benchmark). The reporting includes the stocks of commitments, overdue 
payments, overdue transactions, and the stock of gross liabilities and due payments to and from the 
MOF, in aggregate and by following entities (the EGPC, General Authority for Supply Commodities, 
New Urban Communities Authority, National Postal Authority, National Authority for Egyptian 
Railways, National Investment Bank, CBE, Egyptian Electricity Holding Company, Holding Company 
for Drinking Water and Sanitation, and EgyptAir). We also redouble our efforts to report the same 
data on a quarterly basis. To further strengthen control of fiscal risks from off-budget activity, we will 
ensure that the stock of government guarantees relative to GDP declines annually from its projected 
value of about 34 percent of GDP at end-June 2024 (indicative target). We have published an annual 
fiscal risk statement as a chapter of the budget documentation, starting from FY2024/25, in line with 
IMF technical assistance. 
Financial Sector Policy 
29. 
Strengthening financial sector resilience continues to be a key priority. The banking system 
remains adequately capitalized and liquidity is ample. While banks have remained in compliance with 
their net open position limits, we will closely monitor the maturity and composition of banks’ foreign 
currency assets and liabilities, including their exposure to public sector agencies. Following successful 
technical assistance from the IMF, the CBE is establishing a bank resolution unit. The CBE will also 
strengthen transparency and communication of financial sector issues, including ensuring all public 
reporting, including the annual financial stability reports, is done on predictable schedule and without 
excessive lags. To test the resilience of banks, the CBE will complete stress tests of the banking sector 


ARAB REPUBLIC OF EGYPT                                                                                         
76 
INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND 
and share detailed results with IMF staff by end-September 2024 using end-March 2024 data; these 
tests will be prepared in consultation with IMF staff (structural benchmark). 
30. 
We are committed to strengthening governance practices and competition in the 
banking sector. To support stronger governance practices, we commit that the CBE will not issue 
any new subordinated debt to state-owned banks. To enhance the governance of state-owned 
banks, we will commission an independent assessment of policies, procedures, and controls of state-
owned banks (with CBE and IMF input and agreement on terms of reference) by an internationally 
recognized firm, with the tendering and selection process completed by end-October 2024 (new 
structural benchmark).  
Structural Reforms 
31. 
We are rolling out our state ownership policy with the aim of levelling the playing field 
and increasing private sector-led growth. To support the ongoing rollout of the state-ownership 
policy and to transparently track reduction in the state’s involvement in non-strategic sectors identified 
in the state-ownership policy as well as enhance role of the private sector in the economy, we will 
re-instate regular publication of annual aggregate reports on Egypt’s SOE portfolio on the appropriate 
government website, with coverage expanded to include all SOEs covered by the state-ownership policy 
(recurring structural benchmark, starting in end-September 2024 and at end-September each year). In 
addition, we continue to make progress in developing an indicator to track implementation of the 
state-ownership policy by end-July 2024 (structural benchmark). In this regard, we are considering three 
indicators: the share of private investment in total investment, the share of private credit in total credit; 
and a measure of the reduction of the state-owned enterprises in the non-strategic sectors identified in 
the state-ownership policy. We have sent draft legislation to parliament to embrace key elements of the 
state-ownership policy into law, in part through legislating the creation of unit in the Prime Minister’s 
office with the powers to establish guidelines for the governance of state-owned enterprises and to 
facilitate divestment. We will seek passage of the law by parliament by December 2024. We intend to 
take follow-up measures to empower the Unit to develop and implement a coherent approach to sound 
corporate governance of the full SOE portfolio. 
32. 
Divestment of state-owned assets is key to reducing the state’s footprint, strengthening 
external resilience, and reducing government debt. Supporting the state-ownership policy, we 
have produced an inventory of over 700 SOEs and identified about 200 as candidates for divestment, 
including all government ownership interests in non-strategic sectors. We have also worked with the 
International Finance Corporation (IFC) to develop a sector-by-sector approach to divestment. So far 
in FY2023/24, we have finalized divestment deals worth US$2.2 billion, of which US$2 billion has been 
received. However, we will likely fall short of our divestment target for FY2023/24 of securing US$2.8 
billion in dollar inflows from divestment as potential investors decided to wait until the 
macroeconomic uncertainty earlier in the fiscal year was resolved. Nonetheless, we remain committed 
to achieving the overall dollar inflows from divestment envisaged at the time of program approval. 
For FY2024/25, we target new divestment of US$3.6 billion denominated in U.S. dollar, as well as 
additional divestment of 0.5 percent of GDP denominated in either U.S. dollar or Egyptian pound. To 
rebuild the CBE’s foreign exchange reserves, we will keep foreign exchange proceeds generated by 


ARAB REPUBLIC OF EGYPT 
 
 
INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND 
77 
sales of state-owned assets at the CBE. At the same time, in order to reduce budget sector debt and 
gross financing needs, we will channel 1.0 percent of GDP of divestment proceeds in FY2024/25 and 
another 0.7 percent of GDP in FY2025/26 to the MOF’s budget. 
33. 
We will continue our efforts to level the playing field and strengthen business climate 
and governance. 
• 
We published the Executive Regulations implementing the amendments to the Competition Law 
that was introduced in December 2022. This regulation empowers the Egyptian Competition 
Authority (ECA) to control mergers that would limit, restrict, or harm competition. Separately, we 
have drafted amendments to the Competition Law to align the independence of the ECA with the 
independence of other regulators with comparable mandates, including the CBE and the 
Financial Regulatory Authority (FRA). The redrafted amendments will also empower the ECA to 
issue direct administrative sanctions similar to the CBE. We are committed to submitting the 
redrafted amendments to parliament (new structural benchmark for end-October 2024). Further, 
the ECA has hired external advisors to develop a survey for the private sector that will underlie 
the development of an index to track the views of key stakeholders regarding competitive 
neutrality and to identify necessary reforms to the competitive neutrality framework.  
• 
To improve the ease of doing business, customs procedures are transitioning towards a risk-
based approach that helps reduce import clearance times. We will introduce a “Green Lane” 
where a percentage of the cargo associated with low risk and compliant companies will be 
released immediately without any controls (new structural benchmark). We will also integrate 
risk-based control between Customs Authority, Export and Import Control Authority, National 
Food Safety Authority, Agricultural and Veterinary Quarantines to reduce the number of 
containers needed to be inspected and thus, reduce the clearance procedures and time of goods 
in ports (new structural benchmark). 
• 
We met the SB on posting reports that comprise monthly procurement awards greater than 
EGP 20 million, which also report the findings from General Authority for Government Services 
(GAGS) on-site post-procurement audits of budget unit procurement awards. The reports are 
posted on the GAGS website, accessible in Egypt, and the Ministry of Finance website, accessible 
internationally, making them freely available to the public without any restriction. Looking ahead, 
with the assistance from the Korea International Cooperation Agency (KOICA), we are upgrading 
the public e-procurement system to bring it in line with the existing public procurement law (Law 
No. 182 of 2018 Regulating Contracts Entered by Public Entitles) and to allow for posting of final 
awards. The new system is to be operational by June 2025. 
Financing and Program Monitoring 
34. 
We have secured financing to close the financing gap. The total financing needed to reach the 
revised net international reserve targets is US$7.7 billion in FY2023/24 and US$6.8 billion in FY2024/25, 
excluding IMF purchases. We have secured firm financing commitments for the next 12 months ending in 
June 2025 from international partners to fully close the financing gap. We have assurances from Arab

countries to keep their official deposits at the CBE for US$19 billion until the end of the EFF arrangement 
in September 2026 unless they are used for the purchase of equities. We have good prospects for 
meeting the financing needs in the remainder of the program, with multilateral and official bilateral 
support, external market financing, and we will adjust policies if needed. Regarding the inflow of 
US$24 billion from ADQ to acquire development rights of the Ras El-Hekma region, we have captured at 
least US$15 billion of the proceeds in the CBE’s foreign reserves. We will compensate for the smaller 
divestment flows during FY2023/24 with larger divestment in FY2024/25, relative to the original 
projection. Our divestment strategy will be strengthened by the advice from the IFC.  
35. 
The program will be monitored through prior actions, quantitative performance 
criteria, indicative targets, and structural benchmarks. All quantitative performance criteria and 
indicative targets are listed in Table 1. Prior actions and structural benchmarks are listed in Table 2. 
The Technical Memorandum of Understanding (TMU) indicates definitions of quantitative 
performance criteria, indicative targets, structural benchmarks, consultation clauses, and data 
provision requirements. While we currently commit to report the CBE’s net international reserves and 
their components with a submission lag of no more than 15 calendar days after the end of each 
month, we will work to shorten the submission lag in order to allow timely monitoring of the CBE’s 
net international reserves.

A. Floor on Net International Reserves (PC) 
5. 
Net international reserves (NIR) of the Central Bank of Egypt (CBE) under the program are 
defined as the difference between foreign reserve assets and foreign reserve-related liabilities. For the 
program monitoring purposes, assets and liabilities in currencies other than the U.S. dollar are 
converted into U.S. dollar equivalents using the program exchange rates indicated in this TMU. 
6. 
Foreign reserve assets are defined as readily available claims on nonresidents denominated in 
convertible foreign currencies, including the Chinese Yuan and U.A.E. Dirham. They include the CBE’s 
holdings of monetary gold, SDRs, foreign currency cash, and foreign currency securities, the CBE’s 
deposits abroad (irrespective of maturity), the country’s reserve position at the Fund, the CBE’s foreign 
currency deposits at local banks, and the CBE’s other foreign currency assets that could be used for 
reserve management purposes. Excluded from foreign reserve assets are any assets that are frozen, 
pledged, used as collateral, or otherwise encumbered, including but not limited to assets acquired 
through short-term currency swaps with original maturity of less than 360 days, claims on residents 
other than the CBE’s foreign currency deposits at local banks, precious metals other than gold, assets in 
nonconvertible currencies, and illiquid assets. As of end-April 2024, foreign reserve assets thus defined 
amounted to US$46,518 million. 
7. 
Foreign reserve-related liabilities are defined as comprising all short-term foreign exchange 
liabilities of the CBE to residents and nonresidents with original maturity of less than 360 days, except for 
deposits at the CBE with original maturity of less than 360 days that are owed to official GCC member 
creditors. They include government foreign currency deposits with an original maturity of less than 360 
days. They include banks’ required reserves in foreign currency, and all credit outstanding from the Fund 
that is on the balance sheet of the CBE. It excludes liabilities under currency swaps with original 


ARAB REPUBLIC OF EGYPT 
 
 
INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND 
85 
maturities of 360 days or more. As of end-April 2024, foreign reserve-related liabilities thus defined 
amounted to US$15,372 million. 
8. 
Adjustors. The floor on the NIR will be adjusted for: (i) deviation in program disbursements 
(defined below) relative to projections; (ii) deviation in external commercial borrowings (including 
Eurobonds and syndicated loans) relative to baseline assumptions; (iii) deviation in the stock of 
government T-bills and T-bonds denominated in local currency and held by nonresidents relative to 
program assumptions; (iv) repo margin calls, and (v) use of reserves according to a FX intervention 
framework. These adjustors are clarified below. Related information is reported in Table 13 of the staff 
report. 
9. 
Program disbursements are defined as disbursements of (i) loans denominated in foreign 
currency (excluding external borrowings from private creditors such as Eurobonds, Sukuk, Panda bond, 
and Samurai bond that are part of baseline BOP projections, but including T-bonds and other 
government securities denominated in foreign currency), grants, and deposits for budget support 
purposes denominated in foreign currency. Loans denominated in foreign currency that qualify as 
program disbursements are those that constitute new financing; thus they do not include conversions 
of deposit liabilities that existed at end-September 2022 at the CBE or conversions of official bilateral 
loans to the government; (ii) net issuance of T-bills in foreign currency; (iii) purchases under the IMF’s 
Extended Fund Facility; (iv) foreign reserve-related loans and deposits to the CBE with original maturity 
of more than 360 days except for official creditor deposits at the CBE which are included regardless of 
maturity; and (v) rollovers by more than 360 days of existing foreign loans and foreign reserve-related 
liabilities, from official multilateral creditors, official bilateral creditors, and private creditors, including 
external bond placements denominated in foreign currency; and (vi) foreign currency resources 
generated by sales of state-owned assets, including the sale of equity stakes in SOEs as defined below, 
and the sale of stakes in other assets such as land, excluding the investment deal for the development 
of Ras El-Hekma. All FX proceeds received by public entities involved in these sales would be captured 
by the CBE and would be reported as FX inflows to the CBE and go towards increasing the NIR. State-
owned asset sales that qualify as program disbursements are those that constitute new financing; thus, 
they do not include conversions of deposit liabilities that existed at end-September 2022 at the CBE or 
conversions of official bilateral loans to the government. Program disbursements do not include project 
loans and project grants. 
10. 
The adjustors for NIR will be applied in the following way: 
• 
Adjustor for deviations in program disbursements relative to projections. The NIR floor will be 
adjusted up by the full amount of any excess in cumulative program disbursements relative to the 
projections of cumulative program disbursements. The NIR floor will be adjusted down by the full 
amount of the shortfall in cumulative program disbursements relative to the projections of 
cumulative program disbursements. The projections for cumulative external program disbursements 
(excluding the IMF) from June 30, 2023, are US$6,204 million as of end-June 2024, US$1,456 million 
as of end-September 2024, and US$3,399 as of end-December 2024, US$5,462 million as of end-

• 
Adjustor for deviations in external commercial borrowings relative to baseline assumptions. The NIR 
floor will be adjusted up by the full amount of any excess in net external borrowings from private 
creditors in foreign currency (including Eurobonds, Sukuk, Panda bond, Samurai bond, and 
syndicated loans) relative to the baseline projections in the BOP. The projections for net external 
borrowing from private creditors from December 2023 are -US$110 million as of end-June 2024, 
US$1,000 million as of end-September 2024, US$2,500 million as of end-December 2024, US$3,500 
million as of end-March 2025, and US$3,639 as of end-June 2025. 
• 
Adjustor for deviations in the flow of government T-bills and T-bonds denominated in local currency 
and held by nonresidents relative to program assumptions. The floor on the NIR will be adjusted up 
by 50 percent of any excess in this flow of local currency government T-bills and Tbonds held by 
nonresidents relative to program assumptions.1 This adjustor will use the information on T-bill and 
T-bond holdings one month before the test date; thus, for the end-December 2022 test date, actual 
T-bill and T-bond flow holdings by nonresidents for end-November 2022 will be used to calculate 
the size of adjustor.  
 
• 
The program assumptions for the cumulative flows (from the beginning of each fiscal year) of local 
currency T-bills and T-bonds held by nonresidents, used for the purposes of this adjustor, are 
US$16,059 million for the end-June 2024 test date, US$750 million for the end-September 2024, 
US$1,500 million for end-December 2024, US$2,250 million for end-March 2025, and US$3,000 
million for end-June 2025. 
• 
Adjustor for repo margin calls. The NIR floor will be adjusted down (up) by any margin call payments 
(receipts) associated with the CBE’s repo facilities. 
• 
Adjustor for FX intervention. The NIR floor will be adjusted down by the amount of FX intervention 
(sales) undertaken by the CBE, provided the intervention is consistent with the intervention 
framework.  
B. Floor on Primary Fiscal Balance of the Budget Sector (PC) 
11. 
The budget sector comprises 184 central government (administration) units, including the 
executive powers (presidency, parliament, senate, and ministers), the legislative powers (judiciary and 
prosecution), 323 local government units, and 156 entities in the public service authorities, which 
include universities and hospitals. 
12. 
The primary fiscal balance of the budget sector under the program is defined as the overall 
balance measured on a cash basis minus total cash interest payments of the budget sector. The overall 
balance under the program is defined as total revenue and grants minus total expenditure plus net

acquisition of financial assets. These are measured on a cumulative basis from the beginning of the 
fiscal year. For FY2022/23, the primary balance of the budget sector thus defined was EGP 164 billion. 
13. 
Off-budget funds. The authorities will immediately inform IMF staff of the creation of any new 
off-budgetary funds or programs. This includes any new funds and special budgetary and extra-
budgetary programs that may be created during the program to carry out operations of fiscal nature as 
defined in the IMF’s Government Finance Statistics Manual 2014. 
14. 
Divestment proceeds flowing to the budget. Divestment proceeds flowing to the budget are 
part of divestment proceeds raised from the sale of state-owned assets in both FX and Egyptian 
pounds, including the sale of equity stakes in SOEs as defined below, and the sale of stakes in other 
assets such as land. Divestment proceeds flowing to the budget are recorded in the net acquisition of 
financial assets for program purposes. The program assumptions for divestment proceeds flowing to 
the budget are listed in the QPC table. 
15. 
Adjustor. The floor on the primary balance of the budget sector will be adjusted up by the full 
amount of the excess of divestment proceeds, including the sale of equity stakes in SOEs as defined 
below, and the sale of stakes in other assets such as land, relative to the program assumptions for 
divestment proceeds flowing to the budget as indicated in the QPC table.  
C. Floor on Tax Revenues (IT) 
16. 
Tax revenues include personal income tax, corporate income tax, capital gain tax, property tax, 
tax on T-bills/T-bonds, value-added tax, excises, tax on specific services, stamp tax, international trade

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND 
F. Ceiling on Balance of Government’s Overdraft Account at the CBE (PC) 
19. 
The program target is defined as the balance on the government’s overdraft account at the 
CBE. The ceiling on the balance is shown in Table 1 of the MEFP. The target applies recurrently, weekly, 
based on data at the end of each week. 
G. Ceiling on CBE lending to Public Agencies Excluding the Ministry of Finance 
(PC) 
20. 
The program target is defined as the balance on lending by the CBE to public agencies 
excluding the Ministry of Finance. The ceiling on the balance is EGP 661.172 billion, reflecting the stock 
of outstanding lending as of January 2024 to six entities. This performance criterion will apply 
continuously. The ceiling will be applicable for the period following an indicative or test date until a new 
ceiling is established. For example, the end-September 2024 ceiling will be applicable from October 1, 
2024, until end-December 2024. The balance will be reported transparently in the weekly analytical 
balance sheet of the CBE, with and “Other Items, net” split into a component relating to CBE lending to 
public agencies excluding the Ministry of Finance and a component reflecting all other items. Loan-by-
loan information will also be reported separately (Table 1B). 
H. Floor on Average Original Maturity of Newly Issued Local Currency 
Tradable Debt of the Budget Sector (IT) 
21. 
The program target is defined as the weighted average original maturity of local currency 
tradable debt of the budget sector that is issued through public placements. The weights used for the 
calculation are the volumes of issuance under each maturity. The weighted average original maturity is 
calculated cumulatively from the beginning of each fiscal year. Local currency tradable debt of the 
budget sector is defined as local currency tradable securities (tradable T-bills and T-bonds) denominated 
in Egyptian Pounds, including those issued by the budget sector to the Pension Fund and other public 
entities. 
I. Ceiling for Gross Debt of the Budget Sector (IT) 
22. 
Gross debt of the budget sector is defined as the outstanding stock of debt issued by the 
budget sector, as defined in the IMF’s Government Finance Statistics Manual 2014. It includes debt 
issued to the pension fund and other public entities. Sukuk issued by the budget sector will be treated 
as debt of the budget sector. For the program monitoring purposes, the U.S. dollar amounts of foreign 
currency debt will be converted to Egyptian pound equivalents using the program exchange rates 
indicated in this TMU. 
23. 
Adjustor. The ceiling for gross debt of the budget sector will be adjusted down by the full 
amount of the excess of divestment proceeds, including resources raised through the sale of equity 
stakes in SOEs and the sale of stakes in other assets such as land, relative to program assumptions. For

calculating this adjustor, the program assumptions for divestment proceeds flowing to the budget are 
listed in the QPC table. 
J. Ceiling on Government Guarantees (IT) 
24. 
The program target is defined as cumulative change in stock of guarantees issued by the 
Ministry of Finance with guarantees on foreign currency denominated borrowing converted to Egyptian 
pound equivalents using the program exchange rates indicated in this TMU. A guarantee is defined as 
an arrangement whereby the Ministry of Finance has an obligation to pay a third-party beneficiary when 
another institutional unit fails to perform certain contractual obligations. The Ministry of Finance will 
report to the IMF the stock of guarantees in billions of Egyptian pounds at both program and actual 
exchange rates 90 days after the relevant test date. The data will show guarantees on domestic currency 
and foreign currency borrowing by Economic Authorities (EGPC, GASC, Transport, NUCA, other) and 
state-owned enterprises (NIB, Electricity, other). The stock of guarantees will also be broken down into 
domestic and external guarantees by currency denomination of the guaranteed borrowing with the U.S. 
dollar value of guarantees of foreign currency denominated borrowing reported at actual and program 
exchange rates. For the cumulative values for end-March and end-June 2024 test dates are the ceiling 
on the change in nominal value of the stock of guarantees since September 30, 2023. Thereafter the 
cumulative ceiling applies to the change in the nominal value of the stock of guarantees since the 
beginning of the relevant fiscal year.  
K. Maintain a Flexible Exchange Rate Regime and a Liberalized Foreign 
Exchange System (SB) 
25. 
The structural benchmark will assess whether a shift to a flexible exchange rate regime 
and a liberalized FX system is sustained. This SB is assessed in a comprehensive manner, based on 
monitoring of FX system, using the information and indicators that include FX demand backlogs at 
banks, the spread between the official rate and measures of market clearing rate, and interbank FX 
turnover. For FX demand backlogs at banks, the CBE will provide data on FX demand backlogs at banks 
that cover eight banks identified by the CBE. The sample of banks is fixed throughout the program. For 
the spread between the official rate and measures of market-clearing rate, measures of market-clearing 
exchange rate, including the local parallel market rate, and exchange rates implied by transactions in 
gold, GDR, and ADR markets will be monitored on a daily basis.2 For interbank FX turnover, the CBE will 
provide daily data. The SB will be assessed once for each program review, based on the information 
over a period between program reviews.  
 
2 The data sources for the local parallel market rate are https://www.parallelrate.org/ (the data from this source is also 
available in Haver) and https://sarf-today.com/en/currency/us_dollar/market. The data source for the exchange rate 
implied by gold transactions in Egypt and internationally is https://egypt.gold-price-today.com/ and Bloomberg. The data 
source for the exchange rate implied by stock transactions in Egypt and internationally (GDR and ADR markets) is 
Bloomberg. For GDR and ADR, monitoring will focus on the stock for Commercial International Bank (CIB), given that CIB 
stock has the largest trading volume in GDR and ADR among Egyptian companies.

L. Commercial Banks’ Net Foreign Assets Consultation Clause 
26. 
Net foreign assets (NFA) of commercial banks are defined as the difference between the 
claims on nonresidents (including foreign currency holdings) and the liabilities to nonresidents of other 
depository corporations. For monitoring this clause, NFA will be measured in US dollars using the 
monetary data reported in the standardized report form. The NFA at end-December 2023 was -
US$16.2 billion.  
27. 
Consultation with IMF staff will be triggered if banks’ NFA at the aggregate level decline by 
cumulative $2 billion over any past three-month period. The cumulative change in banks’ NFA will be 
assessed at the end of every month. This consultation will be on the reasons for the decline in banks’ 
NFA and to ascertain whether: (i) there were imbalances in the FX market; and (ii) any corrective actions 
by the CBE are necessary. 
M. Monetary Policy Consultation Clause 
28. 
Inflation is defined as the year-on-year change in the end-of-period headline urban consumer 
price index (average FY2018/19 = 100), as measured and published by the Central Agency for Public 
Mobilization and Statistics (CAPMAS). 
29. 
Consultation with IMF Board will be triggered if end-June or end-December inflation falls 
outside of the upper outer band or the lower outer band. The upper outer band and the lower outer band 
are indicated in Table 1 of the MEFP. The consultation with IMF Board will be on the reasons for inflation 
deviations from the outer band, the stance of monetary policy and the inflation outlook, whether the 
Fund-supported program remains on track, and the CBE’s remedial actions that are deemed necessary 
before further purchases under the EFF could be requested. 
30. 
Consultation with IMF staff will be triggered if end-June or end-December inflation falls 
outside of the upper inner band or the lower inner band. The upper inner band and the lower inner 
band are indicated in Table 1 of the MEFP. The consultation with IMF staff will be on the reasons for 
inflation deviations from the inner band, the stance of monetary policy and the inflation outlook, and 
the CBE’s remedial actions. 
N. Other Continuous Performance Criteria 
31. 
Non-accumulation of external debt payments arrears by the general government. The 
general government comprises the budget sector, the Social Insurance Funds (SIFs), and the National 
Investment Bank (NIB). External debt payments include principal and interest payments, including 
payments on long-term leases. New external debt payments arrears cannot be accumulated during the 
program period. For this performance criterion, an external debt payments arrear is defined as the 
amount of payment obligation (principal and interest) due to nonresidents by the general government 
and the CBE, which has not been made when due under the contract, including any applicable grace 
period. This performance criterion will apply continuously throughout the arrangement. 


ARAB REPUBLIC OF EGYPT 
 
 
INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND 
91 
32. 
Standard continuous performance criteria include: (i) prohibition on the imposition or 
intensification of restrictions on making of payments and transfers for current international transactions; 
(ii) prohibition on the introduction or modification of multiple currency practices; (iii) prohibition on the 
conclusion of bilateral payments agreements that is inconsistent with Article VIII; and (iv) prohibition on 
the imposition or intensification of import restrictions for balance of payments reasons. 
O. Other Structural Benchmarks 
33. 
State-owned companies (SOEs) for the purpose of the structural benchmarks related to their 
management and governance, as well as the leveling of the playing field, are defined as all public 
corporations, regardless of their legal framework and the specific agency in charge of their oversight. 
They cover public sector companies, public business sector companies, military-owned companies, 
economic authorities, and joint ventures and partnerships. 
34. 
Reoccurring (annual) publication of domestic payment arrears for the purpose of the 
structural benchmark is defined as publishing within 90 days after fiscal year end the stocks of 
commitments, overdue payments, and overdue transactions as well as the stock of gross liabilities and 
due payments to and from MOF with EGPC, GASC, NUCA, National Postal Authority, National Authority 
for Egyptian Railways, National Investment Bank, Central Bank of Egypt, Egyptian Electricity Holding 
Company, Holding Company for Drinking Water and Sanitation, and EgyptAir. 
35. 
Reoccurring (quarterly) implementation of the retail fuel indexation mechanism for the 
purpose of the structural benchmark is defined as enacting increases in retail fuel prices in each quarter 
in line with the indexation mechanism formula. The fuel price indexation mechanism will be considered 
fully implemented in quarter 𝑡𝑡 if the retail price of all fuels, including gasoline, diesel, fuel oils (excluding 
fuel oil for bakeries and electricity) is changed by the following computation within a month of the end 
of the quarter: 
𝑚𝑚𝑚𝑚𝑚𝑚{𝑚𝑚𝑚𝑚𝑚𝑚{𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃 𝑐𝑐ℎ𝑎𝑎𝑎𝑎𝑎𝑎𝑎𝑎 𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖 𝑟𝑟𝑟𝑟𝑟𝑟𝑟𝑟𝑟𝑟𝑟𝑟 𝑓𝑓𝑓𝑓𝑓𝑓𝑓𝑓 𝑝𝑝𝑝𝑝𝑝𝑝𝑝𝑝𝑝𝑝𝑡𝑡, 10 𝑝𝑝𝑝𝑝𝑝𝑝𝑝𝑝𝑝𝑝𝑝𝑝𝑝𝑝}, −10 𝑝𝑝𝑝𝑝𝑝𝑝𝑝𝑝𝑝𝑝𝑝𝑝𝑝𝑝}

• 
The retail fuel price in quarter 𝑡𝑡 is the price in end-quarter in domestic currency.  
• 
𝐵𝐵𝐵𝐵𝐵𝐵𝐵𝐵𝐵𝐵𝑡𝑡−1 is the average Brent crude oil price in the U.S. dollar in the previous quarter, 𝐹𝐹𝐹𝐹𝑡𝑡−1 is the 
average exchange rate of the Egyptian pound against the U.S. dollar in the previous quarter, and 0.8 
is the share of oil in the production cost of fuel products. For gasoline and diesel, the change is 
rounded to multiples of 25 piasters. The Ministry of Petroleum will provide the relevant data.  
• 
Annual adjustment due to other costs. Adjustments to other direct and indirect costs, as identified 
from the fuel subsidy table (percent change in per unit costs), are included on an annual basis in the 


ARAB REPUBLIC OF EGYPT

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND 
second quarter of the fiscal year. Adjustments due to other direct and indirect costs are zero in the 
remaining quarters of the fiscal year. The Ministry of Petroleum will provide the relevant data.  
• 
Catchup adjustment. Because the changes in retail fuel price are capped at 10 percent in absolute 
value, any adjustments not fully implemented in one quarter will result in additional adjustment in 
the following quarter, giving rise to the term 𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶ℎ𝑢𝑢𝑢𝑢 𝐴𝐴𝐴𝐴𝐴𝐴𝐴𝐴𝐴𝐴𝐴𝐴𝐴𝐴𝐴𝐴𝐴𝐴𝐴𝐴𝑡𝑡−1. The catchup adjustment is 
taken to be zero for the adjustment in the third quarter of FY2022/23. Given that the full impact of 
higher global oil prices and exchange rate depreciation was not fully passed through in FY2021/22, 
retail fuel prices will not be reduced during a transition period and the catchup adjustment and the 
pass-through from changes in crude oil prices in domestic currency will not be negative. This 
transition period will conclude once the level of fuel subsidies for products covered by the 
mechanism (that is, the above-mentioned fuel products) in the previous fiscal year has been 
eliminated. 
36. 
CBE subsidized lending initiatives for the purpose of the structural benchmark is defined as 
schemes, both existing and new, where the CBE provides subsidies to financial institutions based on 
loans those institutions extend to predefined sectors or households at predefined interest rates. Existing 
schemes include, but are not limited to, the mortgage finance initiative for middle-income class, the 
industrial, agricultural, and construction private sectors initiative, and the tourism sector initiative and 
that aimed at substituting cars to work with dual fuel. As of December 31, 2023, the total amount of 
loans utilized under the subsidized lending schemes was EGP 73.2 billion. 
37. 
CBE lending to public agencies excluding the Ministry of Finance. For the purpose of the 
structural benchmark, the CBE would issue a strategy, approved by the CBE Board, that details how its 
claims on public agencies excluding the Ministry of Finance will be reduced to zero. For each 
outstanding claim, the strategy would detail either i) the timing and entities involved in repaying the 
claim to the CBE; or ii) Transferring the claim off the balance sheet of the CBE. 
 
38. 
Reoccurring (monthly) publication of public procurement awards for the purpose of the 
structural benchmark post within 30-day of the previous month’s end reports that comprise 
procurement awards greater than EGP 20 million made by budget sector units during the previous 
month and the previous month’s findings from General Authority for Government Services (GAGS) on-
site post-procurement audits of budget unit procurement awards, which will be selected at random. The 
monthly reports will be posted on the GAGS website, accessible in Egypt, and the Ministry of Finance 
website, accessible internationally. 
P. Monitoring and Reporting Requirements 
39. 
 Performance under the program will be monitored using the data reported by the Ministry of 
Finance and the CBE to the IMF, with frequency and submission lag indicated in Table 1A and Table 1B. 
Data are defined consistently with the program definitions above. In addition to the items listed in Table 
1A and Table 1B, the CAPMAS will report data on inflation to the IMF, with submission lag of no more 
than 10 business/working days after each test date. In case of any data revisions, the authorities will 
transmit to the IMF immediately.

THIRD REVIEW UNDER THE EXTENDED ARRANGEMENT 
UNDER THE EXTENDED FUND FACILITY, MONETARY POLICY 
CONSULTATION CLAUSE, REQUESTS FOR A WAIVER OF 
NONOBSERVANCE OF A PERFORMANCE CRITERION, A 
WAIVER OF APPLICABILITY OF A PERFORMANCE CRITERION, 
AND MODIFICATION OF PERFORMANCE CRITERIA—
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION, REVISED PROPOSED 
DECISION, AND SUPPLEMENTARY LETTER OF INTENT 
Approved By 
Taline Koranchelian 
and Mark Flanagan 
Prepared by the Middle East and Central Asia Department. 
 
 
This supplement provides an update on recent developments and program performance 
since issuance of the staff report on June 26, 2024. The update does not alter the thrust of 
the staff appraisal.  
 
1.      
Headline consumer price inflation declined for the fourth consecutive 
month in a row in June 2024 to 27.5 percent (y/y). This is below the upper outer limit 
of the Monetary Policy Consultation band and above the upper inner band, requiring a 
consultation with staff. In their consultation with staff, the authorities underlined that 
their forecast suggests that inflation has peaked and in the absence of external shocks, 
inflation is expected to moderate further in 2024 even with increases in administrative 
prices. A significant decline in inflation is anticipated in 2025 Q1 due to the combined 
impact of monetary policy tightening, subsiding impact of previously existing market 
imbalances and a favorable base effect.  The authorities emphasized that they will 
continue to conduct monetary policy decisions in a data-dependent manner, and stand 
ready to take action if data outturns signal deviations from their projected inflation path 
towards achieving their target. Moreover, on July 18, 2024, the Monetary Policy 
Committee left policy rates unchanged judging that the current monetary stance is 
appropriate to support the sustained moderation of inflation. 
2.      
Net international reserves (NIR) on June 30, 2024, based on the program’s 
definition, were US$38,194 million. Because the NIR outturn for end-June 2024 
July 24, 2024 


ARAB REPUBLIC OF EGYPT

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND 
became available before the Executive Board’s consideration of the third review under the extended 
arrangement under the Extended Fund Facility, the authorities no longer request modification and a 
waiver of applicability for the quantitative performance criterion (QPC) on NIR at end-June 2024. In 
addition, the QPC floor on NIR at end-June 2024 reverts to the floor of US$30,329 million approved 
by the Board at the completion of the first and second reviews. The related memorandum items for 
end-June 2024 are also restated to the those at completion of the first and second reviews. The 
attached Letter of Intent (Updated LOI) dated July 24, 2024, (Attachment) includes a revised table 
reporting on the status of quantitative performance criteria and indicative targets, and updates the 
LOI dated June 25, 2024, for these changes.  
3.      
The adjusted QPC on NIR for end-June 2024 of US$37,608 million was met in part 
thanks to the central bank’s purchase of foreign exchange in June. The NIR floor was adjusted 
upward by US$7,279 billion, mainly due to the adjuster on the holdings of local currency government 
T-bills and T-bonds held by non-residents, which were significantly higher at end-June 2024 relative 
to program projections at the completion of the first and second reviews. Specifically, the NIR floor 
was adjusted upwards by 50 percent of the excess in the present value of the stock of local currency 
government T-bills and T-bonds held by nonresidents at end-May 2024 (US$16,533 million) relative 
to projections at the completion of the first and second reviews (US$1,850 million).1  
4.      
The continuous performance criteria on the balance of central bank lending to public 
agencies excluding the Ministry of Finance and accumulation of external debt payment arrears 
by the general government were also met. Final data to assess performance relative to the QPC on 
the budget sector primary balance is not available and there is no evidence that the QPC would not 
be met In addition, the authorities met the indicative targets (ITs) for end-June 2024 related to 
foreign exchange sales, but missed the target on the average maturity of gross local currency debt 
issuance by a de minimis amount.  Data to assess the other ITs is not available. 
5.      
The authorities did not meet the end-June 2024 structural benchmark to create an 
indicator to track implementation of the State Ownership Policy. The authorities explained that 
this was a particularly complex indicator to put together, sensitive to subjective interpretation, and 
there is limited international experience and agreed standards to guide its construction. As a result, 
they requested additional time to develop the indicator in consultation with staff. The authorities 
propose, and staff agrees, that the structural benchmark be rephased to end-September 2024 to 
allow for the desired consultation.  
6.      
Staff continues to recommend the completion of the review and approval of the waiver 
requests as set forth in the staff report, the authorities’ original LOI, the Memorandum of 
Economic and Financial Policies (MEFP), the Technical Memorandum of Understanding (TMU), 
and the authorities’ updated LOI (attached). 
 
1 Three adjustors were applied for: (i) deviations in the present value of the stock of local currency government T-bills 
and T-bonds (adjusted upwards by US$ 7,342 million); (ii) deviations in program disbursements (adjusted downwards 
by US$53 million); and (iii) repo margin calls (adjusted downwards by US$ 9.5 million). The adjustor on net external 
borrowing from private creditors in foreign currency was not applied as this borrowing was lower-than-projected and 
the adjustor only applies to an excess of financing relative to projections.

Dear Ms. Georgieva: 
This letter updates the Letter of Intent (LOI) dated June 25, 2024. Specifically, we are no longer 
requesting a modification and waiver of applicability of the end-June 2024 quantitative performance 
criterion on net international reserves, as the relevant data became available before the Executive 
Board meeting date showing that it was met.  
We also reaffirm the other requests and commitments we made in the LOI of June 25, 2024, and 
remain confident that the policies that underpin our program will help preserve macroeconomic 
stability and ensure the achievement of our program objectives. 
We consent to the IMF’s publication of this updated letter and the accompanying Executive Board 
supplement.

This additional supplement provides an update on program performance since issuance of 
the staff report on June 26, 2024 and the supplementary information on July 24, 2024. 
This does not alter the thrust of the staff appraisal. 
 
1.      
The quantitative performance criteria (QPC) on the balance of the 
government’s overdraft account at the CBE was breached in July 2024. Staff learned 
that the balance exceeded the weekly ceiling for the weeks ending July 10 and July 18, 
primarily due to large debt repayments and cyclically lower tax collections in July (see 
footnote 8 in Table 1 for the magnitude of the breach in July). The balance had also 
exceeded the ceiling for the weeks ending April 18 through May 23 as highlighted in the 
staff report. The authorities explained that the deviation in July was temporary and was 
corrected by July 23, with the balance falling significantly below the program’s ceiling. 
To prevent the breach from reoccurring, the authorities committed to strengthening 
cash and debt management, and to developing an enhanced system to forecast cash 
needs and timely adjust domestic debt issuance plans by the next program review. 
2.      
The authorities raised retail fuel prices on July 25, 2024. In particular, they 
raised the prices of Octane 92 by 10 percent, Octane 80 and Octane 95 by 11 percent 
(all gasoline grades), and diesel prices by 15 percent. This is an important step by the 
authorities towards delivering on their plan to reach their cost recovery level by 
December 2025.

Staff continues to recommend the completion of the review and approval of the waiver 
requests as set forth in the staff report, the authorities’ original Letter of Intent (LOI) dated 
June 25, 2024 as supplemented on July 24, 2024, the Memorandum of Economic and Financial 
Policies (MEFP), the Technical Memorandum of Understanding (TMU), and the authorities’ 
updated LOI (attached). Staff supports updating the request for a waiver of nonobservance for the 
QPC on the balance of the overdraft account of the government at the CBE to also include the weeks 
ending July 10 and 18 because this breach was temporary and corrective action has been taken.

Managing Director 
International Monetary Fund 
700 19th Street, NW 
Washington, D.C. 20431 
 
Dear Ms. Georgieva: 
This letter updates the Letter of Intent (LOI) dated June 25, 2024 and July 24, 2024. 
With respect to our request for a waiver of non-observance of the weekly ceiling on the balance of 
the government’s overdraft account at the CBE for the weeks ending April 18 through May 23, 
inclusive, the balance also exceeded the weekly ceiling for the weeks ending July 10 and July 18, 
primarily due to large debt repayments and cyclically lower tax collections in July. The deviation was 
temporary and was corrected by the subsequent week. Going forward, we will strengthen cash and 
debt management, and develop an enhanced system to forecast our cash needs and timely adjust 
domestic debt issuance plans by the next program review. Therefore, we would like to request a 
waiver that also covers the periods in July (the weeks ending July 10 and 18) for which a breach of 
the QPC on the balance of the overdraft account of the Treasury at the CBE was observed. 
We also reaffirm the other requests and commitments we made in the earlier LOIs and remain 
confident that the policies that underpin our program will help preserve macroeconomic stability and 
ensure the achievement of our program objectives. 
We consent to the IMF’s publication of this updated letter and the accompanying Executive Board 
supplement.

MOZAMBIQUE: IMF Executive Board Completes Fourth 
Review under Extended Credit Facility and 2024 Article IV 
Consultation 
FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE 
• The IMF Executive Board completed the Fourth Review under the Extended Credit Facility 
(ECF) Arrangement, providing Mozambique with immediate access about US$60.03 million.  
• Program performance has been mixed. Three out of four structural benchmarks (SBs) were 
met, and two out of four quantitative performance criteria (QPCs) were observed.  
• The IMF Executive Board also completed the 2024 Article IV Consultation. Discussions 
focused on (i) wage bill rationalization for a sustainable and cost-effective provision of 
public services, (ii) the role of state-owned enterprises (SOEs) and policies to improve their 
governance and transparency, and (iii) drivers of exchange rate stability since mid-2021. 
Washington, DC — July 8, 2024: The Executive Board of the International Monetary Fund 
(IMF) completed the 2024 Article IV Consultation and the Fourth Review under Mozambique’s 
three-year Extended Credit Facility (ECF) arrangement. The Executive Board’s decision 
allows for an immediate disbursement of SDR 45.44 million (about US$60.03 million), usable 
for budget support, bringing Mozambique’s total disbursements under the ECF arrangement to 
SDR 249.92 million (about US$330.14 million). The three-year ECF arrangement aims to 
support Mozambique’s economic recovery and reduce public debt and financing 
vulnerabilities, while fostering higher and more inclusive growth through structural reforms. 
Program performance has been mixed. Three of four SBs were met as of end-June 2024, and 
two of four QPCs were observed. Based on remedial actions adopted by the authorities as 
well as the minor and temporary nature of the nonobservance, the Executive Board approved 
waivers of nonobservance of (i) the continuous performance criterion on non-accumulation of 
new public and publicly guaranteed external payment arrears, which was missed due to 
operational constraints related to debt management; and (ii) the performance criterion on the 
domestic primary balance, which was missed, in part due to higher than expected wage-bill 
spending and debt service.  
Inflation, which has continued to moderate, was within the Monetary Policy Consultation 
Clause (MPCC) band. The Executive Board also completed the financing assurances review 
and approved the authorities’ requests for modification of the MPCC and the quantitative 
performance criterion on domestic primary budget balance. 
Following the approval of the Sovereign Wealth Fund Law by Parliament in December 2023, 
the adoption of implementing regulations in early 2024 was another important step toward 
ensuring transparent and sound management of natural resources wealth. Going forward, 
continued fiscal consolidation efforts are warranted to reduce financing needs and contain 
debt vulnerabilities, while creating fiscal space for social spending to protect the most 
vulnerable. With inflation expectations well anchored, ongoing fiscal consolidation, and weak 
non-mining growth, there is scope for further gradual monetary policy easing. 


2 
Following the Executive Board’s discussion, Mr. Bo Li, Deputy Managing Director and acting 
Chair, issued the following statement: 
“Economic growth is positive but expected to moderate, with tight financial conditions acting 
as a drag on activity. While inflation pressures have declined, Mozambique faces significant 
risks, mainly from adverse climate events and the fragile security situation. In the context of 
the mixed program performance, the authorities are focused on measures to ensure 
macroeconomic stability and address debt vulnerabilities, and reforms to promote broad-
based, inclusive, and sustainable growth. 
“The authorities’ efforts to ensure fiscal discipline are welcome. Further fiscal consolidation is 
needed, given Mozambique’s high debt and tight financing conditions. In this regard, revenue 
mobilization and wage bill spending rationalization are essential to create fiscal space for high-
priority social and development spending. Improving social spending execution and avoiding 
future arrears remain paramount. 
“A tight monetary policy stance has helped to contain inflationary pressures and rebuild FX 
reserves. With the weak outlook for non-mining growth, well-anchored inflation expectations, 
and continued fiscal consolidation, a gradual easing of the monetary policy stance is 
appropriate. A carefully calibrated fiscal and monetary policy mix is key to preserving 
macroeconomic stability. Improving monetary policy transmission by deepening the interbank, 
money, and foreign exchange markets remains important for improved macroeconomic 
management. Allowing greater exchange rate flexibility is necessary to enhance resilience to 
external shocks. Further progress in enhancing the AML/CFT framework is also warranted.  
“Progress continued across the governance and fiscal structural agenda, including with the: (i) 
publication of a Decree Law requiring the collection of beneficial ownership information; (ii) 
publication of financial risk indicators of state-owned enterprises (SOEs); and (iii) monthly 
cash flow forecasts by Treasury to inform budget execution. Efforts to strengthen revenue 
administration, public financial management, debt management, and SOE operations are 
essential to put fiscal policy on a stronger footing. Continued capacity development, including 
in the operation of the Sovereign Wealth Fund, remains essential for strengthening 
institutional capacity and allowing Mozambique to achieve its development objectives. 
Measures to build resilience to climate change and accelerate progress on addressing 
gender-based disparities are also crucial.”

REPUBLIC OF MOZAMBIQUE 
STAFF REPORT FOR THE 2024 ARTICLE IV CONSULTATION, 
FOURTH REVIEW UNDER THE THREE-YEAR ARRANGEMENT 
UNDER THE EXTENDED CREDIT FACILITY, REQUESTS FOR 
MODIFICATIONS OF QUANTITATIVE PERFORMANCE CRITERIA, 
WAIVER OF NONOBSERVANCE OF QUANTITATIVE 
PERFORMANCE CRITERIA, AND FINANCING ASSURANCES 
REVIEW    
EXECUTIVE SUMMARY 
Context. Economic growth is tepid, with tight financial conditions continuing to act as a drag on 
activity. Inflation pressures have declined sharply reflecting lower international fuel and food prices 
and subdued domestic demand. About 60 percent of the population is below the poverty line. A 
fiscal correction is ongoing, albeit at a slower pace than planned, following the fiscal slippages from 
the single salary scale reform adopted in 2022. The security situation in the north remains fragile 
and general elections are scheduled for October 9, 2024.  
Outlook and risks. GDP growth is projected to moderate to 4.3 percent in 2024, though non-
mining growth will pick up. Non-LNG growth is projected at 4 percent over the medium term—well 
below the growth rate in the period before performance prior to the “undisclosed debts” scandal 
emerged in 2016. Headline growth is expected to accelerate sharply in 2028, once large LNG 
projects start producing. Fiscal slippages, tighter domestic financing, delays to LNG projects, natural 
disasters, and weaker economic activity from tight monetary policy are downside risks. Upside risks 
include the realization of additional LNG projects, higher global demand for LNG, and favorable 
weather for the agricultural season.  
Program performance. Performance under the program has been mixed. The performance criteria 
(PCs) on net international reserves, and zero ceiling on non-concessional external debt were met 
and inflation is within the Monetary Policy Consultation Clause band. The PC on the domestic 
primary balance was missed, and the continuous PC on non-accumulation of new external arrears 
was breached. The indicative targets on the domestic debt stock and present value of new external 
debt were met. The floor on social spending was missed for the third consecutive review. Progress 
on structural reforms has been satisfactory, with three out of four structural benchmarks met.  
Article IV. The Article IV discussions focused on (i) wage bill rationalization for a sustainable and 
cost-effective provision of public services, (ii) the role of state-owned enterprises (SOEs) and policies 
to improve their governance and transparency, and (iii) drivers of exchange rate stability since mid-
2021.  
Policy recommendations. Continued fiscal consolidation is vital to reduce domestic financing 
needs and contain public debt vulnerabilities. With inflation expectations well anchored, ongoing 
fiscal consolidation, and weak non-mining growth, further gradual easing of monetary policy is

warranted. Sustained efforts to strengthen institutions, improve governance and enhance transparency 
are important to reduce corruption vulnerabilities, promote private investment, support domestic 
production, and strengthen the external sector position. 
Future conditionality and reform priorities. Important reform measures will be implemented in several 
areas, aimed at strengthening tax compliance, achieving a more cost-effective provision of public services, 
improving procurement transparency, protecting spending for the most vulnerable, and improving the 
management and oversight of SOEs. A new QPC on social spending and a new IT on domestic spending 
arrears are proposed.

Mozambique, a low-income and fragile country with pressing development needs, has 
shown resilience to a series of economic and climactic shocks. Real GDP per capita, which fell by 
around 5 percent during the pandemic, is expected to surpass pre-pandemic levels in 2024. However, 
about 60 percent of the population are poor (Figure 1), 12 percentage points higher compared to 
2015 (just before the hidden debt scandal). While security conditions in the North have broadly 
improved since the regional military intervention started in 2021, violent attacks have recently 
become more frequent in Cabo Delgado.  
2. 
Social conditions remain fragile and challenged by recurring natural disasters and 
limited humanitarian support. Ongoing security challenges (with 670,000 people internally 
displaced) and climate-related disasters mean that about 2.2 million people are in need of urgent 
humanitarian assistance and protection, and more than 3 million (about 10 percent of the 
population) face acute food insecurity, with about one third of them being in Cabo Delgado 
province.1 Significant lack of funding for humanitarian assistance (most notably UNHCR and WFP) is 
aggravating the security situation.  
3. 
Putting the fiscal position on a stronger footing remains a key challenge, amidst large 
development needs, important governance weaknesses and high vulnerability to climate 
change. Public debt is too high and risky for a country with low debt-carrying capacity (DSA Annex). 
Several structural barriers need to be lifted to unleash the country’s growth potential. Human capital 
gaps in terms of health and education of workers are significant. The agriculture sector employs a 
large fraction of the labor force, but its productivity is low and there is high food insecurity. There are 
several impediments to private investment, including restricted access to credit, infrastructure gaps, 
and weak governance. The overall response to Fund’s past advice has been positive but with slow 
progress in some areas (Annex I).  
4. 
The National Development Strategy (ENDE) for 2025-44 lays out the strategic 
guidelines for economic growth and sustainable development. The main objectives of ENDE 
include improving infrastructure, increasing productivity and competitiveness, promoting economic 
diversification, strengthening governance and transparency, fostering inclusiveness, mitigating 
poverty, and accelerating environmental sustainability. The government reached out to civil society 
and other stakeholders (including the World Bank) for feedback on ENDE. ENDE was approved by the 
Council of Ministers on June 11, 2024, and submitted to Parliament (Annex V).

RECENT ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENTS 
5. 
Recent economic activity has been mixed, with a strong mining sector amid modest 
non-mining growth. Growth for 2023 is 
estimated at 5.4 percent, with agriculture at 3.9 
percent and overall non-mining growth at 2.2 
percent—well below the estimated potential of 4 
percent. Momentum appears to have slowed, with 
real growth in Q4 2023 at 5.4 percent yoy, down 
from 5.9 percent in Q3, as the contribution from 
the ramp-up of the country’s first LNG project is 
beginning to fade (Text Figure 1). The PMI points 
to muted growth into Q1 2024 (Figure 2). Inflation 
has decelerated, to 3.1 percent yoy in May 2024 
(core inflation to 3.7 percent), below the center of 
the BM’s target band of 0-10 percent (Figure 2). In 
the medium term, inflation is expected to remain 
in the single digits. The TotalEnergies LNG project that was stopped in March 2021 (due to security 
issues) is expected to restart in 2024. 
6. 
The Bank of Mozambique (BM) has eased monetary policy, but the overall stance 
remains restrictive. The policy rate has been reduced by 225bp in 2024, to 15.0 percent, with the 
Monetary Policy Committee providing forward guidance for a normalization over the coming 2 to 3 
years. Due to the continued fall in inflation, the ex post real policy rate remains near 12 percent 
which, combined with high reserve requirements (39 percent), constitute a tight monetary stance. 
The prime lending rate stood at 22.0 percent in June 2024, down from 24.1 percent at end-2023.  
7. 
Systemic risks are assessed as unchanged compared to the last Article IV, as the 
financial system remains stable amid tight financial conditions. NPLs have fallen to 8.2 percent 
at end-2023, from 9.3 percent at the time of the last Article IV in 2022 (Table 6). At the same time, 
measures of banks’ capital have increased during 2023. Returns on assets and equity improved as 
well towards end-2023, but the latter remains low compared to averages over recent years. Credit to 
the economy contracted during 2023 for the first time in several years (Table 3), weighing on 
manufacturing and construction. 
8. 
The external position is assessed as substantially weaker than the level implied by 
fundamentals and desirable policies (Figure 4, Annex II). The underlying non-megaproject current 
account deficit is estimated at 19.2 percent of GDP in 2023, about 11.8 percentage point of GDP 
above the norm.2 Gross international reserves have recovered to 4.3 months of non-megaproject 
imports, supported by BM’s discontinuation of the FX window to cover fuel import bill and by the 
increase in reserve requirements for FX deposits (Figure 4). The exchange rate against the US dollar 
has remained stable (Figures 3 and 4) and progress with increasing exchange rate flexibility has been 
slower than expected in the last Article IV (Annex I). A combination of policies to manage FX 
 
2 Megaprojects are large-scale projects in the extractive sector that are funded and led by foreign companies.

demand, together with a preference of the private sector for exchange rate stability (in the absence 
of good hedging options), as well as after-effects of supervision in the past may all have contributed 
to exchange rate stability.  
9. 
 Following the significant wage bill overruns in 2022, a large fiscal correction took 
place in 2023 (though less than 
expected in the Third Review). The 
domestic primary balance (excluding LNG 
revenues and other one-offs) improved by 
2.6 ppt of GDP, about 0.5 ppt less than 
projected mainly due to payment of 
overdue extra hours in health and 
education, and additional allowances and 
subsidies in the health sector (Text Table 
1). Above-budgeted spending on goods 
and services was mostly offset by a 
shortfall in subsidies and transfers 
(including social spending).  Spending 
arrears were significant and reached 1.8 
percent of GDP by end 2023 compared to 
0.7 percent of GDP by end 2022 (Table 
2b). Public debt declined from 100 
percent of GDP at end-2022 to about 94 
percent of GDP at end-2023, driven by a sharp reduction of the external debt-to-GDP ratio in a 
context of limited external financing and strong nominal GDP growth. The domestic primary balance 
path during 2022-23 was lower than projected in the last Article IV while the increase of domestic 
debt and the associated interest payments were much higher (Text Figures 2 and 3 and Annex I).

PROGRAM PERFORMANCE   
10. 
Program performance on macroeconomic targets has been mixed, with satisfactory 
progress on structural reforms. 
• 
The end-December 2023 Performance Criteria (PC) on NIR, and zero ceiling on non-
concessional external debt were met, and inflation was within the MPCC band (Text 
Table 2). The ITs on the ceiling on the domestic debt stock and present value (PV) of new 
external debt were met. However, the PC on the domestic primary balance (DPB) was missed 
and the continuous PC on non-accumulation of new external arrears was breached. The 
indicative target on the floor on social spending was missed for the third consecutive review 
by a wide margin, due to unexpected spending pressures arising from higher-than-budgeted 
domestic debt service and wage bill payments, and implementation bottlenecks (Annex V). 
• 
The authorities incurred short-term arrears on external debt service earlier in 2024: in 
January with India ($0.9 million), Korea ($0.1 million), and Nordea Bank ($0.9 million), and in 
February with the Arab Bank for Economic Development in Africa ($0.3 million). These arrears, 
which were incurred due to operational constraints related to debt management, have been 
settled fully. Agreements on resolving arrears owed to Brazil and Libya (pre-HIPC arrear) were 
reached in 2022 and 2023, but the start of repayment is still pending. The authorities are also 
working to reach agreements on repayments of pre-HIPC debt with Angola and Iraq.3   
• 
Three structural benchmarks (SBs) out of four were met (Table 10). Submission to the 
Council of Ministers and publication of a Decree Law requiring the collection of beneficial 
ownership information for all entities (end-March 2024 SB); (ii) publication of financial risks 
indicators of SOEs (end-June 2024 SB); and (iii) monthly cash flow forecasts by Treasury to 
inform budget execution (end-June 2024 SB) were met. Despite progress, the general audit 
and “proof of life” of all public sector servants was not met due to continued operational 
bottlenecks (end-June 2024 SB); it is now expected to be achieved by end-December 2024.  
 
3 Given that a representative Paris Club agreement covers the claim, this means that the pre-HIPC arrears with Angola, 
Bulgaria, Iraq, Libya, and Poland are deemed away under the IMF Lending Into Official Arrears policy. Agreement has 
been reached with Libya, with repayment expected to start as soon as Libya’s Minister of Finance signs. Brazil has 
consented to Fund financing notwithstanding these arrears.

MACROECONOMIC OUTLOOK AND RISKS  
11. 
GDP growth is projected to decelerate amid tight financial conditions, with inflation 
stabilizing near the center of the BM’s target range. Overall growth is expected to decline from 
5.4 percent in 2023 to 4.3 percent in 2024, as the contribution from the ramp-up of the Coral South 
LNG project fades. Non-mining GDP growth is expected to rise from 2.2 percent in 2023 to 3.5 
percent in 2024. Long-term non-LNG growth is projected at 4 percent—in line with estimates for 
non-LNG potential growth—assuming no positive spillovers from LNG to the rest of the economy. It 
is driven primarily by a large and growing contribution from services and a large, although shrinking, 
contribution from agriculture. Overall growth is projected to accelerate to 10 percent in 2028, once 
the first onshore LNG project, led by Total, is expected to start producing. The second onshore LNG 
project, led by Exxon, is expected to start producing in 2030. 
12. 
The current account 
deficit is projected to persist 
over the medium-term (Text 
Table 3). The current account 
deficit excluding megaprojects is 
expected to gradually decline over 
the medium-term on account of 
tighter fiscal policy and enhanced 
domestic production capacity, 
including in agriculture. The large 
current account deficits related to 
megaprojects during 2025-27 are 
driven by the imports of goods 
and services related to the

development of large LNG projects. As those projects start to produce in 2028, the current account 
balance related to megaprojects turns into surplus. 
13. 
Risks. The balance of risks is to the downside. Exogenous risks, include pandemics, natural 
disasters, intensification of regional conflicts and commodity price volatility, and delays in LNG 
projects. Domestic risks include continued weakness in non-mining growth delaying poverty 
reduction and intensification of social unrest in the North. Fiscal stress due to unanchored wage 
expectations, other spending pressures (including in the pre-election period), and losses from SOEs 
could make it more difficult to rollover domestic debt. Financial stress could emerge from 
persistently high real interest rates (Table 7). Upside risks include the realization of LNG projects (in 
particular, the so-called “Coral North” project) that are not part of the current baseline.  
Authorities’ Views 
14. 
The authorities agreed with staff’s assessment of the outlook and risks. Compared to 
staff, they expect a stronger rebound of economic activity, given the relaxation of monetary policy, 
with real GDP growth of 5.5 percent in 2024, 4.7 percent in 2025 and 5.0 percent in 2026. They also 
expect inflation to respond somewhat faster to the monetary policy loosening.  The authorities agree 
with staff that uncertainty remains significant, especially in light of recurring climatic shocks. 
POLICY DISCUSSIONS 
Continued fiscal consolidation is warranted given tight domestic and external financing conditions and 
to reduce debt vulnerabilities. Wage bill rationalization and continued revenue generation efforts are 
vital to create the fiscal space to meet important social and development spending objectives. With a 
weak outlook for non-mining growth, well-anchored inflation expectations, and a growing debt service 
burden, the tight monetary stance should continue to be eased gradually. Structural reform efforts 
should prioritize strengthening governance, increasing transparency on SOEs’ financial performance 
and government procurement, improving the government’s cash and debt management, and 
developing strong policy and institutional frameworks for managing natural resources.

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND 11 
A.   Fiscal Policy  
15. 
Fiscal consolidation is set to continue in 2024, though by less than envisaged under the 
Third Review due to weaker revenue and higher wage bill spending. The domestic primary 
balance in 2024 is projected at 1 percent of GDP, 1.4 ppt lower than previously projected (Text Table 
4). Tax revenue has been revised down by 0.6 ppt of GDP, as some planned revenue measures were 
not adopted in the 2024 budget law (additional VAT base broadening to include alcoholic beverages 
and mineral products and the introduction of property tax). Even so, that, total revenue is projected 
to increase by about 1 percent of GDP compared to 2023, reflecting the end of temporary VAT 
exemptions (on oil, soap, and sugar), higher income due to a broadening of the base of the  
corporate income tax, and measures to increase non-tax revenue, including a higher concession fee 
on LNG private companies and a higher dividend rate on spectrum auctions (0.4 percent of GDP 
overall).4 Wage bill spending in 2024 is projected to be 0.8 ppt of GDP higher than expected at the 
time of the Third Review, reflecting the carryover from higher than expected wage bill spending in 
2023 (0.5 percent of GDP) and the 13th month salary for 2023 paid in 2024 (about 0.3 percent of 
GDP). That said, the wage bill-to-GDP ratio in 2024 is projected to decline by 0.3 ppt lower than in 
2023, underpinned by a nominal freeze of base salaries (¶20).  
16. 
The debt service burden has been growing steadily. Interest payments are projected at 
4.4 percent of GDP in 2024 up from 4 percent of GDP in 2023, equivalent to 20 percent of tax 
revenue. With declining concessional external financing, the authorities have had to rely increasingly 
on expensive domestic financing.  
17. 
Reducing wage bill spending has been more difficult than expected. Problems in 
implementing a complex single salary scale 
reform resulted in overruns of 3.3 percent of GDP 
in 2022. While determined action helped reduce 
the wage bill by 1.3 ppt of GDP in 2023, this fell 
short of planned reduction of 3 ppt reduction 
planned under the 2023 budget, partly due to 
pressures to increase allowances in the health 
sector. Wage bill spending overruns were possible 
as budget ceilings on wage bill spending are not 
binding in practice (Annex IV, Text Figure 4). 
Wage bill spending presents a heavy burden on 
public finances—equivalent to 72 percent of tax 
revenues in 2023—and crowding out social 
spending and other developmental needs.   
18. 
The authorities are struggling to meet the social spending targets. Social spending in 
2023 was only 36 percent of the budget allocation (equivalent to 0.2 percent of GDP in 2023 and 
lower than the 0.5 percent of GDP average of the past three years). This reflects both spending

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND 
pressures in other areas (notably debt service and the public wage bill), but also technical 
bottlenecks and capacity constraints in making payments. These include limited IT infrastructure to 
effectively manage the beneficiary registry, and difficulties in regularly reaching households in 
remote areas. The authorities are exploring options to create fiscal space for social spending and 
improve efficiency of execution, including digital payments using mobile money (Annex V). To 
enhance commitments and ownership of the authorities’ efforts in safeguarding social spending, 
staff proposed adding a QPC setting a floor on social spending to program conditionality. 
19. 
The authorities face financing pressures from three main sources. First, the recent 
agreement to settle the remaining obligations from the 2015 hidden debt will cost 1 percent of GDP 
(¶34). Second, wage bill spending is projected at 14.8 percent of GDP in 2024, 0.8 ppt of GDP higher 
than the Third Review. Third, net external debt financing is projected to be 0.5 ppt of GDP lower than 
the Third Review. As elections draws closer, and in the absence of additional external financing, the 
government may find market conditions for raising this additional domestic financing more 
challenging. 
20. 
To address these pressures, the authorities are taking measures to contain wage bill 
spending and are mobilizing additional sources of financing. Guided by the wage bill action plan 
endorsed by the Minister of Finance in December 2023 (ECF-R3, Annex IV), the authorities froze base 
salaries in 2024-25 to contain wage bill spending. The authorities have committed to the following 
corrective measures to: (i) eliminate the risk allowance for all non-eligible employees; (ii) revise 
location allowance; (iii) eliminate ghost workers (5,000 employees)—a finding of the ongoing audit of 
public servants; (iv) remove from the payroll all employees who are receiving both wage and pension 
payments concurrently; (v) reduction of the seniority supplement by 50 percent across public sector 
employees (excluding magistrates and doctors) (MEFP, ¶23). External financing now includes World 
Bank budget support grants equivalent to 0.7 percent of GDP (¶27). Domestic financing (including 
government deposits at the central bank) will increase by 0.8 ppt of GDP compared to the Third 
Review, reaching 4.9 percent of GDP (Table 2b). In addition, the authorities have committed to not 
rely on domestic spending arrears to finance the fiscal deficit in 2024, which they did in 2023 (¶9). 
Staff propose adding an indicative target for the ceiling to the stock of domestic arrears. Going 
forward, the authorities plan to gradually pay down the stock of existing domestic arrears.   
21. 
Fiscal risks remain elevated in 2024. Government spending pressures are building due to 
the security issues in Cabo Delgado, the adverse impact of climate shocks on food security, 
unanchored wage expectations, and the general elections on October 9. This could make it more 
difficult to rollover domestic debt.  
22. 
 Under the authorities’ Medium-term Fiscal Framework (MTFF), the fiscal position is 
projected to improve further, primarily due to wage bill rationalization. The authorities have set 
a domestic primary balance (excluding LNG revenues) of about 4 percent of GDP as the medium-
term fiscal anchor (Text Table 5). The domestic primary balance is projected to continue increasing as 
the wage bill is reduced to 10 percent of GDP by 2028 and some improvements in tax 
administration.5 The wage bill is being reduced by commitments to tighten hiring limits, freeze

nominal wages, freeze promotions, and implement the attrition rule—where only one in three 
leaving public employees will be replaced, except in health, education, agricultural extension, and 
administration of justice. In addition, the authorities are considering wage bill reducing measures 
including eliminating some allowances, containing some supplements, and corrective measures to 
address the findings of the ongoing audit of public servants (MEFP, ¶23). The ongoing functional 
review of public employees by the World Bank is a critical exercise, which will provide valuable 
guidance for improving the allocation of human resources and the quality of public service provision. 
Tax administration gains will result from the adoption of electronic filling of all taxes (end-December 
2024 SB).  
23. 
The authorities’ MTFF is broadly consistent with staff medium-term fiscal projections 
except that staff projects a more gradual improvement in the domestic primary balance. The 
authorities’ domestic revenue 
mobilization targets are broadly 
consistent with staff projections; total 
revenue during 2025-27 will average 
about 25 percent of GDP annually. 
While projections are consistent on the 
wage bill spending front (average wage 
bill of 13 percent of GDP), the 
authorities’ expenditure consolidation 
pace is more ambitious on goods and 
services (on average, 2.5 percent of 
GDP reduction, 1 percent more than 
staff projections), and subsidies and 
transfers are lower (at 3 percent of GDP, 
on average, 0.5 percent lower than staff 
projections), which is envisaged to create more fiscal space for domestically financed capital 
spending (at 3.3 percent of GDP, on average, 0.5 percent higher than staff projections). The objective 
of reaching a domestic primary balance of around 4 percent of GDP over the medium term is an 
appropriate fiscal anchor to put public debt on a clear downward path (reaching about 71 percent of 
GDP in 2029, compared to 94 percent in 2023) and reduce public debt vulnerabilities.   
Authorities’ Views 
24. 
The authorities agreed that additional measures are needed to ensure fiscal 
sustainability. They are adopting a mix of additional non-tax revenue measures to compensate for 
the slower than anticipated pace of wage bill adjustment when compared to the approved 2024 
budget. They emphasized challenges in the implementation of the wage bill reform, while reiterating 
their commitment to pursuing wage bill rationalization which they viewed as essential to ensure 
efficient public service delivery and improved competitiveness (MEFP, ¶23). They shared staff’s 
concern in relation to safeguarding social spending to protect the vulnerable and committed to 
adopt mitigating measures and address implementation challenges to ensure the full disbursement 
of the 2024 budget allocation of social spending. In this regard, they are working on digitalization of 
cash transfers, and seeking progress in financial inclusion (see ¶18). Regarding fiscal structural

reforms, they emphasized recent progress in PFM, wage bill control, tax administration, public 
investment management, cash and debt management, and risk management (particularly from 
SOEs). 
B.   Monetary and Financial Policies  
25. 
Further monetary policy easing is warranted in light of the weak economic outlook, 
well-anchored inflation expectations, and further tightening of fiscal policy. With the (ex-post) 
real policy rate around 12 percent, there is a risk that financial conditions remain too tight for too 
long (Text Figure 5). Based on cyclical conditions, the BM has ample scope for further policy rate 
cuts. Given an effective transmission mechanism (the prime lending rate, which is partially linked to 
the policy rate, is down 180bp since end-2023, compared to the 225bp policy rate cut), further 
easing should translate into more supportive financial conditions (Text Figure 6). Assuming 
continued easing of 75 basis points at each MPC meeting in 2024 and 2025, as well as a gradual 
relaxation in required reserve ratios from 39 percent to 10-15 percent, headline inflation is forecast 
to remain between 3 and 4 percent during 2024, while credit growth is forecast to meaningfully 
accelerate only in 2025 as financial conditions ease.

26. 
Reducing high reserve requirements is essential to ease financial conditions. While the 
Mozambican financial system is with a structural liquidity surplus, the significant increases in reserve 
requirements in 2023—from 10.5/11.5 percent to 39.0/39.5 percent (for deposits in local/foreign 
currency)—may have been larger than needed to absorb excess liquidity (Text Figure 7). To reduce 
distortions caused by high reserve requirements (which can act as a tax on the financial system), the 
BM should develop analytical tools to assess the amount of structural excess liquidity and adjust the 
required reserve ratios such that an appropriate amount of trade in outright market operations 
remains to safeguard monetary transmission. More generally, the BM should refrain from using 
reserve requirements as an active policy tool. Over the medium term, BM should also remunerate 
required reserves at the policy rate, while absorbing excess reserves using a Fixed Rate Full Allotment 
modality. High and unremunerated reserve requirements may otherwise increase financial stability 
risks and hamper monetary transmission. 


REPUBLIC OF MOZAMBIQUE 
INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND 15 
27. 
The exchange rate has remained de 
facto stabilized against the US dollar, and 
steps should be taken by the BM to re-
establish flexibility over the medium term 
(Annex II). The BM has developed a revised 
methodology for calculation of the reference 
exchange rate, to be implemented by end-
2024. The new methodology is based on actual 
transactions rather than quotes posted by 
banks on the Meticalnet, and should therefore 
allow the reference rate to reflect the volatility 
in actual transaction rates, aiding the market’s 
price discovery mechanism. Beyond this 
important step, the BM should take additional 
measures to further develop spot and money 
markets in line with recent TA 
recommendations, such as introducing FX 
auctions as the main way of distributing FX to 
the market.  
28. 
While the financial system is relatively stable, the high sovereign-bank nexus presents 
risks (Annex VI). Banks’ claims on the public sector represent about 40 percent of banks’ assets. 
Posing macro-financial risks.6 This compares with about 18 percent on average for other low-income 
countries. Increased access to external concessional loans (in line with the MTDS) and continued 
fiscal consolidation will reduce the government’s reliance on bank financing. 
29. 
Mozambique has continued to make progress in financial inclusion, on the back of 
mobile money. As of end-2023, the number of Mobile Money Operators (MMO) accounts was 
equivalent to 93.2 percent of the adult population, increasing from 67.9 percent from the first 
quarter of 2022. Mobile money continued to be the main driver of financial inclusion, with the 
number of bank accounts showing a slight increase from 29.8 percent to 30.9 of the adult population 
during the same period.   
Authorities’ Views 
30. 
The authorities have indicated that they expect further monetary easing, should 
conditions allow. At the same time, the BM considers their required reserves policy to be well 
calibrated, and existing analytical capabilities to be sufficient to determine the right level. While the 
BM acknowledges that volatility in the exchange rate has been limited, they see this as evidence that 
the exchange rate level is in line with fundamentals, and see no impediments for the market to 
adjust. The authorities concurred with staff’s assessment that the financial system remains stable and 
well capitalized.

31. 
The authorities to some degree 
agree with the external sector assessment. 
They also agree the importance of prudent 
fiscal policy and structural reforms to improve 
external imbalances but see that 
implementation of structural reforms would 
take time. They emphasized that FX 
intervention was already stopped by 2023Q2, 
and that reserves have recovered since then.  
C.   Reducing Debt Vulnerabilities  
32. 
The extensive reliance on domestic 
short-term debt in recent years has 
increased refinancing risks for the 
government. Domestic debt increased from 
19 percent of GDP in 2019 to a peak of about 
28 percent of GDP in 2022. While medium-
term debt has the highest share in total 
domestic debt (50 percent of total domestic 
debt in 2023), short-term debt has increased 
from 19 to 27 percent of total domestic debt 
between 2019 and 2023 (Text Figure 8). In a 
context of rising sovereign yields, the 
authorities have been reluctant to accept 
higher yields on domestic long-term debt. This 
is captured by the bid-to-offer ratios of T-bond 
auctions frequently falling below 100 percent, 
with the average ratio for April and May 2024 
at 62 percent. The spread of T-bill rates over 
the monetary policy rate has also increased 
over the last year, increasing from around 50bp 
(for maturities of 1 year) at the beginning of 
2023, to over 200bp April 2024 (Figure 5, 
bottom right). 
33. 
Given the high level of external debt, 
the external borrowing plan relies only on 
concessional loans. The World Bank and 
African Development Bank plan to provide 
budget support grants of $150 million and $20 
million, respectively, in 2024. The authorities 
are also considering loans from Italy, Arab Bank for Economic Development in Africa (BADEA) and 
Islamic Development Bank, while remaining under the program’s borrowing ceiling (Text Table 6).

the present value would be defined as the nominal/face value.

The initial $50 million disbursement of a $500 million development grant package from the U.S. 
Millennium Challenge Corporation is expected in 2024. 
34. 
Mozambique has reached agreement with creditors to settle the remaining 
outstanding amounts of the 2015 disclosed debt. The settlement covers about $648 million of 
outstanding principal (with a total liability including interest of $1.4 billion), and entails a payment of 
$220 million (1 percent of GDP) during 2024.7 The debt rating remains unchanged from the DSA 
published in January 2024. Given the additional external buffers accumulated by end-2023, the 
country will be able to accommodate the payment.8 
35. 
Implementing the Medium-term Debt Strategy (MTDS) will strengthen debt 
management and budget execution. While the MTDS, developed with support from the IMF and 
the World Bank, aims to increase the share of external concessional financing, the fiscal slippages in 
2022 were largely financed by costly domestic debt. Going forward, as envisaged in the MTDS, the 
authorities should diversify the maturity structure of government securities toward longer-term 
horizon to reduce rollover risks. The authorities should also strengthen their debt management to 
prevent the incurrence of external arrears, leveraging a new database (Meridian) and technical 
assistance programs in related areas. 
Authorities’ Views 
36. 
The authorities broadly agree with the debt sustainability analysis.  The authorities 
recognize the urgency to reduce debt vulnerabilities, and agree with the goal of reducing domestic 
short-term financing guided by the Medium-term Debt Strategy (2023–25). The authorities are 
undertaking actions to prevent external arrears in the future, and emphasize that, in addition to the 
introduction of new debt database, financial programming and better cash management will 
facilitate timely payments.  
D.   Fiscal and Governance Structural Reforms  
37. 
The authorities are developing a fiscal framework to manage future large LNG 
revenues. The SWF law was adopted in December 2023 in line with recommendations in the last 
Article IV (Annex I), and implementing regulations were issued in February 2024. The regulations 
specified various important issues, including the revenue projection methodology, transfer of funds, 
composition and functionality of the investment advisory board, and reporting and auditing practices 
of SWF. The authorities have been working on the management agreement between the government 
and the BM, and the investment policy for the SWF. It is important to keep the momentum to finalize 
and approve all supporting elements of the SWF in line with good practices (with the continued 
support from Norway), and also start effectively operationalizing those in coming months. In the 
implementation stage, and as large revenues materialize, it is crucial to manage the revenues in an

settlement, per TMU (¶5).

efficient, transparent and accountable manner, while containing budget volatility and safeguarding 
macroeconomic stability.  
38. 
Continuing progress in public financial management (PFM) is crucial to help mitigate 
fiscal risks and pressures. Enhancing budget execution control, discipline and transparency should 
be prioritized, which will be supported by ongoing PFM efforts, such as, on increasing the coverage 
of treasury single account, improving cash management, and integrating procurement processes into 
e-SISTAFE. Continuing efforts toward digitalization of tax filing and payments will help mobilize 
domestic revenues. Building capacity to effectively integrate climate change into the selection criteria 
of public investment projects is a priority given the severity and frequency of climate shocks, with 
also support from the recent IMF C-PIMA mission (¶ 45).  
39. 
Improving the availability and accessibility of timely information on the SOE sector is 
critical to contain fiscal costs and risks (Selected Issues Paper). Ministry of Economy and Finance 
(MEF) published a comprehensive assessment of the financial health of the SOE sector with IMF 
support, including SOEs’ financial risk indicators (end-June 2024 SB). Going forward, MEF will publish 
data on arrears between SOEs, and between SOEs and the state (end-March 2025 SB). Moreover, 
a Ministerial Diploma requiring IGEPE (Instituto De Gestão Das Participações Do Estado) and SOEs to 
publish SOEs’ procurement policies and annual procurement plans will be published by MEF by end-
February 2025, and IGEPE will also publish the procurement policies for 10 SOEs by end-December 
2024, to help tackle corruption risks (end-February 2025 SB).  
40. 
Tackling governance weaknesses to help reduce vulnerabilities to corruption remains 
a macro-critical issue. The authorities have continued progress, but stronger implementation of 
anti-corruption efforts is needed to mitigate macro-critical corruption risks in Mozambique (Annex 
VIII). The government submitted to the National Assembly amendments to the Public Probity Law 
seeking to strengthen the overall asset declarations and conflicts of interest systems in November 
2023, which were discussed and approved in May 2024.9 Authorities should prioritize the roll out of 
the electronic platform for filing declarations and step-up verification efforts. It is also crucial to 
improve transparency of audit processes, and amend the legal framework to require timely 
publication of final/full audit reports by audited entities (MEFP ¶ 30). Another important area of 
action to mitigate vulnerabilities to corruption is transparency of government procurement. UFSA 
has recently started to publish quarterly data on procurement including modalities of processes 
(competitive versus non-competitive). It will publish information on beneficial owners of large 
procurement contracts alongside other basic information (end-September 2024 SB). Going forward, 
UFSA should improve available procurement statistics by publishing detailed data on modalities of 
procurement processes by the largest spending entities to facilitate risk-based monitoring and 
detection of corruption (MEFP ¶ 48) (Annex VIII). 
41. 
Efforts to strengthen the AML/CFT framework by addressing priorities identified in the 
action plan to exit the grey list adopted by the FATF in 2022 should accelerate. Ensuring 
progress in registering beneficial ownership following the approval of the Decree Law -requiring the 
reporting of beneficial ownership information by all entities- (end-March 2024 SB) remains crucial to

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND 19 
advance the AML/CFT agenda. CREL (Conservatória do Registo da Entidades Legais) has been 
preparing an action plan and guidance to enable effective and timely collection of information on 
beneficial owners. It remains important to ensure the timely access of competent authorities to this 
information in line with the FATF Recommendations and the FATF definition of beneficial owner.  
Authorities’ Views 
42. 
The authorities have a strong commitment to manage LNG revenue transparently, 
efficiently, and in an accountable manner, with a goal of ensuring intergenerational equity. For 
this purpose, a Sovereign Wealth Fund (SWF) was approved by Parliament in December 2023, 
followed by regulations to implement the law in February 2024. 
43. 
The authorities shared staff’s view on the importance of efforts toward improving 
PFM, and noted the ongoing efforts as highlighted by staff.  
44. 
The authorities highlighted the ongoing progress in governance and reiterated their 
commitment to address remaining weaknesses. They shared staff’s view on the importance of 
accelerating efforts, which will also help mitigate corruption risks. The authorities are committed to 
making progress in the oversight, monitoring and transparency of the SOE sector. They also continue 
efforts towards transparency of government procurement, with important steps, such as the ongoing 
work for publication of detailed data on procurement modalities and information on beneficial 
owners for large contracts. They noted that the AML/CFT agenda is on track with necessary changes 
in the legal framework, including legal changes enabling them to collect the beneficial ownership 
information for all entities.   
E.   Climate Change and Gender Equality 
45. 
The authorities expressed interest in the Resilience and Sustainability Facility (RSF) to 
tackle structural impediments to building resilience to climate change and pandemic 
preparedness. The World Bank’s 2023 Country Climate and Development Report (CCDR) and the 
IMF’s 2024 Climate-Public Investment Management Assessment (Climate-PIMA) are informing the 
authorities’ policy priorities and potential reforms, guided by national climate priorities and 
strategies, including Mozambique’s energy transition strategy by 2050, which seeks $80bn in 
investment to boost renewable energy capacity and increase access to electricity. Climate-PIMA 
findings recognized Mozambique’s improvements in the PIM institutional arrangements with the 
reform of the Public Financial Management (PFM) system since 2020 (SISTAFE Law) and the national 
public investment system (SNIP) which is under gradual implementation. Among high priority reform 
areas identified are improving the fiscal framework for sustainable public investment, introducing 
fiscal rules, and continuing to enhance fiscal risks analysis, strengthening cash management and 
commitment control to ensure projects are timely paid and within budget. In addition, various public 
health agencies and development partners are closely engaged with the government and the IMF to 
help implement reform strategies.  
46. 
To set the path for inclusive and sustainable growth, the authorities should accelerate 
efforts to mitigate gender inequalities. The National Strategy to Prevent and Combat Child 
Marriage (2016–2019), and the National Plan to Prevent and Combat Gender-based Violence (GBV) 


REPUBLIC OF MOZAMBIQUE 
20 
INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND 
(2018–2021) and IV National Plan of Action for Advancement of Women in 2018 were adopted to 
address GBV and ensure women’s participation in decision making processes. While a multifaceted 
and holistic approach is needed to continue the progress toward gender equality in both 
opportunities and outcomes, the authorities should accelerate efforts to close gender-based gaps in 
human capital (via ensuring girls’ enrollment in schools as well as their stay in education), and 
improve employment opportunities for women.10  
Authorities’ Views 
47. 
Authorities shared staff’s view on the macro-criticality of climate and gender issues, 
and remain committed to continue progress in addressing challenges related to climate 
change and supporting gender equality. 
PROGRAM MODALITIES AND RISKS   
48. 
Proposal for new PCs and modifications and settings of existing PCs, ITs, and the MPCC 
band up to end-December 2024 are presented in Table 9 and additional SBs in Table 10. 
• 
Modification upwards of the QPC on the floor of the DPB to lock in fiscal effort (end-June 
2024 through end-December 2024). 
• 
Modification of the MPCC band to align its center with the center of the Bank of 
Mozambique’s target band for inflation, such that a Board consultation is triggered if 
inflation falls outside the ±3 percentage point range around the 5.0 percent mid-point target 
band value for end-June 2023, end-September 2024, and end-December 2024 (Table 9). 
• 
Modification of the floor on social spending from an IT to a PC and a downward 
adjustment in the target level, to ensure a realistic objective in line with institutional and 
implementation capacity. Staff will continue working with other development partners to find 
ways to address implementation challenges.  
• 
To arrest the accumulation of additional domestic arrears and ensure efficient cash 
management, staff propose introducing a quarterly IT on the ceiling of the stock of 
domestic arrears. 
• 
Request for a new test date of end-December 2024 for the SB on the general audit and 
"proof of life" of all public sector servants, to be completed and reported on by the 
Inspector-General of Finances (IGF). 
• 
Two additional SBs on strengthening transparency and governance are aimed at:  
o 
Strengthening monitoring and oversight of the SOE sector with the publication by 
MEF (in the Public Debt Report) data on arrears between (i) each pairs of 11 large 
SOEs (EDM, ENH, CFM, ADM, PETROMOC, TMCEL, EMOSE, BNI, EMODRAGA, LAM 
 
10 See UNU- WIDER (2017). 


REPUBLIC OF MOZAMBIQUE 
INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND 21 
and HCB), and (ii) those SOEs and government, covering the period of 2021-2023 
(end-March 2025 SB).  
o 
Enhancing transparency in the SOEs’ procurement processes ensuring (i) by end-
February 2025, publication by MEF of a Ministerial Diploma requiring IGEPE and each 
SOE (fully- or majority-owned with an ownership share of 50 percent or above) to 
publish on their website (freely accessible) (a) the procurement policies within 15 
days following the IGEPE’s approval, and (b) annual procurement plans within the first 
2 months of each FY; and (ii) by end-December 2024, publication of the procurement 
policies by IGEPE (on its website freely accessible) for 10 SOEs (end-February 2025 
SB).  
49. 
In view of the authorities’ corrective measures, staff supports waivers of non-
observance for the missed QPCs. Staff supports the request for a waiver of non-observance on the 
missed domestic primary balance given the authorities’ actions to ensure fiscal sustainability. In 
addition, staff support the authorities’ request for a waiver of non-observance for missing the target 
on non-accumulation of external arrears given that these were minor and have been settled, and as 
the authorities are taking concrete administrative steps to ensure such arrears are not repeated: 
adopting the migration to a new system (CS-Meridian). 
50. 
Financing assurances. The program remains fully financed, with firm commitments for the 
next 12 months and good prospects for adequate financing for the remainder of the program. 
External financing for the 2024 budget includes about $122 million from the third and fourth ECF 
reviews, $150 million budget support from the World Bank, and $20 million budget support from the 
AfDB (Table 5). 
51. 
Political assurances. The mission met the main opposition parties, and they shared focus on 
key policies under the program. 
52. 
Capacity to repay the Fund remains adequate, but subject to risks (Table 11). Under the 
baseline scenario, outstanding obligations to the Fund based on existing and prospective drawings 
peak in 2024 at 3.6 percent of GDP or about 22.8 percent of gross international reserves. Risks (¶11) 
are mitigated by the authorities’ commitment to reforms, and strong track record of servicing their 
debt obligations to the Fund, policy measures envisaged under the program, and smooth phasing of 
disbursements.  
53. 
Progress in implementing the 2020 safeguards assessment recommendations has been 
slow. The reform to the Organic Law of the BM has not advanced as expected. A new Organic Law 
continues to be revised internally and is now planned for submission to Parliament in 2025. The BM, 
with TA support, plans to finalize the improvement of its operational risk framework, including the 
internal controls over vault access and custody, by end-March 2025. Audited financial statements are 
published in a timely manner on the central bank’s website.

DATA PROVISION AND CAPACITY DEVELOPMENT  
54. 
Although data provision has some shortcomings due to capacity constraints, it is 
broadly adequate for program monitoring and surveillance. Overall quality, timeliness, and 
coverage of macroeconomic statistics are improving, including with support from capacity 
development provided by the Fund and Mozambique’s development partners (Annex IX).  
55. 
CD activities remain closely linked to ECF arrangement-supported reforms. Key TA in 
this regard includes FAD support on public sector wage reform, cash management to support 
quarterly commitment ceilings, and PFM and tax administration, and MCM support to strengthen 
debt management processes, develop an annual borrowing plan, deepen the local currency bond 
market, and implement the MTDS, natural resources wealth management, climate resilience and 
banking operations (Annex III).    
56. 
The authorities are committed to improving the quality and transparency of national 
statistics and have requested TA on Government finance statistics planned in FY25. The current 
focus is to improve the quality, coverage, and frequency of monetary, external, and Government 
finance statistics, and public sector debt statistics. Further progress is needed in data collection and 
dissemination for the SOE sector (Selected Issues Paper). 
STAFF APPRAISAL  
57. 
Economic growth has remained resilient, and inflation has fallen quickly. Growth has 
been supported by a strong mining sector, but the non-mining economy is growing well below 
potential as tight financing conditions and limited government spending constrain activity. With 
non-megaproject current account deficit persisting, Mozambique’s external position in 2023 was 
assessed to be substantially weaker than the level implied by fundamental and desirable policies. 
Recurring climatic shocks are posing an increasing risk, with agricultural production and 
infrastructure affected by both droughts and floods. 
58. 
While program performance on the macroeconomic front has been mixed, progress on 
structural reforms has been satisfactory. The performance criteria (PCs) on net international 
reserves, zero ceiling on non-concessional external debt, and the Monetary Policy Consultation 
Clause were met, while the PCs on both the domestic primary balance and non-accumulation of new 
external arrears were not met. The indicative targets on the domestic debt stock and present value of 
new external debt were met, while the floor on social spending was missed for the third consecutive 
review. The approval of the SWF law in Parliament in December 2023 and implementing regulations 
in February 2024 were important steps toward managing natural resources revenues in a transparent 
and accountable manner. Publication of the Decree-Law on beneficial ownership represents good 
progress in the AML/CFL agenda.11 Continued actions to enhance transparency of the SOE sector are 
important to timely and effectively monitoring of SOEs (Selected Issues Paper). 
 
11 However, the lack of a beneficial owner definition in the Decree-Law may create challenges with the 
implementation of the Decree.

59. 
Continued fiscal consolidation through wage bill rationalization is critical to help 
safeguard fiscal and debt sustainability amid tight financing conditions. The authorities are 
undertaking domestic revenue mobilization measures, including improving the effective taxation of 
mineral products, non-tax measures and tax administration measures to enhance tax compliance. In 
addition, the authorities are keeping expenditure restraint, including on wage bill spending. These 
actions will help reduce debt vulnerabilities and preserve macroeconomic stability. At the same time, 
given the significant reliance on domestic financing, ensuring adherence to fiscal plans (including 
corrective actions, if needed) remains essential to safeguard macroeconomic stability. 
60. 
Strengthening governance and fiscal structural reforms are critical to program success. 
These include improving transparency of the SOE sector, transparency of procurement, 
strengthening risk-based mechanisms to detect corruption and enhancing the efficiency of public 
spending.  In addition, structural conditionality in the area of wage bill control and revenue 
mobilization support the efficient management of public resources to help deliver on the envisaged 
fiscal consolidation under the program. 
61. 
Monetary policy has entered an easing cycle, and further easing remains essential to 
contain the impact of tight policy on growth and financial stability. With real interest rates 
around 12 percent, inflation expectations well anchored, growth below potential, negative credit 
growth, and a continued fiscal consolidation, the Bank of Mozambique has ample space to further 
reduce the policy rate. Lowering the required reserve ratios would also help alleviate the tight 
financing situation.  
62. 
Efforts to support social inclusion, protect the most vulnerable, and build resilience 
against the effects of climate disasters should accelerate. In the context of the social unrest in the 
north and recurring climate shocks, protecting the most affected, including the youth and women, 
should remain a priority. The authorities should make every endeavor to expand the social protection 
spending and coverage, while improving efficiency and addressing implementation challenges of the 
existing social protection programs. Building resilience to climate change through the effective 
implementation of adaptation and mitigation strategies, and accelerating progress to address 
gender-based disparities are also crucial.  
63. 
Staff supports the completion of the fourth review under the ECF arrangement. Staff 
supports the request for a waiver of non-observance for the missed continuous QPC on non-
accumulation of new external arrears due to corrective measures the authorities have taken to 
prevent a repeat breach of this QPC, including a new and consolidated debt database (Meridian) and 
strengthening financial programming for better cash management to facilitate timely payments. Staff 
also supports a waiver of non-observance for the missed QPC on the domestic primary balance 
(December 2023), as staff assess the non-observance of this QPC as temporary and given the 
authorities corrective measures to contain the wage bill. Staff supports the authorities request for 
modifications of the QPC on the floor of the DPB to lock in fiscal effort and the MPCC band to align 
its center with the center of the Bank of Mozambique’s target band for inflation. In addition, staff 
support the setting of a new QPC on a floor on social spending floor to help safeguard social 
spending, and an IT on the stock of domestic arrears to strengthen program monitoring of the 
authorities’ implementation of strategy to reduce arrears. Staff supports the completion of the

financing assurance review on the basis that adequate safeguards remain in place for further use of 
Fund resources and that Mozambique’s adjustment efforts have not been undermined by 
developments in debtor-creditor relations.12 
64. 
It is expected that the next Article IV Consultation with Mozambique will take place on 
the standard 24-month cycle in accordance with Executive Board decision on consultation 
cycles for members with Fund arrangements. 
 
 
12 The financing assurance review is in respect of the arrears to Brazil. Brazil has consented to Fund financing 
notwithstanding these arrears.

…to create fiscal space for development needs. 
 
 
 
The fiscal balance has been improving over the past 
few years, except for wage bill-related slippages in 
2023 
 
Domestic issuance rose sharply in 2022 to meet fiscal 
overruns and remains elevated in 2023 and 2024.  
Debt ratios are stabilizing as the economy recovers…

increased.

Global Risks 
Source of Risks 
Likelihood 
Horizon 
Impact 
Policy Response 
Intensification of regional conflicts. Escalation 
or spread of the conflict in Gaza and Israel, 
Russia’s war in Ukraine, and/or other regional 
conflicts or terrorism disrupt trade (e.g., energy, 
food, tourism, supply chains), remittances, FDI 
and financial flows, payment systems, and 
increase refugee flows. 
High 
 
Medium 
 
Commodity price volatility. A succession of 
supply disruptions (e.g., due to conflicts, 
uncertainty, and export restrictions) and demand 
fluctuations causes recurrent commodity price 
volatility, external and fiscal pressures in EMDEs, 
contagion effects, and social and economic 
instability. 
High 
 
High 
• Well-targeted subsidies for the 
vulnerable. 
Abrupt global slowdown. Global and 
idiosyncratic risk factors combine to cause a 
synchronized sharp growth downturn, with 
recessions in some countries, adverse spillovers 
through trade and financial channels, and market 
fragmentation causing sudden stops in EMDEs.  
Medium 
 
 
Medium 
• Improve the business environment to 
boost private investment. 
Sovereign debt distress. Domino effects from 
high global interest rates, a growth slowdown in 
AEs, unfunded fiscal spending, and/or disorderly 
debt events in some EMDEs spillover to other 
highly indebted countries, amplified by 
sovereign-bank feedback, resulting in capital 
outflows, rising risk premia, and loss of market 
access. 
Medium 
 
 
Medium 
 
• Strengthening cash management and 
commitment controls. 
• Restructuring SOEs in financial distress. 
• Adoption of a reliable medium-term 
fiscal framework. 
Extreme climate events. Extreme climate events 
cause more severe than expected damage to 
infrastructure and loss of human lives and 
livelihoods, amplifying supply chain disruptions 
and inflationary pressures, causing water and 
food shortages, and reducing growth. 
Medium 
 
ST, MT 
 
High 
 
• Address infrastructure gaps. 
• Develop social safety nets. 
• Investment (public and private) in climate 
resilient infrastructure and agriculture. 
• Build institutions to manage climate 
change risk. 
Social discontent. High inflation, real income 
loss, and spillovers from crises in other countries 
(including migration) worsen inequality, trigger 
social unrest, and give rise to financing pressures 
and detrimental populist policies. This 
exacerbates imbalances, slows growth, and 
triggers market repricing. 
Medium 
 
 
 
High 
 
• Well-targeted subsidies for the 
vulnerable. 
 
1 The Risk Assessment Matrix (RAM) shows events that could materially alter the baseline path (the scenario most likely to materialize in 
the view of IMF staff). The relative likelihood is the staff’s subjective assessment of the risks surrounding the baseline (“low” is meant to 
indicate a probability below 10 percent, “medium” a probability between 10 and 30 percent, and “high” a probability between 30 and 50 
percent). The RAM reflects staff views on the source of risks and overall level of concern as of the time of discussions with the authorities. 
Non-mutually exclusive risks may interact and materialize jointly. The conjunctural shocks and scenario highlight risks that may materialize 
over a shorter horizon (between 12 to 18 months) given the current baseline. Structural risks are those that are likely to remain salient over 
a longer horizon.

Likelihood 
Horizon 
Impact 
Policy Response 
Deepening geo-economic fragmentation. 
Broader and deeper conflict(s) and weakened 
international cooperation result in a more rapid 
reconfiguration of trade and FDI, supply 
disruptions, protectionism, technological and 
payments systems fragmentation, rising input 
costs, financial instability, a fracturing of 
international monetary and financial systems, 
and lower potential growth. 
High 
 
 
High 
 
• Strengthen social safety nets. 
• Improve governance, transparency and 
accountability; fight corruption. 
• Anchor macroeconomic stability to 
mobilize private investment, through 
appropriate fiscal and monetary policy and 
structural reforms. 
• Diversify exports products and partners. 
• Improving the business environment to 
boost productivity and competitiveness. 
Monetary policy miscalibration. Amid high 
economic uncertainty and financial sector 
fragility, major central banks pause monetary 
policy tightening or pivot to loosen policy stance 
prematurely, de-anchoring inflation 
expectations, triggering a wage-price spiral and 
spillovers to financial markets. 
Medium 
 
 
Medium 
 
Disorderly energy transition. Disorderly shift to 
net-zero emissions (e.g., owing to shortages in 
critical metals) and climate policy uncertainty 
cause supply disruptions, stranded assets, 
market volatility, and subdued investment and 
growth. 
Medium 
 
High 
 
Domestic Risks 
Deterioration in security situation in 
Mozambique.

• Enhance security and socioeconomic 
policies in northern region. 
• Continue drive for durable peace and 
implementation of reforms. 
Fiscal risks materialize (contingent liabilities 
from SOEs, revenue shortfalls, expenditure 
overruns). 
High 
ST, MT 
High 
• Strengthening cash management and 
commitment controls. 
• Restructuring SOEs in financial distress. 
• Adoption of a reliable medium-term 
fiscal framework. 
Systemic financial instability. Sharp swings in 
real interest rates, risk premia, and assets 
repricing amid economic slowdowns and policy 
shifts trigger insolvencies, causing markets 
dislocations and adverse cross-border spillovers. 
Medium 
 
High 
• Strengthen the resolution and crisis 
management frameworks. 
• Enhance regulation and supervision. 
Cyberthreats. Cyberattacks on physical or digital 
infrastructure (including digital currency and 
crypto assets ecosystems) or misuse of AI 
technologies trigger financial and economic 
instability. 
Medium

• Develop a cyber-resilience strategy. 
Delay in implementation of LNG investments.

10/ Social Spending is defined as transfers to INAS (National Institute for Social Action). IT for the period up to end-March 2024 and QPC starting end-June 2024.
1/ Revenue (excluding LNG revenues starting June 2024 per the TMU, ¶ 4) less grants, minus domestically financed primary expenditure (ie. expenditure, less net interest payments and foreign financed investment). Please note that the end-December 2023 target is adjusted downwards to accommodate the October 2023 debt 
settlement, per TMU (¶5). End-December 2023 domestic primary balance actual figure reported follows the TMU definition (¶4, and excludes only LNG revenue) before triggering the adjustor which is different from the definition followed in Table 2a.

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND 
Annex I. 2022 Article IV Consultation: Key Recommendations 
Recommendation 
Status 
Fiscal 
Implementing growth-friendly fiscal consolidation to 
tackle high debt and financing constraints 
Fiscal consolidation is ongoing, albeit more slowly 
and less growth friendly than expected. Public 
investment domestically financed has been lower 
than expected. 
Strengthening public investment management 
(planning and project selection), including criteria to 
choose climate-resilient infrastructure projects 
 A Ministerial Diploma was introduced to take into 
account climate aspects of public investment.  
Improving MEF oversight of SOEs borrowing, 
including regulating the municipal SOEs 
IGEPE started to publish SOEs’ consolidated accounts 
(related to 2020-2022), while the progress was slow 
on municipal SOEs.  
Ensuring all stages of spending are executed within 
e-SISTAFE to improve control, avoid over-
commitment at the spending units, improve 
predictability and oversight, and reduce scope for 
extra - budgetary arrears 
Quarterly commitment ceilings have been 
operationalized and eliminated weekly commitment 
ceilings which were tied to payment ceilings and 
prevented the spending units to record 
commitments in e-SISTAFE in real time. As a result, 
all spending stages have been integrated within e-
SISTAFE in all spending units. 
Modernizing cash management for a more efficient 
use of government deposits 
New financial programming tools for budgetary 
planning and financial programming are 
implemented in all spending units, and a financial 
programming and cash management committee was 
established in 2023, consisting of staff from Treasury, 
Budget, Accounting, CEDSIF, Tax Authority, Debt 
Management and the BdM. MEF has also been 
undertaking a full mapping of public sector bank 
accounts and is improving cash forecasting with 
support from technical assistance. 
Creating a blocked account to separate T-Bills issued 
for fiscal and monetary policy purposes 
Progress was limited.   
Continuing cash transfers to help those most 
affected by climate shocks 
Government’s overall social spending was 
significantly lower than the committed amounts.  
Monetary 
Revisiting the policy mix, as economy recovers, fiscal 
deficits fall and financing constraints ease 
BdM cut the policy rate three times, by a total of 225 
bps, in the first half of 2024, as the start of a 
loosening cycle, which was triggered by the expected 
impact of the government’s fiscal consolidation 
efforts on inflation, among other developments. 
Ensuring greater exchange rate flexibility, as 
financing pressures decline and inflation targeting 
regime develops 
Progress has been slower than expected. The 
authorities revised the methodology to calculate the 
reference rate, which is a step toward greater 
exchange rate flexibility. 
Accelerating reforms aimed at improving market 
functioning, and BdM’s transparency and 
predictability, including the organic law 
Progress in the corresponding reforms has been 
slow. 
 
 
 


REPUBLIC OF MOZAMBIQUE 
 
INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND 47 
Recommendation 
Status 
Governance 
Undertaking reforms to avoid the FATF gray listing, 
and effective implementation of the AML/CFT laws 
to show commitment to financial integrity 
Despite various efforts, Mozambique was grey-listed 
in October 2022. Progress has been achieved in 
implementing FATF recommendations. 
Reforming the payment systems law 
BdM has been working on reforming the payments 
systems law. 
Continuing the implementation of the 
recommendations from the safeguards assessment 
BdM implemented some of the recommendations, 
including publishing financial statements since 
March 2023. 
Structural 
Ensuring transparency in management of LNG 
revenues with the creation of a transparent, 
accountable and independently managed SWF; and 
adopting a fiscal framework to support SWF and 
manage the revenues efficiently while avoiding high 
volatility in the budget flows 
SWF law was approved in December 2023. 
Regulations and implementing regulations were 
approved in February 2024.    
Improving property registries for public officials, 
strengthening enforcement of asset declaration 
rules, and digitalizing property registries 
Some amendments to the Public Probity law were 
submitted to parliament in November 2023, and 
were approved in May 2024. 


REPUBLIC OF MOZAMBIQUE

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND 
Annex II. External Sector Assessment 
Overall Assessment:  The external position of Mozambique in 2023 is substantially weaker than the level 
implied by fundamentals and desirable policies. The cyclically adjusted non-megaproject current account 
deficit was 19.8 percent of GDP in 2023, vis-à-vis an estimated current account deficit norm of 7.4 percent 
of GDP.1 The EBA-lite current account model indicates an overvaluation of the real effective exchange rate 
of about 38 percent.  
Potential Policy Responses:  More accommodative monetary policy coupled with flexible exchange rates, 
prudent fiscal policy and structural reforms envisaged in the ECF arrangement will be key to support 
domestic production, boost exports, and strengthen Mozambique’s external sector position. While external 
sector statistics are broadly adequate for surveillance, it has some shortcomings, making external sector 
assessment subject to considerable uncertainty, including due to data limitations on megaproject activities, 
and a further enhancement of data quality will be helpful.  
Foreign Assets and Liabilities: Position and Trajectory 
Background. Mozambique has seen persistent negative international investment position (IIP), and the 
IIP stood at -323 percent of GDP at end 2023. 2 Total external liabilities are estimated at 386 percent of 
GDP at end-2023, of which 121 percent of GDP are debt liabilities (loan and debt securities). 
Assessment.  Going forward, the negative IIP is projected to persist in the medium term, due to 
narrower but persistent current account deficits and nominal exchange rate depreciation, which increase 
external debt relative to GDP. Structural reforms to improve competitiveness and prudent fiscal policy 
will be essential to address external imbalances.

Current Account 
Background. Excluding self-financed megaproject 
transactions, the non-megaproject component of current 
account deficit in Mozambique tightened in 2023 to about 
19.3 percent of non-megaproject GDP, from 20.7 percent in 
2022. The non-megaproject current account deficit narrowed 
in 2023 on the back of a broad-based contraction in imports 
reflecting tight financial conditions and the decline in import 
energy prices.  Exports also contracted somewhat, in part due 
to closure of a tobacco factory. Remittance inflows increased 
due to an enhancement in data compilation.

megaproject-related activities do not have a bearing on international reserves. This approach involves additional 
adjustments by deducting estimated megaprojects’ indirect or induced imports within the traditional economy, as these 
data are not available.

Assessment. The external balance assessment (EBA)-Lite Current Account (CA) model suggests that 
Mozambique’s external position in 2023 was substantially weaker than the level implied by fundamentals 
and desirable policies. The cyclically adjusted non-megaproject CA is estimated at -19.8 percent of GDP 
in 2023. The multilaterally consistent cyclically adjusted CA norm is estimated at -7.4 percent of GDP. 
This implies a CA gap of -12.4 percent of GDP in 2023, while the contribution of a policy gap was 3.2 
percent of GDP.

Real Exchange Rate 
Background.  Mozambique’s exchange rate is a soft peg 
against the US dollar. The nominal effective exchange 
rate (NEER) has appreciated in recent years, in line with 
the movement of the U.S. dollar. The real effective 
exchange rate (REER) appreciated by 6.8 percent in 2023, 
and the average value of the REER in 2023 was 17.3 
percent higher than the average value in 2020–22.  
Assessment.  The CA model implied the overvaluation 
of the real effective exchange rate of 38 percent, based 
on the CA-REER elasticity of 0.3. The REER model 
indicates that the real effective exchange rate of 
Mozambique is undervalued by -3.2 percent; however, the REER-model is not suitable for Mozambique 
given large uncertainties, and as it does not control for megaproject-related activities.

Capital and Financial Accounts: Flows and Policy Measures 
Background. In 2023, Mozambique’s non-megaproject financial account inflows are dominated by FDI 
and other investment, including trade credit. The borrowing of government recorded net outflow of  
1.8 percent of GDP, as disbursement of new concessional external credit remained limited. Megaproject-
related FDI inflow stood at 10 percent of GDP in 2023. 
Assessment. With limited fast-moving capital flows, risks of external financing distress in the private 
sector are relatively contained. The government should seek external long-term concessional loans and 
grants to achieve development objectives and balance-of-payments stability. 
FX Intervention and Reserves Level 
Background. After a sharp decline in 2022, gross international reserves recovered to $3,510 million, or 
4.4 months of prospective non-megaproject import, by the end of December 2023. The increase in net 
international reserves was supported by the Bank of Mozambique’s discontinuation of the FX window to 
cover fuel import bill in June 2023. There was no FX intervention in the second half of 2023, while the 
nominal exchange rate against US dollar remained stable. The increase in the required reserve ratio for 
FX deposits from 11.5 percent to  28.5 percent in February and 39.5 percent in June also contributed to 
the accumulation of international reserves.    
Assessment.  The reserve adequacy tool for credit-constrained economies is applied to Mozambique. 
Using the marginal cost of capital as the cost of holding reserves assumed at 4 percent for ECF countries, 
Mozambique’s reserve adequacy level is estimated to be 7.9 months of non-megaproject import 
assuming a peg and 2.6 assuming a flexible exchange rate. While Mozambique’s gross international 
reserves exceed the minimum level commonly recommended for LICs (3 months), higher reserves would 
bolster resilience to external shocks. Increased exchange rate flexibility would help the economy better 
absorb external shocks.

Annex III. Capacity Development Strategy  
1. 
Mozambique is a high intensity IMF TA and CD recipient, with assistance focused 
on governance, PFM, revenue mobilization, management of natural resource wealth, 
monetary and macroprudential policy frameworks, and government, real, and financial 
sector statistics. Fund TA/CD activities respond to specific requests from the authorities and are 
in line with the reform priorities identified in their five-year government plan and long-term 
national Strategy, the Diagnostic Report on Transparency, Governance and Corruption and Fund 
staff advice. Policy advice provided via surveillance and reform targets under the ECF 
arrangement build on macro-critical TA recommendations. There is generally strong ownership 
and commitment for the implementation of TA recommendations resulting in significant 
achievements despite administrative capacity constraints and strategic planning issues.  
CD Priorities  
2. 
The CD strategy focuses on consolidating PFM reforms, modernizing revenue 
administration and improving fiscal stability; debt management; strengthening governance 
and modernizing the central bank; enhancing compilation and disseminations of government, 
finance (Annex IX), and real sector statistics; and preparing public institutions for the efficient and 
transparent management of natural resource revenues and for building climate resilience. While 
substantial progress has been achieved in many areas, low capacity, weak planning, and staff 
turnover are key constraints to absorption and implementation. This may be overcome by 
adopting a sequenced approach and dedicating resources to ensure full understanding of the 
reform proposals, seeking leadership and buy-in from the authorities. The long-term resident TA 
coordinator at the resident representative office and the resident advisors based at the MEF and 
BM, regularly engage at all levels to help the authorities ensure implementation of the 
recommendations. The coordinator also ensures complementarity with TA/CD support provided 
by other partners, maintaining contacts and information flows. 
Authorities’ Views  
3. 
Senior officials from the MEF, the BM, the Revenue Authority, and the Statistical 
Institute were consulted on the CD Strategy. They expressed satisfaction with the CD provided 
by the IMF both through the Fund resident advisors and TA coordinator in the field as well as 
with the peripatetic visits from HQ, the regional TA center (AFRITAC South), short-term experts 
engaged in missions, and on-line CD and training. Interlocutors reported that IMF staff and 
experts effectively support integration of their advice into the MEF and BM’s operations and are 
considered trusted advisors. They concur with the CD priorities listed above. TA to prepare the 
macro-fiscal framework for large natural resource revenues and climate shocks and to 
consolidate the wage-bill spending over the medium term are priorities. Work to enhance 
planning/forecasting and budget execution controls, manage fiscal risks, improve fiscal data 
consistency and reporting, broaden the revenue base, and modernize the revenue administration

Annex IV. Were Spending Overruns in 2022 Consistent with 
Budget Rules?1  
The implementation of the single salary scale reform in 2022 led to wage bill spending that was 26 
percent higher than envisaged in the 2022 budget. Moreover, domestic spending overall was much 
higher than the budget due to slippages in other categories, and the composition of government 
spending deviated substantially from the initial budget. This annex explains how that was possible and 
makes recommendations to strengthen the budget process to reinforce fiscal discipline, protect 
spending priorities, and make the budget more credible. 
1. 
There was a large gap between the budget and the fiscal outturn in 2022. The most 
significant deviations were the following: 
• 
Revenues and grants were 4.0 percentage points of GDP lower 
• 
Total expenditure and net lending was 0.8 percentage points of GDP lower 
• 
The fiscal balance was 3.3 percentage points of GDP lower  
• 
Wage bill spending was 3.4 percentage points of GDP higher  
• 
Interest payments were 0.8 percentage point of GDP lower  
• 
Current expenditure was 2.6 percentage points of GDP higher  
• 
Capital expenditure (externally financed) was 3.5 percentage points of GDP lower  
2. 
The government was able to meet the legally binding budget ceiling on total cash 
outflows by a wide margin despite sizable overruns in domestically financed spending. Total 
cash outflows amounted to MT450bn and comprised total expenditure and net lending (MT404bn) 
and the amortization of public debt (MT46bn). A significant shortfall in externally financed capital 
expenditure (by 50 percent, or about 3.2 percentage points of GDP) helped offset a 3.4 percentage 
points of GDP overrun in the wage bill when considering the total budget ceiling. Domestic primary 
expenditure, which is much more under the control of the government than externally financed 
expenditure2, was 3.8 percentage points of GDP higher than in the budget (Table IV.1). 
3. 
The budget law also sets a legally binding ceiling on total current spending, which was 
exceeded by 2.6 percentage points of GDP. While total current spending executed (MT315bn) was 
11 percent higher than planned (MT285bn), the government did not request parliamentary 
authorization for this overrun through a supplementary budget, as required in SISTAFE law. 
 
1 Prepared by Vanda Castelo Chiconela (IMF, Resident Representative Office-Maputo). I thank Pablo Lopez Murphy for 
helpful suggestions and discussions and Esther Palacio for useful discussions and comments. 
2 The externally financed expenditure is driven by disbursements from development partners, particularly on capital 
projects. The under execution of the externally financed expenditures does not channel additional funding to 
domestic primary expenditures. 


REPUBLIC OF MOZAMBIQUE 
54 
INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND 
Authorities interpreted that wage bill spending commitments are unavoidable, as these cover the 
salaries of government workers, which must be paid as a matter of principle, and therefore 
concluded that parliamentary approval was not needed. However, the SISTAFE law does not contain 
such exception for increasing current spending, as it only allows spending increases either by 
parliamentary approval or through the use of the special provisional fund in justified circumstances 
(Articles 22 and 25). The assumption of financial obligations by the state under different legal 
frameworks, such as labor laws (i.e., paying salaries to employees hired by the state), should be 
consistent with the laws that regulate how the state makes payments through budget expenditures 
(i.e., the budget laws).  
4. 
The budget law should set spending ceilings that strengthen fiscal discipline and 
enhance the relevance of the budget as the government’s main policy instrument. A fiscal 
environment in which domestic primary expenditure and net lending can be 16 percent higher 
without legislative authorization does not promote fiscal discipline or government accountability. 
The budget law should set a legally binding ceiling on domestic primary spending to support more 
fiscal discipline and make clear that the ceiling on current spending and other economic 
classification aggregates are also binding. If the ceiling needs to be exceeded, then that should 
require legislative authorization.

Annex V. Strategy for Poverty Reduction and Growth and Social 
Protection in Mozambique1 
This annex summarizes the Mozambique’s 2025–2044 National Development Strategy (ENDE), which 
aims to. The ECF arrangement and the PRGS are aligned on the need for enhancing revenue 
mobilization to create fiscal space for development needs, as well as improving institutional 
frameworks. ENDE, which was presented to Parliament in June 2024, meets the Poverty Reduction and 
Growth Strategy (PRGS) minimum requirements, and has been assessed positively by the World Bank. 
This annex also reviews the recent developments in social protection in Mozambique, and discusses 
opportunities and challenges.  
A. Mozambique’s National Development Strategy 2025–2044 
1. 
ENDE lays out goals for economic, social and institutional development that are 
aligned with the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) over the next twenty years. ENDE aims 
to strengthen governance and transparency, promote inclusive and sustainable growth, mitigate 
poverty and inequalities, foster economic diversification and human capital, increase productivity and 
competitiveness, improve coverage and quality of infrastructure and public services, and promote 
environmental sustainability. It sets various targets for 2044, such as reducing the poverty rate from 
68 to 28 percent, increasing access to clean water from 54 to 70 percent, and decreasing the illiteracy 
rate from 38 to 19 percent of population (Text Table AV.1). To support these objectives, the 
percentage of the government aims to expand the households covered by basic social protection 
programs gradually.

2. 
ENDE establishes a development plan focusing on agriculture, energy, tourism, mining 
and industry, accompanied by progress in human capital, infrastructure, governance and 
environmental resilience. The plan advocates the transformation of the economy by promoting 
productivity, diversification and competitiveness in these sectors. Modernizing agricultural 
production, focusing on strategic crops, and integrating the small-scale farmers into global value 
chains stand out as important. Relying more on renewable energy (e.g., hydro, or solar) will help 
reduce energy costs (and cost of production in other sectors) and increase the availability of reliable

energy.2 Infrastructure investments in tourism destinations will unleash the sector’s potential. In 
mining, increasing capacity to process raw materials is a priority. Industry will also play a role, 
including the improvements in food production (for food security), and construction industry (for 
infrastructure efforts). The sector-oriented objectives will go hand in hand with the efforts to boost 
human capital (improving accessibility and quality of education and health services), expand 
infrastructure (building roads/railways to facilitate the flow of goods and services), improve 
governance (reforming institutional and legal frameworks to bolster private sector development) and 
environmental resilience (integrating climate-sensitive decision making into each step). 
3. 
The government followed a transparent and participatory process in the preparation of 
ENDE. The review process, coordinated by the Ministry of Economy and Finance (MEF), was initiated 
in September 2021. The government received feedback and suggestions from various stakeholders, 
e.g., the private sector, civil society organizations (CSOs), development partners, academia and the 
youth, through consultations at national, provincial and district levels. Following the publication of 
a draft strategy in November 2022, the government engaged in further consultations with CSOs and 
international partners, and also encouraged the public to provide feedback via email or an e-form.  
4. 
Both revenue and expenditure sides of public finances will create the space for the 
priority spending needed for the implementation of ENDE. To mobilize domestic resources, the 
government will explore options to facilitate tax collection and enforcement, and undertake reforms 
to boost tax revenues efficiently. Oil and gas revenues will also be utilized. Moreover, the 
government will consider funding from international partners for specific projects. On the 
expenditures side, the government will accelerate reforms to improve efficiency of public spending 
and enhance monitoring and evaluation, as well as expanding education, health and social 
protection spending.  
5. 
The goals and strategies presented in ENDE are aligned with that of ECF the 
arrangement. Both the ECF arrangement and ENDE focus on revenue mobilization and spending 
efficiency, aimed at creating space to allocate resources for the development needs. ENDE’s 
objectives regarding improving institutional frameworks and governance are also important 
elements in the ECF arrangement. Moreover, ENDE sets social spending targets, including expanding 
social protection programs (e.g., cash transfers) to fight against income and food insecurity, which is 
also aligned with the ECF arrangement. 
B. Expanding Social Protection in Mozambique: Challenges and 
Opportunities 
6. 
Mozambique made progress over the past decade in strengthening its non-
contributory social protection system, enhancing resilience, income security, and consumption 
of vulnerable individuals in line with ENSSB II.3 The number of beneficiaries covered by social 
protection programs gradually rose from 0.5 to about 0.6 million from 2016 to 2020. In 2021, about 
 
2 In this context, the energy transition strategy (Estratégia de Transição Energética Justa) that was approved by the 
Council of Ministers in 2023 has been an important step forward.

REPUBLIC OF MOZAMBIQUE

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND 
1.7 million beneficiaries were reached, with nearly 1.2 million people receiving short-term support in 
response to the COVID-19 pandemic.4 However, the number of people covered by social protection 
programs implemented by INAS in 2022 remained about 0.6 million.5 
7. 
Against the backdrop of escalating poverty rates and cost of living following the 
pandemic, the government has been seeking to broaden social protection coverage. This 
included integrating eligible individuals who were previously covered by short-term programs during 
the pandemic into regular ones, notably via PSSB.6 This is underscored by the ambitious coverage 
targets, aimed at to cover around 1 million beneficiaries in both 2023 and 2024, with nearly 
0.8 million under PSSB (with almost 70 percent increase from 2022).  
8. 
Increasing social protection coverage and spending can have significant impact on 
poverty and inequality. Results from microsimulations indicate that extending coverage of PSSB to 
all eligible beneficiaries and increasing the amount of cash transfers based on the INAS’s proposal 
can lead to a 2.4 percentage points (of population) decline in poverty and a 1.8 percent decline in 
income inequality (proxied by Gini index). Consumption levels are estimated to increase, particularly 
for the poor (with an 8 percent increase in the lowest income quintile) (Figure 1, scenario 4).7   
9. 
Despite efforts to strengthen social protection, challenges persist due to limited fiscal 
space. In 2023-24, disbursements for social protection had significant delays due to liquidity 
constraints, resulting in limited spending execution and posing operational hurdles for INAS (e.g., 
preventing regular payments to beneficiaries, compromising their income security). Prioritizing social 
protection and ensuring regular disbursements to INAS, as well as exploring options for digitalization 
via mobile money transfers, are key to strengthen the effectiveness of the safety net. 
10. 
Social protection spending adequacy remains as a challenge as well, with benefit levels 
being stagnant since 2018, and a mismatch has been observed between benefit levels and 
household sizes. Annual adjustments are essential to safeguard purchasing power amidst rising cost 
of living, aimed at upholding income security of beneficiaries and effectiveness of social protection 
efforts. In addition, the majority of PSSB beneficiaries receive the lowest benefit level (MZN 540, or 
USD 8.50), which is intended for single-person households, even though most beneficiaries live in 
 
4 Direct Social Support Programme Post-Emergency (PASD-PE) COVID-19. 
5 Based on ILO World Social Protection Database, the overall social protection coverage was 6 percent of population 
in 2022, as per the SDG indicator 1.3.1. This includes beneficiaries and insured workers of contributory social 
protection (social insurance) provided by the National Social Security Institute (INSS) and the National Social 
Providence Institute (INPS), as well as beneficiaries of non-contributory social protection programs of INAS. 
6 The Basic Social Subsidy Program (PSSB) consists of regular monthly cash transfers (paid indefinitely) to eligible 
individuals living below the poverty line, such as old-age persons, persons with disabilities, individuals with chronic 
and degenerative diseases, households with children aged 0-2 years, households with orphaned children, or 
households headed by orphaned children from 14 to 18 years old. 
7 The benefit levels of the PSSB vary based on the household size. Since 2018, it disburses MZN 540 (USD 8.5) for 
single-person households, MZN 640 (USD 10) for 2-person households, MZN 740 (USD 11.6) for 3-person 
households, MZN 840 (USD 13.2) for 4-person households, and MZN 1,000 (USD 15.7) for households with 5 or more 
members. The study explores scenarios for expanding coverage and increasing benefit levels (based on INAS’s 
proposal to Treasury) as follows: MZN 650 (USD 10.2) for single-person households, MZN 780 (USD 12.2) for 2-person 
households, MZN 940 (USD 14.7) for 3-person households, MZN 1,150 (USD 18) for 4-person households, and MZN 
1,350 (USD 21.13) for households with 5 or more individuals. 


REPUBLIC OF MOZAMBIQUE 
 
INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND 59 
households composed 2 or more individuals, which calls for a reassessment of the levels.8 Adequacy 
levels of PSSB are about one third or less as share of household consumption for the households at 
different welfare quintiles, as of 2022 (Figure 2).   
11. 
Mitigating the efficiency in targeting and coverage of PSSB can unleash its potential in 
reducing poverty. The targeting and coverage indicators of PSSB remain relatively uniform across 
households with different welfare levels, except the richest. Households across the first four quintiles, 
receive between 20 and 24 percent of the total benefit. Similarly, coverage stays at 12 and 9 percent 
at the first and fourth quintiles (Figure 2).  
12. 
There is also room for improvement in governance and administration of social 
protection programs to address implementation challenges. The limited number and constrained 
capacity of INAS delegations pose challenges to the expansion of coverage and lead to inefficiencies 
in processes, such as beneficiary identification, verification, enrollment, and payments. A robust plan 
for gradual expansion of INAS’ capacities which can be enabled by increased funding is needed to 
achieve the targets and respond to growing needs, including to new shocks. 
13. 
The government should create fiscal space for much-needed social protection to 
progressively achieve the coverage targets in line with relevant frameworks, including ENSSB, 
ENDE and PQG9. The government should explore options to maintain financial sustainability of the 
social protection systems, including considering tapping into LNG revenues. In 2023-24, the budget 
allocated only about MZN 7 billion (0.5 percent of GDP) for social spending (while the actual amount 
remained lower), falling short of the targeted 2.2 percent in ENSSB for 2024, and lagging the average 
social protection spending in Sub-Saharan Africa (which is around 2.2 percent10).

Annex VI. Managing the Sovereign-Bank Nexus in Mozambique1  
With banks’ significant exposure to the public sector, the sovereign-bank nexus remains relatively 
elevated, posing risks to macroeconomic and financial stability. To reduce sovereign-bank nexus and 
create space for banks’ private credit, the government should seek higher access to concessional 
external financing and diversifying investor base, while maintaining fiscal discipline. 
 
1. 
While the financial system 
remains stable, the sovereign-bank 
nexus in Mozambique has been 
relatively high. Constrained by limited 
external financing and a narrow domestic 
investor base, the sovereign-bank nexus in 
Mozambique has been relatively elevated 
compared to other Low-Income Countries, 
and banks have financed a significant 
proportion of fiscal deficits, with the bank’s 
share of total outstanding of government 
securities reaching about 70 percent by 
2022, in addition to some public loans.  
Following the hidden debt scandal in 2016, 
banks’ exposure to the public sector 
increased, while external financing has 
been shrinking. Banks’ exposure to public 
sector and SOE, including debt securities 
and loans, stood at 92 percent of claims on 
private sector at end-June 2023, among 
the highest in peer countries. Credit-to-
GDP stood at only 17 percent in 2023, 
lower than Sub-Saharan peers, with credit-
to-GDP gap remaining at -9 percent.2 High 
lending by banks to the public sector 
hinders private sector credit. While the 
financial system remains stable with capital 
levels remaining adequate and asset 
quality improving recently, the potential for 
a vicious cycle of sovereign and bank 
distress would pose risks to macro-
financial stability.

2. 
A decline in banks’ exposure to the public sector would create space for private credit 
expansion and promote macro-financial stability. Prudent fiscal policy anchored by the ECF 
arrangement ‘s targets, and a higher share of external concessional loans as envisaged in the 
Medium-term Debt Strategy would weaken the sovereign-bank nexus by reducing the amount of 
bank financing required by the government. A reduction in the reserve requirement ratio would also 
open space to expand credit to private sector. In addition, the authorities should also deepen the 
financial system and capital markets with an improved debt management strategy, thereby 
diversifying the investor base for public sector debt toward non-banks. In this regard, a diversified 
maturity structure of government securities could attract a broader set of investors. Financial 
inclusion and increased access to bank accounts would help banks’ sustained funding and create 
space for private credit.

Annex VII. Wage Bill Rationalization1  
Wage bill rationalization remains a central part of the authorities’ fiscal consolidation effort under the 
ongoing ECF arrangement. The authorities’ action plan provides a medium-term strategy supported by 
measures to ensure that public services are delivered in a cost-effective and fiscally sustainable manner. 
The goal is to reduce the public wage bill to 10 percent of GDP by 2028, to help create fiscal space for 
priority spending and boost Mozambique’s labor competitiveness compared to regional peers. 
1.   
Wage bill spending in Mozambique is a risk to fiscal sustainability and is crowding out 
other spending that is critical for an effective delivery of public services. Wage bill spending 
increased steadily from 10.6 percent of GDP in 2017 to 13.2 percent of GDP in 2021. Following the 
implementation of a Single Salary Scale (TSU), a complex reform that faced considerable 
implementation challenges, it reached 16.4 percent of GDP in 2022, accounting for about 50 percent 
of the total government expenditure and 80 percent of tax revenues (Figure 1, top left). Increases in 
the average wage accounted for 81 percent of the increase in the wage bill during 2016-22, while 
increases in employment explained the remaining 19 percent (Figure 1, top right). The wage bill in 
Mozambique is well above comparator countries and regional peers (Figure 1, middle left).  
2.  
A rationalization of wage bill spending is ongoing and should continue in line with the 
ENDE. The authorities adopted important measures in 2023, including cutting public sector salaries 
by 20 percent (excluding the lowest four of the 21 salary scales), reducing the 13th-month wage, and 
amending the wage bill law to reduce the salary and subsidies for statutory appointed and elected 
public office holders by 5 and 10 percentage points, respectively. The authorities also implemented 
structural measures, including incorporating all public sector servants into the electronic payroll 
system, and adopting an action plan to reach a wage bill-to-GDP ratio of 10 percent by 2028.2 The 
audit and "proof of life" of all public sector servants are being performed, and will be completed by 
end-December 2024 (structural benchmark for June 2024) should also generate savings.   
3.  
Tighter budget regulations are needed to raise awareness of wage bill spending 
challenges and support more fiscal discipline. Actual wage bill spending has been significantly 
higher than wage bill spending limits approved by the Parliament. For example, wage bill spending in 
2022 was 16.4 percent of GDP compared to 13 percent of GDP in the original 2022 budget. Similarly, 
wage bill spending 2023 was 14.7 percent of GDP compared to 13 percent of GDP in the 2023 
budget. These wage bill spending overruns happened without the adoption of a supplementary 
budget approved by Parliament. These episodes undermine the relevance of the budget as the 
government’s main policy instrument. 
4.  
Wage bill spending projections are driven by assumptions on policy levers including 
the base salary, supplements, extra hours, 13th salary, promotions, and hiring.

Baseline overshoots the wage-bill-to-GDP target of 10 percent, and reaches 11.5 percent by 2028. 
This is underpinned by: (i) nominal freeze to base salary in 2024-25 followed by full an increase in 
salaries in line with previous year’s inflation (2026-29); (ii) nominal freeze to supplement in 2024 
followed by 30 percent increase in line with previous year’s inflation (2025-29); (iii) capping new hires 
to MT2.5bn  over the medium-term; (iv) capping 13th month to one-third of the base salary in 2024 
followed by a limit of 50 percent of base salary 2025-2829; (v) limiting extra hours to MT2.4 bn in 
2024 and over the medium-term; (vi) savings related to the attrition rule equivalent to 0.04 ppt of 
GDP in 2024 equivalent to about MT0.6 bn; and (vii) promotion freeze consistent with the wage bill 
action plan endorsed by the Minister of Finance; savings equivalent to 0.2 ppt of GDP to MT3.3 bn, 
on average, per year (2024–26).  
Scenario 1 achieves a wage bill-to-GDP ratio of 10.4 percent by 2028 (compared to the baseline at 
11.5 ppt of GDP. In additions to measures under the baseline, Scenario 1 assumes the following: (i) a 
nominal freeze to base salary in 2024-25 followed by a gradual increase in salaries, compared to the 
baseline, in line with 50 percent increase in line with previous year’s inflation (2026-29); (ii) hiring 
freeze in 2024, while allowing for 2024Q1 hires of MT0.6 bn, and capping new hires to MT2.5 over 
the medium-term; (iii) capping extra hours to zero in 2024 and going forward. 
Scenario 2 achieves a wage bill-to-GDP ratio of 10 percent by 2028 (compared to baseline at 11.5 
ppt of GDP) through the following additional measures to scenario 1: (i) an even slower adjustment 
in nominal salary to inflation through a nominal freeze to base salary in 2024-25 followed by a 
gradual increase in salaries in line with 30 percent increase in line with previous year’s inflation 
(2026-29); and (ii) nominal freeze to supplement over the medium-term.

Annex VIII. Addressing Mozambique’s Macro-Critical Corruption 
Risks1  
1. 
While there has been progress in improving the governance framework in recent years, 
corruption vulnerabilities remain a significant impediment to sustained and inclusive growth. 
Mozambique is assessed as weaker than peer countries on government effectiveness, control of 
corruption, and rule of law.2 Perceptions of corruption have not improved since 2017,3 absence of 
corruption indicators show downward trends since 2020,4 and large-scale impunity is perceived as 
endemic.5 Firms cite corruption as one of the top three obstacles to their operations.6 Moreover, 
corruption and patronage networks are generally seen as systemic and often linked to political 
affiliation.7 Procurement, the extractive sector, transport, and SOEs are also viewed as entailing 
high corruption risks.  
2. 
Implementation of anti-corruption reforms should be strengthened to achieve better 
outcomes. Limited institutional and technical capacities, and limited coordination and resources are 
holding back implementation efforts. In addition, the low operational and financial autonomy of key 
agencies undermines their capacity to fulfill their mandates, and exposes them to potential political 
influence. The absence of a centralized, strong, and visible entity to lead and champion anti-
corruption reforms, policies, and measures—including for operationalizing the anti-corruption 
strategy—hinders overall progress.  
3. 
The 2018 decentralization process has increased corruption risks, including in public 
procurement and fragmented the application of relevant anti-corruption tools. As a result of 
the constitutional reform, thousands of new procurement units and budget implementation agencies 
were created, overwhelming already overstretched control, audit and accountability mechanisms. The 
administration and implementation of the asset declarations system is also decentralized,8 thereby 
fragmenting verification and enforcement efforts and reducing their efficacy. 
4. 
Mozambique would benefit from implementing the outstanding governance and anti-
corruption reforms identified in the 2019 Diagnostic Report on Transparency, Governance and 
Corruption9, with a focus on tackling high-level corruption risks. The Diagnostic Report,

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND 67 
prepared with IMF support, contains recommendations for strengthening the country’s anti-
corruption legal and organizational frameworks. While several actions have already been 
implemented or partially adopted, important pending actions include revamping the asset 
declarations and conflicts of interest laws10 to bring them in line with international standards and 
best practices, and stronger transparency in public procurement. 
5. 
Transparency efforts across government should continue to be prioritized. Fiscal 
transparency has significantly improved in the last decade, with the MEF website11 displaying 
numerous reports and data following best practices. The government is publishing mining and 
hydrocarbons contracts, finalizing collection of beneficial ownership information and considering 
options for publishing this information. IGEPE (the state’s ownership agency) issued the first 
consolidated report on SOEs in 2023, with data covering FY 2020. Data on the use of competitive and 
non-competitive public procurement methods was recently published on the Procurement 
Authority’s (UFSA) website and an upcoming reform will require the collection and publication of 
beneficial ownership information of winning bidders. However, the publication of institutional/annual 
reports by government agencies is generally subject to significant delays; in addition, public 
procurement disclosures, including by SOEs, need to be strengthened. Mozambique would also 
benefit from enhanced transparency on asset declarations of high-level officials. 
6. 
Long delays in publishing audits and recommendations by the Tribunal Administrativo 
undermine public sector transparency. Since 2014, Mozambique’s Access to Information Law 
mandates the publication of audit reports.12 However, the authorities’ practice has been to publish 
full audits only after the conclusion of the jurisdictional phase of its accountability procedures, which 
normally occurs 7-10 years after the audited fiscal year; this reduces the information value of the 
recommendations and findings and is not in line with international standards and best practice.13 In 
the near term, the authorities should also work toward the transformation of the Tribunal 
Administrativo’s Third Section into a Court of Accounts, similar to those that exist in other countries 
with similar legal systems, such as Angola, Brazil, Cape Verde, and Portugal. 
7. 
In the context of weak transparency and accountability, the size and relevance of the 
SOE sector in Mozambique generate important corruption risks. Mozambique’s legal framework 
grants SOEs broad discretion to undertake direct (non-competitive) procurement processes. While 
SOEs are required to use competitive procurement processes as a rule, they are also authorized to 
use “exceptional” processes in situations of force majeur or “when it is not possible to conduct an 
open tender”, without providing any objective criteria (such as cases of emergency) or safeguards, 
and without requiring special approvals or disclosure. SOEs need only inform the Shareholders 
Meeting. Information on the value of SOE procurement conducted through non-competitive 
mechanisms is not publicly available; moreover, the legal framework does not seem to grant MEF, 
 
10 News reports (May 2024) mentioned that these amendments were approved by Parliament, but they have not yet 
been published in the official gazette and staff had no access to a final or approved version at the time of writing this 
annex.

UFSA and IGEPE sufficient powers to collect information on and monitor SOE procurement. SOEs are 
required to develop their own procurement policies and annual procurement plans, but neither are 
publicly disclosed. Going forward, the commitment by MEF to publish a Ministerial Diploma 
requiring all SOEs and IGEPE to publish the SOEs’ procurement policies and annual procurement 
plans on their websites is an important first step to address corruption risks in the sector.  
8. 
Anti-corruption efforts should be more focused on risks of high-level and systemic 
corruption, including through risk-based mechanisms and enhanced coordination. For example, 
the Tribunal Administrativo (the supreme audit institution) audits are risk-based, but monitoring and 
auditing by the procurement authority (UFSA)14 and other audit bodies are not supported by risk 
analyses, hindering the detection of corruption risks in more vulnerable sectors. The asset 
declarations law requires all public officials (more than 250,000) to file asset declarations, with 
unclear verification criteria and without considering political exposure. High-level and systemic 
corruption should also be a priority for anti-corruption enforcement agencies. 
 
 
14 A comprehensive database, currently covering almost 70 percent of procurement entities, captures a wealth of 
information. However, UFSA currently does not use it to identify procuring entities with higher risks in order to plan 
for targeted actions.

Changes since the last Article IV consultation. Mozambique started to compile and publish SOEs' consolidated accounts. Benefiting from IMF TA (Fiscal 
Affairs Department) on wage-bill reform, data on wage-bill improved regarding higher granularity and became available more timely. Government has prepared 
but has not published the first annual borrowing plans in 2024. Government increased the coverage of inflation from 3 to 8 cities. Mozambique has recently 
received TA from IMF Statistics Department to fix issues in the external sector statistics. This has helped to fix much of the inconsistencies, especially in FDI data. 
Areas of progress and possible future needs for TA are summarized below. 
Corrective actions and capacity development priorities. Mozambique recently received TA from IMF Statistics Department to fix issues in the external sector 
statistics, which will be helpful to bridge data gaps going forward. The have requested TA on Government finance statistics. In 2019, Mozambique launched the 
National Summary Data Page (NSDP) to disseminate data as a participant of e-GDDS. The priority is to further improve the quality, coverage, and frequency of 
monetary, external, and Government finance statistics, and public sector debt statistics, including strengthening compilation and dissemination of fiscal data by 
aligning with the latest GFS Framework-Government Operation Statement; implementing regular reconciliation of net credit to the government and public debt 
statistics; and expanding the coverage to consolidated General Government; and ensure that national accounts and price statistics are compiled and disseminated 
using appropriate statistical techniques by reviewing improved quarterly national accounts compilation and improving the linked CPI series, respectively.
The data provided to the Fund has some shortcomings that somewhat hamper surveillance.
The data provided to the Fund has serious shortcomings that significantly hamper surveillance.
Rationale for staff assessment. In real sector, the coverage is adequate for surveillance. However, while annual data on GDP has a breakdown of supply and 
demand subcomponents in both nominal and real terms, quarterly data has only the supply side breakdown and only in real terms. Having the demand side 
components of GDP (including consumption and investment) at quarterly frequency and in nominal terms will improve the quality of staff projections. In prices, 
coverage of inflation is restricted to several cities which is noted as a drawback. In the monetary and financial sectors, more granularity of government debt 
holdings, as well as improvements in the data on non-banking sector, will be useful for surveillance. In the external sector statistics, the ad hoc adjustment of 
errors and omissions should be discontinued, and issues regarding inconsistencies identified by the IMF Statistics Department should be addressed. Moreover, 
some of the classifications of subcomponents on the external sector statistics and the government sector data are not fully in line with BPM6 recommendations, as 
well as with government finance statistics  are still not consistent with the BPM6 methodology. In public finances, more granularity in both the revenue and 
expenditure sides will help staff assess the fiscal sector better. The recording of some SOE-related expenditures, including quasi-fiscal operations, and consistency 
of stock and flows also need improvements. Intersectoral consistency is negatively affected by (i) discrepancy in government borrowing arising from different 
recoding of T-Bills by the BdM and MEF, and (ii) recording of SOE operations and obligations by MEF.

REPUBLIC OF MOZAMBIQUE 
 
INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND 71 
Appendix I. Letter of Intent 
June 21, 2024 
 
Ms Kristalina Georgieva 
Managing Director 
International Monetary Fund 
Washington, DC 20431 
United States of America 
 
Dear Ms Georgieva, 
 
The Republic of Mozambique remains committed to the reform program supported by the Extended 
Credit Facility (ECF) arrangement with the IMF. Despite a challenging international environment, we 
have made progress on our commitments. The attached Memorandum of Economic and Financial 
Policies (MEFP) updates the previous memorandum and describes progress and further policy steps 
to meet our objectives. 
 
In the period to December 2023, we have met two quantitative performance criteria (the floor on net 
international reserves (NIR), and ceiling on new non-concessional external debt). We also met two 
indicative targets (ceilings on the present value of new external debt, and domestic debt stock). On 
structural reforms, we met three out of four structural benchmarks (SB) under the ECF arrangement. 
We have published a Decree Law requiring the collection of beneficial ownership information for all 
entities (end-March 2024 SB); published the financial risks indicators of SOEs (end-June 2024 SB); and 
operationalized a tool for monthly cash flow projections (end-June 2024 SB). Despite progress, we 
were not able to meet the SB on the completion of proof of life and general audit for all public 
servants (end-June 2024 SB) within the test date due to some operational bottlenecks, but are 
committed to complete this exercise by end-December 2024 (proposed new test date). We are 
requesting a waiver of non-observance for the missed continuous QPC on non-accumulation of new 
external arrears (January and February,2024) on the ground that these arrears were solved. 
Furthermore, we continue to consolidate debt database and strengthen financial programming for 
better cash management to facilitate timely payments and avoid future arrears. We are also 
requesting a waiver of non-observance for the missed QPC on the domestic primary balance 
(December 2023) and commit to undertake corrective measures to ensure fiscal sustainability 
(outlined below). In addition, we will adhere to a new QPC on a floor on social spending to help 
safeguard social protection, and an IT on the stock of domestic arrears to reflect the authorities’ 
implementation of a strategy to reduce domestic arrears going forward.   
 
We embarked on a wage reform which aimed at simplifying public employment compensation and 
managing the cost of public sector employment with the aim of aligning the wage bill to around 
10 percent of GDP over the medium term. Initial reforms passed by the National Assembly in 2021 
were aimed at improving controls and predictability over wage bill spending. During the 
implementation phase, we encountered higher costs than estimated for the wage bill reform 
resulting in 2022 primary deficit after grants of 2.8 percent of GDP compared to a projection of 0.2 
percent of GDP. We are committed to adopt credible corrective measures to ensure fiscal discipline 
and achieve the medium-term fiscal consolidation envisaged under the program. In 2023, we have a 
achieved a fiscal correction which reduced the domestic primary deficit to -0.1 percent of GDP. We 


REPUBLIC OF MOZAMBIQUE 
72 
INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND 
endorsed a medium-term wage bill action plan to help reduce the wage bill to 10 percent of GDP 
over the medium-term. The plan includes policy measures (hiring limits, freeze in nominal wages and 
promotions, allocating one-third of the 13th month in 2024 and half of the 13th month over 2025-28) 
and public financial management reforms, including completion of the ongoing general audit and 
“proof of life” of all public sector servants by end-December 2024 to eliminate ghost workers in the 
HR database and payroll. In addition, as explained in the MEFP, we are considering wage bill 
reducing measures including eliminating some allowances, containing some supplements, and 
corrective measures to address the findings of the ongoing audit of public servants. 
 
We are advancing with the core fiscal reforms needed to foster growth and achieve our debt 
reduction objectives. With respect to VAT reforms, we are fully implementing the elimination of 
exemptions and zero-ratings identified by end-2023. Our domestic revenue mobilization effort 
includes broadening the VAT base; additional tax on rental income from personal property; aligning 
the reference price of the extractive industry to international prices in line with best practice, 
supported by tax administration measures. Non-tax policy measures include increasing the 
concession rate on profit making SOEs. In addition, the April 2023 decision on the resumption of the 
automatic fuel price mechanism for diesel and gasoline prices helped in reducing market frictions 
and fiscal liability.  
 
We finalized the National Development Plan 2025-2044 (ENDE) which was submitted to Parliament in 
June 2024. We are requesting the completion of the financing assurance review in respect of the 
arears owed to Brazil. We incurred external arrears in January 2024 (with India and Korea, and Nordes 
Bank), and in February 2024 (with the Arab Bank for Economic Development in Africa). These external 
arrears have all been settled. We are taking concrete administrative steps to ensure such arrears are 
not repeated. We are strongly committed to reforms, meeting program objectives and effort to 
strengthen debt management by publishing quarterly and annual debt reports which cover stocks, 
on-lending, and state guarantees, including SOEs. To enhance debt recording and reporting, the 
transition to a new database (Meridian) for public debt management with a goal of improving the 
coverage of it gradually.  
 
We are making progress on our structural agenda. We are working to address Mozambique’s recent 
grey listing by implementing the action plan adopted by the Financial Action Task Force (FATF) 
Plenary. Following the publication of the Decree Law in the Official Gazette ensuring collection of 
adequate, accurate and up-to-date beneficial ownership information of legal persons in the 
Centralized Registry Legal Entities (CREL) in line with FATF Recommendation 24 (by end-March 2024), 
we are committed to facilitate the process of collection and use of this information in line with the 
FATF recommendation. We will also publish quarterly adequate, accurate and up-to-date information 
(on a freely accessible website) on the beneficial owners of the entities awarded general government 
procurement contracts above MT60 million, except defense and security-related contracts (as 
referenced in the MEFP of the Third Review, ¶7) by end-September 2024. We will continue improving 
transparency of the SOE sector, by enhancing the availability and accessibility of data on outstanding 
arrears within the SOE sector and between SOEs and government (by end-March 2025); and 
publishing a Ministerial Diploma and taking necessary actions to make progress in the transparency 
of SOE procurement processes (by end-February 2025). Moreover, we are advancing with extensive 
public financial management and revenue administration reforms, and pursuing a broad agenda of 
reforms in monetary, foreign exchange and central bank organization. Finally, we reiterate our 
commitment to transparency and accountability in the use of the 2021 SDR allocation, in full 


REPUBLIC OF MOZAMBIQUE 
 
INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND 73 
compliance with the Memorandum of Understanding signed by the Bank of Mozambique and the 
Ministry of Economy and Finance. 
 
We intend to use the ECF arrangement to help fill the projected fiscal financing gap through an on-
lending arrangement by the Bank of Mozambique to the Ministry of Economy and Finance. We are 
aware that a Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) between the Bank of Mozambique and the 
Ministry of Economy and Finance is needed to establish a framework that clarifies the responsibilities 
for timely servicing of the financial obligations to the IMF, and we already have the proper 
procedures in place to make this on-lending operation possible. 
 
Based on the performance to date and our continued commitment to the reforms in our program 
supported by the ECF arrangement, we request approval by the IMF Executive Board of completion 
of the fourth review and the related disbursement of SDR 45.44 million, and modification of the 
MPCC to reflect inflationary developments and our policy response. The program will continue to be 
monitored through six-monthly reviews, quantitative performance criteria (QPC), indicative targets 
(ITs), and structural benchmarks (SBs) as described in the attached MEFP and TMU. 
 
We believe the policies set forth in the attached MEFP are adequate for the implementation of the 
program, and we will take any additional measures that may be appropriate for this purpose. We will 
consult with the IMF before adopting any such measures or in advance of revisions to the policies 
contained in the MEFP. Moreover, we will provide all information requested by the IMF to assess 
implementation of the program. 
 
Your Sincerely, 
 
/s/ 
Ernesto Max Elias Tonela 
Minister of Economy and Finance

Governor of the Bank of Mozambique 
 
 


REPUBLIC OF MOZAMBIQUE

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND 
Attachment I. Memorandum of Economic and Financial Policies 
 
A. Context and Objectives 
1. 
The government continues to focus on enabling a sustainable development path for 
Mozambique whilst dealing with local and global challenges and risks. These continue to place 
pressure on public finances, external viability, and growth. Challenges and risks include a fluctuating 
economic environment with global and local shocks and risks, such as tight financial conditions, 
weakened global supply chains, more frequent and intense climate-related disasters, and security 
challenges in the north of the country.   
2. 
The government’s key development priorities center on advancing sustained inclusive 
growth, and strengthening governance and institutions. The government’s quinquennial 
program (Programa Quinquenal do Governo, 2020-2024) focuses on the development of human 
capital, promotion of gender equity, social inclusion, and protection of the most vulnerable. It aims 
to support economic growth and decentralization while safeguarding fiscal and debt sustainability. 
The program proposes a stable and transparent institutional framework for the management of 
natural resource wealth, particularly for hydrocarbons. The National Development Strategy (ENDE) 
proposal has been discussed with various stakeholders before being adopted by the Council of 
Ministers on June 11, 2024, and submitted to Parliament. It is expected to be discussed in the 
National Assembly for approval after the general elections which will take place in October 2024. 
3. 
The government’s Economic and Financial Program 2022-2025 (EFP), supported by the 
IMF’s Extended Credit Facility (ECF) arrangement, aims to promote sustainable and inclusive 
growth. Under the EFP, the government is supporting economic recovery by avoiding a large 
upfront adjustment, while addressing debt and structural challenges which are contributing to 
macroeconomic vulnerabilities and driving protracted balance of payment (BoP) needs. The EFP aims 
to ensure that public debt declines over the medium term. The government continues to build 
institutions and capacity which are required to manage public resources efficiently and effectively. 
Measures already implemented by the government include (i) reform of the public sector wage bill; 
(ii) adoption of the Sovereign Wealth Fund (SWF) Bill by Parliament and approval of supporting 
regulations; (iii) progress in governance, transparency, and anti-corruption measures; and (iv) 
improvements regarding equality of opportunities and social inclusion. 
4. 
The IMF Executive Board approved a three-year arrangement under the ECF 
arrangement to support Mozambique’s EFP on May 9, 2022. The ECF arrangement supports the 
government’s policy objectives through fostering economic recovery and implementing policies to 
reduce public debt and financing vulnerabilities and creating fiscal space for service provision, 
priority investments in human capital, climate adaptation and infrastructure. Support for the EFP also 
focuses on strengthening governance institutions and the management of public resources while 
improving the business environment to address protracted BoP needs. 
 


REPUBLIC OF MOZAMBIQUE 
INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND 75 
5. 
The ECF arrangement’s targets for international reserves and fiscal performance were 
broadly on track for end-December 2023 (Table 2), the: 
• 
Quantitative performance criterion (QPC) on the floor of net international reserves of the 
Bank of Mozambique was met ($2,810 million versus an adjusted program target of $1,897 
million); 
• 
QPC on the floor of the domestic primary budget balance was not met, at about MT -6.1 
billion (deficit) compared to an adjusted target of MT -1.6 billion; 
• 
PC on non-accumulation of new external arrears was not met;1  
• 
Indicative target (IT) on the social spending floor was not met (MT 2.9 billion versus a target 
of MT 6.8 billion);  
• 
IT on the stock of domestic debt ceiling was met at MT 313.6 billion, relative to a program 
target of MT 341 billion; and 
• 
IT on the present value of new external debt was met at $238 million, relative to a program 
ceiling of $436 million. 
6. 
The inflation target was within the MPCC band. The target on inflation under the MPCC in 
December 2023 was met, where CPI inflation decreased to 4.3 percent in December 2023, within the 
lower and upper bounds of the inflation band (3-9 percent). The target on inflation under the MPCC 
in March 2024 (3-9 percent) was met with inflation further decreasing to 3.03 percent in March 2024. 
The baseline scenario for inflation is to remain at around 3.5 percent (y/y) by end-2024, followed by a 
moderate acceleration towards 5 percent at end-2025. This baseline scenario is predicated on 
continued relaxation of monetary policy in line with announced policy by the BdM, and a tightening 
of fiscal policy in line with the ECF arrangement’s objectives. 
7. 
Performance on the structural benchmarks (SBs) under the ECF arrangement was 
mixed, where three out of four SBs were met. In particular: 
• 
Submission to the Council of Ministers and publication in the Government Gazette a decree-
law ensuring collection of adequate, accurate and up-to-date beneficial ownership 
information of legal persons in the Centralized Registry Legal Entities (CREL) in line with FATF 
recommendation 24 (by end-March 2024) was met.   
• 
SB on the completion and reporting of general audit and "proof of life" of all public sector 
servants by the Inspector-General of Finances (IGF) was not achieved (end-June 2024 SB) 
while progress was made, and will be completed by end-December 2024 (newly proposed 
test date). 
 
1 Assessed continuously. Short-term arrears on external debt service were incurred on several occasions of 2024: in 
January with India ($0.9 million), Korea ($0.1 million), and Nordea Bank ($0.9 million), and in February with the Arab 
Bank for Economic Development in Africa ($0.3 million). 


REPUBLIC OF MOZAMBIQUE 
76 
INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND 
• 
Publication of the financial risk indicators of the SOEs where the State and IGEPE wholly owns 
the entity or is a majority shareholder (50 percent and above) by IGEPE (including data from 
2023) by end-June 2024 (SB) was completed. 
• 
SB on preparation of monthly cash flow forecasts extending three months ahead, and to be 
rolled forward at least monthly going forward, by the National Directorate for Treasury (end-
June 2024 SB) was met. 
8. 
Progress achieved regarding other structural measures stated in the January 2024 
Memorandum of Economic and Financial Policies (MEFP).  
• 
To strengthen social protection and reduce poverty, following the posting of the draft 
ENDE on the MEF Website, the government finalized the ENDE following consultations with 
various stakeholders, and the Council of Ministers submitted it to Parliament for approval in 
June 2024. It is expected to be discussed in the National Assembly after the general elections 
which will take place in October 2024. 
• 
To improve the management of public resources, the government:  
o 
operationalized the interdepartmental financial programming cash management 
committee (Comité de Programação Financeira, CPF) in July 2023, and is enhancing 
the analytical reporting instruments to support the committee’s decision-making 
process;  
o 
is currently drafting a revised PFM strategy (spanning 2024-2033) to prioritize and 
sequence PFM reforms over the next decade; 
o 
is updating the mapping of all central government bank accounts; 
o 
published (i) the 2025-2027 medium-term fiscal scenario was finalized, (ii) the revised 
2023-2025 medium-term debt strategy in August 2023, (ii) the first, second and third 
quarterly debt reports of 2023 in July, October and November 2023, respectively, (iii) 
the 2024 fiscal risks statement in August 2023, (iv) the 2023 annual public debt report 
in May 2024. 
• 
To reinforce revenue administration, the government:  
o 
continued to work on the transversal modules (fiscal execution, bankruptcies, 
payments by installments, risk assessments, audits, claims and recurse, refunds and 
compensations, litigation and tax audits) of the electronic tax filing system e-
tributação expected to be completed by end-December 2024;  
o 
continued efforts to develop the digital interface (Portal do Contribuinte) to enable 
filing and paying taxes electronically for all taxpayers (end-December 2024 SB); 


REPUBLIC OF MOZAMBIQUE 
INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND 77 
o 
is finalizing a strategy to clear the stock of VAT refund arrears to be submitted to the 
Council of Ministers before end-2024. 
• 
To continue building the basis for an inflation targeting framework, the government: 
o 
reformed the interbank market – The public communication on the intervention policy 
was made available in December 2022. Internal guidelines on intervention policy 
were approved on the same date as the FX intervention policy. The two instruments 
entered into force on the same day. In an effort to enhance and expand the interbank 
market, the preparation of the new core IT system is still in progress, and is expected 
to go live by the end-December 2024. The new core IT system will include a module 
to facilitate FX intervention and interbank FX trading.  
o 
reformed the foreign exchange (FX) market – The BdM approved in December 2023 
implementing regulations to support the new FX law passed by the National 
Assembly in October 2022 (with effect from January 29, 2023). The implementing 
regulation came into effect in April 2024. Since eliminating the practice of supplying 
FX required by banks’ clients for their petroleum imports (from June 2023), the BdM 
did not intervene in the FX market, expanding opportunity for price discovery in the 
FX market.  
o 
improved monetary policy communications – The BdM resumed the press conferences 
for monetary policy announcements, improving the transmission of information 
about policy decisions and economic outlook.  
• 
To strengthen the AML/CFT framework, the authorities approved the revised AML/CFT law 
and implementing regulations in August 2023. The manual for risk-based supervision was 
approved by the BdM Board in April 2023. The manual is being enforced by an internal 
regulation since September 2023, which is available to all supervisors. The law addressing 
money laundering and terrorist financing risks in non-governmental organizations is being 
adjusted based on the NPO risk assessment that was completed recently, and is expected to 
be re-submitted to the National Assembly in 2024 for approval. 
• 
To make progress in its financial inclusion agenda, as of end-December 2023, 93.2 
percent of adult population had access to accounts with Mobile Money Operators (MMO), 
increasing from 82.8 in the second quarter of 2023, and surpassing the government’s 
objective of 60 percent for 2022. The interoperability between the financial institutions 
including MMOs and commercial banks has been completed in 2023, which is an important 
step to foster financial inclusion. The legal regime for bank accounts was approved in 
October 2022, and the BdM approved implementing regulation to the law in March 2024. 
• 
To gradually remove restrictions on capital and financial account international 
transactions, the new FX law provides a legal environment where the BdM can confidently 
implement the gradual liberalization of international transactions on both the capital and 
financial account. While the process of relaxing some of the capital and financial transactions 


REPUBLIC OF MOZAMBIQUE 
78 
INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND 
was initiated in 2017, the BdM approved supporting regulations to the new FX law in 
December 2023, and became effective in April 2024.   
9. 
The government is fully committed to the December 2023 MEFP. Unless modified below, 
the policies set out in that document remain valid in full. The quantitative targets that serve as 
performance criteria and indicative targets are proposed to be updated. The updates for structural 
benchmarks and targets are presented in Table 1 and Table 2, respectively. 
B. Supporting the Recovery 
10. 
The economy continues its post-COVID-19 recovery, with real GDP growth estimated at 
5.4 percent in 2023, mainly on the back of mining, while the non-mining economy remained 
below potential. This builds on the estimated growth rate of 4.4 percent in 2022. Growth in 2023 
was driven by LNG production from the Coral South floating platform, where operations commenced 
in October 2022, while non-mining growth moderated. The significant widening of the current 
account deficit in 2022 was reversed during 2023, as tighter financial conditions dampened imports. 
11. 
At the beginning of 2024, the BdM embarked on a loosening cycle, with three cuts in 
the policy rate of 75 bps each in January, March and May 2024, bringing the policy rate to 
15.0 percent. The maintenance of the policy rate at a high level until 2024 and an easing of global 
inflationary pressures led to a steady decline in headline and core inflation to 4.3 and 4.1 percent 
(y/y) in December 2023, respectively. The BdM cited that conditions were right to start an easing 
cycle (including a downturn trend in core inflation and well-anchored expectations) and cut the 
policy rate by 225 bps since the beginning of 2024, with a view to normalization over the coming 2-3 
years. Inflation in April 2024 was at 3.3 percent (y/y), a further decline since end-2023, leaving the 
real policy rate near 12 percent. Over the medium term, the continuation of the easing cycle can 
foster lower real lending rates and support credit growth, subject to continuing moderate inflation 
expectations, settling at around 5 percent.  
12. 
A combination of policies conducted by the BdM during 2023 safeguarded a 
considerable buffer of net international reserves. Since mid-2023, the BdM maintained the 
reserve requirements at 39.0 percent for domestic currency liabilities, and at 39.5 percent for foreign 
currency liabilities, to absorb excessive liquidity in the banking system.  The BdM´s action to end its 
provision of FX to fuel importers since June 2023 and maintenance of the required reserve ratio for 
foreign currency deposits also supported a buildup of Net International Reserves by end-December 
2023 to $2,810 million (well above the adjusted program floor $1,897 million).  
13. 
Due to wage bill slippages, the government is taking the following corrective measures 
to align the wage bill with the 2024 approved budget. The primary balance after grants, on a 
modified cash basis, is expected to reach a surplus of MT 27.5 billion (1.9 percent of GDP) in 2024 
compared to a primary deficit after grants of MT 5.7 billion (0.4 percent of GDP) in 2023.2 This 
reflects arising expenditure pressures and higher wages with general elections getting closer (1.6 
percent of GDP) and lower projected revenue (0.2 percent of GDP) than envisaged in 2024 budget. 
 
2 Modified cash balances are adjusted for payment of arrears accumulated in the previous year. 


REPUBLIC OF MOZAMBIQUE 
INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND 79 
The overall deficit after grants is projected to exceed the budget estimate at MT 15.5 billion (or 1.1 
percent of GDP) in 2024. 
14. 
The government wants to strengthen social protection and aims to reduce the 
incidence of poverty. The ENDE (2025-2044) was recently submitted to Parliament for approval. The 
National Strategy for Basic Social Security (2016-2024) aims to strengthen social protection and 
outlines policies to support poverty reduction. In 2023-24, the National Institute for Social Action 
(INAS) implemented a set of actions to combat poverty and reduce inequality in Mozambique, which 
included: 
• 
expanding electronic payments, contributing towards improved financial inclusion in rural 
areas; 
• 
expanding the social association productive program (PASP) in the Inhambane province;        
• 
implementing social protection actions, through a human capital development project as 
part of the reconstruction of Cabo Delgado;  
• 
providing basic social services whilst promoting the rights of women, children, the elderly

initiating the process to update its information technology (IT) infrastructure to improve 
efficiency and registration of beneficiaries and overcome implementation challenges.  
15. 
While the indicative target on the program floor on social spending was not met at 
end-December 2023, the government will make every endeavor to provide resources for social 
protection programs with the goal of meeting the target of 7 billion meticais in the 2024 
budget. The 2024 budget sets out that the government will aim to continue to provide social 
assistance to more than 1 million households through the Basic Social Subsidy program (PSSB), the 
Direct Social Support Program (PASD), the Program for Social Units (PAUS), the Productive Social 
Action Program (PASP). To achieve these goals, the government will address various technical 
impediments to INAS’s operations, particularly regarding the IT infrastructure and capacity, and is 
committed to make efforts toward digitalization of cash transfer payments to improve efficiency and 
allow for higher execution rates.   
16. 
MEF is also working on assessing the (i) financing options for creating the needed fiscal 
space for social protection and (ii) effectiveness of existing social programs. A study to examine 
the capacity to generate and mobilize resources using via various mechanisms (e.g., through 
increased tax revenue, elimination of illicit flows, social security contributions) to ensure sustainable 
financing for strengthening the social protection system and progressively expand coverage rates is 
underway. Moreover, MEF commenced an analysis on the effectiveness of PSSB, which is a large 
coverage national cash transfer program, to inform policy decisions going forward. These studies, in 
collaboration with external partners, are expected to be completed in 2024, which will ultimately 
inform policy decisions on social protection.

The country’s medium-term prospects remain positive with the government’s program 
centered on increasing non-LNG growth. For the years ahead, non-LNG growth is conservatively 
expected to stabilize at around 4 percent per annum, assuming no spillovers from LNG production. 
The government believes that there is scope to increase this level of growth. This will require working 
with the younger segment of the population, ensuring the availability of ample arable land, 
improving access to water and energy resources, making investments in human capital—through 
expanding provision of services in health, education, and social protection and investing in more 
climate-resilient infrastructure. 
18. 
Mozambique is set to become a major global LNG producer, and LNG production is 
expected to have a significant impact on overall economic growth. Mozambican LNG is an 
important factor in the global energy transition to cleaner fuels, characterized by a relatively low 
carbon content relative to other fossil fuels. Mozambique is also well located to supply Asian and 
European markets. While the contribution of the ENI-led Coral South project to real economic 
activity is expected to moderate in 2024 and 2025 as production volumes reach full capacity. In 2028 
production in the significantly larger Total Energies-led Mozambique LNG project is expected to 
start, followed in 2030 by a third, ExxonMobil-led project (Rovuma LNG), significantly boosting 
economic growth.  
19. 
The rapid growth in LNG poses challenges, and the government will establish policies 
to preserve internal and external macroeconomic balances. This will require the government to 
manage the risks of an appreciation in the exchange rate that could undermine non-hydrocarbon 
sector competitiveness, bring about asset price inflation, and introduce other distortions to the wider 
economy. 
20. 
Over the medium term, the government's fiscal policy objective is aimed at supporting 
economic activity, reducing both public debt and macroeconomic vulnerabilities, and better 
controlling fiscal risks. The Medium-Term Fiscal Scenario is anchored around reaching a domestic 
primary balance of 4 percent of GDP by 2027. The fiscal objectives and targets are anchored around 
consolidating and reducing total public spending from 33 percent of GDP in 2023 to 28 percent in 
2027, mainly driven by a decline in the public sector wage bill as a share of GDP. This consolidation 
should strengthen the fiscal position over the medium-term and lead to a decline in the path of the 
stock of public debt. The generation of primary surpluses and less recourse to domestic borrowing to 
finance the budget deficit will also have a positive effect on private sector financing. 
21. 
Achieving these fiscal policy objectives will allow the reduction of overall balance after 
grants from a deficit of 3.5 percent of GDP in 2023 to a surplus of 0.9 percent in 2027.  The 
government will continue to prioritize external borrowing on favorable financing terms over 
domestic borrowings to finance the budget deficit. 
C. Creating Space for Priority Spending while Addressing Public Debt 
Vulnerabilities 
22. 
The government’s policies are principally focused on ensuring the long-term 
sustainability of public debt. Reducing the debt-to-GDP ratio and correspondingly the external 


REPUBLIC OF MOZAMBIQUE 
INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND 81 
public debt risks over the course of the program will reduce structural vulnerabilities and create fiscal 
buffers to deal with the impact of possible future shocks. Reducing debt service costs will create 
fiscal space to support our development objectives. 
23. 
The government aims to continue with a strong fiscal policy stance aimed at achieving 
a domestic primary surplus of 2.4 percent of GDP in 2024. The following measures underpin this 
goal:  
• 
Initial reforms (TSU) passed by the National Assembly in 2022 were aimed at improving 
controls and predictability over wage bill spending and concentrated on rebalancing and 
consolidating employee remuneration towards a basic wage. The initial estimated upfront 
costs of the reform were 0.7 percent of GDP in 2022, and a full year cost of 1.6 percent of 
GDP from 2023. Problems in implementing the single salary scale resulted in overruns of 3.4 
percent of GDP in 2023. Immediate corrective actions were taken to address these problems, 
including reducing the percentage of the reference salary applied for the calculation of the 
representation subsidy, for statutorily appointed and elected holders of public office and 
completing the registration of some employees in some sectors into the electronic payroll 
system. These measures helped to reduce the wage bill by 1.8 percent of GDP in 2023. 
• 
Public employment compensation reforms: Following the implementation of the single salary 
scale (TSU) the government continues to be committed to a reform strategy which manages 
the cost of public sector employment whilst balancing the service delivery expectations. The 
primary objective is to adjust the wage bill gradually over the medium-term towards more 
sustainable levels of 10 percent of GDP by 2028.   
• 
The authorities commit to continue replacing only one out of every three public employees 
leaving their job except in the sectors of education, health, justice administration bodies, and 
agriculture. Implementation of the employment attrition rule will be monitored and verified 
by the Ministry of State Administration (Ministério da Administração Estatal e da Função 
Publica—MAEFP) in 2024. 
Wage Bill Reducing Measures included:  
• 
Incorporating of all3 non-civil servants into the electronic payroll system (e-folha) and 
fortifying internal controls (such as proof of life evidence) with a goal of completing the 
process by end July-2024; while the proof of life exercise continues to be regularly 
undertaken for civil servants. 
• 
Introducing prior inspection of all payrolls and recommending corrective measures where 
necessary. 
 
3 Currently, 95 percent of non-civil servants have been incorporated into the electronic payroll system. The remaining 
5 percent refer to those involved in active duty. 


REPUBLIC OF MOZAMBIQUE 
82 
INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND 
• 
Implementing the findings from the Inspector-General of Finances (IGF’s) audit of the TSU 
mapping arrangements for all civil and non-civil servants (conducted in May-2023) in 
subsequent payrolls.  
• 
Integrating the medium-term wage bill action plan into the medium-term fiscal framework 
(published in the medium-term fiscal scenario 2024) to ensure consistency of endorsed wage 
bill-reducing policy measures with the objective of controlling the wage bill and achieving 
a wage bill to GDP ratio of 10 percent of GDP by 2028.   
• 
Strengthening monitoring and forecasting of the wage bill to ensure the objective of 
achieving wage bill-to-GDP ratio of 10 percent by 2028. 
• 
The government is also committed to (i) elimination of the risk allowance in the system for all 
non-eligible employees in the payroll from June 2024 onwards; (ii) implementation of 
corrective measures to clean up the payroll of at least 5,000 employees identified as non-
active by the audit by July 2024; (iii) removal  from the payroll of all employees who are 
receiving wage and pension payments; (iv) pass an administrative measure to speed up the 
process of retirement for all public servants (except magistrates, doctors and teachers) who 
have reached the age of 60 by December 2023; (v) revision of the location allowance (Decree 
91/2009) reducing the coverage areas (previously by district, now by administrative post) and 
professional groups (now reducing coverage to include only the health, education and justice 
sectors as well as agricultural extension workers); (vi) reduction of the seniority supplement 
by 50 percent across public sector employees (excluding magistrates and doctors), after 24 
and 30 years of service, ,to be achieved by revising Article 14 of Decree 31/2022 of July 13, 
Article 12 of Decree 53/2022 and Article 14 of Decree 54/2022, of October 14. 
Revenue Measures included: 
• 
Ensured compliance measures and enforcement of personal income tax collection of all 
sectors starting from June 2023. 
• 
Resumed the automatic fuel price mechanism for diesel and gasoline prices in May 2023 
which initially increased the price of diesel and decreased the price of gasoline. The evolution 
of pump prices has reabsorbed the gap with international prices resulting in higher state 
revenue. Government liabilities to fuel distributors reached MT 2.3 bn by end-March 2024. 
• 
A joint MEF-MIREME Ministerial Diploma (Regulation) to determine the reference price of 
minerals in line with international prices was issued in July 2023. The diploma requires firms 
to use an international benchmarked reference price for mineral products to calculate their 
tax liability as opposed to the previous practice of using the firm's last declared price.  
Reference prices for minerals are being updated monthly using the average of international 
prices for the previous month with support from a committee composed of the MEF, 
Revenue Authority (AT), and MIREME. 
• 
Broadening the VAT base to build a robust and fair revenue collection mechanism that does 
not depend on volatile commodity revenues. The government eliminated several VAT 


REPUBLIC OF MOZAMBIQUE 
INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND 83 
exemptions with effect from January 1, 2023. Further exemptions expired starting from 
January 1, 2024 (sugar, oil, soap). Domestic zero-ratings on goods and services will continue 
on basic items and exemptions for the agricultural and renewables sectors which accord with 
the development priorities of the government. On January 1, 2023 the VAT rate was reduced 
to 16 percent and the window during which VAT refunds can be claimed was reduced to 
12 months. 
• 
The government is also committed to the application of personal income tax (PIT) 
deductions, from July 2024 onwards, to all public servants and all incomes. 
24. 
The Tax Authority (AT) launched the five-year strategy spanning 2023-2027 laying out 
main objectives and a roadmap. The main goals include (i) boosting domestic revenue collection, 
(ii) broadening the tax base, and (iii) promoting efficiency and integrity. To strengthen revenue 
collection capacity, TA will pay attention to the performance of various sectors and marking of fuel 
products. It will also focus on tax and customs compliance by making steps toward digitalizing the 
inspections, and introducing mechanisms to tackle evasion and avoidance. To promote efficiency, TA 
will work on improving project and process management, and performance indicators. It will also 
focus on ensuring security and pace of flow of goods by fighting against corruption and customs 
crime, as well as in minimizing customs clearance times. Efforts to promote transparency will 
accompany these steps, which include ensuring a reliable and up-to-date database to support the 
registration of profiling of taxpayers, improving the quality of service, aimed at facilitating non-face-
to-face service and voluntary compliance. TA also plans to launch tax education and awareness 
programs for the public. TA has been requested technical assistance from the IMF to further support 
these efforts. 
25. 
The government continues to strengthen its institutional capacity for public debt 
management. The government remains committed to building the capacity of the public debt 
management directorate (DNGDP), and enhancing the sustainability and transparency of public 
sector debt management, by publishing quarterly and annual debt reports which cover stocks, on-
lending, and state guarantees, including SOEs. The ongoing transition to the new database 
(Meridian)for public debt management has encompassed all central government external debt. The 
government plan to incorporate all domestic debt into Meridian, if the technology solutions allow. 
Communication with the markets will be further strengthened. The updated Medium Term Debt 
Strategy (MTDS) for 2023-2025 reflecting developments in the global and domestic economy and in 
financial markets was approved and published in August 2023. Following a capital market diagnostic, 
the government is preparing concrete intervention measures aimed at strengthening the market over 
the medium-term horizon. DNGDP plans to continue developing the government bond markets in 
the country, and this action is a recommendation in the MTDS. 
26. 
The government is taking measures to continue reducing the occurrence of delays in 
debt service payments. Urgent measures aimed at building contingent provisions for the Treasury 
are being studied, including the consolidation of public sector deposits with the purpose of building 
a liquidity/cash pool which would provide government with prompt and efficient access to relatively 
cheaper resources by tapping the idle deposits of public institutions to finance temporary/seasonal 
deficits. The government is looking to restrain issuances of short to medium-term bonds to avoid 


REPUBLIC OF MOZAMBIQUE 
84 
INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND 
incurring new liabilities within this already critical redemption horizon. In addition, the preparation of 
the cash flow projections will improve cash and debt management.  
D. Governance and Management of Public Resources 
27. 
Reaching Mozambique’s long-term economic potential and meeting society’s needs 
require decisive actions to ensure public resources are well managed. The government has 
strengthened its capacity to analyze fiscal risks and publishes regular reports through the fiscal risk 
directorate (DGR). The quality of fiscal risks analysis is being enhanced by measures such as the 
annual credit risk analysis of the SOE sector and an analysis on PPPs which will be continued to be 
included in the 2025 Fiscal Risks Report (RRF).  
Governance Reforms  
28. 
Key outstanding priorities from the Diagnostic Report focus on reducing scope for 
corruption and conflicts of interest in the natural resource sector.  
i. 
Reform of the Public Probity Law. In November 2023, the government submitted to the 
National Assembly draft amendments to the Public Probity Law, seeking to strengthen the 
overall asset declarations and conflicts of interest systems. Discussions took place in late May 
2024, and the amendments were approved, and are planned to be published by end-July 
2024. 
ii. 
Beneficial ownership. Enhancing transparency on natural persons who ultimately own or 
control a legal person or arrangement, which allows the person(s) benefit from legal 
person’s transactions and the income it generates is a key commitment in the Governance 
Diagnostic Report and to the Financial Action Task Force (FATF) action plan to address its 
strategic deficiencies, as well as to the Extractive Industries Transparency Initiative. In this 
regard, using the definition of beneficial ownership in the new August 2023 AML/CFT law 
(consistent with FATF standards), revisions to the Regulation on the Registration of Legal 
Entities and the AML/CFT law require all entities to register and identify their beneficial 
owners at a centralized registry (Registry of Legal Entities, CREL).  
iii. 
The government revised CREL regulations ensuring collection of adequate, accurate and 
up-to-date beneficial ownership information of legal persons in the Centralized Registry 
Legal Entities (CREL) in line with FATF recommendation 24 by end-March 2024 (SB).4  
iv. 
CREL is preparing an action plan and guidance for outreach to raise awareness and 
disseminate information; assessing options to speed up data collection process and identify 
inactive firms in the registry; and working on an interface to collect beneficial ownership 
information and an internal website to ensure efficient and timely access to beneficial 
 
4 Going forward, the government might consider submitting to Parliament a stand-alone law on beneficial ownership 
to complete and consolidate the legal and institutional framework in line with the FATF recommendations. 


REPUBLIC OF MOZAMBIQUE 
INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND 85 
ownership information by competent authorities (as recommended by FATF), while the 
completion of data collection for all entities will likely take time.  
v. 
The authorities are also committed to:  
a. Publishing adequate, accurate and up-to-date information on the procurement portal 
(in a freely accessible format) on the beneficial owners of the entities awarded general 
government procurement contracts on a quarterly basis in the quarter following the 
contract award (applying the ceiling of 60 million MT as defined in the regulation for 
the Contracting of Public Works Contracts, the Supply of Goods and the Provision of 
Services to the State, approved by Decree no. 79/2022, of December 30, along with the 
information on the date in which the contact is awarded, the duration of the contract 
(start and end dates), the contracting authority, the description of goods/services/works 
in the contract awarded, the name of the awarded entity, the country of the awarded 
entity, the value of the awarded contract, and the name(s) of the beneficial owner(s) of 
the awarded entity), except defense- and security-related contracts by end-September 
2024 (structural benchmark). To make progress toward this goal, UFSA already started 
to publish (on its website, freely accessible) the information that was collected so far, 
and will continue working on addressing remaining issues with the data coverage and 
quality in coming months.  
b. Enhancing and broadening the information collected from the declarations which are 
made regarding mining titles, ensuring systemic information on the beneficial owners 
of mining titles and contracts (including their name, nationality and country of 
residence) is collected and then input into a digitized Cadastral Archive, which will be 
updated regularly. Statutory modifications to enable ongoing publication of 
information on beneficial owners in the extractives industry will be completed by end-
December 2024.  
29. 
The government remains committed to transparently follow up on the findings and 
recommendations from external audits on COVID-19 spending. The Supreme Audit Institution’s 
(Tribunal Administrativo) audit reports on COVID-19 emergency expenditure in 2020 and 2021, 
including a summary of findings and recommendations, were published5 (end-December 2023 SB), 
decisively contributing to transparency and accountability. The government internal control and 
audit bodies are monitoring and reporting on the implementation of the recommendations, 
including through an internal action plan developed by MEF. In 2024, the Tribunal Administrativo will 
conduct a follow up audit on progress in the implementation of its recommendations and the report 
will be published on MEF’s website by end-March 2025.  
30. 
Building on the experience and positive impact from the publication of Covid-19-
related audits, the government will enhance the overall transparency of the Tribunal 
Administrativo’s audit reports, further contributing to fiscal transparency. Mozambique's 
Constitution and laws guarantee citizens' access to information under principles of maximum 
 
5 2020 (mef.gov.mz) ; 2021 (mef.gov.mz) 


REPUBLIC OF MOZAMBIQUE 
86 
INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND 
disclosure, public interest, open public administration and permanent accountability, and specifically 
mandates that audit reports shall be made public through different means, including government 
websites (article 6(2) of Law 34/2014 on Access to Information Law).  
i. 
To operationalize this important obligation, by end-June 2025 , the Council of Ministers is 
considering to approve and publish amendments to Decree 35/2015 of December 31 
(Regulations to the Access to Information Law) requiring audited entities to publish on their 
websites (in a freely accessible format), before the initiation of the jurisdictional phase, 
final/full audit reports by the Tribunal Administrativo, within 15 days of their receipt, 
including findings, but excluding references to individualized financial responsibilities. This 
requirement is intended to mandate publication of audit reports covering FY 2023 and 
onward.  
31. 
In addition, the government will explore options and prioritize efforts to advance the 
transition of the Public Accounts Section of the Tribunal Administrativo into a Supreme Audit 
Institution (Tribunal do Contas). Appreciating that this has been a long-standing issue in public 
debate, government recognizes the need to further strengthen the autonomy safeguards, 
effectiveness, timeliness and capacities of our external audit system, which would not only enhance 
the public sector’s accountability, but would also contribute to making its operations and spending 
more efficient. By end-2024, the government will publish a time-bound action plan seeking to guide 
and facilitate progress and monitoring of this critical reform. In the meantime, the government will 
continue supporting (i) the implementation of the Tribunal Administrativo’s Strategic and 
Operational Plan (PLACOR IV6), aimed at strengthening its practices, (ii) the roll out of a system that 
would allow electronic submission of public accounts to the Tribunal Administrativo, and (iii) efforts 
to further consolidate coordination and collaboration among audit agencies.  
32. 
The BdM Organic law is being revised. Revisions to the law will be finalized in consultation 
with the IMF and the draft law will be submitted to the National Assembly in 2025. The revision of 
the law is found in the need to: (i) strengthen BdM’s mandate by explicitly stating its financial 
stability and macroprudential functions; (ii) strengthen limits on monetary financing of the budget; 
and (iii) improve the BdM’s autonomy, governance, and accountability. 
33. 
The BdM will continue to modernize its internal audit function, benchmarking its 
activities in this area against international best practice. A peer review External Quality 
Assessment was undertaken by the Central Bank of Brazil in August 2022, evaluating consistency with 
the International Professional Practices Framework (IPPF) promulgated by the Institute of Internal 
Auditors (IIA). The next steps in strengthening the BdM’s internal audit function include a revision of 
core internal audit regulation procedures. 
34. 
The BdM will continue implementing recommendations from the 2020 Safeguards 
Assessment to meet best practices in governance and transparency. The BdM published its 2023 
audited annual reports in March 2024. The BdM is improving the management and circulation of 
cash, implementing TA recommendations. The BdM also received IMF/Norges Bank training on

REPUBLIC OF MOZAMBIQUE 
INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND 87 
practical applications of International Financial Reporting Standards in the central bank context. The 
BdM is currently reviewing its internal controls over vault access and custody, with a goal of finalizing 
it by end-March 2025.  
Managing Resources from Liquefied Natural Gas 
35. 
Harnessing the potential of LNG wealth for the Mozambican people will require 
reforms across several critical areas. The government is making all efforts to ensure the country’s 
gas resources are managed well and transparently, with broad public support. The government will 
ensure fiscal revenues from the exploitation of these natural resources are spent and invested 
efficiently and effectively, delivering positive outcomes for Mozambique. Finally, the government will 
ensure that the country’s monetary and financial frameworks are sufficiently robust to avoid 
macroeconomic distortions and foster the efficient allocation of capital in the economy. 
36. 
Following the approval of the SWF law, the government approved regulations, 
investment policy and management agreement between itself and the central bank to 
optimally manage LNG resources. The SWF Law was approved by Parliament in December 2023, 
followed by supporting regulations in February 2024. MEF is in the process of setting up the 
Investment Advisory Board and the Supervisory Committee, and finalizing the Investment Policy and 
the Management Agreement. Investment of the SWF‘s resources will be undertaken by the BdM and 
observe the highest standards of accountability and transparency. The SWF will invest in foreign 
assets, assisting in managing the macroeconomic consequences of high revenue flows, and 
addressing intergenerational equity. The law includes a revenue repartition rule which divides LNG 
related fiscal revenues between the SWF and the budget. Rules and conditions for using SWF 
resources in case of emergencies are transparent, reflected in the SWF Law and regulations. To 
manage the remaining volatility in budget revenues, the government will develop a fiscal framework 
covering medium-term budget objectives (in particular, public investment) and the use of resources 
above expected levels.  
Managing Fiscal Resources 
37. 
Ensuring taxation and government spending are efficient, effective, and transparent is 
a key priority. The government will continue to build on existing, extensive reform programs and 
capacity development activities. 
Revenue Administration  
38. 
The Revenue Administration (Autoridade Tributária, AT) is modernizing the tax 
collection system, through the implementation of the electronic tax filing system (e-
tributação). E-tributação was made available at all tax offices across the country to collect all taxes 
during 2023. By October 2024, all total tax receipts will be collected through e-tributação. E-
tributação is interfaced with e-SISTAFE (the financial management information system) resulting in a 
faster transfer of resources to the Treasury Single Aaccount) (CUT) and nine commercial banks and 
automatic classification of revenue collections. The customs system (JUE)) is planned to be interfaced 
with e-SISTAFE by September 2024. To complete the process, the AT is finetuning the transversal 


REPUBLIC OF MOZAMBIQUE 
88 
INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND 
modules with a goal of completing this process by December 2024 (fiscal execution, bankruptcies, 
payments by installments, risk assessments, audits, claims and recourse, refunds and compensations, 
litigation and tax audits).   
39. 
The Tax Authority (AT) experienced continued delays in developing the digital 
interface (Portal do Contribuinte) which will allow all taxpayers to file and pay all taxes 
electronically by end-December 2024 (end-December 2024, structural benchmark). Th interface 
connects the taxpayer with e-tributação and is currently operational for only two types of taxes: VAT 
and the simplified tax for small taxpayers. At end-April 2024, the Portal do Contribuinte covered 
almost 24.2 percent of taxpayers in VAT and small taxpayers, and 100 percent of large taxpayers 
(with the total number of large taxpayers being 1,302). Delays are mainly due to bottlenecks in the 
procurement process, while TA makes every effort to accelerate the processes. The objective is to 
cover all taxpayers by end-December 2024.  
40. 
Modernizing the taxpayer registry and enhancing interoperability with other public 
registries remain a key step towards achieving improved revenue collection. The Tax Authority 
(TA) has cleaned and updated the taxpayer registry (NUIT), removed duplicated taxpayers, and 
verified the registry for all large taxpayers, 70 percent of medium taxpayers and 60 percent of small 
taxpayers, as of March 2024. The verification of taxpayers in the exemption regime will follow. The TA 
is also enhancing links and interoperability of the taxpayer registry with other public registries, 
including the commercial banks (completed), civil registry, JUE, Balcao de Atendimento (BAU), Going 
forward, the taxpayer registry will be linked to the ministries of Justice and Tourism, and utility 
companies.  
41. 
The Tax Authority (TA) has prepared a reform to modernize its structure and continues 
to progress in gathering and cross-checking third-party information to increase taxpayer 
compliance and collection of tax arrears. The reform proposal for the internal organizational 
structure is expected to be approved by the Council of Ministers by end-September 2024. The 
organizational structure will integrate the risk management committee created to strengthen 
compliance, and design procedures for taxes and customs across all value chains, with a focus on 
mining and gas taxation. This committee has started using the mining and gas risk assessment matrix 
to develop compliance performance plans and perform audits to extractive companies. Going 
forward, Athas requested assistance from the IMF to inform the medium-term information 
technology and compliance risks management strategies. 
42. 
The MEF is committed to addressing the deficiencies in the VAT refund mechanism and 
to clear accumulated arrears. The MEF is updating the strategy to clear the current stock of VAT 
refund arrears (amounting to about MT 38 billion at end-April 2024) and is planning to submit a final 
strategy to the Council of Ministers in coming months. The government will retain 16.5 percent of 
the share of VAT gross collection in 2024 for the payment of refunds, to ensure sufficient resources 
are available for refunds and avoid any further accumulation of arrears. 


REPUBLIC OF MOZAMBIQUE 
INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND 89 
Public Financial Management (PFM) 
43. 
The government is preparing its second PFM strategy (covering 2024-2033), to reflect 
commitments taken in the new core PFM law (SISTAFE) and recent challenges.7 The strategy is 
anticipated to be completed by end-June 2024, which will likely to be approved after elections by the 
Council of Ministers in 2025. Its main objective is to guide PFM reforms in a prioritized and 
coordinated manner and address new challenges, including strengthening budgetary execution 
norms pertaining to spending in an emergency context, as informed by the experience of COVID 
spending. 
44. 
The government is building on its important reforms of budget execution processes to 
strengthen the expenditure chain and financial controls and prevent the accumulation of 
expenditure arrears. To enhance budget execution control, budget discipline and budget 
transparency: 
• 
Most of the stages of the public procurement process are incorporated into the  
e-SISTAFE system (MPE, Modulo de Património do Estado), from the preparation of 
procurement plans to the signature of the contract. As of end-March 2024, the proportion of 
procured expenditures managed through MPE, including most goods and services and public 
investment, with the exception of public works, reached almost 70 percent.  
• 
The financial programming committee continued to hold monthly meetings. The April 2024 
meeting reviewed the initial 2024 cash flow projections and were presented with progress 
against the initial plan to end February 2024.8  A contextualized version of the IMF’s Cash 
Forecasting and Analysis Tool (CFAT) provides content for the analytical reports supporting 
the committee’s decision-making process. MEF is establishing business rules to regularize 
monthly processes for all required information to be provided to Treasury promptly. The 
government continues to address the operational challenges of operating the new quarterly 
Treasury budget system. This includes challenges to better integrate revenue and debt 
servicing projections into the system, and to rely on accurate wage bill projections. MEF is 
transitioning to a system where it will issue and service Treasury instruments for cash 
management purposes, to smooth the profile of government cash flows and respond to cash 
flow shortfalls. 
45. 
The government aims to move from a cash rationing approach to a pro-active 
management of cash flows and balances. Treasury is currently working on three pillars of the cash 
flow forecasting process: (i) building capacity across all government entities to better plan their 
expenditures and cash requirements across the budget year; (ii) developing the tools (eventually 
using e-SISTAFE) to provide appropriate cash flow reporting for decisions makers; and (iii) building 
analytical capacity within Treasury to analyze reports and advise on the cash flows environment to 
 
7 These challenges have been broadly identified in recent diagnostics, including the Public Investment Management 
Assessment (PIMA), the Fiscal Transparency Evaluation (FTE) and the Public Expenditure and Financial Accountability 
(PEFA) assessment.  
8 Members of the committee comprise staff from Treasury, Budget, Accounting, CEDSIF, Tax Authority, and Debt 
Management.

the cash flow committee. Treasury prepared rolling cash flow forecasts for the year on a monthly 
basis (to be rolled at monthly frequency) by May 2024 (end-June 2024 SB). Going forward, Treasury 
will extend its effort to move to weekly cash flow forecasts with three-month rolling basis. 
46. 
The MEF is undertaking a full mapping of all central and provincial governments bank 
accounts to enhance the coverage of the treasury single account (Conta Única do Tesouro—CUT). 
The legal framework for operating a modern treasury single account is already provided through the 
existing SISTAFE law and regulations. However, there are thousands of accounts in commercial banks 
(off-CUT) and the Treasury is gaining control with support from the Bank of Mozambique. The 
government will complete this mapping and further reinforce the categorization and reporting 
mechanisms of off-CUT accounts by September 2024.  
47. 
The government has strengthened public investment management and will focus on 
improving the climate resilience of public infrastructure investments. The revised SISTAFE law 
regulation requires mandatory appraisals for capital expenditures above US$30 million, and this has 
been observed for all projects included in the 2024 budget proposal. A decree (79/2022) on public 
procurement has been passed and related procedures (manual and tender template) are being 
updated and expected to be released by the MEF in 2024.  
48. 
The government is committed to strengthening public procurement transparency and 
is taking steps to enhance risk-based monitoring and auditing mechanisms and practices to 
facilitate detecting and investigating corruption and mismanagement. In the context of limited 
resources, it is essential to optimize efforts and target high-value and high-risk areas and activities 
that can significantly impact the government’s operational costs and efficient performance, while 
enhancing public availability of information that can be subject to public scrutiny. 
i. 
The procurement authority (UFSA) has published detailed statistics on the use by general 
government (divided by central and provincial levels) of competitive and-noncompetitive 
procurement processes in 2023,9 and will continue quarterly publications moving forward.10 
ii. 
To increase risk-based monitoring capabilities and overall transparency, UFSA will develop 
and publish statistics bi-annually, showing the prevalence of competitive and non-
competitive procurement processes across government sectors based on the government’s 
administrative classification.  
iii. 
As a first step, by end-June 2025, UFSA will publish on its website (in a freely accessible 
format) statistics on the use of competitive and non-competitive procurement modalities (as 
defined in the Procurement Regulations approved by Decree 79/2022 of December 30, and 
in similar terms to the above mentioned publications in (i) in this paragraph), by the five 
Ministries and 10 government entities or agencies (i.e., procurement units) with the largest 
procurement spending during the corresponding period, including (a) the total number and 
value of their contracts, and (b) the share of each procurement modality of the total number

REPUBLIC OF MOZAMBIQUE 
INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND 91 
and value of all their contracts undertaken in the first half of 2024 (except security-related 
contracts and with published data covering the procurement activities available in the e-
SISTAFE). Going forward, UFSA will continue bi-annual publications of this data, progressively 
increasing the coverage of ministries and entities.  
49. 
The adoption of the new electronic platform (e-SNIP11) and use of the public 
investment appraisal manual (Manual Geral de Identificação, formulação e avaliação de 
Projetos) enables the government to appraise and approve public investment projects. The 
government continues to strengthen its capacity in planning and selecting projects over time, 
namely by using criteria relating to the climate-change resilience of infrastructure projects, with 
World Bank support. The IMF carried out a diagnosis of public investment management focused on 
climate issues (C-PIMA).  
50. 
The government will continue strengthening the governance, oversight, transparency 
and accountability of SOEs. Government and IGEPE are committed to accelerate efforts to achieve 
these goals.  
i. 
The MEF Fiscal Risks Directorate (DGR) published financial risks indicators for SOEs (i.e., those 
where the State and/or IGEPE wholly or majority own the entity (more than 50 percent) (end-
June 2024 SB).  
ii. 
DGR published a detailed report on SOEs’ Financial Health, with the support from IMF. Going 
forward, it will further explore options on projecting and quantifying the fiscal risks arising 
from the SOE sector.   
iii. 
MEF will publish in the Public Debt Report information on the outstanding SOE-SOE and 
SOE-government arrears for 10 large SOEs as included in the IGEPE’s 2022 report (EDM, ENH, 
CFM, ADM, PETROMOC, TMCEL, EMOSE, BNI, EMODRAGA, LAM) and HCB over the period of 
2021-2023. This data will include the amounts of arrears (by end of each of these years, in 
nominal terms) between each pairs of those 11 SOEs, and also between each of those 11 
SOEs and government (including the arrears from each SOEs to government, and from the 
government to each SOEs separately) (newly proposed structural benchmark with a test 
date of end-March 2025).  
iv. 
Going forward, MEF is committed to continue the publication of data regarding arrears (as 
covered above) annually, which will allow MEF to monitor the arrears regularly. This data will 
ultimately inform a joint MEF and IGEPE strategy (in cooperation with each SOEs) on 
preventing the accumulation of new arrears and how to make progress toward eliminating 
existing arrears.  
v. 
IGEPE is committed to continue disclosing relevant information on the SOE portfolio, 
including on their procurement policies and practices. To that end, (i) by end-February  2025 , 
MEF will publish a Ministerial Diploma requiring IGEPE and each SOE (fully- or  majority-

REPUBLIC OF MOZAMBIQUE 
92 
INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND 
owned with an ownership share of 50 percent or above) to publish on their website (freely 
accessible) (a) the procurement policies within 15 days following the IGEPE’s approval, and 
(b) annual procurement plans within the first two months of each fiscal year; and (ii) by end-
December 2024, IGEPE will publish the procurement policies (on its website freely accessible) 
for 10 SOEs (newly proposed structural benchmark with a test date of end-February 2025).  
vi. 
IGEPE is committed to publish the fiscal year 2025 procurement plans for all SOEs in early 
2025.  
vii. 
IGEPE is currently overseeing the process to update all SOEs’ procurement policies, including 
the required introduction of AML, beneficial ownership transparency and anti-corruption 
elements. Once this process is finalized for all SOEs, IGEPE will complete the publication of 
the procurement policies for all SOEs in 2025. 
viii. 
The MEF Fiscal Risks Directorate (DGR) and the National Treasury and Economic Cooperation 
Directorate (DNTCE) will work on an initial assessment of the fiscal risks arising from the of 
public institutes and funds. As a next step, based on this work, DGR will assess the need 
whether or not to focus on financial risk indicators of those entities. 
51. 
The MEF is creating a task force to monitor the implementation and supervision of 
reimbursements of on-lending agreements. The MEF issued a note reiterating the mandatory 
ratification of any multiannual loans by municipalities (as per Law No. 1/2008 Art. 20) as well as 
instructions to banks on complying with the specific legal requirements when lending to 
municipalities. The Debt Directorate of the MEF (DNGDP) will strengthen the oversight of national 
and municipal SOEs borrowing, on-lending agreements, PPPs and public guarantees, in coordination 
with DGR and DNTCE, and publish data in annual debt and fiscal risk reports.  
52. 
The government will continue to strengthen fiscal transparency and fiscal risks 
management. The government will continue to publish the: (i) annual medium-term fiscal 
framework; (ii) quarterly and annual debt management reports; and (iii) fiscal risks statements. These 
reports support transparent budgetary discussions, amongst other uses.  
E. Monetary and Financial Sector Reform 
53. 
The Bank of Mozambique continues to build the basis for an inflation targeting 
framework, with IMF and Norges Bank support. It is implementing a forward-looking monetary 
policy framework based on a policy interest rate (MIMO) to signal the stance of policy and promote 
price stability. Effective monetary transmission of changes in the policy rate to economic activity 
hinges on deepening the interbank and foreign exchange (FX) markets. 
The Next Steps are as Follows:  
i. 
In monetary operations, to sharpen its monetary policy response to the state of the 
economy, the BdM plans to continue improving its forecasting process, including by further 
refining its medium--term forecasts for oil and non-oil GDP. In addition, the BdM, with TA 


REPUBLIC OF MOZAMBIQUE 
INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND 93 
from Norges Bank, has been enhancing its liquidity forecasting capacity to improve liquidity 
management. Despite enhanced communication between government agencies and the 
BdM, liquidity management remains dependent on strengthened cash flow management 
by the government. 
ii. 
Reform of the foreign exchange (FX) market. The BdM is introducing policies to help 
develop the FX market over the medium-term, including by fostering better price discovery 
by market participants. The revised determination of the reference exchange rate, based on 
actual volume-weighted market transactions rather than quoted rates, was approved in 
May 2022. Its implementation is subject to the go-live of the BdM’s new core IT system, 
scheduled to go live at end-December 2024. The BdM is also progressing towards adopting 
the FX Global Code, in cooperation with market participants, which would be a significant 
milestone in securing adhesion by the Bank of Mozambique, and the banking and non-
banking sectors to best international practices for the FX market.   
iii. 
Improvements on monetary policy communications. The BdM resumed the press 
conferences for monetary policy announcements, enhancing information sharing regarding 
policy decisions and economic outlook. 
54. 
The BdM is committed to maintaining financial stability. The BdM is gradually building 
up its databases and tools for analyzing and assessing risks to the financial system. From 2021, BdM 
has published the Financial Stability Bulletin and Financial Stability Reports (FSRs) yearly. The reports 
include assessments of systemic risks and vulnerabilities of the Mozambican financial system and the 
robustness of the country’s banking sector. Furthermore, the FSRs include an overview and 
assessment of the macroprudential policy measures implemented by the BdM. During the period of 
collaboration with Norges Bank, a framework for macroprudential solvency stress testing the 
Mozambican banks has been fully developed.  Going forward, the BdM will conduct an internal 
discussion regarding the possibility of publishing stress tests on financial stability as part of the FSR, 
in order to reinforce and broaden the tools available for stability analysis and communication to the 
public.  
55. 
The BdM is assessing its bank regulation and advancing in bank supervision. Drawing 
on the experience of countries in the region with the implementation process, the BdM is assessing 
the impact for its banking system of a transition from Basel II to Basel III capital accords. In that 
context, the BdM completed a gap assessment of its supervisory process and regulation, with the 
effective implementation of Basel III standards to take place during the period 2024-2026. As a part 
of the Basel III implementation process, the risk weights for all assets will be reevaluated. Further 
there is an ongoing collaboration between the Bank of Mozambique and the National Debt 
Directorate overseeing SOE debt. With IMF TA support, the BdM developed a regulation on 
cybersecurity risks, which was approved in March 2024, and conducted a pilot on-site examination of 
a systemic bank in 2022. Furthermore, the BdM has received an IMF TA to develop its manual on 
cybersecurity supervision, which is expected to be approved in December 2024.  
56. 
The government is addressing the findings of the June 2021 Eastern and Southern 
Africa Anti-Money Laundering Group (ESAAMLG) mutual evaluation report (MER). The 


REPUBLIC OF MOZAMBIQUE 
94 
INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND 
government continues to take a series of measures and actions to tackle significant technical 
compliance deficiencies and effectiveness challenges flagged in the June 2021 MER report.  these 
measures include: 
• 
Reforms which strengthen the framework for collecting and holding beneficial ownership 
information (in line with the Financial Action Task Force (FATF) definition of beneficial 
ownership).  
• 
Implementation of the risk-based supervision framework in September 2022, and the 
appointment of additional staff to the BdM’s Prudential Supervision Department in January 
2023 to enhance the AML/CFT activities, while the BdM will continue assess its relevant 
staffing needs. 
• 
Strengthening the information exchange framework. The BdM signed Memoranda of 
Understanding (MoU) with the FIU (GIFiM), the General Inspectorate of Gaming (Inspecção 
Geral de Jogos – IGJ) and the Insurance Supervision Institute of Mozambique (Instituto de 
Supervisão de Seguros de Moçambique- ISSM). The BdM cooperates with the Attorney 
General’s office and law enforcement under the requirements of the Criminal Proceeding 
Code and their Organic Law. The Bank of Mozambique signed Memoranda of Understanding 
with the Kimberley Process, Precious Metals and Gemstone Management Unit (UGPK), on 20 
November 2023, and with the Communications Regulatory Authority (Instituto Nacional das 
Comunicações de Moçambique - INCM), on 21 November 2023. 
• 
The BdM started an awareness program in 2022 to microfinance institutions and other high-
risk institutions identified in the National Risk Assessment (March 2022) throughout the 
country, which is continuous.  
57. 
Central bank reforms will strengthen the payment system and foster financial 
inclusion. The government completed its evaluation of the implementation of its 2016-2022 
National Financial Inclusion Strategy in 2023. Recommendations from the evaluation will inform the 
new strategy. The BdM is reforming the payment system law to improve its resilience, transparency 
and flexibility, with technical assistance from IMF. The BdM expects to internally approve the 
proposal and submit the draft law to the MEF by December 2024. The revised law, aligned with 
international best practices, will strengthen the BdM powers in the national payment system, and 
improve financial inclusion. The BdM has acquired a modern an integrated platform for a Real Time 
National Payment System (RTGS), which is in operation since November 2023.     
58. 
The BdM’s crisis management framework is being strengthened. Following approval of 
the regulations governing recovery and resolution planning, the BdM has issued guidelines on 
recovery plans content and resolution plans’ information requirements in line with the banking law 
provisions. The BdM is proposing reforms to the Deposit Guarantee Fund Regulation, with technical 
assistance from KfW, and an independent consultant hired by the World Bank, aiming at aligning its 
functions with the scope of the new resolution framework, including by revising the corporate 
governance structure and the revision of the premium structure paid by the participants.  The 


REPUBLIC OF MOZAMBIQUE 
INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND 95 
Revised Deposit Guarantee Fund Regulation was approved by the Council of Ministers on May 7, 
2024.  
59. 
The government remains committed to its obligations under Article VIII, sections 2, 3, 
and 4 of the Fund’s Articles of Agreement. 
F. Risks and Contingencies 
60. 
The government stands ready to adjust policies if risks materialize. Downside risks to the 
program include growth setbacks from commodity price or global trade shocks from geopolitical 
tensions, natural disasters or from procyclical fiscal tightening resulting from a lack of financing. 
Banks’ asset quality may deteriorate if the effects of higher fuel prices or the lagged impact of the 
pandemic on borrower creditworthiness worsen. Important reforms could be delayed by political and 
institutional constraints or have fiscal costs overshooting program projections.  
61. 
Medium-term risks center on recurrent risks of natural disasters and a deterioration of 
the security situation, leading to further delays in the LNG projects, or full withdrawal of the 
current investors. If these risks materialize, the authorities stand ready to adjust their policies, in 
close consultation with IMF staff, to ensure the achievement of the program’s objectives.  
G. Building Resilience to Climate Change and Public Health Emergencies 
62. 
The government intends to step up efforts to tackle climate change vulnerabilities and 
its confluence with public health emergencies. Following the Paris agreement, the government 
has made a strong commitment to reduce greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions by 2025 in its updated 
National Determined Contribution (NDC), based on the national climate change strategy adopted in 
2013. The NDC foresees a reduction of GHG emissions by about 40 million tCO2eq between 2020 
and 2025. ENDE draws particular attention to fostering climate resilience in key sectors (agriculture, 
forestry, energy and transport).  
i. 
The government intends to update its NDC in 2025 and adopt a National Policy on Climate 
Finance and carbon market regulation.  
ii. 
For adaptation, the government has taken measures in several vulnerable areas to reduce 
disaster risk, enabling districts to develop local adaptation plans. Moreover, a climate finance 
unit is planned to be established in the MEF to foster resource mobilization to support 
investment in adaptation and mitigation in a context of tight financing conditions.  
iii. 
For mitigation purposes, it will implement the REDD+ initiative, a national clean cooking 
strategy and improve climate resilience of public investment projects. On public health 
emergency preparedness, the government will focus its efforts in making the World Health 
Organization’s (WHO) Public Health Emergency Operations Centre (PHEOC) framework fully 
operational. Furthermore, the government will approve the National Plan for Health Sector 
Adaptation to Climate Change to minimize the effects of extreme weather events on health 
systems and increase investment in adaptation and resilience of health facilities. 


REPUBLIC OF MOZAMBIQUE 
96 
INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND 
63. 
The Mozambican government can count on a series of tailored evaluation reports to 
inform its response towards public health emergencies. The government will integrate key 
findings and recommendations from the World Bank’s CCDR report in the sphere of climate policy, 
and from the WHO’s Joint External Evaluation of International Health Regulation Core Capacities and 
National Plan for Health Security when designing its actions for public health emergencies. To this 
extent, six priority reform pillars were identified, namely: (i) enhance climate finance mobilization; (ii) 
enable climate change in PFM; (iii) encourage development of climate change statistics; (iv) promote 
use of renewable sources of energy; (v) strengthen adaptation capacity; and (vi) improve 
preparedness and response to public health emergencies. 
H. Improving Economic Statistics 
64. 
The government is implementing improvements to national accounts statistics. The 
government is on track to produce quarterly national accounts (QNA) by expenditure. An evaluation 
of available data sources for current and constant price estimates was concluded in 2022. The 
government aims to publish QNA series by expenditure at current and constant prices, from 2017 to 
present, by end-August 2024. For the same release, the government is also in the process of rebasing 
the QNA to base year 2019. Annual national accounts have been rebased to 2019 in mid-2023. The 
government will also prepare and release methodological notes underpinning the QNA by end-
August 2024.  The government has resumed publishing economic activity indicators, such as monthly 
industrial production and quarterly economic climate indicators in timely fashion (data is being 
published with no more than a two-month lag). Furthermore, after an extension of the CPI coverage 
for 8 cities in 2022, it was rebased in February to reflect the 2022 Household Budget Survey. 
65. 
The government is reconciling its monetary and fiscal accounts. This will improve the 
identification of fungible deposits available to finance the budget of the central government and 
improve the elaboration of fiscal projections and plans. The government is reconciling government 
deposits as reported by the BdM and the MEF, based on TA recommendations from the IMF 
Statistics department. The BdM and the MEF will implement a formal process of reconciling flows 
and stocks regularly and explain the differences that are identified.  
I. Program Design, Financing and Monitoring 
66. 
The ultimate responsibility of program monitoring and coordination within 
Mozambique will rest with MEF and BdM. To ensure coordinated implementation of the program, 
the MEF and BdM will consult with the other public institutions involved in meeting program 
objectives to track progress on various targets and reforms under the program. Similarly, the MEF 
will provide oversight responsibility for ensuring that public spending is compliant with budget 
limits.  
67. 
The program will be monitored by the IMF Executive Board. Assessment will be through 
bi-annual performance criteria (end-June and end-December), continuous performance criteria, 
indicative targets, and a Monetary Policy Consultation Clause (MPCC) for end-March 2024, end-June 
2024, end-September 2024, end-December 2024 end-March 2025 and end-June 2025, as presented 
in Table 2. To monitor progress on the structural reforms previously described, structural 


REPUBLIC OF MOZAMBIQUE 
INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND 97 
benchmarks are presented in Table 1. Detailed definitions and reporting requirements for all 
performance criteria, indicative targets, and the MPCC are presented in the Technical Memorandum 
of Understanding (TMU) attached to this letter, which also defines the scope and frequency of data 
to be reported for program monitoring purposes and presents the projected assumptions that form 
the basis for some of the performance assessments. The Fifth and Sixth reviews are expected to take 
place on or after September 15, 2024 and March 15, 2025. To this end, the government plans to: 
i. 
Refrain from extending new guarantees or entering into new external borrowing contracts 
at non-concessional rates. Debt contracted through ENH related to already identified LNG 
development projects, integral to the authorities’ development program—for which 
concessional financing is not available—would be added to the borrowing plan and as 
exceptions to the zero non-concessional debt limit in amounts consistent with meeting the 
debt reduction objectives of the program, when details of the loan terms become available. 
ii. 
Adhere to the quantitative performance criteria (QPC) on the floor on the domestic primary 
budget balance, the ceiling on new non-concessional external debt contracted or 
guaranteed by the public sector (continuous criterion), the floor on the stock of net 
international reserves of the BdM, and the zero ceiling on the accumulation of new public 
and publicly guaranteed external payment arrears (continuous criterion).  
iii. 
To help safeguard social spending, adhere to the QPC on the floor on social spending floor 
to be monitored starting June 2024.  
iv. 
To arrest the accumulation of additional domestic arrears and ensure efficient cash 
management, adhere to the newly introduced IT on the ceiling of the stock of domestic 
arrears. 
v. 
Adhere to the indicative targets (IT) on the ceiling on the present value of new external 
debt, the ceiling on domestic debt stock, and the floor on social spending. 
vi. 
The government will prepare an external borrowing plan to facilitate assessment of the 
QPCs and ITs on external debt. 
vii. 
In line with the transition towards inflation targeting, monetary policy aims to achieve 
an annual headline inflation rate centered on the program objective of 5.0 percent with 
a symmetric band of ±3 percent around the objective at end-June 2024, end-September 
2024, end-December 2024, end-March 2025 and end-June 2025. If inflation goes beyond 
the specified bands at the program test dates, the government will complete a consultation 
with the IMF Executive Board analyzing the reasons for the breach, policies undertaken to 
prevent it, and corrective actions that the Bank of Mozambique plans to undertake. 
viii. 
Not introduce or intensify restrictions on payments and transfers for current international 
transactions, introduce multiple currency practices, enter into bilateral payment agreements 
that are inconsistent with Article VIII of the IMF Articles of Agreement, or introduce or 
intensify import restrictions for balance of payments purposes; and 


REPUBLIC OF MOZAMBIQUE 
98 
INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND 
ix. 
Adopt any new financial or structural measures that may be necessary for the success of its 
policies, in consultation with the IMF. 
68. 
The government estimates that the financing needs for the 2024-2025 program will be 
covered. It currently expects budget supports of $150 million from World Bank and $20 million from 
African Development Bank. 
69. 
The government believes the policies specified in this MEFP provide a foundation for 
sustaining growth, maintaining low inflation, and alleviating poverty, and stands ready to take 
additional measures if required. The government will provide IMF staff with the information 
needed to assess progress in implementing our program as specified in the TMU and will consult 
with Fund staff on any measures that may be appropriate at the initiative of the government or 
whenever the Fund requests a consultation. The government intends to make this letter and the TMU 
available to the public. In this context, it authorizes the IMF to arrange for them to be posted on the 
IMF website, subsequent to Executive Board approval. 
70. 
Accordingly, the government is requesting Board approval of the policies set forth in 
the MEFP, and disbursement of the fifth loan installment, totaling SDR 45.44 million, out of 
a total three-year arrangement of SDR 340.8 million.

Attachment II. Technical Memorandum of Understanding 
June 21, 2024 
 
1. 
This Technical Memorandum of Understanding (TMU) spells out the concepts, 
definitions, and data reporting procedures mentioned in the Letter of Intent (LOI) and 
Memorandum on Economic and Financial Policies (MEFP). It describes the information 
requirements to monitor performance under the ECF-supported program. The authorities will consult 
with the IMF before modifying measures contained in this TMU or adopting new measures that 
would deviate from the goals of the program.  
A.   Quantitative Performance Criteria (QPC) and Indicative Targets (IT) 
2. 
The quantitative performance criteria listed below are those specified in Table 2 of the 
MEFP. Definitions and adjusters (to take into account factors or changes beyond the control of the 
Government) for each criterion are specificized in the subsequent sections (B, C, D, E, and F). 
Continuous Quantitative Performance Criteria require that at no point in time will the ceiling be 
breached. Unless stated otherwise, all quantitative performance criteria will be assessed cumulatively 
from the beginning of the calendar year to the applicable test-dates specified in Table 2 of the MEFP. 
The quantitative performance criteria are as follows: 
• 
Floor on domestic primary budget balance (section B).  
• 
Floor on social spending starting end-June 2024 (section C). 
• 
Floor on the stock of Net International Reserves (NIR) of the Bank of Mozambique (BM) 
(section D).  
• 
A zero ceiling on the accumulation of new public and publicly guaranteed external payment 
arrears. (Section E).  
• 
Ceiling on new non-concessional external debt contracted or guaranteed by the public sector 
(section F). 
3. 
The indicative targets listed below are those specified in Table 2 of the MEFP. 
Definitions and adjusters for each indicative target are specificized in the subsequent sections (G, H, I 
and J). Unless stated otherwise, all indicative targets will be assessed cumulatively from the 
beginning of the calendar year to the applicable test-dates specified in Table 2 of the MEFP. The 
indicative targets are as follows: 
• 
Ceiling on the present value of new external debt (section G). 
• 
Ceiling on domestic debt (section H). 
• 
Floor on social spending until end-March 2024 (section I).

102 INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND 
• 
Ceiling on the stock of domestic arrears (section J). 
B.   QPC on the Floor on Domestic Primary Budget Balance 
Definition 
4. 
The domestic primary balance is defined as the difference between total government 
non-liquified natural gas (LNG) revenue (minus grants) and domestic primary expenditure. 
The above items are defined as follows: 
 
• 
Unless otherwise indicated, the term Government refers to the central government of the 
Republic of Mozambique comprising all the national executive, legislative and judicial bodies 
at the central level and central government’s representatives at the local level and all budget 
and extrabudgetary public entities such as institutes, funds and agencies whose competence 
are included in the definition of central government as defined in the Government Finance 
Statistics Manual of 2014 (GFSM 2014), paragraphs 2.85 – 2.89.  
• 
Total government revenue is the sum of tax revenue and non-tax revenue (as defined in 
GFSM 2014, Chapter 5) and is recorded on a cash basis. Liquified Natural Gas (LNG) revenue 
and exceptional receipts as defined below, will be shown in the breakdown of total 
government revenue. For program purposes, LNG revenue will be excluded from total 
government revenue and therefore are not part of calculation of domestic primary balance 
reported in the quantitative performance criteria in Table 2 of the MEFP. This will take effect 
once the Sovereign Wealth Fund Law is approved by Parliament, as it defines the percentage 
of LNG revenue to be transferred to the Treasury Single Account and to be used to finance 
the budget; currently projected by June 2024. 
• 
Tax revenue. Tax revenues are the sum of revenues from taxes and levies on (i) income, 
profits and capital gains, (ii) salaries and labor, (iii) assets, (iv) taxes on goods and services, 
(v) foreign trade and international transactions, and other tax revenues. They correspond to 
“receitas fiscais”, as reported in the Mapa Fiscal. 
• 
LNG revenues.  For the purpose of this TMU, LNG revenues are defined as all revenues from 
the LNG sector, including royalties, profit share, CIT, dividends from state’s participations and 
all other LNG-related tax or revenues. 
• 
Grants. Grants are defined in paragraph 5.101 of the GFSM 2014. For the purpose of this 
TMU, grants consist of project grants and budget grants. 
• 
Total government expenditure is understood to be the sum of expenditure on wages and 
salaries of government employees on a gross basis, goods and services, transfers (including 
subsidies, grants, social benefits, and other expenses), other current outlays, interest 
payments, and capital expenditure. All these categories are recorded on a commitment basis, 
unless otherwise indicated. Spending items are defined as in GFSM 2014 (Chapter 6). 


REPUBLIC OF MOZAMBIQUE 
INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND 103 
• 
Primary expenditure is understood as total government expenditure as defined above 
minus interest payments, plus domestically financed net lending. 
• 
Domestic primary expenditure is understood as primary expenditure minus externally 
financed capital expenditure, and excludes any one-off tax and non-tax revenues, and one-
off capital transfers related to the settlement of disputed liability (see TMU ¶5, last 
bullet).  
• 
Exceptional receipts are defined as all resources that come from (i) the sale or placement or 
privatization of Government’s assets, (ii) taxation on contracts, (iii) granting or renewal of 
licenses, (iv) resolution of disputes between foreign companies operating in Mozambique 
and the Government in connection with their tax obligations or potential violations to laws 
and standards or any other legal obligations, and any other exceptional receipts.  
Adjusters to Domestic Primary Balance 
5. 
The following adjustors will apply to the target on the domestic primary balance. 
• 
If the budget grants or loans are larger than the programmed amount, or in the event of 
exceptional receipts (according to Article 4 of the 2022 budget law, the government may use 
exceptional resources for investment and emergency spending and debt reduction), the floor 
for the domestic primary balance can be adjusted downward by 75 percent of the excess 
amount in 2022, 60 percent of the excess amount in 2023, and 50 percent of the excess 
amount in 2024. For the purpose of the TMU, baseline budget grants and budget loans are 
shown in the Text Table 1.  
• 
In the event of a natural disaster, the floor for the domestic primary balance can be adjusted 
downward by up to MTS 3.7 billion drawling on the capital gains Treasury account (“Mais 
valías”) at the Central Bank. 
• 
If the authorities sign an agreement to settle the disputed liability, as part of court or arbitral 
decisions or as part of out of court settlements with respect to government guarantees on 
existing external debt in dispute as of Dec 31, 2022, that result in more favorable terms to the 
guarantor than those of the initial debt, the floor for the domestic primary balance will be 
adjusted downward or upward by the deviation of the amount to be settled immediately 
from the baseline (in the same year of signature of the agreement) and recorded as a state-
owned enterprise transfer, per the terms of the signed agreement. Please see Text Table 2 
presenting projections of the out-of-court settlement.

C.   QPC on the Floor on Social Spending   
Definition 
6. 
For the purpose of this TMU, social spending is defined as transfers to INAS1 from the 
budget (through the treasury single account, i.e., not including transfers to INAS through 
project grants or project loans from external partners). The QPC is on the execution on budget 
spending (rather than allocation) presented in Text Table 3. This QPC on the floor on social spending 
has been modified from an IT to a QPC starting end-June 2024 and going forward.

Should expenditure compression be needed, social spending would be adjusted to the extent 
that it is reduced proportionally less than other domestically financed primary spending such 
that its ratio increases compared to the previous year.  
D.   QPC on the Floor on the Stock of NIR of the BM 
Definition 
8. 
Net international reserves (NIR) of the Bank of Mozambique (BM) are defined, 
consistent with the definition of the Template on International Reserves and Foreign Currency, 
as external assets readily available to, or controlled by, the BM net of its external liabilities. Pledged 
or otherwise encumbered reserve assets (including swaps) are excluded; such assets include, but are 
not limited to, reserve assets used as collateral or guarantee for third party external liabilities. 
Reserve assets corresponding to undisbursed project accounts are also considered encumbered 
assets and are excluded from the measurement of NFA for program purposes. External liabilities 
include, inter alia, use of IMF resources. 
Calculation of NIR 
9. 
The stock of net official international reserves (NIR) of the BM will be calculated as the 
difference between total gross official international reserves and official short-term reserve 
liabilities. 
• 
Gross official international reserves are defined as the sum of: 
• 
The BM’s holdings of monetary gold (excluding amounts pledged as collateral);  
• 
Holdings of Special Drawing Rights (SDRs);  
• 
BM holdings of convertible currencies in cash or in nonresident financial institutions 
(deposits, securities, or other financial instruments); and  
• 
Mozambique’s reserve tranche position with the IMF. 
• 
Gross official usable international reserves exclude:  
• 
Pledged, swapped, or any encumbered reserve assets, including but not limited to reserve 
assets used as collateral or guarantees for third-party external liabilities (assets not readily 
available);  
• 
Precious metals other than gold, assets in nonconvertible currencies and illiquid foreign 
assets.  
• 
Gross official reserve liabilities are defined as:  
• 
The total outstanding liabilities of the BM to the IMF, excluding the SDR allocations;  


REPUBLIC OF MOZAMBIQUE 
106 INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND 
• 
Convertible currency liabilities of the BM to nonresidents with an original maturity of up to 
and including one year; and  
• 
Commitments to sell foreign exchange arising from derivatives (such as futures, forwards, 
swaps, and options) 
Adjustor to NIR Floor 
The QPC (floors) for net international reserves (NIR) will be adjusted: 
• 
Downward by any shortfall in budget grants and loans relative to the program baseline 
excluding the IMF's budget support. 
• 
Downward to accommodate higher external outlays linked to relief from natural disasters. 
• 
Upward for any implicit or explicit reimbursement of past public or publicly guaranteed debt 
service as a result of refinancing of obligations, such as those related to MAM or Proindicus. 
• 
If the amount disbursed through project loans and grants and channeled through the Bank 
of Mozambique’s FX reserves is higher/lower in U.S. dollar terms than assumed under the 
program—as set out in Text Table 4—the floor on the program NIR will be adjusted 
upward/downward by the cumulative differences on the test date. These adjustors will apply 
to the NIR floor for end-December 2024 and thereafter.

E.   QPC on a Zero Ceiling on the Accumulation of New Public and Publicly 
Guaranteed External Payment Arrears  
Definition 
11. 
Definition and coverage of public and publicly-guaranteed external debt is provided in 
section F.  
12. 
External payment arrears are defined as the difference between the amounts required 
to be paid under the contract or legal document and the amount actually paid after the payment 
deadline, including any grace period, specified in the pertinent contract.  
13. 
The government’s external payment arrears include all external debt service 
obligations (principal and interest) matured and unpaid deriving from loans arranged or 
guaranteed by the central government, penalties, and interest charges deriving from these 
loans not paid at maturity. For performance criteria requirements, external debt service obligations 
will be considered “program” arrears, if contractually due payments remain outstanding beyond 
30 days or the contractually set grace period after the due date, whichever is longer. The definition 
excludes arrears relating to debt subject to renegotiation (dispute or ongoing renegotiation) or 
rescheduling. External debt is defined on a currency basis. 
14. 
The performance criterion on the public and publicly-guaranteed external payment 
arrears is defined as a cumulative flow in gross terms from May 9, 2022 and applies on 
a continuous basis. 
F.   QPC on the Ceiling on New Non-Concessional External Debt Contracted 
or Guaranteed by the Public Sector 
Definition of Debt Ceiling  
15. 
A performance criterion (ceiling) applies to the present value (PV) of new external non-
concessional debt contracted or guaranteed by the public sector. The ceiling applies also to debt 
contracted or guaranteed for which value has not yet been received. Operations that resolve arrears 
to Angola, Bulgaria, Iraq, Libya, and Poland and result in reduction in outstanding stock of debt are 
excluded from the ceiling. Court or arbitral decisions and related debt operations with respect to 
government guarantees on existing external debt in dispute as of Dec 31, 2022, that result in more 
favorable terms to the guarantor than those of the initial debt, will be excluded from the ceiling.2 
Debt operations that restructure existing loans and that result in a reduction of the present value 
 
2 The latter is a change from the time of program approval. 


REPUBLIC OF MOZAMBIQUE 
108 INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND 
(present value savings) compared with the initial debt and/or an improvement of the overall public 
external debt service profile will be excluded from the ceiling. In the calculation of the present value 
savings for these debt operations, the discounted future stream of payments of debt service due on 
the newly issued debt instrument (including all costs associated with the operation) will be compared 
with the discounted future stream of debt service due on the instrument it replaces using a discount 
rate of 5 percent and these amounts will not be capped by the nominal value of the debt. The 
company Hidroeléctrica de Cahora Bassa (HCB) is excluded from this criterion. HCB meets the criteria 
for exclusion set out in the 2017 Staff Guidance Note on the Debt Sustainability Framework for LICs 
(Appendix III) because it is run on commercial terms, has good financial performance, enjoys 
managerial independence, and borrows without government guarantee. 
Definition of Debt 
16. 
For program purposes, the definition of debt is set out in the Guidelines on Public Debt 
Conditionality in IMF Arrangements and Executive Board Decision No.16919-(20/103), 
adopted October 28, 2020. 
17. 
The term “debt”3 is understood to mean a current, that is, not contingent, liability, 
created under a contractual arrangement through the provision of value in the form of assets 
(including currency) or services, and which requires the obligor to make one or more payments in the 
form of assets (including currency) or services, at some future point(s) in time; these payments will 
discharge the principal and/or interest liabilities incurred under the contract. Debt can take several 
forms; the primary ones being as follows:  
i. 
loans, that is, advances of money to the obligor by the lender made on the basis of an 
undertaking that the obligor will repay the funds in the future (including deposits, bonds, 
debentures, commercial loans, and buyers’ credits) and temporary exchange of assets that 
are equivalent to fully collateralized loans, under which the obligor is required to repay the 
loan funds, and usually pay interest, by repurchasing the collateral from the buyer in the 
future (such as repurchase agreements and official swap arrangements);  
ii. 
suppliers’ credits, that is, contracts where the supplier permits the obligor to defer payments 
until sometime after the date on which the goods are delivered or services are provided; and  
iii. 
lease agreements (classified as debt until 2021 and then reclassified as goods and services 
from 2022, based on the Guidelines on Public Debt Conditionality in IMF-Supported 
Programs), that is, arrangements under which the lessee is allowed to use a property for a 
duration usually shorter than that of the life of the property in question, but without transfer 
of ownership, while the lessor retains the title to the property. For the purposes of this 
guideline, the debt is the present value (at the inception of the lease) of all the lease 
payments expected for the period of the agreement, except payments necessary for the 
operation, repair, and maintenance of the property. 
 
3 Guidelines on Public Debt Conditionality in IMF-Supported Programs. 


REPUBLIC OF MOZAMBIQUE 
INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND 109 
18. 
In accordance with the definition of debt set out above, arrears, penalties and judicially 
awarded damages arising from failure to pay under a contractual obligation that constitutes 
debt are also debt. Failure to make payment on an obligation that is not considered debt under this 
definition (e.g., payment on delivery) will not give rise to debt. 
Coverage of Debt  
19. 
For the purposes of this debt limit ceiling, public sector debt covers public and publicly 
guaranteed debt. The public sector comprises the central government, the central bank, and 
Empresa Nacional de Hidrocarbonetos (ENH). The government’s control of an entity will be assessed 
according to the methodology defined in GFSM 2014, Chapter 2. 
20. 
For program purposes, a ‘guaranteed debt’ is an explicit promise by the public sector 
to pay or service a third-party obligation (involving payments in cash or in kind). 
• 
Public sector external debt includes foreign-currency denominated obligations of the 
National Government of Mozambique, and foreign-currency denominated obligations of the 
Central Bank of Mozambique contracted on behalf of the national government (excluding 
newly contracted financing from the IMF and the General SDR allocation).  
• 
The definition of debt is presented in the above sub-section, with the exception noted in the 
previous bullet. 
Contracting of Debt and Treatment of Credit Lines  
21. 
For program purposes, a debt is considered to be contracted when all conditions for its 
entry into effect have been met, including approval by the Council of Ministers. Contracting of 
credit lines (which can be drawn at any time and entered into effect) with no predetermined 
disbursement schedules or with multiple disbursements will be also considered as contracting of 
debt. 
Present Value Calculation and Concessionality 
22. 
For the purposes of the ceiling on the contracting or guaranteeing of new external 
non-concessional debt, a debt is concessional if it includes a grant element of at least 
35 percent, calculated as follows: the grant element of a debt is the difference between the present 
value (PV) of debt and its nominal value, expressed as a percentage of the nominal value of the debt. 
The PV of debt at the time of its contracting is calculated by discounting the future stream of 
payments of debt service due on this debt.4 For debts with a grant element equal or below zero, the 
PV will be set equal to the nominal value of the debt. The discount rate used for this purpose is the 
unified discount rate of 5 percent set forth in Executive Board Decision No. 15248-(13/97).  
 
4 The calculation of concessionality takes into account all aspects of the debt agreement, including maturity, grace 
period, payment schedule, upfront commissions, and management fees. 


REPUBLIC OF MOZAMBIQUE 
110 INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND 
23. 
The grant element of external debts in currencies other than the U.S. dollar will be 
calculated in U.S. dollar terms at program exchange rates. For any debt carrying a variable 
interest rate in the form of a benchmark interest rate plus a fixed spread, the PV of the debt would 
be calculated using a program reference rate plus the fixed spread (in basis points) specified in the 
debt contract. The program reference rate for the six-month USD SOFR is 1.52 percent and will 
remain fixed for the duration of the program. The spread of six-month Euro EURIBOR over six-month 
USD SOFR is -200 basis points. The spread of six-month JPY OIS over six-month USD SOFR is -150 
points. The spread of six-month GBP SONIA over six-month USD SOFR is -100 basis point. For 
interest rates on currencies other than Euro, JPY, and GBP, the spread over six-month USD SOFR is -
100 basis points. Where the variable rate is linked to a benchmark interest rate other than the six-
month USD SOFR, a spread reflecting the difference between the benchmark rate and the six-month 
USD SOFR (rounded to the nearest 50 basis points) will be added. 
External Debt 
24. 
For the purposes of the ceiling on the contracting or guaranteeing of new external 
debt, external debt is any debt contracted or guaranteed by the public sector on non-
concessional terms denominated in foreign currency, i.e., currency other than the Metical. 
External debts in currencies other than the U.S. dollar will be converted in U.S. dollars at program 
exchange rates (Text Table 3). 
G.   IT on the Present Value of New External Debt 
25. 
An indicative target (ceiling) applies to the PV of new external debt contracted or 
guaranteed by the public sector, as defined in paragraphs 15. The ceiling applies also to debt 
contracted or guaranteed for which value has not yet been received. Operations that resolve arrears 
to Angola, Bulgaria, Iraq, Libya, and Poland and result in reduction in outstanding stock of debt are 
excluded from the ceiling. Court or arbitral decisions and related debt operations with respect to 
government guarantees on existing external debt in dispute as of Dec 31, 2022, that result in more 
favorable terms to the guarantor than those of the initial debt, will be excluded from the ceiling. 
Debt operations that restructure existing loans and that result in a reduction of the present value 
(present value savings) compared with the initial debt and/or an improvement of the overall public 
external debt service profile will be excluded from the ceiling. In the calculation of the present value 
savings for these debt operations, the discounted future stream of payments of debt service due on 
the newly issued debt instrument (including all costs associated with the operation) will be compared 
with the discounted future stream of debt service due on the instrument it replaces using a discount 
rate of 5 percent and these amounts will not be capped by the nominal value of the debt.

H.   IT on the Ceiling on Domestic Debt 
Definition 
26. 
For the purpose of this TMU, domestic debt is defined as provided in Mapa da Divida, 
covering T-bills, T-bonds, loans from the Bank of Mozambique excluding onlending from the 
additional SDR allocation received in August 2021 (MT 20.5 billion), and “Other” (“Outros”). 
27. 
The indicative target (ceiling) applies to the nominal value of domestic debt by the 
central government denominated in metical. Newly issued domestic debt as part of debt 
operations related to court or arbitral decisions or as part of out of court settlements concerning 
government guarantee on existing external debt in dispute as of December 31, 2022, that result in 
more favorable terms to the guarantor than those of the initial debt, will be excluded from the 
ceiling, if it affects the domestic primary balance. Data on domestic debt will be reported and 
communicated to the IMF in the “Mapa de divida interna” prepared by the MEF and in the weekly 
and monthly data received from the BM. 
Adjustors to the IT Domestic Debt 
28. 
The following adjustors will apply to the target on domestic debt: 
• 
If the budget grants or loans are lower than the programmed amount, the ceiling on the 
stock of domestic debt will be adjusted upward by the amount of the shortfall. For the 
purpose of the TMU, baseline budget grants and budget loans are shown in the Text Table 1. 
• 
The ceiling on the stock of domestic debt will be adjusted upwards by the amount of  
MT 35 billion of securitized VAT arrears to be repaid by the Treasury. 
I.   IT on the Floor on Social Spending 
Definition 
29. 
For the purpose of this TMU, social spending is defined as transfers to INAS from the 
budget (through the treasury single account, i.e., not including transfers to INAS through 
project grants or project loans from external partners). The IT is on the execution on budget 
spending (rather than allocation) presented in Text Table 6 and up to end-March 2024, after which 
the IT is modified to a QPC starting end-June 2024 and going forward.

Adjustors to the IT on Social Spending 
30. 
The following adjustor will apply to the indicative target on social spending. 
• 
Should expenditure compression be needed, social spending would be adjusted to the extent 
that it is reduced proportionally less than other domestically financed primary spending such 
that its ratio increases compared to the previous year.  
J.   IT on the Stock of Domestic Arrears  
31. 
Domestic arrears are defined as the sum of expenditure arrears. A ceiling applies to the 
stock of domestic arrears by the government measured cumulatively from the beginning of the fiscal 
year in January. An unpaid bill is defined as any verified outstanding payment for more than 30 days 
owed by any entity that forms part of the central government votes for the following: utilities, rent, 
employee costs, other recurrent, court awards, compensation, contributions to international 
organizations, development, taxes, and other deductions. For construction work an unpaid bill is 
defined as any verified outstanding payment for more than 90 days owed by any entity that forms 
part of the central government. Expenditure arrears are the total stock of unpaid bills at the end of 
each quarter as verified by the Inspector General of Finances (IGF). 
K.   Monetary Policy Consultation Clause (MPCC)  
32. 
The authorities will complete a consultation with the Executive Board which would 
focus on: (i) the stance of monetary policy and whether the Fund-supported program remains on 
track; (ii) the reasons for program deviation, taking into account compensating factors; and (iii) 
proposed remedial actions if deemed necessary, if the end-of-period year-on-year headline  inflation 
falls outside the ±3 percentage point range around the 5.0 percent mid-point target band value for 
end-June 2024, end-September 2024, end-December 2024, and end-March 2025.

As of February 4, 2015, the Post-Catastrophe Debt Relief Trust has been transformed to the 
Catastrophe Containment and Relief (CCR) Trust. 
 
Decision point - point at which the IMF and the World Bank determine whether a country qualifies 
for assistance under the HIPC Initiative and decide on the amount of assistance to be committed. 
Interim assistance - amount disbursed to a country during the period between decision and 
completion points, up to 20 percent annually and 60 percent in total of the assistance committed at 
the decision point (or 25 percent and 75 percent, respectively, in exceptional circumstances). 
Completion point - point at which a country receives the remaining balance of its assistance 
committed at the decision point, together with an additional disbursement of interest income as 
defined in footnote 2 above. The timing of the completion point is linked to the implementation of 
pre-agreed key structural reforms (i.e., floating completion point). 
 
 
 
A follow-up to the 2020 safeguards assessment of the Bank of Mozambique (BM) was 
conducted during the Article IV mission. The assessment found that the BM has continued to 
strengthen its safeguards framework since the last Article IV, including through regular publication 
of audited financial statements, review of internal controls in currency operations and review of the 
operational risk framework. Control over vault access is being improved in line with earlier TA 
recommendations. The BM has committed to submitting a draft for a revised organic law to 
parliament in 2025. 
Exchange Rate Arrangement: Mozambique has a de jure floating exchange rate arrangement and 
de facto stabilized since June 24, 2021. As a major conduit for foreign aid flows, the Bank of 
Mozambique (BM) is the main channel for foreign exchange into the market. The BM also intervenes 
on the market in connection with disorderly market conditions. In its foreign exchange buying and 
selling operations on the interbank foreign exchange market (MCI), the BM uses listings from 
commercial banks. Commercial banks may change their listings when required during the MCI’s 
operating hours. Mozambique is an Article VIII member and does not maintain exchange restrictions 
or multiple currency practices subject to Fund approval under Article VIII, Sections 2(a) and 3.  
Article IV Consultations: Mozambique is currently under a 24-month consultation cycle. The last 
Article IV Consultation was concluded on May 9, 2022.

STAFF REPORT FOR THE 2024 ARTICLE IV CONSULTATION, 
FOURTH REVIEW UNDER THE THREE-YEAR ARRANGEMENT 
UNDER THE EXTENDED CREDIT FACILITY, REQUESTS FOR 
MODIFICATIONS OF QUANTITATIVE PERFORMANCE 
CRITERIA, WAIVER OF NONOBSERVANCE OF QUANTITATIVE 
PERFORMANCE CRITERIA, AND FINANCING ASSURANCES 
REVIEW —DEBT SUSTAINABILITY ANALYSIS  
 
The debt sustainability assessment remains 
unchanged compared to the January 2024 DSA 
update and the July 2023 full DSA. The overall 
and external public debt are assessed at high 
risk of distress due to some indicators 
remaining above sustainability thresholds for 
several years under the baseline, and the 
vulnerability of debt to downside risks during this period.1 Public debt is assessed as sustainable in 
a forward-looking sense because a large share of projected future borrowing reflects the state’s 
participation in large LNG projects, which will be repaid directly from future LNG revenues (which 
are expected to be significant). Risks are tilted to the downside, reflecting vulnerability to natural 
disasters, risks of intensification of terrorist activity in the North, deepening geo-economic 
fragmentation, and fiscal pressures related to general elections in October 2024. On the upside, 
growth assumptions underlying the DSA are conservative, as they do not incorporate potential 
spillovers from LNG projects to the broader economy. In addition, external debt is mostly 
concessional, and debt contracted for LNG development will be entirely repaid from LNG revenue, 
once production starts. This DSA incorporates in the baseline the fiscal and debt implications of an 
out-of-court settlement of litigation related to the remaining part of Mozambique’s 2013-16 
disputed debt, which was concluded in June 2024. The settlement would not have material impact 
on the projected timing of reaching a “moderate” risk of overall debt distress.    
 
1 Similar to the January 2024 DSA update, Mozambique’s debt carrying capacity is assessed as “weak” based 
on a compositor indicator value of 2.62. This assessment is based on the World Economic Outlook, April 2024 
and the 2022 Country Policy and Institutional Assessment.

PUBLIC DEBT COVERAGE 
1. 
The coverage of public and publicly guaranteed debt is the same as presented in the 
January 2024 DSA (Text Table 1). The analysis covers external and domestic obligations of the 
central government, including on-lending to state-owned enterprises (SOEs). The authorities provide 
data on debt of SOEs and guarantees provided by the central government on debt contracted by 
SOEs. Most of SOE guarantees (in terms of amount) relate to the state energy company—Empresa 
Nacional de Hidrocarbonetos (ENH)—which is involved in the LNG exploitation. SOE domestic debt 
is included in the DSA, while non-ENH SOE direct external debt is included as a contingent liability. 
As in the January 2024 DSA, the contingent liabilities stress test includes contingencies linked to 
debt contracted by municipalities and non-ENH SOE external debt. The DSA update revises the 
assumed contingent liability down from around 4.9 percent of GDP to 1.5 percent of GDP, due to 
the authorities’ signed agreement with creditors holding the remainder of the Proindicus obligations 
and all of MAM obligations (Box 1). Domestic debt is denominated in local currency, and, for the 
purposes of the DSA, debt is assessed by currency, as data capturing the residency of creditors are 
not available. The contingent liabilities stress test assumes realization of contingencies linked to 
debt contracted by municipalities2 and non-ENH SOE external debt each at 1.5 percent of GDP.3 For 
these two contingencies, the contingency is estimated to be lower than the default amount for SOE 
debt based on available information in accordance with IMF policy and LIC DSF Guidance Note (Text 
Table 1).  
Box 1. Mozambique’s Debt Settlement of the 2013–14 Proindicus and MAM Loans 
Between 2013 and 2014, three state-owned enterprises (SOEs)—Ematum, MAM, and Proindicus—borrowed 
approximately $2.2 billion, about 12 percent of Mozambique’s GDP, from external creditors. These loans 
were arranged by Credit Suisse and VTB. The government, which disputed the legality of sovereign guarantees 
attached to these loans, had been engaged in several complex legal disputes in the UK related to 
these obligations. 
In an effort to strengthen governance and transparency, and settle costly litigation related to the SOE loans, 
the authorities reached an out-of-court agreement on part of the Proindicus debt in October 2023. The 
settlement covered about $522 million of the outstanding principal and entails a cash component ($46 million 
dollars) and issuance of domestic T-bonds (MZN 6.2 billion at 6-year maturity; equivalent to $96 million). The cash 
component was financed by a one-off fine collected by the government due to the cancellation of an LNG 
exploration project. The T-bonds issuance in 2023 was recorded in the DSA guided by the terms of the settlement; 
the amount was within the overall ceiling on domestic debt issuance under the 2023 budget law. 
In June 2024, the authorities reached an out-of-court settlement on the remainder of the outstanding debt ($648.3 
million principal, and $1.4 billion including interest due), which relates to the VTB components of the Proindicus 
loan ($113 million in principal) and the entirety of the MAM loan (about $535 million in principal). The settlement 
entails a cash payment of $220 million. The $220 million will be raised through the issuance of domestic T-bonds 
(MZN 14.2 billion); this amount is consistent with the ceiling on domestic debt T-bonds issuance under the 2024 
budget law (MT46.3 billion). The government will convert the domestic currency to US dollars by purchasing $220 
million from the central bank. 
 
2 Municipalities debt is not currently systematically collected by the authorities. Most of this debt is short-term, to 
address liquidity needs within the year, and municipalities are required to obtain authorization from the Minister of 
Finance before contracting longer-term debt. 
3 Direct external debt includes debt contracted by TMCel (telecom company), Petromoc (fuel importer), EMEM 
(mining company), EDM (electricity company) and BNI (Banco National de Investimento). Direct debt to SOEs 
included in the IGEPE database is included in the DSA.

BACKGROUND 
A.   Recent Debt Developments  
2. 
While domestic borrowing increased in 2023, robust nominal GDP growth helped 
reduce the total debt to GDP ratio.4 External public debt is estimated at 66.4 percent of GDP at 
end-2023, down from 72.1 percent of GDP at end-2022, explained by high nominal growth and 
modest decline in nominal external debt. ENH debt increased in 2023 compared to 2022 to reach 
$3.9 billion and is expected to increase further from 2024 once the LNG project resumes.5,6 Domestic 
debt is estimated to have remained as projected at about 27.5 percent of GDP in 2023. The share of 
short-term debt in the total domestic debt is about 13 percent, consistent with the Medium-term 
Debt Strategy (¶11). Public external debt is largely concessional, owed to multilaterals and bilateral 
donors (Table 2, Table 5). New external debt disbursements were provided by the World Bank and 
IMF in 2023, as well as project loans from Saudi Arabia. Overall, multilateral and bilateral debt 
decreased in percent of GDP. Mozambique does not have market access, and external commercial 
borrowing is precluded under the IMF-supported program.7 
 
4 The stock of debt reported in Text Table 2 is different from Mozambique’s 2023 Annual Debt Report as the report 
does not include ENH debt as part of the public debt stock.   
5 Similar to the previous DSA, the DSA includes government guaranteed debt to ENH of about US$2.1 billion until 
2028. 
6 The May 2022 DSA (at program request) included an alternative scenario showing that the trajectory of the external 
debt burden indicators would not be significantly affected by a situation where some of the LNG projects would not 
resume (Golfinho, Area 1, and Rovuma, Area 4), when the offshore Coral FLNG project would continue operation.

3. 
The DSA incorporates an agreement between the Mozambican authorities on the 
remainder of the government-guaranteed SOE debt that has been under dispute. The January 
2024 DSA treated the state guarantee of loans extended to SOEs and in legal dispute as a contingent 
liability, equivalent to 3.4 percent of GDP. In accordance with agreed methodology of the IMF-WB 
debt sustainability framework for low-income countries, these amounts were excluded from the 
baseline. The “undisclosed debts” are related to claims worth US$ 2.2 billion (principal and interest) 
contracted by Mozambican SOEs (Proindicus, Mozambique Asset Management (MAM) and 
EMATUM) between 2013 and 2014. The January 2024 DSA incorporated a US$143 million settlement 
payment on the Proindicus debt (Box 1). In June 2024, the authorities signed another agreement with 
creditors holding the remaining 18 percent of the total debt of Proindicus owed to VTBE and VTBC of 
US$113.3 and total debt for MAM owed to VTBC and BCP of $535 million. The June 2024 settlement 
covered a total of $648.3 million of the outstanding principal which was fully paid through a cash 
payment of $220 million. Though this settlement increases the present value of total public debt, the 
change is significantly smaller compared to a scenario where the disputed amount had not been 
settled under the agreed terms.  
4. 
Mozambique has reached agreements on some of its defaulted external loans and is 
actively seeking resolution of the remaining ones. The overall stock of external arrears on public 
and publicly guaranteed external debt service is estimated at US$1.2 billion at end-2023 (Text Table 
3). Mozambique incurred new short-term external debt service arrears in 2024: in January with India

($0.9 million), Korea ($0.1 million), and Nordea Bank ($0.9 million), and in February with the Arab 
Bank for Economic Development in Africa ($0.3 million). These arrears, which were incurred due to 
operational constraints related to debt management, have been settled fully. Mozambique has 
reached an agreement on an actualized amount for its arrears with Brazil in 2022, but a repayment 
plan is pending ratification by the Brazilian parliament.8 Pre-HIPC, non-Paris Club arrears have 
a representative agreement in place. Mozambique has been in contact with the authorities of the 
five countries with which it still holds pre-HIPC arrears. Mozambique has reached a reconciled 
amount and a repayment plan with Libya on its pre-HIPC loan, to which the Paris Club indicated a 
no objection, but the start of repayment is still pending. The authorities are also working to reach 
agreements on repayments of Pre-HIPC debt with Angola and Iraq.   
B.   Macroeconomic Forecasts 
5. 
A recovery is underway led by agriculture, services, and offshore LNG production 
(Coral platform). Growth accelerated from 2.4 percent in 2021 to 5.4 percent in 2023 led by 
acceleration across most sectors. Exports contracted somewhat in 2023 partly due to a closure of 
a tobacco factory, while LNG exports increased due to the expansion of LNG production in Coral 
South. Imports also contracted reflecting tight financial conditions, lower import prices and weaker 
megaproject-related imports. International reserves recovered in 2023, supported by the Bank of 
Mozambique’s (BM’s) discontinuation of the FX window to cover fuel import bills and the increase in 
the required reserve ratio for FX deposits from 11.5 percent to 28.5 percent in February and 
39.5 percent in June. The current account excluding “megaprojects” remained in structural deficit. 
A prudent fiscal consolidation effort in 2023 helped correct fiscal slippages observed in 2022, and 
deliver a primary surplus after grants of 0.2 percent of GDP. 
6. 
The onshore LNG project led by TotalEnergies is assumed to resume development in 
2024. Following terrorist attacks in 2021, TotalEnergies, the lead member of the consortium for Area 
1, suspended the LNG project. In view of the security improvement in the North, TotalEnergies 
conducted in May 2023 an assessment of the human rights situation and developed an action plan 
establishing a foundation for local socio-economic development. While they have not announced 
the official resumption of the development phase yet, it is expected during 2024, once project 
financing is assured. It is therefore assumed that exports for the TotalEnergies and ExxonMobil 
projects will commence in 2028 and 2030 respectively, a year later than in the previous DSA. 
Meanwhile, the ENI-led Coral FLNG project, which started production in end-2022, is assumed to 
have reached 70 percent of annual capacity in 2023, and almost full capacity in 2024. Government 
revenues will be small at first—under 0.1 percent of GDP in 2023—and are projected to reach 0.6 
percent of GDP in 2028 when the first onshore project starts production.9 First repayments for ENH’s 
equity debt for Area 4 exploration and development has started in 2023 from its Coral South cash 
flow share (see Box 2 for details).  
 
8 The MOU remains valid since it accounted for such potential delays. The reconciled amount, which is technically still 
in arrears as long as the MoU is not ratified, is below 1 percent of GDP. Brazil has consented to Fund financing 
notwithstanding these arrears. 
9 Government revenue streams from the first LNG project has started in the form of a royalty as well as a share of 
profit oil. Once the investing companies have recouped costs, they will also start paying corporate income tax.

Text Table 3. Mozambique: Evolution of the Stock of External Arrears 
(Millions of U.S. dollars)1   
Note: Most external arrears (disputed loans and pre-HIPCs) can be deemed away under LIC DSF, 
allowing total arrears to remain below 1 percent of 2023 GDP. 
7. 
The medium-term growth outlook is positive. Growth is estimated to have strengthened 
to 5.4 percent in 2023, mostly due to LNG. Long-term non-LNG growth is projected at 4 percent, 
assuming no positive spillovers from LNG to the rest of the economy, and substantially below 
growth rates observed prior to the “undisclosed debts” scandal in 2015. It is driven primarily by 
a large and growing contribution from services and a large, although shrinking, contribution from 
agriculture. The negative impact on growth from fiscal consolidation is expected to hold back non-
mining growth in the short term, but be compensated in the medium term by the gradual loosening 
of monetary policy. Overall growth is expected to accelerate sharply to reach 10 percent in 2028 and 
2029 as the first onshore project begins production. Inflation is projected to be lower than in the 
January 2024 DSA due to tighter-than-expected financial conditions. Amid tight domestic monetary 
policy, inflation is expected to remain near current levels over the short term, before accelerating 
somewhat as the loosening cycle takes effect. 
8. 
Mozambique’s external position in 2023 was substantially weaker than the level 
implied by fundamentals and desirable policies. The non-megaproject current account deficit 
persisted in 2023, although it narrowed due to tight financial conditions and decline in import 
prices. The megaproject activities have been fully financed by FDI and other financial inflows, and 
the megaproject current account turned into positive in 2023 due to weak megaproject-related 
import. The medium-term current account is expected to show a large total deficit linked to the LNG 
investment projects, and related FDI inflows are projected to increase. The non-megaproject current 
account deficits are projected to remain large but improve gradually over the medium term, 
supported by improved production capacity, including in agriculture, and prudent fiscal policy.10

9. 
International reserves rebounded in 2023, and are projected to increase over the 
medium term. Gross international reserves recovered to 4.4 months of prospective non-
megaproject import by the end of 2023, supported by discontinuation of the FX window to cover 
fuel import bills and the increase in reserve requirements on commercial banks’ FX deposits from. 
Fiscal consolidation and an expected increase in LNG revenue should also reduce pressure on 
reserves over the medium term. 
10. 
Mozambique’s medium-
term debt strategy aims to increase 
the share of external debt (limiting 
new loans to concessional debt), 
and lengthen maturities on 
domestic debt.11 The World Bank 
provided a $300 million budget 
support grant in 2023, and is 
expected to provide an additional 
$150 million budget support grant in 
2024.  In addition, African 
Development Bank will provide $20 
million budget support grant in 2024. 
In 2024, the US Millennium Challenge 
Corporation is expected to disburse 
initial $50 million of $500 million 
project grants. The authorities have 
been carefully considering investment 
priorities and listed a pipeline of 
projects that would be signed in 2024, 
and the total amount envisaged in 
this pipeline will stay within the 
agreed external borrowing ceiling 
(Text Table 4).12 Disbursement of 
external project loans is projected to increase somewhat in 2024, including from the WB, after 
considering their disbursement schedule. Over the long term, Mozambique is projected to rely 
gradually less on external financing as LNG revenues start flowing in. 
11. 
External financing gaps are estimated at about 1.2 percent of GDP on average over the 
period 2024-25. The financing needs arise because of budget outlays. Compared to the January 
2024 DSA, spending pressures—mostly wage bill-related—have worsened the primary balance (Text 
Table 5). The authorities have used SDR 5.4 million of the SDR allocation of SDR 227.2 million as a 
complement to the IMF-supported program in 2023. The three-year arrangement under the 
 
11 Under the IMF ECF and the World Bank’s Sustainable Development Finance Policy, Mozambique has committed to 
zero non-concessional external borrowing. 
12 The projected weighted average grant element shown in Table 1 includes the sovereign guarantee commitments 
associated with the development phase of the LNG Golfinho project.

Extended Credit Facility of 150 percent quota (SDR 340.8 million) supports the authorities’ reform 
program, addresses near-term BOP needs and provides budget support.  
12. 
A cumulative improvement 
of the primary balance (after 
grants) of about 2 percent of GDP 
is projected between 2022 and 
2024 (Text Table 5). Fiscal 
consolidation effort is supported by 
wage bill restraint and enhanced 
domestic revenue mobilization.    
• 
Revenue performance and 
projections over the 
medium-term. While 
receipts from indirect taxes 
appear on track in 2023, VAT 
revenue has significantly 
underperformed compared 
to 2022, reflecting reduced 
VAT rate from 17 to 16 
percent, extension of VAT exemptions, and IT constraints limiting electronic VAT collections. 
Having said that, total revenues are projected to increase in 2024 compared to 2023 is 
accounted by the end of temporary VAT exemptions (on oil, soap, and sugar), higher income 
taxes, and measures to increase non-tax revenues, including higher concession fee on 
concession rate on profit making SOEs and permanent earmarked revenue from National 
Mining Institute, and higher dividend rate on spectrum auctions. In addition, the Ministerial 
Diploma (Regulation) on mining activities will ensure the reference price of mineral products 
is in line with international prices; this will help to gradually increase tax revenue over the 
medium-term. To improve tax compliance, the authorities have extended the 
implementation of the new e-tax system to all taxes and tax administration offices. Going 
forward, the expected resumption of LNG projects and positive spillovers from stronger 
economic activity in the North will help strengthen tax revenue.  
• 
Slower than expected wage bill consolidation. The public sector wage bill in 2024 is 
projected to be 0.3 percentage point of GDP lower than in 2023, underpinned by corrective 
measures to contain the wage bill. These corrective measures are guided by the wage bill 
action plan endorsed by the Minister of Finance in December 2023 (ECF-Third Review, Annex 
IV), the authorities froze base salaries in 2024-25 to contain wage bill spending. The 
authorities have committed to the following corrective measures to: (i) eliminate the risk 
allowance for all non-eligible employees; (ii) revise location allowance; (iii) eliminate ghost 
workers (5,000 employees)—a finding of the ongoing audit of public servants; (iv) remove 
from the payroll all employees who are receiving both wage and pension payments 
concurrently; (v) reduction of the seniority supplement by 50 percent across public sector 
employees (excluding magistrates and doctors) (MEFP, ¶23).. To guide medium-term wage

bill rationalization, the authorities have adopted an action plan to reduce the wage bill-to-
GDP ratio to 10 percent by 2028 which will inform the authorities’ Medium-Term Fiscal 
Scenario. Measures listed in the action plan include a nominal freeze on wages and a limit to 
new hires, implementation of the attrition rule, and an ongoing audit and proof of life of all 
public civil servants. Over the medium-term, expenditure on goods and services will remain 
at 3.5 percent of GDP and domestic capital spending will gradually increase to reach about 
3.5 percent of GDP, while external capital spending is projected to reach about 2.5 percent 
of GD, on average. Thus, Total capital expenditure is expected to reach about 6 percent of 
GDP in 2029 supported by higher domestically financed capital spending to compensate for 
declining externally financed capital spending over the medium term.  
• 
The cost of debt financing has been growing steadily and is projected to keep on 
increasing in the short term and gradually decline over the medium-term. Although the 
debt-to-GDP ratio has been on a downward path during 2021-23, interest payments sharply 
increased from 2.7 percent of GDP in 2021 to 3.7 percent of GDP in 2023 and are projected 
to reach a peak at 4.2 percent of GDP in 2024. This increase in the debt service burden is 
explained by the limited availability of concessional external debt financing that forced the 
central government to rely more heavily on expensive domestic financing to finance fiscal 
deficits. The share of domestic debt in total central government debt increased from 23.5 
percent in 2021 to about 27.5 percent in 2023. Consistent with the authorities MTDS (¶10), 
the share of domestic debt in total public debt will gradually decline to reach 20 percent of 
total public debt by 2029 supported by fiscal consolidation effort and projected LNG 
development.  
13. 
The Bank of Mozambique has begun cutting the policy rate, and further easing 
remains essential. While the first three cuts have signaled the beginning of a loosening cycle, the 
(ex post) real policy rate remains near 12 percent. At 3.7 percent, the official measure of core 
inflation stands below the center of the BM’s target band, with alternative measures for core 
inflation near 3 percent. Against this backdrop, the BM has ample scope to cut the policy rate 
further and reduce the high reserve requirements. The outlook for global commodity prices is 
uncertain and there are risks of election spending which could spill over to inflation. In this context, 
scope for further monetary policy loosening would be informed by market conditions and the fiscal 
position to normalize the balance between monetary and fiscal policies. In the meantime, high 
interest rates and crowding out from public spending constitute a hurdle to private sector-led 
development. 
14. 
The authorities have committed to implementing reforms to address structural 
weaknesses. The authorities have also committed to reforms under the IMF ECF arrangement, which 
helps reduce protracted BOP vulnerabilities through supporting structural reforms aimed at: 
(i) restraining current expenditure through wage bill control to create fiscal space for development 
and social spending; (ii) developing the policy and institutional framework for managing LNG 
resources; (iii) improving governance and transparency to help foster private development; (iv) 
increasing the efficiency of public resources management, including enhancing SOE transparency 
and oversight; and (v) enabling diversification and equitable growth through public investment in 
human capital and climate-resilient infrastructure.

15. 
Risks to the outlook are tilted to the downside. Previously identified risks, notably 
extreme climate events and a deterioration in the security situation in the North, are still pertinent. 
Despite recent military success, a deterioration of the security situation in the North cannot be ruled 
out, which would have significant humanitarian costs and could lead to further delays or 
abandonment of the LNG megaprojects led by TotalEnergies and ExxonMobil. Geo-economic 
fragmentation and its consequences could impact growth. In addition, there are potential 
contingent liability risks related to SOEs. Moreover, continued weakness in non-mining growth 
exacerbating poverty, financial stress from high real interest rates, and a slowdown in reforms as 
general elections get closer. Upside risks include the realization of LNG projects (in particular, the 
so-called “Coral North” project) that do not form part of the current baseline. 
16. 
The debt sustainability framework’s realism tools reflect the baseline assumptions 
(Figures 3 and 4). Projected variations in debt indicators are broadly similar to those observed over 
the past five year for external debt, but total public debt is unexpectedly higher. Growth projections 
in 2023 are much higher than those suggested by the alternative fiscal-growth multiplier analysis 
due to the expected effects of LNG. The adjustment in the primary balance in the baseline scenario 
is consistent with adjustments carried out in a sample of comparable LICs that requested Fund 
support since 1990, yet less than the January 2024 DSA. This is supported by the gradual policy 
adjustment to address wage bill overruns. Similar to the previous DSA, changes in private 
investment are driven almost exclusively by changes to LNG-related imports, and the further 
postponement of the Area 1 project. 
C.   Public Debt Related to LNG 
17. 
The DSA includes the value of the sovereign guarantee as well as the equity tranche of 
disbursed ENH debt. The value of the guarantee is assumed to increase gradually to reach its 
maximum value by the end of the development phase of the Golfinho project. The State guarantee 
would be triggered for this amount if ENH is not able to repay. If the project resumes, the value 
covered by the guarantee would rise in tandem with actual disbursements, up to the US$2.25 billion 
ceiling, until full cancellation upon commencement of LNG production (See Box 1 for further details 
on the structure of the LNG debt contracts). 
 
 


REPUBLIC OF MOZAMBIQUE 
INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

Box 2. LNG-Related Debt Structure 
ENH is a partner in the LNG projects led by TotalEnergies (Area 1, Golfinho) and ENI (Area 4, Coral), 
holding shares of 15 and 10 percent, respectively. A third project led by ExxonMobil (Area 4, Rovuma) has been 
considered but has not reached Final Investment Decision yet. This means that debt contracted for exploration of 
Area 4 will initially be repaid through revenues from the Coral offshore platform.  
It is worth noting that, at end-December 2022, ENH’s debt amounted to 18.8 percent of GDP of total PPG debt. 
IMF staff’s current understanding is that the debt and the contracts governing the State’s obligations have the 
following features:  
• 
ENH's shares are funded (or "carried") by the partner energy companies as project finance borrowing. The 
debt linked to the exploration phase is subject to interest, compounded annually, at the Secured Overnight 
Financing Rate (SOFR) plus 1 percent per annum until full repayment for the Coral and Golfinho projects. The 
debt linked to the development phase of Coral is subject to interest, compounded annually, at 8.7 percent per 
annum until fully repaid. For Golfinho, the interest rate is 9 percent from the date incurred until one year after 
the completion of the development phase. Thereafter, the interest rate is 13 percent until the amounts are 
repaid in full.  
• 
The contracts are structured such that ENH debt repayments will be taken directly from LNG revenues once 
they start. For Golfinho, 80 percent of ENH revenues (after deduction of operating costs) serves to pay the 
debt related to the exploration and development of the project, while for Coral this share is 90 percent. In 
both cases, 100 percent of revenues will be used to repay any remaining debt after 15 years, or when debt 
level reaches a pre-determined trigger point. These two projects have pre-sold a significant majority of the 
expected gas production in contracts with Asian customers and international energy companies. 
• 
A US$2.25 billion (15 percent of GDP) sovereign guarantee covers ENH's debt-financed share in the LNG 
megaprojects' financing package for Golfinho and lapses within about a year after the start of LNG 
production, currently expected in 2029. The full amount is gradually included in PPG debt, as project financing 
is disbursed. No other public guarantees are extant. 
The funding for the projects is issued through Special Investment Vehicles (SIVs) incorporated in United Arab 
Emirates and in Mozambique. 
Compared to the January 2024 DSA, main differences in modeling ENH debt dynamics and financing models 
under the current DSA relate to the following: 
• 
Medium-term exports and LNG-related revenues are somewhat stronger than assumed under the January 
2024 DSA, due to revised medium-term export prices and production capacity (see ¶19). 
• 
Revises ENH's shares (or "carry") funding assumptions, such that only ENH's equity-financed share of 
development costs is funded through the carry. ENH also shares in the external project debt (accounting for 
55-60 percent of financing, depending on the project).  
• 
Recognizes that the exploration carries (at a SOFR plus 1 percent ) are serviced before the development 
carries (at a higher interest rate 9 from the date incurred until one year after the completion of the 
development phase and 13 percent thereafter) for the Area1 and Area 4 Rovuma projects.

COUNTRY CLASSIFICATION 
18. 
As in the last DSA, debt 
carrying capacity is assessed as 
weak. Countries’ debt carrying 
capacity is measured through a 
composite index, equal to 2.62 for 
Mozambique (Text Table 6),13 similar 
to the previous DSA. The analysis that 
underpins the indicator considers the 
imports related to the large scale of 
LNG megaprojects under 
development (amounting to 
300 percent of GDP). If only non-
megaproject imports were considered 
in the calculation of the composite 
index, the debt carrying capacity 
would be assessed as medium, and 
relevant debt distress thresholds 
revised upward. Megaproject imports 
are fully financed through special 
investment vehicles with no potential 
bearing on international reserves 
(though they are included in the BoP 
statistics).  
 
 
DEBT SUSTAINABILITY 
A.   External Debt Sustainability Analysis 
19. 
Three external debt sustainability indicators have improved compared to the previous 
DSA and are below sustainability thresholds, even as the debt-to-GDP indicator rose (Table 1 
and Figure 1). Medium-term exports and LNG-related revenues are somewhat stronger than 
assumed under the January 2024 DSA, due to revised medium-term export prices and production 
capacity. TotalEnergies and ExxonMobil projects are expected to commence in 2028 and 2030 
respectively, a year later than in the previous DSA (¶6). Compared to the previous January 2024 DSA, 
debt solvency indicators have worsened whereas liquidity indicators have improved driven mainly by 
stronger medium-term exports and LNG-related revenues. Lower GDP growth projections have 
increased the PV of debt-to-GDP ratios, which are now projected to fall below the sustainability 
 
13 Debt carrying capacity is assessed to be weak with an index strictly below 2.69 for two years in a row, medium with 
an index between 2.69 and 3.05, and strong with an index strictly above 3.05.

13 
threshold from 2032 (instead of 2029 in the previous DSA). Similarly, the PV of debt-to-exports 
ratios have worsened, while remaining below the threshold for sustainability over projected period. 
On the other hand, debt service-to-exports and to-revenues are below their respective thresholds 
under the projection period, an improvement from the previous DSA, driven by higher exports and 
revenue projections which reflect updated LNG prices and production capacity and updated ENH 
financing assumptions, as presented in Box 2. 
• 
The PV of external public debt in terms of GDP is projected to be around 53 percent at end-
2024 and to remain above the sustainability threshold of 30 percent until 2032, 3 years later 
compared to the January 2024 DSA. This is partially driven by ENH borrowing to finance its 
participation in the LNG megaprojects, and the issuance of a sovereign guarantee covering 
ENH’s participation in Golfinho.  
• 
The PV of external public debt in terms of exports reaches a peak of 128 percent in 2026, 
compared to 116 percent for the same in the previous January 2024 DSA. Despite the 
increase, this indicator remains below the threshold of 140 percent throughout the 
projection period, as medium-term exports are somewhat stronger than assumed under the 
January 2024 DSA, due to revised medium-term export prices and production capacity.    
• 
External public debt service in terms of exports is at 9 percent in 2024, an improvement 
compared to the previous DSA, and remains below the threshold of 10 percent throughout 
the projection period, due to revised medium-term LNG exports projections compared to 
the January 2024 DSA.  
• 
External public debt service in terms of revenue is at 14 percent in 2024, an improvement 
compared to the previous DSA, and remains below the threshold of 14 percent throughout 
the projection period, as revenue projections improve markedly compared to the January 
204 DSA. 
20. 
External public debt ratios are most sensitive to changes in the primary balance, 
export shocks, other flows, and combined shocks (Figure 1, Table 3). All shocks lead to threshold 
breaches for all debt indicators due to the export and other flows and combined shocks. The 
primary balance shock leads to a threshold breach in all but the debt service-to-exports indicators. 
The stress tests illustrate that a nominal export growth (in U.S. dollars) one standard deviation below 
baseline in 2026-28 would increase the PV of external public debt-to-GDP by 32 percentage points 
above threshold, on average, (to reach a peak of 83, 80 and 74 percent in 2026, 2027, and 2028, 
respectively) compared to the baseline.14 Similarly, an export shock would push the PV of external 
public debt-to-exports above the sustainability threshold to reach a peak of 337 percent in 2026 
(compared to staying at 128 percent under the baseline). The export shock also pushes the debt 
service to export ratio (debt service to revenues) above the sustainability threshold from 2025 (2026) 
to 2034 (2033). Similarly, a combined shock to current transfers-to-GDP and FDI-to-GDP ratios 
 
14 This stress test does not reflect a plausible scenario as it implies that there would be no export revenue from LNG, 
despite still including all the debt created by the projects. However, should the project not go ahead for reasons 
outside of the control of the country, Mozambique would not be liable for the latter according to the LNG contracts. 


REPUBLIC OF MOZAMBIQUE 
14 
INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND 
keeps the PV of debt to GDP above the threshold until 2034 and raises the PV of debt to exports 
above the threshold over the period 2025-28. As in the previous DSA, a 30 percent nominal 
depreciation in 2024 would lead to an increase in the debt service-to-revenue ratio by an average of 
2 percentage points over 2024-26 compared to the baseline.15  
21. 
The realization of contingent liabilities or a natural disaster would significantly worsen 
the outlook for the solvency indicators. In this case, the PV of debt to GDP would be higher than 
the threshold through 2034, compared to the baseline return to sustainability in 2032. The 
realization of the contingent liabilities would bring the PV of external public debt in terms of exports 
above the baseline by an average of 15 percentage points over the projection period, and above the 
threshold in 2025-27. Similarly, a large disaster shock with an impact of 10 percent of GDP would 
significantly worsen debt sustainability, pushing back the return of the PV of external debt to GDP 
below the threshold beyond 2044, compared to the baseline (2032), and keeping the PV of external 
public debt in terms of exports above the threshold over 2025-27. 
B.   Public Sector Debt Sustainability Analysis 
22. 
Under the baseline, the indicator of public debt sustainability does not fall below the 
sustainability threshold until 2032, three years later than the January 2024 DSA. Total PPG 
debt is estimated at 93.9 percent of GDP at end-2023, with external debt accounting for about 66.4 
percent of GDP, a decrease compared to 2022, mostly due to limited external financing and strong 
nominal GDP growth. Due to the large financing needs associated with the recovery from the 
pandemic as well as the unexpected increase in the costs associated with the wage bill reform rolled 
out in 2022, the PV of debt-to-GDP is projected to reach below the 35 percent of GDP benchmark 
only in 2032, three years later than in the January 2024 DSA (by 2029) (Table 2 and Figure 2).  
23. 
Public debt sustainability indicators are highly sensitive to other flows, the primary 
balance, and exports (Table 4). A shock to the primary balance, which would also correspond to the 
baseline projection minus one standard deviation in 2026 and 2027, would lead the PV of debt-to-
GDP to reach a peak of 98 and 94 percent, respectively, (compared to 78 and 74 percent, 
respectively, under the baseline). Similarly, a shock to current transfers-to-GDP and FDI-to-GDP 
ratios during the same years would lead the PV of debt-to-GDP to reach a peak of 106 percent in 
2026, while a shock to exports would bring the ratio to 104 percent in 2026. Under realization of 
a commodity price shock, the PV of debt-to-GDP would increase the ratio above the threshold until 
2035, compared to 2032 under the baseline. 
RISK RATING AND VULNERABILITIES 
24. 
Mozambique’s debt is assessed to be at high risk of distress, yet sustainable in 
a forward-looking sense taking into account prospective LNG revenue and risk management 
of related debt. This assessment is unchanged from the DSA at program approval. The rating of 
“high risk of debt distress” is due to several indicators remaining above sustainability thresholds for 
 
15 Vulnerability to exchange rate movements is an expected outcome for a commodity exporter like Mozambique. 


REPUBLIC OF MOZAMBIQUE 
INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND 
15 
several years, and to the high vulnerability of debt to downside risks, including: (i) possible 
realization of contingent liabilities, (ii) unfavorable developments in the trade balance or exchange 
rate shocks, and (iii) difficulty in sustaining fiscal discipline especially in a context of climate shocks 
and upcoming elections. The path of the sustainability indicators is downward sloping and reaches 
the sustainability thresholds over the projection period. In addition, the following mitigating factors 
underpin the assessment: 
• 
Future borrowing and government guarantees largely reflect state participation in LNG 
developments. The State’s current exposure through the guarantee amounts to [0.2] percent 
GDP is included in the DSA and will rise only as projects resume. The DSA will include a 
gradually increase in PPG debt (up to 15 percent of GDP) over the period, since it is only 
activated in tandem with project finance disbursements. 
• 
Debt carrying capacity is likely to be stronger than signaled by the CI rating because 
international reserves do not need to cover imports related to megaprojects (which are fully 
funded through SIVs outside the country). The breaches the external debt sustainability 
indicator on the PV of debt to GDP ratio is judged to be narrower and less persistent than 
suggested by the standard methodology. Having a debt carrying capacity assessed as 
medium would imply that the PV of external debt to GDP would reach the sustainability 
threshold by 2029. 
• 
The assessment is based on a relatively conservative baseline for growth, which does not 
include positive spillovers from LNG to the wider economy.  
• 
Finally, besides the debt linked to LNG projects, external debt is mostly composed of 
concessional multilateral and bilateral debt, and a Eurobond, product of restructuring a debt 
linked to the “undisclosed debts”.  
25. 
The financial structure of the State’s involvement in the LNG projects offers 
substantial protection against the risk that onshore LNG projects do not resume. Compared 
with the situation at the time of program approval, the risk that the Golfinho project does not 
resume is still considered unlikely and is not in the baseline, although further delays or full 
cancellation could still occur, as the security situation has not been fully resolved. Moreover, the 
second onshore project (Rovuma) is still being evaluated. The State is protected in case the Area 1 
project is cancelled for reason beyond its control. However, the debt service burden for Area 4 
would be carried solely from the production of the offshore platform leaving ENH with negative 
cash flow balance. Without onshore LNG, lower growth would leave the country carrying an already 
heavy debt burden for longer, and future external and exchange rate risks could be expected to be 
higher. Mozambique could seek other ways of exploiting its large natural resources, which will be 
contingent on the window of opportunity during the energy transition. 
26. 
While the authorities made progress in improving debt management, further 
strengthening debt management and oversight remain a high priority. The debt unit in the 
Ministry of Economy and Finance has taken important steps to improve debt management and debt 
reporting and to prevent a new incurrence of external arrears, including (i) adopting a medium-term 


REPUBLIC OF MOZAMBIQUE 
16 
INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND 
debt strategy (published in July 2022), which is being implemented with the help of technical 
assistance; (ii) working to move to a new debt recording system (Meridian) with support from the 
World Bank, which will encompass domestic and external debt of the central government, and 
eventually SOE debt; (iii) reforming cash and debt management to exert greater control of domestic 
debt issuance. At the same time, the authorities have continued to regularly publish annual and 
quarterly public debt reports; and supported public accountability and enforcement measures 
stemming from the “undisclosed debts” scandal. Additional technical assistance from the IMF will 
support the authorities’ effort in strengthening debt management processes, ensuring timely debt 
service payment, reducing borrowing costs, and mitigating risks. 
27. 
In addition, the authorities have committed to several measures under IDA’s 
Sustainable Development Financing Policy (SDFP). As an IDA country currently in high risk of 
debt distress, Mozambique is subject to IDA’s SDFP, which replaced the Non-Concessional 
Borrowing Policy (NCBP). The SDFP foresees a series of Policy and Performance Actions (PPAs) that 
contribute to addressing critical debt vulnerabilities. Mozambique’s FY23 PPAs were successfully 
implemented and FY24 PPA Note was approved in December 2023. Under the policy, the authorities 
have committed this fiscal year to (i) not enter into any contractual obligations for new external 
public and publicly guaranteed (PPG) non-concessional debt; and (ii) to responsibly and 
transparently settle at least 30 percent of the disputed debts accrued during 2013-2014 by 
approving the debt settlement negotiation in the Council of Ministers and incorporating 
renegotiated debt into the official government debt report for 2023.  
AUTHORITIES’ VIEWS 
28. 
The authorities broadly agreed with the assessment made in the DSA. Returning to a 
level of debt that is more sustainable is a goal of the authorities and of the IMF-supported program. 
The government is committed to enhancing the sustainability and transparency of public sector 
debt, and publishes quarterly and annual debt reports, covering stocks, on-lending, and state 
guarantees, including for most SOEs. Going forward, the government will publish a revised medium-
term debt strategy. The authorities confirmed that an agreement had been reached with the 
Brazilian authorities on a reconciled amount for a new loan covering the arrears linked to ADM. The 
repayment plan is pending ratification by the Brazilian parliament. The Ministry of Finance is 
updating on the Medium-Term Debt Strategy planned for publication in 2025. The Ministry is also 
working to move to a new debt recording system (Meridian) with support from the World Bank, 
which will encompass external debt of the central government, and eventually domestic debt and 
SOE debt reconciliation exercise to agree on the external and domestic debt stocks.

1/ Includes both public and private sector external debt.
3/ Includes exceptional financing (i.e., changes in arrears and debt relief); changes in gross foreign assets; and valuation adjustments. For projections also includes contribution from price and exchange rate changes.
4/ Current-year interest payments divided by previous period debt stock.  
5/  Defined as grants, concessional loans, and debt relief.
6/  Grant-equivalent financing includes grants provided directly to the government and through new borrowing (difference between the face value and the PV of new debt).
7/ Assumes that PV of private sector debt is equivalent to its face value.
8/ Historical averages are generally derived over the past 10 years, subject to data availability, whereas projections averages are over the first year of projection and the next 10 years.
2/ Derived as [r - g - ρ(1+g)]/(1+g+ρ+gρ) times previous period debt ratio, with r = nominal interest rate; g = real GDP growth rate, and ρ = growth rate of GDP deflator in U.S. dollar terms.

1/ Coverage of debt: The central government, central bank, government-guaranteed debt, non-guaranteed SOE debt . Definition of external debt is Currency-based.
2/ The underlying PV of external debt-to-GDP ratio under the public DSA differs from the external DSA with the size of differences depending on exchange rates projections. 
3/ Debt service is defined as the sum of interest and amortization of medium and long-term, and short-term debt.
4/ Gross financing need is defined as the primary deficit plus debt service plus the stock of short-term debt at the end of the last period and other debt creating/reducing flows.
5/ Defined as a primary deficit minus a change in the public debt-to-GDP ratio ((-): a primary surplus), which would stabilizes the debt ratio only in the year in question. 
6/ Historical averages are generally derived over the past 10 years, subject to data availability, whereas projections averages are over the first year of projection and the next 10 years.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION AND 
SUPPLEMENTARY LETTER OF INTENT 
 
 
 
This statement provides information that has become available since the issuance of the 
Staff Report for the 2024 Article IV Consultation and Fourth Review under the Extended 
Credit Facility (EBS/24/79) relating to the accumulation of new external arrears resulting in 
a breach of the continuous performance criterion on the zero-ceiling on new external 
arrears also with respect to these new arrears. The thrust of the Staff Report remains 
unchanged. 
Approved By 
Andrea Richter Hume

the Legal and the Strategy, Policy and Review 
Departments

1.      
Capacity constraints resulted in temporary external arrears accumulation under the 
fourth review. In addition to the external arrears to India, Korea, Nordes Bank, and the Arab Bank for 
Economic Development in Africa, the authorities incurred new arrears on external debt service also with 
Spain in January and May 2024 of $48 thousand and $1.1 million, respectively, for a total of $1.15 
million, equivalent to 0.01 percent of GDP. These external arrears were left unpaid by a state-owned 
enterprise (SOE) to which the government has provided a debt guarantee. Thus, the continuous 
performance criterion (QPC) on non-accumulation of new external arrears was breached also with 
respect to those arrears. To reflect these arrears, please see below Table 1 which revises Table 9 of the 
Staff Report.  
2.      
Given the minor nature of these arrears with Spain, staff supports the authorities’ 
request for a waiver of nonobservance of the QPC on non-accumulation of new external arrears. 
Furthermore, the authorities have been strengthening debt management leveraging the new Meridian 
debt database. The authorities are also in the process of migrating the external debt recording system 
to a new system, Meridian, and expanding the coverage to include SOEs’ external debt, with support 
from the World Bank through a long-term expert and IMF technical assistance on medium-term debt 
strategy and annual borrowing plan. The Ministry of Finance continues to strengthen financial 
programming for better cash management to facilitate timely payments and avoid future arrears. In 
addition, the authorities are taking concrete administrative steps to prevent new arrears in the future.

Appendix I. Supplementary Letter of Intent  
June 28, 2024 
 
Ms. Kristalina Georgieva 
Managing Director 
International Monetary Fund 
Washington, DC 20431 
United States of America 
 
 
Dear Ms. Georgieva, 
 
This is a supplement to our Letter of Intent dated June 21, 2024, to inform you that based on 
updated information, we have learned that the Government of Mozambique incurred new arrears on 
external debt service with Spain in January 2024 ($48,000) and May 2024 ($1.1 million), together 
equivalent to 0.01 percent of GDP. These external arrears were incurred by a state-owned enterprise 
(SOE) to which the government has provided a debt guarantee. To reflect these arrears, please see 
appended below Table 2 that revises Table 2 of the Memorandum of Economic and Financial Policies 
attached to our Letter of Intent dated June 21, 2024.  
 
We are requesting a waiver of non-observance of the continuous QPC on non-accumulation of new 
external arrears with respect to these arrears with Spain on the ground that they are minor.  We are 
committed to rapidly clear these arrears and will inform the IMF once this has been done.  
Furthermore, we are taking concrete administrative steps to ensure that arrears are not incurred 
again. 
 
 
Yours sincerely, 
 
 
 
/s/ 
Ernesto Max Elias Tonela 
Minister of Economy and Finance 
/s/ 
Rogério Zandamela 
Governor of the Bank of Mozambique

REPUBLIC OF MOZAMBIQUE 
 


Statement by Mr. Willie Nakunyada, Executive Director for Mozambique; Mr. Adriano 
Isaias Ubisse, Alternate Executive Director; and Mr. Jorge Essuvi, Senior Advisor to 
Executive Board Meeting, July 8, 2024 
Introduction 
1. Our Mozambican authorities thank staff for their constructive engagement and broadly
share the staff’s assessment of policy challenges and priorities. They view the Fund’s
advice and support as instrumental to bolster their efforts to stabilize macroeconomic
conditions.
2. The Mozambique economy has remained resilient in the post-COVID era amid declining
inflation but remains vulnerable to climate shocks. Specifically, the devastating effects of
successive adverse climate events, including cyclones and droughts are inflicting adverse
socio-economic effects and threatening to reverse hard-won infrastructure development
gains. This notwithstanding, the authorities have made determined efforts to keep the Fund-
supported ECF program firmly on-track, despite additional challenges presented by
lingering security risks. They are taking decisive actions to address the wage bill overrun,
while advancing critical structural reforms. Over the medium-term, the authorities are
committed to sustained fiscal consolidation efforts to ensure fiscal and debt sustainability.
The authorities view the ECF arrangement as instrumental to help achieve the objectives
of the country’s Five-Year Government Program 2022–2027, including safeguarding
macroeconomic stability, consolidating public finances, and reducing poverty and social
inequalities, while creating a conducive environment for private sector development and
employment creation.
3. Cognizant of the economic implications from the conflict in the north, the authorities are
making considerable efforts in the fight against terrorism. In this regard, they have made
steady progress to contain security threats and address social and economic consequences
caused by the insurgence. As a result, displaced populations are gradually returning to their
villages thanks to the joint efforts made by the Government and its development partners
that helped provide humanitarian assistance and expedite resumption of economic
activities. That said, the authorities recognize the catalytic role being played by the ECF
arrangement in bringing together development partners and they attach high


2 
 
priority to the program in reprioritizing and sequencing their reform agenda on the back 
of the upcoming general elections scheduled for October 2024. 
Program Performance 
4. Program performance has been broadly satisfactory. Two out of four Quantitative 
Performance Criteria (QPCs) were met. The QPC on the floor of the domestic primary 
budget balance was not met owing to the wage bill overrun and revenue underperformance. 
Further, the continuous PC on non-accumulation of new external arrears has been 
breached, as the government incurred delays to service the debt including for some state-
owned enterprises (SOEs). To address the fiscal slippages, the authorities are adopting both 
expenditure and revenue measures to align the domestic primary budget balance with the 
program targets. At the same time, they have since settled the recently accumulated 
external arrears. Furthermore, the authorities have instituted administrative measures, 
including strengthening financial programming for better cash management to facilitate 
timely payments. 
 
5. Two out three Indicative Targets (ITs) were met. The IT on the social spending floor was 
missed due to financing shortages and capacity constraints. To address capacity constraints 
at the National Institute for Social Action (INAS), the authorities are putting in place a 
targeted-action plan to improve efficiency through digitalization and cash controls with the 
support of the World Bank. In addition, they have agreed with staff’s suggestion to modify 
the IT on social spending into a QPC to safeguard social protection and reduce poverty in 
line with the newly designed National Development Strategy (ENDE 2025-44). 
 
6. Monetary Policy Clause Consultation (MPCC): As a result of the Banco de Moçambique 
(BM)’s proactive monetary tightening over the past 3 years, inflation decelerated and 
evolved within the MPCC band (3-9 percent). According to the central bank, these price 
developments mainly reflect the authorities’ proactive tightening of monetary policy as 
well as the stability of the Metical. 
 
7. The authorities have met three out of four Structural Benchmark (SB). In addition, 
significant progress has been made in implementing the SB on the general audit and "proof 
of life" of all public sector servants, to be completed and reported on by the Inspector-
General of Finance. While for the civil servants the authorities have completed the general 
audit and proof of life (this is a continuous annual exercise), for the security and defense 
sector the authorities are facing operational issues to conclude the remaining 
5.0 percent given the fact that the remaining portion relate to the personnel involved in the 
military operations in the north part of the country. Considering the remedial measures 
taken to address fiscal slippages, and progress made in implementing structural 
reforms, the authorities seek Executive Directors’ support in completing the fourth 
review under the ECF program, and the associated requests.

Recent Economic Developments and Outlook 
8. Real GDP growth is projected to modestly slowdown from 5.4 percent in 2023 to 4.3 
percent in 2024 reflecting the effects of tight monetary conditions and climate-related 
shocks. The medium-term outlook, however, remains dominated by downside risks 
including from the global economic slowdown, geopolitical fragmentation, and volatile 
commodity prices. Additionally, climate shocks, as well as delays in the implementation 
of the LNG megaprojects, could further cloud growth prospects. On the upside, the timely 
crystallization of LNG megaprojects, combined with strong structural reform 
implementation, will provide stronger growth impetus. Meanwhile, inflation decelerated 
from its peak of 12.10 percent in August 2022 to 3.07 percent in May 2024 benefitting 
from tight monetary conditions, relative exchange rate stability, and moderation in fuel and 
food import prices. 
 
9. The current account deficit narrowed significantly in 2023, as tight financial conditions 
dampened imports. As such, international reserves remain stable covering nearly 4 months 
of imports at end-May 2024. Looking ahead, the expected export earnings from LNG, and 
moderate food and energy imports prices are projected to precipitate improved current 
account performance and strengthen external reserve buffers. 
Fiscal Policy and Debt Management 
10. The authorities are making determined efforts to pursue expenditure-based fiscal 
consolidation. Despite spending pressures stemming from the preparation of the 2024 
general elections, the authorities are projecting a domestic primary fiscal balance consistent 
with the program objectives. Relatedly, the government is undertaking bold measures to 
restore budget credibility and ensure fiscal discipline including i) integrating the wage bill 
action plan into the MTEF; ii) completing the integration of the payroll of the security and 
defense sector into the system; and iii) continuously monitoring and forecasting the wage 
bill to eliminate irregularities, including potential ghost workers. Going forward, 
monitoring instruments, including monthly wage bill reporting, regular audits and proof of 
life will be adopted to avoid wage bill slippages. 
 
11. On the revenue side, the authorities are taking concrete steps to strengthen tax collection, 
including enhancing the tax administration capacity. These efforts have been 
complemented by measures to improve non-tax revenue collection including capital 
revenues and dividends from profitable SOEs. In addition, to boosting fuel tax revenues, 
the government has laid the groundwork for the adoption of a fully-fledged automatic fuel 
price-adjustment mechanism to ensure the full pass-through of changes in international fuel 
prices to domestic retail prices to avoid price subsidies. To address the under taxation and 
better realize the revenue potential of the mining sector, the authorities are committed to 
continued efforts to aimed at adopting the best international practices in determining the 
tax base for the mining sector. 
 
12. The government continues to implement its Medium-Term Debt Strategy (MTDS) to place 
public debt on a sustainable footing. To this end, they are committed to follow a prudent 
borrowing strategy for public investment projects, by prioritizing projects under a 


4 
 
tight and secured financing envelope. Importantly, the authorities are prioritizing 
concessional financing, and refraining from contracting new debt to finance low-priority 
investments. Further, the authorities are stepping up efforts to strengthen SOE debt 
management practices by improving monitoring, mapping all existing SOEs and their 
subsidiaries and regularly publishing their consolidated reports. Furthermore, the 
authorities are committed to enhancing the sustainability and transparency of the public 
sector debt by publishing detailed quarterly public sector debt reports containing stock 
levels, intra-agency on-lending, and provision of government guarantees. 
Monetary, Exchange Rate, and Financial Sector Policies 
13. The central bank has adopted proactive monetary policy measures to tame inflation over 
the past 3 years. As a result, inflation declined from peak levels of 12.96 percent in August 
2022, to 3.07 percent in May 2024. While monetary policy decisions will continue to be 
prudent and data-driven, the central bank commenced loosening its monetary policy stance. 
Accordingly, the BM cumulatively cut its policy rate (MIMO) by 225 basis points in its 
first three MPC meetings in 2024. However, the BM stands ready to tighten its monetary 
policy stance should inflation dynamics reverse. Going forward, the central bank will 
continue to refine its framework to implement a forward-looking monetary policy 
framework based on the MIMO to signal its monetary policy intentions, while advancing 
progress on the transition to an inflation targeting regime to bolster macroeconomic 
resilience. 
 
14. Following the adoption of the new FX law, the BM is introducing complementary 
regulation to foster the development of the FX market over the medium-term. To this end, 
they adopted additional measures to maintain a flexible exchange rate as a primary shock 
absorber, while intervening only to smoothen disorderly market conditions and building 
international reserves. Meanwhile, the adoption of the new FX law will also support the 
BM’s efforts to gradually eliminate restrictions on capital and financial transactions. 
 
15. The banking sector has remained broadly resilient to shocks, but the authorities remain 
attentive to potential risks from the recent declines in capital and liquidity ratios. At the 
same time, the BM will continue implementing prudential rules to support the safety and 
soundness of the banking system and ensure that loan classification and provisioning 
standards are kept in check. Moreover, the BM is revising the prudential regulations to 
allow for the smooth transition from Basel II to Basel III capital accords. Moreover, the 
BM attach importance to addressing cybersecurity risks. In this regard, with Fund TA, the 
BM is developing the regulatory and supervisory framework for cybersecurity risks 
management, including through on-site assessments. 
 
16. Improving access to formal financial services continue to rank high on the authorities’ 
agenda to promote financial inclusion. In this regard, the authorities enacted the Basic Bank 
Account Law that simplifies the requirements and reduces the costs of opening bank 
accounts for low-income households. Further, they completed evaluation of their 2016-
2022 National Financial Inclusion Strategy of which the results will help to address 


5 
 
the main challenges faced by the authorities going forward, to help achieve their medium- 
term financial inclusion goals. 
Governance and Structural Reforms 
17. To bolster financial integrity and accelerate the exit from the FATF grey list, the authorities 
have stepped up implementation of the action plan to address identified AML/CFT 
deficiencies. Following the amendments introduced in the AML/CFT legislation, the 
authorities are implementing measures to address the 40 recommendations by the Eastern 
and Southern Africa Anti-Money Laundering Group (ESAAMLG). Specifically, they are 
addressing issues related to beneficial ownership, tackling AML risks in non-governmental 
organizations, and strengthening human and institutional capacity of the financial 
information unit (GIFiM), the Attorney General Office, and other anti-corruption agencies. 
In this connection, the National Assembly has approved in May 2024, amendments to the 
Public Probity Law to clarify the definition of public agent, strengthen the definition of 
conflict of interest and establish published procedures for reporting conflict of interest. 
Moreover, following approval of the law that established the Sovereign Wealth Fund 
(SWF) in December 2023, the authorities have adopted complementary regulation to fully 
operationalize the SWF. 
 
18. Improving transparency in the implementation of the budget ranks high on the authorities’ 
near-term priorities. In this vein, the authorities have established an interdepartmental cash 
management committee for financial program decision making, and a cash management 
unit within the Treasury to forecast and manage cash flows. Additionally, they plan to 
enhance the coverage and functioning of the treasury single account, beginning with the 
full mapping of all public sector bank accounts. Treasury’s cash management will also be 
enhanced with support from a forecasting tool that is being developed within the financial 
management information system (e-SISTAFE). 
 
Climate Change and Adaptation Policies 
19. The impact of climate change and extreme weather events are further exacerbating 
Mozambique’s fragilities. According to the 2021 Global Climate Risk Index, Mozambique 
is ranked among the most vulnerable globally to the impact of climate change and natural 
hazards. As such, efforts to enhance climate resilience rank high among the authorities’ 
policy priorities. The authorities, therefore, adopted the Natural Disasters Management 
Law 15/2014 which provides a general framework for preventive measures and integrating 
adaptation responses into development planning. Details of their long-term policy plans 
are outlined in the National Climate Change Strategy ENAMMC 2013–2025 and the 
Master Plan for Risk and Disaster Reduction 2017–2030. 
20. To tackle climate change, build resilience, and enhance disaster preparedness, the 
authorities are pursuing reform measures informed by their Nationally Determined 
Contribution (NDC), and recent climate policy assessments by the IMF and World Bank. 
That said, they consider IMF’s C-PIMA, and the World Bank’s CCDR important 
instruments to support the institutional and human capacity to ensure the connection 
between national plans, sectoral plans, and the NDC, while accommodating the magnitude, 
frequency and significant costs associated with recurrent climate shocks. In 


6 
 
this regard, they have reached out to various development partners to support their climate 
reform efforts, to develop a climate finance protection strategy that aims to efficiently 
finance post-disaster assistance and investments in climate-resilient infrastructure. They 
view the financing under the Resilience and Sustainability Trust (RST) as instrumental in 
supporting their climate resilience agenda and catalyzing further climate financing. 
 
Conclusion 
21. The authorities remain firmly committed to their reform agenda aimed at restoring 
macroeconomic stability and enhancing sustainable and inclusive growth. They are 
determined to continue implementing appropriate fiscal, monetary, and structural policies 
to set the economy on an accelerated growth path and uplift living standards for the general 
populace. They appreciate the continued Fund engagement and policy advice and look 
forward to the Executive Directors’ support towards completion of the fourth review under 
the ECF arrangement.
