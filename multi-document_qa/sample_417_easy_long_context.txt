2022 Annual Report


Letter from your ceo
To our stockholders, customers, partners, and employees:
The past several years demonstrated just how much 
technology is central to every aspect of human existence. 
Semiconductors power the essential technologies in a world 
that is becoming increasingly digital. 
2022 was a challenging year for Intel. We are currently 
operating in one of the toughest macro environments we 
have ever seen, while simultaneously moving through the 
middle of our own multiyear transformation. As we navigate 
this difficult terrain, it is important to focus on the things we 
can control and to remind ourselves of why we are 
undertaking this journey. Our ambitions are equaled by our 
passions, and our efforts across manufacturing, design, 
products, and foundry are making progress. 
Intel is creating a sustainable, resilient, and secure 
supply chain.
We must be ready to meet the next surge of semiconductor 
demand. Consumer spending habits, the evolution of 
technology, and macroeconomic conditions have always 
contributed to a cyclical semiconductor economy.
Today, we believe we are in a new era of chipmaking that 
requires a reboot around our foundry model mindset – 
differentiating leaders of the future from those comfortable 
with the status quo. Creation of more resilient systems 
without single points of failure or extreme imbalances is more 
important than ever. Nothing so critical to modern life as 
semiconductors should be reliant on a single port or factory 
whether in the Americas, Europe, Asia, or anywhere else in 
the world. Even now, amid economic headwinds, we see 
instances where supply chain constraints leave demand 
unfulfilled, underscoring the need for supply chains to be 
resilient and aggressively rebalanced across the globe. “Just-
in-time” thinking must become “just-in-case.”
Intel is in a unique position to help anticipate and prepare for 
the continuous increase in long-term semiconductor demand. 
With our differentiated IDM 2.0 approach, we can deliver a 
new era of innovation, manufacturing, and product leadership 
through the powerful combination of three capabilities: 
expanding our global internal factory network; strategic use of 
foundry capacity by building on existing relationships with 
third-party foundries; and becoming a major provider of U.S.- 
and European-based capacity through Intel Foundry 
Services.
"Intel plans to regain transistor performance and 
power performance leadership by 2025, and we 
remain on track to deliver on our goal of five 
manufacturing technology nodes in four years."
Pat Gelsinger, Chief Executive Officer, Director, and Principal 
Executive Officer
We are fueling customer growth through tech innovation.
We are the stewards of Moore’s Law, and we intend to 
continue our relentless pursuit of more powerful and efficient 
computing until we discover the power of every element on 
the periodic table. We are harnessing technology to help 
accelerate and expand our customers’ growth, and our 
product roadmap is back on track.
In 2022, we launched our 13th Gen Intel® Core™ desktop 
processor (Raptor Lake), driving leadership in gaming and 
setting a new overclocking world record. We also strongly 
boosted our discrete graphics efforts with products from all 
segments of the Accelerated Computing Systems and 
Graphics Group entering production. We opened 2023 by 
debuting the world’s fastest mobile processor – the 13th Gen 
Intel® Core™ i9-13980HX – and then formally introducing 
4th Gen Intel® Xeon® Scalable processors (Sapphire 
Rapids), the Intel® Xeon® CPU Max series (Sapphire Rapids 
HBM), and the Intel® Data Center GPU Max Series (Ponte 
Vecchio).
Intel plans to regain transistor performance and power 
performance leadership by 2025, and we remain on track to 
deliver on our goal of five manufacturing technology nodes in 
four years. With our 4th Gen Intel Xeon Scalable CPU, Intel 7 
is now in high-volume manufacturing. Intel 4 is running risk 
production, and Intel 3 is on track with two CPUs already 
taped out. Finally, our Intel 20A and Intel 18A process wafers, 
as well as those of a major foundry customer, are taped out 
and demonstrating yields on schedule. These will also benefit 
from our new transistor architecture, RibbonFET, and our 
new power delivery method, PowerVIA.

We are evolving into a systems foundry comprising four 
components: traditional wafer aspect based on Moore’s Law, 
packaging, a chiplet standard, and software. Enabled by 
these capabilities, our foundry goals involve engaging with 
customers at multiple levels, from basic wafer manufacturing 
all the way to helping define and implement their desired 
system architectures.
In addition, we re-introduced our tick-tock roadmap cadence, 
a framework that synchronizes process and product go-to-
market windows in a more predictable way to establish a 
rigorous methodology of design and product development. 
Both are key sparkplugs to our execution engine.
Our Intel Foundry Services pipeline continues to grow, and 
we have now added a major cloud, edge, and data center 
solutions provider as a leading-edge customer for Intel 3. 
Including prior customers like MediaTek, we now have a 
lifetime deal value of greater than $4 billion for IFS. 
Intel is focused on navigating the challenges of today, 
while anticipating the needs of the future.
As we navigate short-term headwinds, we are executing 
upon our strategy, which is designed for long-term growth. 
We have made, and will continue to make, hard decisions. 
We continue to be committed to the cost-cutting measures 
we shared in late 2022; this includes taking some difficult but 
necessary steps to right-size the organization and rationalize 
product roadmaps and investments to enable us to 
concentrate on our strategy’s success. 
This past year, we took important strides to rebuild the 
leadership team, promoting from within and adding fresh 
perspectives from the outside. This includes the board of 
directors, with the addition of Lip-Bu Tan and Barbara Novick, 
and the appointment of Frank Yeary as board chair. 
Underpinning these efforts is a disciplined approach to capital 
allocation. Leveraging our Smart Capital strategy, we can tap 
into multiple pools of capital to support our continued 
investment in manufacturing capacity and funding our IDM 
2.0 strategy. We are also leading the effort to partner with the 
public sector to strengthen the resilience of the global 
semiconductor supply chain by investing in more 
geographically balanced capacity – as we have done in both 
the U.S. and EU.
We take our commitments to our stakeholders extremely 
seriously. For our customers, it is rebuilding our execution 
engine to provide a predictable cadence of best-in-class 
products to support their ambitions. For our employees, it is 
to provide them with the opportunity to develop and bring to 
market world-changing technologies – it is what inspires each 
of us inside Intel. For our owners, it is to make thoughtful, 
deliberate decisions around capital allocation that drive the 
greatest value and highest return on investment we make 
with your capital.
Driven by the innovation of silicon, we are in an era that will 
showcase the true magic of technology. Intel remains fully 
committed to executing on our strategy to deliver leadership 
products anchored on open and secure platforms, powered 
by at-scale manufacturing, and supercharged by our people.
We are all part of a globally interconnected evolution. As we 
continue to transform human progress, we must continue to 
create world-changing technology that improves the life of 
every person on the planet. We have the choice and 
opportunity to decide our future; that choice is not between 
what was and what is, but between what is and what will be.

A Year in Review
2022 revenue was $63.1 billion, down $16.0 billion, or 20%, from 2021 as CCG revenue decreased 23%, DCAI revenue decreased 15%, 
and NEX revenue increased 11%. 2022 results were impacted by an uncertain macroeconomic environment—with slowing consumer 
demand, persistent inflation, and higher interest rates—that we believe impacts our target markets and creates a high level of 
uncertainty with our customers. CCG revenue was down on lower notebook and desktop volume in the consumer and education market 
segments, while notebook and desktop ASPs were higher due to a resulting change in product mix. DCAI server volume decreased, led 
by enterprise customers, and due to customers tempering purchases to reduce existing inventories in a softening data center market. 
Server ASPs decreased due to customer and product mix. NEX revenue increased primarily due to Ethernet ASPs and increased 
demand for 5G products, partially offset by lower demand for Network Xeon. We invested $17.5 billion in R&D, made capital investments 
of $24.8 billion, and generated $15.4 billion in cash from operations and $(4.1) billion of adjusted free cash flow.

Managing to our long-term financial model
Our 2022 results were impacted by an uncertain macroeconomic environment arising from inflation, the war in Ukraine, and COVID-19 
shutdowns in our supply chain in China, and though we expect this uncertainty and a challenging market environment to extend well into 
2023, we remain committed to the strategy and long-term financial model communicated at our Investor Meeting 2022 as included in our 
Form 8-K dated February 17, 2022. To achieve our long-term financial model, we believe it is imperative that we drive to world-class 
product cost and operational efficiency. In the short term, we intend to continue to implement certain cost-cutting measures and improve 
our product execution. We further expect to manage to the investment phase operating expenses and net capital intensity guardrails 
established at our Investor Meeting 2022 and to drive back to a gross margin range of 51% to 53%, once economic conditions improve 
and revenue growth returns. Longer term, we plan to execute multiple initiatives designed to optimize the business, thus creating 
efficiencies and continued structural cost savings. This includes implementing an internal foundry model, making portfolio cuts, right sizing 
our support organizations, creating more stringent cost controls across our spending, and improving sales and marketing efficiency. 
Though we aggressively adjusted capital investments in 2022 to respond to changing business conditions, we still made significant 
investments in support of our IDM 2.0 strategy during the year. We expect our capital expenditures will continue to be higher than 
historical levels for the next several years as we execute towards our goal of delivering five technology nodes in four years. We also 
introduced our IDM 2.0 Acceleration Office to transition our operations to an internal foundry model that is designed to deliver consistent 
processes, systems, and guardrails among our business units, and design and manufacturing teams, which we expect will allow us to 
improve structural efficiencies by driving accountability and costs back to decision makers within the company.

Delivering leadership products
We seek to develop and offer leading products that will help enable a future in which every human can have more computing power and 
quicker access to data. We remain committed to our goal of delivering five technology nodes in four years. This year, we achieved several 
key milestones on our product roadmap, including:  
▪
We launched the 12th Gen Intel® Core™ HX processors—the final products in our Alder Lake family, which utilize desktop-caliber
silicon in a mobile package to deliver high levels of performance for professional workflows.
▪
We introduced the Intel® Data Center GPU Flex Series for the intelligent visual cloud and revealed the 13th Gen Intel® Core™
processor family with six new unlocked desktop processors for leading gaming, streaming, and recording experiences.
▪
We launched the newest Intel® Xeon® D processors and Intel® Arc™ A-series GPUs (also known as Alchemist), and began
shipping Mount Evans, a 200G ASIC IPU, as well as the first Intel® Blockscale™ ASIC.
▪
We began high-volume manufacturing of Sapphire Rapids, Raptor Lake, and Ponte Vecchio in 2022, with shipments beginning in
Q4 2022.
Investing in at-scale manufacturing
To help accelerate our IDM 2.0 strategy, we are investing in manufacturing capacity around the world. We broke ground on two new 
leading-edge chip factories in Ohio, initially announcing plans to invest more than $20.0 billion to establish the first advanced 
semiconductor campus in the “Silicon Heartland”. We also announced our plans to invest up to €80.0 billion in the European Union over 
the next decade across the semiconductor value chain—from R&D to manufacturing to state-of-the-art packaging technologies. These 
include a plan to invest up to an initial €17.0 billion to build a leading-edge semiconductor fab mega-site in Germany; to create a new R&D 
and design hub in France; and to invest in R&D, manufacturing, and foundry services in Ireland, Italy, Poland, and Spain.
To create further financial flexibility while we accelerate our strategy, we announced SCIP, a program that introduces a new funding model 
to the capital-intensive semiconductor industry. As part of this program, we closed a definitive agreement with Brookfield Asset 
Management (Brookfield), creating an equity partnership whereby we and Brookfield own 51% and 49%, respectively, of the newly formed 
entity, Arizona Fab LLC (Arizona Fab). We expect Arizona Fab will invest up to $30.0 billion in expanded manufacturing infrastructure at 
our Ocotillo campus in Chandler, Arizona.
We also look to acquisitions to supplement and strengthen our capital. In Q1 2022, we entered into a definitive agreement to acquire 
Tower Semiconductor Ltd. (Tower) in a cash-for-stock transaction. Tower is a leading foundry for analog semiconductor solutions. The 
acquisition is expected to advance our IDM 2.0 strategy by accelerating our global end-to-end foundry business. While we continue to 
work to close within the first quarter of 2023, the transaction may close in the first half of 2023, subject to certain regulatory approvals and 
customary closing conditions.
Strengthening focus on the core business
We reorganized our business units in a way that is designed to accelerate the execution and innovation of our company by allowing us to 
capture long-term growth in both large traditional markets and high-growth emerging markets, while providing increased transparency, 
focus, and accountability.
We announced the implementation of cost-cutting measures, including a slower pace of hiring and restructuring actions, designed to 
reduce operating expenditures and manage the business toward our long-term financial strategy.
We completed the IPO of Mobileye, building on Mobileye’s revenue growth and record of innovation and unlocking value for Intel 
stockholders.
Committing to positive global impact
In April 2022, we announced our commitment to achieve net-zero greenhouse gas emissions across our global operations (Scope 1 and 
2) by 2040 and to increase the energy efficiency and lower the carbon footprint of our products and platforms.

Our Strategy
The entire world is becoming digital as technology is increasingly central to every aspect of human existence. As we look ahead to the 
next decade, we expect to see continued movement to digital for everything—the way we work, learn, connect, develop, and operate. 
Semiconductors are the underlying technology powering the digitization of everything, and this is being accelerated by five superpowers: 
ubiquitous compute, pervasive connectivity, cloud-to-edge infrastructure, AI, and sensing. Together these superpowers combine to 
amplify, and reinforce each other, and will exponentially increase the world’s need for computing by packing even more processing 
capability onto ever-smaller microchips. We intend to lead the industry by harnessing these superpowers for our customers’ growth and 
our own.
We are uniquely positioned with the depth and breadth of our software, silicon and platforms, and packaging and process technology with 
at-scale manufacturing. With these strengths and the tailwinds of the superpowers driving digital disruption, our strategy to win is focused 
on four key themes: product leadership, open platforms, manufacturing at scale, and our people. 
Our Priorities
Product Leadership
Lead and democratize compute with Intel x86 and xPU. Our product offerings provide end-to-end solutions, scaling from edge computing 
to 5G networks, the cloud, and the emerging fields of AI and autonomous driving, to serve an increasingly smart and connected world.
At our core is the x86 computing ecosystem, which supports an extensive and deep universe of software applications, with billions of lines 
of code written and optimized for x86 CPUs. We continue to advance this ecosystem with x86 microarchitectures focused on 
performance, which push the limits of low latency and single-threaded application performance, and microarchitectures focused on 
efficiency, which are designed for computing throughput efficiency to enable scalable multithreaded performance. Our innovative new 13th 
Gen client processors (Raptor Lake) combine both performance cores and efficient cores in a performance hybrid architecture that can 
direct workloads to the right core depending on whether they require higher performance or power efficiency. We can also combine these 
architectural advances with our innovations in process and packaging technology, as in our next-generation Intel Xeon data center CPU 
(Sapphire Rapids), which utilizes performance cores on multiple compute tiles connected through our EMIB packaging technology in a 
scalable design, rather than being built on a monolithic silicon die. 
Beyond the CPU, we are delivering a growing family of xPU products, which encompass client and data center GPUs, IPUs, FPGAs, and 
other accelerators. The xPU approach recognizes that different workloads benefit from different computing architectures, and our broad 
portfolio helps meet our customers' increasingly diverse computing needs. As part of our strategy, we seek to develop and offer leading 
products across each of these architectural categories. Our vision is that our products will help enable a future in which every human can 
have one petaflop of computing power and one petabyte of data less than one millisecond away.
Fundamentals of Our Business

Open Platforms
We aim to deliver open software and hardware platforms with industry-defining standards. Around the globe, companies are building their 
networks, systems, and solutions on open standards-based platforms. Intel has helped set the stage for this movement, with our historic 
contributions in developing standards such as CXL, Thunderbolt™, and PCI Express* (PCIe*). We also contributed to the design, build, 
and validation of open-source products in the industry such as Linux*, Android*, and others. The world's developers constantly innovate 
and expand the capabilities of these open platforms while increasing their stability, reliability, and security. In addition, microservices have 
enabled the development of flexible, loosely coupled services that are connected via application programming interfaces to create end-to-
end processes. We use industry collaboration, co-engineering, and open-source contributions to accelerate software innovation. Through 
our oneAPI initiative, developers use a unified language across CPUs, GPUs, and FPGAs to cut down on development time and to 
enhance productivity. We also deliver a steady stream of open-source code and optimizations for projects across virtually every platform 
and usage model. We are committed to co-engineering and jointly designing, building, and validating new products with software industry 
leaders to accelerate mutual technology advancements and help new software and hardware work better together. Our commitment 
extends to developers through our developer-first approach based on openness, choice, and trust. 
Ultimately, we believe our pivot to a software-defined, silicon-enhanced strategy will enable us to realize value at all layers of the stack. 
This should allow us to continue to monetize foundational and ecosystem enabling software through hardware sales, limited licensing, and 
customer-enabling service offerings. Additionally, we intend to expand our software portfolio by developing and monetizing software 
solutions, services, and platforms with SaaS, software subscriptions, and other business models. We expect to focus on applied AI, trust 
and security, and cloud performance for our SaaS and subscription-based software and we plan to launch our first security SaaS product, 
Project Amber (an independent attestation service), in 2023.
Manufacturing at Scale 
IDM 2.0, the next evolution and expansion of our IDM model, is a differentiated strategy that combines three capabilities:
Internal factory network. Our global, internal factory network has been foundational to our success, enabling product optimization, 
improved economics, and supply resilience. We intend to remain a leading developer of process technology and a major manufacturer of 
semiconductors and will continue to build the majority of our products in our factories.
Strategic use of foundry capacity. We expect to expand our use of third-party foundry manufacturing capacity, which will provide us with 
increased flexibility and scale to optimize our product roadmaps for cost, performance, schedule, and supply. Our use of foundry capacity 
will include manufacturing for a range of modular tiles on advanced process technologies. 
System foundry. We are building a world-class foundry business to meet the growing long-term global demand for semiconductors. We 
plan to differentiate our foundry offerings from those of others through a combination of leading-edge packaging and process technology, 
committed capacity in the US and Europe available for customers globally, and a world-class IP portfolio that will include x86 cores, as 
well as other ecosystem IP. The current foundry model enabled explosion of ecosystem innovation at the wafer level. We believe this 
established model has historically served the industry well, but a new mindset is needed in our new era of chipmaking. As innovation 
evolves, we see the rack has collapsed into a system and the system has collapsed into an advanced package. We are building out a 
system foundry that has four components: wafer fabrication, packaging, chiplet standard, and software.
The system foundry involves engaging with customers at multiple levels, from basic wafer manufacturing to helping define and implement 
their desired system architecture. We intend to build our customers' silicon designs and deliver full end-to-end customizable products built 
with our advanced packaging technology. 
We believe our IDM 2.0 strategy enables us to deliver leading process technology and products to meet growing long-term demand using 
internal and external capacity, while leveraging our core strengths to provide foundry services to others and providing superior capacity, 
supply resilience, and an advantageous cost structure.
Our People
Our world-class talent is at the heart of everything we do. Together we strive to have a positive effect on business, society, and the planet. 
Delivering on our strategy and growth ambitions requires attracting, developing, and retaining top talent from across the world. Our people 
build our technology, unlock new business opportunities, and work with our partners and customers to create global impact.  
Fostering a culture of empowerment, inclusion, and accountability is also core to our strategy. We are committed to creating an inclusive 
workplace where the world’s best engineers and technologists can fulfill their dreams and create technology that improves the life of every 
person on the planet.
Growth Imperative
We are investing to position the company for accelerated long-term growth, focusing on both our core businesses and our growth 
businesses. In our client and server businesses, our strategy is to invest to strengthen the competitiveness of our product roadmap and to 
explore new opportunities. We believe we have significant opportunities to grow and gain share in graphics; mobility, including 
autonomous driving; networking and edge; and foundry services. 
Fundamentals of Our Business

Focus on Innovation and Execution
We are focused on executing our product and process roadmap and accelerating our cadence of innovation. We have set a detailed 
process and packaging technology roadmap and announced key architectural innovations to further our goal of delivering leadership 
products in every area in which we compete. We are returning our culture to its roots in innovation and execution, drawing on principles 
established by our former CEO Andy Grove that emphasize discipline and accountability. This includes re-establishing OKRs throughout 
the organization to drive a common purpose.
To help us execute toward our IDM 2.0 strategy, we are leveraging our Smart Capital approach. This approach is designed to enable us to 
adjust quickly to opportunities in the market, while managing our margin structure and capital spending. The key elements of Smart 
Capital include:
▪
Smart capacity investments. We are aggressively building out manufacturing shell space, which gives us flexibility in how and
when we bring additional capacity online based on milestone triggers such as product readiness, market conditions, and
customer commitments.
▪
Government incentives. We are continuing to work with governments in the US and Europe to advance incentives for domestic
manufacturing capacity for leading-edge semiconductors.
▪
SCIP. We are accessing strategically aligned capital to increase our flexibility and help efficiently accelerate and scale
manufacturing build-outs. This type of co-investment also demonstrates how private capital is unlocked and becomes a force
multiplier for government incentives for semiconductor manufacturing expansion.
▪
Customer commitments. IFS is working closely with potential customers and exploring their willingness to make advance
payments to secure capacity. This provides us with the advantage of committed volume, de-risking investments while providing
capacity corridors for our foundry customers.
▪
External foundries. We intend to continue our use of external foundries where their unique capabilities support our leadership
products.

Our Financial Capital Allocation Strategy
Invest in the Business
Our first allocation priority is to invest in R&D and capital spending to capitalize on the opportunity presented by the world's demand for 
semiconductors. We also respond to changing business and economic conditions. We adjusted and refocused our capital investment for 
2022 and in the short term, while accelerating the deployment of our Smart Capital strategy. 
Return Excess Cash to Stockholders
Our capital allocation strategy includes returning excess cash to stockholders. We achieve this through our dividend policy and when 
permissible, stock repurchases. We expect our future stock repurchases to continue to be significantly below our levels from 2021 and 
recent preceding years due to our current curtailment of this program.

Intellectual Capital
Research and Development
R&D investment is critical to enable us to deliver on our accelerated process technology roadmap, introduce leading products, and 
develop new businesses and capabilities in the future. We seek to protect our R&D efforts through our IP rights and may augment R&D 
initiatives by acquiring or investing in companies, entering into R&D agreements, and directly purchasing or licensing technology.
Areas Key to Product Leadership
We have intensified our focus on areas key to product leadership. Our objective with each new generation of products is to improve user 
experiences and value through advances in performance, power, cost, connectivity, security, form factor, and other features. We also 
focus on reducing our design complexity, re-using IP, and increasing ecosystem collaboration to improve our efficiency.
Process and packaging. Our leading-edge process and packaging technology and world-class IP portfolio are key to the success of our 
strategy. This year, we have reaffirmed our commitment to achieving process technology leadership in 2025 by planning to deliver five 
technology nodes in four years. In addition, we have solidified our process and packaging offerings to external customers through IFS.
▪
We introduced further optimizations to our Intel 7 process node, which is now in production for our 13th Gen Intel Core
processors (Raptor Lake).
▪
Intel 4, taking advantage of EUV, is a node that is designed to deliver significant density scaling and approximately 20%
performance-per-watt improvement over Intel 7. Meteor Lake is scheduled to be our first high-volume client product on Intel 4.
▪
We expect Intel 3 to deliver further logic scaling and up to 18% performance-per-watt improvement over Intel 4. Intel 3 is our
first advanced node offered to IFS customers and is optimized for the needs of Data Center products.
▪
Intel 20A will follow Intel 3 and will introduce two breakthrough technologies that we expect will deliver up to 15% performance-
per-watt improvement over Intel 3: RibbonFET and PowerVia. RibbonFET, our implementation of a gate-all-around transistor, is
designed to deliver faster transistor switching speeds while achieving the same drive current as multiple fins, but in a smaller
footprint. PowerVia is our unique industry-first implementation of backside power delivery that is designed to optimize signal
transmission by eliminating the need for power routing on the front side of the wafer.
▪
Intel 18A, our second IFS advanced node offering, improves on Intel 20A by delivering ribbon innovation for design optimization
and line width reduction. Intel 18A is on schedule and expected to deliver an additional 10% improvement in performance per
watt over Intel 20A.
▪
Beyond Intel 18A, we have already initiated definition and development of our next two process nodes and continue to define,
build, and develop the next-generation High Numerical Aperture EUV lithography into our process technology roadmap.
▪
Our family of 3D advanced packaging technology will usher in the next generation of Foveros technology, enabling us to mix
multiple top die tiles with multiple base tiles across mixed fab nodes, giving Intel and our customers greater flexibility for
disaggregated chip designs. Our future Foveros Direct technology should scale interconnect pitch below 10µm, enable direct
copper-to-copper bonding for low-resistance interconnects, and blur the boundary between wafer and package.
xPU architecture. We believe the future is a diverse mix of scalar, vector, matrix, and spatial architectures deployed in CPU, GPU, 
accelerator, and FPGA sockets, enabled by a scalable software stack and integrated into systems by advanced packaging technology. 
We are building processors that span several major computing architectures, moving toward an era of heterogeneous computing: 
▪
CPU. We started shipping our 4th Gen Intel Xeon Scalable processors (Sapphire Rapids) based on Intel 7 with the new Golden
Cove core, built-in AI acceleration, cryptographic acceleration, and advanced security capabilities. We also launched our 13th
Gen Intel Core processors (Raptor Lake), which will scale from thin and light laptops to enthusiast desktop and notebook
platforms. These are based on a hybrid architecture utilizing Raptor Cove performance cores and Gracemont power-efficient
cores and are socket-compatible with Alder Lake systems.
▪
GPU and HPC. Following the Q1 2022 launch of the first Intel® Arc™-branded laptop GPUs (A3 series), in Q4 2022 we launched
the high-performance desktop GPUs (A7 series). Intel Arc GPUs offer dedicated graphics capability to power premium laptop
and desktop experiences. Intel Arc A-Series GPUs come with advanced technologies to enable immersive gaming and powerful
content creation in modern, portable designs. In Q4 2022, we also introduced the Intel® Max Series product family with two
leading-edge products for high-performance computing and AI: Intel® Xeon® CPU Max Series (also known as Sapphire Rapids
HBM) and Intel® Data Center GPU Max Series (also known as Ponte Vecchio). These new products will power the upcoming
Aurora supercomputer at Argonne National Laboratory and will help progress our vision of increasing the computing power of
every human.
▪
Interconnect. Mount Evans, Intel’s first ASIC IPU, is designed to address the complexity of diverse and dispersed data centers.
An IPU is designed to enable cloud and communication service providers to reduce overhead and free up performance for
CPUs.
▪
Matrix Accelerator. In Q2 2022, we launched our second-generation deep learning processors for training and inference: Habana
Gaudi2* and Habana Greco*. These new processors address an industry gap by providing customers with high-performance,

high-efficiency, deep-learning compute choices for both training workloads and inference deployments in the data center, while 
lowering the AI barrier to entry for companies of all sizes.
Software. Software unleashes the potential of our hardware platforms across all workloads, domains, and architectures. 
▪
In 2022, oneAPI adoption continued to expand across the industry. oneAPI enables developers to build cross-architecture
applications using a single code base across CPUs, GPUs, and FPGAs to reduce development time and enhance productivity.
Our oneAPI-based tools take advantage of unique hardware features and lower software development and maintenance costs.
Developers can choose the best architecture for the problem at hand without rewriting their entire code base, accelerating their
time to value.
▪
We seek to accelerate adoption of oneAPI and Intel software developer tools through diverse ecosystem activities, including
developer training, summits, centers of excellence, and access to Intel hardware and software through a developer cloud. The
Intel® DevCloud, currently in public beta release, will host global users spanning AI, data science, high-performance computing,
media and graphics, and other accelerated computing workloads.
▪
We believe AI will be ubiquitous, and with our tools and the broad open software ecosystem, we are well-positioned to scale AI.
We optimize for the most widely used AI frameworks and libraries, including TensorFlow, Pytorch, Scikit-learn, NumPy, XGBoost,
and Spark, with certain optimizations delivering up to 100 times performance improvements to support end-to-end AI. We also
develop innovative Intel software to accelerate developer productivity, such as OpenVINO™, Intel® Neural Compressor, BigDL,
and AI software reference kits. 
▪
We seek to continually improve our system and foundational-level software in support of our client, data center, networking, and
graphics products, delivering AI-optimized software across the stack, including BIOS, firmware, simulation, operating systems,
and virtualization.
IP Rights
We own and develop significant IP and related IP rights around the world that support our products, services, R&D, and other activities 
and assets. Our IP portfolio includes patents, copyrights, trade secrets, trademarks, mask works, and other rights. We actively seek to 
protect our global IP rights and to deter unauthorized use of our IP and other assets. 
We have obtained patents in the US and other countries. Because of the fast pace of innovation and product development, our products 
are often obsolete before the patents related to them expire, and in some cases our products may be obsolete before the patents are 
granted. As we expand our product offerings into new areas, we also seek to extend our patent development efforts. In addition to 
developing patents based on our own R&D efforts, we may purchase or license patents from third parties. 
The software that we distribute, including software embedded in our products, is entitled to copyright and other IP protection. To 
distinguish our products from our competitors' products, we have obtained trademarks and trade names for our products, and we maintain 
cooperative advertising programs with customers to promote our brands and to identify products containing genuine Intel components. 
We also protect details about our processes, products, and strategies as trade secrets, keeping confidential the information that we 
believe provides us with a competitive advantage.
Efforts to protect our IP can be difficult, particularly in countries that provide less protection to IP rights and in the absence of harmonized 
international IP standards. Competitors and others may already have IP rights covering similar products. There is no assurance that we 
will be able to obtain IP rights covering our own products or that we will be able to obtain IP licenses from other companies on favorable 
terms or at all. For a discussion of IP-related risks, see "Risk Factors" within Other Key Information. While our IP rights are important to 
our success, our business as a whole is not significantly dependent on any single patent, copyright, or other IP right.

Manufacturing Capital
As the guardians of Moore's Law, we continuously innovate to advance the design and manufacturing of semiconductors to help address 
our customers' greatest challenges. This makes possible new leadership products with higher performance while balancing power 
efficiency, cost, and size. 
Our IDM 2.0 strategy allows us to deliver leadership products using internal and external capacity while leveraging our core strengths to 
provide foundry services to others. IDM 2.0 combines three capabilities. First, we will continue to build most of our products in Intel fabs. 
Second, we expect to expand our use of third-party foundry capacity to manufacture a range of modular tiles on advanced process 
technologies. Third, we are building a world-class foundry business with IFS, which we expect will combine leading-edge packaging and 
process technology, committed capacity in the US and Europe, and a world-class IP portfolio that will include x86 cores, as well as other 
ecosystem IP. 
Network and Supply Chain
In 2022, our factories performed well in a highly dynamic environment, where we adapted to rapid demand shifts and industry component 
shortages affecting us and our customers. We continue to work across our supply chain to minimize disruptions, improve productivity, and 
increase overall capacity and output to meet customer expectations.
Our global supply chain supports internal partners across architecture, product design, technology development, manufacturing and 
operations, sales and marketing, and business units, and our supply ecosystem comprises thousands of suppliers globally. Our mission is 
to enable product and process leadership, industry-leading total cost of ownership, and on-time and uninterrupted supply for our 
customers. We supplement our own manufacturing capacity through our use of third-party foundries. 
As of the end of 2022, we had nine manufacturing sites in production — five wafer fabrication facilities and four assembly and test 
facilities. The following map shows these factory sites and the countries where we have a significant R&D and/or sales presence. In our 
continued response to COVID-19, we maintained the operational measures put in place in 2020 and 2021 to enable a continued safe 
environment for our employees and the operation of our manufacturing sites. 
Our manufacturing facilities are primarily used for silicon wafer manufacturing, assembling, and testing of our platform products. We 
operate in a network of manufacturing facilities integrated as though they were one factory to provide the most flexible supply capacity, 
allowing us to better analyze our production costs and adapt to changes in capacity needs. Our new process technologies are transferred 
from a central development fab to each manufacturing facility. After transfer, the network of factories and the development fab collaborate 
to continue driving operational improvements. This enables fast ramp of the operation, quick learning, and quality control. 
We are expanding manufacturing capacity across multiple sites, including Arizona, Ireland, Israel, and Oregon as well as New Mexico and 
Malaysia for advanced packaging. This year, we broke ground on our new site in Ohio and officially added Germany to our roadmap.

Human Capital
Our human capital strategy is grounded in our belief that our people are fundamental to our success. Delivering on our strategy and 
growth ambitions requires attracting, developing, and retaining top talent across the world. We are committed to creating an inclusive 
workplace where the world’s best engineers and technologists can fulfill their dreams and create technology that improves the life of every 
person on the planet. We invest in our highly skilled workforce of 131,900 people by creating practices, programs, and benefits that 
support the evolving world of work and our employees’ needs. 
Fostering a culture of empowerment, inclusion, and accountability is also core to our strategy. We are focused on reinvigorating our 
culture to strengthen our execution and accelerate our cadence of innovation. Our values—customer first, fearless innovation, results 
driven, one Intel, inclusion, quality, and integrity—inspire us and are key to delivering on our purpose. All employees are responsible for 
upholding these values, the Intel Code of Conduct, and Intel's Global Human Rights Principles, which form the foundation of our policies 
and practices and ethical business culture.
Talent Management
We continue to see significant competition for talent throughout the semiconductor industry. Though we slowed the pace of hiring in the 
second half of 2022 in line with macroeconomic forecasts, financial performance, and cost-cutting measures, and took actions to 
rebalance our workforce, the investments we are making to accelerate our process technology require continued and focused efforts to 
attract and retain talent—especially technical talent. Our undesired turnover rate1 was 5.6% in both 2022 and 2021.
We invest significant resources to develop the talent needed to remain at the forefront of innovation and make Intel an employer of choice. 
We offer extensive training programs and provide rotational assignment opportunities and are working to update our job architecture to 
help employees create custom learning curricula for building skills and owning their careers. To further support the growth and 
development of our people, we continue to increase mentoring in our technical community, drive engagement through employee resource 
groups, and promote health and wellness resources to all our people. Through our annual Employee Experience Survey and Manager 
Development Feedback Survey, employees can voice their perceptions of the company, their managers, their work experience, and their 
learning and development opportunities. Our employees' voices are important to enable our culture of continuous improvement, and as a 
result, we link a portion of our executive and employee performance bonus to participation in our Employee Experience Survey. Our 
performance management system is designed to support our cultural evolution and to increase our focus on disciplined OKRs. 
Inclusion
Diversity and inclusion are core elements of Intel's values and instrumental to driving innovation and 
positioning us for growth. Over the past decade, we have taken actions to integrate diversity and inclusion 
expectations into our culture, performance and management systems, leadership expectations, and 
annual bonus metrics. We are proud of what we have accomplished to advance diversity and inclusion, 
but we recognize we can achieve more, including beyond the walls of Intel. Our RISE strategy and 2030 
goals set our global ambitions for the rest of the decade, including doubling the number of women in 
senior leadership; doubling the number of underrepresented minorities in US senior leadership; increasing 
the percentage of employees who self-identify as having a disability to 10%; and exceeding 40% 
representation of women in technical roles, including engineering positions and other roles with technical 
job requirements. To drive accountability, we continue to link a portion of our executive and employee 
compensation to diversity and inclusion metrics. 
We have committed our scale, expertise, and reach through our comprehensive RISE strategy to work 
with customers and other stakeholders to accelerate the adoption of inclusive business practices across 
industries. As part of the Alliance for Global Inclusion, we worked with a coalition of technology companies 
to create a Global Inclusion Index Survey, which serves as a benchmark for companies to track diversity 
and inclusion improvements, provide information on current best practices, and highlight opportunities to 
improve outcomes across industries. The results of the second Global Inclusion Index Survey were 
published in 2022 and shared with business leaders across industries. The number of companies that 
completed the inclusion index in 2022 nearly doubled compared to in 2021. This collective effort will allow 
the industry to more clearly identify actions needed to advance progress on closing persistent gaps and 
advancing more inclusive practices in workplaces, industry, and society. The survey results for 2022 
showed participants making progress in many of these areas. We will also continue to collaborate on 
initiatives that expand the diverse pipeline of talent for our industry, advance social equity, make 
technology fully inclusive, and expand digital readiness for millions of people around the world. 
1 Undesired turnover includes all regular Intel employees who voluntarily left Intel, but does not include Intel contract employees, interns, or employees who 
separated from Intel due to divestiture, retirement, voluntary separation packages, death, job elimination, or redeployment.
2  Senior leadership refers to salary grades 10+ and equivalent grades. While we present male and female, we acknowledge this is not fully encompassing 
of all gender identities.

Compensation and Benefits
We structure pay, benefits, and services to meet the varying needs of our employees. Our total rewards package includes market-
competitive pay, broad-based stock grants and bonuses, an employee stock purchase plan, healthcare and retirement benefits, paid time 
off and family leave, parent reintegration, fertility assistance, flexible work schedules, sabbaticals, and on-site services. Since 2019, we 
have achieved gender pay equity globally and we continue to maintain race/ethnicity pay equity in the US. We achieve pay equity by 
closing the gap in average pay between employees of different genders or race/ethnicity in the same or similar roles after accounting for 
legitimate business factors that can explain differences, such as location, time at grade level, and tenure. We have also advanced 
transparency in our pay and representation data by publicly releasing our EEO-1 survey pay data since 2019. We believe that our holistic 
approach toward pay equity, representation, and creating an inclusive culture enables us to cultivate a workplace that helps employees 
develop and progress in their careers at all levels. Our “hybrid-first” approach to working was informed by employees surveyed around the 
globe and involves the majority of our employees splitting their time between working remotely and in the office. Hybrid-first and remote 
work options cast a wider recruitment net and support our ambition to hire the best global talent. Currently, there is no company-wide 
mandate on the number of days per week employees should be on site or how they should collaborate. Our goal is to enable remote and 
on-site work where it drives the best output, while ensuring our employees have equitable access to systems, resources, and 
opportunities that allow them to succeed.
Health, Safety, and Wellness
Our commitment to Intel's Environmental, Health, and Safety Policy is to provide a safe and injury-free workplace. We regularly invest in 
programs designed to improve physical, mental, and social well-being. We provide access to a variety of innovative, flexible, and 
convenient health and wellness programs, including on-site health centers, and we aim to increase awareness of and support for mental 
and behavioral health. In support of our RISE goals, we will continue to build our strong safety culture and drive the global expansion of 
our corporate wellness program through employee education and engagement activities.
Social and Relationship Capital
We are committed to engaging in initiatives that support our communities and help us develop trusted relationships with our stakeholders. 
Proactive engagement with our stakeholders and investments in social impact initiatives, including those aligned with the United Nations 
Sustainable Development Goals, advance our position as a leading corporate citizen and create shared value for Intel, our global supply 
chain, and our communities.
Economic and social. The health of our business and local economies depends in part on continued investments in innovation. We 
provide high-skill, high-paying jobs around the world, many of which are manufacturing and R&D jobs located in our own domestic and 
international factories. As we expand operations in Arizona, Oregon, Ohio, and Europe, we are building a pipeline of qualified workers 
through our talent strategy and the many investments we are making in education. We also benefit economies through our R&D 
ecosystem spending, sourcing activities, employee spending, and tax payments. We make sizable capital investments and provide 
leadership in public-private partnerships to spur economic growth and innovation. 
We stand at the forefront of new technologies that are increasingly being used to empower individuals, companies, and governments 
around the world to solve global challenges. We aim to empower people through education and advance social initiatives to create career 
pathways into the technology industry. This includes our global Intel Digital Readiness Programs, such as AI for Youth and AI for 
Workforce, scaled in partnership with governments and institutions to empower individuals with digital readiness and AI skills. Additionally, 
we invest in multi-year partnerships with historically Black colleges and universities in the US to increase the number of Black/African 
Americans who pursue electrical engineering, computer engineering, and computer science fields. Our employees and retirees share their 
expertise through volunteer initiatives in the communities where we operate, volunteering approximately 2.81 million hours over the past 
three years. These efforts contribute to our RISE goal to volunteer 10 million hours over a decade. COVID-19 presented challenges over 
the last few years for in-person volunteering, but we continued to see an outpouring of support from employees for virtual volunteering, 
donations, and innovative technology projects to support our communities, and in 2022, a return to more in-person volunteering. Since 
2020, we announced and further expanded upon the Intel RISE Technology Initiative, which provides an expanded channel to build 
deeper relationships with our customers and partners aligned with our corporate purpose and work to create shared value through our 
RISE strategy. Specifically, we are funding projects in areas such as using technology to improve health and safety, making technology 
more inclusive while expanding digital readiness, and carbon-neutral computing to help address climate change. 
Human rights commitment. We are committed to maintaining and improving processes to avoid complicity in human rights violations 
related to our operations, supply chain, and products. We have established an integrated approach to managing human rights across our 
business, including senior-level management involvement, with board-level oversight. We also meet throughout the year with external 
stakeholders and experts on human rights to continue to inform and evolve our human rights policies and oversight processes. While we 
do not always know, nor can we control, what products our customers create or the applications end users may develop, we do not 
tolerate our products being used to violate human rights. When we become aware of a concern that our products are being used by a 
business partner in connection with abuses of human rights, our policies require that we restrict or cease business with the third party until 
we have high confidence that our products are not being used to violate human rights.

Supply Chain Responsibility
We actively manage our supply chain to help reduce risk, improve product quality, achieve environmental and social goals, and improve 
overall performance and value creation for Intel, our customers, and our suppliers. To drive responsible and sustainable practices 
throughout our supply chain, we have robust programs to educate and engage suppliers that support our global manufacturing operations. 
We actively collaborate with other companies and lead industry initiatives on key issues such as improving transparency around climate 
and water impacts in the global electronics supply chain and, as part of our RISE strategy, we are advancing collaboration across our 
industry on responsible minerals sourcing. Through these efforts we help set electronics industry-wide standards, develop audit 
processes, and conduct training.
Over the past decade, we have directly engaged with our suppliers to verify compliance and build capacity to address risks of forced and 
bonded labor and other human rights issues. We perform supplier audits and identify critical direct suppliers to engage through capability-
building programs, which help suppliers build sustainability acumen and verify compliance with the Responsible Business Alliance and our 
Code of Conduct. We also engage with indirect suppliers through our programs on forced and bonded labor, responsible minerals, and 
supplier diversity. To achieve our RISE goals, we are significantly expanding the number of suppliers covered by our engagement 
activities. The supply chain environmental team is also actively engaging suppliers to measure and reduce their greenhouse gas 
emissions footprints, and the resulting impact on our footprint, in order to meet our long-term emissions reductions goals.
Our commitment to diversity and inclusion also extends to our suppliers. We believe a diverse supply chain supports greater innovation 
and value for our business. We have set additional spending targets with women-owned suppliers outside the US and with minority-
owned suppliers globally to accelerate progress toward our goal to increase global annual spending with diverse suppliers by 100% to 
reach $2 billion in annual spending by 2030. We continue to only retain or use outside law firms in the US that are above average on 
diversity for their equity partners and apply a similar rule to firms used by our tax department, including non-legal firms.
Natural Capital
Driving to the lowest possible environmental footprint as we grow helps us create efficiencies, support our communities, and respond to 
the needs of our stakeholders. We invest in environmental projects and set company-wide environmental targets to drive reductions in 
greenhouse gas emissions, energy and water use, and waste generation. We build energy efficiency into our products to help our 
customers lower their own emissions, energy usage and costs, and we collaborate with policymakers and other stakeholders to use 
technology to address environmental challenges. 
In April 2022, we announced our new goal to reach net-zero greenhouse gas emissions in our operations by 2040, creating an important 
target to strengthen our commitment to sustainable business practices. Our 2030 RISE goals continue to be important milestones to drive 
to higher levels of operational efficiency, including a goal of a 10% reduction in our greenhouse gas emissions on an absolute basis by 
2030. We continue to take action on emissions reduction strategies focused on emissions abatement, additional investments in renewable 
electricity, process and equipment optimization, and energy conservation. Our RISE strategy also focuses on addressing climate change 
impacts upstream and downstream in the value chain. This includes improving product energy efficiency and increasing our "handprint"—
the ways in which Intel technologies can help others reduce their footprints, including Internet of Things solutions that enable intelligence 
in machines, buildings, supply chains, and factories, and make electrical grids smarter, safer, and more efficient. 
In Q3 2022, we completed our inaugural green bond issuance of $1.3 billion principal amount of senior notes. We are using the proceeds 
from the green bond offering to fund projects that support our investments in sustainable operations, which can include items such as 
green buildings, energy efficiency, circular economy and waste management, greenhouse gas emissions reductions, water stewardship, 
and renewable energy. The first annual green bond impact report will be published in 2023 to provide an update on the allocation of the 
net proceeds.
Energy
We focus on reducing our own climate change impact, and over the past two decades have reduced our direct and indirect greenhouse 
gas emissions associated with energy consumption. Through our RISE goals, we have committed to a goal of conserving 4 billion kWh of 
energy this decade. We have conserved approximately 973 million kWh1 of energy cumulatively since 2020. We also invest in renewable 
electricity and on-site alternative energy projects in support of our 2030 goal to achieve 100% renewable electricity use across our global 
operations. In 2022, continuing our practice of linking a portion of our executive and employee performance bonus to our corporate 
sustainability metrics, we linked a portion of the performance bonus to our 2022 target to reach 90% renewable electricity use globally. We 
reached our target and achieved approximately 91%1 renewable electricity usage globally in 2022.

Water Stewardship
Water is essential to the semiconductor manufacturing process. We use ultrapure water to remove impurities from our silicon wafers, and 
we use fresh and reclaimed water to run our manufacturing facility systems. Through our RISE goals, we have committed to achieve net 
positive water globally, and as part of that effort, conserve 60 billion gallons of water in this decade. Water conservation reduces the 
amount of water needed from fresh water sources; we have conserved approximately 26.2 billion gallons1 of water and enabled 
restoration of approximately 6.6 billion gallons1 of water since 2020. In 2022, we linked a portion of our executive and employee 
performance bonus to our targets to conserve 8.5 billion gallons of water and restore 2.5 billion gallons of water to local watersheds, both 
of which we achieved.
Circular Economy and Waste Management
We have long been committed to waste management, recycling, and circular economy strategies that enable the recovery and productive 
re-use of waste streams. Our 2030 goals include a target of zero total waste2 to landfill, as well as implementation of circular economy 
strategies for 60% of our manufacturing waste streams in partnership with our suppliers. We continue to focus on opportunities to upcycle 
waste by improving waste segregation practices and collaborating with our suppliers to evaluate new technologies for waste recovery.
Governance and Disclosure
We are committed to transparency around our carbon footprint and climate risk, and use the framework developed by the TCFD to inform 
our disclosure on climate governance, strategy, risk management, and metrics and targets. For governance and strategy, we follow an 
integrated approach to address climate change, with multiple teams responsible for managing climate-related activities, initiatives, and 
policies, with senior-level management involvement and board-level oversight, including the Corporate Governance and Nominating 
Committee. We describe our overall risk management processes in our Proxy Statement, and describe our climate-related risks and 
opportunities in our annual Corporate Responsibility Report, the Intel Climate Change Policy, and "Risk Factors" within this Form 10-K. In 
addition to what is included within this Form 10-K, information about and progress toward our RISE goals is included in our Corporate 
Responsibility Report. Our Corporate Responsibility Report also includes a mapping of our disclosure to the TCFD and SASB frameworks. 
The Corporate Responsibility Report and our CDP Climate Change Survey are available on our website and are published annually.3

Market and Business Overview
Market Trends and Strategy
In 2022, the PC business experienced one of the most challenging years in recent history, resulting from a softening macroeconomic 
environment and inflationary pressures. Despite these headwinds in 2022—which resulted in a double-digit TAM decline1—PC usage 
remains strong, demonstrating the increased utility and value of the PC and we believe ultimately supporting a TAM well above pre-
pandemic levels, once this period of adjustment subsides. The significant behavior changes that took shape amid the pandemic solidified 
the PC as an essential tool in people's lives.   
PC density, including PCs per household, increased during the pandemic, which irreversibly changed the way we focus, create, connect, 
and care for each other2. In addition, the installed base of PCs per student continues to grow compared to pre-pandemic levels. 
Commercial growth opportunities also remain as corporations expand the size of their PC fleets, while also replacing older devices. 
Currently, approximately 200 million commercial devices are more than four years old3. The experience and capabilities delivered on new 
PCs are dramatically better today, reinforcing the opportunity to drive a refresh cycle among enterprise customers.
As we continue on our strategy to develop more competitive products and more capabilities for customers, we are designing our product 
roadmap to drive product leadership grounded in a philosophy of openness and choice. We deliver value to our customers by leveraging 
our engineering capabilities and working with our partners across an open, innovative ecosystem to deliver technology that drives every 
major vector of the computing experience, including performance, battery life, connectivity, graphics, and form factors to create the most 
advanced PC platforms. 
Products and Competition
We released our 13th Gen Intel Core desktop processors, the second generation of our performance hybrid architecture, which combines 
efficient-cores and performance-cores to deliver performance and experiences that are scalable across all PC market segments. The 13th 
Gen processor family is expected to deliver uncompromised computing performance for every PC segment and out to the edge. In total, 
we expect to deliver more than 500 designs from partners across major multinational corporations and leading manufacturers.
We operate in a particularly competitive market. In processors, we compete with AMD and vendors who design applications processors 
based on ARM architecture, such as Qualcomm Inc. (Qualcomm), and, increasingly, Apple Inc. (Apple), with its M1 and M2 products. We 
expect this competitive environment to continue to intensify in 2023.
Our role as a technology leader is more important than ever, and our commitment to creating an open ecosystem is critical to delivering 
on our ambition. This is why we embrace and collaborate with a vibrant ecosystem of OEM partners to identify innovation vectors and 
deliver leadership technologies together. The breadth of a robust ecosystem like Microsoft Windows/x86 is a powerful combination, 
bringing together hundreds of companies around the globe and creative and innovative advancements that are not possible for one 
company to deliver alone.
Unique to Intel, we innovate beyond the CPU to deliver premium PC experiences with Intel Evo and Intel vPro platforms. More than 150 
advanced laptop designs have been built on the Intel Evo platform, and we test and verify these to confirm they deliver key experience 
indicators such as responsiveness, battery life, instant wake, and connectivity. Intel vPro is designed for enterprise needs and delivers 
increased productivity improvements, connectivity, security features, and remote manageability.
Through our efforts to increase internal and external capacity, supply availability for our products has improved, which enables us to 
service our customers in a more consistent and responsive manner. We have also seen near-term improvements in industry-wide 
constraints, which include improvements in third-party component availability and a stabilization of lead times for those components. We 
remain committed to further remove bottlenecks of third-party components and prepare for longer term demand growth.

Market and Business Overview
Market Trends and Strategy
While the automotive industry has moderately recovered from the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic and from acute supply chain 
shortages, with approximately 6% growth in global vehicle production year over year, production in 2022 was still roughly 8% below 2019 
levels. We expect ADAS volumes to continue to grow faster than overall global vehicle production in the coming years and anticipate long-
term ADAS growth from continued increases in the percentage of vehicles that are equipped with basic ADAS features from the factory. In 
addition to potential volume growth, our portfolio of advanced solutions has the potential to drive higher average system price over time.
Beyond ADAS solutions, we believe that the availability of AVs will cause a significant transformation in mobility, including vehicle 
ownership and utilization. We expect that AV technology will eventually be accessed by consumers through shared-vehicle MaaS 
networks and in consumer-owned and operated AVs. We are pursuing this market trend by using our eyes-on/hands-off Mobileye 
SuperVision* solution as a baseline to scale to our eyes-off/hands-off Chauffeur* consumer AV product in a variety of operational design 
domains. As it relates to AMaaS, we intend to primarily go to market by supplying Mobileye Drive* self-driving system to transportation 
network companies, public transit operators, and suppliers of AV-ready vehicle platforms. In some cases, we expect to bundle our 
Mobileye Drive self-driving system with Moovit’s urban mobility and transit intelligence application and its global user base.
Products and Competition
We currently ship a variety of ADAS solutions to a large number of global automakers. We are recognized for our top-rated safety 
solutions globally, and since 2007, we have introduced numerous industry-first ADAS products. 
We are building a robust portfolio of end-to-end ADAS and autonomous driving solutions to provide the capabilities needed for the future 
of autonomous driving, leveraging a comprehensive suite of purpose-built software and hardware technologies. We pioneered “base” 
ADAS features to enhance vehicle safety and to meet global regulatory requirements and safety ratings with our driver assist solution and 
we have since created new categories of ADAS with our cloud-enhanced driver assist and premium driver assist offerings such as 
Mobileye SuperVision*. By leveraging Mobileye SuperVision’s full-surround computer vision and True Redundancy*, we are developing 
Chauffeur, our consumer AV solution and Mobileye Drive, our Level 4 autonomous driving solution designed for fleet deployment. Though 
our current offerings to Tier 1 and OEM customers do not include cameras, radars, lidar systems, or other sensors (except in particular 
cases), we have radar and lidar products that are currently in advanced development stages, which we intend to offer to customers in the 
future. 
The ADAS and autonomous driving industries are highly competitive. In the ADAS and consumer AV market, we face competition primarily 
from other external providers, including Tier 1 automotive suppliers and silicon providers, and in-house solutions developed by OEMs. Our 
Tier 1 customers may be developing or may in the future develop competing solutions. In the autonomous driving market, including 
AMaaS and consumer AV, we face competition from technology companies; internal development teams from the automakers 
themselves, sometimes in combination with investments in early-stage autonomous vehicle technology companies, Tier 1 automotive 
companies, and robotaxi providers.

Market and Business Overview
Market Trends and Strategy
The chip industry is undergoing a structural transformation driven by:
▪
The digitization of everything, accelerated by the five superpowers: compute, pervasive connectivity, cloud-to-edge infrastructure,
AI, and sensing.
▪
A generational shift in computer architectures: a move from SoC to chiplets, increased tailoring of chips to workloads, and
instruction set diversification.
▪
The vertical integration into chip making by OEMs and CSPs.
▪
Increasing costs of R&D and capacity for advanced node technologies.
▪
Supply chain risk highlighted by the pandemic and geo-political issues.
These transformation trends are driving significant semiconductor market growth in leading-edge advanced nodes driven by Mobile, 
Compute, and Automotive applications. The increasing heterogeneity of chips increases the complexity of designing chips with optimized 
PPAC that are manufacturable with high yield. Additionally, integrating these diverse chips into systems becomes more complex and 
requires optimized interconnects and a software stack that can easily accept this diversity of chips without compromising PPAC. This is 
causing a paradigm shift from focusing on optimizing devices to focusing on optimizing the system, known as system technology co-
optimization. In this new paradigm, customers require solutions that address every layer of the application stack, rather than just the chip 
itself.  
Additionally, the COVID-19 pandemic and recent geo-political issues have highlighted the world’s dependence on semiconductors and the 
vulnerable supply chain that underpins the industry. Approximately 88% of the world’s semiconductor manufacturing capacity is in Asia, 
and only 4.5% is in the US1. 
Products and Competition
We seek to address this tectonic shift in the industry by creating an open system foundry that enables our customers to lead in their 
industries by creating full-stack solutions from their choice of the best of Intel and the ecosystem. The open system foundry has four 
components: wafer fabrication, packaging, chiplet standard, and software. The open system foundry involves engaging with customers at 
multiple levels, from basic wafer manufacturing to helping define and implement their desired system architecture. We intend to build our 
customers' silicon design and deliver full end-to-end capabilities to produce their products, built with our advanced packaging technology 
and delivered from a resilient, geo-diverse and sustainable source of supply.  
The foundation of our IFS strategy is a world-class foundry offering consisting of process technologies complemented by a robust 
ecosystem for IP, EDA, and design services. Chips created with IFS can be packaged using our advanced packaging technologies or by 
OSATs and connected by optimized interconnects that we will help drive as standard for the industry, such as, UCIe. We expect to 
accelerate our customers' designs by providing services and software that leverage our vast experience in designing systems of chips, 
and by providing cores from Intel and the ecosystem that are optimized for Intel process technologies. The combination of cores and 
accelerators can be seamlessly integrated into systems using oneAPI. These offerings will accelerate customer time to value with PPAC-
optimized systems delivered from a reliable supply chain. 
Our competitors are mostly pure-play foundries that focus on delivering a pure-play foundry offering from fabrication plants based in Asia. 
Of the five major semiconductor foundries, Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Corporation (TSMC), Samsung, Global Foundries (GF), 
United Microelectronics Corporation (UMC) and Semiconductor Manufacturing International Corporation, only Samsung is an IDM and 
foundry, and only GF is headquartered in the US. TSMC and Samsung are the only companies with advanced technologies below 10nm, 
and TSMC leads the market with 53% market share, followed by Samsung at 18% in 20212. Neither Samsung nor TSMC currently offer its 
most advanced nodes outside of Asia and both have limited advanced-node capacity in the US. 
We believe the open system foundry model will deliver differentiated capabilities to help our customers lead in their industries while 
bringing stability to the global semiconductor supply chain. The interest we are seeing from customers demonstrates that our strategy and 
offerings are resonating, and we look to continue to build on this in 2023 and in prospective periods.

2022
2022 results were impacted by an uncertain macroeconomic environment, with slowing consumer and enterprise demand, persistent 
inflation, and higher interest rates, which we believe impacts our target markets and creates a high level of uncertainty with our 
customers. We expect the macroeconomic uncertainty and the challenging market environment will extend into 2023.
2022 vs. 2021
2022 revenue was $63.1 billion, down $16.0 billion, or 20%, from 2021. CCG revenue was down 23% from 2021 due to lower notebook 
and desktop volume in the consumer and education market segments, and lower revenue due to the continued ramp down from the exit 
of our 5G smartphone modem business and lower demand for our wireless and connectivity products. Notebook volume decreased, 
driven by lower demand in the consumer and education market segments, while ASPs increased due to the resulting product mix. 
Desktop volume decreased, driven by lower demand in the consumer and education market segments while ASPs increased due to an 
increased mix of commercial products. DCAI revenue decreased 15% from 2021 due to lower server demand from enterprise customers, 
and due to customers tempering purchases to reduce existing inventories in a softening data center market. The decrease was partially 
offset by higher revenue from our FPGA business. Server ASPs decreased due to customer and product mix. NEX revenue increased 
11% from 2021, driven by higher Ethernet ASPs and increased demand for 5G products, partially offset by lower demand for Network 
Xeon. Mobileye revenue increased 35% from 2021, primarily driven by higher demand for EyeQ products and Mobileye Supervision* 
systems. The decrease in our "all other" revenue was due to revenue from the divested NAND memory business of $4.3 billion recognized 
in 2021, for which historical results are recorded in “all other,” and $584 million of revenue recognized in 2021 from a prepaid customer 
supply agreement.
Incentives offered to certain customers to accelerate purchases and to strategically position our products with customers for market 
segment share purposes, particularly in CCG, contributed approximately $1.7 billion to our revenue during Q4 2022, the impacts of which 
were contemplated in our financial guidance for Q1 2023, as included in our Form 8-K dated January 26, 2023. We expect CCG demand 
in Q1 2023 to be impacted as customers work through additional inventory.
2021 vs. 2020
2021 revenue was $79.0 billion, up $1.2 billion, or 1%, from 2020. NEX revenue increased 12% from 2020, primarily driven by higher 
demand for edge products amid recovery from the economic impacts of COVID-19 as well as a recovery in cloud networking revenue, 
partially offset by a reduction in the 5G networking volume from elevated levels in 2020. CCG revenue was up 1% from 2020, due to 
higher notebook and desktop volume driven by consumer and commercial recovery from COVID-19 lows, partially offset by lower revenue 
due to the continued ramp down from the exit of our 5G smartphone modem business. Notebook ASPs decreased due to the resulting 
product mix from higher demand in the consumer and education market segments, while desktop ASPs increased driven by commercial 
recovery from COVID-19. Mobileye revenue increased 43% from 2020, driven by improvement in global vehicle production, recovery from 
the economic impacts of COVID-19, and increasing adoption of ADAS. DCAI revenue decreased 3% from 2020 due to lower server 
revenue, partially offset by increased revenue from other DCAI products. Server volume decreased due to an increasingly competitive 
environment, partially offset by recovery in government and broader market products.

In 2022, we made, and in the next several years we expect to continue to make, capital investments in furtherance of our IDM 2.0 
strategy. As of December 31, 2022, our capital investments classified as construction in progress totaled $36.7 billion. These assets are 
ready for use but have not yet been placed into service and have not yet begun depreciating. As these construction in progress assets are 
placed into service, we expect to incur depreciation expense that impacts future production costs and, ultimately, cost of sales. To the 
extent we are unable to grow our revenues to offset these production costs, our gross margin and operating income will be unfavorably 
affected. Additionally, we could incur asset impairments on property, plant and equipment assets if our IDM 2.0 strategy is not successful.
Effective January 2023, we increased the estimated useful life of certain production machinery and equipment from 5 years to 8 years. We 
made this change to better reflect the economic value of our machinery and equipment over time. We considered several factors in 
making this determination, including current usage and expected re-use of machinery and equipment, changes in machinery and 
equipment technology, future planned cadence between node transitions, a shift to longer duration on trailing-edge technologies, and 
overall changes in our technology roadmap. Our analysis supported a change in useful life and is consistent with the execution of our IDM 
2.0 strategy. This change in estimate will be applied prospectively beginning Q1 2023. When compared to the estimated useful life in 
place as of the end of 2022, we expect total depreciation expense in 2023 to be reduced by as much as $4.2 billion. We expect this 
change will result in an approximately $2.6 billion increase to gross margin, a $400 million decrease in R&D expenses, and a $1.2 billion 
decrease in ending inventory values.
Operating Expenses
Total R&D and MG&A expenses for 2022 were $24.5 billion, up 13% compared to 2021. These expenses represent 38.9% of revenue for 
2022 and 27.5% of revenue for 2021. In support of our strategy, we continue to make significant investments to accelerate our process 
technology roadmap. This requires increased investments in R&D and continued focused efforts to attract and retain talent. In the second 
half of 2022, we implemented certain cost-cutting measures, including a slower pace of hiring and other restructuring actions, while at the 
same time continued to improve our product execution in response to the continued decline in the broader macroeconomic environment.

In the third quarter of 2022, the 2022 Restructuring Program was approved to rebalance our workforce and operations to create 
efficiencies and improve our product execution in alignment with our strategy. We expect that our 2022 Restructuring Plan, in conjunction 
with other initiatives, will reduce our cost structure and allow us to reinvest certain of these cost savings in resources and capacity to 
develop, manufacture, market, sell, and deliver our products in furtherance of our strategy. We expect these actions to be substantially 
completed by the end of 2023, but this is subject to change. 
Litigation charges and other includes a $1.2 billion benefit in 2022 from the annulled penalty related to an EC fine that was recorded and

Gains (Losses) on Equity Investments, Net 
Ongoing mark-to-market adjustments recognized in 2022 and 2021 were primarily driven by our investment in Montage Technology, Co. 
Ltd. (Montage); mark-to-market adjustments recognized in 2020 were primarily driven by our investments in Montage and Cloudera. We 
sold our interest in Cloudera in 2020. 
In 2021, we recognized $471 million in observable price adjustments related to our investment in Beijing Unisoc Technology Ltd.
In 2022, the sale of McAfee Corp. (McAfee) consumer business was completed and we received $4.6 billion in cash for the sale of our 
remaining share of McAfee, recognizing a $4.6 billion gain in Sale of equity investments and other. In 2021, we recognized McAfee 
dividends of $1.3 billion, which included a special dividend of $1.1 billion paid in connection with the sale of McAfee's enterprise business, 
and recognized $228 million related to the partial sale of our investment in McAfee. We recognized McAfee dividends of $126 million in 
2020.
In 2022, we also recognized $278 million of initial fair value adjustments in Sale of equity investments and other related to five companies 
that went public; in 2021, we recognized $447 million of initial fair value adjustments related to four companies that went public; in 2020, 
we recognized $1.1 billion from Montage becoming marketable and $606 million related to four other equity investments that went public. 
Interest and Other, Net
In 2022, we recognized a gain of $1.0 billion from the first closing of the divestiture of our NAND memory business.

Our effective tax rate decreased in 2022 compared to 2021, primarily driven by a higher proportion of our income being taxed in non-US 
jurisdictions and a change in tax law from 2017 Tax Reform related to the capitalization of R&D expenses that went into effect in January 
2022. In 2022 we recognized a benefit from taxes as compared to a provision for taxes in 2021 as the higher proportion of our income 
being taxed in non-US jurisdictions and the change in tax law from 2017 Tax Reform were only partially offset by the tax costs associated 
with the gains recognized from the equity sale of McAfee and the divestiture of our NAND memory business.
Our effective tax rate decreased in 2021 compared to 2020, primarily driven by one-time tax benefits due to the restructuring of certain 
non-US subsidiaries as well as a higher proportion of our income in non-US jurisdictions. As a result of the restructuring, we established 
deferred tax assets and released the valuation allowances of certain foreign deferred tax assets. The majority of these deferred tax assets 
established in 2021 fully offset the deferred tax liabilities recognized in 2020 driven by a change in our permanent reinvestment assertion 
with respect to undistributed earnings in China, as a result of our divestiture of our NAND memory business.

Liquidity and Capital Resources
We believe we have sufficient sources of funding to meet our business requirements for the next 12 months and in the longer term. Cash 
generated by operations, supplemented by our total cash and investments1, is our primary source of liquidity for funding our strategic 
business requirements. Our short-term funding requirements include capital expenditures for worldwide manufacturing and assembly and 
test, including investments in our process technology roadmap; working capital requirements; and potential and pending acquisitions, 
strategic investments, and dividends. This includes a commitment of $5.4 billion associated with our pending acquisition of Tower. See 
“Note 10: Acquisitions and Divestitures” within the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further information. Our long-term 
funding requirements incrementally contemplate investments in significant manufacturing expansion plans and investments to accelerate 
our process technology. These plans include an investment to build two new fabs in Arizona and capacity expansions in Ohio and Europe 
and involve utilizing SCIP and smart capacity investments, both elements of our Smart Capital strategy. We also expect to benefit from 
government incentives; any incentives above our current expectations would enable us to increase the pace and size of our investments. 
Conversely, incentives below our expectations would increase our anticipated cash requirements. We expect our planned capital 
investments to continue to put pressure on our adjusted free cash flow in the short term.
As we invest in multiple expansions, we expect our capital expenditures to continue to be higher than historical levels for the next several 
years. We expect to adjust the cadence of our investments based on the execution of our roadmap and changing business conditions. As 
of December 31, 2022, we had commitments for capital expenditures of $22.7 billion for 2023 and had $8.3 billion in capital expenditures 
committed in the long term. As of December 31, 2022, other purchase obligations and commitments in 2022 under our binding 
commitments for purchases of goods and services were $3.1 billion, with an additional $7.6 billion committed in the long term.
Additionally, as we have faced industry shortages of substrates and other components, we have increasingly entered into long-term 
agreements with suppliers and foundry service providers, some of which involve prepayments that will help us secure future supply. These 
prepayments accelerate cash outflows into the near term, and we expect to apply the prepayments to future purchases, resulting in a 
positive impact on our liquidity in subsequent periods. 
We have additional obligations as part of our ordinary course of business, beyond those committed for capital expenditures and other 
purchase obligations and commitments for purchases of goods and services. For example, see "Note 19: Commitments and 
Contingencies" within the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for information about our lease obligations, which include supply 
agreements structured as leases, "Note 8: Income Taxes" within the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for information about our 
tax obligations including impacts from Tax Reform enacted in 2017 for the one-time transition tax on previously untaxed foreign earnings, 
and "Note 13: Borrowings" within the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for information about our debt obligations. The expected 
timing of payments of our obligations is estimated based on current information. Timing of payments and actual amounts paid may be 
different, depending on the timing of receipt of goods or services, or changes to agreed-upon amounts for some obligations. In addition, 
some of our purchasing requirements are not current obligations and are therefore not included in the amounts above. For example, some 
of these requirements are not handled through binding contracts or are fulfilled by vendors on a purchase order basis within short time 
horizons.
When assessing our current sources of liquidity, we include our total cash and investments1 as shown in the following table:

Other potential sources of liquidity include our commercial paper program and our automatic shelf registration statement on file with the 
SEC, pursuant to which we may offer an unspecified amount of debt, equity, other securities, and non-recourse factoring arrangements 
with third-party financial institutions. Under our commercial paper program, we have an ongoing authorization from our Board of Directors 
to borrow up to $10.0 billion and, as of December 31, 2022, we had $3.9 billion of commercial paper obligations outstanding. During 2022, 
we issued a total of $6.0 billion aggregate principal amount of senior notes, including our inaugural green bond issuance of $1.3 billion 
principal amount. We are using the proceeds from the green bond offering to fund projects that support our investments in sustainable 
operations. We intend to use the proceeds from the remainder of the offering for general corporate purposes, including, but not limited to, 
refinancing our outstanding debt and funding for working capital and capital expenditures. We received proceeds of $600 million in the 
aggregate from the sale of bonds issued by the Industrial Development Authority of the City of Chandler, Arizona (CIDA). We amended 
our $5.0 billion variable-rate revolving credit facility, extending that maturity date by one year to March 2027 and transitioning the interest 
terms from LIBOR to term SOFR. In November 2022, we entered into a $5.0 billion, 364-day variable rate revolving credit facility. We 
repaid $1.6 billion of our senior notes that matured in May 2022; $1.0 billion due July 2022; $1.9 billion due December 2022; and 
$400 million due November 2023. We settled $138 million bonds issued by the Oregon Business Development Commission in March 
2022. As of December 31, 2022, we had no borrowings outstanding on the revolving credit facilities.
Our sources of liquidity in 2022 also included total net proceeds of $1.0 billion from the completion of Mobileye's IPO in the fourth quarter 
of 2022, after which we retained 94% of Mobileye’s capital stock.
Our cash and investments and related cash flows may be affected by certain discretionary actions we may take with customers and 
suppliers to accelerate or delay certain cash receipts or payments to manage liquidity for our strategic business requirements. In the 
second half of 2022 these actions included, among others, negotiating with suppliers to optimize our payment terms and conditions, 
adjusting the timing of cash flows associated with customer sales programs and collections, managing inventory levels and purchasing 
practices, and selling certain of our accounts receivable on a non-recourse basis to third-party financial institutions. While such actions 
have benefited, and may further benefit, cash flow in the near term, we may experience a corresponding detriment to cash flow in future 
periods as these actions cease or as the impact of these actions reverse or normalize. 
Our cash flows for each period were as follows:

Operating Activities
Cash provided by operating activities is net income adjusted for certain non-cash items and changes in assets and liabilities.
For 2022 compared to 2021, the $14.0 billion decrease in cash provided by operating activities was primarily driven by lower 2022 net 
income after adjusting for non-cash items, including the gain on the sale of McAfee and the pre-tax gain from the divestiture of our NAND 
business; partially offset by 2022 cash-favorable working capital changes compared to 2021.
For 2021 compared to 2020, the $6.4 billion decrease in cash provided by operating activities was primarily driven by a decrease in net 
working capital contributions and cash paid to settle a prepaid customer supply agreement in Q1 2021, partially offset by a McAfee special 
dividend received in Q3 2021.
Investing Activities
Investing cash flows consist primarily of capital expenditures; investment purchases, sales, maturities, and disposals; cash used for 
acquisitions; and proceeds from divestitures. Our capital expenditures were $24.8 billion in 2022 ($18.7 billion in 2021 and $14.3 billion in 
2020). 
The decrease in cash used for investing activities in 2022 compared to 2021 was primarily due to increased maturities and sales of short-
term investments, proceeds from the divestiture of our NAND business, and proceeds from the sale of our remaining share of McAfee, 
partially offset by an increase in capital expenditures.
The increase in cash used for investing activities in 2021 compared to 2020 was primarily due to an increase in capital expenditures, 
partially offset by lower 2021 purchases of short-term investments, net of maturities and sales.
Financing Activities
Financing cash flows consist primarily of payment of dividends to stockholders, issuance and repayment of short-term and long-term debt, 
repurchases of common stock, and proceeds from the sale of shares of common stock through employee equity incentive plans.
MD&A
46


Cash provided by financing activities in 2022 compared to cash used for financing activities in 2021 primarily due to higher commercial 
paper and debt issuances, our 2022 curtailment of common stock repurchases, proceeds from the Mobileye IPO, and partner 
contributions for joint investments; partially offset by higher 2022 debt repayments. Our total dividend payments were $6.0 billion in 2022 
compared to $5.6 billion in 2021. We have paid a cash dividend in each of the past 121 quarters. 
The decrease in cash used for financing activities in 2021 compared to 2020 was primarily due to a decrease in repurchases of common 
stock and a decrease in repayments of debt and debt conversions, partially offset by a decrease in cash provided by long-term debt 
issuances.
Critical Accounting Estimates
The methods, assumptions, and estimates that we use in applying our accounting policies may require us to apply judgments regarding 
matters that are inherently uncertain. We consider an accounting policy to be a critical estimate if: (1) we must make assumptions that 
were uncertain when the judgment was made, and (2) changes in the estimate assumptions, or selection of a different estimate 
methodology, could have a significant impact on our financial position and the results that we report in our Consolidated Financial 
Statements. While we believe that our estimates, assumptions, and judgments are reasonable, they are based on information available 
when the estimate was made.
Refer to "Note 2: Accounting Policies" within the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further information on our critical 
accounting estimates, which are as follows, as well as our significant accounting policies:
▪
Inventories—the transition of manufacturing costs to inventory, net of factory excess capacity costs. Inventory reflected at the lower of
cost or net realizable value considering forecasted future demand and market conditions;
▪
Long-lived assets—the valuation methods and assumptions used in assessing the impairment and evaluation of useful lives of
property, plant and equipment, identified intangibles, and impairment of goodwill, including the determination of asset groupings and
the identification and allocation of goodwill to reporting units;
▪
Non-marketable equity investments—the valuation estimates and assessment of impairment and observable price adjustments; and
▪
Loss contingencies—the estimation of when a loss is probable and reasonably estimable.
Non-GAAP Financial Measures
In addition to disclosing financial results in accordance with US GAAP, this document contains references to the non-GAAP financial 
measures below. We believe these non-GAAP financial measures provide investors with useful supplemental information about our 
operating performance, enable comparison of financial trends and results between periods where certain items may vary independent of 
business performance, and allow for greater transparency with respect to key metrics used by management in operating our business and 
measuring our performance. These non-GAAP financial measures are used in our performance-based RSUs and our cash bonus plans.
Starting in the first quarter of 2022, we incrementally exclude from our non-GAAP results share-based compensation and all gains and 
losses on equity investments. The adjustment for all gains and losses on equity investments includes the ongoing mark-to-market 
adjustments previously excluded from our non-GAAP results.
Our non-GAAP financial measures reflect adjustments based on one or more of the following items, as well as the related income tax 
effects where applicable. Income tax effects have been calculated using an appropriate tax rate for each adjustment, as applicable. These 
non-GAAP financial measures should not be considered a substitute for, or superior to, financial measures calculated in accordance with 
US GAAP, and the financial results calculated in accordance with US GAAP and reconciliations from these results should be carefully 
evaluated.
NAND memory 
business
We completed the first closing of the divestiture of our 
NAND memory business to SK hynix on December 29, 
2021 and fully deconsolidated our ongoing interests in 
the NAND OpCo Business in the first quarter of 2022.
We exclude the impact of our NAND memory business in 
certain non-GAAP measures. While the second closing 
of the sale is still pending and subject to closing 
conditions, we deconsolidated this business in Q1 2022 
and management does not view the historical results of 
the business as a part of our core operations. We believe 
these adjustments provide investors with a useful view, 
through the eyes of management, of our core business 
model and how management currently evaluates core 
operational performance. In making these adjustments, 
we have not made any changes to our methods for 
measuring and calculating revenue or other financial 
statement amounts.

Acquisition-related 
adjustments
Amortization of acquisition-related intangible assets 
consists of amortization of intangible assets such as 
developed technology, brands, and customer 
relationships acquired in connection with business 
combinations. Charges related to the amortization of 
these intangibles are recorded within both cost of sales 
and MG&A in our US GAAP financial statements. 
Amortization charges are recorded over the estimated 
useful life of the related acquired intangible asset, and 
thus are generally recorded over multiple years.
We exclude amortization charges for our acquisition-
related intangible assets for purposes of calculating 
certain non-GAAP measures because these charges are 
inconsistent in size and are significantly impacted by the 
timing and valuation of our acquisitions. These 
adjustments facilitate a useful evaluation of our current 
operating performance and comparison to our past 
operating performance and provide investors with 
additional means to evaluate cost and expense trends.
Share-based 
compensation
Share-based compensation consists of charges related 
to our employee equity incentive plans.
We exclude charges related to share-based 
compensation for purposes of calculating certain non-
GAAP measures because we believe these adjustments 
provide better comparability to peer company results and 
because these charges are not viewed by management 
as part of our core operating performance. We believe 
these adjustments provide investors with a useful view, 
through the eyes of management, of our core business 
model, how management currently evaluates core 
operational performance, and additional means to 
evaluate expense trends, including in comparison to 
other peer companies.
Patent settlement
A portion of the charge from our IP settlements 
represents a catch-up of cumulative amortization that 
would have been incurred for the right to use the related 
patents in prior periods. This charge related to prior 
periods is excluded from our non-GAAP results; 
amortization related to the right to use the patents in the 
current and ongoing periods is included.  
We exclude the catch-up charge related to prior periods 
for purposes of calculating certain non-GAAP measures 
because this adjustment facilitates comparison to past 
operating results and provides a useful evaluation of our 
current operating performance.
Optane inventory 
impairment
Beginning in 2022, we initiated the wind-down of our Intel 
Optane memory business.
We exclude these impairments for purposes of 
calculating certain non-GAAP measures because these 
charges do not reflect our current operating performance. 
This adjustment facilitates a useful evaluation of our 
current operating performance and comparisons to past 
operating results.
Restructuring and 
other charges
Restructuring charges are costs associated with a formal 
restructuring plan and are primarily related to employee 
severance and benefit arrangements. Other charges 
include a benefit in Q1 2022 related to the annulled EC 
fine, a charge in Q1 2021 related to the VLSI litigation, 
periodic goodwill and asset impairments, certain pension 
charges, and costs associated with restructuring activity.
We exclude restructuring and other charges, including 
any adjustments to charges recorded in prior periods, for 
purposes of calculating certain non-GAAP measures 
because these costs do not reflect our core operating 
performance. These adjustments facilitate a useful 
evaluation of our core operating performance and 
comparisons to past operating results and provide 
investors with additional means to evaluate expense 
trends.
(Gains) losses on 
equity 
investments, net
(Gains) losses on equity investments, net consists of 
ongoing mark-to-market adjustments on marketable 
equity securities, observable price adjustments on non-
marketable equity securities, related impairment charges, 
and the sale of equity investments and other.
We exclude these non-operating gains and losses for 
purposes of calculating certain non-GAAP measures 
because it provides better comparability between 
periods. The exclusion reflects how management 
evaluates the core operations of the business.
Gains (losses) 
from divestiture
Gains (losses) are recognized at the close of a 
divestiture, or over a specified deferral period when 
deferred consideration is received at the time of closing. 
Based on our ongoing obligation under the NAND wafer 
manufacturing and sale agreement entered into in 
connection with the first closing of the sale of our NAND 
memory business on December 29, 2021, a portion of 
the initial closing consideration was deferred and will be 
recognized between first and second closing.
We exclude gains or losses resulting from divestitures for 
purposes of calculating certain non-GAAP measures 
because they do not reflect our current operating 
performance. These adjustments facilitate a useful 
evaluation of our current operating performance and 
comparisons to past operating results.

Tax Reform 
Adjustments for Tax Reform reflect the impact of a 
change in tax law from 2017 Tax Reform related to the 
capitalization of R&D costs.
We exclude the impacts of this 2022 change in US tax 
treatment of R&D costs for purposes of calculating 
certain non-GAAP measures as we believe these 
adjustments facilitate a better evaluation of our current 
operating performance and comparison to past operating 
results.
Adjusted free cash 
flow
We reference a non-GAAP financial measure of adjusted 
free cash flow, which is used by management when 
assessing our sources of liquidity, capital resources, and 
quality of earnings. Adjusted free cash flow is operating 
cash flow adjusted for (1) additions to property, plant and 
equipment, net of proceeds from capital grants and 
partner contributions, (2) payments on finance leases, 
and (3) proceeds from the McAfee equity sale.
This non-GAAP financial measure is helpful in 
understanding our capital requirements and sources of 
liquidity by providing an additional means to evaluate the 
cash flow trends of our business. Since the 2017 
divestiture, McAfee equity distributions and sales have 
contributed to operating and free cash flow, and while the 
McAfee equity sale in Q1 2022 would typically be 
excluded from adjusted free cash flow as an equity sale, 
we believe including the sale proceeds in adjusted free 
cash flow facilitate a better, more consistent comparison 
to past presentations of liquidity.
Total cash and 
investments
Total cash and investments is used by management 
when assessing our sources of liquidity, which include 
cash and cash equivalents, short-term investments, and 
loans receivable and other.
This non-GAAP measure is helpful in understanding our 
capital resources and liquidity position.

Other Key Information
Sales and Marketing
Customers
We sell our products primarily to OEMs, ODMs, and cloud service providers. ODMs provide design and manufacturing services to 
branded and unbranded private-label resellers. In addition, our customers include other manufacturers and service providers, such as 
industrial and communication equipment manufacturers and other cloud service providers who buy our products through distributor, 
reseller, retail, and OEM channels throughout the world. For more information about our customers, including customers who accounted 
for greater than 10% of our net consolidated revenue, see "Note 3: Operating Segments" within the Notes to Consolidated Financial 
Statements.
Our worldwide reseller sales channel consists of thousands of indirect customers—systems builders that purchase Intel processors and 
other products from our distributors. Certain of our microprocessors and other products are also available in direct retail outlets.
Sales Arrangements
Our products are sold through distribution channels throughout the world. Sales of our products are frequently made via purchase order 
acknowledgments that contain standard terms and conditions covering matters such as pricing, payment terms, and warranties, as well as 
indemnities for issues specific to our products, such as patent and copyright indemnities. Because our customers generally order from us 
on a purchase order basis, they can typically cancel, change, or delay product purchase commitments with little or no notice to us and 
without penalty. From time to time, we may enter into additional agreements with customers covering, for example, changes from our 
standard terms and conditions, new product development and marketing, and private-label branding. Our sales are routinely made using 
electronic and web-based processes that allow customers to review inventory availability and track the progress of specific goods 
ordered. Pricing on particular products may vary based on volumes ordered and other factors. We also offer discounts, rebates, and other 
incentives to customers to increase acceptance of our products and technology.
In accordance with contract terms, the revenue for combined performance obligations and standalone product sales is recognized at the 
time of product shipment from our facilities or delivery to the customer location, as determined by the agreed-upon shipping terms. Our 
standard terms and conditions of sale typically provide that payment is due at a later date, usually 30 days after shipment or delivery. We 
assess credit risk through quantitative and qualitative analysis. From this analysis, we establish shipping and credit limits and determine 
whether we will seek to use one or more credit support protection devices, such as obtaining a parent guarantee, standby letter of credit, 
or credit insurance. Credit losses may still be incurred due to bankruptcy, fraud, or other failure of the customer to pay. 
Our sales to distributors are typically made under agreements allowing for price protection on unsold merchandise and a right of return on 
stipulated quantities of unsold merchandise. Under the price protection program, we give distributors credits for the difference between 
the original price paid and the current price that we offer. Our products typically have no contractual limit on the amount of price 
protection, nor is there a limit on the time horizon under which price protection is granted. The right of return granted generally consists of 
a stock rotation program in which distributors can exchange certain products based on the number of qualified purchases made by the 
distributor. 
Distribution
Distributors typically handle a wide variety of products, including those that compete with our products, and fill orders for many customers. 
Customers may place orders directly with us or through distributors. We have several distribution warehouses that are located in proximity 
to key customers.
Seasonal Trends
Historically, our net revenue has typically been higher in the second half of the year than in the first half of the year, accelerating in the 
third quarter and peaking in the fourth quarter. In 2021, continued strong COVID-driven notebook demand in the first half of the year 
contributed to a flatter trend than we historically observe. In 2022, we had a flatter trend than we historically observe as we experienced 
the uncertainty and impacts, including demand volatility and supply chain disruption, of current macroeconomic conditions, the potential 
for a recession, and the risk for continued COVID-related disruptions or shutdowns.
Marketing
Our global marketing objectives are to build a strong, well-known, differentiated, and meaningful Intel corporate brand that drives 
preference with businesses and consumers, and to offer a limited number of meaningful and valuable brands in our portfolio to aid 
businesses and consumers in making informed choices about technology purchases. The Intel Core processor family and the Intel Atom, 
Celeron®, Pentium®, Intel® Movidius™, and Intel Xeon trademarks make up our key CPU brands. This year, we introduced the Intel® Max 
Series product family with two leading-edge products for high-performance computing (AI): the Intel Xeon CPU Max Series (also known 
as Sapphire Rapids HBM) and Intel Data Center GPU Max Series (also known as Ponte Vecchio).

Other Key Information


We promote brand awareness and preference and generate demand through our own direct marketing, as well as through co-marketing 
programs. Our direct marketing activities primarily include advertising through digital and social media and television, as well as consumer 
and trade events, industry and consumer communications, and press relations. We market to consumer and business audiences and 
focus on building awareness and generating demand for our products. Our key messaging focuses on increased performance, improved 
energy efficiency, and other capabilities such as connectivity.
Certain customers participate in cooperative advertising and marketing programs. These cooperative advertising and marketing programs 
broaden the reach of our brands beyond the scope of our own direct marketing. Certain customers are licensed to place Intel® logos on 
computing devices containing our microprocessors and processor technologies, and to use our brands in their marketing activities. The 
program partially reimburses customers for marketing activities for products featuring Intel brands, subject to customers meeting defined 
criteria. These marketing activities primarily include advertising through digital and social media and television, as well as press relations. 
We have also entered into joint marketing arrangements with certain customers.
Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk
We are affected by changes in currency exchange and interest rates, as well as equity and commodity prices. Our risk management 
programs are designed to reduce, but may not eliminate, the impacts of these risks. All of the following potential changes are based on 
sensitivity analyses performed on our financial positions as of December 31, 2022 and December 25, 2021. Actual results may differ 
materially. 
Currency Exchange Rates
We are exposed to currency exchange risks of non-US-dollar-denominated investments in debt and equity instruments and loans 
receivable, and may economically hedge this risk with foreign currency contracts, such as currency forward contracts or currency interest 
rate swaps. Gains or losses on these non-US-currency investments are generally offset by corresponding losses or gains on the related 
hedging instruments. 
Substantially all of our revenue is transacted in US dollars. However, a significant portion of our operating expenditures and capital 
purchases are incurred in other currencies, primarily the Israeli shekel, the Malaysian ringgit, the European Union euro, the Japanese yen, 
and the Chinese yuan. We have established currency risk management programs to protect against currency exchange rate risks 
associated with non-US dollar forecasted future cash flows and existing non-US dollar monetary assets and liabilities. We may also hedge 
currency risk arising from funding of foreign currency-denominated future investments. We may utilize foreign currency contracts, such as 
currency forwards or option contracts in these hedging programs. We considered the historical trends in currency exchange rates and 
determined that it was reasonably possible that a weighted average adverse change of 10% in currency exchange rates could be 
experienced in the near term. Such an adverse change, after taking into account balance sheet hedges only and offsetting recorded 
monetary asset and liability positions outstanding as of December 31, 2022 and December 25, 2021, would result in an adverse impact on 
income before taxes of less than $64 million and less than $38 million, respectively.
Interest Rates
We are exposed to interest rate risk related to our fixed-rate investment portfolio and outstanding debt. The primary objective of our 
investment policy is to preserve principal and provide financial flexibility to fund our business while maximizing yields, which generally 
track the SOFR. We generally enter into interest rate contracts to convert the returns on our fixed-rate debt investment with remaining 
maturities longer than six months into SOFR-based returns. We also entered into swaps to convert fixed-rate coupon payments into 
floating-rate coupon payments for a portion of our existing indebtedness. Gains or losses on these instruments are generally offset by 
corresponding losses or gains on the related hedging instruments.
A hypothetical change in benchmark interest rates of 1%, after taking into account investment hedges, would have resulted in a change in 
the fair value of our investment portfolio of less than $100 million as of December 31, 2022 and as of December 25, 2021.
Taking into account floating-rate debt and fixed-rate debt that is swapped to floating-rate debt, a hypothetical increase in interest rates of 
1% would result in an increase in annual interest expense of approximately $120 million from debt outstanding as of December 31, 2022 
(a hypothetical increase of 1% would have resulted in an increase in annual interest expense of approximately $132 million from debt 
outstanding as of December 25, 2021). 
Equity Prices
We are exposed to equity market risk through our investments in marketable equity securities, which we typically do not attempt to reduce 
or eliminate through hedging activities. 
As of December 31, 2022, the fair value of our marketable equity securities was $1.3 billion ($2.2 billion as of December 25, 2021). The 
substantial majority of our marketable equity securities portfolio as of December 31, 2022 was concentrated in securities traded on the 
Chinese Shanghai Stock Exchange Science and Technology Innovation Board. To determine reasonably possible decreases in the market 
value of our marketable equity securities, we have analyzed the historical market price sensitivity of our portfolio. Assuming a decline of 
50% in market prices, the aggregate value of our marketable equity securities could decrease by approximately $670 million, based on 
the value as of December 31, 2022 (a decrease in value of approximately $1.3 billion, based on the value as of December 25, 2021 using 
an assumed decline of 60%).

We utilize total return swaps to offset changes in liabilities related to the equity market risks of certain deferred compensation 
arrangements. Gains or losses from changes in fair value of these total return swaps are generally offset by the losses or gains on the 
related liabilities.
Many of the same factors that could result in an adverse movement of equity market prices affect our non-marketable equity investments, 
although we cannot always quantify the impacts directly. Financial markets are volatile, which could negatively affect the prospects of the 
companies we invest in, their ability to raise additional capital, and the likelihood of our ability to realize value in our investments through 
liquidity events such as IPOs, mergers, and private sales. These types of investments involve a great deal of risk, and there can be no 
assurance that any specific company will grow or become successful; consequently, we could lose all or part of our investment. Our non-
marketable equity securities had a carrying amount of $4.6 billion as of December 31, 2022 ($4.1 billion as of December 25, 2021) and 
include our investment in Beijing Unisoc Technology Ltd. of $1.1 billion ($1.1 billion as of December 25, 2021). 
Commodity Price Risk
Although we operate facilities that consume commodities, we are not directly affected by commodity price risk to a material degree. We 
have established forecasted transaction risk management programs to protect against fluctuations in commodity prices. We may use 
commodity derivatives contracts, such as commodity swaps, in these hedging programs. In addition, we have sourcing plans in place that 
are designed to mitigate the risk of a potential supplier concentration for our key commodities. 
Risk Factors
The following summarizes the material factors that make an investment in our securities speculative or risky. When any one or more of the 
following risks materialize from time to time, our business, reputation, financial condition, cash flows, and results of operations can be 
materially and adversely affected, and the trading price of our common stock could decline. These risk factors do not identify all risks that 
we face; our operations can also be affected by factors that are not presently known to us or that we currently consider to be immaterial to 
our operations. Due to risks and uncertainties, known and unknown, our past financial results may not be a reliable indicator of future 
performance, and historical trends should not be used to anticipate results or trends in future periods. Refer also to the other information 
set forth in this Form 10-K, including in the MD&A and Financial Statements and Supplemental Details sections.
Changes in product demand can adversely affect our financial results. 
Demand for our products is variable and hard to predict. Our products are used in different market segments, and demand for our 
products varies within or among them. It is difficult to forecast these changes and their impact. For example, we expect the PC TAM to 
grow over time driven by factors such as a larger installed base, new platforms, shorter replacement cycles, and adoption in new markets; 
however, the PC industry has been highly cyclical in the past, and these growth expectations may not materialize, or we may fail to 
capitalize on them. Changes in the demand for our products, particularly our CCG, DCAI, and NEX platform products, have reduced and 
can in the future reduce our revenue, lower our gross margin, or require us to write down the value of our assets.
Important factors that lead to variation in the demand for our products include:
▪
business conditions, including downturns in the market segments in which we operate, or in global or regional economies;
▪
consumer confidence, income levels, and customer capital spending, which can be impacted by changes in market conditions,
including changes in government borrowing or spending, taxation, interest rates, the credit market, current or expected inflation,
employment, and energy or other commodity prices;
▪
geopolitical conditions, including trade policies;
▪
our ability to timely introduce competitive products;
▪
competitive and pricing pressures, including new product introductions and other actions taken by competitors;
▪
the level of our customers' inventories and computing capacity;
▪
customer order patterns and order cancellations, including as a result of maturing product cycles for our products, customers'
products, and related products such as operating system upgrade cycles; and disruptions affecting customers, such as the delays in
obtaining tools, components, and other supplies as a result of COVID-19-related port shutdowns in China that negatively impacted
demand for our business in 2022, as well as the industry substrate and component shortages that negatively impacted demand
across several of our businesses in 2021;
▪
market acceptance and industry support of our products and services, including the introduction and availability of software and other
products used together with our products, as well as our foundry services offerings through IFS; and
▪
customer product needs and emerging technology trends, including changes in the levels and nature of customer and end-user
computing workloads, such as work-, hybrid-, and learn-from-home trends.

Due to the complexity of our manufacturing operations, we are not always able to timely respond to fluctuations in demand and we may 
incur significant charges and costs. Because we own and operate high-tech fabrication facilities, our operations have high costs that are 
fixed or difficult to reduce in the short term, including our costs related to utilization of existing facilities, facility construction and 
equipment, R&D, and the employment and training of a highly skilled workforce. To the extent product demand decreases or we fail to 
forecast demand accurately, our gross margin and operating income can be disproportionately affected due to our high fixed cost 
structure, which is difficult to reduce in response to lower revenues. We could also be required to write off inventory or record excess 
manufacturing capacity charges, which would also lower our gross margin and operating income. To the extent the demand decrease is 
prolonged, our manufacturing or assembly and test capacity could be underutilized, and we may be required to write down our long-lived 
assets, which would increase our expenses. We may also be required to shorten the useful lives of under-used facilities and equipment 
and accelerate depreciation. As we continue to make substantial investments in increasing our manufacturing capacity as part of our IDM 
2.0 strategy, these underutilization risks may be heightened. Conversely, at times, demand increases or we fail to forecast accurately or 
produce the mix of products demanded. To the extent we are unable to add capacity or increase production fast enough, we are at times 
required to make production decisions and/or are unable to fully meet market demand, which can result in a loss of revenue opportunities 
or market share, legal claims, and/or damage to customer relationships. 
Our IDM 2.0 investments in capacity and our process technology roadmap require capital expenditures above our historical levels, and if 
demand for our IFS business grows rapidly, we anticipate that we would need to accelerate our planned investments to meet that 
demand. To the extent we do not generate expected cash flows, we may be required to increase our use of external funding sources to 
fund our investments and operations, which may not be available on favorable terms or at all. Legislation in the US and EU has been 
adopted to provide government funding for semiconductor manufacturing expansions in those regions, but there is uncertainty as to the 
amounts and timing of funding we may receive and as to any restrictions on recipients. To the extent such funding is below our 
expectations, our anticipated cash requirements would increase. Our construction projects to expand capacity require available sources of 
labor, materials, and equipment. Increasing demand for such sources, including from other foundries; supply constraints, labor shortages, 
and other adverse market conditions; issues with permits or approvals; on-site incidents; and other construction issues arise from time to 
time and can result in significant delays and increased costs for our projects, as well as legal and reputational harm.
We face significant competition. The industry in which we operate is highly competitive and subject to rapid technological, geopolitical and 
market developments; changes in industry standards; changes in customer and end-user needs, expectations, and preferences; and 
frequent product introductions and improvements. When we do not anticipate or respond to these developments, our competitive position 
can weaken, and our products or technologies can become uncompetitive or obsolete. Our competitive environment has intensified, and 
we expect it to continue to do so in the future.
Our products primarily compete based on performance, energy efficiency, integration, ease-of-use, innovative design, features, workload 
optimization, price, quality, reliability, security, software ecosystem and developer support, time-to-market, reliable product roadmap 
execution, brand recognition, customer support and customization, and availability. The importance of these factors varies by product and 
market segment. For example, our competitors have introduced data center and client platform products with performance improvements 
and additional processor core counts that have contributed to an increasingly competitive environment. In our IOTG business within NEX, 
for example, interoperability, connectivity, safety, security, industrial use conditions, and long-life support are among the key competitive 
factors. To the extent our products do not meet our customers' requirements across these factors in an increasingly competitive 
landscape, our business and results of operation can be harmed.
We face intense competition across our product portfolio from companies offering platform products, such as AMD and Qualcomm; 
accelerator products such as GPUs, including those offered by NVIDIA; other accelerator products such as ASICs, application-specific 
standard products, and FPGAs; memory and storage products; connectivity and networking products; and other semiconductor products. 
Some of these competitors have developed or utilize competing computing architectures and platforms, such as the ARM architecture, 
and these architectures and platforms can produce beneficial network effects for competitors when an ecosystem of customers and 
application developers for such architectures and platforms grows at scale. For example, ARM-based products are being used in PCs and 
servers, which could lead to further development and growth of the ARM ecosystem. We also compete with internally developed 
semiconductors from OEMs, cloud service providers, and others, some of whom are customers. Some of these customers vertically 
integrate their own semiconductor designs with their software assets and/or customize their designs for specific computing workloads. For 
example, in 2020, Apple introduced PC products utilizing its own internally developed ARM-based semiconductor designs in place of our 
client CPUs, and we face increasing competition from Apple's products and ecosystem.
Most of our competitors rely on third-party foundries, such as TSMC or Samsung Electronics Co., Ltd., and subcontractors for 
manufacture and assembly and test of their semiconductor components and products. Manufacturing process improvements introduced 
by TSMC have contributed, and may continue to contribute, to increasingly competitive offerings by our competitors. While we have set 
out a process technology roadmap to attain future process performance-per-watt parity and leadership relative to TSMC, our plans are 
subject to a number of risks and we could fail to realize our goals, including due to changes in competitor technology roadmaps, changes 
affecting our projections regarding our technology or competing technology, and the risks described in the section "We are vulnerable to 
product and manufacturing-related risks." As an IDM, we have higher capital expenditures and R&D spending than many of our "fabless" 
competitors. We also face new sources of competition as a result of changes in industry participants through, for example, acquisitions or 
business collaborations, as well as new entrants, including in China, which could have a significant impact on our competitive position. For 
example, we could face increased competition as a result of China's programs to promote a domestic semiconductor industry and supply 
chains.

Introduction of competitive new products and technologies, aggressive pricing, and other actions taken by competitors can harm demand 
for our products, exert downward pricing pressure on our products, and adversely affect our business. For example, our DCAI revenue 
and platform ASPs were negatively impacted by the competitive environment during 2022 and 2021. Additionally, a number of business 
combinations and strategic partnerships in the semiconductor industry have occurred over the last several years, and more could occur in 
the future. For example, in 2022, Broadcom announced an agreement to acquire VMware, and AMD completed its acquisition of Xilinx, 
Inc. Consolidation could also lead to fewer customers, partners, or suppliers, any of which could negatively affect our financial results.
If we are not able to compete effectively, our financial results will be adversely affected, including reduced revenue and gross margin, and 
we may be required to accelerate the write-down of the value of certain assets.
We invest significantly in R&D, and to the extent our R&D efforts are unsuccessful, our competitive position can be harmed, and we may 
not realize a return on our investments. To compete successfully, we must maintain an effective R&D program, develop new products and 
manufacturing processes, and improve our existing products and processes, all ahead of competitors. Our R&D efforts intensely utilize 
our different forms of capital, and we incurred R&D expenses of $17.5 billion in 2022, $15.2 billion in 2021 and $13.6 billion in 2020. We 
are focusing our R&D efforts across several key areas, including process and packaging technology, our xPU products and features, and 
software. These include ambitious initiatives, such as our unified oneAPI portfolio of developer tools. We cannot guarantee that all of 
these efforts will deliver the benefits we anticipate. For example, we previously experienced significant delays in the implementation of our 
10nm process technology, and during 2020, we announced that our Intel 4 process technology (formerly 7nm) would be delayed relative 
to our prior expectations. To the extent we do not timely introduce new manufacturing process technologies that improve performance, 
performance per watt, and/or transistor density with sufficient manufacturing yields and operational efficiency, relative to competing 
foundry processes, we can face cost, product performance, and time-to-market disadvantages. In addition, periods of extended 
investment in R&D and operational strategy can impact our financial condition and planning and may result in periods of higher leverage, 
operating costs, borrowing costs, and pressure on our credit ratings. Further, we are not always able to timely or successfully develop new 
products, including as a result of bugs, late changes to features due to customer requests, or other design challenges. For example, in 
2022, we announced that the release of our Sapphire Rapids product would be delayed from the first half of 2022 to the second half of 
2022. To the extent our R&D efforts do not develop new products on schedule with improvements in areas like performance, performance 
per watt, die utilization, and core counts, and/or with new features such as optimizations for AI and other workloads, our competitive 
position can be harmed. We have adopted a disaggregated design approach for some of our future products, in which different processors 
and components can be manufactured on different processes and connected by advanced packaging technology into a single package. 
This approach introduces new areas of complexity in design and manufacturability, particularly in the deployment of advanced packaging 
technologies, several of which are novel, have a limited manufacturing history, and/or have increased costs. Delays or failures in 
implementing disaggregated designs could adversely affect our ability to timely introduce competitive products. For example, adapting a 
processor or component design for a new or different manufacturing process involves additional R&D expense and can result in delays in 
the development of the associated product and higher costs due to the utilization of more advanced and expensive capital equipment.
We do not expect all of our R&D investments to be successful. Some of our efforts to develop and market new products and technologies 
fail or fall short of our expectations, or are not well-received by customers, who may adopt competing technologies. We make significant 
investments in R&D, and our investments are growing as we pursue our IDM 2.0 strategy. Our investments at times do not contribute to 
our future operating results for several years, if at all, and such contributions at times do not meet our expectations or even cover the 
costs of such investments. 
Our investments in new businesses, products, and technologies are inherently risky and do not always succeed. We have entered new 
areas and introduced new products and services as we seek to capitalize on the opportunities presented by ubiquitous computing, cloud 
to edge infrastructure, pervasive connectivity, and AI. In recent years, we have expanded our product offerings in areas such as discrete 
GPUs, mobility solutions, AI accelerators, IPU products, and silicon photonics. As part of our IDM 2.0 strategy, we announced plans to 
establish IFS as a major provider of foundry capacity to manufacture semiconductors for others and to implement an internal foundry 
operating model through updates to our processes, systems, and guardrails between our manufacturing and our individual business units. 
IFS faces competition from well-established competitors such as TSMC and Samsung, and to succeed, we will need to compete 
effectively across factors such as availability and time-to-market of manufacturing technology; advances in manufacturing processes in 
areas such as performance, performance per watt, and density; manufacturing capacity; price; margin; ease of use; quality; yields; 
customer satisfaction; and ecosystem support. Our "big bets" are inherently risky and are not always successful. For example, in 2022, 
we wound down Intel Optane; in 2020, we agreed to sell our NAND memory business to SK hynix; and in 2019, we exited the 5G 
smartphone modem business--three of our prior big bets--based on our determination that there was no clear path to profitability for those 
businesses. 
These new and developing areas and products represent a significant portion of our revenue growth opportunity, and they also introduce 
new sources of competition, including, in some cases, incumbent competitors with established technologies, ecosystems, and customer 
bases, lower prices, margins, or costs, and greater brand recognition. These developing products and market segments require significant 
investment, do not always grow as projected or at all, or sometimes adopt competing technologies, and we may not realize an adequate 
return on our investments. For example, AI and machine learning are increasingly driving innovations in technology, but if we fail to 
develop leading products for these workloads, or if our customers use competing technologies, we may not realize a return on our 
investments in these areas. Similarly, while we see significant opportunity in networking infrastructure and the distribution of computing to 
the network edge, we expect intense competition for this opportunity and may not succeed in our efforts. To be successful, we need to 
cultivate relationships with customers and partners in these market segments and continue to improve our offerings. Despite our ongoing 
efforts, there is no guarantee that we will achieve or maintain market demand or acceptance for our products and services in these 
various market segments or realize an adequate return on our investments, which could lead to impairment of assets and restructuring 
charges, as well as opportunity costs.

Changes in the mix of products sold can materially impact our financial results. Our pricing and margins vary across our products and 
market segments due in part to marketability of our products and differences in their features or manufacturing costs. For example, our 
platform product offerings range from lower-priced and entry-level platforms, such as those based on Intel Atom processors, to higher-end 
platforms based on Intel Xeon processors. Our adjacent products also typically have significantly lower margins than our higher-priced 
platform products, and at times are not profitable. To the extent demand shifts from our higher-priced to lower-priced platform products in 
any of our market segments, or our adjacent products represent a greater share of our mix of products sold, our gross margin percentage 
has decreased and may decrease again.
We are vulnerable to product and manufacturing-related risks.
We are subject to risks associated with the development and implementation of new manufacturing technologies. Production of integrated 
circuits is a complex process. We are continually engaged in the development of next-generation process technologies at increasingly 
advanced nodes as we seek to realize the benefits of Moore's Law. Forecasting our progress and schedule for developing advanced 
nodes is challenging, and at times we encounter unexpected delays due to the complexity of interactions among steps in the 
manufacturing process, challenges in using new materials or new production equipment, and other issues. Diagnosing defects in our 
manufacturing processes often takes a long time, as manufacturing throughput times can delay our receipt of data about defects and the 
effectiveness of fixes, and defects can be more serious and difficult to resolve than initially understood. 
We are not always successful or efficient in developing or implementing new process nodes and manufacturing processes. We 
experienced significant delays in implementing our 10nm process technology, and in 2020, we encountered a defect mode in the 
development of our Intel 4 process technology (formerly 7nm) that resulted in delays relative to our prior expectations. In 2022, Sapphire 
Rapids was also delayed to build in more platform and product validation time. These delays have allowed competitors using third-party 
foundries such as TSMC to benefit from advancements in manufacturing processes introduced ahead of us by these competing foundries, 
including improvements in performance, energy efficiency, and other features, which have helped increase the competitiveness of their 
products. Because of these prior delays in our process technologies, we may experience greater adverse competitive impacts in the event 
of delays in the development of future manufacturing process technologies and products. 
Our efforts to innovate involve significant expense and carry inherent risks, including difficulties in designing and developing next-
generation process and packaging technologies, and investments in manufacturing assets and facilities that are made years in advance of 
the technology introduction. We cannot guarantee that we will realize the expected benefits of next-generation process technologies, 
including the expected cost, performance, power, and density advantages, or that we will achieve an adequate return on our capital and 
R&D investments, particularly as development of new nodes has grown increasingly expensive. In such circumstances, we may be 
required to write down the value of some of our manufacturing assets and facilities, increasing our expenses.
Risks inherent in the development of next-generation process technologies include production timing delays, lower-than-anticipated 
manufacturing yields, longer manufacturing throughput times, failure to achieve expected performance, power, and area improvements, 
and product defects and errata. Production timing delays have at times caused us to miss customer product design windows, which can 
result in lost revenue opportunities and damage to our customer relationships. Furthermore, when the introduction of next-generation 
process nodes is delayed, adding cores or other competitive features to our products can result in larger die size products, manufacturing 
supply constraints, and increased product costs. Lower manufacturing yields and longer manufacturing throughput times, compared to 
previous process nodes, can increase our product costs and adversely affect our gross margins, and can contribute to manufacturing 
supply constraints. A new process node typically has higher costs compared to a mature node due to factors that include higher 
depreciation costs and lower yields, and costs and yields at times do not improve at the same rate as on prior nodes. As the die size of 
our products has increased and our manufacturing process nodes have shrunk, our products and manufacturing processes have grown 
increasingly complex and more susceptible to product defects and errata, which at times also contribute to production timing delays and 
lower yields.
From time to time, disruptions in the production process result from errors; defects in materials; delays in obtaining or revising permits and 
licenses; interruptions in our supply of materials, resources, or production equipment; adverse changes in equipment productivity; and 
disruptions at our fabrication and assembly and test facilities due to accidents, maintenance issues, power interruptions, equipment 
malfunctions, or unsafe working conditions—all of which could affect the timing of production ramps and yields. Production issues 
periodically lead to increased costs and affect our ability to meet product demand, which can adversely impact our business and the 
results of operations. In addition, delays in our product introductions can cause us to become less competitive and lose revenue 
opportunities, and our gross margin could be adversely affected because we incur significant costs up front in a product's lifecycle stage 
and earn revenue to offset these costs over time.
We face supply chain risks. We have a highly complex global supply chain composed of thousands of suppliers. These suppliers provide 
direct materials for our production processes; supply tools, equipment, and IP (via licenses) for our factories; deliver logistics and 
packaging services; and supply software, lab and office equipment, and other goods and services used in our business. We also rely on 
suppliers to provide certain components for our products and to manufacture and assemble and test some of our components and 
products. From time to time, we are negatively impacted by supply chain issues, including:
▪
suppliers extending lead times, experiencing capacity constraints, limiting or canceling supply, allocating supply to other customers
including competitors, delaying or canceling deliveries, or increasing prices;
▪
supplier quality issues;
▪
cybersecurity events, IP or other litigation, manmade or natural disasters, operational failures, or other events that disrupt suppliers;
▪
long lead times to qualify alternate or additional suppliers, or the unavailability of qualified alternate suppliers; and
Other Key Information
56


▪
increased legislation, regulation, or stakeholder expectations regarding responsible sourcing practices, such as heightened reporting
and other obligations with regard to environmental impacts, the risk of forced labor, or supplier conduct that does not meet such
standards, which can result in supply chain disruptions, the loss of a supplier, and the government seizure of goods, as well as cause
our compliance costs to increase or result in publicity that negatively affects our reputation.
These and other supply chain issues can increase our costs, disrupt or reduce our production, delay our product shipments, prevent us 
from meeting customer demand, and damage our customer relationships. They may keep us from successfully implementing our 
business strategy and can materially harm our business, competitive position, results of operation, and financial condition. From time to 
time, our customers experience disruptions or shortages in their own supply chains that constrain their demand for our products. During 
2022, macroeconomic and geopolitical conditions, as well as outbreaks of COVID-19 in certain regions of the world, caused supply chain 
disruptions and delays in obtaining tools and other components, while in 2021, the semiconductor industry experienced widespread 
shortages of substrates and other components and available foundry manufacturing capacity. These shortages have previously limited our 
ability to supply customer demand in certain of our businesses, such as for our FPGA products, and have adversely affected customer 
demand for our products, including in our CCG and DCAI businesses, as some customers have been unable to procure sufficient 
quantities of third-party components used together with our products to produce finished systems. It is difficult to predict the future impact 
of these shortages when they occur.
To obtain future supply of certain materials and components, particularly substrates, and third-party foundry manufacturing capacity, we 
have entered into arrangements with some of our suppliers that involve long-term purchase commitments and/or large prepayments. 
These arrangements may not be adequate to meet our requirements, or our suppliers may fail to deliver committed volumes on time or at 
all, or their financial condition may deteriorate. If future customer demand over the horizon of such arrangements falls below our 
expectations, we could have excess or obsolete inventory, unneeded capacity, and increased costs, and our prepayments may not be 
fully utilized, and in some cases may not be fully recoverable. 
We utilize third-party foundries and component suppliers to manufacture or supply certain components and products for areas such as 
networking, communications, graphics, programmable semiconductor solutions, and memory. As part of our IDM 2.0 strategy, we expect 
to increase our use of third-party foundries for manufacturing, which will include modular tiles manufactured on advanced foundry process 
technologies for use in our core computing offerings. Delays in the development of foundries’ future manufacturing processes could delay 
the introduction of products or components we design for such processes, and insufficient foundry capacity could prevent us from meeting 
customer demand. We typically have less control over delivery schedules, design and manufacturing co-optimization, manufacturing 
yields, quality, product quantities, and costs for components and products that are manufactured by third parties. 
Where possible, we seek to have several sources of supply. However, for certain components, services, materials, and equipment, we 
rely on a single or a limited number of suppliers, or upon suppliers in a single location. For example, ASML is currently the sole supplier of 
EUV photolithography tools that we will be deploying in our Intel 4 and other future manufacturing process nodes. These tools are highly 
complex to develop and produce, and increasingly costly, and from time to time there are increases in lead times or delays in their 
development and availability, which could delay the development or ramp of our future process nodes. As a further example, a limited 
number of third-party foundries offer leading-edge manufacturing processes, and these providers are geographically concentrated in Asia. 
Supplier consolidation or business failures can also reduce the pool of qualified suppliers. Sole- or limited-source suppliers can impact the 
nature, quality, availability, and pricing of the products and services available to us and intensify the other risks described in this risk factor.
Our disaggregated design strategy introduces additional production risks. Our disaggregated design strategy poses increased logistical 
risks and challenges, particularly where we decide to manufacture different product components on different process technologies, 
including third-party foundries' process technologies. To combine components in a single package, they need to be manufactured on a 
timely basis and in sufficient quantities, while the manufacturing processes we utilize may have differing yields, throughput times, and 
capacity constraints. We may be required to safely store some components pending the manufacture of others. Delays or quality issues 
with one component could limit our ability to manufacture the entire completed product. In addition, the packaging technologies used to 
combine these components can increase our costs and may introduce additional complexity and quality issues. To the extent we are 
unable to manage these risks, our ability to timely supply competitive products can be harmed and our costs could increase.
We are subject to the risks of product defects, errata, or other product issues. From time to time, we identify product defects, errata 
(deviations from published specifications), and other product issues, which can result from problems in our product design or our 
manufacturing and assembly and test processes. Components and products we purchase or license from third-party suppliers, or gain 
through acquisitions, can also contain defects. Product issues also sometimes result from the interaction between our products and third-
party products and software. We face risks if products that we design, manufacture, or sell, or that include our technology, cause personal 
injury or property damage, even where the cause is unrelated to product defects or errata. These risks may increase as our products are 
introduced into new devices, market segments, technologies, or applications, including transportation, autonomous driving, healthcare, 
communications, financial services, and other industrial, critical infrastructure, and consumer uses. 
Costs from defects, errata, or other product issues could include:
▪
writing off some or all of the value of inventory;
▪
recalling products that have been shipped;
▪
providing product replacements or modifications;
▪
providing consideration to customers, including reimbursement for certain costs they incur;
▪
defending against litigation and/or paying resulting damages; and

57


▪
paying fines imposed by regulatory agencies.
These costs could be large and may increase expenses and lower gross margin, and/or result in delay or loss of revenue. Mitigation 
techniques designed to address product issues, including software and firmware updates, are not always available on a timely basis—or 
at all—and do not always operate as intended or effectively resolve such issues for all applications. We and third parties, such as 
hardware and software vendors, make prioritization decisions about which product issues to address, which can delay, limit, or prevent 
development or deployment of a mitigation and harm our reputation and result in costs. Product defects, errata, or other product issues 
and/or mitigation techniques can result in product failures, adverse performance and power effects, reboots, system instability or 
unavailability, loss of functionality, data loss or corruption, unpredictable system behavior, decisions by customers and end users to limit or 
change the applications in which they use our products or product features, and other issues. Product issues can damage our reputation, 
negatively affect product demand, delay product releases or deployment, result in legal liability, or make our products less competitive, 
which could harm our business and financial results. Subsequent events or new information can develop that changes our assessment of 
the impact of a product issue. In addition, our liability insurance coverage has certain exclusions or may not adequately cover liabilities 
incurred. Our insurance providers may be unable or unwilling to pay a claim, and losses not covered by insurance could be large, which 
could harm our financial condition.
We face risks related to security vulnerabilities in our products. We or third parties regularly identify security vulnerabilities with respect to 
our processors and other products, as well as the operating systems and workloads that run on them and the components that interact 
with them. Components and IP we purchase or license from third parties for use in our products, as well as industry-standard 
specifications we implement in our products, are also regularly subject to security vulnerabilities. Our processors and other products are 
being used in application areas that create new or increased cybersecurity and privacy risks, including applications that gather and 
process large amounts of data, such as the cloud or Internet of Things, and critical infrastructure and automotive applications. The 
security vulnerabilities identified in our processors include a category known as side-channel vulnerabilities, such as the variants referred 
to as "Spectre" and "Meltdown." Additional categories and variants have been identified and are expected to continue to be identified. 
Publicity about these and other security vulnerabilities has resulted in, and is expected to continue to result in, increased attempts by third 
parties to identify additional vulnerabilities. Security and manageability features in our products cannot make our products absolutely 
secure, and these features themselves are subject to vulnerabilities and attempts by third parties to identify additional vulnerabilities. 
Vulnerabilities are not always mitigated before they become known. We, our customers, and the users of our products do not always 
promptly learn of or have the ability to fully assess the magnitude or effects of a vulnerability, including the extent, if any, to which a 
vulnerability has been exploited. Subsequent events or new information can develop that changes our assessment of the impact of a 
security vulnerability, including additional information learned as we develop and deploy mitigations or updates, become aware of 
additional variants, evaluate the competitiveness of existing and new products, and address future warranty or other claims or customer 
satisfaction considerations, as well as developments in the course of any litigation or regulatory inquiries or actions over these matters.
Mitigation techniques designed to address security vulnerabilities, including software and firmware updates or other preventative 
measures, are not always available on a timely basis—or at all—and at times do not operate as intended or effectively resolve 
vulnerabilities for all applications. In addition, we are often required to rely on third parties, including hardware, software, and services 
vendors, as well as our customers and end users, to develop and/or deploy mitigation techniques, and the availability, effectiveness, and 
performance impact of mitigation techniques can depend solely or in part on the actions of these third parties in determining whether, 
when, and how to develop and deploy mitigations. Export restrictions may impede our ability to provide updates or patches to customers 
in certain geographies or that appear on sanctions lists, potentially leaving systems unpatched and open to exploitation. Further, sanctions 
lists may include third parties with whom we need to interact for coordinated vulnerability disclosure, which may impair our ability to 
receive information about vulnerabilities and to deliver mitigations for them. We and such third parties make prioritization decisions about 
which vulnerabilities to address, which can delay, limit, or prevent development or deployment of a mitigation and harm our reputation. 
Security vulnerabilities and/or mitigation techniques can result in adverse performance or power effects, reboots, system instability or 
unavailability, loss of functionality, data loss or corruption, unpredictable system behavior, decisions by customers and end users to limit or 
change the applications in which they use our products or product features, and/or the misappropriation of data by third parties.
Security vulnerabilities and any limitations or adverse effects of mitigation techniques can adversely affect our results of operations, 
financial condition, customer relationships, prospects, and reputation in a number of ways, any of which may be material. For example, 
whether or not vulnerabilities involve attempted or successful exploits, they may result in our incurring significant costs related to 
developing and deploying updates and mitigations, writing down inventory value, defending against product claims and litigation, 
responding to regulatory inquiries or actions, paying damages, addressing customer satisfaction considerations, providing product 
replacements or modifications, or taking other remedial steps with respect to third parties. Adverse publicity about security vulnerabilities 
or mitigations could damage our reputation with customers or users and reduce demand for our products and services. These effects may 
be greater to the extent that competing products are not susceptible to the same vulnerabilities or if vulnerabilities can be more effectively 
mitigated in competing products. Moreover, third parties can release information regarding potential vulnerabilities of our products before 
mitigations are available, which, in turn, could lead to attempted or successful exploits, adversely affect our ability to introduce mitigations, 
or otherwise harm our business and reputation.

We are subject to risks associated with environmental, health, and safety and product regulations. The design, manufacturing, assembly 
and test of our products require the use and purchase of materials and chemicals that are subject to a broad array of environmental, 
health, and safety laws and regulations. Our operations and those of our suppliers are further governed by regulations prohibiting the use 
of forced labor (e.g., mining conflict minerals), and restrictions on other materials, as well as laws or regulations governing the operation of 
our facilities, sale and distribution of our products, and use of our real property. The scope and interpretation of such laws and regulations, 
including the materials they govern, are complex and continue to evolve. The procedures and processes in place under our compliance 
program may become onerous or increasingly expensive to maintain and cannot guarantee compliance by employees or third parties to 
whom such laws apply. The amendment or expansion of these laws or regulations, as well as our failure or inability to comply with them 
(including as a result of acquired entities) can result in regulatory penalties, fines, and legal liabilities; increased costs; additional 
remediation obligations; suspension of production; alteration, suspension, or termination of our manufacturing and assembly and test 
processes, including due to an inability to find, afford, or attain adequate substitute materials, equipment, or processes; damage to our 
reputation; and restrictions on our operations or sales. In addition, the failure or inability to comply by our suppliers of these materials can 
require us to suspend or alter our production processes and sources, and result in increased risks and costs.
The failure or inability by us or our customers and suppliers to manage the use, transportation, emissions, discharge, storage, recycling, 
or disposal of hazardous materials can lead to increased costs or future liabilities. Environmental regulations, such as air quality and 
wastewater requirements, may impede our ability to expand or modify our manufacturing capability in the future. Environmental laws and 
regulations sometimes require us to acquire additional pollution abatement or remediation equipment, modify product designs, cease the 
use of a particular material or process, remove or remediate hazardous substances, or incur other expenses or liabilities. Regulations in 
response to climate change could result in increased manufacturing costs associated with air pollution requirements. For example, 
semiconductor manufacturing uses perfluorocarbons, which have historically made up a large portion of our direct greenhouse gas 
emissions. New or increased regulations limiting the use of such compounds, or other greenhouse gas emissions, could require us to 
install additional abatement equipment, purchase carbon offsets, and/or alter, where feasible, our production processes and sources. In 
addition, new or increased climate change regulation could increase our energy costs, for example as a result of carbon pricing impacts 
on electrical utilities. As we expand our manufacturing capacity as part of our IDM 2.0 strategy, the impacts of future regulation could be 
magnified. Many new materials that we are evaluating for use in our operations are subject to regulation under environmental laws and 
regulations. These restrictions could harm our business and results of operations by increasing our expenses or requiring us to alter 
manufacturing and assembly and test processes.
We have established and report on our initiatives, aspirations, and goals related to corporate responsibility matters, which exposes us to 
numerous risks. A wide range of stakeholders, including governments, customers, employees, and investors, are increasingly focused on 
and developing expectations regarding corporate responsibility matters such as sustainability, human capital management, data privacy 
and cyber security, and human rights. This attention has resulted in a variety of required and voluntary reporting regimes that are not 
harmonized and continue to change. For example, governments around the world have enacted or are contemplating legislation and 
regulation that may impact how we conduct and/or report on our business by requiring the disclosure and tracking of certain greenhouse 
emissions and other climate and biodiversity information, and/or cyber security or human capital matters related to our business. Third-
party groups and non-profit organizations, among others, have also established standards for rating, or frameworks for reporting, on 
corporate responsibility initiatives. In response to the evolving stakeholder expectations and new or proposed standards, customers and 
investors have formalized and expanded their own corporate responsibility goals and expectations that may influence how they assess, 
invest in, or utilize other businesses. If we fail to set or achieve corporate responsibility initiatives that meet our stakeholders' expectations, 
that could negatively impact us. Our corporate responsibility initiatives, including our 2030 RISE strategy and related goals, could also 
expose us to heightened scrutiny and numerous financial, legal, reputational, operational, compliance and other risks, including lost 
customer opportunities, that could negatively impact us. 
Our achievement of initiatives, aspirations, and goals related to corporate responsibility matters, including those related to sustainability, is 
not guaranteed and is subject to numerous conditions, risks, and expectations; standards, processes, and methodologies that are early in 
their advancement and continue to evolve; and science for which development is ongoing. Our RISE strategy and related goals, and 
expectations about costs to achieve those goals, are based on current iterations of varied process and reporting frameworks, as well as 
management's current expectations regarding the availability, efficiency, development, and cost of particular technologies, consumer 
trends, and other assumptions, and changes in those items could negatively impact our ability to achieve those goals, or the cost of 
achieving them. From time to time, we may change, expand, or reduce the standards to which we report or goals that we seek to meet. 
Our failure or inability to achieve such goals—or the perception by stakeholders of such failure or inability—may negatively affect our 
reputation or results of operations. Even if achieved, these matters may not result in some or all of the benefits anticipated at the time they 
were established.
The COVID-19 pandemic could materially adversely affect our financial condition and results of 
operations. 
The COVID-19 pandemic has previously adversely affected significant portions of our business and could have a material adverse effect 
on our financial condition and results of operations. Authorities in jurisdictions where we operate, or in which our suppliers, customers, or 
others operate, have imposed, and businesses and individuals have implemented, varied measures to try to manage or contain the virus 
or treat its impact, such as travel bans and restrictions, quarantines, shelter-in-place/stay-at-home and social distancing orders, 
shutdowns, and vaccine requirements. These measures have impacted and may further impact our workforce and operations, the 
operations and demands of our customers, and those of our respective suppliers and partners. We have experienced, and could in the 
future experience, reduced workforce availability at some of our sites, construction delays, and reduced capacity at some of our suppliers. 
We have significant manufacturing operations in the US, Ireland, Israel, China, Malaysia, and Vietnam, and some of these countries

continue to take measures in response to the pandemic. Restrictions on our manufacturing or support operations or workforce, similar 
limitations for our suppliers, and transportation restrictions or disruptions can limit our ability to meet customer demand and could have a 
material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations. Our customers have experienced, and may in the future 
experience, disruptions in their operations and supply chains, which can result in delayed, reduced, or cancelled orders, or collection 
risks, and which may adversely affect our results of operations. 
The pandemic has caused us to modify our business practices, including with respect to flexible work and social distancing measures. 
These and other measures introduce additional operational risks, including cybersecurity risks, and have affected the way we conduct our 
product development, validation, and qualification; customer support; and other activities, which could have a material adverse effect on 
our operations. The pandemic has also previously resulted in substantial economic uncertainty and volatility and disrupted historical 
patterns related to demand for our products and services that may impact our ability to accurately predict future demand, trends, or other 
matters that may impact our financial performance. The degree to which COVID-19 impacts our results will depend on future 
developments, and there is no certainty that measures we have taken or will take will be sufficient to mitigate the risks posed by the virus. 
Additional impacts and risks may arise that we or our customers, suppliers, and other partners are not aware of or able to respond to 
effectively, and which may adversely affect us. The impact of COVID-19 can also exacerbate other risks discussed in these risk factors 
and throughout this report.
We operate globally and are subject to significant risks in many jurisdictions.
Global or regional conditions can harm our financial results. We have manufacturing, assembly and test, R&D, sales, and other operations 
in many countries, and some of our business activities are concentrated in one or more geographic areas. Moreover, sales outside the US 
accounted for 74% of our revenue for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2022, with revenue from billings to China contributing 27% of 
our total revenue. As a result, our operations and our financial results, including our ability to execute our business strategy, manufacture, 
assemble and test, design, develop, or sell products, and the demand for our products, are at times adversely affected by a number of 
global and regional factors outside of our control.
Adverse changes in global or regional economic conditions periodically occur, including recession or slowing growth; changes or 
uncertainty in fiscal, monetary, or trade policy; higher interest rates; tighter credit; inflation; lower capital expenditures by businesses, 
including on IT infrastructure; increases in unemployment; and lower consumer confidence and spending. Adverse changes in economic 
conditions can significantly harm demand for our products and make it more challenging to forecast our operating results and make 
business decisions, including regarding prioritization of investments in our business. An economic downturn or increased uncertainty may 
also lead to increased credit and collectability risks, higher borrowing costs or reduced availability of capital and credit markets, reduced 
liquidity, adverse impacts on our suppliers, failures of counterparties including financial institutions and insurers, asset impairments, and 
declines in the value of our financial instruments. 
We can be adversely affected by other global and regional factors that periodically occur, including:
▪
geopolitical and security issues, such as armed conflict and civil or military unrest, political instability, human rights concerns, and
terrorist activity, including, for example, geopolitical tensions and conflict affecting Israel, where our Mobileye business headquarters
and certain of our fabrication facilities are located;
▪
natural disasters, public health issues (including pandemics), and other catastrophic events;
▪
inefficient infrastructure and other disruptions, such as supply chain interruptions, materials shortages or delays, and large-scale
outages or unreliable provision of services from utilities, transportation, data hosting, or telecommunications providers;
▪
formal or informal imposition of new or revised export, import, or doing-business regulations, including trade sanctions, tariffs, and
changes in the ability to obtain export licenses, which could be changed without notice;
▪
government restrictions on, or nationalization of, our operations in any country, or restrictions on our ability to repatriate earnings from
or distribute compensation or other funds in a particular country;
▪
adverse changes relating to government grants, tax credits, or other government incentives, including more favorable incentives
provided to competitors;
▪
differing employment practices and labor issues, including restricted access to talent;
▪
ineffective legal protection of our IP rights in certain countries;
▪
local business and cultural factors that differ from our current standards and practices;
▪
continuing uncertainty regarding social, political, immigration, and tax and trade policies in the US and abroad; and
▪
fluctuations in the market values of our domestic and international investments, and in the capital and credit markets, which can be
negatively affected by liquidity, credit deterioration or losses, interest rate changes, financial results, political risk, sovereign risk, or
other factors.
For example, in 2022, in response to Russia’s war with Ukraine, numerous countries and organizations have imposed financial and other 
sanctions and export controls against Russia and Belarus, while businesses, including Intel, have limited or suspended Russian 
operations. Russia has likewise imposed currency restrictions and regulations and may further take retaliatory trade or other actions, 
including the nationalization of foreign businesses. These and other actions have exposed the company to the risks described herein and 
to additional uncertainty and risks regarding increases to supply, commodity, and other costs, damage to our reputation, and cyberattacks; 
and may increase the likelihood, or amplify the impacts, of other risks, including those highlighted in these risk factors and throughout this 
report.

We are also subject to risks related to the cessation of US dollar LIBOR. Certain of our derivatives and floating-rate investments reference 
US dollar LIBOR, and a portion of our indebtedness bears interest at variable interest rates, primarily based on US dollar LIBOR. No new 
US dollar LIBOR-based activity can be conducted after 2021, and US dollar LIBOR will be unavailable for use in our existing contracts 
and financial instruments beyond June 30, 2023. While reasonable alternatives to LIBOR have been introduced into markets, our 
transition from LIBOR to alternative reference rates could result in an increase in our interest expense and/or a reduction in our interest 
income.
We are subject to risks related to trade policies and regulations. Trade policies and disputes at times result in increased tariffs, trade 
barriers, and other protectionist measures, which can increase our manufacturing costs, make our products less competitive, reduce 
demand for our products, limit our ability to sell to certain customers, limit our ability to procure components or raw materials, or impede or 
slow the movement of our goods across borders. Increasing protectionism and economic nationalism may lead to further changes in trade 
policies and regulations, domestic sourcing initiatives, or other formal and informal measures that could make it more difficult to sell our 
products in, or restrict our access to, some markets. 
In particular, trade tensions between the US and China have led to increased tariffs and trade restrictions, including tariffs applicable to 
some of our products, and have affected customer ordering patterns. The US has imposed restrictions on the export of US-regulated 
products and technology to certain Chinese technology companies, including certain of our customers. These restrictions have reduced 
our sales and continuing or future restrictions could adversely affect our financial performance, result in reputational harm to us, or lead 
such companies to develop or adopt technologies that compete with our products. It is difficult to predict what further trade-related actions 
governments may take, which may include trade restrictions and additional or increased tariffs and export controls imposed on short 
notice, and we may be unable to quickly and effectively react to or mitigate such actions. 
Trade disputes and protectionist measures, or continued uncertainty about such matters, could result in declining consumer confidence 
and slowing economic growth or recession, and could cause our customers to reduce, cancel, or alter the timing of their purchases with 
us. Sustained geopolitical tensions could lead to long-term changes in global trade and technology supply chains, and decoupling of 
global trade networks, which could have a material adverse effect on our business and growth prospects.
Laws and regulations can have a negative impact on our business. We are subject to laws and regulations worldwide that differ among 
jurisdictions, affecting our operations in areas including, but not limited to: IP ownership and infringement; tax; import and export 
requirements; anti-corruption; foreign exchange controls and cash repatriation restrictions; data privacy and localization requirements; 
competition; advertising; employment and labor; product regulations; environment, health, and safety requirements; and consumer laws. 
Compliance with such requirements can be onerous and expensive and may otherwise impact our business operations negatively. For 
example, unfavorable developments with evolving laws and regulations worldwide related to 5G or autonomous driving technology and 
MaaS may limit global adoption, impede our strategy, or negatively impact our long-term expectations for our investments in these areas. 
Expanding privacy legislation and compliance costs of privacy-related and data-protection measures could adversely affect our customers 
and their products and services, particularly in cloud, Internet of Things, and AI applications, which could in turn reduce demand for our 
products used for those workloads.
Our policies, controls, and procedures designed to help provide for compliance with applicable laws cannot provide assurance that our 
employees, contractors, suppliers, or agents will not violate such laws or our policies. Violations of these laws and regulations can result 
in fines; criminal sanctions against us, our officers, or our employees; prohibitions on the conduct of our business; and damage to our 
reputation. The technology industry is subject to intense media, political, and regulatory scrutiny, which can increase our exposure to 
government investigations, legal actions, and penalties.
We are affected by fluctuations in currency exchange rates. We are exposed to adverse as well as beneficial movements in currency 
exchange rates. Although most of our sales occur in US dollars, expenses may be paid in local currencies. An increase in the value of the 
dollar can increase the real cost to our customers of our products in those markets outside the US where we sell in dollars, and a 
weakened dollar can increase the cost of expenses such as payroll, utilities, tax, and marketing expenses, as well as overseas capital 
expenditures. We also conduct certain investing and financing activities in local currencies. Our hedging programs may not be effective to 
offset any, or more than a portion, of the adverse impact of currency exchange rate movements; therefore, changes in exchange rates can 
harm our results of operations and financial condition. 
Changes in our effective tax rate may impact our net income. A number of factors can impact our effective tax rate, which could reduce or 
increase our net income, including: 
•
changes in the volume and mix of profits earned and location of assets across jurisdictions with varying tax rates;
•
the resolution of issues arising from tax audits, including payment of interest and penalties;
•
changes in the valuation of our deferred tax assets and liabilities, and in deferred tax valuation allowances;
•
adjustments to income taxes upon finalization of tax returns;
•
increases in expenses not deductible for tax purposes, including impairments of goodwill;
•
changes in available tax credits;
•
changes in our ability to secure new, or renew existing, tax holidays and incentives;
•
changes in US federal, state, or foreign tax laws or their interpretation, including changes in the US to the taxation of manufacturing
enterprises and of non-US income and expenses, and changes resulting from the adoption by countries of the Organization for
Economic Co-operation and Development recommendations or other legislative actions;

▪
changes in accounting standards; and
▪
our decision to repatriate non-US earnings for which we have not previously provided for local country withholding taxes incurred
upon repatriation.
Catastrophic events can have a material adverse effect on our operations and financial results. Our operations and business, and those of 
our customers and suppliers, can be disrupted by natural disasters; industrial accidents; public health issues; cybersecurity incidents; 
interruptions of service from utilities, transportation, telecommunications, or IT systems providers; manufacturing equipment failures; or 
other catastrophic events. For example, we have at times experienced disruptions in our manufacturing processes as a result of power 
outages, improperly functioning equipment, and disruptions in supply of raw materials or components, including due to cybersecurity 
incidents affecting our suppliers. Our headquarters and many of our operations and facilities are in locations that are prone to earthquakes 
and other natural disasters. Global climate change can result in certain natural disasters occurring more frequently or with greater 
intensity, such as drought, wildfires, storms, sea-level rise, and flooding, and could disrupt the availability of water necessary for the 
operation of our fabrication facilities, including our facilities located in water-sensitive regions such as Arizona and Israel. In addition, to 
the extent we are unable to successfully manage and conserve water resources, our reputation could be harmed. In recent years, the 
west coast of the US has experienced significant wildfires, including in Oregon, where we have major manufacturing facilities, and in 
California, where we are headquartered. The long-term effects of climate change on the global economy and the technology industry in 
particular are unclear but could be severe. 
Catastrophic events could make it difficult or impossible to manufacture or deliver products to our customers, receive production materials 
from our suppliers, or perform critical functions, which could adversely affect our revenue and require significant recovery time and 
expenditures to resume operations. While we maintain business recovery plans, some of our systems are not fully redundant and we 
cannot be sure that our plans will fully protect us from such disruptions. Furthermore, even if our operations are unaffected or recover 
quickly, if our customers or suppliers cannot timely resume their own operations due to a catastrophic event, we may experience reduced 
or cancelled orders or disruptions to our supply chain that may adversely affect our results of operations.
We maintain a program of insurance coverage for a variety of property, casualty, and other risks. The types and amounts of insurance we 
obtain vary depending on availability, cost, and decisions with respect to risk retention. Some of our policies have large deductibles and 
broad exclusions. In addition, one or more of our insurance providers may be unable or unwilling to pay a claim. Losses not covered by 
insurance may be large, which could harm our results of operations and financial condition.
Damage to our reputation can damage our business. Our reputation is a critical factor in our relationships with customers, employees, 
governments, suppliers, and other stakeholders. Our failure to address, or the appearance of our failure to address, issues that give rise 
to reputational risk, including those described throughout these risk factors, could significantly harm our reputation and our brands. Our 
reputation can be impacted by catastrophic events; incidents involving unethical behavior or misconduct; product quality, security, or 
safety issues; allegations of legal noncompliance; internal control failures; corporate responsibility and governance issues; data breaches; 
workplace safety incidents; environmental incidents; our response to climate change, including our greenhouse gas emission levels; the 
use of our products for illegal or objectionable applications, including AI and machine learning applications that present ethical, regulatory, 
or other issues; marketing practices; media statements; the conduct of our suppliers or representatives; and other issues, incidents, or 
statements that, whether actual or perceived, result in adverse publicity. To the extent we fail to respond quickly and effectively to address 
corporate crises, the ensuing negative public reaction could significantly harm our reputation and our brands and could lead to increases 
in litigation claims and asserted damages or subject us to regulatory actions or restrictions. 
Damage to our reputation could reduce demand for our products and adversely affect our business and operating environment. It could 
reduce investor confidence in us, adversely affecting our stock price. It may also limit our ability to be seen as an employer of choice when 
competing for highly skilled employees. Moreover, repairing our reputation and brands may be difficult, time-consuming, and expensive.
We are subject to cybersecurity and privacy risks.
We face risks related to cybersecurity threats and incidents. We regularly face attempts by others to gain unauthorized access through the 
Internet, or to introduce malicious software, to our IT systems. Individuals or organizations, including malicious hackers, state-sponsored 
organizations, insider threats including employees and third-party service providers, or intruders into our physical facilities, at times 
attempt to gain unauthorized access and/or corrupt the processes used to design and manufacture our hardware products and our 
associated software and services. Due to the widespread use of our products, we are a frequent target of computer hackers and 
organizations that intend to sabotage, compromise, take control of, or otherwise corrupt our manufacturing or other processes, products, 
and services. We are also a target of malicious attackers who attempt to gain access to our network or data centers or those of our 
suppliers, customers, partners, or end users; steal proprietary information related to our business, products, employees, suppliers, and 
customers; interrupt our systems and services or those of our suppliers, customers, or others; or demand ransom to return control of such 
systems and services. Such attempts are increasing in number and in technical sophistication, and if successful, expose us and the 
affected parties to risk of loss or misuse of proprietary or confidential information or disruptions of our business operations, including our 
manufacturing operations. Our IT infrastructure also includes products and services provided by third parties, and these providers can 
experience breaches of their systems and products, or provide inadequate updates or support, which can impact the security of our 
systems and our proprietary or confidential information. In addition, we are a global company with operations and employees around the 
world. We face risks related to the use or misuse, inadvertent or otherwise, of our IT systems by employees, vendors, and other 
individuals with access to our systems.

From time to time, we encounter intrusions or unauthorized access to our network, products, services, or infrastructure, as well as those 
of third parties who provide products and services to us. For example, in the fourth quarter of 2020, our Habana Labs subsidiary’s network 
was breached, resulting in unauthorized third-party access of certain confidential information, in connection with a suspected unsuccessful 
ransomware attack. The breach was confined to our subsidiary's network and has not had a material impact on Habana Labs’ business. 
We are also subject to risks associated with attacks involving our supply chain, such as the compromise of IT infrastructure management 
software provided by SolarWinds Corporation, reported in the fourth quarter of 2020. During 2021, we have observed an increase in 
ransomware attacks in our supply chain. In December 2021, a vulnerability named “Log4Shell” was reported for the widely used Java 
logging library, Apache Log4j 2. We reviewed the use of this library within our software product portfolio and in our IT environment, but the 
steps we have taken to mitigate the vulnerability may not be sufficient to mitigate all related risks. To date, cybersecurity incidents have 
not resulted in a material adverse impact to our business or operations, but there can be no guarantee we will not experience such an 
impact. Such incidents, whether or not successful, could result in our incurring significant costs related to, for example, rebuilding internal 
systems, writing down inventory value, implementing additional threat protection measures, providing modifications to our products and 
services, defending against litigation, responding to regulatory inquiries or actions, paying damages, providing customers with incentives 
to maintain the business relationship, or taking other remedial steps with respect to third parties, as well as reputational harm. In addition, 
these threats are constantly evolving, thereby increasing the difficulty of successfully defending against them or implementing adequate 
preventative measures. As a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, remote work and remote access to our systems has increased 
significantly, which also increases our cybersecurity attack surface. We have also seen an increase in cyberattack volume, frequency, and 
sophistication driven by the global enablement of remote workforces. We seek to detect and investigate unauthorized attempts and 
attacks against our network, products, and services, and to prevent their recurrence where practicable through changes or updates to our 
internal processes and tools and changes or updates to our products and services; however, we remain potentially vulnerable to 
additional known or unknown threats. In some instances, we, our suppliers, our customers, and the users of our products and services 
can be unaware of an incident or its magnitude and effects. There is increasing regulation regarding responses to cybersecurity incidents, 
including reporting to regulators, which could subject us to additional liability and reputational harm.
Theft, loss, or misuse of personal data about our employees, customers, or other third parties could increase our expenses, damage our 
reputation, or result in legal or regulatory proceedings. The theft, loss, or misuse of personal data collected, used, stored, or transferred by 
us to run our business, including data stored with vendors or other third parties, could result in significantly increased business and 
security costs or costs related to defending legal claims. We anticipate that our collection of such personal data will increase as we enter 
into the MaaS market in our Mobileye business, and it may increase as we enter into other new or adjacent businesses. Global privacy 
legislation, enforcement, and policy activity in this area are rapidly expanding and creating a complex regulatory compliance environment. 
Costs to comply with and implement these privacy-related and data-protection measures could be significant, and noncompliance could 
expose us to significant monetary penalties, damage to our reputation, suspension of online services or sites in certain countries, and 
even criminal sanctions. Even our inadvertent failure to comply with federal, state, or international privacy-related or data-protection laws 
and regulations could result in audits, regulatory inquiries, or proceedings against us by governmental entities or other third parties.
We are subject to IP risks and risks associated with litigation and regulatory proceedings. 
We cannot always protect our IP or enforce our IP rights. We regard our patents, copyrights, trade secrets, and other IP rights as 
important to the success of our business. We rely on IP law—as well as confidentiality and licensing agreements with our customers, 
employees, technology development partners, and others—to protect our IP and IP rights. Our ability to enforce these rights is subject to 
general litigation risks, as well as uncertainty as to the enforceability of our IP rights in various countries. We are not always able to obtain 
protection for our IP or enforce or protect our IP rights. Enforcement is costly and time-consuming and can divert management attention. 
When we seek to enforce our rights, we may be subject to claims that our IP rights are invalid, not enforceable, or licensed to an opposing 
party. Our assertion of IP rights may result in another party seeking to assert claims against us, which could harm our business. From time 
to time, governments adopt regulations—and governments or courts render decisions—requiring compulsory licensing of IP rights, or 
governments require products to meet standards that favor local companies. Our inability to enforce our IP rights under any of these 
circumstances can harm our competitive position and business. In some cases, our IP rights can offer inadequate protection for our 
innovations. In addition, the theft or unauthorized use or publication of our trade secrets and other confidential business information could 
harm our competitive position and reduce acceptance of our products; as a result, the value of our investment in R&D, product 
development, and marketing could be reduced. This risk is heightened as competitors for technical talent increasingly seek to hire our 
employees.
Our licenses with other companies and participation in industry initiatives at times allow competitors to use some of our patent rights. 
Technology companies often bilaterally license patents between each other to settle disputes or as part of business agreements. Some of 
our competitors have in the past had, and may in the future have, licenses to some of our patents, and under current case law, some of 
the licenses can exhaust our patent rights as to licensed product sales under some circumstances. Our participation in industry standards 
organizations or with other industry initiatives at times requires us to offer to license our patents to companies that adopt industry-standard 
specifications. Depending on the rules of the organization, government regulations, or court decisions, we sometimes have to grant 
licenses to some of our patents for little or no cost, and as a result, we may be unable to enforce certain patents against others, and the 
value of our IP rights may be impaired.

Third parties assert claims based on IP rights against us and our products, which could harm our business. We face claims based on IP 
rights from individuals, companies, non-practicing entities, academic and research institutions, and other parties, including claims from 
those who have aggregated patents acquired from multiple sources to form a new, larger portfolio to assert claims against us and other 
companies. Additionally, large patent portfolio owners sometimes divest portions of their portfolios to more than one individual or company, 
increasing the number of parties who own IP rights that were previously all held by a single party. We have seen an increase in patent 
assertions and lawsuits initiated by well-funded non-practicing entities, including entities funded by investment firms and other third 
parties. In some instances, these entities have filed multi-jurisdiction litigation seeking large monetary damages and/or injunctions against 
us. These lawsuits can increase our cost of doing business, impact our reputation or relationship with customers, and could disrupt our 
operations if they succeed in blocking the trade of our products. For example, in the multi-jurisdiction litigation brought against us by VLSI, 
juries in certain of the US federal court cases returned unfavorable verdicts against us of $945 million in damages in November 2022 and 
approximately $2.2 billion in damages in February 2021, both of which we expect to appeal or have appealed as discussed in "Note 19: 
Commitments and Contingencies" within the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. The patent litigation environment has also 
become more challenging due to the emergence of venues adopting procedural and substantive rules that make them more favorable for 
patent asserters, including the availability of injunctive relief for non-practicing entities, and the US Patent and Trademark Office’s 
reduction of inter partes patent review under the America Invents Act. As a result, we believe we are facing a more hostile IP litigation 
environment.
We are typically engaged in a number of disputes involving IP rights. Claims that our products, technologies, or processes infringe the IP 
rights of others, regardless of their merits, cause us to incur large costs to respond to, defend, and resolve the claims, and they divert the 
efforts and attention of our management and technical personnel from our business and operations. In addition, we may face claims 
based on the alleged theft or unauthorized use or disclosure of third-party trade secrets, confidential information, or end-user data that we 
obtain in conducting our business. Any such incidents and claims could severely disrupt our business, and we could suffer losses, 
including the cost of product recalls and returns, and reputational harm. Furthermore, we have agreed to indemnify customers for certain 
IP rights claims against them. IP rights claims against our customers could also limit demand for our products or disrupt our customers' 
businesses, which could in turn adversely affect our results of operations.
As a result of IP rights claims, we could:
▪
pay monetary damages, payments to satisfy indemnification obligations, royalties, fines, or penalties;
▪
stop manufacturing, using, selling, offering to sell, or importing products or technology subject to claims;
▪
need to develop other products or technology not subject to claims, which could be time-consuming or costly; and/or
▪
enter into settlement or license agreements, which may not be available on commercially reasonable terms and may be costly.
These IP rights claims could harm our competitive position, result in expenses, or require us to impair our assets. If we alter or stop 
production of affected items, our revenue could be harmed.
We rely on access to third-party IP, which may not be available to us on commercially reasonable terms or at all. Many of our products are 
designed to include third-party technology or implement industry standards, which may require licenses from third parties. In addition, 
from time to time, third parties notify us that they believe we are using their IP. There is no assurance that necessary licenses to such 
third-party IP can be obtained on commercially reasonable terms or at all, or that our existing licenses to third-party IP will continue to be 
available on commercially reasonable terms or at all. Failure to obtain the right to use third-party technology, or to license IP on 
commercially reasonable terms, could preclude us from selling certain products or otherwise have a material adverse impact on our 
financial condition and operating results. To the extent our products include software that contains or is derived from open-source 
software, we may be required to make the software's source code publicly available and/or license the software under open-source 
licensing terms.
We are subject to risks associated with litigation and regulatory matters. From time to time, we face legal claims or regulatory matters 
involving stockholder, consumer, competition, commercial, IP, labor and employment, compliance, and other issues on a global basis. As 
described in "Note 19: Commitments and Contingencies" within the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, we are engaged in a 
number of litigation and regulatory matters. Litigation and regulatory proceedings are inherently uncertain, and adverse rulings, excessive 
verdicts, or other events could occur, including monetary damages, fines, penalties, or injunctions stopping us from manufacturing or 
selling certain products, engaging in certain business practices, or requiring other remedies, such as compulsory licensing of patents. An 
unfavorable outcome can result in a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition, and results of operations. Regardless of 
the outcome, litigation and regulatory proceedings can be costly, time-consuming, disruptive to our operations, harmful to our reputation, 
and distracting to management.

We must attract, retain, and motivate key employees. 
We believe that hiring and retaining qualified executives, scientists, engineers, technical staff, and sales representatives are critical to our 
business. The competition for highly skilled employees in our industry is intense. Competitors for technical talent increasingly seek to hire 
our employees, and the increased availability of flexible, hybrid, or work-from-home arrangements has both intensified and expanded 
competition. In addition, changes in immigration policies may further limit the pool of available talent and impair our ability to recruit and 
hire technical and professional talent. From time to time, we have intensified our efforts to recruit and retain talent, such as during 2021 
and the first half of 2022, and these efforts have increased our expenses. Further, we may not be successful in attracting, retaining, and 
motivating the workforce necessary to deliver on our strategy, and we have been required to curtail our planned hiring or reduce our 
workforce to respond to business conditions that differ from our expectations, which can be disruptive, compromise our ability to deliver on 
our strategy and workforce goals, and impact our ability to recruit in the future. Changes in employment-related laws applicable to our 
workforce practices may also result in increased expenses and less flexibility in how we meet our changing workforce needs. To help 
attract, retain, and motivate qualified employees, we use share-based awards, such as RSUs, and performance-based cash incentive 
awards. Sustained declines in our stock price, or lower stock price performance relative to competitors have been reducing the retention 
value of our share-based awards, which can impact the competitiveness of our compensation. Our employee hiring and retention also 
depend on our ability to build and maintain a diverse and inclusive workplace culture and be viewed as an employer of choice. To the 
extent our compensation programs and workplace culture are not viewed as competitive, or changes in our workforce and related 
restructuring, reduction-in-force or other initiatives are not viewed favorably, our ability to attract, retain, and motivate employees can be 
weakened, which could harm our results of operations. In addition, significant or prolonged turnover may negatively impact our operations 
and culture, as well as our ability to successfully maintain our processes and procedures, including due to the loss of historical, technical, 
and other expertise.
Changes in our management team can also disrupt our business. For example, we appointed a new CFO in January 2022 and made 
several other changes to our senior leadership during the past year. The failure to successfully transition and assimilate key employees 
could adversely affect our results of operations. To the extent we do not effectively hire, onboard, retain, and motivate key employees, our 
business can be harmed.
We are subject to risks associated with our strategic transactions.
Our acquisitions, divestitures, and other strategic transactions could fail to achieve our financial or strategic objectives, disrupt our 
ongoing business, and adversely impact our results of operations. Strategic transactions are an important component of our financial 
capital allocation strategy. We routinely evaluate opportunities and enter into agreements for possible acquisitions, divestitures, and other 
strategic transactions, including novel transactions such as our 2022 joint investment with Brookfield in the manufacturing expansion of 
our Ocotillo campus, and the divestiture of our NAND memory business. These transactions involve numerous risks, including:
▪
our inability to identify opportunities in a timely manner or on terms acceptable to us;
▪
failure of the transaction to advance our business strategy and failure of its anticipated benefits to materialize;
▪
disruption of our ongoing operations and diversion of our management's attention;
▪
failure of partners to satisfy financial or other obligations on which we rely;
▪
our inability to exercise sole decision-making authority regarding a project, property, or entity;
▪
failure to complete a transaction in a timely manner, if at all, due to our inability to obtain required government or other approvals at all
or without materially burdensome conditions, mandated acquisitions, divestitures, or disposals, IP disputes or other litigation, difficulty
in obtaining financing on terms acceptable to us, or other unforeseen factors;
▪
our failure to realize a satisfactory return on our investment, potentially resulting in an impairment of goodwill and other assets, and
restructuring charges;
▪
our inability to effectively enter new market segments through our strategic transactions or retain customers and partners of acquired
businesses;
▪
our inability to retain key personnel of acquired or majority-owned businesses or our difficulty in integrating employees, business
systems, and technology or otherwise operating the acquired business;
▪
controls, processes, and procedures of acquired or majority-owned businesses that do not adequately ensure compliance with laws
and regulations, and our failure to identify compliance issues or liabilities;
▪
our inability to resolve impasses or disputes with partners, including as a result of differences in our interests or goals;
▪
our failure to identify, or our underestimation of, commitments, liabilities, and other risks associated with acquired businesses or
assets, majority-owned businesses or novel transactions; and
▪
the potential for our transactions to result in dilutive issuances of our equity securities or significant additional debt.
Any of these risks could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition, or cash flows, 
particularly in the case of a large acquisition, divestiture or partial divestiture or several concurrent strategic transactions. Moreover, our 
resources are limited and our decision to pursue a transaction has opportunity costs; accordingly, if we pursue a particular transaction, we 
at times need to forgo the prospect of entering into other transactions or otherwise investing our resources in a manner that could help us 
achieve our financial or strategic objectives. 
Where an existing investment does not strategically align to our key priorities, we routinely evaluate opportunities for possible divestitures 
and other options. We may not realize the anticipated benefits of divestitures due to risks that include unfavorable prices and terms;

changes in market conditions or geopolitical conditions affecting the regions or industries in which we or counterparties operate; changes 
in applicable laws; failure to receive regulatory or governmental approvals; limitations or restrictions due to regulatory or governmental 
approvals, litigation, contractual terms, or other conditions; delays in closing; lack of support by third parties; actions by competitors; 
adverse effects on our business relationships, operating results, or business due to the announcement and pendency of such 
transactions; and continued financial obligations, unanticipated liabilities, or transition costs associated with such transactions. In some 
cases, we are not able to divest investments on acceptable terms or at all.
We invest in public and private companies and do not always realize a return on our investments. We make investments in public and 
private companies to further our strategic and financial objectives and to support certain key business initiatives. These companies can 
include early-stage companies still defining their strategic direction. Many of the instruments in which we invest are non-marketable and 
illiquid at the time of our initial investment, and we are not always able to achieve a return in a timely fashion, if at all. Our ability to realize 
a return on our investment in a private company, if any, is typically dependent on the company participating in a liquidity event, such as a 
public offering or acquisition. To the extent any of the companies in which we invest are not successful, which at times includes 
bankruptcy, we could recognize an impairment and/or lose all or part of our investment.
We face risks related to our debt obligations.
Our debt obligations could adversely affect our business and financial condition, including our ability to implement our strategy. We 
currently have $39.3 billion in aggregate principal amount of senior unsecured notes outstanding. In addition, we have a commercial 
paper program of up to $10.0 billion and credit facilities to backstop these programs and otherwise provide access to committed capital of 
up to $10.0 billion. From time to time, we may incur additional indebtedness, refinance our existing debt, and issue additional notes or 
other debt securities in the future at a variety of interest rates, maturities, and terms. The semiconductor industry is a cyclical business 
and our revenue, cash flows, and outlook often fluctuate in accordance with this cycle, as well as prevailing macroeconomic conditions, 
our business strategy, and other risks described in these risk factors. These fluctuations, together with our debt level and related debt 
service obligations, could have the effect of, among other things, reducing our flexibility to respond to changing business and economic 
conditions and increasing the risk of a future downgrade in our credit ratings that can potentially impact the value of our outstanding debt 
and increase our borrowing costs. We may also be required to raise additional financing for working capital, capital expenditures, debt 
service obligations, debt refinancing, future acquisitions, or other general corporate purposes, which will depend on, among other factors, 
our financial position and performance, as well as prevailing market conditions and other factors beyond our control. Consequently, we 
may not be able to obtain additional financing or refinancing on terms acceptable to us, or at all, which could adversely impact our ability 
to service to repay, outstanding indebtedness as it becomes due and could adversely impact our business, financial condition, and the 
cost of borrowing. 
We are subject to sales-related risks. 
We face risks related to sales through distributors and other third parties. We sell a significant portion of our products through third parties, 
such as distributors, value-added resellers, and channel partners (collectively referred to as distributors), as well as OEMs and ODMs. We 
depend on many distributors to help us create end-customer demand, provide technical support and other value-added services to 
customers, fill customer orders, and stock our products. At times, we rely on one or more key distributors for a product, and a material 
change in our relationship with one or more of these distributors or their failure to perform as expected could reduce our revenue. Our 
ability to add or replace distributors for some of our products is limited. In addition, our distributors' expertise in the determination and 
stocking of acceptable inventory levels for some of our products is not always easily transferable to a new distributor; as a result, end 
customers may be hesitant to accept the addition or replacement of a distributor. Using third parties for distribution exposes us to many 
risks, including competitive pressure and concentration, credit, and compliance risks. Distributors and other third parties sell products that 
compete with our products, and we sometimes need to provide financial and other incentives to focus them on the sale of our products. 
From time to time, they face financial difficulties, including bankruptcy, which could harm our collection of accounts receivable and 
financial results. Violations of the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act or similar laws by distributors or other third-party intermediaries could 
have a material impact on our business. Failure to manage risks related to our use of distributors and other third parties may reduce 
sales, increase expenses, and weaken our competitive position.
From time to time, our products are resold by third parties in an unauthorized "gray market." Our policies and procedures designed to 
keep our products away from the gray market may not be successful in achieving this objective. Gray market products can distort demand 
and pricing dynamics in our distribution channel and certain geographies, which at times adversely affects our revenue opportunities. 
Gray market activity is difficult to monitor and can make forecasting demand more challenging. Gray market products also sometimes 
include parts that have been altered or damaged, and our reputation may be harmed when these products fail or are found to be 
substandard. 
We receive a significant portion of our revenue from a limited number of customers. Collectively, our three largest customers accounted 
for 42% of our net revenue in 2022, 43% of our net revenue in 2021 and 39% of our net revenue in 2020. We expect a small number of 
customers will continue to account for a significant portion of our revenue in the foreseeable future.

Industry trends, such as the increasing shift of data center workloads to the public cloud, have increased the significance and purchasing 
power of certain customers, particularly cloud service providers, in some of our data center-focused businesses. The cloud and cloud 
applications represent a new and increasingly demanding computing environment. The further consolidation of computing workloads in 
the cloud, and consolidation among cloud service providers, can heighten the competitive importance of factors such as collaboration and 
customization with cloud service provider customers to optimize products for their environments; optimization for cloud services and 
applications; product performance; energy efficiency; feature differentiation; product quality, reliability, and factors affecting server uptime; 
and product security and security features. Our competitive position can be eroded to the extent we do not execute effectively across 
these factors. We are operating in an increasingly competitive environment, including serving cloud service provider customers, and the 
competitive environment adversely affected our results in DCAI in 2022. 
Some cloud service provider customers have also internally developed, and may continue to develop, their own semiconductors, including 
designs customized for their specific computing workloads. In addition, cloud services can be marketed to end users based on service 
levels or features rather than hardware specifications, or they can abstract hardware under layers of software, which can make it more 
difficult to differentiate our products to customers and end users. The shift of data center workloads to the cloud has also adversely 
affected, and may continue to affect, sales to enterprise and government market segment customers when end users have elected to 
migrate workloads. To the extent we differentiate our products through customization to meet cloud customer specifications, order 
changes, delays, or cancellations may result in non-recoverable costs. 
The loss of key customers, a substantial reduction in sales to them, or changes in the timing of their orders can lead to a reduction in our 
revenue, increase the volatility of our results, and harm our results of operations and financial condition. For more information about our 
customers, including customers who accounted for greater than 10% of our net consolidated revenue, see "Note 3: Operating Segments" 
within the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.
We face risks related to transactions with government entities. We receive proceeds from domestic and foreign, local, regional, and 
national governments associated with grants, incentives, and sales of our products and services. Government demand and payment are 
often affected by public sector budgetary cycles and funding authorizations, including, with respect to US government contracts, 
congressional approval of appropriations. Government contracts are subject to procurement laws and regulations relating to the award, 
administration, and performance of those contracts, as well as oversight and penalties for violations. For example, certain agreements 
with the US government are subject to special rules on accounting, IP rights, expenses, reviews, information handling, security, 
customers, and/or employees, and failure or inability to comply with these rules could result in civil and criminal penalties and sanctions, 
including termination of contracts, fines, and suspension or debarment from future business with the US government.
We have fluctuations in our stock price and the amount and frequency of our stock repurchases. 
Our stock price can experience periods of significant volatility. For example, in 2022, our stock price ranged from a closing high of $55.91 
to a closing low of $25.04. Changes in stock price or volume can also occur for the semiconductor industry more broadly, and may occur 
without regard to underlying company performance. Changes in our stock price can be driven by a variety of factors within or outside of 
our control, including the risks described above in these risk factors, as well as: fluctuations in national and global markets; fluctuations in 
our operating results and projections; announcements by us or our competitors; sentiment, speculation, valuation, analyses, or 
recommendations of stock analysts, social media, and the press; our credit rating; changes in holders of our stock; significant litigation or 
regulatory actions; and other periodic events.
We are not obligated to make repurchases under our stock repurchase program. The amount, timing, and execution of any share 
repurchases fluctuate based on factors that include prioritizing cash for other purposes, such as investing in our business, including 
operational spending, capital spending, and acquisitions, returning cash to our stockholders as dividend payments, and any regulatory 
restrictions. Our stock repurchase program may be suspended or terminated at any time. Moreover, we cannot guarantee that 
repurchases will enhance long-term stockholder value. We expect our future stock repurchases to be significantly below our levels from 
the last few years. For example, in 2022, we did not repurchase any shares under our authorized stock repurchase program.

Issuer Purchases of Equity Securities
We have an ongoing authorization, originally approved by our Board of Directors in 2005 and subsequently amended, to repurchase 
shares of our common stock in open market or negotiated transactions. No shares were repurchased during the year ending 
December 31, 2022. As of December 31, 2022, we were authorized to repurchase up to $110 billion, of which $7.2 billion remained 
available.
We issue RSUs as part of our equity incentive plans. In our Consolidated Financial Statements, we treat shares of common stock withheld 
for tax purposes on behalf of our employees in connection with the vesting of RSUs as common stock repurchases because they reduce 
the number of shares that would have been issued upon vesting. These withheld shares of common stock are not considered common 
stock repurchases under our authorized common stock repurchase program.

Disclosure Pursuant to Section 13(r) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934
Section 13(r) of the Exchange Act requires an issuer to disclose certain information in its periodic reports if it or any of its affiliates 
knowingly engaged in certain activities, transactions, or dealings with individuals or entities subject to specific US economic sanctions 
during the reporting period, even when the activities, transactions, or dealings are conducted in compliance with applicable law. On March 
2, 2021, the US Secretary of State designated the Federal Security Service of the Russian Federation (FSB) as a party subject to one 
such sanction. From time to time, our local subsidiary is required to engage with the FSB as a licensing authority and file documents in 
order to conduct business within the Russian Federation. All such dealings are explicitly authorized by General License 1B issued by the 
US Department of the Treasury’s Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC), and there are no gross revenues or net profits directly 
associated with any such dealings by us with the FSB. We plan to continue these activities as required to conduct business in the Russian 
Federation to the extent permitted by applicable law.
On April 15, 2021, the US Department of the Treasury designated Pozitiv Teknolodzhiz, AO (Positive Technologies), a Russian IT security 
firm, as a party subject to one of the sanctions specified in Section 13(r). Prior to the designation, we communicated with Positive 
Technologies regarding its IT security research and coordinated disclosure of security vulnerabilities identified by the firm. Based on a 
license issued by OFAC, we resumed such communications. There are no gross revenues or net profits directly associated with any such 
activities. We plan to continue these communications in accordance with the terms and conditions of the OFAC license.

Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm
To the Stockholders and the Board of Directors of Intel Corporation
Opinion on the Financial Statements
We have audited the accompanying Consolidated Balance Sheets of Intel Corporation (the Company) as of December 31, 2022 and 
December 25, 2021, the related Consolidated Statements of Income, Comprehensive Income, Cash Flows and Stockholders' Equity for 
each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2022, and the related notes (collectively referred to as the "Consolidated 
Financial Statements"). In our opinion, the Consolidated Financial Statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position 
of the Company at December 31, 2022 and December 25, 2021, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three 
years in the period ended December 31, 2022, in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. 
We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), 
the Company's internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2022, based on criteria established in Internal Control—
Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (2013 framework) and our 
report dated January 26, 2023 expressed an unqualified opinion thereon.
Basis for Opinion
These financial statements are the responsibility of the Company's management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the 
Company's financial statements based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be 
independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of 
the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB. 
We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to 
obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. Our 
audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to error or 
fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding 
the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and 
significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements. We believe that our 
audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion. 
Critical Audit Matter
The critical audit matter communicated below is a matter arising from the current period audit of the financial statements that was 
communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that: (1) relates to accounts or disclosures that are material to 
the financial statements and (2) involved our especially challenging, subjective or complex judgments. The communication of the critical 
audit matter does not alter in any way our opinion on the Consolidated Financial Statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by 
communicating the critical audit matter below, providing a separate opinion on the critical audit matter or on the accounts or disclosures to 
which it relates.
Auditor's Reports

Inventory Valuation
Description of the 
Matter
The Company's net inventory totaled $13.2 billion as of December 31, 2022, representing 7.3% of total assets. 
As explained in "Note 2: Accounting Policies" within the Consolidated Financial Statements, the Company 
computes inventory cost on a first-in, first-out basis, and applies judgment in determining saleability of 
products and the valuation of inventories. The Company assesses inventory at each reporting date in order to 
assert that it is recorded at net realizable value, giving consideration to, among other factors: whether the 
products have achieved the substantive engineering milestones to qualify for sale to customers; the 
determination of normal capacity levels in its manufacturing process to determine which manufacturing 
overhead costs can be included in the valuation of inventory; whether the product is valued at the lower of cost 
or net realizable value; and the estimation of excess and obsolete inventory or that which is not of saleable 
quality. 
Auditing management's assessment of net realizable value for inventory was challenging because the 
determination of lower of cost or net realizable value and excess and obsolete inventory reserves is 
judgmental and considers a number of factors that are affected by market and economic conditions, such as 
customer forecasts, dynamic pricing environments, and industry supply and demand. Additionally, for certain 
new product launches there is limited historical data with which to evaluate forecasts.
How We Addressed 
the Matter in Our 
Audit
We evaluated and tested the design and operating effectiveness of the Company's internal controls over the 
costing of inventory, the determination of whether inventory is of saleable quality, the calculation of lower of 
cost or net realizable value reserves including related estimated costs and selling prices, and the 
determination of demand forecasts and related application against on hand inventory.
Our audit procedures included, among others, testing the significant assumptions (e.g., estimated product 
costs and selling prices, and product demand forecasts) and the underlying data used in management's 
inventory valuation assessment. We compared the significant assumptions used by management to current 
industry and economic trends. We assessed whether there were any potential sources of contrary information, 
including historical forecast accuracy or history of significant revisions to previously recorded inventory 
valuation adjustments, and performed sensitivity analyses over significant assumptions to evaluate the 
changes in inventory valuation that would result from changes in the assumptions.

Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm
To the Stockholders and the Board of Directors of Intel Corporation
Opinion on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting
We have audited Intel Corporation's internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2022, based on criteria established in 
Internal Control—Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (2013 
framework), (the COSO criteria). In our opinion, Intel Corporation (the Company) maintained, in all material respects, effective internal 
control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2022, based on the COSO criteria.
We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), 
the 2022 Consolidated Financial Statements of the Company and our report dated January 26, 2023 expressed an unqualified opinion 
thereon.
Basis for Opinion
The Company's management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the 
effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting included in the accompanying Management Report on Internal Control Over 
Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company's internal control over financial reporting based on our 
audit. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in 
accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and 
the PCAOB. 
We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to 
obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. 
Our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness 
exists, testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk, and performing such 
other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our 
opinion.
Definition and Limitations of Internal Control Over Financial Reporting
A company's internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of 
financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting 
principles. A company's internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance 
of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) 
provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance 
with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with 
authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely 
detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company's assets that could have a material effect on the financial 
statements. 
Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of 
any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in 
conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements
Note 1 : Basis of Presentation
We have a 52- or 53-week fiscal year that ends on the last Saturday in December. Fiscal year 2022 was a 53-week fiscal year. Fiscal 
years 2021 and 2020 were 52-week fiscal years. Fiscal 2023 is a 52-week fiscal year. Our Consolidated Financial Statements include the 
accounts of Intel and our wholly-owned and majority-owned subsidiaries, which include entities consolidated under the variable interest 
model. We have eliminated intercompany accounts and transactions. We have reclassified certain prior period amounts to conform to 
current period presentation.
In the first quarter of 2022, we reclassified the presentation of cash paid and received under our credit support annex agreements with 
derivative counterparties within our Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows. These reclassifications better reflect the economic intent of 
the credit support annex agreements, and result in changes to amounts previously reported for net cash provided by (used for) operating, 
investing, and financing activities.
In the first quarter of 2022, we reclassified the presentation of certain marketable debt investments within our Consolidated Balance 
Sheets, combining all marketable debt investments with original contractual maturities of three months or more into short-term 
investments as they represent the investment of cash available for current operations. These reclassifications simplify our Consolidated 
Balance Sheets and result in changes to amounts previously reported as short-term investments, trading assets, and other long-term 
investments.
Use of Estimates
The preparation of Consolidated Financial Statements in conformity with US GAAP requires us to make estimates and judgments that 
affect the amounts reported in our Consolidated Financial Statements and the accompanying notes. The actual results that we experience 
may differ materially from our estimates.
Note 2 : Accounting Policies
Revenue Recognition
We recognize net product revenue when we satisfy performance obligations as evidenced by the transfer of control of our products or 
services to customers. Substantially all of our revenue is derived from product sales. Our products often include a software component, 
such as firmware, that is highly interdependent and interrelated with the product and is substantially accounted for as a combined 
performance obligation. In accordance with contract terms, the revenue for combined performance obligations and standalone product 
sales is recognized at the time of product shipment from our facilities or delivery to the customer location, as determined by the agreed-
upon shipping terms. 
We measure revenue based on the amount of consideration we expect to be entitled to in exchange for products or services. Variable 
consideration is estimated and reflected as an adjustment to the transaction price. We determine variable consideration, which consists 
primarily of various sales price concessions, by estimating the most likely amount of consideration we expect to receive from the customer 
based on historical analysis of customer purchase volumes. Sales rebates earned by customers are offset against their receivable 
balances. Rebates earned by customers when they do not have outstanding receivable balances are recorded within other accrued 
liabilities.
We make payments to our customers through cooperative advertising programs for marketing activities for some of our products. We 
generally record the payment as a reduction in revenue in the period that the revenue is earned, unless the payment is for a distinct 
service, which we record as an expense when the marketing activities occur.

Inventories
We compute inventory cost on a first-in, first-out basis. Our process and product development life cycle corresponds with substantive 
engineering milestones. These engineering milestones are regularly and consistently applied in assessing the point at which our activities 
and associated costs change in nature from R&D to cost of sales, and when cost of sales can be capitalized as inventory. 
For a product to be manufactured in high volumes and sold to our customers under our standard warranty, it must meet our rigorous 
technical quality specifications. This milestone is known as PRQ. We have identified PRQ as the point at which the costs incurred to 
manufacture our products are included in the valuation of inventory. A single PRQ has previously valued inventory up to $870 million in the 
quarter the PRQ milestone was achieved. Prior to PRQ, costs that do not meet the criteria for R&D are included in cost of sales in the 
period incurred.
The valuation of inventory includes determining which fixed production overhead costs can be included in inventory based on the normal 
capacity of our manufacturing and assembly and test facilities. We apply our historical loadings compared to our total available capacity in 
a statistical model to determine our normal capacity level. If the factory loadings are below the established normal capacity level, a portion 
of our fixed production overhead costs would not be included in the cost of inventory; instead, it would be recognized as cost of sales in 
that period. We refer to these costs as excess capacity charges. Excess capacity charges were $423 million in 2022 and insignificant in 
the comparative periods presented. Charges in years prior to those presented have ranged up to $1.1 billion taken in a particular fiscal 
year, such as in connection with the 2009 economic recession.
Inventory is valued at the lower of cost or net realizable value, based upon assumptions about future demand and market conditions. 
Product-specific facts and circumstances reviewed in the inventory valuation process include a review of our customer base, the stage of 
the product life cycle, variations in market pricing, and an assessment of selling price in relation to product cost. Lower of cost or net 
realizable value inventory reserves fluctuate as we ramp new process technologies, with costs generally improving over time due to scale 
and improved yields. Additionally, inventory valuation is impacted by cyclical changes in market conditions and the associated pricing 
environment.
The valuation of inventory also requires us to estimate obsolete and excess inventory, as well as inventory that is not of saleable quality. 
We use a demand forecast to develop our short-term manufacturing plans to enable consistency between inventory valuations and build 
decisions. For certain new products, we have limited historical data when developing these demand forecasts. We compare the estimate 
of future demand to work in process and finished goods inventory levels to determine the amount, if any, of obsolete or excess inventory. 
When our demand forecast for specific products is greater than actual demand and we fail to reduce manufacturing output accordingly, we 
write off amounts considered to be excess inventory. 
Long-Lived Assets
Property, Plant and Equipment
We compute depreciation using the straight-line method over the estimated useful life of assets. We also capitalize interest on borrowings 
related to eligible capital expenditures. Capitalized interest is added to the cost of qualified assets and depreciated together with that 
asset cost. 
At least annually, we evaluate the period over which we expect to recover the economic value of our property, plant and equipment, 
considering factors such as the process technology cadence between node transitions, changes in machinery and equipment technology, 
and re-use of machinery and tools across each generation of process technology. As we make manufacturing process conversions and 
other factory planning decisions, we use assumptions involving the use of management judgments regarding the remaining useful lives of 
assets, primarily process-specific semiconductor manufacturing tools and building improvements. When we determine that the useful lives 
of assets are shorter or longer than we had originally estimated, we adjust the rate of depreciation to reflect the assets' revised useful 
lives. Based on our latest evaluation, effective January 2023, the estimated useful life of certain machinery and equipment in our wafer 
fabrication facilities will increase from 5 to 8 years. This change in estimate will be applied prospectively beginning in the first quarter of 
2023.
Assets are categorized and evaluated for impairment at the lowest level of identifiable cash flows. Factors that we consider in deciding 
when to perform an impairment review include significant under-performance of a business or product line in relation to expectations, 
significant negative industry or economic trends, and significant changes or planned changes in our use and fungibility of the assets. If an 
asset grouping carrying value is not recoverable through the related undiscounted cash flows, the asset grouping is considered to be 
impaired.
Identified Intangible Assets
We amortize acquisition-related intangible assets that are subject to amortization over their estimated useful lives. Acquisition-related, in-
process R&D assets represent the fair value of incomplete R&D projects that had not reached technological feasibility as of the date of 
acquisition; initially, these are classified as in-process R&D and are not subject to amortization. Once these R&D projects are completed, 
the asset balances are transferred from in-process R&D to acquisition-related developed technology and are subject to amortization from 
that point forward. The asset balances relating to projects that are abandoned after acquisition are impaired and expensed to R&D.
Financial Statements
Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements

We perform periodic reviews of significant finite-lived identified intangible assets to determine whether facts and circumstances indicate 
that the carrying amount may not be recoverable. These reviews can be affected by various factors, including external factors such as 
industry and economic trends, and internal factors such as changes in our business strategy and our forecasts for specific product lines. 
Periodically, we also evaluate the estimated remaining useful lives of purchased intangible assets and whether events or changes in 
circumstances warrant a revision to the remaining periods of amortization. We may adjust the period over which these assets are 
amortized to reflect the period in which they contribute to our cash flows.
Goodwill
Our reporting units are the same as our operating segments. We evaluate our reporting units annually or when triggered, such as upon 
reorganization of our operating segments. We perform an annual impairment assessment of goodwill at the reporting unit level in the 
fourth quarter of each year, or more frequently if indicators of potential impairment exist. The reporting unit's carrying value used in an 
impairment assessment represents the assignment of various assets and liabilities, excluding certain corporate assets and liabilities, such 
as cash, investments, and debt. The impairment assessment may include both qualitative and quantitative factors to assess the likelihood 
of an impairment.
Qualitative factors used include industry and market considerations, overall financial performance, and other relevant events and factors 
affecting the reporting unit. We may also perform a quantitative analysis to support the qualitative factors by applying sensitivities to 
assumptions and inputs used in measuring a reporting unit's fair value.
Our quantitative impairment assessment considers both the income approach and the market approach to estimate a reporting unit's fair 
value. Significant estimates include market segment growth rates, our assumed market segment share, estimated gross margins, 
operating expenses, and discount rates based on a reporting unit's weighted average cost of capital. We test the reasonableness of the 
inputs and outcomes of our discounted cash flow analysis against available market data. These estimates change from year to year 
based on operating results, market conditions, and other factors and could materially affect the determination of each reporting unit's fair 
value and potential goodwill impairment for each reporting unit. Our quantitative assessment is sensitive to changes in underlying 
estimates and assumptions, the most sensitive of which is the discount rate.
Our 2022 annual qualitative assessment indicated that a more detailed quantitative analysis was necessary for one of our reporting units. 
No impairment was required, even when considering a hypothetical increase in the discount rate of 1%, which would cause a material 
decrease in the estimated fair value of the reporting unit.
Government Incentives
We enter into government incentive arrangements with domestic and foreign, local, regional, and national governments, which vary in 
size, duration, and conditions. These arrangements allow us to maintain a market-comparable foothold across various geographies. We 
receive capital-related and operating grants, the benefits of which generally offset the cost of acquired capital and other expenses and are 
primarily structured as cash grants and non-income tax incentives. Government grants, including non-income tax incentives, are 
recognized when there is reasonable assurance that the grant will be received and we will comply with the conditions specified in the 
grant agreement. We are eligible to receive these grants because we engage in qualifying capital investments, research and 
development, and other activities as defined by the relevant government entities awarding the grants. Each grant agreement requires that 
we comply with certain conditions, including achievement of future operational targets and committing to minimum levels of capital 
investment. 
We record capital-related grants as a reduction to property, plant and equipment, net within our Consolidated Balance Sheets and 
recognize a reduction to depreciation and amortization expense over the useful life of the corresponding acquired asset. We record 
operating grants as a reduction to expense in the same line item on the Consolidated Statements of Income as the expenditure for which 
the grant is intended to compensate. Capital-related grants reduced gross property, plant and equipment by $3.3 billion as of 
December 31, 2022, of which $373 million was recognized in 2022. Contra-depreciation expense reduced cost of sales by $230 million in 
2022. A majority of operating grants are recognized as a reduction to cost of sales, benefiting operating income by $104 million in 2022. 
Capital-related and operating grants receivables totaled $437 million as of December 31, 2022 and a substantial majority of the capital-
related and operating grants receivables were reflected within other long-term assets on our Consolidated Balance Sheets.

Fair Value
When determining fair value, we consider the principal or most advantageous market in which we would transact, as well as assumptions 
that market participants would use when pricing the asset or liability. Our financial assets are measured and recorded at fair value on a 
recurring basis, except for equity securities measured using the measurement alternative, equity method investments, and grants 
receivable. We assess fair value hierarchy levels for our issued debt and fixed-income investment portfolio based on the underlying 
instrument type.
The three levels of inputs that may be used to measure fair value are: 
▪
Level 1. Quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities. We evaluate security-specific market data when determining
whether a market is active.
▪
Level 2. Observable inputs other than Level 1 prices, such as quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities, quoted prices in less active
markets, or model-derived valuations. All significant inputs used in our valuations, such as discounted cash flows, are observable or
can be derived principally from or corroborated with observable market data for substantially the full term of the assets or liabilities.
We use LIBOR- and SOFR-based yield curves, overnight indexed swap curves, currency spot and forward rates, and credit ratings
as significant inputs in our valuations. Level 2 inputs also include non-binding market consensus prices, as well as quoted prices that
were adjusted for security-specific restrictions. When we use non-binding market consensus prices, we corroborate them with quoted
market prices for similar instruments or compare them to output from internally developed pricing models such as discounted cash
flow models.
▪
Level 3. Unobservable inputs to the valuation methodology that are significant to the measurement of the fair value of assets or
liabilities. We monitor and review the inputs and results of these valuation models to help confirm that the fair value measurements
are reasonable and consistent with market experience in similar asset classes. Level 3 inputs also include non-binding market
consensus prices or non-binding broker quotes that we were unable to corroborate with observable market data.
Debt Investments
Debt investments include investments in corporate debt, government debt, and financial institution instruments. Debt investments with 
original maturities of approximately three months or less from the date of purchase are classified within cash and cash equivalents. Debt 
investments with original maturities at the date of purchase greater than approximately three months are classified as short-term 
investments, as they represent the investment of cash available for current operations.  
For certain of our marketable debt investments, we economically hedge market risks at inception with a related derivative instrument, or 
the marketable debt investment itself is used to economically hedge currency exchange rate risk from remeasurement. These hedged 
investments are reported at fair value. Gains or losses on these investments arising from changes in fair value due to interest rate and 
currency market fluctuations and credit market volatility, largely offset by losses or gains on the related derivative instruments and balance 
sheet remeasurement, are recorded in interest and other, net. Our remaining unhedged marketable debt investments are reported at fair 
value, with unrealized gains or losses, net of tax, recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss). We determine the cost of 
the investment sold based on an average cost basis at the individual security level and record the interest income and realized gains or 
losses on the sale of these investments in interest and other, net.
Unhedged debt investments are subject to periodic impairment reviews. For investments in an unrealized loss position, we determine 
whether a credit loss exists by considering information about the collectability of the instrument, current market conditions, and reasonable 
and supportable forecasts of economic conditions. We recognize an allowance for credit losses, up to the amount of the unrealized loss 
when appropriate, and write down the amortized cost basis of the investment if it is more likely than not we will be required or we intend to 
sell the investment before recovery of its amortized cost basis. Allowances for credit losses and write-downs are recognized in interest 
and other, net, and unrealized losses not related to credit losses are recognized in other comprehensive income (loss).
Equity Investments
We regularly invest in equity securities of public and private companies to promote business and strategic objectives. Equity investments 
are measured and recorded as follows: 
▪
Marketable equity securities are equity securities with RDFV that are measured and recorded at fair value on a recurring basis with
changes in fair value, whether realized or unrealized, recorded through the income statement.
▪
Non-marketable equity securities are equity securities without RDFV that are measured and recorded using a measurement
alternative that measures the securities at cost minus impairment, if any, plus or minus changes resulting from qualifying observable
price changes.
▪
Equity method investments are equity securities in investees we do not control but over which we have the ability to exercise
significant influence. Equity method investments are measured at cost minus impairment, if any, plus or minus our share of equity
method investee income or loss. Our proportionate share of the income or loss from equity method investments is recognized on a
one-quarter lag.
Financial Statements
Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements
84


Realized and unrealized gains and losses resulting from changes in fair value or the sale of our equity investments are recorded in gains 
(losses) on equity investments, net. The carrying value of our non-marketable equity securities is adjusted for qualifying observable price 
changes resulting from the issuance of similar or identical securities in an orderly transaction by the same issuer. Determining whether an 
observed transaction is similar to a security within our portfolio requires judgment based on the rights and preferences of the securities. 
Recording upward and downward adjustments to the carrying value of our equity securities as a result of observable price changes 
requires quantitative assessments of the fair value of our securities using various valuation methodologies and involves the use of 
estimates. 
Non-marketable equity securities and equity method investments (collectively referred to as non-marketable equity investments) are also 
subject to periodic impairment reviews. Our quarterly impairment analysis considers both qualitative and quantitative factors that may 
have a significant impact on the investee's fair value. Qualitative factors considered include the investee's financial condition and business 
outlook, industry and sector performance, market for technology, operational and financing cash flow activities, and other relevant events 
and factors affecting the investee. When indicators of impairment exist, we prepare quantitative assessments of the fair value of our non-
marketable equity investments using both the market and income approaches, which require judgment and the use of estimates, including 
discount rates, investee revenue and costs, and comparable market data of private and public companies, among others. 
▪
Non-marketable equity securities are tested for impairment using a qualitative model similar to the model used for goodwill and
property, plant and equipment. Upon determining that an impairment may exist, the security's fair value is calculated and compared to
its carrying value and an impairment is recognized immediately if the carrying value exceeds the fair value.
▪
Equity method investments are subject to periodic impairment reviews using the other-than-temporary impairment model, which
considers the severity and duration of a decline in fair value below cost and our ability and intent to hold the investment for a sufficient
period of time to allow for recovery.
Impairments of equity investments are recorded in gains (losses) on equity investments, net.
Derivative Financial Instruments
Our primary objective for holding derivative financial instruments is to manage currency exchange rate risk and interest rate risk, and, to a 
lesser extent, equity market risk, commodity price risk, and credit risk. We enter into master netting arrangements to mitigate credit risk in 
derivative transactions by permitting net settlement of transactions with the same counterparty. We also enter into collateral security 
arrangements with certain of our counterparties to exchange cash collateral when the net fair value of certain derivative instruments 
fluctuates from contractually established thresholds. For presentation on our Consolidated Balance Sheets, we do not offset fair value 
amounts recognized for derivative instruments under master netting arrangements. Our derivative financial instruments, including related 
collateral amounts, are presented at fair value on a gross basis and are included in other current assets, other long-term assets, other 
accrued liabilities, or other long-term liabilities.
Cash flow hedges use foreign currency contracts, such as currency forwards and currency interest rate swaps, to hedge exposures for 
variability in the US-dollar equivalent of non-US-dollar-denominated cash flows associated with our forecasted operating and capital 
purchases spending.
The after-tax gains or losses from the effective portion of a cash flow hedge is reported as a component of accumulated other 
comprehensive income (loss) and reclassified into earnings in the same period or periods in which the hedged transaction affects 
earnings, and in the same line item on the Consolidated Statements of Income as the impact of the hedge transaction. For foreign 
currency contracts hedging our capital purchases, forward points are excluded from the hedge effectiveness assessment, and are 
recognized in earnings in the same income statement line item used to present the earnings effect of the hedged item. If the cash flow 
hedge transactions become improbable, the corresponding amounts deferred in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) would 
be immediately reclassified to interest and other, net. Cash flows associated with these derivatives are classified in the Consolidated 
Statements of Cash Flows in the same section as the underlying item.
Fair value hedges use interest rate contracts, such as interest rate swaps, to hedge against changes in the fair value on certain of our 
fixed-rate indebtedness attributable to changes in the benchmark interest rate. The gains or losses on these hedges, as well as the 
offsetting losses or gains related to the changes in the fair value of the underlying hedged item attributable to the hedged risk, are 
recognized in earnings in the current period, primarily in interest and other, net. Cash flows associated with these derivatives are 
classified in the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows in the same section as the underlying item, primarily within cash flows from 
financing activities.
Non-designated hedges use foreign currency contracts to economically hedge the functional currency equivalent cash flows of recognized 
monetary assets and liabilities, non-US-dollar-denominated debt instruments classified as hedged investments, and non-US-dollar-
denominated loans receivable recognized at fair value. We also use interest rate contracts to hedge interest rate risk related to our US-
dollar-denominated fixed-rate debt investments classified as hedged investments. The change in fair value of these derivatives is 
recorded through earnings in the line item on the Consolidated Statements of Income to which the derivatives most closely relate, 
primarily in interest and other, net. Changes in the fair value of the underlying assets and liabilities associated with the hedged risk are 
generally offset by the changes in the fair value of the related derivatives. 
Financial Statements
Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements

Credit Risk
Financial instruments that potentially subject us to concentrations of credit risk consist principally of investments in debt instruments, 
derivative financial instruments, loans receivable, reverse repurchase agreements, and trade receivables. We generally place investments 
with high-credit-quality counterparties and, by policy, we limit the amount of credit exposure to any one counterparty based on our 
analysis of that counterparty's relative credit standing. As required per our investment policy, substantially all of our investments in debt 
instruments are in investment-grade instruments. Credit-rating criteria for derivative instruments are similar to those for other investments. 
We enter into master netting arrangements to mitigate credit risk in derivative transactions by permitting net settlement of transactions 
with the same counterparty. Due to master netting arrangements, the amounts subject to credit risk related to derivative instruments are 
generally limited to the amounts, if any, by which the counterparty's obligations exceed our obligations with that counterparty. As of 
December 31, 2022, our total credit exposure to any single counterparty, excluding money market funds invested in US treasury and US 
agency securities and reverse repurchase agreements collateralized by treasury and agency securities, did not exceed $2.9 billion. To 
further reduce credit risk, we enter into collateral security arrangements with certain of our derivative counterparties and obtain and secure 
collateral from counterparties against obligations, including securities lending transactions when we deem it appropriate. Cash collateral 
exchanged under our collateral security arrangements is included in other current assets, other long-term assets, other accrued liabilities, 
or other long-term liabilities. For reverse repurchase agreements collateralized by other securities, we do not record the collateral as an 
asset or a liability unless the collateral is repledged.
A majority of our trade receivables are derived from sales to OEMs and ODMs. We also have accounts receivable derived from sales to 
industrial and communications equipment manufacturers in the computing and communications industries. We believe the net accounts 
receivable balances from our three largest customers (53% as of December 31, 2022) do not represent a significant credit risk, based on 
cash flow forecasts, balance sheet analysis, and past collection experience. 
We have adopted credit policies and standards intended to accommodate industry growth and inherent risk. We believe credit risks are 
moderated by the financial stability of our major customers. We assess credit risk through quantitative and qualitative analysis. From this 
analysis, we establish shipping and credit limits and determine whether we will seek to use one or more credit support protection devices, 
such as obtaining a parent guarantee, standby letter of credit, or credit insurance.
Variable Interest Entities
We have economic interests in entities that are VIEs. If we conclude we are the primary beneficiary of the VIE, we are required to 
consolidate the entity in our financial statements. To determine if we are the primary beneficiary, we evaluate whether we have the power 
to direct the activities that most significantly impact the VIE’s economic performance and the obligation to absorb losses or the right to 
receive benefits of the VIE that could potentially be significant to the VIE. Our evaluation includes identification of significant activities and 
an assessment of our ability to direct those activities based on governance provisions and arrangements to provide services to the VIE. 
Periodically, we assess whether any changes in our interest or relationship with the entity affect our determination of whether the entity is 
a VIE and, if so, whether we are the primary beneficiary.
Business Combinations
We allocate the purchase price paid for assets acquired and liabilities assumed in connection with our acquisitions based on their 
estimated fair values at the time of acquisition. This allocation involves a number of assumptions, estimates, and judgments in 
determining the fair value of the following:
▪
inventory; property, plant and equipment; pre-existing liabilities or legal claims; and contingent consideration; each as may be
applicable;
▪
intangible assets, including the valuation methodology, estimations of future cash flows, discount rates, market segment growth rates,
and our assumed market segment share, as well as the estimated useful life of intangible assets;
▪
deferred tax assets and liabilities, uncertain tax positions, and tax-related valuation allowances, which are initially estimated as of the
acquisition date; and
▪
goodwill as measured as the excess of consideration transferred over the net of the acquisition date fair values of the assets acquired
and the liabilities assumed.
Our assumptions and estimates are based upon comparable market data and information obtained from our management and the 
management of the acquired companies. We allocate goodwill to the reporting units of the business that are expected to benefit from the 
business combination.
Employee Equity Incentive Plans
We use the straight-line amortization method to recognize share-based compensation expense over the service period of the award, net 
of estimated forfeitures. Upon exercise, cancellation, forfeiture, or expiration of stock options, or upon vesting or forfeiture of RSUs, we 
eliminate deferred tax assets for options and RSUs with multiple vesting dates for each vesting period on a first-in, first-out basis as if 
each vesting period were a separate award.

For the majority of RSUs granted, the number of shares of common stock issued on the date the RSUs vest is net of the minimum 
statutory withholding requirements that we pay in cash to the appropriate taxing authorities on behalf of our employees. The obligation to 
pay the relevant taxing authority is contingent upon continued employment. In addition, the amount of the obligation is unknown, as it is 
based in part on the market price of our common stock when the awards vest.
Income Taxes
We compute the provision for income taxes using the asset and liability method, under which deferred tax assets and liabilities are 
recognized for the expected future tax consequences of temporary differences between the financial reporting and tax bases of assets 
and liabilities, and for operating losses and tax credit carryforwards. We measure deferred tax assets and liabilities using the currently 
enacted tax rates that apply to taxable income in effect for the years in which those tax assets are expected to be realized or settled. 
We assess the likelihood that we will be able to recover our deferred tax assets. If recovery is not likely, we must increase our provision for 
taxes by recording a valuation allowance against the deferred tax assets that we estimate will not ultimately be recoverable. We believe 
that we will ultimately recover the deferred tax assets recorded on our Consolidated Balance Sheets. Recovery of a portion of our 
deferred tax assets is affected by management's plans with respect to holding or disposing of certain investments; therefore, such 
changes could also affect our future provision for taxes.
We recognize tax benefits from uncertain tax positions only if (based on the technical merits of the position) it is more likely than not that 
the tax positions will be sustained on examination by the tax authority. The tax benefits recognized in the financial statements from such 
positions are measured based on the largest amount that is more than 50% likely to be realized upon ultimate settlement. We recognize 
interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits within the provision for (benefit from) taxes on the Consolidated Statements of 
Income.
We recognize the tax impact of including certain foreign earnings in US taxable income as a period cost. We have recognized deferred 
income taxes for local country income and withholding taxes that could be incurred on distributions of certain non-US earnings or for 
outside basis differences in our subsidiaries, because we do not plan to indefinitely reinvest such earnings and basis differences. 
Remittances of non-US earnings are based on estimates and judgments of projected cash flow needs, as well as the working capital and 
investment requirements of our non-US and US operations. Material changes in our estimates of cash, working capital, and investment 
needs in various jurisdictions could require repatriation of indefinitely reinvested non-US earnings, which could be subject to applicable 
non-US income and withholding taxes. 
Leases
Leases consist of real property and machinery and equipment. Our lease terms may include options to extend when it is reasonably 
certain that we will exercise such options. We have lease agreements with lease and non-lease components, and the non-lease 
components are accounted for separately and not included in our leased assets and corresponding liabilities. Payments on leases may be 
fixed or variable, and variable lease payments are based on output of the underlying leased assets.
Loss Contingencies
We are subject to loss contingencies, including various legal and regulatory proceedings, asserted and potential claims, liabilities related 
to repair or replacement of parts in connection with product defects, as well as product warranties and potential asset impairments that 
arise in the ordinary course of business and are subject to change, including due to sudden or rapid developments in proceedings or 
claims. An estimated loss from such contingencies is recognized as a charge to income if it is probable that a liability has been incurred 
and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated. We evaluate developments that could affect prior disclosures or previously-
accrued liabilities, and make adjustments as appropriate. Significant judgment is required to determine both likelihood of there being, and 
the estimated amount of, a loss related to such matters. If one or more of these matters were resolved against us for amounts in excess of 
management's estimates of losses, our results of operations and financial condition could be materially adversely affected.

Note 3 : Operating Segments
We previously announced several organizational changes that would accelerate the execution and innovation of our company by allowing 
us to capture growth in both large traditional markets and high-growth emerging markets. This includes reorganization of our business 
units to capture this growth and to provide increased transparency, focus, and accountability. As a result, we modified our segment 
reporting in the first quarter of 2022 to align to the previously announced business reorganization. All prior-period segment data has been 
retrospectively adjusted to reflect the way our CODM internally receives information and manages and monitors our operating segment 
performance starting in fiscal year 2022.
We manage our business through the following operating segments:
▪
Client Computing Group
▪
Data Center and AI
▪
Network and Edge
▪
Mobileye
▪
Accelerated Computing Systems and Graphics
▪
Intel Foundry Services
We derive a substantial majority of our revenue from our principal products that incorporate various components and technologies, 
including a microprocessor and chipset, a stand-alone SoC, or a multichip package, which are based on Intel architecture. 
CCG, DCAI, NEX and AXG are our reportable operating segments. Mobileye, and IFS do not meet the quantitative thresholds to qualify 
as reportable operating segments; however, we have elected to disclose the results of these non-reportable operating segments. AXG 
revenue includes integrated graphics royalties from our CCG and NEX operating segments and are recorded as if the sales or transfers 
were to third parties at prices that approximate market-based selling prices. When we enter into federal contracts, they are aligned to the 
sponsoring operating segment. 
We have sales and marketing, manufacturing, engineering, finance, and administration groups. Expenses for these groups are generally 
allocated to the operating segments.
We have an "all other" category that includes revenue, expenses, and charges such as:
▪
historical results of operations from divested businesses;
▪
results of operations of start-up businesses that support our initiatives;
▪
amounts included within restructuring and other charges;
▪
employee benefits, compensation, impairment charges, and other expenses not allocated to the operating segments (beginning the
first quarter of 2022, this includes all of our stock-based compensation); and
▪
acquisition-related costs, including amortization and any impairment of acquisition-related intangibles and goodwill.
The CODM, who is our CEO, allocates resources to and assesses the performance of each operating segment using information about 
the operating segment's revenue and operating income (loss). The CODM does not evaluate operating segments using discrete asset 
information and we do not identify or allocate assets by operating segments. Based on the interchangeable nature of our manufacturing 
and assembly and test assets, most of the related depreciation expense is not directly identifiable within our operating segments, as it is 
included in overhead cost pools and subsequently absorbed into inventory as each product passes through our manufacturing process. 
Because our products are then sold across multiple operating segments, it is impracticable to determine the total depreciation expense 
included as a component of each operating segment's operating income (loss) results. We do not allocate gains and losses from equity 
investments, interest and other income, share-based compensation, or taxes to our operating segments. Although the CODM uses 
operating income (loss) to evaluate the segments, operating costs included in one segment may benefit other segments. The accounting 
policies for segment reporting are the same as for Intel as a whole.

In 2022, we initiated the wind-down of our Intel Optane memory business, which is part of our DCAI operating segment. While Intel 
Optane is a leading technology, it was not aligned to our strategic priorities. Separately, we continue to embrace the CXL standard. As a 
result, we recognized an inventory impairment of $723 million in cost of sales on the Consolidated Statements of Income in 2022. The 
impairment charge is recognized as a Corporate charge in the "all other" category presented above. As we wind down the Intel Optane 
business, we expect to continue to meet existing customer commitments.
In 2022, our three largest customers accounted for 42% of our net revenue (43% in 2021 and 39% in 2020), with Dell Inc. accounting 
for 19% (21% in 2021 and 17% in 2020), Lenovo Group Limited accounting for 12% (12% in 2021 and 12% in 2020), and HP Inc. 
accounting for 11% (10% in 2021 and 10% in 2020). Substantially all of the revenue from these customers was from the sale of platforms 
and other components by the CCG and DCAI operating segments.

Note 4 : Non-Controlling Interests
Semiconductor Co-Investment Program 
In the fourth quarter of 2022, we closed a transaction with Brookfield Asset Management (Brookfield) resulting in the formation of Arizona 
Fab LLC (Arizona Fab), a VIE for which we and Brookfield own 51% and 49%, respectively. Because we are the primary beneficiary of the 
VIE, we fully consolidate the results of Arizona Fab into our consolidated financial statements. Generally, contributions will be made to, 
and distributions will be received from, Arizona Fab based on both parties’ proportional ownership. We will be the sole operator and 
majority owner of two new chip factories that will be constructed by Arizona Fab, and we will have the right to purchase 100% of the 
related factory output. Once production commences, we will be required to operate Arizona Fab at minimum production levels measured 
in wafer starts per week and will be required to limit excess inventory held on site or we will be subject to certain penalties. 
We have an unrecognized commitment to fund our respective share of the total construction costs of $29.0 billion. Refer to "Note 19: 
Commitments and Contingencies" within the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. 
As of December 31, 2022, substantially all of the assets of Arizona Fab consisted of property, plant and equipment. The assets held by 
Arizona Fab, which can be used only to settle obligations of the VIE and are not available to us, were $1.8 billion as of December 31, 
2022.
Non-controlling interest in Arizona Fab was $874 million as of December 31, 2022 and there was no net income (loss) attributable to 
Arizona Fab's non-controlling interest in 2022.
Mobileye
In the fourth quarter of 2022, Mobileye completed its IPO and certain other equity financing transactions that resulted in net proceeds of 
$1.0 billion. As of December 31, 2022, Intel held approximately 94% of the outstanding equity interest in Mobileye. Non-controlling interest 
in Mobileye was $989 million as of December 31, 2022. Net Income attributable to Mobileye's non-controlling interest was $3 million in 
2022.

We computed diluted earnings per share of common stock based on the weighted average number of shares of common stock 
outstanding plus potentially dilutive shares of common stock outstanding during the period. Potentially dilutive shares of common stock 
from employee incentive plans are determined by applying the treasury stock method to the assumed exercise of outstanding stock 
options, the assumed vesting of outstanding RSUs, and the assumed issuance of common stock under the 2006 ESPP.
During 2022, 70 million RSUs and stock options, as calculated on a weighted average basis for the year, were excluded from the 
computation of diluted earnings per share in the table above because they would have been anti-dilutive. These RSUs and options could 
potentially be included in the diluted earnings per share calculation in the future if the average market value of the common shares 
increases above the exercise price. For 2021 and 2020, all other periods presented, securities which would have been anti-dilutive were 
insignificant and have been excluded from the computation of diluted earnings per share.

Accounts Receivable
In 2022, we began selling certain of our accounts receivable on a non-recourse basis to third-party financial institutions. We record these 
transactions as sales of receivables and present cash proceeds as cash provided by operating activities in the Consolidated Statements 
of Cash Flows. Accounts receivable sold under non-recourse factoring arrangements were $665 million during 2022 and $0 during 2021. 
After the sale of our accounts receivable, we will collect payment from the customer and remit it to the third-party financial institution.

The 2022 Restructuring Program was approved to rebalance our workforce and operations to create efficiencies and improve our product 
execution in alignment with our strategy. Restructuring charges are primarily comprised of employee severance and benefit arrangements 
and are recorded as corporate charges in the "all other" category presented in "Note 3: Operating Segments" within the Notes to 
Consolidated Financial Statements. As of December 31, 2022, we have accrued $873 million as a current liability within Accrued 
compensation and benefits on our Consolidated Balance Sheets; $165 million in payments or other adjustments were made during the 
period. We expect these actions to be substantially completed by the end of 2023, but this is subject to change. Any changes to the 
estimates or timing of executing the 2022 Restructuring Program will be reflected in our future results of operations.
Litigation charges and other includes a $1.2 billion benefit in 2022 from the annulled penalty related to an EC fine that was recorded and 
paid in 2009, and a charge of $2.2 billion in 2021 related to the VLSI litigation. These were recorded as a corporate benefit and charge in 
the "all other" category presented in "Note 3: Operating Segments" within the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. Refer to "Note 
19: Commitments and Contingencies" within the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further information on legal proceedings

Asset impairment charges includes $238 million of goodwill and other impairments related to the shutdown in 2021 of two of our non-
strategic businesses, the results of which are included in the “all other” category presented in “Note 3: Operating Segments” within the

Our effective tax rate decreased in 2022 compared to 2021, primarily driven by a higher proportion of our income being taxed in non-US 
jurisdictions and a change in tax law from 2017 Tax Reform related to the capitalization of R&D expenses that went into effect in January 
2022.
Our effective tax rate decreased in 2021 compared to 2020, primarily driven by one-time tax benefits due to the restructuring of certain 
non-US subsidiaries as well as a higher proportion of our income in non-US jurisdictions. As a result of the restructuring, we established 
deferred tax assets and released the valuation allowances of certain foreign deferred tax assets. The majority of these deferred tax assets 
established in 2021 fully offset the deferred tax liabilities recognized in 2020 driven by a change in our permanent reinvestment assertion 
with respect to undistributed earnings in China, as a result of the divestiture of our NAND memory business.
We derive the effective tax rate benefit attributed to non-US income taxed at different rates primarily from our operations in Hong Kong, 
Ireland, Israel, and Malaysia. The statutory tax rates in these jurisdictions range from 12.5% to 24.0%. We are subject to reduced tax rates 
in Israel and Malaysia as long as we conduct certain eligible activities and make certain capital investments. We have conditional reduced 
tax rates that expire at various dates through 2056 and we expect to apply for renewals upon expiration. In 2022, the tax benefit 
specifically attributable to tax holidays was $220 million ($187 million for 2021 and $134 million for 2020) with a $0.05 impact on diluted 
earnings per share ($0.05 for 2021 and $0.03 for 2020).

Deferred tax assets are included within other long-term assets on the Consolidated Balance Sheets.
The valuation allowance as of December 31, 2022 included allowances primarily related to unrealized state credit carryforwards of $2.3 
billion.
As of December 31, 2022, our federal and non-US net operating loss carryforwards for income tax purposes were $379 million and $478 
million, respectively. The majority of the federal and non-US net operating loss carryforwards have no expiration date. The remaining 
federal and non-US net operating loss carryforwards expire at various dates through 2040. The federal and non-US net operating loss 
carryforwards include $141 million and $442 million, respectively, that is not likely to be recovered and has been reduced by a valuation 
allowance.
As of December 31, 2022, we have undistributed earnings of certain foreign subsidiaries of approximately $19.3 billion that we have 
indefinitely invested, and on which we have not recognized deferred taxes. Estimating the amount of potential tax is not practicable 
because of the complexity and variety of assumptions necessary to compute the tax.

Current income taxes receivable of $138 million as of December 31, 2022 ($23 million as of December 25, 2021) are included in other 
current assets.
Long-term income taxes payable of $3.8 billion as of December 31, 2022 ($4.3 billion as of December 25, 2021) is primarily comprised of 
the transition tax from Tax Reform, which is payable over eight years beginning in 2018, as well as amounts for uncertain tax positions, 
reduced by the associated deduction for state taxes and non-US tax credits.

If the remaining balance of unrecognized tax benefits were recognized in a future period, it would result in a tax benefit of $914 million as 
of December 31, 2022 ($721 million as of December 25, 2021) and a reduction in the effective tax rate. Interest, penalties, and accrued 
interest related to unrecognized tax benefits were insignificant in the periods presented.
We regularly engage in discussions and negotiations with tax authorities regarding tax matters in the various jurisdictions in which we 
conduct business. Although the timing of the resolutions and/or closures of audits is highly uncertain, it is reasonably possible that certain 
US federal and non-US tax audits may be concluded within the next 12 months, which could increase or decrease the balance of our 
gross unrecognized tax benefits. We estimate that the unrecognized tax benefits as of December 31, 2022 could decrease by as much as 
$366 million in the next 12 months. 
We file federal, state, and non-US tax returns. Excluding pre-acquisition Altera tax years, we are no longer subject to US federal and non-
US tax examinations for years prior to 2013 and 2012. For US state tax returns, we are no longer subject to tax examination for years 
prior to 2015.
Note 9 : 
Investments
Short-term Investments
Short-term investments include marketable debt investments in corporate debt, government debt, and financial institution instruments. 
Government debt includes instruments such as non-US government bonds and US agency securities. Financial institution instruments 
include instruments issued or managed by financial institutions in various forms, such as commercial paper, fixed- and floating-rate bonds, 
money market fund deposits, and time deposits. As of December 31, 2022 and December 25, 2021, substantially all time deposits were 
issued by institutions outside the US. 
For certain of our marketable debt investments, we economically hedge market risks at inception with a related derivative instrument or 
the marketable debt investment itself is used to economically hedge currency exchange rate risk from remeasurement. These hedged 
investments are reported at fair value with gains or losses from the investments and the related derivative instruments recorded in interest 
and other, net. The fair value of our hedged investments was $16.2 billion as of December 31, 2022 ($21.5 billion as of December 25, 
2021). For hedged investments still held at the reporting date, we recorded net losses of $748 million in 2022 (net losses of $606 million in 
2021 and net gains of $694 million in 2020). Net gains on the related derivatives were $752 million in 2022 (net gains of $609 million in 
2021 and net losses of $667 million in 2020).
Our remaining unhedged marketable debt investments are reported at fair value, with unrealized gains or losses, net of tax, recorded in 
accumulated other comprehensive income (loss). The adjusted cost of our unhedged investments was $10.2 billion as of December 31, 
2022 ($5.0 billion as of December 25, 2021), which approximated the fair value for these periods.
The fair value of marketable debt investments, by contractual maturity, as of December 31, 2022, was as follows:

we own more than 1% of the outstanding shares. Market-based restrictions result from the rules of the respective exchange.

McAfee Corp.
McAfee Corp. (McAfee) completed its IPO offering in October 2020. Due to our 41% ownership and significant influence as of 
December 25, 2021, we accounted for our investment in McAfee as an equity method investment. We had no accounting carrying value 
as of December 25, 2021.
During 2022, the sale of McAfee's consumer business was completed and we received $4.6 billion in cash for the sale of our remaining 
share of McAfee, recognizing a $4.6 billion gain in sale of equity investments and other. In 2021, we recognized McAfee dividends of $1.3 
billion, which included a special dividend of $1.1 billion paid in connection with the sale of McAfee's enterprise business, and recognized 
$228 million related to the partial sale of our investment in McAfee. We recognized McAfee dividends of $126 million in 2020.
Beijing Unisoc Technology Ltd.
We account for our interest in Beijing Unisoc Technology Ltd. (Unisoc) as a non-marketable equity security. During 2021, we recognized 
$471 million in observable price adjustments in our investment in Unisoc and as of December 31, 2022, the net book value of the 
investment was $1.1 billion ($1.1 billion as of December 25, 2021).
Note 10 : Acquisitions and Divestitures
Acquisitions
We completed eight acquisitions in 2022 and four acquisitions in 2021, all of which qualified as business combinations. The consideration 
for the acquisitions in 2022 and 2021 primarily consisted of cash and was substantially all allocated to goodwill and identified intangible 
assets. For information on the assignment of goodwill to our operating segments, see "Note 11: Goodwill," and for information on the 
classification of intangible assets, see "Note 12: Identified Intangible Assets" within the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.

Acquisition of Tower Semiconductor 
During the first quarter of 2022, we entered into a definitive agreement to acquire Tower Semiconductor Ltd. (Tower) in a cash-for-stock 
transaction. Tower is a leading foundry for analog semiconductor solutions. The acquisition is expected to advance our IDM 2.0 strategy 
by accelerating our global end-to-end systems foundry business. Upon completion of the acquisition, each issued and outstanding 
ordinary share of Tower will be converted into the right to receive $53 per share in cash, representing a total enterprise value of 
approximately $5.4 billion as of the agreement date. While we continue to work to close within the first quarter of 2023, the transaction 
may close in the first half of 2023, subject to certain regulatory approvals and customary closing conditions. If the agreement is terminated 
under certain circumstances involving the failure to obtain required regulatory approvals, we will be obligated to pay Tower a termination 
fee of $353 million. Tower will be included in our IFS operating segment.
Divestitures
NAND Memory Business
In October 2020, we signed an agreement with SK hynix Inc. (SK hynix) to divest our NAND memory business for $9.0 billion in cash. The 
NAND memory business includes our NAND memory fabrication facility in Dalian, China and certain related equipment and tangible 
assets (the Fab Assets), our NAND SSD business (the NAND SSD Business), and our NAND memory technology and manufacturing 
business (the NAND OpCo Business). The transaction will be completed in two closings. 
The first closing was completed on December 29, 2021. At first closing, SK hynix paid $7.0 billion of consideration, with the remaining 
$2.0 billion to be received at the second closing of the transaction, expected to be no earlier than March 2025. In connection with the first 
closing, we recognized a pre-tax gain of $1.0 billion within interest and other, net, and tax expense of $495 million. Based on our ongoing 
obligation under the NAND wafer manufacturing and sale agreement, $583 million of the first closing consideration was deferred and will 
be recognized between the first and second closing within interest and other, net.
At the first closing, we sold to SK hynix the Fab Assets and the NAND SSD Business and transferred certain employees, IP, and other 
assets related to the NAND OpCo Business to separately created wholly owned subsidiaries of Intel. The equity interest of the NAND 
OpCo Business will transfer to SK hynix at the second closing. In connection with the first closing, we and certain affiliates of SK hynix 
also entered into a NAND wafer manufacturing and sale agreement, pursuant to which we will manufacture and sell to SK hynix NAND 
memory wafers to be manufactured using the Fab Assets in Dalian, China until the second closing. We have concluded, based on the 
terms of the transaction agreements, that the subsidiaries are VIEs for which we are not the primary beneficiary, because the governance 
structure of these entities does not allow us to direct the activities that would most significantly impact their economic performance. In line 
with this conclusion, we fully deconsolidated our ongoing interests in the NAND OpCo Business, and recorded a receivable for the 
remaining proceeds of $1.9 billion in other long-term assets, which remains outstanding as of December 31, 2022. 
The carrying amounts of the major classes of NAND assets as of the first closing date included the following:

The wafer manufacturing and sale agreement includes incentives and penalties that are contingent on the cost of operation and output of 
the NAND OpCo Business. These incentives and penalties present a maximum exposure of up to $500 million annually, and $1.5 billion in 
the aggregate. We are currently in negotiations with SK hynix to update the operating plan of the NAND OpCo Business in light of the 
current business environment and projections, which may impact the metrics associated with the incentives and penalties and our 
expectations of the performance of the NAND OpCo Business against those metrics. 
Our transactions with the NAND OpCo Business between the first and second closings are considered related party transactions due to 
our equity interest and the wafer manufacturing and sales agreement. Related party transactions include certain assets that transferred at 
first closing between Intel and the NAND OpCo Business, or costs that we incurred on behalf of the NAND OpCo Business, for which we 
are entitled to be reimbursed, including approximately $35 million per quarter in 2022 for corporate function services, such as human 
resources, information technology, finance, supply chain, and other compliance requirements associated with being wholly owned 
subsidiaries. As of December 31, 2022, we have a receivable due to Intel of $133 million recorded within other current assets on our 
Consolidated Balance Sheets. 
Home Gateway Platform Division
On July 31, 2020, we completed the divestiture of the majority of Home Gateway Platform, a division of CCG, for proceeds of $150 
million. The divestiture included the transfer of certain employees, equipment, and an ongoing supply agreement for future units.

As described in "Note 3: Operating Segments" within the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, we modified our segment reporting 
in the first quarter of 2022 to align to our previously announced business reorganization, and have retrospectively adjusted all prior-period 
amounts in our goodwill footnote to reflect the changes in our operating segments. We reallocated goodwill among our affected reporting 
units based on the relative fair value of our new operating segments. We performed a quantitative impairment assessment for each of our 
reporting units immediately before and after our business reorganization, concluding that goodwill was not impaired. Goodwill reallocated

During the second quarter of 2021, we recognized a goodwill impairment loss of $238 million related to two non-strategic businesses that 
we exited, recorded within our all other category. During the fourth quarters of 2022 and 2021, we completed our annual impairment 
assessments and concluded that goodwill was not impaired. The accumulated impairment loss as of December 31, 2022 was $957 
million: $365 million associated with CCG, $275 million associated with DCAI, $79 million associated with NEX, and the remainder 
associated with non-reportable segments.

Senior Notes
In 2022, we issued a total of $6.0 billion aggregate principal amount of senior notes, including our inaugural green bond issuance of $1.3 
billion principal amount, and settled in cash $1.6 billion of our senior notes that matured in May 2022, $1.0 billion of our senior notes that 
matured in July 2022, and $1.9 billion of our senior notes that matured in December 2022. We also early cash settled $400 million of our 
senior notes due November 2023.
In 2021, we issued a total of $5.0 billion aggregate principal amount of senior notes and repaid $500 million of our 1.70% senior notes that 
matured in May 2021 and $2.0 billion of our 3.30% senior notes that matured in October 2021. 
Our fixed-rate senior notes pay interest semiannually. We may redeem the fixed-rate notes prior to their maturity at our option at specified 
redemption prices and subject to certain restrictions. The obligations under the notes rank equally in right of payment with all of our other 
existing and future senior unsecured indebtedness and will effectively rank junior to all liabilities of our subsidiaries.
Oregon and Arizona Bonds
In 2022, we received proceeds of $600 million in the aggregate for the sale of bonds issued by the Industrial Development Authority of the 
City of Chandler, Arizona (CIDA). The bonds are our unsecured general obligations in accordance with the loan with the CIDA. The bonds 
mature in 2042 and 2052 and carry an interest rate of 5.0%. The bonds are subject to mandatory tender in September 2027, at which time 
we can re-market the bonds as either fixed-rate bonds for a specified period or as variable-rate bonds until another fixed-rate period is 
selected or until their final maturity date. Our other Oregon and Arizona bonds listed in the table above are also subject to periodic 
mandatory tender. We settled in cash $138 million of bonds issued by the Oregon Business Development Commission in March 2022. 
Revolving Credit Facilities
In 2022, we entered into a $5.0 billion 364-day variable-rate unsecured revolving credit facility that, if drawn, is expected to be used for 
general corporate purposes. The revolving credit facility matures in November 2023. We also amended our $5.0 billion variable-rate 
revolving credit facility agreement that we entered into in 2021, extending the maturity date by one year to March 2027 and transitioning 
from LIBOR to term SOFR. The revolving credit facilities had no borrowings outstanding as of December 31, 2022.

2. Level 1 investments consist primarily of US Treasury securities. Level 2 investments consist primarily of non-US government debt.
3. The fair value of our loans receivable for which we elected the fair value option did not significantly differ from the contractual principal balance.
4. Level 2 investments consist of marketable equity securities subject to security-specific restrictions for which a fair value adjustment was recorded.
Assets Measured and Recorded at Fair Value on a Non-Recurring Basis
Our non-marketable equity securities, equity method investments, and certain non-financial assets, such as intangible assets and 
property, plant and equipment, are recorded at fair value only if an impairment or observable price adjustment is recognized in the current 
period. If an impairment or observable price adjustment is recognized on our non-marketable equity securities during the period, we 
classify these assets as Level 3. 
We classify non-marketable equity securities and non-marketable equity method investments as Level 3. Impairments recognized on 
these investments held as of December 31, 2022 were $179 million ($138 million on investments held as of December 25, 2021).

Financial Instruments Not Recorded at Fair Value on a Recurring Basis
Financial instruments not recorded at fair value on a recurring basis include non-marketable equity securities and equity method 
investments that have not been remeasured or impaired in the current period, grants receivable, and issued debt. 
We classify the fair value of grants receivable and reverse repurchase agreements with original maturities greater than three months as 
Level 2. The estimated fair value of these financial instruments approximates their carrying value. The aggregate carrying value of grants 
receivable as of December 31, 2022 was $437 million (the aggregate carrying value of grants receivable as of December 25, 2021 was 
$317 million). The aggregate carrying value of reverse repurchase agreements with original maturities greater than three months as of 
December 31, 2022 was $400 million (the aggregate carrying value as of December 25, 2021 was $0 million).
We classify the fair value of issued debt (excluding commercial paper) as Level 2. The fair value of these instruments was $34.3 billion as 
of December 31, 2022 ($41.5 billion as of December 25, 2021).

Derivatives in Cash Flow Hedging Relationships
The before-tax net gains or losses attributed to the effective portion of cash flow hedges recognized in other comprehensive income (loss) 
were $910 million net losses in 2022 ($434 million net losses in 2021 and $806 million net gains in 2020). Substantially all of our cash flow 
hedges are foreign currency contracts for all periods presented.
Amounts excluded from effectiveness testing were insignificant during all periods presented.

Note 17 : Retirement Benefit Plans
Defined Contribution Plans
We provide tax-qualified defined contribution plans for the benefit of eligible employees, former employees, and retirees in the US and 
certain other countries. The plans are designed to provide employees with an accumulation of funds for retirement on a tax-deferred 
basis. For the benefit of eligible US employees, we also provide an unfunded non-tax-qualified supplemental deferred compensation plan 
for certain highly compensated employees. 
We expensed $489 million in 2022, $444 million in 2021 and $398 million in 2020 for matching contributions based on the amount of 
employee contributions under the US qualified defined contribution and non-qualified deferred compensation plans.
US Retiree Medical Plan
Upon retirement, we provide certain benefits to eligible US employees who were hired prior to 2014 under the US Retiree Medical Plan. 
The benefits can be used to pay all or a portion of the cost to purchase eligible coverage in a medical plan.
As of December 31, 2022 and December 25, 2021, the projected benefit obligation was $527 million and $682 million, which used the 
discount rates of 5.6% and 2.8%. The December 31, 2022 and December 25, 2021 corresponding fair value of plan assets was $501 
million and $669 million.
The investment strategy for US Retiree Medical Plan assets is to invest primarily in liquid assets, due to the level of expected future 
benefit payments. The assets are invested in tax-aware global equity and fixed-income long credit portfolios. Both portfolios are actively 
managed by external managers. The tax-aware global equity portfolio is composed of a diversified mix of equities in developed countries. 
The tax-aware fixed-income long credit portfolio is composed of domestic securities. The allocation to each asset class will fluctuate with 
market conditions, such as volatility and liquidity concerns, and will typically be rebalanced when outside the target ranges, which are 55% 
equity and 45% fixed-income investments. As of December 31, 2022, the majority of the US Retiree Medical Plan assets were invested in 
exchange-traded equity securities and were measured at fair value using Level 1 inputs. The remaining US Retiree Medical Plan assets 
were invested in fixed-income investments and were measured at fair value using Level 2 inputs.
As of December 31, 2022, the estimated benefit payments for this plan over the next 10 years are as follows:

Pension Benefit Plans
We provide defined-benefit pension plans in certain countries, most significantly the US, Ireland, Israel, and Germany. The majority of the 
plans' benefits have been frozen. 
Benefit Obligation and Plan Assets for Pension Benefit Plans
The vested benefit obligation for a defined-benefit pension plan is the actuarial present value of the vested benefits to which the employee 
is currently entitled based on the employee's expected date of separation or retirement.

2022 and approximately 30% in the US and 70% outside of the US as of December 25, 2021. 
Changes in actuarial gains and losses in the projected benefit obligation are generally driven by discount rate movement. We use the 
corridor approach to amortize actuarial gains and losses. Under this approach, net actuarial gains or losses in excess of 10% of the larger 
of the projected benefit obligation or the fair value of plan assets are amortized on a straight-line basis.
As of December 31, 2022, the accumulated benefit obligations were $0.9 billion and $1.6 billion for the US plan and non-US plans, 
respectively. In 2022, the US and Ireland plans were in the net asset position and the other non-US plans had projected benefit 
obligations in excess of plan assets. In 2022, the US, Ireland and Israel plans had assets in excess of accumulated benefit obligations, 
whereas the remaining non-US plans had accumulated benefit obligations in excess of plan assets. As of December 25, 2021, the 
accumulated benefit obligations were $1.4 billion and $2.6 billion for the US plan and non-US plans, respectively, and all plans had 
accumulated benefit obligations and projected benefit obligations in excess of plan assets.

We establish the discount rate for each pension plan by analyzing current market long-term bond rates and matching the bond maturity 
with the average duration of the pension liabilities. 
We establish the long-term expected rate of return by developing a forward-looking, long-term return assumption for each pension fund 
asset class, taking into account factors such as the expected real return for the specific asset class and inflation. A single, long-term rate 
of return is then calculated as the weighted average of the target asset allocation percentages and the long-term return assumption for 
each asset class.
Funding
Our practice is to fund the various pension plans in amounts sufficient to meet the minimum requirements of applicable local laws and 
regulations. Funding for the US Retiree Medical Plan is discretionary under applicable laws and regulations. Additional funding may be 
provided for the pension and retiree medical plans as deemed appropriate.
On a worldwide basis, our pension and retiree medical plans were 81% funded as of December 31, 2022. The US Pension Plan, which 
accounts for 28% of the worldwide pension and retiree medical benefit obligations, was 102% funded. Funded status is not indicative of 
our ability to pay ongoing pension benefits or of our obligation to fund retirement trusts. Required pension funding for US retirement plans 
is determined in accordance with ERISA, which sets required minimum contributions. Cumulative company funding to the US Pension 
Plan currently exceeds the minimum ERISA funding requirements.
Net Periodic Benefit Cost
The net periodic benefit cost for pension and US retiree medical benefits was $139 million in 2022 ($162 million in 2021 and $164 million 
in 2020).

US Plan Assets
The investment strategy for US Pension Plan assets is to manage the funded status volatility, taking into consideration the investment 
horizon and expected volatility to help enable sufficient assets to be available to pay pension benefits as they come due. The allocation to 
each asset class will fluctuate with market conditions, such as volatility and liquidity concerns, and will typically be rebalanced when 
outside the target ranges, which are 90% fixed income and 10% equity investments. During 2022, the US Pension Plan assets were 
invested in collective investment trust funds, which are measured at net asset value.

Non-US Plan Assets
The investments of the non-US plans are managed by insurance companies, pension funds, or third-party trustees, consistent with 
regulations or market practice of the country where the assets are invested. The investment manager makes investment decisions within 
the guidelines set by Intel or local regulations. Investments managed by qualified insurance companies or pension funds under standard 
contracts follow local regulations, and we are not actively involved in their investment strategies. For the assets that we have the 
discretion to set investment guidelines, the assets are invested in developed country equity investments and fixed-income investments, 
either through index funds or direct investment. In general, the investment strategy is designed to accumulate a diversified portfolio 
among markets, asset classes, or individual securities to reduce market risk and to help enable sufficient pension assets to be available to 
pay benefits as they come due. The equity investments in the non-US plan assets are invested in a diversified mix of equities of 
developed countries, including the US, and emerging markets throughout the world. We have control over the investment strategy related 
to the majority of the assets measured at net asset value, which are invested in hedge funds, bond index funds and equity index funds. 
The target allocation of the non-US plan assets that we have control over was approximately 45% fixed income, 35% equity, and 20% 
hedge fund investments in 2022.

Note 18 : Employee Equity Incentive Plans
Our equity incentive plans are broad-based, long-term programs intended to attract and retain talented employees and align stockholder 
and employee interests. Our plans include our 2006 Plan and our 2006 ESPP.
Under the 2006 Plan, 946 million shares of common stock have been authorized for issuance as equity awards to employees and non-
employee directors through June 2023. As of December 31, 2022, 119 million shares of common stock remained available for future 
grants.
Under the 2006 Plan, we may grant RSUs and stock options. We grant RSUs with a service condition as well as RSUs with a market 
condition, performance condition, and a service condition, which we call PSUs. PSUs are granted to a group of senior officers and 
employees. For PSUs granted in 2022, the number of shares of our common stock to be received at vesting at the end of the three-year 
performance period will range from 0% to 200% of the target grant amount and will be determined based on our performance relative to 
annual targets for each year in the performance period with respect to a revenue growth metric, weighted 60%, and a cash flow from 
operations metric, weighted 40%. The results are then averaged at the end of the performance period. Additionally, an adjustment to the 
performance goals aggregate achievement percentage is based on the TSR of our common stock measured against the benchmark TSR 
of the S&P 500 Index over a three-year period and revenue CAGR for the three-year performance period. TSR is a measure of stock price 
appreciation plus any dividends paid in this performance period. As of December 31, 2022, 15 million PSUs were outstanding. PSUs vest 
three years from the grant date. Other RSU awards and option awards generally vest over four years from the grant date.  
Share-Based Compensation
Share-based compensation recognized in 2022 was $3.1 billion ($2.0 billion in 2021 and $1.9 billion in 2020). During 2022, the tax benefit 
that we realized for the tax deduction from share-based awards totaled $478 million ($377 million in 2021 and $380 million in 2020).
We estimate the fair value of RSUs and PSUs with a service condition or performance condition using the value of our common stock on 
the date of grant, reduced by the present value of dividends expected to be paid on our shares of common stock prior to vesting. We 
estimate the fair value of PSUs with a market condition using a Monte Carlo simulation model as of the date of grant using historical 
volatility.

The aggregate fair value of awards that vested in 2022 was $2.0 billion ($1.7 billion in 2021 and $1.9 billion in 2020), which represents the 
market value of our common stock on the date that the RSUs vested. The grant-date fair value of awards that vested in 2022 was $2.5 
billion ($1.4 billion in 2021 and $1.3 billion in 2020). The number of RSUs vested includes shares of common stock that we withheld on 
behalf of employees to satisfy the minimum statutory tax withholding requirements. RSUs that are expected to vest are net of estimated 
future forfeitures.
As of December 31, 2022, unrecognized compensation costs related to RSUs granted under our equity incentive plans were $4.6 billion. 
We expect to recognize those costs over a weighted average period of 1.4 years.
Stock Purchase Plan
The 2006 ESPP allows eligible employees to purchase shares of our common stock at 85% of the value of our common stock on specific 
dates. Under the 2006 ESPP, 523 million shares of common stock are authorized for issuance through August 2026. As of December 31, 
2022, 200 million shares of common stock remained available for issuance.
Employees purchased 27 million shares of common stock in 2022 for $931 million under the 2006 ESPP (22 million shares of common 
stock for $925 million in 2021 and 21 million shares of common stock for $876 million in 2020). As of December 31, 2022, unrecognized 
share-based compensation costs related to rights to acquire shares of common stock under the 2006 ESPP totaled $73 million. We 
expect to recognize those costs over a period of approximately two months.

Note 19 : Commitments and Contingencies
Leases
We recognized operating leased assets in other long-term assets of $487 million and corresponding accrued liabilities of $173 million, and 
other long-term liabilities of $236 million as of December 31, 2022. Our operating leases have remaining terms of 1 to 13 years and may 
include options to extend the leases for up to 36 years. The weighted average remaining lease term was 3.7 years, and the weighted 
average discount rate was 4.3% as of December 31, 2022, for our operating leases. 
Operating lease expense was $729 million in 2022 ($798 million in 2021 and $416 million in 2020), including $551 million in variable lease 
expense in 2022 ($620 million in 2021 and $237 million in 2020).
In 2021 and 2022, we signed finance leases for supplier capacity extending over approximately 8 years. The leases will commence upon 
start of supplier production expected in 2023 and 2024. Prepayments of $430 million were recognized in property, plant and equipment as 
of December 31, 2022.

Commitments for capital expenditures totaled $31.0 billion as of December 31, 2022, ($27.0 billion as of December 25, 2021) a majority of 
which will be due within the next 12 months. Other purchase obligations and commitments totaled approximately $10.7 billion as of 
December 31, 2022 (approximately $12.4 billion as of December 25, 2021). 
Other purchase obligations and commitments include payments due under supply agreements and various types of licenses and 
agreements to purchase goods or services. Contractual obligations for purchases of goods or services relate to agreements that are 
enforceable and legally binding and that specify all significant terms, including fixed or minimum quantities; fixed, minimum, or variable 
price provisions; and the approximate timing of the transaction. Other purchase obligations reflect the non-cancelable portion or the 
minimum cancellation fee under the agreement. 
Other commitments include a $5.4 billion commitment associated with our pending acquisition of Tower and our unrecognized 
commitment to fund our respective share of the total construction costs of $29.0 billion of Arizona Fab in connection with the definitive 
agreement entered into with Brookfield. Our remaining unfunded contribution was $13.5 billion as of December 31, 2022. 
Legal Proceedings
We are regularly party to various ongoing claims, litigation, and other proceedings, including those noted in this section. We have accrued 
a charge of $2.2 billion related to litigation involving VLSI, described below. Excluding the VLSI claims described below, management at 
present believes that the ultimate outcome of these proceedings, individually and in the aggregate, will not materially harm our financial 
position, results of operations, cash flows, or overall trends; however, legal proceedings and related government investigations are subject 
to inherent uncertainties, and unfavorable rulings, excessive verdicts, or other events could occur. Unfavorable resolutions could include 
substantial monetary damages, fines, or penalties. Certain of these outstanding matters include speculative, substantial, or indeterminate 
monetary awards. In addition, in matters for which injunctive relief or other conduct remedies are sought, unfavorable resolutions could 
include an injunction or other order prohibiting us from selling one or more products at all or in particular ways, precluding particular 
business practices, or requiring other remedies. An unfavorable outcome may result in a material adverse impact on our business, results 
of operations, financial position, and overall trends. We might also conclude that settling one or more such matters is in the best interests 
of our stockholders, employees, and customers, and any such settlement could include substantial payments. Except as specifically 
described below, we have not concluded that settlement of any of the legal proceedings noted in this section is appropriate at this time. 
European Commission Competition Matter
In 2009, the European Commission (EC) found that Intel had used unfair business practices to persuade customers to buy 
microprocessors in violation of Article 82 of the EC Treaty (later renumbered Article 102) and Article 54 of the European Economic Area 
Agreement. In general, the EC found that we violated Article 82 by offering alleged “conditional rebates and payments” that required 
customers to purchase all or most of their x86 microprocessors from us and by making alleged “payments to prevent sales of specific rival 
products.” The EC ordered us to end the alleged infringement referred to in its decision and imposed a €1.1 billion fine, which we paid in 
the third quarter of 2009. 
Financial Statements
Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements

We appealed the EC decision to the European Court of Justice in 2014, after the General Court (then called the Court of First Instance) 
rejected our appeal of the EC decision in its entirety. In September 2017, the Court of Justice sent the case back to the General Court to 
examine whether the rebates at issue were capable of restricting competition. 
In January 2022, the General Court annulled the EC’s 2009 findings against us regarding rebates, as well as the fine imposed on Intel, 
which was returned to us in February 2022. In April 2022, the EC appealed the General Court’s decision to the Court of Justice. A hearing 
date on the appeal has not been scheduled. The General Court’s January 2022 decision did not annul the EC’s 2009 finding that Intel 
made payments to prevent sales of specific rival products, and in January 2023 the EC reopened its administrative procedure to 
determine a fine against Intel based on that alleged conduct. Given the procedural posture and the nature of this proceeding, we are 
unable to make a reasonable estimate of the potential loss or range of losses, if any, that might arise from this matter. 
In a related matter, we filed applications with the General Court in April 2022 seeking an order requiring the EC to pay Intel approximately 
€593 million in default interest.
Litigation Related to Security Vulnerabilities
In June 2017, a Google research team notified Intel and other companies that it had identified security vulnerabilities, now commonly 
referred to as “Spectre” and “Meltdown,” that affect many types of microprocessors, including our products. As is standard when findings 
like these are presented, we worked together with other companies in the industry to verify the research and develop and validate 
software and firmware updates for impacted technologies. In January 2018, information on the security vulnerabilities was publicly 
reported, before software and firmware updates to address the vulnerabilities were made widely available.
Numerous lawsuits have been filed against Intel relating to Spectre, Meltdown, and other variants of the security vulnerabilities that have 
been identified since 2018. As of January 25, 2023, consumer class action lawsuits against Intel were pending in the United States, 
Canada, and Argentina. The plaintiffs, who purport to represent various classes of purchasers of our products, generally claim to have 
been harmed by Intel's actions and/or omissions in connection with the security vulnerabilities and assert a variety of common law and 
statutory claims seeking monetary damages and equitable relief. In the United States, class action suits filed in various jurisdictions were 
consolidated for all pretrial proceedings in the United States District Court for the District of Oregon, which entered final judgment in favor 
of Intel in July 2022 based on plaintiffs’ failure to plead a viable claim. Plaintiffs have appealed that decision to the Ninth Circuit Court of 
Appeals. In Canada, an initial status conference has not yet been scheduled in one case pending in the Superior Court of Justice of 
Ontario, and a stay of a second case pending in the Superior Court of Justice of Quebec is in effect. In Argentina, Intel Argentina was 
served with, and responded to, a class action complaint in June 2022. Additional lawsuits and claims may be asserted seeking monetary 
damages or other related relief. We dispute the pending claims described above and intend to defend those lawsuits vigorously. Given the 
procedural posture and the nature of those cases, including that the pending proceedings are in the early stages, that alleged damages 
have not been specified, that uncertainty exists as to the likelihood of a class or classes being certified or the ultimate size of any class or 
classes if certified, and that there are significant factual and legal issues to be resolved, we are unable to make a reasonable estimate of 
the potential loss or range of losses, if any, that might arise from those matters. 
Litigation Related to 7nm Product Delay Announcement
Starting in July 2020, five securities class action lawsuits were filed in the U. S. District Court for the Northern District of California against 
Intel and certain current and former officers based on Intel’s July 2020 announcement of 7nm product delays. The plaintiffs, who purport 
to represent classes of acquirers of Intel stock between October 2019 and July 2020, generally allege that the defendants violated 
securities laws by making false or misleading statements about the timeline for 7nm products in light of subsequently announced delays. 
In October 2020, the court consolidated the lawsuits, appointed lead plaintiffs, and in January 2021 the lead plaintiffs filed a consolidated 
complaint. Defendants moved to dismiss the consolidated complaint in March 2021. We dispute the claims described above and intend to 
defend the lawsuits vigorously. Given the procedural posture and the nature of those cases, including that the pending proceedings are in 
the early stages, that alleged damages have not been specified, that uncertainty exists as to the likelihood of a class or classes being 
certified or the ultimate size of any class or classes if certified, and that there are significant factual and legal issues to be resolved, we are 
unable to make a reasonable estimate of the potential loss or range of losses, if any, that might arise from those matters. In July 2021, 
Intel introduced a new process node naming structure, and the 7nm process is now Intel 4.
Litigation Related to Patent and IP Claims
We have had IP infringement lawsuits filed against us, including but not limited to those discussed below. Most involve claims that certain 
of our products, services, and technologies infringe others' IP rights. Adverse results in these lawsuits may include awards of substantial 
fines and penalties, costly royalty or licensing agreements, or orders preventing us from offering certain features, functionalities, products, 
or services. As a result, we may have to change our business practices, and develop non-infringing products or technologies, which could 
result in a loss of revenue for us and otherwise harm our business. In addition, certain agreements with our customers require us to 
indemnify them against certain IP infringement claims, which can increase our costs as a result of defending such claims, and may require 
that we pay significant damages, accept product returns, or supply our customers with non-infringing products if there were an adverse 
ruling in any such claims. In addition, our customers and partners may discontinue the use of our products, services, and technologies, as 
a result of injunctions or otherwise, which could result in loss of revenue and adversely affect our business.
VLSI Technology LLC v. Intel 
In October 2017, VLSI Technology LLC (VLSI) filed a complaint against Intel in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California 
alleging that various Intel FPGA and processor products infringe eight patents that VLSI acquired from NXP Semiconductors, N.V. (NXP). 
VLSI estimates its damages to be at least $5.5 billion, and seeks enhanced damages, future royalties, attorneys’ fees, costs, and interest.

Intel filed Inter Partes Review (IPR) petitions with the Patent Trial and Appeal Board (PTAB) in 2018 challenging patentability, and the 
parties stipulated to stay the district court action pending the PTAB's review. The PTAB subsequently found all claims of two patents, and 
some claims of two other patents, to be unpatentable. The district court lifted the stay in September 2021 and scheduled trial for March 
2024 on the claims that were found patentable by the PTAB.
In June 2018, VLSI filed a second suit against Intel, in U.S. District Court for the District of Delaware, seeking $4.4 billion in damages for 
the alleged infringement by various Intel processors of five additional patents that VLSI acquired from NXP. In December 2022, VLSI 
stipulated to dismiss with prejudice its claims, for which Intel paid nothing. The court dismissed the case in January 2023.
In April 2019, VLSI filed three infringement suits against Intel in the Western District of Texas (WDTX) accusing various Intel processors of 
infringement of eight additional patents it had acquired from NXP. The first Texas case went to trial in February 2021, and the jury awarded 
VLSI $1.5 billion for literal infringement of one patent and $675 million for infringement of another patent under the doctrine of equivalents. 
In April 2022, the court entered final judgment, awarding VLSI $2.2 billion in damages and approximately $162.3 million in pre-judgment 
and post-judgment interest. Intel has appealed the judgment to the Federal Circuit Court of Appeals, including its claim to have a license 
from Fortress Investment Group’s acquisition of Finjan. In December 2021 and January 2022 the PTAB instituted IPRs on the claims 
found to have been infringed in the first Texas case, but it has not yet issued a final written decision on either petition.
The second Texas case went to trial in April 2021, and the jury found that Intel does not infringe the asserted patents. VLSI had sought 
approximately $3.0 billion for alleged infringement, plus enhanced damages for willful infringement. The court has not yet entered final 
judgment following the second trial in Texas. The third Texas case went to trial in November 2022, with VLSI asserting one remaining 
patent. The jury found the patent valid and infringed, and awarded VLSI nearly $949 million in damages, plus a running royalty. The court 
has not yet entered final judgment following the third trial in Texas. We intend to file motions for a judgment notwithstanding the verdict, 
and further appeals are possible.
In May 2019, VLSI filed a case in Shenzhen Intermediate People’s Court against Intel, Intel (China) Co., Ltd., Intel Trading (Shanghai) 
Co., Ltd., and Intel Products (Chengdu) Co., Ltd. VLSI asserts one patent against certain Intel Core processors. Defendants filed an 
invalidation petition in October 2019 with the China National Intellectual Property Administration (CNIPA) which held a hearing in 
September 2021. CNIPA has not yet issued a decision. The Shenzhen court held trial proceedings in July 2021 and indicated that further 
trial proceedings were needed but would be stayed pending the outcome of defendants’ invalidity challenge at the CNIPA. VLSI seeks an 
injunction as well as RMB 1.3 million in costs and expenses, but no damages. 
In May 2019, VLSI filed a case in Shanghai Intellectual Property Court against Intel (China) Co., Ltd., Intel Trading (Shanghai) Co., Ltd., 
and Intel Products (Chengdu) Co., Ltd. asserting one patent against certain Intel core processors. The court held a trial hearing in 
December 2020, where VLSI requested expenses (RMB 300 thousand) and an injunction. The court held a second trial hearing in May 
2022, but has yet to issue its final decision. In December 2022, Intel filed a second petition to invalidate the patent at issue.
In November 2019, Intel, along with Apple Inc., filed a complaint against Fortress Investment Group LLC, Fortress Credit Co. LLC, Uniloc 
2017 LLC, Uniloc USA, Inc., Uniloc Luxembourg S.A.R.L., VLSI, INVT SPE LLC, Inventergy Global, Inc., DSS Technology Management, 
Inc., IXI IP, LLC, and Seven Networks, LLC. Plaintiffs allege violations of Section 1 of the Sherman Act by certain defendants, Section 7 of 
the Clayton Act by certain defendants, and California Business and Professions Code section 17200 by all defendants based on 
defendants’ unlawful aggregation of patents. In September 2021, the district court dismissed the claims with prejudice, entering judgment 
in favor of defendants. In November 2022 the Ninth Circuit affirmed the district court’s decision.
Intel has accrued a charge of approximately $2.2 billion related to the VLSI litigation. While we dispute VLSI’s claims and intend to 
vigorously defend against them, we are unable to make a reasonable estimate of losses in excess of recorded amounts given recent 
developments and future proceedings.
Business Interruption Insurance Proceeds
We received $484 million of insurance proceeds, primarily in the fourth quarter of 2022, to compensate for business interruption and 
property damage from a temporary electrical breakdown that occurred at one of our facilities in 2020. We recognized these receipts as a 
reduction of Cost of sales.

L1
Level 1 of autonomous driving; most functions are controlled by a human driver; certain functions (parking assist, 
acceleration, and limited steering) can be done automatically by the vehicle
L2
Level 2 of autonomous driving; the system controls both steering and acceleration using information about the 
driving environment, but with the expectation that a human will perform all remaining aspects of driving; the driver 
can have his or her hands off the steering wheel, but must monitor the "dynamic driving task" at all times
L4
Level 4 of autonomous driving; the system performs all aspects of the driving task even if the driver does not 
respond appropriately to a request for intervention, including all safety-critical driving functions and monitoring 
roadway conditions for an entire trip. For a defined use case, no driver intervention is required at all.

Controls and Procedures
Inherent Limitations on Effectiveness of Controls
Our management, including the principal executive officer and principal financial officer, does not expect that our disclosure controls and 
procedures or our internal control over financial reporting will prevent or detect all errors and all fraud. A control system, no matter how 
well-designed and operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that the control system's objectives will be met. The 
design of a control system must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints, and the benefits of controls must be considered 
relative to their costs. Further, because of the inherent limitations in all control systems, no evaluation of controls can provide absolute 
assurance that misstatements due to error or fraud will not occur or that all control issues and instances of fraud, if any, have been 
detected.
Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures
Based on management's evaluation (with the participation of our principal executive officer and principal financial officer), as of the end of 
the period covered by this report, our principal executive officer and principal financial officer have concluded that our disclosure controls 
and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act), are effective to provide reasonable assurance 
that information required to be disclosed by us in reports that we file or submit under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, 
summarized, and reported within the time periods specified in SEC rules and forms, and is accumulated and communicated to 
management, including our principal executive officer and principal financial officer, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding 
required disclosure.
Changes in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting
There were no changes to our internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) under the Exchange 
Act) that occurred during the quarter ended December 31, 2022 that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, 
our internal control over financial reporting.
Management Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting 
Our management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rules 
13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) under the Exchange Act) to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of our financial reporting and 
the preparation of Consolidated Financial Statements for external purposes in accordance with US GAAP.
Management assessed our internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2022. Management based its assessment on 
criteria established in Internal Control—Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway 
Commission (2013 framework). Management's assessment included evaluation of elements such as the design and operating 
effectiveness of key financial reporting controls, process documentation, accounting policies, and our overall control environment.
Based on this assessment, management has concluded that our internal control over financial reporting was effective as of the end of the 
fiscal year to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of Consolidated Financial 
Statements for external reporting purposes in accordance with US GAAP. We reviewed the results of management's assessment with the 
Audit Committee of our Board of Directors.
Our independent registered public accounting firm, Ernst & Young LLP, independently assessed the effectiveness of the company's 
internal control over financial reporting, as stated in the firm's attestation report, which is included within Financial Statements and 
Supplemental Details.

Letter from your ceo
To our stockholders, customers, partners, and employees:
Advancing Our Vision and Strategy
Intel stands at a pivotal juncture in a world where insatiable 
demand for processing power is being driven by AI and the 
convergence 
of 
ubiquitous 
compute, 
connectivity, 
infrastructure, and sensing. We see a profound opportunity 
to push the boundaries of what is possible, to create 
solutions for the world’s most significant challenges, and to 
improve the lives of everyone on the planet.
Intel’s mission to create a globally-diversified, resilient, and 
sustainable supply chain for semiconductors – the most 
critical and strategic resource of the 21st century – is 
central 
to 
our 
ambitions. 
Access 
to 
exceptionally 
engineered and relentlessly innovative chips will be the 
determining factor in the next phase of innovation for 
virtually every industry. 
To usher in this new era and enable our customers to 
harness this opportunity, Intel is investing in technology and 
manufacturing leadership as we open our manufacturing 
network to the world, bring “AI Everywhere,” and 
relentlessly pursue Moore’s Law. This is part of our effort to 
build a stronger Intel and includes the February launch of 
Intel Foundry, a first-of-its-kind systems foundry for the AI 
era that comprises our Technology Development, Global 
Manufacturing and Supply Chain, and foundry customer 
service 
and 
ecosystem 
operations. 
Moreover, 
the 
establishment of a foundry-like relationship between Intel 
Foundry and Intel Products, our product business units, will 
drive 
greater 
transparency, 
accountability, 
and 
cost 
optimization.
Making Significant Progress on Our Transformation
2023 marked a year of across-the-board progress on our 
IDM 2.0 strategy and transformation priorities. We executed 
on our plan to re-establish process leadership, expanded 
our capacity and foundry plans, enhanced product 
Intel 
execution, and began to realize our vision to bring AI 
18A 
Everywhere. 
Despite 
entering 
the 
year 
navigating 
significant macroeconomic and industry headwinds, the 
2024 
focus on our strategy and on operational and financial 
discipline enabled us to deliver on our goals. We know 
there is more work to do, but I’m proud of the team for 
delivering on what we said we would in 2023, which will 
enable us to take advantage of the opportunities ahead. 
Re-establishing Process and Product Leadership
We remain on track to re-establish Intel’s process 
technology leadership by delivering on our goal of five 
nodes in four years (5N4Y), which will be completed by the 
end of 2024. Intel 3 and Intel 4 are manufacturing-ready 
and ramping. We are excited to break into the Angstrom era 
with Intel 20A, set to launch this year, and Intel 18A, on 
track for manufacturing readiness in the second half of  
Pat Gelsinger, Chief Executive Officer, Director, and Principal 
Executive Officer
2024, marking the completion of 5N4Y and returning Intel to 
process leadership. In February, we unveiled our roadmap 
beyond 5N4Y with the addition of Intel 14A to Intel’s 
leading-edge node plan, in addition to several specialized 
node evolutions. 
Our product roadmap also continues to advance. In the 
datacenter, we launched Xeon Gen 5 ahead of schedule. 
Sierra Forest is poised for launch in the first half of 2024, 
followed shortly by Granite Rapids, which will position Intel 
to regain share in the data center. Additionally, Clearwater 
Forest, our first Intel 18A part for servers, is already in the 
fab.
Our Meteor Lake product on Intel 4 is ramping rapidly with 
40 million units expected in 2024 and Arrow Lake, our lead 
20A vehicle, is slated for launch this year. Our first Intel 
client
 platform,
 Panther
 Lake,
 is
 now
 in
 fab
 as
 well. 
Together, we expect to ship well over 100
 million AI PCs in
 
and 2025.
Building the First Systems Foundry for the AI Era
We are advancing our goal of becoming the world’s second-
largest foundry by 2030 as part of our broader mission to 
create a resilient and sustainable global supply chain for 
semiconductors. At our inaugural Intel Foundry Direct 
Connect event, in February, we unveiled the new brand and 
market positioning of Intel Foundry, the world’s first systems 
foundry for the AI era.  
While still early in our foundry journey, we are seeing 
significant traction. We began 2023 with a commitment from 
one Intel 18A foundry customer and ended the year with 
four. We also achieved five advanced packaging wins, a 
testament to the advantages of Intel Foundry. 


To support the growing demand for our foundry offering, we 
continued to expand our manufacturing capacity and 
capabilities. 
Our 
foundry 
collaborations 
have 
been 
bolstered by new strategic agreements with UMC to deliver 
a joint 12 nanometer process platform and with Tower 
Semiconductor to expand its wafer capacity corridor. 
Particularly noteworthy from Direct Connect was the deep 
support from ecosystem partners – including Synopsys, 
Cadence, Siemens and Ansys – that are ready to 
accelerate Intel Foundry customers’ chip designs with tools, 
design flows and intellectual property portfolios validated for 
Intel’s advanced packaging and Intel 18A process 
technologies.
Accelerating Efforts to Bring AI Everywhere
Intel is uniquely positioned across its product and foundry 
businesses to participate in 100% of the massive market for 
AI silicon, which is a key driver of the $1 trillion 
semiconductor opportunity expected by the end of this 
decade. Our efforts are to bring AI where data is generated 
and used and to extend across cloud, data centers, PCs, 
networks, and the edge. In 2023 we ushered in the age of 
the AI PC with Intel® Core™ Ultra, the most significant 
transformation of the PC experience since the introduction 
of the wireless Intel Centrino platform more than 20 years 
earlier.
We launched 4th Gen Intel® Xeon® processors with 
industry-leading AI inference performance, shipping 2.5 
million units during the year, and 5th Gen Intel® Xeon® 
processors, which radically improved inference further. Our 
Intel® 
Gaudi®2 
accelerators 
are 
exhibiting 
robust 
performance compared with peers, and Intel® Gaudi®3 is 
in the lab and powered on.
2023 was the year of AI training, but 2024 is poised to be 
the year of AI inferencing – where Intel is positioned to win.
Demonstrating Strong Financial Improvement and 
Unlocking Shareholder Value 
Intel displayed strong financial discipline and improvement 
in 2023, consistently exceeding expectations on the top and 
bottom line for each of the four quarters. Through rigorous 
expense discipline, we achieved $3 billion in cost savings 
during the year. Additionally, at the beginning of 2024, we 
successfully transitioned to our internal foundry model. This 
model gives Intel Foundry its own profit-and-loss statement 
for the first time and establishes a foundry-like relationship 
between Intel Foundry and Intel Products.
In 2023, we also unlocked significant value through 
strategic portfolio actions, including the stake sale of IMS. 
Along with the exit of 10 businesses since the second 
quarter of 2021, this culminated in approximately $1.8 
billion in annual savings.
Smart Capital remains a key component to our strategy as 
we prioritize critical investments to advance IDM 2.0. Intel 
also played a leading role in championing the passage of 
the U.S. CHIPS and Science Act to set the U.S. along the 
path to re-establishing global leadership in technology 
manufacturing. 
Looking Ahead to 2024
2023 was a year of consistent execution, where we 
achieved what we set out to do – and more. Thanks to the 
hard work of our talented and dedicated team, we have 
established a strong foundation for continued progress on 
our IDM 2.0 journey.
In 2024, we aim to build on this progress and continue 
raising the bar with our ambitions. We remain relentlessly 
focused on our mission and committed to driving long-term 
value for our shareholders. We firmly believe Intel’s 
brightest days lie ahead.

Introduction to Our Business
We are committed to creating world-changing 
technology that improves the life of every person 
on the planet—we are the technology the world 
builds on. We have the opportunity to push the 
boundaries of what’s possible and to create 
solutions to the world’s biggest challenges. As 
technology permeates every aspect of our lives, 
we see an insatiable demand for processing power. 
That is why we are opening our manufacturing 
network to the world and creating the resilient 
supply chain industries need. It’s why we are 
bringing the full breadth of our silicon and software 
to bear by bringing AI everywhere—from the client 
to the data center to the edge. It’s why we continue 
our relentless pursuit of Moore’s Law to unlock 
innovation and spark new ecosystems.
Much as oil has deﬁ
 ned geopolitics for the past 
ﬁ
 ve decades, technology supply chains and where 
semiconductors are built will deﬁ
 ne the next ﬁ
 ve 
decades. With one of the most geographically 
balanced supply chains across North America, 
Europe and Asia, we lead the way in creating open, 
end-to-end value chains that the US and Europe 
seek for resiliency and security—and that, for the 
ﬁ
 rst time, gives the ecosystem a true alternative to 
other foundries. 
We are at a pivotal moment in AI technology. AI 
is an incredibly powerful technology with untold 
potential, but it’s still relatively immature. We must 
ensure AI technology advances responsibly. 
Intel deﬁ
 nes the spirit of Moore’s Law as relentless 
innovation and pursuit of exponential leaps in 
computing power—all in close collaboration 
with our customers. But we’re not ﬁ
 nished yet. 
Continuous innovation is the cornerstone of 
Moore’s Law.
We do this because we are committed to being 
an excellent partner for the next era of compute: 
creating trusted environments, collaboratively 
innovating and delivering exceptional engineering, 
from silicon to services.
The possibilities are limitless. 
It starts with Intel.

A Year in Review
2023 revenue was $54.2 billion, down $8.8 billion, or 14%, from 2022. CCG revenue decreased 8% due to lower notebook and desktop 
volume from lower demand across market segments, partially offset by increased volume in the second half of the year as customer 
inventory levels normalized compared to higher levels in the first half. Notebook ASPs decreased due to a higher mix of small core 
products combined with a higher mix of older generation products. This was partially offset by higher desktop ASPs due to an increased 
mix of product sales to the commercial and gaming market segments. DCAI revenue decreased 20% due to lower server volume 
resulting from a softening CPU data center market, partially offset by higher ASPs from a lower mix of hyperscale customer-related 
revenue and a higher mix of high core count products. NEX revenue decreased 31% as customers tempered purchases to reduce 
inventories and adjust to a lower demand environment across product lines. We invested $16.0 billion in R&D, made capital investments 
of $25.8 billion, and had $11.5 billion in cash from operations and $(11.9) billion of adjusted free cash flow.

Managing to our long-term financial model
Our 2023 results reflect the continued advancement of our transformational journey. We continued to prioritize investments critical to our 
IDM 2.0 transformation, achieved operational milestones, and executed disciplined expense management. To achieve our long-term 
financial model, we believe it is imperative that we drive to world-class product cost and operational efficiency. A key component of our 
overall strategy is our internal foundry model. Under this model, we intend to reshape our operational dynamics and establish 
transparency and accountability through standalone profit and loss reporting for our manufacturing group in 2024. We expect this model to 
enable increased efficiencies across a number of aspects of our organization that we believe are integral to achieving our financial and 
operational goals. At the same time, we continue to prioritize capital investments critical to our efforts to regain process leadership and 
establish a leading-edge, at-scale foundry business.

Investing in leading-edge, at-scale manufacturing
We are committed to strengthening the resilience of the global semiconductor supply chain for leading-edge semiconductor products by 
investing in geographically balanced manufacturing capacity. In the US, we are expanding our existing operations in Arizona, New Mexico, 
and Oregon, and investing in two new leading-edge chip factories in Ohio. We have submitted all four of our major project proposals in 
Arizona, New Mexico, Ohio, and Oregon, estimated to represent over $100 billion of US manufacturing and research investments over the 
next five years, to the US Department of Commerce's CHIPS Program Office.
In the European Union and Israel, we have announced a series of investments, spanning our existing operations in Ireland and Israel, as 
well as our planned investment of more than $33 billion in Germany to build a leading-edge wafer fabrication mega-site, and our plans to 
invest up to $4.6 billion in an assembly and test facility in Poland. We also announced the start of high-volume manufacturing using Intel 4 
technology and EUV technology in Ireland.
Unlocking value
We continue to look for innovative ways to unlock value for our stakeholders. We sold a 32.4% minority stake in our IMS Nanofabrication 
business, including investments from Bain Capital and Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (TSMC). Net proceeds resulting 
from the IMS minority stake sales totaled $1.4 billion. We also executed a secondary offering of Mobileye stock that generated net 
proceeds of $1.6 billion. Further, we communicated our intent to operate our Programmable Solutions Group (PSG) as a standalone 
business, with standalone financial reporting beginning January 1, 2024. This is expected to enable potential private and public equity 
investments. These transactions provide an additional source of capital to support the critical investments needed to advance our strategy.

Our Strategy
Technology permeates every aspect of our lives and is increasingly central to every aspect of human existence. As we look ahead to the 
next decade, we expect to see continued demand for processing power. Semiconductors are the underlying technology powering this 
digital expansion, and we are strategically positioning ourselves to create a resilient global semiconductor supply chain by investing in 
geographically balanced manufacturing capacity. The demand for compute is being accelerated by five superpowers: ubiquitous compute, 
pervasive connectivity, cloud-to-edge infrastructure, AI, and sensing. Together these superpowers combine to amplify and reinforce each 
other, and will exponentially increase the world's need for computing by packing even more processing capability onto ever-smaller 
microchips. We intend to lead the industry by harnessing these superpowers for our customers' growth and our own.
We are uniquely positioned with the depth and breadth of our silicon, platforms, and software, and packaging and process technology with 
at-scale manufacturing. With these strengths and the tailwinds of the superpowers driving digital disruption, our strategy to win is focused 
on four key themes: product leadership, open platforms, manufacturing at scale, and our people. 
Our Priorities
Product Leadership
Lead and democratize compute with Intel x86 and xPU. Our product offerings provide end-to-end solutions, scaling from data center to 
network, PCs, edge computing, and the emerging fields of AI and autonomous driving, to serve an increasingly smart and connected 
world.
At our core is the x86 computing ecosystem, which supports an extensive and deep universe of software applications, with billions of lines 
of code written and optimized for x86 CPUs. We continue to advance this ecosystem with x86 microarchitectures focused on 
performance, which push the limits of low latency and single-threaded application performance, and microarchitectures focused on 
efficiency, which are designed for computing throughput efficiency to enable scalable multithreaded performance. 
Beyond the CPU, we are delivering a growing family of xPU products, which encompass client and data center GPUs, IPUs, FPGAs, and 
other accelerators. The xPU approach recognizes that different workloads benefit from different computing architectures, and our broad 
portfolio helps meet our customers' increasingly diverse computing needs. As part of our strategy, we seek to develop and offer leading 
products across each of these architectural categories. 
We also seek to address every phase of the AI continuum, including the largest, most challenging GenAI and large language models. We 
believe AI represents a generational shift in computing by expanding human abilities and solving the most challenging problems. We are in 
the early stages of realizing AI's full potential and GenAI is just the beginning. Our strategy is to bring AI to where the data is being 
generated and used and we believe we have a full spectrum of hardware and software platforms, offering open and modular solutions, for 
competitive total cost of ownership and time to value that customers need to win in this era of exponential growth and AI everywhere. We 
are infusing AI into Intel technologies, supporting today's GenAI workloads, fueling emerging usages like AI PC and AI at the edge, and 
pioneering innovations that we believe advance the future of AI in the next decade. We believe our leadership in IP, process, packaging, 
security, software, services, manufacturing, and foundry services positions us to realize AI's full potential to transform industries and solve 
the world's biggest challenges.

Open Platforms
We aim to deliver open software and hardware platforms with industry-defining standards. Around the globe, companies are building their 
networks, systems, and solutions on open standards-based platforms. Intel has helped set the stage for this movement, with our historic 
contributions in developing standards such as CXL, Thunderbolt™, and PCI Express*. We also contributed to the design, build, and 
validation of open-source products in the industry such as Linux*, Android*, and others. The world's developers constantly innovate and 
expand the capabilities of these open platforms while increasing their stability, reliability, and security. In addition, microservices have 
enabled the development of flexible, loosely coupled services that are connected via application programming interfaces to create end-to-
end processes. We use industry collaboration, co-engineering, and open-source contributions to accelerate software innovation. Through 
our oneAPI initiative, developers use a unified language across CPUs, GPUs, and FPGAs that is designed to reduce development time 
and to enhance productivity. We also deliver a steady stream of open-source code and optimizations that are designed for projects across 
virtually every platform and usage model. We are committed to co-engineering and jointly designing, building, and validating new products 
with software industry leaders to accelerate mutual technology advancements and help new software and hardware work better together. 
Our commitment extends to developers through our developer-first approach based on openness, choice, and trust. 
Ultimately, we believe our pivot to a software-defined, silicon-enhanced strategy will enable us to realize value at all layers of the compute 
stack. This should allow us to continue to monetize foundational and ecosystem-enabling software through hardware sales, limited 
licensing, and customer-enabling service offerings. Additionally, we are expanding our software portfolio by developing and monetizing 
software solutions, services, and platforms with SaaS, software subscriptions, and other business models. We are prioritizing three 
portfolios of offerings for our SaaS and subscription-based software: AI, trust and security, and performance optimization. We are also 
scaling the availability of Intel® Developer Cloud, which is designed to enable developers to learn, prototype, test, and run their own AI 
workloads across multiple Intel hardware architectures to experience the competitive performance of Intel platforms and develop their AI 
software from today’s hardware portfolio to next-generation architectures.
An open approach and deep engagement with the developer ecosystem are essential to lowering barriers to entry and unlocking AI 
innovations for developers and customers. We are expediting an open AI software ecosystem that we believe is needed to break down 
proprietary walls. We offer customers, partners, and developers early access and a rapid path to scale their AI solutions with the Intel 
Developer Cloud and integrated and scalable hardware and software systems and solutions. 
We believe AI will only be truly accessible to all when its use is ethical and responsible. Partnering with industry leaders, we are working to 
deliver innovative ecosystem tools and solutions intended to make AI safer and more secure, and help address privacy concerns as AI 
scales exponentially. We are building platforms and technologies for the convergence of AI and security to help customers confidently 
secure diverse AI workloads across the data center, cloud, PC, and edge.
Manufacturing at Scale 
IDM 2.0, the next evolution and expansion of our IDM model, is a differentiated strategy that combines three capabilities:
Internal factory network. Our global, internal factory network has been foundational to our success, enabling product optimization, 
improved economics, and supply resilience. We intend to remain a leading developer of process technology and a major manufacturer of 
semiconductors and will continue to build the majority of our products in our factories.
Strategic use of foundry capacity. We expect to expand our use of third-party foundry manufacturing capacity, which will provide us with 
increased flexibility and scale to optimize our product roadmaps for cost, performance, schedule, and supply. Our use of foundry capacity 
will include manufacturing for a range of modular tiles on advanced process technologies. 
Open System Foundry. We are building a world-class foundry business to meet the growing long-term global demand for semiconductors. 
We plan to differentiate our foundry offerings from those of others through a combination of leading-edge packaging and process 
technology, committed capacity in the US and Europe available for customers globally, and a world-class IP portfolio that will include x86 
cores, as well as other ecosystem IP. The current foundry model enabled explosion of ecosystem innovation at the wafer level. We believe 
this established model has historically served the industry well, but a new mindset is needed in our new era of chipmaking. As innovation 
evolves, we see the rack has collapsed into a system and the system has collapsed into an advanced package. We are building out an 
Open System Foundry that has four components: wafer fabrication, packaging, chiplet standard, and software.
The Open System Foundry involves engaging with customers at multiple levels, from basic wafer manufacturing to helping define and 
implement their desired system architectures. We intend to build our customers' silicon designs and deliver full end-to-end customizable 
products built with our advanced packaging technology. 
We believe our IDM 2.0 strategy enables us to deliver leading process technology and products to meet growing long-term demand using 
internal and external capacity, while leveraging our core strengths to provide foundry services to others and providing superior capacity, 
supply resilience, and an advantageous cost structure. 
In the upcoming year, we plan to implement an internal foundry model, where our business units engage with our manufacturing group in 
an arm's-length fashion, similar to how fabless semiconductor companies engage with external foundries. The model is integral to our IDM 
2.0 operational and financial strategies and aims to fully leverage our invested capital while serving a wide variety of chip customers 
worldwide.

Recent events, including the pandemic-related global chip shortage, made clear how supply chain disruptions can severely impact 
everyday life. The steady rise of chipmaking capacity in Asia has made the world vulnerable to continued and increasingly extreme 
shortages. We believe a secure, balanced, and resilient supply of semiconductors is essential to the interests of the entire global 
economy. With one of the most geographically balanced supply chains across North America, Europe and Asia, we plan to partner with 
the public sector to strengthen the resilience of the global semiconductor supply chain by investing in a more geographically balanced 
capacity. We believe our investments will help develop a more resilient supply chain for generations to come and hedge against 
geopolitical instability.
Our People
Our world-class talent is at the heart of everything we do. Together we strive to have a positive effect on business, society, and the planet. 
Delivering on our strategy and growth ambitions requires attracting, developing, and retaining top talent from across the world. Our people 
build our technology, unlock new business opportunities, and work with our partners and customers to create global impact.
Fostering a culture of empowerment, inclusion, and accountability is also core to our strategy. We are committed to creating an inclusive 
workplace where the world’s best engineers and technologists can fulfill their dreams and create technology that improves the life of every 
person on the planet.
Growth Imperative
We are investing to position the company for accelerated long-term growth, focusing on both our core businesses and our growth 
businesses. In our client and server businesses, our strategy is to invest to strengthen the competitiveness of our product roadmap and to 
explore new opportunities. We believe we have significant opportunities to grow and gain share in graphics; mobility, including 
autonomous driving; networking and edge; AI; software; and foundry services. 
Focus on Innovation and Execution
We are focused on executing our product and process roadmap and accelerating our cadence of innovation. We have set a detailed 
process and packaging technology roadmap and announced key architectural innovations to further our goal of delivering leadership 
products in every area in which we compete. We are returning our culture to its roots in innovation and execution, drawing on principles 
established by our former CEO Andy Grove that emphasize discipline and accountability. This includes using OKRs throughout the 
organization to drive a common purpose.
To help us execute toward our IDM 2.0 strategy, we are leveraging our Smart Capital approach. This approach is designed to enable us to 
adjust quickly to opportunities in the market, while managing our margin structure and capital spending. The key elements of Smart 
Capital include:
▪
Smart capacity investments. We are aggressively building out manufacturing shell space, which gives us flexibility in how and 
when we bring additional capacity online based on milestone triggers such as product readiness, market conditions, and 
customer commitments. 
▪
Government incentives. We are continuing to work with governments in the US and Europe to advance and benefit from 
incentives for domestic manufacturing capacity for leading-edge semiconductors. 
▪
SCIP. We are accessing strategically aligned capital to increase our flexibility and help efficiently accelerate and scale 
manufacturing build-outs. This type of co-investment also demonstrates how private capital is unlocked and becomes a force 
multiplier for government incentives for semiconductor manufacturing expansion.
▪
Customer commitments. IFS is working closely with potential customers to make advance payments to secure capacity. This 
provides us with the advantage of committed volume, de-risking investments while providing capacity corridors for our foundry 
customers.
▪
External foundries. We intend to continue our use of external foundries where their unique capabilities support our leadership 
products.

Financial Capital
We take a disciplined approach to our financial capital allocation strategy, which continues to focus on building stakeholder value and is 
driven by our priority to invest in the business and capacity and our capital needs. We also seek to pay competitive dividends, optimize 
our portfolio, look for innovative ways to unlock value across our assets, and, from time-to-time, engage in mergers and acquisitions. As 
we invest in our IDM 2.0 strategy and implement our next phase of capacity expansions and the acceleration of our process technology 
roadmap, our allocation priorities have shifted more heavily toward investing in the business and away from stock repurchases. In the long 
term, we will continue to look for opportunities to further our strategy through acquisitions while remaining disciplined on capital allocation.

Our Financial Capital Allocation Strategy
Invest in the Business
Our first allocation priority is to invest in R&D and capital spending to capitalize on the opportunity presented by the world's demand for 
semiconductors. In 2023, we continued our focus on capital investment and the deployment of our Smart Capital strategy. 
Return Excess Cash to Stockholders
Our capital allocation strategy includes returning excess cash to stockholders. We achieve this through our dividend policy and, when 
permissible, stock repurchases. In 2023, we declared a reduced quarterly dividend on our common stock. This dividend reduction reflects 
our deliberate approach to capital allocation, is expected to support the critical investments needed to execute our business strategy, and 
is designed to position us to create long-term value. We expect future stock repurchases to continue to be curtailed during this time of 
meaningful investment in capital.

Optimize our Portfolio and Unlock Value
Our capital allocation strategy also includes opportunistic investment in and acquisition of companies that complement our strategic 
objectives. We look for acquisitions that supplement and strengthen our capital and R&D investments. 
We also seek to drive value creation through transactions such as the 2022 Mobileye IPO, the 2023 minority stake sales in IMS, and the 
2023 announcement of our intent to operate PSG as a standalone business which we expect to enable potential private and public equity 
investments. Together, these transactions provide an additional source of capital to support the critical investments needed to advance 
our business strategy.
Lastly, we take action when investments do not strategically align to our key priorities. In the last three years, we exited numerous 
businesses, including the NAND memory business and Intel® Optane™ memory business.

Intellectual Capital
Research and Development
R&D investment is critical to enable us to deliver on our accelerated technology roadmap, introduce leading products, and develop new 
businesses and capabilities in the future. We seek to protect our R&D efforts through our IP rights and may augment R&D initiatives by 
acquiring or investing in companies, entering into R&D agreements, and directly purchasing or licensing technology.
Areas Key to Product Leadership
We have intensified our focus on areas key to product leadership. Our objective with each new generation of products is to improve user 
experiences and value through advances in performance, power, cost, connectivity, security, form factor, and other features. We also 
focus on reducing our design complexity, re-using IP, and increasing ecosystem collaboration to improve our efficiency.
Process and packaging. Our leading-edge process and packaging technology and world-class IP portfolio are key to the success of our 
strategy. We are committed to achieving process technology leadership in 2025 by planning to deliver five technology nodes in four 
years. In addition, we have solidified our process and packaging offerings to external customers through IFS.
▪
Intel 7 process node is in production for our 13th Gen Intel Core processors and represents the continuous improvement of 
transistor and interconnect performance.
▪
Intel 4, our first EUV node, delivers significant density scaling and approximately 20% performance-per-watt improvement over 
Intel 7. The Intel Core Ultra processor is our first high-volume client product on Intel 4 and began shipping to customers in Q3 
2023.
▪
Intel 3 is expected to deliver further logic scaling and up to 18% performance-per-watt improvement over Intel 4. Intel 3 is our 
first advanced node offered to IFS customers and is optimized for the needs of data center products.
▪
Intel 20A will follow Intel 3 and will introduce two breakthrough technologies that we expect to deliver up to a 15% performance-
per-watt improvement over Intel 3: RibbonFET and PowerVia. RibbonFET, our implementation of a gate-all-around transistor, is 
designed to deliver faster transistor switching speeds while achieving the same drive current as multiple fins, but in a smaller 
footprint. PowerVia is our unique industry-first implementation of backside power delivery that is designed to optimize signal 
transmission by eliminating the need for power routing on the front side of the wafer.
▪
Intel 18A, our second IFS advanced node offering, will improve on Intel 20A by delivering ribbon innovation for design 
optimization and line width reduction. Intel 18A is expected to deliver an additional 10% improvement in performance per watt 
over Intel 20A.
▪
Beyond Intel 18A, we have initiated definition and development of our next two process nodes and continue to define, build, 
and develop the next-generation High Numerical Aperture EUV lithography into our process technology roadmap. To continue 
our modernization and infrastructure expansions, we have begun the installation of the world’s first High-NA EUV tool for 
commercial use at our Gordon Moore Park in Oregon.
▪
Our family of 3D advanced packaging technology will usher in the next generation of Foveros technology, enabling us to mix 
multiple top die tiles with multiple base tiles across mixed fab nodes, providing greater flexibility for disaggregated chip designs. 
Our future Foveros Direct technology should scale interconnect pitch below 10µm, enable direct copper-to-copper bonding for 
low-resistance interconnects, and blur the boundary between wafer and package. Longer term, we expect to deliver complete 
glass substrate solutions as the next generation of advanced packaging designed to enable continued scaling of transistors in a 
package.
xPU architecture. We believe the future is a diverse mix of scalar, vector, matrix, and spatial architectures deployed in CPU, GPU, IPU, 
accelerator, and FPGA sockets, enabled by a scalable software stack and integrated into systems by advanced packaging technology. 
We are building processors that span several major computing architectures, moving toward an era of heterogeneous computing: 
▪
CPU. We started shipping our 5th Gen Intel Xeon Scalable processors based on Intel 7 with built-in AI acceleration, 
cryptographic acceleration, and advanced security capabilities. We also launched our 14th Gen Intel Core processors, which are 
designed to scale from thin and light laptops to enthusiast desktop and notebook platforms. These are based on a hybrid 
architecture utilizing our most advanced performance cores and power-efficient cores.
▪
GPU and HPC. The Intel Arc graphics family offers modern GPU features to power today's demanding games, applications, and 
AI workloads. In 2023, the Intel Arc portfolio expanded while offering a substantial performance uplift through continual driver 
updates, offering consumer and professional solutions that target a significant part of the market. Intel Arc discrete GPUs 
currently ship in three performance tiers, with Intel Arc 7, 5, and 3 series for consumers, and Intel Arc Pro A60, A50, and A40 for 
workstations. In the mobile segment, Intel Arc A-series GPUs can be found powering a range of consumer and workstation 
designs. In Q1 2023, we launched the Intel® Xeon® CPU Max Series and Intel® Data Center GPU Max Series. Designed for the 
future compute demands of HPC and AI workloads, the Intel Max Series product family power the Aurora supercomputer at 
Argonne National Laboratory.

▪
Infrastructure Acceleration. Our first ASIC IPU has been deployed widely across Google Cloud. Our second generation IPU, is 
also co-developed with Google and is expected to tape in the first half of 2024. It is expected to double the throughput and 
compute capabilities. The IPU becomes the center of the CSP compute platform, with the bulk of CSP infrastructure cycles spent 
running on the IPU and not the host processor. This frees up processing cores for business-value applications and infrastructure 
as a service rental.
▪
Ethernet. Our 200G foundational network interface card targeting cloud, enterprise, and edge, is expected to go into production 
in 2H 2024 and extend our 100G market. Additionally, we plan to productize our 10G/2.5G/1G offering, a refresh of our high-
volume 10G and 1G portfolio with modernized software, management, and manufacturing technologies. 
▪
Matrix Accelerator. We are showing strong customer and performance momentum for our Intel® Gaudi® AI accelerators. In Q3 
2023, we announced that a large AI supercomputer would be built entirely on Intel Xeon processors and 4,000 Intel Gaudi 2 AI 
hardware accelerators, with Stability AI as the anchor customer.
Software. Software unleashes the potential of our hardware platforms across all workloads, domains, and architectures. 
▪
oneAPI adoption continues to expand across the industry. oneAPI is designed to enable developers to build cross-architecture 
applications using a single code base across CPUs, GPUs, and FPGAs to reduce development time and enhance productivity. 
Our oneAPI-based tools take advantage of unique hardware features and lower software development and maintenance costs. 
Developers can choose the best architecture for the problem at hand without rewriting their entire code base, accelerating their 
time to value.
▪
We seek to accelerate adoption of oneAPI and Intel software developer tools through diverse ecosystem activities, including 
developer training, summits, centers of excellence, access to Intel hardware and software through Intel Developer Cloud and 
industry collaboration through the Linux Foundation's Unified Acceleration (UXL) Foundation project. Our Intel Developer Cloud 
offering is designed to host global users spanning AI, data science, high-performance computing, media and graphics, and other 
accelerated computing workloads using oneAPI and the latest Intel hardware.
▪
We believe AI will be ubiquitous, and with our tools and the broad open software ecosystem, we are well-positioned to scale AI. 
We optimize and contribute software to popular frameworks, such as PyTorch and TensorFlow, to achieve the best performance 
for Intel platforms and to deliver productivity and programmability for AI developers. We are accelerating the disruption of the 
proprietary ecosystems through Intel contributions to new software AI languages such as Triton, Mojo, and JAX. This higher level 
of open, vendor-independent programmability, combined with Intel's commitment to open spec governance, implementations, 
licensing models, and segment-optimized solutions, such as OpenVINO™ powered by oneAPI, offers customers a choice of 
hardware and software stack tailored to diverse workload needs.
▪
We seek to continually improve our system and foundational-level software in support of our client, data center, networking, and 
graphics products, delivering AI-optimized software across the stack, including BIOS, firmware, simulation, operating systems, 
and virtualization.
IP Rights
We own and develop significant IP and related IP rights around the world that support our products, services, R&D, and other activities 
and assets. Our IP portfolio includes patents, copyrights, trade secrets, trademarks, mask works, and other rights. We actively seek to 
protect our global IP rights and deter unauthorized use of our IP and other assets. 
We have obtained patents in the US and other countries. Because of the fast pace of innovation and product development, our products 
are often obsolete before the patents related to them expire, and in some cases our products may be obsolete before the patents are 
granted. As we expand our product offerings, particularly around our foundry business, we also seek to extend our patent development 
efforts. In addition to developing patents based on our own R&D efforts, we may purchase or license patents from third parties. 
The software that we distribute, including software embedded in our products, is entitled to copyright and other IP protection. To 
distinguish our products from our competitors' products, we have obtained trademarks and trade names for our products, and we maintain 
cooperative advertising programs with customers to promote our brands and to identify products containing genuine Intel components. 
We also protect details about our processes, products, and strategies as trade secrets, keeping confidential the information that we 
believe provides us with a competitive advantage.
Efforts to protect our IP can be difficult, particularly in countries that provide less protection to IP rights and in the absence of harmonized 
international IP standards. Competitors and others may already have IP rights covering similar products. There is no assurance that we 
will be able to obtain IP rights covering our own products or that we will be able to obtain IP licenses from other companies on favorable 
terms or at all. For a discussion of IP-related risks, see "Risk Factors" within Risk Factors and Other Key Information. While our IP rights 
are important to our success, our business as a whole is not significantly dependent on any single patent, copyright, or other IP right.

Manufacturing Capital
As the guardians of Moore's Law, we continue to innovate to advance the design and manufacturing of semiconductors to help address 
our customers' greatest challenges. This makes possible new leadership products with higher performance while balancing power 
efficiency, cost, and size. 
Our IDM 2.0 strategy allows us to deliver leadership products using internal and external capacity while leveraging our core strengths to 
provide foundry services to others. IDM 2.0 combines three capabilities. First, we will continue to build most of our products in our fabs. 
Second, we expect to expand our use of third-party foundry capacity to manufacture a range of modular tiles on advanced process 
technologies. Third, we are building a world-class foundry business with IFS, which we expect will combine leading-edge packaging and 
process technology, committed capacity in the US and Europe, and a world-class IP portfolio that will include x86 cores, as well as other 
ecosystem IP. 
Network and Supply Chain
In 2023, our factories delivered continuous support to our customers as we ramped new process technologies and equipment for our 
products and expanded Open System Foundry offerings. We continue to work across our supply chain to minimize disruptions, improve 
productivity, and increase overall capacity and output to meet customer expectations.
Our global supply chain supports internal partners across architecture, product design, technology development, manufacturing and 
operations, sales and marketing, and business units, and our supply ecosystem comprises thousands of suppliers globally. Our mission is 
to enable product and process leadership, industry-leading total cost of ownership, and on-time and uninterrupted supply for our 
customers, delivered in a responsible and sustainable manner. 
As of the end of 2023, we had nine geographically dispersed manufacturing sites in production. The following map shows the locations of 
these factory sites. Our manufacturing facilities are primarily used for silicon wafer manufacturing, assembling, testing, and advanced 
packaging. We operate in a network of manufacturing facilities integrated as though they were one factory to provide the most flexible 
supply capacity, allowing us to better analyze our production costs and adapt to changes in capacity needs. Our new process 
technologies, when ready for high volume manufacturing, are transferred from a central development fab to one or more of our 
manufacturing facilities. The network of factories and the development fab collaborate to continue driving operational improvements. This 
enables fast ramp of the operation, quick learning, and quality control.
We are expanding manufacturing capacity across multiple sites and geographies. These include silicon wafer manufacturing in Arizona, 
Germany, Ireland, Israel, Ohio, and Oregon and advanced packaging manufacturing in Malaysia and New Mexico. This year, we added 
Poland to our assembly and test expansion roadmap. These investments further our IDM 2.0 strategy and are expected to support a 
resilient semiconductor supply chain and to create the foundation for a next-generation chip ecosystem.

Human Capital
Our human capital strategy is grounded in our belief that our people are fundamental to our success. Delivering on our strategy and 
growth ambitions requires attracting, developing, and retaining top talent across the world. We are committed to creating an inclusive 
workplace where the world's best engineers and technologists can fulfill their dreams and create technology that improves the life of every 
person on the planet. We invest in our highly skilled workforce of 124,800 people (as of December 30, 2023) by creating practices, 
programs, and benefits that support the evolving world of work and our employees' needs. 
Our human capital philosophy includes three pillars we believe are needed to position our talent strategy as a competitive advantage:
▪
Hire and retain the best talent: We have embraced the future of work with a flexible, hybrid-first approach that differentiates Intel 
from competitors. 
▪
Develop our talent to full potential: We have updated role descriptions and career pathways to better enable movement and help 
top talent work on the highest priorities.
▪
Create a winning culture: We have reignited Intel's results-driven, performance culture.
Fostering a culture of empowerment, inclusion, and accountability is also core to our strategy. We believe that an inclusive culture is 
important for attracting, developing, and retaining top talent, and we strive to provide a work environment where all employees from all 
backgrounds are valued, challenged, and rewarded. We are focused on reinvigorating our culture to strengthen our execution and 
accelerate our cadence of innovation. Our values—customer first, fearless innovation, results driven, one Intel, inclusion, quality, and 
integrity—inspire us and are key to delivering on our purpose. All employees are responsible for upholding these values, the Intel Code of 
Conduct, and Intel's Global Human Rights Principles, which form the foundation of our policies and practices and ethical business culture.
Talent Management
We continue to see significant competition for talent throughout the semiconductor industry. Our hiring was limited in 2023, in line with 
macroeconomic forecasts, financial performance, and cost-cutting measures, and we took actions to rebalance our workforce. However, 
the investments we are making to accelerate our process technology require continued and focused efforts to attract and retain talent—
especially technical talent. Our undesired turnover rate1 was 5.6% in both 2023 and 2022.
We invest significant resources to develop the talent needed to remain at the forefront of innovation and make Intel an employer of choice. 
We offer extensive training programs and provide rotational assignment opportunities and have updated our job architecture to help 
employees create custom learning curricula for building skills and owning their careers. To further support the growth and development of 
our people, we continue to increase mentoring in our technical community, drive engagement through employee resource groups, and 
promote health and wellness resources to all our people. Through our annual employee experience survey, employee inclusion survey, 
and manager development feedback survey, employees can voice their perceptions of the company, their managers, their work 
experiences, and their learning and development opportunities. Our employees' voices are important to enable our culture of continuous 
improvement, and as a result, we link a portion of our executive and employee performance bonus to year-over-year improvements of our 
employee experience survey results. Our performance management system is designed to support our cultural evolution and to increase 
our focus on disciplined OKRs.

Inclusion
Diversity and inclusion are core elements of Intel's values and instrumental to driving innovation and 
positioning us for growth. Over the past decade, we have taken actions to integrate diversity and 
inclusion expectations into our culture, performance and management systems, leadership 
expectations, and annual bonus metrics. Through our annual employee inclusion survey, 
employees can voice their experiences at Intel and provide feedback on how we can continue to 
improve. We are proud of what we have accomplished to advance diversity and inclusion, but we 
believe we can achieve more, including beyond the walls of Intel. Our RISE strategy and 2030 goals 
set our global ambitions for the rest of the decade, including, in part, ambitious goals to achieve 
25% representation of women in senior leadership; achieve 12% representation of 
underrepresented minorities in US senior leadership; achieve 10% representation of employees 
with a disability in our global workforce; and exceed 40% representation of women in technical 
roles, including engineering positions and other roles with technical job requirements. Our ambitious 
goals were established, in part, based on modeling of where market availability is expected to be in 
2030. Market availability analysis will be re-conducted over the time period to assess ongoing 
alignment and expectations. To drive accountability, we continue to link a portion of our executive 
and employee compensation to diversity and inclusion metrics. 
We have committed our scale, expertise, and reach through our comprehensive RISE strategy to 
work with customers and other stakeholders to accelerate the adoption of inclusive business 
practices across industries. As part of the Alliance for Global Inclusion, we worked with a coalition of 
technology companies to create a global inclusion index survey, which serves as a benchmark for 
companies to track diversity and inclusion improvements, provide information on current best 
practices, and highlight opportunities to improve outcomes across industries. The results of the third 
global inclusion index survey were published in 2023 and shared with business leaders across 
industries. For the first time, based on the maturity of the respondents' best practices, the survey 
results transitioned to an index, in which organizations that received an overall score of 50% or 
higher across all regions in which they participated were recognized for their diversity and inclusion 
efforts. There were 27 respondents and, of those, 18 earned spots on the index, including Intel. This 
collective effort allows the industry to more clearly identify actions needed to advance progress on 
closing persistent gaps and advancing more inclusive practices in workplaces, industry, and society. 
The survey shows increased commitment to diversity and inclusion around key areas of workforce 
inclusivity, recruitment, advancement opportunities, and accountability. We will also continue to 
collaborate on initiatives that expand the diverse pipeline of talent for our industry, advance social 
equity, make technology fully inclusive, and expand digital readiness for millions of people around 
the world.
2  Senior leadership refers to salary grades 10+ and equivalent grades. While we present male and female, we acknowledge this is not fully encompassing 
of all gender identities.
3 The term underrepresented minority (URM) is used to describe diverse populations, including Black/African American, Hispanic, and Native American 
employees in the US.
Compensation and Benefits
We structure pay, benefits, and services to meet the varying needs of our employees, helping support employee financial well-being with 
competitive compensation, investment opportunities, and financial resources. Our total rewards package includes market-competitive pay, 
broad-based stock grants and bonuses, an employee stock purchase plan, healthcare and retirement benefits, paid time off and family 
leave, parent reintegration, fertility assistance, flexible work schedules, sabbaticals, and on-site services. Since 2019, we have achieved 
gender pay equity globally and we continue to maintain race/ethnicity pay equity in the US. We achieve pay equity by closing the gap in 
average pay between employees of different genders or race/ethnicity in the same or similar roles after accounting for legitimate business 
factors that can explain differences, such as location, time at grade level, and tenure. We have also advanced transparency in our pay 
and representation data by publicly releasing our EEO-1 survey pay data since 2019. We believe that our holistic approach toward pay 
equity, representation, and creating an inclusive culture enables us to cultivate a workplace that helps employees develop and progress in 
their careers at all levels. Our "hybrid-first" approach to working was informed by employees surveyed around the globe and involves the 
majority of our employees splitting their time between working remotely and in the office. Hybrid-first and remote work options cast a wider 
recruitment net and support our ambition to hire the best global talent. Currently, there is no company-wide mandate on the number of 
days per week employees should be on site or how they should collaborate. Our goal is to enable remote and on-site work where it drives 
the best output, while providing our employees with equitable access to systems, resources, and opportunities that allow them to succeed.
Health, Safety, and Wellness
We are committed to providing a safe and injury-free workplace. We regularly invest in programs designed to improve physical, mental, 
and social well-being. We provide access to a variety of innovative, flexible, and convenient health and wellness programs, including on-
site health centers, and we aim to increase awareness of and support for mental and behavioral health. In support of our RISE goals, we 
intend to continue our efforts to build our strong safety culture and drive the global expansion of our corporate wellness program through 
employee education and engagement activities.

Social and Relationship Capital
We are committed to engaging in initiatives that support our communities and help us develop trusted relationships with our stakeholders. 
Proactive engagement with our stakeholders and investments in social impact initiatives, including those aligned with the United Nations 
Sustainable Development Goals, advance our position as a leading corporate citizen and create shared value for Intel, our global supply 
chain, and our communities.
Economic and social. The health of our business and local economies depends in part on continued investments in innovation. We 
provide high-skill, high-paying jobs around the world, many of which are manufacturing and R&D jobs located in our factories. As we 
expand operations in both existing and new locations around the world, we are building a pipeline of qualified workers through our talent 
strategy and the many investments we are making in education. We also benefit economies through our R&D ecosystem spending, 
sourcing activities, employee spending, and tax payments. We make sizable capital investments and provide leadership in public-private 
partnerships to spur economic growth and innovation. 
We stand at the forefront of new technologies that are increasingly being used to empower individuals, companies, and governments 
around the world to solve global challenges. We aim to empower people through education and advance social initiatives to create career 
pathways into the technology industry. This includes our global Intel Digital Readiness Programs, such as AI for Youth and AI for 
Workforce, scaled in partnership with governments and institutions to empower individuals with digital readiness and AI skills. Additionally, 
we invest in multi-year partnerships with historically Black colleges and universities in the US to increase the number of Black/African 
Americans who pursue electrical engineering, computer engineering, and computer science fields. Our employees and retirees share their 
expertise through volunteer initiatives in the communities where we operate, volunteering 3.8 million1 hours over the past four years. 
These efforts contribute to our RISE goal to volunteer 10 million hours over a decade. Since 2020, we announced and further expanded 
upon the Intel RISE Technology Initiative, which provides an expanded channel to build deeper relationships with our customers and 
partners aligned with our corporate purpose and work to create shared value through our RISE strategy. Specifically, we are funding 
projects in areas such as using technology to improve health and safety, making technology more inclusive while expanding digital 
readiness, and carbon-neutral computing to help address climate change. 
Human rights commitment. We are committed to maintaining and improving systems and processes to avoid causing or contributing to 
adverse impacts on human rights in our own operations, products, and supply chain. We have established an integrated approach to 
managing human rights across our business, including senior-level management involvement and board-level oversight. We also meet 
throughout the year with external stakeholders and experts on human rights to continue to inform and evolve our human rights policies 
and oversight processes. While we do not always know nor can we control what products our customers create or the applications end 
users may develop, we do not support or tolerate our products being used to adversely impact human rights. Where we become aware of 
a concern that Intel products are being used by a business partner in connection with abuses of human rights, we intend to evaluate and 
restrict or cease business with the third party unless and until we have a high confidence that Intel's products are not being used to 
adversely impact human rights.

Supply Chain Responsibility
We actively manage our supply chain to help reduce risk, improve product quality, achieve environmental and social goals, and improve 
overall performance and value creation for Intel, our customers, and our suppliers. To drive responsible and sustainable practices 
throughout our supply chain, we have robust programs to educate and engage suppliers that support our global manufacturing operations. 
We actively collaborate with other companies and lead industry initiatives on key issues such as improving transparency around climate 
and water impacts in the global electronics supply chain and, as part of our RISE strategy, we are advancing collaboration across our 
industry on responsible minerals sourcing. Through these efforts we help set electronics industry-wide standards, develop audit 
processes, and conduct training.
Over the past decade, we have directly engaged with suppliers to verify compliance and build capacity to address risks of forced and 
bonded labor and other human rights issues. We perform periodic audits, and identify critical direct suppliers to engage through capability-
building programs, which help suppliers build sustainability acumen and verify compliance with the Responsible Business Alliance and the 
Intel Code of Conduct. We also engage with indirect suppliers through our programs on forced and bonded labor, responsible minerals, 
and supplier diversity. To achieve our RISE goals, we are significantly expanding the number of suppliers covered by our engagement 
activities. The supply chain environmental team is also actively engaging suppliers to measure and reduce their greenhouse gas 
emissions footprints and the resulting impact on our footprint. These activities are intended to help us meet our long-term emissions 
reductions goals, including our goal to achieve net-zero upstream Scope 3 greenhouse gas emissions by 2050, which we announced in 
2023.
Our commitment to diversity and inclusion also extends to our suppliers. We believe a diverse supply chain supports greater innovation 
and value for our business. We have set additional spending targets with women-owned suppliers outside the US and with minority-
owned suppliers globally to accelerate progress toward our goal to increase global annual spending with diverse suppliers to reach $2.0 
billion in annual spending by 2030.
Natural Capital
Driving to the lowest possible environmental footprint as we grow helps us create efficiencies, support our communities, and respond to 
the needs of our stakeholders. We invest in environmental projects and set company-wide environmental targets to drive reductions in 
greenhouse gas emissions, energy and water use, and waste generation. We build energy efficiency into our products to help our 
customers lower their own emissions, energy usage, and costs, and we collaborate with policymakers and other stakeholders to use 
technology to address environmental challenges. 
In April 2022, we announced our new goal to reach net-zero greenhouse gas emissions in our operations by 2040, creating an important 
target to strengthen our commitment to sustainable business practices. We furthered our commitment in 2023 by announcing our goal to 
reach net-zero upstream Scope 3 greenhouse gas emissions by 2050. Our 2030 RISE goals continue to be important milestones to drive 
to higher levels of operational efficiency, including a goal of a 10% reduction in our greenhouse gas emissions on an absolute basis from a 
2019 baseline by 2030. We continue to take action on emissions reduction strategies focused on emissions abatement, and to make 
additional investments in renewable electricity, process and equipment optimization, and energy conservation. In 2023, we linked a 
portion of the executive and employee performance bonus to our goal to reduce our 2023 Scope 1 and 2 greenhouse gas emissions by 
130,000 metric tons carbon dioxide equivalent, compared to 2022. Our RISE strategy also focuses on addressing climate change impacts 
upstream and downstream in the value chain. This includes improving product energy efficiency and increasing our "handprint"—the ways 
in which Intel technologies can help others reduce their footprints, including Internet of Things solutions that enable intelligence in 
machines, buildings, supply chains, and factories, and make electrical grids smarter, safer, and more efficient. 
In August 2023, we published our inaugural green bond report, which provides an update on the allocation of the net proceeds of the $1.3 
billion principal amount of senior notes issued in 2022. We are using the proceeds from the green bond offering to fund projects that 
support our investments in sustainable operations, which can include items such as green buildings, energy efficiency, circular economy 
and waste management, greenhouse gas emissions reductions, water stewardship, and renewable energy. 
Energy
We focus on reducing our own climate change impact, and over the past two decades have reduced our direct and indirect greenhouse 
gas emissions associated with energy consumption. Through our RISE goals, we have committed to a goal of conserving 4 billion kWh of 
energy this decade. We have conserved 1.6 billion kWh1 of energy cumulatively since 2020. We also invest in renewable electricity and 
on-site alternative energy projects in support of our 2030 goal to achieve 100% renewable electricity use across our global operations. In 
2023, continuing our practice of linking a portion of our executive and employee performance bonus to our corporate sustainability 
metrics, we linked a portion of the performance bonus to our 2023 target to reach 95% renewable electricity use globally. We reached our 
target and achieved 99%1 renewable electricity usage globally in 2023.
1  This is a preliminary estimate. The final number will be reported in our 2023-24 Corporate Responsibility Report, to be issued later in 2024.

Water Stewardship
Water is essential to the semiconductor manufacturing process. We use ultrapure water to remove impurities from our silicon wafers, and 
we use fresh and reclaimed water to run our manufacturing facility systems. Through our RISE goals, we have committed to achieve net 
positive water globally, and as part of that effort, conserve 60 billion gallons of water in this decade. Water conservation reduces the 
amount of water needed from fresh water sources; we have conserved 35.9 billion gallons1 of water and enabled restoration of 9.6 billion 
gallons1 of water to local watersheds since 2020. In 2023, we linked a portion of our executive and employee performance bonus to our 
target to conserve and restore 12.0 billion gallons of water during the year.
Circular Economy and Waste Management
We have long been committed to waste management, recycling, and circular economy strategies that enable the recovery and productive 
re-use of waste streams. Our 2030 goals include a target of zero waste2 to landfill, as well as implementation of circular economy 
strategies for 60% of our manufacturing waste streams in partnership with our suppliers. We continue to focus on opportunities to upcycle 
waste by improving waste segregation practices and collaborating with our suppliers to evaluate new technologies for waste recovery. In 
2023, we linked a portion of our executive and employee performance bonus to our interim target to achieve 5% of waste to landfill.
Governance and Disclosure
We are committed to transparency around our carbon footprint and climate risk, and use the framework developed by the TCFD to inform 
our disclosure on climate governance, strategy, risk management, and metrics and targets. For governance and strategy, we follow an 
integrated approach to address climate change, with multiple teams responsible for managing climate-related activities, initiatives, and 
policies, with senior-level management involvement and board-level oversight, including the Corporate Governance and Nominating 
Committee. We describe our overall risk management processes in our Proxy Statement, and describe climate-related risks and 
opportunities in our annual Corporate Responsibility Report, the Intel Climate Change Policy, and "Risk Factors" within this Form 10-K. In 
addition to what is included in this Form 10-K, information about and progress toward our RISE goals is included in our Corporate 
Responsibility Report. Our Corporate Responsibility Report also includes a mapping of our disclosure to the TCFD, GRI and SASB 
frameworks. The Corporate Responsibility Report and our CDP Climate Change Survey are available on our website and are published 
annually.3 In November 2023, we published our first Climate Transition Action Plan, which is available on our website.

Market and Business Overview
Market Trends and Strategy
In 2023, the automotive industry grew with an approximately 9% increase in global vehicle production year over year. We expect industry 
ADAS volumes to grow faster than overall global vehicle production in the coming years and anticipate long-term ADAS growth from 
increases in the percentage of vehicles that are equipped with basic ADAS features from the factory. Despite our expectation for a decline 
in Mobileye ADAS volumes in 2024 due to a correction of inventory with our customers, we continue to believe we will benefit from 
positive industry ADAS growth over the medium-term. In addition to potential volume growth, our portfolio of advanced solutions has the 
potential to drive higher average system price over time.
Beyond ADAS solutions, we believe that the availability of AVs will cause a significant transformation in mobility, including vehicle 
ownership and utilization. We expect that AV technology will eventually be accessed by consumers through shared-vehicle MaaS 
networks, as well as in consumer-owned and operated AVs. We are pursuing this market trend by using our eyes-on/hands-off Mobileye 
SuperVision solution as a baseline to scale to our eyes-off/hands-off Mobileye Chauffeur consumer AV product in a variety of operational 
design domains. As it relates to AMaaS, we intend to primarily go to market by supplying Mobileye Drive™ self-driving system to 
transportation network companies, public transit operators, and suppliers of AV-ready vehicle platforms. In some cases, we expect to 
bundle our Mobileye Drive self-driving system with Moovit’s urban mobility and transit intelligence application and its global user base.
Products and Competition
We currently ship a variety of ADAS solutions to a large number of global automakers. We are recognized for our top-rated safety 
solutions globally, and since 2007, we have introduced numerous industry-first ADAS products. 
We are building a robust portfolio of end-to-end ADAS and autonomous driving solutions to provide the capabilities needed for the future 
of autonomous driving, leveraging a comprehensive suite of purpose-built software and hardware technologies. We pioneered “base” 
ADAS features to enhance vehicle safety and to meet global regulatory requirements and safety ratings with our driver assist solution and 
we have since created a new category of ADAS with our Cloud-Enhanced Driver-Assist™ and premium driver assist offerings, such as 
Mobileye SuperVision. By leveraging Mobileye SuperVision’s full-surround computer vision and True Redundancy™, we are developing 
Mobileye Chauffeur, our consumer AV solution and Mobileye Drive, our eyes-off/hands-off autonomous driving solution designed for fleet 
deployment. Our current offerings to Tier 1 and OEM customers do not include cameras, radars, lidar systems, or other sensors (except in 
particular cases). We intend in the future to offer radar and lidar products that are currently in development stages. 
The ADAS and autonomous driving industries are highly competitive. In the ADAS and consumer AV market, we face competition primarily 
from other external providers, including Tier 1 automotive suppliers and silicon providers, as well as in-house solutions developed by 
OEMs to a certain extent. Our Tier 1 customers may be developing or may in the future develop competing solutions. In the autonomous 
driving market, including AMaaS and consumer AV, we face competition from technology companies; internal development teams from the 
automakers themselves, sometimes in combination with investments in early-stage autonomous vehicle technology companies, Tier 1 
automotive companies, as well as robotaxi providers.

Market and Business Overview
Market Trends and Strategy
The chip industry is undergoing a structural transformation driven by:
▪
Five superpowers: ubiquitous compute, pervasive connectivity, cloud-to-edge infrastructure, AI, and sensing;
▪
A generational shift in computer architectures: the move from system on chip to system of chips (chiplets), increased tailoring of 
chips to workloads, especially AI, and the vertical integration into chipmaking by OEMs and CSPs; 
▪
Increasing costs of R&D and capacity for advanced node technologies; and
▪
Supply chain risk highlighted by geo-political issues and the growing need for a resilient, secure, and sustainable global supply 
chain. 
These transformational trends are driving significant semiconductor market growth in leading-edge silicon and packaging technologies, 
especially in systems of chips for AI applications. Customers have to make complex design choices at every level of the system, from 
packaging technologies, process nodes, interconnects, physical IP, and compute elements to software. The abundance of technology 
choices and optimizations is adding complexity in design, technology, integration, and manufacturing. 
Our IDM 2.0 strategy includes our pursuit of these complex manufacturing and market growth opportunities by making significant capital 
investments in leading-edge semiconductor technologies in order to create foundry capacity and establish IFS as a major provider of 
foundry services that provides semiconductor manufacturing solutions for others and for ourselves. We have made and expect to continue 
to make significant capital investments in furtherance of this strategy.
Products and Competition
We seek to address this tectonic shift in the chip industry by enabling our customers to create optimized systems of chips by combining 
the best technologies from Intel and the ecosystem. We believe Open System Foundry is a world-class foundry offering, delivered from a 
resilient, secure, and sustainable source of supply and complemented by access to the systems of chips capabilities from Intel. The basic 
foundry offering is advanced process technologies backed by an ecosystem of IP, EDA, and design services, which enable customers to 
design as they would with other foundries. The systems of chips capabilities include advanced packaging technologies, software to 
accelerate bring-up and integration of complex chips, and driving standards that will improve system performance. 
With our IFS accelerator program members and the Arm and Synopsys agreements, we believe we are well on the way to building out a 
world-class foundry offering. With the rise of AI, our advanced packaging business is expected to be another unique advantage for Intel. 
Chips created with us or other foundries can be packaged using Intel's advanced packaging technologies, including 2D and 2.5D/3D 
solutions designed to enable large, highly scalable packages at competitive costs. We continue to drive technologies, capabilities, and 
standards needed to optimize systems of chips, including the Universal Chiplet Interconnect Express* standard for communication 
between chips in a system, which was demonstrated in silicon in 2023. We accelerate our customers' designs by providing services and 
software that leverage Intel's vast experience as a systems company. 
Our competitors are mostly pure-play foundries that focus on delivering a pure-play foundry offering from fabrication plants based 
primarily in Asia. Of the five major semiconductor foundries, TSMC, Samsung, Global Foundries (GF), United Microelectronics 
Corporation (UMC), and Semiconductor Manufacturing International Corporation (SMIC), only Samsung is an IDM and foundry, and only 
GF is headquartered in the US. TSMC leads the market with 59% market share, followed by Samsung at 16% in 20221. Neither Samsung 
nor TSMC currently offers its most advanced nodes outside of Asia and both have limited advanced node capacity in the US. 
We believe the Open System Foundry model delivers differentiated capabilities to help our customers lead in their industries while 
bringing stability to the global semiconductor supply chain. The momentum and customer commitments we are seeing demonstrate that 
our strategy and offerings are resonating, and we look to build on this success in 2024 and in future periods.

2023 vs. 2022
2023 revenue was $54.2 billion, down $8.8 billion, or 14%, from 2022. CCG revenue decreased 8% from 2022 primarily due to lower 
notebook and desktop volume driven by lower demand across market segments, partially offset by increased volume in the second half of 
the year as customer inventory levels normalized compared to higher levels in the first half. Notebook ASPs decreased due to the relative 
strength in the education market segment resulting in a higher mix of small core products combined with a higher mix of older generation 
products, and were partially offset by higher desktop ASPs due to an increased mix of product sales to the commercial and gaming 
market segments. DCAI revenue decreased 20% from 2022 due to lower server volume resulting from a softening CPU data center 
market, which was partially offset by higher server ASPs from a lower mix of hyperscale customer-related revenue and a higher mix of 
high core count products. NEX revenue decreased 31% from 2022 as customers tempered purchases to reduce existing inventories and 
adjust to a lower demand environment across product lines.
Incentives offered to certain customers to accelerate purchases and to strategically position our products with customers for market 
segment share purposes, contributed approximately $700 million to our revenue during Q4 2023, the impacts of which were contemplated 
in our financial guidance for Q1 2024, as included in our Form 8-K dated January 25, 2024.
2022 vs. 2021
2022 revenue was $63.1 billion, down $16.0 billion, or 20%, from 2021. CCG revenue was down 23% from 2021 due to lower notebook 
and desktop volume in the consumer and education market segments, and lower revenue due to the continued ramp down from the exit 
of our 5G smartphone modem business and lower demand for our wireless and connectivity products. Notebook volume decreased, 
driven by lower demand in the consumer and education market segments, while ASPs increased due to the resulting product mix. 
Desktop volume decreased, driven by lower demand in the consumer and education market segments while ASPs increased due to an 
increased mix of commercial products. DCAI revenue decreased 15% from 2021 due to lower server demand from enterprise customers, 
and due to customers tempering purchases to reduce existing inventories in a softening data center market. The decrease was partially 
offset by higher revenue from our FPGA business. Server ASPs decreased due to customer and product mix. NEX revenue increased 
10% from 2021, driven by higher Ethernet ASPs and increased demand for 5G products, partially offset by lower demand for Network 
Xeon. Mobileye revenue increased 35% from 2021, primarily driven by higher demand for EyeQ products and Mobileye Supervision 
systems. The decrease in our "all other" revenue was due to revenue from the divested NAND memory business of $4.3 billion recognized 
in 2021, for which historical results are recorded in “all other,” and $584 million of revenue recognized in 2021 from a prepaid customer 
supply agreement.
Incentives offered to certain customers to accelerate purchases and to strategically position our products with customers for market 
segment share purposes, particularly in CCG, contributed approximately $1.7 billion to our revenue during Q4 2022.

We are making capital investments in furtherance of our IDM 2.0 strategy. As of December 30, 2023, our capital investments classified as 
construction in progress totaled $43.4 billion ($36.7 billion as of December 31, 2022). These assets have not yet been placed into service 
and have not yet begun depreciating. As these construction-in-progress assets are placed into service, we expect to incur depreciation 
expense that impacts future production costs and, ultimately, cost of sales. To the extent we are unable to grow our revenues to offset 
these production costs, our gross margin and operating income will be unfavorably affected. Additionally, we could incur asset 
impairments on property, plant, and equipment assets if our IDM 2.0 strategy is not successful.
Effective January 2023, we increased the estimated useful life of certain production machinery and equipment from 5 to 8 years. When 
compared to the estimated useful life in place as of the end of 2022, we estimate total depreciation expense in 2023 was reduced by 
$4.2 billion. We estimate this change resulted in an approximately $2.5 billion increase to gross margin, $400 million decrease in R&D 
expenses, and $1.3 billion decrease in ending inventory values. These estimates are based on the assets in use and under construction 
as of the beginning of 2023 and are calculated at that point in time. Most of the depreciation expense associated with this useful life 
change is included in overhead cost pools and is combined with other costs and other depreciation expense from assets placed into 
service after this calculation was performed, for which such costs are subsequently absorbed into inventory as each product passes 
through our manufacturing process. As a result, the actual amount of impact from the useful life change that is included in our 2023 
operating results and financial position is impractical to individually and specifically quantify on a year-over-year basis.
Operating Expenses
Total R&D and MG&A expenses for 2023 were $21.7 billion, down 12% compared to 2022. These expenses represent 40.0% of revenue 
for 2023 and 38.9% of revenue for 2022. In support of our strategy, we continue to make significant investments to accelerate our process 
technology roadmap. This requires increased investments in R&D and focused efforts to attract and retain talent. We have implemented 
certain cost-cutting measures while we continue to improve our product execution.

The 2022 Restructuring Program was approved to rebalance our workforce and operations and to create efficiencies and improve our 
product execution in alignment with our strategy. In 2023, activity related to the 2022 Restructuring Program consisted of cash settlements 
of previously accrued employee severance and benefit arrangements, as well as incremental accruals throughout the year and was 
substantially complete as of December 30, 2023. The 2022 Restructuring Plan, in conjunction with other initiatives, reduced our cost 
structure and allowed us to reinvest certain of these cost savings in resources and capacity to develop, manufacture, market, sell, and 
deliver our products in furtherance of our strategy. The cumulative cost of the 2022 Restructuring Program as of December 30, 2023 was 
$1.3 billion.
Litigation charges and other includes a $1.2 billion benefit in 2023 due to a reduction in the previously accrued $2.2 billion charge as a 
result of developments in the VLSI litigation in Q4 2023. 2023 charges also include a $401 million charge for an EC-imposed fine. In 2009, 
we recorded and paid an EC-imposed fine that was subsequently annulled, resulting in a benefit of $1.2 billion in 2022. Also in 2023, we 
mutually agreed with Tower to terminate the acquisition agreement that was entered into during 2022 and, as a result, we paid a $353 
million termination fee to Tower in accordance with the terms of the agreement.

Our effective tax rate decreased in 2023 compared to 2022, primarily driven by our R&D tax credits, which provide a tax benefit based on 
our eligible R&D spending and are not dependent on lower income before taxes, and a higher proportion of our income being taxed in 
non-US jurisdictions. Our benefit from income taxes increased in 2023 compared to 2022 primarily due to a higher proportion of our 
income being taxed in non-US jurisdictions. The 2023 shift in income was attributable to the 2022 tax costs associated with the gains 
recognized from the equity sale of McAfee and the divestiture of our NAND memory business.
Our effective tax rate decreased in 2022 compared to 2021, primarily driven by a higher proportion of our income being taxed in non-US 
jurisdictions and a change in tax law from 2017 Tax Reform related to the capitalization of R&D expenses that went into effect in January 
2022. In 2022 we recognized a benefit from taxes as compared to a provision for taxes in 2021 as the higher proportion of our income 
being taxed in non-US jurisdictions and the change in tax law from 2017 Tax Reform were only partially offset by the tax costs associated 
with the gains recognized from the equity sale of McAfee and the divestiture of our NAND memory business.
In 2021 the OECD announced an Inclusive Framework on Base Erosion and Profit Shifting including Pillar Two Model Rules defining the 
global minimum tax, which calls for the taxation of large multinational corporations at a minimum rate of 15%. Subsequently multiple sets 
of administrative guidance have been issued. Many non-US tax jurisdictions have either recently enacted legislation to adopt certain 
components of the Pillar Two Model Rules beginning in 2024 (including the European Union Member States) with the adoption of 
additional components in later years or announced their plans to enact legislation in future years. We are continuing to evaluate the 
impacts of enacted legislation and pending legislation to enact Pillar Two Model Rules in the non-US tax jurisdictions we operate in.
Liquidity and Capital Resources
We believe we have sufficient sources of funding to meet our business requirements for the next 12 months and in the longer term. Cash 
generated by operations, supplemented by our total cash and investments1, is our primary source of liquidity for funding our strategic 
business requirements. These sources are further supplemented by our committed credit facilities and other borrowing capacity and 
certain other Smart Capital initiatives that we have undertaken. Our short-term funding requirements include capital expenditures for 
worldwide manufacturing and assembly and test, including investments in our process technology roadmap; working capital requirements; 
and potential and pending acquisitions, strategic investments, and dividends. Our long-term funding requirements incrementally 
contemplate investments in significant manufacturing expansion plans and investments to accelerate our process technology. These plans 
include expanding existing operations in Arizona, Ireland, Israel, New Mexico, and Oregon, and investing in new leading-edge 
manufacturing facilities in Germany and Ohio. We also expect to continue to benefit from government incentives and any incentives above 
our current expectations would enable us to increase the pace and size of our investments. Conversely, incentives below our expectations 
would increase our anticipated cash requirements. We expect our planned capital investments to continue to put pressure on our adjusted 
free cash flow in the short term.
As we invest in multiple expansions, we expect our capital expenditures to continue to be higher than historical levels for the next several 
years. We expect to adjust the cadence of our investments based on the execution of our roadmap and changing business conditions. As 
of December 30, 2023, we had commitments for capital expenditures of $20.4 billion for 2024 and had $7.1 billion in capital expenditures 
committed in the long term. As of December 30, 2023, other purchase obligations and commitments in 2024 under our binding 
commitments for purchases of goods and services were $2.7 billion, with an additional $5.6 billion committed in the long term.
We have additional obligations as part of our ordinary course of business, beyond those committed for capital expenditures and other 
purchase obligations and commitments for purchases of goods and services. For example, see "Note 19: Commitments and 
Contingencies" within the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for information about our lease obligations, which include supply 
agreements structured as leases; "Note 8: Income Taxes" within the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for information about our 
tax obligations, including impacts from Tax Reform enacted in 2017 for the one-time transition tax on previously untaxed foreign earnings; 
and "Note 13: Borrowings" within the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for information about our debt obligations. The expected 
timing of payments of our obligations is estimated based on current information. Timing of payments and actual amounts paid may be 
different, depending on the timing of receipt of goods or services, or changes to agreed-upon amounts for some obligations. In addition, 
some of our purchasing requirements are not current obligations and are therefore not included in the amounts above. For example, some 
of these requirements are not handled through binding contracts or are fulfilled by vendors on a purchase order basis within short time 
horizons.

We maintain a diverse investment portfolio that we continually analyze based on issuer, industry, and country. Substantially all of our 
investments in debt instruments are in investment-grade securities. 
Our sources of liquidity in 2023 included $1.5 billion from partner contributions, net proceeds of $1.6 billion from a secondary offering of 
Mobileye Class A common stock, $1.4 billion of cash proceeds from the sale of minority stakes in our IMS business to both Bain Capital 
and TSMC, and government incentives of $1.0 billion. Other potential sources of liquidity include our commercial paper program and our 
automatic shelf registration statement on file with the SEC, pursuant to which we may offer an unspecified amount of debt, equity, other 
securities, and non-recourse factoring arrangements with third-party financial institutions. Under our commercial paper program, we have 
an ongoing authorization from our Board of Directors to borrow up to $10.0 billion and, as of December 30, 2023, we had no commercial 
paper obligations outstanding. During 2023, we issued a total of $11.0 billion aggregate principal amount of senior notes for general 
corporate purposes, including, but not limited to, refinancing our outstanding debt and funding for working capital and capital 
expenditures. We also amended both our five-year $5.0 billion variable-rate revolving credit facility agreement, extending that maturity 
date by one year to March 2028, and our 364-day $5.0 billion credit facility agreement, extending the maturity date to March 2024. As of 
December 30, 2023, we had no borrowings outstanding on the revolving credit facilities.
In Q1 2023, we declared a reduced quarterly dividend on our common stock. This dividend reduction reflects our deliberate approach to 
capital allocation, is expected to support the critical investments needed to execute our business strategy, and is designed to position us 
to create long-term value. In January 2024, our Board of Directors declared a quarterly dividend of $0.125 per share on the company's 
common stock, which will be payable on March 1, 2024 to stockholders of record as of February 7, 2024. Future declarations of dividends 
and the establishment of future record and payment dates are subject to the final determination of our Board of Directors.
Our cash and investments and related cash flows may be affected by certain discretionary actions we may take with customers and 
suppliers to accelerate or delay certain cash receipts or payments to manage liquidity, among other factors, for our strategic business 
requirements. In 2023 these actions included, among others, negotiating with suppliers to optimize our payment terms and conditions, 
adjusting the amounts and timing of cash flows associated with customer sales programs and collections, managing inventory levels and 
purchasing practices, and selling certain of our accounts receivable on a non-recourse basis to third-party financial institutions. While such 
actions have benefited, and may further benefit, cash flow in the near term, we may experience a corresponding detriment to cash flow in 
future periods as these actions cease or as the impacts of these actions reverse or normalize. 
Our cash flows for each period were as follows:

Operating Activities
Cash provided by operating activities is net income adjusted for certain non-cash items and changes in assets and liabilities.
For 2023 compared to 2022, the $4.0 billion decrease in cash provided by operating activities was primarily driven by lower 2023 net 
income after adjusting for non-cash items, partially offset by 2023 cash-favorable working capital changes compared to 2022.
For 2022 compared to 2021, the $14.0 billion decrease in cash provided by operating activities was primarily driven by lower 2022 net 
income after adjusting for non-cash items, including the gain on the sale of McAfee and the pre-tax gain from the divestiture of our NAND 
business, partially offset by 2022 cash-favorable working capital changes compared to 2021.
MD&A

Investing Activities
Investing cash flows consist primarily of capital expenditures; investment purchases, sales, maturities, and disposals; proceeds from 
capital-related government incentives; and proceeds from divestitures. Our capital expenditures were $25.8 billion in 2023 ($24.8 billion in 
2022 and $18.7 billion in 2021). 
The increase in cash used for investing activities in 2023 compared to 2022 was primarily due to a lack of proceeds from the divestiture of 
our NAND business and from the sale of our remaining McAfee share that occurred in 2022, lower maturities and sales of short-term 
investments, and increased capital expenditures. These unfavorable cash flow impacts during 2023 were partially offset by higher 2023 
proceeds from capital-related government incentives and by other cash favorable investment activities, including lower acquisitions during 
2023.
The decrease in cash used for investing activities in 2022 compared to 2021 was primarily due to increased maturities and sales of short-
term investments, proceeds from the divestiture of our NAND business, and proceeds from the sale of our remaining share of McAfee, 
partially offset by an increase in capital expenditures.
Financing Activities
Financing cash flows consist primarily of payment of dividends to stockholders, issuance and repayment of short-term and long-term debt, 
and proceeds from partner contributions and equity-related issuances.
The increase in cash provided by financing activities in 2023 compared to 2022 was primarily due to higher debt issuances along with 
lower repayment of long-term debt, decreased dividend payments to stockholders, and increased proceeds from sales of subsidiary 
shares, partially offset by commercial paper issuances in 2022 that were subsequently repaid in 2023. Our total dividend payments were 
$3.1 billion in 2023, compared to $6.0 billion in 2022. We have paid a cash dividend in each of the past 125 quarters. 
Cash provided by financing activities in 2022 compared to cash used for financing activities in 2021 was primarily due to higher 
commercial paper and debt issuances, our 2022 curtailment of common stock repurchases, proceeds from the Mobileye IPO, and partner 
contributions for joint investments, partially offset by higher 2022 debt repayments. 
Critical Accounting Estimates
The methods, assumptions, and estimates that we use in applying our accounting policies may require us to apply judgments regarding 
matters that are inherently uncertain. We consider an accounting policy to be a critical estimate if: (1) we must make assumptions that are 
uncertain when the judgment is made, and (2) changes in the estimate assumptions, or selection of a different estimate methodology, 
could have a significant impact on our financial position and the results that we report in our Consolidated Financial Statements. While we 
believe that our estimates, assumptions, and judgments are reasonable, they are based on information available when the estimate was 
made.
Refer to "Note 2: Accounting Policies" within the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further information on our critical 
accounting estimates, which are as follows, as well as our significant accounting policies:
▪
Inventories—the transition of manufacturing costs to inventory, net of factory excess capacity costs. Inventory reflected at the lower of 
cost or net realizable value considering forecasted future demand and market conditions; 
▪
Long-lived assets—the valuation methods and assumptions used in assessing the impairment and evaluation of useful lives of 
property, plant, and equipment; identified intangibles; and impairment of goodwill, including the determination of asset groupings and 
the identification and allocation of goodwill to reporting units; and
▪
Loss contingencies—the estimation of when a loss is probable and reasonably estimable.

Non-GAAP Financial Measures
In addition to disclosing financial results in accordance with US GAAP, this document contains references to the non-GAAP financial 
measures below. We believe these non-GAAP financial measures provide investors with useful supplemental information about our 
operating performance, enable comparison of financial trends and results between periods where certain items may vary independent of 
business performance, and allow for greater transparency with respect to key metrics used by management in operating our business and 
measuring our performance. These non-GAAP financial measures are used in our performance-based RSUs and our cash bonus plans.
Our non-GAAP financial measures reflect adjustments based on one or more of the following items, as well as the related income tax 
effects. Beginning in 2023, income tax effects are calculated using a fixed long-term projected tax rate of 13% across all adjustments. We 
project this long-term non-GAAP tax rate on an annual basis using a five-year non-GAAP financial projection that excludes the income tax 
effects of each adjustment. The projected non-GAAP tax rate also considers factors such as our tax structure, our tax positions in various 
jurisdictions, and key legislation in significant jurisdictions where we operate. This long-term non-GAAP tax rate may be subject to change 
for a variety of reasons, including the rapidly evolving global tax environment, significant changes in our geographic earnings mix, or 
changes to our strategy or business operations. Management uses this non-GAAP tax rate in managing internal short- and long-term 
operating plans and in evaluating our performance; we believe this approach facilitates comparison of our operating results and provides 
useful evaluation of our current operating performance. Prior-period non-GAAP financial measures have been retroactively adjusted to 
reflect this updated approach.
Our non-GAAP financial measures should not be considered a substitute for, or superior to, financial measures calculated in accordance 
with US GAAP, and the financial results calculated in accordance with US GAAP and reconciliations from these results should be carefully 
evaluated.
NAND memory 
business
We completed the first closing of the divestiture of 
our NAND memory business to SK hynix on 
December 29, 2021 and fully deconsolidated our 
ongoing interests in the NAND OpCo Business in 
Q1 2022.
We exclude the impact of our NAND memory business in 
certain non-GAAP measures. While the second closing 
of the sale is still pending and subject to closing 
conditions, we deconsolidated this business in Q1 2022 
and management does not view the historical results of 
the business as a part of our core operations. We believe 
these adjustments provide investors with a useful view, 
through the eyes of management, of our core business 
model and how management currently evaluates core 
operational performance. In making these adjustments, 
we have not made any changes to our methods for 
measuring and calculating revenue or other financial 
statement amounts.
Acquisition-related 
adjustments
Amortization of acquisition-related intangible assets 
consists of amortization of intangible assets such as 
developed technology, brands, and customer 
relationships acquired in connection with business 
combinations. Charges related to the amortization of 
these intangibles are recorded within both cost of sales 
and MG&A in our US GAAP financial statements. 
Amortization charges are recorded over the estimated 
useful life of the related acquired intangible asset, and 
thus are generally recorded over multiple years.
We exclude amortization charges for our acquisition-
related intangible assets for purposes of calculating 
certain non-GAAP measures because these charges are 
inconsistent in size and are significantly impacted by the 
timing and valuation of our acquisitions. These 
adjustments facilitate a useful evaluation of our current 
operating performance and comparison to our past 
operating performance and provide investors with 
additional means to evaluate cost and expense trends.
Share-based 
compensation
Share-based compensation consists of charges related 
to our employee equity incentive plans.
We exclude charges related to share-based 
compensation for purposes of calculating certain non-
GAAP measures because we believe these adjustments 
provide better comparability to peer company results and 
because these charges are not viewed by management 
as part of our core operating performance. We believe 
these adjustments provide investors with a useful view, 
through the eyes of management, of our core business 
model, how management currently evaluates core 
operational performance, and additional means to 
evaluate expense trends, including in comparison to 
other peer companies.

Patent settlement
A portion of the charge from our IP settlements 
represents a catch-up of cumulative amortization that 
would have been incurred for the right to use the 
related patents in prior periods. This charge related to 
prior periods is excluded from our non-GAAP results; 
amortization related to the right to use the patents in 
the current and ongoing periods is included.
We exclude the catch-up charge related to prior periods 
for purposes of calculating certain non-GAAP measures 
because this adjustment facilitates comparison to past 
operating results and provides a useful evaluation of our 
current operating performance.
Optane inventory 
impairment
A charge in 2022 as we initiated the wind-down of our 
Intel Optane memory business.
We exclude these impairments for purposes of 
calculating certain non-GAAP measures because 
these charges do not reflect our current operating 
performance. This adjustment facilitates a useful 
evaluation of our current operating performance and 
comparisons to past operating results.
Restructuring and 
other charges
Restructuring charges are costs associated with a formal 
restructuring plan and are primarily related to employee 
severance and benefit arrangements. Other charges may 
include periodic goodwill and asset impairments, certain 
pension charges, and costs associated with restructuring 
activity. 2023 includes a benefit as a result of 
developments in the VLSI litigation in Q4 2023, an EC-
imposed fine, and a fee related to the termination of our 
agreement to acquire Tower. 2022 includes a benefit 
related to the annulled EC fine and 2021 includes a 
charge related to the VLSI litigation. 
We exclude restructuring and other charges, including 
any adjustments to charges recorded in prior periods, for 
purposes of calculating certain non-GAAP measures 
because these costs do not reflect our core operating 
performance. These adjustments facilitate a useful 
evaluation of our core operating performance and 
comparisons to past operating results and provide 
investors with additional means to evaluate expense 
trends.
(Gains) losses on 
equity 
investments, net
(Gains) losses on equity investments, net consists of 
ongoing mark-to-market adjustments on marketable 
equity securities, observable price adjustments on non-
marketable equity securities, related impairment charges, 
and the sale of equity investments and other.
We exclude these non-operating gains and losses for 
purposes of calculating certain non-GAAP measures 
because it provides better comparability between 
periods. The exclusion reflects how management 
evaluates the core operations of the business.
(Gains) losses 
from divestiture
(Gains) losses are recognized at the close of a 
divestiture, or over a specified deferral period when 
deferred consideration is received at the time of closing. 
Based on our ongoing obligation under the NAND wafer 
manufacturing and sale agreement entered into in 
connection with the first closing of the sale of our NAND 
memory business on December 29, 2021, a portion of 
the initial closing consideration was deferred and will be 
recognized between first and second closing.
We exclude gains or losses resulting from divestitures for 
purposes of calculating certain non-GAAP measures 
because they do not reflect our current operating 
performance. These adjustments facilitate a useful 
evaluation of our current operating performance and 
comparisons to past operating results.
Adjusted free cash 
flow
We reference a non-GAAP financial measure of adjusted 
free cash flow, which is used by management when 
assessing our sources of liquidity, capital resources, and 
quality of earnings. Adjusted free cash flow is operating 
cash flow adjusted for (1) additions to property, plant, and 
equipment, net of proceeds from capital-related 
government incentives and partner contributions, (2) 
payments on finance leases, and (3) proceeds from the 
McAfee equity sale in 2022.
This non-GAAP financial measure is helpful in 
understanding our capital requirements and sources of 
liquidity by providing an additional means to evaluate the 
cash flow trends of our business. Since the 2017 
divestiture, McAfee equity distributions and sales 
contributed to prior operating and free cash flow, and 
while the McAfee equity sale in Q1 2022 would have 
typically been excluded from adjusted free cash flow as 
an equity sale, we believe including the sale proceeds in 
adjusted free cash flow facilitate a better, more consistent 
comparison to current and past presentations of liquidity.
Total cash and 
investments
Total cash and investments is used by management 
when assessing our sources of liquidity, which include 
cash and cash equivalents, short-term investments, and 
loans receivable and other.
This non-GAAP measure is helpful in understanding our 
capital resources and liquidity position.

Risk Factors and Other Key Information
Risk Factors
The following summarizes the material factors that make an investment in our securities speculative or risky. When any one or more of the 
following risks materialize from time to time, our business, reputation, financial condition, cash flows, and results of operations can be 
materially and adversely affected, and the trading price of our common stock could decline. These risk factors do not identify all risks that 
we face; our operations can also be affected by factors that are not presently known to us or that we currently consider to be immaterial to 
our operations, or by various risks that are generally applicable to most companies. Due to risks and uncertainties, known and unknown, 
our past financial results may not be a reliable indicator of future performance, and historical trends should not be used to anticipate 
results or trends in future periods. Refer also to the other information set forth in this Form 10-K, including in the MD&A and Financial 
Statements and Supplemental Details sections.
We are in a highly competitive and rapidly changing industry.
The industry in which we operate is highly competitive and subject to rapid technological, geopolitical, and market developments; changes 
in industry standards; changes in customer and end-user needs, expectations, and preferences; and frequent product introductions and 
improvements. When we do not anticipate or respond to these developments, our competitive position can weaken, and our products or 
technologies can become uncompetitive or obsolete. Our competitive environment has intensified in recent years, and we expect it to 
continue to do so in the future. If we are not able to compete effectively, or if our foundry strategy is unsuccessful, our financial results will 
be adversely affected, including through reduced revenue and gross margin, and we may be required to accelerate the write-down of the 
value of certain assets.
We face intense competition across our product portfolio. Our competitors include companies offering platform products, such as AMD 
and Qualcomm; accelerator products such as GPUs, including those offered by NVIDIA; other accelerator products such as ASICs, 
application-specific standard products, and FPGAs; memory and storage products; connectivity and networking products; and other 
semiconductor products. Some of these competitors have developed or utilize competing computing architectures and platforms, such as 
the ARM architecture*, and these architectures and platforms can produce beneficial network effects for competitors when an ecosystem 
of customers and application developers for such architectures and platforms grows at scale. For example, ARM-based products are 
being used in PCs and servers, which could lead to further development and growth of the ARM ecosystem. We also compete with 
internally developed semiconductors from OEMs, cloud service providers, and others, some of whom are customers. Some of these 
customers vertically integrate their own semiconductor designs with their software assets and/or customize their designs for specific 
computing workloads. For example, in 2020, Apple introduced PC products utilizing its own internally developed ARM-based 
semiconductor designs in place of our client CPUs, and we face increasing competition from Apple's products and ecosystem.
Most of our competitors rely on third-party foundries, such as TSMC or Samsung, for the manufacture and assembly and test of their 
semiconductor components and products. Manufacturing process and assembly and test improvements introduced by such foundries 
have contributed, and may continue to contribute, to increasingly competitive offerings by our competitors. Our process technology 
roadmap to regain transistor performance and power performance leadership by 2025 is subject to a number of risks, and we could fail to 
realize our goals, including due to changes in competitor technology roadmaps, changes affecting our projections regarding our 
technology or competing technology, and the risks described in the risk factor "The development and implementation of new 
semiconductor products and manufacturing technologies are subject to many risks and uncertainties." As an IDM, we have higher capital 
expenditures and R&D spending than many of our fabless competitors due to the high ongoing investments required to maintain leading-
edge process technology and manufacturing capacity. We also face new sources of competition as a result of changes in industry 
participants through, for example, acquisitions or business collaborations, as well as new entrants, including in China, which could have a 
significant impact on our competitive position. For example, we could face increased competition as a result of China's programs to 
promote a domestic semiconductor industry and supply chains.
Our products compete based on a number of factors, including performance, energy efficiency, ease-of-integration, ease-of-use, 
innovative design, features, workload optimization, price, quality, reliability, security, software ecosystem and developer support, time-to-
market, reliable product roadmap execution, brand recognition, customer support and customization, and availability. The importance of 
these factors varies by product and market segment. To the extent our products do not meet our customers' requirements across these 
factors in an increasingly competitive landscape, our business and results of operations can be harmed. Introduction of competitive new 
products and technologies, aggressive pricing, and other actions taken by competitors can harm demand for our products, exert 
downward pricing pressure on our products, and adversely affect our business. For example, our competitors have introduced data center 
and client platform products with performance improvements and additional processor core counts that have contributed to an 
increasingly competitive environment. Further, our DCAI revenue, platform ASPs and market share were negatively impacted by the 
competitive environment and the shift of customer spend towards GPUs during the past few years. Additionally, a number of business 
combinations and strategic partnerships in the semiconductor industry have occurred in recent years, and more could occur in the future. 
Consolidation could also lead to fewer customers, partners, or suppliers, any of which could negatively affect our financial results.

We have limited experience in the highly competitive and capital-intensive third-party foundry business. As we pursue our strategy to 
establish IFS as a major provider of foundry capacity to manufacture semiconductors for others, we will face intense competition from 
well-established competitors such as TSMC, Samsung, Global Foundries (GF), United Microelectronics Corporation (UMC), and 
Semiconductor Manufacturing International Corporation (SMIC). To succeed, we will need to compete effectively across factors such as 
availability and time-to-market of manufacturing technology; advances in manufacturing processes in areas such as performance, 
performance per watt, and density; multi-chip packaging; system integration; manufacturing capacity; price; margin; ease of use; quality; 
yields; customer satisfaction; and ecosystem support. Building and maintaining a competitive foundry business requires high ongoing 
investments to maintain leading-edge process technology and manufacturing capacity, which investments in many instances must be 
made ahead of customer commitments and may not be recouped. Moreover, many of the largest potential IFS customers are fabless 
semiconductor companies whose products compete with our own. As a result, our strategy requires us to overcome customer concerns 
regarding protection of confidentiality information, intellectual property, and foundry capacity, among other competitive concerns, to attract 
and retain such customers. Our limited third-party foundry experience also means we must continue to hire and retain talented employees 
with relevant foundry experience with respect to both leading-edge and legacy nodes. Our efforts may be hindered by the higher costs of, 
regulatory and environmental restrictions imposed upon, and time it takes to build fabrication and assembly and test facilities in the 
jurisdictions in which we operate and plan to build new or upgrade existing foundry facilities as compared to the jurisdictions in which our 
competitors predominantly operate their foundry facilities. Our construction projects to expand capacity require available sources of labor, 
materials, and equipment. Increasing demand for such sources, including from other foundries; supply constraints, labor shortages, and 
other adverse market conditions; issues with permits or approvals; on-site incidents; and other construction issues arise from time to time 
and can result in significant delays and increased costs for our projects, as well as legal and reputational harm. These significant hurdles 
to our foundry strategy make it highly risky and our success highly uncertain. 
We are making significant, long-term and inherently risky investments in R&D and manufacturing 
facilities that may not realize a favorable return.
To compete successfully, we must maintain an effective R&D program, develop new products and manufacturing processes, improve our 
products and processes, and make significant capital investments in new and existing manufacturing facilities, all ahead of competitors 
and market demand. The R&D efforts and capital investments we require are intensive as we compete across both product and process 
technologies. We incurred R&D expenses of $16.0 billion in 2023, $17.5 billion in 2022, and $15.2 billion in 2021. We are focusing our 
R&D efforts across several key areas, including process and packaging technology, our xPU products and features, AI, and software. 
These include ambitious initiatives, such as our efforts to introduce five new manufacturing process technologies, or nodes, in four years 
and our unified oneAPI portfolio of developer tools. Our investments are typically long-term and, even where successful, often do not 
contribute to our operating results for a number of years. We cannot guarantee that our efforts will deliver the benefits we anticipate, 
including as a result of our new products or technologies falling short of expectations or the offerings of competitors. For example, we 
previously experienced significant delays in the implementation of our 10nm process technology, and during 2020, we announced that our 
then 7nm process technology would be delayed relative to our prior expectations. In such instances where we do not timely introduce new 
manufacturing process technologies that improve performance, performance per watt, transistor density, die utilization, core counts, and/
or new features such as optimizations for AI and other workloads, with sufficient manufacturing yields and operational efficiency, relative to 
competing foundry processes, we have faced and will face cost, product performance, and time-to-market disadvantages relative to our 
competitors and adverse impacts to our financial condition as a result of higher operating costs, including as a result of additional costs 
from unused manufacturing capacity, higher leverage and borrowing costs, and pressure on our credit ratings. Further, we are not always 
able to timely or successfully develop new products, including as a result of bugs, late changes to features due to customer requests, or 
other design challenges. For example, in 2022, we announced that the release of Intel's 4th Gen Intel Xeon Scalable processor would be 
delayed from the first half of 2022 to the second half of 2022. To the extent our R&D efforts do not develop new products on schedule with 
improvements in areas like performance, performance per watt, die utilization, and core counts, and/or with new features such as 
optimizations for AI and other workloads, our competitive position can be harmed. We have adopted a disaggregated design approach for 
some of our future products, in which different processors and components can be manufactured on different processes and connected 
by advanced packaging technology into a single package. This approach introduces new areas of complexity in design and 
manufacturability, particularly in the deployment of advanced packaging technologies, several of which are novel, have a limited 
manufacturing history, and/or have increased costs. Delays or failures in implementing disaggregated designs could adversely affect our 
ability to timely introduce competitive products. For example, adapting a processor or component design for a new or different 
manufacturing process involves additional R&D expense and can result in delays in the development of the associated product and higher 
costs due to the utilization of more advanced and expensive capital equipment.

The investments required for our process technology roadmap and our worldwide manufacturing and assembly and test require capital 
expenditures above our historical levels. In recent years, the semiconductor manufacturing industry has seen very significant increases in 
the capital investments required for manufacturing facilities utilizing leading process technologies, including as a result of the use of EUV 
photolithography tools. Our ownership and operation of such high-tech fabrication facilities, and our need to build new and expand 
existing facilities in anticipation of future demand, has resulted and will continue to result in our incurring large capital outlays and high 
costs that are fixed or difficult to reduce in the short term. Such capital outlays and costs include those related to utilization of existing 
facilities, facility construction and equipment, R&D, and the employment and training of a highly skilled workforce. To the extent customers 
are unwilling to pay prices to access the features that our process and product investments are expected to deliver or demand for our 
products, foundry capacity and assembly and test capacity decreases or we fail to forecast demand accurately, our gross margin and 
operating income can be disproportionately affected due to our high fixed cost structure, which is difficult to reduce quickly in response to 
lower demand and other unfavorable market factors. We could also be required to write off inventory or record excess manufacturing 
capacity charges, which would also lower our gross margin and operating income. To the extent the demand decrease is prolonged, our 
manufacturing or assembly and test capacity could be underutilized, and we may be required to write down our long-lived assets, which 
would increase our expenses. We may also be required to shorten the useful lives of under-used facilities and equipment and accelerate 
depreciation. As we continue to make substantial investments in increasing our manufacturing capacity as part of our IDM 2.0 strategy, 
these underutilization risks may be heightened. Conversely, at times, demand may increase or we may fail to forecast accurately or 
produce the mix of products demanded. To the extent we are unable to add capacity or increase production fast enough, we are at times 
required to make production decisions and/or are unable to fully meet market demand, which can result in a loss of revenue opportunities 
or market share, legal claims, and/or damage to customer relationships.
The development and implementation of new semiconductor products and manufacturing technologies 
are subject to many risks and uncertainties.
We are continually engaged in the development of next-generation technologies. Forecasting our progress and schedule for developing 
advanced nodes and other technologies is challenging, and at times we encounter unexpected delays due to the complexity of 
interactions among steps in the manufacturing process, challenges in using new materials or new production equipment, and other 
issues. Diagnosing defects in our manufacturing processes often takes a long time, as manufacturing throughput times can delay our 
receipt of data about defects and the effectiveness of fixes, and defects can be more serious and difficult to resolve than initially 
anticipated. 
We are not always successful or efficient in developing or implementing new process nodes and manufacturing processes. We 
experienced significant delays in implementing our 10nm process technology, and in 2020, we encountered a defect mode in the 
development of our then 7nm process technology that resulted in delays relative to our prior expectations. In 2022, Intel's 4th Gen Intel 
Xeon Scalable processor was delayed to allow for more platform and product validation time. These delays have allowed competitors 
using third-party foundries, such as TSMC, to benefit from advancements in manufacturing processes introduced ahead of us, including 
improvements in performance, energy efficiency, and other features, which have helped increase the competitiveness of their products. 
Because of these prior delays in our process technologies, we may experience greater adverse competitive impacts in the event of delays 
in the development of future manufacturing process technologies and products. 
Our efforts to innovate involve significant expense and carry inherent risks, including difficulties in designing and developing next-
generation process and packaging technologies, and investments in manufacturing assets and facilities that are made years in advance. 
We cannot guarantee that we will realize the expected benefits of next-generation process technologies, including the expected cost, 
performance, power, and density advantages, or that we will achieve an adequate return on our capital and R&D investments, particularly 
as the development of new nodes has grown increasingly expensive. In such circumstances, we may be required to write down the value 
of some of our manufacturing assets and facilities, increasing our expenses.
Risks inherent in the development of next-generation process technologies include production timing delays, lower-than-anticipated 
manufacturing yields, longer manufacturing throughput times, failure to achieve expected performance, power, and area improvements, 
and product defects and errata (deviations from published specifications). Production timing delays have at times caused us to miss 
customer product design windows, which can result in lost revenue opportunities and damage to our customer relationships. Furthermore, 
when the introduction of next-generation process nodes is delayed, adding cores or other competitive features to our products can result 
in larger die size products, manufacturing supply constraints, and increased product costs. Lower manufacturing yields and longer 
manufacturing throughput times, compared to previous process nodes, can increase our product costs, adversely affect our gross 
margins, and contribute to manufacturing supply constraints. A new process node typically has higher costs compared to a mature node 
due to factors that include higher depreciation costs and lower yields, and costs and yields at times do not improve at the same rate as on 
prior nodes. As the die size of our products has increased and our manufacturing process nodes have shrunk, our products and 
manufacturing processes have grown increasingly complex and more susceptible to product defects and errata, which at times also 
contribute to production timing delays and lower yields that may also increase our costs to manufacture and warranty our products.
Our disaggregated design strategy poses increased logistical risks and challenges, particularly where we decide to manufacture different 
product components on different process technologies, including third-party foundries' process technologies. To combine components in a 
single package, they need to be manufactured on a timely basis and in sufficient quantities, while the manufacturing processes we utilize 
may have differing yields, throughput times, and capacity constraints. We may be required to safely store some components pending the 
manufacture of others. Delays or quality issues with one component could limit our ability to manufacture the entire completed product. In 
addition, the packaging technologies used to combine these components can increase our costs and may introduce additional complexity 
and quality issues. To the extent we are unable to manage these risks, our ability to timely supply competitive products can be harmed 
and our costs could increase.
Risk Factors and Other Key Information
50


From time to time, disruptions in the production process result from errors; defects in materials; delays in obtaining or revising permits and 
licenses; interruptions in our supply of materials, resources, or production equipment; adverse changes in equipment productivity; and 
disruptions at our fabrication and assembly and test facilities due to accidents, maintenance issues, power interruptions, equipment 
malfunctions, or unsafe working conditions—all of which could affect the timing of production ramps and yields and could result in 
production timing delays. Production issues periodically lead to increased costs and affect our ability to meet product demand, which can 
adversely impact our business and the results of operations.
Our implementation of new business strategies and investments in new businesses, products, and 
technologies are inherently risky and do not always succeed.
Our IDM 2.0 strategy requires implementation of new business strategies, as well as many internal structural, systems and process 
changes. We have entered new businesses and introduced new products and services as we seek to capitalize on the opportunities 
presented by growth in semiconductor demand, ubiquitous compute, pervasive connectivity, cloud to edge infrastructure, AI, and sensing. 
In recent years, we have expanded our product offerings in areas such as discrete GPUs, mobility solutions, AI accelerators, IPU 
products, and silicon photonics. As part of our IDM 2.0 strategy, we announced plans to establish IFS as a major provider of foundry 
capacity to manufacture semiconductors for others and to implement an internal foundry operating model through updates to our 
processes, systems, and guardrails between our manufacturing and our individual product-based business units. The implementation of 
our internal foundry operating model requires many internal structural, system, and process changes to support the separation of the 
product and manufacturing sides of our business and our external foundry business, including a new ERP system. In parallel, we are 
undertaking significant efforts to separate out portions of our business, such as PSG and IMS, to raise capital and unlock value as we 
focus on our core product and manufacturing capabilities. Significant business changes are inherently risky and are not always 
successful. For example, in 2022, we wound down Intel Optane; in 2020, we agreed to sell our NAND memory business to SK hynix; and 
in 2019, we exited the 5G smartphone modem business based on our determination that there was no clear path to profitability for those 
businesses. 
These new and developing areas and products represent a significant portion of our revenue growth opportunity, and they also introduce 
new sources of competition, including, in some cases, incumbent competitors with established technologies, ecosystems, and customer 
bases, lower prices, margins, or costs, and greater brand recognition. These developing products and market segments require significant 
investment, do not always grow as projected or at all, or sometimes adopt competing technologies, and we may not realize an adequate 
return on our investments. For example, AI and machine learning are increasingly driving innovations in technology, but if we fail to 
develop leading products for these workloads, or if our customers use competing technologies, we may not realize a return on our 
investments in these areas. Similarly, we expect intense competition related to the significant opportunity we see in networking 
infrastructure and the distribution of computing to the network edge and may not succeed in our efforts. To be successful, we need to 
cultivate relationships with customers and partners in these market segments and continue to improve our offerings. Despite our ongoing 
efforts, there is no guarantee that we will achieve or maintain market demand or acceptance for our products and services in these 
various market segments or realize an adequate return on our investments, which could lead to impairment of assets and restructuring 
charges, as well as opportunity costs. 
Our Smart Capital approach to capital spending, alternative financing arrangements and pursuit of 
government grants involves risks and may not be successful.
As we pursue our IDM 2.0 strategy, we have utilized our Smart Capital approach to capital spending in an effort to appropriately time and 
scale our capital investments. To support our capital investments, we have pursued alternative financing arrangements, such as our 2022 
joint investment with Brookfield in the manufacturing expansion of our Arizona campus, and expect to enter into similar arrangements in 
the future. These transactions may fail to advance our business strategy, may include unfavorable pricing or other terms, and may fail to 
achieve their anticipated benefits. Our partners may also fail to satisfy financial or other obligations on which we rely and we may fail to 
resolve any potential disputes. Any of these risks, including our ability to effectuate any additional transactions at all, could have a material 
adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition, or cash flows, which may limit our ability to raise sufficient capital 
for our required investments.
In addition, as part of our Smart Capital approach, we have applied for, received, and expect to receive additional grants and incentives 
from domestic and foreign local, regional and national governments. Legislation in the US and EU has been adopted to provide 
government funding for semiconductor manufacturing expansions in those regions, but there is uncertainty as to the amounts and timing 
of funding we may receive and as to the conditions and restrictions that may apply to us as a recipient of such funding. For example, we 
expect to receive substantial grants from the US government under the CHIPS Act to support significant planned new fabrication facilities 
in the US and the German government under the EU Chips Act to support significant planned new fabrication facilities in Germany. 
However, governments may choose not to award grants and incentives in sufficient amounts or in a timely manner to support our capital 
investment plans and to offset the higher costs of operations in many of the locations of our facilities as compared to those of many of our 
competitors, or we may be unable to comply with the requirements and limitations of such grants and incentives. To the extent such 
funding is below our expectations, we elect not to accept any grants or incentives due to burdensome compliance requirements, or we are 
required to return any amounts received from any grants or incentives due to an inability to comply with any requirements or limitations 
contained therein, our anticipated cash requirements would increase.

Changes in product demand can adversely affect our financial results. 
Our products are used in different market segments, and demand for our products varies within or among them. It is difficult to forecast 
these changes and their impact. For example, we expect the PC TAM to grow over time driven by factors such as a larger installed base, 
demand for AI capabilities, new platforms, shorter replacement cycles, and adoption in new markets; however, the PC industry has been 
highly cyclical in the past, and these growth expectations may not materialize, or we may fail to capitalize on them. Changes in the 
demand for our products, particularly our CCG, DCAI, and NEX platform products, have in the past and may in the future reduce our 
revenue, lower our gross margin, or require us to write down the value of our assets.
Important factors that lead to variation in the demand for our products include:
▪
business conditions, including downturns in the market segments in which we operate, or in global or regional economies;
▪
consumer confidence, income levels, and customer capital spending, which can be impacted by changes in market conditions, 
including changes in government borrowing or spending, taxation, interest rates, the credit market, current or expected inflation, 
employment, and energy or other commodity prices;
▪
geopolitical conditions, including trade policies and geopolitical tensions and conflicts;
▪
our ability to timely introduce competitive products; 
▪
competitive and pricing pressures, including new product introductions and other actions taken by competitors;
▪
the level of our customers' inventories and computing capacity;
▪
customer order patterns and order cancellations, including as a result of maturing product cycles for our products, customers' 
products, and related products such as operating system upgrade cycles; and disruptions affecting customers, such as the 
delays in obtaining tools, components, and other supplies as a result of COVID-19-related port shutdowns in China that 
negatively impacted demand for our business in 2022, as well as the industry substrate and component shortages that negatively 
impacted demand across several of our businesses in 2021;
▪
market acceptance and industry support of our products and services, including the introduction and availability of software and 
other products used together with our products, such as software to harness the new AI capabilities of our latest CPUs, as well 
as our foundry services offerings through IFS; and
▪
customer product needs and emerging technology trends, including changes in the levels and nature of customer and end-user 
computing workloads, such as work- and learn-from-home trends.
Our pricing and margins vary across our products and market segments due in part to marketability of our products and differences in 
their features or manufacturing costs. For example, our core product offerings range from lower-priced and entry-level platforms, such as 
those based on Intel Atom processors, to higher-end platforms based on Intel Xeon processors. Our ancillary product offerings that extend 
beyond our core product lines typically have significantly lower margins than our higher-priced products, and at times are not profitable. To 
the extent demand shifts from our higher-priced to lower-priced core products in any of our market segments, or our ancillary products 
represent a greater share of our mix of products sold, our gross margin percentage has decreased and may decrease again.
Macroeconomic conditions and geopolitical tensions and conflicts, including changes to trade policies 
and regulations, present significant risks to us in many jurisdictions.
We have manufacturing, assembly and test, R&D, sales, and other operations in many countries, and some of our business activities are 
concentrated in one or more geographic areas. Our operations rely upon a supply chain that is also highly distributed, and with reliance in 
some instances on supplies or materials available in only one or more geographic areas. Moreover, sales outside the US accounted for 
74% of our revenue for the fiscal year ended December 30, 2023, with revenue from billings to China contributing 27% of our total 
revenue. As a result, our operations and our financial results, including our ability to execute our business strategy, manufacture, 
assemble and test, design, develop, or sell products, and the demand for our products, are at times adversely affected by a number of 
global and regional factors outside of our control.
Adverse changes in global or regional economic conditions periodically occur, including recession or slowing growth; changes or 
uncertainty in fiscal, monetary, or trade policy; higher interest rates; tighter credit; inflation; lower capital expenditures by businesses, 
including on IT infrastructure; increases in unemployment; and lower consumer confidence and spending. Adverse changes in 
macroeconomic conditions can significantly harm demand for our products and make it more challenging to forecast our operating results 
and make business decisions, including regarding prioritization of investments in our business. An economic downturn or increased 
uncertainty may also lead to increased credit and collectability risks, higher borrowing costs or reduced availability of capital and credit 
markets, reduced liquidity, adverse impacts on our suppliers, failures of counterparties, including financial institutions and insurers, asset 
impairments, and declines in the value of our financial instruments. 
Risk Factors and Other Key Information
52


Trade policies and disputes at times result in increased tariffs, trade barriers, and other protectionist measures, which can increase our 
manufacturing costs, make our products less competitive, reduce demand for our products, limit our ability to sell to certain customers, 
limit our ability to procure components or raw materials, or impede or slow the movement of our goods across borders. Increasing 
protectionism and economic nationalism may lead to further changes in trade policies and regulations, domestic sourcing initiatives, or 
other formal and informal measures that could make it more difficult to sell our products in, or restrict our access to, some markets. They 
can also result in declining consumer confidence and slowing economic growth or recession, and could cause our customers to reduce, 
cancel, or alter the timing of their purchases with us. Sustained geopolitical tensions could lead to long-term changes in global trade and 
technology supply chains, domestic sourcing initiatives, and decoupling of global trade networks, which could make it more difficult to sell 
our products in, or restrict our access to, some markets and have a material adverse effect on our business and growth prospects.
In particular, geopolitical and trade tensions between the US and China, one of our largest markets, have led to increased tariffs and trade 
restrictions, including tariffs applicable to some of our products, and have affected customer ordering patterns. Further, the US has 
imposed restrictions on the export of US-regulated products and technology to certain Chinese technology companies, including certain of 
our customers. Specifically, in 2022 the US significantly increased US export controls on semiconductor manufacturing equipment and on 
artificial intelligence and advanced computing products. In 2023, the US added to the restrictions in all three areas and also worked with 
Japan and the Netherlands to align on additional restrictions on semiconductor manufacturing equipment. During this time, the US has 
increasingly added Chinese companies to prohibited lists. In response, China has restricted US access to certain minerals and has 
blocked certain companies that provide products to Taiwan's military from selling products in China. These restrictions have in some 
instances reduced our sales and in a number of instances required specific governmental authorizations or exceptions - $3.2 billion, or 
6%, of our 2023 revenue was dependent upon US government export control authorizations, an amount that we expect may increase in 
future years. These and potential future restrictions could adversely affect our financial performance and result in reputational harm to us. 
In addition, a number of semiconductor companies in China, including Semiconductor Manufacturing International Corporation (SMIC), 
are making significant investments, in many instances with the support of the Chinese government, in advanced semiconductor 
technologies to enable such companies to develop products and technologies that compete with ours. It is difficult to predict what further 
trade-related actions governments may take, the extent to which we may be able to mitigate the effects of any such actions, and the 
longer-term implications of such actions on the market opportunities for us and the competition we may face.
We can also be adversely affected by other global and regional factors that periodically occur, including:
▪
geopolitical and security issues, such as armed conflict and civil or military unrest, political instability, human rights concerns, and 
terrorist activity, including, for example:
▪
Russia’s war with Ukraine, initiated in 2022, which resulted: in the imposition of financial and other sanctions and export 
controls against Russia and Belarus that caused us and other companies to limit or suspend Russian operations (we 
had no exports to Russia in 2023); Russia-imposed currency restrictions and regulations and other retaliatory trade and 
other actions; increased supply, commodity, and other costs; and increased risk of cyberattacks;
▪
tensions and conflict affecting Israel, where we have multiple semiconductor development centers and a leading-edge 
manufacturing facility and where our Mobileye business is headquartered and has most of its operations, and in 
surrounding areas, such as past conflicts in Lebanon and the current conflict in the Red Sea; and
▪
rising tensions between China and Taiwan;
▪
natural disasters, public health issues (including pandemics), and other catastrophic events;
▪
inefficient infrastructure and other disruptions, such as supply chain interruptions, materials shortages or delays, and large-scale 
outages or unreliable provision of services from utilities, transportation, data hosting, or telecommunications providers;
▪
formal or informal imposition of new or revised export, import, or doing-business regulations, including trade sanctions, tariffs, 
and changes in the ability to obtain export licenses, which could be changed without notice;
▪
government restrictions on, or nationalization of, our operations in any country, or restrictions on our ability to repatriate earnings 
from or distribute compensation or other funds in a particular country;
▪
adverse changes relating to government grants, tax credits, or other government incentives, including more favorable incentives 
provided to competitors;
▪
differing employment practices and labor issues, including restricted access to talent;
▪
ineffective legal protection of our IP rights in certain countries;
▪
local business and cultural factors that differ from our current standards and practices;
▪
continuing uncertainty regarding social, political, immigration, and tax and trade policies in the US and abroad; and
▪
fluctuations in the market values of our domestic and international investments, and in the capital and credit markets, which can 
be negatively affected by liquidity, credit deterioration or losses, interest rate changes, financial results, political risk, sovereign 
risk, or other factors.
Risk Factors and Other Key Information

We are subject to numerous risks associated with the evolving market for products with AI capabilities.
The markets and use cases for products with AI capabilities have been rapidly evolving, are difficult to predict and may impact demand for 
our products. For example, in the last few years the demand for high-end GPUs for model training increased dramatically and has 
resulted and may continue to result in a significant shift in DCAI customer spend. The significant investments we have made to develop 
products and software to address what we believe will be increasing demand for AI capabilities may be insufficient, and we face significant 
hurdles, including whether demand will materialize, whether third-party developers will develop the software to utilize the AI capabilities of 
our products, and whether we will be successful in developing products that can compete with offerings by established competitors. 
Our use of AI technology may subject us to reputational, financial, legal, or regulatory risks. As we incorporate AI technology into our 
products and services, any failure to address concerns relating to the responsible use of the evolving AI technology in our products and 
services may cause harm to our reputation or financial liability and, as such, may increase our costs to address or mitigate such risks and 
issues. AI technology may create ethical issues, generate defective algorithms, and present other risks that create challenges with respect 
to its adoption. In addition, evolving rules, regulations, and industry standards governing AI may require us to expend significant resources 
to modify, maintain, or align our business practices or products to comply with US and non-US rules and regulations, the nature of which 
cannot be determined at this time. Several jurisdictions around the globe, including the EU and certain US states, have already proposed 
or enacted laws governing AI. US federal agencies are likely to release AI regulations in the near future in light of the Biden 
administration’s October 30, 2023 Executive Order on AI. The regulatory environment surrounding the impact of the implementation of AI 
on our products and services may adversely affect our ability to produce and export products and as a result may cause harm to our 
reputation and financial liability. 
We rely upon a complex global supply chain.
We have a highly complex global supply chain composed of thousands of suppliers. These suppliers provide direct materials for our 
production processes; supply tools, equipment, and IP (via licenses) for our factories; deliver logistics and packaging services; and supply 
software, lab and office equipment, and other goods and services used in our business. We also rely on suppliers to provide certain 
components for our products and to manufacture and assemble and test some of our components and products. From time to time, we 
are negatively impacted by supply chain issues, including:
▪
suppliers extending lead times, experiencing capacity constraints, limiting or canceling supply, allocating supply to other 
customers including competitors, delaying or canceling deliveries, or increasing prices;
▪
supplier quality issues;
▪
cybersecurity events, IP or other litigation, man-made or natural disasters, public health issues (including pandemics), 
operational failures, or other events that disrupt suppliers;
▪
long lead times to qualify alternate or additional suppliers, or the unavailability of qualified alternate suppliers; and
▪
increased legislation, regulation, or stakeholder expectations regarding responsible sourcing practices, such as heightened 
reporting and other obligations with regard to environmental impacts, the risk of forced labor, or supplier conduct that does not 
meet such standards, which can result in supply chain disruptions, the loss of a supplier, and the government seizure of goods.
These and other supply chain issues can increase our costs, disrupt or reduce our production, delay our product shipments, prevent us 
from meeting customer demand, damage our customer relationships, or negatively affect our reputation. They may keep us from 
successfully implementing our business strategy and can materially harm our business, competitive position, results of operation, and 
financial condition. From time to time, our customers experience disruptions or shortages in their own supply chains that constrain their 
demand for our products. During the past several years, macroeconomic and geopolitical conditions, as well as outbreaks of COVID-19, 
caused supply chain disruptions and delays in obtaining tools and other components, and the semiconductor industry experienced 
widespread shortages of substrates and other components and available foundry manufacturing capacity. These shortages have 
previously limited our ability to supply customer demand in certain of our businesses, and have adversely affected customer demand for 
our products, as some customers have been unable to procure sufficient quantities of third-party components used together with our 
products to produce finished systems. It is difficult to predict the future impact of these shortages when they occur.
To obtain future supply of certain materials and components, particularly substrates, and third-party foundry manufacturing capacity, we 
have entered into arrangements with some of our suppliers that involve long-term purchase commitments and/or large prepayments. 
These arrangements may not be adequate to meet our requirements, or our suppliers may fail to deliver committed volumes on time or at 
all, or their financial condition may deteriorate. If future customer demand over the horizon of such arrangements falls below our 
expectations, we could have excess or obsolete inventory, unneeded capacity, and increased costs, and our prepayments may not be 
fully utilized, and in some cases may not be fully recoverable. 
We utilize third-party foundries and component suppliers to manufacture or supply certain components and products for areas such as 
networking, communications, graphics, programmable semiconductor solutions, and memory. As part of our IDM 2.0 strategy, we expect 
to increase our use of third-party foundries. Delays in the development of foundries’ future manufacturing processes could delay the 
introduction of products or components we design for such processes, and insufficient foundry capacity could prevent us from meeting 
customer demand. We typically have less control over delivery schedules, design and manufacturing co-optimization, yields, quality, 
product quantities, and costs for components and products that are manufactured by third parties. 
Risk Factors and Other Key Information
54


Where possible, we seek to have several sources of supply. However, for certain components, services, materials, and equipment, we 
rely on a single or a limited number of suppliers, or upon suppliers in a single location, which can impact the nature, quality, availability, 
and pricing of the products and services available to us. For example, ASML Holding N.V. (ASML) is currently the sole supplier of EUV 
photolithography tools that we are deploying in our Intel 4 and subsequent manufacturing process nodes. These tools are highly complex 
to develop and produce, and increasingly costly, and from time to time there are increases in lead times or delays in their development 
and availability, which could delay the development or ramp of our future process nodes. As a further example, a limited number of third-
party foundries offer leading-edge manufacturing processes, and these providers are geographically concentrated in Asia. Supplier 
consolidation or business failures can also reduce the pool of qualified suppliers. 
We are subject to the risks of product defects, errata, or other product issues. 
From time to time, we identify product defects, errata, and other product issues, which can result from problems in our product design or 
our manufacturing and assembly and test processes. Components and products we purchase or license from third-party suppliers, or gain 
through acquisitions, can also contain defects. Product issues also sometimes result from the interaction between our products and third-
party products and software. We face risks if products that we design, manufacture, or sell, or that include our technology, cause personal 
injury or property damage, even where the cause is unrelated to product defects or errata. These risks may increase as our products are 
introduced into new devices, market segments, technologies, or applications, including transportation, autonomous driving, healthcare, 
communications, financial services, and other industrial, critical infrastructure, and consumer uses. 
Costs from defects, errata, or other product issues could include:
▪
writing off some or all of the value of inventory;
▪
recalling products that have been shipped;
▪
providing product replacements or modifications;
▪
providing consideration to customers, including reimbursement for certain costs they incur;
▪
defending against litigation and/or paying resulting damages;
▪
paying fines imposed by regulatory agencies; and
▪
reputational harm.
These costs could be large and may increase expenses and lower gross margin, and/or result in delay or loss of revenue. Mitigation 
techniques designed to address product issues, including software and firmware updates, are not always available on a timely basis—or 
at all—and do not always operate as intended or effectively resolve such issues for all applications. We and third parties, such as 
hardware and software vendors, make prioritization decisions about which product issues to address, which can delay, limit, or prevent 
development or deployment of a mitigation and harm our reputation and result in costs. Product defects, errata, or other product issues 
and/or mitigation techniques can result in product failures, adverse performance and power effects, reboots, system instability or 
unavailability, loss of functionality, data loss or corruption, unpredictable system behavior, decisions by customers and end users to limit or 
change the applications in which they use our products or product features, and other issues. Product issues can damage our reputation, 
negatively affect product demand, delay product releases or deployment, result in legal liability, or make our products less competitive, 
which could harm our business and financial results. Subsequent events or new information can develop that change our assessment of 
the impact of a product issue. In addition, our liability insurance coverage has certain exclusions or may not adequately cover liabilities 
incurred. Our insurance providers may be unable or unwilling to pay a claim, and losses not covered by insurance could be large, which 
could harm our financial condition.
We face risks related to security vulnerabilities in our products.
We or third parties regularly identify security vulnerabilities with respect to our processors and other products, as well as the operating 
systems and workloads that run on them and the components that interact with them. Components and IP we purchase or license from 
third parties for use in our products, as well as industry-standard specifications we implement in our products, are also regularly subject to 
security vulnerabilities. Our processors and other products are being used in application areas that create new or increased cybersecurity 
and privacy risks, including applications that gather and process large amounts of data, such as the cloud or Internet of Things, and 
critical infrastructure and automotive applications. The security vulnerabilities identified in our processors include a category known as 
side-channel vulnerabilities, such as the variants referred to as "Spectre" and "Meltdown." Additional categories and variants have been 
identified and are expected to continue to be identified. Publicity about these and other security vulnerabilities has resulted in, and is 
expected to continue to result in, increased attempts by third parties to identify additional vulnerabilities. Security and manageability 
features in our products cannot make our products absolutely secure, and these features themselves are subject to vulnerabilities and 
attempts by third parties to identify additional vulnerabilities. Vulnerabilities are not always mitigated before they become known. We, our 
customers, and the users of our products do not always promptly learn of or have the ability to fully assess the magnitude or effects of a 
vulnerability, including the extent, if any, to which a vulnerability has been exploited. Subsequent events or new information can develop 
that changes our assessment of the impact of a security vulnerability, including additional information learned as we develop and deploy 
mitigations or updates, become aware of additional variants, evaluate the competitiveness of existing and new products, and address 
future warranty or other claims or customer satisfaction considerations, as well as developments in the course of any litigation or 
regulatory inquiries or actions over these matters.
Risk Factors and Other Key Information
55


Mitigation techniques designed to address security vulnerabilities in our products, including software and firmware updates or other 
preventative measures, are not always available on a timely basis—or at all—and at times do not operate as intended or effectively 
resolve vulnerabilities for all applications. In addition, we are often required to rely on third parties, including hardware, software, and 
services vendors, as well as our customers and end users, to develop and/or deploy mitigation techniques, and the availability, 
effectiveness, and performance impact of mitigation techniques can depend solely or in part on the actions of these third parties in 
determining whether, when, and how to develop and deploy mitigations. Export restrictions may impede our ability to provide updates or 
patches to customers in certain geographies or that appear on sanctions lists, potentially leaving systems unpatched and open to 
exploitation. Further, sanctions lists may include third parties with whom we need to interact for coordinated vulnerability disclosure, which 
may impair our ability to receive information about vulnerabilities and to deliver mitigations for them. We and such third parties make 
prioritization decisions about which vulnerabilities to address, which can delay, limit, or prevent development or deployment of a mitigation 
and harm our reputation. Security vulnerabilities and/or mitigation techniques can result in adverse performance or power effects, reboots, 
system instability or unavailability, loss of functionality, data loss or corruption, unpredictable system behavior, decisions by customers and 
end users to limit or change the applications in which they use our products or product features, and/or the misappropriation of data by 
third parties.
Security vulnerabilities and any limitations or adverse effects of mitigation techniques can adversely affect our results of operations, 
financial condition, customer relationships, prospects, and reputation in a number of ways, any of which may be material. For example, 
whether or not vulnerabilities involve attempted or successful exploits, they may result in our incurring significant costs related to 
developing and deploying updates and mitigations, writing down inventory value, defending against product claims and litigation, 
responding to regulatory inquiries or actions, paying damages, addressing customer satisfaction considerations, providing product 
replacements or modifications, or taking other remedial steps with respect to third parties. Adverse publicity about security vulnerabilities 
or mitigations could damage our reputation with customers or users and reduce demand for our products and services. These effects may 
be greater to the extent that competing products are not susceptible to the same vulnerabilities or if vulnerabilities can be more effectively 
mitigated in competing products. Moreover, third parties can release information regarding potential vulnerabilities of our products before 
mitigations are available, which, in turn, could lead to attempted or successful exploits, adversely affect our ability to introduce mitigations, 
or otherwise harm our business and reputation. 
We are subject to increasing and evolving cybersecurity threats and privacy risks.
We face significant and persistent cybersecurity risks due to: the breadth of geographies, networks, and systems we must defend against 
cybersecurity attacks; the complexity, technical sophistication, value, and widespread use of our systems, products and processes; the 
attractiveness of our systems, products and processes to threat actors (including state-sponsored organizations) seeking to inflict harm on 
us or our customers; the substantial level of harm that could occur to us and our customers were we to suffer impacts of a material 
cybersecurity incident; and our use of third-party products, services and components. Such an incident, whether or not successful, could 
result in our incurring significant costs related to, for example, rebuilding our internal systems, writing down inventory value, implementing 
additional threat protection measures, providing modifications to our products and services, defending against litigation or enforcement 
proceedings, paying damages, providing customers with incentives to maintain a business relationship with us, or taking other remedial 
steps with respect to third parties, as well as incurring significant reputational harm. We regularly face attempts by malicious attackers 
who attempt to gain access to our network or data centers or those of our suppliers, customers, partners, end users, or other third parties; 
steal proprietary, personal, or confidential information related to our business, products, employees, suppliers, or customers; introduce 
malicious software to our systems or those of our suppliers, customers, partners, end users, or other third parties; interrupt our systems 
and services or those of our suppliers, customers, or others; or demand ransom to return control of such systems and services. As we 
grow certain emerging business lines, such as our foundry business and our cloud computing and software-as-a-service offerings, we 
expect to collect or host significant amounts of highly sensitive customer data, which may increasingly make us a target of attempts to 
steal or corrupt that data. Individuals and organizations, including malicious hackers, state-sponsored organizations, insider threats 
including employees and third-party service providers, and intruders into our physical facilities, at times attempt to gain unauthorized 
access to and/or corrupt the processes used to design and manufacture our hardware products and our associated software and services. 
We are also a frequent target of attackers that intend to sabotage, compromise, take control of, or otherwise corrupt our manufacturing or 
other processes, products, and services. In some instances, we, our suppliers, our customers, and the users of our products and services 
may be unaware of a threat or incident or its magnitude and effects, or we may be unable to timely mitigate the impacts of an incident.
Cyber attack attempts are increasing in number, magnitude, and technical sophistication, and if successful may expose us and the 
affected parties to loss or misuse of proprietary or confidential information or disruptions to our business operations, including our 
manufacturing operations, and could impact our financial results. We expect emerging technologies to contribute to the increasing 
sophistication of attacks and to lead to new threats. For example, threat actors may leverage emerging AI technologies to develop new 
hacking tools and attack vectors, exploit vulnerabilities, obscure their activities, and increase the difficulty of threat attribution.
As a developer of leading-node processes and widely utilized products, we have been, and expect to continue to be, the subject of 
intense efforts by sophisticated cyber adversaries, including state-sponsored organizations, who seek to compromise our systems, disrupt 
our operations or those of users of our products, or steal trade secrets. As geopolitical or armed global conflicts escalate, attacks against 
us, our customers, or our strategic allies may similarly intensify. For example, from 2019 to 2021, we, along with other companies with 
meaningful operations in Israel, were targets of concerted cyberattacks. In the fourth quarter of 2020, our Habana Labs subsidiary’s 
network was breached in connection with a suspected unsuccessful ransomware attack, resulting in unauthorized third-party access of 
certain confidential information.
Risk Factors and Other Key Information
56


We are also subject to risks associated with attacks on products, services and components in our supply chain, such as the 2020 
compromise of IT infrastructure management software provided by SolarWinds Corporation. These providers can experience breaches of 
their systems and products, or provide inadequate updates or support, which can impact the security of our systems and our proprietary 
or confidential information. Since 2021, we have observed an increase in ransomware attacks in our supply chain. In December 2021, a 
vulnerability named “Log4Shell” was reported for the widely used Java logging library, Apache Log4j* 2, and similar vulnerabilities 
affecting commonly used programs and tools were reported in 2022 and 2023. 
We are required to comply with stringent, complex, and evolving laws, rules, regulations, and standards in many jurisdictions, as well as 
contractual obligations, relating to cybersecurity and data privacy. Our compliance efforts are complicated by the fact that these 
requirements and obligations may be subject to uncertain or inconsistent interpretations and enforcement, and may conflict among 
various jurisdictions. Any failure or perceived failure by us to comply with applicable laws, rules, regulations, standards, certifications, or 
contractual obligations, or any compromise of security that results in unauthorized access to, or unauthorized loss, destruction, use, 
modification, acquisition, disclosure, release, or transfer of personal information, may result in outcomes such as: requirements to modify 
or cease certain operations or practices; the expenditure of substantial costs, time, and other resources; proceedings or actions against 
us; legal liability; governmental investigations; enforcement actions; claims; fines; judgments; awards; penalties; sanctions; and potentially 
costly litigation (including class actions).
The theft, loss, or misuse of personal data collected, used, stored, or transferred by us to run our business, including data stored with 
vendors or other third parties, could result in significantly increased business and security costs or costs related to defending legal claims. 
Costs to comply with and implement privacy-related and data-protection measures are significant, and noncompliance could expose us to 
significant monetary penalties, damage to our reputation, suspension of online services or sites in certain countries, and even criminal 
sanctions. Even our inadvertent failure to comply with federal, state, or international privacy-related or data-protection laws and 
regulations could result in audits, regulatory inquiries, or proceedings against us by governmental entities or other third parties.
We are subject to IP risks, including related litigation and regulatory proceedings. 
We cannot always protect our IP or enforce our IP rights. We regard our patents, copyrights, trade secrets, and other IP rights as 
important to the success of our business. We rely on IP law—as well as confidentiality and licensing agreements with our customers, 
employees, technology development partners, and others—to protect our IP and IP rights. Our ability to enforce these rights is subject to 
general litigation risks, as well as uncertainty as to the enforceability of our IP rights in various countries and other geopolitical factors. We 
are not always able to obtain protection for our IP or enforce or protect our IP rights. When we seek to enforce our rights, we may be 
subject to claims that our IP rights are invalid, not enforceable, or licensed to an opposing party. Our assertion of IP rights may result in 
another party seeking to assert claims against us, which could harm our business. From time to time, governments adopt regulations—
and governments or courts render decisions—requiring compulsory licensing of IP rights, or governments require products to meet 
standards that favor local companies. Our inability to enforce our IP rights under any of these circumstances can harm our competitive 
position and business. In some cases, our IP rights can offer inadequate protection for our innovations. In addition, the theft or 
unauthorized use or publication of our trade secrets and other confidential business information could harm our competitive position and 
reduce acceptance of our products; as a result, the value of our investment in R&D, product development, and marketing could be 
reduced. This risk is heightened as competitors for technical talent increasingly seek to hire our employees.
Our licenses with other companies and participation in industry initiatives at times allow competitors to use some of our patent rights. 
Technology companies often bilaterally license patents between each other to settle disputes or as part of business agreements. Some of 
our competitors have in the past had, and may in the future have, licenses to some of our patents, and under current case law, some of 
the licenses can exhaust our patent rights as to licensed product sales under some circumstances. Our participation in industry standards 
organizations or with other industry initiatives at times requires us to offer to license our patents to companies that adopt industry-standard 
specifications. Depending on the rules of the organization, government regulations, or court decisions, we sometimes have to grant 
licenses to some of our patents for little or no cost, and as a result, we may be unable to enforce certain patents against others, and the 
value of our IP rights may be impaired.
Third parties assert claims based on IP rights against us and our products, which could harm our business. We face claims based on IP 
rights from individuals, companies, investment litigation entities, other non-practicing entities, academic and research institutions, and 
other parties. We have seen an increase in patent assertions and lawsuits initiated by well-funded non-practicing entities, including 
entities funded by third-party investment firms. These lawsuits can increase our cost of doing business, impact our reputation or 
relationship with customers, and could disrupt our operations if they succeed in blocking the trade of our products. The patent litigation 
environment has also become more challenging due to the emergence of venues adopting procedural and substantive rules that make 
them more favorable for patent asserters and courts in which injunctions are available for non-competitors. As a result, we believe we are 
facing a more hostile IP litigation environment than in past years.
We are typically engaged in a number of disputes involving IP rights. Claims that our products, technologies, or processes infringe the IP 
rights of others, regardless of their merits, cause us to incur large costs to respond to, defend, and resolve the claims, and they divert the 
efforts and attention of our management and technical personnel from our business and operations. In addition, we may face claims 
based on the alleged theft or unauthorized use or disclosure of third-party trade secrets, confidential information, or end-user data that we 
obtain in conducting our business. Any such incidents and claims could severely disrupt our business, and we could suffer losses, 
including the cost of product recalls and returns, and reputational harm. Furthermore, in many instances we agree to indemnify customers 
for certain IP rights claims against them. IP rights claims against our customers could also limit demand for our products or disrupt our 
customers' businesses, which could in turn adversely affect our results of operations.
Risk Factors and Other Key Information
57


As a result of IP rights claims, we could:
▪
pay monetary damages, payments to satisfy indemnification obligations, royalties, fines, or penalties;
▪
stop manufacturing, using, selling, offering to sell, or importing products or technology subject to claims;
▪
need to develop other products or technology not subject to claims, which could be time-consuming or costly; and/or
▪
enter into settlement or license agreements, which may not be available on commercially reasonable terms and may be costly.
These IP rights claims could harm our competitive position, result in expenses, or require us to impair our assets. If we alter or stop 
production of affected items, our revenue could be harmed.
We rely on access to third-party IP, which may not be available to us on commercially reasonable terms, if at all. Many of our products are 
designed to include third-party technology or implement industry standards, which may require licenses from third parties. In addition, 
from time to time, third parties notify us that they believe we are using their IP. There is no assurance that any necessary licenses or our 
existing licenses to such third-party IP can be obtained or are available on commercially reasonable terms or at all. Failure to obtain the 
right to use third-party technology, or to license IP on commercially reasonable terms, could preclude us from selling certain products or 
otherwise have a material adverse impact on our financial condition and operating results. To the extent our products include software that 
contains or is derived from open-source software, we may be required to make the software's source code publicly available and/or 
license the software under open-source licensing terms.
We are subject to risks associated with litigation and regulatory matters. From time to time, we face legal claims or regulatory matters 
involving stockholder, consumer, competition, commercial, IP, labor and employment, compliance, and other issues. As described in "Note 
19: Commitments and Contingencies" within the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, we are engaged in a number of litigation 
and regulatory matters. Litigation and regulatory proceedings are inherently uncertain, and adverse rulings, excessive verdicts, or other 
events could occur, including monetary damages, fines, penalties, or injunctions stopping us from manufacturing or selling certain 
products, engaging in certain business practices, or requiring other remedies, such as compulsory licensing of patents. An unfavorable 
outcome can result in a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition, and results of operations. Regardless of the 
outcome, litigation and regulatory proceedings can be costly, time-consuming, disruptive to our operations, harmful to our reputation, and 
distracting to management.
We must attract, retain, and motivate key talent. 
We believe that hiring and retaining qualified executives, scientists, engineers, technical talent, sales representatives, and other 
professionals are critical to our business. The competition for highly skilled employees in our industry is intense, with the demand often 
exceeding supply. Competitors for technical talent increasingly seek to hire our employees, and the availability of flexible, hybrid, or work-
from-home arrangements has both intensified and expanded competition. In addition, changes in immigration policies may further limit the 
pool of available talent and impair our ability to recruit and hire technical and professional talent. From time to time, we have intensified 
our efforts to recruit and retain talent, such as during 2021 and 1H 2022, and these efforts have increased our expenses. Further, we may 
not be successful in attracting, retaining, and motivating the workforce necessary to deliver on our strategy, and we have been required to 
curtail our planned hiring and reduce our workforce to respond to business conditions that differ from our expectations, which can be 
disruptive, compromise our ability to deliver on our strategy and workforce goals, and impact our ability to recruit in the future. Changes in 
employment-related laws applicable to our workforce practices may also result in increased expenses and less flexibility in how we meet 
our changing workforce needs. To help attract, retain, and motivate qualified employees, we use share-based awards, such as RSUs, and 
performance-based cash incentive awards. Sustained declines in our stock price or lower stock price performance relative to our 
competitors have been reducing the retention value of our share-based awards, which can impact the competitiveness of our 
compensation. Our employee hiring and retention also depend on our ability to build and maintain a diverse and inclusive workplace 
culture and be viewed as an employer of choice. To the extent our compensation programs and workplace culture are not viewed as 
competitive, or changes in our workforce and related restructuring, reduction-in-force or other initiatives are not viewed favorably, our 
ability to attract, retain, and motivate employees can be weakened, which could harm our results of operations. In addition, significant or 
prolonged turnover may negatively impact our operations and culture, as well as our ability to successfully maintain our processes and 
procedures, including due to the loss of historical, technical, and other expertise. Changes in our management team and any failure to 
successfully transition and assimilate key talent could disrupt our business and adversely affect our results of operations. To the extent we 
do not effectively hire, onboard, retain, and motivate key employees, our business can be harmed.
We are subject to risks associated with our strategic transactions and investments.
We routinely evaluate opportunities and enter into agreements for possible acquisitions, divestitures, and other strategic transactions, 
which are an important component of our financial allocation strategy. These transactions involve numerous risks, including:
▪
our inability to identify opportunities in a timely manner or on terms acceptable to us;
▪
failure of the transaction to advance our business strategy and failure of its anticipated benefits to materialize;
▪
disruption of our ongoing operations and diversion of our management's attention;
▪
failure of partners to satisfy financial or other obligations on which we rely;
▪
our inability to exercise sole decision-making authority regarding a project, property, or entity;
▪
failure to complete a transaction in a timely manner, or at all, due to our inability to obtain required government or other approvals 
on a timely basis or without materially burdensome conditions or mandated acquisitions, divestitures, or disposals, IP disputes or 
other litigation, difficulty in obtaining financing on terms acceptable to us, or other unforeseen factors;

▪
our failure to realize a satisfactory return on our investment, potentially resulting in an impairment of goodwill and other assets, 
and restructuring charges;
▪
our inability to effectively enter new market segments through our strategic transactions or retain customers and partners of 
acquired businesses;
▪
our inability to retain key personnel of acquired or majority-owned businesses or our difficulty in integrating or separating 
employees, business systems, and technology or otherwise operating the acquired or majority-owned business;
▪
controls, processes, and procedures of acquired or majority-owned businesses that do not adequately ensure compliance with 
laws and regulations and create complexity and inconsistency in application of controls, processes and procedures, and our 
failure to identify and/or address compliance issues, including accounting errors, or liabilities;
▪
our inability to resolve impasses or disputes with partners, including as a result of differences in our interests or goals;
▪
our failure to identify, or our underestimation of, commitments, liabilities, accounting and other risks associated with acquired 
businesses or assets, majority-owned businesses or novel transactions; and
▪
the potential for our transactions to result in dilutive issuances of our equity securities or significant additional debt.
Any of these risks could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition, or cash flows, 
particularly in the case of a large acquisition, divestiture or partial divestiture, or several concurrent strategic transactions. Moreover, our 
resources are limited and our decision to pursue a transaction has opportunity costs; accordingly, if we pursue a particular transaction, we 
at times need to forgo the prospect of entering into other transactions or otherwise investing our resources in a manner that could help us 
achieve our financial or strategic objectives. 
Where an existing investment does not strategically align to our key priorities, we routinely evaluate opportunities for possible divestitures 
and other options. We may not realize the anticipated benefits of divestitures due to risks that include unfavorable prices and terms; 
changes in market, macroeconomic, or geopolitical conditions affecting the regions or industries in which we or counterparties operate; 
changes in applicable laws; failure to receive regulatory or governmental approvals; limitations or restrictions due to regulatory or 
governmental approvals, litigation, contractual terms, or other conditions; delays in closing; lack of support by third parties; actions by 
competitors; adverse effects on our business relationships, operating results, or business due to the announcement and pendency of such 
transactions; and continued financial obligations, unanticipated liabilities, or transition costs associated with such transactions. In some 
cases, we are not able to divest investments on acceptable terms or at all.
In addition, we make investments in public and private companies to further our strategic and financial objectives and to support certain 
key business initiatives. These companies can include early-stage companies still defining their strategic direction. Many of the 
instruments in which we invest are non-marketable and illiquid at the time of our initial investment, and we are not always able to achieve 
a return in a timely fashion, if at all. Our ability to realize a return on our investment in a private company, if any, is typically dependent on 
the company participating in a liquidity event, such as a public offering or acquisition. To the extent any of the companies in which we 
invest are not successful, which at times includes bankruptcy, we could recognize an impairment and/or lose all or part of our investment.
We are subject to sales-related risks.
We face risks related to sales through distributors and other third parties. We sell a significant portion of our products through third parties, 
such as distributors, value-added resellers, and channel partners (collectively referred to as distributors), as well as OEMs and ODMs. We 
depend on many distributors to help us create end-customer demand, provide technical support and other value-added services to 
customers, fill customer orders, and stock our products. At times, we rely on one or more key distributors for a product, and a material 
change in our relationship with one or more of these distributors or their failure to perform as expected could reduce our revenue. Our 
ability to add or replace distributors for some of our products is limited. In addition, our distributors' expertise in the determination and 
stocking of acceptable inventory levels for some of our products is not always easily transferable to a new distributor; as a result, end 
customers may be hesitant to accept the addition or replacement of a distributor. Using third parties for distribution exposes us to many 
risks, including competitive pressure and concentration, credit, and compliance risks. Distributors and other third parties often sell 
products that compete with our products, and we sometimes need to provide financial and other incentives to focus them on the sale of 
our products. From time to time, they may face financial difficulties, including bankruptcy, which could harm our collection of accounts 
receivable and financial results. Further, any violations of the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act or similar laws by distributors or other third-
party intermediaries could have a material impact on our business, including subjecting us to litigation or regulatory risk. Failure to 
manage risks related to our use of distributors and other third parties may reduce sales, increase expenses, and weaken our competitive 
position.
From time to time, our products are resold by third parties in an unauthorized "gray market." Our policies and procedures designed to 
keep our products away from the gray market may not be successful in achieving this objective. Gray market products can distort demand 
and pricing dynamics in our distribution channel and certain geographies, which at times adversely affects our revenue opportunities. 
Gray market activity is difficult to monitor and can make forecasting demand more challenging. Gray market products also sometimes 
include parts that have been altered or damaged, and our reputation may be harmed when these products fail or are found to be 
substandard. 
We receive a significant portion of our revenue from a limited number of customers. Collectively, our three largest customers accounted 
for 40% of our net revenue in 2023, 42% of our net revenue in 2022 and 43% of our net revenue in 2021. We expect a small number of 
customers will continue to account for a significant portion of our revenue in the foreseeable future.

Industry trends, such as the increasing shift of data center workloads to the public cloud, have increased the significance and purchasing 
power of certain customers, particularly hyperscalers, in some of our data center-focused businesses. The cloud and cloud applications 
represent an increasingly demanding computing environment. The further consolidation of computing workloads in the cloud, and 
consolidation among cloud service providers, can heighten the competitive importance of factors such as collaboration and customization 
with cloud service provider customers to optimize products for their environments; optimization for cloud services and applications; 
product performance; energy efficiency; feature differentiation; product quality, reliability, and factors affecting server uptime; and product 
security and security features. Our competitive position can be eroded to the extent we do not execute effectively across these factors. 
We are operating in an increasingly competitive environment, including serving cloud service provider customers, and the competitive 
environment adversely affected our results in DCAI in 2023 and 2022. 
Some cloud service provider customers have also internally developed, and may continue to develop, their own semiconductors, including 
designs customized for their specific computing workloads. In addition, cloud services can be marketed to end users based on service 
levels or features rather than hardware specifications, or they can abstract hardware under layers of software, which can make it more 
difficult to differentiate our products to customers and end users. The shift of data center workloads to the cloud has also adversely 
affected, and may continue to affect, sales to enterprise customers when end users have elected to migrate workloads from their own 
internal data center infrastructures to cloud service providers. To the extent we differentiate our products through customization to meet 
cloud customer specifications, order changes, delays, or cancellations may result in non-recoverable costs. 
The loss of key customers, a substantial reduction in sales to them, or changes in the timing of their orders can lead to a reduction in our 
revenue, increase the volatility of our results, and harm our results of operations and financial condition. For information about our 
customers who accounted for greater than 10% of our net consolidated revenue, see "Note 3: Operating Segments" within the Notes to 
Consolidated Financial Statements.
We face risks related to transactions with government entities. We receive proceeds from both US and non-US governments associated 
with grants, incentives, and sales of our products and services, and we are seeking to increase our sales of products and services to 
governmental entities in the future. Government demand and payment are often affected by public sector budgetary cycles and funding 
authorizations, including, with respect to US government contracts, congressional approval of appropriations, and can be adversely 
impacted by shutdowns of the US federal government. Government contracts are subject to procurement laws and regulations relating to 
the award, administration, and performance of those contracts, as well as oversight and penalties for violations. For example, certain 
agreements with the US government are subject to special rules on accounting, IP rights, expenses, reviews, information handling, 
security, customers, and/or employees, and failure or inability to comply with these rules could result in civil and criminal penalties and 
sanctions, including termination of contracts, fines, and suspension or debarment from future business with the US government.
We face risks related to our debt obligations.
As we pursue our IDM 2.0 strategy, we have incurred significant debt obligations that could adversely affect our business and financial 
condition, including our ability to fully implement our strategy. As of December 30, 2023, we had $50.3 billion in aggregate principal 
amount of senior unsecured notes and other borrowings outstanding. In addition, we have a commercial paper program of up to $10.0 
billion and credit facilities to backstop these programs and otherwise provide access to committed capital of up to $10.0 billion. As we 
continue to pursue our IDM 2.0 strategy, we expect to incur additional indebtedness, refinance our existing debt, and issue additional 
notes or other debt securities in the future at a variety of interest rates, maturities, and terms. The semiconductor industry is a cyclical 
business and our revenue, cash flows, and outlook often fluctuate in accordance with this cycle, as well as prevailing macroeconomic 
conditions, our business strategy, and other risks described in these risk factors. These fluctuations, together with our debt level and 
related debt service obligations, could have the effect of, among other things, reducing our flexibility to respond to changing business and 
economic conditions and increasing the risk of a future downgrade in our credit ratings that can potentially impact the value of our 
outstanding debt and increase our borrowing costs. We may also be required to raise additional financing for working capital, capital 
expenditures, debt service obligations, debt refinancing, future acquisitions, or other general corporate purposes, which will depend on, 
among other factors, our financial position and performance, as well as prevailing market conditions and other factors beyond our control. 
Consequently, we may not be able to obtain additional financing or refinancing on terms acceptable to us, or at all, which could adversely 
impact our ability to finance our business strategy and service and repay outstanding indebtedness as it becomes due, all of which could 
adversely impact our business, financial condition, and the cost of borrowing. 
We have significantly reduced our return of capital to stockholders in recent years. 
In recent years, we have not made repurchases of our stock and reduced the amount of our quarterly dividend. There can be no 
assurance that we will continue to pay dividends at the current level, or at all. In addition, we are not obligated to make repurchases under 
our stock repurchase program and there can be no assurances as to the amount, timing, and execution of any future share repurchases, 
or that any repurchases will enhance long-term stockholder value.

Laws and regulations can have a negative impact on our business. 
We are subject to complex and evolving laws and regulations worldwide that differ among jurisdictions and affect our operations in areas 
including, but not limited to: IP ownership and infringement; tax; import and export requirements; anti-corruption; foreign exchange 
controls and cash repatriation restrictions; data privacy and localization requirements; competition; advertising; employment and labor; 
product regulations; environment, health, and safety requirements; and consumer laws. Compliance with such requirements can be 
onerous and expensive and may otherwise impact our business operations negatively. For example, unfavorable developments with 
evolving laws and regulations worldwide related to 5G or autonomous driving technology and MaaS may limit global adoption, impede our 
strategy, or negatively impact our long-term expectations for our investments in these areas. Expanding privacy legislation and 
compliance costs of privacy-related and data-protection measures could adversely affect our customers and their products and services, 
particularly in cloud, Internet of Things, and AI applications, which could in turn reduce demand for our products used for those workloads.
Our policies, controls, and procedures designed to help provide for compliance with applicable laws cannot provide assurance that our 
employees, contractors, suppliers, or agents will not violate such laws or our policies. Violations of these laws and regulations can result 
in fines; criminal sanctions against us, our officers, or our employees; prohibitions on the conduct of our business; and damage to our 
reputation. The technology industry is subject to intense media, political, and regulatory scrutiny, which can increase our exposure to 
government investigations, legal actions, and penalties.
We are affected by fluctuations in currency exchange rates. 
We are exposed to adverse as well as beneficial movements in currency exchange rates. Although most of our sales occur in US dollars, 
expenses may be paid in local currencies. An increase in the value of the dollar can increase the real cost to our customers of our 
products in those markets outside the US where we sell in dollars, and a weakened dollar can increase the cost of expenses such as 
payroll, utilities, tax, and marketing expenses, as well as non-US dollar capital expenditures. We also conduct certain investing and 
financing activities in local currencies. Our hedging programs may not be effective to offset any, or more than a portion, of the adverse 
impact of currency exchange rate movements; therefore, changes in exchange rates can harm our results of operations and financial 
condition. 
Changes in our effective tax rate may impact our net income. 
A number of factors can impact our future effective tax rate or cash payments, which could cause significant variability in our financial 
results including:
▪
changes in the volume and mix of profits earned and location of assets across jurisdictions with varying tax rates;
▪
changes in our business or legal entity operating model;
▪
the resolution of issues arising from tax audits, including payment of interest and penalties;
▪
changes in the valuation of our deferred tax assets and liabilities, and in deferred tax valuation allowances;
▪
adjustments to estimated taxes upon finalization of tax returns;
▪
increases in expenses not deductible for tax purposes, including impairments of goodwill;
▪
changes in available tax credits, including non-US tax credits, R&D credits and refundable tax credits;
▪
expirations or changes in our ability to secure new tax holidays and incentives;
▪
changes in US federal, state, or foreign tax laws or their interpretation, including the global implementation of a minimum tax 
under Pillar Two of the OECD BEPS initiative;
▪
changes in US GAAP; and
▪
our decision to repatriate non-US earnings for which we have not previously provided for incremental taxes including any local 
country withholding taxes incurred upon repatriation.
Catastrophic events can have a material adverse effect on our operations and financial results. 
Our operations and business, and those of our customers and suppliers, can be disrupted by natural disasters; industrial accidents; public 
health issues and global pandemics such as COVID 19; cybersecurity incidents; interruptions of service from utilities, transportation 
restrictions or disruptions, telecommunications, or IT systems providers; manufacturing equipment failures; geopolitical conflict; terrorism; 
or other catastrophic events. For example, we have at times experienced disruptions in our manufacturing processes as a result of power 
outages, improperly functioning equipment, and disruptions in supply of raw materials or components, including cybersecurity incidents 
affecting our suppliers. Our headquarters and many of our operations and facilities are in locations that are prone to earthquakes and 
other natural disasters. Global climate change can result in certain natural disasters occurring more frequently or with greater intensity, 
such as drought, wildfires, storms, sea-level rise, and flooding, and could disrupt the availability of water necessary for the operation of 
our fabrication facilities, including our facilities located in water-sensitive regions such as Arizona and Israel. In addition, to the extent we 
are unable to successfully manage and conserve water resources, our reputation could be harmed. In recent years, the west coast of the 
US has experienced significant wildfires, including in Oregon, where we have major manufacturing facilities, and in California, where we 
are headquartered. The long-term effects of climate change on the global economy and the technology industry in particular are unclear 
but could be severe. 
Risk Factors and Other Key Information
61


Catastrophic events including global pandemics could make it difficult or impossible to manufacture or deliver products to our customers, 
receive production materials from our suppliers, or perform critical functions, which could adversely affect our revenue and require 
significant recovery time and expenditures to resume operations. The COVID-19 pandemic previously resulted in substantial economic 
uncertainty and volatility and disrupted historical patterns related to demand for our products and services that may impact our ability to 
accurately predict future demand, trends, or other matters that may impact our financial performance. While we maintain business 
recovery plans, some of our systems are not fully redundant and we cannot be sure that our plans will fully protect us from such 
disruptions. Furthermore, even if our operations are unaffected or recover quickly, if our customers or suppliers cannot timely resume their 
own operations due to a catastrophic event, we may experience reduced or cancelled orders or disruptions to our supply chain that may 
adversely affect our results of operations.
We are subject to risks associated with environmental, health, safety, and product regulations. 
The design, manufacturing, assembly and test of our products require the use and purchase of materials and chemicals that are subject to 
a broad array of environmental, health, and safety laws and regulations. Our operations and those of our suppliers are further governed 
by regulations prohibiting the use of forced labor (e.g., mining conflict minerals), and restrictions on other materials, as well as laws or 
regulations governing the operation of our facilities, sale and distribution of our products, and use of our real property. The scope and 
interpretation of such laws and regulations, including the materials they govern, are complex and continue to evolve. The procedures and 
processes in place under our compliance program may become onerous or increasingly expensive to maintain and cannot guarantee 
compliance by employees or third parties to whom such laws apply. The amendment or expansion of these laws or regulations, as well as 
our failure or inability to comply with them (including as a result of acquired entities) can result in regulatory penalties, fines, and legal 
liabilities; increased costs; additional remediation obligations; suspension of production; alteration, suspension, or termination of our 
manufacturing and assembly and test processes, including due to an inability to find, afford, or attain adequate substitute materials, 
equipment, or processes; damage to our reputation; and restrictions on our operations or sales. In addition, the failure or inability to 
comply by our suppliers of these materials can require us to suspend or alter our production processes and sources, and result in 
increased risks and costs.
The failure or inability by us or our customers and suppliers to manage the use, transportation, emissions, discharge, storage, recycling, 
or disposal of hazardous materials can lead to increased costs or future liabilities. Environmental regulations, including with respect to the 
materials and processes we are permitted to use and as to air quality and wastewater requirements, may impede our ability to 
manufacture products or expand or modify our manufacturing capability in the future. Environmental laws and regulations sometimes 
require us to acquire additional pollution abatement or remediation equipment, modify product designs, cease the use of a particular 
material or process, remove or remediate hazardous substances, or incur other expenses or liabilities. Regulations in response to climate 
change could result in increased manufacturing costs associated with air pollution requirements. For example, semiconductor 
manufacturing uses perfluorocarbons, which have historically made up a large portion of our direct greenhouse gas emissions. New or 
increased regulations limiting the use of such compounds, or other greenhouse gas emissions, could require us to install additional 
abatement equipment, purchase carbon offsets, and/or alter, where feasible, our production processes and sources. In addition, new or 
increased climate change regulation could increase our energy costs, for example as a result of carbon pricing impacts on electrical 
utilities. Regulations in response to human health concerns may also limit or prohibit the use of a class of chemicals known as per- and 
polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS), which are found in parts, components, process chemicals and other materials used in semiconductor 
manufacturing. Such chemicals are critical to the manufacturing and functioning of many semiconductor products and there are limited 
technically and commercially feasible alternatives to them. As we expand our manufacturing capacity as part of our IDM 2.0 strategy, the 
impacts of future regulation could be magnified. Many new materials that we are evaluating for use in our operations are also subject to 
regulation under environmental laws and regulations. These restrictions could harm our business and results of operations by increasing 
our expenses or requiring us to alter manufacturing and assembly and test processes.
Our initiatives and new legal requirements with respect to corporate responsibility matters present 
various risks. 
Our corporate responsibility initiatives, including our RISE strategy and related goals, could expose us to heightened scrutiny and 
numerous financial, legal, reputational, operational, compliance, and other risks, including lost customer opportunities, which could 
negatively impact us. Our achievement of initiatives, aspirations, and goals related to corporate responsibility matters, including those 
related to sustainability, is not guaranteed and is subject to numerous conditions, risks, and expectations; as well as standards, 
processes, and methodologies that continue to evolve. Further, any failure to set or achieve corporate responsibility initiatives that meet 
our stakeholders' evolving expectations could also negatively impact us.
In addition, we are or expect to become subject to various new or proposed climate-related and other sustainability laws and regulations, 
including, for example, the state of California's new climate change disclosure requirements, the EU's new Corporate Sustainability 
Reporting Directive and proposed climate-change disclosure requirements from the SEC. Compliance with such laws and regulations, as 
well as the overall increased focus and scrutiny from the SEC and other regulators, investors, customers, vendors, employees, and other 
stakeholders concerning ESG and climate matters, could impose additional costs on us and expose us to new risks, including resulting in 
changes to our current ESG goals.

Sales and Marketing 
Customers
We sell our products primarily to OEMs, ODMs, and cloud service providers. ODMs provide design and manufacturing services to 
branded and unbranded private-label resellers. In addition, our customers include other manufacturers and service providers, such as 
industrial and communication equipment manufacturers and other cloud service providers who buy our products through distributor, 
reseller, retail, and OEM channels throughout the world. For information on customers who accounted for greater than 10% of our net 
consolidated revenue, see "Note 3: Operating Segments" within the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.
Our worldwide reseller sales channel consists of thousands of indirect customers—systems builders that purchase Intel processors and 
other products from our distributors. Certain of our microprocessors and other products are also available in direct retail outlets.
Sales Arrangements
Our products are sold through distribution channels throughout the world. Sales of our products are frequently made via purchase order 
acknowledgments that contain standard terms and conditions covering matters such as pricing, payment terms, and warranties, as well as 
indemnities for issues specific to our products, such as patent and copyright indemnities. Because our customers generally order from us 
on a purchase order basis, they can typically cancel, change, or delay product purchase commitments with little or no notice to us and 
without penalty. From time to time, we may enter into additional agreements with customers covering, for example, changes from our 
standard terms and conditions, new product development and marketing, and private-label branding. Our sales are routinely made using 
electronic and web-based processes that allow customers to review inventory availability and track the progress of specific goods 
ordered. Pricing on particular products may vary based on volumes ordered and other factors. We also offer discounts, rebates, and other 
incentives to customers to increase acceptance of our products and technology.
In accordance with contract terms, the revenue for combined performance obligations and standalone product sales is recognized at the 
time of product shipment from our facilities or delivery to the customer location, as determined by the agreed-upon shipping terms. Our 
standard terms and conditions of sale typically provide that payment is due at a later date, usually 30 days after shipment or delivery. We 
assess credit risk through quantitative and qualitative analysis. From this analysis, we establish shipping and credit limits and determine 
whether we will seek to use one or more credit support protection devices, such as obtaining a parent guarantee, standby letter of credit, 
or credit insurance. Credit losses may still be incurred due to bankruptcy, fraud, or other failure of the customer to pay. 
Our sales to distributors are typically made under agreements allowing for price protection on unsold merchandise and a right of return on 
stipulated quantities of unsold merchandise. Under the price protection program, we give distributors credits for the difference between 
the original price paid and the current price that we offer. Our products typically have no contractual limit on the amount of price 
protection, nor is there a limit on the time horizon under which price protection is granted. The right of return granted generally consists of 
a stock rotation program in which distributors can exchange certain products based on the number of qualified purchases made by the 
distributor. 
Distribution
Distributors typically handle a wide variety of products, including those that compete with our products, and fill orders for many customers. 
Customers may place orders directly with us or through distributors. We have several distribution warehouses that are located in proximity 
to key customers.
Seasonal Trends
Historically, our net revenue has typically been higher in the second half of the year than in the first half of the year, accelerating in the 
third quarter and peaking in the fourth quarter. In 2021, continued strong COVID-driven notebook demand in the first half of the year 
contributed to a flatter trend than we historically observe. In 2022, we had a flatter trend than we historically observe as we experienced 
the uncertainty and impacts, including demand volatility and supply chain disruption, of macroeconomic conditions, the potential for a 
recession, and the risk for continued COVID-related disruptions or shutdowns. In 2023, our net revenue seasonality was more consistent 
with our historical pre-pandemic trend.
Marketing
Our global marketing objectives are to build a strong, well-known, differentiated, and meaningful Intel corporate brand that drives 
preference with businesses and consumers, and to offer a limited number of meaningful and valuable brands in our portfolio to aid 
businesses and consumers in making informed choices about technology purchases. The Intel Core processor family and the Intel Atom, 
Celeron®, Pentium®, Intel® Movidius™, and Intel Xeon trademarks make up our key CPU brands. This year we introduced our new Intel® 
Core™ Ultra processors, powering the latest AI PCs, and our 5th Gen Intel Xeon processors, built with AI acceleration in every core. We 
also continue to bring to market new software services including independent attestation security with Intel® Trust Authority, Intel® 
Granulate™ for workload compute optimization, and Intel Developer Cloud to accelerate AI development. Our foundry services business 
aims to offer leading-edge packaging and process technology, geographically balanced manufacturing capacity and a world-class IP 
portfolio.
Risk Factors and Other Key Information

We promote brand awareness and preference and generate demand through our own direct marketing, as well as through co-marketing 
programs. Our direct marketing activities primarily include advertising through digital and social media and television, as well as consumer 
and trade events, industry and consumer communications, and press relations. We market to consumer and business audiences and 
focus on building awareness and generating demand for our products. Our key messaging focuses on increased performance, improved 
energy efficiency, and other capabilities such as connectivity.
Certain customers participate in cooperative advertising and marketing programs. These cooperative advertising and marketing programs 
broaden the reach of our brands beyond the scope of our own direct marketing. Certain customers are licensed to place Intel® logos on 
computing devices containing our microprocessors and processor technologies, and to use our brands in their marketing activities. The 
program partially reimburses customers for marketing activities for products featuring Intel brands, subject to customers meeting defined 
criteria. These marketing activities primarily include advertising through digital and social media and television, as well as press relations. 
We have also entered into joint marketing arrangements with certain customers.
Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk
We are affected by changes in currency exchange and interest rates, as well as equity and commodity prices. Our risk management 
programs are designed to reduce, but may not eliminate, the impacts of these risks. All of the following potential changes are based on 
sensitivity analyses performed on our financial positions as of December 30, 2023 and December 31, 2022. Actual results may differ 
materially. 
Currency Exchange Rates
We are exposed to currency exchange risks of non-US-dollar-denominated investments in debt and equity instruments, and may 
economically hedge this risk with foreign currency contracts, such as currency forward contracts or currency interest rate swaps. Gains or 
losses on these non-US-currency investments are generally offset by corresponding losses or gains on the related hedging instruments. 
Substantially all of our revenue is transacted in US dollars. However, a portion of our operating expenditures and capital purchases are 
incurred in other currencies, primarily the Israeli shekel, the Malaysian ringgit, the European Union euro, the Japanese yen, and the 
Chinese yuan. We have established currency risk management programs to protect against currency exchange rate risks associated with 
non-US-dollar forecasted future cash flows and existing non-US-dollar monetary assets and liabilities. We may also hedge currency risk 
arising from funding of foreign currency-denominated future investments. We may utilize foreign currency contracts, such as currency 
forwards or option contracts in these hedging programs. We considered the historical trends in currency exchange rates and determined 
that it was reasonably possible that a weighted average adverse change of 10% in currency exchange rates could be experienced in the 
near term. Such an adverse change, after taking into account balance sheet hedges only and offsetting recorded monetary asset and 
liability positions outstanding as of December 30, 2023 and December 31, 2022, would result in an adverse impact on income before 
taxes of less than $53 million and less than $64 million, respectively.
Interest Rates
We are exposed to interest rate risk related to our fixed-rate investment portfolio and outstanding debt. The primary objective of our 
investment policy is to preserve principal and provide financial flexibility to fund our business while maximizing yields, which generally 
track the SOFR. We generally enter into interest rate contracts to convert the returns on our fixed-rate debt investment with remaining 
maturities longer than six months into SOFR-based returns. We also entered into swaps to convert fixed-rate coupon payments into 
floating-rate coupon payments for a portion of our existing indebtedness. Gains or losses on these instruments are generally offset by 
corresponding losses or gains on the related hedging instruments.
A hypothetical change in benchmark interest rates of 1%, after taking into account investment hedges, would have resulted in a change in 
the fair value of our investment portfolio of less than $100 million as of December 30, 2023 and as of December 31, 2022.
Taking into account fixed-rate debt that is swapped to floating-rate debt, a hypothetical increase in interest rates of 1% would result in an 
increase in annual interest expense of approximately $120 million from debt outstanding as of December 30, 2023 (a hypothetical 
increase of 1% would have resulted in an increase in annual interest expense of approximately $120 million from debt outstanding as of 
December 31, 2022).
Equity Prices
We are exposed to equity market risk through our investments in marketable equity securities, which we typically do not attempt to reduce 
or eliminate through hedging activities. 
Risk Factors and Other Key Information
64


As of December 30, 2023, the fair value of our marketable equity securities was $1.2 billion ($1.3 billion as of December 31, 2022). The 
substantial majority of our marketable equity securities portfolio as of December 30, 2023 was concentrated in securities traded on the 
Chinese Shanghai Stock Exchange Science and Technology Innovation Board. To determine reasonably possible decreases in the market 
value of our marketable equity securities, we have analyzed the historical market price sensitivity of our portfolio. Assuming a decline of 
35% in market prices, the aggregate value of our marketable equity securities could decrease by $418 million, based on the value as of 
December 30, 2023 (a decrease in value of $670 million, based on the value as of December 31, 2022 using an assumed decline of 
50%). 
We utilize total return swaps to offset changes in liabilities related to the equity market risks of certain deferred compensation 
arrangements. Gains or losses from changes in fair value of these total return swaps are generally offset by the losses or gains on the 
related liabilities.
Many of the same factors that could result in an adverse movement of equity market prices affect our non-marketable equity investments, 
although we cannot always quantify the impacts directly. Financial markets are volatile, which could negatively affect the prospects of the 
companies we invest in, their ability to raise additional capital, and the likelihood of our ability to realize value in our investments through 
liquidity events such as IPOs, mergers, and private sales. These types of investments involve a great deal of risk, and there can be no 
assurance that any specific company will grow or become successful; consequently, we could lose all or part of our investment. Our non-
marketable equity securities had a carrying amount of $4.6 billion as of December 30, 2023 ($4.6 billion as of December 31, 2022) and 
include our investment in Beijing Unisoc Technology Ltd. of $1.1 billion ($1.1 billion as of December 31, 2022). 
Commodity Price Risk
Although we operate facilities that consume commodities, we are not directly affected by commodity price risk to a material degree. We 
have established forecasted transaction risk management programs to protect against fluctuations in commodity prices. We may use 
commodity derivatives contracts, such as commodity swaps, in these hedging programs. In addition, we have sourcing plans in place that 
are designed to mitigate the risk of a potential supplier concentration for our key commodities. 
Cybersecurity
We face significant and persistent cybersecurity risks due to: the breadth of geographies, networks, and systems we must defend against 
cybersecurity attacks; the complexity, technical sophistication, value, and widespread use of our systems, products and processes; the 
attractiveness of our systems, products and processes to threat actors (including state-sponsored organizations) seeking to inflict harm on 
us or our customers; the substantial level of harm that could occur to us and our customers were we to suffer impacts of a material 
cybersecurity incident; and our use of third-party products, services and components. We are committed to maintaining robust 
governance and oversight of these risks and to implementing mechanisms, controls, technologies, and processes designed to help us 
assess, identify, and manage these risks. While we have not, as of the date of this Form 10-K, experienced a cybersecurity threat or 
incident that resulted in a material adverse impact to our business or operations, there can be no guarantee that we will not experience 
such an incident in the future. Such incidents, whether or not successful, could result in our incurring significant costs related to, for 
example, rebuilding our internal systems, writing down inventory value, implementing additional threat protection measures, providing 
modifications or replacements to our products and services, defending against litigation, responding to regulatory inquiries or actions, 
paying damages, providing customers with incentives to maintain a business relationship with us, or taking other remedial steps with 
respect to third parties, as well as incurring significant reputational harm. In addition, these threats are constantly evolving, thereby 
increasing the difficulty of successfully defending against them or implementing adequate preventative measures. We have seen an 
increase in cyberattack volume, frequency, and sophistication. We seek to detect and investigate unauthorized attempts and attacks 
against our network, products, and services, and to prevent their occurrence and recurrence where practicable through changes or 
updates to our internal processes and tools and changes or updates to our products and services; however, we remain potentially 
vulnerable to known or unknown threats. In some instances, we, our suppliers, our customers, and the users of our products and services 
can be unaware of a threat or incident or its magnitude and effects. Further, there is increasing regulation regarding responses to 
cybersecurity incidents, including reporting to regulators, which could subject us to additional liability and reputational harm. See "Risk 
Factors" for more information on our cybersecurity risks and product vulnerability risks.
We aim to incorporate industry best practices throughout our cybersecurity program. Our cybersecurity strategy focuses on implementing 
effective and efficient controls, technologies, and other processes to assess, identify, and manage material cybersecurity risks. Our 
cybersecurity program is designed to be aligned with applicable industry standards and is assessed annually by independent third-party 
auditors. We have processes in place to assess, identify, manage, and address material cybersecurity threats and incidents. These 
include, among other things: annual and ongoing security awareness training for employees; mechanisms to detect and monitor unusual 
network activity; and containment and incident response tools. We actively engage with industry groups for benchmarking and awareness 
of best practices. We monitor issues that are internally discovered or externally reported that may affect our products, and have processes 
to assess those issues for potential cybersecurity impact or risk. We also have a process in place to manage cybersecurity risks 
associated with third-party service providers. We impose security requirements upon our suppliers, including: maintaining an effective 
security management program; abiding by information handling and asset management requirements; and notifying us in the event of any 
known or suspected cyber incident.

Our Board of Directors has ultimate oversight of cybersecurity risk, which it manages as part of our enterprise risk management program. 
That program is utilized in making decisions with respect to company priorities, resource allocations, and oversight structures. The Board 
of Directors is assisted by the Audit & Finance Committee, which regularly reviews our cybersecurity program with management and 
reports to the Board of Directors. Cybersecurity reviews by the Audit & Finance Committee or the Board of Directors generally occur at 
least twice annually, or more frequently as determined to be necessary or advisable. A number of Intel directors have experience in 
assessing and managing cybersecurity risk. 
Our cybersecurity program is run by our Chief Information Security Officer (CISO), who reports to our Executive Vice President and Chief 
Technology Officer (CTO). Our CISO is informed about and monitors prevention, detection, mitigation, and remediation efforts through 
regular communication and reporting from professionals in the information security team, many of whom hold cybersecurity certifications 
such as a Certified Information Systems Security Professional or Certified Information Security Manager, and through the use of 
technological tools and software and results from third party audits. Our CISO and CTO have extensive experience assessing and 
managing cybersecurity programs and cybersecurity risk. Our CISO has served in that position since 2015 and, before Intel, was 
previously the Chief Security Officer at McAfee and the Chief Information Officer and CISO for the US House of Representatives. Our 
CTO joined Intel in 2021 and was previously Senior Vice President and CTO at VMware, with responsibility for product security. Our CISO 
and CTO regularly report directly to the Audit & Finance Committee or the Board of Directors on our cybersecurity program and efforts to 
prevent, detect, mitigate, and remediate issues. In addition, we have an escalation process in place to inform senior management and the 
Board of Directors of material issues.

Issuer Purchases of Equity Securities
We have an ongoing authorization, originally approved by our Board of Directors in 2005 and most recently amended on October 24, 
2019, to repurchase shares of our common stock in open market or negotiated transactions. Our last share repurchase under this 
authorization occurred in Q1 2021, and no shares were repurchased during the fiscal year ending December 30, 2023. As of December 
30, 2023, we were authorized to repurchase up to $110.0 billion, of which $7.2 billion remained available. 
We issue RSUs as part of our equity incentive plans. In our Consolidated Financial Statements, we treat shares of common stock withheld 
for tax purposes on behalf of our employees in connection with the vesting of RSUs as common stock repurchases because they reduce 
the number of shares that would have been issued upon vesting. These withheld shares of common stock are not considered common 
stock repurchases under our authorized common stock repurchase program.
Rule 10b5-1 Trading Arrangements
Our directors and officers (as defined in Rule 16a-1 under the Exchange Act) may from time to time enter into plans or other 
arrangements for the purchase or sale of our shares that are intended to satisfy the affirmative defense conditions of Rule 10b5–1(c) or 
may represent a non-Rule 10b5-1 trading arrangement under the Exchange Act. During the quarter ended December 30, 2023, no such 
plans or arrangements were adopted or terminated, including by modification.

Disclosure Pursuant to Section 13(r) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934
Section 13(r) of the Exchange Act requires an issuer to disclose certain information in its periodic reports if it or any of its affiliates 
knowingly engaged in certain activities, transactions, or dealings with individuals or entities subject to specific US economic sanctions 
during the reporting period, even when the activities, transactions, or dealings are conducted in compliance with applicable law. On March 
2, 2021, the US Secretary of State designated the Federal Security Service of the Russian Federation (FSB) as a party subject to one 
such sanction. Though Intel has suspended sales in Russia, there may be a need to file documents or engage with FSB as Intel winds up 
our local offices. All such dealings are explicitly authorized by General License 1B issued by the US Department of the Treasury's Office of 
Foreign Assets Control (OFAC), and there are no gross revenues or net profits directly associated with any such dealings by us with the 
FSB. 
On April 15, 2021, the US Department of the Treasury designated Pozitiv Teknolodzhiz, AO (Positive Technologies), a Russian IT security 
firm, as a party subject to one of the sanctions specified in Section 13(r). Prior to the designation, we communicated with Positive 
Technologies regarding its IT security research and coordinated disclosure of security vulnerabilities identified by the firm. Based on a 
license issued by OFAC, we resumed such communications. There are no gross revenues or net profits directly associated with any such 
activities. We plan to continue these communications in accordance with the terms and conditions of the OFAC license.

Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm
To the Stockholders and the Board of Directors of Intel Corporation
Opinion on the Financial Statements
We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Intel Corporation (the Company) as of December 30, 2023 and 
December 31, 2022, the related consolidated statements of income, comprehensive income, cash flows and stockholders' equity for each 
of the three years in the period ended December 30, 2023, and the related notes (collectively referred to as the "consolidated financial 
statements"). In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the 
Company at December 30, 2023 and December 31, 2022, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years 
in the period ended December 30, 2023, in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. 
We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), 
the Company's internal control over financial reporting as of December 30, 2023, based on criteria established in Internal Control—
Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (2013 framework) and our 
report dated January 25, 2024 expressed an unqualified opinion thereon.
Basis for Opinion
These financial statements are the responsibility of the Company's management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the 
Company's financial statements based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be 
independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the US federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of 
the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB. 
We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to 
obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. Our 
audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to error or 
fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding 
the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and 
significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements. We believe that our 
audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion. 
Critical Audit Matter
The critical audit matter communicated below is a matter arising from the current period audit of the financial statements that was 
communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that: (1) relates to accounts or disclosures that are material to 
the financial statements and (2) involved our especially challenging, subjective or complex judgments. The communication of the critical 
audit matter does not alter in any way our opinion on the consolidated financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by 
communicating the critical audit matter below, providing a separate opinion on the critical audit matter or on the accounts or disclosures to 
which it relates.
Auditor's Reports

Inventory Valuation
Description of the 
Matter
The Company's net inventory totaled $11.1 billion as of December 30, 2023, representing 5.8% of total assets. 
As explained in "Note 2: Accounting Policies" within the consolidated financial statements, the Company 
computes inventory cost on a first-in, first-out basis, and applies judgment in determining saleability of 
products and the valuation of inventories. The Company assesses inventory at each reporting date in order to 
assert that it is recorded at net realizable value, giving consideration to, among other factors: whether the 
products have achieved the substantive engineering milestones to qualify for sale to customers; the 
determination of normal capacity levels in its manufacturing process to determine which manufacturing 
overhead costs can be included in the valuation of inventory; whether the product is valued at the lower of cost 
or net realizable value; and the estimation of excess and obsolete inventory or that which is not of saleable 
quality. 
Auditing management’s assessment of net realizable value for inventory was challenging because the 
determination of excess and obsolete inventory reserves and lower of cost or net realizable value is 
judgmental and considers a number of factors that are affected by market and economic conditions, such as 
customer forecasts, dynamic pricing environments, and industry supply and demand. Additionally, for certain 
new product launches there is limited historical data with which to evaluate forecasts.
How We Addressed 
the Matter in Our 
Audit
We evaluated and tested the design and operating effectiveness of the Company’s internal controls over the 
costing of inventory, the determination of whether inventory is of saleable quality, the determination of demand 
forecasts and related application against on hand inventory, and the calculation of lower of cost or net 
realizable value reserves including related estimated costs and selling prices.
Our audit procedures included, among others, testing the significant assumptions (e.g., estimated product 
demand forecasts, costs and selling prices) of the underlying data used in management’s inventory valuation 
assessment. We compared the significant assumptions used by management to current industry and 
economic trends. We assessed whether there were any potential sources of contrary information, including 
historical forecast accuracy or history of significant revisions to previously recorded inventory valuation 
adjustments, and performed sensitivity analyses over significant assumptions to evaluate the changes in 
inventory valuation that would result from changes in the assumptions.

Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm
To the Stockholders and the Board of Directors of Intel Corporation
Opinion on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting
We have audited Intel Corporation's internal control over financial reporting as of December 30, 2023, based on criteria established in 
Internal Control—Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (2013 
framework) (the COSO criteria). In our opinion, Intel Corporation (the Company) maintained, in all material respects, effective internal 
control over financial reporting as of December 30, 2023, based on the COSO criteria.
We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), 
the 2023 consolidated financial statements of the Company and our report dated January 25, 2024 expressed an unqualified opinion 
thereon.
Basis for Opinion
The Company's management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the 
effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting included in the accompanying Management Report on Internal Control Over 
Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company's internal control over financial reporting based on our 
audit. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in 
accordance with the US federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and 
the PCAOB. 
We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to 
obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. 
Our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness 
exists, testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk, and performing such 
other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our 
opinion.
Definition and Limitations of Internal Control Over Financial Reporting
A company's internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of 
financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting 
principles. A company's internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance 
of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) 
provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance 
with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with 
authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely 
detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company's assets that could have a material effect on the financial 
statements. 
Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of 
any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in 
conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements
Note 1 : Basis of Presentation
We have a 52- or 53-week fiscal year that ends on the last Saturday in December. Fiscal years 2023 and 2021 were 52-week fiscal years; 
2022 was a 53-week fiscal year. Fiscal 2024 is a 52-week fiscal year. Our Consolidated Financial Statements include the accounts of Intel 
and our wholly owned and majority-owned subsidiaries, which include entities consolidated under the variable interest and voting interest 
models. We have eliminated intercompany accounts and transactions. We have reclassified certain prior period amounts to conform to 
current period presentation.
Use of Estimates
The preparation of Consolidated Financial Statements in conformity with US GAAP requires us to make estimates and judgments that 
affect the amounts reported in our Consolidated Financial Statements and the accompanying notes. The actual results that we experience 
may differ materially from our estimates.
Note 2 : Accounting Policies
Revenue Recognition
We recognize net product revenue when we satisfy performance obligations as evidenced by the transfer of control of our products or 
services to customers. Substantially all of our revenue is derived from product sales. Our products often include a software component, 
such as firmware, that is highly interdependent and interrelated with the product and is substantially accounted for as a combined 
performance obligation. In accordance with contract terms, the revenue for combined performance obligations and standalone product 
sales is recognized at the time of product shipment from our facilities or delivery to the customer location, as determined by the agreed-
upon shipping terms. 
We measure revenue based on the amount of consideration we expect to be entitled to in exchange for products or services. Variable 
consideration is estimated and reflected as an adjustment to the transaction price. We determine variable consideration, which consists 
primarily of various sales price concessions, by estimating the most likely amount of consideration we expect to receive from the customer 
based on historical analysis of customer purchase volumes. Sales rebates earned by customers are offset against their receivable 
balances. Rebates earned by customers when they do not have outstanding receivable balances are recorded within other accrued 
liabilities.
We make payments to our customers through cooperative advertising programs for marketing activities for some of our products. We 
generally record the payment as a reduction in revenue in the period that the revenue is earned, unless the payment is for a distinct 
service, which we record as an expense when the marketing activities occur.
Inventories
We compute inventory cost on a first-in, first-out basis. Our process and product development life cycle corresponds with substantive 
engineering milestones. These engineering milestones are regularly and consistently applied in assessing the point at which our activities 
and associated costs change in nature from R&D to cost of sales, and when cost of sales can be capitalized as inventory. 
For a product to be manufactured in high volumes and sold to our customers under our standard warranty, it must meet our rigorous 
technical quality specifications. This milestone is known as PRQ. We have identified PRQ as the point at which the costs incurred to 
manufacture our products are included in the valuation of inventory. A single PRQ has previously valued inventory up to $870 million in the 
quarter the PRQ milestone was achieved. Prior to PRQ, costs that do not meet the criteria for R&D are included in cost of sales in the 
period incurred.
The valuation of inventory includes determining which fixed production overhead costs can be included in inventory based on the normal 
capacity of our manufacturing and assembly and test facilities. We apply our historical loading compared to our total available capacity in 
a statistical model to determine our expectations of normal capacity level. If the factory loading is below the established normal capacity 
level, a portion of our fixed production overhead costs would not be included in the cost of inventory; instead, it would be recognized as 
cost of sales in that period. We refer to these costs as excess capacity charges. Excess capacity charges were $834 million in 2023, 
$423 million in 2022, and insignificant in 2021.
Inventory is valued at the lower of cost or net realizable value, based upon assumptions about future demand and market conditions. 
Product-specific facts and circumstances reviewed in the inventory valuation process include a review of our customer base, the stage of 
the product life cycle, variations in market pricing, and an assessment of selling price in relation to product cost. Lower of cost or net 
realizable value inventory reserves fluctuate as we ramp new process technologies, with costs generally improving over time due to scale 
and improved yields. Additionally, inventory valuation is impacted by cyclical changes in market conditions and the associated pricing 
environment.
 
Financial Statements
Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements
79


The valuation of inventory also requires us to estimate obsolete and excess inventory, as well as inventory that is not of saleable quality. 
We use a demand forecast to develop our short-term manufacturing plans to enable consistency between inventory valuations and build 
decisions. For certain new products, we have limited historical data when developing these demand forecasts. We compare the estimate 
of future demand to work in process and finished goods inventory levels to determine the amount, if any, of obsolete or excess inventory. 
When our demand forecast for specific products is greater than actual demand and we fail to reduce manufacturing output accordingly, we 
write off amounts considered to be excess inventory. 
Long-Lived Assets
Property, Plant, and Equipment
We compute depreciation using the straight-line method over the estimated useful life of assets. We also capitalize interest on borrowings 
related to eligible capital expenditures. Capitalized interest is added to the cost of qualified assets and depreciated together with that 
asset cost. 
At least annually, we evaluate the period over which we expect to recover the economic value of our property, plant, and equipment, 
considering factors such as the process technology cadence between node transitions, changes in machinery and equipment technology, 
and re-use of machinery and tools across each generation of process technology. As we make manufacturing process conversions and 
other factory planning decisions, we use assumptions involving the use of management judgments regarding the remaining useful lives of 
assets, primarily process-specific semiconductor manufacturing tools and building improvements. When we determine that the useful lives 
of assets are shorter or longer than we had originally estimated, we adjust the rate of depreciation to reflect the assets' revised useful 
lives. Effective January 2023, the estimated useful lives of certain machinery and equipment in our wafer fabrication facilities were 
increased from 5 to 8 years. This change in estimate was applied prospectively beginning in the first quarter of 2023.
Assets are categorized and evaluated for impairment at the lowest level of identifiable cash flows. Factors that we consider in deciding 
when to perform an impairment review include significant under-performance of a business or product line in relation to expectations, 
significant negative industry or economic trends, and significant changes or planned changes in our use and fungibility of the assets. If an 
asset grouping carrying value is not recoverable through the related undiscounted cash flows, the asset grouping is considered to be 
impaired.
Identified Intangible Assets
We amortize acquisition-related intangible assets that are subject to amortization over their estimated useful lives. Acquisition-related, in-
process R&D assets represent the fair value of incomplete R&D projects that had not reached technological feasibility as of the date of 
acquisition; initially, these are classified as in-process R&D and are not subject to amortization. Once these R&D projects are completed, 
the asset balances are transferred from in-process R&D to acquisition-related developed technology and are subject to amortization from 
that point forward. The asset balances relating to projects that are abandoned after acquisition are impaired and expensed to R&D.
We perform periodic reviews of significant finite-lived identified intangible assets to determine whether facts and circumstances indicate 
that the carrying amount may not be recoverable. These reviews can be affected by various factors, including external factors such as 
industry and economic trends, and internal factors such as changes in our business strategy and our forecasts for specific product lines. 
Periodically, we also evaluate the estimated remaining useful lives of purchased intangible assets and whether events or changes in 
circumstances warrant a revision to the remaining periods of amortization. We may adjust the period over which these assets are 
amortized to reflect the period in which they contribute to our cash flows.
Goodwill
Our reporting units are the same as our operating segments. We evaluate our reporting units annually or when triggered, such as upon 
reorganization of our operating segments. We perform an annual impairment assessment of goodwill at the reporting unit level in the 
fourth quarter of each year, or more frequently if indicators of potential impairment exist. The reporting unit's carrying value used in an 
impairment assessment represents the assignment of various assets and liabilities, excluding certain corporate assets and liabilities, such 
as cash, investments, and debt. The impairment assessment may include both qualitative and quantitative factors to assess the likelihood 
of an impairment.
Qualitative factors used include industry and market considerations, overall financial performance, and other relevant events and factors 
affecting the reporting unit. We may also perform a quantitative analysis to support the qualitative factors by applying sensitivities to 
assumptions and inputs used in measuring a reporting unit's fair value.
Our quantitative impairment assessment considers both the income approach and the market approach to estimate a reporting unit's fair 
value. Significant estimates include market segment growth rates, our assumed market segment share, estimated gross margins, 
operating expenses, and discount rates based on a reporting unit's weighted average cost of capital. We test the reasonableness of the 
inputs and outcomes of our discounted cash flow analysis against available market data. These estimates change from year to year 
based on operating results, market conditions, and other factors and could materially affect the determination of each reporting unit's fair 
value and potential goodwill impairment for each reporting unit. Our quantitative assessment is sensitive to changes in underlying 
estimates and assumptions, the most sensitive of which is the discount rate.

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements

We test the reasonableness of the inputs and outcomes of our discounted cash flow analysis against available market data. In 2023, the 
fair value for all of our reporting units exceeded their carrying value, and our annual qualitative assessment did not indicate that a more 
detailed quantitative analysis was necessary.
Government Incentives
Government incentives, including cash grants and refundable tax credits, are recognized when there is reasonable assurance that the 
incentive will be received and we will comply with the conditions specified in the agreement or statutory requirements. We record capital-
related incentives as a reduction to property, plant, and equipment, net within our Consolidated Balance Sheets and recognize a reduction 
to depreciation expense over the useful life of the corresponding acquired asset. We record operating-related incentives as a reduction to 
expense in the same line item on the Consolidated Statements of Income as the expenditure for which the incentive is intended to 
compensate.
Fair Value
When determining fair value, we consider the principal or most advantageous market in which we would transact, as well as assumptions 
that market participants would use when pricing the asset or liability. Our financial assets are measured and recorded at fair value on a 
recurring basis, except for equity securities measured using the measurement alternative, equity method investments, and grants 
receivable. We assess fair value hierarchy levels for our issued debt and fixed-income investment portfolio based on the underlying 
instrument type.
The three levels of inputs that may be used to measure fair value are: 
▪
Level 1. Quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities. We evaluate security-specific market data when determining 
whether a market is active.
▪
Level 2. Observable inputs other than Level 1 prices, such as quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities, quoted prices in less active 
markets, or model-derived valuations. All significant inputs used in our valuations, such as discounted cash flows, are observable or 
can be derived principally from or corroborated with observable market data for substantially the full term of the assets or liabilities. 
We use yield curves, overnight indexed swap curves, currency spot and forward rates, and credit ratings as significant inputs in our 
valuations. Level 2 inputs also include non-binding market consensus prices, as well as quoted prices that were adjusted for security-
specific restrictions. When we use non-binding market consensus prices, we corroborate them with quoted market prices for similar 
instruments or compare them to output from internally developed pricing models such as discounted cash flow models.
▪
Level 3. Unobservable inputs to the valuation methodology that are significant to the measurement of the fair value of assets or 
liabilities. We monitor and review the inputs and results of these valuation models to help confirm that the fair value measurements 
are reasonable and consistent with market experience in similar asset classes. Level 3 inputs also include non-binding market 
consensus prices or non-binding broker quotes that we were unable to corroborate with observable market data.
Debt Investments
Debt investments include investments in corporate debt, government debt, and financial institution instruments. Unhedged debt 
investments with original maturities of approximately three months or less from the date of purchase are classified within cash and cash 
equivalents. Unhedged debt investments with original maturities at the date of purchase greater than approximately three months and all 
economically hedged debt investments are classified as short-term investments, as they represent the investment of cash available for 
current operations. 
For certain of our marketable debt investments, we economically hedge market risks at inception with a related derivative instrument, or 
the marketable debt investment itself is used to economically hedge currency exchange rate risk from remeasurement. These hedged 
investments are reported at fair value. Gains or losses on these investments arising from changes in fair value due to interest rate and 
currency market fluctuations and credit market volatility, largely offset by losses or gains on the related derivative instruments and balance 
sheet remeasurement, are recorded in interest and other, net. Our remaining unhedged marketable debt investments are reported at fair 
value, with unrealized gains or losses, net of tax, recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss). We determine the cost of 
the investment sold based on an average cost basis at the individual security level and record the interest income and realized gains or 
losses on the sale of these investments in interest and other, net.
Unhedged debt investments are subject to periodic impairment reviews. For investments in an unrealized loss position, we determine 
whether a credit loss exists by considering information about the collectability of the instrument, current market conditions, and reasonable 
and supportable forecasts of economic conditions. We recognize an allowance for credit losses, up to the amount of the unrealized loss 
when appropriate, and write down the amortized cost basis of the investment if it is more likely than not we will be required or we intend to 
sell the investment before recovery of its amortized cost basis. Allowances for credit losses and write-downs are recognized in interest 
and other, net, and unrealized losses not related to credit losses are recognized in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss).

Equity Investments
We regularly invest in equity securities of public and private companies to promote business and strategic objectives. Equity investments 
are measured and recorded as follows: 
▪
Marketable equity securities are equity securities with RDFV that are measured and recorded at fair value on a recurring basis 
with changes in fair value, whether realized or unrealized, recorded through the income statement. 
▪
Non-marketable equity securities are equity securities without RDFV that are measured and recorded using a measurement 
alternative that measures the securities at cost minus impairment, if any, plus or minus changes resulting from qualifying 
observable price changes.
▪
Equity method investments are equity securities in investees we do not control but over which we have the ability to exercise 
significant influence. Equity method investments are measured at cost minus impairment, if any, plus or minus our share of 
equity method investee income or loss. Our proportionate share of the income or loss from equity method investments is 
recognized on a one-quarter lag.
Realized and unrealized gains and losses resulting from changes in fair value or the sale of our equity investments are recorded in gains 
(losses) on equity investments, net. The carrying value of our non-marketable equity securities is adjusted for qualifying observable price 
changes resulting from the issuance of similar or identical securities in an orderly transaction by the same issuer. Determining whether an 
observed transaction is similar to a security within our portfolio requires judgment based on the rights and preferences of the securities. 
Non-marketable equity securities and equity method investments (collectively referred to as non-marketable equity investments) are also 
subject to periodic impairment reviews. Our quarterly impairment analysis considers both qualitative and quantitative factors. When 
indicators of impairment exist, we prepare quantitative assessments of the fair value of our non-marketable equity investments using both 
the market and income approaches. 
▪
Non-marketable equity securities are tested for impairment using a qualitative model similar to the model used for goodwill and 
property, plant, and equipment. Upon determining that an impairment may exist, the security's fair value is calculated and 
compared to its carrying value, and an impairment is recognized immediately if the carrying value exceeds the fair value.
▪
Equity method investments are subject to periodic impairment reviews using the other-than-temporary impairment model, which 
considers the severity and duration of a decline in fair value below cost and our ability and intent to hold the investment for a 
sufficient period of time to allow for recovery. 
Impairments of equity investments are recorded in gains (losses) on equity investments, net.
Derivative Financial Instruments
Our primary objective for holding derivative financial instruments is to manage currency exchange rate risk and interest rate risk, and, to a 
lesser extent, equity market risk, commodity price risk, and credit risk. We enter into master netting arrangements to mitigate credit risk in 
derivative transactions by permitting net settlement of transactions with the same counterparty. We also enter into collateral security 
arrangements with certain of our counterparties to exchange cash collateral when the net fair value of certain derivative instruments 
fluctuates from contractually established thresholds. For presentation on our Consolidated Balance Sheets, we do not offset fair value 
amounts recognized for derivative instruments under master netting arrangements. Our derivative financial instruments, including related 
collateral amounts, are presented at fair value on a gross basis and are included in other current assets, other long-term assets, other 
accrued liabilities, or other long-term liabilities.
Cash flow hedges use foreign currency contracts, such as currency forwards and currency interest rate swaps, to hedge exposures for 
variability in the US-dollar equivalent of non-US-dollar-denominated cash flows associated with our forecasted operating and capital 
purchases spending.
The after-tax gains or losses from the effective portion of a cash flow hedge is reported as a component of accumulated other 
comprehensive income (loss) and reclassified into earnings in the same period or periods in which the hedged transaction affects 
earnings, and in the same line item on the Consolidated Statements of Income as the impact of the hedge transaction. For foreign 
currency contracts hedging our capital purchases, forward points are excluded from the hedge effectiveness assessment, and are 
recognized in earnings in the same income statement line item used to present the earnings effect of the hedged item. If the cash flow 
hedge transactions become improbable, the corresponding amounts deferred in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) would 
be immediately reclassified to interest and other, net. Cash flows associated with these derivatives are classified in the Consolidated 
Statements of Cash Flows in the same section as the underlying item.
Fair value hedges use interest rate contracts, such as interest rate swaps, to hedge against changes in the fair value on certain of our 
fixed-rate indebtedness attributable to changes in the benchmark interest rate. The gains or losses on these hedges, as well as the 
offsetting losses or gains related to the changes in the fair value of the underlying hedged item attributable to the hedged risk, are 
recognized in earnings in the current period, primarily in interest and other, net. Cash flows associated with these derivatives are 
classified in the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows in the same section as the underlying item, primarily within net cash provided by 
(used for) financing activities.

Non-designated hedges use foreign currency contracts to economically hedge the functional currency equivalent cash flows of recognized 
monetary assets and liabilities, and non-US-dollar-denominated debt instruments classified as hedged investments. We also use interest 
rate contracts to hedge interest rate risk related to our US-dollar-denominated fixed-rate debt investments classified as hedged 
investments. The change in fair value of these derivatives is recorded through earnings in the line item on the Consolidated Statements of 
Income to which the derivatives most closely relate, primarily in interest and other, net. Changes in the fair value of the underlying assets 
and liabilities associated with the hedged risk are generally offset by the changes in the fair value of the related derivatives. 
Credit Risk
Financial instruments that potentially subject us to concentrations of credit risk consist principally of investments in debt instruments, 
derivative financial instruments, reverse repurchase agreements, and trade and other receivables. We generally place investments with 
high-credit-quality counterparties and, by policy, we limit the amount of credit exposure to any one counterparty based on our analysis of 
that counterparty's relative credit standing. As required per our investment policy, substantially all of our investments in debt instruments 
are in investment-grade instruments. Credit-rating criteria for derivative instruments are similar to those for other investments. 
We enter into master netting arrangements to mitigate credit risk in derivative transactions by permitting net settlement of transactions 
with the same counterparty. Due to master netting arrangements, the amounts subject to credit risk related to derivative instruments are 
generally limited to the amounts, if any, by which the counterparty's obligations exceed our obligations with that counterparty. As of 
December 30, 2023, our total credit exposure to any single counterparty, excluding money market funds invested in US treasury and US 
agency securities and reverse repurchase agreements collateralized by treasury and agency securities, did not exceed $1.6 billion. To 
further reduce credit risk, we enter into collateral security arrangements with certain of our derivative counterparties and obtain and secure 
collateral from counterparties against obligations, including securities lending transactions when we deem it appropriate. Cash collateral 
exchanged under our collateral security arrangements is included in other current assets, other long-term assets, other accrued liabilities, 
or other long-term liabilities. For reverse repurchase agreements collateralized by other securities, we do not record the collateral as an 
asset or a liability unless the collateral is repledged.
A substantial majority of our trade receivables are derived from sales to OEMs and ODMs. We also have accounts receivable derived 
from sales to industrial and communications equipment manufacturers in the computing and communications industries. We believe the 
net accounts receivable balances from our three largest customers (50% as of December 30, 2023) do not represent a significant credit 
risk, based on cash flow forecasts, balance sheet analysis, and past collection experience. 
We have adopted credit policies and standards intended to accommodate industry growth and inherent risk. We believe credit risks are 
moderated by the financial stability of our major customers. We assess credit risk through quantitative and qualitative analysis. From this 
analysis, we establish shipping and credit limits and determine whether we will seek to use one or more credit support protection devices, 
such as obtaining a parent guarantee, standby letter of credit, or credit insurance.
Variable Interest Entities
We have economic interests in entities that are VIEs. If we conclude we are the primary beneficiary of the VIE, we are required to 
consolidate the entity in our financial statements. To determine if we are the primary beneficiary, we evaluate whether we have the power 
to direct the activities that most significantly impact the VIE's economic performance and the obligation to absorb losses or the right to 
receive benefits of the VIE that could potentially be significant to the VIE. Our evaluation includes identification of significant activities and 
an assessment of our ability to direct those activities based on governance provisions and arrangements to provide services to the VIE. 
Periodically, we assess whether any changes in our interest or relationship with the entity affect our determination of whether the entity is 
a VIE and, if so, whether we are the primary beneficiary.
Non-Controlling Interests
Our Consolidated Financial Statements include the accounts of majority-owned subsidiaries consolidated under the variable interest and 
voting interest models. Non-controlling interests represent the portion of equity not attributable to Intel and are reported as a separate 
component of equity, net of tax and transaction costs, on our Consolidated Balance Sheets. Net income (loss) and comprehensive income 
(loss) for majority-owned subsidiaries are attributed to Intel and to non-controlling interest holders on our Consolidated Statements of 
Income and Consolidated Statements of Comprehensive Income based on respective ownership percentages. We account for changes in 
ownership of our majority-owned subsidiaries as equity transactions when we retain a controlling financial interest.

Business Combinations
We allocate the purchase price paid for assets acquired and liabilities assumed in connection with our acquisitions based on their 
estimated fair values at the time of acquisition. This allocation involves a number of assumptions, estimates, and judgments in 
determining the fair value of the following:
▪
inventory; property, plant, and equipment; pre-existing liabilities or legal claims; and contingent consideration; each as may be 
applicable; 
▪
intangible assets, including the valuation methodology, estimations of future cash flows, discount rates, market segment growth 
rates, and our assumed market segment share, as well as the estimated useful life of intangible assets;
▪
deferred tax assets and liabilities, uncertain tax positions, and tax-related valuation allowances, which are initially estimated as of 
the acquisition date; and
▪
goodwill as measured as the excess of consideration transferred over the net of the acquisition date fair values of the assets 
acquired and the liabilities assumed.
Our assumptions and estimates are based upon comparable market data and information obtained from our management and the 
management of the acquired companies. These assumptions and estimates are used to value assets acquired and liabilities assumed, 
and to allocate goodwill to the reporting units of the business that are expected to benefit from the business combination. During the 
measurement period, which may be up to one year from the business acquisition date, we may recognize adjustments to the assets 
acquired, liabilities assumed, and related goodwill.
Employee Equity Incentive Plans
We use the straight-line amortization method to recognize share-based compensation expense over the service period of the award, net 
of estimated forfeitures. Upon exercise, cancellation, forfeiture, or expiration of stock options, or upon vesting or forfeiture of RSUs, we 
eliminate deferred tax assets for options and RSUs with multiple vesting dates for each vesting period on a first-in, first-out basis as if 
each vesting period were a separate award.
For the majority of RSUs granted, the number of shares of common stock issued on the date the RSUs vest is net of the minimum 
statutory withholding requirements that we pay in cash to the appropriate taxing authorities on behalf of our employees. The obligation to 
pay the relevant taxing authority is contingent upon continued employment. In addition, the amount of the obligation is unknown, as it is 
based in part on the market price of our common stock when the awards vest.
Income Taxes
We compute the provision for income taxes using the asset and liability method, under which deferred tax assets and liabilities are 
recognized for the expected future tax consequences of temporary differences between the financial reporting and tax bases of assets 
and liabilities, and for operating losses and tax credit carryforwards. We measure deferred tax assets and liabilities using the currently 
enacted tax rates that apply to taxable income in effect for the years in which those tax assets are expected to be realized or settled. 
We assess the likelihood that we will be able to recover our deferred tax assets. If recovery is not likely, we must increase our provision for 
taxes by recording a valuation allowance against the deferred tax assets that we estimate will not ultimately be recoverable. We believe 
that we will ultimately recover the deferred tax assets recorded on our Consolidated Balance Sheets. Recovery of a portion of our 
deferred tax assets is affected by management's plans with respect to holding or disposing of certain investments; therefore, such 
changes could also affect our future provision for taxes.
We recognize tax benefits from uncertain tax positions only if (based on the technical merits of the position) it is more likely than not that 
the tax positions will be sustained on examination by the tax authority. The tax benefits recognized in the financial statements from such 
positions are measured based on the largest amount that is more than 50% likely to be realized upon ultimate settlement. We recognize 
interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits within the provision for (benefit from) taxes on the Consolidated Statements of 
Income.
We recognize the tax impact of including certain foreign earnings in US taxable income as a period cost. We have recognized deferred 
income taxes for local country income and withholding taxes that could be incurred on distributions of certain non-US earnings or for 
outside basis differences in our subsidiaries, because we do not plan to indefinitely reinvest such earnings and basis differences. 
Remittances of non-US earnings are based on estimates and judgments of projected cash flow needs, as well as the working capital and 
investment requirements of our non-US and US operations. Material changes in our estimates of cash, working capital, and investment 
needs in various jurisdictions could require repatriation of indefinitely reinvested non-US earnings, which could be subject to applicable 
non-US income and withholding taxes.

Leases
Leases consist of real property and machinery and equipment. Our lease terms may include options to extend when it is reasonably 
certain that we will exercise such options. For leases for supplier capacity, we account for the lease and non-lease components as a 
single lease component. For all other leases, we account for the lease and non-lease components separately and do not include the non-
lease components in our leased assets and corresponding liabilities. Payments on leases may be fixed or variable, and variable lease 
payments are based on output of the underlying leased assets.
Loss Contingencies
We are subject to loss contingencies, including various legal and regulatory proceedings, asserted and potential claims, liabilities related 
to repair or replacement of parts in connection with product defects, as well as product warranties and potential asset impairments that 
arise in the ordinary course of business and are subject to change, including due to sudden or rapid developments in proceedings or 
claims. An estimated loss from such contingencies is recognized as a charge to income if it is probable that a liability has been incurred 
and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated. We evaluate developments that could affect prior disclosures or previously 
accrued liabilities, and make adjustments as appropriate. Significant judgment is required to determine both likelihood of there being, and 
the estimated amount of, a loss related to such matters. If one or more of these matters were resolved against us for amounts in excess of 
management's estimates of losses, our results of operations and financial condition could be materially adversely affected.
Note 3 : Operating Segments
We previously announced the organizational change to integrate AXG into CCG and DCAI. This change is intended to drive a more 
effective go-to-market capability and to accelerate the scale of these businesses, while also reducing costs. As a result, we modified our 
segment reporting in the first quarter of 2023 to align to this and certain other business reorganizations. All prior-period segment data has 
been retrospectively adjusted to reflect the way our CODM internally receives information and manages and monitors our operating 
segment performance starting in fiscal year 2023.
We manage our business through the following operating segments:
▪
Client Computing Group
▪
Data Center and AI
▪
Network and Edge 
▪
Mobileye
▪
Intel Foundry Services
We derive a substantial majority of our revenue from our principal products that incorporate various components and technologies, 
including a microprocessor and chipset, a stand-alone SoC, or a multichip package, which are based on Intel architecture. 
CCG, DCAI, and NEX are our reportable operating segments. Mobileye and IFS do not qualify as reportable operating segments; 
however, we have elected to disclose the results of these non-reportable operating segments. When we enter into federal contracts, they 
are aligned to the sponsoring operating segment. 
We have sales and marketing, manufacturing, engineering, finance, and administration groups. Expenses for these groups are generally 
allocated to the operating segments.
We have an "all other" category that includes revenue, expenses, and charges such as:
▪
results of operations from non-reportable segments not otherwise presented, and from start-up businesses that support our initiatives;
▪
historical results of operations from divested businesses; 
▪
amounts included within restructuring and other charges; 
▪
employee benefits, compensation, impairment charges, and other expenses not allocated to the operating segments; and 
▪
acquisition-related costs, including amortization and any impairment of acquisition-related intangibles and goodwill. 
The CODM, who is our CEO, allocates resources to and assesses the performance of each operating segment using information about 
the operating segment's revenue and operating income (loss). The CODM does not evaluate operating segments using discrete asset 
information, and we do not identify or allocate assets by operating segments. Based on the interchangeable nature of our manufacturing 
and assembly and test assets, most of the related depreciation expense is not directly identifiable within our operating segments, as it is 
included in overhead cost pools and subsequently absorbed into inventory as each product passes through our manufacturing process. 
Because our products are then sold across multiple operating segments, it is impracticable to determine the total depreciation expense 
included as a component of each operating segment's operating income (loss) results. We do not allocate gains and losses from equity 
investments, interest and other income, share-based compensation, or taxes to our operating segments. Although the CODM uses 
operating income (loss) to evaluate the segments, operating costs included in one segment may benefit other segments. The accounting 
policies for segment reporting are the same as for Intel as a whole.

In 2022, we initiated the wind-down of our Intel Optane memory business, which is part of our DCAI operating segment. While Intel 
Optane is a leading technology, it was not aligned to our strategic priorities. Separately, we continue to embrace the CXL standard. As a 
result, we recognized an inventory impairment of $723 million in cost of sales on the Consolidated Statements of Income in 2022. The 
impairment charge is recognized as a corporate charge in the "all other" category presented above.

Semiconductor Co-Investment Program
In 2022, we closed a transaction with Brookfield Asset Management (Brookfield) resulting in the formation of Arizona Fab LLC (Arizona 
Fab), a VIE that we consolidate into our financial statements because we are the primary beneficiary. Generally, contributions will be 
made to, and distributions will be received from, Arizona Fab based on both parties' proportional ownership. We will be the sole operator 
of two new chip factories that will be constructed by Arizona Fab, and we will have the right to purchase 100% of the related factory 
output. Once production commences, we will be required to operate Arizona Fab at minimum production levels measured in wafer starts 
per week and will be required to limit excess inventory held on site, or we will be subject to certain penalties.
We have an unrecognized commitment to fund our respective share of the total construction costs of Arizona Fab of $29.0 billion.
As of December 30, 2023, a substantial majority of the assets of Arizona Fab consisted of property, plant, and equipment. The assets held 
by Arizona Fab, which can be used only to settle obligations of the VIE and are not available to us, were $4.8 billion as of December 30, 
2023 ($1.8 billion as of December 31, 2022). 
Mobileye
In 2022, Mobileye completed its IPO and certain other equity financing transactions that resulted in net proceeds of $1.0 billion. During the 
second quarter of 2023, we converted 38.5 million of our Mobileye Class B shares into Class A shares, representing 5% of Mobileye's 
outstanding capital stock, and subsequently sold the Class A shares for $42 per share as part of a secondary offering, receiving net 
proceeds of $1.6 billion and increasing our capital in excess of par value by $663 million, net of tax. We continue to consolidate the results 
of Mobileye into our consolidated financial statements. 
IMS Nanofabrication 
In the third and fourth quarters of 2023, we closed agreements to sell a combined 32% minority stake in our IMS business, a business 
within our IFS operating segment —including a 20% stake to Bain Capital and a 10% stake to TSMC. Net proceeds resulting from the 
minority stake sales totaled $1.4 billion, and our capital in excess of par value increased by $958 million, net of tax. We continue to 
consolidate the results of IMS into our consolidated financial statements.

We computed diluted earnings per share of common stock based on the weighted average number of shares of common stock 
outstanding plus potentially dilutive shares of common stock outstanding during the period. Potentially dilutive shares of common stock 
from employee incentive plans are determined by applying the treasury stock method to the assumed exercise of outstanding stock 
options, the assumed vesting of outstanding RSUs, and the assumed issuance of common stock under the 2006 ESPP.
During 2022, 70 million RSUs and stock options, as calculated on a weighted average basis for the year, were excluded from the 
computation of diluted earnings per share in the table above because they would have been anti-dilutive. These RSUs and options could 
potentially be included in the diluted earnings per share calculation in the future if the average market value of the common shares 
increases above the exercise price. For all other periods presented, securities that would have been anti-dilutive were insignificant and 
have been excluded from the computation of diluted earnings per share.
Note 6 : Other Financial Statement Details
Accounts Receivable
We sell certain of our accounts receivable on a non-recourse basis to third-party financial institutions. We record these transactions as 
sales of receivables and present cash proceeds as cash flows provided by operating activities in the Consolidated Statements of Cash 
Flows. Accounts receivable sold under non-recourse factoring arrangements were $2.0 billion during 2023 and $665 million during 2022. 
After the sale of our accounts receivable, we expect to collect payment from the customers and remit it to the third-party financial 
institution.

Our depreciable property, plant, and equipment assets are depreciated over the following estimated useful lives: machinery and

production machinery and equipment from 5 to 8 years. When compared to the estimated useful life in place as of the end of 2022, we 
estimate this change increased gross margin in 2023 by approximately $2.5 billion and decreased R&D expense by approximately $400 
million. As of December 30, 2023, we estimate this change decreased ending inventory values by approximately $1.3 billion. These 
estimates are based on the assets in use and under construction as of the beginning of 2023 and are calculated at that point in time.

Government Incentives
We enter into government incentive arrangements with local, regional, and national governments, both US and non-US. These 
arrangements vary in size, duration, and conditions and allow us to maintain a market-comparable foothold across various geographies. 
These incentives are primarily structured as cash grants and refundable tax credits. Capital-related incentives have terms of up to 15 
years and operating-related incentives have terms that can vary widely. We are eligible to receive these incentives because we engage in 
qualifying capital investments, R&D, and other activities as defined by the relevant government entities. This includes qualifying capital 
investments for semiconductor wafer and advanced packaging manufacturing facilities construction and acquisition of equipment. Each 
incentive requires that we comply with certain conditions for a period that may exceed the incentive terms. These conditions can include 
achievement of future operational targets and committing to minimum levels of capital investment. If conditions are not satisfied, the 
incentives may be subject to reduction, recapture, or termination.
Capital-related incentives reduced gross property, plant, and equipment by $5.5 billion as of December 30, 2023 ($3.3 billion as of 
December 31, 2022), of which $2.2 billion was recognized in 2023 ($373 million in 2022). Capital-related incentives reduced depreciation 
expense by $226 million in 2023, of which substantially all reduced cost of sales ($230 million in 2022, all of which reduced cost of sales). 
Related incentives recognized during each period consisted of the following:
▪
US federal government pursuant to the US CHIPS and Science Act - We recognized a non-cash refundable advanced manufacturing 
investment tax credit of $845 million in 2023, which is recorded as an offset to income taxes payable. No incentives were recognized 
in 2022.
▪
US state governments - We recognized $723 million of grants in 2023 related to two new leading-edge chip factories in Ohio. No 
incentives were recognized in 2022.
▪
Non-US governments - We recognized $645 million of grants and refundable tax credits in 2023 ($373 million in 2022), a majority of 
which related to the expansion of silicon wafer manufacturing facilities in Ireland.
Operating-related incentives benefited operating income by $202 million in 2023 ($104 million in 2022), a majority of which was recorded 
in cost of sales. 
Capital-related and operating-related grants receivables totaled $559 million as of December 30, 2023 ($437 million as of December 31, 
2022), a majority of which pertained to capital-related grants and were recognized as non-cash investing activities. A substantial majority 
of the grants receivables were recorded within other long-term assets on our Consolidated Balance Sheets as of December 30, 2023 and 
as of December 31, 2022. Capital-related refundable tax credits totaled $365 million as of December 30, 2023 (no balance as of 
December 31, 2022) and were recorded within income taxes payable on our Consolidated Balance Sheets.

30, 2023 was $1.3 billion.
Litigation charges and other includes a $1.2 billion benefit in 2023 due to a reduction in the previously accrued $2.2 billion charge as a 
result of developments in the VLSI litigation in the fourth quarter of 2023. 2023 charges also include a $401 million charge for an EC-
imposed fine. In 2009, we recorded and paid an EC-imposed fine that was subsequently annulled, resulting in a benefit of $1.2 billion in 
2022. Refer to "Note 19: Commitments and Contingencies" within the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further information 
on legal proceedings related to the VLSI litigation and EC fine.
Also in 2023, we mutually agreed with Tower to terminate the agreement we entered into during 2022 to acquire Tower due to our inability 
to obtain required regulatory approvals in a timely manner. We paid a termination fee in accordance with the terms of the agreement, 
resulting in a $353 million charge included in litigation charges and other.

Our effective tax rate decreased in 2023 compared to 2022, primarily driven by our R&D tax credits, which provide a tax benefit based on 
our eligible R&D spending and are not dependent on lower income before taxes, and a higher proportion of our income being taxed in 
non-US jurisdictions.
Our effective tax rate decreased in 2022 compared to 2021, primarily driven by a higher proportion of our income being taxed in non-US 
jurisdictions and a change in tax law from 2017 Tax Reform related to the capitalization of R&D expenses that went into effect in January 
2022.
We derive the effective tax rate benefit attributed to non-US income taxed at different rates primarily from our operations in Hong Kong, 
Ireland, Israel, and Malaysia. The statutory tax rates in these jurisdictions range from 12.5% to 24.0%. We are subject to reduced tax rates 
in Israel and Malaysia as long as we conduct certain eligible activities and make certain capital investments. We have conditional reduced 
tax rates that expire at various dates through 2056, and we expect to apply for renewals upon expiration. In 2023 the tax benefit 
specifically attributable to tax holidays was $129 million ($220 million for 2022 and $187 million for 2021) with a $0.03 impact on diluted 
earnings per share ($0.05 for 2022 and $0.05 for 2021).

As of December 30, 2023, our federal and non-US net operating loss carryforwards for income tax purposes were $325 million and $1.7 
billion, respectively. The majority of the federal and non-US net operating loss carryforwards have no expiration date. The remaining 
federal and non-US net operating loss carryforwards expire at various dates through 2040. The federal and non-US net operating loss 
carryforwards include $141 million and $1.7 billion, respectively, that are not likely to be recovered and have been reduced by a valuation 
allowance.
As of December 30, 2023, we have undistributed earnings of certain foreign subsidiaries of approximately $19.9 billion that we have 
indefinitely invested, and on which we have not recognized deferred taxes. Estimating the amount of potential tax is not practicable 
because of the complexity and variety of assumptions necessary to compute the tax.

Current income taxes receivable of $59 million as of December 30, 2023 ($138 million as of December 31, 2022) are included in other 
current assets.
Long-term income taxes payable of $2.6 billion as of December 30, 2023 ($3.8 billion as of December 31, 2022) are primarily composed 
of the transition tax from Tax Reform, which is payable over eight years beginning in 2018, as well as amounts for uncertain tax positions,

If the remaining balance of unrecognized tax benefits were recognized in a future period, it would result in a tax benefit of $962 million as 
of December 30, 2023 ($914 million as of December 31, 2022) and a reduction in the effective tax rate. Interest, penalties, and accrued 
interest related to unrecognized tax benefits were insignificant in the periods presented.
We regularly engage in discussions and negotiations with tax authorities regarding tax matters in the various jurisdictions in which we 
conduct business. Although the timing of the resolutions and/or closures of audits is highly uncertain, it is reasonably possible that certain 
US federal and non-US tax audits may be concluded within the next 12 months, which could increase or decrease the balance of our 
gross unrecognized tax benefits. We estimate that the unrecognized tax benefits as of December 30, 2023 could decrease by as much as 
$314 million in the next 12 months. 
We file federal, state, and non-US tax returns. We are no longer subject to US federal and non-US tax examinations for years prior to 
2018 and 2015, respectively. For US state tax returns, we are no longer subject to tax examination for years prior to 2015.
Note 9 : 
Investments
Short-term Investments
Short-term investments include marketable debt investments in corporate debt, government debt, and financial institution instruments, and 
are recorded within cash and cash equivalents and short-term investments on the Consolidated Balance Sheets. Government debt 
includes instruments such as non-US government bills and bonds and US agency securities. Financial institution instruments include 
instruments issued or managed by financial institutions in various forms, such as commercial paper, fixed- and floating-rate bonds, money 
market fund deposits, and time deposits. As of December 30, 2023 and December 31, 2022, substantially all time deposits were issued by 
institutions outside the US. 
The fair value of our economically hedged marketable debt investments was $17.1 billion as of December 30, 2023 ($16.2 billion as of 
December 31, 2022). For hedged investments still held at the reporting date, we recorded net gains of $534 million in 2023 (net losses of 
$748 million in 2022 and net losses of $606 million in 2021). Net losses on the related derivatives were $472 million in 2023 (net gains of 
$752 million in 2022 and net gains of $609 million in 2021).
Our remaining unhedged marketable debt investments are reported at fair value, with unrealized gains or losses, net of tax, recorded in 
accumulated other comprehensive income (loss). The adjusted cost of our unhedged investments was $4.7 billion as of December 30, 
2023 ($10.2 billion as of December 31, 2022), which approximated the fair value for these periods.

Note 10 : Divestitures
NAND Memory Business
On December 29, 2021, we closed the first phase of our agreement with SK hynix Inc. (SK hynix) to divest our NAND memory business 
for $9.0 billion in cash. Our NAND memory business includes our NAND memory technology and manufacturing business (the NAND 
OpCo Business), of which we deconsolidated our ongoing interests as part of the sale. The transaction will be completed in two closings 
and upon the first closing in the first quarter of 2022, SK hynix paid $7.0 billion of consideration and we recognized a pre-tax gain of $1.0 
billion within interest and other, net, and tax expense of $495 million. We recorded a receivable in other long-term assets for the remaining 
proceeds we will receive upon the second closing of the transaction, expected to be no earlier than March 2025. The receivable 
outstanding was $2.0 billion as of December 30, 2023 and $1.9 billion December 31, 2022. 
The wafer manufacturing and sale agreement includes incentives and penalties that are contingent on the cost of operation and output of 
the NAND OpCo Business. These incentives and penalties present a maximum exposure of up to $500 million annually, and $1.5 billion in 
the aggregate. We are currently in negotiations with SK hynix to update the operating plan of the NAND OpCo Business in light of the 
current business environment and projections, which may impact the metrics associated with the incentives and penalties and our 
expectations of the performance of the NAND OpCo Business against those metrics.
We were reimbursed for costs that we incurred on behalf of the NAND OpCo Business for corporate function services, which include 
human resources, information technology, finance, supply chain, and other compliance requirements. Reimbursed expenses 
approximated $145 million in 2022 and $125 million in 2023. We recorded a receivable due from the NAND OpCo Business, a 
deconsolidated entity, of $145 million within other current assets as of December 30, 2023 ($133 million recorded as of December 31, 
2022).

As described in "Note 3: Operating Segments" within the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, we integrated AXG into CCG and 
DCAI in the first quarter of 2023. As a result, of the total $596 million of goodwill previously allocated to AXG, we reallocated $495 million 
to CCG and $101 million to DCAI based on the relative fair value of our updated operating segments. We performed a quantitative 
impairment assessment for each of our reporting units immediately before and after our business reorganization, concluding that goodwill 
was not impaired. We also reallocated $393 million of goodwill from DCAI to other businesses during 2023.
During the fourth quarter of 2023 and 2022, we completed our annual impairment assessments and concluded that goodwill was not 
impaired. During the second quarter of 2021, we recognized a goodwill impairment loss of $238 million related to two non-strategic 
businesses that we exited, recorded within our "all other" category. The accumulated impairment loss as of December 30, 2023 was $957 
million: $365 million associated with CCG, $275 million associated with DCAI, $79 million associated with NEX, and the remainder 
associated with non-reportable segments.

In the first quarter of 2022, we retrospectively adjusted all prior-period amounts in our goodwill footnote to reflect changes to our operating 
segments. We reallocated goodwill among our affected reporting units based on the relative fair value of our new operating segments. We 
performed a quantitative impairment assessment for each of our reporting units immediately before and after our business reorganization, 
concluding that goodwill was not impaired.

Senior Notes
In 2023, we issued a total of $11.0 billion aggregate principal amount of senior notes.
In 2022, we issued a total of $6.0 billion aggregate principal amount of senior notes, including our inaugural green bond issuance of $1.3 
billion principal amount, and settled in cash $1.6 billion of our senior notes that matured in May 2022, $1.0 billion of our senior notes that 
matured in July 2022, and $1.9 billion of our senior notes that matured in December 2022. We also early cash settled $400 million of our 
senior notes due November 2023.
Our fixed-rate senior notes pay interest semiannually. We may redeem the fixed-rate notes prior to their maturity at our option at specified 
redemption prices and subject to certain restrictions. The obligations under the notes rank equally in right of payment with all of our other 
existing and future senior unsecured indebtedness and will effectively rank junior to all liabilities of our subsidiaries.
Oregon and Arizona Bonds
In 2023, we remarketed $423 million aggregate principal amount of bonds issued by the Industrial Development Authority of the City of 
Chandler, Arizona (the Arizona bonds) and the State of Oregon Business Development Commission (the Oregon bonds). The bonds are 
unsecured general obligations in accordance with loan agreements we entered into with each of the Industrial Development Authority of 
the City of Chandler, Arizona (CIDA) and the State of Oregon Business Development Commission. The bonds mature in 2035 and 2040 
and have 3.8% and 4.1% coupons. Both the Arizona and Oregon bonds are subject to optional tender starting in February 2028 and 
mandatory tender in June 2028, at which time we may remarket the bonds for a new term period.
In 2022, we received proceeds of $600 million in the aggregate for the sale of bonds issued by CIDA. The bonds are our unsecured 
general obligations in accordance with the loan with the CIDA. The bonds mature in 2042 and 2052 and carry an interest rate of 5.0%. 
The bonds are subject to mandatory tender in September 2027, at which time we can re-market the bonds as either fixed-rate bonds for a 
specified period or as variable-rate bonds until another fixed-rate period is selected or until their final maturity date. We settled in cash 
$138 million of bonds issued by the Oregon Business Development Commission in March 2022. 
Revolving Credit Facilities
In 2022, we entered into a $5.0 billion, 364-day variable-rate unsecured revolving credit facility that, if drawn, is expected to be used for 
general corporate purposes. In 2023, we extended the maturity date from November 2023 to March 2024. In 2022, we amended our 
$5.0 billion variable-rate revolving credit facility agreement that we entered into in 2021, extending the maturity date by one year to March 
2027 and transitioning from LIBOR to term SOFR. In 2023, we extended the maturity date by one year to March 2028.
The revolving credit facilities had no borrowings outstanding as of December 30, 2023 and December 31, 2022.
Debt Maturities
Our aggregate debt maturities, based on outstanding principal as of December 30, 2023, by year payable, are as follows:

deposits, notes and bonds issued by financial institutions.
2. Level 1 investments consist primarily of US Treasury securities. Level 2 investments consist primarily of non-US government debt.
Assets Measured and Recorded at Fair Value on a Non-Recurring Basis
Our non-marketable equity securities, equity method investments, and certain non-financial assets—such as intangible assets and 
property, plant, and equipment—are recorded at fair value only if an impairment or observable price adjustment is recognized in the 
current period. If an impairment or observable price adjustment is recognized on our non-marketable equity securities during the period, 
we classify these assets as Level 3. 
We classify non-marketable equity securities and non-marketable equity method investments as Level 3. Impairments recognized on 
these investments held as of December 30, 2023 were $202 million ($179 million on investments held as of December 31, 2022).

Financial Assets and Liabilities Not Recorded at Fair Value on a Recurring Basis
Financial assets and liabilities not recorded at fair value on a recurring basis include non-marketable equity securities and equity method 
investments that have not been remeasured or impaired in the current period, grants receivable, long-term receivables, and issued debt. 
We classify the fair value of grants receivable, long-term receivables, and reverse repurchase agreements with original maturities greater 
than three months as Level 2. The estimated fair value of these financial assets approximates their carrying value. The aggregate carrying 
value of grants receivable as of December 30, 2023 was $559 million (the aggregate carrying value of grants receivable as of December 
31, 2022 was $437 million). The aggregate carrying value of reverse repurchase agreements with original maturities greater than three 
months as of December 30, 2023 was $0 (the aggregate carrying value as of December 31, 2022 was $400 million).
We classify the fair value of issued debt (excluding commercial paper) as Level 2. The fair value of these instruments was $47.6 billion as 
of December 30, 2023 ($34.3 billion as of December 31, 2022).

Derivatives in Cash Flow Hedging Relationships
The before-tax net gains or losses attributed to the effective portion of cash flow hedges recognized in other comprehensive income (loss) 
were $3 million net gains in 2023 ($910 million net losses in 2022 and $434 million net losses in 2021). Substantially all of our cash flow 
hedges are foreign currency contracts for all periods presented.
Amounts excluded from effectiveness testing were $221 million net losses in 2023 ($117 million net losses in 2022 and $19 million net 
losses in 2021).

Note 17 : Retirement Benefit Plans
Defined Contribution Plans
We provide tax-qualified defined contribution plans for the benefit of eligible employees, former employees, and retirees in the US and 
certain other countries. The plans are designed to provide employees with an accumulation of funds for retirement on a tax-deferred 
basis. For the benefit of eligible US employees, we also provide an unfunded non-tax-qualified supplemental deferred compensation plan 
for certain highly compensated employees. 
We expensed $272 million in 2023, $489 million in 2022, and $444 million in 2021 for matching contributions based on the amount of 
employee contributions under the US qualified defined contribution and non-qualified deferred compensation plans. The matching 
contribution in the US qualified defined contribution plan was reduced from March 1 through December 31, 2023. 
US Retiree Medical Plan
Upon retirement, we provide certain benefits to eligible US employees who were hired prior to 2014 under the US Retiree Medical Plan. 
The benefits can be used to pay all or a portion of the cost to purchase eligible coverage in a medical plan.
As of December 30, 2023 and December 31, 2022, the projected benefit obligation was $490 million and $527 million, which used the 
discount rates of 5.3% and 5.6%. The December 30, 2023 and December 31, 2022 corresponding fair value of plan assets was $548 
million and $501 million. As of December 30, 2023, the US Retiree Medical Plan was in the net asset position.
The investment strategy for US Retiree Medical Plan assets is to invest primarily in liquid assets, due to the level of expected future 
benefit payments. The assets are invested in tax-aware global equity and fixed-income long credit portfolios. Both portfolios are actively 
managed by external managers. The tax-aware global equity portfolio is composed of a diversified mix of equities in developed countries. 
The tax-aware fixed-income long credit portfolio is composed of domestic securities. The allocation to each asset class will fluctuate with 
market conditions, such as volatility and liquidity concerns, and will typically be rebalanced when outside the target ranges, which are 45% 
equity and 55% fixed-income investments. As of December 30, 2023, the majority of the US Retiree Medical Plan assets were invested in 
exchange-traded equity securities and were measured at fair value using Level 1 inputs. The remaining US Retiree Medical Plan assets 
were invested in fixed-income investments and were measured at fair value using Level 2 inputs.
As of December 30, 2023, the estimated benefit payments for this plan over the next 10 years are as follows:

Pension Benefit Plans
We provide defined-benefit pension plans in certain countries, most significantly Ireland, the US, Germany and Israel. The majority of the 
plans' benefits have been frozen. 
Benefit Obligation and Plan Assets for Pension Benefit Plans
The vested benefit obligation for a defined-benefit pension plan is the actuarial present value of the vested benefits to which the employee 
is currently entitled based on the employee's expected date of separation or retirement.

1 The projected benefit obligation was approximately 30% in the US and 70% outside of the US as of December 30, 2023 and December 31, 2022.
2 The fair value of plan assets was approximately 40% in the US and 60% outside of the US as of December 30, 2023 and December 31, 2022.
3 The accumulated other comprehensive loss (income), before tax, was approximately 70% in the US and 30% outside of the US as of December 30, 
2023 (approximately 90% in the US and 10% outside of the US as of December 31, 2022). 
Changes in actuarial gains and losses in the projected benefit obligation are generally driven by discount rate movement. We use the 
corridor approach to amortize actuarial gains and losses. Under this approach, net actuarial gains or losses in excess of 10% of the larger 
of the projected benefit obligation or the fair value of plan assets are amortized on a straight-line basis.
As of December 30, 2023, the accumulated benefit obligations were $0.8 billion and $1.9 billion for the US plan and non-US plans, 
respectively. As of December 30, 2023, the US plan was in the net asset position and the other non-US plans had projected benefit 
obligations and accumulated benefit obligations in excess of plan assets. As of December 31, 2022, the accumulated benefit obligations 
were $0.9 billion and $1.6 billion for the US plan and non-US plans, respectively. As of December 31, 2022, the US and Ireland plans 
were in the net asset position and the other non-US plans had projected benefit obligations in excess of plan assets. As of December 31, 
2022, the US, Ireland, and Israel plans had assets in excess of accumulated benefit obligations, whereas the remaining non-US plans had 
accumulated benefit obligations in excess of plan assets.

We establish the discount rate for each pension plan by analyzing current market long-term bond rates and matching the bond maturity 
with the average duration of the pension liabilities. 
We establish the expected long-term rate of return on plan assets by developing a forward-looking, long-term return assumption for each 
pension fund asset class, taking into account factors such as the expected real return for the specific asset class and inflation. A single, 
long-term rate of return is then calculated as the weighted average of the target asset allocation percentages and the long-term return 
assumption for each asset class.
Funding
Our practice is to fund the various pension plans in amounts sufficient to meet the minimum requirements of applicable local laws and 
regulations. Funding for the US Retiree Medical Plan is discretionary under applicable laws and regulations. Additional funding may be 
provided for the pension and retiree medical plans as deemed appropriate.
On a worldwide basis, our pension and retiree medical plans were 83% funded as of December 30, 2023. The US Pension Plan, which 
accounts for 26% of the worldwide pension and retiree medical benefit obligations, was 107% funded. Funded status is not indicative of 
our ability to pay ongoing pension benefits or of our obligation to fund retirement trusts. Required pension funding for US retirement plans 
is determined in accordance with ERISA, which sets required minimum contributions. Cumulative company funding to the US Pension 
Plan currently exceeds the minimum ERISA funding requirements.
Net Periodic Benefit Cost
The net periodic benefit cost for pension and US retiree medical benefits was $107 million in 2023 ($139 million in 2022 and $162 million 
in 2021).

US Plan Assets
The investment strategy for US Pension Plan assets is to manage the funded status volatility, taking into consideration the investment 
horizon and expected volatility to help enable sufficient assets to be available to pay pension benefits as they come due. The allocation to 
each asset class will fluctuate with market conditions, such as volatility and liquidity concerns, and will typically be rebalanced when 
outside the target ranges, which are 91% fixed income and 9% equity investments. During 2023, the US Pension Plan assets were 
invested in collective investment trust funds, which are measured at net asset value. 
 
Financial Statements
Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements

Non-US Plan Assets
The investments of the non-US plans are managed by insurance companies, pension funds, or third-party trustees, consistent with 
regulations or market practice of the country where the assets are invested. The investment manager makes investment decisions within 
the guidelines set by Intel or local regulations. Investments managed by qualified insurance companies or pension funds under standard 
contracts follow local regulations, and we are not actively involved in their investment strategies. For the assets that we have the 
discretion to set investment guidelines, the assets are invested in developed country equity investments and fixed-income investments, 
either through index funds or direct investment. In general, the investment strategy is designed to accumulate a diversified portfolio 
among markets, asset classes, or individual securities to reduce market risk and to help enable sufficient pension assets to be available to 
pay benefits as they come due. The equity investments in the non-US plan assets are invested in a diversified mix of equities of 
developed countries, including the US, and emerging markets throughout the world. We have control over the investment strategy related 
to the majority of the assets measured at net asset value, which are invested in hedge funds, bond index funds, and equity index funds. 
The target allocation of the non-US plan assets that we have control over was approximately 40% fixed income, 40% equity, and 20% 
hedge fund investments in 2023.

Note 18 : Employee Equity Incentive Plans
Our equity incentive plans are broad-based, long-term programs intended to attract and retain talented employees and align stockholder 
and employee interests. Our plans include our 2006 Plan and our 2006 ESPP.
Under the 2006 Plan, 1.1 billion shares of common stock have been authorized for issuance as equity awards to employees and non-
employee directors through June 2026. As of December 30, 2023, 194 million shares of common stock remained available for future 
grants.
Under the 2006 Plan, we may grant RSUs and stock options. We grant RSUs with a service condition as well as RSUs with a market 
condition, performance condition, and a service condition, which we call PSUs. PSUs are granted to a group of senior officers and 
employees. For PSUs granted in 2023 and 2022, the number of shares of our common stock to be received at vesting at the end of the 
three-year performance period will range from 0% to 200% of the target grant amount. The PSU payout will be determined based on our 
performance (i) relative to annual targets for each year in the performance period with respect to a revenue growth metric, weighted 60%, 
and a cash flow from operations metric, weighted 40%, which results are then averaged at the end of the three-year performance period; 
and (ii) as may be adjusted by two equally weighted modifiers: the TSR of our common stock measured against the benchmark TSR of 
above median of the S&P 500 Index over a three-year period and revenue CAGR for the three-year performance period. TSR is a 
measure of stock price appreciation plus any dividends paid in this performance period. For 2023 PSUs, overall payout will be capped at 
target grant amount if our absolute TSR is negative. As of December 30, 2023, 16 million PSUs were outstanding. PSUs vest three years 
and one month following the start of the performance period. Other RSU awards and option awards generally vest over four years from 
the grant date. 
Share-Based Compensation
Share-based compensation recognized in 2023 was $3.2 billion ($3.1 billion in 2022 and $2.0 billion in 2021). During 2023, the tax benefit 
that we realized for the tax deduction from share-based awards totaled $571 million ($478 million in 2022 and $377 million in 2021).
We estimate the fair value of RSUs and PSUs with a service condition or performance condition using the value of our common stock on 
the date of grant, reduced by the present value of dividends expected to be paid on our shares of common stock prior to vesting. We 
estimate the fair value of PSUs with a market condition using a Monte Carlo simulation model as of the date of grant using historical 
volatility.

The aggregate fair value of awards that vested in 2023 was $2.2 billion ($2.0 billion in 2022 and $1.7 billion in 2021), which represents the 
market value of our common stock on the date that the RSUs vested. The grant-date fair value of awards that vested in 2023 was $2.7 
billion ($2.5 billion in 2022 and $1.4 billion in 2021). The number of RSUs vested includes shares of common stock that we withheld on 
behalf of employees to satisfy the minimum statutory tax withholding requirements. RSUs that are expected to vest are net of estimated 
future forfeitures.
As of December 30, 2023, unrecognized compensation costs related to RSUs granted under our equity incentive plans were $4.0 billion. 
We expect to recognize those costs over a weighted average period of 1.3 years.
Stock Purchase Plan
The 2006 ESPP allows eligible employees to purchase shares of our common stock at 85% of the value of our common stock on specific 
dates. Under the 2006 ESPP, 523 million shares of common stock are authorized for issuance through August 2026. As of December 30, 
2023, 157 million shares of common stock remained available for issuance.
Employees purchased 43 million shares of common stock in 2023 for $1.0 billion under the 2006 ESPP (27 million shares of common 
stock for $931 million in 2022 and 22 million shares of common stock for $925 million in 2021). As of December 30, 2023, unrecognized 
share-based compensation costs related to rights to acquire shares of common stock under the 2006 ESPP totaled $57 million. We 
expect to recognize those costs over a period of approximately two months.

Note 19 : Commitments and Contingencies
Leases
We recognized operating leased assets in other long-term assets of $505 million and corresponding accrued liabilities of $142 million, and 
other long-term liabilities of $289 million as of December 30, 2023. Our operating leases have remaining terms of 1 to 13 years and may 
include options to extend the leases for up to 38 years. The weighted average remaining lease term was 6.0 years, and the weighted 
average discount rate was 5.0% as of December 30, 2023, for our operating leases. 
Operating lease expense was $407 million in 2023 ($729 million in 2022 and $798 million in 2021), including $213 million in variable lease 
expense in 2023 ($551 million in 2022 and $620 million in 2021).
In 2022 and 2021, we signed finance leases for supplier capacity. The leases will commence upon start of supplier production and will 
have a weighted average remaining lease term of 6.0 years upon commencement. We recognized finance leased assets in property, 
plant, and equipment of $619 million as of December 30, 2023 ($430 million as of December 31, 2022).
Discounted and undiscounted lease payments under non-cancelable leases as of December 30, 2023 were as follows:

Commitments
Commitments for capital expenditures totaled $27.5 billion as of December 30, 2023, ($31.0 billion as of December 31, 2022), a 
substantial majority of which will be due within the next 12 months. Other purchase obligations and commitments totaled approximately 
$8.3 billion as of December 30, 2023 (approximately $10.7 billion as of December 31, 2022). 
Other purchase obligations and commitments include payments due under supply agreements and various types of licenses and 
agreements to purchase goods or services. Contractual obligations for purchases of goods or services relate to agreements that are 
enforceable and legally binding and that specify all significant terms, including fixed or minimum quantities; fixed, minimum, or variable 
price provisions; and the approximate timing of the transaction. Other purchase obligations reflect the non-cancelable portion or the 
minimum cancellation fee under the agreement. 
Other purchase commitments also include our unrecognized commitment to fund our respective share of the total construction costs of 
$29.0 billion of Arizona Fab in connection with the definitive agreement entered into with Brookfield. Our remaining unfunded contribution 
was $12.3 billion as of December 30, 2023. 
Legal Proceedings
We are regularly party to various ongoing claims, litigation, and other proceedings, including those noted in this section. As of December 
30, 2023, we have accrued a charge of $1.0 billion related to litigation involving VLSI and a charge of $401 million related to an EC-
imposed fine, both as described below. Excluding the VLSI claims described below, management at present believes that the ultimate 
outcome of these proceedings, individually and in the aggregate, will not materially harm our financial position, results of operations, cash 
flows, or overall trends; however, legal proceedings and related government investigations are subject to inherent uncertainties, and 
unfavorable rulings, excessive verdicts, or other events could occur. Unfavorable resolutions could include substantial monetary damages, 
fines, or penalties. Certain of these outstanding matters include speculative, substantial, or indeterminate monetary awards. In addition, in 
matters for which injunctive relief or other conduct remedies are sought, unfavorable resolutions could include an injunction or other order 
prohibiting us from selling one or more products at all or in particular ways, precluding particular business practices, or requiring other 
remedies. An unfavorable outcome may result in a material adverse impact on our business, results of operations, financial position, and 
overall trends. We might also conclude that settling one or more such matters is in the best interests of our stockholders, employees, and 
customers, and any such settlement could include substantial payments. Except as specifically described below, we have not concluded 
that settlement of any of the legal proceedings noted in this section is appropriate at this time. 
European Commission Competition Matter
In 2009, the EC found that we had used unfair business practices to persuade customers to buy microprocessors in violation of Article 82 
of the EC Treaty (later renumbered Article 102) and Article 54 of the European Economic Area Agreement. In general, the EC found that 
we violated Article 82 by offering alleged “conditional rebates and payments” that required customers to purchase all or most of their x86 
microprocessors from us and by making alleged “payments to prevent sales of specific rival products.” The EC ordered us to end the 
alleged infringement referred to in its decision and imposed a €1.1 billion fine, which we paid in the third quarter of 2009. 
 
Financial Statements
Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements
108


We appealed the EC decision to the European Court of Justice in 2014, after the General Court (then called the Court of First Instance) 
rejected our appeal of the EC decision in its entirety. In September 2017, the Court of Justice sent the case back to the General Court to 
examine whether the rebates at issue were capable of restricting competition. In January 2022, the General Court annulled the EC’s 2009 
findings against us regarding rebates, as well as the €1.1 billion fine imposed on Intel, which was returned to us in February 2022. The 
General Court’s January 2022 decision did not annul the EC’s 2009 finding that we made payments to prevent sales of specific rival 
products.
In April 2022, the EC appealed the General Court’s decision to the Court of Justice. In addition, in September 2023 the EC imposed a 
€376 million ($401 million) fine against us based on its finding that we made payments to prevent sales of specific rival products. We have 
appealed the EC’s decision. We have accrued a charge for the fine and are unable to make a reasonable estimate of the potential loss or 
range of losses in excess of this amount given the procedural posture and the nature of these proceedings. 
In a related matter, in April 2022 we filed applications with the General Court seeking an order requiring the EC to pay us approximately 
€593 million in default interest on the original €1.1 billion fine that was held by the EC for 12 years, which applications have been stayed 
pending the EC’s appeal of the General Court’s January 2022 decision.
Litigation Related to Security Vulnerabilities
In June 2017, a Google research team notified Intel and other companies that it had identified security vulnerabilities, the first variants of 
which are now commonly referred to as “Spectre” and “Meltdown,” that affect many types of microprocessors, including our products. As 
is standard when findings like these are presented, we worked together with other companies in the industry to verify the research and 
develop and validate software and firmware updates for impacted technologies. In January 2018, information on the security 
vulnerabilities was publicly reported, before software and firmware updates to address the vulnerabilities were made widely available.
As of January 24, 2024, consumer class action lawsuits against us were pending in the US, Canada, and Argentina. The plaintiffs, who 
purport to represent various classes of purchasers of our products, generally claim to have been harmed by our actions and/or omissions 
in connection with Spectre, Meltdown, and other variants of this class of security vulnerabilities that have been identified since 2018, and 
assert a variety of common law and statutory claims seeking monetary damages and equitable relief. In the US, class action suits filed in 
various jurisdictions were consolidated for all pretrial proceedings in the US District Court for the District of Oregon, which entered final 
judgment in favor of Intel in July 2022 based on plaintiffs’ failure to plead a viable claim. Plaintiffs appealed, and in November 2023 the 
Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals affirmed the district court’s judgment. In Canada, an initial status conference has not yet been scheduled in 
one case relating to Spectre and Meltdown pending in the Superior Court of Justice of Ontario, and a stay of a second case pending in the 
Superior Court of Justice of Quebec is in effect. In Argentina, Intel Argentina was served with, and responded to, a class action complaint 
relating to Spectre and Meltdown in June 2022. The Argentinian court dismissed plaintiffs’ claims for lack of standing in May 2023, and 
plaintiffs have appealed. In November 2023, new plaintiffs filed a consumer class action complaint in the US District Court for the Northern 
District of California with respect to a further vulnerability variant disclosed in August 2023 and commonly referred to as “Downfall.” We 
moved to dismiss that complaint in January 2024. Additional lawsuits and claims may be asserted seeking monetary damages or other 
related relief. Given the procedural posture and the nature of these cases, including that the pending proceedings are in the early stages, 
that alleged damages have not been specified, that uncertainty exists as to the likelihood of a class or classes being certified or the 
ultimate size of any class or classes if certified, and that there are significant factual and legal issues to be resolved, we are unable to 
make a reasonable estimate of the potential loss or range of losses, if any, that might arise from these matters. 
Litigation Related to 7nm Product Delay Announcement
Multiple securities class action lawsuits were filed in the US District Court for the Northern District of California against us and certain 
officers following our July 2020 announcement of 7nm product delays. The court consolidated the lawsuits and appointed lead plaintiffs in 
October 2020, and in January 2021 plaintiffs filed a consolidated complaint. Plaintiffs purport to represent all persons who purchased or 
otherwise acquired our common stock from October 25, 2019 through October 23, 2020, and they generally allege that defendants 
violated the federal securities laws by making false or misleading statements about the timeline for 7nm products. In March 2023, the 
court granted the defendants’ motion to dismiss the consolidated complaint, and in April 2023 entered judgment. Plaintiffs have appealed. 
Given the procedural posture and the nature of the case, including that it is in the early stages, that alleged damages have not been 
specified, that uncertainty exists as to the likelihood of a class being certified or the ultimate size of any class if certified, and that there are 
significant factual and legal issues to be resolved, we are unable to make a reasonable estimate of the potential loss or range of losses, if 
any, that might arise from the matter. In July 2021, we introduced a new process node naming structure, and the 7nm process is now 
called Intel 4.
Litigation Related to Patent and IP Claims
We have had IP infringement lawsuits filed against us, including but not limited to those discussed below. Most involve claims that certain 
of our products, services, and technologies infringe others' IP rights. Adverse results in these lawsuits may include awards of substantial 
fines and penalties, costly royalty or licensing agreements, or orders preventing us from offering certain features, functionalities, products, 
or services. As a result, we may have to change our business practices, and develop non-infringing products or technologies, which could 
result in a loss of revenue for us and otherwise harm our business. In addition, certain agreements with our customers require us to 
indemnify them against certain IP infringement claims, which can increase our costs as a result of defending such claims, and may require 
that we pay significant damages, accept product returns, or supply our customers with non-infringing products if there were an adverse 
ruling in any such claims. In addition, our customers and partners may discontinue the use of our products, services, and technologies, as 
a result of injunctions or otherwise, which could result in loss of revenue and adversely affect our business.

VLSI Technology LLC v. Intel 
In October 2017, VLSI Technology LLC (VLSI) filed a complaint against us in the US District Court for the Northern District of California 
alleging that various Intel FPGA and processor products infringe eight patents VLSI acquired from NXP Semiconductors, N.V. (NXP). VLSI 
granted Intel a covenant not to sue on the two patents the court said can proceed to trial as it appeals losses it suffered earlier in the case 
on three other patents. VLSI has requested that the judge take the trial scheduled for March 2024 off calendar.  In April 2019, VLSI filed 
three infringement suits against us in the US District Court for the Western District of Texas accusing various of our processors of 
infringement of eight additional patents it had acquired from NXP:
▪
The first Texas case went to trial in February 2021, and the jury awarded VLSI $1.5 billion for literal infringement of one patent 
and $675 million for infringement of another patent under the doctrine of equivalents. In April 2022, the court entered final 
judgment, awarding VLSI $2.1 billion in damages and approximately $162.3 million in pre-judgment and post-judgment interest. 
We appealed the judgment to the Federal Circuit Court of Appeals, including the court’s rejection of Intel’s claim to have a license 
from Fortress Investment Group’s acquisition of Finjan. The Federal Circuit Court heard oral argument in October 2023. In 
December 2023, the Federal Circuit reversed the finding of infringement as to the patent for which VLSI was awarded $675 
million. The Federal Circuit affirmed the finding of infringement as to the patent for which VLSI had been awarded $1.5 billion, but 
vacated the damages award and will send the case back to the trial court for further damages proceedings on that patent. The 
Federal Circuit also ruled that Intel can advance the defense that it is licensed to VLSI’s patents. In December 2021 and January 
2022 the PTAB instituted IPRs on the claims found to have been infringed in the first Texas case, and in May and June 2023 
found all of those claims unpatentable; VLSI has appealed the PTAB’s decision.
▪
The second Texas case went to trial in April 2021, and the jury found that we do not infringe the asserted patents. VLSI had 
sought approximately $3.0 billion for alleged infringement, plus enhanced damages for willful infringement. The court has not yet 
entered final judgment. 
▪
The third Texas case went to trial in November 2022, with VLSI asserting one remaining patent. The jury found the patent valid 
and infringed, and awarded VLSI approximately $949 million in damages, plus interest and a running royalty. The court has not 
yet entered final judgment. In February 2023, we filed motions for a new trial and for judgment as a matter of law notwithstanding 
the verdict on various grounds. Further appeals are possible.
In May 2019, VLSI filed a case in Shenzhen Intermediate People’s Court against Intel, Intel (China) Co., Ltd., Intel Trading (Shanghai) 
Co., Ltd., and Intel Products (Chengdu) Co., Ltd. VLSI asserted one patent against certain Intel Core processors. Defendants filed an 
invalidation petition in October 2019 with the China National Intellectual Property Administration (CNIPA) which held a hearing in 
September 2021. The Shenzhen court held trial proceedings in July 2021, and September 2023. VLSI sought an injunction as well as 
RMB 1.3 million in costs and expenses, but no damages. In September 2023, the CNIPA invalidated every claim of the asserted patent. In 
November 2023, the trial court dismissed VLSI’s case.
In May 2019, VLSI filed a case in Shanghai Intellectual Property Court against Intel (China) Co., Ltd., Intel Trading (Shanghai) Co., Ltd., 
and Intel Products (Chengdu) Co., Ltd. asserting one patent against certain Intel core processors. The court held a trial hearing in 
December 2020, where VLSI requested expenses (RMB 300 thousand) and an injunction. In December 2022, we filed a petition to 
invalidate the patent at issue. The court held a second trial hearing in May 2022, and in October 2023, issued a decision finding no 
infringement and dismissing all claims. In November 2023, VLSI appealed the finding of non-infringement.
As a result of recent developments in the VLSI litigation, we revised our loss exposure estimate and reduced our previously accrued  
charge of $2.2 billion to approximately $1.0 billion. While we dispute VLSI’s claims and intend to vigorously defend against them, we are 
unable to make a reasonable estimate of losses in excess of recorded amounts given recent developments and future proceedings. 
R2 Semiconductor Patent Litigation
In November 2022, R2 Semiconductor, Inc. (R2) filed a lawsuit in the High Court of Justice in the UK against Intel Corporation (UK) 
Limited and Intel Corporation, and a lawsuit in the Dusseldorf Regional Court in Germany against Intel Deutschland GmbH and certain 
Intel customers. R2 asserts one European patent is infringed by Intel’s Ice Lake, Tiger Lake, Alder Lake and Ice Lake Server (Xeon) 
processors (the accused products), and customer servers and laptops that contain those processors. R2 seeks an injunction in both 
actions prohibiting the sale and requiring the recall of the alleged infringing products. Intel is indemnifying its customers in the German 
lawsuit.
Intel disputes R2’s claims and intends to defend the lawsuits vigorously. In December 2022, Intel responded in the UK action that the 
asserted patent is not infringed and that the patent is invalid. In April 2023, defendants filed statements of defense in the German action 
that the asserted patent is not infringed and that an injunction would be a disproportionate remedy. In May 2023, defendants also filed a 
nullity action in the German Federal Patent Court on the ground that the asserted patent is invalid.

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements

In December 2023, the German Federal Patent Court issued a preliminary opinion finding R2’s patent valid. The German Federal Patent 
Court’s final decision on invalidity is expected in October 2024. In December 2023, the court in Dusseldorf held a trial on the issue of 
infringement, and will hand down a decision in February 2024. If defendants lose at trial in Germany, the Dusseldorf Regional Court could 
impose an injunction and recall order prohibiting sales of some or all of the accused products, and potentially other products, in Germany. 
The order could take effect and remain in place unless overturned on appeal, or unless the patent is invalidated by the German Federal 
Patent Court.
Trial in the UK matter is scheduled for April 2024. Given the procedural posture and the nature of these cases, including that there are 
significant factual and legal issues to be resolved and that uncertainty exists as to the scope of an injunction, if any, we are unable to 
make a reasonable estimate of the potential loss or range of losses, if any, that might arise from these lawsuits.
Business Interruption Insurance Proceeds
We received $484 million of insurance proceeds, primarily in the fourth quarter of 2022, to compensate for business interruption and 
property damage from a temporary electrical breakdown that occurred at one of our facilities in 2020. We recognized these receipts as a 
reduction of cost of sales.

Controls and Procedures
Inherent Limitations on Effectiveness of Controls
Our management, including our principal executive officer and principal financial officer, does not expect that our disclosure controls and 
procedures or our internal control over financial reporting will prevent or detect all errors and all fraud. A control system, no matter how 
well-designed and operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that the control system's objectives will be met. The 
design of a control system must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints, and the benefits of controls must be considered 
relative to their costs. Further, because of the inherent limitations in all control systems, no evaluation of controls can provide absolute 
assurance that misstatements due to error or fraud will not occur or that all control issues and instances of fraud, if any, have been 
detected.
Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures
Based on management's evaluation (with the participation of our principal executive officer and principal financial officer), as of the end of 
the period covered by this report, our principal executive officer and principal financial officer have concluded that our disclosure controls 
and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act) are effective to provide reasonable assurance that 
information required to be disclosed by us in reports that we file or submit under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized, 
and reported within the time periods specified in SEC rules and forms, and is accumulated and communicated to management, including 
our principal executive officer and principal financial officer, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure.
Changes in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting
There were no changes to our internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) under the Exchange 
Act) that occurred during the quarter ended December 30, 2023 that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, 
our internal control over financial reporting.
Management Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting 
Our management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rules 
13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) under the Exchange Act) to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of our financial reporting and 
the preparation of Consolidated Financial Statements for external purposes in accordance with US GAAP.
Management assessed our internal control over financial reporting as of December 30, 2023. Management based its assessment on 
criteria established in Internal Control—Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway 
Commission (2013 framework). Management's assessment included evaluation of elements such as the design and operating 
effectiveness of key financial reporting controls, process documentation, accounting policies, and our overall control environment.
Based on this assessment, management has concluded that our internal control over financial reporting was effective as of the end of the 
fiscal year to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of Consolidated Financial 
Statements for external reporting purposes in accordance with US GAAP. We reviewed the results of management's assessment with the 
Audit Committee of our Board of Directors.
Our independent registered public accounting firm, Ernst & Young LLP, independently assessed the effectiveness of the company's 
internal control over financial reporting, as stated in the firm's attestation report, which is included within Financial Statements and 
Supplemental Details.
