Schedule 8 Design principles for seniors housing
section 97
1
Neighbourhood amenity and streetscape
Seniors housing should be designed as follows—
(a) to recognise the operational, functional and economic requirements of residential care
facilities, which typically require a different building shape from other residential
accommodation,
(b) to recognise the desirable elements of—
(i) the location’s current character, or
(ii) for precincts undergoing a transition—the future character of the location so new
buildings contribute to the quality and identity of the area,
(c) to complement heritage conservation areas and heritage items in the area,
(d) to maintain reasonable neighbourhood amenity and appropriate residential character
by—
(i) providing building setbacks to reduce bulk and overshadowing, and
(ii) using building form and siting that relates to the site’s land form, and
(iii) adopting building heights at the street frontage that are compatible in scale with
adjacent buildings, and
(iv) considering, where buildings are located on the boundary, the impact of the
boundary walls on neighbours,
(e) to set back the front building on the site generally in line with the existing building
line,
(f) to include plants reasonably similar to other plants in the street,
(g) to retain, wherever reasonable, significant trees,
(h) to prevent the construction of a building in a riparian zone.
2
Visual and acoustic privacy
Seniors housing should be designed to consider the visual and acoustic privacy of
adjacent neighbours and all residents of the seniors housing by—
(a) using appropriate site planning, including considering the location and design of
windows and balconies, the use of screening devices and landscaping, and
State Environmental Planning Policy (Housing) 2021 [NSW]
Current version for 23 September 2024 to date (accessed 30 September 2024 at 15:41)
Page 142 of 152


(b) ensuring acceptable noise levels in bedrooms of new dwellings by locating them away
from driveways, parking areas and paths.
3
Solar access and design for climate
The design of seniors housing should—
(a) for development involving the erection of a new building—provide residents of the
building with adequate daylight in a way that does not adversely impact the amount
of daylight in neighbouring buildings, and
(b) involve site planning, dwelling design and landscaping that reduces energy use and
makes the best practicable use of natural ventilation, solar heating and lighting by
locating the windows of living and dining areas in a northerly direction.
4
Stormwater
The design of seniors housing should aim to—
(a) control and minimise the disturbance and impacts of stormwater runoff on adjoining
properties and receiving waters by, for example, finishing driveway surfaces with
semi-pervious material, minimising the width of paths and minimising paved areas,
and
(b) include, where practical, on-site stormwater detention or re-use for second quality
water uses.
5
Crime prevention
Seniors housing should—
(a) be designed in accordance with environmental design principles relating to crime
prevention, and
(b) provide personal property security for residents and visitors, and
(c) encourage crime prevention by—
(i) site planning that allows observation of the approaches to a dwelling entry from
inside each dwelling and general observation of public areas, driveways and
streets from a dwelling that adjoins the area, driveway or street, and
(ii) providing shared entries, if required, that serve a small number of dwellings and
that are able to be locked, and
(iii) providing dwellings designed to allow residents to see who approaches their
dwellings without the need to open the front door.

Current version for 23 September 2024 to date (accessed 30 September 2024 at 15:41)
Page 143 of 152


6
Accessibility
Seniors housing should—
(a) have obvious and safe pedestrian links from the site that provide access to transport
services or local facilities, and
(b) provide safe environments for pedestrians and motorists with convenient access and
parking for residents and visitors.
7
Waste management
Seniors housing should include waste facilities that maximise recycling by the provision of
appropriate facilities.
Schedule 9 Design principles for residential apartment development
section 147
1
Context and neighbourhood character
(1) Good design responds and contributes to its context, which is the key natural and
built features of an area, their relationship and the character they create when
combined and also includes social, economic, health and environmental conditions.
(2) Responding to context involves identifying the desirable elements of an area’s
existing or future character.
(3) Well designed buildings respond to and enhance the qualities and identity of the area
including the adjacent sites, streetscape and neighbourhood.
(4) Consideration of local context is important for all sites, including sites in the following
areas—
(a) established areas,
(b) areas undergoing change,
(c) areas identified for change.
2
Built form and scale
(1) Good design achieves a scale, bulk and height appropriate to the existing or desired
future character of the street and surrounding buildings.
(2) Good design also achieves an appropriate built form for a site and the building’s
purpose in terms of the following—
(a) building alignments and proportions,
(b) building type,
State Environmental Planning Policy (Housing) 2021 [NSW]
Current version for 23 September 2024 to date (accessed 30 September 2024 at 15:41)
Page 144 of 152


(c) building articulation,
(d) the manipulation of building elements.
(3) Appropriate built form—
(a) defines the public domain, and
(b) contributes to the character of streetscapes and parks, including their views and
vistas, and
(c) provides internal amenity and outlook.
3
Density
(1) Good design achieves a high level of amenity for residents and each apartment,
resulting in a density appropriate to the site and its context.
(2) Appropriate densities are consistent with the area’s existing or projected population.
(3) Appropriate densities are sustained by the following—
(a) existing or proposed infrastructure,
(b) public transport,
(c) access to jobs,
(d) community facilities,
(e) the environment.
4
Sustainability
(1) Good design combines positive environmental, social and economic outcomes.
(2) Good sustainable design includes—
(a) use of natural cross ventilation and sunlight for the amenity and liveability of
residents, and
(b) passive thermal design for ventilation, heating and cooling, which reduces reliance
on technology and operation costs.
(3) Good sustainable design also includes the following—
(a) recycling and reuse of materials and waste,
(b) use of sustainable materials,
(c) deep soil zones for groundwater recharge and vegetation.
