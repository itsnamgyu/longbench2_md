ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS 
 
The idea of the Compendium of International and National Legal Frameworks on Female 
Genital Mutilation/Cutting came out of discussions held during several international 
seminars on Female Genital Mutilation/Cutting (FGM/C) during the Law, Justice and 
Development Weeks promoted by the Legal Vice Presidency of the World Bank and by the 
Global Forum on Law, Justice and Development (GFLJD) and the FGM/C Donor Working 
Group Meetings. This edition of the Compendium of International and National Legal 
Frameworks on FGM/C is sponsored by the Legal Vice Presidency of the World Bank and by 
the GFLJD FGM/C Legal Working Group.

FOREWORD 
 
In 2012 and in 2018, the United Nations General Assembly adopted resolutions urging the 
international community to intensify global efforts to eliminate female genital 
mutilation/cutting (FGM/C) (A/RES/67/1461 and A/RES/73/5822). It also called upon “States, 
the United Nations system, civil society and all stakeholders to continue to observe 6 
February as the International Day of Zero Tolerance for FGM/C and to use the day to enhance 
awareness raising campaigns and to take concrete actions against female genital 
mutilations”. 
FGM/C is an extreme type of violence against women and girls which impairs their 
development potential and impacts the societies in which they live and work, their children, 
their families and ultimately their countries. FGM/C also undermines the World Bank’s 
efforts to end extreme poverty and boost shared prosperity. 
Women and girls affected by FGM/C may not be able to reach their full personal, productive 
and professional potential. FGM/C causes a large number of physical and psychological 
problems and complications and can even lead to death. It imposes unnecessary suffering 
and prolonged pain.   
The international community recognized that FGM/C is an important development challenge 
that affects more than 200 million women and girls in the world. Sustainable Development 
Goal 5 (SDG 5: “Achieve gender equality and empower all women and girls”) includes a target 
on eliminating all harmful practices against women, such as female genital mutilation by 
2030 (target 5.3).   
 
To mark the International Day of Zero Tolerance to FGM/C, we are pleased to share this 7th 
edition of the “Compendium of International and National Legal Frameworks on Female 
Genital Mutilation/Cutting”. It describes the international and regional instruments that 
address FGM/C as well as the national legislations adopted to outlaw FGM/C. This is a 
practical online tool to empower those fighting FGM/C. We hope this responds to the needs 
of all those interested in this subject as well as those who work with women and girls affected 
or at risk. 
 
We hope these legal tools help shape change to eliminate FGM/C within our generation.

INTRODUCTION  
  
Female Genital Mutilation/Cutting (FGM/C)3 is a development issue and am extreme form of 
violence against women and girls that affects more than 200 million women in the world.   
FGM/C is a harmful practice proven to impact the physical and mental health of affected 
women and girls4 from the moment of the cutting, with prolonged and irreversible 
consequences during their entire lives5. FGM/C is at the confluence of domestic violence, 
child abuse and sexual assault and a serious violation of human rights.  
 
Studies show that FGM/C has economic and social consequences6 and a high obstetric cost6 
although a comprehensive study on the exact extent of these economic, health and social 
costs is still to be carried out. Beyond the data and the statistics, researchers have shown 
that FGM/C deprives women of sexual satisfaction, sexual health and psychophysical well-
being7.  
 
The Compendium of International and National Legal Frameworks on Female Genital 
Mutilation (the “Compendium”) was prepared to contribute to this urgent and important 
development debate with the understanding that the knowledge of the law is an important 
empowerment tool to end FGM/C.  
 
It provides a survey of the key international and regional instruments as well as domestic 
legislation as they relate to the prohibition of FGM/C.  
 
The Compendium consists of topical chapters (international legal frameworks; regional legal 
frameworks; consensus documents and national legal frameworks) with hyperlinks to source 
documents, such as United Nations conventions, regional treaties, and national legislations.  
The Compendium is a working document intended as a reference tool for anyone interested 
in the topic of FGM/C (development practitioners, lawyers, community leaders, academics, 
researchers, students, etc.). It does not constitute an exhaustive treatment of the legal 
framework on FGM/C and may be updated from time to time.  
 
The Compendium is based on information available both online and based on research 
conducted, verified and updated up to January 2024. Because the Compendium is based on 
 
 
3 FGM comprises all procedures involving partial or total removal of the external female genitalia or other injury to the female 
genital organs for non-medical reasons (WHO, UNICEF, UNFPA, 1997). 
4 FGM is an associated with serious physical and mental health problems, such as severe bleeding, severe pain, neurogenic or 
septic shocks, cysts, swelling, fever, urination problems, wound healing or menstrual problems, infections, tetanus, infertility, 
kidney failure, fistula, HIV/AIDS, keloids, complications in childbirth, increased risk of newborn death, premature births, 
depression, vaginism (genito-pelvic pain disorder), anxiety, memory loss, post-traumatic stress disorders, sexual complications, 
anger and painful intercourse. FGM can even lead to death in some extreme cases. WHO data available at

electronically published documents. All hyperlinks were active at the time they were 
referenced in the Compendium. The hyperlinked references are not under the control of the

The content of the Compendium does not reflect the views of the World Bank, its Board of 
Executive Directors, or the governments they represent. Furthermore, the World Bank does

For the domestic legislative aspects, the Compendium is limited to those countries where 
FGM/C is practiced, and which have specific or general laws prohibiting FGM/C. When 
evidence of the practice of FGM/C is marginal or not sufficiently documented, the country 
was not included in our review. Therefore, the absence of a country’s name means that the 
practice is either inexistent or marginally existent. It could also be due to lack of information 
online.  
 
The Compendium is therefore limited to 35 countries in Sub-Saharan Africa; 11 countries in 
Asia and Pacific; 30 countries in Europe; 7 countries in Latin America and the Caribbean; 7 in 
Northern Africa and the Middle East; and 2 countries in North America, as far as the domestic 
legislative aspects are concerned.

collection and dissemination by universities, medical or nursing associations, 


 
 
COMPENDIUM OF INTERNATIONAL AND NATIONAL LEGAL FRAMEWORKS ON  
FEMALE GENITAL MUTILATION/CUTTING
6 
 
national women’s organizations or other bodies of basic data about such traditional 
practices; The support of women’s organizations at the national and local levels 
working for the elimination of female circumcision and other practices harmful to 
women; The encouragement of politicians, professionals, religious and community 
leaders at all levels including the media and the arts to cooperate in influencing 
attitudes towards the eradication of female circumcision; The introduction of 
appropriate educational and training programmes and seminars based on research 
findings about the problems arising from female circumcision.  
(b) 
That States parties include in their national health policies appropriate strategies 
aimed at eradicating female circumcision in public health care. Such strategies could 
include the special responsibility of health personnel including traditional birth 
attendants to explain the harmful effects of female circumcision. 
(c) 
That States parties invite assistance, information and advice from the appropriate 
organizations of the United Nations system to support and assist efforts being 
deployed to eliminate harmful traditional practices.  
(d) 
That States parties include in their reports to the Committee under articles 10 and 
12 of the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination against 
Women information about measures taken to eliminate female circumcision. 
 
1.7 
CEDAW General Recommendation No. 19: Violence against women 
 
6. 
The Convention in article 1 defines discrimination against women. The definition of 
discrimination includes gender-based violence, that is, violence that is directed against a 
woman because she is a woman or that affects w omen disproportionately. It includes acts 
that inflict physical, mental or sexual harm or suffering, threats of such acts, coercion and 
other deprivations of liberty. Gender - based violence may breach specific provisions of the 
Convention, regardless of whether those provisions expressly mention violence.  
 
7.  
Gender-based violence, which impairs or nullifies the enjoyment by women of 
human rights and fundamental freedoms under general international law or under human 
rights conventions, is discrimination within the meaning of article 1 of the Convention. These 
rights and freedoms include:  
(a)  
The right to life. 
(b)  
The right not to be subject to torture or to cruel, inhuman or degrading 
treatment or punishment. 
(c)  
The right to equal protection according to humanitarian norms in time of 
international or internal armed conflict. 
(d)  
The right to liberty and security of person. 
(e)  
The right to equal protection under the law. 
(f)  
The right to equality in the family. 
(g)  
The right to the highest standard attainable of physical and mental health. 
(h)  
The right to just and favorable conditions of work.  
 


 
 
COMPENDIUM OF INTERNATIONAL AND NATIONAL LEGAL FRAMEWORKS ON  
FEMALE GENITAL MUTILATION/CUTTING
7 
 
8.  
The Convention applies to violence perpetrated by public authorities. Such acts of 
violence may breach that State’s obligations under general international human rights law 
and under other conventions, in addition to breaching this Convention.  
 
9.  
It is emphasized, however, that discrimination under the Convention is not restricted 
to action by or on behalf of Governments (see articles 2(e), 2(f) and 5). For example, under 
article 2(e) the Convention calls on States parties to take all appropriate measures to 
eliminate discrimination against women by any person, organization or enterprise. Under 
general international law and specific human rights covenants, States may also be 
responsible for private acts if they fail to act with due diligence to prevent violations of rights 
or to investigate and punish acts of violence, and for providing compensation. 
 
Comments on specific articles of the Convention 
 
Articles 2(f), 5 and 10 (c)  
11.  
Traditional attitudes by which women are regarded as subordinate to men or as 
having stereotyped roles perpetuate widespread practices involving violence or coercion, 
such as family violence and abuse, forced marriage, dowry deaths, acid attacks and female 
circumcision. Such prejudices and practices may justify gender-based violence as a form of 
protection or control of women. The effect of such violence on the physical and mental 
integrity of women is to deprive them of the equal enjoyment, exercise and knowledge of 
human rights and fundamental freedoms. While this comment addresses mainly actual or 
threatened violence the underlying consequences of these forms of gender-based violence 
help to maintain women in subordinate roles and contribute to their low level of political 
participation and to their lower level of education, skills and work opportunities. 
 
Article 12: 
19.  
States parties are required by article 12 to take measures to ensure equal access to 
health care. Violence against women puts their health and lives at risk.  
 
20.  
In some States there are traditional practices perpetuated by culture and tradition 
that are harmful to the health of women and children. These practices include 
dietary restrictions for pregnant w omen, preference for male children and female 
circumcision or genital mutilation. 
 
Article 14: 
21.  
Rural women are at risk of gender - based violence because of traditional attitudes 
regarding the subordinate role of women that persist in many rural communities. Girls from 
rural communities are at special risk of violence and sexual exploitation when they leave the 
rural community to seek employment in towns.

Article 12: 
5.  
The Committee refers also to its earlier general recommendations on female 
circumcision, human immunodeficiency virus/acquired immunodeficiency syndrome 
(HIV/AIDS), disabled women, violence against women and equality in family 
relations, all of which refer to issues that are integral to full compliance with article 
12 of the Convention,  
 
12.  
States parties should report on their understanding of how policies and measures on 
health care address the health rights of women from the perspective of women’s 
needs and interests and how it addresses distinctive features and factors that differ 
for women in comparison to men, such as: … (b) … Some cultural or traditional 
practices such as female genital mutilation also carry a high risk of death and 
disability;  
 
15.  
The obligation to protect rights relating to women’s health requires States parties, 
their agents and officials to take action to prevent and impose sanctions for 
violations of rights by private persons and organizations. Since gender-based 
violence is a critical health issue for women, States parties should ensure:  
[…] 
(d)  
The enactment and effective enforcement of laws that prohibit female 
genital mutilation and marriage of girl children. 
 
18.  
The issues of HIV/AIDS and other sexually transmitted diseases are central to the 
rights of women and adolescent girls to sexual health. Harmful traditional practices, 
such as female genital mutilatio may also expose girls and women to the risk of 
contracting HIV/AIDS and other sexually transmitted diseases. 
 
In particular, States parties should ensure the rights of female and male adolescents 
to sexual and equality reproductive health education by properly trained personnel 
in specially designed programmes that respect their right to privacy and 
confidentiality. 
 
1.9 
CEDAW General Recommendation No. 32 on the gender-related dimensions of 
refugee status, asylum, nationality and statelessness of women 
 
21.  
The Committee notes that the Convention, as an instrument to prevent 
discrimination against women, contains no explicit provision on non-refoulement. In the 
framework of its work on individual communications under the Optional Protocol, the 
Committee has had to address States parties’ objections to the effect that the Committee 
has no competence to deal with cases submitted on behalf of asylum seekers whose 
applications have been rejected at the national level but who claim that they would be 
exposed to the risk of sexual and/or gender-based violence and persecution if forcibly 
returned to their country of origin. In reply, the Committee has noted, among other things, 


 
 
COMPENDIUM OF INTERNATIONAL AND NATIONAL LEGAL FRAMEWORKS ON  
FEMALE GENITAL MUTILATION/CUTTING
9 
 
that, under international human rights law, the non-refoulement principle imposes a duty on 
States to refrain from returning a person to a jurisdiction in which he or she may face serious 
violations of human rights, notably arbitrary deprivation of life or torture or other cruel, 
inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment. In addition, the Committee recalls that civil 
and political rights and freedoms, including the right to life and the right not to be subjected 
to torture or ill-treatment, are implicitly covered by the Convention, and thus States parties 
are under the obligation not to extradite, deport, expel or otherwise remove a person from 
their territory to the territory of another State where there are substantial grounds for 
believing that there is a real risk of irreparable harm. 
 
22.  
The Committee further considers that, under article 2(d) of the Convention, States 
parties undertake to refrain from engaging in any act or practice of discrimination against 
women and to ensure that public authorities and institutions act in conformity with that 
obligation. That duty encompasses the obligation of States parties to protect women from 
being exposed to a real, personal and foreseeable risk of serious forms of discrimination 
against women, including gender-based violence, irrespective of whether such 
consequences would take place outside the territorial boundaries of the sending State party: 
if a State party takes a decision relating to a person within its jurisdiction, and the necessary 
and foreseeable consequence is that the person’s basic rights under the Convention will be 
seriously at risk in another jurisdiction, the State party itself may be in violation of the 
Convention. The foreseeability of the consequence would mean that there was a present 
violation by the State party, even though the consequence would not occur until later. 
 
23.  
The Committee is therefore of the view that States parties have an obligation to 
ensure that no woman will be expelled or returned to another State where her life, physical 
integrity, liberty and security of person would be threatened, or where she would risk 
suffering serious forms of discrimination, including serious forms of gender-based 
persecution or gender-based violence. What amounts to serious forms of discrimination 
against women, including gender-based violence, will depend on the circumstances of each 
case. 
 
24.  
Articles 1-3, 5(a) and 15 establish an obligation on States parties to ensure that 
women are not discriminated against during the entire asylum process, beginning from the 
moment of arrival at the borders. Women asylum seekers are entitled to have their rights 
under the Convention respected; they are entitled to be treated in a non-discriminatory 
manner and with respect and dignity at all times during the asylum procedure and thereafter, 
including through the process of finding durable solutions once asylum status has been 
recognized by the receiving State. 
 
The receiving State has a responsibility towards women granted asylum status when it comes 
to helping them to, among other things, find proper accommodation, training and/or job 
opportunities, providing legal, medical, psychosocial support for victims of trauma and 
offering language classes and other measures facilitating their integration. In addition, 


 
 
COMPENDIUM OF INTERNATIONAL AND NATIONAL LEGAL FRAMEWORKS ON  
FEMALE GENITAL MUTILATION/CUTTING
10 
 
women asylum seekers whose asylum applications are denied should be granted dignified 
and non-discriminatory return processes. 
 
25.  
Article 2(c) of the Convention requires that State asylum procedures allow women’s 
claims to asylum to be presented and assessed on the basis of equality in a fair, impartial and 
timely manner. A gender-sensitive approach should be applied at every stage of the asylum 
process. This means that women’s claims to asylum should be determined by an asylum 
system that is informed, in all aspects of its policy and operations, by a thorough 
understanding of the particular forms of discrimination or persecution and human rights 
abuses that women experience on grounds of gender or sex. Owing to shame, stigma or 
trauma, some women may be reluctant to disclose or identify the true extent of the 
persecution that they have suffered or fear. Account needs to be taken of the fact that they 
may continue to fear persons in authority or rejection and/or reprisals from their family 
and/or community. In any event, they should be entitled to appeal against first-instance 
asylum decisions. 
 
26.  
In addition, articles 2, 15(1) and 16 require States parties to recognize that women 
may present independent claims to asylum. In this respect, their claims may also be based 
on fears relating to their children. For example, claims to refugee status may arise from a 
fear that their daughters will suffer female genital mutilation, be forced into marriage or be 
subjected to severe community ostracism and exclusion for being girls. The child’s protection 
claim should also be considered on its own merits in a child-sensitive manner in the best 
interests of the child. Once the principal claimant is recognized as a refugee, other members 
of the family should normally also be recognized as refugees (“derivative status”). 
 
27.  
Harm perpetrated against women and girls is often at the hands of non-State actors, 
including family members, neighbours or society more generally. In such cases, article 2(e) 
of the Convention requires that States parties assume their due diligence obligation and 
ensure that women are effectively protected from harm that may be inflicted by non-State 
actors. It does not suffice to strive for vertical gender equality of the individual woman vis-à-
vis public authorities; States must also work to secure non-discrimination at the horizontal 
level, even within the family. Harm perpetrated by non-State actors is persecution where the 
State is unable or unwilling to prevent such harm or protect the claimant because of 
discriminatory governmental policies or practices. 
 
28.  
The Committee is aware that, in cases in which persecution is perpetrated by non-
State actors, receiving States have advanced the option of internal flight alternative, 
according to which a person is not at risk of persecution by non-State actors if he or she is 
relocated to a safe place within the State of origin. The Committee recalls that articles 2(d) 
and (e) of the Convention require that States parties ensure that women are protected 
against discrimination generated by non-State actors and, in the context of a refugee woman, 
it observes that the essence of refugee status is to provide effective protection to the refugee 
woman. It also notes that, should the internal flight alternative be considered by receiving 


 
 
COMPENDIUM OF INTERNATIONAL AND NATIONAL LEGAL FRAMEWORKS ON  
FEMALE GENITAL MUTILATION/CUTTING
11 
 
States, the option should be subject to strict requirements, such as the woman’s ability to 
travel to the area concerned and gain admittance and settle there. States should also take 
into account gender-related aspects and risks in the assessment as to whether internal 
relocation is permissible. Difficulties faced by women in relocating to other parts of their 
countries of origin can include legal, cultural and/or social restrictions or prohibitions on 
women travelling or living alone, practical realities such as problems of securing 
accommodation, childcare and economic survival without family or community support, and 
risk of harassment and exploitation, including sexual exploitation and violence. 
 
29.  
The Committee acknowledges that, as a matter of international law, the authorities 
of the country of origin are primarily responsible for providing protection to the citizens, 
including ensuring that women enjoy their rights under the Convention, and that it is only 
when such protection is not available that international protection is invoked to protect the 
basic human rights that are seriously at risk. However, the Committee notes that the fact 
that a woman asylum seeker has not sought the protection of the State or made a complaint 
to the authorities before her departure from her country of origin should not prejudice her 
asylum claim, especially where violence against women is tolerated or there is a pattern of 
failure in responding to women’s complaints of abuse. It would not be realistic to require her 
to have sought protection in advance of her flight. She may also lack confidence in the justice 
system and access to justice or fear abuse, harassment or retaliation for making such 
complaints. 
 
30.  
In line with the Convention, States parties are required to take proactive measures 
to ensure that the legally recognized grounds of persecution, including those enumerated in 
the 1951 Convention relating to the Status of Refugees (race, religion, nationality, 
membership of a particular social group and political opinion), are given a gender-sensitive 
interpretation. In addition, gender may be used as a factor in recognizing membership of a 
particular social group or indeed as an identifying characteristic of such a group for purposes 
of granting refugee status under the 1951 Convention. States parties are also encouraged to 
add sex and or gender as an additional ground for refugee status in their national legislation. 
 
34.  
Gender sensitivity should be reflected in reception arrangements, taking into 
account the specific needs of victims of sexual abuse and exploitation, of trauma and torture 
or ill-treatment and of other particularly vulnerable groups of women and girls. Reception 
arrangements should also allow for the unity of the family as present within the territory, in 
particular in the context of reception centres. As a general rule, pregnant women and nursing 
mothers, who both have special needs, should not be detained. Where detention of women 
asylum seekers is unavoidable, separate facilities and materials are required to meet the 
specific hygiene needs of women. The use of female guards and warders should be 
promoted. All staff assigned to work with women detainees should receive training relating 
to the gender-specific needs and human rights of women. Pursuant to articles 1, 2, 5(a) and 
12 of the Convention, failure to address the specific needs of women in immigration 
detention and ensure the respectful treatment of detained women asylum seekers could 


 
 
COMPENDIUM OF INTERNATIONAL AND NATIONAL LEGAL FRAMEWORKS ON  
FEMALE GENITAL MUTILATION/CUTTING
12 
 
constitute discrimination within the meaning of the Convention. Not least for the purposes 
of avoiding violence against women, separate facilities for male and female detainees are 
required, unless in family units, and alternatives to detention are to be made available. 
 
1.10 Joint general recommendation No. 31 of the CEDAW and the Committee on the 
Rights of the Child on harmful practices 
 
7.  
Harmful practices are therefore grounded in discrimination based on sex, gender and 
age, among other things, and have often been justified by invoking sociocultural and religious 
customs and values, in addition to misconceptions relating to some disadvantaged groups of 
women and children. Overall, harmful practices are often associated with serious forms of 
violence or are themselves a form of violence against women and children. While the nature 
and prevalence of the practices vary by region and culture, the most prevalent and well 
documented are female genital mutilation, child and/or forced marriage, polygamy, crimes 
committed in the name of so-called honour and dowry-related violence. Given that those 
practices are frequently raised before both Committees, and in some cases have been 
demonstrably reduced through legislative and programmatic approaches, they are used 
herein as key illustrative examples. 
 
16.  
For the purposes of the present joint general recommendation/general comment, 
practices should meet the following criteria to be regarded as harmful: 
(a)  
They constitute a denial of the dignity and/or integrity of the individual and a 
violation of the human rights and fundamental freedoms enshrined in the two 
Conventions; 
(b)  
They constitute discrimination against women or children and are harmful insofar as 
they result in negative consequences for them as individuals or groups, including 
physical, psychological, economic and social harm and/or violence and limitations on 
their capacity to participate fully in society or develop and reach their full potential; 
(c)  
They are traditional, re-emerging or emerging practices that are prescribed and/or 
kept in place by social norms that perpetuate male dominance and inequality of 
women and children, on the basis of sex, gender, age and other intersecting factors; 
(d)  
They are imposed on women and children by family members, community members 
or society at large, regardless of whether the victim provides, or is able to provide, 
full, free and informed consent. 
 
17.  
The causes of harmful practices are multidimensional and include stereotyped sex- 
and gender-based roles, the presumed superiority or inferiority of either of the sexes, 
attempts to exert control over the bodies and sexuality of women and girls, social inequalities 
and the prevalence of male-dominated power structures. Efforts to change the practices 
must address those underlying systemic and structural causes of traditional, re-emerging and 
emerging harmful practices, empower girls and women and boys and men to contribute to 
the transformation of traditional cultural attitudes that condone harmful practices, act as 


 
 
COMPENDIUM OF INTERNATIONAL AND NATIONAL LEGAL FRAMEWORKS ON  
FEMALE GENITAL MUTILATION/CUTTING
13 
 
agents of such change and strengthen the capacity of communities to support such 
processes. 
 
A. 
Female genital mutilation 
 
19.  
Female genital mutilation, female circumcision or female genital cutting is the 
practice of partially or wholly removing the external female genitalia or otherwise injuring 
the female genital organs for non-medical or non-health reasons. In the context of the 
present joint general recommendation/general comment, it is referred to as female genital 
mutilation. Female genital mutilation is performed in every region and, within some cultures, 
is a requirement for marriage and believed to be an effective method of controlling the 
sexuality of women and girls. It may have various immediate and/or long-term health 
consequences, including severe pain, shock, infections and complications during childbirth 
(affecting both the mother and the child), long-term gynecological problems such as fistula, 
psychological effects and death. The World Health Organization and the United Nations 
Children’s Fund estimate that between 100 million and 140 million girls and women 
worldwide have been subjected to a type of female genital mutilation. 
 
C.  
Prevention of harmful practices 
 
56.  
One of the first steps in combating harmful practices is through prevention. Both 
Committees have underlined that prevention can be best achieved through a rights-based 
approach to changing social and cultural norms, empowering women and girls, building the 
capacity of all relevant professionals who are in regular contact with victims, potential victims 
and perpetrators of harmful practices at all levels and raising awareness of the causes and 
consequences of harmful practices, including through dialogue with relevant stakeholders. 
 
C.1.  
Establishing rights-based social and cultural norms 
 
57.  
A social norm is a contributing factor to and social determinant of certain practices 
in a community that may be positive and strengthen its identity and cohesion or may be 
negative and potentially lead to harm. It is also a social rule of behaviour that members of a 
community are expected to observe. This creates and sustains a collective sense of social 
obligation and expectation that conditions the behaviour of individual community members, 
even if they are not personally in agreement with the practice. For example, where female 
genital mutilation is the social norm, parents are motivated to agree to its being performed 
on their daughters because they see other parents doing so and believe that others expect 
them to do the same. The norm or practice is often perpetuated by other women in 
community networks who have already undergone the procedure and exert additional 
pressure on younger women to conform to the practice or risk ostracism, being shunned and 
stigmatization. Such marginalization may include the loss of important economic and social 
support and social mobility. Conversely, if individuals conform to the social norm, they expect 
to be rewarded, for example through inclusion and praise. 


 
 
COMPENDIUM OF INTERNATIONAL AND NATIONAL LEGAL FRAMEWORKS ON  
FEMALE GENITAL MUTILATION/CUTTING
14 
 
Changing social norms that underlie and justify harmful practices requires that such 
expectations be challenged and modified. 
 
58.  
Social norms are interconnected, meaning that harmful practices cannot be 
addressed in isolation, but within a broader context based on a comprehensive 
understanding of how the practices are linked to other cultural and social norms and other 
practices. This indicates the need to adopt a rights-based approach that is founded on 
recognition that rights are indivisible and interdependent. 
 
D.  
Protective measures and responsive services 
 
82.  
Women and children who are victims of harmful practices are in need of immediate 
support services, including medical, psychological and legal services. 
Emergency medical services may be the most urgent and obvious, given that some of the 
harmful practices covered herein involve the infliction of extreme physical violence and 
medical intervention may be necessary to treat severe harm or prevent death. Victims of 
female genital mutilation or other harmful practices may also require medical treatment or 
surgical interventions to address the short-term and long-term physical consequences. The 
management of pregnancy and childbirth in women or girls who have undergone female 
genital mutilation must be included in pre-service and in-service training for midwives, 
doctors and other skilled birth attendants. 
 
83.  
National protection systems or, in their absence, traditional structures should be 
mandated to be child friendly and gender sensitive and adequately resourced to provide all 
necessary protection services to women and girls who face a high risk of being subjected to 
violence, including girls running away to avoid being subjected to female genital mutilation, 
forced marriage or crimes committed in the name of so-called honour. Consideration should 
be given to the establishment of an easy-to remember, free, around-the-clock helpline that 
is available and known nationwide. Appropriate safety and security measures for victims 
must be available, including specifically designed temporary shelters or specialized services 
within shelters for victims of violence. Given that perpetrators of harmful practices are often 
the spouse of the victim, a family member or a member of the victim’s community, protective 
services should seek to relocate victims outside their immediate community if there is reason 
to believe that they may be unsafe. Unsupervised visits must be avoided, especially when 
the issue may be considered one of so-called honour. Psychosocial support must also be 
available to treat the immediate and long-term psychological trauma of victims, which may 
include post-traumatic stress disorder, anxiety and depression. 
 
1.11 CEDAW General recommendation No. 34 on the rights of rural women 
 
22.  
Article 5(a) addresses elimination of discriminatory stereotypes and practices, which 
are often more prevalent in rural areas. Rural women and girls are often disadvantaged by 
harmful practices, such as child and/or forced marriage, polygamy and female genital 


 
 
COMPENDIUM OF INTERNATIONAL AND NATIONAL LEGAL FRAMEWORKS ON  
FEMALE GENITAL MUTILATION/CUTTING
15 
 
mutilation, which endanger their health and well-being and may push them to migrate in 
order to escape such practices, potentially exposing them to other risks. They are also 
disadvantaged by practices such as inheritance of ancestral debt, which perpetuates cycles 
of poverty, and by discriminatory stereotypes and related practices which prevent them from 
enjoying rights over land, water and natural resources, such as male primogeniture and 
widows’ property-grabbing. 
 
23.  
States parties should eliminate harmful practices, including child and/or forced 
marriages, female genital mutilation, and inheritance of ancestral debt, which negatively 
affect rural women’s and girls’ health, well-being and dignity, in line with GR 31 (2014) on 
harmful practices. They should eliminate discriminatory stereotypes including those that 
compromise the equal rights of rural women to land, water and other natural resources. In 
this regard, States parties should adopt a range of measures, including outreach and support 
programmes, awareness-raising and media campaigns in collaboration with traditional 
leaders and civil society to eliminate harmful practices and stereotypes. 
 
1.12 CEDAW General recommendation No. 35 on gender-based violence against women, 
updating general recommendation No. 19 
 
7.  
In many States, legislation addressing gender-based violence against women is non-
existent, inadequate or poorly implemented. An erosion of the legal and policy frameworks 
that aim to eliminate gender-based discrimination or violence, often justified in the name of 
tradition, culture, religion or fundamentalist ideology, and significant reductions in public 
spending, often as part of so-called “austerity measures” following economic and financial 
crises, further weaken States responses. In the context of shrinking democratic spaces and 
the consequent deterioration of the rule of law, all of those factors contribute to the 
pervasiveness of gender-based violence against women and lead to a culture of impunity. 
 
10.  
The Committee considers that gender-based violence against women is one of the 
fundamental social, political and economic means by which the subordinate position of 
women with respect to men and their stereotyped roles are perpetuated. 
Throughout its work, the Committee has made clear that such violence is a critical obstacle 
to the achievement of substantive equality between women and men and to the enjoyment 
by women of their human rights and fundamental freedoms, as enshrined in the Convention. 
 
14.  
Gender-based violence affects women throughout their life cycle 16 and, 
accordingly, references to women in the present document include girls. Such violence takes 
multiple forms, including acts or omissions intended or likely to cause or result in death or 
physical, sexual, psychological or economic harm or suffering to women, threats of such acts, 
harassment, coercion and arbitrary deprivation of liberty. Gender-based violence against 
women is affected and often exacerbated by cultural, economic, ideological, technological, 
political, religious, social and environmental factors, as evidenced, among other things, in 
the contexts of displacement, migration, the increased globalization of economic activities, 


 
 
COMPENDIUM OF INTERNATIONAL AND NATIONAL LEGAL FRAMEWORKS ON  
FEMALE GENITAL MUTILATION/CUTTING
16 
 
including global supply chains, the extractive and offshoring industry, militarization, foreign 
occupation, armed conflict, violent extremism and terrorism. 
 
Gender-based violence against women is also affected by political, economic and social 
crises, civil unrest, humanitarian emergencies, natural disasters and the destruction or 
degradation of natural resources. Harmful practices and crimes against women human rights 
defenders, politicians, 20 activists or journalists are also forms of gender-based violence 
against women affected by such cultural, ideological and political factors. 
 
16.  
Gender-based violence against women, may amount to torture or cruel, inhuman or 
degrading treatment in certain circumstances, including in cases of rape, domestic violence 
or harmful practices, among others. In some cases, some forms of gender-based violence 
against women may also constitute international crimes. 
 
17.  
The Committee endorses the view of other human rights treaty bodies and special 
procedures mandate-holders that in making the determination of when acts of gender-based 
violence against women amount to torture or cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment, a 
gender-sensitive approach is required to understand the level of pain and suffering 
experienced by women, and that the purpose and intent requirements for classifying such 
acts as torture are satisfied when acts or omissions are gender-specific or perpetrated 
against a person on the basis of sex. 
 
18.  
Violations of women’s sexual and reproductive health and rights, such as forced 
sterilization, forced abortion, forced pregnancy, criminalization of abortion, denial or delay 
of safe abortion and/or post-abortion care, forced continuation of pregnancy, and abuse and 
mistreatment of women and girls seeking sexual and reproductive health information, goods 
and services, are forms of gender-based violence that, depending on the circumstances, may 
amount to torture or cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment. 
 
19.  
The Committee regards gender-based violence against women as being rooted in 
gender-related factors, such as the ideology of men’s entitlement and privilege over women, 
social norms regarding masculinity, and the need to assert male control or power, enforce 
gender roles or prevent, discourage or punish what is considered to be unacceptable female 
behavior. Those factors also contribute to the explicit or implicit social acceptance of gender-
based violence against women, often still considered a private matter, and to the widespread 
impunity in that regard 
 
IV. Recommendations 
 
A.  
General legislative measures 
 
29.  
The Committee recommends that States parties implement the following legislative 
measures: 


 
 
COMPENDIUM OF INTERNATIONAL AND NATIONAL LEGAL FRAMEWORKS ON  
FEMALE GENITAL MUTILATION/CUTTING
17 
 
(a)  
Ensure that all forms of gender-based violence against women in all spheres, which 
amount to a violation of their physical, sexual or psychological integrity, are 
criminalized and introduce, without delay, or strengthen, legal sanctions 
commensurate with the gravity of the offence, as well as civil remedies; 
(b)  
Ensure that all legal systems, including plural legal systems, protect victims/survivors 
of gender-based violence against women and ensure that they have access to justice 
and to an effective remedy, in line with the guidance provided in general 
recommendation No. 33; 
(c)  
Repeal, including in customary, religious and indigenous laws, all legal provisions that 
are discriminatory against women and thereby enshrine, encourage, facilitate, justify 
or tolerate any form of gender-based violence. In particular, repeal the following: 
(i)  
Provisions that allow, tolerate or condone forms of gender-based violence 
against women, including child or forced marriage and other harmful 
practices, provisions allowing medical procedures to be performed on 
women with disabilities without their informed consent and provisions that 
criminalize abortion, being lesbian, bisexual or transgender, women in 
prostitution and adultery, or any other criminal provisions that affect women 
disproportionally, including those resulting in the discriminatory application 
of the death penalty to women; 
(ii)  
Discriminatory evidentiary rules and procedures, including procedures 
allowing for the deprivation of women’s liberty to protect them from 
violence, practices focused on “virginity” and legal defences or mitigating 
factors based on culture, religion or male privilege, such as the defence of 
so-called “honour”, traditional apologies, pardons from the families of 
victims/survivors or the subsequent marriage of the victim/survivor of 
sexual assault to the perpetrator, procedures that result in the harshest 
penalties, including stoning, lashing and death, often being reserved for 
women and judicial practices that disregard a history of gender-based 
violence to the detriment of women defendants; 
(iii)  
(d) Examine gender-neutral laws and policies to ensure that they do not 
create or perpetuate existing inequalities and repeal or modify them if they 
do so; 
 
B. Prevention 
 
30.  
The Committee recommends that States parties implement the following preventive 
measures: 
(a)  
Adopt and implement effective legislative and other appropriate preventive 
measures to address the underlying causes of gender-based violence against 
women, including patriarchal attitudes and stereotypes, inequality in the family and 
the neglect or denial of women’s civil, political, economic, social and cultural rights, 
and to promote the empowerment, agency and voices of women;  


 
 
COMPENDIUM OF INTERNATIONAL AND NATIONAL LEGAL FRAMEWORKS ON  
FEMALE GENITAL MUTILATION/CUTTING
18 
 
(b)  
Develop and implement effective measures, with the active participation of all 
relevant stakeholders, such as representatives of women’s organizations and of 
marginalized groups of women and girls, to address and eradicate the stereotypes, 
prejudices, customs and practices set out in article 5 of the Convention, which 
condone or promote gender-based violence against women and underpin the 
structural inequality of women with men. 
 
C.  
Protection 
 
31.  
The Committee recommends that States parties implement the following protective 
measures: 
(a)  
Adopt and implement effective measures to protect and assist women complainants 
of and witnesses to gender-based violence before, during and after legal 
proceedings, including by: 
(i)  
Protecting their privacy and safety, in line with general recommendation No. 
33, including through gender-sensitive court procedures and measures, 
bearing in mind the due process rights of victims/survivors, witnesses and 
defendants; 
(ii)  
Providing appropriate and accessible protective mechanisms to prevent 
further 
or 
potential 
violence, 
without 
the 
precondition 
that 
victims/survivors initiate legal action, including through removal of 
communication barriers for victims with disabilities.8 Mechanisms should 
include immediate risk assessment and protection comprising a wide range 
of effective measures and, where appropriate, the issuance and monitoring 
of eviction, protection, restraining or emergency barring orders against 
alleged perpetrators, including adequate sanctions for non-compliance. 
Protective measures should avoid imposing an undue financial, bureaucratic 
or personal burden on women who are victims/survivors. The rights or 
claims of perpetrators or alleged perpetrators during and after judicial 
proceedings, including with respect to property, privacy, child custody, 
access, contact and visitation, should be determined in the light of women’s 
and children’s human rights to life and physical, sexual and psychological 
integrity and guided by the principle of the best interests of the child. 
 
1.13 Convention on the Rights of the Child  
 
Article 19:  
1. 
States Parties shall take all appropriate legislative, administrative, social and 
educational measures to protect the child from all forms of physical or mental 
 
 
8 For example, protective orders in some countries allow for the banning of travel of people who are believed to be at risk of 
female genital mutilation 


 
 
COMPENDIUM OF INTERNATIONAL AND NATIONAL LEGAL FRAMEWORKS ON  
FEMALE GENITAL MUTILATION/CUTTING
19 
 
violence, injury or abuse, neglect or negligent treatment, maltreatment or 
exploitation, including sexual abuse, while in the care of parent(s), legal guardian(s) 
or any other person who has the care of the child.  
2. 
Such protective measures should, as appropriate, include effective procedures for 
the establishment of social programmes to provide necessary support for the child 
and for those who have the care of the child, as well as for other forms of prevention 
and for identification, reporting, referral, investigation, treatment and follow-up of 
instances of child maltreatment described heretofore, and, as appropriate, for 
judicial involvement.  
 
Article 24.3: 
States Parties shall take all effective and appropriate measures with a view to abolishing 
traditional practices prejudicial to the health of children. 
 
Article 24.4: 
States Parties undertake to promote and encourage international co-operation with a view 
to achieving progressively the full realization of the right recognized in the present article. In 
this regard, particular account shall be taken of the needs of developing countries. 
 
Article 27.1: 
States Parties recognize the right of every child to a standard of living adequate for the child's 
physical, mental, spiritual, moral and social development. 
 
Article 37: 
States Parties shall ensure that:  
(a) No child shall be subjected to torture or other cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or 
punishment. Neither capital punishment nor life imprisonment without possibility of release 
shall be imposed for offences committed by persons below eighteen years of age;  
 
Article 39: 
States Parties shall take all appropriate measures to promote physical and psychological 
recovery and social reintegration of a child victim of: any form of neglect, exploitation, or 
abuse; torture or any other form of cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment; 
or armed conflicts. Such recovery and reintegration shall take place in an environment which 
fosters the health, self-respect and dignity of the child.

1.15 Kigali Declaration (2023) Women Deliver  
 
Signatories of this letter are calling on donors, multilateral entities and national governments 
to:  
 
1. Significantly increase funding towards the end FGM/C sector Every year, 4 million 
girls are at risk of being cut. That means 11,000 girls per day. More funders need to 
resource the end FGM/C sector to protect women and girls’ right to health, to bodily 
integrity, to freedom from violence and to enjoy their sexuality. How?  
● Invest in efforts geared towards ending FGM/C and remodel their traditional funding 
practices to more effectively support grassroots organisations.  
● Prioritize fundingg for ending FGM/C in national budgets through direct budget 
allocations and integration of FGM/C into other budgets, such as healthcare, education, 
etc.  
● Expand the funding direction beyond the 31 priority countries to include countries 
which have not traditionally been prioritised, including in Asia and the Middle East.  
● Put in place an accountability system to track the financial commitments with a focus 
on how much, to who, and in which geographies resources have been allocated.  
● Explore new collaboration between traditional donors, private sector, governments 
and NGOs, particularly around innovative financing mechanisms  
2. Shift the funding to grassroots organisations It has been demonstrated that one of 
the most effective ways to end FGM/C is to engage the community at a grassroots 
level. Despite this, the funding to grassroot organisations remains patchy, short-term 
and not sustainable. The complexity of accessing funds through a myriad of 
bureaucratic hurdles and requirements and often for funds that are too short-term 
in nature is a major challenge for community organisations. Funding models need to 
be rooted in the power of purposeful grant-making and best respond to grassroots’ 
needs ensuring:  
● Sustainable, multi-year funding  
● Funding to support core/administrative costs  
● Flexible funding with simplified requirements for application and reporting  
● Capacity building/strengthening and leadership development support to grassroots 
organisation to access and manage funds  
● Funding grounded in feminist principles that disrupt the power imbalance and shift the 
power to women and girls

3. Convene a Global Commitment Summit The adoption of SDG 5, target 5.3.2 to end 
female genital mutilation by 2030 placed end FGM/C firmly on the global agenda. 
However the ambition to end FGM/C by 2030 was not matched with financial 
commitments. With less than 7 years left until the 2030 deadline, a critical action is 
needed to resource the end FGM/C sector. Stakeholders gathered at the Women 
Deliver End FGM/C Pre-Conference unanimously agree that a Global Summit for 
increased commitments and investment to achieve the elimination of FGM/C is 
urgently needed.  
We need:  
● Champion countries that will drive the efforts to finance FGM/C sector globally, calling for 
increased investment, efficiency and equity in funding.  
● To act with urgency and convene a Global Commitment Summit during a United Nations 
General Assembly session or other key UN gathering by 2025 to secure financial 
commitments and actions needed  
● The Summit to catalyse the resourcing of end FGM/C work, with needs and priorities of 
grassroot organisations firmly at its heart.  
 
Now’s the time to #Closethefundinggap  
Female Genital Mutilation/Cutting is a global practice that requires a global response. We 
are in a race against time. Without immediate action and significant increase in funding, 
there will be millions more girls affected by 2030 and beyond. Failure is not an option 
anymore.

CONSENSUS DOCUMENTS 
 
3.1 
Beijing Declaration and Platform for Action of the Fourth World Conference on 
Women  
 
Article 39:  
The girl child of today is the woman of tomorrow. The skills, ideas and energy of the girl child 
are vital for full attainment of the goals of equality, development and peace. For the girl child 
to develop her full potential she needs to be nurtured in an enabling environment, where 
her spiritual, intellectual and material needs for survival, protection and development are 
met and her equal rights safeguarded. If women are to be Platform for Action equal partners 
with men, in every aspect of life and development, now is the time to recognize the human 
dignity and worth of the girl child and to ensure the full enjoyment of her human rights and 
fundamental freedoms, including the rights assured by the Convention on the Rights of the 
Child, universal ratification of which is strongly urged. Yet there exists worldwide evidence 
that discrimination and violence against girls begin at the earliest stages of life and continue 
unabated throughout their lives. They often have less access to nutrition, physical and mental 
health care and education and enjoy fewer rights, opportunities and benefits of childhood 
and adolescence than do boys. They are often subjected to various forms of sexual and 
economic exploitation, paedophilia, forced prostitution and possibly the sale of their organs 
and tissues violence and harmful practices such as female infanticide and prenatal sex 
selection, incest, female genital mutilation and early marriage, including child marriage. 
 
Article 93:  
Discrimination against girls, often resulting from son preference, in access to nutrition and 
health-care services endangers their current and future health and well-being. Conditions 
that force girls into early marriage, pregnancy and childbearing and subject them to harmful 
practices, such as female genital mutilation, pose grave health risks. Adolescent girls need, 
but too often do not have, access to necessary health and nutrition services as they mature. 
Counselling and access to sexual and reproductive health information and services for 
adolescents are still inadequate or lacking completely, and a young woman’s right to privacy, 
confidentiality, respect and informed consent is often not considered. Adolescent girls are 
both biologically and psychosocially more vulnerable than boys to sexual abuse, violence and 
prostitution, and to the consequences of unprotected and premature sexual relations. The 
trend towards early sexual experience, combined with a lack of information and services, 
increases the risk of unwanted and too early pregnancy, HIV infection and other sexually 
transmitted diseases, as w 
ell as unsafe abortions. Early childbearing continues to be an impediment to improvements 
in the educational, economic and social status of women in all parts of the world. Overall, for

young women early marriage and early motherhood can severely curtail educational and 
employment opportunities and are likely to have a long-term, adverse impact on the quality 
of their lives and the lives of their children. Young men are often not educated to respect 
women’s self-determination and to share responsibility with women in matters of sexuality 
and reproduction. 
 
3.2 
General Assembly Declaration on the Elimination of Violence against Women  
 
Article 2: 
Violence against women shall be understood to encompass, but not be limited to, the 
following: 
(a)  
Physical, sexual and psychological violence occurring in the family, including 
battering, sexual abuse of female children in the household, dowry-related violence, 
marital rape, female genital mutilation and other traditional practices harmful to 
women, non-spousal violence and violence related to exploitation, including rape, 
sexual abuse, sexual harassment and intimidation at work, in Physical, sexual and 
psychological violence occurring within the general community educational 
institutions and elsewhere trafficking in women and forced prostitution. 
(b)  
Physical, sexual and psychological violence perpetrated or condoned by the State, 
wherever it occurs. 
 
Article 4: 
 
States should condemn violence against women and should not invoke any custom, tradition 
or religious consideration to avoid their obligations with respect to its elimination. 
 
3.3 
Programme of Action of the International Conference on Population and 
Development (ICPD) 
 
4.22  
Governments are urged to prohibit female genital mutilation wherever it exists and 
to give vigorous support to efforts among non-governmental and community organizations 
and religious institutions to eliminate such practices. 
 
5.5  
Governments should take effective action to eliminate all forms of coercion and 
discrimination in policies and practices. Measures should be adopted and enforced to 
eliminate child marriages and female genital mutilation. Assistance should be provided to 
persons with disabilities in the exercise of their family and reproductive rights and 
responsibilities. 
 
7.6  
All countries should strive to make accessible through the primary health-care 
system, reproductive health to all individuals of appropriate ages as soon as possible and no 
later than the year 2015. Reproductive health care in the context of primary health care 


 
 
COMPENDIUM OF INTERNATIONAL AND NATIONAL LEGAL FRAMEWORKS ON

should, inter alia, include: family-planning counselling, information, education, 
communication and services; education and services for prenatal care, safe delivery and 
post-natal care, especially breast-feeding and infant and women’s health care; prevention 
and appropriate treatment of infertility; abortion as specified in paragraph 8.25, including 
prevention of abortion and the management of the consequences of abortion; treatment of 
reproductive tract infections; sexually transmitted diseases and other reproductive health 
conditions; and information, education and counselling, as appropriate, on human sexuality, 
reproductive health and responsible parenthood. Referral for family-planning services and 
further diagnosis and treatment for complications of pregnancy, delivery and abortion, 
infertility, reproductive tract infections, breast cancer and cancers of the reproductive 
system, sexually transmitted diseases, including HIV/AIDS should always be available, as 
required. Active discouragement of harmful practices, such as female genital mutilation, 
should also be an integral component of primary health care, including reproductive health-
care programmes. 
 
7.35  
Violence against women, particularly domestic violence and rape, is widespread, and 
rising numbers of women are at risk from AIDS and other sexually transmitted diseases as a 
result of high-risk sexual behaviour on the part of their partners. In a number of countries, 
harmful practices meant to control women’s sexuality have led to great suffering. Among 
them is the practice of female genital mutilation, which is a violation of basic rights and a 
major lifelong risk to women’s health. 
 
7.40  
Governments and communities should urgently take steps to stop the practice of 
female genital mutilation and protect women and girls from all such similar unnecessary and 
dangerous practices. Steps to eliminate the practice should include strong community 
outreach programmes involving village and religious leaders, education and counselling 
about its impact on girls’ and women’s health, and appropriate treatment and rehabilitation 
for girls and women who have suffered mutilation. Services should include counselling for 
women and men to discourage the practice. 
 
12.13  Research on sexuality and gender roles and relationships in different cultural settings 
is urgently needed, with emphasis on such areas as abuse, discrimination and violence 
against women; genital mutilation, where practised; sexual behaviour and mores; male 
attitudes towards sexuality and procreation, fertility, family and gender roles; risk-taking 
behaviour regarding sexually transmitted diseases and unplanned pregnancies; women’s and 
men’s perceived needs for methods for regulation of fertility and sexual health services; and 
reasons for non-use or ineffective use of existing services and technologies. 
 
48.  
Governments should give priority to developing programmes and policies that foster 
norms and attitudes of zero tolerance for harmful and discriminatory attitudes, including son 
preference, which can result in harmful and unethical practices such as prenatal sex 
selection, discrimination and violence against the girl child and all forms of violence against 
women, including female genital mutilation, rape, incest, trafficking, sexual violence and

exploitation. This entails developing an integrated approach that addresses the need for 
widespread social, cultural and economic change, in addition to legal reforms. The girl child’s 
access to health, nutrition, education and life opportunities should be protected and 
promoted. The role of family members, especially parents and other legal guardians, in 
strengthening the self-image, self-esteem and status and in protecting the health and well-
being of girls should be enhanced and supported.

Women, Business and the Law 2023 is the ninth in a series 
of annual studies measuring the laws that affect women’s 
economic opportunity in 190 economies. The project pres-
ents eight indicators structured around women’s interac-
tions with the law as they progress through their lives and 
careers: Mobility, Workplace, Pay, Marriage, Parenthood, 
Entrepreneurship, Assets, and Pension.
Women, Business and the Law 2023 identifies barriers to 
women’s economic participation and encourages the reform 
of discriminatory laws. This year, the study also includes 
new research, a literature review, and analysis of 53 years 
of reforms for women’s rights. The indicators build evidence 
of the critical relationship between legal gender equality 
and women’s employment and entrepreneurship.
By examining the economic decisions that women make 
throughout their working lives, as well as the progress 
made toward gender equality over the last 53 years, 
Women, Business and the Law continues to make important 
contributions to research and policy discussions about the 
state of women’s economic empowerment. Data in Women, 
Business and the Law 2023 are current as of October 1, 
2022.

An economy is more dynamic, strong, and resilient when all citizens—women and men alike—can 
contribute equally. When laws restrict women’s voice and agency, fail to protect them from violence, 
or discriminate them at the workplace and in retirement, women are less likely to participate fully in 
the economy and to contribute with their talent, knowledge, and skills. Economies that limit women’s 
contributions cannot reach their full potential.
The World Bank’s Women, Business and the Law project shows how equal legal rights and freedoms 
for women can be achieved around the world. It tracks how the law affects women’s decisions and 
opportunities at various stages in their lives—from the essentials of freedom of movement and safety 
to the reconciliation of work and parenting, from the ability to own assets and access credit to the 
ability to inherit their fair share of property. It works under the premise—well supported by economic 
evidence—that a legal environment in which women have the same rights and opportunities as men 
leads to economic prosperity for everyone. 
This year’s Women, Business and the Law report brings some promising news. Last year, despite 
multiple overlapping global crises, most parts of the world strengthened legal gender equality across 
all areas measured. Economies in Sub-Saharan Africa led the way in 2022, enacting more than half of 
the reforms recorded. Many of these reforms addressed laws affecting women’s pay and careers after 
having children—the areas with the most room to improve.
This year’s report goes far beyond recent developments. It also provides the first comprehensive 
assessment of annual data gathered over more than five decades—from 1970 through 2022. Progress 
in this period has been remarkable: overall, economies have adopted more than 2,000 laws enhancing 
legal gender parity. The average Women, Business and the Law score has improved by about two-
thirds as a result. Some of the strongest performers are economies that began with large gender-
related legal gaps in the 1970s. The evidence is unmistakable: progress is possible when the right 
forces are at play.
Yet this good news is not nearly enough. The rate of progress has been uneven across economies, 
regions, and areas of reform. Only 14 economies have reached legal gender parity. The rate of catch-up 
has been slow. At today’s pace, it will take several decades to close the legal gender gap across the 
world. This means that millions of young women entering the workforce today will have to wait until 
retirement—many even longer—before they get equal rights. 
FOREWORD


WOMEN, BUSINESS AND THE LAW 2023
x
Today, nearly 2.4 billion working-age women live in economies that do not grant them 
the same rights as men. The year 2022 marks a low point in one respect: economies 
adopted the fewest gender-related reforms in more than two decades. In some 
economies, moreover, a troubling trend is under way: previously granted rights are being 
reversed. Women, Business and the Law 2023 finds that some economies have made 
legal changes to strip women of existing rights, including the freedom of movement and 
the ability to get a job. Some have imposed additional burdens, like the duty of obedience 
to the husband. There is a lot to be done. 
Empowering women is not just a matter of social justice. It is a prerequisite for economic 
development, especially at a time when global growth is slowing and economies will need 
to summon all of their productive energies to generate a lasting recovery from the crises 
of recent years. The World Bank Group is committed to help in instituting policies to 
ensure that women become full and equal participants in that recovery.

Overview
Women, Business and the Law 2023 assesses laws and regulations on women’s economic participation 
in 190 economies, from 1970 to 2022. The report covers eight related areas: Mobility, Workplace, Pay, 
Marriage, Parenthood, Entrepreneurship, Assets, and Pension. The data offer objective and measurable 
benchmarks for evaluating global progress toward legal gender equality.
Women, Business and the Law’s analysis starts from the premise that gender equality is 
essential for ending extreme poverty and boosting shared prosperity. Equal treatment of women 
under the law is associated with larger numbers of women entering and remaining in the labor force 
and rising to managerial positions. It generates higher wages for women and facilitates more women 
owning a business.
Globally, on average, women enjoy only 77 percent of the legal rights that men do; and 
nearly 2.4 billion women of working age around the world live in economies that do not grant 
them the same rights as men. Although great achievements have been made in recent decades, 
much remains to be done (map 1).
Moreover, in 2022, the global pace of reforms toward equal treatment of women under the 
law has slumped to a 20-year low. This “reform fatigue” is a potential impediment to economic 
growth and resilience at a critical time for the global economy. As global economic growth is slowing, all 
countries need to mobilize their full productive capacity to confront the confluence of crises besetting 
them. Reforming in ways that encourage women to contribute to the economy as employees and 
entrepreneurs will both level the playing field and make the economy more dynamic and resilient in 
the face of shocks.
At the current pace of reform, it would take at least 50 years to approach legal gender 
equality everywhere. In many countries, a woman entering the workforce today will retire before 
gaining the same rights as men. In the areas measured in the report, it will take over 1,500 reforms to 
reach substantial legal gender equality around the world.
Gender-related reforms in 2022
In 2022, only 34 gender-related legal reforms were recorded across 18 economies—the lowest 
number since 2001. The global average score on the Women, Business and the Law index rose just 
half a point to 77.1 from 2021 to 2022. Most reforms focused on increasing paid leave for parents and 
fathers, removing restrictions on women’s work, and mandating equal pay.

•
• Sub-Saharan Africa made significant progress last year. The region accounted for more 
than half of all reforms worldwide in 2022, with seven economies—Benin, the Republic 
of Congo, Côte d’Ivoire, Gabon, Malawi, Senegal, and Uganda—enacting 18 positive 
legal changes.
•
• In East Asia and Pacific, China introduced a parental leave policy, Indonesia enacted 
legislation protecting women from sexual harassment in employment, and Mongolia 
mandated equal remuneration for work of equal value and introduced paid paternity 
leave. 
•
• The Middle East and North Africa also passed some significant reforms. Bahrain equal-
ized the ages at which women and men can retire with full pension benefits. Iraq pro-
hibited gender-based discrimination in financial services. Malta introduced paid parental 
leave for each parent.
•
• Economies in other regions also enacted reforms: Costa Rica, Jamaica, Kazakhstan, the 
Netherlands, and Pakistan.
Global progress toward gender equality in the last 
five decades
Women, Business and the Law 2023 provides a comprehensive assessment of global 
progress toward gender equality in the law over the past five decades. Spanning from 
1970 to today, Women, Business and the Law’s historical database is an important tool for 
helping policy makers, civil society, the private sector, and researchers to understand the 
legal barriers facing women over time and around the world.

MAIN MESSAGES
There is growing comparative evidence showing why countries decide to remove 
legal barriers for women. A country’s institutional landscape, coupled with a stable 
economy and higher human capital, create the foundation for embarking on a reform 
process. The activism of women’s groups and strategic multistakeholder coalitions help 
to create the momentum. Research and data are important tools for making the case 
for reforms. International legal mandates and technical assistance from international 
development partners offer key support for reformers seeking to identify good practices. 
These factors encourage and support the enactment of successful reforms.
Five main takeaways outline how, where, and how fast laws have changed since 
1970:
1.  
Since 1970, the global average Women, Business and the Law score has improved 
by about two-thirds, rising from 45.8 to 77.1 points. The first decade of this century 
saw strong gains toward legal gender equality. Between 2000 and 2009, more than 
600 reforms were introduced, with a peak of 73 reforms in 2002 and 2008. Since then, 
reform fatigue seems to have set in, particularly in areas that involve long-established 
norms, such as the rights of women to inherit and own property. 
2.  
Today, just 14 economies—all high income—have laws giving women the same rights 
as men, and progress has been uneven across regions and over time. Worldwide, 
every economy has implemented at least one reform since 1970; however, 176 economies 
still have room to improve. Equality of economic opportunity for women is highest in 
Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) high-income economies, 
where the average score on the Women, Business and the Law index is 95.3 points, and 
lowest in the Middle East and North Africa region, where the average score is 53.2 points.
3.  
Progress across the areas measured has also been uneven, with most reforms in 
the areas of Workplace and Parenthood. Across all topic areas, most reforms have 
been issued to address domestic violence, prohibit gender discrimination in employment, 
and legislate on sexual harassment. The 1970s saw economies largely removing gender 
barriers on Mobility. The 1980s were characterized by isolated breakthroughs. The 
1990s set the stage for a steep increase in women’s legal empowerment, which picked 
up in the 2000s, a golden decade for women’s legal rights in which economies reformed 
in all areas, with a remarkable spike in reforms under the Workplace indicator.
4.  
Economies with historically larger legal gender gaps have been catching up, 
especially since 2000. Faster progress is being made in economies that have had 
historically lower levels of gender equality. This is the case, for instance, in some countries 
in the Middle East and North Africa, and in Sub-Saharan Africa. Economies that have 
the highest growth rates in the Women, Business and the Law score include Bahrain, 
Botswana, the Democratic Republic of Congo, Indonesia, São Tomé and Príncipe, Saudi 
Arabia, South Africa, Togo, and the United Arab Emirates.
5.  
The catch-up effect has been happening across all areas covered by Women, 
Business and the Law, but the pace of progress has been uneven. The catch-up 
effect in closing the gender gap has been strongest in the laws affecting Workplace, 
followed by Parenthood, Pay, and Marriage. The catch-up effect has been weakest in 
laws related to Mobility, Assets, and Entrepreneurship.
Governments cannot afford to sideline as much as half of their population. Denying 
equal rights to women across much of the world not only is unfair to women, but also is a 
barrier to countries’ ability to promote green, resilient, and inclusive development. Women 
cannot afford to wait any longer to reach gender equality. Neither can the global economy.

The state of women’s legal rights
Policies empowering women strengthen the economy and are critical for lasting 
progress in development. Slowing global growth, the rising risks of climate change, 
conflict, and the lingering effects of COVID-19 have dealt a major setback to this 
progress in recent years—with disproportionate effects on the lives and livelihoods of 
women (Akrofi, Mahama, and Nevo 2021; De Paz, Gaddis, and Muller 2021; ILO 2022; 
Torres et al. 2021). 
Women, Business and the Law’s analysis of 53 years of laws affecting women’s 
economic rights shows why greater gender equality is essential for ending extreme 
poverty and boosting shared prosperity. Equal treatment of women under the law 
is associated with larger numbers of women entering and remaining in the labor force 
and rising to managerial positions. It generates higher wages for women and facilitates 
more women owning a business.1 Reforming in ways that incentivize women to enter 
the labor force—as employees and entrepreneurs—will both level the playing field and 
make the economy more robust in the face of shocks (Halim, O’Sullivan, and Sahay 2022; 
Ubfal 2022). Women, Business and the Law has tracked these regulatory changes from 
1970 to today, offering objective benchmarks for measuring global progress toward 
gender equality in 190 economies. 
Women, Business and the Law 2023 details the current state of women’s 
legal rights. The ninth in a series, this study presents a data set and index structured 
around a woman’s working life (figure ES.1) as well as findings from historical data that 
highlight opportunities for reform and can inspire efforts to seek equality. Governments, 
the private sector, and civil society can use this framework to identify and remove 
barriers to women’s economic empowerment and boost labor force participation and

entrepreneurship. The World Bank Group’s lending and technical assistance operations 
use Women, Business and the Law data to provide the analytical underpinnings for 
project design. Other institutions—such as the Atlantic Council; Equal Measures 2030; 
the Georgetown Institute for Women, Peace and Security; the Heritage Foundation; the 
Millennium Challenge Corporation; and UN Women—use it to influence policy change.
Women still have only three-quarters of the legal rights of men, and nearly 
2.4 billion women of working age still do not have the same legal rights as men. 
The global average Women, Business and the Law score is 77.1 out of 100 in 2022, 
only half a point higher than in 2021. Today, 14 economies (Belgium, Canada, Denmark, 
France, Germany, Greece, Iceland, Ireland, Latvia, Luxembourg, the Netherlands, 
Portugal, Spain, and Sweden) score 100 on the index, meaning that women are on an 
equal legal standing with men in all of the areas measured (table ES.1). Nearly 90 million 
women of working age gained legal equality in the last decade. Yet, 2.4 billion women 
of working age do not have the same legal rights as men. More than half live in East 
Asia and Pacific (710 million) and South Asia (610 million), followed by Sub-Saharan 
Africa (330 million), Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) 
high income (260 million), Latin America and the Caribbean (210 million), Middle East 
and North Africa (150 million), and Europe and Central Asia (140 million). Economies 
with average scores above the global average of 77.1 tend to be in OECD high income, 
Europe and Central Asia, and Latin America and the Caribbean regions (figure ES.2). 
The Middle East and North Africa as well as South Asia have the lowest average scores. 
Progress toward equal treatment for women has fallen to its weakest pace in 
20 years. Since 2021, 18 economies introduced a total of 34 reforms toward gender 
equality across all areas measured by Women, Business and the Law (figure ES.3), 
the lowest number since 2001. Sub-Saharan Africa accounts for more than half of all 
reforms, with seven economies—Benin, the Republic of Congo, Côte d’Ivoire, Gabon, 
Malawi, Senegal, and Uganda—enacting 18 positive legal changes. Among these, two 
economies stand out: Côte d’Ivoire and Gabon. Côte d’Ivoire enacted reforms prohibiting 
discrimination in access to credit based on gender, addressing domestic violence, and

equal remuneration for work of equal value, and removing all job restrictions for women. 
As a result, for the first time in 53 years, two economies from the Sub-Saharan Africa 
region score above 90 on the Women, Business and the Law index, and the average 
score for the Sub-Saharan Africa region has surpassed the score of the East Asia and 
Pacific region. Other countries that reformed this year are Bahrain, China, Costa Rica, 
Indonesia, Iraq, Jamaica, Kazakhstan, Malta, Mongolia, the Netherlands, and Pakistan.
Most reforms focused on increasing paid leave for parents and fathers, 
removing restrictions on women’s work, and mandating equal pay. Although the 
Parenthood and Pay indicators have the most room to improve, with average scores 
of 56.4 and 70.0, respectively, they also registered the most reforms in 2022. Seven 
economies in five regions reformed laws measured by the Parenthood indicator. 
Specifically, China, Malta, and the Netherlands mandated paid parental leave, Costa 
Rica, Malawi, and Mongolia introduced paid paternity leave, and Senegal amended its 
law to prohibit the dismissal of pregnant women. Additionally, six economies in four 
regions enacted reforms captured by the Pay indicator. Costa Rica, Côte d’Ivoire, Gabon, 
Kazakhstan, and Senegal removed restrictions on women’s work. Gabon and Mongolia 
also introduced provisions mandating equal remuneration for work of equal value.
Data trends from five decades of reform
The Women, Business and the Law historical data highlight the benefits of reform. 
Spanning from 1970 to today, Women, Business and the Law’s historical database is an 
important tool for understanding the geographic and chronological dimensions of legal 
barriers faced by women. Removing legal constraints for women has been shown to be 
associated with various metrics of women’s economic opportunity and socioeconomic 
development. The ability to act autonomously and work without legal limitations also 
allows women to access better jobs and can lead to higher labor force participation 
overall (Amin and Islam 2015; Htun, Jensenius, and Nelson-Nuñez 2019). Moreover, 
freedom from discrimination helps women to become entrepreneurs and access finance 
(Islam, Muzi, and Amin 2019). Evidence is also growing that family leave policies are 
correlated with women’s empowerment. For example, Amin and Islam (2022) find a 
significant positive association between the legislated number of maternity leave days 
and female employment at the firm level. Evidence is emerging that gender equality is 
important not just for women’s economic empowerment but also for macroeconomic 
development. Recent studies show that removing legal barriers for women can help 
poorer economies to catch up with richer economies (Sever 2022). This growing body of 
evidence highlights the need to continue working to level the legal playing field between 
women and men.
Comparative evidence is also growing to show why countries decide to remove 
legal barriers for women. For example, a common driver for the expansion of women’s 
rights is the evolution of a country’s political system. The extent to which various 
groups can participate in the decision-making institutions of a democratic economy 
matters, as does a civil society that is actively challenging societal order or mobilizing 
action. Education and higher human capital are also important enablers for the expansion 
of women’s rights. Tertilt et al. (2022) show that economic development is an important 
predictor of women’s rights. Case studies of historical legal reforms aimed at gender 
equality in the Democratic Republic of Congo, Ethiopia, India, Kenya, São Tomé and 


WOMEN, BUSINESS AND THE LAW 2023

Príncipe, South Africa, Togo, and the United Arab Emirates reveal that international legal 
mandates, technical assistance from international development partners, the activism 
of women’s groups, strategic multistakeholder coalitions, and the use of research and 
data are all decisive factors encouraging and supporting the enactment of successful 
reforms. Efforts to shed more light on what factors are driving reforms can guide future 
policy and expedite movement toward legal gender equality. They are a crucial first step 
toward identifying key challenges and opportunities to accelerate women’s economic 
empowerment around the world.
Five main takeaways outline how, where, and how fast laws have changed 
since 1970. To provide more legal rights for women, economies have reformed existing 
laws or introduced new legislation. By tracking these changes, Women, Business and 
the Law highlights the remarkable catch-up effect in some economies. The findings 
underscore that reform efforts are happening around the world, irrespective of income 
level, culture, or region. 
1.	 In the last five decades, the global average of the Women, Business and the 
Law score has improved by about two-thirds as a result of more than 2,000 
reforms expanding women’s legal rights. Over the course of 53 years, econo-
mies have introduced an impressive 2,151 reforms in all 35 areas of measurement, 
increasing the global average Women, Business and the Law score from 45.8 to 
77.1 points. Between 2000 and 2009, more than 600 reforms were introduced, with 
a peak of 73 annual reforms in 2002 and 2008. However, since then, the pace of 
reform has slowed, and economies seem to be exhibiting reform fatigue in address-
ing notoriously stickier areas of the law such as Mobility and Assets. For instance, 
reforming inheritance laws will inevitably challenge long-established norms, and 
legislative measures might be slow and incremental. In 2022, only 34 reforms were 
recorded, a historic low since 2001. It will take another 1,549 reforms to reach legal 
gender equality everywhere.
2.	 Only 14 economies have achieved legal gender parity in 2022, as measured by 
Women, Business and the Law, and progress has been uneven across regions 
and over time. Worldwide, every economy has implemented at least one reform 
since 1970, allowing women to move one step closer to gender parity under the law. 
Despite this progress, gender disparities persist in all regions and all income levels: 176 
economies still have room to improve, and at the recent pace of reform they will need 
at least another 50 years to reach 100.2 This means that a young woman entering the 
workforce today will retire before she is able to enjoy gender equal rights during her 
working life. Yet given the rather slow progress in some areas, such as reforming laws 
related to inheritance rights, it may take many more years to close existing gender 
gaps across all areas. Today, equality of economic opportunity for women is highest 
in OECD high-income economies, where the average score on the Women, Business 
and the Law index is 95.3 points, and lowest in the Middle East and North Africa 
region, where the average score is 53.2 points. There are also regional differences in 
the timing of reform efforts. Economies in Latin America and the Caribbean reformed 
substantially in the 1990s. Sub-Saharan Africa saw a significant spike in reforms in 
the 2000s, with the adoption of the Protocol to the African Charter on Human and 
Peoples’ Rights on the Rights of Women in Africa (the Maputo Protocol). The Middle 
East and North Africa’s reform efforts did not take off until the 2010s (figure ES.4); 


EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
7
since then, the region has implemented more reforms (100) than in the previous four 
decades combined (81 reforms from 1970 to 2009). The differences in reform efforts 
have been less pronounced across income groups.
3.	 Progress across the areas measured has also been uneven, with most reforms 
in Workplace and Parenthood. Across all topic areas, most reforms have been 
issued to address domestic violence, prohibit gender discrimination in employment, 
and legislate on sexual harassment. Reform efforts have unfolded in waves, with 
a focus on specific areas. In the 1970s, economies largely removed gender barri-
ers on mobility, allowing married women to choose where to live, and introduced 
legislation addressing the dismissal of pregnant workers. In some instances, the 
removal of restrictions on women’s mobility was due to the overhaul of legacy civil 
codes that had been in place during colonial times. In other cases, archaic national 
legislation dating back to the previous century was finally updated. The 1980s was 
a decade of isolated breakthroughs, but the 1990s set the stage for a steep increase 
in women’s legal empowerment: 19 economies mandated equal remuneration for 
work of equal value, 10 granted women at least 14 weeks of paid maternity leave, 
and 38 introduced domestic violence legislation. The 2000s were a golden decade 
for women’s legal rights: economies reformed in all areas, with a remarkable spike 
in reforms under the Workplace indicator.

4.	 Economies with historically larger legal gender gaps have been catching up, 
especially since 2000. Analysis of the annual growth rate in the Women, Business 
and the Law index shows that faster progress is being made in economies that 
have had a historically lower level of gender equality. The two economies that have 
had the fastest annual growth rates in the index are São Tomé and Príncipe and the 
United Arab Emirates. While reform in São Tomé and Príncipe has been a gradual 
process since 1970, with some intermediary periods where the pace of reform 
slowed and then, after a time, gathered pace again, reforms in the United Arab 
Emirates took off only in recent years. Other economies that are among the fastest 
reformers, with annualized growth rates in the index in the top fifth percentile, 
are Bahrain, Botswana, the Democratic Republic of Congo, Indonesia, Saudi Arabia, 
South Africa, and Togo. 
5.	 The catch-up effect has been happening across all areas covered by Women, 
Business and the Law, but the pace of progress has been uneven. The catch-up 
effect has been strongest in the laws affecting women’s decisions to enter and 
remain in the labor force, followed by those affecting women’s work after the birth 
of a child, and the right to receive equal pay (figure ES.5). The catch-up effect has 
been weakest in laws related to agency and freedom of movement, and property 
and inheritance rights.

Overcoming legal gender barriers benefits all of society—not just women. 
Although reform efforts are happening around the world, appalling gaps in women’s 
rights persist today in all regions, especially in the areas of leave policies and equal 
pay. Ninety-three economies still do not mandate equal remuneration for work of equal 
value, and some economies are even reversing rights for which women have fought 
long and hard. Nevertheless, women worldwide remain important agents of change in 
demanding their equal rights and opportunities, even under dire circumstances. Policy 
makers should reinforce these efforts because overcoming legal gender barriers benefits 
the economy as a whole, not just women. The Women, Business and the Law data 
present a unique opportunity to assess countries’ performances in closing legal gender 
gaps and to inspire policy makers to remove existing discriminatory laws. Although 
great achievements have been made over the last five decades, more and better data 
are needed, and more needs to be done worldwide to ensure that good intentions are 
accompanied by tangible results—that is, equal opportunity under the law for women. 
In an era when economies everywhere will need to mobilize every ounce of productive 
capacity to generate sufficient growth, sidelining half the population constitutes an 
egregious waste. Women cannot afford to wait another 50 years or more to reach 
equality. Neither can the global economy.
What’s next
Women, Business and the Law continues to expand its substantial research agenda. 
Recognizing the formidable challenges facing women, Women, Business and the Law 
is exploring several areas of research aimed at expanding the reach of the indicators 
(figure ES.6). Building on evidence and preliminary data collected and analyzed over 
the last several years, Women, Business and the Law 2024 will publish data on new 
indicators measuring childcare legislation and implementation of the law. The team is 
also expanding data and analysis on measures related to women’s safety and embarking 
on a review of areas in which legal equality has almost been reached, such as the right 
of women to sign a contract in the same way as men, a right now granted by 99 percent 
of economies. This pilot data set will be published in Women, Business and the Law 
2024 and fully integrated into the index and report in the 2025 edition.

Introduction
After decades of subjugation to her husband’s will, in 2021 a woman in South Africa 
challenged his marital power in court and won (Arekapudi and Mazoni 2022). In Costa 
Rica in 2022, the female president of the Legislative Assembly successfully ensured 
that a woman could freely pursue a job of her choice, eliminating archaic prohibitions 
on the types of work a woman can perform (Sequeira 2022). In Côte d’Ivoire, the work 
of national government agencies tasked with consolidating the rights of women led to 
the adoption of the country’s first law on domestic violence and legislation enabling 
women’s employment and entrepreneurship. 
These women’s successes are recent, and yet they build on the accomplishments 
of those who have tirelessly worked to remove the legal barriers that hinder women’s 
full enjoyment of rights and opportunities. Their stories are powerful examples of the 
elements that make change possible, illustrating lessons learned and proving that 
achieving gender equality takes a concerted effort by persons from all corners of 
society. 
Women, Business and the Law has tracked regulatory changes in some of the areas 
key to women’s economic empowerment from 1970 to today, offering objective and 
measurable benchmarks for global progress toward gender equality in 190 economies. 
Gender equality is essential to end extreme poverty and boost shared prosperity. Yet 
discriminatory laws persist in all regions, threatening not only women’s human rights, 
but also their ability to participate meaningfully in the global economy. In 2010 no 
woman in the world had the same legal rights to economic opportunity as men in 
the areas measured by Women, Business and the Law. Between 2010 and 2022, this 
situation changed, as more than 93 million women of working age (15–64) gained the 
same legal rights as men in the areas measured (figure 1.1). However, the progress is

not fast enough, as worldwide across all regions, nearly 2.4 billion women of working 
age still do not have the same legal rights as men. More than half of these women live 
in East Asia and Pacific (710 million) and South Asia (610 million), followed by Sub-
Saharan Africa (330 million), Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development 
(OECD) high income (260 million), Latin America and the Caribbean (210 million), 
Middle East and North Africa (150 million), and Europe and Central Asia (140 million). 
Women, Business and the Law 2023 identifies where and in what areas of study this 
inequality prevails, providing an important resource for achieving women’s economic 
empowerment. The ninth in a series, this study presents a data set and index that 
highlight opportunities for reform and findings from historical data that can inspire 
current and future efforts to seek equality.
For nearly 15 years, Women, Business and the Law has served as a framework that 
governments and civil society alike can use to identify and remove barriers to women’s 
success and boost labor force participation. Since 2020, an index structured around 
a woman’s working life has guided the analysis, celebrating the progress made while 
emphasizing the work still to be done (box 1.1). 
The findings are an important tool for use in policy discussions about the state of 
women’s empowerment and overall economic resilience. Indeed, research undertaken 
by the Women, Business and the Law team reveals that more equal laws are associated 
with more women working, higher wages, more women-owned businesses, and 
more women in managerial positions.1 With evidence mounting of these positive 
effects, gender equality needs to become an international priority. This development 
is especially relevant in view of the pressing challenges that continue to confront the 
global economy (World Bank 2023). The threat of a global recession, climate crisis, 
conflict, and the lingering effects of COVID-19 not only threaten economic resilience, 
but also disproportionately affect women’s lives and livelihoods (Akrofi, Mahama, 
and Nevo 2021; De Paz, Gaddis, and Muller 2021; ILO  2022; Torres  et  al. 2021).

BOX 1.1	 ABOUT WOMEN, BUSINESS AND THE LAW 
Women, Business and the Law identifies laws that restrict women’s economic inclusion. Its index aligns different areas 
of the law with the economic decisions that women make throughout their lives and careers (figure B1.1.1).
The eight Women, Business and the Law indicators coincide with milestones that many women experience and 
reflect the international legal framework. The questions under each indicator were chosen based on evidence from the 
economic literature and statistically significant associations with outcomes related to women’s economic empowerment, 
such as employment and business ownership. The international legal framework on women’s human rights, as set out in the 
Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination against Women (CEDAW) and International Labour Organization 
conventions, also provides underlying justification for each question. The indicators measure explicit discrimination in the 
law as well as the legal protection of rights and provision of benefits—areas in which reforms can bolster women’s economic 
participation.
In total, 35 questions are scored across the eight indicators. Indicator-level scores are obtained by calculating the 
simple average of the four or five binary questions within that indicator and scaling the result to 100. Overall scores are then 
calculated by taking the average of each indicator, with 100 representing the highest possible score and indicating equal rights 
and opportunities for men and women in all 35 areas of measurement (see the data notes in appendix A for details). This 
score can be interpreted as the absence of legal inequality for a woman throughout her working life. Although other rights 
not part of the Women, Business and the Law data set are certainly also important, these 35 areas constitute a foundational 
set of rights essential for equal economic opportunities between women and men throughout their working lives. The final 
score summarizes good-practice legal provisions on gender parity in each economy. Thus, the index serves as a gauge of the 
enabling environment for women as entrepreneurs and employees.
The Women, Business and the Law index relies on a series of assumptions. This approach has both strengths and limita-
tions (table B1.1.1). For example, the woman in question is assumed to reside in the main business city of her economy and to 
be employed in the formal sector. This approach may not capture restrictions applicable to areas outside the main business city 
or to informal workers. However, four of the eight indicators have direct relevance for women who work in the informal ­
sector—
for example, laws affecting women’s freedom of movement, their ability to own or inherit property, or protections against 
domestic violence. Additionally, legal protections affecting the formal sector provide a foundation for economic inclusion and 
offer incentives for women to be employed in or start businesses in the formal sector and to transition from the informal to the 
formal economy. Still, the interplay of other factors, such as access to quality education, infrastructural and institutional capac-
ity, and social and cultural norms may prevent women from entering the workforce. This study recognizes these limitations. 
Although they may come at the expense of specificity, they also ensure that the data are reliable and comparable.

To construct the index, Women, Business and the Law surveys more than 2,000 experts in family, labor, and 
violence against women legislation. Questionnaire respondents include lawyers, judges, academics, and members of civil 
society organizations working locally on gender issues. Although many legal experts contribute over consecutive report cycles, 
the base of respondents has been expanded over time to include new voices and contributions. Women, Business and the 
Law collects the texts of relevant laws and regulations and verifies responses to questionnaires for accuracy. Responses 
are validated against codified sources of national law in areas such as labor, social security, civil procedure, violence against 
women, marriage and family, inheritance, nationality, and land. All of the data used to construct the index are available on the 
Women, Business and the Law website (https://wbl.worldbank.org).

METHODOLOGICAL STRENGTHS AND LIMITATIONS OF THE WOMEN, BUSINESS 
AND THE LAW INDEX 
Feature
Strength
Limitation
Use of standardized 
assumptions
Data are comparable across economies, and methodology is 
transparent.
The scope of data is smaller; only regulatory reforms in the areas 
measured can be tracked systematically.
Coverage of largest 
business city only
Data collection is manageable, and data are comparable.
In federal economies, data may be less representative where 
laws differ across locations. 
Focus on the most 
populous group
Data are comparable across economies where parallel legal 
systems prescribe different rights for different groups of women.
Restrictions that apply to minority populations may not be 
captured.
Emphasis on the 
formal sector 
Attention remains centered on the formal economy, where 
regulations are most relevant.
The reality faced by women in the informal sector, which may be 
a significant population in some economies, is not fully reflected.
Measure of codified 
laws only
Indicators are actionable because the law is what policy makers 
can change.
Where systematic implementation of legislation is lacking, 
regulatory changes alone will not achieve the desired results; 
social and cultural norms are not considered.

BOX 1.1	 ABOUT WOMEN, BUSINESS AND THE LAW (continued)
Reforming in ways that incentivize women to enter the labor force as employees and 
entrepreneurs will both level the playing field and make the economy more robust in 
the face of shocks (Halim, O’Sullivan, and Sahay 2022; Ubfal 2022) (box 1.2). While 
progress has been made over the last 53 years, at the current pace of legal reform 
it will take at least another 50 years for economies to reach equality in the areas 
measured. Women, Business and the Law will continue to explore these challenges 
and the critical relationship between economic outcomes and to build the case for 
gender equality in all areas of life.
Data update
Women, Business and the Law 2023 updates its index to account for legal reforms 
that took place from October 2, 2021, to October 1, 2022. During that period, the 
global average score rose about half a point over the previous cycle, reaching 77.1 out 
of 100. Five years ago, the global average score was 73.8. Women in just 14 of 190 
economies have the same legal rights as men in all of the indicators measured: Belgium, 
Canada, Denmark, France, Germany, Greece, Iceland, Ireland, Latvia, Luxembourg, 
the Netherlands, Portugal, Spain, and Sweden (table 1.1). For the complete Women, 
Business and the Law data set, see the economy data in appendix B.

BOX 1.2	 HOW WOMEN, BUSINESS AND THE LAW DATA AND FINDINGS CAN BE USED TO PROMOTE POLICY REFORM
Women, Business and the Law research and data can provide important evidence to inform the design of policy interven-
tions that promote women’s economic empowerment. Increasingly, the World Bank Group’s lending and technical assistance 
operations are using Women, Business and the Law data to provide the analytical underpinnings for project design. In 2019, 
the World Bank’s Investing in Human Capital Development Policy Financing supported the government of Madagascar’s 
ambitious agenda to improve human capital, including by strengthening legal frameworks for the protection of women and 
girls. Women, Business and the Law data helped to identify critical legislative gaps, such as lack of legal protection against 
domestic violence, leading to the adoption of the country’s first violence against women legislation. The following year, the 
Lifting Legal Barriers to Women’s Employment in Azerbaijan project provided technical assistance to the government of 
Azerbaijan and led to the adoption of labor reforms removing job restrictions for women identified by Women, Business and 
the Law data. In 2021, Women, Business and the Law data informed the design of Benin’s Unlocking Human and Productive 
Potential Development Policy Operation and helped to identify key legal gender gaps in the area of gender-based violence. 
In Sierra Leone, the 2022 Inclusive and Sustainable Growth Development Policy Operation used Women, Business and the 
Law data to advance reforms prohibiting sex-based discrimination in the provision of financial services. 
Women, Business and the Law data are also used by other institutions to influence policy change. For example, together 
with UN Women and the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development, Women, Business and the Law 
contributes its data and expertise to inform Sustainable Development Goal 5.1.1 (https://unstats.un.org/sdgs/metadata/): 
“Whether or not legal frameworks are in place to promote, enforce, and monitor equality and non-discrimination on 
the basis of sex.” The Millennium Challenge Corporation (https://www.mcc.gov/who-we-select/indicator/gender-in-the​
-economy-indicator) uses Women, Business and the Law data in its Gender in the Economy indicator, which is used 
to assess economies’ commitments to promoting gender equality. Several other institutions use Women, Business and 
the Law data to construct their own indexes, such as the Georgetown Institute for Women, Peace, and Security’s 
index (https://giwps.georgetown.edu/the-index/), the Heritage Foundation’s Index of Economic Freedom (https://
www.heritage.org/index/), the Atlantic Council’s Freedom and Prosperity Indexes (https://www.atlanticcouncil.org​
/programs/freedom-and-prosperity-center/), the International Trade Center’s SheTrades Outlook (https://intracen.org​
/resources/tools/shetrades-outlook), the Equal Measures 2030’s SDG Gender Index (https://www.equalmeasures2030​
.org/2022-sdg-gender-index/), and the Global Governance Forum’s Gender Equality and Governance Index (GEGI) 
(https://globalgovernanceforum.org/global-issues/gender-equality/), among others. Arizona State University’s Global 
SDG 5 Notification Tool (https://globalfutures.asu.edu/sdg5-training/) also provides users with insight into country-level 
progress on legal gender equality and aims to inform parliamentarians about the status of their laws ahead of the United 
Nations Human Rights Council’s Universal Periodic Review for their country. 
These are just a few examples of how different stakeholders can use Women, Business and the Law data to achieve the same 
goal—removing discriminatory laws that hinder women’s economic inclusion and promoting good-practice legislation that 
incentivizes women’s ­
economic participation.
Globally, 44 economies in six regions score above 90. Among them, 28 are in OECD 
high income, 7 are in Europe and Central Asia, 3 are in East Asia and Pacific, and 3 are 
in Latin America and the Caribbean. In 2022, 1 economy in the Middle East and North 
Africa region (Malta) and 2 economies in the Sub-Saharan Africa region (Côte d’Ivoire 
and Gabon) also score above 90 for the first time. No economy in the South Asia region 
has reached a score of 90. 
Economies in the low- and middle-income groups made significant progress 
toward legal gender equality in the past year. Seven lower-middle-income economies 
implemented 15 reforms, leading to an increase of 0.8 points in average score. Upper-
middle-income economies also improved their average score by 0.8 points with 
12 reforms. Low-income economies followed with an increase of 0.2 points, reaching 
an overall score of 66.3, after enacting four reforms. Although the average score of

high-income economies is 86.9, some economies in this group still have scores as low 
as 29.4. In fact, in all income groups gaps of at least 48 points are evident between 
the lowest- and highest-scoring economies, indicating that women still face significant 
differences in their legal standing even in places at similar levels of economic development 
(figure  1.2). Many factors drive differences in scores within the same income level. 
For example, conflict and fragility can contribute to lack of reforms toward gender 
equality. Violent conflicts and high levels of institutional and social fragility affect the 
quality of policy and institutions, including government capacity to undertake reforms. 
Out of 27 low-income economies examined, 11 economies with the lowest Women, 
Business and the Law scores are also fragile and conflict-affected situations, consisting 
of Afghanistan, Chad, Eritrea, Guinea-Bissau, Mali, Niger, Somalia, South Sudan, Sudan, 
the Syrian Arab Republic, and the Republic of Yemen. 
The state of women’s legal equality varies within and among regions. Regions with 
average scores higher than the global average of 77.1 are OECD high income, Europe 
and Central Asia, and Latin America and the Caribbean. The Middle East and North Africa 
and South Asia remain the two regions with the lowest average scores (figure 1.3). The 
gap between the lowest-scoring and highest-scoring economies in Sub-Saharan Africa 
and the Middle East and North Africa is close to 65 points. Economies in these regions 
can learn from their neighbors or inspire others to reform. 
Thanks to reforms in Sub-Saharan Africa, this year the pattern among regions has 
changed for the first time since 2004. This year, Sub-Saharan Africa surpassed the

average score of East Asia and Pacific for the first time in the past 53 years (figure 1.4, 
panel a). OECD high-income economies continue to have the highest average scores, 
followed by Europe and Central Asia and Latin America and the Caribbean. The region 
that advanced the most due to reform efforts is the Middle East and North Africa, the 
lowest scoring region, with an increase of over 9 points in its overall score over the 
last five years. Economies in Sub-Saharan Africa and South Asia, with scores below 
the global average, have increased their score by more than 4 points since 2017, 
substantially improving legal equality for women (figure 1.4, panel b).
Seven of the eight indicators improved in score over the past year (annex 1B). 
For  Mobility, legal changes widening the gender gap resulted in a decrease of 
0.1 points. This year, apart from Parenthood (56.4), Pay (70.0), and Pension (73.9), 
all other indicators score 80 or above on average. The Pay indicator has the second-
to-lowest average score, and it increased by 1.3 points—the largest improvement 
among all indicators. This is followed by an increase of 0.7 points in Parenthood and 
Workplace, respectively, and 0.5 points in Entrepreneurship. The indicator sequence has 
not changed substantively, with Mobility, Entrepreneurship, and Assets still having the 
highest scores and Pay and Parenthood having the lowest scores today as well as five 
years ago (figure 1.5, panel a). Despite lower scores, however, indicators that improved 
the most are Pay and Workplace, both with an increase of at least 5 points over the 
last five years (figure 1.5, panel b). Parenthood’s score also has increased by 4.5 points 
since 2017, indicating improved legal equality for women after they have children.

Where are laws changing?
In the past year, 18 economies in all regions introduced 34 reforms across all indicators 
to accelerate progress toward achieving legal gender equality (table 1.2). 
Seven economies in Sub-Saharan Africa—Benin, the Republic of Congo, Côte d’Ivoire, 
Gabon, Malawi, Senegal, and Uganda—implemented 18 positive reforms (box 1.3). The 
region accounts for more than half of all reforms in the past year (figure 1.6, panel a). 
The International Labour Organization (ILO) estimates suggest that in Sub-Saharan 
Africa, 90 percent of working women are employed informally compared to 83 percent 
of men (ILO 2022), meaning that they are employed in work that does not provide 
legal protections. In Côte d’Ivoire alone, more than 80 percent of women are employed 
in nonagricultural work in the informal sector compared with 60 percent of men. This 
means that the impact of some of the reforms, including Workplace, Pay, Parenthood, 
and Pension, and the reality faced by women in the informal sector may not always 
be fully reflected. Informality is an important factor in understanding the distinction 
between legal changes on paper and their application in practice. However, reforms in 
Mobility, Marriage, Entrepreneurship, and Assets apply to women regardless of their 
official employment. 
Three economies in the East Asia and Pacific region—China, Indonesia, and 
Mongolia—also enacted five positive legal changes. Despite the region’s relatively 
high average score, two economies in Latin America and the Caribbean implemented 
four changes boosting gender equality: Costa Rica and Jamaica. Three reforms were

BOX 1.3	 SPOTLIGHT ON SUB-SAHARAN AFRICA 
Women, Business and the Law has observed a rise in reform activity in Sub-Saharan Africa since October 2021, leading 
to a 1.1-point increase in the region’s average score. Eighteen positive reforms were implemented by seven economies—
Benin, the Republic of Congo, Côte d’Ivoire, Gabon, Malawi, Senegal, and Uganda—accounting for more than half of all 
reforms captured. Although from the same region, these economies are relatively diverse: two are low income (Malawi and 
Uganda), four are lower middle income (Benin, the Republic of Congo, Côte d’Ivoire, and Senegal), and one is upper middle 
income (Gabon). Progress is also occurring widely across the whole region, with reforms captured in West, Central, East, 
and southern Africa and across all indicators, with the exception of Pension. 
Côte d’Ivoire and Gabon have had impressive reform agendas, becoming the first two economies in Sub-Saharan Africa 
with scores of at least 90. Both economies embarked on substantial revisions of legislation affecting women’s pay. Côte 
d’Ivoire’s Decree No. 2021-919 removed all existing restrictions on the employment of women in certain types of jobs 
and industries, whether dangerous, arduous, or morally inappropriate. Similarly, Gabon’s 2021 amendments to its labor 
code removed restrictions on women’s ability to engage in hazardous and arduous work. Furthermore, the amendments 
mandate for the first time that for work of equal value, equal remuneration should be provided for all workers regard-
less of their origin, opinion, sex, or age. Senegal also reformed in this area, removing restrictions on women working in 
industrial jobs.
The Republic of Congo and Côte d’Ivoire also made remarkable strides in addressing gender-based violence against women. 
Specifically, both economies adopted laws addressing domestic violence for the first time. Both laws address all forms of 
domestic violence, including physical, sexual, psychological, and economic forms of abuse, with criminal penalties and special 
procedures to obtain protection orders against perpetrators. The Republic of Congo also criminalized sexual harassment in 
employment, with penalties ranging from a fine to imprisonment of up to 10 years. 
Benin and Côte d’Ivoire promoted women’s financial inclusion by prohibiting gender-based discrimination in financial ser-
vices. Benin’s 2022 Order No. 2349-5 prohibits credit institutions, banking-type financial institutions, and decentralized 
financial systems from discriminating based on gender in access to credit. Côte d’Ivoire’s Law No. 2021-893 amends the 
criminal code to sanction sex-based discrimination in the provision of goods, credit, and services with a fine and imprisonment 
of up to three years. 
Change in the region is also occurring in areas harder to reform because of inherent costs, such as paid family leave, or 
social norms, such as mobility and inheritance. In Malawi in 2021, amendments to the Employment Act entitled fathers 
to at least two weeks of paternity leave with full pay. Senegal amended its Labor Code and prohibited the dismissal of 
pregnant women. Gabon and Uganda removed important restrictions on women’s mobility. By eliminating the requirement 
for married women to obtain marital authorization when applying for a passport, Gabon made it easier for women to travel 
abroad. Uganda’s 2022 Succession (Amendment) Act also removed an existing requirement for women to acquire their 
husbands’ domicile upon marriage by adopting gender-neutral language that now allows a woman to choose where to live 
in the same way as a man. Remarkably, the same act also amended previous provisions that favored sons over daughters 
in inheritance and denied widows any entitlements to the matrimonial home and other property, redefining a legal heir to 
include females and guaranteeing equal distribution of the property of an intestate. The law was passed after years of delay 
to update antiquated provisions and finally addressed a notoriously difficult area of reform. 
Although the sequencing of reforms in these economies has varied based on the specific country context, the changes in 
the region demonstrate that both targeted and comprehensive reforms are possible with the right conditions and motiva-
tions. As this pattern of steady reform demonstrates, holistic reform efforts can lead to a considerably more favorable legal 
environment for working women in Sub-Saharan Africa.

implemented in the Middle East and North Africa: one each in Bahrain, Iraq, and Malta. 
The remaining reforms were in Kazakhstan in Europe and Central Asia, the Netherlands 
among the OECD high-income economies, and Pakistan in South Asia.
Among the economies that implemented at least one reform that improved legal 
equality for women, lower-middle-income economies account for close to 45 percent, 
upper-middle-income economies for more than 35 percent, and low-income economies 
for more than 10 percent (figure 1.6, panel b). High-income economies account for the 
smallest share of all reforms (9 percent), but these economies already had the highest 
scores. Among the economies in Sub-Saharan Africa that improved laws on gender 
equality, Côte d’Ivoire stands out for having implemented four reforms in three areas: 
Entrepreneurship, Marriage, and Pay. More specifically, it enacted laws that prohibit 
discrimination in access to credit based on gender and that address domestic violence 
and include physical, sexual, and psychological abuse. Côte d’Ivoire also no longer 
restricts women’s employment in certain types of jobs and industries. As a result of 
these reforms, Côte d’Ivoire increased its score by almost 12 points (from 83.1 to 95.0) 
and became one of the first two countries in Sub-Saharan Africa to score at least 90. 
The other country is Gabon, which continued down the reform path it launched last year 
by equalizing the process for obtaining passports, mandating equal remuneration for 
work of equal value, and removing all job restrictions for women. 
Most positive reforms in 2022 were within the Parenthood and Pay indicators 
(figure 1.7). These indicators also have the most room to improve. Seven economies 
in five regions implemented changes to laws as measured by the Parenthood indicator. 
Specifically, three economies (China, Malta, and the Netherlands) mandated paid 
parental leave, three economies (Costa Rica, Malawi, and Mongolia) introduced paternity 
leave for fathers, and one economy (Senegal) amended its law to prohibit the dismissal 
of pregnant women.

Within the Pay indicator, six economies in four regions enacted reforms that 
lift restrictions on hiring women or introduce equal remuneration for work of equal 
value. Costa Rica, Côte d’Ivoire, Gabon, Kazakhstan, and Senegal removed restrictions 
on women’s work. Gabon and Mongolia introduced provisions mandating equal 
remuneration for work of equal value. Sub-Saharan African economies enacted a breadth 
of reforms not present in other regions, encompassing seven of the eight indicators. 
Two economies enacted laws diminishing equality. In March 2022, Saudi Arabia 
enacted its first codified personal status law, which regulates matters related to family 
life. The law restricts a married woman’s ability to choose where to live and travel, and 
it further requires her to obey her husband. Saudi Arabia previously enacted legislation 
to protect women from sexual harassment and prohibit gender discrimination in 
employment and access to finance, and it eliminated all restrictions on women’s 
employment. In 2019, Saudi Arabia allowed women to be head of household, removed 
the legal obligation for a married woman to obey her husband, and improved women’s 
mobility by removing restrictions on obtaining a passport and traveling abroad. Legal 
amendments also equalized a woman’s right to choose where to live and to leave the 
marital home. However, the personal status law promulgated by Royal Decree M73 
reintroduced some of the restrictions into the law.

WOMEN, BUSINESS AND THE LAW 2023

The interim Taliban administration in Afghanistan issued guidelines and decrees 
also limiting women’s freedom of movement and ability to get a job (annex 1B). The 
recent regime change in the country has negatively affected both the economy and 
the welfare of the Afghan people, in particular, women and girls. Access to secondary 
education for girls has been significantly constrained, and nearly half of women in 
salaried work have lost their employment (World Bank 2022a). More recently, the 
government suspended university education for all female students and barred 
women from working in nongovernmental organizations in the country. Many of 
these restrictions are imposed by verbal decree and remain unpublished by an official 
source. Given the uncertainty over the applicable legal framework in Afghanistan, 
and because unwritten rules are not considered under the Women, Business and the 
Law methodology, the final count of changes widening the legal gender gap there are 
based only on what is identifiable in writing. 
Mobility
Women’s agency through freedom of movement, as measured by the Mobility indicator, 
is a fundamental first step toward economic empowerment. Mobility tracks differences 
in the laws and regulations that govern the rights of men and women to choose where 
to live, travel outside the home, obtain a passport, and leave the marital home at will. 
Constraining a woman’s physical mobility, often justified as a way to ensure her safety, 
affects a woman’s bargaining position in the household and can lead to her lower 
participation in the economic and political spheres (Milazzo and Goldstein 2019). For 
example, limitations on a woman’s mobility are likely to influence her decision to enter 
the labor force and to engage in entrepreneurial activity (Htun, Jensenius, and Nelson-
Nuñez 2019). Conversely, removing restrictions on mobility can provide a woman with 
better employment opportunities (Hallward-Driemeier and Gajigo 2015). For example, 
Hallward-Driemeier and Gajigo (2015) show that changes in Ethiopia’s family law 
strengthened a woman’s economic rights and made it more likely that she would work 
outside the home. Furthermore, removing travel restrictions not only encourages a 
woman’s entry into the private sector workforce, but also increases her likelihood of 
becoming a business owner (Islam, Muzi, and Amin 2019). 
Although Mobility has the lowest number of restrictions among all Women, Business 
and the Law indicators, 55 economies worldwide continue to limit a woman’s freedom 
of movement. Two of these—the Islamic Republic of Iran and South Sudan—score 0 
on this indicator. In 14 economies, a woman cannot freely leave the home, and in 
10 economies a woman cannot travel abroad in the same way as a man (table 1.3). 
In 34 economies, a woman cannot freely choose where to live in the same way as a 
man. In April 2022, Uganda enacted a reform in this area by adopting the Succession 
(Amendment) Act, which, in addition to equalizing inheritance rights, allows a married 
woman to choose where to live. 
Constraints on a woman’s mobility may also be due to discriminatory and more 
burdensome access to formal identification documents. In 28 economies, women 
are still required to present additional documentation when applying for a passport. 
In  alignment with the country’s Equality Strategy, Gabon reformed in this area by 
making passport application procedures equal for men and women. Previously, Gabon 
required the husband’s authorization when issuing a passport to a married woman. 


The State of Women’s Legal Rights
25
Now, a  woman is no longer required to provide this authorization or a copy of her 
husband’s identity card when applying for a passport. 
In contrast to these amendments enhancing gender parity, Afghanistan and Saudi 
Arabia enacted laws that reduce gender equality in the area of Mobility. The interim 
Taliban administration in Afghanistan introduced legal restrictions on a woman’s ability 
to travel abroad without a male chaperone. Saudi Arabia’s first personal status law, 
based on the rules of Islam’s Sharia law, regulates issues related to marriage, divorce, 
and custody of children. The law now includes restrictions on a married woman’s ability 
to choose where to live and to travel. 
Workplace
The Workplace indicator analyzes laws affecting a woman’s decision to enter the labor 
market, including her legal capacity and ability to work as well as protections against 
discrimination and sexual harassment. Evidence shows that a woman’s inability to 
choose her profession freely is negatively associated with her chances of employment 
(Gonzales et al. 2015) and that the removal of legal barriers can encourage a woman’s 
participation in paid employment and in jobs requiring higher levels of education 
(Hallward-Driemeier and Gajigo 2015). Moreover, data from the United States show that 
sexual harassment in the workplace can negatively affect a woman’s career trajectory 
and increase financial stress (McLaughlin, Uggen, and Blackstone 2017).
In 69 economies, a woman faces obstacles affecting her decision to work, such as 
not being able to choose whether to work and not being protected from discrimination 
and sexual harassment in employment. In 19 economies, a woman cannot get a job 
in the same way as a man. In December 2021, the interim Taliban administration in 
Afghanistan issued a ban on women’s ability to work. Now, Afghan women are mostly 
restricted from working outside the home. 
Discrimination in employment is also a barrier to a woman’s ability to get a job and 
to progress in a career. Although antidiscrimination legislation is positively associated 
with a woman’s employment and earnings, in 30 economies gender discrimination in

employment is still not prohibited (table 1.4). This number remained unchanged over 
the past year—that is, no economy implemented reforms in this area.
Sexual harassment in the workplace remains pervasive and continues to have 
regressive effects on women across the world. In addition to its physical and psychological 
impacts on women (Thurston et al. 2019), sexual harassment contributes to the gender 
wage gap (Folke and Rickne 2022; Hegewisch, Forden, and Mefferd 2021). Lower 
employee productivity, lower company profitability, and higher labor costs are some 
of the economic and social consequences of sexual harassment borne by employers, 
governments, and society as a whole (Hejase 2021). For example, a study conducted 
in Australia found that lost output deriving from sexual harassment cases totals about 
US$2 billion annually (Deloitte Access Economics 2019).
Yet globally, 43 economies still lack legislation addressing sexual harassment in 
employment. Of the 147 economies that have such legislation, 8 do not have criminal 
penalties or civil remedies for such behavior. Over the last year, the Republic of Congo, 
Indonesia, and Jamaica implemented reforms in this area. In May 2022, the Republic of 
Congo adopted the Law Mouebara, which addresses and criminalizes multiple forms of 
violence against women, including sexual harassment in employment. Indonesia’s 2022 
Law on the Crime of Sexual Violence addresses both physical and nonphysical sexual 
harassment in employment and provides for criminal penalties and civil remedies. 
Jamaica adopted legislation exclusively addressing sexual harassment—the Sexual 
Harassment (Protection and Prevention) Act 2021, which also establishes civil remedies 
for survivors of such acts. 
Pay
The Pay indicator examines whether laws are in place to ensure equal remuneration 
between men and women for work of equal value and whether they allow a woman to 
work at night, in industrial jobs, and in jobs deemed dangerous in the same way as a 
man. Gender biases and inequalities that have placed women in low-wage occupations, 
such as differences in jobs and hours worked, as well as women’s disproportionate 
caregiving responsibilities, contribute to the gender wage gap. The persistence of this 
income disparity between men and women negatively affects the growth of a country’s 
economy. Globally, in 119 economies legal frameworks could be improved to contribute 
to reducing the gender pay gap.

Ninety-seven economies mandate equal remuneration for work of equal value 
(table 1.5). Over the last year, Gabon and Mongolia adopted new labor laws introducing 
the principle of equal remuneration for work of equal value for both men and women in 
alignment with the ILO Equal Remuneration Convention, 1951 (No. 100).
The adoption of more equal laws pertaining to a woman’s access to the workforce 
is positively associated with more equal labor market outcomes and improved human 
capital, which cannot be met only by male workers (Rostiyanti, Hansen, and Harison 
2020). Restricting a woman’s occupational choices leads not only to job segregation, 
but also to labor market distortions, lower wages for women, and less innovation and 
productivity (Blau and Kahn 2017). Prohibiting a woman from working the night shift 
may negatively affect her career progression (Islam, Muzi, and Amin 2019). Currently, 
21 economies limit a woman’s capacity to work at night. In 49 economies, a woman 
cannot work in hazardous jobs, and in 65 economies she cannot work in the same 
industries as a man (table 1.6).
Over the last year, Costa Rica, Côte d’Ivoire, Gabon, Kazakhstan, and Senegal 
eliminated restrictions on women’s job opportunities. In March 2022, Costa Rica 
adopted the Decree for the Freedom of Employment Choice of Women, which reformed 
the labor code by lifting restrictions on women’s work in jobs deemed dangerous. The 
restriction now affects only persons under the age of 18. Côte d’Ivoire also reformed 
in this area by adopting Decree No. 2021-919, which not only allows women to work 
in jobs classified as dangerous, but also removes restrictions on the employment

of women in certain types of jobs and industries. Gabon enacted a new labor code, 
which, by repealing the previous one, lifted all restrictions on a woman’s capacity to 
work in certain industries and hazardous jobs. Kazakhstan amended its labor code and 
removed the list of jobs restricted to women as well as a prohibition on their work 
under dangerous conditions. Similarly, Senegal adopted Decree No. 2021-1469, which 
removed restrictions to employing women who are not pregnant and not nursing in 
certain industries. 
Marriage
The Marriage indicator assesses legal constraints related to marriage and divorce, which 
also have critical effects on women’s economic empowerment. Where and while these 
constraints persist, women’s agency and decision-making powers within the household 
are weakened (Branisa, Klasen, and Ziegler 2013). Currently, women continue to face 
such restrictions in 89 economies. Family matters such as marriage and divorce, as 
well as other domestic issues such as domestic violence, are often considered private 
and determined by social norms and beliefs regarding a woman’s role in society—one 
that is typically limited to the household. Reforming inherently private matters such as 
marriage is often met with opposition under the guise of protecting national or cultural 
identity. This antagonism cements the power equilibrium between men and women, 
with tangible consequences for women’s economic empowerment.
Research shows that restraining a woman’s ability to become head of household 
may negatively affect the representation of women in the labor force (Gonzales et al. 
2015). Laws constraining women from becoming head of household diminish women’s 
legal capacity and economic autonomy and may exclude them from public decision-
making in multiple domains, such as the water sector (box 1.4). Where only husbands 
can become head of household, they are unilaterally assigned intrahousehold decision-
making and given authority to make decisions on behalf of the family or to administer 
finances and assets exclusively (Hallward-Driemeier and Hasan 2013). When women 
have less bargaining power at home, their capacity to pursue professional roles outside 
their household is constrained (Htun, Jensenius, and Nelson-Nuñez 2019). This adverse 
power dynamic is aggravated when women cannot end a marriage because they do 
not have equal divorce rights (Christopherson et al. 2022). Unequal rights in marriage 
and divorce can further jeopardize women’s financial security (Voena 2015). In turn, 
recent research has shown that domestic violence legislation is associated with reduced 
mortality for women (Amin, Islam, and Lopez-Claros 2021). By the same token, research 
has also shown that political stability is a key factor affecting the implementation of 
these policies, since people need the policies to be in place for long enough to be able 
to commit to deviating from the norm (Poyker 2021).
In the past year, no economy enacted reforms allowing women to be head of 
household in the same way as a man, resulting in 28 economies maintaining such a 
restriction (table 1.7). Similarly, no economy instituted reforms making it easier for 
women to divorce or remarry. Women remain unable to obtain a divorce in the same 
way as men in 46 economies. And globally, women in 68 economies face restrictions 
on their ability to remarry. Specifically, a woman is required to observe a waiting period 
varying between 90 and 365 days or prove that she is not pregnant before remarriage, 
whereas no conditions are placed on a man’s remarriage. For example, although Benin

BOX 1.4	 WOMEN’S RIGHTS AND CONSTRAINTS RELATED TO THE WATER SECTOR
Access to clean water is essential for human well-being, and women play a central role in the provision, management, and 
safeguarding of water (Ray 2007). Climate change has a significant impact on water resources, and this impact is often felt 
disproportionally by women and girls (UN 2022). In many economies, women and girls bear the responsibility for collect-
ing water for their households, which can result in lost time and opportunities for work, education, and leisure. As water 
becomes scarce and weather patterns change, women and girls are often responsible for collecting water from farther away 
or during more dangerous conditions. Climate change also creates more pressure on water, affecting the productivity of the 
agriculture sector, which is often the main source of income and food security for many women in developing economies 
(Mbwo et al. 2019). 
Laws measured by Women, Business and the Law can have enabling or restricting implications for women’s access 
to water and related infrastructure. For instance, laws preventing women from being head of household or owning land 
may adversely affect women’s access to water and sanitation services; they may also systematically exclude women from 
participating in decision-making institutions related to water management where such power may be a formal or informal 
prerequisite (Meinzen-Dick and Zwarteveen 1998; van Koppen 2001). Growing evidence shows that equal participation of 
women in such decision-making institutions is positively associated with better water management, better-functioning water 
systems, expanded access, and economic and environmental benefits (Imburgia et al. 2020; Najjar, Baruahb, and El Garhi 
2019).a In addition to facing tangible barriers of representation in water management, laws can also constrain women from 
working in typically male-dominated sectors, including several areas related to water. Specifically, laws can create barriers for 
women regarding type of work and work hours. 
As of today, women are restricted from working in areas related to water in 20 economies.b Restrictions are in place across 
five regions, with the largest gaps concentrated in the Eastern Europe and Central Asia region, followed by Sub-Saharan 
Africa. For example, women in the Kyrgyz Republic cannot work as divers performing underwater work, such as plumbing 
blasters or pipe grinders, and cannot work repairing or cleaning sewer systems and trenches. Similarly, in Nigeria, women are 
prevented from working at night in sewers or water works. Globally, women tend to be underrepresented in the water sector, 
with less than one in five water workers being a woman (World Bank 2019b). The gender gap in water-related employment 
needs to be addressed in order to reach international commitments on water and sanitation for all (World Bank 2019).
a. While not measured by Women, Business and the Law, economies across regions specifically enshrine gender quotas into law, ensuring 
gender-balanced decision-making bodies—for example, Honduras in Acuerdo 300-2017 on Basin Organizations; Nepal in Irrigation Rules, 
2056 (2000); or Namibia in Water Resource Management Act, 2013.
b. Azerbaijan, Bangladesh, Belarus, Belize, China, Dominica, Kyrgyz Republic, Madagascar, Malaysia, Nigeria, Papua New Guinea, the 
Russian Federation, Sierra Leone, Somalia, St. Kitts and Nevis, St. Vincent and the Grenadines, Sudan, Tajikistan, Thailand, and Türkiye.

recently removed a 300-day waiting period for women, it continues to require them to 
prove that they are not pregnant before they can legally remarry.
Positive reforms under the Marriage indicator were enacted in the area of domestic 
violence, with the Republic of Congo and Côte d’Ivoire introducing legislation addressing 
this issue for the first time. In the Republic of Congo, women now enjoy legal protections 
against various forms of domestic violence, including physical, sexual, psychological, and 
economic abuse. Violators of this law can face criminal penalties, including imprisonment, 
and protection orders are available for survivors. Côte d’Ivoire, through the enactment 
of the Law Mouebara, addressed various forms of domestic violence, including physical, 
sexual, and psychological abuse. At the same time, Côte d’Ivoire amended its penal 
code, which now imposes strict penalties for acts of domestic violence. 
Domestic violence is a deprivation of agency that, besides its negative impact on 
women’s health and ability to participate actively in the labor force, leads to economic 
costs that are estimated at 5 percent of global gross domestic product (Yount et al. 
2022). Recent research shows that the negative effect of violence against women on 
economic development is aggravated in countries that also lack protective laws against 
domestic violence. Adopting and reinforcing laws against domestic violence, in addition 
to strengthening women’s decision-making power, could help to curb the prevalence 
of domestic violence and its related economic costs (Ouedraogo and Stenzel 2021). 
Further, it would improve women’s well-being in the workplace and increase their 
probability of being promoted and earning higher salaries (Gu, Li, and Peng 2022). 
Implementing domestic violence legislation is, therefore, critical to improving women’s 
participation in the labor force.
Although the pace of reform in this area is largely positive, one economy enacted 
legislation limiting women’s rights in marriage. Saudi Arabia’s Personal Status Law of 
2022 requires married women to obey their husbands. The law is not a regional exception; 
similar practices are codified in personal status laws in neighboring economies. For 
example, Bahrain, the Arab Republic of Egypt, and Kuwait still legally require married 
women to obey their husbands. 
Parenthood
The Parenthood indicator examines laws affecting a woman’s work during and after 
pregnancy, including paid leave, and laws prohibiting firms from dismissing workers 
because they are pregnant (table 1.8). Although 7 economies enacted reforms in this 
area over the past year, the law in 155 economies has gaps affecting a woman’s work 
after having children. The highest-scoring regions in this area are OECD high income 
(94.7) and Europe and Central Asia (80.9), and the lowest are Middle East and North 
Africa (35.0) and South Asia (30.0).
Before a woman gives birth, protection from dismissal due to pregnancy is crucial, 
as established in the ILO Maternity Protection Convention, 2000 (No. 183). Protection of 
pregnant employees is essential to encouraging women to participate in the workforce. 
Employment protection during pregnancy ensures that women are not unfairly 
dismissed or discriminated against because of their biological ability to bear children 
(Behari 2021). In the past year, Senegal amended its Labor Code and introduced a 
provision that prohibits the dismissal of pregnant workers. Yet 41 economies still do not 
prohibit the dismissal of pregnant women. 


The State of Women’s Legal Rights
31
The need for policy intervention also remains critical after a woman bears a child. 
Indeed, studies show a positive and statistically significant relationship between 
maternity leave and female employment (Del Boca, Pasqua, and Pronzato 2009; Ruhm 
1998). The positive relationship is even stronger when maternity leave is fully funded by 
the government rather than being underwritten by the employer (Amin and Islam 2022). 
Seventy-two economies do not mandate at least 14 weeks of paid maternity leave as 
set out by the 2000 ILO Maternity Protection Convention. The count is the same as last 
year, as over the past year, none of them introduced new paid maternity leave policies 
or increased existing ones to reach 14 weeks. Currently, 118 economies grant working 
mothers paid maternity leave of at least 14 weeks. However, of these economies, 
only 80 provide maternity benefits through public funds such as social security. In 15 
economies, the cost of maternity benefits is covered solely by the employer, while in 23 
economies the cost is shared by employers and the government.
Although job-protected maternity leave of adequate length and pay is critical, offering 
only leave for mothers, especially above a threshold of 30 weeks, can be correlated with 
fewer women in the workforce (Del Rey, Kyriacou, and Silva 2021). Studies show that 
a smaller gap between mothers’ and fathers’ leave is associated with a higher female 
labor force participation rate, suggesting that women’s participation in the workforce 
could be increased by shrinking the leave gap between parents (Hyland and Shen 2022). 
Globally, 117 economies provide fathers with paid leave for the birth of a child. Although 
a similar number of economies provide both maternity leave (118) and paternity leave 
(117), the length of leave differs drastically, with an average of 192.3 days for mothers 
and just 22.5 days for fathers. 
Over the past year, three economies introduced paid paternity leave for the first 
time. Costa Rica now grants new fathers leave of two days a week at full salary for 
the first four weeks after the birth of a child. Fathers in Malawi are now entitled to two 
weeks of paid paternity leave with full pay. And Mongolia grants at least 10 working 
days of leave to new fathers, also with full payment of the worker’s salary.
As for parental leave—that is, leave available for either parent—53 economies have 
adopted relevant legislation. Since October 2021, China, Malta, and the Netherlands 
have introduced paid parental leave policies that help parents to share care duties 
after childbirth. China introduced a parental leave policy that allocates five days of paid

parental leave to each parent each year at full pay until their child reaches age 3. The 
Work-Life Balance for Parents and Carers Regulation in Malta grants each parent the 
individual right to take two months of paid leave with half pay and an additional two 
months of unpaid leave. In the Netherlands, each parent is now entitled to nine weeks 
of paid parental leave, equivalent to 63 calendar days, at 70 percent of the employee’s 
daily wage. With this reform, the country now scores 100 in the Women, Business and 
the Law index.
Entrepreneurship
Because running a business is an alternative to wage employment and often the preferred 
choice for women, the Entrepreneurship indicator examines barriers to a woman’s 
ability to start and run a business. Unequal legal treatment of women poses a significant 
barrier to female entrepreneurs and to women who plan to start a business (see, for 
example, Htun, Jensenius, and Nelson-Nuñez 2019; Hyland and Islam 2021). Starting 
a business constitutes an important avenue for women’s economic empowerment. 
While entrepreneurship is an equally important path to prosperity for men, women 
face significantly more barriers (for an overview, De Vita, Mari, and Poggesi 2014). As a 
result, women are less likely to become entrepreneurs, with 68 women entrepreneurs 
for every 100 men entrepreneurs active globally (GEM 2022). Recent estimates 
suggest that the gender gap is highest in lower-income economies. This disparity may 
have been exacerbated by the COVID-19 pandemic, as women-led businesses were 
hit disproportionately hard and were also less likely to receive public support (Torres 
et al. 2021). Similarly, women-owned firms, while more likely to have applied for a loan 
during the COVID-19 pandemic, were more than twice as likely to have their application 
rejected than men-owned firms (Hyland et al. 2021). Policies that promote women’s 
access to finance, especially by reducing the requirements for collateral, are important 
tools to increase the productivity and resilience of women-owned firms (Hess, Klapper, 
and Beegle 2021; Ubfal 2022). Removing constraints to women’s entrepreneurship can 
have a significant impact on economic inclusion. Although 89 economies achieve the 
highest score under the Entrepreneurship indicator, in many economies women still 
face legal constraints in access to finance, limiting their chances to become successful 
entrepreneurs (table 1.9). For example, estimates by the International Finance 
Corporation indicate that female entrepreneurs have an unmet demand for credit of 
US$1.7 trillion (IFC 2017).

To date, 101 economies still lack legal provisions that expressly prohibit gender-
based discrimination in access to credit. The absence of this prohibition is evident in 
all regions, with 88 percent of economies in South Asia showing gaps in this area, 
71 percent in Sub-Saharan Africa, 68 percent in East Asia and Pacific, 66 percent in 
Latin America and the Caribbean, 55 percent in the Middle East and North Africa, 
26 percent in Europe and Central Asia, and 15 percent among OECD high-income 
economies.
Since October 2021, however, Benin, Côte d’Ivoire, and Iraq have taken steps 
to reduce discrimination in access to financial services. Benin’s Ministry of Finance 
first issued a circular to prohibit gender-based discrimination in access to credit 
just for microfinance institutions. Then in September 2022, the government issued 
a ministerial order expanding the scope of the circular to all financial institutions. 
Similarly, Côte d’Ivoire amended its penal code, now mandating that goods, credit, 
or services be provided without discrimination based on sex. As for Iraq, its reform 
efforts to prohibit gender-based discrimination in access to credit are part of the 
central bank’s commitment to enhancing financial inclusion. With the issuance of a 
central bank circular, Iraq joins regional reform efforts to include women financially 
through central bank regulations. Over the last three years, Women, Business and 
the Law captured a majority of similar legislative reforms in economies in the Middle 
East and North Africa, including in Bahrain, Egypt, Jordan, Saudi Arabia, and the 
United Arab Emirates.
The ability to sign a contract, open a bank account, and freely register a business 
are also important for a woman’s agency and ability to establish her own business. 
Of the 190 economies measured, a woman can now sign a contract in the same way 
as a man in all but two—Equatorial Guinea and Eswatini. Six economies—Cameroon, 
Chad, Equatorial Guinea, Eswatini, Guinea-Bissau, and Niger—restrict a woman’s 
ability to open a bank account in the same way as a man. And five economies—
Equatorial Guinea, Eswatini, Guinea-Bissau, Kenya, and Suriname—still restrict a 
woman’s capacity to register a business freely. In Pakistan, a May 2019 presidential 
ordinance initially repealed discriminatory provisions on registering a business. Yet 
these repeals did not become operational, as the Senate and National Assembly did 
not ratify the ordinance before its expiration after 120 days. In December 2021, 
Pakistan removed these restrictions, and a married woman no longer needs to 
present her husband’s name when registering a business. This amendment concluded 
Pakistan’s previous reform efforts to remove the restriction.
Assets
Given the central role that property can play in women’s economic opportunity, the 
Assets indicator examines gender differences in property and inheritance law. Women’s 
ownership, use, and control over resources matter for their agency and economic 
output (O’Sullivan 2017). Empirical studies suggest that an egalitarian distribution 
of assets between spouses is conducive to women’s intrahousehold decision-making 
(Behrman 2017). Strengthening inheritance rights for women, for instance, has positive 
implications for women’s education and health outcomes (Deininger et  al. 2019). 
Further, women’s property rights are also important for several other development 
outcomes, such as empowerment and the ability to exit poverty (Gaddis, Lahoti, and 


WOMEN, BUSINESS AND THE LAW 2023
34
Swaminathan 2022). The ability to register land in a woman’s name, for example, has 
been found to increase her bargaining power and ownership of assets, which, in turn, 
positively affects her consumption choices, participation in labor markets, and overall 
productivity (Deininger and Ali 2022). Access to land and property rights are often 
also prerequisites for other rights such as accessing water. Still, women face various 
barriers to owning and inheriting assets worldwide. 
Of the 190 economies studied, 76 still restrict a woman’s property rights. The 
highest-scoring regions on the Assets indicator are Europe and Central Asia, OECD high 
income, and Latin America and the Caribbean. The Middle East and North Africa region 
lags behind.
Globally, 57 economies do not recognize a woman’s nonmonetary contributions to 
a household (table 1.10). Because women perform most unpaid care and household 
work, their opportunities to look for a job and gain independent living are often limited. 
Recognizing unpaid work is thus key for women having economic autonomy on the 
dissolution of marriage. 
Nineteen economies do not grant women equal ownership rights to immovable 
property, and 18 do not grant women the right to control jointly owned assets. Yet 
studies have shown that granting a woman equal rights to property is crucial to 
improving her economic empowerment. 
Equal inheritance rights among spouses or children are also central to women’s 
economic independence and ability to access credit by using immovable property as 
collateral. Currently, 41 economies still differentiate inheritance rights between sons 
and daughters, favoring sons in the division of property. And 43 economies still do not 
grant equal inheritance rights to male and female surviving spouses. 
In 2022, only Uganda instituted new reforms under the Assets indicator. In April, 
Uganda enacted the Succession (Amendment) Act, thereby amending the principal 
act,2 which regulates the management, administration, distribution, and acquisition of 
property and the rights of a deceased person. In 2007, the Constitutional Court declared 
several provisions of the Principal Act related to succession rights to be unconstitutional 
and discriminatory against women.3 The new Succession (Amendment) Act aims to fill 
this legal void in the succession law. In addition to adopting gender-neutral language, 
the amendment specifically removes the provision that favored a male heir over a

female heir. Now, sons and daughters and male and female surviving spouses have 
equal inheritance rights. 
Historically, inheritance has been an area of slow reform. With the new Succession 
(Amendment) Act, Uganda became the first Sub-Saharan African economy to implement 
comprehensive reforms of its inheritance laws since 2011, when Mali equalized 
inheritance rights for men and women. 
Pension
Recognizing the final step in a woman’s career, the Pension indicator assesses laws 
affecting women’s economic security after retirement. In 118 economies, laws affecting 
the size of a woman’s pension have not yet been equalized. Eleven economies do not 
implement a mandatory pension scheme for private sector workers; thus, no score is 
assigned to these economies in the questions under the Pension indicator.4
Differences in the working lives of men and women stemming from career interruptions 
for care- or household-related responsibilities significantly affect the size of their old-age 
pensions. Evidence reveals that in Germany, if the pattern of interrupted careers remains 
unchanged, women’s pensions will be 20 percent less than the average wage, while in 
Sweden women’s pensions barely exceed 25 percent of the average wage. Thus, if old-
age income relied solely on pensions linked to life course earnings, women would face a 
high risk of poverty after retirement (Chłon-Dominczak et al. 2019). 
Because women tend to live longer than men and have shorter working lives due 
to unpaid care work, early retirement can have negative effects on a woman’s financial 
security in old age. Women may experience peak earnings years before retirement and, as a 
result, forgo opportunities to build savings and increase social security benefit entitlements 
(Goldin and Katz 2018). Evidence also reveals a clear association between the length of 
working life and pension income. The longer the working life, the higher the monthly 
pension benefit (Kuivalainen, Järnefelt, and Kuitto 2020). Yet in 37 economies, women can 
retire earlier than men and receive partial pension benefits, and in 63 economies women 
can retire earlier than men and receive full pension benefits (table 1.11). In 15 economies 
across all regions except South Asia, women must retire earlier than men. 
The gap between a woman’s and a man’s retirement age varies from 10 years 
(China) to 7 months (Lithuania). Some economies have introduced policies to increase

a woman’s retirement age gradually with the goal of equalizing it with a man’s. 
For  example, Bulgaria will gradually increase the retirement age for both men and 
women to 65 years by 2037. For men, the retirement age has been growing one month 
each calendar year since January 1, 2018. For women, the age will increase two months 
each calendar year until 2029 and will then increase three months each calendar year 
until it reaches 65. In Vietnam, however, the retirement ages for men and women will 
never equalize during the gradual increase. Specifically, Article 169 of the labor code 
establishes that, as of 2021, the retirement age for men will increase three months 
per year, reaching 62 years by 2028. By contrast, the retirement age for women will 
increase four months per year, reaching 60 years by 2035. In the past year, Bahrain 
amended its Social Insurance Law to equalize the age at which both men and women 
can receive full pension benefits at retirement. Previously, women in Bahrain retired at 
55, five years earlier than men. Now both men and women retire at 60.
In 107 economies, the pension system in place accounts for periods taken off from 
work to care for children (that is, paid maternity leave) in the calculation of benefits. 
This calculation is important because the size of a woman’s pension is affected by the 
number and length of interruptions in employment arising from caregiving responsibilities 
(Boeri and Brugiavini 2009; Jędrzychowska, Kwiecień, and Poprawska 2020). The scope 
of social policies and maternity leave benefits is critical to determine the position of 
mothers in the labor market and consequently the pension gap (Brugiavini, Pasini, and 
Trevisan 2011). Australia and the United States are the only two OECD high-income 
economies that do not take these periods into account.
What’s next?
Fulfilling its commitment to advance legal gender equality and women’s economic 
empowerment, Women, Business and the Law continues to pursue a substantial research 
agenda. Multiple areas of research aimed at expanding the reach of the indicators and 
considering the myriad challenges affecting women’s economic opportunities are being 
explored.

Building on evidence and preliminary data collected and analyzed over the last 
several years, Women, Business and the Law 2024 will publish data on new indicators 
measuring childcare legislation and implementation of the law (figure 1.8). Furthermore, 
Women, Business and the Law is continuing to explore new areas of research based on 
a review of literature, feedback received, and emerging trends. As a result, the team 
is expanding data and analysis on measures related to women’s safety and embarking 
on a review of areas in which legal equality has almost been reached, such as, for 
example, the right of women to sign a contract in the same way as men, now granted 
by 99 percent of economies. This pilot data set will be published in Women, Business 
and the Law 2024 and be integrated fully into the index and report in the 2025 edition. 
The following sections offer more information about each of the areas in development. 
Childcare
The enactment of policies to make childcare available, affordable, and of decent quality 
is a priority because of their potential to achieve better outcomes for women, children, 
and the economy overall. In support of this goal, Women, Business and the Law 2022 
presented a pilot data set measuring legal frameworks for the provision of childcare for 
children ages 0–2 in 95 economies. In the absence of international legal standards, the 
pilot exercise did not endorse a specific approach to the provision of childcare. Instead, 
it aimed to fill knowledge gaps and contribute to the policy dialogue by presenting 
options that governments could support to meet the needs of working mothers and 
families. 
The pilot first examined the existence of overarching childcare legal frameworks and 
found that they vary widely across regions. For example, nearly all economies in the OECD 
high-income region and Europe and Central Asia regulate public provision of childcare, 
while many economies in the Middle East and North Africa and South Asia regulate only 
childcare services provided by the private sector or by employers. The pilot then looked 
at whether the law can contribute to making childcare affordable by mandating free 
provision or financial and nonfinancial support to parents or providers. Findings show 
that, of the 55 economies in which the law regulates public childcare, about 80 percent 
do not mandate free provision. Many economies, however, provide parents with financial 
support that may be conditioned on household income or parental employment status. 
As for childcare quality, mandated parameters such as teacher-to-child ratios, maximum 
group size, and licensing vary across economies, with no clear pattern among regions. 
Since the release of the pilot data, Women, Business and the Law has published five 
regional briefs that offer a closer look at the legal frameworks for childcare provision at 
the regional level (World Bank 2022c, 2022d, 2022e, 2022f, 2022g).
Women, Business and the Law is currently scaling up the childcare module to 
150 economies and validating data through questionnaires administered to experts in 
the field. The questionnaires supplement the traditional “structure” indicators, which 
measure the existence of laws and regulations, with new “process” indicators, which 
capture the instruments designed to support implementation of the law such as universal 
legal entitlements, action plans, application procedures for financial benefits, lists of 
providers, inspections, and sanctions for noncompliance with quality standards. The 
data will be analyzed and presented in Women, Business and the Law 2024, and a new 
Childcare indicator will be added to the Women, Business and the Law index in 2025.

New empirical research will also explore associations between childcare laws and their 
specific attributes and labor market outcomes for women, both globally and by region. 
Targeting access to available, affordable, and quality childcare services can have far-
reaching positive impacts, not only for women as active participants in the labor market, 
but also for child development and economic growth. Women, Business and the Law 
data and analysis on childcare aim to shed light on these links and to inform evidence-
based policy making in support of these goals.
Measuring the law in practice
Women, Business and the Law remains committed to presenting a fuller picture of the 
legal environment for women around the world. Although laws are the first step toward 
guaranteeing gender equality, improper implementation and weak enforcement remain 
critical barriers to the realization of women’s rights and opportunities. In recognition of 
this gap, Women, Business and the Law 2022 introduced a new conceptual framework 
for measuring how the law functions in practice. This “structure-process-outcome” 
approach examines both supportive frameworks that create an enabling environment 
for working women and expert opinions of barriers to achieving gender equality on 
the ground (box 1.5). Women, Business and the Law has continued to build on the 
BOX 1.5	 UPDATE ON MEASURING THE LAW IN PRACTICE
After the publication of Women, Business and the Law 2022, expert feedback led to substantial refinement of the initial 
method to measure laws in practice. The “structure-process-outcome” method remains at the heart of the approach, guiding 
both the definition of process indicators to capture essential policy instruments and the development of expert opinion ques-
tions. The process questions have been revised to more directly link the legal index with the process questions designed to 
measure the implementing mechanisms that governments can take to institutionalize, operationalize, and enforce women’s 
equal rights and opportunities (table B1.5.1). The process questions aim to provide insight into the enabling environment for 
women entrepreneurs and employees, and may inquire whether
•
• There are additional judicial or administrative hurdles to women exercising their equal rights; 
•
• The government has taken proactive measures, such as establishing a dedicated entity, allocating budget, or using regula-
tions to put policies in practice; 
•
• Women have access to justice, specialized institutions, or fast-track procedures to enforce their rights; or
•
• Incentives and procedures make it easy for both women and men to enjoy certain benefits.

Primary data are being collected from a sample of Women, Business and the Law local experts in 55 economies, with the 
intention of scaling to 190 in the next year. As such, the questions identified are broadly applicable and allow for comparabil-
ity. They are meant to highlight some of the steps necessary to ensure that economic inclusion can be achieved after primary 
legislation is passed. Nonlegal and informal structures, social norms and attitudes, and behavior of stakeholders will not be 
measured due to resource and feasibility constraints. Firm-level and household surveys will also not be used at this stage. 
Outcome indicators will be reviewed separately and are not a focus of this exercise. The preliminary data collected so far are 
already highlighting good practices across several types of process questions (table B1.5.2).

The expert opinion component has also been adjusted in response to feedback received last year (table B1.5.3). The questions 
are now aligned more closely with the specific expertise of the lawyers, judges, and civil society organizations who participate 
in the project’s annual data collection efforts. In practice, the expert opinion statements now collect respondents’ opinions 
on the effective implementation of laws and supportive frameworks in the specific areas measured by Women, Business and 
the Law.

The current set of questions, methodology, and approach will continue to be refined before the research is expanded to all of 
the 190 economies covered by the Women, Business and the Law index. The data and analysis of the pilot will be published 
on the project’s website.

underlying concept, aiming to complete the framework by reviewing the relevant 
literature, developing a robust expert opinion questionnaire, updating questions, and 
scaling up the database. 
Revised questions will be integrated into the next round of Women, Business and 
the Law data collection efforts. The data will then be analyzed as a complement to 
the legal index, with results for 190 economies discussed as part of Women, Business 
and the Law 2024. An accompanying research paper will further describe the results 
of the complete data set, including gaps between laws on the books and practice, 
and correlate process and outcome scores with legal scores and relevant economic 
outcomes. Continuing this work over the coming years will also include expanding 
beyond expert opinions to in-depth country analysis and perception-based surveys of 
women on the ground. 
These data and analyses are aimed at promoting informed policy making and 
encouraging governments to implement laws more efficiently and comprehensively. 
They will also present an opportunity to measure the impact of reforms on the women 
they affect in practice. When complete, they will provide users with a more accurate 
representation of the environment in which women move through their lives and 
careers. The fully developed framework will then allow legal reforms to have more 
tangible impacts, boosting women’s economic inclusion and labor force participation 
worldwide.
Women’s safety
Violence against women is an extreme denial of agency and has significant costs. It 
undermines a woman’s bodily autonomy and enjoyment of fundamental rights, key 
elements of a woman’s security and freedom. Globally, one in three women—close 
to 736 million—is subject to physical or sexual violence at some point in her lifetime 
(WHO 2018). It is estimated that more than 640 million women over the age of 15 
have already experienced intimate partner violence (WHO 2018). In addition to 
direct physical and psychological harm, violence against women is a drain on human 
capital development, poverty reduction, and growth and poses obstacles to women’s 
economic empowerment. Its individual and macroeconomic repercussions include lower 
productivity (Ouedraogo and Stenzel 2021) and higher health care and justice costs 
(Commonwealth Secretariat 2020; EIGE 2021). 
In recognition of the alarming rates of violence against women worldwide and its 
disproportionate impact on women and society, since 2014 Women, Business and the 
Law has been collecting data on legal frameworks addressing this issue. Specifically, it 
has systematically collected data on two aspects of violence against women: domestic 
violence and sexual harassment in employment, including any related criminal penalties 
or civil remedies. However, to improve understanding of the current status of violence 
against women legislation, Women, Business and the Law is piloting the collection 
and analysis of additional measures of legal protection from gender-based violence 
against women, including laws and regulations on domestic violence; child marriage 
(legal age of marriage, exceptions to the minimum age, and remedies); marital rape; 
sexual harassment in employment, education, and public places; cyber harassment; and 
female genital mutilation. 


The State of Women’s Legal Rights
41
To complement this new research and understand how such laws are applied in 
practice, Women, Business and the Law will examine process frameworks to support the 
implementation of these laws, including the provision of services to women survivors of 
violence, access to justice, national plans, budgetary commitments, and monitoring and 
evaluation mechanisms. Both process and outcome questions will undergo consultations 
with experts on matters of violence against women, and data will subsequently be 
collected through questionnaires administered to local experts on gender equality and 
violence against women. Women, Business and the Law 2024 will present the findings 
of this pilot exercise, which will inform the design of a new and more comprehensive 
Safety indicator to be added to the index in 2025. The goal of this research is to provide 
holistic data and analysis that can better inform the design of effective laws and policies 
addressing gender-based violence against women.
The rights of women with disabilities
One in five women worldwide has a disability and faces not only the same gender 
gaps but also barriers to her socioeconomic participation, compared with nondisabled 
women (World Bank and WHO 2011). As a result, women with disabilities are three 
times more likely to have unmet health care needs and to be illiterate and two times less 
likely to be employed and to use the internet than men without disabilities (UNDESA 
2018). Women with disabilities also experience gender-based violence and harassment 
at a greater rate than nondisabled women (World Bank 2019a). For example, a recent 
study found that women with disabilities across the Global South are nearly twice as 
likely to have encountered intimate partner violence in the past year than women 
without disabilities (Chirwa et al. 2020). 
As part of the World Bank Group’s 10 Commitments on Disability-Inclusive 
Development, Women, Business and the Law has produced data and analysis on legal 
protections for women with disabilities in 190 economies to understand how laws can 
protect them from intersectional and multiple discrimination. The first policy brief finds 
that only one-quarter of economies worldwide explicitly recognize the rights of women 
with disabilities in their legislation (Braunmiller and Dry 2022a). This finding confirms 
that laws and policies have neglected the specific needs of women with disabilities 
by focusing predominantly on gender or disability issues (CRPD Committee 2016). 
A second brief explores the specific rights of women with disabilities as related to family 
life, work, and protection from gender-based violence, highlighting some promising 
practices that can inform policy making and legal reforms across the globe (Braunmiller 
and Dry 2022b). 
Gender dimensions of the business climate
Women, Business and the Law will collaborate closely with the World Bank’s Business 
Enabling Environment (BEE) and Enterprise Survey (ES) projects to identify relevant 
gender dimensions of the business climate that are not captured by the Women, 
Business and the Law indicators. Examples of such dimensions include regulations 
on collecting anonymized gender-disaggregated data, firms’ practices on gender-
based discrimination, women’s participation in the judiciary, gender barriers in access 
to finance, and gender equality facilitation programs. These gender areas fall under 


WOMEN, BUSINESS AND THE LAW 2023
42
regulatory frameworks, public services, and efficiency of the business environment and 
fit well into the de jure and de facto gender measures of Women, Business and the Law 
(World Bank 2022b). The BEE and ES gender data are envisioned to complement the 
information collected by Women, Business and the Law.
The way forward
Other potential areas will also be explored as part of the team’s research agenda. For 
example, research suggests that tax policies can alleviate gender inequalities but also 
exacerbate inequalities (Grown and Valodia 2010; Lahey 2018; Stotsky 1997, among 
others). While this area is receiving renewed attention (Coelho et al. 2022; OECD 2022), 
a global stocktaking and analysis of the interaction between tax policies and gender 
equality are missing. In collaboration with other units in the World Bank Group, the 
Women, Business and the Law team plans to address this knowledge gap by piloting an 
assessment of the gender dimensions of tax policies across the globe.
Moving forward, Women, Business and the Law will consider expanding or changing 
the scope of indicators where data variance across countries is limited. For example, in 
only two countries a woman cannot sign a contract in the same way as a man, and in 
only five economies a woman faces limitations on her capacity to register a business. 
Thus, where good-practice legislation has been adopted across almost all economies, 
Women, Business and the Law will assess whether other barriers remain in that topic 
area in order to reflect the current state of legal gender equality more accurately.

Introduction
It is widely acknowledged that women’s rights have expanded in recent decades. 
However, data verifying this improvement and exploring the path toward legal gender 
equality are generally limited by geography or time. The case of Belgium offers an 
interesting example. Belgium was the first economy to score 100 in the Women, 
Business and the Law index by passing an amendment to its law eliminating restrictions 
on women’s employment in mining, which came into effect on May 10, 2010. Yet 
among the economies that today score 100, Belgium had one of the lowest scores in 
1970. The Women, Business and the Law panel data set reveals Belgium’s remarkable 
path to reach legal gender equality: reform stalled for a period of about 20 years, 
gained momentum at the end of the 1990s, and then progressed steadily for more 
than 10 years. The enactment of Law No. 3 of 1995 containing measures to promote 
women’s employment and entrepreneurship, further amendments to the labor code in 
1997, a royal decree introducing parental leave in 1999, and the adoption of measures to 
protect women from violence in 2003 all led to significant progress for gender equality, 
culminating with the adoption of a comprehensive Gender Act in 2007.
The legal implications of the women’s rights movements of the 1960s and 1970s 
in the United States are well documented (for example, see Hazan, Weiss, and Zoabi 
2021; Tertilt et al. 2022). However, there is minimal understanding of how, over time, 
laws have constrained women from obtaining equal rights and opportunities at the 
global level. The Women, Business and the Law 2023 panel data thus fill an important 
gap in the available gender data. This chapter presents panel data for 190 economies 
for 53 years (1970–2022) and for 35 questions scored across the eight indicators 
in the Women, Business and the Law index. They are the first publicly available, 
comprehensive data that record women’s legal rights across time and space for a large

number of economies.1 While the data set has been publicly available on the Women, 
Business and the Law website and has already been used by some researchers (see, 
for example, box 2.1), this report is the first to analyze the panel data comprehensively 
and to describe data trends from five decades of reform.
To construct the panel data set, Women, Business and the Law undertook meticulous 
data collection efforts to extend the data points back to 1970. This thorough historical 
analysis, which looked backward to seek and record each change in the law with regard 
to the 35 questions scored, reveals the course of moving toward legal gender equality 
from 1970 to 2022. Sources of historical laws included national libraries and archives, 
online repositories of laws across the world, and physical legal documents at the United 
States Library of Congress. This historical exercise also considered how the ability and 
freedom of economies to enact their own laws have changed over time. For example, 
economies that gained independence over the course of the historical panel were 
assigned the score of the economy of which they were part before their independence. 
For federal unions such as the former Yugoslavia and Soviet Union, unless there was 
a law at the national level of the constituent republics before independence (and 
there are several instances in which this was the case), the federal law was applied. 
For example, some economies of the former Soviet Union introduced their own labor 
codes, including Azerbaijan in 1971, Belarus in 1972, and Moldova in 1973. In these 
instances, the national labor codes are considered. A similar rationale was applied 
to formerly colonized economies, where national laws that generally applied during 
colonization were used as the legal basis. For the occasional instances in which missed 
historical reforms were brought to light, Women, Business and the Law revised the 
panel data to reflect the new information.
Now updated, the Women, Business and the Law panel data aim to empower rights 
holders, women’s rights advocates, policy makers, and researchers alike to understand 
the geographic and temporal dimensions of the legal rights and barriers that women 
face.2 Because the data set is broad in coverage, it facilitates analysis of when and 
where economies began removing legal gender barriers or advancing women’s rights. 
More important, the data set enables users to track economies’ progress (or regress) 
over time and outlines clearly where restrictions on women’s rights and autonomy 
remain entrenched. For example, the panel data reveal that today women have just over 
three-quarters of the legal rights of men—in 1970, they had less than half. Although 
tangible progress has been made over the last decades, there is still a long way to go to 
reach gender parity in the law. In key areas of legal rights, women have been, and still 
are, worse off than men in the majority of economies around the world.
Users of the Women, Business and the Law panel data can draw lessons from the 
past to guide future decisions and identify priority areas for reform. Analysis of progress 
over time will also reveal important insights for overcoming bottlenecks in legal change, 
unlocking reform potential, and allowing researchers to improve their understanding of 
the conditions necessary for countries to reform. Such research can shed light on why 
certain rights were introduced at a given point in time and why women are still lacking 
rights in other areas.
Although removing barriers to gender equality in the law does not necessarily 
translate into proper implementation, especially in economies where social norms 
may disadvantage women or where state capacity to enforce the laws is limited, panel 
data like those presented by Women, Business and the Law are a crucial first step

BOX 2.1	 RECENT EVIDENCE LINKING WOMEN, BUSINESS AND THE LAW DATA TO BENEFICIAL 
SOCIOECONOMIC OUTCOMES
Since publication of the Women, Business and the Law panel data, researchers have increasingly used the data set to high-
light the link between legal equality and women’s economic outcomes. Some very recent additions to the literature include 
Sever (2022a), which finds that increasing legal gender equality boosts women’s participation in the workforce and does not 
result in fewer men working. Lo Bue et al. (2022) highlight the overrepresentation of women among vulnerable workers and 
the correlation between legal discrimination against women and this particular gender gap. 
Evidence is also growing that family leave policies, which are captured under the Parenthood indicator (figure B2.1.1, panel a), 
are correlated with women’s empowerment. For example, Amin and Islam (2022) find a significant positive association 
between the legislated number of maternity leave days and female employment at the firm level. Furthermore, using 
evidence from Women, Business and the Law, Hyland and Shen (2022) show that closing the gap between the number 
of leave days allocated to mothers and to fathers is associated with a higher female labor force participation rate. Despite 
the growing evidence, assertations of causality are difficult to make given the potential for the female labor supply to 
influence government policies on parental leave. Furthermore, other factors, such as those related to the labor market 
and economic conditions more broadly, may affect both labor supply and leave policies, which the control variables do not 
perfectly capture.
toward identifying key challenges and opportunities to accelerate progress. Laws 
codify and legitimize the status of women and girls within society, and they generally 
reflect societal attitudes toward women. As such, not only does the removal of legal 
barriers enhance women’s rights per se, but also reforming gender-unequal laws has 
an important signaling and symbolic function as well as consequences for the economy 
and society at-large. A small group of reformers may spearhead legal change, which can 
trigger important societal debate and spark larger reform efforts, particularly if formerly 
taboo areas such as reproductive rights are touched (Macaulay 2002). Because legal 
barriers compound gender inequalities, understanding what works to remove them is 
pivotal for women seeking equal footing with men.
What are the benefits of legal gender reform?
Despite much progress, women today have only slightly over three-quarters of the 
economic rights of men as measured by Women, Business and the Law. Hence, many 
economies continue to uphold laws that restrict women’s ability to hold property, 
become entrepreneurs, or make autonomous decisions in the public or private sphere. 
Working to close that gap is a key priority, as women’s rights are beneficial not only 
for women themselves but also for societies at large. Overcoming persistent inequality 
is associated with better socioeconomic outcomes for women in a variety of areas 
such as human development, employment, and health (for a summary, see Roy 2019 
and box 2.1).
Substantial research suggests many channels through which the benefits of legal 
equality extend beyond women themselves and spread to the broader economy. 
Removing legal constraints for women has been shown to be associated with various 
metrics of women’s economic empowerment and socioeconomic development, including 
better labor market outcomes (Gonzales et al. 2015; Hyland, Djankov, and Goldberg 
2020; Hyland and Islam 2021), better access to finance (Demirgüç-Kunt, Klapper, and 
(Box continues next page)


WOMEN, BUSINESS AND THE LAW 2023
60
Recent research also emphasizes the role of gender equality in boosting financial inclusion (Bertrand and Perrin 2022; Perrin 
and Hyland 2023). For example, Bertrand and Perrin (2022) find that legislation protecting women from discrimination in 
accessing credit is associated with a greater likelihood that a female entrepreneur will ask for credit when she needs it. 
However, the research finds no link between legal protections and the success rate of loan applications, highlighting the 
limitations of legal protections and the need for supporting policies to ensure implementation in practice. Perrin and Hyland 
(2023) find a positive association between legal gender equality and women’s financial inclusion, which is summarized in 
figure B2.1.1, panel b. Claims to causality are also difficult to make in this instance, as women’s financial inclusion may be 
influenced by developments in the macroeconomy and employment conditions, as well as by norms and values, which may 
be imperfectly captured by the control variables available.
Evidence that gender equality is important not just for women’s economic empowerment but also for macroeconomic 
development is building as well. Sever (2022b) demonstrates how discriminatory laws constrain progress toward bridging 
cross-country differences in income, yielding tangible economic losses. Hence, removing legal barriers for women can help 
poorer economies to catch up with the living standards in richer economies (Sever 2022b). Similarly, other research has 
shown that legal inequalities prevent women from reaching their full economic potential, hampering economies’ growth 
prospects (Christopherson et al. 2022). While such studies highlight the benefits of economic rights for economic develop-
ment, the causality likely runs in both directions. Indeed, Tertilt et al. (2022) show that economic development is an important 
predictor of women’s rights.

Singer 2013; Perrin and Hyland 2023), greater land and property ownership (Agarwal 
2003; Deininger et al. 2021; Hallward-Driemeier, Hasan, and Rusu 2013), and better 
health outcomes (Anderson 2018; Harari 2019).
Specifically, removing barriers to women’s ability to act autonomously and 
to work without legal limitations can help them to access better jobs and lead to 
higher workforce participation overall (Amin and Islam 2015; Htun, Jensenius, 
and Nelson-Nuñez 2019). Freedom from gender discriminatory laws can also help 
women to become entrepreneurs and access finance (Islam, Muzi, and Amin 2019). 
Furthermore, overcoming legal gender barriers can have positive implications for 
women’s educational attainment (Branisa, Klasen, and Ziegler 2013; Deininger, Goyal, 
and Nagarajan 2013) and could potentially even lead to more investment in human 
capital (Deininger et al. 2019). 
This growing body of evidence highlights the need to continue working to level 
the legal playing field between women and men. While gender equality matters as a 
development objective in its own right, it also serves as a means to ensure sustainable, 
long-run growth.
What motivates legal gender reform?
Although the knowledge base on gender-equal laws and their association with 
socioeconomic outcomes is steadily growing, there is limited systematic evidence 
explaining why economies decide to remove legal barriers for women in the first place. 
Insights into the motivations to eliminate discrimination are largely drawn from country-
specific examples (see Braunmiller and Dry 2022; Geddes and Lueck 2002; Githae et al.  
2022). Comparative evidence across economies is growing slowly. Data limitations may 
be one reason for limited comparative research on the drivers of legal gender reform. 
The Women, Business and the Law panel data can help to overcome this limitation. 
Removing structural barriers that constrain women’s participation in all spheres of 
public life requires an enabling environment and political will. A common driver for the 
expansion of women’s rights is a country’s political system. Democratic states are more 
often associated with an accelerated women’s rights movement; they can facilitate 
reform and the expansion of women’s rights, such as the right to vote (Lizzeri and 
Persico 2004). The extent to which various groups participate in the decision-making 
institutions of a democratic economy also matters. The absence of women from political 
life, for example, could lead to bias. In fact, greater female representation in a legislature 
seems to be an enabler for economies to pass more gender-sensitive laws, particularly 
in areas such as sexual harassment, rape, divorce, and domestic violence (Asiedu et al. 
2018). Similarly, female leaders can have a significant effect on societies. They seem to 
do a better job of representing the needs of women (for an overview, see Duflo 2012). 
Indeed, research shows that female leadership is associated with enhanced gender 
equality in the legal system, an association that is stronger when women hold office 
for a longer period (Jung 2022). Also, a civil society that is actively challenging societal 
order or mobilizing societal action could create the momentum needed for governments 
to take action on discriminatory laws (Weldon 2002).
A look at the sequence in which economies have granted women rights offers 
insights into the factors underlying the decisions to expand those rights. For example, 
Doepke, Tertilt, and Voena (2012) find that different countries have followed distinct 


WOMEN, BUSINESS AND THE LAW 2023
62
paths. Women in the United Kingdom and United States first gained basic economic 
rights, followed by political rights. Equal treatment in the labor market and greater 
control over their own bodies ultimately followed. By contrast, women in many African 
economies gained formal political rights as part of the end of colonialism and only later 
obtained economic rights (Doepke, Tertilt, and Voena 2012). 
Education and higher human capital are also important enablers for increased 
gender equality in the law. Greater recognition of the importance of education can 
alter men’s (and women’s) preferences regarding women’s rights. According to Doepke 
and Tertilt (2009), the expansion of married women’s economic rights in the United 
Kingdom and United States throughout the nineteenth century can be attributed to 
technological change that increased the importance of human capital in the economy. 
Eastin and Prakash (2013) and Tertilt et  al. (2022) also highlight the importance of 
economic development as a predictor of legal equality. Still, most of what is currently 
known about reform efforts stems from a limited set of economies (box 2.2). 
BOX 2.2	 DRIVERS, BARRIERS, AND MECHANISMS OF REFORMS: LESSONS FROM CASE STUDIES 
Understanding the process underlying the enactment of legislative reforms to advance the rights of women is useful for 
economies interested in closing the legal gender gap. To this end, in 2022 Women, Business and the Law published seven 
case studies examining successful legal reforms aimed at gender equality in the Democratic Republic of Congo (Braunmiller 
and Dry 2022), Ethiopia (Alemayehu et al., forthcoming), India (Braunmiller et al., forthcoming), Kenya (Githae et al. 2022), 
São Tomé and Príncipe (Mazoni and Corminales 2022), South Africa (Arekapudi and Mazoni 2022), and Togo (Affoum and Dry 
2022). And the World Bank’s Global Business Regulation published a case study on reforms toward gender equality recently 
implemented in the United Arab Emirates (World Bank 2022). These case studies provide lessons on how to pursue gender 
equality reforms.
The activism of women’s groups, for example, has often proved instrumental in the reform process. Gender champions across 
local civil society groups and sustained political will and momentum for the women’s rights movement have been an active 
force behind historic reforms, including the gradual eradication of marital power in South Africa, with the Matrimonial Property 
Act in 1984, its amendment in 1988, and the General Law Fourth Amendment in 1993, and in the Democratic Republic of 
Congo, with the adoption of the Congolese Law on Parity and amendments to the civil code in 2015–16. Reforms in both the 
Democratic Republic of Congo and South Africa removed significant restrictions, allowing women to sign contracts, start jobs, 
and register businesses without their husbands’ authorization. In India, a thriving civil society also contributed to identifying 
gaps, drafting legislation, and organizing public opinion through campaigns, discussions, and protests, leading to enactment 
of the 2005 Domestic Violence Act. 
Strategic multistakeholder coalitions bringing together government, civil society organizations, and the international com-
munity have also successfully pursued important reforms. In São Tomé and Príncipe, decades of advocacy led by trailblazing 
women activists, support from gender champions at the highest levels of government, and legislative drafting assistance 
from international counterparts pushed the issue of pervasive domestic violence to the top of the economy’s legislative 
agenda, leading to the enactment of the 2008 Maria das Neves Law. In Togo, a multistakeholder effort by local civil society 
organizations, the government, and international organizations played a key role in reforming the Persons and Family Code in 
2012 and 2014, allowing women to choose where to live and work, and to head a household with no restrictions. In Ethiopia, 
tripartite negotiations among the Confederation of Trade Unions, Employers’ Association, and the government led to labor 
reforms in 2019, which lengthened paid maternity leave and introduced paid paternity leave.
Research and data highlighting inequalities and the cost of inaction have additionally served as compelling support for reform. 
In Kenya, research on the poor working conditions of women, including unfair compensation and sexual harassment, guided 
the development of historic labor reforms in 2007 that granted equal rights and protections for women. Similarly, advocates 
used data on the pervasiveness and economic costs of gender-based violence during the parliamentary deliberations leading

Information on the drivers of legal reform across a more diverse set of economies has 
been largely absent. However, this void was recently filled by Tertilt et al. (2022), who 
undertake a comparative assessment of how gender discriminatory laws are reformed. 
The authors use the Women, Business and the Law panel data set and supplement it 
with information on political rights (such as suffrage and the right to stand for election) 
and body rights (such as the right to an abortion and access to contraception) to 
build a data set covering four areas—economic rights, political rights, labor rights, and 
rights over one’s own body. They develop a political economy model outlining four 
important economic channels through which reform can happen: (1) the bargaining 
power channel (rights can affect how resources are shared within households); (2) 
the parental altruism channel (women’s rights can affect men through the impacts on 
their daughters and increased investment in children); (3) the income channel (more 
rights for women can increase household resources); and (4) the public policy channel 
(including women in policy making can affect policy formation). The authors find that, 
overall, women’s rights are strongly associated with economic development. Of these 
channels, their results suggest that the income channel is an important driver of the 
expansion of women’s rights, particularly economic and labor rights. Tertilt et al. (2022) 
also find that parental altruism is an important channel through which women’s rights 
increase over time.
to the adoption of the Protection against Domestic Violence Act in 2015. In the Democratic Republic of Congo, advocates 
leveraged the economic case for gender equality, linking legal constraints to practical barriers for entrepreneurs, to convince 
skeptics that legal reform was an economic necessity. In Togo, activists used compelling sociological data to demonstrate 
that the discriminatory family law no longer reflected the reality of Togolese society. In the United Arab Emirates, Women, 
Business and the Law data have been instrumental in identifying gaps in existing legislation and informing a package of 
comprehensive reforms toward gender equality. These reforms included the 2020 amendments of the Personal Status Law, 
affecting women’s freedom of movement and removing the duty of obedience, and the Federal Labor Law, mandating equal 
remuneration for work of equal value. 
International commitments under the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination against Women and 
technical assistance from international partners, including the African Development Bank, International Labour Organization, 
and World Bank, played an important role in bringing about these reforms.
The path toward legal reform has not always been linear or smooth, though. In some cases, the enactment of legislation 
was stalled for years—sometimes decades—and was the result of intense debates and negotiations. For instance, in Togo, 
civil society started denouncing the inequalities contained in the Persons and Family Code in the late 1980s. However, 
following violent incidents in response to protests advocating democracy and political pluralism from 1990 to 1993, the 
ties between Togo and the international community were cut for 15 years. As a result, the process of reform was stalled 
for almost two decades. When dialogue and diplomacy slowly resumed in 2008, so did the reform movement, with the 
historic reforms of the Persons and Family Code in 2012 and 2014. Similarly, India’s journey of social and legal reforms 
to address domestic violence followed a unique path spanning nearly five decades of debates, starting from addressing 
dowry-related violence, then recognizing additional offenses in the criminal law, and finally enacting the Protection of 
Women from Domestic Violence Act in 2005, which for the first time accorded protective rights and welfare measures to 
survivors. Likewise, the Kenya Protection against Domestic Violence Bill of 2015 was the culmination of more than 20 years 
of research, advocacy, and lobbying by Kenyan civil society organizations as well as a significant achievement for Kenyan 
parliamentarians.
Together, these lessons can provide important insights for policy makers, advocates, and international organizations pursuing 
legal gender equality.

Although many factors beyond legal reform benefit women’s economic empowerment 
and broader development outcomes, legal reforms are actionable and, in contrast 
to changing norms and attitudes, achievable in the short run (Hyland, Djankov, and 
Goldberg 2020). However, how to achieve legal reform and what enabling factors need 
to be in place for laws to be implemented successfully have received limited attention. 
Shedding more light on what factors are successful in driving reforms can guide future 
policy and accelerate movement down the path toward legal gender equality.
Unpacking reform efforts: Main takeaways
For decades, economies have reformed existing laws or introduced new legislation to 
provide women with more legal rights. This section presents five main takeaways from 
the Women, Business and the Law panel data that describe patterns of reform, including 
how, where, and how fast laws have changed since 1970. In doing so, it highlights the 
remarkable catch-up effect that some economies have exhibited, while also stressing 
that more work lies ahead to reach gender parity in the law. 
Takeaway 1. In the last five decades, the global average of the 
Women, Business and the Law score has improved by about two-
thirds as a result of more than 2,000 reforms expanding women’s 
legal rights.
Over the course of 53 years (1970–2022) and in the 35 areas measured, economies 
have introduced a staggering 2,151 reforms, improving the average Women, 
Business and the Law score from 45.8 in 1970 to 77.1 today.3 However, another 1,549 
reforms will be needed to reach legal gender equality everywhere. 
Counting the positive changes in the law—reforms—that have occurred since 
1970, the data show that those reforms have not been distributed equally across 
the decades. The 1970s and the 1980s saw a similar rate of change, with 279 and 
259  reforms, respectively. The year 1990 kick-started two decades of increased 
reform. In the 1990s, 433 reforms were introduced, followed by the introduction of 
a striking 611 reforms in the 2000s. Since then, the progress of reform has slowed: 
only 447 reforms were implemented from 2010 to 2019 (figure 2.1), with a spike of 
63 reforms in 2019—one of the highest number of reforms overall per year. Since 2020, 
economies have enacted 122 reforms. The annual rate of reform has fallen since, and 
2022 saw the smallest number of reforms since 2001. While some natural slowdown 
of reforms can be expected as economies progress to more gender-equal laws, this 
slowdown could become a concern if competing priorities are taking attention away 
from legislative reforms to achieve gender equality.
In the 1970s, many economies addressed the lower-hanging fruit and updated legal 
provisions that once limited the basic agency and freedom of movement of women and 
girls. For example, in 1970 Ecuador updated its 1857 civil code, removing restrictions 
for married women. The new civil code enabled a married woman to sign a legally 
binding contract, register a business, go to work, administer property, and open a bank 
account without the consent of her husband. Similarly, Ghana and Kenya enacted new 
laws in the 1970s allowing women to choose where to live.

More important, these decades were also marked by the introduction of novel 
legislation in the areas of Parenthood and Pension. In the 1970s, 25 economies expanded 
legislation by making it illegal for employers to dismiss pregnant workers. Among the 
regions, Europe and Central Asia as well as the Organization for Economic Co-operation 
and Development (OECD) high-income economies were the first to adopt legislation 
prohibiting the dismissal of pregnant workers. Other regions soon followed suit. In Sub-
Saharan Africa, Somalia was the first economy to issue legislation protecting women 
from dismissal by an employer during pregnancy.4 In Latin America and the Caribbean, 
14 economies already had such legislation in place. In 1974, Argentina, hitherto lacking 
such legislation, was the first to institute a reform.5

Similarly, in the 1970s, 20 economies promoted reforms either to introduce old-
age pension systems for the first time or to update existing ones, allowing women and 
men to retire equally with full benefits. These reforms also affected women’s ability 
to retire with partial pension benefits. In six economies, the new or amended laws set 
equal ages at which women and men can retire with partial pension benefits, whereas 
in 14 economies, the legislation did not establish the possibility for retirement with 
partial benefits. Reform efforts in this area began in Latin America and the Caribbean 
and in Sub-Saharan Africa; soon after, other regions followed suit. In 1972, Samoa 
introduced the National Provident Fund Act 1972 and became the first economy in 
the East Asia and Pacific region to reform in this area. In 1974, Tunisia became the 
first economy in the Middle East and North Africa region to introduce an old-age 
pension system that set equal ages for women and men to retire with full pension 
benefits.
The introduction of new laws in the 1970s and 1980s quickened the pace 
of reform in the 1990s and 2000s, albeit in different areas. In the 1990s, many 
economies introduced pioneering new legislation in areas such as nondiscrimination 
in employment and protection of women from sexual harassment in the workplace. 
Since the turn of the century, economies have substantially increased their efforts to 
reform their laws to reach legal gender parity in all aspects of a woman’s working life. 
Between 2000 and 2009, more than 600 reforms were introduced, with a peak of 73 
reforms in 2002 and 2008. 
However, since that peak, the removal of legal barriers has slowed. While reform 
efforts may naturally slow down as economies become more gender equal in their 
laws, several economies have not moved in years. For instance, six economies have 
implemented several reforms in the past and have, therefore, surpassed the global 
average score in the Women, Business and the Law index, but they have not implemented 
any reforms for the last 15 years in the areas measured. These six economies are The 
Bahamas, Guyana, Romania, St. Lucia, Tanzania, and Zimbabwe. Tanzania undertook 
an impressive reform effort in the 2000s, but since 2006 has had a stagnant score 
of 81.3, with room for improvement in all areas except Mobility, Workplace, and Pay. 
A similar pattern is observable for Guyana. Guyana significantly reformed before the 
turn of the century, with an increase in score from 66.3 to 86.9. Then, the economy’s 
reform efforts came to a halt, with room for improvement in Mobility, Marriage, and 
Parenthood. Romania stands out because its reform efforts took off only around the 
turn of the century, improving from a score of 65 in 2000 to 90.6 in 2008—a steep 
increase in a short period of time. Since then, however, Romania has not implemented 
any reforms and still has a comparably low score in the area of Pension. More research 
is needed to understand why. 
In 2022, only 34 reforms were recorded, a historic low since 2001. This low level 
of reform, however, does not imply that reforming gender-unequal laws has been 
pushed off the agenda in all economies. Several key reform bills are currently stalled in 
parliamentary deadlock. For example, a marriage bill in Bhutan has been pending since 
2016. Burundi has been working on a new inheritance law since 2004. Nigeria introduced 
a gender and equal opportunity bill to the Senate in March 2016 and then again in 2019, 
but it has suffered several setbacks in the legislative chambers. Economies are still 
pushing for more gender-equal laws, but many underlying reasons, including patriarchal 
cultural norms, opposition from religious groups, and political instability, are hampering 
their legislative efforts.

Yet there is also cause for optimism. In 2022, after years of delay, Uganda passed 
the long-awaited Succession (Amendment) Act, addressing the inequality and 
marginalization of women and girls after the death of a spouse by equalizing inheritance 
rights between both genders. The act also allows married women to choose where to 
live without having to acquire the domicile of their husbands. Furthermore, Sierra Leone 
passed the Gender Empowerment Act in November 2022 after several setbacks. The 
president signed the bill into law in January 2023. While passed after the cut-off date 
for this year’s report, the new legislation manifests Sierra Leone’s commitment to legal 
reform. In September 2022, Sierra Leone also passed the Customary Land Rights Act, 
boosting the rights of rural landowners and women. Despite some recent examples of 
how political will and momentum can lead to tangible progress, there is still a long way 
to go to reach gender parity in the law for all women everywhere. 
Takeaway 2. Only 14 economies have achieved legal gender 
parity in 2022, as measured by Women, Business and the Law, 
and progress has been uneven across regions and over time.
Despite the significant increase in the average Women, Business and the Law score 
over time, to date only 14 economies—all OECD high income—score 100. Thus 176 
economies still have room to improve, and at the recent pace of reform they will need 
at least another 50 years to reach 100. This means that a young woman entering the 
workforce today will retire before she is able to enjoy gender-equal rights during her 
working life. 
A score of 100 represents equal rights and opportunities for men and women in 
all 35 areas of measurement. This score can be interpreted as the absence of legal 
inequality for a woman throughout her working life in the areas covered by the index. 
While other rights are certainly important, these 35 areas represent the minimum set of 
rights that must be in place for a woman to have economic opportunities equal to those 
of a man throughout her adult working life. Ongoing developments by the Women, 
Business and the Law project to add new indicators and data points as well as to assess 
implementation of the law in practice will provide a more comprehensive measure of 
legal equality.
By enacting an amendment in May 2010 that removed restrictions on women’s 
employment in mining, Belgium was the first economy to reach gender parity in the 
law. For the previous 40 years, since the earliest period covered by Women, Business 
and the Law, none of the economies included in the index had reached legal gender 
parity. There has been plenty of progress, but only within the last decade and only in 
some high-income economies have women made far-reaching progress in gaining legal 
equality as workers, spouses, consumers, or entrepreneurs. While it took until 2010 for 
the first economy to reach full gender equality in the law, by 2022, 44 economies had 
closed most gender gaps in the law, reaching a score of 90 or higher in the Women, 
Business and the Law index. Canada, for example, was the first economy to reach that 
intermediary milestone in 1990 (scoring 95). Yet Canada did not achieve full gender 
parity for almost two more decades. In 2019, Canada eventually earned a score of 100 
by introducing a new law that reserves 35 days of paid parental leave for the father.6 
The 14 economies that have, by now, reached gender parity in the law are Belgium, 
Canada, Denmark, France, Germany, Greece, Iceland, Ireland, Latvia, Luxembourg, the 
Netherlands, Portugal, Spain, and Sweden.


WOMEN, BUSINESS AND THE LAW 2023

Similarly, the lower tier of the index (economies scoring 25 and below) remained 
sticky for a long time. In 1970, 12 economies scored 25 or below in the Women, Business 
and the Law index, indicating that women had only a quarter of the legal rights of men.7 
This number gradually fell to 0, with the Republic of Yemen being the last economy to 
exit the lowest tier of the index. In 2008, the Republic of Yemen amended its labor code, 
equalizing women and men before the law in terms of mandatory retirement, rising to 
a score of 26.9 in the Women, Business and the Law index, the same score as today.8 
Even though some economies began the reform process only within the last two 
decades, Women, Business and the Law panel data show that reforming the law is, 
in fact, a global phenomenon. Worldwide, every economy has implemented at least 
one reform since 1970, allowing women to inch closer to equal economic opportunity 
under the law. Also, since the 2000s, the pace of reform has accelerated in regions 
that were rather slow to reform in the previous decades, such as South Asia (out of a 
total of 66 reforms, 54 were implemented since 2000) or East Asia and Pacific (out of a 
total of 222 reforms, 138 were implemented since 2000). Overall, 1,180 reforms have 
been implemented since the turn of the century. Thus, since 2000, economies have 
implemented, on average, 51 reforms a year, compared to 33 reforms a year before 
2000. Although this finding is encouraging, it is not enough. Reform efforts toward 
gender parity need to be accelerated and prioritized. 
Meanwhile, despite the progress made, gender disparities persist at the regional 
and income levels. Today, equality of economic opportunity across genders is highest in 
OECD high-income economies, where the average score in the Women, Business and 
the Law index is 95.3 points, and lowest in the Middle East and North Africa region, 
where the average score is 53.2 points.
OECD high-income economies have reached today’s score through continual reform 
efforts over decades. In 1970, women in these economies faced multiple legal barriers, 
reflected by a rather low average score of 55.2. This score is comparable to the average 
score of the Middle East and North Africa region today (53.2). By implementing 490 
reforms over the last 52 years, OECD high-income economies have been able to advance 
in the Women, Business and the Law index by about 40 points. Spain is the region’s 
top-reforming economy, implementing 23 reforms between 1970 and 2022, followed 
by Austria, Luxembourg, and Portugal, each with 21 reforms. Among the OECD high-
income economies, Japan implemented the fewest reforms (6), and scores lowest in the 
OECD high-income cohort as of 2022 (78.75).
There are also regional differences in the timing of reform efforts (figure 2.2). Many 
economies in Latin America and the Caribbean, likely influenced by early movements 
toward reform in Europe (Htun and Weldon 2011), began their reform process in the 
1970s, reaching their peak in the 1990s, when the region enacted 107 reforms. In 1981, 
Suriname alone instituted 10 reforms. By contrast, most other regions reached their 
reform peak in the 2000s: Sub-Saharan Africa, with 169 reforms; OECD high-income 
economies, with 143 reforms; and Europe and Central Asia, with 109 reforms. 
The significant spike in reforms among Sub-Saharan African economies in the 
2000s may also be linked to the adoption of the Protocol to the African Charter on 
Human and Peoples’ Rights on the Rights of Women in Africa (Maputo Protocol) 
by the African  Union in 2003. The protocol, which entered into force in 2005 and 
has been ratified by 42 of the 55 member states of the African Union, guarantees 
expansive rights to African women and girls and includes 30 of the 35 areas measured

by Women, Business and the Law. During the 2000s, the Women, Business and the 
Law score increased in 17 economies in Sub-Saharan Africa due to the introduction of 
legislation on sexual harassment in employment. For some of them, the Maputo Protocol 
was a key driver.9 Benin, for example, enacted the Law to Repress Sexual Harassment 
and Protect Victims, which defines sexual harassment and criminalizes such conduct in 
the context of employment. Namibia incorporated the prohibition of discrimination and 
sexual harassment in employment in its Labor Act of 2007, which entitles employees 
to civil remedies after their unfair dismissal as a result of sexual harassment. Similarly, 
Rwanda’s Law on Prevention and Punishment of Gender-Based Violence establishes 
imprisonment and fines for any person guilty of sexual harassment in the workplace. 
Victims affected by this type of violence have the right to claim damages.
Since the early 2000s, South Asia’s reforms have also taken off, with Nepal standing 
out by granting spouses equal rights to immovable property in 2002, allowing women 
to be head of household in 2008, enacting legislation to protect women from domestic 
violence in 2009 and from sexual harassment in employment in 2015, and enacting 
several amendments and laws that enhanced women’s legal rights related to inheritance, 
divorce, and employment in 2018.10 
In Europe and Central Asia, most reforms were undertaken in the 2000s across all 
economies (109 reforms). In the aftermath of the collapse of the Soviet Union, the initial 
focus of the newly independent republics was on the development of stable political and

economic systems along with independent cultural identities separate from the decades 
of Soviet rule. Hence, legislating and enforcing gender equality were not an immediate 
priority for state officials, contributing to the reemergence of stereotypes about gender 
roles in the early 1990s (Wolchik 1995). By the same token, in 1990, Europe and Central 
Asia had a comparatively higher score (60.2) in the Women, Business and the Law index 
than other regions (East Asia and Pacific, 53.2; Sub-Saharan Africa 46.3; South Asia, 
43.7; Middle East and North Africa, 32.7). This relatively high score could be attributed 
to the fact that the Soviet Union was known to have solid policies that allowed women 
to balance their roles as mothers and labor force participants. For example, a strong 
social welfare net consisting of state-sponsored childcare, food subsidies, communal 
dining halls, and health care was established to allow women to participate in the labor 
force and education system (Goldman 1993; Lapidus 1978). 
The Middle East and North Africa’s reform efforts took off only in the 2010s. In 
the last 13 years (2010–22), the region implemented more reforms (100) than in the 
previous four decades combined (81 reforms from 1970 to 2009). In the first three 
decades covered by the Women, Business and the Law panel data, reform efforts 
in the Middle East and North Africa region were concentrated mainly in the areas of 
Parenthood and Pension. Despite a current score of 43 on the Assets indicator, by far 
the lowest across all regions, only one economy in the Middle East and North Africa has 
undertaken reform efforts since 1970. In 1993, Malta enacted a law granting spouses 
equal authority to administer assets during marriage and equal rights to immovable 
property.11 These fundamental rights are codified in civil codes, personal status laws, 
or family codes and expressed in judicial decisions. Expanding women’s rights in these 
areas might be slower and politically more contentious in regions where reform efforts 
are often framed as a matter of national, religious, or cultural identity (Shachar 2001). 
Economies might claim that family law reform touches on the status of religion, culture, 
or kinship and may resist reform efforts to maintain the status quo in these areas (Htun 
and Weldon 2015; Kang 2015; Moustafa 2013).
Within regions, some economies have made much more progress than others. 
Altogether, the regions’ top-reforming economies are, in OECD high income, Spain 
(23 reforms); in the Middle East and North Africa region, Malta and the United Arab 
Emirates (22 reforms each); in Sub-Saharan Africa, São Tomé and Príncipe and South 
Africa (22 reforms each); in East Asia and Pacific, the Lao People’s Democratic Republic 
(21 reforms); in Latin America and the Caribbean, Bolivia and Brazil (20 reforms each); in 
South Asia, Nepal (16 reforms); and in Europe and Central Asia, Georgia and Türkiye (13 
reforms each). All of these economies are well ahead of their regional peers. On average, 
economies in these regions reformed as follows: OECD high income (14 reforms), Middle 
East and North Africa (9 reforms), East Asia and Pacific (9 reforms), Latin America and the 
Caribbean (12 reforms), South Asia (8 reforms), and Europe and Central Asia (10 reforms). 
Compared with the regional variation, differences in reform efforts have been 
less pronounced across income groups (figure 2.3). Instead, reforming economies’ 
laws to provide better opportunities for women has followed a relatively consistent 
pattern across income groups. High-income economies have implemented a total of 
742 reforms, with economies implementing between 1 (Qatar) and 23 (Spain) reforms. 
Upper-middle-income economies12 have implemented 573 reforms, with a spread of 
between 1 (Palau) and 22 (South Africa) reforms. Lower-middle-income economies have 
implemented a total of 559 reforms, with a spread of between 1 (the Federated States 
of Micronesia) and 22 (São Tomé and Príncipe) reforms. Finally, low-income economies

existing law. Each dot represents an economy. The income groups are constituted as follows: 58 high-income economies, 51 upper-middle-income 
economies, 54 lower-middle-income economies, and 27 low-income economies. All income groups are classified as of 2022, except for República 
Bolivariana de Venezuela, which is included in the upper-middle-income group, as last classified in 2021.

have implemented a total of 277 reforms, ranging from 2 (the Republic of Yemen) to 
20 (the Democratic Republic of Congo and Togo) reforms. Reform efforts thus have not 
necessarily been restricted to higher-income economies.
Takeaway 3. Progress across the areas measured has also been 
uneven, with most reforms in Workplace and Parenthood.
Reform efforts across the 35 areas of measurement have differed substantially 
(figure 2.4). Across all indicators, most reforms have affected laws captured under 
Workplace and Parenthood. Under the Workplace indicator, many economies have 
been enacting laws that prohibit discrimination based on gender in employment 
(154 reforms) and address sexual harassment in employment (145 reforms). 
As mentioned in chapter 1, Parenthood is still the indicator with the largest 
room for improvement overall, although economies have made some progress over 
time. For example, in 1989 Denmark was the first economy to reach a score of 
100 on the Parenthood indicator. In the 1990s, 5 economies followed suit: Sweden 
(1991), Hungary (1992), Norway (1993), Belgium (1998), and Iceland (1998). By 
2000, only 6 economies had reached a score of 100 on Parenthood; by the end of 
2022, 35 economies had scored 100 on Parenthood. Overall, across regions OECD 
high-income economies reformed the most in the area of Parenthood across all eight 
areas of measurement (110 reforms).


WOMEN, BUSINESS AND THE LAW 2023

By contrast, the fewest reforms have been issued on the Mobility indicator. This is 
because, in part, Mobility showed the highest level of equality at an aggregate level in 
1970 and thus had the least room to improve among the eight areas of measurement. 
In particular, few reforms have been recorded on the question of whether women can 
travel outside the country (three reforms—one each in the Arab Republic of Egypt, 
Saudi Arabia, and the United Arab Emirates) and whether women can leave the marital 
home (six reforms—one each in Algeria, Italy, San Marino, Saudi Arabia, the Syrian Arab 
Republic, and the United Arab Emirates). 
The gradual expansion of women’s rights is not distributed equally across decades. 
Instead, reform efforts have unfolded in waves with a focus on specific areas. In the 
1970s, economies largely removed gender barriers on mobility, allowing married women 
to choose where to live, and introduced legislation on the dismissal of pregnant workers. 
However, this process has not been consistent across regions. In the Middle East and 
North Africa, for example, reforms in the area of Mobility took off only in the 1990s. In 
the 1970s and 1980s, the region issued no reforms. 
The 1980s, while continuing the reform efforts of the 1970s, was a decade of 
isolated breakthroughs. At the inception of the Women, Business and the Law panel 
data, Eritrea and Ethiopia were the only economies that already had legal provisions 
protecting women from sexual harassment. These provisions were enshrined in the 
penal code of 1957, which applied to both economies, as Eritrea and Ethiopia were 
one country until 1991. During the period covered by Women, Business and the Law 
panel data, the United States was the first economy to enact a reform protecting 
women from sexual harassment in employment, in 1981. The United States also 
enacted civil remedies for sexual harassment in employment. Soon after, Australia 
followed suit, enacting legislation to prohibit sexual harassment in all work-related 
activities.13 Australia also prohibited gender discrimination in employment. In 1982,

Ireland was the first economy globally to introduce a specific law on domestic violence 
against women. Three economies followed Ireland’s lead that decade: Hong Kong 
SAR, China; Singapore; and Sweden.
The 1990s set the stage for a steep increase in women’s legal empowerment, 
with many economies making a foray into women’s economic rights. For example, 
reform efforts were undertaken to mandate equal remuneration for work of equal 
value (19  reforms) and to grant women at least 14 weeks of paid maternity leave 
(10  reforms). Economies also issued 38 reforms introducing domestic violence 
legislation. These reform efforts have continued and, as a result, 162 economies have 
introduced domestic violence legislation, with the latest reforms passed by the Republic 
of Congo and Côte d’Ivoire in 2022. 
The 2000s saw the most improvement across all areas measured, with a remarkable 
spike in reforms under the Workplace indicator. Although earlier reform efforts in 
this area concentrated on removing restrictions on getting a job, efforts in the 2000s 
continued introducing or reforming legislation on the prohibition of gender discrimination 
in employment as well as legislation on sexual harassment. These reform efforts, which 
have been most prevalent in Sub-Saharan Africa, may have been accelerated by the 
adoption of the Maputo Protocol by the African Union in 2003.
On a global level, as displayed in figure 2.5, moving toward gender equality in the 
law seems to follow a specific sequencing. Mobility and Assets—areas often regulated 
in economies’ family law—were mostly reformed in the first two decades covered by 
Women, Business and the Law. About half of all reforms recorded in these two areas were

To avoid suggesting a drop in reforms, the decade of the 2020s is omitted in this figure because only three years of data on reforms are available.

implemented before the end of the 1980s. In contrast, reforms in the areas of Pay and 
Workplace were very limited in the first two decades. The overarching majority of reforms 
in the area of Workplace (86 percent) were implemented in the 1990s and beyond. With 
regard to reforms in the area of Pay, about 71 percent of reforms have been implemented 
only since the turn of the century. Hence, more research is needed to shed light on whether 
reforming family laws is, in fact, a precondition for women’s economic empowerment.
Despite these global trends, it is important to take country-specific or region-
specific paths into account. At the inception of the Women, Business and the Law panel 
data, Czechia and the United Kingdom were the only two economies that already had 
legal provisions mandating equal remuneration for work of equal  value. Somalia 
was then the first economy to introduce reforms mandating equal remuneration for 
work of equal value. Enacting a new labor code in 1972, Somalia prohibited gender 
discrimination in employment and the dismissal of pregnant workers and mandated 
equal remuneration for work of equal value. These reforms were the only ones that 
Somalia ever implemented, raising its Women, Business and the Law score from 32.5 
to 49.9—a score that Somalia still holds today. Further, most other early reform efforts 
in the area of Pay were undertaken by OECD high-income economies (8 out of 12 
in the 1970s). During the period covered by Women, Business and the Law panel 
data, France was the first European economy to introduce equal pay, in December 
1972,14 followed by Ireland, Luxembourg, and the Netherlands. One explanation for the 
region’s relatively early adoption of reforms in the area of Pay could be the European 
Community’s Equal Pay Directive,15 which was adopted in February 1975.
Takeaway 4. Economies with historically larger legal gender gaps 
have been catching up, especially since 2000. 
In 2022, despite global progress on reform, large gaps in legal equality remain between 
the most and the least equal economies. On the one hand, 14 economies have removed 
all legal inequalities in the areas covered by the Women, Business and the Law index. 
On the other hand, 16 economies still accord women fewer than half the rights of men. 
However, analysis of the log annualized growth rate in the Women, Business and the 
Law scores shows that faster progress is generally being made in economies that have 
had historically lower levels of gender equality. This catch-up effect, whereby economies 
that scored lower in 1970 experience a faster rate of reform growth over time, is 
illustrated in figure 2.6. Furthermore, because the Women, Business and the Law index 
is bounded between 0 and 100, economies with greater levels of legal equality have less 
room to improve than those with lower levels. 
Figure 2.6 shows that the two economies with the fastest annual growth rates in the 
index (with growth rates, measured using log annualized rates, in the top percentile of 
the distribution) are São Tomé and Príncipe and the United Arab Emirates. These two 
economies, which have exhibited the highest log annualized growth rates in their score 
over the last 52 years, had among the lowest levels of legal gender equality in 1970 
(scores of 17.5 and 18.75, respectively). While progress in the two economies has been 
similar, on average, there are large differences in the timing of reforms. In São Tomé and 
Príncipe, reform has been a gradual process since 1970, with periods when the pace of 
reform slowed and then, after a time, gathered pace again. In the United Arab Emirates, 
progress has been much more recent, with reforms taking off quickly since 2018. 


Data Trends from Five Decades of Reform
75
Other economies that have experienced the fastest pace of reform—as measured 
by the log annualized growth rate of their Women, Business and the Law scores, which 
does not necessarily equate to the largest absolute change in the scores—are Bahrain, 
Botswana, the Democratic Republic of Congo, Indonesia, Saudi Arabia, South Africa, 
and Togo. In these seven economies, the average Women, Business and the Law score 
in 1970 was 22.8, which is far below the global average of 45.8 for the same year. In 
Botswana and the Democratic Republic of Congo, reform accelerated beginning in the 
2000s, coinciding with the adoption of the Maputo Protocol and the golden decade for 
women’s rights highlighted previously. In South Africa and Togo, reform had been taking 
place somewhat more consistently across the five decades, albeit with notable jumps 
when important legislative changes were made. In Bahrain and Saudi Arabia, as in the 
United Arab Emirates, reform has been a more recent phenomenon.
Indonesia is an interesting example of the path toward legal equality (figure 2.7). 
The first reform in Indonesia captured by the Women, Business and the Law panel 
data occurred in 1975, when articles of the Dutch civil code of 1847 were amended 
by the new Law No. 1 of 1974 on Marriage. Specifically, Article 66 of this law clarified

that, with passage of the law, the articles in the civil code of 1847 pertaining to 
marriage were annulled, thus removing the historical restrictions on a woman’s ability 
to act autonomously without the express permission of her husband. For example, as 
of 1975, married women in Indonesia could choose where to live, get a job, or sign 
a contract without facing restrictions that men did not face. By then, they also had 
greater rights related to ownership and management of assets. In total, seven data 
points across four indicators changed from “no” to “yes” because of this legal reform. 
Another important step toward ensuring a woman’s economic rights occurred in 1977. 
Government Regulation No. 33/1977 on Social Insurance mandated equal retirement 
ages for men and women, contributing to women’s economic security in later years.16 
This reform was followed by a long period from the mid-1970s to the mid-1990s 
during which Indonesia did not make strides toward legal equality. However, a period 
of notable progress followed: Indonesia’s score jumped in 2004 with introduction of 
the 2003 Labor Law (Law No. 13/2003). This legislation prohibited discrimination 
based on gender in employment and removed historical restrictions on the tasks 
on, and industries in, which a woman could work. This reform was soon followed by 
passage of the Domestic Violence Law (Law No. 23/2004). Today, Indonesia continues 
to make important gains toward women’s legal equality. As noted in chapter 1, in 
2022 Indonesia enacted legislation protecting women from sexual harassment in 
employment and strengthening a woman’s right to engage safely in paid work in the 
formal sector. Over the last five decades, Indonesia’s legal landscape has progressed: 
in 1970, women had only 20 percent of the rights afforded to men; in 2022, they have 
just over 70 percent of these rights. 


Data Trends from Five Decades of Reform
77
Despite Indonesia’s positive trajectory, recent developments represent important 
setbacks on the path toward gender equality. Media have reported that, in October of 
2022, a case of sexual assault occurred in the Ministry of Cooperatives and Small and 
Medium Enterprises and that attempts were made to settle the case by marrying the 
victim to the perpetrator (Bhwana 2022b). This took place in the same year that Indonesia 
enacted the 2022 Law on the Crime of Sexual Violence, a stark reminder of the gap that 
can exist between laws on the books and equality in practice. An additional setback 
occurred in December 2022, when Parliament passed a new criminal code containing 
provisions that, according to Human Rights Watch, are harmful to women, minorities, 
and free speech (Bhwana 2022a). In particular, a provision criminalizing consensual sex 
outside of marriage will disproportionately harm minorities, including women, who are 
more likely to be reported by their husbands for adultery (Human Rights Watch 2022). 
The new criminal code may also give formal legality to regulations imposed by local 
officials, including curfews for women and female genital mutilation (Human Rights 
Watch 2022). These provisions are outside the scope of what is currently measured 
by Women, Business and the Law, but they constitute clear obstacles to equality for 
women in Indonesia. Thus, the example of Indonesia illustrates how progress can be 
made in some areas of the law and subsequently undone in others. 
While figure 2.6 illustrates that the pace of reform has been faster in historically 
less-equal economies, catch-up has not been a universal phenomenon. There are 
several examples of economies with scores that were well below the global average 
in 1970 and where the pace of reform, as measured by the log annualized growth in 
the scores, has been among the slowest. Most of these outliers are economies located 
in the Middle East and North Africa region. For example, Qatar’s score is the same in 
2022 as it was in 1970 (29.4), while the Islamic Republic of Iran’s score increased by 
just under 2 points (from 29.4 to 31.3). In Sub-Saharan Africa, Sudan also has exhibited 
a low level of progress despite starting from a low base. In 1970, the Women, Business 
and the Law score in Sudan was 17.5 (the same as in the United Arab Emirates and the 
lowest score in the index); by 2022, the score had increased to only 29.4. This stark lack 
of progress points to the difficulty of reforming historically discriminatory laws in some 
economies and highlights that poorer performing economies will not necessarily catch 
up over time.
As discussed in the second takeaway, there have been differences among regions 
and income groups in how much progress has been made toward legal equality over 
the last five decades. These differences are confirmed by examining the average log 
annualized growth rate in the Women, Business and the Law score for each region since 
1970. Overall, growth rates in the score, according to this metric, have been fastest in 
the Sub-Saharan Africa region, followed by OECD high-income economies. The average 
yearly growth rate in the score has been slowest in Europe and Central Asia, where legal 
equality was, on average, highest in 1970.
Not only are there differences between regions in how much progress has been 
made; the data also suggest that there are differences in the rate of catch-up within 
regions.17 Table 2.1 presents a statistical illustration of the rate of catch-up between 
economies, within regions and income groups, as well as for different time periods. 
The negative coefficients suggest that, on average, catch-up is happening across the 
globe, with historically less-equal economies tending to reduce the gap in legal gender 
equality at a faster pace (column 1). Furthermore, the average pace of catch-up tends

Note: The table presents statistical illustrations of the degree to which economies have been catching up in the Women, Business and the Law index since 1970. Columns 1–3 present the 
coefficients from a regression of the annualized change in the log WBL score (1970–2022) on the log 1970 WBL score. The dependent variable is calculated by subtracting the 1970 log WBL 
score from the 2022 log WBL score and dividing by the total number of years (52). Column 4 presents the coefficients from a regression of the average annualized change in the log WBL score 
in two periods, pre-2000 (1970−99) and post-2000 (2000−22) on the initial log WBL score at the start of each period. The t values appear in parentheses. The “Initial WBL score for the period 
after 2000” coefficient is the summation of the pre-2000 coefficient and an interaction term. The corresponding value in parentheses is therefore an F statistic. The fixed-effect structure of

to be faster among economies within the same region (column 2) and, to a lesser 
extent, within the same income group (column 3). The data also suggest that less 
gender-equal economies have been catching up approximately twice as fast since the 
turn of the century relative to the period before (column 4). To illustrate, based on the 
average speed of catch-up calculated across all economies and years (column 1), it will 
take another 64 years for an economy that is currently in the bottom 25th percentile 
on the Women, Business and the Law index (score of 68.12 in 2022) to close most legal 
gender gaps, denoted by a score of 90. 
If instead we consider the rate of catch-up in the period after 2000 (as presented 
in column 4), an economy in the bottom 25th percentile will take another 42 years, 
on average, to reach a score of 90 on the Women, Business and the Law index. These 
illustrations of the possible length of time to approach legal equality are based on 
regression estimates from the panel data. They contrast with the estimate of 50 years 
presented previously, which was based on a projection forward of the pace of reform 
of just the most recent year. Different methodologies will lead to different conclusions, 
but, in all cases, the estimates suggest that women will have to wait several decades for 
all legal obstacles to equal economic opportunity to be removed.
Despite suggestions of catch-up across economies, as illustrated in figure 2.6 and 
table 2.1, differences in scores persist across economies and regions. There are notable 
disparities in the progress of regions toward reducing the variability of the Women, 
Business and the Law scores among their constituent economies. For example, there 
has been progress in how economies in the OECD high-income region have reduced 
the inequality in their scores. By contrast, progress over time has been much more 
uneven among economies in the Middle East and North Africa region, resulting in an 
overall increase in cross-country variability in legal equality since 1970. This increase 
may reflect the fact that, in the early years, reforms were being undertaken by 
relatively few economies within the region. For example, in the decade from 1970 
to 1979, reforms were undertaken by only 6 of the 20 economies in the Middle East 


Data Trends from Five Decades of Reform
79
and North Africa region. In the 1980s, reforms were enacted in 5 economies. Since 
2010, there has been progress in reducing the within-region variability in legal equality 
scores. This progress reflects the fact that the act of reforming laws has become more 
widespread. However, there remains substantial room for improvement.
Takeaway 5. The catch-up effect has been happening across all 
areas covered by Women, Business and the Law, but the pace of 
progress has been uneven.
All 35 areas of measurement have improved since the 1970s. However, the pace has 
differed across indicators (figure 2.8). Those indicators showing lower levels of legal 
equality in 1970 generally reformed at a faster pace. For example, progress toward 
legal equality as captured by Workplace, the indicator with the second-lowest average 
score in 1970, is striking. Altogether, the gender gap has been closing fastest in the laws 
affecting Workplace, followed by Parenthood. It has been closing slowest in laws related 
to Mobility and Assets.
The rate of catch-up within indicators reveals that, in all areas covered, economies 
that historically had lower scores have been making faster progress over time 
(table 2.2). The statistics presented in table 2.2 suggest that the rate of catch-up 
has been strong in the laws affecting women’s decisions to enter and remain in 
the labor force (Workplace) as well as laws affecting their ability to start and run 
a business (Entrepreneurship). Considering changes in the Workplace indicator,

37 of the economies that scored 0 in the Workplace indicator in 1970 today receive 
a score of 100, indicating that all legal obstacles to women’s work as measured by 
Women, Business and the Law have been removed. In the Entrepreneurship indicator, 
15 economies increased their score from 0 in 1970 to 100 in 2022. In general, figure 
2.8, panel a, shows flatter trend lines for those areas of the law that already scored 
above the index average in 1970; for example, in laws related to agency and freedom 
of movement (Mobility) and those related to property and inheritance rights (Assets). 
Only one economy has gone from 0 to 100 on either the Assets or the Mobility 
indicator (South Africa and the United Arab Emirates, respectively).
However, as with the degree of catch-up in the aggregate index, substantial 
variabilities are evident across economies and regions in each of the indicator scores. 
The evolution of this variability over time has followed a different pattern for each 
indicator as economies made progress in different areas of the law and at different 
points in time. While table 2.2 shows that the catch-up effect was happening within all 
indicators on aggregate, it says nothing about the possible sequencing of reforms. As 
discussed under the first main takeaway, at the global level, some indicators have seen 
an acceleration in progress before others. 
When assessed at the regional level, there is some evidence that reforms happened 
under the Workplace indicator earlier than under the Pay indicator; however, the order 
in which Women, Business and the Law data points were reformed has varied across 
regions. For example, in South Asia, there was very little progress, on average, in either 
the Workplace or the Pay indicator up until the mid-1990s; at that point, reforms to 
laws captured under Workplace began to happen and took off in earnest from the 
middle to late 2000s. Reforms to the laws captured under Pay took place at a later point 
in time, but never accelerated as rapidly as reforms in the Workplace indicator. 
There is also some evidence that, in the Middle East and North Africa region, reforms 
in the Pay indicator happened after reforms in the Workplace indicator. In 1970, the 
regional average score for the Pay indicator (20 points) was higher than the average 
regional score for the Workplace indicator (10 points). In the 2000s, the average pace 
of reform in the Workplace indicator accelerated quickly, which has kept up until very 
recent years. In laws captured by Pay, however, a similar level of acceleration is not seen 
until the late 2010s. 
The pattern in the East Asia and Pacific region is different. Here, the average scores 
in Workplace and Pay in 1970 were 22 and 40 points, respectively. There was a rapid 
acceleration in the score under Workplace from the mid-1990s. By 2002, the average

Note: The table presents statistical illustrations of the degree to which economies have been catching up on the eight Women, Business and the Law indicators since 1970. 
Each column presents the coefficient from separate regressions of the annualized change in each of the eight WBL indicators’ log score (1970−2022) on that indicator’s log score 
in 1970. The dependent variable is calculated by subtracting the 1970 log WBL score from the 2022 log WBL score for each indicator and dividing by the total number of years (52). 
The t values appear in parentheses. Fixed effects are not included in these models. All regressions include a constant term.

score in both indicators was the same (46 points); from this point onward, they moved 
in tandem. Indeed, today, the average score of the Workplace and Pay indicators are 
closest in the East Asia and Pacific region (at 71 and 72 points, respectively) than in any 
other region. Much more research, ideally at the economy level, is needed to understand 
the sequencing of reforms and its relevance to their successful implementation.
Evidence from the past can guide future decisions 
Overcoming legal gender barriers benefits all of society—not just women. Increasing 
women’s rights is an end in and of itself, but it also has sizable impacts on economies 
and societies at large. Advancing the rights of women has consistently been shown to 
bring a range of socioeconomic benefits (as discussed in the section on the benefits of 
legal gender reform). Therefore, economies should have a keen interest in empowering 
women because it opens a path to prosperity. Where women have more rights, 
freedoms, and opportunities, the whole economy experiences tangible, measurable 
gains. Furthermore, where women share equal rights with men in accessing economic 
opportunities, economies are stronger in the face of shocks arising from multiple, 
overlapping, and compounding crises such as the COVID-19 pandemic, the climate crisis, 
rising prices and food insecurity, and increased fragility and conflict. If everyone has an 
opportunity to participate, greater things can be achieved. And, as noted previously, 
economic and technological development can also be an important driver of gender 
equality, suggesting the possibility of a virtuous cycle of gender equality and economic 
development.
Progress is happening everywhere, but plenty of work remains on all fronts. 
Overcoming legal gender barriers is both a necessity and a reality that is happening in 
every economy, irrespective of its income level, culture, or region. As demonstrated, 
since 1970 all economies have enacted reforms to enhance women’s economic 
empowerment, improving the global economy average score from 45.8 to 77.1 points. 
Some economies whose laws initially held more restrictions for women have shown 
impressive speed in overhauling legislation and expanding the legal rights of women, 
catching up with economies that historically have been more equal. But despite the 
progress achieved, much work still lies ahead. The size of the gap in women’s rights 
determines the necessity of reform because the tangible impact for women may be 
largest in those economies that started off with the fewest rights. An additional 1,549 
reforms are needed to reach legal gender equality everywhere, but only 34 were enacted 
last year. At this pace, it will take at least another 50 years to close the legal gender 
gap. Yet given the limited progress in some areas and specifically considering the low 
number of reforms in 2022, it may take much longer to close existing legal gender gaps 
across all areas. Even worse, some economies are reversing rights for which women 
have fiercely fought. Meanwhile, women worldwide have become important agents of 
change. They have been and still are taking to the streets to demand equal rights and 
opportunities, as protests in Argentina, Colombia, India, the Islamic Republic of Iran, 
Poland, the United States, and elsewhere vividly illustrate. 
Better data to measure progress can be transformative. The Women, Business and 
the Law panel data presented in this report offer a framework for identifying gaps and 
entry points to assess economies’ performance in closing legal gender gaps. Ground-
breaking research has been using the Women, Business and the Law panel data set to 


WOMEN, BUSINESS AND THE LAW 2023

uncover the motivations and benefits of reform (see box 2.1). Presenting these facts 
is a first step toward inspiring policy makers to remove existing discriminatory laws as 
well as promoting more research that uncovers the enabling factors needed to enhance 
women’s economic inclusion. More, and better, data are needed to monitor progress 
toward gender equality and to understand the impacts of laws and policies on women, 
their families, and economies. 
The Women, Business and the Law panel data offer a pathway to a substantial 
research agenda by exploring new topics that are fundamental to the effort to close 
persistent gender gaps in women’s rights. These efforts include representative surveys 
at the individual level to measure the implications of laws on the ground, a study of 
laws at the subnational level to understand within-country variance, and coherent 
assessments of the drivers of reform to understand what underlying factors need to 
be in place for successful gender reform. Furthermore, Women, Business and the Law 
panel data allow for more research in areas that are notoriously data scarce: gender and 
climate and women’s rights in fragile and conflict-affected regions. 
More analysis is needed to understand the process of reform in order to accelerate 
gender equality everywhere. Women still face legal barriers in multiple domains, despite 
global progress. The data show that the catch-up of historically lower-performing 
economies is detectable and is happening more frequently within the same region or 
income group than the overall convergence globally, especially since 2000. More needs to 
be done to understand why. The pace of catch-up across economies could be correlated 
with several enabling factors, including political change, economic development, and 
growth in human capital as well as institutional reform more broadly. Understanding 
the relationship between the reform of gender discriminatory laws and other attributes 
is an important area for future research and is a priority area for identifying actionable 
policy recommendations. 
The level of legal discrimination is particularly onerous in some highly populous 
countries and therefore restricts economic opportunities for a very large number of 
women. Removing structural barriers that constrain women’s economic participation 
requires an enabling environment and collaborative engagements with multiple 
stakeholders. Furthermore, support from civil society actors and gender champions 
is essential to drive the reform agenda forward. That said, change will not come 
overnight. Reforming laws is an incremental process that requires the political will to 
find compromise and the ability to start conversations that would have been considered 
taboo in legislatures just a few years ago. Although great achievements have been 
made over the last five decades, more needs to be done worldwide to ensure that 
good intentions are accompanied by tangible results—that is, equal opportunity under 
the law for women. Women cannot afford to wait another 50 years or more to reach 
equality. Neither can the global economy.

3.	 A reform is counted if an economy reforms a law that affects any of the 35 areas of measurement 
resulting in a change of answers from “no” to “yes.” As such, a reform is counted each time a legal 
restriction formerly placed on women is removed in the law. For example, Uganda’s 2022 Succession 
(Amendment) Act resulted in a count of three reforms because answers in the following areas changed 
from “no” to “yes”: Do sons and daughters have equal rights to inherit assets from their parents? Do 
female and male surviving spouses have equal rights to inherit assets? Can a woman choose where to 
live in the same way as a man? Reversal of rights on progress that has already been made in an economy 
toward women’s full economic empowerment (a change from “yes” to “no”) along with legal changes 
that do not affect the 35 areas of measurement (legal changes that still result in a “yes” answer for the 
35 areas) are not counted as a reform.

Women, Business and the Law measures laws and regulations affecting women’s 
economic inclusion in 190 economies. Although progress has been made over the last 53 
years, the data confirm that more work is needed to ensure that women have equality of 
opportunity when entering the workforce and starting their own businesses. To highlight 
these opportunities for change, Women, Business and the Law 2023 presents an index 
structured around the stages of a woman’s working life (figure A.1).
This framework helps to align areas of the law with the economic decisions that 
women make as they experience various milestones. The indicators not only represent 
women’s interactions with the law as they begin, progress through, and end their 
careers, but also are easily replicable measures of the legal environment that women 
must navigate as entrepreneurs and employees. This edition of Women, Business and 
the Law presents an update of the index, taking into account the laws and regulations 
reformed between October 2, 2021, and October 1, 2022.
Methodology
Women, Business and the Law is based on an analysis of the domestic laws and 
regulations that affect women’s economic opportunities. The indicators were selected on 
the basis of their association with measures of women’s economic empowerment and 
through research and consultation with experts. They are also in line with the international 
legal frameworks set out in the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination 
against Women (CEDAW); the Committee on the Elimination of Discrimination against 
Women General Recommendations (CEDAW GR); the United Nations (UN) Declaration 
on the Elimination of Violence against Women (DEVAW); and the International Labour 
Organization (ILO) Equal Remuneration Convention, 1951 (No.  100), the Discrimination 
(Employment and Occupation) Convention, 1958 (No. 111), the Maternity Protection 
Convention, 2000 (No. 183), and the Violence and Harassment Convention, 2019 (No. 190).

Note: The index scores 35 data points across eight indicators composed of four or five binary questions, with each indicator representing a different 
phase of a woman’s life. Indicator-level scores are obtained by calculating the unweighted average of responses to the questions within that indicator 
and scaling the result to 100. For each question, Y = 1 and N = 0. Overall scores are then calculated by taking the average of each indicator, with 100 
representing the highest possible score.

The data set and analysis can be used to support research and policy discussions 
on the ways in which the legal environment influences women’s economic activity. 
Thirty-five data points are scored across eight indicators composed of four or five binary 
questions, with each indicator representing a different phase of a woman’s life (table A.1). 
Indicator-level scores are obtained by calculating the unweighted average of responses to 
the questions within that indicator and scaling the result to 100. Overall scores are then 
calculated by taking the average of each indicator, with 100 representing the highest 
possible score.
Examining the data for one economy illustrates how scoring works in the index. 
Ecuador, for example, receives a score of 100 for Mobility, Workplace, Pay, Marriage, 
Assets, and Pension, which indicates that no legal constraints are found in the areas 
measured under these indicators (figure A.2).
Under Parenthood, however, the lack of at least 14 weeks of paid maternity leave, 
government-administered maternity leave benefits, or paid parental leave results in a 
score of 40. The score for Entrepreneurship is 75 because the law does not prohibit 
gender-based discrimination in access to credit.
Based on this information, the overall score for Ecuador is calculated as the unweighted 
average of all eight indicator scores on a scale of 0–100, with 100 representing the best 
score overall. Ecuador thus scores 89.4 on the Women, Business and the Law index.
Strengths and limitations of the methodology
To construct the index, Women, Business and the Law relies on feedback from more 
than 2,400 respondents with expertise in family, labor, and criminal law, including 
lawyers, judges, academics, and members of civil society organizations working 
locally on gender issues. Besides filling out written questionnaires, respondents 
provide references to relevant legislation. The Women, Business and the Law team 
then collects the texts of these laws and regulations and verifies questionnaire 
responses for accuracy. Responses are validated against codified sources of national 
law, including constitutions, codes, laws, statutes, rules, regulations, and procedures 
in areas such as labor, social security, civil procedure, violence against women, 
marriage and family, inheritance, nationality, and land. The data reflect legislation in 
force as of October 1, 2022.
This unique approach has both strengths and limitations (table A.2). Because the indicators 
are binary, they may not reflect the nuances or details of some of the policies measured. 


WOMEN, BUSINESS AND THE LAW 2023

Indicators are also based on standardized assumptions to ensure comparability across 
economies. For example, an assumption used for questions on maternity leave is that the 
woman in question has one child. Although maternity leave benefits often differ for multiple 
births, only data for individual births are captured. Another assumption is that the woman 
in question is located in the largest business city of the economy. In federal economies, laws 
affecting women can vary by state or province. Even in nonfederal economies, women in 
rural areas and small towns could face more restrictive local legislation. Women, Business 
and the Law does not capture such restrictions unless they are also found in the main 
business city. Finally, where personal law prescribes different rights and obligations for 
different groups of women, the data focus on the most populous group. Thus, the study 
may not capture restrictions applying only to minority populations.
Although it ensures comparability of the data, the use of standardized assumptions 
has a limited ability to reflect the full diversity of women’s experiences. Women, Business 
and the Law recognizes that the laws it measures do not apply to all women in the 
same way. Women face intersectional forms of discrimination based not only on gender 
and sex but also on sexuality, race, gender identity, religion, family status, ethnicity, 
nationality, disability, and many other grounds. Women, Business and the Law therefore 
encourages readers to interpret the data in conjunction with other available research. 
Women, Business and the Law focuses on the ways in which the official legal and 
regulatory environment regulates how women can work or operate their own businesses. 
While the attention is centered on the formal economy—that is, in jobs that provide social 
protection and other entitlements through formal arrangements—half of the indicators have 
direct relevance for women working in the informal sector. The data captured by Women, 
Business and the Law can be relevant for women regardless of their official employment 
status. For example, laws affecting women’s agency and mobility, ability to own or inherit 
property, or protections against domestic violence apply to women in both formal and

METHODOLOGICAL STRENGTHS AND LIMITATIONS OF THE WOMEN, 
BUSINESS AND THE LAW INDEX
Feature
Strength
Limitation
Use of standardized 
assumptions
Data are comparable across economies, and 
methodology is transparent.
The scope of data is smaller; only regulatory 
reforms in the areas measured can be tracked 
systematically.
Coverage of largest 
business city only
Data collection is manageable, and data are 
comparable.
In federal economies, data may be less representa-
tive where laws differ across locations.
Focus on the most 
populous group
Data are comparable across economies where 
parallel legal systems prescribe different rights 
for different groups of women.
Restrictions that apply to minority populations may 
not be captured.
Emphasis on the 
formal sector 
Attention remains centered on the formal 
economy, where regulations are most relevant.
The reality faced by women in the informal sector, 
which may be a significant population in some 
economies, is not fully reflected.
Measure of codified 
laws only
Indicators are actionable because the law is 
what policy makers can change.
Where systematic implementation of legislation is 
lacking, regulatory changes alone will not achieve 
the desired results; social and cultural norms are not 
considered.

informal employment. Additionally, legal protections affecting the workplace provide a 
foundation for economic inclusion and offer incentives for women to enter and remain in the 
labor force. Laws affecting women’s mobility and agency within households directly affect 
their ability to start and operate registered businesses. Although many women in developing 
economies work informally, this project aims to define some of the features of the legal 
framework that enable women to transition from the informal to the formal economy. 
This project also recognizes the often large gaps between laws on the books and 
actual practice. One reason for these gaps may be poor implementation of legislation 
stemming from weak enforcement, poor design, or low institutional capacity. Nonetheless, 
identifying legal differences is one step toward better understanding where women’s 
economic rights may be restricted in practice.
Women, Business and the Law acknowledges that equal opportunities for women in 
business and the workplace depend on an interplay of economic, social, and cultural factors. 
For example, unless women are able to get an education or build their skills, equalizing 
laws affecting entrepreneurship and employment could mean little. Other factors, such as 
infrastructure, also may affect the ability and desire of women to work. In addition, social 
and cultural norms may prevent women from running a business or working outside the 
home. Within this overall picture, Women, Business and the Law recognizes the limitations 
of its assumptions and its focus on statutory law. Even though such assumptions may 
come at the expense of specificity, they also ensure data comparability across economies.
Indicators and questions
This section looks more closely at the 35 scored binary questions, grouped by indicator 
(box A.1). Answers to the questions are based on codified law only. Customary law is not 
considered unless it has been codified. Where the answer differs according to the legal 
system (for example, in mixed legal systems where different laws govern different groups 
of people within an economy), the answer used is the one that applies to the majority 
of the population. Supranational law, such as that enacted by the Organization for the 
Harmonization of Business Law in Africa (OHADA), is not considered where domestic law 
contravenes supranational rules and limits the legal capacity of women. This section details 
by indicator how answers are standardized and made comparable across all economies.
BOX A.1  ASSUMPTIONS USED TO ENSURE COMPARABILITY
The woman in question
•	 Resides in the economy’s main business city;
• 	Has reached the legal age of majority and is capable of making decisions as an adult, 
is in good health, and has no criminal record;
• 	Is a lawful citizen of the economy being examined;
• 	Is a cashier in the food retail sector in a supermarket or grocery store that has 
60 employees;
• 	Is a cisgender, heterosexual woman in a monogamous first marriage registered with the 
appropriate authorities (de facto marriages and customary unions are not measured);
• 	Is of the same religion as her husband;
(Box continues next page)


WOMEN, BUSINESS AND THE LAW 2023
92
• 	Is in a marriage under the rules of the default marital property regime or the most 
common regime for that jurisdiction, which will not change during the course of the 
marriage; and
• 	Is not a member of a union unless membership is mandatory. Membership is consid-
ered mandatory when collective bargaining agreements cover more than 50 percent 
of the workforce in the food retail sector and when they apply to individuals who 
were not party to the original collective bargaining agreement.
For the questions on maternity, paternity, and parental leave, it is assumed that
•	 The woman gave birth to her first child without complications on October 1, 2022, and 
her child is in good health. Answers will therefore correspond to legislation in force as 
of October 1, 2022, even if the law provides for changes over time.
•	 Both parents have been working long enough to accrue any maternity, paternity, 
and parental benefits.
•	 If maternity benefit systems are not mandatory or were not operational as of 
October 1, 2022, they are not measured.
For the questions on inheritance rights, it is assumed that
•	 The deceased has not left a will, and so the rules of intestate succession apply.
•	 In determining the inheritance rights of spouses, male and female surviving spouses 
do not have any living children.
For the questions on retirement and pensions, it is assumed that
•	 The woman gave birth without complications to two healthy children.
•	 The woman ceased all paid activity during periods of childcare. If the period covered 
by a pension credit is conditioned on the age of the child, the period until the child 
reaches age one is counted.
•	 If transitional provisions gradually change the retirement age, the answers reflect the 
retirement age as of October 1, 2022, even if the law provides for changes over time.
•	 If a mandatory contributory pension system applicable to the private sector and a 
noncontributory universal pension system coexist, the answers correspond to the 
rules applicable to the mandatory contributory pension system.
•	 If pension systems are not mandatory or were not operational as of October 1, 
2022, they are not measured.
BOX A.1  ASSUMPTIONS USED TO ENSURE COMPARABILITY (continued)
Mobility
The Mobility indicator measures constraints on a woman’s agency and freedom of movement, 
both of which are likely to influence her decision to enter the labor force and engage in 
entrepreneurial activity (Htun, Jensenius, and Nelson-Nunez 2019). This indicator has four 
components that measure the following:
•
• Whether a woman can choose where to live in the same way as a man. A score of 1 is 
assigned if there are no restrictions on  a woman choosing where to live. A score of 0 is 
assigned if there are legal restrictions on a woman choosing where to live, if the husband 


APPENDIX A: DATA NOTES
93
chooses the marital home or has more weight in determining where the family will 
live, or if a woman’s domicile automatically follows that of her husband.
•
• Whether a woman can travel outside her home in the same way as a man. A score 
of 1 is assigned if there are no restrictions on a woman traveling alone domestically. 
A score of 0 is assigned if permission, additional documentation, or the presence of 
her husband or guardian is required for a woman to travel alone domestically. A score 
of 0 is also assigned if a woman must justify her reasons for leaving the home or if 
leaving the home without a valid reason is considered disobedience with legal conse-
quences, such as loss of right to maintenance.
•
• Whether a woman can apply for a passport in the same way as a man. This question 
considers actual application forms and procedures available at the relevant agency 
or on official government websites, in addition to what the law specifies. A score of 
1 is assigned if there are no gender differences in passport application procedures. 
A score of 0 is assigned if an adult woman needs the permission or signature of her 
husband, father, or other relative or guardian to apply for a passport. A score of 0 is 
also assigned if passport application procedures or forms require a woman to provide 
details about her husband, father, or other relative or guardian or additional docu-
ments such as a marriage certificate and if the same is not required of a man.
•
• Whether a woman can travel outside the country in the same way as a man. A score 
of 1 is assigned if there are no restrictions on a woman traveling alone internationally. 
A score of 0 is assigned if permission, additional documentation, or the presence of 
her husband or a guardian is required for a woman to leave the country. A score of 
0 is also assigned if the law requires a married woman to accompany her husband out 
of the country if he wishes her to do so.
Workplace
The Workplace indicator analyzes laws affecting women’s decisions to enter the labor 
market, including women’s legal capacity and ability to work, as well as protections in the 
workplace against discrimination and sexual harassment. Antidiscrimination legislation 
is positively associated with women’s employment and earnings, whereas sexual 
harassment can negatively influence women’s career trajectories (Amin and Islam 2015; 
Cavalcanti and Tavares 2016; McLaughlin, Uggen, and Blackstone 2017). This indicator 
has four components that assess the following:
•
• Whether a woman can get a job in the same way as a man. A score of 1 is assigned if 
there are no restrictions on a woman’s legal capacity and ability to get a job or pursue 
a trade or profession. A score of 0 is assigned if a husband can prevent his wife from 
working or if permission or additional documentation is required for a woman to work 
but not for a man. A score of 0 is also assigned if it is considered a form of disobedi-
ence with legal consequences, such as loss of maintenance, for a woman to work 
contrary to her husband’s wishes or the interests of the family.
•
• Whether the law prohibits discrimination in employment based on gender. A score 
of 1 is assigned if the law prohibits employers from discriminating based on sex or 
gender or mandates equal treatment of women and men in employment. A score of 
0 is assigned if the law does not prohibit such discrimination or only prohibits it in one 
aspect of employment, such as pay or dismissal.


WOMEN, BUSINESS AND THE LAW 2023
94
•
• Whether there is legislation on sexual harassment in employment. A score of 1 is 
assigned if legal provisions specifically protect against sexual harassment in employ-
ment, including unwelcome verbal or physical conduct of a sexual nature. A score of 
0 is assigned if there is no such legislation. A score of 0 is also assigned if the law 
addresses harassment in general but makes no reference to acts of a sexual nature or 
contact or if it states only that the employer has a duty to prevent sexual harassment 
and has no provisions prohibiting it or providing sanctions or other forms of redress.
•
• Whether there are criminal penalties or civil remedies for sexual harassment in 
employment. A score of 1 is assigned if the law establishes criminal sanctions, such 
as fines or imprisonment, for sexual harassment in employment. A score of 1 is also 
assigned if the criminal code provides for reparation or damages for offenses covered 
by the code or if the law provides for civil remedies or compensation for victims of 
sexual harassment in employment or the workplace, even after dismissal of the victim. 
A score of 0 is assigned if the law establishes neither criminal sanctions for sexual 
harassment in employment nor civil remedies or compensation for victims of sexual 
harassment in employment. A score of 0 is also assigned if the law only prohibits 
sexual harassment in employment and sets forth that the employer should apply dis-
cretionary sanctions.
Pay
The Pay indicator measures laws affecting occupational segregation and the gender wage 
gap. Restrictions on certain jobs have been found to be correlated negatively with female 
employment (Costa, Silva, and Vaz 2009; Ogloblin 2005; Scarborough 2020; World Bank 
2012; Zveglich and van der Meulen Rodgers 2003). This indicator has four components 
that assess the following:
•
• Whether the law mandates equal remuneration for work of equal value. “Remuneration” 
refers to the ordinary, basic, or minimum wage or salary and any additional emolu-
ments payable directly or indirectly, whether in cash or in kind, by the employer to the 
worker and arising from the worker’s employment. “Work of equal value” refers not 
only to the same or similar jobs but also to different jobs of the same value. A score 
of 1 is assigned if employers are legally obliged to pay equal remuneration to male 
and female employees who perform work of equal value in accordance with these 
definitions. A score of 0 is assigned if the law limits the principle of equal remuneration 
to equal work, the same work, similar work, or work of a similar nature. A score of 
0 is also assigned if the law limits the broad concept of “remuneration” to only basic 
wages or salary.
•
• Whether a woman can work at night in the same way as a man. A score of 1 is 
assigned if a woman who is not pregnant and not nursing can work at night in the 
same way as a man. A score of 1 is also assigned when restrictions on a woman’s 
ability to work at night do not apply to the food retail sector, a woman’s consent to 
work at night is required, or an employer needs to comply with safety measures (such 
as providing transportation). A score of 0 is assigned if the law broadly prohibits a 
woman, including one with children over the age of one, from working at night or 
limits the hours that she can work at night. A score of 0 is also assigned if the law 
gives the relevant authority the power to restrict or prohibit a woman’s ability to work 
at night, regardless of any decisions issued by that authority.


APPENDIX A: DATA NOTES
95
•
• Whether a woman can work in a job deemed dangerous in the same way as a man. 
A score of 1 is assigned if no laws prohibit or restrict a woman who is not pregnant 
and not nursing from working in a broad and subjective category of jobs deemed haz-
ardous, arduous, or morally inappropriate. A score of 0 is assigned if the law prohibits 
or restricts a woman’s ability to work in jobs deemed hazardous, arduous, or morally 
inappropriate. A score of 0 is also assigned if the law gives the relevant authority the 
power to determine whether particular jobs are too hazardous, arduous, or morally 
inappropriate for a woman but not for a man, regardless of any decisions issued by 
that authority.
•
• Whether a woman can work in an industrial job in the same way as a man. A score of 
1 is assigned if a woman who is not pregnant and not nursing can work in the mining, 
construction, manufacturing, energy, water, agriculture, and transportation industries 
in the same way as a man. A score of 0 is assigned if the law prohibits a woman from 
working in any of these industries. A score of 0 is also assigned if a woman’s employ-
ment in the relevant industries is restricted in any way, such as by prohibiting her from 
working at night in “industrial undertakings” or by giving the relevant authority the 
power to prohibit or restrict her ability to work in certain jobs or industries, regardless 
of any decisions issued by that authority.
Marriage
The Marriage indicator measures legal constraints related to marriage and divorce. Legal 
discrimination against women, including limits on their ability to be head of household, 
has been found to be negatively correlated with labor force participation (Goldin and 
Olivetti 2013; Gonzales et al. 2015). Unequal rights in marriage and divorce can also 
have negative effects on a woman’s intrahousehold bargaining power and jeopardize 
her financial security when a divorce is finalized (Voena 2015). This indicator has five 
components that measure the following:
•
• Whether the law is free of any provisions that require a married woman to obey her 
husband. A score of 1 is assigned if there is no provision requiring a married woman 
to obey her husband. A score of 0 is assigned if there is any provision stating that a 
married woman must obey her husband or if disobeying the husband has legal ramifi-
cations for a married woman, such as loss of her right to maintenance. 
•
• Whether a woman can be head of household in the same way as a man. A score of 
1 is assigned if there are no restrictions on a woman being head of household or head 
of family. A score of 0 is assigned if the law designates the husband as head of house-
hold or stipulates that he leads the family. A score of 0 is also assigned if a male is 
designated as the default family member who receives the family book or equivalent 
document that is needed for accessing services. Gender differences under tax law are 
not measured by this question.
•
• Whether there is legislation specifically addressing domestic violence. A score of 
1 is assigned if there is legislation addressing domestic violence that includes criminal 
sanctions or provides for protection orders for domestic violence. A score of 0 is 
assigned if there is no legislation addressing domestic violence, if the domestic vio-
lence legislation does not provide for sanctions or protection orders, or if only a spe-
cific category of women or family member is protected. A score of 0 is also assigned 


WOMEN, BUSINESS AND THE LAW 2023
96
if there is only a provision that increases penalties for general crimes covered in the 
criminal code if committed between spouses or within the family.
•
• Whether a woman can obtain a judgment of divorce in the same way as a man. 
A score of 1 is assigned if the process to obtain a judgment of divorce is equal for a 
woman and a man or provides additional protections for a woman, such as prohibiting 
a husband from initiating divorce proceedings while his wife is pregnant. A score of 
0 is assigned if there are procedural or evidentiary differences for a woman, if only a 
man can initiate divorce proceedings, or if divorce is not legally allowed.
•
• Whether a woman has the same right to remarry as a man. A score of 1 is assigned 
if a woman and a man have equal rights to remarry. A score of 0 is assigned if the 
law limits a woman’s right to remarry, such as by requiring a waiting period before 
remarriage to which a man is not subject. A score of 0 is also assigned if divorce is not 
legally allowed.
Parenthood
The Parenthood indicator examines laws affecting women’s work during and after 
pregnancy. Women are more likely to return to work if the law mandates maternity 
leave (Berger and Waldfogel 2004). This indicator has five components that measure the 
following:
•
• Whether paid leave of at least 14 weeks is available to mothers. A score of 1 is 
assigned if mothers are legally entitled to at least 14 weeks (98 calendar days) of paid 
leave for the birth of a child through maternity leave, parental leave, or a combination 
of both. A score of 0 is assigned if the law does not establish paid leave for mothers 
or if the length of paid leave is less than 14 weeks.
•
• Whether the government administers 100 percent of maternity leave benefits. 
A  score of 1 is assigned if leave benefits are fully administered by a government 
entity, including compulsory social insurance schemes (such as social security), public 
funds, government-mandated private insurance, or employer reimbursement of any 
maternity leave benefits paid directly to an employee. A score of 0 is assigned if any 
of the cost is shared by the employer. A score of 0 is also assigned if contributions or 
taxes are mandated only for female employees, if the social insurance scheme that 
provides maternity leave benefits is optional, or if no paid leave is available to expect-
ant and new mothers.
•
• Whether paid leave is available to fathers. A score of 1 is assigned if fathers are 
legally entitled to at least one day of paid paternity leave for the birth of a child or 
if the law reserves a portion of paid parental leave specifically for fathers—that is, 
through “use-it-or-lose-it” policies or fathers’ quotas. A score of 1 is also assigned if 
fathers are individually entitled to paid parental leave. A score of 0 is assigned if the 
law does not guarantee fathers any paid paternity leave or other specific leave for the 
birth of a child. A score of 0 is also assigned if allowances for the birth of a child must 
be deducted from annual or sick leave.
•
• Whether there is paid parental leave. A score of 1 is assigned if parents are legally 
entitled to some form of full-time paid parental leave, either shared between mother 


APPENDIX A: DATA NOTES
97
and father (at least two weeks) or as an individual entitlement that each can take 
regardless of the other (at least one week each). A score of 1 is also assigned if the 
duration of paid maternity leave and paid paternity leave is the same. A score of 0 is 
assigned if the law does not mandate any form of paid parental leave.
•
• Whether dismissal of pregnant workers is prohibited. A score of 1 is assigned if 
the law explicitly prohibits the dismissal of pregnant women, if pregnancy cannot 
serve as grounds for terminating a contract, or if dismissal of pregnant workers is 
considered a form of unlawful termination, unfair dismissal, or wrongful discharge. 
A score of 0 is assigned if there are no provisions prohibiting the dismissal of preg-
nant workers or if the law only prohibits the dismissal of pregnant workers during 
maternity leave, for a limited period of the pregnancy, or when pregnancy results in 
illness or disability.
Entrepreneurship
The Entrepreneurship indicator measures constraints on the ability of women to start 
and run a business. For example, having access to a bank account is strongly correlated 
with women’s labor supply (Field et al. 2021; Gonzales et al. 2015; Islam, Muzi, and Amin 
2019). This indicator has four components that measure the following: 
•
• Whether the law prohibits discrimination in access to credit based on gender. 
A score of 1 is assigned if the law prohibits discrimination by creditors based on sex 
or gender or prescribes equal access for both men and women when conducting 
financial transactions or entrepreneurial activities. A score of 1 is also assigned if 
the law prohibits gender discrimination when accessing goods and services (and 
services are defined to include financial services). A score of 0 is assigned if the law 
does not prohibit such discrimination or if the law does not provide for effective 
remedies.
•
• Whether a woman can sign a contract in the same way as a man. A score of 1 
is assigned if a woman obtains full legal capacity on reaching the age of majority 
and there are no restrictions on her signing legally binding contracts. A score of 0 is 
assigned if a woman has limited legal capacity to sign a contract or needs the signa-
ture, consent, or permission of her husband or guardian to do so. 
•
• Whether a woman can register a business in the same way as a man. A score of 1 is 
assigned if there are no restrictions on a woman registering a business. A score of 0 is 
assigned if a woman has limited legal capacity, including situations in which she needs 
her husband’s or guardian’s permission, signature, or consent to register a business. 
A score of 0 is also assigned if the registration process at any stage requires a woman 
to provide additional information or documentation that is not required of a man.
•
• Whether a woman can open a bank account in the same way as a man. A score of 
1 is assigned if there are no restrictions on a woman opening a bank account. A score 
of 0 is assigned if a woman has limited legal capacity or is required to provide any 
additional permission or documentation that is not required of a man. A score of 0 is 
also assigned if legal provisions limit the ability of a woman to open a bank account, 
such as by stating that only a married woman who is separately employed from her 
husband may open a bank account in her own name.


WOMEN, BUSINESS AND THE LAW 2023

Assets
The Assets indicator examines gender differences in property and inheritance law, 
including instances in which legal systems are supported by customary law and judicial 
precedent. Improving property and inheritance rights is positively associated with female 
earnings and employment (Heath and Tan 2018; Peterman 2011) as well as with women’s 
access to housing and land (Gaddis, Lahoti, and Swaminathan 2020). This indicator has 
five components that measure the following:
•
• Whether men and women have equal ownership rights to immovable property. 
A score of 1 is assigned if there are no restrictions on a woman’s legal capacity and 
rights to immovable property. A score of 0 is assigned if a woman’s rights to own or 
administer property are legally restricted. A score of 0 is also assigned if there are 
gender differences in the legal treatment of spousal property, such as granting the 
husband administrative control of marital property.
•
• Whether sons and daughters have equal rights to inherit assets from their parents. 
A score of 1 is assigned if sons and daughters have the same rights to inherit assets 
from their parents. A score of 0 is assigned if there are gender-based differences in 
the recognition of children as heirs to property.
•
• Whether male and female surviving spouses have equal rights to inherit assets. 
A score of 1 is assigned if surviving spouses of either gender with no living children 
have the same inheritance rights. A score of 0 is assigned if there are gender-based 
differences in the inheritance rights of surviving spouses.
•
• Whether the law grants male and female spouses equal administrative authority 
over assets during marriage. A score of 1 is assigned if spouses retain administrative 
power over the assets each brought to the marriage or acquired during the mar-
riage and their accrued value without the need for spousal consent. A score of 1 
is also assigned if spouses administer their separate property, but spousal consent 
is required for major transactions, such as selling or pledging the property as col-
lateral, or if both spouses have equal rights in the administration and transaction of 
joint property. A score of 0 is assigned if the husband has administrative rights over 
marital property, including any separate property of the wife, or if the husband’s word 
prevails in case of disagreement. 
•
• Whether the law provides for the valuation of nonmonetary contributions. 
Nonmonetary contributions include caring for minor children, taking care of the family 
home, or any other nonmonetized contribution from a stay-at-home spouse. A score 
of 1 is assigned if there is an explicit legal recognition of such contributions and the 
law provides for equal or equitable division of the property or the transfer of a lump 
sum to the stay-at-home spouse based on nonmonetary contributions. A score of 1 
is also assigned if the default marital property regime is full community, partial com-
munity, or deferred community of property because these regimes implicitly recognize 
nonmonetary contributions at the time of property division and benefit both spouses 
regardless of who purchased property or holds title to it. A score of 0 is assigned if the 
default marital property regime is not a form of community of property and there is 
no explicit legal provision providing for equal or equitable division of property based 
on nonmonetary contributions.


APPENDIX A: DATA NOTES

Pension
The Pension indicator assesses laws affecting the size of a woman’s pension. Early 
retirement can widen the potential gender gap in pension levels and increase women’s 
risk of poverty in old age (Burn et al. 2020; Chłoń-Domińczak 2017). This indicator has 
four components that measure the following: 
•
• Whether the age at which men and women can retire with full pension benefits is 
the same. A score of 1 is assigned if the statutory age at which men and women can 
retire and receive an irrevocable minimum old-age pension is the same. A score of 
0 is assigned if there is a difference in the statutory age or if there is no mandatory 
pension scheme implemented for private sector workers.
•
• Whether the age at which men and women can retire with partial pension benefits 
is the same. “Partial pension benefits” refer to a reduced or proportional minimum 
old-age pension payable to workers who did not accumulate enough work experience 
or periods of contribution or have not reached the statutory age to qualify for a mini-
mum old-age pension. A score of 1 is assigned if the age at which men and women 
can retire and receive partial pension benefits is the same or if the age at which men 
and women can retire and receive partial benefits is not mandated. A score of 0 is 
assigned if the age at which men and women can retire and receive partial pension 
benefits is different or if there is no mandatory pension scheme implemented for 
private sector workers.
•
• Whether the mandatory retirement age for men and women is the same. A score of 
1 is assigned if the legally established age at which men and women must retire is the 
same or if there is no mandatory retirement age. A score of 0 is assigned if the age at 
which men and women must retire is different. 
•
• Whether periods of absence from work due to childcare are accounted for in pen-
sion benefits. A score of 1 is assigned if pension contributions are paid or credited 
during maternity or parental leave or the leave period is considered a qualifying period 
of employment used for the purpose of calculating pension benefits. A score of 1 is 
also assigned if there are mechanisms to compensate for any contribution gaps and to 
ensure that the leave period does not reduce the assessment base or pension amounts 
or if there are no mandatory contributory pension schemes, but there is a noncon-
tributory universal social pension conditioned on noncontributory requirements with 
no means test attached. A score of 0 is assigned if there are no compensating pension 
arrangements for periods of childcare or if there is no mandatory contributory pension 
scheme for private sector workers and no noncontributory universal social pension.
Reforms and data updates
Each year, Women, Business and the Law indicators capture changes in domestic laws 
and regulations that affect women’s economic opportunities. Summaries of such changes 
are listed in annex 1B, thereby acknowledging the legal reform efforts undertaken by 
governments during the period reviewed. Any legislative or regulatory change that 
positively affects the score assigned to a given economy on any question under the eight 
indicators is classified as a reform; when the change affects the score negatively, it is 
classified as a negative change.


WOMEN, BUSINESS AND THE LAW 2023
100
For questions that refer to legal rights, the change must be mandatory, meaning 
that women can enforce their rights in court or sanctions can be leveled by a regulatory 
body such as a central bank, employment tribunal, national human rights commission, 
or other enforcement body, including the police. For questions that refer to benefits, 
such as maternity, parental, or pension benefits, women must be able to obtain the 
benefit as of the cutoff date of the report. Policies, guidelines, model rules, principles, and 
recommendations are excluded, as are ratified international conventions when they have 
not been incorporated into domestic law. Reforms affecting the Women, Business and 
the Law indicators include, but are not limited to, amendments to or the introduction of 
a new constitution, labor law, family or personal status law, penal code, or administrative 
procedures.
Data for all economies are reviewed by local respondents and verified with the 
corresponding basis by the Women, Business and the Law team annually. This review 
can lead to corrections of data as a result of new information obtained, clarifications of 
answers, or consistency checks. To provide a comparable time series for research, the 
data set is back-calculated to adjust for any revisions in data due to corrections. 
Governments can submit queries on the data and provide new information to the 
Women, Business and the Law team. Together with the team’s response, the submissions 
are available on the project website at https://wbl.worldbank.org.
Methodological changes
The Women, Business and the Law team periodically revises and implements changes 
to the methodology to ensure a rigorous analysis of laws and regulations. The following 
methodology changes, already announced in previous editions, will be implemented in 
Women, Business and the Law 2024:
•
• Marriage. The question of whether a woman is or is not legally required to obey her 
husband will be revised to capture all forms of implied obedience outlined in the law. 
Unequal bargaining power within the household puts married women at a disadvan-
tage compared with married men. Currently the question only captures instances 
where the letter of the law explicitly refers to obedience. This approach does not 
account for instances where the law may not refer verbatim to the term “obedience” 
but may still legally require a wife to obey her husband, for example by imposing 
marital duties on the wife only. 
•
• Parenthood. The provision of paid parental leave to working parents can positively 
affect women’s labor market outcomes (Akgündüz and Plantenga 2013) and increase 
the support provided by fathers to mothers in caring for newborns (Rossin-Slater 
2017). However, the design of leave policies matters more for gender equality than 
their mere existence (Brandth and Kvande 2018; Frodermann, Wrohlich, and Zucc 
2020; Marynissen et al. 2019; Patnaik 2014). To reflect more closely the existence and 
design of paid leave policies for working parents around the world, Women, Business 
and the Law proposes merging the questions related to paid maternity leave, paid 
paternity leave, and paid parental leave into two questions that capture the existence 
of paid leave available to mothers and fathers and their respective length. Women, 
Business and the Law will therefore continue to research and consult with experts 
on this issue. This effort may lead to a rephrasing of the Parenthood indicator in the 


APPENDIX A: DATA NOTES
101
2024 edition of the report to streamline the reporting on paid leave policies available 
to working parents around the world.
As the team plans to introduce new indicators on women’s safety, access to childcare, 
and implementation, the methodology for other questions will be reviewed and potentially 
revised in the future. Women, Business and the Law aims to maintain the relevance of 
the methodology by updating it as necessary and preserving comparability over time 
by only reviewing the methodology at regular medium-term intervals. The process and 
timeline for methodological changes will follow the protocols established in the Women, 
Business and the Law manual and guide, available on the project’s website, at https://
wbl.worldbank.org/en/aboutus. 
More detailed data on each economy included in this report appear on the project 
website at https://wbl.worldbank.org. The team welcomes feedback on the methodology 
and construction of this set of indicators and looks forward to improving their coverage 
and scope. Comments can be offered by contacting the Women, Business and the Law 
team at wbl@worldbank.org.

Women, Business and the Law 2023 is the ninth in a series of annual studies measuring 
the laws and regulations that affect women’s economic opportunity in 190 economies. 
The project presents eight indicators structured around women’s interactions with the 
law as they move through their lives and careers: Mobility, Workplace, Pay, Marriage, 
Parenthood, Entrepreneurship, Assets, and Pension. The 2023 edition identifies barriers to 
women’s economic participation and encourages reform of discriminatory laws. This year, 
the study also includes research, a literature review, and analysis of 53 years of reforms 
for women’s rights.
Examining the economic decisions that women make throughout their working lives as 
well as tracking regulatory changes from 1970 to today, the study makes an important 
contribution to research and policy discussions about the state of women’s economic 
opportunities. By presenting powerful examples of change and highlighting the gaps 
still remaining, Women, Business and the Law 2023 is a vital tool in ensuring economic 
empowerment for all. Data in Women, Business and the Law 2023 are current as of
