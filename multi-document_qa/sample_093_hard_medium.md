# Question

According to the two articles above, which of the following statements is incorrect?

# Choices

- A: Using the following prompt to generate a specific molecular will get a better performance on molT5 than asking GPT-4:
"The molecule is a sulfonated xanthene dye of absorption wavelength 573 nm and emission wavelength 591 nm. It has a role as a fluorochrome."
- B: Using the following prompt to predict protein-molecule affinity will get a better performance on GPT-4 than asking molT5:
"SMILES: COC1=NC=C(C=C1)COC2=C(C=C(C=C2)CN3C=NC4=C3N=CC(=C4)C5=NN=C(O5)C6CCNCC6)OC, FASTA: MSSWIRWHGPAMARLWGFCWLVVGFWRAAFACPTSCKCSA...TLLQNLAKASPVYLDILG. You need to calculate the binding affinity score."
- C: When given few-shot examples, GPT-4 can produce results almost comparable to existing deep learning models on the Drug-Target Affinity (DTA) task.
- D: GPT-4 demonstrates a solid understanding of key information in evolutionary biology.

# Answer

C
