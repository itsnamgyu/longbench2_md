# Question

Both articles are related to the simulation of snow accumulation, but they differ in their focus and implementation details. Which of the following statements regarding the research and implementation methods of snow simulation in both articles is incorrect?

# Choices

- A: Both articles mention the use of particle simulation for snow and explain the performance challenges associated with this method.
- B: Both articles aim to simulate snow accumulation shapes to represent snow thickness.
- C: The first article simulates snow using factors such as water accumulation and weather, while the second article does not consider natural factors and instead simulates snow from the perspective of object occlusion using shadow buffer techniques.
- D: The first article uses LOD (Level of Detail) algorithms for performance optimization, while the method used in the second article performs better than the traditional ray tracing method.

# Answer

C
