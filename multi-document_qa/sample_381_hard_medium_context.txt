Adoption Amendment Bill 2011* (LC No. 250)  
The Bill amends the Adoption Act 1994. The amendments introduce reforms to update this Act and 
enhance its operation and transparency. The majority of these reforms arose from a legislative review 
of the Adoption Act 1994 tabled in Parliament on 31 May 2007. 
The Bill proposes reforms to the adoption applications committee to require greater independence in 
membership of the committee and increased transparency in its decision-making, including a new 
capacity for merits-based reviews by the CEO and the State Administrative Tribunal (SAT). 
The Bill contains amendments to reintroduce adoption by a relative of a child as currently occurs in 
other Australian jurisdictions. The process for approval of adoption of a child by his or her carer is 
clarified and it is proposed the approval provisions also apply to relatives. 
Other reforms include: removal of the restriction requiring a maximum age differential between a 
child to be placed for adoption and the older applicant of a couple wishing to adopt the child; 
providing siblings with a right of access to identifying information about an adopted biological sibling 
where both are aged 18 years or over; and requiring a greater number of relatives to be contacted in 
cases where a birth parent dies before a relinquished child is adopted. 
The motion for the Second Reading of the Bill in the Legislative Assembly was moved on 
30 November 2011 (P.D.p. 10087). 
The Bill remains on the Legislative Council Notice Paper as at 1 December 2011.
