Secretary’s year 
in review
I continue to be impressed 
by the strength, resilience and 
personal commitment of NSW 
Health staff as they have ensured 
our health system continues to 
deliver healthcare to the people of 
NSW and also protect and 
vaccinate them through the 
COVID-19 pandemic. 
Delivery of health services to the people of NSW has 
remained of utmost importance. As the COVID-19 
pandemic has continued to impact our state, the 
unwavering dedication of NSW Health employees has 
ensured healthcare and health protection have been 
delivered across the whole of the state.
Continuing our COVID-19 response 
In our second year of responding to the pandemic, 
the many teams and services of NSW Health have 
worked together to ensure our system remained 
strong, responsive and resilient. We continued 
to modify our service delivery, including prioritising 
our testing and vaccination services while also 
managing to address delays in elective surgery 
created in 2020 due to the pandemic. 
In 2020-21, we conducted 6.15 million COVID-19 
tests; had more than 2.4 million people register for the 
COVID-19 SMS Results Service; conducted more 
than 500,000 saliva screen tests for hotel quarantine 
workers; and improved testing capabilities by increasing 
operating hours and dedicated health workers at 
testing facilities and laboratories. 
Our digital system to fast-track frontline worker 
vaccinations was made available for public bookings, 
and by mid-2021 was being used by 64 clinics across 
14 local health districts and specialty networks, 
capturing more than 675,000 registrations. 
In parallel, our Vaccination Administration Management 
system was launched to manage the entire vaccination 
administration process for staff and the public. By 
mid-2021 it had been used to book more than 21,000 
appointments and vaccinate 3646 people. 
Working closely with the Australian Government to plan 
and implement a safe and effective COVID-19 vaccination 
program in NSW, health workers administered 851,400 
vaccines from 22 February 2021 to end June 2021. We 
also opened the first mass vaccination centre in NSW at 
Sydney Olympic Park on 10 May 2021. By end June 2021, 
the centre had administered over 278,000 vaccinations. 
The success of the centre along with the need to rapidly 
vaccinate the adult population led to the planning of 
further mass vaccination centres to open in July and 
August 2021 at Belmont, near Newcastle, Macquarie 
Fields in south western Sydney, Wollongong, Qudos 
Bank Arena and a large centre in Sydney’s central 
business district.
Under enacted public health orders, we supported 
the NSW Government operation to facilitate COVID-19 
testing and contact tracing on returned traveller 
transmissions within quarantine facilities. 
Our introduction of the quarantine worker surveillance 
and testing program assisted in the early detection of 
COVID-19 in patient transport workers and staff at 
quarantine facilities. In addition, our collaboration with 
Sydney Water to implement a world-first sewage 
surveillance program has provided further assistance 
in the fight against COVID-19 in the community. 
NSW Health	
Annual Report 2020-21   :  Preface   :  page iv


Throughout the year, we continued to work closely with 
the NSW Multicultural Health Communication Services, 
to ensure the dissemination of COVID-19 vaccination 
information in 57 languages to help increase vaccination 
rates in culturally and linguistically diverse communities. 
A special report further outlining our efforts in response 
to the COVID-19 pandemic is on page vii.
Advancing our priorities
Despite the year’s extraordinary challenges, we have 
made significant advances across all areas, guided 
by the NSW Health Strategic Priorities, which focus 
on eight key areas to improve results for patients and 
the community. Together, we enhanced our focus 
on new and innovative ways of delivering care which 
evolved in response to COVID-19. 
We also supported our workforce whose professional 
agility and inspiring dedication to our patients has been 
central to our success. We continued to refine our 
approach to value based healthcare and its direct link 
with patient experience. 
Our future strategy planning promises to build on the 
success of our strategic priorities to date and this 
year we made significant progress in developing our 
strategy for the next 10 years. We will continue to 
demonstrate our commitment to deliver the best 
healthcare to the citizens of NSW and a sustainable 
health system that delivers outcomes that matter to 
patients, is personalised, invests in wellness and is 
digitally enabled. 
Enhancing the health of NSW citizens 
NSW Health is the lead for three Premier’s Priorities: 
to improve service levels in hospitals, improve outpatient 
and community care, and reduce NSW rates of suicide 
by 20 per cent by 2023. 
Improving service levels in hospitals
Our reporting shows that 100 per cent of all triage 
category 1 in public hospitals commenced treatment on 
time along with 79 per cent and 75 per cent for triage 
category 2 and 3 respectively. 
Meanwhile we also expanded our Patient Experience 
Officer program. There are now 100 Patient Experience 
Officers in 52 emergency departments helping patients 
and their families with an enhanced public hospital 
experience. 
In addition we expanded the GoShare patient education 
tool which provides information in 20 languages to 
support patients and their families to better understand 
the care they will receive. 
Improving outpatient and community care 
Outpatient services are critical to NSW Health’s delivery 
of care across the state. This care is an important and 
ongoing part of a patient’s pathway. 
Reducing preventable visits to hospitals by five per cent 
through to 2023 by caring for people in the community 
remains a focus.
Integrated Care launched the statewide initiative 
Planned Care for Better Health in April to identify people 
at risk of hospitalisation early, strengthen their care 
and avoid hospitalisation. This approach and other 
integrated care initiatives saw the proportion of total 
days spent in hospital by people with conditions where 
hospitalisation is potentially preventable improve by 
1.6 percentage points over the past three years to 
21.4 per cent. These saved visits to hospital contributed 
to a reduction of 200,000 bed days in the first half 
of 2021.
NSW Health established a collaboration with eHealth NSW 
and local health district clinicians to create a statewide 
digital system which ensures general practitioner referrals 
to outpatient clinics are created, delivered and managed 
effectively to improve the patient experience of care, 
whether at a hospital or within the community. 
Towards Zero Suicides 
The Towards Zero Suicides program progressed with 
the expansion of statewide suicide prevention services, 
training and recruitment of counsellors. Highlights 
included the opening of seven SafeHavens which provide 
calm, quiet spaces for people in crisis as an alternative 
to presenting to an emergency department; the launch 
of 12 Suicide Prevention Outreach teams across NSW; 
and the delivery of suicide prevention training for more 
than 3700 community members, 1100 Service NSW staff 
and 475 NSW Health staff.
The NSW Government invested an additional $80 million 
in mental health services as a response to COVID-19, 
including $16.4 million to enhance the Mental Health Line 
which now has the capacity to respond on average to 
18,000 calls per month.
Providing world-class care centred 
around patient experience
Value based healthcare strives to deliver care that 
improves outcomes that matter to patients, the experience 
of receiving care, the experience of providing care, and 
the effectiveness and efficiency of care. This year we 
launched the Commissioning for Better Value Strategy 
2021-2024 to support better patient care and experiences 
by shifting the focus from outputs to outcomes.
NSW Health	
Annual Report 2020-21   :  Preface   :  page v


The launch of Elevating the Human Experience: Our 
guide to action for patient, family, carer volunteer and 
caregiver experiences elevates our ambition to ensure 
patients, families and carers have the best possible 
experience and clinical outcomes when they interact with 
the NSW Health system. We can also be proud that 
almost 18,000 patients who responded to an Emergency 
Department Patient survey were positive about their 
experiences with around 88 per cent rating their 
emergency care as either very good or good. In small, 
rural hospitals, the overwhelming majority (95 per cent) 
of the 4487 patients surveyed about their overall care 
rated their experience as very good or good. 
An inclusive workplace for our people
As the largest public health system in Australia, with 
about 170,000 staff across the state, our workforce 
represents the community we serve. The launch of our 
Diversity Inclusion Belonging Resource Hub welcomes 
people from diverse backgrounds and provides direction 
for NSW Health organisations to meet the diversity 
and inclusion targets set under the Premier’s Priorities. 
Already we have exceeded one of those targets by 
doubling the number of Aboriginal and Torres Strait 
Islander people in senior leadership roles.
Increasing our focus on innovation 
to solve tomorrow’s problems
We have continued to be at the forefront of innovation 
with the ongoing implementation of our large-scale 
Solar Power Program, which to date has helped provide 
20MW of solar power across the network to generate 
cost savings of around $4 million per year. There are now 
solar panel systems either installed or planned for 10 of 
our major hospitals, including John Hunter Hospital in 
Newcastle, which hosts the largest roof-mounted 
hospital solar panel system in the world. The program 
leads NSW Health’s commitment to the state’s goal of 
net zero emissions by 2050.
Enabling a digitally enabled healthcare 
system to meet our patients’ needs
Our staff’s dedication to provide safe and accessible 
care to all patients across NSW has been critical to 
accelerate virtual care during the pandemic. Our goal 
to expand and enhance virtual care capabilities has 
progressed significantly in the last year following 
endorsement of the NSW Virtual Care Strategy. 
The strategy provides a coordinated and consistent 
approach to sustainably scale virtual care, by integrating 
it as an appropriate care delivery option across our 
health services at a local and state level. 
The establishment of our Virtual Care Accelerator, 
a multiagency and clinically focused unit ensuring 
patients have access to the best telehealth-enabled 
models of care and remote monitoring have to offer, 
supported the rapid development and uptake of virtual 
care, first in response to the COVID-19 pandemic, 
and then as part of our long-term strategy to focus 
on digital solutions to improve patient experiences and 
outcomes and enhance our continuum of care to all 
citizens of NSW.
Creating a sustainable health 
system into the future
We have made significant progress on the development 
of our Future Health Strategy, which will guide the 
next decade of care in NSW. Our ability to continue to 
perform well into the future will be underpinned by our 
ability to adapt. Many of the improvements our health 
system needs to address are in fact already underway. 
The strategy will bring together the collective experience 
and wisdom of users of our health services, the people 
who work in our systems, as well as that of our partners 
in providing care. 
I would like to thank all NSW Health employees, and 
in particular our frontline staff who continue to show 
compassion, kindness and empathy while providing 
the best care to the people of NSW every day. In what 
has been another year of challenges, I feel privileged 
to lead such committed people across NSW Health.
And, to Health Minister Brad Hazzard, thank you for your 
unwavering support and leadership in what has been an 
incredibly busy year for the health system.

Throughout 2020-21, NSW 
Health’s COVID-19 pandemic 
response evolved and adapted 
as several infection outbreaks 
developed in Sydney and some 
regional areas of the state. 
We completed 6.15 million 
COVID-19 tests to the end 
of June 2021 and started a 
mammoth vaccination rollout 
following the launch of our 
first mass vaccination centre 
in May 2021.
As we responded to the challenges of COVID-19, we also 
optimised our close relationships with culturally diverse 
and at-risk communities at a local health district level, 
engaging with community leaders to further increase 
awareness of the risks of infection, encouraging testing 
and highlighting the benefits of vaccination. 
Throughout the year, our committed and highly skilled 
staff have worked to solve the many complex challenges 
that COVID-19 has presented to all areas of NSW Health 
and they deserve full credit for their dedication.
An ongoing 
pandemic
COVID-19 response by numbers
The pandemic stretched the NSW healthcare system 
but our staff across the state were there to listen and 
respond to the community’s needs and develop 
innovative solutions.
Each part of NSW Health worked collectively to provide 
care as it was needed and this year’s statistics speak 
volumes to the breadth and depth of work undertaken. 
Throughout the year there were: 
•	2473 COVID-19 cases to the end of June 2021, 
including 1387 acquired overseas and 1086 acquired 
in NSW or interstate
•	6.15 million COVID-19 tests completed at over 
350 testing clinics
•	503,478 saliva screen tests for hotel quarantine 
workers
•	2,475,199 people registered for the COVID-19 SMS 
results service which saved 423,000 hours in calls
•	851,400 vaccinations administered by NSW Health 
between 22 February and end June 2021
•	704,352 individual meals provided to returning 
travellers in quarantine 
•	more than 600 close contact tracers trained 
to meet demand
•	$80 million in funding announced to enhance mental 
health services during the pandemic
•	over 1500 resources created in more than 60 languages
•	over 18,000 calls received a month to the Mental 
Health Line.
NSW Health	
Annual Report 2020-21   :  Preface   :  page vii


When overseas travellers were returning to Australia, 
NSW Health was among the first agencies to look 
after them. As part of the response, a range of care 
was provided, with NSW Health responsible for meals, 
check-ins and transport. As a result:
•	1905 travellers were transported from the airport to 
hotel quarantine
•	an additional 287 travellers were taken from the airport 
to hospital for treatment 
•	3093 patients were moved between quarantine hotels 
due to their changing COVID-19 status
•	467 weekly audits of quarantine hotels were completed 
since January 2021
•	842 people who were unable to isolate at home were 
provided care in hotel quarantine.
Patient experience remained a priority, even when 
face-to-face contact was not possible. Innovative 
solutions to keep patients, their families and clinicians 
connected included:
•	30,105 telehealth consultations via myVirtualCare 
with 3128 clinicians connected and over 60 resources 
developed to support its uptake by patients
•	1800 iPads distributed statewide so patients could 
communicate with family members while receiving care 
for COVID-19 when they were unable to have visitors.
Educators, researchers and trainers used their skills 
to expand NSW Health staff’s knowledge and 
understanding of COVID-19, generating new ideas and 
local solutions to what they encountered during the 
pandemic.
Training, education and research during COVID-19 has 
been an important part of the work NSW Health has 
delivered. In 2020-21:
•	more than $28 million was invested into COVID-19 
research including $4.5 million on emergency priority 
research projects for urgent investigation of 
transmission in schools and aged care facilities, and 
$8 million towards 17 research projects 
•	almost 100 guidance documents and local solutions 
were created by more than 3500 clinicians as part 
of the 30 clinical Communities of Practice
•	more than 650 Intensive Care Paramedics were 
educated through a COVID-19 update program.
Getting health messages out quickly to the community 
has been a crucial part of NSW Health’s response to 
COVID-19 to help stop the spread. In particular, digital 
communications have grown, including:
•	1.5 million webpage views and more than 250,000 
downloads of COVID-19 resources on the NSW Health 
website, including content in community languages
•	400 integrated data dashboards produced by the 
Critical Intelligence Unit, 250 daily digests of academic 
literature, 100 topic-specific evidence checks and 
50 weekly reports on risk levels and international data.
Our mental health response
The NSW Government provided funding for a 
strengthened package of services specifically to support 
the mental health and wellbeing of NSW residents 
impacted by public health orders and other measures 
to ensure their safety during the pandemic.
Initiatives included in the NSW Government’s $80 million 
mental health support package:
•	recruitment of additional specialist community mental 
health clinicians and peer support staff working with 
vulnerable populations
•	virtual mental health services expanded to connect 
clinical settings to assess and treat mental health 
clients remotely. This allowed mental health clinicians 
to connect with individual mental health consumers 
in a community setting and the extension helped link 
them with clinical information and resources
•	funding to Lifeline and the Mental Health Line to ensure 
these vital services were equipped to respond to the 
increased needs of the community.
Vulnerable populations
Funding was granted in late 2020 to local health districts 
based on both need and demographics for Assertive 
Community Care to help focus on providing care in the 
community rather than in hospital. This followed the 
program’s success in deploying 180 additional specialists, 
community-based mental health clinicians and peer 
support workers.
These health professionals worked in a range of clinical 
areas including Child and Adolescent Mental Health 
Services, Intellectual Disability, Forensic Mental Health, 
Aboriginal Mental Health, and Older Persons Mental 
Health. More than $66 million in funding will be invested 
over three years, beginning in 2021-22.
This funding will allow for additional mental health 
clinicians to care for patients in the community which 
will significantly enhance the capacity of services 
across the state. 
NSW Health	
Annual Report 2020-21   :  Preface   :  page viii


Virtual mental health
Remote technology remains one way our clinicians can 
remain connected with their patients when face-to-face 
services are limited. As a result, renewed funding was 
announced which will allow local health districts to 
enhance their equipment and increase staffing to meet 
patient needs.
More than $50 million in funding was announced over 
three years beginning in 2021-22 to provide technology 
and expand telehealth services. This boost enables more 
access to mental health support for people in immediate 
crisis in metropolitan and regional NSW. 
Mental Health Line
NSW Health services have responded to over 18,000 
calls a month this year and funding for the Mental Health 
Line will continue. Despite receiving these high call 
numbers, performance improved significantly.
New facilities and services 
Increasing surveillance at a population level
NSW Health began using sewage surveillance as a 
critical response tool to ensure new COVID-19 cases and 
outbreaks were quickly identified. This award-winning 
collaboration with Sydney Water began in mid-2020 in 
regional NSW. Throughout 2020-21, sewage surveillance 
expanded, covering more than 80 per cent of the NSW 
population as part of a regular reporting mechanism.
The world-first research program has achieved global 
significance, testing untreated sewage for fragments 
of SARS-CoV-2 virus at more than 60 sewage treatment 
plants across NSW.
The program has provided critical intelligence to 
understand COVID-19 in communities, inform the public 
health response and build preparedness for future 
disease outbreaks, along with helping to keep NSW safe 
during the pandemic.
NSW Health funded the sampling of materials, courier 
costs, analysis and research on sequencing, variants of 
concern and more efficient sample collection methods.
Ramping up the vaccine rollout
Vaccinations were first offered to priority groups as 
determined by the Australian Government, including staff 
from healthcare, emergency services, quarantine, border 
workers and their households. Bookings were then 
opened to administer vaccines to the public as the 
population eligible for vaccination in the rollout expanded.
The first NSW mass vaccination centre opened in May 
2021 at Sydney Olympic Park, with initial capacity to 
administer up to 5000 vaccines a day.
The centre initially operated six days per week, from 
8am to 8pm, with the outstanding 300-person workforce 
at Sydney Olympic Park making the vaccine ramp-up 
possible, including 200 registered nurses and midwives.
Due to the success of the centre, planning efforts 
continued to open further mass vaccination centres 
in July and August 2021.

Delivering COVID-19 test results
NSW undertook record levels of testing in 2020-21 with 
6.15 million COVID-19 completed tests in the reporting 
period. NSW Health Pathology launched a secure SMS 
service to deliver COVID-19 test results to people who 
were tested in NSW public hospitals or COVID-19 clinics. 
Over 2.4 million people registered for the service, which 
halved the average waiting time for negative results and 
saved frontline healthcare workers 423,000 hours in 
calls. The service was the joint winner of the 2020 NSW 
Premier’s Putting the Customer at the Centre Award 
and was acknowledged by Harvard Business Review.
Scaling up our workforce to meet case surges
The Health Education and Training Institute (HETI) 
trained more than 600 close contact tracers, after 
designing and delivering a rolling program of rapid online 
training in readiness for infection rate surges. The 
innovative training program was a collaboration between 
HETI and the Centre for Population Health and was 
recognised as a finalist in the Recovery and Resilience 
category of the 2020 Premier’s Awards.
Video recordings of the virtual training have been 
made available to Public Health Unit teams across local 
health districts and have been shared with Victoria’s 
Department of Health and Human Services to support 
essential training for its close contact tracers.
Digitalising care
The Agency for Clinical Innovation, in partnership 
with eHealth NSW, implemented myVirtualCare 
statewide in September 2020, creating more accessible 
healthcare during the pandemic.
MyVirtualCare is a custom-built, web-based 
videoconferencing platform that helps patients, 
healthcare providers and carers to access and manage 
care. The platform extends clinicians’ virtual capability, 
providing enhanced functionality that mimics critical 
workflow.
Uptake of the platform has been significant, with the 
statewide rollout connecting 3148 clinicians and more 
than 30,000 consultations.
For patients, their families and carers, myVirtualCare 
provided a seamless and convenient way to access their 
clinical and social care providers using one web link 
on any internet-enabled device, reducing the need 
for patients to travel to healthcare services. Patients 
receiving care for cancer, palliative, nutrition and 
dietetics, pain, mental health and speech and 
rehabilitation services were among the participants.
Breaking records in our efforts 
to recover elective surgeries
NSW Health has remained focused on fast-tracking 
surgeries delayed following the National Cabinet decision 
to suspend all non-urgent and most semi-urgent surgery 
in 2020, due to the pandemic.
Public hospitals throughout NSW hit milestones in 
2020-21, in an effort to recover surgeries and provide the 
best possible healthcare to the residents of NSW. 
An investment of an additional $458.5 million by the 
NSW Government sped up access to surgery for patients 
who had their surgery delayed. This was made possible 
through increased collaboration between public 
hospitals and private providers.
In the July to September 2020 quarter, more elective 
surgeries were performed than in any other quarter in the 
last five years, with almost 100 per cent of urgent surgery 
performed on time and almost 65,000 elective surgeries 
performed. This is an increase of 2581 (4.0 per cent) 
when compared with the same quarter in 2019. The 
public waiting list reduced to 95,000 at the end of the 
September, compared with 101,000 at the end of the 
previous quarter.
In the October to December 2020 quarter, 62,000 
procedures were recorded, the highest number of 
elective surgeries ever performed in an October to 
December quarter, and an almost eight per cent increase 
compared with the same period in 2019.
In the January to March 2021 quarter, NSW Health achieved 
another milestone, a five-year performance record in the 
number of elective surgeries performed in any first 
quarter with 58,044 procedures, an increase of 7065 
(13.9 per cent) compared with the same quarter in 2020, 
and 99.6 per cent of urgent elective surgeries were 
performed on time.
In the April to June 2021 quarter, 64,599 elective 
surgeries were performed, representing an increase of 
5330 (nine per cent) compared with the same quarter in 
2019 and the highest number ever recorded in an April to 
June quarter. In partnership with private hospitals, NSW 
Health also reduced the number of people on the elective 
surgery waiting list at the end of the quarter by over 
15 per cent, from 101,024 a year earlier to 85,296 at the 
end of June 2021. Of those people, 2108 had waited 
longer than the clinically recommended timeframe, down 
from 10,563 at the end of June 2020.

On the ground – local health districts 
and networks
Improving COVID-19 testing at 
Northern NSW Local Health District 
Clinics in Northern NSW introduced a new process 
involving personalised Quick Response (QR) codes, 
supporting patients to register faster for COVID-19 test 
results through a simple scan on a smartphone.
A project team involving NSW Health Pathology, eHealth 
NSW and Clinical Information System teams from 
Northern NSW Local Health District worked for months 
to develop the localised technology and systems to 
support the improved registration method.
Four hospital testing clinics in the local health district 
rolled out the QR process in February 2021, reducing 
both the time taken for a patient to register for the SMS 
result notification, and the possibility of data being 
incorrect or mismatched. It also simplified the 
registration process, offering a one-step scan, rather 
than patients having to enter multiple pieces of 
information over a series of text messages.
For culturally or linguistically diverse patients, the 
QR codes also helped to reduce barriers when 
registering to receive their results via SMS.
Supporting our most vulnerable 
at St Vincent’s Health Network 
St Vincent’s Health Network in collaboration with the 
City of Sydney, St Vincent de Paul Society and other 
frontline non-government organisations established a 
vaccination clinic for people experiencing homelessness, 
at risk of homelessness or living in social housing in 
Woolloomooloo.
The clinic opened in May 2021 to provide equitable 
access to COVID-19 vaccinations without bookings 
and administered more than 1000 vaccinations to the 
end of June 2021.
Engaging with communities
The Centre for Aboriginal Health supported the 
Aboriginal Community Controlled Health Services to 
deliver tailored COVID-19 communications for Aboriginal 
and Torres Strait Islander populations, including leading 
the ‘Keep Our Mob Safe’ campaign, messaging on 
COVID-safe behaviour, restrictions and vaccinations.
Communicating with culturally and linguistically diverse 
communities became even more important in 2020-21. 
The NSW Multicultural Health Communication Service 
provided a range of content including social media, 
videos, fact sheets and multicultural media coverage to 
connect with the state’s diverse communities.
Pandemic health messages were translated into more 
than 50 languages on the website and NSW Health 
worked with multicultural and religious leaders to share 
information and encourage vaccination. 
In addition, frontline healthcare staff working in south-
western Sydney, one of Australia’s most multiculturally 
diverse communities, shared their own language skills in 
an area where 51 per cent of residents speak a language 
other than English at home and more than 44 per cent of 
the population was born overseas. To connect with the 
local community in their own languages and answer 
questions about COVID-19, South Western Sydney Local 
Health District’s multicultural nurses and health workers 
spoke in Vietnamese, Arabic, Hindi and Assyrian at local 
shopping centres.

in response to the pandemic
All parts of NSW Health had a role to play, working 
collaboratively to provide a comprehensive and multi-
pronged approach to the crisis.
Personal protective equipment – HealthShare NSW 
maintained the supply to COVID-19 clinics, airports, 
quarantine hotels and hospitals; and meals, transport 
and linen for returned travellers in hotel quarantine.
Research funding – the Office for Health and Medical 
Research invested $28 million to generate research 
evidence to support the COVID-19 pandemic response.
System and clinical intelligence – the Critical 
Intelligence Unit provided rapid, evidence-based advice 
to inform and support critical decision making. The unit 
focused on systems intelligence, clinical intelligence, and 
evidence integration.
Health data – the Centre for Epidemiology and Evidence 
provided daily case, testing and vaccination data to the 
health system and public.
Health and Social Policy – collaborated with the 
Australian Government Department of Health and the 
Aged Care Quality and Safety Commission to develop 
and update the protocol to support joint management 
of a COVID-19 outbreak in one or more residential aged 
care facilities in NSW.
Strategic Reform and Planning – continued to 
implement strategies to reduce the impact of COVID-19 in 
the community through clinician engagement and 
Communities of Practice.
System Information and Analytics – produced analytical 
tools to model the impact of COVID-19 on intensive care 
units demand and communal disease transmission, and 
the NSW Vaccination Program.
System management – the State Health Emergency 
Operations Centre led the implementation of strategies 
to reduce the impact of COVID-19, including increasing 
intensive care unit capacity, managing and distributing 
medical equipment such as ventilators, supporting the 
operation of COVID-19 testing clinics, the NSW Hotel 
Quarantine and Airport Program in collaboration with 
other NSW Government agencies and establishing a 
large network of over 100 vaccination clinics, including 
mobile outreach locations, across the state.
Workforce Planning and Talent Development – 
expanded the Workplace Culture and Safety Action Plan 
to include a range of COVID-19-specific wellbeing 
initiatives to greater support NSW Health staff.
Workplace Relations – provided work health and safety 
advice and established a dedicated enquiries team to 
manage issues arising from the pandemic, including 
safety and wellbeing considerations.
Infection prevention and control – the Clinical 
Excellence Commission developed resources and 
supported the NSW Hotel Quarantine and Airport 
Program Quality Assurance Program.
Enhanced training – NSW Ambulance staff were 
provided with training and protocols to ensure patient 
safety while maintaining clinical quality.
Financial Services and Asset Management – provided 
a range of key support functions including administering 
additional funding for COVID-19 response and related

Overview


The NSW public health system 
is world class, providing high-
quality, safe healthcare to the 
people of NSW.
It is the biggest and busiest public health system in 
Australia, with 228 public hospitals and 170,000 (127,156 
full-time equivalent) dedicated staff who are supported 
to deliver the very best care to our patients, consumers 
and clients. The health system impacts every NSW 
citizen, from care in hospitals to care in our community, 
and provides the full spectrum of physical and mental 
health care. 
Each year, NSW Health cares for millions of residents 
across the state, leads innovative clinical research, 
supports community health and health promotion, and 
manages a portfolio of health capital works investments 
to total $10.8 billion over the four years to 2024-2025.
Our vision	
Our vision is for a sustainable health system that delivers 
outcomes that matter to patients, is personalised, invests 
in wellness and is digitally enabled.
Our purpose
We plan for the provision of comprehensive, balanced and 
coordinated health services to promote, protect, develop, 
maintain and improve the health and wellbeing of the 
people of NSW. (Source: Health Administration Act 1982 
No 135, section 5.)
Our values
Our CORE values encourage collaboration, openness

building confidence and increasing cooperation. We are 
committed to encouraging our patients and all staff 
members in the health system to provide feedback that 
will help us provide better services.
Respect
We respect the abilities, knowledge, skills and achievements 
of everyone who works in the health system. We are also 
committed to providing health services that acknowledge 
and respect the feelings, wishes and rights of our patients 
and their carers.

Our Strategic Priorities
Our Strategic Priorities are guided by the 
NSW Government key policy priorities, and 
the Premier’s Priorities. 
The NSW Government has 
five key policy priorities: 
• A strong economy 
• Highest quality education
• Well-connected communities with quality local 
environments 
• Putting the consumer at the centre of everything 
we do 
• Breaking the cycle of disadvantage. 
Three Premier’s Priorities aim to enhance the 
care and services we provide to NSW citizens. 
These priorities are: 
• Improving service levels in hospitals — 100 per cent of all 
triage category 1, 95 per cent of triage category 2 and 85 
per cent of triage category 3 patients commencing 
treatment on time by 2023 
• Improving outpatient and community care — Reduce 
preventable visits to hospitals by five per cent through to 
2023 by caring for people in the community 
• Towards Zero Suicides — Reduce the rate of suicide 
deaths in NSW by 20 per cent by 2023. 
Our Strategic Priorities focus on eight areas to improve 
results for patients and the community and outline 
how we work together to achieve our core objectives. 
Our priorities build on, and complement, the State Health 
Plan: Towards 2021.
Our Strategic Priorities provide the health system and 
our stakeholders with a meaningful overview of our target 
outcomes for the year. Our work to continue building a 
21st century health system that is sustainable, purposeful, 
and most importantly delivers the best care for the people 
of NSW is contained in these eight priorities. They also 
present the framework for change, shaping what we 
need to achieve in our hospitals, for our workforce, and 
in research and innovation, eHealth and infrastructure. 
Our Strategic Priorities are 
divided into three key directions: 
• keep people healthy 
• provide world-class clinical care where patient 
safety is first 
• integrate systems to deliver truly connected care. 
And five major strategies to support 
these directions:
• develop and support our people, culture and governance
• support and harness health and medical research 
and innovation 
• embed a digitally enabled healthcare system 
• plan and deliver future-focused service models and 
infrastructure
• build financial sustainability and deliver business 
improvements.
Section 2 of this report outlines our key achievements 
for 2020-21 against each of our Strategic Priorities.
Health system challenges
Australia’s healthcare system is recognised as one of the 
most effective in the world. The NSW public health system 
is a critical part of this. But like health systems throughout 
the world, NSW Health must prepare to manage future 
challenges. These include: 
• an ageing population using services more frequently 
• a changing disease burden, from acute care to chronic 
and complex conditions that require more dynamic 
management. 
To respond to these challenges, we are moving from 
volume based to value based healthcare, a whole-of-
system reform that challenges us to better understand 
and measure what matters to patients and the community. 
In NSW, value based healthcare means continually 
striving to deliver care that improves: 
• health outcomes that matter to patients and the 
community 
• experiences of receiving care 
• experiences of providing care 
• effectiveness and efficiency of care.
This year, we faced additional challenges of the ongoing 
COVID-19 pandemic, extreme rainfall and floods, and 
a mice plague, all of which impacted on the physical 
and mental health of NSW citizens, and which required 
a robust and comprehensive response from the NSW 
health system.
We responded through our emergency operating 
structures to coordinate our emergency response, 
as detailed on page vii.

of the chief executive is set out in section 24 of the Health 
Services Act. 
The chief executive manages and controls the affairs 
of the local health district. The chief executive can commit 
the district contractually and legally, and is the employer 
delegate for all staff working in the organisation. Chief 
executives are, in the exercise of their functions, 
accountable to their board.
Statutory health corporations
Under section 51 of the Health Services Act, the chief 
executive manages the affairs of a board-governed 
statutory health corporation and is, in the exercise of his 
or her functions, subject to the direction and control of the 
organisation’s board. As with local health districts and 
specialty health networks the chief executive is also the 
employer delegate for staff working at the organisation.

Performance


Priority 1 
Keep people 
healthy
NSW Health continued efforts 
to provide health services to 
keep NSW residents safe in a 
challenging year characterised 
by the continuing COVID-19 
pandemic. The NSW Health 
vaccination rollout began on 
22 February 2021 and 851,400 
vaccinations had been 
administered at the end 
of June 2021.
We also continued to tackle major health issues affecting 
our community, from supporting pregnancy and the first 
2000 days of life, to improving the health of children and 
Aboriginal people. Our goal is to keep our community 
healthy by delivering public health programs, campaigns 
and initiatives to prevent disease, reduce injuries and 
encourage healthier choices. Reducing harms from 
tobacco, alcohol and other drug use remained a priority.
Our priorities 
1.1	 
Implement policy and programs to reduce 
childhood overweight and obesity
1.2	
Embed a health system response to alcohol, 
tobacco and other drug use and work across 
agencies 
1.3	
Reduce the impact of infectious diseases, 
including COVID-19, and environmental 
health factors, including natural disasters, 
on community wellbeing
1.4	
Embed Aboriginal social and cultural concepts 
of health and wellbeing in programs and 
services 
1.5	
Support pregnancy and families to ensure 
that all children have the best possible start 
in life
Key achievements
•	In 2020-21, NSW Health Pathology conducted over 
3 million COVID-19 diagnostic tests with a median time 
of 18 hours from collection to results and performed 
more than 500,000 saliva screening tests for hotel 
quarantine workers.
•	The Centre for Aboriginal Health led the successful 
community-driven ‘Keep Our Mob Safe’ campaign 
throughout the pandemic, evolving to become the 
NSW Aboriginal COVID-19 Communication and 
Engagement Strategy.
•	Offered access to free in-school dental care to 
121,701 primary school students across 290 schools, 
reaching 89 per cent of the 136,000 children targeted 
for the year. A total of 18,487 students received dental 
treatment, with first-time patients accounting for 
78 per cent of patients treated. 
•	Improved access to IVF services with $42 million 
invested by the NSW Government in testing rebates 
and key NSW Health IVF hospital clinics. This included 
NSW Health’s first statewide fertility preservation 
service for cancer patients at the Royal Hospital 
for Women, which had administered treatment to 
168 cancer patients by 30 June 2021.
•	NSW Health and the NSW Department of Education 
developed ‘Respect Your Brain’ – a series of three 
animated videos to inform young people of the impact 
of alcohol, MDMA and cannabis use on the growing 
brain. With promotion across NSW Health, local libraries 
and high schools, the videos have had more than 
21,000 views. 
Keeping people healthy 
during emergencies
In 2020-21, our response to the COVID-19 pandemic took 
precedence as we mobilised our clinicians and support 
staff to contend with the increased demand on our health 
system. The State Health Emergency Operations Centre 
(SHEOC) and the Public Health Response Branch have 
coordinated the statewide response to COVID-19, working 
closely with local health districts, specialty networks and 
other NSW Health organisations. 
SHEOC also led the rollout of COVID-19 vaccines and 
provided governance for the NSW quarantine program, 
working with other stakeholders to minimise the risk of 
COVID-19 transmission from travellers to NSW. 
The Public Health Response Branch coordinated the 
statewide health protection network’s case finding, 
outbreak investigation, public health risk assessment, 
contact tracing, investigation of adverse events following 
COVID-19 immunisation and world-class epidemiological 
analysis and reporting. 
NSW Health	
Annual Report 2020-21   :  Performance   :  page 14


Importantly, we purchased additional ventilators and 
medical equipment to support increased intensive care 
unit capacity in readiness for COVID-19 infection 
outbreaks. We also coordinated free testing to the NSW 
community, implementing innovative models and ensuring 
access for all. As at June 2021, over 350 testing clinics 
across NSW were operational and had conducted 6.15 
million tests. 
With support from Sydney Local Health District, 
the Clinical Excellence Commission completed 
467 weekly audits of quarantine hotels in NSW since 
January 2021. It also developed and led a statewide 
Respiratory Protection Program, with over 38,000 
health workers participating. 
More than 3500 clinicians joined 30 clinical Communities 
of Practice to publish almost 100 guidance documents 
and develop local solutions for the COVID-19 response, 
resulting in more than 430,000 webpage views by over 
255,000 users. We provided rapid, evidence-based advice 
on COVID-19 and published the weekly Risk Monitoring 
Dashboard, assessing transmission risk in healthcare 
settings. NSW Health also commenced the NSW Sewage 
Surveillance Program for COVID-19, which played a key 
role in keeping regional NSW safe. Critical intelligence to 
understand COVID-19 in the community helped inform the 
public health response throughout the year by providing 
an early warning of undiagnosed cases or an increase in 
infections in the community, and enabled NSW Health to 
identify areas to target increased community testing. 
Developing data collections, analysis and 
reporting on community wellbeing
Analytical tools were produced by the System Information 
and Analytics Branch to model the impact of COVID-19 
on intensive care unit demand and disease transmission 
in the community. Weekly reports relating to the NSW 
Vaccination Program were also generated using combined 
NSW data with data provided by the Commonwealth to 
support the planning and delivery of vaccine administration. 
This includes dynamic forecasting based on weekly 
updates, supporting the initial short-term healthcare 
capacity to meet expected surge and the long-term 
response to COVID-19.
Supporting mental health during COVID-19
As part of the NSW Government’s $80 million investment 
to strengthen mental health support in response to 
COVID-19, local health districts and specialty health 
networks recruited over 200 mental health clinicians 
and peer support workers. A total of $16.4 million went to 
enhance the capacity and responsiveness of the Mental 
Health Line, where NSW Health services responded to 
over 18,000 calls a month. 
An additional $20 million was invested in expansion of 
virtual mental health services, over $6 million was invested 
in inpatient mental health units and $6 million was 
invested to support first responders, including police and 
ambulance, to respond to people experiencing mental 
distress in the community.
Keeping kids healthy
NSW Health simplified consumer access to programs, 
services and information. It continued to work with 
clinical services to embed routine measurement of 
children’s height and weight into practice to drive 
outcomes, with referrals to support services for 
families with children above a healthy weight. 
Targeted social media campaigns resulted in a 
69 per cent increase in engagement and reached 
over 5 million people (an increase of 181 per cent) 
to support the adoption of Healthy Eating and 
Active Living behaviours compared with performance 
in the previous financial year.
The NSW Health and Department of Education 
established a joint ‘Supporting Student Health and 
Wellbeing Memorandum of Understanding’ and annual 
work plan to maintain and strengthen student mental and 
physical health and wellbeing. This increased healthy food 
and drink choices in school canteens, with 95 per cent of 
NSW Government school canteens now meeting the 
Healthy School Canteen Strategy.
Saving the date to vaccinate
The 2020-21 ‘Save The Date To Vaccinate’ childhood 
vaccination campaign was successful in delivering the key 
message around the importance of on-time vaccination to 
the target audiences of parents and carers of children 
aged up to five years old and pregnant women. The 
refreshed creative was delivered through digital and social 
channels including a content partnership with MamaMia 
and Kidspot. In 2020-21, 97.7 per cent of Aboriginal 
children and 94.8 per cent of non-Aboriginal children were 
fully immunised at five years of age.
Keeping people healthy 
by reducing tobacco use 
NSW Health worked with the Department of Education 
and Cancer Institute NSW to enhance public education 
around the health risks of e-cigarette and tobacco use. 
To reduce the impact of e-cigarettes on young people, 
the Centre for Population Health enhanced compliance 
and enforcement activities for liquid nicotine offences 
and other e-cigarette retailing laws. NSW Health 
inspectors seized 80,000 e-cigarettes and e-liquids 
containing nicotine, 490,000 cigarettes and 180 kg 
of other illegal tobacco in 2020-21. 
NSW Health	
Annual Report 2020-21   :  Performance   :  page 15


Supporting our citizens to quit smoking
The Cancer Institute NSW delivered the tobacco control 
awareness campaign ‘You Quit, You Win’ across multiple 
digital and social media channels from December 2020 to 
June 2021, resulting in 36.8 per cent of smokers seeking help 
to quit smoking. Between 1 July 2020 and 30 June 2021, there 
were over 5800 inbound calls to and 9250 outbound calls 
from NSW Quitline. During the same time period, there were 
703,218 sessions on iCanQuit and 5288 people joined online.
The Cancer Institute NSW collaborated with the Aboriginal 
Health and Medical Research Council to develop a Reporting 
for Better Cancer Outcomes program report highlighting the 
impact of cancers on Aboriginal communities. The Institute 
also partnered to distribute funding for nicotine 
replacement therapy and promoted smoking cessation 
through Koori Quitline social media channels.
Reducing alcohol and other 
drug use harms
NSW Health has a number of programs aimed at helping 
consumers achieve better health outcomes in relation to 
the use of alcohol and other drugs. 
A collaboration between NSW Health organisations, NSW 
Poisons Information Centre and NSW Police increased 
intelligence on emerging drug risks. This resulted in eight 
public drug warnings and five clinical safety notices 
issued. These provide information to the public and 
clinicians about health risks, early recognition, how to seek 
help, management and notification. Key detections include 
potent opioids in heroin and cocaine and circulating 
counterfeit alprazolam. 
The Agency for Clinical Innovation’s Drug and Alcohol 
Network launched the Alcohol and Drugs Cognitive 
Enhancement program, aimed at improving brain function 
for better alcohol and drug treatment outcomes. 
In December 2020, we launched the Strategic Prioritisation 
Framework for Alcohol and Other Drugs Research and 
Evaluation 2020-2024. All four of its objectives were 
achieved by June 2021 and research and evaluation 
projects aligned with the framework were initiated. For 
example, the framework is directing analysis of an alcohol 
and other drug public health register by the University of 
New South Wales and the University of Sydney to answer 
policy questions around mortality, service gaps and 
consumer treatment journeys. These projects will drive 
innovation and improve health outcomes for people 
experiencing alcohol and other drug-related harms.
Responding to substance 
use in pregnancy
Substance Use in Pregnancy and Parenting Services 
continued to provide coordinated multidisciplinary care 
to pregnant women who used alcohol and other drugs, 
from the antenatal period to up to two years post-delivery. 
The services aimed to improve health and social outcomes 
for women and their families, and more than 600 women 
were accepted as clients throughout the year. 
Opioid Treatment and 
Take Home Naloxone programs
The successful NSW Opioid Treatment Program continued 
to support the use of the long-acting injectable (depot) 
formulation of buprenorphine. In 2021, NSW Health began 
working with general practitioners and pharmacists to 
expand its use in primary care and private sector settings. 
About 23,000 patients received opioid treatment in 
both public and private healthcare and an estimated 
14 per cent received depot buprenorphine throughout 
the year. In the public opioid treatment setting 
(including in custody), it was about 30 per cent. 
Opioids are responsible for over three deaths in Australia 
per day, according to the Australian Bureau of Statistics. 
Prescribed opioids account for 70 per cent of opioid-
induced deaths either by accident or through misuse. 
Naloxone provides a significant opportunity to save lives 
because opioid overdoses tend to happen gradually, rather 
than suddenly. However, it is possible to prevent death by 
administering naloxone to reverse the effects of the 
overdose. Public health and non-government services 
across NSW supplied more than 4000 units of naloxone 
free of charge to people at risk of experiencing or 
witnessing an opioid overdose. 
The Take Home Naloxone program was scaled up during 
2020-21. More than 900 health workers across all local 
health districts, the Justice Health and Forensic Mental 
Health Network and the Medically Supervised Injecting 
Centre have been trained to supply take home naloxone. 
In 2021, NSW Health also enabled 44 non-government 
health and welfare services across NSW to begin 
supplying naloxone to their clients. 
Keeping people healthy by reducing 
the impact of infectious diseases
NSW Health continued to make progress towards the 
elimination of HIV transmission in NSW, with 33 per cent 
fewer residents diagnosed than the previous five-year 
average. The 2021-2025 HIV Strategy was launched, focusing 
on preventing HIV transmission in priority populations and 
settings, and reducing stigma and discrimination for those 
living with and at risk of acquiring HIV.
NSW Health	
Annual Report 2020-21   :  Performance   :  page 16


The elimination of hepatitis C as a public health concern 
by 2028 remains a priority. NSW Health and partners 
continued to focus on increasing access to testing 
and curative treatment for vulnerable populations.
Keeping people healthy 
during natural disasters
Following the summer bushfires of 2019-20, several 
inquiries were initiated to better plan, prepare for and 
respond to bushfires in the future. The Environmental 
Health Branch (within Health Protection NSW) coordinated 
the NSW Government response to the report of the 
Legislative Council, Health Impacts of Exposure to Poor 
Levels of Air Quality Resulting from Bushfires and Drought. 
The 10 recommendations included developing nationally 
consistent air quality reporting, and reviewing the 
effectiveness of the air quality and health information 
provided to the public. 
NSW Health made significant contributions to 
the development of nationally consistent public 
health messaging for different levels of air pollution 
(including bushfire smoke). The Australian Health 
Protection Principal Committee has endorsed 
PM2.5 and PM10 air quality categories and 
associated health messages. 
NSW Health is also supporting the Department of 
Planning, Industry and Environment in review of the 
effectiveness of air quality and health information 
provided to the public. The findings of the review 
will guide decisions about an air smart public 
education campaign.
The Royal Commission into National Natural Disaster 
Arrangements was established on 20 February 2020 
in response to the extreme bushfire season of 2019-20. 
The Commission examined the coordination, preparedness 
for, response to and recovery from disasters as well as 
improving resilience and adapting to changing climatic 
conditions and mitigating the impact of natural disasters.
The State Preparedness and Response Branch 
coordinated the NSW Health contribution to Notice 
to Give Information received by the State of NSW that 
was submitted to the Commission on 25 June 2020. 
NSW Health provided input into relevant areas related 
to air quality information, the integration of primary care 
into disaster management, Australian Medical Assistance 
Teams capabilities and the mental health impacts of 
natural disasters. 
The Mental Health Branch worked closely with Resilience 
NSW in its evaluation of the Bushfire Recovery Program. 
It was represented on the Steering Committee for 
the National Disaster Framework. 
The framework advanced the Royal Commission 
Recommendation 15.3, which sought revised cross-
jurisdictional arrangements to support localised planning 
for response and recovery. The Mental Health Branch will 
support Commonwealth-led actions to progress 
implementation of the framework and actions in response 
to the Royal Commission.
In March 2021, NSW experienced severe weather 
that generated heavy rain and flooding impacting the 
North Coast, Hunter, Nepean and Hawkesbury areas. 
NSW Health provided additional healthcare to support 
communities that were isolated, or at risk of flooding, 
as part of the state’s emergency response.
NSW Health worked with emergency services and other 
government agencies to ensure residents were safe and 
able to access required health services. Arrangements 
were put in place for vulnerable patients affected by 
floodwaters. A specialist Medical Assistance Team was 
deployed to North Richmond for five days to provide 
emergency care for the communities isolated by several 
major road closures. 
NSW Health staff including nurses, mental health support 
staff, pharmacists and public health staff were deployed 
to support the community in evacuation centres that were 
established in the Mid North Coast and Upper Hunter 
regions. NSW Health also supported an evacuation 
centre at Castle Hill established for residents 
evacuated from the Hawkesbury-Nepean Valley area.
The NSW Government committed $36.4 million over 
four years for mental health Response and Recovery 
Specialists across regional and rural areas in 2021. 
This included farmgate counsellors and drought peer 
support workers, and 30 Disaster Recovery Clinicians 
who worked closely with primary health networks, 
community and welfare agencies and mental health 
services. These roles have been broadened to reflect 
the range of issues impacting disaster-affected areas in 
2020-21, including bushfires, floods and the mice plague.
Delivering culturally safe 
and tailored health services
NSW Health continued to work closely with the Aboriginal 
Health and Medical Research Council to progress actions 
that support the Aboriginal Community Controlled sector 
to deliver social and emotional wellbeing programs. 
NSW Health provided $2 million to Aboriginal Community 
Controlled Services to deliver culturally responsive social 
and emotional Aboriginal wellbeing initiatives, as part of 
the extension of the Emergency Drought Relief Mental 
Health Package.

The Centre for Aboriginal Health held 53 capacity-building 
events across NSW Health to support completion of 
Aboriginal Health Impact Statements. The Impact 
Statements ensure that the specific needs of Aboriginal 
people are fully considered when developing new policy, 
program and strategic initiatives. During the year a total of 
125 Impact Statements were completed and approved 
across NSW Health.
The Centre also developed and delivered the Aboriginal 
Health Progress Report for all local health districts and 
specialty health networks, including the annual Aboriginal 
Health Dashboards. These continued to report on a range 
of outcome indicators and progress against implementing 
the Aboriginal Health Plan 2013-2023. 
Meanwhile, the Agency for Clinical Innovation’s Aboriginal 
Health Working Group co-designed engagement and 
implementation requirements for the collection of 
culturally appropriate measures for Patient Reported 
Outcome Measures. 
Supporting pregnancy 
and the first 2000 days
To care for pregnant women and provide their babies 
with the best possible start in life, NSW Health partnered 
with other NSW Government agencies to launch 
Brighter Beginnings: the first 2000 days of life, 
a whole-of-government initiative, in October 2020. 
NSW Health also finalised recruitment into the Focus 
on New Fathers program in four local health districts from 
August 2020 to 30 June 2021, with 3260 enrolments. 
The pilot will continue until the end of 2021, testing 
psychosocial screening to fathers in the perinatal 
period with pathways to provide support and care.
Significant improvements were made to the Get Healthy in 
Pregnancy Service with the development of an e-Referral 
option from eMaternity software. This resulted in an 
increase of referrals, with a total of 14,153 in 2020-21.
SAFE START, a policy for pregnant women and families 
with babies up to two years old, helps identify families 
with mental health and social difficulties. It was reviewed 
this year to ensure its currency with research, national 
clinical guidelines and optimal statewide implementation. 
The Henry Review, an independent review into children’s 
health services in NSW, made 77 recommendations relating 
to all health services and clinicians delivering care for 
children, young people and families. Implementation 
of many recommendations has already commenced. 
This includes the establishment of a new statewide 
committee that will provide system leadership and 
advice to strengthen NSW health services to children, 
young people and their families. 
The Agency for Clinical Innovation established the 
Maternity and Neonatal Network to provide direction, 
governance and leadership for existing statewide clinician 
forums and groups. At 30 June 2021, the Network had 342 
members. A collaborative partnership was formed within 
NSW Health to lead the neonatal components of the 
response to the Paediatric and Neonatal Intensive Care 
work plan and recommendations of the Henry Review.
Keeping People Healthy Award winner 
An extraordinary 
response to the 
global COVID-19 
pandemic
NSW Health Pathology
NSW Health Pathology’s pandemic breakthrough 
on 22 January 2020 was made by a team of experts 
at the Institute of Clinical Pathology and Medical 
Research Westmead, who rapidly established 
highly specialised COVID-19 testing capabilities. 
Working in the state-of-the-art biosecurity 
P4 laboratory, elite researchers were able to 
successfully grow the live virus from NSW 
patients – a much-needed step in understanding 
and containing the deadly virus. Knowing COVID-19 
does not discriminate by age, location or background, 
NSW Health Pathology leveraged its extensive 
statewide network and local clinical partnerships 
to expand access to reliable testing across the state. 
By mid-August 2020, NSW Health Pathology experts 
had conducted more than 1.2 million COVID-19 tests 
– an unprecedented effort that placed NSW among 
the highest testing rates per capita in the world 
and undoubtedly helped save lives. NSW Health 
Pathology won the 2020 Keeping People Healthy 
Award for their achievement.
NSW Health Pathology, led 
by Professor Dominic Dwyer, 
quickly established and 
increased COVID-19 testing 
capabilities across the state 
to respond to COVID-19 with 
agility this year.

Priority 2 
Provide world-class 
clinical care where 
patient safety is first
NSW Health is placing patient 
experience and value based health 
at the heart of everything we do 
– part of enhancing a world-class 
healthcare system where every 
individual matters, every day.
In 2020-21, NSW Health organisations collaborated to:
•	review and implement protocols and policies that put 
patient and staff safety first
•	make sure the right systems are in place so we can 
drive value based healthcare for all patients, in every 
part of NSW
•	embed the principle of human experience as central 
to clinical treatment and patient care
•	ensure all patients have timely and equitable access 
to healthcare whatever their need, geographic location 
or age.
Staff in local health districts and networks put these 
strategies into action to deliver excellent care across NSW.
Our priorities 
2.1 	 
Continue to deliver high-quality and safe 
patient care 
2.2 
Continue to embed value based healthcare 
to deliver the right care in the right setting
2.3 
Elevate the human experience by actively 
partnering with patients, families and 
caregivers 
2.4 
Provide timely and equitable access to 
appropriate care 
2.5 
Use data and analytics to drive reform 
and innovation and to support value based 
healthcare 
Key achievements
•	Established the Maternity and Neonatal Safety Program 
to improve safety for mothers and babies in NSW.
•	Continued to review, update and implement protocols 
and procedures to keep staff and patients safe during 
the COVID-19 pandemic. eHealth NSW, in partnership 
with the Clinical Excellence Commission, completed 
the rollout of the new incident management system 
ims+ to all NSW Health organisations.
•	Embedded value based healthcare in all agencies, 
and through four integrated programs, aimed at 
securing better health outcomes for our patients 
and better value across the health system.
•	Launched Elevating the Human Experience: 
Our guide to action for patient, family, carer, volunteer 
and caregiver experiences in April 2021 to improve the 
experience of patients, families and carers in 
the health system.
•	Continued enhancement of local health district board 
reports tailored to the information needs of local health 
districts and specialty health network board members.
Delivering high-quality 
and safe patient care 
Improving safety for mothers and babies
The Maternity and Neonatal Safety Program was 
established in 2020-21 to address systematic safety 
and quality issues for mothers and babies in NSW. 
The program priorities include the delivery of perinatal 
safety education, reducing stillbirth by supporting 
teams to reliably implement the Safer Baby Bundle, 
and standardising the recognition and management 
of babies with neonatal encephalopathy.
In October 2020, the Neonatal, Small Baby and 
Paediatric Transport Governance Committee was 
convened to provide oversight and direction of clinical 
and corporate governance for neonatal, small baby and 
paediatric transport in NSW, particularly the possible 
risk to patient safety.

Responding to incidents
ims+
eHealth NSW, in partnership with the Clinical Excellence 
Commission, completed the rollout of the new incident 
management system, ims+, to all NSW Health 
organisations. ims+ tracks clinical and work health 
and safety incidents and contributes to patient and 
workplace safety. 
COVID-19 response plans
In 2020-21, HealthShare NSW developed and 
implemented COVID-19 response plans across the 
organisation. These plans included unique partnering 
arrangements with the private sector to ensure the 
responsiveness and continuity of our critical services in 
times of increased service levels because of COVID-19.
Protecting patients and paramedics
NSW Ambulance developed a Pandemic Management 
Protocol to ensure the safety of both paramedics and 
patients, as well as clinical quality. NSW Ambulance 
also rolled out new procedures and education to improve 
safety for clinicians undertaking high-risk aerosol 
procedures for critically ill patients. The procedures 
outlined a range of clinical safety technology with 
a higher specification level than previous intensive 
care paramedic equipment. 
Embedding value based healthcare 
Implementing value based care
In 2020-21, NSW Health embedded value based care 
across the health system. Over the 12 months this was 
underpinned through four statewide programs:
•	Leading Better Value Care
•	Integrated Care 
•	Commissioning for Better Value 
•	Collaborative Commissioning. 
In 2020-21, four new working groups were established 
to support value based healthcare measurement and 
evaluation; articulate research priorities; set the approach 
for value based funding and purchasing; and align 
communication approaches with other reform areas.
Other milestones in implementing value based care 
in 2020-21 included:
•	hosting the first virtual statewide Value Based 
Healthcare Forum in November 2020, which attracted 
more than 500 delegates from almost 100 organisations
•	publishing the article Value based healthcare in NSW: 
continuing the patient-centred journey by NSW Health 
Secretary Ms Elizabeth Koff in The Health Advocate
•	hosting the inaugural Australian Value-Based Health 
Care Conference awards in May 2021, which recognised 
two local NSW Health services – Concord Repatriation 
General Hospital’s Osteoarthritis Chronic Care program 
and Sydney Local Health District’s Bronchiolitis program
•	publishing the Commissioning for Better Value Strategy 
2021-24, which supports better patient care and 
experiences by shifting the focus from outputs 
to outcomes 
•	distributing the Value Based Healthcare Update 
e-newsletter to stakeholders across Australia with 
relevant, engaging digital content, tools and resources
•	progressing the Statewide Diabetes Initiative in 
collaboration with primary health networks and other 
service providers. The initiative aimed to support a more 
coordinated approach to diabetes management to keep 
people well and out of hospital. 
NSW also provided significant input into national 
and cross-jurisdictional work on paying for value 
and outcomes under the 2020-25 Addendum to 
the National Health Reform Agreement. 
Elevating the Human Experience, 
an action plan
NSW Health is committed to improving the patient 
experience and making it an empowering one for 
everybody involved, including family and carers.
Elevating the Human Experience: Our guide to action for 
patient, family, carer, volunteer and caregiver experiences 
was launched in April 2021. This first statewide guide to 
action builds on existing work to outline a coordinated 
approach and create a truly human-centred health system. 
To develop the action plan, more than 500 consumers and 
staff worked to identify and prioritise initiatives that will 
improve the experience of patients and families.
Throughout 2020-21, Elevating the Human Experience 
was promoted through a dedicated public website that 
launched during Patient Experience Week, as well as 
monthly newsletters, seminars and key events such 
as the Gathering of Kindness.
To support Elevating the Human Experience, eHealth 
NSW developed a new patient engagement platform 
strategy that outlines what technology is needed to 
enhance the experience of patients, carers and families 
in the health system. It identified access to information, 
patient feedback and equity as key areas for digital 
enablement and support.

Project CHEF, Bowral and District Hospital
Food is critical to patient health and for their 
experience in hospital. In May 2021, the Project 
CHEF (Co-Designing Healthy and Enjoyable Food) 
pilot launched at Bowral and District Hospital.
Project CHEF is a more patient-centred model of providing 
food services in NSW public hospitals. It focuses on 
flexible mealtimes and allowing patients to eat when they 
are hungry rather than at set mealtimes, by submitting 
orders through their mobile device to a dedicated call 
centre. Patient experience is a key measure of success for 
the pilot and a consumer group of former patients and 
community members was actively involved in its design 
and implementation.
Improving the emergency 
department experience
More than 30,000 emergency department patients 
and families provided real-time feedback about their 
experiences of care, which has led to changes 
throughout the year.
In 2020-21, the Emergency Department Patient 
Experience Program was extended, with funding for 
100 new Patient Experience Officer positions across 52 
NSW public hospital emergency departments. The new 
positions were in response to feedback from patients and 
carers about waiting times when seeking emergency care.
Technology initiative, GoShare, has allowed hospital 
staff to share information with patients and families 
in more than 20 languages, including the Charter 
of Health Care Rights.
The Centre for Aboriginal Health
The Centre for Aboriginal Health and the Bureau of 
Health Information reviewed patient experience survey 
data to publish two Snapshot reports: Adults admitted 
to hospital: Results from the 2019 patient survey; 
and Maternity care: Results from the 2019 survey. 
Of the almost 3500 Aboriginal people who responded 
to the Adult Admitted Patient Survey, around eight 
in 10 said the nurses (81 per cent) and doctors 
(80 per cent) were ‘always’ kind and caring.
The Centre worked with local health districts to 
build the cultural safety of the health system, 
including approaches identified in Elevating 
the Human Experience. Tools include the NSW 
Health Services Aboriginal Cultural Engagement 
Self-Assessment Tool, which identifies ways of 
strengthening cultural engagement between 
NSW Health organisation staff and their Aboriginal 
stakeholders. 
Getting access to care 
right for everyone
Reducing preventable visits to hospital
In April 2021, Integrated Care launched the statewide 
initiative Planned Care for Better Health (PCBH), which 
supports the Premier’s Priority for reducing preventable 
visits to NSW hospitals by five per cent by 2023. 
The PCBH program identifies patients who are 
vulnerable and at risk with complex health and social 
needs, and provides person-centred coordinated care 
in the community. The Risk of Hospitalisation algorithm 
supports staff to identify patients who will benefit 
from integrated care interventions. The algorithm 
considers an extensive list of demographic and 
socioeconomic factors, including a patient’s hospital 
utilisation and medical history. In partnership with 
the patient and their carer, the comprehensive health 
psychosocial assessment supports a shared approach 
to improving health and wellbeing goals.
The implementation of the algorithm, telehealth, 
virtual care and remote monitoring are key to enabling 
the delivery of care in the community and reducing 
preventable hospitalisation.
Most importantly, through the PCBH program and other 
integrated care initiatives, patients receive appropriate 
care in the right setting for them. As a result of the 
program, NSW Health achieved a saving of 200,000 bed 
days in the first half of 2021. 
To further reduce preventable visits to hospital, 
Integrated Care in partnership with Health Services 
will implement a statewide initiative targeting patients 
who frequently present to emergency departments 
over a 12-month period. Early modelling indicates that 
identifying and supporting these patients to access 
primary and community services can lead to substantial 
reductions in emergency department visits and improve 
the experience patients have of the health system.

Treating NSW children safely – from home 
The Sydney Children’s Hospitals Network continued 
to help patients receive care closer to home with 
the help of local health teams through virtualKIDS, 
Australia’s first paediatric-specific virtual care service. 
The 24/7 nursing-led service provided timely and 
equitable access to care, through functions such 
as remote monitoring, a patient and family hotline, 
collaborative virtual ward rounds and coordinating 
specialty advice facilitation.
In 2020-21, COVID-19 reduced the availability of clinic 
space and nursing staff to complete food allergen 
challenges and made parents understandably reluctant 
to attend clinic appointments with their children. 
In response, NSW Health paediatric allergy services 
established new outreach services in regional NSW 
and trialled Saturday clinics for low-risk food allergen 
challenges. These changes were positively received 
by NSW parents. 
From Good to Great in 
emergency departments
The collaborative Good to Great program has brought 
together various parts of NSW Health to deliver on the 
Premier’s Priority of improving service levels in hospitals.
Good to Great has empowered leadership teams 
in emergency departments to focus on leadership 
capability, building positive workplace culture and 
nurturing collaborative partnerships to improve 
patient, carer and staff experience and the 
performance of emergency departments.
In 2020-21, the program started in 11 emergency 
departments at Coffs Harbour, Belmont, Armidale, 
Queanbeyan, Dubbo, Nepean, St George, Sutherland, 
Sydney/Sydney Eye, Sydney Children’s and Ryde hospitals. 
EPIC
New Emergency Protocols Initiating Care (EPIC) 
protocols were developed to streamline care so that 
patients are treated on time in emergency departments. 
These protocols have focused on the first hour of 
emergency care when the safety and experience 
of patients is critical. The program also recognised 
the skills and qualifications of nursing staff in our 
emergency departments. EPIC is currently being 
piloted in Illawarra Shoalhaven Local Health District.
Getting things done in 2020-21
Over the reporting period, measures across NSW 
to ensure patients and communities receive access to 
appropriate care included:
•	rolling out the NSW Telestroke Service at 11 regional 
and rural hospitals across NSW, with over 900 patients 
receiving consultations since March 2020
•	publishing The NSW Health Genomics Strategy 
Implementation Plan 2021-25 to enhance disease 
management and prevention in NSW
•	expanding the NSW Health Pathology exome sequencing 
service to improve access to genomic testing within NSW 
Health. Exome sequencing is a technique for sequencing 
all the known protein-coding regions of DNA in a genome 
(known as the exome). The service saw 5508 exome 
referrals, exceeding initial modelling by 120 per cent
•	establishing the first national ocular gene therapy centre 
at the Children’s Hospital at Westmead, which continues 
to be a global leader in the gene-based treatment of 
spinal muscular atrophy. 
NSW Health is currently on track to deliver 10,000 
additional cataract surgeries by 2023, with 32,424 
cataract surgeries completed across NSW metropolitan, 
rural and regional public hospitals in 2020-21 – more than 
2000 above target for the year.
Increasing elective surgery capacity
In July 2020, the NSW Health Elective Surgery Roundtable 
brought together experts from the public and private 
sectors to rethink the way surgery is organised and better 
deliver the outcomes that matter most to patients waiting 
for elective surgery. 
The NSW Elective Surgery Action Plan was developed in 
2020-21 as an outcome of the Roundtable. The plan has 
delivered more elective surgery capacity with a statewide 
guideline for transferring care to private providers; a 
review of the Surgical Activity During Christmas/New Year 
policy; and a new electronic surgery referral system.

Using data and analytics to drive 
reform and innovation 
HOPE for patients and clinicians
In 2020-21, the Agency for Clinical Innovation led 
the implementation of patient reported measures to 
improve the experience of patients and support their 
shared treatment. Patient reported measures gave 
patients the opportunity to provide direct and timely 
feedback about their experiences in the health system 
and how it impacted their general wellbeing and ability 
to do the things that mattered to them. 
A new IT platform was launched to support the 
real-time collection and use of patient reported 
measures. The system, known as Health Outcomes 
and Patient Experience (HOPE), was co-designed with 
consumers, clinicians and managers. It allowed patients 
or their carers to log in using a personal computer, 
smartphone or tablet to provide feedback and access 
information uploaded by their healthcare provider 
through dashboards and decision support tools. 
This information sharing has helped clinicians and patients 
share decision making about care, treatment and health 
interventions. Collecting data also allowed clinicians to 
measure progress and improvement in patients’ health, 
and provides the health system with insights into patient 
needs to drive future improvements.
HOPE has been rolled out in more than 100 locations, 
13 local health districts and one general practice.
ROVE
The Register of Outcomes, Value and Experience (ROVE) 
is a virtual registry that links Leading Better Value Care 
administrative, clinical and patient reported measures 
data in a single place. 
Launched in 2020-21, ROVE allowed staff to review key 
monitoring and evaluation measures and benchmark local 
progress against the state and other districts. Over 70,000 
patient experience surveys have been linked into ROVE. 
This allows a multidimensional view of patient experience 
and facilitates the use of data to action service 
improvement at local and system levels.

Key achievements
•	Improvements for vulnerable and at-risk patients 
across seven integrated care initiatives, including a 
24 per cent reduction in unplanned admissions from 
residential aged care.
•	The launch of seven SafeHavens and 12 Suicide 
Prevention Outreach teams to help reduce suicide 
rates in NSW by 20 per cent by 2023.
•	There was $36.4 million over four years for mental 
health Response and Recovery Specialists to support 
mental health in regional and rural communities.
•	An extra 20 nurses and 35 allied health professionals, 
and refurbishment of 34 palliative care facilities to 
support a dignified end of life for people in NSW.
•	The launch of two Statewide Intellectual Disability 
Mental Health Hubs, to provide specialist support for 
people with intellectual disability and training for more 
than 1500 health and disability professionals.
A more connected health system
Seven evidence-based integrated care initiatives 
focused on improving outcomes for vulnerable and 
at-risk populations and connecting them with services 
and support. Comparisons with control groups have 
already demonstrated results.
Emergency Department to Community: Each patient 
showed an average reduction of 10 presentations to 
emergency departments, over 12 months.
Residential Aged Care: Reduced bed days from 
unplanned admissions by 24 per cent, with an average 
annual reduction in ambulance callouts of 21 per cent. 
Vulnerable Families: By providing community support to 
parents or carers with complex health and social needs, 
and their children, this program saw an average reduction 
of 0.4 emergency department admissions per patient 
compared with the control group.
Paediatric Network: On average, travel was reduced 
by 4620 km for each patient, and there were on average 
12 fewer missed days of school for the patient, and six 
fewer missed workdays for the carer.
Specialist Outreach to Primary Care: Improving the 
capacity and capability of general practitioners to provide 
specialist assessment and care in non-hospital settings 
led to a 44 per cent reduction in attendance to emergency 
departments for the enrolled patients. All patients 
reported improved engagement and GP integration.
Secondary Triage: Between June 2020 and June 2021, 
NSW Ambulance received 106,254 calls from residential 
aged care facilities; 47,833 were classified as low 
acuity calls (45 per cent). Of these, 12 per cent (5885) 
were managed by the Secondary Triage process with 
57 per cent (3343) of residents receiving their care in 
residence, with no transfer to hospital required. 
Planned Care for Better Health (PCBH): Improves care 
quality and health literacy, and can lead to a reduction in 
unplanned hospital admissions. PCBH and other key 
integrated care initiatives achieved a saving of 200,000 
bed days in the first half of 2021.

Collaborative Commissioning
Collaborative Commissioning is a whole-of-system 
approach that supports value based care in the 
community by setting up working relationships between 
health organisations, stakeholders and service providers 
across the entire range of care for a patient.
The central platform of Collaborative Commissioning 
has been the establishment of regionally based 
partnerships between primary health networks, 
local health districts and other affiliated health 
organisations. These partnerships led change at the local 
level by focusing healthcare around the priority health 
needs of their local population, using local resources.
Six Collaborative Commissioning partnerships were 
established to focus on:
•	cardiology in the community
•	value based urgent care
•	urgent care for frail and older persons
•	type 2 diabetes
•	obesity and diabetes
•	chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and 
congestive heart failure.
Linking GP data
In NSW, 450 GP practices – almost one in five GP practices 
– participated in the data linkage project Lumos. The 
linked datasets brought together primary care clinical 
information with hospital data to support decision making 
across value based healthcare programs. 
Connecting better with Aboriginal Community 
Controlled Health Services
In 2020-21, the Centre for Aboriginal Health focused on 
supporting Aboriginal Community Controlled Health 
Services (ACCHS) to manage COVID-19. This included 
supporting ACCHS:
•	with clinical education in partnership with the Royal 
Australian College of General Practitioners and 
Aboriginal Health and Medical Research Council of NSW
•	with access to social and emotional wellbeing support 
and consumables, as well as advice around infection 
control, border closures and exemptions.
Rules were introduced in all Service Agreements to 
ensure all local health districts and specialty health 
networks had a partnership agreement with their local 
ACCHS. The Agreements are subject to periodic review 
and require high-level representation within the local 
health district.
Performance frameworks and clinical networks were 
established with local health districts and specialty 
health networks to enable integrated planning and 
service delivery. Some of these clinical networks have 
established an Aboriginal health program of work, 
including the Aboriginal Chronic Conditions Network 
and the Cardiac Network. 
The Centre for Aboriginal Health continued to work 
on seed projects in areas of particular importance, 
including mental health, cancer and incorporated 
culture into the delivery of antenatal care services 
for women giving birth off country.
Frailty taskforce
The Agency for Clinical Innovation established the 
NSW Frailty Taskforce and a Community of Practice 
with over 500 members, encouraging a more integrated
approach to frailty, ageing well and end of life care. 
Towards Zero Suicides
Towards Zero Suicides aims to reduce the suicide rate 
in NSW by 20 per cent by 2023. In 2020-21 the initiative 
progressed, with: 
•	seven SafeHavens providing an alternative to 
presenting to emergency, and 12 Suicide Prevention 
Outreach Teams launched
•	the availability of aftercare in nine primary 
health networks
•	suicide prevention rural counsellors recruited in eight 
local health districts
•	the development of suicide care pathways to improve 
care and prevent suicide in 15 local health districts and 
Justice Health
•	the completion of suicide prevention training by 3769 
community members, 1158 Service NSW staff and 475 
NSW Health staff 
•	commissioning of statewide packages for 
priority populations
•	progression of 12 Aboriginal suicide prevention projects
•	commencement of three peer-led programs 
•	four new Community Wellbeing Collaboratives 
that organise local community response to suicide 
becoming operational 
•	Youth Aftercare services for children and young people 
at risk of suicide operational in three local health districts
•	the launch of the NSW Suicide Monitoring System, 
which provides monthly reports on the estimated 
number of suspected and confirmed suicides in NSW
•	the launch of support services for people who are

Achieving mental health reform
Mental health is a focus and priority across the NSW 
health system. Achievements in mental health reform 
in 2020-21 included:
•	the Aboriginal Mental Health and Wellbeing Strategy 
2020-25, which was published in December 2020. 
NSW Health also continues to support local health 
districts and specialty health networks to develop 
their own implementation plans
•	NSW Health progressing work on the NSW Peer 
Workforce Framework in 2020-21, including 
establishment of an Expert Reference Group and 
commencement of procurement to support a 
comprehensive consultation and engagement process. It 
is anticipated consultation will continue into early 
2022, with the framework expected to launch in 2022
•	the NSW Service Plan for People with Eating Disorders 
(2021-2025), published on the NSW Health website. 
Embedding the treatment of eating disorders services 
as core business in districts and networks will ensure 
people can access care close to their home, 
families and local support networks
•	The Mental Health and Cognitive Impairment Forensic 
Provisions Act 2020, which commenced in March 2021, 
replacing the Mental Health (Forensic Provisions) 
Act 1990. The changes included updated language, 
and changes to make the forensic mental health system 
more efficient, transparent and clear. The changes were 
communicated through new information resources 
for the health sector and community, including an 
information session for NSW Health staff
•	The Family Focused Recovery Framework 2020-2025, 
which was launched in October 2020, focusing on the 
wellbeing of children of parents with mental illness, 
and parents with mental illness. Grants were provided 
to specialty health networks and local health districts 
to support implementation of the new framework. 
A baseline evaluation has been conducted to monitor 
the ongoing effectiveness of the framework.
A five-year mental health reform program
In June 2021, NSW Health submitted an initial report 
against 17 of the 24 actions identified in Living Well in 
Focus 2020-2024: A strategic plan for community 
recovery, wellbeing and mental health in NSW (LWiF) 
by the Mental Health Commission of NSW. 
NSW Health has planned to provide the next, 
mid-term progress report on the implementation 
of LWiF in mid-2023.
Enhancing rural counselling support
In 2021, the NSW Government committed $21.15 million 
for a five-year extension of the Rural Adversity Mental 
Health Program.
Seclusion and restraint prevention
As part of the NSW Mental Health Patient Safety 
Program, 50 Improvement Coaches were trained to work 
with mental health services to identify improvement 
priorities and to lead improvement initiatives against these 
priorities. 
The Clinical Excellence Commission has worked 
with three local health districts on safety and quality 
projects to reduce restrictive practices. 
In June 2021, the Mental Health Branch completed a series 
of statewide training webinars presented by international 
experts on the Six Core Strategies© to reduce risk, 
prevent and work to eliminate the use of seclusion and 
restraint. These included follow-up coaching sessions 
for 20 clinical leaders and managers of acute mental 
health facilities. 
Reducing unplanned mental health 
admissions for Aboriginal people
NSW Health is actively building a more inclusive 
organisational culture across the health system to 
ensure the cultural safety of Aboriginal people is 
prioritised. An example of this is the Aboriginal Health 
Dashboard Toolkit, which included advice on building 
cultural competency, improving identification, 
establishing cultural safety of environments 
and effective communication. 
Quarterly performance meetings across 2020-21 have 
provided the opportunity to put this advice into practice 
through monitoring and implementation of initiatives to 
reduce the gap in care between Indigenous and non-
Indigenous mental health consumers in areas such as 
readmission to hospital and post-discharge care in the 
community.
Supporting Royal Commissions into 
aged care and disability
During 2020-21, NSW Health continued to lead the NSW 
Government input to the Royal Commission into Aged Care 
Quality and Safety. This included responding to the Royal 
Commission’s requests for information, attendance at the 
special hearing on the impact of COVID-19 in aged care 
held in August 2020 and providing a response to the Royal 
Commission’s draft recommendations. 
NSW Health	
Annual Report 2020-21   :  Performance   :  page 26


NSW Health also responded to requests from the 
Royal Commission into Violence, Abuse, Neglect and 
Exploitation of People with Disability. NSW Health 
representatives appeared as witnesses at three public 
hearings focusing on:
•	the provision of healthcare or services for people 
with cognitive disability
•	education and training of health professionals in 
relation to people with cognitive disability.
Strengthening services for frailty, 
ageing and end of life care
Safety in residential aged care
NSW Health worked with the Australian Government 
Department of Health and the Aged Care Quality and 
Safety Commission to develop and update the Protocol 
to support joint management of a COVID-19 outbreak in 
one or more residential aged care facility (RACF) in NSW. 
The joint protocol is one of a suite of documents that will 
help the Australian Government, NSW Government and 
aged care approved providers work together to prevent, 
prepare for and respond to an outbreak of COVID-19 in a 
Commonwealth-funded registered aged care facility in NSW. 
The protocol aims to optimise care for all residents in 
impacted nursing homes, regardless of their COVID-19 
status, and to contain and control the outbreak to bring 
it to an end as quickly and safely as possible.
NSW Health residential aged care services implemented 
a new Serious Incident Response Scheme (SIRS), a new 
set of Commonwealth reporting obligations for residential 
aged care providers commencing 1 April 2021. The SIRS is 
focused on the safety, health, wellbeing and quality of life 
of aged care consumers.
Supporting independence and wellbeing 
for older people
In line with the Australian Government’s aged care reform 
agenda, NSW Health is committed to ensuring wellness 
and reablement (short-term or time-limited support) 
practices are implemented as a core part of all NSW 
Health aged care services. The approach ensures that 
older people in NSW live as active, purposeful, healthy 
and independent lives as they can and, where possible, 
remain living in their own homes. 
To assist in the focus on client independence and 
autonomy, NSW Health published the Wellness and 
Reablement in Aged Care Guideline in January 2021.
The guideline aims to support and promote a 
consistent understanding of wellness and reablement, 
and its practical implementation and measurement 
across aged care services provided by NSW Health. 
It applied to all aged care services provided by NSW 
Health: Transitional Aged Care, the Commonwealth 
Home Support Program, the Aged Care Assessment 
Program and the Regional Assessment Service. 
Improving palliative care in NSW
Improvements and enhancements to palliative care 
continued across NSW in 2020-21. An extra 20 nurses 
and 35 allied health professionals joined the specialist 
palliative care workforce to provide greater choices for 
people at the end of life and to ensure people can be 
cared for at home if they choose.
In regional and rural NSW, palliative care services were 
supported to use telehealth so that people can access 
specialist palliative care wherever they live.
Across NSW, 34 refurbishment projects of palliative 
care facilities were completed to create more home-like 
environments for patients, families and carers when 
patients are cared for in hospital settings at the end of life. 
A further 34 refurbishment projects will be completed 
over the next two years. Following a further funding boost 
in the 2020-21 Budget, an extra 5000 End of Life home 
support packages are now available for people in NSW. 
NSW Health received $10 million over five years from 
the Australian Government to enhance palliative care 
for people in residential aged care facilities. 
All districts have completed planning and are now 
implementing a variety of approaches, including additional 
nurses to provide in-reach palliative care, education and 
training to build skills of staff, shared assessment and 
care planning, as well virtual care. 
Healthcare for vulnerable people
Intellectual Disability Health Service
The Intellectual Disability Health Service (IDHS) has 
provided capacity-building for primary healthcare and 
NSW Health staff and improved access 
to quality mainstream health services for people with 
intellectual disability and complex needs. An evaluation 
of the program is underway to assess program outcomes 
and inform future implementation.

Two new intellectual disability 
mental health hubs
An investment of $4.4 million over four years has funded 
two Statewide Intellectual Disability Mental Health 
Hubs. These Statewide Intellectual Disability Mental 
Health Hubs were launched by the Minister for 
Mental Health and the Minister for Families, 
Communities and Disability in February 2021. 
More than 100 people with intellectual disability and 
co-occurring mental health problems have received 
a clinical consultation or assessment. The Hubs have 
also provided training for more than 1500 health and 
disability professionals. 
Both the Sydney Children’s Hospitals Network Mental 
Health Intellectual Disability Hub and the Statewide 
Intellectual Disability Mental Health Outreach Service 
at Sydney Local Health District have received referrals 
from regional and metropolitan services, with care 
being provided face-to-face and through telehealth. 
COVID-19 support for people with disability
Communities of Practice were established across key 
clinical specialities to support the response to COVID-19. 
The Disability Community of Practice has provided a forum 
to share ideas, strategies, local solutions and concerns 
with respect to pandemic preparedness for people with 
disability. The group has more than 150 members including 
people with disability, peak non-government organisations, 
clinicians, program managers and other key stakeholders. 
Supports provided to people with disability and 
participants of the National Disability Insurance 
Scheme (NDIS) during the pandemic included:
•	the introduction of NDIS Hospital Liaison Officers 
in local health districts 
•	implementation of new escalation pathways and an 
accommodation register to assist with safe patient 
discharge from hospitals
•	provision of disability-related public health messaging 
distributed via easy-read resources, webinars, websites, 
videos and virtual NDIS service provider forums.
LGBTQI health 
In 2020-21, NSW Health opened the first of two new 
transgender health service hubs, following a gender 
services review. Maple Leaf House, in Newcastle, 
provides coordinated, multidisciplinary health services 
for trans and gender diverse children, adolescents and 
young people.
From 2021-22 onwards, $3.4 million a year has been 
committed to gender services including the development 
of a joint service across Sydney Children’s Hospitals 
Network in partnership with a Sydney-based local health 
district and statewide coordination including further 
development of the NSW Model of Care.
In June 2021, the NSW Government committed 
$3 million to ACON towards the establishment of 
an LGBTQ health centre.
Once established by ACON, the health centre will aim 
to improve access for lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, 
queer and other sexuality and gender diverse people to 
primary and community-based healthcare.
An integrated approach to trauma
The Integrated Prevention and Response to Violence, 
Abuse and Neglect (IPARVAN) Framework is being 
implemented to strengthen NSW Health’s response 
to violence, abuse and neglect, including children 
and young people with problematic or harmful sexual 
behaviour. An implementation plan for phase 2 is under 
development focusing on integrating NSW Health’s 
Violence, Abuse and Neglect services with the broader 
health system and interagency partners as well as 
continuing the phase 1 focus on integrating Violence, 
Abuse and Neglect services themselves. 
The Agency for Clinical Innovation partnered with 
NSW Health’s Education Centre Against Violence to 
deliver trauma-informed care training for clinicians. 
Participants learned about the application of trauma 
and violence-informed approaches to their work, 
with a particular focus on First Nations people of 
Australia accessing healthcare systems. 
The domestic violence routine screening pilot commenced 
in six emergency departments with the support of eHealth 
NSW’s clinical system solutions for flagging and screening 
eligible patients, and training for health staff delivered 
by NSW Health’s Education Centre Against Violence. 
An evaluation of the pilot is underway, to be completed 
in mid-2022.
Programs were implemented as part of the NSW 
Government response to the Royal Commission into 
Institutional Responses to Child Sexual Abuse, including:
•	a pilot by South Eastern Sydney and Mid North Coast 
local health districts to improve outcomes for survivors 
through specialist trauma counselling and treatment 
provided by NSW Health’s sexual assault, mental health, 
alcohol and other drug and Aboriginal health services, 
with community support services. 
NSW Health	
Annual Report 2020-21   :  Performance   :  page 28


An action research evaluation and costing study will 
provide evidence to inform statewide rollout of the new 
integrated service model from 2022-2023
•	a Sexual Assault and New Street Services Access 
Strategy for People with Disability, developed by NSW 
Health in partnership with the NSW Health Education 
Centre Against Violence. The strategy sets out a 
framework to improve access for people with disability to 
NSW Health specialist Sexual Assault Services and New 
Street services for children and young people who have 
engaged in problematic or harmful sexualised 
behaviours, including support for their families and 
carers, by enhancing specialist therapeutic practice and 
building workforce capacity for disability inclusion. A 
Co-design Advisory Committee made up of people with 
lived experience has been established to guide 
implementation of the strategy.
On behalf of the NSW Government, NSW Health 
is developing a NSW Framework for Preventing 
and Responding to Problematic and Harmful Sexual 
Behaviours. A cross-government governance structure 
has been established to lead the development of the 
framework and supporting projects. The framework will 
be based on a public health model and is being developed 
through a co-design approach. A review of the current 
policy and legislation approach in NSW, a survey of the 
workforce across the sector and a quantitative and 
qualitative research project with children and young 
people who have displayed problematic and harmful 
sexual behaviours and their parents and carers have been 
completed. Drawing on this evidence will ensure that the 
framework responds to the current context in NSW and 
experience of children and families. An implementation 
plan for the framework is also under development and 
will outline actions and activities that will be prioritised 
under the framework’s strategic directions, including 
a strong focus on primary and secondary prevention 
initiatives and resources.
In addition, an Integrated Trauma-Informed Care 
Framework for vulnerable children, young people 
and families was being developed, aiming to improve 
the healthcare experiences of vulnerable children and 
young people and their families and carers, as well as 
the experiences of healthcare providers. 
The Safe and Supported at Home (SASH) Program 
launched in 2018 supported patients with disabilities 
to manage at home, particularly those who have been 
unsuccessful with applying to the NDIS. In 2020-21, there 
were 7400 packages delivered to support people with 
disability to remain in their own home.
Health Research and Innovation Award winner 
A Childhood Cancer 
National Precision 
Medicine Program
The Sydney Children’s 
Hospitals Network
This program aimed to develop a comprehensive 
testing platform to provide in-depth tumour profiling 
to identify personalised treatment plans for children 
with high-risk cancers. The Zero Childhood Cancer 
platform includes rapid genome sequencing and 
drug testing to analyse patient results to identify 
novel therapies. Results included:
•	more than 350 children with high-risk cancers 
being enrolled in the program
•	reportable molecular aberrations being identified in 
more than 90 per cent of cases leading to a change 
of diagnosis in five per cent of patients, while 70 per 
cent received a new treatment recommendation
•	a previously unknown germline mutation being 
identified in 16 per cent of cases
•	25 per cent of patients receiving a new treatment, 
with the majority showing clinical benefit
•	40 per cent of patients experiencing a cessation 
of tumour growth, and 30 per cent having their 
tumours shrink – in some cases with complete 
disease resolution.
The Sydney Children’s Hospitals Network won the 
2020 Health Research and Innovation Award for 
this program.
The Sydney Children’s Hospitals 
Network developed a platform to 
personalise treatment for children 
with high-risk cancers.

Key achievements
•	More than 400 final-year medical students 
were employed in Assistant in Medicine (AiM) 
positions across 41 facilities in local health districts 
and networks between July and November 
2020. The AiM position was established in March 
2020 to supplement the junior medical workforce 
in response to the pandemic. 
•	The NSW Government committed $46.8 million 
over four years in the 2020-21 state budget to create 
100 additional Wellbeing Nurse positions to be placed 
in NSW secondary and primary schools. By 22 June 2021, 
28 of the first tranche of 50 Wellbeing Nurses had 
been recruited.
•	To celebrate the strength of staff diversity, build an 
inclusive culture and support staff, the Diversity Inclusion 
Belonging Resource Hub was launched in December 
2020 to provide direction to NSW Health organisations.
•	Public health organisations continued to implement 
workplace culture and safety action plans, expanding 
these to include a range of COVID-19-specific wellbeing 
initiatives such as wellness support webpages and 
resources, workshops partnering with the Black Dog 
Institute and various webinars focusing on mental health 
in lockdown. NSW Health contributed more than $4.6 
million to local health districts, networks and statewide 
services to fund this work.
•	The NSW Health Focus on the Future initiative aligns with 
the Future Health Strategy in supporting the health 
system to become digitally enabled and adaptable to 
technological changes and disruptions. The initiative 
helped senior leaders to forecast workforce needs 
through workshops and programs focused on creating 
a culture of innovation. Focus on the Future has produced 
a series of podcasts for the NSW Health workforce and 
communities about future ways of working, and how 
technology will intersect with healthcare in the future.

Supporting the workforce 
during the pandemic
NSW Health delivered a range of workforce 
planning and support to respond to the pandemic 
staffing requirements. 
Various additional positions and roles helped to relieve 
workforce pressures, including the Assistant in Medicine 
(AiM) position for final-year medical students. 
More than 2000 nurses undertook critical care upskilling 
and refresher courses in preparation for a surge in 
intensive care requirements as a result of the pandemic. 
Nurses have also been utilised broadly across the health 
system, leading vaccination and COVID testing, as well 
as supporting patients in the community and in health 
hotels. Nurses have rapidly established COVID-specific 
wards, caring for COVID-positive patients who 
require hospital-based care.
The nursing graduate workforce was increased in 
response to COVID, with an additional 150 positions 
targeted to support the vaccination rollout in NSW 
Health vaccination hubs. These graduates will also gain 
experience in hospital acute care, preparing them more 
broadly as a future workforce in the health system.
Budget support was provided for 318 full-time equivalent 
temporary allied health positions between April and 
December 2020. The funding intention was to prioritise 
the skilled critical care physiotherapy workforce into 
intensive care units, to lower the demand on inpatient 
hospital beds for non-COVID-19 patients and reduce wait 
lists. About 260 positions were filled, with many local 
health districts using the funding to extend the period of 
engagement and retain the roles over a 12-month period.
To increase the COVID vaccination rollout, NSW Health 
enabled a wide range of health practitioners and 
health practitioner students to be authorised to 
administer the COVID-19 vaccine to the community. 
These health practitioners and students are supported 
by additional education and work in NSW Health 
vaccination hubs. 
The Care Assistant Strategy identified low-risk 
COVID-19-related activities able to be supported by 
a person from a non-health background when given 
appropriate training. A care assistant role was 
developed as a temporary role to provide basic 
care and companionship to patients, enabling healthcare 
professionals to continue to deliver critical functions.
Support was also provided to NSW Health staff navigating 
the pandemic themselves, including a suite of internet 
resources around the themes of wellbeing, virtual 
environments, and leading in uncertain times.
The Pandemic Kindness Movement website, 
developed in 2020 by the Agency for Clinical Innovation 
with national partners, also continued to support health 
workers with peer-reviewed resources. The Pandemic 
Kindness Movement forms part of the NSW Health focus 
on elevating the human experience for everyone involved 
in receiving and providing care. The site has had over 
100,000 views since its launch.
Achieving a fit-for-purpose workforce
A sustainable health system that delivers outcomes 
that matter to patients means providing a workforce 
able to rapidly respond to community needs. To achieve 
this goal, a horizon scanning process is assisting in 
workforce planning to identify workforce requirements 
towards 2030. 
Enhancing the workforce to meet 
the needs of the community
The NSW Health Professionals Workforce Plan aims to 
ensure a fit-for-purpose workforce to provide a quality 
health service to NSW citizens. A record 51,794 full-time 
equivalent nurses and midwives were working in NSW 
Health hospitals and facilities as at June 2021 – 41,994 
nurses, 1677 midwives, and 8123 nurses and midwives 
with dual registration.
NSW Health supports the development of the enrolled 
nurse workforce through scholarship positions linked to 
areas of workforce need; 219 scholarships were awarded 
to support students to undertake enrolled nurse training 
in 2021. NSW Health has also committed $3.7 million in 
funding over four years to recruit six additional Breast 
Care Nurses for the McGrath Foundation. 
The NSW Government committed $46.8 million over 
four years in the 2020-21 state budget to create 100 
additional Wellbeing Nurse positions through the 
Wellbeing and Health In-reach Nurse Coordinator 
Program. The program is a partnership between 
NSW Health and the NSW Department of Education 
and provides a Wellbeing Nurse position in selected 
metropolitan, regional and rural communities in NSW. 
These roles will work with identified secondary and 
primary schools’ existing wellbeing and learning teams 
and local health and social services to support students 
and their families on health and wellbeing issues, 
including mental health, social and behavioural support, 
physical health, and peer or family relationships. 
In June 2021, 28 of the first tranche of 50 positions 
had been filled and 23 Wellbeing Nurses were 
working in schools.

The Student Placement Agreement was updated in 2021 
to broaden the scope of student placements in clinical and 
non-clinical areas across facilities and Health Administration 
Corporation organisations. This will enable NSW Health to 
build a pipeline of students in new and emerging fields to 
ensure we continue to attract a fit-for-purpose workforce. 
Throughout the year, NSW Ambulance used 
assessment centres in its recruitment to allow applicants 
to demonstrate their capabilities through a range of 
methods. Robust evaluation has provided insight into 
the diversity of applicants and enabled the organisation 
to identify, upskill and recruit future leaders.
Increasing diversity in the workforce
NSW Health welcomes people of diverse backgrounds 
and remains committed to maintaining a workforce 
that reflects the community it serves. We launched the 
Diversity Inclusion Belonging Resource Hub in December 
2020 to provide direction to NSW Health organisations in 
meeting the diversity and inclusion targets set under the 
Premier’s Priorities. 
The Diversity Inclusion Belonging guide acknowledges the 
elements of diversity and inclusion and the positives that 
come from individual differences, and recognises the 
crucial role a sense of belonging plays in delivering an 
effective, functioning, diverse and inclusive workplace.
Building pathways for Aboriginal employees
Employing Aboriginal staff within the health system is 
vital to ensure that culturally appropriate care is provided 
to Aboriginal people. To improve employment and career 
opportunities, NSW Health:
•	promoted and advocated for an enhanced Aboriginal 
Workforce Dashboard platform for improved visibility 
on the Aboriginal workforce data against targets
•	embedded Aboriginal workforce targets in all NSW 
Health Service Performance Agreements
•	scoped a refresh of the Good Health – Great Jobs 
Aboriginal Workforce Strategic Framework in 2021
•	continued to improve pathways for entry for Aboriginal 
people into the mental health workforce. This included 
implementation and monitoring of the Aboriginal Mental 
Health Workforce Program.
The Aboriginal Nursing and Midwifery Strategy supports 
the NSW Health commitment to increase the Aboriginal 
nursing and midwifery workforce. In 2021:
•	105 Aboriginal cadetship positions were awarded, 
with more than half of the cadets located in rural 
and regional areas
•	68 undergraduate and 14 postgraduate Aboriginal 
scholarships were awarded to support nursing and 
midwifery studies.
As part of its 2025 strategy, NSW Health Pathology has 
established a target of having three per cent of its 
workforce be Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander staff. 
The current proportion grew to 1.35 per cent in June 2021.
Improving the rural and remote 
health workforce
NSW Health continued to support and grow our workforce 
where it was needed most. To enhance the workforce to 
provide better care for rural and regional citizens we: 
•	launched a pilot for a four-year incentive package 
focused on the recruitment and retention of allied health 
professionals to areas of critical need in rural and remote 
regions. As part of the package, eligible early-career 
allied health professionals can receive an incremental 
annual contribution to a HECS-HELP loan. One of 10 
HECS/HELP incentive packages has been taken up to 
date and Far West Local Health District is in the process 
of identifying suitable positions
•	provided Rural Learning Pathways, aimed at 
strengthening pathways from education to employment 
for people in rural and regional NSW. The first phase of 
the project included investigating ways for existing staff 
to access on-site upskilling opportunities and student 
training through vocational education and training in 
schools, and student-based apprenticeships and training
•	recruited four psychology positions across 
drought-affected areas as at June 2021, part of the 
six positions identified in the 2019 NSW Government 
election commitment funding. Recruitment activities 
are continuing 
•	worked with Southern NSW Local Health District and 
Murrumbidgee Local Health District to develop a pilot of 
the Leading for Innovation Program with rural workforce 
participants to foster leadership capabilities and 
workplace innovation. 
The Nursing and Midwifery Office supported improved 
rural and regional services in 2020-21 by: 
•	coordinating recruitment, with more than 25 per cent 
of graduate nurses and midwives recruited in rural and 
regional areas, and more than 25 per cent of registered 
nurses recruited into midwifery training positions in rural 
and regional areas
•	awarding more than 1000 scholarships to NSW Health 
nurses and midwives to support postgraduate education 
across specialties, with one-third awarded in rural areas 
•	awarding more than 600 clinical placement grants 
to NSW nursing and midwifery students to support 
diversity of clinical experiences across rural and 
metropolitan areas
•	funding 10 rural postgraduate midwifery student 
scholarship positions.

Developing the allied health workforce
Allied health provides vital clinical and community 
health services to NSW citizens. Workforce planning 
projects for five different allied health professions 
were completed in 2020-21: audiology, music therapy, 
art therapy, child life therapy and diversional therapy. 
The projects explored challenges experienced across 
NSW for these smaller workforces, including limited 
profession-specific education and limited opportunities 
for career progression. They also explored 
opportunities to grow and support these allied health 
workforces in a discipline-specific context. For example, 
they explored the benefits of embedding child life 
therapists in multidisciplinary teams, and delivery 
of culturally appropriate therapies. The reports are 
located on the NSW Health allied health webpage.
Growing the genomics workforce
Genomics applies knowledge of genes and genetic 
information for the benefit of human health. The NSW 
Health Genomics Strategy forms the beginning of a 
long-term commitment by NSW Health to ensure the 
potential benefits of genomics are incorporated into the 
system effectively. Key workforce development 
achievements included delivery of career marketing 
materials on the Map my Health Career and Centre for 
Genetic Education sites, workforce scenario modelling 
using data insights and an approach to support genetics 
integration into other models of care across the system. 
NSW Health Pathology has recruited a skilled workforce 
for the provision of a statewide Clinical Genome and 
Exome Sequencing Service. Exome sequencing provides 
answers and enables improved management plans for 
many families with serious genetic conditions and couples 
planning a family. 
A workforce of nine full-time equivalent staff including 
clinical laboratory scientists, ICT development engineers, 
project and operations managers and a bioinformatician 
have developed the infrastructure and systems, including 
an in-house designed analysis pipeline required to support 
human exome and genome sequencing at scale. 
Genomics is also used to better understand the origin 
of pathogen-based outbreaks and how infectious diseases 
spread, most recently seen with COVID-19. The COVID-19 
Genomic Surveillance Program, established by the NSW 
Health Pathology Institute of Clinical Pathology and 
Medical Research, is enabled by 11 full-time equivalent 
staff and supported by eight postgraduate 
research secondments. 
From July 2020 to June 2021, the genomic surveillance 
team produced 49 reports describing 105 NSW clusters. 
Genomic analysis of individual COVID-19 cases enables 
better understanding of potential links.

Keeping Staff 
Safe - Reducing 
Needlestick Injuries
Hunter New England 
Local Health District
Healthcare workers are at increased risk of being 
exposed to blood-borne viruses through needlestick 
injuries. This was recognised as a risk at Hunter New 
England Local Health District. Despite a range of 
safety awareness initiatives being implemented, 
there was no significant reduction in exposures. 
The project aimed to reduce needlestick injuries 
through mandated use of standardised Safety 
Engineered Sharps Devices for subcutaneous 
and intramuscular injections across the District. 
Since the completion of the project, there was 
an overall reduction in needlestick injuries from 
hollow-bore needles of 31 per cent in 2019 compared 
with 2018, and this continued with a 60 per cent 
reduction (average) in 2020. Implementation of 
this strategy has the potential to save Hunter New 
England Local Health District $328,000 for the 
implementation year and more than $500,000 
ongoing. The Hunter New England Local Health 
District won the 2020 People and Culture Award 
for their achievement.

This supports contact tracing and the identification of 
clusters to provide actionable information to inform public 
health. The team works closely with Health Protection 
NSW, local public health units and other jurisdictions to 
enhance skills of healthcare professionals in pathogen 
genomics and optimise the utility of COVID-19 genomics 
for pandemic control. 
Managing talent and 
increasing capability
NSW Health is focused on supporting staff to improve 
care and services for NSW citizens. As part of this, 
our talent management roadmap included leader 
success profiles to demonstrate ‘what great looks like’ 
in key leadership positions across the system. 
During 2020, leader success profiles were developed 
for general managers. Success profiles for Director 
Allied Health, Director Nursing and Midwifery and rural 
site managers (Health Service Manager – Multipurpose 
Services) have been commissioned and will become part 
of the NSW Health Talent Strategy. These tools have 
assisted to foster talent in the current workforce, 
ensuring it is fit for purpose into the future.
Options to progress award reform to support the Future 
Health Strategy are currently being developed. Following 
further internal stakeholder consultation within NSW 
Health and across NSW Government, a broader process of 
consultation with employees, unions and other 
stakeholders is being planned.
The Aboriginal Population 
Health Training Initiative
The Aboriginal Population Health Training Initiative 
supports Aboriginal people to develop and apply public 
health skills by offering three years of workplace-based 
training and postgraduate study. In 2020-21, four trainees 
were recruited and two staff graduated with a Master 
of Public Health.
Developing workforce talent
NSW Health is committed to developing 
leadership capability in our workforce. To improve 
leadership opportunities for the Aboriginal workforce, 
a whole-of-NSW Health stretch target was established 
aimed at 16 Aboriginal people in senior leadership roles 
by 2025. The previous goal of doubling the number of 
Aboriginal people in senior leadership roles from five 
to 10 by 2025 has already been exceeded, with 11 
Aboriginal senior leaders in place by December 2020.
NSW Ambulance continued to develop a structured 
series of evidence-based programs and resources for all 
levels of leadership, as outlined in the NSW Ambulance 
Leadership Development Strategy. The strategy provides 
structured development for each level of leader, 
from potential future leaders to executive leaders. 
It provides a clear articulated program of cumulative 
leadership development where staff can readily identify 
their current level and also their aspirational target, 
with each development step in between.
This strategy has been shown to: 
•	define the expectations of leaders in NSW Ambulance
•	provide clear career pathways for staff who want to 
pursue a leadership career 
•	provide development opportunities for leaders at all 
levels and capabilities 
•	identify a talent pool of up-and-coming leaders at 
different levels
•	develop effective, engaged and compassionate leaders.
Increasing the skills and 
capabilities of our workforce
The NSW Health Workforce Forum 2020 was held virtually 
with over 840 registrations from across NSW Health and 
other government agencies. The forum focused on 
workforce restoration, recognising the inspiring work of 
NSW Health staff in 2020 amid extraordinary pressures 
from bushfires, floods, earthquakes and the pandemic. 
To enhance the mental health workforce, the Nursing and 
Midwifery Office partnered with the Health Education 
and Training Institute to develop the Mental Health 
Pathways in Practice program. This program supports 
mental health nurses and allied health professionals 
to develop their clinical capabilities to deliver best 
care to those with lived experience of mental illness. 
Three pathways have been published with a further 
two to be released in late 2021. 
The Health Education and Training Institute employed 
new training and workplace arrangements in response 
to the pandemic. These included rescheduling of 
face-to-face training to respond to system staffing 
pressures, converting and adapting face-to-face 
training and workshops for virtual delivery, 
and developing online resources to assist 
managers adapting to an online environment.
The Aboriginal Workforce Unit has engaged with 
workforce planners to support the development of 
tools, practices and priorities that enable the growth 
and development of the broader Aboriginal workforce.

The Public Health and Biostatistics 
Training Programs
The Public Health and Biostatistics Training Programs 
offer three years of supervised workplace-based training 
and provide a surge workforce able to respond to public 
health risks. In 2020-21:
•	26 public health and 18 biostatistics trainees supported 
the NSW Health COVID-19 response
•	13 new trainees were recruited
•	nine people completed their training, including four 
trainee biostatisticians who graduated with a Master of 
Biostatistics. 
Building allied health workforce capability
The Allied Health in Mental Health (AHMH) Workforce 
project report explored the current workforce to identify 
opportunities to deliver care that best meets the health 
needs of people with a lived experience of mental illness, 
their families and carers. This report has been developed 
to inform local health districts and networks, AHMH 
workforce and leaders, mental health executives and 
Ministry branches and pillar agencies to inform workforce 
planning strategies. Growth of this workforce will increase 
access to allied health expertise and benefit patients by 
improving physical healthcare, emotional wellbeing, 
functional recovery, social participation and inclusion. 
Developing financial staff capability
To meet emerging workforce capability needs, 
the NSW Ministry of Health continued to develop financial 
staff through secondment programs and workplace 
rotations, and continues to support the NSW Health 
Finance Executive Development Program. These activities 
provided staff from entry level to executive with new 
professional experiences and allowed them to develop the 
necessary skills to create value, support decision making 
and enhance financial sustainability in a rapidly evolving 
environment. After a successful pilot, the Health 
Education and Training Institute engaged the University of 
Technology Sydney to co-design and co-deliver a program 
for senior finance staff, with completion contributing 
towards a Master of Business Administration. Twenty-four 
staff have been selected for the cohort. 
Using data to improve decision making
NSW Health completed a range of economic appraisals 
to inform current and future investment decisions. 
These included economic appraisals for the treatment 
and management of wounds, direct access colonoscopy, 
renal supportive care, virtual care and hypofractionation 
for breast cancer, which allows patients to receive 
radiation treatment in fewer sessions. 
Improving health and wellbeing 
and strengthening culture for staff
Improving workplace health and safety
Ensuring the safety of our staff at work continued to be 
a high priority. In 2020-21, NSW Health participated in the 
NSW Government Work Health and Safety Sector Plan 
led by SafeWork NSW. Work began across NSW Health 
to implement its recommendations for improvements to 
security in hospitals, including toolkits, checklists and 
templates to help prevent and manage violence. Other 
ways to foster continuous improvement in security risk 
management and greater compliance with NSW Health 
security standards included a revised NSW Health 
security manual and a new security audit tool.
NSW Health continued to provide work health and safety 
advice to health organisations and unions to manage 
issues arising from the COVID-19 pandemic.
As part of its learning culture, NSW Ambulance 
established the multi-stakeholder monthly Helicopter 
Mission Review Group to enhance collaborative 
operational and safety governance. 
Strengthening culture to reflect CORE values
NSW Health strives to continuously improve workplace 
culture, with the CORE values of collaboration, 
openness, respect and empowerment as our foundation. 
In 2020-21, the Respecting the Difference staff training 
program content was reviewed, and a new web portal 
was developed to support managers across NSW Health 
to address staff grievances, concerns and potential 
misconduct quickly and constructively.
Public health organisations continued to implement 
their workplace culture and safety action plans, 
expanding these to include a range of COVID-19-specific 
wellbeing initiatives such as wellness support webpages 
and resources, workshops partnering with the Black Dog 
Institute and various webinars focusing on mental health 
in lockdown. NSW Health contributed more than 
$4.6 million to local health districts, networks 
and statewide services to fund this work.
Cultural responsiveness training was provided for 
35 employees, including allied health professionals, 
and Aboriginal Allied Health Cadetship Managers and 
supervisors to develop key capabilities and action-oriented 
approaches to addressing cultural safety for Aboriginal 
employees and patients, and their communities.

Fostering regulation, governance 
and accountability
Legal and Regulatory Services Branch core business 
is providing regulatory and compliance services across 
medicines, drugs and private hospitals. In 2020-21, 
compliance activities including receipt and management 
of complaints, conduct of investigations, and where 
appropriate regulatory action continued in a timely 
way. The NSW Health Regulators Forum met to focus 
on particular projects designed to address future 
challenges, including the increasing complexity 
and number of health-related complaints.
Work on the revision of the delegations model has 
continued, with final review and approval delayed to 
2021-22 due to the prioritisation of the management 
of the pandemic response.
NSW Health introduced a new statewide risk reporting 
framework in December 2020, with a focus on drawing 
from system expertise to identify potential statewide 
risks and their impact. 
Using this new structure, the Ministry has facilitated 
discussion forums attended by NSW Health Executive, 
NSW Health Board Chairs and members, Audit and Risk 
Committee Chairs and members, and risk practitioners, 
seeking to identify emerging risks and to review the 
control environment.
NSW Health has also worked closely with NSW Treasury 
to review existing whole-of-government risk management 
policy and guidelines.

Reducing 
Inappropriate Arterial 
Blood Gas Testing in a 
58-Bed Quaternary 
Intensive Care Unit
Northern Sydney 
Local Health District
Arterial blood gas (ABG) analysis is the most 
frequently performed test in intensive care units 
(ICUs). Blood tests are expensive and contribute 
significantly to anaemia, which affects more than 
95 per cent of ICU patients by day three of their 
admission, with half requiring blood transfusions. 
This program involved bi-weekly case-based 
in-service training over 12 weeks, 
departmental meetings, local ICU newsletter 
articles and closed social media group discussions. 
ABG testing reduced from 4.9 to 3.1 per bed per 
day and was sustained for 20 months. There was 
a 71 per cent absolute reduction in the number 
of inappropriate ABGs. This intervention will 
decrease cost, anaemia, need for transfusions, 
infection risk, sleep disruption and delirium. 
The Northern Sydney Local Health District 
won the 2020 Patient Safety First Award for 
their achievement.
Reducing inappropriate arterial blood gas 
testing in the intensive care unit was a 
focus for the Royal North Shore Hospital 
Intensive Care Unit team including,

•	The COVID-19 Research Program was launched to 
generate research evidence to support the health system 
response. More than $28 million was invested in 2020-21, 
including $4.5 million in emergency priority research 
projects, including investigation of transmission in 
schools and aged care facilities, vaccine safety, 
and serosurveillance to measure the prevalence 
of SARS-CoV-2-specific antibodies.
•	The Cancer Institute NSW enrolled 2760 participants 
into all cancer clinical trials, which included 
industry-funded studies. 
•	NSW Health continued to strengthen the focus on 
Aboriginal health in the Translational Research Grants 
Scheme. For round six of the scheme an additional 
expression of interest was accepted if it focused on 
Aboriginal or rural/remote health. The maximum number 
of submissions for each local health district was 
otherwise five. 
•	To attract talent to the field of advanced therapeutics, 
$3.2 million was awarded for 10 PhD scholarships and 
early-mid career fellowships, with projects supporting 
capability development in gene, cell and phage therapies.
•	As part of the Spinal Cord Injury Research Grants 
program, launched in 2019, seven innovative NSW 
research projects were awarded almost $15 million in 
funding over four years to improve the health of people 
with spinal cord injuries.
Maximising opportunity 
for translational research
Priority projects were rapidly funded this year to inform 
public health action in response to the ongoing pandemic. 
Work was also underway to expand the Co-Creating 
Evidence approach across NSW Health to maximise the 
use of data assets to inform decision making. The 
successful Co-Creating Evidence pilot showed that the 
approach facilitated collaborative partnerships with 
researchers to use existing NSW Health data to create 
evidence that informed health policy.

Driving research to improve 
the pandemic response
NSW Health rapidly launched the competitive, 
merit-based COVID-19 Research Grants Program 
and other initiatives to generate research evidence 
to support the health system response. 
More than $28 million was invested in COVID-19 research 
in 2020-21. This included:
•	$4.5 million on emergency priority research projects 
including urgent investigation of transmission in 
schools and aged care facilities, vaccine safety, 
and serosurveillance to measure the prevalence of 
SARS-CoV-2-specific antibodies
•	$8 million towards 17 research projects under the 
COVID-19 Research Grants Program
•	$2 million to support medical device companies affected 
by the pandemic

infrastructure and innovative projects in which leading 
NSW scientists addressed urgent priority issues. 
These included the Vaccine, Infection and Immunology 
Collaborative Research Group, NSW RNA Production 
Research Network, Waratah Vaccine Trial Alliance, 
and NSW Adaptive Platform Trials.
An interim impact evaluation conducted by the Centre 
for Epidemiology and Evidence found that within nine 
months of receiving funding, the COVID-19 Research 
Program demonstrated early evidence that it was 
contributing local knowledge to the response by funding 
priority research and rapidly translating findings. In 
addition, it was strengthening the NSW research 
ecosystem to minimise the health and social impacts of 
COVID-19.
Health sustainability research
The future sustainability of the health system is integral 
to ensure continued excellence in healthcare in an 
evolving environment. To support this, NSW Health is one 
of four key industry partners with the National Health and 
Medical Research Council (NHMRC) Partnership Centre 
for Health System Sustainability. Current and planned 
research is informing a range of work across the NSW 
health system, including the reduction of adverse drug 
events, understanding the impact of COVID-19-delayed 
elective surgery, and the use of patient-reported measures 
along the continuum of care. Themed workshops and 
learning opportunities based on the research have been 
delivered by the Partnership Centre and made available 
to NSW Health staff and clinicians.

Reducing Time 
in Seclusion in 
the Mental Health 
Intensive Care Unit
Northern Sydney 
Local Health District
The Mental Health Intensive Care Unit (MHICU), 
based on-site at Hornsby Ku-ring-gai Hospital, 
is a tertiary referral centre that provides 12 beds 
for consumers who require an intensive, 
multidisciplinary treatment program in an 
environment that cannot be provided in a 
standard acute mental health facility. Baseline data 
of 20 seclusion episodes from mid-December 2017 
to January 2018 showed a median seclusion time of 
120 minutes. Through improvements in 
documentation, specialised staff and consumer 
training, the median time a patient in the MHICU 
spent secluded was reduced by 42 per cent 
(70 minutes) within six months. Seclusion rates have 
been steadily decreasing and continue to be among 
the best in NSW, with times decreasing from six 
hours (Q2 - 2015-16) to 1.3 hours (Q2 - 2019-20). 
The Northern Sydney Local Health District won the 
2020 Excellence in the Provision of Mental Health 
Services Award for their achievement.
Hornsby Ku-ring-gai Hospital’s

Supporting research led by 
and benefiting Aboriginal people
In support of culturally appropriate research activities 
with Aboriginal people, the Centre for Aboriginal Health:
•	supported the submission of Translational Research 
Grants Scheme applications through advice to applicants 
on the implementation of guidance in the education 
module developed by the Centre. It also presented to 
scheme coordinators about developing and conducting 
Aboriginal health research. For round six of the scheme, 
an additional expression of interest per local health 
district was accepted if it focused on Aboriginal 
or rural/remote health
•	supported applications to the COVID-19 Research 
Grants Program 
•	supported the Aboriginal Health and Medical Research 
Council of NSW to enable culturally inclusive research 
activities by delivering training and development to 
Aboriginal Community Controlled Health Services staff, 
including approved continuing professional development 
training for general practice
•	collaborated with the Mental Health Branch to conduct 
an evaluation of the Building on Aboriginal Communities 
Resilience Initiative, which provides culturally safe and 
trauma-informed suicide prevention programs designed 
and led by Aboriginal people.
Positioning NSW to attract research 
funding and collaboration
Assessing the effectiveness of research helps to 
ensure high-quality research in the future. NSW Health 
has developed key performance metrics to measure the 
performance of research investments that best represent 
the grant programs as a whole. These metrics enable 
NSW to report on overarching outcomes of its 
research investments, including outputs, 
efficiency, effectiveness and equity. 
The COVID-19 pandemic has highlighted several areas 
of research strength, including emergency response 
preparedness, diagnostics, genomics, clinical trials 
and advanced medical manufacturing capability. 
NSW is a globally recognised leader in developing and 
delivering advanced therapeutics, including gene phage 
and cell therapies such as CAR T cells. NSW Health is 
strategically investing in tools, talent and translation 
of gene, phage and cell therapies to accelerate research 
progress and patient access to these potentially 
life-saving therapies. To attract talent to the field, 
$3.2 million was awarded for 10 PhD scholarships and 
early-mid career fellowships, with projects supporting 
capability development in gene, cell and phage therapies.
In 2020-21, NSW Health continued to promote these 
strengths to health and medical research communities 
internationally through our International Desk activities 
including Asian Medical Week and the BIO Digital 
annual conference. 
NSW Health has begun planning for an advanced 
viral vector manufacturing facility to support this work. 
External consultants were engaged to complete early 
stage design and feasibility assessment for the 
manufacturing facility, as well as develop a business 
case and plan, and begin a market sounding process. 
Funding and support to 
maximise research opportunities
Supporting research ultimately fosters innovation and 
improved care. In 2020-21, NSW Health provided $1.8 
million to the Sax Institute to improve decision makers’ 
use of research evidence, including brokering evidence 
reviews on health system priorities and building skills 
in appraising evidence.
Since 2014, NSW Health has provided a Health 
Cluster Evaluation Schedule to NSW Treasury outlining 
evaluation activity undertaken. In 2020-21, the schedule 
was replaced by an evidence bank reporting process 
designed to share evidence generated through 
evaluations across NSW Government. 
Funding for spinal cord injury research
As part of the Spinal Cord Injury Research Grants 
program, launched in 2019, seven innovative NSW 
research projects were awarded almost $15 million in 
funding over four years to improve the health of people 
with spinal cord injuries.
Facilitating high-impact research
In line with the NSW Health focus on delivering better 
outcomes for patients and building research capability, 
round six of the Translational Research Grants Scheme 
required applicants to demonstrate how their research 
would support the delivery of value based healthcare. 
In 2020-21, a guide was developed to identify system 
priority areas for which NSW Health needs further 
evidence to support the design and implementation 
of value based healthcare across the state. The guide 
aims to inform researchers seeking to align their work 
with contemporary and practical policy challenges 
faced by the healthcare system and support researchers 
seeking partnership with NSW Health on value based 
healthcare research.

Connecting industry innovation and research
eHealth NSW continued to undertake digital health 
research in partnership with stakeholders across NSW 
Health, external researchers and partner organisations. 
New processes were introduced to improve coordination 
and partnering in research projects. A key focus was 
research requiring information and communication 
technology integration with NSW Health business and 
clinical systems and translating research into practice.
In parallel, eHealth NSW continued to work with the 
Agency for Clinical Innovation and the Ministry to develop 
a blueprint and business case for the Healthcare 
Innovation Venture Enablement (HIVE) service and 
consortium. HIVE seeks to outline how NSW Health can 
support a thriving healthcare innovation ecosystem. Its 
vision is to make NSW Health a centre of innovation, 
leveraging and enhancing existing programs to catalyse 
innovation more effectively and efficiently. 
Driving translational research
Translational research involves applying discoveries 
generated during laboratory research and preclinical 
studies to a clinical setting. It also aims to promote best 
practices in the community. 
Over 20 Translational Research Grants Scheme projects 
have been completed and have started implementing 
findings. NSW Health is documenting barriers and 
enablers to implementation to inform decisions about an 
ongoing governance structure.
To drive translational research forward, the Office for 
Health and Medical Research:
•	built health system research and evaluation capacity by 
supporting the rapid rollout of urgent COVID-19 research 
to inform the pandemic response, by piloting research 
impact assessment methods and by educating 
researchers and clinicians to focus on implementation 
strategies from project inception
•	worked with the Centre for Epidemiology and Evidence 
to adapt a research impact framework with the Hunter 
Medical Research Institute to measure research 
translation and impact of research funding. 
The framework has been applied to the Prevention 
Research Support Program, COVID-19 Research 
Program and round one of the Translational 
Research Grants Scheme.
The Agency for Clinical Innovation supported and 
assessed several translational research grant proposals. 
Strategies for building health system research (HSR) 
capacity included leading the COVID-19 Critical 
Intelligence Unit’s Research Intelligence Group, 
participating in developing a priority list of Office for 
Health and Medical Research COVID-19 grant round 
themes, and initiating a NSW HSR Steering Committee. 
The agency also partnered with advanced health research 
and translation centres on several implementation science 
proposals and funded studies for the NHMRC, the Medical 
Research Future Fund and other grants.
The Population and Public Health Research Group 
supported and promoted a number of strategies to 
build research and evaluation capability in NSW Health. 
Workshops on evaluation, economic evaluation and 
program logic were attended by 270 NSW Health staff. 
Checklists on planning and reviewing economic 
evaluations were developed and are available online 
within the Population Health Guidance Series.
Leading the way in clinical trials
Conducting clinical trials provided important opportunities 
for NSW researchers and citizens to participate in the 
development of innovative medical treatment. In 2020-21, 
NSW Health established an Australian Commission on 
Safety and Quality in Health Care Clinical Trials 
Governance Framework working group, which included 
representatives from local health districts and specialty 
networks. It was designed to support a consistent and 
collaborative approach to implementation of the 
framework, including best-practice sharing. The pilot 
sites – St Vincent’s Hospital Sydney, Sydney Local Health 
District and Orange Base Hospital – presented their 
experience to the NSW Health Embedding Quality 
Research in Local Health Districts meeting in early 2021.
ClinicaltrialsNSW continued to implement a range of 
strategies to enable clinical trial capacity, capability and 
collaboration and deliver a mature clinical trial sector 
within the NSW public health system.
The Cancer Institute NSW: 
•	had 184 portfolio (investigator-initiated) cancer clinical 
trials open to recruitment in NSW, with 1348 participants 
enrolled into portfolio trials
•	enrolled 2760 participants into all cancer clinical trials, 
which included industry-funded studies
•	released a Canrefer feature to assist users to find cancer 
clinical trials in their area that were currently or about to 
recruit participants.

Linking data to enable research
Enabling access to data
The Centre for Health Record Linkage released 2.46 billion 
records to support research and analytics including to 
successful applicants for the Biospecimen Collection 
Grants. The Centre also worked to refine governance 
arrangements to enhance researchers’ access to data. 
The Cancer Institute NSW gained ethics approval to link 
patient reported measures data into linked datasets for 
future analysis, and commenced an amendment to add 
smoking cessation to the Master Linked Dataset.
The Institute developed and agreed to a 2021 data linkage 
schedule with the Centre for Health Record Linkage, 
which will increase the number of annual linkages of 
the NSW Clinical Cancer Public Health Register and the 
National Master Linkage Key with NSW cancer 
incidence data. 
The Agency for Clinical Innovation established a 
working group to scope minimum data requirements for 
clinical quality registries (CQRs), ensuring that clinical, 
administrative and patient data is captured to improve 
outcomes. Further work is underway to determine the 
exact data-capture mechanisms of the prioritised cohorts 
and future opportunity costs for supporting the approach 
to CQRs.
NSW Health Pathology launched its Research Governance 
Framework in January 2021. A five-year implementation 
plan will guide the framework’s development and included 
the release of up to 33 procedures, guidelines and forms. 
These will set standards to improve research quality and 
safeguard the public by promoting best practice and 
performance, as well as enhancing ethical and scientific 
quality. They included the: 
•	Research Code of Conduct 
•	Research Complaints Form 
•	Data Management procedure 
•	Research Governance procedure 
•	Site Specific Assessment (SSA) Checklist/Form 
•	Tissue Block release policy 
•	Standard Operating Procedures (SOPs) for Clinical Trials.

Key achievements
•	eHealth NSW and the Agency for Clinical Innovation 
worked together on the Virtual Care Accelerator initiative 
to support local health districts and specialty networks 
to optimise their use of virtual care across NSW Health. 
•	In 2020, NSW Health was allocated $39.8 million 
to implement the real-time prescription monitoring 
system SafeScript NSW; enhance regulatory tools; 
and undertake a program of proactive regulatory reforms 
as part of NSW’s national commitment to reducing harm 
associated with the misuse of monitored medicines. 
SafeScript NSW will support prescribers and 
pharmacists to identify at-risk patients by 
providing information about medication history. 
•	The Clinical Excellence Commission continued work on 
the Quality Improvement Data System (QIDS) to provide 
tools and resources for clinicians and managers to 
monitor data about hospital-acquired complications 
and improve the delivery of safer care. By June 2021, 
the QIDS had more than 36,100 users, 14,651 improvement 
project topics and around 15,000 reports generated 
every month. 
•	More than 28,000 patients benefited from better 
care with the electronic record for intensive care 
(eRIC) system. Funding has been secured to extend 
eRIC to 11 neonatal and paediatric intensive care units 
over the next two years.
•	The business case for the Single Digital Patient 
Record (SDPR) was developed and budget funding 
was secured for three years. SDPR will transform the 
way health information is captured across hospitals 
and health services.
Deploying new information technology 
systems across NSW Health
NSW Health is committed to continue enhancing our 
technology to support better patient care. eHealth 
NSW implemented its new radiology information 
system, picture archive and communication system 
in eight hospitals across Nepean Blue Mountains, 
Northern Sydney and Central Coast local health 
districts. It also successfully piloted the electronic 
transfer of care (eTOC) medications reconciliation 
application in four hospitals.
The ongoing rollout of the electronic record for intensive 
care (eRIC) system enabled more than 28,000 patients 
to benefit from better care. Funding has been secured 
to extend eRIC to 11 neonatal and paediatric intensive 
care units over the next two years.

The second phase of the Clinical Health Information 
Exchange (CHIE) onboarded the Enterprise Patient 
Registry, Sydney Children’s Hospitals Network, 
and Western Sydney and Nepean Blue Mountains 
local health districts. The patient and clinical 
information shared in the CHIE supports patient 
care across these districts.
The electronic medication management (eMeds) 
program neared completion, with go-lives at Barraba 
Multiple-Purpose Service, Liverpool Hospital, 
Campbelltown Hospital and Camden Hospital. 
Meanwhile, the Single Digital Patient Record program 
will transform the way health information is captured 
across hospitals and health services, improving patient 
safety and enhancing clinician experience with electronic 
medical record systems. This year, its business case was 
developed and budget funding was secured for three 
years. Tender documents for the program, including the 
proposed statewide laboratory information management 
system for NSW Health Pathology, were formally issued 
to the market in June 2021.
Building virtual care and 
videoconferencing capability
A focus for the future is ensuring virtual care and 
videoconferencing allow the delivery of health 
services to meet the changing needs of the community.
In 2020-21, eHealth NSW and the Agency for Clinical 
Innovation worked together on the Virtual Care 
Accelerator initiative to support local health districts and 
specialty networks to optimise their use of virtual care 
across NSW Health. These activities included:
•	upgrading 125 critical care cameras across NSW
•	deploying 1800 iPads to various settings across 
NSW Health for frontline clinical functions relevant 
to caring for patients with COVID-19, particularly 
focused on isolated patients in hospitals, intensive care 
units and palliative care. iPads were also allocated 
to COVID-19 vaccination hubs across the state
•	continuing the rollout of the virtual clinical waiting room 
solution, myVirtualCare
•	supporting five new and eight existing remote patient 
monitoring programs
•	documenting and sharing six virtual care initiatives 
to assist local health districts and specialty networks 
to implement local virtually enabled models of care.
A virtual care dashboard and application were 
launched to provide the system with data on the 
volume of non-admitted services for patients involving 
videoconferencing or telehealth at the local health 
district, facility and clinic level. 
Improving the Electronic Medical Record
We continued to deliver initiatives to enhance the 
functionality of our current electronic medical 
records (eMR). This year, these included: 
•	the Drug Burden Index (DBI) tool, which was piloted 
at Royal North Shore Hospital. The tool is included in 
a patient’s eMR and is used to measure the functional 
burden of an older person’s medications to reduce 
adverse drug events including falls, poorer physical 
function, frailty, mortality and cognitive impairment
•	the Heparin Infusion Management module, which was 
piloted at Nepean, Westmead, Blacktown, Mt Druitt 
and Auburn hospitals. This solution supports clinical 
workflows to prevent and manage venous and 
arterial thromboembolism 
•	the Oncology Information Systems Integration 
Project, which was completed. 
eHealth NSW also developed an eMR strategy and 
future state for NSW Ambulance, in partnership with the 
Agency for Clinical Innovation and local health districts. 
This work included:
•	developing a suitable solution following 2021-22 budget 
funding to deliver in-ambulance monitor/defibrillators 
that improve eMR integration capabilities between NSW 
Ambulance and hospital emergency departments across 
the state, including regional areas
•	developing a business case to stabilise the existing NSW 
Ambulance eMR platform before it is replaced with a 
mobile solution.
Improving experiences of outpatient services
NSW Health is the largest provider of outpatient services 
in Australia, with more than 8000 outpatient service units 
providing over 18 million clinical service events in 2020-21. 
Outpatient services are a critical interface between the 
hospital and primary care systems, and an important 
ongoing component in a patient’s care pathway. 
NSW Health has prioritised the development 
of information technology systems, improvement of 
data quality and development of clinical referral 
criteria for referrers. These initiatives will contribute 
to improving the patient and referrer experience 
when accessing outpatient services. 
In 2020-21, eHealth NSW, with the NSW Ministry of 
Health and local health district clinicians, started to build 
a statewide digital outpatient referral management and 
simplified appointments system. This system will ensure 
referrals from a general practitioner to a hospital 
outpatient clinic are more efficiently created, 
delivered and managed.

Supporting integrated health 
services and information sharing
To improve clinicians’ and patients’ experience of care 
and their health outcomes, eHealth NSW partnered with 
the Ministry’s Integrated Care team to shape the direction 
of the shared care planning system. A working group 
published recommendations for a statewide approach 
for the system across health, consumer and social care 
settings. To drive the implementation of a digital solution 
to support shared care planning, stakeholders will come 
together in 2021-22 to oversee system road mapping.
Supporting maternal and child health
eHealth NSW continued to lead the National Children’s 
Digital Health Collaborative in partnership with Sydney 
Children’s Hospitals Network, Western NSW Local 
Health District and the Australian Digital Health Agency. 
The Child Digital Health Record 0-4-year-old pilot, 
which enables health check assessments from GP 
and community centres to be sent to a parent’s 
mobile phone, onboarded 141 mothers and 202 
children to test and evaluate the system. 
Work also continued on the Digital Pregnancy Health 
Record, with antenatal data captured from GP and 
private hospital visits and displayed in the consumer app. 
Monitoring medications
The Real Time Prescription Monitoring (RTPM) 
Management Portal went live in June 2021, 
providing the NSW Health regulatory team real-time 
access to prescribing and dispensing events for 
monitored medicines.
In 2020, NSW Health was allocated $39.8 million to 
implement the real-time prescription monitoring system 
SafeScript NSW; enhance regulatory tools; and undertake 
a program of proactive regulatory reforms as part of 
NSW’s national commitment to reducing harm 
associated with the misuse of monitored medicines. 
SafeScript NSW interacts with the National Data 
Exchange and will support prescribers and pharmacists 
to identify at-risk patients by providing information 
about medication history. 
A phased rollout will begin in late 2021 across the Hunter 
New England and Central Coast regions. By early 2022, 
all eligible health practitioners in NSW will be able to 
access the system.
NSW Health continues to engage with consumer 
organisations, general practitioners, community 
pharmacists, pain management specialists, and drug 
and alcohol specialists to ensure the solution meets 
their requirements. 
Enhancing health analytics
To improve insights and decision making, eHealth NSW 
developed a pool of raw data to facilitate rapid, secure and 
appropriate access to NSW Health data contained within 
frontline clinical and corporate systems. This has enabled 
local health district chief executives and chief information 
officers to improve local accessibility to their raw clinical 
and corporate data and make data-driven, local decisions. 
eHealth NSW worked with the Agency for Clinical 
Innovation to facilitate design and requirements 
workshops that explored the possibility of centralising 
NSW Health’s clinical quality registries to 
improve accessibility. 
NSW Health Pathology progressed initiatives to ensure 
pathology is used to maximum advantage across the 
NSW Health system. The Pathology Atlas of Variation 
merged pathology testing with emergency department 
and intensive care unit data to give clinicians statewide, 
peer-based analysis. The initial phase identified 
variation and initiated improvement projects. 
Patient Flow Portal
The Ministry has delivered numerous updates to the 
Patient Flow Portal to:
•	support the NSW Health COVID-19 response with 
managing COVID patients in and out of hospital
•	provide a modern, data-driven solution that is easily 
scalable and adaptable to meet NSW Health’s business 
needs around care coordination, patient flow and the 
performance of the NSW Health system in real time
•	streamline the bed cleaning process and communication 
between clinicians and support staff
•	integrate data from numerous systems to provide the 
visibility of all incoming patients into a facility to remove 
the need for paper and faxes, with this functionality 
being rolled out to 23 facilities
•	support the Integrated Care Program, to risk stratify 
the population to determine the likelihood of previous 
NSW Health patients presenting to a public hospital in 
the next 12 months who could benefit from a community 
care program.

Development of quality improvement data
The Clinical Excellence Commission continued work on 
the Quality Improvement Data System (QIDS) and Quality 
Audit Reporting System (QARS), which are electronic tools 
to improve the quality and safety of healthcare provided 
by local health districts, specialty health networks, 
pillars and NSW Health service providers. 
By June 2021, the QIDS had:
•	more than 36,100 users
•	14,651 improvement project topics
•	around 15,000 reports generated every month. 
In collaboration with HealthShare NSW the Commission 
conducted 196 reviews totalling 430 personal protective 
equipment product assessments and delivered weekly 
personal protective equipment audits via the QARS for 
local health districts and specialty health networks.
EDWARD implementation
Enterprise Patient Repository (EPR) and the Enterprise 
Data Warehouse for Analysis, Reporting and Decision 
support (EDWARD) program worked together to provide 
linkage across NSW Health clinical datasets. This work 
includes increasing data quality reporting on identifier 
data issues and collaborating with local health districts 
to address missing or incorrectly recorded data.
Violence, Abuse and Neglect, and Child, 
Youth and Family services
eHealth NSW collaborated with the Ministry, local health 
districts and specialty networks to develop clinical system 
solutions to improve insights using data. The Violence, 
Abuse and Neglect data assets were established, 
and forms were rolled out to capture data on NSW 
Health’s responses to all types of violence, 
abuse and neglect. 
NSW Health is strengthening the availability of data 
for Violence, Abuse and Neglect and Child, Youth and 
Family services by extending the essential data 
warehouse capacity. This will increase capacity to 
report on admitted and non-admitted patient data. 
The build into collection systems is underway and 
the collection will be rolled out in 2021-22.
Enhancing community access 
to digital health information
Enhancing HealtheNet and My Health Record
NSW Health continued to increase the number of 
documents and amount of information submitted 
to My Health Record, so that consumers have more 
comprehensive information about their care. It also 
meant that NSW Health clinicians and GPs had more 
information to inform their care of patients. 
In 2020-21:
•	1,838,675 discharge summaries were delivered to 
My Health Record 
•	16,214 letters were delivered to My Health Record
•	23,802,418 pathology results were delivered to 
My Health Record
•	1,559,115 radiology reports were delivered to 
My Health Record
•	1,668,057 discharge summaries were delivered to GPs 
•	1,346,403 letters were delivered to GPs.
To drive the increased the use of My Health Record, 
eHealth NSW partnered with the Australian Digital 
Health Agency on two initiatives: 
•	to develop emergency department speciality-based 
views in the HealtheNet Clinical Portal, bringing together 
the most relevant clinical information from My Health 
Record and NSW clinical systems
•	to operationalise and promote the new Clinical Document 
Delivery service by enabling local health districts to 
electronically transfer health and outpatient discharge 
summaries, event summaries and specialist letters 
to HealtheNet.
In addition, eHealth NSW collaborated with other 
jurisdictions to contribute to the draft National mHealth 
Assessment Framework. It also published a user guide in 
July 2020 to provide guidance for clinicians for the safe 
use of My Health Record and the HealtheNet system. 
To measure and benchmark eMR feedback from 
clinicians, a KLAS survey was conducted to investigate 
ways of optimising the use of eMR systems. All local 
health districts and specialty networks contributed, 
with 5914 responses submitted. Survey data provided 
key insights into the eMR user experience, which will 
be used to improve clinician satisfaction and usability 
of eMR systems.

Ensuring the safe use of My Health Record
NSW Health understands the privacy concerns of NSW 
citizens. To ensure privacy of health records remained a 
priority, the Clinical Excellence Commission collaborated 
with eHealth NSW to monitor and improve the safety and 
quality of use of all electronic health records across the 
continuum of care. This includes the use and contributions 
to My Health records and launch of electronic tools such 
as the Patient Friendly Medication List. The Safety and 
Quality Oversight Committee, which is co-chaired by 
eHealth NSW and the Commission, is the peak body 
reviewing the safety and quality of electronic health 
records. The review process includes regular reporting 
of risk mitigation strategies related to incidents which 
may result in harm.
Publicly available data from NSW Health
The NSW Health Open Data website was launched in 
March 2020. It includes a search function and navigation 
to NSW Health open data sources and key reports. 
Since July 2020, the site has had 26,000 visitors. 
HealthStats NSW provides open access to a wide 
range of health data. Enhancements in 2021 included 
more interactive data visualisation and analysis tools 
and greater ability to download customised reports. 
In 2020-21, the HealthStats NSW website had around 
60,000 users and more than 550,000 webpage views. 
HealthStats NSW is regularly updated as new data 
becomes available and there are currently around 70,000 
dynamically generated links to downloadable data files.
In June 2021, the Bureau of Health Information launched 
its new Data Portal, part of a transition to a digital-first 
way of reporting healthcare performance results in NSW 
to make them more accessible. Healthcare Quarterly 
results were the first to be included in the new portal. 
The Bureau publishes all its results on its website in 
accessible formats, including a hospital performance 
dashboard. There were more than 80,000 visits to the 
Bureau website in 2020-21.
Improving corporate services 
and systems
HealthShare NSW began implementation of an auto 
reconciliation and automated financial task management 
system, which enhances the user experience by reducing 
the time taken on routine manual tasks. Five fixed asset 
categories and 13 accounts receivable reconciliations 
have been implemented so far.
New platforms and systems
In 2020-21, improved systems were rolled out to continue 
to increase efficiency for our stakeholders. For example:
•	a new statewide pathology billing system was launched, 
replacing multiple legacy billing applications
•	NSW Health Pathology published and improved 
its information governance framework in 2020-21. 
Enterprise architecture standards were also published, 
and a chief Security Architect was employed to update 
security management processes and achieve 
ISO27001 certification
•	the statewide deployment of a staff Performance 
and Talent (PAT) system was completed following 
extensive consultation with local health districts 
and NSW Health organisations
•	in April 2021, eHealth NSW launched a new recruitment 
and onboarding project for Junior Medical Officers 
•	a mobile app was deployed for NSW Health in 
February 2021, enabling Junior Medical Officers to 
create, submit and monitor their unrostered overtime 
and call-back claims more easily
•	ServiceNow/SARA was rolled out across NSW Health 
as our workflow and services management platform. 
Staff used it to raise 456,000 IT incidents, 1,141,000 HR 
cases, 106,000 finance cases and 28,000 IT changes. 
The platform also hosted an additional 4550 knowledge 
articles. The SARA Virtual Assistant was launched in 
August 2020 to provide a new channel for staff to find 
information 24/7, on any device. The statewide service 
desk answered 508,622 calls 
•	the digital system to fast-track frontline worker 
vaccinations was made available for public bookings, and 
by mid-2021 was in use at 64 clinics across 14 local 
health districts and specialty networks, capturing more 
than 675,000 registrations
•	our Vaccination Administration Management system was 
launched. By mid-2021, more than 21,000 appointments 
had been booked and 3646 people had been vaccinated 
using the system.

Collaborative Staff Member of the Year 
Award winner
Rita Williams
The Sydney Children’s 
Hospitals Network
Rita Williams worked for more than 30 years in 
the Social Work Department at the Children’s 
Hospital at Westmead before she moved to 
the newly established Aboriginal Health Unit. 
An inspirational and proud Aboriginal woman, 
she made a journey of community collaboration 
across NSW to talk about kidney health and 
chronic disease. This led to the establishment 
of a public health surveillance program looking 
at kidney health in Aboriginal and non-Aboriginal 
children. Rita is always willing to share the painful 
history of Aboriginal health following her experiences 
of Aboriginal children being segregated from 
non-Aboriginal children at Royal Alexandra Hospital 
for Children at Camperdown. A testament to Rita’s 
work was the establishment of the Antecedents 
of Renal Disease in Aboriginal Children and Young 
People Study in 2002, which progressed into an 
18-year prospective, population-based cohort study, 
involving 3758 young people (2155 Aboriginal and 
1603 non-Aboriginal) across NSW. This is an example 
of self-determination for communities to develop 
Indigenous-specific interventions to change the 
story of chronic disease in our mob. Congratulations 
to Rita for winning the 2020 Collaborative Staff 
Member of the Year Award.
Enhancing infrastructure, 
security and intelligence
With a focus on meeting our future needs, eHealth NSW 
continued to work closely with NSW Health organisations 
towards sustainable ICT infrastructure solutions 
to support a digitally enabled healthcare system. 
The Health Grade Enterprise Network program 
piloted new operational and sourcing models for local 
ICT network infrastructure across Westmead Health 
Precinct, Coffs Harbour Hospital and our offices 
at St Leonards.
This year, eHealth NSW: 
•	continued to refresh critical ICT infrastructure platforms 
to cloud services. This included implementing Amazon 
Web Services, Azure Cloud services, and Microsoft 365 
services and capabilities
•	enhanced cyber security tools and operations 
capabilities across NSW Health. This included identifying 
and managing cyber incidents using global monitoring, 
email pattern analysis and collaboration with local health 
district IT teams
•	continued to monitor statewide systems and worked 
with other government agencies to respond to cyber 
security issues and risks, which increased due to a 
rise in opportunistic attacks related to COVID-19
•	provided support for a cyber security awareness and 
training program for all NSW Health staff. This included 
a new mandatory Cyber Fundamentals module as well as 
other cyber security modules and workshops for staff
•	finalised a new NSW Health Microsoft Enterprise 
Agreement in June 2021. This will enable NSW Health 
to implement best-in-class security policies for staff.

Implementing the Health 
Infrastructure Strategy
In July 2020, NSW Health finalised the State-wide 
Investment and Prioritisation Framework. The framework 
supports the Health Infrastructure Strategy and provides 
health organisations with guidance on the types of future 
investment proposals required to respond to the long-term 
challenges facing the health system. It sets out investment 
principles to guide local planning; a new collaborative 
planning approach; and criteria to assess and prioritise 
capital investment proposals from 2021. NSW Health 
has implemented these aspects of the framework 
through the 2021 Capital Investment Planning Process. 
NSW Health also finalised the first implementation plan 
for the strategy. A key aspect is improving the tools and 
evidence provided to health service planners to support 
analysis of more options earlier in the planning cycle.

To support this, a public-facing virtual care website 
was established and included patient, carer and clinician 
stories. Over 6000 people have viewed the site since 
its launch in January 2021. 
Working with the Agency for Clinical Innovation, 
eHealth NSW supported local health districts and 
specialty networks to optimise the use of virtual care 
in line with the Future Health Strategy and the eHealth 
Strategy for NSW Health 2016-2026. The Agency 
partnered with the Ministry, eHealth NSW and other 
stakeholders to establish the Virtual Care Accelerator 
program, which has identified virtual care initiatives that 
could be expanded to support the COVID-19 response. 
The program worked to address gaps in capability and 
support change management across local health 
districts and specialty health networks, building a 
better foundation for future virtual care innovation 
to support clinical care and patient choice. 
Uptake of the myVirtualCare platform grew statewide, 
with 3148 clinicians providing 30,105 consultations. 
Pilots of myVirtualCare for rural endocrinology services 
were also launched at Walgett Aboriginal Medical Service 
and Broken Hill District Hospital. Optimising provision of 
in-reach and outreach special virtual care across different 
care settings was prioritised in support of the NSW Health 
focus on value based healthcare and improving the patient 
and carer experience. The Virtual Care Accelerator also 
scoped opportunities to implement virtual care in 
non-admitted care settings and provided funding 
for Australia’s first specific virtual paediatric service, 
virtualKIDS, managed through the Sydney Children’s 
Hospitals Network. 
Virtual care initiatives in response to COVID-19 included 
remote monitoring of COVID-19-positive patients and 
vulnerable high-risk COVID-19-negative patients in 
the community, and a major upgrade of the critical 
care camera network to augment emergency 
department capacity and services. 
The NSW Telestroke Service celebrated its first 
anniversary, with 11 sites now available across the state 
at Port Macquarie, Coffs Harbour, Lismore, Orange, 
Dubbo, Bathurst, Shoalhaven, Grafton, Griffith, 
Tweed Heads and Deniliquin. 
Collaborative technology solutions continued to be 
deployed across the state. By end 2020-21, more than 
80 per cent of NSW Health employees had been provided 
with virtual conferencing technology. eHealth NSW 
supported 3,888,949 audio/video calls and 3,300,334 
scheduled audio/video meetings. 
Infrastructure collaboration across 
the health system
The Ministry implemented a new collaborative 
planning approach in March 2021 with a series of 
capital investment planning meetings with each Health 
organisation. These meetings formed a key aspect of 
Stage 0 of the new Facility Planning Process, which 
ensures support services and precinct planning are 
integrated into capital planning and development 
from the outset of projects.
Participation from shared health services 
(Health Infrastructure, HealthShare NSW, eHealth NSW 
and NSW Health Pathology) allowed each organisation 
to explore, test and discuss service planning options 
with a wider group of stakeholders. This early and 
ongoing collaboration has informed the development 
of health organisations’ capital investment proposals 
for 2021, which the Ministry will assess according to the 
State-wide Investment and Prioritisation Framework.
Working closely with Health Infrastructure, local health 
districts, specialty networks and pillars, eHealth NSW 
supported the introduction of a new asset management 
framework and the development of strategic asset 
management plans. eHealth NSW continues to review 
ICT strategies and plans contained within health 
organisation clinical service plans and business cases. 
Support for integrated planning across 
government agencies
Place-based integrated planning with other NSW 
Government agencies remains a key focus for 
NSW Health. In 2020-21, Health Infrastructure 
developed a discussion paper on place-planning 
in a health setting, which will inform the development 
of a guide. It also completed a discussion paper that 
explores the issues, barriers and risks for precinct 
governance at Health Innovation Precincts in NSW. 
The overarching governance structure is now in place 
for NSW Health precinct interfaces and deliverables, 
with the establishment of the NSW Health Precinct 
Steering Committee reporting to the Future Health 
Program Delivery Board. In 2020-21, work continued 
at the four identified Health Innovation Precincts at 
Randwick, Tech Central (incorporating Camperdown), 
Westmead and Liverpool to progress plans, 
including the Randwick precinct’s four-year strategy. 
Health Infrastructure also completed the draft 
Health Precinct Strategy that defines its approach 
to place-based planning, along with a timeline for 
developing a new framework for strategic 
partnerships and investments.

Work has begun on a new commercial framework to guide 
the identification, planning and delivery of commercial 
partnerships and related transactions for health places 
and precincts.
In addition, Health Infrastructure has worked with 
Investment NSW and Greater Sydney Commission to 
identify and promote economic development opportunities 
within precincts and contributed to the COVID-19 Recovery 
Plan with support into the OneGov group. 
It also continued coordination of the NSW Health input 
into updated state strategies on land use, infrastructure, 
transport, jobs creation, industry attraction and services. 
HealthShare NSW collaborated with other statewide 
Health agencies to adopt a more holistic approach 
to infrastructure planning and asset management. 
Through its Capital, Assets and Service Planning group, 
it has ensured support service delivery is considered 
during the earliest stages of health infrastructure 
planning. This facilitates better-value outcomes and, 
more importantly, ensures more effective delivery 
of hospital services to enhance patient care.
NSW Health Pathology led and participated in meetings 
about integrated capital redevelopments involving the 
NSW Ministry of Health, Health Infrastructure, local health 
districts and others. Promotion of its Clinical Services 
Plan and Laboratory Design Guidelines to these 
groups resulted in six capital investment proposals, 
one investment decision document draft and inaugural 
NSW Health Pathology strategic asset management 
and asset management plans. 
Asset management planning
In 2020-21, significant progress was made with the 
Asset Management Policy for the NSW Public Sector 
through the development of the NSW Health Asset 
Management Framework. Key achievements included 
development of foundational assessments and plans 
to guide a coordinated, consistent approach to asset 
planning and management across NSW Health.
Work also progressed to integrate asset management 
and new requirements in Health Infrastructure capital 
project planning and delivery through the Facility Planning 
Process Implementation Project. This project will continue 
in 2021-22 to ensure capital assets are fit for purpose, 
future focused, and enable high-quality and safe care.

Priority 8
Build financial 
sustainability and 
deliver business 
improvements
In 2020-21, NSW Health 
continued to build financial 
sustainability and staff capability 
across the health system. 
In doing so, we strengthened service provisions, achieved 
value in procurement, improved governance, accountability 
and risk management, and commissioned non-clinical 
services for better value. A priority was to enhance our 
financial systems to ensure the efficient and effective 
management of healthcare services for the people of 
NSW. In mid-2020, 10 health organisations were brought 
together within one location at St Leonards to further 
improve collaboration and productivity.
Our priorities 
8.1	 
Deliver financial control in the 
day-to-day operations 
8.2	 
Develop sustainable funding for future growth 
8.3	 
Drive value in procurement 
8.4	 
Deliver commercial programs 
8.5	 
Enhance productivity using new ways of 
working with the relocation to 1 Reserve Road
Key achievements
•	NSW Health achieved an overall procurement financial 
savings of $31.4 million during financial year 2020-21. 
•	NSW Health data committees continued to collaborate 
across functional areas to identify links and enhance 
and drive best practice in data governance. The NSW 
Health five-year vision for corporate analytics continued 
to create value and improve decision making through 
enhanced data insights. 
•	In 2020-21, NSW Health continued to support the 
application of activity based management and better 
understand the cost of services provided to patients 
and the community.
•	HealthShare NSW is developing a Sustainability Strategy 
in collaboration with the NSW Department of Planning, 
Industry and Environment. The strategy includes actions 
to improve resource efficiency and deliver operational 
cost savings.
•	In mid-2020, 10 NSW Health organisations were 
relocated to new premises at 1 Reserve Road, 
St Leonards. Benefits of the new activity-based 
agile working environment have included standardised 
technical support with the eHealth NSW Connect IT 
hub and knowledge-sharing through centralised 
groups including the Young Professionals Network 
and Communities of Practice. 
Delivering financial control through 
enhanced budgeting and reporting
NSW Health continued to prioritise outcome-based 
budgeting methodology in line with the NSW Government 
framework to provide an enhanced platform for 
governance and system financial sustainability. This focus 
supported a strategic financial view, enhanced budgeting, 
and performance indicators aligned with State Outcomes. 
Outcome-based performance and budget information was 
part of the 2021-22 budget process. 
NSW Health continued to implement Outcome Budgeting 
in 2020-21 in line with NSW Treasury Policy and Guideline 
Paper - Outcome Budgeting, TPP 18-09 (TPP), which sets 
the framework for the way resources are managed and 
budget decisions are made across the NSW public sector.
The NSW Ministry of Health and Health Infrastructure 
have developed a framework to capture the recurrent 
impacts of capital investment, with the resulting 
data used for budget negotiations with NSW Treasury. 
This has increased understanding of the impacts of these 
investments across the health system to address 
associated costs. 
NSW Health	
Annual Report 2020-21   :  Performance   :  page 52


NSW Health continued to support the application 
of activity based management. Managers, clinicians 
and other staff across NSW Health organisations were 
supported to better understand the cost of services 
being provided to patients and the community by 
comparing their services and service trends with other 
Health organisations, and by identifying areas where 
patient care could be improved. This enabled evidence-
based operational and management decisions.
NSW Health’s focus on revenue declines was 
largely put on hold this year because of the ongoing 
COVID-19 response. 
Embedding new accounting standards
In 2020-21, one new accounting standard was implemented: 
AASB 1059 Service concession arrangements: Grantors 
(AASB 1059). This standard applies to service 
concession arrangements where an external party is 
engaged to provide public services on behalf of a 
grantor, which is a NSW Health organisation.
The NSW Ministry of Health coordinated a review of 
service concession arrangements across NSW Health to 
determine the extent to which AASB 1059 should apply. 
For each material arrangement identified, the Ministry 
prepared an accounting assessment paper. A 
centralised approach was taken to calculate the 
transition impacts, process the necessary accounting 
journals and prepare the required disclosures for the 
annual financial statements. 
Workshops and training seminars were conducted 
to educate and train accountants to facilitate 
compliance with the new standard. Sessions were also 
conducted with impacted Health organisations to 
discuss the appropriate accounting for these 
arrangements on an ongoing basis.
In addition, independent post-implementation reviews 
were arranged for three new Accounting Standards 
which were implemented in 2019-20: AASB 15 Revenue 
from Contracts with Customers, AASB 1058 Income for 
Not-for-Profit Entities, and AASB 16 Leases. 
The Secretary’s Award – Integrated Value 
Based Care Award winner
Aged Care Rapid 
Assessment and 
Investigation Unit 
(ARIA)
South Western Sydney 
Local Health District
The Aged Care Rapid Assessment and Investigation 
Unit (ARIA) provides targeted, streamlined, 
multidisciplinary care for older patients. Its aim is to 
provide truly integrated care and improve patient 
outcomes by providing the right care in the right 
place at the right time. An embedded service since 
2018, ARIA is a specialist-led multidisciplinary team 
which actively case-finds older patients in emergency 
departments for admission to the ARIA unit. This 
enables priority assessment, investigation and 
integrated care planning. To show the impact of the 
service, analysis was undertaken of 370 patients 
(185 in each group for ARIA and non-ARIA) 
of similar age, sex, culturally and linguistically 
diverse background, domicile, frailty and 
co-morbidity. Results showed ARIA patients 
had a shorter hospital length-of-stay compared 
with non-ARIA patients. The unit’s targeted, 
integrated, multidisciplinary approach to frontline 
aged care services can also be associated with 
improved patient outcomes. For their work, 
the Aged Care Rapid Assessment and Investigation 
Unit at South Western Sydney Local Health District 
won the 2020 Secretary’s Award for Integrated 
Value Based Care.
Providing integrated care for 
older people is key to the work 
the South Western Sydney 
Local Health District Aged Care 
Rapid Assessment and 
Investigation Unit is doing.

Creating value and improving decision 
making through data analysis
NSW Ministry of Health data committees continued 
to collaborate across functional areas to enhance and 
drive best practice in data governance. The NSW Health 
five-year vision for corporate analytics ensures alignment 
between functional areas to continue to create value and 
improve decision making through enhanced data insights. 
Financial leadership and 
sustainable resource allocation
NSW Health remains focused on providing financial 
leadership, including sustainable resource allocation 
across the NSW public hospital system. In 2020-21, 
NSW Health continued to work closely with NSW 
Treasury to assess key budget pressures. 
NSW Health also continued to enhance the governance 
and reporting framework to improve the measurement 
and evaluation of an investment’s effectiveness from both 
a service delivery and financial perspective. An enhanced 
NSW Health evidence bank database and capital database 
is being developed to capture initial economic impact 
appraisals, which will support evaluations. Work continued 
in 2020-21 to develop the requirements of the evidence 
bank and to finalise data requirements for the capital 
database, which will be hosted in the eHealth NSW 
corporate analytics platform.
Assessing the economic impact of 
the Leading Better Value Care program
Economic analyses aim to improve patient outcomes 
and experience of care by ensuring available resources 
are used more efficiently. Three early implemented 
and scaled Leading Better Value Care initiatives 
(Osteoporotic Refracture Prevention (ORP), Osteoarthritis 
Chronic Care Program and High Risk Foot Services) 
were assessed and the 2019-20 results indicated that as 
provision of patient-centred care in outpatient settings 
increased, the demand for hospitalisation overall flattened 
against business-as-usual projections. 
For example, ORP, which provides fracture patients with 
support and care to reduce the probability of refracture 
resulting in hospitalisation, was estimated to have avoided 
around 4900 patient admissions for refractures in 2019-20.
For the 10-year period starting in 2018-19, 
year-to-year cost-avoided benefits of $290 million 
(cumulative cost-avoided benefits of $2.1 billion) 
have been estimated across the program. NSW Health 
is on track to achieve this, with year-to-year costs avoided 
in 2019-20 for Tranche 1 and 2 initiatives of $50 million 
and $86 million respectively for first two years 
(2018-19 and 2019-20) compared with 
business-as-usual activity projections. 
Developing funding models to 
support innovation in care delivery
NSW continued to work with all Australian governments 
to develop options for future funding models to support 
innovation in care delivery. NSW has led the establishment 
of refreshed governance arrangements for collaboration, 
and led implementation of the reform commitments made 
in the 2020-2025 Addendum to the National Health 
Reform Agreement. 
In addition, in line with existing government responsibilities 
for the health system, NSW secured a Commonwealth 
financial contribution to the COVID-19 response. 
The contribution supported additional hospital costs, 
public health measures and private hospital sector 
viability payments to ensure sufficient hospital capacity 
to respond to the ongoing pandemic.
Prioritising sustainability 
across the health system
HealthShare NSW has included sustainability as one 
of three pillars in its 2020-2024 Strategic Plan and is 
developing a Sustainability Strategy in collaboration 
with the NSW Department of Planning, Industry and 
Environment. The strategy includes taking actions to 
improve resource efficiency and deliver operational 
cost savings, for example reducing waste at health 
facilities statewide and reforming food services to 
reduce food waste while offering patients increased 
choice. Initiatives are underway to reduce waste in 
meal service delivery and preparation; reduce transport 
emissions via supply chain optimisation; and embed 
procurement measures and tools to drive sustainable 
industry practices. 
Driving value in procurement
NSW Health achieved an overall procurement financial 
savings of $31.4 million during financial year 2020-21. 
Key foundation work began for implementation of the 
NSW Health Procurement Reform Program during 
2020-21, including strategies for medical consumables 
and pharmaceuticals. In addition, the NSW Health 
procurement model was refined to enhance governance, 
and facilitate improved cluster-wide coordination, 
contract management and procurement outcomes.
This included the following initiatives: 
•	a review of the procurement framework and 
organisational structure to improve and clarify 
roles and responsibilities across NSW Health, 
with implementation expected in 2021-22
NSW Health	
Annual Report 2020-21   :  Performance   :  page 54


•	a review of pharmaceutical procurement to develop 
a strategy framework governing the usage of 
pharmaceuticals to deliver optimum clinical governance 
and better-value healthcare, with phased implementation 
expected in 2021-22
•	initiated development of IT Systems and Data Strategy 
to enhance IT systems that support the end-to-end 
procurement process
•	supply chain foundation work, including the identification 
of principles and objectives, with further enhancement of 
the business case and requirements in 2021-22.
The DeliverEASE program
A pilot for the DeliverEASE program was effectively 
rolled out with South Eastern Sydney Local Health District 
in February 2021. DeliverEASE improves visibility 
of medical consumable stock and reduces the risk 
of nil stock situations. In doing so, it supports the 
seamless provision of clinical care to patients and 
drives value in procurement. Other benefits include 
improved availability of medical consumables and 
personal protective equipment through the right items 
being delivered in the right quantities to the right place 
at the right time, which reduces waste. South Eastern 
Sydney Local Health District staff were able to view 
a dashboard that provides visibility of estimated 
stock levels at ward level to determine the priorities 
for deliveries. This saved staff time and effort, 
and received positive staff feedback.
Enhancing productivity 
through new ways of working
From mid-2020, 10 NSW Health organisations were 
relocated to new premises at 1 Reserve Road, St Leonards. 
eHealth NSW designed and provided technology solutions 
to prepare and support the office moves from various 
locations. The agencies involved have benefited from 
streamlined processes, and an activity-based agile 
working environment that has promoted diversity, 
flexibility and knowledge-sharing through centralised 
groups including the Young Professionals Network and 
Communities of Practice. 
The co-location of health organisations has also enhanced 
opportunities for:
•	standardised technical support with the eHealth NSW 
Connect IT hub
•	simplified onboarding of new staff
•	automated workflow solutions using AFM Online 
and SARA.

Elevating the Human Experience
NSW Health launched Elevating the Human Experience: 
Our guide to action for patient, family, carer, volunteer and 
caregiver experiences this year. The statewide blueprint 
emphasises the importance of people’s experiences of 
using health services and the link between a good 
experience of care and positive health outcomes.
Seven enablers across the three key areas of people, 
process and place support NSW Health’s aspiration to 
deliver positive experiences for patients, families, carers 
and staff, guiding priority initiatives on where the health 
system can be most effective.
Patient Experience Week recognised the incredible 
staff who positively impacted care provided in our 
hospitals and health settings.
To mark World Kindness Day, NSW Health participated 
in the #KindnessWorksHere campaign to celebrate the 
small acts of kindness. The campaign kickstarted a 
conversation on kindness, compassion and care, and the 
importance of continuing to build the culture of these 
values in elevating the human experience.

Management 
and accountability


NSW Health is a world-class 
health system, delivering high-
quality, safe care statewide 
each year. Our 170,000-strong 
(127,156 full-time equivalent) 
workforce provides important 
and essential services to the 
citizens of NSW.
Our governance structure, financial frameworks and 
approach to risk management drive us to lead and 
promote excellence in healthcare management and 
service delivery.
Governance
NSW Health comprises the NSW Ministry of Health 
(a public service department under the Government Sector 
Employment Act 2013) and the various NSW Health 
organisations making up the NSW public health system, 
including local health districts and specialty health networks 
(see the NSW Health organisational chart on page 5). 
The Ministry is the system manager for NSW Health. 
NSW Health organisations are governed by an 
accountable authority – either a board or a chief executive, 
or both. The Corporate Governance and Accountability 
Compendium outlines the governance requirements 
that apply to the organisations that form part of 
NSW Health and sets out the roles, relationships and 
responsibilities of each organisation. A copy is available 
at health.nsw.gov.au.
Clinical governance
NSW Health is committed to ensuring health services are 
needs-based and provide safe, high-quality, value based 
care for patients.
The Patient Experience and System Performance Safety 
and Quality Framework provides guidance to all NSW 
Health organisations on the key components required to 
continuously improve health services to deliver safe and 
high-quality care to patients. 
These activities include improved access to health 
services, greater efficiencies in providing care, reducing 
hospital acquired complications, and developing 
integrated governance systems that maintain and improve 
the reliability and quality of patient care.
The framework reinforces NSW Health’s commitment to 
partnering with patients, consumers, families and carers in 
healthcare decision making and improving staff culture 
and wellbeing to provide high-quality care.
Across NSW Health, clinical governance systems are 
governed by the following key principles:
•	openness about errors – these are reported and 
acknowledged without fear, and patients and their 
families are told what went wrong and why
•	emphasis on learning – the system is oriented towards 
learning from its mistakes
•	obligation to act – the obligation to take action to remedy 
problems is widely instilled
•	accountability – the limits of individual accountability are 
clear
•	a just culture – individuals are treated fairly and not 
blamed for system failures
•	appropriate prioritisation of action – actions are 
prioritised according to resources and where the 
greatest improvements can be made
•	teamwork – cooperation is recognised as the best 
defence against system failures and is explicitly 
encouraged.
In collaboration with the NSW Ministry of Health Patient 
Safety First Unit, the Clinical Excellence Commission is 
responsible for the quality and safety of the NSW public 
health system and for providing leadership in clinical 
governance. Local health districts and specialty health 
networks have primary responsibility for providing safe, 
high-quality care for patients.
To protect patients from harm and ensure the quality of 
health services, hospitals, dental services and oral health 
clinics within hospitals must be accredited. Accreditation 
is determined by assessment against the National Safety 
and Quality Health Service Standards, in accordance with 
the Australian Health Services Safety and Quality 
Accreditation Scheme.
The Clinical Excellence Commission produced 25 safety 
alert broadcasts relating to clinical issues, medicines and 
vaccinations in 2020-21. In collaboration with HealthShare 
NSW, the Commission also developed a governance and 
review process for COVID-19-related personal protection 
equipment. Details are included on page 257.

Feedback and complaints
NSW Health is committed to value based, patient-centred 
care. We listen to feedback, and encourage patients, their 
families and carers to share feedback about their 
healthcare experiences. 
The system transitioned from the Incident Information 
Management System (IIMS) to Information Management 
Software (ims+) in 2020-21, to manage feedback and 
complaints, with 8548 complaints received in 2020. 
In transitioning to ims+, data in relation to the classification 
or resolution of complaints is no longer published.
NSW Health has local and statewide processes in place to 
enable staff across NSW Health to manage complaints 
from patients, carers and the community. In 2016, NSW 
Health committed to improving complaints handling 
processes in line with the NSW Ombudsman’s Complaints 
Handling Improvement Program (CHIP). As part of this 
commitment, NSW Health agreed to implement the six 
criteria for effective complaints handling:
1.	 Respectful treatment
2.	 Information and accessibility
3.	 Good communication
4.	 Taking ownership
5.	 Timeliness
6.	 Transparency.
Since then, NSW Health has implemented key 
improvements to complaints handling processes across 
the state, including:
•	implementing the digital Feedback Assist widget on each 
local health district and specialty health network website. 
Feedback Assist is a simple and easily accessible tool 
that enables more consumers to provide feedback on our 
services
•	transitioning from the previous Incident Information 
Management System (IIMS) to the enhanced system 
Information Management Software (ims+), which 
provides improved capabilities to manage consumer 
feedback and complaints
•	revising statewide complaints handling policies to 
incorporate the six criteria and ensure NSW Health 
organisations present a consistent and consolidated 
approach to responding to complaints from consumers
•	implementing local-led enhancements at the district and 
network level to improve workforce culture and 
consumer engagement.
NSW Health will continue to look for opportunities to 
improve our processes to ensure all complaints are 
managed fairly, efficiently and effectively.
Finance and performance management
Helping people stay healthy and providing access to 
timely, high-quality, patient-centred healthcare are key 
goals of NSW Health. Achieving these goals requires clear 
priorities, supportive leadership and staff working 
together, underpinned by CORE values of collaboration, 
openness, respect and empowerment.
NSW Health Performance Framework
The framework includes the performance expected of 
public sector health services and monitors performance 
against those expectations to achieve the required levels 
of health improvement, service delivery and financial 
performance. 
The framework and associated key performance 
indicators listed in service agreements apply at both 
whole-of-health-service and facility or service levels, 
promoting and supporting a high-performance culture.
In 2020-21, a review of the framework was completed in 
response to recommendations from the Audit Office of NSW. 
The revised framework will be finalised and implemented 
in 2021-22. Having been informed by an external review 
and extensive stakeholder consultation, the revised 
framework will aim to provide greater visibility and 
accountability of the performance assessment process.
Service agreements
Service agreements are a central component of the 
Performance Framework. By setting out service and 
performance expectations and funding, they support the 
devolution of decision making, responsibility and 
accountability for safe, high-quality, patient-centred care 
to local health districts, other health services and support 
organisations.
Annual service agreements between the NSW Ministry 
of Health and health services include budgets for the level 
and mix of services each local health district and network 
need for their communities. In activity based funding, the 
purchasing methodology has evolved to more clearly 
align with the Outcome Framework and strategic priorities. 
Funding decisions consider the outcomes for patients 
and the public health system, and funding adjustors are 
used to incentivise value based care.

Audit and risk management
NSW Health policy requires public health organisations 
to maintain effective, independent audit frameworks 
and corporate governance practices consistent with NSW 
public sector best practices. Enterprise-wide risks are 
managed through continuous monitoring and risk control 
(policy, procedures and guidelines), which are reflected 
in the NSW Health Risk Management Policy.
Audit and risk management committees
Each public health organisation must establish an 
audit and risk management committee, which is a key 
component in the public health organisation’s corporate 
governance framework. It oversees: 
•	internal controls and internal audit 
•	enterprise risk management 
•	business continuity plans 
•	disaster recovery plans 
•	corruption and fraud prevention 
•	external accountability and external audit 
•	compliance with applicable laws and regulations.
Internal auditing at the Ministry
Internal Audit provides an independent review and 
advisory service to the Secretary, NSW Health 
and the Risk Management and Audit Committee. 
It ensures the Ministry’s financial and operational 
controls are designed to manage organisational risks 
and achieve agreed objectives, and continue to 
operate efficiently, effectively and ethically.
Internal Audit assists management to improve Ministry 
business performance, and advises on fraud, corruption 
risks and internal controls over business functions 
and processes.
External agency oversight
Several statutory and government agencies are involved 
in the oversight and governance of NSW public health 
organisations. These include the NSW Ombudsman, 
Information and Privacy Commission, Independent 
Commission Against Corruption, NSW Treasury, Department 
of Premier and Cabinet, the Auditor-General, Audit Office 
of NSW and the Public Accounts Committee of the 
NSW Parliament. 
NSW Ombudsman
The NSW Ombudsman tabled one report involving 
NSW Health during 2020-21: 
1.	 
NSW Child Death Review Team Annual Report 2019-20 
– published 27 October 2020.
The tabled report including relevant data provided 
by NSW Health is available at ombo.nsw.gov.au. 
Audit Office of NSW
This Office fulfils the external audit function for NSW 
public health organisations and undertakes audits across 
finance, performance and compliance topic areas. 
In 2020-21, the Office tabled two performance audit 
reports in Parliament focusing specifically on NSW Health: 
1.	 
Health Capital Works – tabled 12 August 2020 
2.	 
Managing the Health, Safety and Wellbeing of 
Nurses and Junior Doctors in High Demand Hospital 
Environments – tabled 9 December 2020.
The Ministry, along with 39 other NSW Government 
agencies, was involved in the preparation of the Auditor-
General’s report: Internal Controls and Governance 2020, 
released 24 November 2020. All tabled reports, including 
the related response from NSW Health, are available 
at audit.nsw.gov.au. 
Public Accounts Committee 
of the NSW Parliament
This Committee reviews performance audit reports 
tabled in Parliament as part of a 12-month follow-up, and 
requests reports on progress of implementation of agreed 
recommendations. In 2020-21, NSW Health made two 
submissions to the Committee regarding implementation 
of recommendations from previous performance audits: 
1.	 
Mental Health Service Planning for Aboriginal People 
in New South Wales (audit report originally tabled 
29 August 2019)
2.	 
Ensuring Contract Management Capability in Government 
– HealthShare NSW (audit report originally tabled 
31 October 2019).

Public Interest Disclosures
NSW Health values the contributions of staff to improve 
administrative and management practices. Staff are 
encouraged to report any alleged wrongdoing under 
the Public Interest Disclosures Act 1994. NSW Health 
has a Public Interest Disclosures Policy which covers 
management of Public Interest Disclosures across 
all NSW Health organisations. 
NSW Health organisations received 70 Public Interest 
Disclosures over the 2020-21 reporting period:
•	40 in the course of their day-to-day functions
•	30 falling into the category of ‘all other Public Interest 
Disclosures’. 
The majority of Public Interest Disclosures (54) primarily 
related to reports alleging corruption, with nine Public 
Interest Disclosure reports relating to allegations of 
maladministration. The remaining seven Public Interest 
Disclosures fall within other categories. 
Across NSW Health, 19 Public Interest Disclosures were 
finalised during the 2020-21 period. 
NSW Health has received a greater number (70) of 
Public Interest Disclosure reports in the 2020-21 financial 
year compared with the previous reporting period of 
2019-20 (41). 
Public Interest Disclosure Coordinators for NSW Health 
organisations continued to implement tailored staff 
awareness strategies to suit their organisational needs. 
The COVID-19 pandemic impacted the ability of NSW 
Health to implement face-to-face training and forums. 
NSW Health organisations used training provided by 
representatives from the NSW Ombudsman, internal 
staff briefings, e-learning, and employee induction training 
to improve awareness. Information about Public Interest 
Disclosures is available on intranet sites, and some 
organisations provided information via newsletters, 
posters and surveys.
Government Information (Public Access) Act 2009
The Ministry regularly reviews information on its website 
and routinely uploads information that may be of interest 
to the public. This includes a wide range of publications 
and resources including reports, fact sheets, brochures 
and pamphlets. Information is also available in other 
languages from the NSW Multicultural Health 
Communication Service website. 
During 2020-21, the Ministry received 146 formal access 
applications under the Government Information (Public 
Access) Act 2009 (the GIPA Act) and of these, 43 
applications were transferred to other agencies for 
completion. During the reporting period, 13 applications 
were invalid for not complying with the formal 
requirements of section 41 of the GIPA Act. 
A total of 94 applications submitted to the Ministry were 
completed within the reporting period, including six 
originally received in the 2019-20 reporting period. There 
were 15 applications undecided as at 30 June 2021. 
Four internal reviews were conducted in 2020-21, with 
three external reviews completed in this same period.
Of the 94 new formal access applications decided in 
2020-21, the Ministry made two decisions to refuse access 
to information referred to in Schedule 1 of the GIPA Act, 
where there is a conclusive presumption of overriding 
public interest against disclosure. Five applications 
resulted in a full refusal of access and 16 applications 
involved a decision to refuse access to part of the 
information. 
Statistical information regarding formal access 
applications received during 2020-21 is provided 
in the following tables.

Information 
management
Privacy management
The Regulation and Compliance Unit provides ongoing 
privacy information and support within the NSW Ministry 
of Health, and to the NSW public health system. 
In 2020-21, work has included:
•	providing advice to the COVID-19 vaccination program 
on privacy notice obligations
•	providing advice to the COVID-19 contact tracing team 
regarding the confidentiality of personal information
•	assisting with the response to a cyber-attack. This 
included responding to affected patients’ queries, 
complaints and privacy internal review applications
•	participation in the Mandatory Notifiable Data Breach 
Scheme interagency working group to inform the 
drafting of the Exposure Bill to amend the NSW Privacy 
and Personal Information Protection Act 1998
•	updating the online Privacy Training Module One for 
NSW Health staff and adapting the HealthShare NSW 
privacy animation for use by all NSW Health 
organisations
•	participation in the Patient Privacy Auditing Working 
Group and the drafting of the Governance Framework 
for the Patient Privacy Audit tool
•	participation in the Digital Consent Framework 
Working Group
•	review of Privacy Impact Self-Assessment submissions 
for new Ministry projects and initiatives as part of the 
Privacy and Security Assurance Framework.
Support for Privacy Contact Officers included online 
meetings being organised to ensure officers remained 
up-to-date with statewide privacy law, policy and practice 
developments, and assistance with privacy enquiries and 
oversight of health privacy internal review matters.
Work also commenced on the update of the NSW Health 
Privacy Management Plan. The plan will incorporate 
developments in notification obligations of data breaches, 
including cyber breaches. It will also incorporate 
information for the management of digitised personal 
information of staff. 
Internal review
The Privacy and Personal Information Protection Act 1988 
provides a formalised structure for managing privacy 
complaints relating to this Act and the Health Records 
and Information Privacy Act 2002. This process is known 
as ‘internal review’. 
During 2020-21, the NSW Ministry of Health received 
no applications for internal review.

Our 
people
The Health Professionals 
Workforce Plan 2012-22 plays 
a central role to ensure NSW 
Health achieves a fit-for-
purpose workforce to meet 
the current and future needs 
of the community. It sets out 
strategies to ensure NSW 
Health recruits, trains and 
retains health professionals 
to continue to provide a quality 
health service to the people 
of NSW.
Regular reporting by local health districts, networks, 
pillars and the NSW Ministry of Health has demonstrated 
the success of the plan. Significant evidence proved 
lead agencies and partners had met the intent of the plan 
and many initiatives have since been implemented into 
ongoing practice.
System leaders have continued to respond to new and 
emerging trends, increasing evidence for change and 
contemporary practices in workforce planning. Examples 
include the improved focus on mentoring programs, 
introduction of the new Diversity Inclusion Belonging 
Resource Hub, and enhanced workforce and corporate 
data analytics. 
In contributing to the review of the Health Professionals 
Workforce Plan 2012-22, Aboriginal workforce and cultural 
safety elements were included and both the Good Health 
– Great Jobs: Aboriginal Workforce Strategic Framework 
2016-2020 and Respecting the Difference Aboriginal 
Cultural Training Framework were cross-referenced.
Building positive workforce culture
Strengthening workplace culture and building positive 
staff engagement in workplaces and teams is an 
important priority for NSW Health. NSW Health tracks 
employee engagement and workplace culture annually 
via the NSW Public Service Commission’s People Matter 
Employee Survey. However, due to the COVID-19 pandemic 
response, NSW Health did not participate in the People 
Matter Employee Survey in 2020. Some NSW Health 
organisations instead opted to conduct pulse surveys 
to receive rapid feedback from staff. 
Responding to bullying and complaints
NSW Health organisations implemented local strategies 
to reduce the incidence of bullying and unacceptable 
behaviour and enhance workplace culture. Anti-bullying 
Management Advisors developed strategies for improving 
communication, increasing information sharing, and 
providing support and coaching to managers on effective 
complaints management processes.
The confidential Anti-Bullying Advice Line provided 
guidance and information to employees about the 
complaint resolution process. 
NSW Health organisations’ human resources departments 
report individual complaint data to the Ministry, while 
protecting complainants’ identities. These individual 
complaints are initially assessed as potential bullying 
complaints.
The Ministry received 114 bullying complaints from 
1 July 2020 to 30 June 2021, which increased from 
85 complaints in 2019-20. This represents 0.09 per cent 
of the total full-time equivalent staff in the NSW Health 
system (based on full-time equivalent staff as at 
30 June 2021).
The Ministry developed a web portal for managers on 
addressing grievances and concerns, including bullying. The 
purpose of the portal is to support managers across NSW 
Health to address workplace issues appropriately and as soon 
as they arise. The portal provides access to flowcharts, 
information sheets, checklists, videos and links to policies, 
processes and resources.

Workforce diversity
NSW Health has a strong commitment to workforce diversity and recruits and employs staff based on merit. 
The Ministry has several plans to promote and support workforce diversity including the Disability Inclusion 
Action Plan, the NSW Aboriginal Health Plan 2013-2023 and the Revised NSW Health Good Health – Great Jobs: 
Aboriginal Workforce Strategic Framework 2016-2020.

Note 1: The benchmark of 50 per cent for representation of women across the sector is intended to reflect the gender composition 
of the NSW community. Note 2: The NSW Public Sector Aboriginal Employment Strategy 2019-2025 takes a career pathway approach 
in that it sets an ambitious target of three per cent Aboriginal employment at each non-executive grade of the public sector by 2025. 
Note 3: A benchmark from the Australian Bureau of Statistics (ABS) Census of Population and Housing has been included for People 
whose first language spoken as a child was not English. The ABS Census does not provide information about first language, but does 
provide information about country of birth. The benchmark of 23.2 per cent is the percentage of the NSW general population born in 
a country where English is not the predominant language. Note 4: In December 2017, the NSW Government announced the target of 
doubling the representation of people with disability in the NSW public sector from an estimated 2.7 per cent to 5.6 per cent by 2027. 
More information can be found at: https://www.facs.nsw.gov.au/inclusion/disability/jobs. The benchmark for ‘People with disability

Note 1: A Distribution Index score of 100 indicates that the distribution of members of the workforce diversity group across salary 
bands is equivalent to that of the rest of the workforce. A score less than 100 means that members of the workforce diversity group 
tend to be more concentrated at lower salary bands than is the case for other staff. The more pronounced this tendency is, the lower 
the score will be. In some cases, the index may be more than 100, indicating that members of the workforce diversity group tend 
to be more concentrated at higher salary bands than is the case for other staff. Note 2: The Distribution Index is not calculated when 
the number of employees in the workforce diversity group is less than 20 or when the number of other employees is less than 20.

Workplace health and safety
The Ministry is committed to maintaining the health, safety 
and welfare of staff and visitors, in accordance with the 
Work Health and Safety Act 2011 (NSW) and the Work 
Health and Safety Regulation 2017 (NSW). Strategies to 
improve work health and safety include implementing 
Work Health Safety: Better Practice Procedures and Injury 
Management and Return to Work policy frameworks; an 
ongoing commitment to the Ministry’s Work Health Safety 
Mission Statement; and the promotion of healthy lifestyle 
campaigns educating staff about general health and 
wellbeing strategies.
Workers compensation
This year, there was a total of eight workers compensation 
claims. These comprised six psychological claims and two 
body stress claims.
Strategies to improve workers compensation and return-
to-work performance included:
•	a focus on early intervention to support the recovery and 
return to work of employees who sustain a work-related 
injury
•	working with treating professionals to ensure that injured 
workers receive the best possible treatment, their family 
and peers are supported, and factors linked to the injury 
are managed
•	frequent claims reviews to monitor recovery and return-
to-work strategies.
The Ministry promotes risk management and injury 
prevention strategies, including conducting workplace 
assessments, making ergonomic information available on 
the intranet, and investigating and resolving identified 
hazards in a timely manner.
Prosecutions under the 
Work Health and Safety Act 2011
SafeWork NSW v Sydney Local Health District – two 
charges commenced under s 32/19(1) and 32/19(2) of the 
Work Health and Safety Act 2011 respectively. The charges 
were filed in the District Court of NSW on 30 April 2021. 
The District Court file number for the s 19(1)/32 charge is

NSW Health continued its strong commitment to 
resource efficiency and environmental sustainability 
by implementing key measures within the Health Resource 
Efficiency Strategy in alignment with Government 
Resource Efficiency Policy and remaining on track to 
exceed the 2024 solar installation target in the policy.
In 2020-21, NSW Health continued to lead the state and 
the country in energy efficiency projects, notably with the 
installation of solar energy generation systems on its 
hospitals. The recently completed John Hunter Hospital 
system at 2.4 megawatts power (MWp) is the largest solar 
panel system on a hospital in the world. NSW Health now 
has almost 20 MWp of solar installed or in progress across 
the network. When added together, NSW Health’s total 
solar generation power would see it ranked within the 
state’s top 25 solar farms. There are now large solar panel 
systems either installed or planned on most major 
hospitals including but not limited to John Hunter, Hornsby, 
Gosford, Port Macquarie, Canterbury, Blacktown, Parkes, 
Broken Hill, Fairfield and Coffs Harbour. 
There are also about 150 small to medium-scale systems 
on all types of NSW Health facilities. Since its inception 
in 2016, the NSW Health Large-scale Solar Program 
has reduced the carbon emissions of the network by 
around 33,000 tonnes, the equivalent of removing about 
15,000 cars from the road. 
To facilitate the continued focus on energy-efficiency 
projects this year, NSW Health established the Health 
Fund for Energy Efficiency Projects. Managed by the 
NSW Ministry of Health’s Financial Services and Asset 
Management Division, this fund has already provided 
$2 million to Nepean Blue Mountains Local Health District 
for a lighting upgrade project across multiple hospitals 
with savings to the network in the order of $500,000 
per year. A multitude of other projects including lighting 
upgrades and solar panel systems are now moving 
through the approvals process. 
NSW Health is also leading government in the battery 
energy storage system space, with Mid North Coast Local 
Health District signing a contract to have a large-scale 
battery installed at Port Macquarie Hospital, the first 
of its kind in Australia.
A combination of energy efficiency measures and 
equipment upgrades managed by the local health districts 
has enabled NSW Health’s building energy consumption 
to remain stable for a sixth consecutive year.
Environmental 
sustainability

Energy management 
Electricity consumption decreased by 1.5 per cent from last year despite the addition of new assets. The electricity bill 
also decreased by three per cent due to falling prices, primarily in the cost of environmental certificates. The 2020-21 bill 
for natural gas was $17.1 million and LPG was $1.5 million. A combination of energy efficiency measures, managed by the 
local health districts, has seen NSW Health’s building energy consumption remain stable.

Equity 
and diversity
Disability inclusion
The NSW Health Disability Inclusion Action Plan 2016-
2019 has supported improved access to quality healthcare 
by people with disability. The plan addresses the barriers 
experienced by people with disability in accessing 
mainstream health services and supports improved 
accessibility and inclusion relating to employment and 
health services provided by NSW Health. 
The plan is currently in review and will be informed by 
consultation across NSW Health and with key disability 
sector stakeholders to align with the Australian Disability 
Strategy 2021-2031. The plan will be guided by the NSW 
Disability Inclusion Plan Action Plan Framework 2021-2025.
The Disability Community of Practice, with more than 
150 members including people with disability, peak 
non-government organisations, clinicians, program 
managers and key stakeholders, continued to provide 
a forum to share ideas, strategies, local solutions 
and concerns with respect to pandemic preparedness 
for people with disability. 
Many issues addressed through this Community of 
Practice align with key actions in the Disability Inclusion 
Action Plan.
This fifth year of reporting on the plan highlights the 
progress NSW Health organisations have made. For 
example, we: 
•	introduced National Disability Insurance Scheme Hospital 
Liaison Officers in local health districts; implemented the 
new escalation pathways and an accommodation register 
to assist with safe patient discharge from hospitals; and 
provided disability-related public health messaging 
distributed via easy-read resources, webinars, websites, 
videos and virtual National Disability Insurance Scheme 
service provider forums
•	responded to requests from the Royal Commission 
into Violence, Abuse, Neglect and Exploitation of People 
with Disability. NSW Health representatives appeared 
as witnesses at three public hearings focusing on 
the provision of healthcare or services for people 
with cognitive disability; education and training of health 
professionals in relation to people with cognitive 
disability; and the experiences of people with cognitive 
disability in the criminal justice system
•	invested almost $6 million a year into the statewide 
Intellectual Disability Service. This service operates in 
every local health district, with six teams and nine 
specialised clinicians operational across NSW. The 
service also provided education, training and clinical 
support to general practitioners, NSW Health staff and 
disability practitioners
•	in partnership with the NSW Health Education Centre 
Against Violence, developed a Sexual Assault and New 
Street Services Access Strategy for People with 
Disability. This is part of the NSW Government’s response 
to the Royal Commission into Institutional Responses 
to Child Sexual Abuse
•	launched Statewide Intellectual Disability Mental Health 
Hubs in 2021 to provide clinical consultation and 
assessment of people with intellectual disability and 
co-occurring mental health problems, and training 
to health and disability professionals
•	continued the Safe and Supported at Home Program 
to support patients with disabilities to manage at home, 
having delivered 7400 packages in 2020-21.
NSW Carers (Recognition) Act 2011	
Carers play an important role in supporting patients in 
their recovery and everyday lives. NSW Health is 
committed to supporting carers, with a range of initiatives 
implemented to acknowledge and support them.
Upgrades to the Patient Administration System have now 
been completed at nearly all local health districts, to 
record at registration if a patient has a carer or is a carer. 
This change recognises that patients and their carers have 
a better experience when carers are acknowledged, and 
when carers can talk to and work with health 
professionals.
NSW Health-funded carer support services have 
continued to assist carers in accessing appropriate 
services, maintaining current information and raising 
awareness of carers and their needs. These services have 
also ensured that carers are involved in discussions about 
areas that affect them. Statewide Think Patient, Think 
Carer resources have been developed to improve visibility 
across health services.

The NSW Carers Strategy: Caring in New South Wales 
2020-2030 was released by the Department of 
Communities and Justice, with NSW Health having many 
significant obligations under this plan. Alongside this, 
the NSW Health Recognition and Support for Carers Key 
Directions will be updated in 2021-22.
NSW Health strategy for people with diverse 
sexualities, gender identities and those with 
intersex variations
The NSW Ministry of Health worked closely with the 
Strategy Advisory Committee to complete a needs 
assessment commissioned to inform NSW’s first health 
strategy for people with diverse sexualities, diverse 
gender identities and intersex variations. The Ministry 
continued to work with the Strategy Advisory Committee 
to finalise the draft NSW LGBTIQ+ Strategy.
The strategy will provide direction to the NSW Health 
system to improve health outcomes for people who are 
LGBTIQ+, and also guide important partnership work with 
primary care and other community-based health services. 
It is expected to be released in 2021-22.
Multicultural 
health
The Multicultural Policies and Services Program (MPSP), 
overseen by Multicultural NSW, is a whole-of-government 
initiative focused on ensuring government agencies 
implement the principles of multiculturalism through their 
strategic plans, and deliver inclusive and equitable 
services to the public. 
In 2020-21, NSW Health continued to ensure the health 
system was accessible and responsive to the needs of 
culturally and linguistically diverse (CALD) people. The 
NSW Health Plan for Healthy Culturally and Linguistically 
Diverse Communities 2019-2023 aligns with the MPSP 
framework and is a statewide policy for meeting the health 
needs of CALD consumers in NSW over the medium term. 
The plan focuses on outcomes in areas of access and 
quality of healthcare; health literacy; cultural 
responsiveness; and understanding community health 
needs. Examples of significant work across each of these 
outcomes in 2020-21 are provided below.
In 2021-22, NSW Health will publish the NSW Refugee 
Health Plan 2021-26, which will identify priorities to 
improve NSW Health’s care for people from refugee 
backgrounds. NSW Health will also continue a project 
to inform and guide a consistent approach to future 
statewide service planning and delivery for healthcare 
interpreting services.

NSW Health organisation
Project or initiative
Cancer Institute NSW
The Institute developed Staying Well and Preventing Cancer flipcharts and facilitator manuals in 15 community 
languages to educate community members on reducing cancer risk through modifiable healthy living behaviours. 
A critical success factor was consultation with bilingual community educators and coordinators from local health 
districts. Community education sessions will be delivered in 2021-22.
Health Education and Training 
Institute (HETI)
HETI seeks culturally diverse inputs when developing services, programs and policies. This includes perspectives 
from health service consumers, clinicians, staff, higher education students, HETI and broader NSW Health staff. 
In 2020-21, the Institute reviewed and commenced redevelopment of the eLearning module Working in a Culturally 
Diverse Context. Course development included input from multicultural and refugee health service managers, 
as well as professional healthcare interpreters. The new module is expected to be completed and published 
in early 2022.
Hunter New England 
Local Health District
The Pacific Clinic of the Hunter New England Sexual Health Service offers a free, accessible service to everyone, 
including Medicare Ineligible Patients. In consultation with the Multicultural Health Service and consumers of their 
service, the Pacific Clinic created an online appointment registration form in Arabic, Chinese, Hindi, Korean, Thai and 
Vietnamese. This change immediately increased the appointments of people from these communities, as well as 
people requiring an interpreter, over the six months since the site went live. 
Murrumbidgee 
Local Health District
The District took part in research on the value of combined breast and cervical cancer screening clinics with a focus 
on women with CALD backgrounds. Findings have informed development of a new screening model for CALD 
women, providing the opportunity to attend screening in groups, supported by a professional interpreter. The impact 
of this improvement is being monitored and the model is being rolled out across CALD communities at both fixed and 
visiting sites in the region.
Nepean Blue Mountains 
Local Health District
The District began a video interpreting project, which has increased access to interpreters in Lithgow, Blue 
Mountains Hospital, and Springwood and Nepean hospitals.
NSW Refugee Health Service
The Service has sought to assist all clients in need while responding to the COVID-19 pandemic, with the asylum 
seeker and social work teams working via virtual platforms. The Bilingual Community Educator model has also 
proven successful in reaching into vulnerable communities, by supporting cross-cultural communication and 
providing critical intelligence about community needs. The Service has also used diverse strategies to deliver 
COVID-19 messaging by:
• producing COVID-19 video messaging in key languages
• hosting webinars for community members and other health services
• engaging with community and faith leaders.
Northern Sydney 
Local Health District
The Multicultural Health Service has implemented a new model of care together with BreastScreen Northern 
Sydney and Central Coast to improve the participation of Tibetan women in breast screening. Community 
consultations were conducted to identify culturally appropriate strategies for promoting screening in the local 
community. As a result, the model includes a personal invitation to participate from a bilingual community worker, 
in-language information on the benefits of screening and the screening process, assistance with way finding, 
in-language reminder calls, block booking of interpreters, and co-design of promotional material as well as care 
navigation and support. Critical success factors include working in partnership with the Tibetan community to inform 
all aspects of the model and implementation of strategies to address poor health literacy. 
South Western Sydney 
Local Health District
The District’s Natural helper project was piloted at three allied health services (Pain Clinic, Osteoarthritis Chronic 
Care Program and Outpatient Physiotherapy) to bridge cross-cultural and experiential divides between CALD 
patients and healthcare providers. Patients with a peer mentor achieved significantly higher Patient Activation 
Measure scores compared with those receiving usual care. CALD patients reported high levels of satisfaction with 
the program, with themes emphasising the legitimacy of the ‘lived experience’ and ‘collectivist culture’. Healthcare 
providers appraised the model against an ‘effort-reward balance’ with all recognising the potential value of this 
model.
Sydney Children’s 
Hospitals Network
The Network undertook a project to assess and support children’s and families’ need for technological devices for 
telehealth, including people from CALD backgrounds. Families who were experiencing difficulty accessing their 
healthcare appointments via video were identified. Together with the Sydney Children’s Hospitals Foundation, the 
Network attracted National Australia Bank and Optus donations to give families computers and SIM cards pre-
loaded with data. This proved highly effective and helped deliver more equitable healthcare services to those who 
otherwise may not have been able to attend their appointments, including refugees, asylum seekers and other CALD 
populations. Twelve local health districts and eight Aboriginal Community Controlled Health Services requested SIM 
cards from the Network, with over 1400 people receiving and activating SIM cards.
Sydney Local Health District
The District has implemented multiple strategies to increase services available for CALD populations, including:
• 
developing in-language resources and staff education to increase engagement of Mandarin-speakers with the 
Cancer Survivorship Program
• 
piloting a program providing one-to-one, in-language support to patients recently diagnosed with breast cancer 
(Breast Cancer Concierge Program)
• 
commencing a project addressing problem gambling in Nepalese and Vietnamese communities
• 
commissioning a literature review to explore disparities in access to, and experience of, virtual care, which will 
include a focus on barriers to access for CALD communities.

Cancer Institute NSW
The Institute held a virtual Multicultural Women’s Cancer summit in late 2020, which brought together non-
government women’s health centres across NSW. Representatives from regional and rural centres attended the 
summit to discuss the cultural safety of cancer services for local CALD populations and identify future strategies to 
improve cancer outcomes. Attendees included primary care providers, centre managers, health promotion officers 
and allied health professionals.
Illawarra Shoalhaven 
Local Health District
The Multicultural Health Service has played an important role in responding to COVID-19 by increasing health literacy 
and promoting COVID-safe measures and testing among CALD and refugee communities. High school students and 
seniors from CALD backgrounds were identified as the primary target audiences, recognising they often act as 
conduits of information to their families. The team co-designed the program with CALD consumers. About 880 
people participated, ranging from 14 to 85 years, representing 21 language groups. Eighty-five per cent reported 
increased literacy and awareness of COVID-19 transmission plus improved measures of awareness in applying 
COVID-safe measures such as hand hygiene and social distancing. Eighty per cent of seniors reported a greater 
understanding of public health orders and increased confidence about accessing testing.
NSW Ambulance
The service developed a new fact sheet to provide information about NSW Ambulance, how to call for help in 
medical emergencies, and what to expect when you call Triple Zero, as well as important tips. The fact sheet was 
translated into 30 community languages available on the NSW Ambulance website. They were promoted to 
multicultural organisations, migrant resource centres and settlement services across the state. NSW Ambulance 
also engaged with CALD communities by attending preschools, primary schools, high schools, career days, nursing 
homes and community events in areas with high CALD populations.
NSW Refugee Health Service
The Chronic and Complex Care program has demonstrated success in supporting clients to access the National 
Disability Insurance Scheme (NDIS) and in managing urgent complex needs. The Service reaches out to clients 
through community sessions, clinical intervention and formalised support sessions such as carers groups. The team 
has been further expanded to include a part-time occupational therapist (OT). OT services play an important role to 
secure on arrival equipment and access. The model has been built on sustained clinical interventions and consumer 
engagement to address individual needs and break down systemic barriers to positive outcomes for clients.
South Western Sydney 
Local Health District
The District’s Multicultural Services established and maintained a CALD COVID-19 Advisory Committee that has met 
weekly since August 2020. It acts as conduit between CALD community leaders, local organisations and the District. 
A survey of more than 700 CALD community members was undertaken in Greater Western Sydney in partnership 
with the University of Sydney, Sydney Health Literacy Hub, and Western Sydney, Nepean Blue Mountains and South 
Western Sydney local health districts between March and July 2021. The survey was conducted in 12 languages to 
understand people’s knowledge, attitudes and behaviours regarding COVID-19 and to explore the impact of the 
pandemic on culturally and linguistically diverse communities.
Sydney Local Health District
The District has responded to the COVID-19 pandemic by:
• 
collaborating and consulting with CALD community leaders, faith-based leaders, bilingual community workers, 
health professionals and interpreters as well as local council members to ensure strategies meet the needs of local 
CALD communities
• 
providing in-language contact tracing, welfare checks and health accommodation support
• 
reviewing and analysing COVID-19 testing data to identify trends and develop targeted strategies for CALD 
communities
• 
establishing mobile vaccination clinics in CALD communities and language support at all vaccination sites
• 
providing more than 1000 hours of bilingual concierge and cultural liaison at testing clinics and vaccination centres, 
including NSW Mass Vaccination Centre at Sydney Olympic Park
• 
developing over 800 COVID-19 assets into more than 20 priority languages, including videos of community leaders 
sharing COVID-19 safety messages.

NSW Health organisation
Project or initiative
Bureau of Health 
Information (BHI)
The NSW Patient Survey Program gathers information in all its surveys on demographics including language spoken 
at home, the need for an interpreter and if an interpreter was provided. Survey results are available on BHI’s 
interactive data portal, Healthcare Observer, including the ability to look at differences by demographic group. 
This is an important source of information for hospitals about experiences of care for people who speak a language 
other than English at home. In 2020-21, the Bureau provided a bespoke report of results from the Adult Admitted 
Patient Survey (2015-2019) to the NSW Ministry of Health to support the NSW Health Care Interpreter Service 
Project. The data showed results for all performance questions for patients who reported speaking a language other 
than English, as well as results for patients who said they needed an interpreter.
Central Coast 
Local Health District
Data has been used to inform service responses to targeted communities in the COVID-19 response. The District 
regularly shares key information about multicultural communities with key stakeholder partners, for example 
Northern Settlement Services. A recent example was the development of a profile of Northern Central Coast 
suburbs during the lockdown, to identify at-risk communities and language groups in that region. This information 
was shared with the Central Coast Council to support targeted information for non-English speaking communities. 
Centre for Population Health, 
NSW Ministry of Health
Epidemiology identified international students as a priority population for HIV and sexually transmissible infections 
(STI) prevention. A research project engaged the population to improve understanding of issues relating to sexual 
health knowledge, and barriers to service access. The NSW STI Programs Unit developed the International Student 
Health Hub in partnership with key non-government organisations to improve health literacy, and support navigation 
and access to services. Content for the site was developed with members of the international student community 
to ensure relevance, cultural appropriateness of materials, and engagement with the audience.
Illawarra Shoalhaven 
Local Health District
All multicultural and refugee health team activity is captured within eMR and non-admitted patient data systems. 
This informs the District of current activity and trends about service delivery, and is used to determine population 
priorities and resource allocation. CALD demographic data has supported recruitment of a CALD Healthy Ageing 
specialist within the Multicultural Health Service to build the District’s capacity in responding appropriately to 
this cohort. Activity data of the Refugee Health team has demonstrated significant activity in addressing responses 
to clients requiring intervention for NDIS and My Aged Care packages.
Justice Health and Forensic 
Mental Health Network
The Network initiated a new Digital Family and Carer Hub project aimed at the families and carers of patients in the 
Forensic Hospital. The project has a strong co-design component and includes CALD families and carers who 
participate in consultation, development and review of the Hub. The Network has also implemented a code in the 
clinical applications system to identify all CALD patients. A dashboard is being developed so that data can be used 
for planning purposes to respond to health needs for CALD patients in correctional centres.
Southern NSW 
Local Health District
The District is undertaking work as part of its National Safety and Quality Health Service Standard 2 Action plan 
to improve relationships with its CALD communities and develop stronger ties prior to community members coming 
into the hospital system. Population Health has also used epidemiological advice to support targeted initiatives, such 
as the establishment of multicultural transition-to-school supported playgroups in Queanbeyan-Palerang LGA.
South Western Sydney 
Local Health District
The District has developed a two-year Multicultural Services Implementation Plan 2021-2023, which presents 
the District’s vision for improving the health and wellbeing of its migrant communities and ensuring health services 
are responsive, consumer and carer/family centred, well integrated, equitable and accessible.

in operating grants being paid to affiliated health 
organisations.
Revenue
Key items include a range of fees for medical services 
rendered, consisting of Department of Veterans’ Affairs, 
private health funds for privately insured patients, workers 
compensation and non-patient fees ($936 million), the 
sales and recoveries of pharmaceutical supplies, mainly 
the recoup of costs from the Commonwealth through 
Medicare for highly specialist drugs ($411 million), and 
compensable payments received from motor vehicle 
insurers for the costs of people hospitalised or receiving 
treatment as a result of motor vehicle accident ($170 
million).
Commonwealth Payments as part of the National Health 
Reform Agreement are receipted under grants and 
contributions ($8.2 billion).
NSW Health’s full-year capital expenditure allocation 
for 2020-21 (excluding capital expensing) was $2.9 billion 
for works in progress and completed works. The total 
capital allocation in 2020-21 represents 11 per cent 
of the total Property, Plant, Equipment and Intangibles 
asset base.

billion. This is made up of total assets of $29.5 billion,

Implementation of price determination
The NSW State Efficient Price per national weighted 
activity unit (NWAU20) for 2020-21 was $4727. NSW local 
health districts and specialty health networks were funded 
for their activity in 2020-21 at this single price, with 
exception for some specific contractual funding 
arrangements. The NSW State Efficient Price is not 
directly comparable year on year due to changes in NWAU 
versions and local health district and specialty health 
network costing results.
Non-government funding
Each year, NSW Health allocates funding to non-
government organisations (NGOs) to deliver community-
based services supporting health and wellbeing, 
particularly for vulnerable or hard-to-reach populations. 
Aboriginal health, aged care, children, youth and families, 
chronic care and disability, community transport, drug and 
alcohol, mental health, palliative care, population health 
and women’s health are among the services for which 
NSW Health provides funding.

Notes: 1. The reporting of all suppliers excludes payments between NSW Health entities. 2. The reporting of small business suppliers is in 
accordance with the definitions and requirements for small business as prescribed in the NSW Treasury Circular 11/21 Payment of Accounts.
Commentary: Time for payment of accounts for the NSW Ministry of Health showed a consistent performance over the year. During the 
year, measures have been taken to ensure Ministry staff are aware of NSW Treasury Circular 11/21 including conducting training sessions 
to educate relevant personnel about invoice approval processes. Actions are taken to monitor and promptly follow up invoice payments. 
The NSW Ministry of Health was not required to make any payment of interest on overdue accounts related to small business suppliers 
in the 2020-21 financial year.

NSW Treasury Managed Fund
Insurable risks are covered by the NSW Treasury Managed 
Fund (TMF), of which the NSW Ministry of Health (and its 
controlled organisations) is a member agency. The Health 
portfolio is a significant proportion of the TMF Fund and is 
identified as an independent pool within the TMF Scheme.
NSW Treasury provides funding to NSW Health via a 
benchmark process. NSW Health pays deposit contributions 
to icare for workers compensation, motor vehicle, liability, 
property, and miscellaneous lines of business.
Workers compensation and motor vehicle contributions 
are actuarially determined and include an experience 
factor. The aim of the deposit contribution funding is to 
allocate deposit contributions across the TMF with 
reference to benchmark expectations of relative claims 
costs for the agencies in the TMF, and to provide a 
financial incentive to improve injury and claims 
management outcomes.
In September 2020, the NSW Ministry of Health held a 
series of workshops aimed at identifying opportunities to 
improve claims management efficiency in all areas 
of the TMF cover: motor vehicle, property, miscellaneous, 
VMOs and medical negligence. The NSW Ministry of 
Health and local health district representatives attended 
the facilitated workshops with icare claims managers and 
technical experts. The workshops highlighted accessible 
improvements to coordinated claims management and 
established productive forums for ongoing collaboration.
The NSW Ministry of Health streamlined the process 
for issuing a certificate of currency for specific activities. 
Previously, the Ministry had reviewed applications 
accompanied by a risk management plan. 
Since the change was introduced in May 2021, Health 
organisations have approved their own activities by 
assessing risk exposure and developing risk management 
plans, accounting for safety, inherent hazards and policy 
requirements.
Asset management
Key achievements
The NSW Ministry of Health supported by Health Infrastructure 
continues to lead the implementation of the NSW Health 
Asset Management Framework with a focus in 2020-21 
on developing awareness of the current systems and asset 
management operations across Health organisations, 
while continuing to embed and strengthen NSW Health 
asset management governance to facilitate improved and 
informed asset management decision making.
NSW Health developed the inaugural NSW Health 
Strategic Asset Management Plan (SAMP) and Asset 
Management Plan (AMP) aligned to the whole-of-
government Asset Management Policy for the NSW Public 
Sector and completed the first attestation rotation. 
These documents determine NSW Health’s approach to 
managing all class of assets and to ensure investment 
priorities are identified to support safe, sustainable and 
high-quality care for NSW citizens. Health entities also 
completed their own SAMPs and AMPs, highlighting asset 
management investment priorities as well as current 
business-as-usual practices. This information will be used 
by NSW Health to identify gaps and trends across the 
system to focus future resources and develop the next 
statewide SAMP and AMP for submission to NSW 
Treasury and Infrastructure NSW.
The first round of agency asset management maturity 
assessment was conducted to enable development of 
a NSW Health Asset Management Implementation 
Plan. The plan has been initiated to manage the integration 

of the NSW Health asset management frameworks 
and build on existing asset management capability to 
drive future initiatives.

INDEPENDENT AUDITOR’S REPORT 
Ministry of Health (the Ministry) and the Consolidated Entity 
 
To the Members of the New South Wales Parliament 
Opinion 
I have audited the accompanying financial statements of the Ministry of Health (the Ministry) and the 
Consolidated Entity, which comprise the Statement by the Accountable Authority, the Statements of 
Comprehensive Income for the year ended 30 June 2021, the Statements of Financial Position as at 
30 June 2021, the Statements of Changes in Equity and the Statements of Cash Flows for the year 
then ended, notes comprising a Statement of Significant Accounting Policies and other explanatory 
information regarding the Ministry and the Consolidated Entity. The Consolidated Entity comprises the 
Ministry and the entities it controlled at the year’s end or from time to time during the financial year. 
In my opinion, the financial statements: 
• 
have been prepared in accordance with Australian Accounting Standards and the applicable 
financial reporting requirements of the Government Sector Finance Act 2018 (GSF Act), the 
Government Sector Finance Regulation 2018 (GSF Regulation) and the Treasurer's Directions 
• 
presents fairly the financial position, financial performance and cash flows of the Ministry and 
the Consolidated Entity 
 
My opinion should be read in conjunction with the rest of this report. 
 
Basis for Opinion 
I conducted my audit in accordance with Australian Auditing Standards. My responsibilities under the 
standards are described in the ‘Auditor’s Responsibilities for the Audit of the Financial Statements’ 
section of my report. 
I am independent of the Ministry and the Consolidated Entity in accordance with the requirements of 
the: 
• 
Australian Auditing Standards 
• 
Accounting Professional and Ethical Standards Board’s APES 110 ‘Code of Ethics for 
Professional Accountants (including Independence Standards)’ (APES 110). 
 
I have fulfilled my other ethical responsibilities in accordance with APES 110. 
Parliament promotes independence by ensuring the Auditor-General and the Audit Office of 
New South Wales are not compromised in their roles by: 
• 
providing that only Parliament, and not the executive government, can remove an 
Auditor-General 
• 
mandating the Auditor-General as auditor of public sector agencies 
• 
precluding the Auditor-General from providing non-audit services. 
 
I believe the audit evidence I have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for my 
audit opinion.

Key Audit Matters 
Key audit matters are those matters that, in my professional judgement, were of most significance in 
my audit of the financial statements for the year ended 30 June 2021. These matters were addressed 
in the context of my audit of the financial statements as a whole, and in forming my opinion thereon, I 
do not provide a separate opinion on these matters.  
Key Audit Matter 
How my audit addressed the matter 
Valuation of Property, plant and equipment 
Refer to Note 25 Property, plant and equipment 
At 30 June 2021, the Consolidated Entity reported 
$23.5 billion in infrastructure, property, plant and 
equipment measured at fair value. This is comprised 
of $21.5 billion (land and buildings), $1.4 billion (Plant 
and Equipment) and $0.6 billion (Infrastructure 
Systems) 
I considered this area a key audit matter due to the: 
• 
financial significance, geographical distribution 
and specialised or unique nature of health and 
health infrastructure assets;  
• 
high degree of management judgement required 
in respect of classifying project costs as capital or 
expense; and 
• 
complexities associated with the application of 
AASB 13 Fair Value Measurement being 
dependent on assumptions that require 
significant judgement in areas such as:  
- 
identifying components of buildings and 
determining their current replacement cost 
- 
forecasting remaining useful lives  
- 
application of discount rates 
- 
assessment of the conditions of the assets 
- 
assessment of the financial impact of 
indicators of impairment. 
 
 
To address the key audit matter, I: 
• 
assessed the adequacy of management's review 
of the valuation process; 
• 
assessed the competence, capabilities and 
objectivity of management's valuers; 
• 
reviewed the scope and instructions provided to 
valuers and obtained an understanding of the 
methodology used and its appropriateness with 
reference to relevant Australian Accounting 
Standards and Treasurer’s Directions; 
• 
assessed the appropriateness of the components 
of buildings used for measuring gross 
replacement cost with reference to common 
industry practice;  
• 
tested a sample of costs allocated to work in 
progress to assess the appropriateness of 
capitalisation in accordance with the Australian 
Accounting Standards; 
• 
evaluated whether the useful lives applied to the 
various asset classes were consistent with 
management's planned usage of those assets;  
• 
assessed the reasonableness and 
appropriateness of judgement used by 
management to assess non-financial assets for 
impairment. This included the process employed 
to monitor impairment indicators; and 
• 
assessed the adequacy of the financial statement 
disclosures against the requirements of 
applicable Australian Accounting Standards and 
Treasurer’s Directions.  
 
Existence and valuation of COVID-19 vaccine inventories 
Refer to Note 22 Inventories  
 
At 30 June 2021 the Consolidated Entity reported 
COVID-19 vaccines received from the 
Commonwealth and distributed to the public for no 
consideration at $22.3 million and $17.1 million, 
respectively. 
As part of the COVID-19 Vaccine National Roll-out 
Strategy, the Australian Government assumes 
responsibility for procuring and distributing vaccine 
supplies to states and territories. Vaccines are 
received for nil consideration and are provided to the 
public free of charge.  
 
To address the key audit matter, I: 
• 
obtained an understanding of the systems and 
processes introduced to manage vaccine flows; 
• 
reviewed and verified the key components of 
management's approach to valuing the two key 
inventory lines relevant for 2021 financial 
reporting period; and 
• 
tested a sample of transactions verifying 
quantities back to source documentation.

Annual Report 2020-21   :  Financial report   :  page 116
 
 
Key Audit Matter 
How my audit addressed the matter 
I considered this area a key audit matter due to the: 
• 
complexities of the procurement and distribution 
processes with the Commonwealth; 
• 
complexities associated in obtaining a reliable 
measurement basis for the vaccines; and 
• 
evolving nature of the systems and processes in 
place to manage, track and account for physical 
inventory movements across a variety of 
distribution centres spread around NSW. 
Existence and valuation of general inventories 
Refer to Note 22 Inventories 
At 30 June 2021, the Consolidated Entity reported 
$635.8 million in inventories, of which, $337.7 million 
was related to COVID-19. 
I considered this area a key audit matter due to the: 
• 
significance of the balance relative to the 
consolidated entity's Statement of Financial 
Position; 
• 
variety and number of inventory items managed 
across several locations; and 
• 
subjectivity and high degree of judgement 
required in respect of the calculations and 
modelling supporting management's assessment 
of impairment, particularly with regards to 
COVID-19 inventory balances. 
 
To address the key audit matter, I  
• 
observed the performance of management's 
stocktaking procedures at a selection of 
warehouses; 
• 
obtained an understanding of management's 
impairment calculator by seeking to test the: 
- 
mathematical accuracy of the model; and 
- 
robustness of the model's key inputs, which 
relied on "best before dates" and 
"consumption data"; and 
• 
substantiated a sample of transactions to verify 
"best before dates" and "consumption data”. 
Recognition and measurement of Commonwealth grants and contributions revenue  
Refer to Note 11 Grants and Other Contributions 
During the year, over $8 billion was received in 
Commonwealth grants and contributions through the 
National Health Reform Agreement (NHRA) and the 
National Partnership Agreement (NPA) in 2020–21. 
I considered this area a key audit matter due to the: 
• 
significance of the balance relative to the 
consolidated entity's Statement of 
Comprehensive Income; 
• 
different types of performance obligations 
attached to each revenue stream; 
• 
continuous funding received over more than one 
financial reporting period; and 
• 
evolving nature of the funding arrangements in 
response to the emerging COVID-19 pandemic. 
 
To address the key audit matter, I: 
• 
documented and understood the nature of the 
key revenue streams relating to the Hospital 
Service and State Public Health Payments; 
Private Hospital Capacity and Viability Payments; 
and Payments for the Co-ordination and Delivery 
of a Safe and Effective COVID-19 vaccine; 
• 
reviewed the terms and conditions contained 
within the key funding agreements entered with 
the Commonwealth; 
• 
assessed the key accounting treatments applied 
to each type of grant funding stream. 
 
Valuation of Hotel Quarantine receivables 
Refer to Note 20 Receivables 
At 30 June 2021, the Consolidated Entity reported a 
gross receivables balance of $107 million with an 
associated expected credit loss (ECL) of $10 million, 
relating to returning travellers processed through the 
NSW Hotel Quarantine system. Returning travellers 
are charged a fixed fee for their stay, with fees being 
effective since 18 July 2020. 
 
 
To address the key audit matter, I  
• 
assessed the adequacy of management's 
methodology and the underlying assumptions in 
calculating the ECL; 
• 
reviewed the movements in the receivables 
profile and analysed collection rates

Key Audit Matter 
How my audit addressed the matter 
I considered this area a key audit matter due to the: 
• 
significance of the balance relative to the 
Consolidated Entity's total receivables balance; 
• 
high level of estimation uncertainties and 
complexities around inputs used in calculating 
the expected credit loss (ECL); and 
• 
evolving nature of the processes and controls 
involved in managing the balance in response to 
the COVID-19 pandemic. 
from July 2020 to post year end to understand 
potential patterns of collectability; and 
• 
performed testing, on a sample basis, of 
subsequent receipts post year end. 
 
Secretary's Responsibilities for the Financial Statements 
The Secretary is responsible for the preparation and fair presentation of the financial statements in 
accordance with Australian Accounting Standards and the GSF Act, GSF Regulations and Treasurer’s 
Directions. The Secretary's responsibility also includes such internal control as the Secretary 
determines what is necessary to enable the preparation and fair presentation of the financial 
statements that are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error. 
In preparing the financial statements, the Secretary is responsible for assessing the ability of the 
Ministry and the consolidated entity to continue as a going concern, disclosing as applicable, matters 
related to going concern and using the going concern basis of accounting. 
Auditor’s Responsibilities for the Audit of the Financial Statements 
My objectives are to: 
• 
obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements as a whole are free from 
material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error 
• 
issue an Independent Auditor’s Report including my opinion. 
 
Reasonable assurance is a high level of assurance, but does not guarantee an audit conducted in 
accordance with Australian Auditing Standards will always detect material misstatements. 
Misstatements can arise from fraud or error. Misstatements are considered material if, individually or 
in aggregate, they could reasonably be expected to influence the economic decisions users take 
based on the financial statements. 
A description of my responsibilities for the audit of the financial statements is located at the Auditing 
and Assurance Standards Board website at: www.auasb.gov.au/auditors_responsibilities/ar5.pdf. The 
description forms part of my auditor’s report. 
The scope of my audit does not include, nor provide assurance: 
• 
that the Ministry or the consolidated entity carried out their activities effectively, efficiently and 
economically 
• 
about the assumptions used in formulating the budget figures disclosed in the financial 
statements 
• 
about the security and controls over the electronic publication of the audited financial 
statements on any website where they may be presented 
• 
about any other information which may have been hyperlinked to/from the financial statements.

Principles of consolidation
These consolidated financial statements for the year ended 30 June 2021 have been authorised for issue by the Secretary,
NSW Health on the date the accompanying statement was signed.
The financial statements of the controlled entities are prepared for the same reporting period as the parent entity using uniform
accounting policies for like transactions and other events in similar circumstances. As a result, no adjustments were required
for any dissimilar accounting policies.
The consolidated financial statements comprise the financial statements of the parent entity and its controlled entities, after
elimination of all inter-entity transactions and balances. The controlled entities are consolidated from the date the parent entity
obtained control and until such time as control passes.
The Ministry of Health (the Ministry or Parent) is a NSW government entity and is controlled by the State of New South Wales,
which is the immediate and ultimate parent. The Ministry is a not-for-profit entity (as profit is not its principal objective) and it
has no cash generating units. The Ministry and its controlled entities are consolidated as part of the NSW Total State Sector
Accounts.
The Ministry controls the Local Health Districts established from 1 January 2011, as well as other controlled entities
constituted under the Health Services Act 1997 which include:
The Health Administration Corporation includes the operations of:
The Ministry and its controlled entities are collectively referred to as the consolidated entity.
The consolidated financial statements also include results for the parent entity thereby capturing the central administrative
function of the Ministry.

●

Cash flows are included in the consolidated Statement of Cash Flows on a gross basis. However, the GST components of
cash flows arising from investing and financing activities which are recoverable from, or payable to, the Australian Taxation
Office are classified as operating cash flows.
Since March 2020, the NSW Government has committed more than $4.0 billion to support NSW Health to increase its capacity
and to manage the ongoing impacts of COVID-19. The 2021-22 NSW Budget included over $30 billion for the NSW Health
Cluster. This was enshrined in legislation on 28 June 2021 in Division 3 of the Appropriation Act 2021 No 18.
The Commonwealth has entered a National Partnership Agreement (NPA), in response to the COVID-19 pandemic, with
States and Territories, including NSW. The Agreement delivers funding to public hospitals and provides stability and certainty
of funding while ensuring access to health services in public hospitals.
The consolidated financial statements are general purpose financial statements which have been prepared on an accruals
basis and in accordance with:
applicable Australian Accounting Standards (AAS) (which include Australian Accounting Interpretations);
applicable requirements of the Government Sector Finance Regulation 2018 ('the Act');  and 
Treasurer's Directions issued under the Act.
receivables and payables are stated with the amount of GST included.
Income, expenses and assets are recognised net of the amount of GST, except that the:
Property, plant and equipment and financial assets at fair value are measured using the fair value basis. Other financial
statement items are prepared in accordance with the historical cost convention except where specified otherwise.
Judgements, key assumptions and estimations management has made are disclosed in the relevant notes to the consolidated
financial statements.
All amounts are rounded to the nearest one thousand dollars (unless otherwise stated) and are expressed in Australian
currency, which is the consolidated entity's presentation and functional currency.
The consolidated financial statements and notes comply with Australian Accounting Standards which include Australian
Accounting Interpretations.
amount of GST incurred by the consolidated entity as a purchaser that is not recoverable from the Australian Taxation
Office is recognised as part of an asset's cost of acquisition or as part of an item of expense; and
The Novel Coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic in late February 2020 saw a decline in expected hospital activities. The
Australian Government imposed restrictions on health systems, including a suspension of non-urgent elective surgeries, to
ensure increased public hospital capacity would be available. Ongoing critical resources in 2021 have been reassigned to
treat, test and manage for surges of COVID-19 cases. A free COVID-19 vaccination program for all Australian citizens,
permanent residents, and most visa-holders has commenced during 2021.
Despite the impact of COVID-19, these statements have been prepared on a going concern basis.

Comparative information
(h)
Changes in accounting policy, including new or revised Australian Accounting Standards
(i)
Service Concession Arrangements are contracts between an operator and a grantor, where the operator provides public
services related to a service concession asset on behalf of the grantor for a specified period of time and manages at least
some of those services.
Where AASB 1059 applies, the grantor recognises the service concession asset when the grantor obtains control of the
asset and measures the service concession asset at current replacement cost. At the same time the grantor recognises a
corresponding financial liability or unearned revenue liability or a combination of both.
Several other amendments and interpretations apply for the first time in 2020-21, but do not have an impact on the
financial statements of the consolidated entity.
AASB 1059 is effective for the consolidated entity from 1 July 2020. At the same time NSW Treasury Policy and
Guideline Paper TPP 06-8: Accounting for Privately Financed Projects (TPP 06-8) was withdrawn effective from 1 July
2020.
Non-monetary items that are measured in terms of historical cost in a foreign currency are translated using the exchange rates
at the dates of the initial transactions. Non-monetary items measured at fair value in a foreign currency are translated using
the exchange rates at the date when the fair value is determined. The gain or loss arising on translation of non-monetary items
measured at fair value is treated in line with the recognition of the gain or loss on the change in fair value of the item (i.e.
translation differences on items whose fair value gain or loss is recognised in other comprehensive income or net results are
also recognised in other comprehensive income or net results, respectively).
Certain comparative information has been reclassified to ensure alignment with current year presentation. 
Except when an Australian Accounting Standard permits or requires otherwise, comparative information is presented in
respect of the previous period for all amounts reported in the financial statements.
The accounting policies applied in 2020-21 are consistent with those of the previous financial year except as a result of
new or revised Australian Accounting Standards that have been applied for the first time as follows:
The consolidated entity applied AASB 1059 Service Concession Arrangements: Grantors (AASB 1059) for the first time.
Upon introduction of AASB 1059, TPP 06-8 Accounting for Privately Financed Projects (TPP 06-8) was withdrawn. The
nature and effect of the changes as a result of adoption of this new accounting standard and withdrawal of TPP 06-8 are
described below.
Effective for the first time in FY2020-21
AASB 1059 Service Concession Arrangements: Grantors (AASB 1059)
Differences arising on settlement or translation of monetary items are recognised in net result.
Transactions in foreign currencies are recorded using the spot rate at the date the transaction first qualifies for recognition.
Monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies are translated at the functional currency spot rates of
exchange at the end of the reporting date.

Borrowings
Other liabilities
Other comprehensive income was mainly impacted with the revaluation movements for the new service
concession assets.
Financial liabilities were remeasured at fair value at the date of transition impacting the borrowing amounts;
Statement of Comprehensive Income was respectively impacted with increased revenue and expenses arising
from higher assets and liabilities; and
Existing emerging asset balances under other assets were derecognised;
New assets were recognised as service concession assets under property, plant and equipment with a
corresponding 'grant of a right to operate liability' recorded under other liabilities;
The adoption of AASB 1059 did not have a material impact on the Statement of Cash Flows for the consolidated entity.
The nature of these adjustments on the consolidated entity is described below:
A number of existing arrangements are now accounted for as per the requirements of AASB 1059. The adoption of
AASB 1059 has led to the following material impacts:
Property, plant and equipment
Equity
Asset revaluation surplus
Total adjustments to equity

AASB 1059 Service Concession Arrangements: Grantors (AASB 1059) (continued)
The adoption of AASB 1059 did not have an impact on the Statement of Comprehensive Income, Statement of Financial
Position and the Statement of Cash Flows for the parent entity for the financial year.
Effective for the first time in FY2020-21 (continued)
Under AASB 16 lessor accounting, a lease receivable has been recognised at an amount equal to the net investment in
the lease. For both arrangements, the amount recognised is the discounted value of the unguaranteed residual value
accruing to the lessor where the leased assets are handed over to the consolidated entity at the end of the lease term.
PARENT
Withdrawal of TPP 06-8 Accounting for Privately Financed Projects (TPP 06-8)
For the other arrangements, the consolidated entity has previously recognised finance lease assets and liabilities in
accordance with TPP 06-8 and AASB 117 Leases. Upon withdrawal of TPP 06-8, the finance lease assets were
reclassified to property, plant and equipment and the finance lease liability was reclassified as external borrowings. The
reclassification did not change the asset or liability values or the presentation in the Statement of Comprehensive Income,
Statement of Financial Position and Statement of Cash Flows.
The Chris O'Brien Lifehouse, Sydney Eye Hospital Carpark, Royal North Shore Hospital Public Private Partnership,
Newcastle Mater Hospital Public Private Partnership, Long Bay Prison and Forensic Hospital Public Private Partnership
and Orange and Associated Health Services Public Private Partnership were previously accounted for under TPP 06-8
Accounting for Privately Financed Projects (TPP 06-8). TPP 06-8 has been withdrawn from 1 July 2020 following the
introduction of AASB 1059 Service Concession Arrangements (AASB 1059). This is because many arrangements to
which TPP 06-8 applied, now fall within the scope of AASB 1059. However, based on the consolidated entity’s
assessment, these arrangements are outside the scope of AASB 1059.
Upon the withdrawal of TPP 06-8, management has used its judgement and determined that Chris O'Brien Lifehouse and
Sydney Eye Hospital Carpark arrangements should now be accounted for under AASB 16 Leases and the remaining
arrangements accounted for under AASB 116 Property, Plant and Equipment and AASB 9 Financial Instruments as a
change in accounting policy. This is because management has determined that adopting AASB 16, AASB 116 and AASB
9 best reflects the economic substance of the arrangement and provides the most reliable and relevant information about
the effects of the arrangement on the consolidated entity’s Statement of Comprehensive Income, Statement of Financial
Position and Statement of Cash Flows.

Recognition and Measurement
Insurance
The consolidated entity's insurance activities are conducted through the NSW Treasury Managed Fund (TMF) Scheme of
self insurance for Government entities. The expense (premium) is determined by Insurance and Care NSW (iCare), an entity
controlled by the ultimate parent, based on past claims experience. The TMF is operated by NSW Self Insurance
Corporation (SiCorp), an entity controlled by the ultimate parent.
1 New/replacement equipment under $10,000 has been restated to be $0.94 million lower in the prior year for the consolidated
entity. Refer to Note 1(h) for further details.
During 2019-20 $184.1 million in viability payments under the National Partnership Agreement on COVID-19 Response was
paid to private hospitals by the parent entity. During the current year, refunds of $64.2 million were received from private
hospitals for the overpayment of viability payments in 2019-20. These overpayments were the result of the financial impact
on the private hospitals being shorter and less severe than initially anticipated. Much of the health sector returned to normal
operating activities within a relatively short period of time. These refunds were recorded against current year expenses,
resulting in a negative expense for the year.
Operating expenses generally represent the day-to-day running costs incurred in the normal operations of the consolidated
entity. These costs are expensed as incurred. The recognition and measurement policy for non-employee related expenses
is detailed in Note 31.
Operating expenses
Maintenance expense
Day-to-day servicing costs or maintenance are charged as expenses as incurred, except where they relate to the
replacement or enhancement of a part or component of an asset, in which case the costs are capitalised and depreciated.

Leases of assets that are valued at $10,000 or under when new.
The consolidated entity recognises the lease payments associated with the following types of leases as an expense on a
straight-line basis:
Leases that meet the definition of short-term. i.e. where the lease term at commencement of the lease is 12 months or
less. This excludes leases with a purchase option.
Variable lease payments are not included in the measurement of the lease liability (i.e. variable lease payments that do not
depend on an index or a rate, initially measured using the index or rate as at the commencement date). These payments are
recognised in the period in which the event or condition that triggers those payments occurs.

Recognition and Measurement
Grants and subsidies generally comprise contributions in cash or in kind to controlled entities of the Ministry (from the
parent entity), affiliated health organisations, various local government authorities and not-for-profit community
organisations to support their health-related objectives and activities. The grants and subsidies are expensed on the
transfer of the cash or assets. The transferred assets are measured at their fair value.
Finance costs consist of interest and other costs incurred in connection with the borrowing of funds. Finance costs are
recognised as expenses in the period in which they are incurred, in accordance with NSW Treasury’s mandate to not-for-
profit NSW General Government Sector entities.
* Of the interest expense from financial liabilities at amortised cost, $0.8 million (2020: $0.8 million) related to financial
liabilities relating to service concession arrangements. Refer to Note 25 for further details on service concession
arrangements.
1 Finance costs - interest expense from lease liabilities has been restated to be $0.96 million lower in the prior year for the consolidated 
entity.  Refer to Note 1(h) for further details.

Appropriations and transfers to The Crown in right of the State of New South Wales (Crown) (continued)
Summary of compliance (continued)
●
●
●
The impact of this legal uncertainty means the balance of own source revenue brought forward and carried forward in the
table will not necessarily be reflective of the appropriations authority available to the Ministry of Health or its responsible
ministers.
Portion of the amounts authorised under the Appropriations Act for the services of The Ministry of Health, other relevant
variations to appropriations authorities, amounts that have been received by The Ministry of Health as cluster grants to
Health Care Complaints Commission and Mental Health Commissions and the agency’s own source revenue, with 
The Ministry of Health’s actual spending for the year, including payments to other state government agencies.
Appropriations authorities and spending limits, under the Appropriations Act , and from deemed appropriations are given to
the relevant responsible minister(s) and not directly to individual agencies. Officers of agencies reporting to those ministers
are then delegated authority to incur expenditure under delegation instruments issued by those ministers. Therefore,
compliance with aggregate spending limits under the Appropriation Act and deemed appropriations should normally be
assessed at the responsible minister(s)’ level unless the delegation instrument for an agency expressly creates a sub-limit
for the agency as a whole (which is unusual). The Ministry of Health has confirmed that its delegation instruments do not
have sub-limits for the agency as a whole.
To provide information related to the Ministry of Health’s spending, the summary of compliance table compares:
Balances for the consolidated entity in the table excludes monies received from the agency’s own-source revenue from other
clusters who have different responsible ministers, as comprising part of the authority to spend.
There is some complexity and uncertainty in respect of the legal implication of monies received by the agency from an
agency in another cluster who has a different responsible minister. If those monies are paid from the Consolidated Fund and
remain within the Consolidated Fund on receipt the appropriations authority limits of the responsible minister(s) of the paying
and receiving agencies will not have been automatically adjusted on transfer of the money. This means the appropriations
limit of the receiving responsible minister(s) will not have been increased. Therefore, there is a technical risk that the actual
expenditure exceeds the aggregate legal limit authorised for the receiving responsible minister(s) for the relevant reporting
period; on the other hand, the paying responsible minister(s) may have unutilised legal spending authority. The total
appropriations limits in the Appropriations Act are not affected by this matter.
Income from appropriations, other than deemed appropriations (of which the accounting treatment is based on the
underlying transaction), does not contain enforceable and sufficiently specific performance obligations as defined by AASB
15. Therefore, except as specified below, appropriations (other than deemed appropriations) are recognised as income
when the entity obtains control over the assets comprising the appropriations. Control over appropriations is normally
obtained upon the receipt of cash.
Appropriations are not recognised as income in the following circumstances:
Equity appropriations to fund payments to adjust a for-profit entity’s capital structure are recognised as equity injections 
(i.e. contribution by owners) on receipt and equity withdrawals on payment to a for-profit entity.

The performance obligations in relation to patient 
services are typically satisfied as the health 
services are delivered to the chargeable 
inpatients and non-inpatients. Public patients are 
not charged for health services provided at 
public hospitals. Chargeable patients, including 
Medicare ineligible patients, privately insured 
patients, eligible veterans, compensable patients 
are billed for health services provided under 
various contractual arrangements. Billings are 
typically done upon patient discharge and is 
based on the rates specified by the Ministry of 
Health. The payments are typically due within 30 
days after the invoice date.
Revenue is recognised on an accrual basis 
when the service has been provided to the 
patient. In limited circumstances the price 
is not fully recovered, e.g. due to 
inadequate insurance policies, overseas 
patients returning to their home country 
before paying, etc. The likelihood of 
occurrences is considered on a case by 
case basis. In most instances revenue is 
initially recognised at full amounts and 
subsequently adjusted when more 
information is provided. No element of

Dividend revenue is recognised when the consolidated entity's right to receive the payment has been established.
Royalties are usually recognised when the underlying performance obligation is satisfied. It is recognised at the estimated
amount if the consideration is variable.
Interest revenue is calculated by applying the effective interest rate to the gross carrying amount of a financial asset except
for financial assets that subsequently become credit impaired. For financial assets that become credit impaired, the effective
interest rate is applied to the amortised cost of the financial asset (i.e. after deducting the loss allowance for expected credit
losses).

Income from grants to acquire / construct a recognisable non-financial asset to be controlled by the consolidated entity is
recognised when the consolidated entity satisfies its obligations under the transfer. The consolidated entity satisfies the
performance obligation under the transfer over time as the non-financial assets are being constructed. The percentage of
cost incurred is used to recognise income, because this most closely reflects the progress to completion.
Revenue from grants with sufficiently specific performance obligations are recognised when the consolidated entity satisfies
a performance obligation by transferring the promised goods or services.

Grants and other contributions (continued)
The consolidated entity uses various methods to recognise revenue over time, depending on the nature and terms and
conditions of the grant contract. The payments are typically based on an agreed timetable or on achievement of different
milestones set up in the contract. Revenue is recognised as follows:
The consolidated entity typically receives grants in respect of:
Commonwealth government funded grant under the National Health Reform Agreement to improve the state's health
outcomes and ensure sustainability of the health system;
Commonwealth government funded grant under the National Partnership Agreement on COVID-19 Response which
provides stability and certainty of funding while responding to the COVID-19 pandemic;
NSW government funded grant from the NSW Treasurer's state contingency fund to assist in the response to the
COVID-19 pandemic; and
Other various grants in respect of research, clinical drug trials and other community, health and wellbeing related
projects.
Commonwealth National Health Reform - consists of Activity Based Funding, Public Health Funding and Block Funding.
Activity Based Funding is recognised under AASB 15 Revenue from Contracts with Customers (AASB 15), while Public
Health and Block Funding is recognised under AASB 1058 Income of Not-for-Profit Entities (AASB 1058) due to lack of
specific performance obligations. Revenue for Activity Based Funding is recognised when the hospital activities are
performed. The revenue is calculated by the activity multiplied by the agreed National Weighted Activity Unit price. For
2019-20 and the current year, the Commonwealth has provided a funding guarantee to the states and territories. The
Commonwealth undertakes an annual reconciliation of reported activity (revenue) against funding payments made for
that year. Any differences arising from the reported activity (revenue) in previous years, is adjusted in the current year
annual reconciliation.
Commonwealth National Partnership Agreement on COVID-19 - under the agreement, the Commonwealth pays for 50
per cent of costs incurred by hospitals and state public health authorities to assess, diagnose, treat and contain COVID-
19. The Commonwealth also provided viability payments for private hospitals to ensure states and territories have
access to private hospital beds, staffing and resources (such as personal protective equipment and ventilators) to
support their ongoing response to the pandemic. Revenue under this agreement is recognised when actual costs are
incurred.
Other grants and contributions - consist of various types of grants and contributions received. The performance
obligations are typically satisfied when the specified activities / milestones agreed in the grant contract are
completed/met. Where there are no specific performance obligations, revenue is recognised on receipt of funding under
AASB 1058. The payments are typically made in advance or based on an agreed timetable.
Revenue from these grants is recognised based on the grant amount specified in the funding agreement / funding approval,
and revenue is only recognised to the extent that it is highly probable that a significant reversal will not occur. No element of
financing is deemed present as funding payments are usually received in advance or shortly after the relevant obligation is
satisfied.
Income from grants without sufficiently specific performance obligations is recognised when the consolidated entity obtains
control over the granted assets (e.g. cash).
Refer to Note 32 for the transaction price allocated to the performance obligations that have not been satisfied at the end of
the year and when it is expected to be recognised as revenue.

Treasury Managed Fund hindsight adjustment
The majority of the 'property not previously recognised' balance in the current year relates to a car park at Royal Prince
Alfred Hospital. The consolidated entity obtained full possession of the car park during the year which was valued at $11.88
million.
The consolidated entity receives or pays hindsight adjustments as part of a discretionary iCare scheme to encourage NSW
Government entities to improve their claim performance. As the hindsight adjustments are discretionary and not contractually 
required they are recognised as revenue or expense when they are declared and / or paid.
Other income arises from varying arrangements. Income is generally recognised on an accrual basis and/or when the right
to receive the income has been established in accordance with the substance of the relevant agreement.
Lease and rental income is accounted for on a straight-line basis over the lease term under AASB 16 Leases. The rental
income is incidental to the purpose for holding the property.
- other rental income
In 2020, the majority of the 'property not previously recognised' balance is the result of a long term lease with the University
of Sydney prematurely ending during the year. The buildings and infrastructure under the lease had previously been treated
as a finance lease and asset of the University of Sydney. With the premature termination of the lease, the building valued at
$22.04 million and infrastructure valued at $0.96 million were recognised by the consolidated entity during the year. The
values were derived from an independent valuation report.
* This revenue reflects the progressive unwinding of the 'grant of right to operate liability' (Note 35) over the remaining period 
of the arrangement. Refer to Note 25 for further details on service concession arrangements.
1 Other income - emerging assets of private sector provided infrastructure restated to be $4.55 million lower, other rental income restated
to be $5.01 million lower, revenue related to service concession arrangements to be $13.36 million higher and other to be $2.64 million
lower in the prior year for the consolidated entity.  Refer to Note 1(h) for further details.

16. Conditions on restrictions on income of not-for-profit entities
The consolidated entity receives various types of grants and donations from different grantors / donors, some of which may
not have enforceable performance obligations. The consolidated entity determines the grantor / donor expectations in
determining the externally imposed restrictions and discloses them in accordance with different types of restrictions. The
types of restrictions and income earned with restrictions are detailed in Note 30 Restricted assets.
Impairment losses may arise on non-financial assets held by the entity from time to time. Accounting for impairment losses
is dependent upon the individual asset (or group of assets) subject to impairment. Accounting Policies and events giving
rise to impairment losses are disclosed in the following notes:

17. Prior Period Errors
The Commonwealth has entered a National Partnership Agreement (NPA), in response to the COVID-19 pandemic, with
States and Territories, including NSW. One component of the Agreement contains state public health payments (SPHP) for
other COVID-19 activity undertaken by the State public health systems for the management and response to the pandemic.
Following further review of the state public health payments within the National Partnership Agreement (NPA), it has been
determined that the consolidated entity and the parent entity incorrectly omitted revenue that should of been recognised for
personal protective equipment (PPE) that was received before the 30 June 2020. On that basis, the consolidated entity and
the parent entity should have recognised additional revenue in their Statement of Comprehensive Income and a decreased
contract liability balance in the prior year.
The impact to the Statement of Comprehensive Income and Statement of Financial Position from restating the balances in
the prior year due to above matters are shown below. The restated balances in the Statement of Comprehensive Income
and Statement of Financial Position exclude the impact of changes in accounting standards and any reclassifications to
ensure alignment with current year presentation. Please refer to Note 1(h) for impacts of accounting standard impacts on
the consolidated entity.
The error has been corrected during the year, with retrospective adjustments made in the prior period in both the
consolidated entity and the parent entity. Grants and other contributions increased by $27 million and contract liabilities has
decreased by $27 million for the year ended 30 June 2020.

The NSW 2020-21 Budget Papers disaggregated the Ministry of Health’s financial information by ‘Outcome’ as a way to identify each major activity undertaken by the entity during the financial year. The Budget Papers were previously prepared by Program Group
under an earlier Outcome Budgeting structure. The former program group statements have been restated by outcome in line with the recent budget papers.

 (b) Outcome name and purpose of the Consolidated Entity
Outcome name
Outcome purpose
Outcome 1 -
People receive high-quality, safe care in 
our hospitals
This outcome reflects the state’s responsibility to manage and administer
public hospitals. When people are admitted to a hospital in NSW they can
expect world-class medical and surgical care within clinically recommended
timeframes.
Outcome 2 - 
People can access care in out of hospital 
settings to manage their health and 
wellbeing
This outcome reflects that healthcare extends beyond the hospital and
needs to connect across settings to reduce the burden of chronic disease,
assist people with conditions to live well and avoid complications, support
people to recover from illness and injury, and prevent avoidable
hospitalisations. NSW Health services funded to achieve this outcome
include non-admitted and community based services, sub-acute services,
hospital in the home, and dental services.
Outcome 3 - 
People receive timely emergency care
NSW Health often provides the first point of contact for those needing
access to emergency healthcare and is responsible for managing and
administering ambulance and emergency services.
Outcome 4 - 
Keeping people healthy through 
prevention and health promotion
This outcome reflects that preventive and population health is critical to
keeping people healthier. It covers a range of functions NSW Health is
responsible for including to protect and promote public health, control
infectious diseases, reduce preventive diseases and death, help people
manage their own health, and promote equitable health outcomes in the
community.
Outcome 5 - 
Our people and systems are continuously 
improving to deliver the best health 
outcomes and experiences
A skilled workforce with access to world leading education and training, and
a system that harnesses research and digital innovation essential to
continuously improving outcomes and experiences of care across the
system. These enablers are delivered by a range of statutory bodies and
system managers.

Recognition and Measurement
Subsequent measurement
The consolidated entity holds receivables with the objective to collect the contractual cash flows and therefore measures
them at amortised cost using the effective interest method, less any impairment. Changes are recognised in the net result for
the year when impaired, derecognised or through the amortisation process.
Details regarding credit risk of receivables that are neither past due nor impaired, are disclosed in Note 44.
(Increase) / decrease in allowance recognised in net 
result1
Allowance for expected credit losses of $106.1 million (2020: $67.9 million) includes an allowance on trade receivables from
contracts with customers of $102.2 million (2020: $63.4 million) and other receivables of $3.9 million (2020: $4.5 million).
¹ Includes impairment loss of $84.1 million (2019: $38.7 million) recognised on trade receivables from contracts with customers.
Receivables are initially recognised at fair value plus any directly attributable transaction costs. Trade receivables that do not
contain a significant financing component are measured at the transaction price.
All ‘regular way’ purchases or sales of receivables are recognised and derecognised on a trade date basis. Regular way
purchases or sales are purchases or sales of receivables that require delivery of assets within the time frame established by
regulation or convention in the marketplace.

For trade receivables, the consolidated entity applies a simplified approach in calculating ECLs. The consolidated entity
recognises a loss allowance based on lifetime ECLs at each reporting date. The consolidated entity has established a
provision matrix based on its historical credit loss experience for trade receivables, adjusted for forward looking factors
specific to the receivable.
The consolidated entity recognises an allowance for expected credit losses (ECLs) for all debt financial assets not held at
fair value through profit or loss. ECLs are based on the difference between the contractual cash flows and the cash flows
that the consolidated entity expects to receive, discounted at the original effective interest rate.
Contract assets relate to the consolidated entity’s right to consideration in exchange for goods and services transferred to
customers / works completed, but not billed at the reporting date. The contract assets are transferred to receivables when
the rights become unconditional. This usually occurs when the consolidated entity issues an invoice to the customer. The
balance of the contract assets relates to grants and other contributions for work completed but not yet invoiced as future
work is required to be completed before the consolidated entity has the rights to invoice. Once all performance obligations
are met and the consolidated entity has rights to invoice for the payment to be made, the contract asset is transferred to
receivables.
The contract asset balance has slightly reduced during the year due to the varying billing arrangements from contracts
existing at different reporting dates.
1 Contract receivables has been restated $165.13 million higher in the prior year for the consolidated entity and parent entity due to the
reclassification of interstate patient flows from other receivables to sale of goods and services from contracts with customers.

Obsolete items are disposed of in accordance with instructions issued by the Ministry. 
The cost of inventories acquired at no cost or for nominal consideration is the current replacement cost as at the date of
acquisition. Current replacement cost is the cost the consolidated entity would incur to acquire the asset. Net realisable
value is the estimated selling price in the ordinary course of business less the estimated costs of completion and the
estimated costs necessary to make the sale.
Material inventories are held for distribution (consumed in the ordinary activities of the consolidated entity). Inventories held
for distribution are stated at cost, adjusted when applicable, for any loss of service potential. A loss of service potential is
identified and measured based on the existence of a current replacement cost that is lower than the carrying amount or any
loss of operating capacity due to obsolescence. Costs are assigned to individual items of stock mainly on the basis of
weighted average costs.
Recognition and Measurement
The majority of the inventory is held for consumption in the ordinary activities of the consolidated entity and upon
consumption, are expensed in food supplies, medical and surgical supplies and pharmaceutical supplies (Note 3).
The consolidated entity has been holding higher levels of medical and surgical supplies since the outbreak of COVID-19.
Medical and surgical supplies are also consumed as part of the normal services provided by the consolidated entity.
In the current year, the consolidated entity has written-off $217 million (2020: $Nil) of inventories and made an allowance for
impairment of $558.7 million (2020: $Nil). Written-off items consist of inventory categories that are in unserviceable condition
(does not meet the clinical requirements) and have no alternative use before they expire. Allowance for impairment was
based on a consumption forecast model, on inventory categories that are likely to expire before they are consumed.

Classification and measurement
Recognition and Measurement
Financial assets at fair value through profit or loss
All ‘regular way’ purchases or sales of financial assets are recognised and derecognised on a trade date basis. Regular way
purchases or sales are purchases or sales of financial assets that require delivery of assets within the time frame
established by regulation or convention in the marketplace.
The consolidated entity's financial assets at fair value are classified, at initial recognition, at fair value through profit or loss.
Transaction costs of financial assets carried at fair value through profit or loss are expensed in net results. 
Financial assets with cash flows that are not solely payments of principal and interest are classified and measured at fair
value through profit or loss, irrespective of the business model. TCorpIM Funds are managed and their performance is
evaluated on a fair value basis and therefore the business model is neither to hold to collect contractual cash flows or sell
the financial asset. Hence these investments are mandatorily required to be measured at fair value through profit or loss.
Notwithstanding the criteria to be classified at amortised cost or at fair value through other comprehensive income, financial
assets may be designated at fair value through profit or loss on initial recognition if doing so eliminates, or significantly
reduces, an accounting mismatch.
Financial assets at fair value through profit or loss include financial assets designated upon initial recognition at fair value
through profit or loss, or financial assets mandatorily required to be measured at fair value under AASB 9 Financial 
Instruments (AASB 9).
Refer to Note 44 for further information regarding fair value measurement, credit risk, and market risk arising from financial
instruments.

The majority of intra health loans receivable within the parent entity is the result of cash advances provided to HealthShare
NSW to make all payments to employees and most payments to suppliers of goods and services and grants and subsidies
on behalf of the controlled entities.
1 Non-current other financial assets - receivables on finance leases as lessor has been restated to be $72.42 million higher in the prior
year for the consolidated entity. Refer to Note 1(h) for further details.
Refer to Note 44 for further information regarding fair value measurement, credit risk, and market risk arising from financial
instruments.
The consolidated entity recognises an allowance for expected credit losses (ECLs) for all debt financial assets not held at
fair value through profit or loss. ECLs are based on the difference between the contractual cash flows and the cash flows
that the consolidated entity expects to receive, discounted at the original effective interest rate.
Other financial assets are initially measured at fair value plus any transaction costs.
Subsequent measurement
Recognition and Measurement
All ‘regular way’ purchases or sales of other financial assets are recognised and derecognised on a trade date basis.
Regular way purchases or sales are purchases or sales of other financial assets that require delivery of assets within the
time frame established by regulation or convention in the marketplace.
Impairment
Other financial assets are classified and subsequently measured at amortised cost as they are held for collection of
contractual cash flows solely representing payments of principal and interest. Impairment losses are presented as a
separate line item in the Statement of Comprehensive Income. Any gain or loss arising on derecognition is recognised
directly in net results and presented in other gains / (losses) together with foreign exchange gains and losses.

24. Other financial assets (continued)
Impairment (continued)
ECLs are recognised in two stages. For credit exposures where there has not been a significant increase in credit risk since
initial recognition, ECLs are based on default events possible within the next 12-months (i.e. a 12-month ECL). If there has
been a significant increase in credit risk since initial recognition, a loss allowance is required for credit losses expected over
the remaining life of the exposure, irrespective of the timing of the default (i.e. a lifetime ECL). In addition, the consolidated
entity considers that there has been a significant increase in credit risk when contractual payments are more than 30 days
past due.
The consolidated entity's term deposits are issued by financial institutions that have strong credit ratings and are therefore
considered to be low credit risk investments. Hence the consolidated entity measures the loss allowance for term deposits at
an amount equal to a 12-month ECL. However, when there is a significant increase in credit risk since origination, the
allowance will be based on the lifetime ECL.
The consolidated entity uses the ratings from external credit rating agencies both to determine whether there has been a
significant increase in credit risk on the deposits and to estimate ECLs. These estimates are performed at every reporting
date.
For lease receivables, the entity applies the simplified approach permitted by AASB 9 Financial Instruments, where the loss
allowance is based on lifetime ECLs.

depreciable amount of each asset as it is consumed over its useful life to the consolidated entity.
All material identifiable components of assets are depreciated separately over their useful lives. 
Land is not a depreciable asset. Certain heritage assets including original artworks and collections and heritage buildings
may not have a limited useful life because appropriate curatorial and preservation policies are adopted. Such assets are not
subject to depreciation. The decision not to recognise depreciation for these assets is reviewed annually.
Details of depreciation rates initially applied for major asset categories are as follows:
Buildings                                                                                                            
Buildings - leasehold improvements
When a major inspection is performed, its cost is recognised in the carrying amount of the plant and equipment as a
replacement if the recognition criteria are satisfied.
Restoration costs
The present value of the expected cost for the restoration or cost of dismantling of an asset after its use is included in the
cost of the respective asset if the recognition criteria for a provision are met. 
Assets acquired at no cost, or for nominal consideration, are initially recognised at their fair value at the date of acquisition
(see also assets transferred as a result of an equity transfer in Note 36).
Recognition and Measurement
Acquisition of property, plant and equipment
Property, plant and equipment acquired are initially recognised at cost and subsequently revalued at fair value less
accumulated depreciation and impairment. Cost is the amount of cash or cash equivalents paid or the fair value of the other
consideration given to acquire the asset at the time of its acquisition or construction or, where applicable, the amount
attributed to that asset when initially recognised in accordance with the requirements of other Australian Accounting
Standards.
Major inspection costs
Land and buildings which are owned by the Health Administration Corporation or the State and operated by the parent or its
controlled entities are deemed to be controlled by the parent and its controlled entities and are recognised as such in the
financial statements.
Capitalisation thresholds
Property, plant and equipment and intangible assets costing $10,000 and above individually (or forming part of a network
costing more than $10,000) are capitalised.
Fair value is the price that would be received to sell an asset in an orderly transaction between market participants at
measurement date.
Where payment for an asset is deferred beyond normal credit terms, its cost is the cash price equivalent, i.e. the deferred
payment amount is effectively discounted over the period of credit.

Service concession assets
The consolidated entity has adopted AASB 1059 Service Concession Arrangements: Grantors (AASB 1059) from 1 July
2020. However, comparatives for the year ended 30 June 2020 have been adjusted retrospectively to reflect AASB 1059.
Note 1(h) details changes in the consolidated entity’s accounting policies and a summary of impacts on the first time
adoption. This note provides disclosures required under the new accounting standard and relates to the consolidated entity’s
service concession arrangements in place during the current year.
Service concession arrangements (SCAs) are contracts between a grantor and an operator where an operator provides
public services related to a service concession asset on behalf of a public sector grantor for a specified period of time and
manages at least some of those services.
Based on the consolidated entity’s assessment, the following arrangements fall in the scope of AASB 1059:
Right-of-Use Assets acquired by lessees
From 1 July 2019, AASB 16 Leases (AASB 16) requires a lessee to recognise a right-of-use asset for most leases. The
consolidated entity has elected to present right-of-use assets separately in the Statement of Financial Position.
Depreciation of property, plant and equipment (continued)
Plant and equipment comprises, among others, medical, computer and office equipment, motor vehicles, furniture and
fittings and PODS (a detachable or self - contained unit on ambulances used for patient treatment).
Infrastructure systems comprises public facilities which provide essential services and enhance the productive capacity of
the economy including roads, bridges, water infrastructure and distribution works, sewerage treatment plants, seawalls and
water reticulation systems. 
Further information on leases is contained at Note 26.
The estimated useful lives, residual values and depreciation methods are reviewed at the end of each reporting period and
adjusted if appropriate.

Description
The consolidated entity is obligated to provide both operators access to the hospital and the
carpark. The operators are responsible for the delivery of health services to public patients
at the hospital which the consolidated entity is obligated to pay for under the annual service
agreements. At the end of the arrangement, the operators are obligated to return all assets
back to the consolidated entity. For Northern Beaches Hospital, the consolidated entity will
be sharing a portion of the hospital facilities with the private operator for an additional term
of 20 years after the expiry of the concession period. The consolidated entity is required to
issue a notice outlining what shared services will be provided by different parties. The
consolidated entity has the right to extend the Northern Beaches Hospital arrangement for
up to five years, by way of giving three years notice to the operator. For Hawkesbury
Hospital, the right to extend has already been exercised prior to 1 July 2019 with no further
rights available in the existing agreement.
The consolidated entity has contracted HealthScope (Operator for Northern Beaches
Hospital) and St John of God Health Care (Operator for Hawkesbury Hospital) to build,
operate and manage the hospitals and the car park for the duration of the arrangement. The
construction of both hospitals was funded by the consolidated entity. Northern Beaches
Hospital was paid upfront on completion of the construction works, while Hawkesbury
Hospital was paid over time under a financing arrangement with the Operator. There are no
remaining future construction payments. The Operator has fully funded the Northern
Beaches car park, and the consolidated entity has granted rights to the Operator to operate
and generate revenue from that car park. Annual service level agreements are entered into
for the delivery of public health services at both hospitals with the Operator, which is funded
by the consolidated entity, paid on a monthly basis. 
Northern Beaches Hospital and Hawkesbury Hospital are two public hospitals built under
two separate Public Private Partnership (PPP) arrangements that are now treated as part of
service concession arrangements.

Consist of three arrangements:
The consolidated entity has contracted Infrashore (Operator) to build RNSH P2 car park and
manage both RNSH P1 and P2 car parks for the duration of the arrangement. The
construction of the RNSH P2 car park is funded by the consolidated entity, paid in
instalments under a financing arrangement for the duration of the term. RNSH P1 car park
was an existing carpark of the consolidated entity. The other two car parks (Prince of Wales
hospital car park and St George hospital car park) were funded by the International Parking
Group (Operator) which was contracted by the consolidated entity to build, manage and
operate both car parks for the duration of the arrangement. For all these car parks, the
consolidated entity has granted rights to the Operator to operate and generate revenue from
the car parks. Upon grant of this right, the Operator has paid an upfront license fee to the
consolidated entity.
The consolidated entity is obliged to provide the operators with access to the carparks and
obligated to pay for the construction of the RNSH P2 car park under the financing
arrangement with the Operator. The operators are responsible for operating the car parks
and at the end of the arrangement, return all assets back to the consolidated entity. There
are currently no provisions for extension of the term in the existing contract.

●
the consolidated entity accounts for the asset in accordance with other AAS, with the entity reclassifying the asset 
based on its nature or function;
Initial recognition
For arrangements within the scope of AASB 1059, the entity recognises a service concession asset when it controls the
asset. Where the asset is provided by the operator, or is an upgrade to or a major component replacement of an
existing asset of the entity, the asset is recognised at current replacement cost based on AASB 13 Fair Value
Measurement  principles.
Service concession assets (continued)
Where the asset is an existing asset of the entity, the asset is reclassified as a service concession asset and
remeasured at current replacement cost at the date of reclassification. Any difference between the previous carrying
amount and current replacement cost is recognised as if it is a revaluation of the asset.
Subsequent to initial recognition
Subsequent to the initial recognition or reclassification, the service concession asset is measured at current
replacement cost and accounted for in accordance with the depreciation and impairment requirements of AASB 116
Property, Plant and Equipment and  AASB 136 Impairment of Assets.
At the end of the arrangement
At the end of a service concession arrangement:
reference to fair value reverts from the mandated current replacement cost under AASB 1059 to the appropriate 
approach under AASB 13; and
the asset is only derecognised when the entity loses control of the asset in accordance with AASB 116.
Revaluations of property, plant and equipment
Physical non-current assets are valued in accordance with the TPP 14-01 Valuation of Physical Non-Current Assets at Fair
Value (TPP 14-01). This policy adopts fair value in accordance with AASB 13 Fair Value Measurement (AASB 13) and 
AASB 116 Property, Plant and Equipment (AASB 116). 
Property, plant and equipment is measured at the highest and best use by market participants that is physically possible,
legally permissible and financially feasible. The highest and best use must be available at a period that is not remote and
takes into account the characteristics of the asset being measured, including any socio-political restrictions imposed by
government. In most cases, after taking into account these considerations, the highest and best use is the existing use. In
limited circumstances, the highest and best use may be a feasible alternative use, where there are no restrictions on use or
where there is a feasible higher restricted alternative use.
Fair value of property, plant and equipment is based on a market participant's perspective, using valuation techniques
(market approach, cost approach, income approach) that maximise relevant observable inputs and minimise unobservable
inputs. Also refer to Note 29 for further information regarding fair value.
Recognition and Measurement (continued)

Notes to and forming part of the Financial Statements
for the year ended 30 June 2021
25. Property, plant and equipment (continued)
The last comprehensive revaluation for the parent entity was completed on 31 December 2018 and was based on an
independent assessment.
Comprehensive revaluations are conducted annually in December on a rolling basis and are based on an independent
assessment. A schedule of revaluations has been developed which rolls over every three years. Interim or out of schedule
revaluations are conducted where cumulative changes to indicators suggest fair value may differ materially from carrying
value. No interim or out of schedule revaluations were completed in the current year. The consolidated entity uses an
external professionally qualified valuer to conduct the interim revaluations.
Non-specialised assets with short useful lives are measured at depreciated historical cost, as an approximation of fair value.
The consolidated entity has assessed that any difference between fair value and depreciated historical cost is unlikely to be
material.
Revaluations are made with sufficient regularity to ensure the carrying amount of each asset in the class does not differ
materially from its fair value at reporting date. The consolidated entity conducts a comprehensive revaluation at least every
three years on a rotational basis for its land and buildings and infrastructure. Interim desktop revaluations are conducted
between comprehensive revaluations for those assets, where cumulative changes to indicators suggest fair value may differ
materially from carrying value. The consolidated entity uses an independent professionally qualified valuer for such
revaluations.
Recognition and Measurement (continued)
Revaluations of property, plant and equipment (continued)
The residual values, useful lives and methods of depreciation of property, plant and equipment are reviewed at each
financial year end and adjusted if appropriate.
For other assets valued using other valuation techniques, any balances of accumulated depreciation at the revaluation date
in respect of those assets are credited to the asset accounts to which they relate. The net asset accounts are then increased
or decreased by the revaluation increments or decrements.
Revaluation increments are recognised in other comprehensive income and credited to revaluation surplus in equity.
However, to the extent that an increment reverses a revaluation decrement in respect of the same class of asset previously
recognised as a loss in the net result, the increment is recognised immediately as a gain in the net result.
When revaluing non-current assets using the cost approach, the gross amount and the related accumulated depreciation are
separately restated. Where the income approach or market approach is used, accumulated depreciation is eliminated
against the gross carrying amount of the asset and the net amount restated to the revalued amount of the asset.
Where an asset that has previously been revalued is disposed of, any balance remaining in the revaluation surplus in
respect of that asset is transferred to accumulated funds.
As a not-for-profit entity, revaluation increments and decrements are offset against one another within a class of non-current
assets, but not otherwise.
Revaluation decrements are recognised immediately as a loss in the net result, except to the extent that it offsets an existing
revaluation surplus on the same class of assets, in which case, the decrement is debited directly to the revaluation surplus.

Ministry of Health
Notes to and forming part of the Financial Statements
for the year ended 30 June 2021
25. Property, plant and equipment (continued)
Property, plant and equipment is derecognised upon disposal or when no further future economic benefits are expected from
its use or disposal. Gains and losses on disposals are determined by comparing the proceeds with the carrying amount of
the asset and are included in the consolidated Statement of Comprehensive Income.
Recognition and Measurement (continued)
As a not-for-profit entity, an impairment loss is recognised in the net result to the extent the impairment loss exceeds the
amount in the revaluation surplus for the class of asset.
After an impairment loss has been recognised, it is reversed only if there has been a change in the assumptions used to
determine the asset’s recoverable amount. The reversal is limited so that the carrying amount of the asset does not exceed
its recoverable amount, nor exceed the carrying amount that would have been determined, net of depreciation, had no
impairment loss been recognised for the asset in prior years. Such reversal is recognised in net result and is treated as a
revaluation increase. However, to the extent that an impairment loss on the same class of asset was previously recognised
in net result, a reversal of that impairment loss is also recognised in net result.
Derecognition of property, plant and equipment
Impairment of property, plant and equipment
As a not-for-profit entity with no cash generating units, impairment under AASB 136 Impairment of Assets is unlikely to
arise. As property, plant and equipment is carried at fair value or an amount that approximates fair value, impairment can
only arise in the rare circumstances such as where the costs of disposal are material.  
The consolidated entity assesses, at each reporting date, whether there is an indication that an asset may be impaired. If
any indication exists, or when annual impairment testing for an asset is required, the consolidated entity estimates the
asset’s recoverable amount. When the carrying amount of an asset exceeds its recoverable amount, the asset is considered
impaired and is written down to its recoverable amount.
Specialised assets held for continuing use of their service capacity are rarely sold and their cost of disposal is typically
negligible. Their recoverable amount is expected to be materially the same as fair value, where they are regularly revalued
under AASB 13.

26. Leases
(a)
Entity as a lessee
The consolidated entity leases various property, equipment and motor vehicles. Lease contracts are typically made for fixed
periods of 1 to 10 years (parent entity: 1 to 30 years), but may have extension options. Lease terms are negotiated on an
individual basis and contain a wide range of different terms and conditions. The lease agreements do not impose any
covenants but leased assets may not be used as security for borrowing purposes. The consolidated entity does not provide
residual value guarantees in relation to leases.
Extension and termination options are included in a number of property and equipment leases. These terms are used to
maximise operational flexibility in terms of managing contracts. The majority of extension and termination options held are
exercisable only by the consolidated entity and not by the respective lessor. In determining the lease term, management
considers all facts and circumstances that create an economic incentive to exercise an extension option, or not exercise a
termination option. Extension options (or periods after termination options) are only included in the lease term if the lease is
reasonably certain to be extended (or not terminated). Potential future cash outflows of $297.85 million (2020: $304.6
million) (parent entity: $2.5 million, 2020: $12.3 million)) have not been included in the lease liability because it is not
reasonably certain that the leases will be extended (or not terminated). The assessment is reviewed if a significant event or
a significant change in circumstances occurs which affects this assessment and that is within the control of the lessee.
During the current financial year, the financial effect of revising lease terms to reflect the effect of exercising extensions and
termination options was an increase in recognised lease liabilities and right-of-use assets of $5.7 million (2020: $Nil) (parent
entity: $Nil, 2020: $Nil).
The consolidated entity has elected to recognise payments for short-term leases and low value leases as expenses on a
straight line basis, instead of recognising a right-of-use asset and lease liability. Short-term leases are leases with a lease
term of 12 months or less. Low value assets are assets with a fair value of $10,000 or less when new and comprise mainly
of small office and medical equipment items.
AASB 16 Leases (AASB 16) requires a lessee to recognise a right-of-use asset and a corresponding lease liability for most
leases.

The following amounts were recognised in the Statement of Comprehensive Income during the period in respect of leases
where the consolidated entity is the lessee:
The consolidated entity had total cash outflows for leases of $236.94 million for the year ending 30 June 2021 (2020:
$212.66 million).
Leases at significantly below market terms and conditions principally to enable the entity to further its objectives
The parent entity had total cash outflows for leases of $24.19 million for the year ending 30 June 2021 (2020: $8.83 million).
The following amounts were recognised in the Statement of Comprehensive Income during the period in respect of leases
where the parent entity is the lessee:
The consolidated entity entered into a number of leases, with lease terms ranging from 1 to 99 years with various
organisations, including local councils, health charities, Catholic churches and other NSW State entities for the use of
various community health buildings. There are also some leases for the use of various helipads across the state. These
contracts generally specify lease payments of $Nil or negligible amounts per annum, and the leased premises are used by
the consolidated entity to provide different community health services and access to helipads. These community health
buildings and helipads account for a small portion of similar assets used by the consolidated entity for the purposes of
providing health services. Therefore, these lease arrangements do not have a significant impact on the consolidated entity's
operations.

Recognition and measurement
The right-of-use assets are subsequently measured at cost. They are depreciated on a straight-line basis over the
shorter of the lease term and the estimated useful lives of the assets, as follows:
If ownership of the leased asset transfers to the consolidated entity at the end of the lease term or the cost reflects the
exercise of a purchase option, depreciation is calculated using the estimated useful life of the asset.
The right-of-use assets are also subject to impairment. The consolidated entity assesses, at each reporting date,
whether there is an indication that an asset may be impaired. If any indication exists, or when annual impairment
testing for an asset is required, the consolidated entity estimates the asset’s recoverable amount. When the carrying
amount of an asset exceeds its recoverable amount, the asset is considered impaired and is written down to its
recoverable amount. After an impairment loss has been recognised, it is reversed only if there has been a change in
the assumptions used to determine the asset’s recoverable amount. The reversal is limited so that the carrying amount
of the asset does not exceed its recoverable amount, nor exceed the carrying amount that would have been
determined, net of depreciation, had no impairment loss been recognised for the asset in prior years. Such reversal is
recognised in the net result.
The consolidated entity assesses at contract inception whether a contract is, or contains, a lease. That is, if the contract
conveys the right to control the use of an identified asset for a period of time in exchange for consideration.
Impairment losses for right-of-use assets
Impairment losses for right-of-use assets are included in 'Other gains / (losses)' in the Statement of Comprehensive
Income.
The consolidated entity recognises lease liabilities to make lease payments and right-of-use assets representing the right to
use the underlying assets, except for short-term leases and leases of low-value assets.
In 2020, an impairment loss in the consolidated entity of $2.9 million was recognised in relation to a lease that had
become onerous in nature. 
The market rent for some of the office accommodation property leases were negatively impacted by COVID-19,
indicating the carrying amount of such right-of-use assets exceeded their recoverable amounts. Impairment losses in
the consolidated entity of $99.20 million (2020: $Nil) and the parent entity of $92.53 million (2020: $Nil) were
recognised during the year to write down the carrying amount of affected leases to its recoverable amount.
Right-of-use assets
The consolidated entity recognises right-of-use assets at the commencement date of the lease (i.e. the date the
underlying asset is available for use). Right-of-use assets are initially measured at the amount of initial measurement
of the lease liability (refer ii below), adjusted by any lease payments made at or before the commencement date,
lease incentives, any initial direct costs incurred, and estimated costs of dismantling and removing the asset or
restoring the site.

Short-term leases and leases of low-value assets
The consolidated entity applies the short-term lease recognition exemption to its short-term leases of buildings,
machinery, motor vehicles and equipment (i.e., those leases that have a lease term of 12 months or less from the
commencement date and do not contain a purchase option). It also applies the lease of low-value assets recognition
exemption to leases of office equipment that are considered to be low value. Lease payments on short-term leases
and leases of low value assets are recognised as expense on a straight-line basis over the lease term.
The initial and subsequent measurement of right-of-use assets under leases at significantly below-market terms and
conditions that are entered into principally to enable the consolidated entity to further its objectives is the same as
normal right-of-use assets. They are measured at cost, subject to impairment.
Leases that have significantly below-market terms and conditions principally to enable the entity to further its
objectives
Variable lease payments that do not depend on an index or a rate are recognised as expenses (unless they are
incurred to produce inventories) in the period in which the event or condition that triggers the payment occurs.
Recognition and measurement (continued)
After the commencement date, the amount of lease liabilities is increased to reflect the accretion of interest and
reduced for the lease payments made. In addition, the carrying amount of lease liabilities is remeasured if there is a
modification, a change in the lease term, a change in the lease payments (e.g. changes to future payments resulting
from a change in an index or rate used to determine such lease payments) or a change in the assessment of an option
to purchase the underlying asset.
The consolidated entity's lease liabilities are included in borrowings in Note 33.
The lease payments are discounted using the interest rate implicit in the lease. If that rate cannot be readily
determined, which is generally the case for real estate leases, the incremental borrowing rate is used. The
consolidated entity does not borrow funds in the market. Instead it receives an allocation of the appropriations from the
Crown and where the Crown needs additional funding, Treasury Corporation (TCorp) goes to the market to obtain
these funds. As a result, the consolidated entity is using TCorp rates as its incremental borrowing rate. These rates are
published by NSW Treasury on a regular basis.
●payments of penalties for terminating the lease, if the lease term reflects the entity exercising the option to
terminate.
Lease liabilities
At the commencement date of the lease, the consolidated entity recognises lease liabilities measured at the present
value of lease payments to be made over the lease term. Lease payments include:
●  fixed payments (including in substance fixed payments) less any lease incentives receivable;
●  variable lease payments that depend on an index or a rate;
●  amounts expected to be paid under residual value guarantees;
●  exercise price of a purchase option reasonably certain to be exercised by the consolidated entity; and

The consolidated entity also leases land and buildings to non-government organisations (NGO’s) and universities under
operating leases arrangements. Generally there are no rental payments as the consolidated entity provides market rental
assistance grants which offset the rental payments.  
The consolidated entity leases some retail spaces located within the hospital precincts under operating leases with rental
payable monthly. Lease payments generally contain uplift clauses to align to the market conditions.
The consolidated entity has also leased levels 5 and 6 in the Bright Alliance Building at South Eastern Sydney Local Health
District's Randwick campus to the University of NSW for 40 years, which is treated as a finance lease. All lease payments
have been paid upfront and the asset has been derecognised from non-current assets.
Reconciliation of net investment in leases
The consolidated entity’s overall exposure to changes in the residual value at the end of the current lease is not material as
these leases form a very small part of the asset portfolio. Any expectations about the future residual values are reflected in
the fair value of these properties.
Future minimum rentals receivable (undiscounted) under non-cancellable finance leases as at 30 June are, as follows:

Future minimum rental receivables (undiscounted) under non-cancellable operating leases as at 30 June are as follows:
Finance income arising from finance leases is recognised over the lease term, based on a pattern reflecting a constant
periodic rate of return on the lessor’s net investment in the lease.
At the lease commencement date, the consolidated entity recognises a receivable for assets held under a finance lease in
its Statement of Financial Position at an amount equal to the net investment in the lease. The net investment in leases is
classified as financial assets at amortised cost and equals the lease payments receivable by a lessor and the unguaranteed
residual value, plus initial direct costs, discounted using the interest rate implicit in the lease.
Leases that the consolidated entity transfers substantially all the risks and rewards incidental to ownership of an asset are
classified as finance leases. Subleases are classified by reference to the right-of-use asset arising from the head lease,
rather than by reference to the underlying asset.
Ambulance Service of NSW has entered into a 10 year contract with Pel-Air Aviation Pty Ltd to provide aeromedical
services. The contract has a lease component for the right-to-use of the contracted aircrafts. The lease has not yet
commenced and as a result, no right-of-use asset or liability has been recognised at the reporting date.
On
commencement, approximately $111 million of right-of-use asset and lease liability is expected to be recognised by the
consolidated entity. 
An operating lease is a lease other than a finance lease. Rental income arising from operating leases is accounted for on a
straight-line basis over the lease terms and is included in other revenue in the Statement of Comprehensive Income due to
its operating nature. Initial direct costs incurred in negotiating and arranging an operating lease are added to the carrying
amount of the underlying asset and recognised over the lease term on the same basis as rental income. Contingent rents
are recognised as revenue in the period in which they are earned.

27. Intangible assets (continued)
Recognition and Measurement
Intangible assets are tested for impairment where an indicator of impairment exists. If the recoverable amount is less than
its carrying amount, the carrying amount is reduced to recoverable amount and the reduction is recognised as an
impairment loss.
The amortisation period and the amortisation method for an intangible asset with a finite useful life are reviewed at least at
the end of each reporting period. 
The useful lives of intangible assets are assessed to be finite. 
The consolidated entity recognises intangible assets only if it is probable that future economic benefits will flow to the
consolidated entity and the cost of the asset can be measured reliably. Intangible assets are measured initially at cost.
Where an asset is acquired at no or nominal cost, the cost is its fair value as at the date of acquisition. Following initial
recognition, intangible assets are subsequently measured at fair value only if there is an active market. If there is no active
market for the consolidated entity’s intangible assets, the assets are carried at cost less any accumulated amortisation and
impairment losses.
All research costs are expensed. Development costs are only capitalised when certain criteria are met.
The consolidated entity’s intangible assets are amortised using the straight-line method over a period of four years.
Computer software developed or acquired by the consolidated entity are recognised as intangible assets.
Intangible assets with indefinite useful lives are not amortised, but are tested for impairment annually. The assessment of
indefinite life is reviewed annually to determine whether the indefinite life continues to be supportable. If not, the change in
useful life from indefinite to finite is made on a prospective basis.

These assets are not depreciated while they are classified as held for sale. Interest and other expenses attributable to the
liabilities of a disposal group classified as held for sale are continued to be recognised.
The consolidated entity has certain non-current assets classified as held for sale, where their carrying amount will be
recovered principally through a sale transaction, not through continuing use. Non-current assets held for sale are recognised
at the lower of carrying amount and fair value less costs of disposal.

There were no transfers between Level 1 and 2 during the year ended 30 June 2021 and 2020.
(i) Leasehold improvements, work in progress and newly completed buildings are carried at cost, therefore excluded from figures
above and as a result the balances in Note 25 will not reconcile with balances disclosed above.
Fair value is the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between
market participants at the measurement date. The fair value measurement is based on the presumption that the transaction
to sell the asset or transfer the liability takes place either in the principal market for the asset or liability or in the absence of
a principal market, in the most advantageous market for the asset or liability. 
When measuring fair value, the valuation technique used maximises the use of relevant observable inputs and minimises
the use of unobservable inputs. Under AASB 13 Fair Value Measurement, the consolidated entity categorises, for
disclosure purposes, the valuation techniques based on the inputs used in the valuation techniques as follows: 
Level 1 – quoted (unadjusted) prices in active markets for identical assets / liabilities that the entity can access at the
measurement date.
Level 2 – inputs other than quoted prices included within Level 1 that are observable, either directly or indirectly.
Level 3 – inputs that are not based on observable market data (unobservable inputs).
The consolidated entity recognises transfers between levels of the fair value hierarchy at the end of the reporting period
during which the change has occurred.

(b)
Valuation techniques, inputs and processes
The property market is being impacted by the significant uncertainty that the COVID-19 outbreak has caused. Sales
evidence have been utilised to assess the land and non-specialised properties, in line with the valuation by the valuers
made on a market approach.
The consolidated entity obtains independent valuations for its non-financial assets at least every three years. The
valuer used by the consolidated entity is independent of the respective entities.
At the end of each reporting period, the consolidated entity updates its assessment of the fair value of each category
of non-financial assets, taking into account the most recent independent valuations. The best evidence of fair value is
current prices in an active market for similar assets. Where such information is not available, the consolidated entity
considers information from other sources, such as the indices provided by the Valuer General. These fair value
adjustments are reflected in Note 25 Total property, plant and equipment - reconciliation.
The valuations techniques used maximise the use of observable inputs where available and rely as little as possible on
entity or asset specific estimates. The level in the fair value hierarchy is determined on the basis of the lowest level
input that is significant to the measurement in its entirety. If significant inputs required to measure fair value of an asset
are observable, the asset is included in level 2 of the fair value hierarchy. If one or more of the significant inputs is not
based on observable market data, the asset is included in level 3 of the fair value hierarchy. All resulting fair value
estimates for non-financial assets are included in level 3 with the exception of some land and buildings and non-
current assets held for sale included in level 2. 
(i) Leasehold improvements, work in progress and newly completed buildings are carried at cost, therefore excluded from figures
above and as a result the balances in Note 25 will not reconcile with balances disclosed above.

Market approach
This valuation method involves comparing the subject property to
comparable sale prices in similar location on a rate per square metre basis,
adjusted for restrictions specific for the property (e.g. mandated use and/or
zoning).
Depreciated 
replacement cost 
approach
This valuation method involves establishing the current replacement cost of
the modern equivalent asset for each type of building on a rate per square
metre basis; depreciated to reflect the building's remaining useful life which is
determined by a number of factors including asset condition and asset life.

The non-financial assets categorised in (a) above have been measured based on the following valuation techniques
and inputs:
For land, the valuation by the valuers is made on a market approach, comparing similar assets (not identical)
and observable inputs. The most significant input is price per square metre. All commercial and non-restricted
land is included in level 2 as these land valuations have a high level of observable inputs, although these lands
are not identical. The majority of the restricted land has been classified as level 3 as, although observable inputs
have been used, a significant level of professional judgement is required to adjust inputs in determining the land
valuations. Certain parcels of land have zoning restrictions, for example hospital grounds, and values are
adjusted accordingly. 
For buildings and infrastructure systems, many assets are of a specialised nature or use, and thus the most
appropriate valuation method is depreciated replacement cost. These assets are included as level 3 as these
assets have a high level of unobservable inputs. However, residential and commercial properties are valued on
a market approach and are included in level 2.
Non-current assets held for sale are a non-recurring item that is measured at the lesser of its carrying amount
or fair value less cost to sell. These assets are categorised as level 2 except when an asset was a level 3 asset
prior to transfer to non-current assets held for sale, and continues to be recognised as a level 3 asset where the
carrying amount is less than the fair value (less cost) to sell. 
The fair value of buildings computed by suitably qualified independent valuers using a methodology known as the
depreciated replacement cost valuation technique. The following table highlights the key unobservable (level 3) inputs
assessed during the valuation process, the relationship to the estimated fair value and the sensitivity to changes in
unobservable inputs.

Payables are financial liabilities at amortised cost, initially measured at fair value, net of directly attributable transaction
costs. These are subsequently measured at amortised cost using the effective interest method. Gains and losses are
recognised in the net result when the liabilities are derecognised as well as through the amortisation process.
Recognition and Measurement
Payables represent liabilities for goods and services provided to the consolidated entity and other amounts. Short-term
payables with no stated interest rate are measured at the original invoice amount where the effect of discounting is
immaterial. 
Details regarding liquidity risk, including a maturity analysis of the above payables are disclosed in Note 44.

1 Current contract liabilities  has been restated to be $27.04 million lower in the prior year for the consolidated and parent entity. Refer to 
Note 17 for further details.
Contract liabilities are in respect of consideration received in advance from the sale of goods and services from contracts
with customers and grants and other contributions.
The contract liability has significantly decreased during the year because the specific performance obligations within the
contracts were satisfied.
Apart from the impacts of the National Partnership Agreement on COVID-19 Response, there has been no other significant
movements in the contract liability balance. The remaining balance relates to a number of smaller grants and other
contributions and sales of goods and services from contracts with customers that are still to satisfy the specific performance
obligations within the contracts. Revenue from contract liabilities will be recognised when the specific performance
obligations have been met.
The balance of contract liabilities at 30 June 2021 has reduced significantly as a large portion of the 2020 contract liability
balance related to funding received from the Commonwealth under the National Partnership Agreement on COVID-19
Response. Most of the funding was received in the last quarter of 2020 in response to the COVID-19 pandemic. All unused
funding from 2019-20 has now either been used in the current year or has been refunded to the Commonwealth. The
contract liability in the current year under the same agreement is significantly lower as the funding provided by the
Commonwealth is closely aligned to the activity and the specific performance obligations within the agreement.

No assets have been pledged as security / collateral for liabilities and there are no restrictions on any title to property.
The Public, Private Partnerships (PPP) relate to the provision of service-enabling infrastructure that includes private sector
delivering a combination of design, construction, financing, maintenance, operations and delivery of clinical and non-clinical
services. Payments are made by the consolidated entity to the private sector entities on the basis of delivery of assets or
service delivery. The liability to pay private sector entities is based on financing arrangements involving Consumer Price
Index (CPI)-linked finance and fixed finance.

Recognition and Measurement
Financial liabilities at amortised cost
Financial liabilities at fair value through profit or loss
Financial guarantees
Borrowings represents interest bearing liabilities mainly through NSW Treasury Corporation, lease liabilities, service
concessions arrangement liabilities and other bearing interest bearing liabilities.
Borrowings classified as financial liabilities at amortised cost are initially measured at fair value, net of directly attributable
transaction costs. These are subsequently measured at amortised cost using the effective interest method. Gains and losses
are recognised in the net result when the liabilities are derecognised as well as through the amortisation process. 
Financial guarantee contracts are recognised as a financial liability at the time the guarantee is issued. The liability is initially
measured at fair value, being the premium received. Subsequent to initial recognition, the consolidated entity’s liability under
each guarantee is measured at the higher of the amount initially recognised less cumulative amortisation, and an expected
credit loss provision.
The consolidated entity has reviewed its financial guarantees and determined that there is no material liability to be
recognised for financial guarantee contracts as at 30 June 2021 and as at 30 June 2020. However, refer to Note 39
regarding disclosures on contingent liabilities.
A financial guarantee contract is a contract that requires the issuer to make specified payments to reimburse the holder for a
loss it incurs because a specified debtor fails to make payment when due in accordance with the original or modified terms
of a debt instrument.  
The consolidated entity has not designated any financial liability as at fair value through profit or loss.

The remaining balance consists of site remediation costs with the majority of the payments not expected to be made until
2023.
Movements in provisions (other than employee benefits)
The majority of the 'other' provision represent various contractual related obligations. The consolidated entity has
recognised the provision amount by taking into consideration all available information at the reporting date and making best
management estimation of the obligation. The timing of the payments will vary for each contractual related obligations.
Movements in each class of provision during the financial year, other than employee benefits, are set out below:
The majority of 'restoration costs' represent the expected cost to restore a leased asset at the end of the lease term. Lease
end dates vary across the consolidated entity's lease portfolio and therefore the timing of the payments to restore the
leased asset at the end of the term will vary. The majority of the 'restoration cost' provision is as per the lease contracts.

34. Provisions (continued)
Recognition and Measurement 
Employee benefits and related on-costs
The majority of employee benefits and related on-cost balances have increased since the start of the COVID-19 pandemic.
Management of the COVID-19 pandemic along with state and international border closures have adversely impacted the
provision.
The consolidated entity's liability for long service leave and defined benefit superannuation are assumed by The Crown in
right of the State of New South Wales. The consolidated entity accounts for the liability as having been extinguished
resulting in the amount assumed being shown as part of the non-monetary revenue item described as 'Acceptance by the
Crown of employee benefits and other liabilities'.
Actuarial advice obtained by NSW Treasury, an entity controlled by the ultimate parent, has confirmed that using the
nominal annual leave balance plus the annual leave entitlements accrued while taking annual leave (calculated using 8.4%
to 14.03% of nominal value of annual leave) can be used to approximate the present value of the annual leave liability. The
consolidated entity has assessed the actuarial advice based on the consolidated entity’s circumstances to annual leave and
ADOs and has determined that the effect of discounting is immaterial. All annual leave is classified as a current liability
even where the consolidated entity does not expect to settle the liability within 12 months as the consolidated entity does
not have an unconditional right to defer settlement.
Unused non-vesting sick leave does not give rise to a liability as it is not considered probable that sick leave taken in the
future will be greater than the benefits accrued in the future.
Long service leave and superannuation
Salaries and wages, annual leave, sick leave, allocated days off (ADOs) and on-costs
Salaries and wages (including non-monetary benefits) and paid sick leave that are expected to be settled wholly within 12
months after the end of the period in which the employees render the service are recognised and measured at the
undiscounted amounts of the benefits. 
Annual leave and ADOs are not expected to be settled wholly before twelve months after the end of the annual reporting
period in which the employees render the related service. As such, it is required to be measured at present value in
accordance with AASB 119 Employee Benefits  (although short-cut methods are permitted).
Specific on-costs relating to long service leave assumed by The Crown in right of the State of New South Wales are borne
by the consolidated entity.
Long service leave is measured at the present value of expected future payments to be made in respect of services
provided up to the reporting date. Consideration is given to certain factors based on an actuarial review, including expected
future wage and salary levels, experience of employee departures, and periods of service. Expected future payments are
discounted using the long-term Commonwealth Government bond rate at the reporting date.
The superannuation expense for the financial year is determined by using the formula specified in the NSW Treasury’s, an
entity controlled by the ultimate parent entity, Directions. The expense for certain superannuation schemes (i.e. Basic
Benefit and Aware Super) is calculated as a percentage of the employees' salary. For other superannuation schemes (i.e.
State Superannuation Scheme and State Authorities Superannuation Scheme), the expense is calculated as a multiple of
the employees' superannuation contributions.

Notes to and forming part of the Financial Statements

34. Provisions (continued)
Recognition and Measurement (continued)
If the effect of the time value of money is material, provisions are discounted at a pre-tax rate that reflects the current
market assessments of the time value of money and the risks specific to the liability. When discounting is used, the
increase in the provision due to the passage of time (i.e. unwinding of discount rate) is recognised as a finance cost.
Any provisions for restructuring are recognised only when the consolidated entity has a detailed formal plan, and the entity
has raised a valid expectation in those affected by the restructuring that it will carry out the restructuring by starting to
implement the plan or announcing its main features to those affected.
Other provisions are recognised when the consolidated entity has a present legal or constructive obligation as a result of a
past event; it is probable that an outflow of resources will be required to settle the obligation; and a reliable estimate can be
made of the amount of the obligation. When the consolidated entity expects some or all of a provision to be reimbursed, for
example, under an insurance contract, the reimbursement is recognised as a separate asset, but only when the
reimbursement is virtually certain. The expense relating to a provision is presented net of any reimbursement in the
consolidated Statement of Comprehensive Income.
Consequential on-costs
Consequential costs to employment are recognised as liabilities and expenses where the employee benefits to which they
relate have been recognised. This includes outstanding amounts of payroll tax, workers’ compensation insurance premiums
and fringe benefits tax.
Other provisions

The category 'accumulated funds' includes all current and prior period retained funds.
The revaluation surplus is used to record increments and decrements on the revaluation of non-current assets. This accords
with the consolidated entity's policy on the revaluation of property, plant and equipment as discussed in Note 25.
Transfer of property, plant and equipment
Separate reserve accounts are recognised in the financial statements only if such accounts are required by specific
legislation or Australian Accounting Standards (e.g. revaluation surplus and foreign currency translation reserve).
In 2020-21, the NSW Governor made the Callan Park (Special Provisions) (Vesting of Land) Proclamation 2020 to transfer
Callan Park ’precinct 1’, to the Centennial Park and Moore Park Trust, an entity controlled by the ultimate parent. The transfer
was completed on the 16 December 2020 and was treated as an equity transfer. The carrying amount of the assets prior to
the transfer was $95.9 million, the fair value at transfer date was $101.1 million.
In 2019-20, the former Manly Hospital site, Darley Road Manly, was transferred at $1 to Property NSW (PNSW), an entity
controlled by the ultimate parent. The transfer was completed on 1 March 2020 and was treated as an equity transfer. The
carrying amount of the asset prior to the transfer was $54.1 million, the fair value at transfer date was $23.3 million.
PARENT

Input tax receivable related to capital commitments for expenditure
Output tax payable related to commitments for revenue
Aggregate capital expenditure for the acquisition of land and buildings, plant and equipment, infrastructure and 
intangible assets, contracted for at balance date and not provided for:
The total of capital 'commitments' payable, i.e. $1,346 million as at 30 June 2021, includes input tax credits of $122.4 
million that are expected to be recoverable from the Australian Taxation Office (2020: $201.2 million).
The total of 'commitments' receivable, i.e. $194 million as at 30 June 2021, includes input tax of $17.6 million that is 
expected to be payable to the Australian Taxation Office (2020: $12.30 million).
All other equity transfers are recognised at fair value, except for intangibles. Where an intangible has been recognised at
(amortised) cost by the transferor because there is no active market, the consolidated entity recognises the asset at the
transferor's carrying amount. Where the transferor is prohibited from recognising internally generated intangibles, the
consolidated entity does not recognise that asset.
Recognition and Measurement
The transfer of net assets between entities as a result of an administrative restructure, transfers of programs / functions and
parts thereof between entities controlled by the ultimate parent is designated or required by Accounting Standards to be
treated as contributions by owners and is recognised as an adjustment to 'accumulated funds'. This treatment is consistent
with AASB 1004 and Australian Accounting Interpretation 1038 Contributions by Owners Made to Wholly-Owned Public
Sector Entities.
Transfers arising from an administrative restructure involving not-for-profit and for-profit government entities are recognised at
the amount at which the assets and liabilities were recognised by the transferor immediately prior to the restructure. Subject
to below, in most instances this will approximate fair value.

The parent entity did not administer any trust funds on behalf of others in 2020.
The consolidated entity holds money in trust in relation to patient trusts, refundable deposits, private patient trust funds and
third party funds. As the consolidated entity performs only a custodial role in respect of trust monies, they are excluded
from the financial statements as the consolidated entity cannot use them for the achievement of its own objectives. The
following is a summary of the transactions in the trust account. 
The parent entity holds money in a trust in relation to Nationally Funded Centres (NFC) and Health Chief Executives Forum
(HCEF) formerly known as Australian Health Ministers' Advisory Council (AHMAC). As the parent entity performs only a
custodial role in respect of trust monies, they are excluded from the financial statements as the parent entity cannot use
them for the achievement of its own objectives. The following is a summary of the transactions in the trust account.

Set out below are the associates of Hunter New England Local Health District (HNELHD) as at 30 June 2021 which, in the opinion of management at HNELHD, are material to the group. The 
proportion of ownership interest held by the group equals the voting rights held by the group.
A claim has been lodged against the consolidated entity for unspecified compensation in respect of alleged underpayment of employee award entitlements. The consolidated entity is
defending the action. It is not practical to estimate the potential effect of these claims at the present time.
The consolidated entity is not aware of any contingent assets which would have a material effect on the disclosures in these financial statements.
Hunter Medical Research Institute is a company limited by guarantee, whose constitution prohibits the distribution of funds to its members. Accordingly the carrying amount has been equity

The timing of new capital projects and intangible assets coming into service resulted in increased
depreciation and amortisation.
The budgeted amounts are drawn from the original budgeted financial statements presented to Parliament in respect of the
reporting period. Subsequent amendments to the original budget (e.g. adjustment for transfer of functions between entities
as a result of Administrative Arrangements Orders) are not reflected in the budgeted amounts. Major variances between the
original budgeted amounts and the actual amounts disclosed in the financial statements are explained below.
Capital expensing of capital works projects was higher than anticipated as a result of multiple projects
requiring final fit outs of furniture, fixture and equipment as they neared completion.
NET RESULT
The actual net result ($305.8 million) is lower than the budgeted net result ($1,554 million) by $1,248 million for the year
ended 30 June 2021. 
A reconciliation of the movements between the actual and budgeted net result is presented below: 
Net result - actual 
The consolidated entity recognised an insurance expense performance adjustment based on past claim
performance resulting in an additional expense to the annual premium.
Actuarial assessment impact of long service leave on annual leave on-costs resulted in additional
employee related expenses of $98.3 million, not assumed by the Crown.
NSW Treasury's Triennial actuarial review resulted in changes to the calculation of consequential factors
associated with employee entitlements. The impact of this was an additional $64.8 million of expenses, not
assumed by the Crown, recognised in employee related expenses.
The consolidated entity had a write-off for $217 million of personal protective equipment inventories that
expired and made allowances for impairment of $558.7 million of personal protective equipment as the
consumption model indicates the equipment is unlikely to be used before it expires.
The market rent for some office accommodation leases were negatively impacted by COVID-19, indicating
the carrying amount of such right-of-use assets exceeded their recoverable amounts.
Grants and subsidies to Affiliated Health Organisations and entities controlled by the ultimate parent were
higher than expected due to payments for continued COVID-19 support and personal protective equipment
being granted free of charge.
Other minor variations.

ASSETS AND LIABILITIES

June 2021. 
A reconciliation of the movements between significant assets and liabilities is presented below: 
Net assets - actual
The annual leave provision significantly increased during the year as a result of staffing needs to manage
the COVID-19 pandemic along with state and international border closures.
The consolidated entity had a write-off for $217 million of personal protective equipment inventories that
expired and made allowances for impairment of $558.7 million of personal protective equipment as the
consumption model indicates the equipment is unlikely to be used before it expires.
Lower than anticipated non-current asset revaluations of property, plant and equipment and an equity
transfer of Callan Park ’precinct 1’, to the Centennial Park and Moore Park Trust, an entity controlled by the
ultimate parent, resulted in a lower property, plant and equipment balance.
The market rent for some office accommodation leases were negatively impacted by COVID-19, indicating
the carrying amount of such right-of-use assets exceeded their recoverable amounts.
NSW Treasury's Triennial actuarial review resulted in changes to the calculation of consequential factors
associated with employee entitlements. The impact of this was an additional $64.8 million of provisions.
Net movement across several asset and liability classes due to other minor variations.
Net assets - budget
CASH FLOWS
The actual net cash flows from operating activities was lower than the budget by $889 million. This is primarily due to in-
year payments being lower than the budgeted year end position for all payments except for payment for grants and
subsidies. Similar to payments, receipts are lower than the budgeted year end position.
The net cash flows from financing activities were higher than expected by $2 million. This is attributable to higher
repayments of principal portion of lease liabilities and service concession financial liability and lower repayments of
borrowings and advances than budgeted. 
The net cash flows from investing activities were lower than expected by $301 million. This is attributable to a decrease in
proceeds and purchases of property, plant and equipment and intangibles and proceeds and purchases of financial assets.
These decreases were slightly offset by an increase in other investing activities.

The consolidated entity's principal financial instruments are outlined below. These financial instruments arise directly from the
consolidated entity's operations or are required to finance its operations. The consolidated entity does not enter into or trade
financial instruments, including derivative financial instruments, for speculative purposes.
The consolidated entity's main risks arising from financial instruments are outlined below, together with the consolidated
entity's objectives, policies and processes for measuring and managing risk. Further quantitative and qualitative disclosures are
included throughout these financial statements.
The Secretary of NSW Health has overall responsibility for the establishment and oversight of risk management and reviews
and agrees policies for managing each of these risks. Risk management policies are established to identify and analyse the
risks faced by the consolidated and parent entities, to set risk limits and controls and to monitor risks. Compliance with policies
is reviewed on a continuous basis.

Disclosures for the purpose of the credit risk disclosures.
A financial asset (or, where applicable, a part of a financial asset or part of a group of similar financial assets) is
derecognised when the contractual rights to the cash flows from the financial assets expire; or if the entity transfers its
rights to receive cash flows from the asset or has assumed an obligation to pay the received cash flows in full without
material delay to a third party under a pass through arrangement and either:
When the consolidated entity has transferred its rights to receive cash flows from an asset or has entered into a pass
through arrangement, it evaluates if, and to what extent, it has retained the risks and rewards of ownership. Where the
consolidated entity has neither transferred nor retained substantially all the risks and rewards or transferred control, the
asset continues to be recognised to the extent of the consolidated entity continuing involvement in the asset. In that case,
the consolidated entity also recognises an associated liability. The transferred asset and the associated liability are
measured on a basis that reflects the rights and obligations that the entity has retained.
A financial liability is derecognised when the obligation specified in the contract is discharged or cancelled or expires.
When an existing financial liability is replaced by another from the same lender on substantially different terms, or the
terms of an existing liability are substantially modified, such an exchange or modification is treated as the derecognition of
the original liability and the recognition of a new liability. The difference in the respective carrying amounts is recognised in
the net result.
●  the consolidated entity has transferred substantially all the risks and rewards of the asset; or
●the consolidated entity has neither transferred nor retained substantially all the risks and rewards for the asset, but has
transferred control.
Amortised cost
The consolidated entity determines the classification of its financial assets and liabilities after initial recognition and, when
allowed and appropriate, re-evaluates this at each financial year end.

Financial risks

Cash and cash equivalents
Trade receivables, other receivables, contract assets and lease receivables are written off when there is no reasonable
expectation of recovery. Indicators that there is no reasonable expectation of recovery include, amongst others a failure to
make contractual payments for a period of greater than 90 days past due.
The expected loss rates are based on historical observed loss rates. The historical loss rates are adjusted to reflect
current and forward-looking information on macroeconomic factors affecting the ability of the customers to settle the
receivables. The consolidated entity has not identified any relevant factors, and accordingly has not adjusted the historical
loss rates.
To measure the expected credit losses, trade receivables, other receivables, contract assets and lease receivables have
been grouped based on shared credit risk characteristics and the days past due.
Accounting policy for impairment of trade receivables and other financial assets
Receivables - trade receivables, other receivables, contract assets and lease receivables
The consolidated entity applies the AASB 9 simplified approach to measuring expected credit losses which uses a lifetime
expected loss allowance for all trade receivables, other receivables, contract assets and lease receivables.
Collectability of trade receivables, other receivables, contract assets and lease receivables is reviewed on an ongoing
basis. Procedures as established in the Treasurer’s Directions are followed to recover outstanding amounts, including
letters of demand.
Cash comprises cash on hand and bank balances within the NSW Treasury Banking System. Interest is earned on daily
bank balances at the monthly average NSW Treasury Corporation (TCorp) 11am unofficial cash rate, adjusted for a
management fee to NSW Treasury. The TCorp IM Funds cash facility is discussed in market risk below. 
Credit risk arises when there is the possibility that the counterparty will default on their contractual obligations, resulting in
a financial loss to the consolidated entity. The maximum exposure to credit risk is generally represented by the carrying
amount of the financial assets (net of any allowance for credit losses or allowance for impairment).
The consolidated entity considers a financial asset in default when contractual payments are 90 days past due. However,
in certain cases, the consolidated entity may also consider a financial asset to be in default when internal or external
information indicates that the entity is unlikely to receive the outstanding contractual amounts in full before taking into
account any credit enhancements held by the consolidated entity.
Financial assets and financial liabilities are offset and the net amount is reported in the Statement of Financial Position if
there is a currently enforceable legal right to offset the recognised amounts and there is an intention to settle on a net
basis, or to realise the assets and settle the liabilities simultaneously.
Credit risk arises from financial assets of the consolidated entity, including cash, receivables and authority deposits. No
collateral is held by the consolidated entity. The consolidated entity has not granted any financial guarantees.
Credit risk associated with the consolidated entity's financial assets, other than receivables, is managed through the
selection of counterparties and establishment of minimum credit rating standards. Authority deposits held with NSW TCorp
are guaranteed by the State.

Notes
The loss allowance for trade receivables, other receivables, contract assets and lease receivables as at 30 June 2021
and 2020 was determined as follows:
The consolidated entity is not materially exposed to concentrations of credit risk to a single trade debtor or group of
debtors as at 30 June 2021.

30 June 2020
30 June 2021

¹ The analysis excludes statutory receivables and prepayments as these are not within the scope of AASB 7 Financial Instruments:
Disclosures. Therefore the 'total' will note reconcile to the receivables total in Note 20 and the contract assets total in Note 21.
2  The estimated total gross carrying amount for the parent entity also excludes receivables from controlled health entities.
3  Estimated total gross carrying amount has been restated higher by $72.4 million. Refer to Note 1(h) for further details.

(d)
Financial risks (continued)
i. Credit risk  (continued)
ii. Liquidity risk
Liquidity risk is the risk that the consolidated entity will be unable to meet its payment obligations when they fall due. The
consolidated entity continuously manages risk through monitoring future cash flows and maturities planning to ensure
adequate holding of high quality liquid assets. The objective is to maintain a balance between continuity of funding and
flexibility through effective management of cash, investments and liquid assets and liabilities.
The consolidated entity has negotiated no loan outside of arrangements with the Crown. During the current and prior year,
there were no defaults of loans payable. No assets have been pledged as collateral.
Liquidity risk is minimised by the use of service agreements between the Secretary of NSW Health and controlled health
entities. The annual service agreements, requires controlled entities to manage their financial liquidity and in particular,
meet benchmarks for the payment of creditors. Where the controlled entities fail to meet service agreement performance
standards, the parent as the state manager can take action in accordance with annual performance framework
requirements, including providing financial support and increased management interaction.
For small business suppliers, where payment is not made within the specified time period, simple interest must be paid
automatically unless an existing contract specifies otherwise. 
For other suppliers, where settlement cannot be effected in accordance with the above, e.g. due to short term liquidity
constraints, contact is made with creditors and terms of payment are negotiated to the satisfaction of both parties.
Liabilities are recognised for amounts due to be paid in the future for goods or services received, whether or not invoiced.
For a supplier, that has a correctly rendered invoice, a matched purchase order and where goods have been received, an
immediate payment is made irrespective of current contract payment terms.
Other financial assets - Authority Deposits
The consolidated entity has placed funds on deposit with TCorp, which has been rated 'AA+' by Standard and Poor’s.
These deposits are similar to money market or bank deposits and can be placed 'at call' or for a fixed term. These
deposits are considered to be low credit risk, and the loss allowance recognised during the period was therefore limited to
12 months expected losses. The consolidated entity did not recognise a provision for expected credit losses on its other
financial assets in 2021 (2020: $Nil).

Market risk is the risk that the fair value of future cash flows of a financial instrument will fluctuate because of changes in
market prices. The consolidated entity's exposures to market risk are primarily through interest rate risk on the
consolidated entity's borrowings, foreign currency risk and other price risks associated with the movement in the unit price
of the Hour Glass Investment Facilities. The consolidated entity does not enter into commodity contracts.
The effect on net result and equity due to a reasonably possible change in risk variable is outlined in the information below
for interest rate risk, foreign currency risk and other price risk. A reasonably possible change in risk variable has been
determined after taking into account the economic environment in which the consolidated entity operates and the time
frame for the assessment (i.e. until the end of the next annual reporting period). The sensitivity analysis is based on risk
exposures in existence at the Statement of Financial Position reporting date. The analysis was performed on the same
basis for 2020. The analysis assumes that all other variables remain constant.
The following table demonstrates the sensitivity to a reasonably possible change in interest rates:
A reasonably possible change of +/-1% is used consistent with current trends in interest rates (based on official RBA
interest rate volatility over the last five years). The basis will be reviewed annually and amended where there is a
structural change in the level of interest rate volatility.
Both NSW Treasury and Ministry of Health loans are set at fixed rates and therefore are generally not affected by
fluctuations in market rates. The consolidated entity does not account for any fixed rate financial instruments at fair value
through profit or loss or at fair value through other comprehensive income. Therefore, for these financial instruments, a
change of interest rates would not affect the carrying value or interest paid/earned.
Interest rate risk is the risk that the fair value or future cash flows of a financial instrument will fluctuate because of
changes in market interest rates. Exposure to interest rate risk arises primarily through the consolidated entity's interest
bearing liabilities.
However, controlled entities are not permitted to borrow external to the Ministry of Health (energy loans which are
negotiated through NSW Treasury are excepted).

The consolidated entity manages its foreign exchange risk by maintaining United States (US) dollar denominated bank
accounts or buying US currencies from TCorp at the time of purchase commitment in accordance with the consolidated
entity's risk management policies.
At year end, the consolidated entity did not hold any foreign currency denominated monetary assets and monetary
liabilities, except for cash held in a US dollar denominated bank account. All funds held at year end in foreign currency are
expected to be used to settle existing purchase commitments that are denominated in US currency. As a result, the
consolidated entity is not exposed to foreign exchange rates fluctuations.
A sensitivity analysis has been disclosed, should the cash and currency held in US dollars not be used for future payment
of US denominated inventory purchases and instead used to purchase Australian Dollars. A sensitivity of 10% movement
in the exchange rates has been selected for use in the sensitivity analysis at the reporting date, as this is considered
reasonable, based on the current Australian dollar level and the historical volatility of the Australian dollar against the US
currency. Based on the value of the Australian dollar at the reporting date as compared with the currencies below, adverse
or favourable movements in the foreign exchange rates would result in an increase or decrease in the Australian dollar fair
value respectively.
Exposure to foreign exchange risk arises primarily through the contractual commercial transactions denominated in a
foreign currency. The risk is measured using sensitivity analysis and cash flow forecasting.

Exposure to 'other price risk' primarily arises through the investment in the TCorpIM Funds, which are held for strategic
rather than trading purposes. The consolidated entity has no direct equity investments. The consolidated entity holds units
in the following TCorpIM Funds trusts:
TCorp provides sensitivity analysis information for each of the Investment facilities, which is used to demonstrate the
impact on the funds' net assets as a result of a change in the unit price. This impact is based on a sensitivity rate of 10%,
multiplied by the redemption value as at 30 June each year for each facility (balance from TCorpIM Funds statement).
Actual movements in the price risk variables may differ to the sensitivity rate used due to a number of factors. The
TCorpIM Funds are measured at fair value through profit or loss and therefore any change in unit price impacts directly on
net results / equity.
Investment in the TCorpIM Funds facilities limits the consolidated entity's exposure to risk, as it allows diversification
across a pool of funds with different investment horizons and a mix of investments.
The unit price of each facility is equal to the total fair value of net assets held by the facility divided by the total number of
units on issue for that facility. Unit prices are calculated and published daily. TCorp as trustee for each of the above
facilities is required to act in the best interest of the unit holders and to administer the trusts in accordance with the trust
deeds. As trustee, TCorp has appointed external managers to manage the performance and risk of each facility in
accordance with a mandate agreed by the parties. A significant portion of the administration of the facilities is outsourced
to an external custodian.

Fair value is the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction
between market participants at the measurement date. The fair value measurement is based on the presumption that the
transaction to sell the asset or transfer the liability takes place either in the principal market for the asset or liability or in
the absence of a principal market, in the most advantageous market for the asset or liability.
The consolidated entity recognises transfers between levels of the fair value hierarchy at the end of the reporting period
during which the change has occurred.
The value of the TCorpIM Funds Investments is based on the consolidated entity's share of the value of the underlying
assets of the facility, based on the market value. All of the TCorpIM Funds Investment facilities are valued using
'redemption' pricing.
There were no transfers between Level 1 and 2 during the year ended 30 June 2021 (2020: $Nil).
TCorpIM Funds Investment Facilities are measured at fair value. Management assessed that cash and short-term
deposits, trade receivables, trade payables and other current liabilities approximate their fair values, largely due to the
short-term maturities of these instruments.
The table above only includes financial assets as no financial liabilities were measured at fair value in the Statement of Financial
Position.
When measuring fair value, the valuation technique used maximises the use of relevant observable inputs and minimises
the use of unobservable inputs. Under AASB 13, the consolidated entity categorises, for disclosure purposes, the
valuation techniques based on the inputs used in the valuation techniques as follows:
●
Level 1 – quoted (unadjusted) prices in active markets for identical assets / liabilities that the entity can access at the
measurement date.
●    Level 2 – inputs other than quoted prices included within Level 1 that are observable, either directly or indirectly.
●    Level 3 – inputs that are not based on observable market data (unobservable inputs).

Restrictions) Order 2021 under the Public Health Act 2010 to contain the spread of COVID-19 and to prioritise the health and
safety of the community. The Public Health Order 2021 placed various restrictions on Greater Sydney and at a later stage
regional NSW and therefore has impacted the way the consolidated entity has operated since reporting date. Elective surgery
was cancelled in public hospitals as they prepared for surges in COVID-19 presentations. Management recognises that it is
difficult to reliably estimate with any degree of certainty the potential impact of COVID-19 on the consolidated entity after
reporting date.

Key achievements 
•	In continuing to respond to the challenges of the COVID-19 
pandemic, the State Health Emergency Operations 
Centre (SHEOC) led the NSW Health operational response 
to the COVID-19 pandemic including planning with local 
health districts and specialty health networks to increase 
intensive care unit (ICU) capacity to meet the predicted 
COVID-19 surge, sourcing and distributing medical 
equipment such as ventilators, supporting the operation 
of COVID-19 testing clinics, the NSW Hotel Quarantine 
and Airport program in collaboration with other NSW 
Government agencies and establishing a large network 
of over 100 vaccination clinics, including mobile outreach 
locations, across the state, and the state’s first mass 
vaccination centre at Sydney Olympic Park. Meanwhile, 
the Public Health Emergency Operations Centre 
(PHEOC) led the public health aspects of the response 
to COVID-19. PHEOC worked in conjunction with Public 
Health Units in local health districts and NSW Health 
Pathology, primarily being involved in contract tracing, 
providing expert advice, issuing public health orders 
and epidemiology research.
•	Collaborated with Sydney Water to implement our 
award-winning sewage surveillance program at more 
than 60 sewage treatment plants across NSW to support 
our COVID-19 response, providing an additional level 
of surveillance at a population level with the world-first 
research program having achieved global significance.
•	Rolled out the COVID-19 vaccination program across 
NSW, establishing a mass vaccination centre at Sydney 
Olympic Park and planning for the second mass hub in 
Newcastle. As at 29 June 2021, our health workers had 
administered 851,400 doses of the AstraZeneca and 
Pfizer vaccines.
•	Invested more than $28 million in initiatives to generate 
research evidence to support the response to the 
COVID-19 pandemic, which included launching the 
competitive and merit-based COVID-19 Research Grants 
Program with $8 million awarded to 17 research projects.
•	Invested more than $4.5 million over three years 
to support experts in studying the clinical and 
immunological responses to the COVID-19 vaccines 
in NSW recipients to inform the state’s vaccine 
policy into the future.
•	Responded to over 18,000 calls a month to the Mental 
Health Line as an additional $16.4 million was invested to 
enhance the service as part of the state’s COVID-19 response.
•	Worked collaboratively as part of the statewide emergency 
response to the extreme rainfall and flooding in March 
2021, ensuring isolated communities or those at risk of 
flooding were safe and able to access health services. 
Part of this work included the deployment of a specialist 
Medical Assistance Team to North Richmond for five 
days to provide emergency care and deliver healthcare 
services to support evacuation centres on the Mid North 
Coast, Upper Hunter and Castle Hill. The coordinated 
response also spanned the clean-up and recovery.
•	Launched the NSW HIV Strategy 2021-2025 to continue 
to build on the success of its predecessor, which saw a 
substantial improvement in HIV prevention, testing and 
treatment in NSW. In continuing the momentum, the 
2021-25 strategy aims to achieve the virtual elimination 
of HIV transmission in NSW by addressing the barriers 
to testing and treatment created by stigma and 
discrimination; adapt, pilot and implement new 
technologies; and focus additional efforts on priority 
populations who have not experienced the same level 
of recent success.
•	Launched the First 2000 Days Implementation Strategy 
2020-2025 to support local health districts, specialty 
networks and other policy, program and service delivery 
areas within the health system to implement the First 
2000 Days Framework at a local level. Successful 
implementation of the strategy will improve health and 
development outcomes for all children, giving them the 
start that they need to thrive now and in the future. 
•	To support care and service delivery, more than 
$2.1 billion was invested into infrastructure planning 
and construction, with 23 projects completed across 
metropolitan and regional NSW.
•	Exceeded the Premier’s Priority of doubling Aboriginal 
people in senior leadership roles, increasing from 
five to 11, and established a stretch target of 16 
Aboriginal people in senior leadership roles by 2025.
•	Welcomed 1041 Junior Medical Officers to the 
NSW Health system in January, a record number of 
new starters, having increased 35 per cent from 2011, 
and the most of any state or territory in Australia.
•	Increased recruitment of graduate nurses and midwives 
with more than 2700 new graduates employed in 
2020-21, of which 25 per cent were located in rural 
and regional areas.
•	Offered dental care to 121,701 primary school students 
as part of the Primary School Mobile Dental Program. 
Of these students, 18,487 received dental treatment, 
78 per cent of whom had not previously accessed public 
dental services.

Year in review
This past year has been the first full year that we have 
worked in a pandemic environment. For us, it is important 
to reflect on the challenges and successes of progressing 
innovation in a disrupted environment, where the system 
has been rightly focused on responding to the COVID-19 
pandemic. 
Even in an environment where the biggest priority has 
been one of such significance, there are various projects 
that have needed to continue to benefit patients and 
clinicians, and offer efficiencies across the wider health 
system. These projects have represented evidence-based 
approaches, adding value to how care is delivered and 
needing multiple stakeholders to collaborate to ensure 
a successful outcome. 
Developing and delivering such projects – often in a 
virtual environment – presented greater challenges to how 
these initiatives were traditionally implemented, and 
it is a great credit to our staff that they have connected 
with clinicians and delivered successful initiatives together 
across NSW this year. 
Many of the statewide programs the Agency has worked 
on have not been impacted in terms of their rollout, despite 
the pandemic. For us, working in a system that can manage 
change in uncertain times – a system that keeps moving 
and improving – is something for us all to celebrate.
Our staff have worked with many rural and regional sites 
to extend the NSW Telestroke Service, benefiting stroke 
patients who would not otherwise have had access to 
life-saving treatment. In a similar vein, the Patient 
Reported Measures Program has continued in momentum. 
The launch of the IT platform that supports the program 
represented the culmination of an extensive collaboration 
between clinicians, patients and managers from around 
the state. Virtual care continues to be a key priority and 
our work partnering with eHealth NSW in accelerating its 
use in clinical settings was supported in local health 
districts throughout NSW. 
I would like to thank our staff who work with clinicians, 
and those who support the development of clinical 
initiatives throughout the pipeline of innovation, which 
enables these innovations to come to fruition. It is a 
testament to our collective ability to respond quickly to 
changes and different environments which allows our 
work to have a great reach across the health system. 
Key achievements 
•	Led the statewide implementation of Telestroke services 
including the development of resources and training 
modules for My Health Learning and Virtual Reality. 
The launch was achieved at 11 sites, enabling care to be 
delivered to over 800 stroke patients across regional and 
rural NSW with over 150 recommendations for 
reperfusion. 
•	Launched the Health Outcomes and Patient Experience 
purpose-built IT platform, enabling patients and their 
carers to provide direct, timely feedback about outcomes 
and experiences. Approximately 3554 patients and 
249 clinicians are active in the Health Outcomes and 
Patient Experience platform and 14,657 patient surveys 
have been completed.
•	Co-designed and piloted the Leading Better Value Care 
eMR solutions for the musculoskeletal cohorts, 
Osteoarthritis Chronic Care Program and Osteoporotic 
Refracture Prevention in two local health districts.
NSW Health	
Annual Report 2020-21   :  NSW Health organisations  :  page 253


•	Developed the 3Ci Model of Care, a principles-based 
model of care delivering value based healthcare for chronic 
heart failure and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, 
to support guideline-concordant care across the entire 
healthcare journey and reduce readmissions to hospital. 
•	Delivered key activities under the Surgery Action Plan, 
including a position paper on avoidance of non-beneficial 
surgery, recommendations for implementation of 
prehabilitation and low value surgery, key principles for 
colorectal enhanced recovery after surgery and 
examined specialties with the greatest potential for 
enhanced recovery after surgery.
•	Launched the Working with Consumers and Co-design 
toolkit. The toolkit is a practical resource for health 
services to adopt a co-design approach, enabling consumers 
to become equal partners in the improvement process.
•	Delivered the Vocational Intervention Program’s 
implementation report and economic analysis, which 
documented 53 vocational partnerships in NSW between 
20 vocational providers and 12 brain injury units. A total 
of 173 people engaged with the program, with 66 people 
achieving employment.
•	Led the statewide implementation of myVirtualCare and 
developed over 60 resources to support all users 
including patients, their families and carers, external 
users, interpreters, NSW Health providers and 
administration officers. As a result, over 3100 clinicians 
have used myVirtualCare for approximately 30,000 
patient consultations.
•	Incorporated the 8 Ways of Aboriginal Learning 
principles into the Redesign curriculum to help address 
issues faced by Aboriginal communities in accessing 
culturally safe and integrated healthcare.
•	Delivered the COVID-19 Critical Intelligence Unit, which 
has produced 400 integrated dashboards of data, 250 
daily digests of the academic literature, 100 topic-
specific evidence checks, 50 weekly reports on risk 
levels and international data and four online living 
evidence tables.
•	Strengthened the statewide COVID-19 response by 
leading 12 COVID-19 Communities of Practice and 
developing the Pandemic Kindness Movement website to 
support all health workers during the pandemic. The 
website has had over 100,000 views since its launch.

Chief Executive: Dr Diane Watson
Dr Diane Watson has led the establishment 
of three reporting agencies in Australia 
that use big data to drive decisions on 
healthcare provision nationally and locally. 
For more than 25 years, Diane has held 
senior management positions measuring, 
monitoring and reporting on the performance of 
healthcare systems to drive improvements in health, 
patient care and productivity. Diane was the inaugural 
Chief Executive Officer of the Victorian Agency for Health 
Information and the inaugural Chief Executive of the 
National Health Performance Authority.
Year in review
In 2020-21, the Bureau of Health Information continued 
to provide timely, accurate and comparable healthcare 
performance information to the people of NSW.
We published 13 reports and associated information products 
and worked closely with stakeholders to ensure our 
reporting is used to inform healthcare improvement efforts.
In March 2021, the Bureau’s latest Healthcare in Focus 
report provided insights into the impact of COVID-19 on 
the public healthcare system during 2020. It examined 
activity and performance throughout the year, looking at 
measures including timeliness of care, patients’ 
experiences, and COVID-19 cases and testing numbers.
The report expanded on the COVID-19 supplements 
published with the September and December 2020 issues 
of Healthcare Quarterly, our quarterly report on the performance 
of public hospital and ambulance services. In June 2021, 
Healthcare Quarterly also included analyses on quarantine 
services provided in response to the pandemic.
The June issue of Healthcare Quarterly coincided with the 
launch of the new Bureau of Health Information Data 
Portal, part of a transition to a digital-first way of reporting 
healthcare performance results in NSW, making them 
more accessible and user friendly.
Work continued to reform the NSW Patient Survey 
Program to help ensure patients’ voices drive 
improvements in experiences and outcomes of care. We 
heard from almost 59,000 people about their experiences 
across a variety of care settings and published patient 
survey results for emergency departments, admitted 
patients, rural admitted patients and maternity care.
NSW Health	
Annual Report 2020-21   :  NSW Health organisations   :  page 254


In July 2020, Healthcare in Focus examined the 
experiences of more than 200,000 people who visited 
emergency departments or were admitted to public 
hospitals over a five-year period. Trends in patients’ 
experiences were analysed to identify areas with 
significant improvement or decline.
At the end of 2020, the Bureau developed the first 
statewide survey to collect information about patients’ 
experiences and outcomes of virtual care outpatient 
appointments with NSW public hospitals. This formed 
the first part of a program of work that will help improve 
healthcare experiences and outcomes for patients 
across NSW.
Key developments for patient surveys included the 
introduction of shorter, more focused questionnaires and 
the application of advanced methods for standardising 
hospital results to ensure they take into account key 
differences in patient populations.
This past year, we also seconded almost a quarter of 
our staff to the Ministry to support the COVID-19 effort, 
particularly in the areas of communication, operations 
management, data analytics and information.
We thank our staff for their continued commitment to 
healthcare performance reporting. 
Key achievements 
•	Published Healthcare in Focus – People’s experiences 
of hospital care: Insights from five years of patient 
feedback, providing trend data to highlight achievements 
and opportunities for improvement.
•	Implemented shorter, more flexible surveys to reduce 
the burden on patients and focus on priority aspects of 
care, while maintaining robust and representative results.
•	Gave voice to almost 59,000 patients about their 
experiences with public hospitals and used sophisticated 
analytic methods to deliver insights into health system 
performance.
•	Provided patient experience and engagement key 
performance indicators for local health districts 
in line with their 2020-21 Service Agreements with 
NSW Health.
•	Published results from a census sample of adult 
Aboriginal patients admitted to or who gave birth 
in NSW public hospitals in 2019.
•	Published four Healthcare Quarterly reports featuring 
detailed information for the public about activity and 
performance in NSW public hospital and ambulance 
services, including COVID-19 supplements.
•	Achieved improvements in stakeholder perceptions 
of the Bureau as a trusted provider of information 
(88 per cent), fulfilling its purpose (88 per cent) and 
engaging with stakeholders (82 per cent).

Year in review
Despite excellent survival rates, cancer continues to be a 
significant public health issue and cause of premature 
death, impacting thousands of people in NSW.
The Cancer Institute NSW provides the strategic direction 
for cancer control across the state, which is driven by the 
goals of the fourth NSW Cancer Plan to:
•	reduce the incidence of cancer 
•	increase the survival rate of people with cancer 
•	improve the quality of life of people with cancer.
We work in close collaboration with the health system, 
non-government organisations, community members and 
researchers to develop and implement patient-centred 
initiatives across the spectrum of cancer control. We 
continue to focus on improving outcomes for groups that 
are disproportionately affected by cancer, including 
Aboriginal people, multicultural communities, and people 
from rural, remote and lower socioeconomic backgrounds.
The Institute manages strategic investment on behalf of 
the NSW Government to build research capacity, attract 
world-class researchers, foster innovation and support the 
translation of discoveries into clinical practice. 
NSW Health	
Annual Report 2020-21   :  NSW Health organisations  :  page 255


This year, we invested $21 million in cancer research 
and modified our funding model to increase investment in 
our successful Translational Program Grants scheme.
We delivered the tenth round of the Reporting for Better 
Cancer Outcomes program providing local and statewide 
cancer information to local health districts, specialty 
networks, primary health networks and participating 
private hospitals. Reporting for Better Cancer Outcomes 
provides a comprehensive view of cancer control in NSW, 
informing health system performance and identifying 
areas for improvement.
One in three cancers are caused by lifestyle behaviours. 
The Institute promotes healthy lifestyle behaviours 
through our public campaigns, website and social media 
information, and smoking cessation support initiatives, 
such as the NSW Quitline and the icanquit.com.au website. 
We continued to support cancer services to gain 
sustainable efficiencies in the delivery of care during 
COVID-19, optimising clinical resources without 
compromising outcomes. We encouraged people to 
safely access health services, see their doctor about 
symptoms, and participate in the national cancer 
screening programs. BreastScreen NSW was able to 
resume safe, high-quality screening following a short 
suspension of service during the pandemic.
Finally, as custodian of the NSW Cancer Plan, we worked 
in collaboration with stakeholders in cancer control to 
draft the fifth plan, which will take effect in 2022, sitting 
under the Future Health Strategy.
Thank you to our staff and colleagues in cancer 
control for their commitment to reducing the burden 
of cancer in NSW.
Key achievements 
•	Launched Sun and UV at School, a suite of evidence-
based teaching resources aligned to NSW Science and 
Personal Development, Health and Physical Education 
curriculum for Kindergarten to year 10. The resources, 
which were developed with the Department of Education, 
are linked to the Australian curriculum and SunSmart 
program. Sun and UV at School includes complete units 
of work, individual lessons, animations, infographics, 
links to data repositories and grab-and-go activities.
•	Promoted early detection of breast, bowel and 
cervical cancers through the delivery of comprehensive 
screening programs with focused programs for 
Aboriginal people and culturally and linguistically diverse 
groups, and supported the delivery of safe screening 
by BreastScreen NSW during the COVID-19 pandemic.
•	Improved the knowledge, skills and confidence of staff 
working in cancer services to deliver smoking cessation 
interventions through the promotion of the Smoking 
Cessation Framework in Cancer Services, facilitated 
technical change for data collection and secure referrals 
to NSW Quitline, and established standardised data 
fields and functionality for smoking cessation in 
electronic medical record systems, resulting in more 
patients of cancer services receiving support to quit 
smoking at the time of diagnosis.
•	Continued to focus on the provision of value-based, 
patient-centred cancer care through the implementation 
of two Leading Better Value Care initiatives:
	 -	 
Direct access colonoscopy – continued to support local 
health districts to implement the Direct Access 
Colonoscopy Model of Care, which outlines the 
mandatory and recommended inclusions for localised 
implementation of services, and undertook a baseline 
patient reported experience measure survey
	 -	 
Breast cancer hypofractionated radiotherapy – the 
proportion of women with early-stage breast cancer 
who received hypofractionated radiotherapy increased 
from 75 per cent in 2017 to 90 per cent in 2020 in 
NSW public facilities, and from 52 per cent in 2017 
to 83 per cent in 2020 in NSW private facilities.
•	Expanded and optimised digital channels for people 
affected by or at risk of cancer, supporting users to 
access accurate information and support when they 
need it and promoting cancer services that meet quality 
measures to drive better outcomes. In 2020-21, there 
were 261,778 users of Canrefer, an online directory listing 
specialists who are active members of a multidisciplinary 
cancer care team. Canrefer also released a new feature 
to assist users to find cancer clinical trials in their area 
that are currently or soon to be recruiting participants. 
Information on patients.cancer.nsw.gov.au has been 
expanded to include information about 33 cancer types, 
with content available in eight community languages.
•	Continued to expand eviQ.org.au, which now has 640,847 
total users, representing a 23 per cent increase from the 
previous year. eviQ Education, which has about 108,063 
total users, supports the rapid uptake of emerging 
evidence into clinical practice and responds to the 
evolving learning needs of oncology professionals 
at the point of care. This year, eviQ Education released 
14 learning resources and an additional 13 learning 
resources for oncology professionals.
•	Invested more than $12.4 million in mass media public 
education campaigns to reduce smoking rates and 
participation in cancer screening programs. This included 
the development and launch of a new advertising 
campaign to increase participation in the National Bowel 
Cancer Screening Program.
NSW Health	
Annual Report 2020-21   :  NSW Health organisations   :  page 256


•	Published the sixth publicly available Cancer Control in 
NSW: Statewide report, as part of the Reporting for 
Better Cancer Outcomes program. This report included 
more than 70 key performance indicators across cancer 
control. We also collaborated with the Aboriginal Health 
and Medical Research Council of NSW to develop 
the inaugural Reporting for Better Cancer Outcomes: 
Aboriginal people in NSW report, which highlights the 
impact of cancers on Aboriginal communities and 
opportunities for improvement.
•	Continued to support person-centred cancer care 
by collecting patients’ perspectives through patient-
reported measures surveys and providing personalised 
information to inform shared decision making in 
seven local health districts. 
•	Strengthened cancer research capacity by investing 
$21 million in cancer research, including grants and 
clinical trials, and increasing support for translational 
research programs, which aim to ensure scientific 
discoveries have a real impact at the point of care.

Year in review
In a year marked by one of the world’s greatest health 
emergencies, I am proud of the Clinical Excellence 
Commission’s response to the COVID-19 pandemic, while 
maintaining focus on its primary objective to promote 
and support improved clinical care, safety and quality 
across the NSW public health system. 
As the lead agency for Infection Prevention and 
Control, the Commission played a critical role throughout 
2020-21 in keeping frontline staff, patients and visitors 
safe through the COVID-19 pandemic and supporting 
the system with strategic guidance, advice, resources 
and education. 
The Commission was also successful in supporting 
Infection Control Practitioners, who played a critical role 
in providing expertise across the NSW health system to 
reduce the risk of the COVID-19 virus spreading. 
In response to the pandemic, we developed a wide range 
of COVID-19 resources to provide targeted advice and 
expertise to NSW Health and external agencies, including 
aged care facilities, private hospitals and essential 
services such as Police and Transport NSW.
We delivered the COVID-19 Infection Prevention and Control 
Manual (2021), a consolidated guide for acute 
and non-acute healthcare settings. We implemented 
robust governance processes for product review and 
procurement in partnership with HealthShare NSW. 
This successful program of work ensured NSW Health 
was proactive in the post-market review of facemasks 
and removals from the Therapeutic Goods Administration 
register. We developed and launched an online NSW 
Health-wide interactive table of medicines with disruptions 
to supply, which enables health professionals to manage 
real-time medicine shortages. 
Vital to stopping transmission of COVID-19 is the NSW 
Hotel Quarantine and Airport Program Quality Assurance 
Program, which was managed by the State Health 
Emergency Operations Centre throughout 2020-21 
with support from the Commission, Sydney Local Health 
District and Healthcare Australia. Our role provided 
a mechanism to identify trends, exemplary practices, 
areas of concern and opportunities for education and 
improvement across all aspects of quarantine infection 
prevention and control in NSW.
The Commission’s Patient Safety team led the successful 
statewide implementation of the revised NSW Health Incident 
Management Policy Directive and, in collaboration with eHealth 
NSW, the rollout of the ims+ incident management system.
In addition to supporting the COVID-19 response, in 
2020 our NSW Mental Health Patient Safety Program 
team partnered with mental health services to lead 
safety and improvement work aligned to the needs 
of staff and consumers.
We continued to develop the Quality Improvement 
Data System’s capacity to translate raw data into insights, 
adding a morbidity and mortality meeting module to 
provide a secure platform for clinical teams.
NSW Health	
Annual Report 2020-21   :  NSW Health organisations  :  page 257


The Commission also developed its education and training 
offering, namely the updated Safety & Quality Essentials 
Pathway, to enable participating staff to build the skills 
and knowledge needed for effective leaders of safety and 
quality improvement in daily practice.
I would like to thank our staff for their resilience and 
resolve in delivering these remarkable outcomes during 
a challenging year when each went above and beyond 
to respond to public need and strive for safety of care for 
every patient, every time.
Key achievements 
•	Supported 1.5 million webpage views and over 
250,000 downloads of COVID-19 resources in 2020-21. 
•	Collaborated with HealthShare NSW to conduct 196 
personal protective equipment (PPE) reviews, totalling 
430 PPE product assessments, and delivered weekly 
PPE audits via the Quality Audit Reporting System for 
local health districts and specialty health networks.
•	Responded to 968 notifications regarding issues with 
medical devices, medicines and biological agents 
with our Critical Response Unit conducting risk 
assessments. Of these, 18 required system-wide critical 
responses related to product issues and shortages to 
ensure the safe delivery of care and continued service 
delivery. We issued 25 urgent safety alert broadcasts, 
including 12 related to clinical issues and 13 related 
to medicines and vaccines. These were in addition 
to 19 medication safety updates and 10 medication 
safety communications as part of our primary function 
to minimise potential harm.
•	Developed and led implementation of a statewide 
Respiratory Protection Program with participation by 
more than 38,000 health workers; and coordinated a 
whole-of-health approach to developing standardised 
resources for fit checking, fit testing, reporting 
and training.
•	Developed new Morbidity and Mortality meeting 
guidelines in conjunction with clinicians and established 
these on the Quality Improvement Data System platform 
for clinical teams to access near real-time data and 
generate insights for meetings. The new Morbidity and 
Mortality guidelines identify six core principles that 
reflect contemporary safety and quality principles, which 
are guided by Human Factors science to support robust 
processes that improve learning and system 
improvement. 
•	Developed, tested and released a Safety Culture 
Measurement Toolkit to serve as a self-contained set 
of instructions and templates to enable health services 
to administer a safety culture survey effectively and 
adapt for local conditions.

Year in review
Supporting the COVID-19 health response, lifelong 
learning and providing quality and accessible education 
were three areas of focus for the Health Education and 
Training Institute (HETI) over the past year. These focus 
areas were brought to life through the delivery of timely, 
high-quality and evidence-based education and training to 
the NSW Health workforce and to the Institute’s higher 
education students. 
As part of the COVID-19 health response, the Institute 
collaborated to provide training to close contact tracers, 
with the program recognised as a finalist in the Recovery 
and Resilience category in the 2020 Premier’s Awards. 
We delivered a mid-year medical graduate recruitment 
process for unfilled intern positions to support the medical 
workforce surge strategy and designed and delivered a 
bespoke Care Assistant Program as a COVID-19 strategy 
in the event of catastrophic staffing shortages.
The Senior Executive Development Program adapted 
to virtual delivery, maximising the virtual environment to 
present dynamic and engaging group presentations to 
senior staff, which included the Secretary NSW Health. 
We delivered the NSW Health Leadership Program in 
partnership with local health districts and contextualised 
to their strategic and operational challenges. The Institute 
was also a key partner with the NSW Ministry of Health’s 
Health System Strategy and Planning Branch on the 
NSW Health Future Health Strategy Consultations. 
Through the Allied Health Workplace Learning Grant 
Program, we supported allied health professionals to 
upskill in clinical knowledge and capability to support 
patient care. 
HETI Higher Education doubled its student numbers 
in the last year. It redesigned the Graduate Certificate 
Applied Mental Health Studies into shorter modules 
to support more accessible learning for award study, 
which can be stacked towards a later award or for 
professional development, all for improved mental 
health outcomes.
This snapshot of achievements highlights a successful 
year for the Institute in promoting and supporting a 
connected and responsive learning community across 
NSW Health. Thank you to all our staff for their dedication 
and commitment to learning, training and development.
Key achievements 
•	Developed and implemented a process to enable 
prevocational medical accreditation surveys to occur 
virtually. This enabled HETI to continue monitoring and 
accrediting facilities to ensure high-quality education 
and training and junior doctor wellbeing.
•	Welcomed 12 medical graduates in intern positions in 
July 2020 and planned for the recruitment of a 
subsequent mid-year intake to commence in July 2021.
•	Assisted in identifying and coordinating 63 facilitators 
to deliver 98 workshops across the state on the NSW 
Health Future Health Strategy Consultations, including 
delivery of the Facilitation Development program to 
22 NSW Ministry of Health staff.
•	Delivered the virtual Senior Executive Development 
Program to 22 participants to September 2020.
•	Delivered the NSW Health Leadership Program to 
a total of 263 participants.
•	Supported 100 participants to complete the bespoke 
Care Assistance Program, with the one-week program 
delivered via online workshops supported by My Health 
Learning modules. 
•	Trained over 600 close contact tracers, in collaboration 
with the NSW Ministry of Health, by rapidly developing 
and delivering a rolling program of innovative, interactive 
and just-in-time online training as part of the critical 
COVID-19 pandemic response.
•	Increased recruitment and engagement of junior 
doctors training in rural NSW for the Rural Generalist 
Medical Training Program with 52 Foundation Year 
trainees enrolled and 29 trainees undertaking the 
12-month advanced skills training. A further eight 
general practitioners undertook 12 months of advanced 
skills training.

Year in review
Justice Health and Forensic Mental Health Network (the 
Network) delivers healthcare to adults and young people 
in contact with the forensic mental health and criminal 
justice systems, across community, inpatient and 
custodial settings.
The Network’s vision is to return healthier people back 
to their communities. 
The 2020-21 year demonstrated the commitment and 
professionalism of our staff who, despite the challenging 
circumstances, delivered comprehensive and timely care 
to the most vulnerable people, with extremely complex 
healthcare needs, in the community.
In collaboration with Corrective Services and Youth Justice 
NSW, the Network developed a COVID-19 response model 
for screening, isolation, quarantine, contract tracing and 
auditing for the correctional and detention systems. 
Our efforts were rewarded – with zero cases of COVID-19 
community transmission among people in custody in NSW 
correctional and detention centres. The Network has 
continued testing people in custody for COVID-19, having 
also rolled out the COVID-19 vaccination program to staff, 
people in custody and Custodial staff across the Network.
We rapidly expanded our telehealth program, and 
introduced a bespoke program for Aboriginal and Torres 
Strait Islander people in custody. In 2020-21, five per cent 
of all consultations were virtual. Funding of almost 
$220,000 helped us to set up an Aboriginal Telehealth 
Team to provide culturally sensitive mental health support 
and other health services.
In October 2020, the Network began a Community 
Transitions Trial to support highly vulnerable individuals 
with serious and enduring mental illness leaving custody. 
Funded through the COVID-19 Vulnerable Populations 
Initiative, the multi-agency collaboration supported 
140,000 people returning to their communities. 
Participants had four times the rate of engagement 
with treatment compared with people in custody without 
this support (based on published studies), and also had 
high rates of housing and other health and wellbeing 
measures. It was so successful, recurrent funding has 
been granted.
Our long-term goal to reduce rates of seclusions and 
restraints was achieved. In November 2020, the use of 
long-term seclusion ceased, forever changing the course 
of patients’ care and experience at the Forensic Hospital 
in Malabar. Since this time, the hospital has been able 
to bring its seclusion rates below the state’s average 
and achieved – a previously inconceivable milestone of 
– zero seclusion episodes for the month of April 2021.
Thank you to our staff who went above and beyond 
this year to deliver healthcare and reassurance to our 
patients and people in custody under extremely difficult 
circumstances. The professionalism, resilience and ability 
to overcome the challenges was inspiring, as was the 
care they demonstrated for the people whose lives we 
change and care for every day. 
Key achievements 
•	Diverted 80 per cent of adults identified as mentally 
ill into community-based treatment. Ninety-two per cent 
of young people were recommended for mental health 
diversion into community-based treatment.
•	Received $14.66 million in funding to build a mental 
health intensive care facility (Freshwater Unit) at the 
Forensic Hospital from the $700 million Statewide 
Mental Health Infrastructure Fund.
•	Implemented the use of depot buprenorphine as the 
preferred treatment for opioid addiction in NSW public 
gaols. By the end June 2021, 67 per cent of the Network’s 
Opioid Agonistic Treatment patients (1087 of 1614 
patients) were receiving depot buprenorphine, up from 
45 per cent the previous year. 
NSW Health	
Annual Report 2020-21   :  NSW Health organisations   :  page 260


•	Increased virtual care consultations by 27 per cent 
(compared with 2019-20). Successfully trialled Virtual 
Cardiology clinics with Prince of Wales Hospital, 
with a 59 per cent increase in clinical session use, 
a 56 per cent decrease in patient transfers, and a patient 
satisfaction score of 93 per cent.
•	Clinically significant improvements in inpatient mental 
health outcomes, as Long Bay Hospital mental health 
inpatients increased from 55 per cent of patients to 82 
per cent. For Aboriginal patients, clinically significant 
improvements in mental health outcomes were found in 
67 per cent of patients, up from 47 per cent in 2019-20*.
•	Introduced a new electronic tool, with an algorithm 
designed to support clinic decision making, which has 
improved the detection of mental illness on reception 
screening by 35.5 per cent.
•	Provided National Disability Insurance Scheme support 
for 98 per cent of patients leaving custody with a dual 
diagnosis of an intellectual disability and a severe and 
persistent mental illness, resulting in a decrease in 
recidivism with 73 per cent remaining out of custody.
•	Completed a nine-month Community Transitions Trial 
from October 2020 to support the community transition 
of highly vulnerable individuals with serious and enduring 
mental illness leaving custody.
•	Screened all patients for Hepatitis C (HCV) via the 
Point of Care Testing pilot program at the Metropolitan 
Remand and Reception Centre at Silverwater from 
January to July 2021. Positive patients were scripted for 
treatment before entering the general prison population.
•	Supported 2046 adult patients in the Aboriginal Chronic 
Care Program, well above the target of 1325.

Year in review
Sydney Children’s Hospitals Network, incorporating 
Sydney Children’s Hospital, Randwick, The Children’s 
Hospital at Westmead, the Newborn and paediatric 
Emergency Transport Service, Bear Cottage and the 
Children’s Court Clinic, is the largest provider of paediatric 
health services in Australia. 
In 2020-21, our two hospitals saw occupancy averaging 
84.7 per cent and cared for 172,898 children. Care 
included 1,153,001 occasions of service (being 
examination, consultation, treatment or other service 
provided in a non-admitted setting), and 97,786 
emergency department presentations. 
As part of our COVID-19 response, we adapted our models 
of care to safely deliver services to patients and families. 
COVID-19 testing clinics were established at Randwick and 
Westmead and, in March this year, vaccination hubs were 
activated at both sites as part of the NSW COVID-19 
vaccination program. In 2020-21, our COVID Positive 
Outpatients Response Team cared for 97 children who 
tested positive to COVID-19 in the community. 
The past year saw 75,993 telehealth consultations 
(telephone and audio visual), with 30,001 children cared for 
virtually, an increase of 25 per cent on the previous year. 
This year, the Network established virtualKIDS, Australia’s 
first paediatric-specific virtual care service. The 24/7 
nursing-led service supports patients receiving care closer 
to home in collaboration with local care teams, through 
functions such as remote monitoring, a patient and family 
hotline, collaborative virtual ward rounds and coordination 
of specialty advice facilitation.
In March 2021, Westmead’s state-of-the-art Central Acute 
Services Building was officially opened by the Premier of 
NSW, Gladys Berejiklian. The Central Acute Services 
Building forms the centrepiece of the $1 billion-plus 
Westmead Redevelopment and is a collaboration between 
Westmead Hospital, The Children’s Hospital at Westmead 
and the University of Sydney. It includes two new 
emergency departments – one for adults and one for 
children, 25 digital operating theatres and more than 300 
patient rooms.

this has not precluded us from thriving across our broader 
endeavours and many successes during this time, which 
we are proud to acknowledge.
NSW Health	
Annual Report 2020-21   :  NSW Health organisations   :  page 262


In late 2020, we embarked upon an expanded model 
of service delivery – stvincent’s@home, aimed at 
progressing our health service into the next phase 
of healthcare provision beyond our traditional hospital 
walls. It incorporates six key projects, including expansion 
of telehealth and Hospital in the Home, as well as Virtual 
Outpatients and Virtual Hospital projects. 
The Network established the St Vincent’s Community 
Access and Assessment Team, created specifically to 
complement the care that the Mental Health and 
Homeless Health Case Managers provide, focusing on 
supporting those with particularly complex health and 
social needs. 
A first for NSW, the St Vincent’s Community Access 
and Assessment Team provides specialist assessments 
for vulnerable people with the aim of hospital avoidance, 
diagnostic clarification, and to support appropriate 
referral pathways to services such as the National 
Disability Insurance Scheme, the Aged Care Assessment 
Team and NSW Civil and Administrative Tribunal 
Guardianship Division.
We also commenced our Police Ambulance and Clinical 
Early Response (PACER) service, a team of mental 
health clinicians that partner with local police and 
NSW Ambulance to provide expert and specialist support 
for people in crisis and experiencing mental health 
distress. The team work in collaboration with Kings Cross 
and Surry Hills Police to meet people’s complex social 
and health needs in the community at the scene of the 
crisis, or in their home, to provide immediate expert 
assessment and treatment.
We established a vaccination clinic, adopted by 
St Vincent’s, City of Sydney, St Vincent de Paul and 
other frontline non-government organisations to provide 
equitable access to COVID-19 vaccinations for people 
experiencing homelessness. 
Additionally, following the success of a pilot program, 
NSW Ministry of Health allocated permanent, ongoing 
funding for the St Vincent’s Alcohol and Drug Telehealth 
Service. The program provides Addiction Medicine 
Specialist clinics to facilitate access to specialist care for 
people living in remote and rural areas in the Murrumbidgee 
region, living with substance use dependence. 
In late 2020, The Trustees of St Vincent’s Hospital 
purchased the site of the Green Park Hotel to use for 
hospital-related patient and community care and as part 
of this acquisition, St Vincent’s have increased mental 
health support.
Key achievements 
•	As at 30 June 2021, provided COVID-19 vaccinations 
to over 1000 people experiencing homelessness.
•	Expanded St Vincent’s Alcohol and Drug Telehealth 
Service, with the service now supporting Southern NSW 
Local Health District, Far West Local Health District and 
Western NSW Local Health District on an ongoing basis. 
•	Launched the Safe Haven model in support of the NSW 
Government Towards Zero Suicides initiative.
•	Achieved accreditation under the National Clinical Trials 
Governance Framework, for the Australian Commission 
on Safety and Quality in Health Care. St Vincent’s was 
awarded the top level for all 14 of the criteria in Standard 
2, and achieved top level in 31 out of 33 criteria in 
Standard 1.
•	Launched a Remote Patient Monitoring platform to 
manage COVID-19-positive patients. The platform 
provides a tailored patient portal via a mobile phone 
app, which allows the patient to undertake daily 
self-assessments of their health status.
•	Commenced a clinical trial using psilocybin, a known 
psychedelic drug. The aim is to determine if using 
psilocybin will benefit treatment for clients attempting 
to stop or reduce their use of methamphetamine.
•	Performed Australia’s first remote transcatheter 
aortic valve implantation, a minimally invasive procedure 
that helps to repair a damaged aortic valve, using 
Augmented Reality.

Year in review
In a year defined by the global COVID-19 pandemic, 
NSW Ambulance rolled out numerous strategies to 
improve our service to the community, provided enhanced 
education to staff to improve their clinical practice and 
safety, and delivered several new initiatives to guide the 
organisation into the future.
As part of our response to COVID-19, staff safety and 
protection programs were implemented which included an 
effective vaccination rollout. Intensive Care Paramedics 
also took part in an update course to improve patient care 
and paramedic safety when treating patients with 
suspected or confirmed COVID-19. 
Education and training was also extended to other key 
stakeholders. Notably, the NSW Ambulance Public Access 
Defibrillation program saw participation from other 
emergency service organisations to help improve out-of-
hospital cardiac arrest survival rates in NSW by decreasing 
the time to CPR and defibrillation, and the ‘Save Triple 
Zero for Saving Lives’ public education campaign.
The health and wellbeing of staff has also been a key 
focus in 2020-21. Our dedicated Staff Health team 
implemented a number of innovative programs to improve 
wellbeing and physical fitness, and support all staff in the 
performance of their roles and services to the community.
This past year, the transformation of NSW Ambulance 
infrastructure in rural and regional NSW has continued, 
with two purpose-built stations commissioned at 
Sawtell and Cootamundra and supplementary funding 
received for a new service to Iluka as part of Rural 
Ambulance Infrastructure Reconfiguration Stage 1. 
An additional $100 million budget was also allocated 
to deliver upgraded, rebuilt or entirely new services in 
regional NSW as part of Rural Ambulance Infrastructure 
Reconfiguration Stage 2. 
Funding sourced in 2021 to increase our fleet of new 
state-of-the-art Paramedic Intensive Care Unit 
ambulances is another boost for stations in regional 
and rural NSW, with a majority of the new vehicles 
allocated to these areas.
A major achievement for us was the launch of our Vision 
and Strategic Plan for 2021-2026. The plan builds on what 
we do best and modifies our services and structures so 
that we can provide even better value care for the 
community through a modern, innovative and integrated 
service, linked to the whole of the NSW Health system.
Finally, and most importantly, NSW Ambulance staff 
responded throughout the year with professionalism and 
dedication to keeping patients, colleagues and our 
communities safe. We acknowledge and thank them for 
their adaptability and commitment.
Key achievements
•	Secured funding to replace 69 existing ambulances 
with Intensive Care Unit ambulances. The high 
specifications of the ICU ambulances improve paramedic 
safety and patient care.
•	Implemented Respirator Fit Testing for clinicians 
across NSW.
•	Expanded the statewide Workforce Enhancement 
Program into its third year with 180 new staff recruited. 
To help meet demand, the training of 100 paramedics 
was brought forward as part of the NSW Government’s 
commitment to increase recruitment of new paramedic 
and call centre staff. Meanwhile, the Rural Structural 
Reform enabled the reduction of on-call rosters at 
12 locations across regional NSW to improve emergency 
care to the community, as well as paramedic safety 
and wellbeing by reducing fatigue.
NSW Health	
Annual Report 2020-21   :  NSW Health organisations   :  page 264


•	Educated more than 650 Intensive Care Paramedics 
across NSW through the Intensive Care Paramedic 
COVID-19 Update Program. Along with being introduced 
to new equipment, Intensive Care Paramedics were 
educated on human factors, leadership growth, 
mentoring and crew resource management.
•	Opened Randwick Superstation and Mona Vale Station 
under the Sydney Ambulance Metropolitan 
Infrastructure Strategy program.
•	Launched a media campaign in early May 2021, appealing 
for the public to ‘Save Triple Zero (000) for Saving Lives’. 
At a time when NSW Ambulance has never been busier, 
the campaign aimed to educate the public to only call 
Triple Zero in emergency situations. It was featured 
in all major television, radio, print and online media 
outlets across NSW.
•	Rolled out the statewide Medic Fit program and 
established a Domestic Violence Referral Offer Network 
to support staff health and wellbeing.

over the four years to 2024-25, delivering critical new 
and upgraded facilities and services across metropolitan 
and regional NSW.

The core focus of planning and delivering the largest 
health capital works program remains, with greater focus 
on all aspects of sustainability, asset and facility advisory 
and precincts and commercial partnerships, in line with 
priorities in the Health Infrastructure Strategy. To support 
this new strategy, we realigned expertise and services to 
expand our existing commercial services, support our new 
precincts work program and strengthen focus on advisory 
support and asset programs.
We worked extensively across government and industry 
to support the state’s economic recovery through the 
planning and delivery of our largest-ever capital pipeline. 
This included completion of 23 projects across 
metropolitan and regional NSW, and progression of 
world-leading health and education precincts at 
Westmead, Liverpool and Randwick which are linking 
health professionals with students, researchers and 
academics in a pioneering approach to future-proofing 
public health.
Significant progress was made towards better use of 
existing health assets, as outlined in the Health 
Infrastructure Strategy. We partnered with health entities 
to deliver the first annual documentation for both NSW 
Health and health entities – including Maturity 
Assessments, Strategic Asset Management Plans and 
Asset Management Plans, along with NSW Health’s Asset 
Management Framework, Implementation Plan and 
Attestation Statement.
A dedicated implementation project was established 
for the Facility Planning Process to ensure Health 
Infrastructure’s capital projects are delivered strategically 
and consistently, with better connection to functional 
support, and improved policies and procedures to support 
the new requirements. Five interconnected stages are 
aligned with the project lifecycle, ensuring our capital 
assets are fit for purpose, future focused, and enable 
high-quality and safe care.

Year in review
The HealthShare NSW (HealthShare) team of more than 
7000 staff continued to play an integral role in NSW 
Health over the last year. As NSW Health’s shared service 
provider, the organisation partnered with its customers 
and community to support the ongoing effectiveness of 
the NSW Government’s response to COVID-19.
This year, HealthShare implemented a new four-year 
strategic plan with a specific focus on partnering for 
patients. This focus, in line with the Secretary’s Priorities, 
has already begun to elevate HealthShare’s connection 
to patients, their families and carers, both directly and 
indirectly, through its services. In addition to partnering 
for patients, HealthShare’s Strategic Plan for 2020-2024 
is underpinned by its three pillars of sustainability, 
collaboration and its people.
HealthShare’s Patient Transport Service is responsible for 
the transport of non-emergency patients and has played 
a pivotal role in the COVID-19 response. Over the last year, 
the Patient Transport Service established the Airport and 
Hotel Quarantine Operations Patient Transport Service 
team to provide highly specialised and safe airport and 
hotel quarantine transport. 
NSW Health	
Annual Report 2020-21   :  NSW Health organisations   :  page 266


This elite team is responsible for transporting COVID-19-
positive and suspected positive patients from the airport 
to fit-for-purpose quarantine hotels. The service has 
transported thousands of travellers between the airport, 
hotel quarantine and hospitals for treatment. 
HealthShare’s Clinical Support Services is responsible 
for providing food, linen and cleaning services to hospitals 
across NSW. Over the last year, the service has had a 
pivotal role in the state’s COVID-19 response by partnering 
with industry to provide more than 700,000 meals to 
returning passengers quarantining in Special Health 
Accommodation.  
Even with COVID-19-related global supply chain shortages 
over the last year, HealthShare’s Procurement and Supply 
Chain Operations teams have done a remarkable job 
maintaining the supply of personal protective equipment 
(PPE) to 100 per cent of all NSW Health staff and patients. 
The team has also provided the required PPE to other 
NSW Government agencies to ensure the continued 
provision of essential government services. This team has 
also managed ordering, storage and distribution of the 
medical consumables required as part of the vaccination 
rollout, from forecasting and sourcing the consumables 
required, to supporting the operationalisation of the NSW 
Government’s mass vaccination centres, to onboarding 
frontline staff with their uniforms. 
We thank our exceptional HealthShare NSW teams for 
their extraordinary work over the last year and for 
continuing to support and partner with our customers, 
patients and community.

NSW Health Pathology was again indispensable to 
the NSW public health response to COVID-19 – caring, 
connecting and pioneering for all of us in these 
extraordinary times.
We kept pace with the shifting challenge of COVID-19 
while maintaining exceptional business-as-usual 
performance.
Our staff and their communities were again hit by natural 
disasters, which threatened lives and service disruption. 
But they kept going, showing the incredible resilience and 
innovation this organisation is known for.

In January 2021, our Director of Public Health Pathology, 
Professor Dominic Dwyer, was one of 17 international 
experts chosen by the World Health Organization for 
funded travel to Wuhan, China, to investigate the source 
of SARS-CoV-2 – the virus that causes COVID-19 disease.
Meanwhile, we processed more than 3.6 million COVID-19 
tests, including more than 500,000 saliva screening tests 
for hotel quarantine workers. 
Whole genome sequencing assisted public health 
responses, and work continued on tests to diagnose new 
variants of concern and differentiate between vaccine-
induced and natural infection antibodies.
Over 2.4 million people registered for our COVID-19 
SMS Results Service, which was joint winner of the 2020 
NSW Premier’s Putting the Customer at the Centre Award 
and acknowledged by Harvard Business Review.
We continued to push ahead with initiatives vital to the 
future of our services – our Specimen Tracking Project, 
Statewide Test Catalogue and the transition to a single, 
statewide laboratory information system.
Our Innovate Reconciliation Action Plan was launched 
with great pride, demonstrating our commitment to 
building respectful relationships with Aboriginal and 
Torres Strait Islander peoples and achieving meaningful 
gains in closing the health and justice gaps for these 
communities. 
Our scientists working in partnership with the Fertility 
and Research Centre at The Royal Hospital for Women 
in Randwick and the University of New South Wales 
celebrated the birth of the service’s first IVF baby, Ryan.
We received 116 nominations for our second-ever NSW 
Health Pathology Awards, which filled me with admiration. 
The courage in adversity, strength and determination of 
our 5000-plus workforce never ceases to amaze me 
and I thank them all for their tireless efforts in what has 
been another challenging, yet extraordinary year.
Key achievements
•	Eased anxiety and time in isolation for patients and 
saved 423,000 hours in calls or 42,000 shifts for health 
workers through significant uptake of our COVID-19 
SMS Results Service.
•	Launched our Innovate Reconciliation Action Plan guided 
and endorsed by Reconciliation Australia. The two-year 
plan details practical actions we will undertake to 
contribute to reconciliation within NSW Health Pathology 
and the communities we serve.
•	Progressed Fusion, NSW Health Pathology’s investment 
in a new statewide laboratory information management 
system and key enabling projects that will reduce costs, 
waste and clinical uncertainty, while enhancing quality 
of care for communities.
•	Progressed a new statewide Forensic Medicine 
Information System to the build phase, which will 
improve timeframes in the coronial system and help our 
Forensic Medicine staff to better support bereaved 
families.
•	Piloted a new purpose-built statewide specimen 
tracking system across 12 labs, with more to follow. 
The system will standardise the way we receive, track 
and dispatch specimens so they arrive safely every 
time. This will improve patient safety, avoid potential 
delays and duplication, and reduce the chance of 
misplaced samples.
•	Completed a new system to house a catalogue of testing 
services, with rollout underway. A ‘single source of truth’, 
it provides current, accurate information about collection, 
handling and testing across all sites and links to 
resources for staff, patient and clinician.
•	Provided expert scientific analysis to support the NSW 
Government’s Drug Surveillance Strategy to directly 
inform community alerts about harmful substances and 
to support the treatment of critically ill patients 
presenting to emergency departments.
•	Piloted a new billing system to be rolled out in all 
operational areas replacing four systems with one 
statewide solution. The Statewide Billing Project will 
streamline and simplify processes and reduce double-
handling, enable improved reporting capability and 
improve compliance and reporting for Medicare 
requirements.
•	Rolled out modern, professional, standardised signage 
to help patients and customers find their way around 
140 NSW Health Pathology facilities including 
laboratories and collection centres. The durable internal 
and external signage reinforces our identity as a 
statewide service, builds brand awareness with staff and 
the community and complies with industry standards.

Dr Zoran Bolevich is Chief Executive of 
eHealth NSW and Chief Information 
Officer of NSW Health. He has a 
background in medicine and business 
administration and has worked in senior 
health system management, health IT 
and data analytics leadership roles in Australia and 
New Zealand. 
Leading a team of more than 1600 staff, Zoran is focused on 
implementing the eHealth Strategy for NSW Health, 
streamlining governance of eHealth NSW’s key programs 
and activities, and developing a highly effective, customer-
focused health IT organisation. He is passionate about 
improving the health system through meaningful and 
effective use of digital technologies, data analytics, research 
and innovation in partnership with patients, clinicians, 
health organisations, government and industry partners.
Year in review
The pandemic has increased reliance on technology 
and accelerated digitisation across the globe in all sectors, 
including healthcare. Responding to the past year’s 
challenges has reinforced the importance of NSW 
Health’s approach to building consistent ICT foundations. 
Our enterprise-wide platforms have enabled us to scale 
at pace and to innovate – responding with agility and 
efficiency. 
COVID-19 continued to drive the digitisation of healthcare 
and demands upon network infrastructure. Critical 
communications infrastructure supported by eHealth 
NSW, such as our Health Wide Area Network and data 
centres, were vital in supporting increased network traffic. 
Working closely with the State Health Emergency Operations 
Centre and Public Health Emergency Operations Centre, 
we developed digital solutions to support the health 
system’s COVID-19 response. A system to fast-track 
vaccinations of frontline workers was rapidly developed 
and subsequently made accessible to the public. In 
parallel, a system was designed and implemented to 
enable the entire vaccination management process. 
Enabling patients to connect with health professionals 
virtually was critical in rural and metropolitan locations. 
It was also pivotal in connecting patients with family 
and friends. A Virtual Care Accelerator was established 
to drive development and uptake of virtual care and 
telehealth, first in response to COVID-19 and then as 
part of a longer-term strategy for NSW Health.
Using digital solutions to enhance patient experiences 
and outcomes has become an increasing area of focus. 
The Health Outcomes and Patient Experience platform, 
delivered in partnership with the Agency for Clinical 
Innovation, is testament to this. So too is our work on the 
National Children’s Digital Health Collaborative – where 
we have harmonised and digitised the baby book.
In delivering new digital systems, keeping safety and 
security front of mind is crucial. The new incident 
management system has now been implemented across 
the state and supports increased patient safety. Our 
Information Security team continue to proactively monitor 
our systems in an ever-evolving cyber threat landscape. 
They have also developed education and training for 
NSW Health staff. 
Our strong partnerships across both the healthcare 
and technology sectors have been instrumental in all that 
we have achieved this year, as have the dedication and 
work of our staff. eHealth NSW has strived to deliver 
technology to support the health system and its workforce 
in delivering outcomes and experiences that matter 
to patients. 
Our ongoing collaboration across NSW Health, with 
government agencies and industry made it possible for 
eHealth NSW to not only support the digital response 
to COVID-19, but to also continue to digitally enable 
and transform healthcare delivery and support provision 
of services by local health districts and specialty 
health networks. 
Key achievements
•	Supported NSW Health’s digital health response to the 
pandemic, underpinned by strong collaboration across 
government agencies and with industry. eHealth NSW 
developed and implemented a digital system to fast-
track the vaccination of frontline workers in 21 business 
days. Subsequently the system was made available for 
bookings by the public. By mid-2021, it was being used 
by 64 clinics across 14 local health districts and specialty 
networks and had captured more than 675,000 
vaccination registrations. In parallel, the NSW Health 
Vaccination Administration Management system was 
developed and deployed in 10 business days providing a 
single, scalable solution to manage the entire vaccination 
administration process for staff and the public. By 
mid-2021, it had been used to book 21,863 appointments 
and vaccinate 3646 people.

•	Implemented the Electronic Record for Intensive Care, 
which is now in operation at 21 hospitals, benefiting 
28,000 patients. The electronic medication management 
program is close to completion, having now implemented 
at 199 of 200 hospitals.
•	Deployed the NSW Telestroke Service to 11 health 
facilities giving rural and regional patients access to 
high-quality specialist clinical care across NSW. More 
than 800 patients have benefited from rapid stroke 
assessment, treatment and management via the service.
•	Implemented the new Radiology Information System and 
Picture Archiving Communication System in eight hospitals 
across Nepean Blue Mountains, Northern Sydney and 
Central Coast local health districts, processing over 
500,000 imaging examinations.
•	Completed three pilots of the Health Grade Enterprise 
Network at Westmead Health Precinct, Coffs Harbour 
Hospital and 1 Reserve Road, St Leonards. The Health 
Grade Enterprise Network will replace legacy 
infrastructure to provide a more consistent and secure 
ICT network platform across the public health system.
•	Increased uptake of the myVirtualCare platform 
statewide with 3148 clinicians conducting more than 
30,000 consultations. Pilots of myVirtualCare for 
rural endocrinology services were also launched at 
Walgett Aboriginal Medical Service and Broken Hill 
District Hospital.
•	Completed the rollout of the new incident management 
system to all local health districts, specialty networks, 
health organisations, pillar organisations and private 
correctional facilities in partnership with the Clinical 
Excellence Commission.
•	Launched the Real Time Prescription Monitoring 
Management Portal in June 2021, providing the NSW 
Health regulatory team access to prescribing and 
dispensing events for monitored medicines.
•	Harmonised and digitised the baby book as part of 
the National Children’s Digital Health Collaborative as 
141 mothers and 202 newborns and children were 
involved in the trials to test and evaluate the clinical 
and consumer utility of the Child Digital Health Record.
•	Drove continued adoption of ServiceNow/SARA across 
NSW Health as our workflow and services management 
platform. It was used by staff to raise 456,000 IT 
incidents, 1,141,000 human resources cases, 106,000 
finance cases and 28,000 IT changes. The platform also 
hosted an additional 4550 knowledge articles. The SARA 
Virtual Assistant launched in August 2020, providing a 
new channel for staff to find information 24/7, on any 
device, without having to make a call. The statewide 
service desk answered 508,622 calls.
•	Analysed over 370,000 security events of which 
14,300 were validated, investigated and responded to. 
A new online reporting mechanism to make it easier 
for staff to report phishing and spam and flag potential 
cyber security risks safely was implemented as well 
as a new mandatory Cyber Fundamentals module and 
other cyber security modules and workshops for all 
NSW Health staff.

NSW Health’s 15 local health districts cover metropolitan, 
regional and rural areas across NSW, varying in both 
geographical size and population. Districts provide hospital, 
community and population-based healthcare services 
that meet the needs of their local community. 
Providing a comprehensive range of medical specialties, 
the districts deliver in-hospital care, outpatient services, 
mental health services, child and family health services, 
oral health services, Aboriginal health services, and 
drug and alcohol rehabilitation. 
This year, districts faced significant challenges from 
the extreme rainfall, floods and mice plague which directly 
impacted many, and the COVID-19 pandemic. Our 
incredible staff rose to these challenges admirably while 
continuing to provide high-quality safe care to their 
patients and communities. Read on to discover the 
achievements of districts this year and visit their websites

Year in review
Maintaining a proactive and sustained response to the 
evolving COVID-19 pandemic remained a key focus of the 
District. We opened two primary testing clinics, as well 
as an additional pop-up clinic (as required), to facilitate 
local testing to identify and stem community transmission. 
In addition to serving our local community, our Public 
Health Unit also assisted other Australian outbreak 
responses, surging large contact tracing teams and 
rapidly onboarding and training staff from other teams 
to support the effort. 
We provided advice and education to vulnerable 
populations – as well as to the broader community 
and our staff – on how to stay safe during the pandemic, 
and in March and April 2021, we opened two COVID-19 
vaccination clinics to staff and eligible groups in 
the community. 
While managing our COVID-19 response, we also 
advanced projects to enhance healthcare on the Central 
Coast. The $200 million redevelopment of Wyong Hospital 
came a step closer following completion of construction 
and the $72.5 million Central Coast Clinical School and 
Research Institute, a partnership with the University of 
Newcastle, prepared to open its doors. We also opened a 
dedicated 10-bed Palliative Care inpatient unit at Gosford 
Hospital. For the first time on the Central Coast, palliative 
and end of life care can now be offered in a hospital 
setting, not just at home.
We continued our focus on innovative ways of delivering 
patient care with the development of our virtual care 
platform. This allows clinicians to connect with patients 
and their families through virtual consultations, reducing 
the number of people attending our facilities while 
maintaining high-quality care.

A Virtual Care Hub was also established, which 
incorporates remote monitoring capabilities that enable 
patients to actively participate in their recovery and 
healthcare. With our first remote monitoring patient 
welcomed in June 2021, the Hub initially supports 
patients of the Acute Post-Acute Care and Hospital 
in the Home services. 
We supported over 350 local Aboriginal families – the 
second highest number of program participants in the 
state – through the Building Strong Foundations program, 
which helps families provide a nurturing environment for 
their child so they develop optimal physical, social, 
emotional and cultural wellbeing. We also developed a 
cultural care plan for local pregnant women and families 
as part of the Birthing Off Country project.
We thank our exceptional staff for their remarkable 
innovation and resilience in the face of such a challenging 
year and applaud their steadfast commitment to providing 
the highest standard of care to our community.
Key achievements

emergency department and intensive care unit. 
Refurbishment of some areas of the existing hospital 
began, including the expansion of operating theatres. 
•	Completed construction of the Central Coast Clinical 
School and Research Institute, a partnership between 
the District and the University of Newcastle. The six-
storey building provides state-of-the-art facilities for 
local students who wish to study medicine and nursing, 
and gives researchers access to dedicated and 
collaborative spaces to carry out world-class pioneering 
research in integrated healthcare and population health.
•	Received accreditation for three years against the 
National Safety and Quality Health Service Standards by 
the Australian Council on Healthcare Standards in May 2021.
•	Successfully trialled six new Patient Experience Officers 
at Gosford and Wyong Hospital emergency department 
waiting rooms to assist patients, carers and relatives to 
access services and de-escalate concerns.
•	Collaborated with local police to continue the Police 
Ambulance and Clinical Early Response (PACER) 
program. The initiative focuses on rehabilitation not 
incarceration, with specialist mental health clinicians 
embedded into the teams at two police districts to help

interventions, and to connect people experiencing 
mental health issues with the right support.
•	Launched an innovative nurse-led Subcutaneous 
Immunoglobulin program, where some patients with 
chronic autoimmune conditions who require regular and 
time-consuming in-hospital infusions are provided with 
infusion pumps at no cost and trained by specialised 
nurses on how to safely self-administer their treatment at 
home, decreasing hospital visits and increasing 
independence and convenience.
•	Developed a NSW-first Rapid Response Dashboard, a 
fully automated dashboard that captures and publishes

Year in review
The District continued its focus on maintaining quality 
patient care, while successfully managing our COVID-19 
response to safeguard our patients, staff and 
communities. We embarked on the delivery of COVID-19 
vaccination clinics across the District and continue those 
clinics, working in partnership with key health providers 
in the District.
NSW Health	
Annual Report 2020-21   :  NSW Health organisations  :  page 273


We continued developing alternative models of care 
using telehealth during the pandemic, and technological 
solutions have become important components in the 
District’s strategic approach to service delivery. Our use 
of telehealth increased from an average of 1282 sessions 
per month in 2019-20 to an average of 1639 sessions 
per month in 2020-21. This also translated to an increase 
in Pexip accounts from 33 to 103. 
We achieved our first-ever organisation-wide full 
accreditation with the Australian Council on Healthcare 
Standards, with all eight National Standards met. 
Our staff were exemplary in their approach to presenting 
the quality work they undertake.
Significant infrastructure milestones:
•	We officially opened the Tibooburra HealthOne 
refurbishment.
•	Buronga HealthOne facility on land leased from the 
Barkandji traditional owners progressed to awarding 
construction tender to Barpa, an Australian Indigenous 
company. Site works were earmarked to begin in July 2021. 
•	The District welcomed $30 million in funding from 
NSW Government for a new Wentworth Hospital, with 
planning to start in 2021-22. Clinical Service Planning is 
well underway to provide a service that matches 
community needs and an increasing service demand.
•	We refurbished the radiology area at Broken Hill Health 
Service to improve BreastScreen services.
•	We refurbished a wing of Medical Ward to provide 
a more home-like environment for palliative care patients 
and families.
In addition, the District is finalising its Aboriginal Workforce 
Plan, Aboriginal Health Framework and five-year Strategic 
Plan, and we increased our Aboriginal Nursing and 
Midwifery workforce, introducing three cadets.
We launched a new video (‘Welcome to the Far West’) 
to promote the District and help boost recruitment and 
retention of staff. This has improved our recruitment 
drive in the last 12 months.
A record 33 new nursing graduates joined the District 
in 2021.
We have implemented a new organisational governance 
model along with a revised executive structure to support 
the District’s strategic goals and to realise its vision of 
being an accountable best remote and rural health service.
We are pleased that the District has retained its zero 
performance rating (no performance issues) for the 
2020-21 financial year.
The Board and executive express our sincere thanks 
and appreciation to all staff for their continued hard work 
and dedication in 2020-21, which has occurred against 
a backdrop of a challenging and often rapidly changing 
environment.
Key achievements
•	Refurbished a wing of Medical Ward, Broken Hill 
Hospital, using $395,000 of NSW Ministry of Health 
funding to provide a more home-like environment for 
palliative care patients and families.
•	Welcomed three Aboriginal cadets under the NSW 
Health Aboriginal Nursing and Midwifery Cadetship 
program. The program provides financial support

•	The Far West Local Health District Mental Health Drug 
and Alcohol Service became a finalist in the 2020 NSW 
Health Awards for ‘Excellence in the Provision of Mental 
Health Services’ with The Connections Program, an 
after-hours peer-led and peer-delivered program aimed 
at reducing social isolation and loneliness of people in 
our community. The program is operated in partnership 
with Mission Australia. Preliminary data showed a direct 
link to a downwards trend of people attending the 
emergency department compared with six months after 
the program was implemented.
•	Officially launched Safe Haven Café as part of the 
Towards Zero Suicides initiative, in partnership with 
Mission Australia. It is a peer-led after-hours service 
where people who are experiencing mental health 
concerns, distress or suicidal thoughts can, where 
appropriate, go for support instead of attending an 
emergency department. The District has provided a 
purpose-built facility on hospital grounds.
•	Leased land from the traditional owners for the Buronga 
HealthOne $10 million facility build. The signing of the 
Agreement for Lease between the NSW Government, the 
District and traditional owners for use of land to build the 
facility is the first agreement of its kind nationally within 
the health sector.
•	Appointed the inaugural Far West Local Health District 
Director of Research, which is a conjoint appointment role 
with the University Department of Rural Health (University 
of Sydney). The expanded Local Health District Research 
Program will seek to encourage research capability, 
enable rural health research, and establish and promote 
a culture of research in the Far West.
•	Maintained high childhood vaccination rates, with 100 
per cent of children (Aboriginal and non-Aboriginal) being 
vaccinated by the age of six.
•	Trained 88 per cent of the District’s early childhood 
services in the Munch & Move program and met 70 per 
cent of program practices. Trained 78 per cent of District 
primary schools in the Live Life Well @ School program 
and met 70 per cent of program practices. Referrals 
by health professionals to the Get Healthy Service were 
exceeded by 136 per cent.

Year in review
This year, our District continued to deliver excellence 
in healthcare amid the demands and challenges of the 
COVID-19 pandemic.
Earlier in the pandemic, our focus was on preparing for 
the unknown, building clinical surge capacity and ensuring 
adequate personal protective equipment. During more 
recent times, we have moved our attention to vaccine 
delivery while continuing our vast screening efforts.

As the vaccine became available in 2021, we worked to 
establish six vaccination clinics across our District, 
including at Tamworth Hospital, and a major vaccination 
hub at John Hunter Hospital. We have delivered more 
than 64,000 vaccinations to date and will continue to 
focus on ensuring our most vulnerable community 
members are vaccinated. 
In June 2021, we announced the establishment of a mass 
vaccination centre at Belmont. This development took 
tremendous effort from staff and contractors and will 
enable the delivery of 20,000 vaccines each week.
While we worked hard to establish vaccination clinics, 
we also continued with our extensive screening program. 
We completed 629,687 swabs to 30 June 2021, across 
25 clinics. The high screening rates are testament to the 
work of our staff in communicating core public health 
messages.
We maintained excellent communication with our staff 
and our community throughout the pandemic to ensure 
everyone was as well informed and safe as possible. 
Amid the pandemic efforts, flooding impacted the New 
England and Mid North Coast regions within our District. 
Our staff rallied during the devastating time; many staff 
members could not get to work while others picked up 
additional hours to keep services running. Consult rooms 
at Manning Hospital were transformed into staff sleeping 
areas, and some staff who live in Taree generously opened 
their homes to colleagues who could not make it home. 
Some of our service managers and staff even volunteered 
their time at evacuation centres to help coordinate local 
responses.
Despite the challenges, staff continued to put our patients 
first with inspiring resilience and adaptability, particularly 
during the response to COVID-19. 
The Chief Executive and Executive Leadership Team 
commend the efforts of all staff across the District in 
providing positive healthcare experiences and outcomes 
for our communities.
Key achievements
•	Implemented the Sustainable Healthcare: Together 
Towards Zero 2030 initiative, to be carbon waste neutral 
by 2030. This will include the installation of solar panels 
on the rooftop of all our health facilities, including 
John Hunter Hospital where 12,000 square metres 
of roof (85 per cent) has been covered in solar panels.
•	As part of COVID-19 surgical recovery, achieved a 
reduction in the number of overdue patients on the 
surgical waitlist from 1290 in September 2020 to five 
at the end of 2020-21. 
•	Completed major infrastructure projects including:
	 -	 
the $60 million Inverell Hospital redevelopment, which 
delivered a purpose-built hospital and refurbished 
community health facility
	 -	 
the $10 million investment into the Murrurundi Health 
Service, which delivered a new health service building
	 -	 
the almost $8 million Port Stephens HealthOne 
Project, which brought together general practitioner, 
community health and hospital services into one 
purpose-built facility on the Tomaree Hospital site. 
	 In addition, planning progressed on the $780 million 
John Hunter Health and Innovation Precinct with the 
unveiling of the project’s master plan.
•	Implemented an integrated care model for trans and 
gender diverse adolescents and young adults in Northern 
NSW, including outreach services in other health 
districts. The initiative included the community-based 
Trans and Gender Diverse Centre in Newcastle.
•	Delivered the concept design for the new Banksia 
Mental Health Unit in Tamworth in partnership with staff, 
carers and consumers. The new unit will provide an 
additional eight beds supporting services for older 
persons, as well as the flexibility and provision of short-
stay accommodation for young and vulnerable people.
•	Launched a pilot study into the management of children 
with attention deficit hyperactivity disorder in the primary 
healthcare setting, including the prescribing of stimulant 
medication by general practitioners. So far, more than 
35 GPs are trained to deliver attention deficit 
hyperactivity disorder care, reducing wait times in 
outpatient clinics.
•	Implemented the Assistants in Medicine initiative, which 
saw 76 medical students (20 full-time equivalent) placed 
in our hospitals. The initiative provided opportunities for 
upskilling and workload management in response to the 
COVID-19 pandemic.
•	Began piloting the Emergency Department Did Not Wait 
strategy at 10 sites, to reduce Did Not Wait rates through 
communication within the emergency department 
waiting room explaining the triage process and the 
importance of completion of care. The project was 
initiated by Aboriginal Health in partnership with the 
emergency department stream in response to higher 
Did Not Wait rates among Aboriginal patients, but has 
been broadened to target all patients.
•	Grew Aboriginal employment rates to 5.27 per cent 
through the Good Health, Great Jobs Aboriginal 
Employment Strategy and our own Aboriginal 
Employment Strategy 2021-2025, which is currently 
being rolled out.

Year in review
The past year has continued to challenge, as we in health 
reinforce our efforts to adapt and respond to the fight 
against COVID-19. 
In the Illawarra Shoalhaven Local Health District, our focus 
has remained on strengthening preparedness. We 
upskilled staff in critical care; strengthened our protocols 
around availability and correct usage of personal 
protective equipment; and maintained a building program 
to support the ongoing response. 
This included the establishment of dedicated COVID-19 
wards and intensive care capacity, additional observation 
units and on-site storage capability, new staff amenities 
and specialised areas within emergency for the safe care 
of patients. 
All of this occurred as we continued to see increasing 
demand on our health services. While we saw a reduction 
in patient presentations to our emergency departments for 
a brief period during the height of COVID-19, our numbers 
significantly increased in the second half of the year to 
record levels. To ensure timely access to care for our 
patients, we worked in close collaboration with private 
providers to increase elective surgery, particularly for 
those unable to receive their operations due to early 
COVID-19 measures. 
The safety and wellbeing of staff was more important 
than ever before. We implemented a staff wellness 
program, known as SEED, starting at Milton Ulladulla 
Hospital. It grew to include other hospitals in the District, 
enhancing teamwork, building resilience and better 
supporting staff during challenging periods. 
The community should be incredibly proud of the District’s 
workforce. They have rallied in the face of adversity to 
continue to deliver high-quality and safe health services. 
Their hard work, drive and dedication was nothing short of 
inspirational and we thank each and every member of 
staff for their contribution over the past 12 months. 
Our District also celebrated important milestones 
including the opening of the Bulli Hospital and Aged Care 
Centre, our innovative new community health facilities 
known as HealthOne at Ulladulla and Dapto, and a much-
needed refurbishment of the Birthing Unit at Wollongong.

Planning continued on the major redevelopment of 
Shoalhaven Hospital and a preferred site for a new 
Shellharbour Hospital was identified. 
In the past few months, the District contributed to the 
national COVID-19 vaccination program and, in the first 
five weeks, our local teams administered 10,000 doses to 
essential frontline workers. 
The next 12 months will no doubt focus on bolstering 
vaccination efforts, while continuing to provide world-
class services to our local community and supporting their 
health and wellbeing. 
Key achievements
•	Strengthened the District’s online and digital platforms 
to better enable patient communications, community 
information and dedicated COVID-19 advice.
•	Launched innovative suicide prevention initiatives 
including Safe Haven – a peer-led alternative to 
attending an emergency department for people 
experiencing suicidal crisis. A Suicide Prevention 
Outreach Team was launched in Nowra to reduce deaths 
and suicide attempts by supporting people in their own 
homes.
•	Enhanced the use of virtual care and telehealth 
technology including transitioning major services to the 
myVirtualCare platform. Telestroke was also launched in 
the Shoalhaven Hospital, with the hospital holding the 
quickest time to treatment in NSW. 
•	Launched the state’s first Health Outcomes and Patient 
Experience IT platform for Patient Reported Measures. 
A Quality of Life tool was also implemented to better 
empower health staff to engage with patients in a more 
holistic way. 
•	Enhanced the District’s research capacity with the 
development of a Clinical Trials Unit. More than $8 million 
in competitive grants were awarded to District clinicians 
over the past 12 months and a total of 24 COVID-specific 
research projects were undertaken.
•	Completed an international research project in 
partnership with two universities looking at nursing and 
midwifery measures, using performance indicators 
set by consumers. The results of the Implementing 
and Measuring Person-centredness and using APP 
for Knowledge Transfer study will inform a statewide 
sustainability plan. 
•	Achieved finalist status in the Personal Injury Education 
Foundation excellence awards in the category of 
Collaboration in Injury and Disability Management.
•	Deployed a new Senior Assessment process, new 
FastTrack Model and new Short Stay Area to improve 
emergency department treatment times. Three new 
Patient Experience Officers commenced across the 
District to better support the patient experience.

Year in review
In 2020-21, the Mid North Coast Local Health District 
faced a year like no other. 
While managing the ongoing response to the global 
pandemic and recovering from the catastrophic bushfires 
that swept across the region, the Mid North Coast was 
hit by devastating floods in March 2021. 
The emergency situation and its aftermath further 
challenged the resilience of local communities. 
Healthcare workers, whose own homes had been 
inundated, went to work at the many evacuation centres 
established across the District. They provided around-the-
clock clinical and mental health support, putting their 
own recovery on hold to help others. 
The flooding coincided with the commencement of the 
Mid North Coast Local Health District’s COVID-19 
vaccination program and the establishment of vaccination 
hubs at Coffs Harbour Health Campus and Port Macquarie 
Base Hospital. 
Through the hard work and dedication of the team, the 
program was able to quickly scale up to meet demand, 
vaccinating frontline and essential workers, and then was 
expanded to include eligible community members as the 
vaccination program expanded in line with the Australian 
Government eligibility criteria. 
NSW Health	
Annual Report 2020-21   :  NSW Health organisations   :  page 278


Although the Mid North Coast had no locally acquired 
COVID-19 cases in 2020-21, testing clinics continued to 
operate across the region and have been able to rapidly 
increase capacity in response to outbreaks in other parts 
of the state. 
The Mid North Coast Local Health District continues to 
work closely with councils, police, local businesses and 
partner organisations to ensure ongoing compliance and 
education about COVID-safe practices in the community. 
The impact of COVID-19 was also felt in a very personal 
way when the smiling faces of volunteers were no longer 
seen in local hospitals and community health centres. To 
protect the community’s most vulnerable during the 
pandemic, volunteer activities were suspended for more 
than a year. 
Volunteers began returning to their roles in early 2021, 
having undertaken COVID-19 safety training and 
enthusiastically supporting the vaccination program.
Key achievements
•	Continued construction on major capital projects 
including the $194 million Coffs Harbour Health Campus 
Expansion and HealthOne facilities at Bowraville, 
Nambucca Heads and Camden Haven. 
•	Launched regional Australia’s first hospital-based 
Tresillian Residential Unit at Macksville District Hospital. 
This important partnership with Tresillian provides a 
service to assist local families struggling with the 
demands of parenting. 
•	Continued the District’s comprehensive response to the 
COVID-19 pandemic, which included establishing a 
large-scale drive-through clinic at Port Macquarie to 
increase capacity in response to outbreaks in other parts 
of the state. 
•	Developed and implemented an Aboriginal Cultural 
Engagement Self-Assessment Tool to ensure the delivery 
of culturally safe and accessible health services for 
Aboriginal patients and clients as part of the District’s 
Aboriginal Cultural Safety and Security Framework. 
Audit sessions were held with all directorates to look at 
ways to improve inclusivity and Aboriginal cultural safety 
within current practices. 
•	Developed and implemented a Midwifery Group Practice 
service for Coffs Harbour and Macksville hospitals. The 
District joins other regional NSW local health districts in 
the provision of best practice maternity care, including 
post-natal home visits by a midwife. 
•	Achieved two awards in the 2020 NSW Health Nursing 
and Midwifery Awards. Trauma Clinical Nurse Consultant, 
Trish Lemin, was named joint winner of the Nurse of the 
Year, and Mid North Coast Cancer Institute Nurse Unit 
Manager, Amelia Bolt, received the Aboriginal Nurse/
Midwife of the Year award.
•	Implemented the Health Grade Enterprise Network 
initiative to provide improved Wi-Fi performance for staff, 
patients and visitors thanks to a major upgrade of 
wireless network infrastructure. Coffs Harbour Health 
Campus was the first regional health facility to roll out 
the initiative. 
•	Presented the Your Health Link National Photographic 
Competition as a virtual event, receiving a record 1833 
entries from every state and territory in Australia. The 
photo competition is part of the broader suite of Your 
Health Link programs designed to connect the 
community to evidence-based health information. 
•	Celebrated the achievements of staff and volunteers at

Year in review
The Murrumbidgee Local Health District strives to deliver 
exceptional rural healthcare for our communities while 
improving access to care across our region. 
The health response to COVID-19 continued to be a priority 
and Murrumbidgee staff rose to the challenge of keeping 
our communities safe, undertaking pandemic-related work 
and sustaining services. 
Our COVID-19 team responded to the changing 
environment, providing contact tracing and public health 
services, establishing testing and vaccination clinics, 
adapting clinical services to virtual care models, and 
configuring hospitals and community services to care for 
COVID-19 patients. 
During this time, our commitment to safety and improving 
consumers’ experience did not waiver. Clinical leaders in 
infection prevention enhanced our respiratory protection 
program to ensure staff safety. We started collecting 
patient-reported experience and outcome measures to 
help us better understand patient individual needs and 
improve their outcomes. 
Our surgical teams fast-tracked elective surgery, which 
was unavoidably delayed following the National Cabinet 
decision to suspend non-urgent surgery due to the 
pandemic. This led to the highest number of elective 
surgeries ever performed from January to June. 
To understand our workforce and the lessons learnt during 
this time of rapid change, we undertook pulse checks with 
staff, enabling a consolidation of our learnings and 
experiences, to plan for future enhancements. 
Bushfire recovery supports continued across fire-affected 
regions, with clinicians actively making connections in

NSW Health	
Annual Report 2020-21   :  NSW Health organisations   :  page 280


A close collaboration with local Aboriginal communities 
developed strong local models for culturally safe care. We 
partnered with the Brungle community in Tumut and the 
local Aboriginal community in Deniliquin to listen and 
establish localised solutions that will improve outcomes 
for Aboriginal people. 
Several significant building projects continue within the 
District. Work continues on the Griffith Base Hospital 
Redevelopment site, construction began on the Hay 
Health Service Redevelopment in November 2020, and the 
new Tumut Hospital is due for completion in late 2021.
Key achievements
•	Launched the Murrumbidgee Rural Generalist Training 
Pathway, a locally developed training program for rural 
generalist doctors to boost the rural doctor workforce. 
The single employment model allows for seamless 
transition between hospital and community-based 
training placements for trainee GPs.
•	Implemented the Safe Wards program, an initiative 
designed to support consumers in the acute mental 
health setting by enhancing staff’s management of 
conflict. The program engages people with lived experience 
of mental health drawing on personal experience to 
educate staff, ultimately improving services and 
experiences of others.
•	Stroke Unit was awarded the prestigious World Stroke 
Organization’s Angels Gold Status in November 2020. 
Wagga Wagga Base Hospital was recognised for meeting 
the highest standards in stroke treatment, indicating that 
more than 50 per cent of stroke patients receive time-
critical care within 60 minutes of presenting to hospital. It 
was the first Australian hospital to achieve gold status.
•	Opened Wagga Wagga Health Service Hub, the third and 
final stage at the centre of the $431 million Wagga 
Wagga Base Hospital Redevelopment. Sixty health 
services were relocated into the new building. This 
included an expansion to the Wagga Wagga Base 
Hospital Renal Unit, providing extra dialysis chairs and 
doubling the home training unit to support education for 
consumers undertaking home dialysis.
•	Launched the new Health and Arts Outreach Program, an 
innovative program providing aged care residents access 
to a quality arts engagement experience, piloted in 
partnership with Art Gallery of NSW and Health 
Infrastructure. The program has a social and cultural 
approach, providing a meaningful way for aged care 
residents to connect with others, particularly during 
periods of isolation due to the COVID-19 pandemic.
•	Piloted a multi-agency Health Expo for the community of 
Brungle, a holistic health day linking the Brungle 
Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander community with 
internal and external outreach programs. The event 
aimed to improve health outcomes and boost community 
engagement, rebuilding rapport and trust between 
facilities, services and the community while addressing 
the ongoing holistic health and support needs of the 
community and surrounding areas.
•	Day-only hip surgery began at Wagga Wagga Base 
Hospital. The first of its kind in the region, it enabled 
patients a short stay in hospital for hip replacements. 
Recovery is aided with a short-acting spinal anaesthetic 
drug, allowing people to mobilise quickly. They are often 
up and walking four hours after surgery. Since it began in 
July 2020, patients have reported positive experiences 
and outcomes.
•	Launched the Murrumbidgee Collaborative 
Commissioning Initiative in partnership with the 
Murrumbidgee Primary Health Network, aiming to 
collaborate with patients, clinicians and communities to 
improve quality and demonstrate value in the care we 
deliver for people with chronic obstructive pulmonary 
disease and congestive heart failure.
•	Released our Patient, Carer and Consumer Experience 
and Participation Framework, with the aim of improving 
people’s experience in our care. Some initiatives included:
	 - 
Patient Experience Officers and feedback kiosks 
trialled in emergency departments, with extremely 
positive feedback
	 - 
the launch of the Patient Reported Outcome Measures 
program, with patients using electronic devices to record 
what matters to them, and data used to inform health 
discussions and individual healthcare plans with patients
	 - 
Mental Health, Drug and Alcohol Lived Experiences 
Platform, which was created to give people with a lived 
experience opportunities to share experiences, ideas 
and feedback to help shape and improve services for 
their community. See https://mhdaexperiences.com.au.
•	NSW Health Nurse of the Year Award awarded to Keiran 
Preston from Wagga Wagga Mental Health Unit. Keiran 
was announced as joint winner of the 2020 award at the 
NSW Health Excellence in Nursing and Midwifery 
Awards in November 2020. Passionate about nursing 
care and non-judgemental in his interactions with 
consumers, Keiran is most recognised and appreciated 
for his empathy for others.

Year in review
Our commitment to keeping our community safe and 
healthy has not wavered despite a difficult year in our fight 
against COVID-19.
We welcomed the opening of the Nepean COVID-19 
Vaccination Clinic, offering a level of protection in our 
community to ensure we can remain safe as the pandemic 
continues. 
With extreme weather continuing to affect our region, 
we supported residents in the Hawkesbury and Nepean 
area when a one-in-30-year devastating flood restricted 
access to essential services. Our response ensured areas 
continued to have access to medical assistance, safe 
transfer to hospital and medicines. 
The District’s strong relationship with the local Aboriginal 
community was highlighted with the unveiling of a 
dedicated World War I memorial at Blue Mountains District 
ANZAC Memorial Hospital. The names of 35 Darug and 
Gundungurra soldiers take pride of place at the entrance 
to the hospital and remind our community of the role these 
soldiers had in our community and Country.
As part of a strong partnership, three senior mental health 
clinicians worked alongside first responders as part of the 
Police Ambulance and Clinical Early Response (PACER) 
teams in the Nepean area. The roles have reduced the 
number of emergency department presentations, 
improved mental health outcomes for affected individuals, 
and reduced stigma across the area.
For complex pregnancies, our participation in the Maternal 
Transfer Redesign Initiative has meant families have 
access to obstetric and neonatal expertise across our own 
and Western NSW Local Health District when experiencing 
complications during their pregnancy. We also increased 
our ability to deliver quality healthcare to people with 
intellectual disability.
We continued to embrace digital technology to provide 
safe and high-quality care through our telehealth service. 
Our new online surgery booking system has also enabled 
better decision making and information flow across the 
whole elective surgery journey.
A redesign of our care models has delivered dramatic 
improvements in Nepean Hospital’s Ear, Nose and Throat 
service, with access improved following a reduction in 
wait times.

We have also recognised the important role creative 
arts can play in wellbeing and healing. Our renal dialysis 
and palliative care teams have introduced art and music 
therapy programs to encourage patients to take charge 
of their rehabilitation through creative expression, which 
has been well received by patients and their families.
Our committed and hardworking staff, volunteers, 
community, consumers and advocates have our heartfelt 
thanks for making these achievements possible.
Key achievements
•	Supported the public health response to localised 
flooding incidents in the region, including the provision 
of pathology, palliative care, pharmaceuticals and 
essential supplies for residential aged care facilities, safe 
transfer of patients, and deployment of mental health 
staff. Public health safety and hygiene information was 
distributed to the community to caution those in 
floodwaters and as recovery efforts started.
•	Implemented a safe and effective COVID-19 vaccination 
program for our staff and the community with almost 
15,000 vaccinations having been administered since the 
clinic opened in April.
•	Began an initiative to jointly manage mental health 
emergencies as part of a $6.1 million investment by 
NSW Government to establish Police Ambulance and 
Clinical Early Response (PACER) teams across NSW.
•	Employed a Specialist Intellectual Disability Clinician 
to provide care to people with an intellectual disability 
across the District. It is one of only nine such roles 
across NSW.
•	Supported better connectivity between patients and 
clinicians with 214,488 telehealth occasions of service 
throughout the period.
•	Since the introduction of the online surgery booking 
system, 2915 requests for admission have been entered. 
The system automatically recommends an operation 
date as a surgery is added to the waitlist and patients 
can be automatically referred to outpatient services 
at the start of their surgery journey. 
•	Achieved a 60 per cent reduction in waitlist times as a 
result of the comprehensive redesign of the Nepean 
Hospital Ear, Nose and Throat clinic, and in 90 per cent 
of cases, patients were referred, screened and triaged 
within five days.

Year in review
Responding to the COVID-19 pandemic was a large focus 
of our health district throughout 2020-21. 
As case numbers grew throughout the middle of 2020, 
our COVID-19 response team collaborated with staff 
groups and external organisations to lead our community 
and our health service through the difficulties presented 
by the pandemic. 
We held weekly meetings with police, NSW Ambulance, 
local councils, primary health partners, Aboriginal 
Medical Services, universities and infectious disease 
specialists to stay connected and respond to new 
challenges as they arose. 
Weekly personal protective equipment governance 
meetings were held with clinicians and managers to review 
and discuss personal protective equipment supply issues.
Our COVID-19 Operational Planning and Policy 
Governance Committee provided oversight, coordination 
and endorsement of all planning activities (clinical, welfare 
and workforce) and related documentation to support the 
District’s response to the pandemic. It also worked to 
oversee the development and approval of COVID-related 
internal policy, procedure and guidelines and to endorse 
any workforce changes and strategies.

Annual Report 2020-21   :  NSW Health organisations  :  page 283


These challenges included responding to workforce 
and medical access issues arising from border closures, 
ensuring our hospitals and health facilities were 
adhering to strict infection prevention protocols, 
developing technical solutions to support the patient-
focused activities, supporting businesses and industry 
with public health advice and resources around 
restrictions and COVID-safe practices, and keeping 
our community informed. 
When COVID-19 vaccines became available in early 2021, 
we mobilised new vaccination clinics to provide 
vaccinations to the priority groups in our District, including 
setting up the first shopping centre-based vaccination 
clinic in the state, an innovative approach designed to 
encourage and reinforce the importance of vaccination 
in an accessible and public place. 
Training and expanding our workforce to have the skills 
needed to keep themselves and our community safe was 
a key part of our District’s pandemic response. 
We recruited 62 additional nursing staff to assist with 
workload and additional requirements brought on by 
COVID-19. Our mental health directorate led the District’s 
Staff Wellbeing response, conducting sessions, 
consultation and workshops with staff groups directly 
impacted by COVID-19. 
We developed a supportive skills program for nurses and 
midwives to strengthen the ability of staff to surge in 
essential services both during COVID-19 and at other 
times. Also, 265 staff attended surge training in intensive 
care, emergency and immunisation specialties using 
the Qstream platform, which delivered learning/questions 
via mobile at timed intervals throughout the program 
duration. The training involved multi-media learning and 
scenario-based questions, with 98 per cent proficiency 
improvements across the three areas.
Physiotherapists were also supported with a new training 
package to prepare them in the event they were required 
to work in intensive care. This included self-directed 
learning modules, practical training in intensive care units 
and simulation training. Forty-six physiotherapists from 
across the District completed this training.
Workforce units assisted frontline workers to deliver the 
vaccine rollout by identifying program phases and priority 
groups for staff vaccinations, and developed new policies 
and procedures to support staff to work from home in 
line with the public health orders. 
About 200 additional staff were recruited across clinical 
and non-clinical disciplines, supported by workforce 
teams to ensure onboarding and orientation requirements 
could be met in a business-as-usual environment.

The Lismore Base Hospital Stage 3c redevelopments 
began in February 2021, marking the final stage in the 
$312.8 million redevelopment. 
The NSW Telestroke Service was implemented at our 
hospitals in Lismore, Tweed and Grafton, providing 
regional patients with life-saving access to expert stroke 
care to improve clinical outcomes. 
Throughout this challenging year, our staff have worked 
incredibly hard to overcome obstacles and adapt to the 
changes imposed on both their working and personal lives 
as a result of the pandemic. They have responded with 
resilience, leadership and compassion, and we thank them 
for their unending commitment to providing excellent 
patient-focused care to our community and to each other.
Key achievements
•	Rolled out the IDose Iris Scanner System across 
four Opioid Treatment Program sites, resulting in a 
50 per cent reduction in medication errors and 
medication spillages.
•	Set up the Homeless Health Outreach Team for the 
Tweed/Byron area, improving linkages and engagement 
to mental health services for individuals, community, 
government and non-government agencies to provide 
access to treatment, care and transition-to-housing 
services. So far, more than 100 referrals have been 
received, and a client list of about 50 consumers has 
been established. 
•	Implemented changes to reduce patient falls resulting in 
serious injury from 0.5/1000 bed days to 0.4/1000 bed 
days, and to reduce hospital-acquired pressure injuries 
from 0.08/1000 bed days to 0.05/1000 bed days. 
Initiatives included improved night lighting, post-fall 
huddles, falls management plan improvements in eMR, 
falls prevention training, District-wide changes to linen 
use, and equipment reviews. 
•	Improved the safety culture by supporting staff and 
managers to address safety risks of patient and visitor 
behaviours through strategy, procedure and processes to 
ensure a consistent approach when managing 
unacceptable behaviour of patients and visitors in our 
healthcare settings. 
•	Conducted a longitudinal, mixed-methods research 
study to assess development, resource and support 
needs of Midwifery Unit Managers and Nursing Unit 
Managers. The research led to the creation of the 
Leading Edge Assessment Program and leadership 
development framework to support Midwifery and 
Nursing Unit Managers to deliver positive patient 
outcomes, organisational goals, culture and staff 
engagement in their teams. Managers then created 
individualised learning plans to meet their needs. 
•	Maintained high rates of referral to the Get Healthy 
phone coaching service, with 617 people, including 
573 pregnant women, referred to help them achieve a 
healthier lifestyle (twice the target set by the NSW 
Ministry of Health). Health promotion staff worked with 
over 90 per cent of early childhood centres and 80 per 
cent of schools to deliver healthy eating and physical 
activity programs to meet the target outcomes set 
by the Ministry.
•	Piloted the Service Registration Assist program, in 
which medical practice records can be updated centrally 
through a single, secure system, ensuring other 
healthcare providers have their correct contact details 
and practice information. Before the pilot, three per cent 
of electronic discharge summaries were undeliverable 
from the District to participating general practitioners 
and medical practices due to missing information, and 
10 per cent had invalid or missing identifiers. During the 
pilot, 100 per cent of electronic discharge summaries 
were delivered, and the project is now being rolled out 
nationally, led by the Australian Digital Health Agency.
•	Piloted same-day hip and knee surgery at Grafton Base 
Hospital, enabling patients to have major surgery and 
return home the same day where clinically appropriate. 
Patients receive pre-operative physiotherapy and 
education, and are up and moving three to four hours after 
surgery, under the care of allied health and nursing teams. 
Twelve patients were selected for the pilot, with a 100 per 
cent same-day successful discharge rate and no 
complications. Patient satisfaction was rated nine out of 10.
•	Funded nation-first research into the feasibility of the 
Optimul assay in diagnosis of platelet function disorders 
in a regional setting, with the aim of improving the care of 
patients with undiagnosed bleeding disorders in regional 
Australia. Results from research studies conducted in 
Lismore and Sydney will be submitted for publication in a 
national peer-reviewed journal. 
•	Improved regionally based training opportunities for local 
junior doctors in the Richmond Network through 
partnerships with the Northern NSW Regional Training 
Hub, University of Sydney Rural Clinical School, specialist 
colleges and NSW and federal health departments. 
Increased opportunities now exist in specialties including 
emergency medicine (90 per cent of training now 
available locally, up from 20 per cent in 2014), general 
practitioner training (100 per cent of training now 
available locally), and General Practitioner Advanced 
Training Skills in emergency medicine, obstetrics, 
paediatrics, critical care and rehabilitation. Locally 
available anaesthetics and basic physician training are 
now at 60 per cent. Eighty per cent of doctors who 
complete their internship at Lismore Base Hospital 
now stay in the region beyond postgraduate year three, 
working in hospital or general practitioner settings.

Year in review
The COVID-19 pandemic continued to be a focus for our 
health district and amidst the unprecedented challenges, 
our staff came together to lead a monumental response 
to manage the COVID-19 pandemic while still delivering 
high-quality safe care to our patients.
Our District led a rapid public health response to 
COVID-19 exposure at Ryde Hospital and also to the 
Avalon COVID-19 cluster – which saw some of the highest 
testing rates in the state leading to the containment 
of the outbreak. 
Efforts were also turned to the mass vaccination 
program by rapidly setting up vaccination clinics at 
Hornsby, Royal North Shore and Mona Vale hospitals.
We strengthened technologies such as telehealth to 
transform our services beyond COVID-19 to better serve 
our patients.
As we expanded our infrastructure, Hornsby Ku-ring-gai 
Hospital became the first public hospital in Australia to 
open a robotic pharmacy as part of a $265 million 
redevelopment. The centrepiece of the redevelopment, 
the six-storey clinical services building, opened featuring 
a helipad, a specially designed dementia and delirium 
ward and a new rehabilitation department. 
Planning is also underway for the $479 million 
redevelopment of Ryde Hospital. Our transformation 
of Mona Vale Hospital has continued with the opening of 
its palliative care unit and geriatric rehabilitation unit. 
Construction also started on Australia’s first adolescent 
and young adult hospice at the former Manly Hospital site.
The achievements of our staff were acknowledged 
at the NSW Health Awards with two nominations receiving 
top honours.
Our District also embarked on a planetary health project, 
taking a holistic approach to our healthcare system 
and how we can care for the health of our planet and 
our local community. 
In what was another challenging year, which reinforced 
the skill of our health system, it was a pleasure to be 
a part of it. I would like to thank our hardworking staff, 
volunteers, patients and community for contributing 
to these wonderful achievements.

assistance as staff faced unprecedented challenges.
•	Developed the District’s first Diversity and Inclusion 
framework to support and empower our workforce. 
The aim was to reflect the diverse community served 
and create a place where all our staff felt their skills, 
perspectives and experiences were embraced and 
celebrated. We also developed a dedicated Diversity, 
Inclusion and Belonging Strategy, a number of employee 
networks which are led by our staff, and a Diversity, 
Inclusion and Belonging Council which meets regularly 
to discuss our progress on the strategy and targeted 
initiatives.
•	Established the first Planetary Health Committee to ensure 
our hospitals and services are more environmentally 
conscious and sustainable. Driven by our staff, the 
committee began devising ways for workplaces to become 
more environmentally friendly and lead to better practices.

It has been an exciting and challenging year for our health 
district as we steadily navigated our way through the 
COVID-19 pandemic. I thank our staff who have rapidly 
transitioned to the use of telehealth technologies and for 
their flexible and innovative approach to ensure patients 
continue to receive the best care.
More than 227,000 people attended emergency 
departments across the District in 2020-21. More than 
36,000 surgeries were performed, and there were 
more than 196,000 admissions and over 8200 babies 
delivered at the Royal Hospital for Women, St George 
and Sutherland hospitals.
Our District published the Journey to Excellence Strategy 
2018-21 three years ago, placing people at the centre of 
the delivery of care to our community. 
NSW Health	
Annual Report 2020-21   :  NSW Health organisations  :  page 287


We are now embarking on a new strategy to guide the way 
we deliver healthcare over the coming years which will 
build on our achievements from the Journey to Excellence 
and respond to the challenges facing today’s clinicians, 
leaders and patients. It has been developed in partnership 
with our staff, consumers and community members 
reinforcing the need to prioritise equitable, compassionate 
and person-centred care.
Our hospitals faced a significant challenge of managing 
increased waitlists following the suspension of non-urgent 
elective surgery by the federal government due to the 
COVID-19 pandemic. During the year, staff across the 
District worked tirelessly to provide patients whose 
surgery had been delayed with timely access to care. 
In 2020-21, more than 24,000 patients had their elective 
surgery, a 27 per cent increase, or more than 5200 
additional patients compared with the previous financial 
year, with more than 3000 patients receiving their surgery 
through collaborative arrangements with the private 
health sector.
We launched our Addressing Racism Strategy, Racism 
Harms: Act on It, with the campaign including a number 
of resources to support the District’s managers and staff 
to have conversations about racism, and to act on it.
Several new services were also launched in 2020-21 
across the District, including a 12-chair Kogarah 
Community Dental Clinic, SafeHaven in Kogarah to assist 
people to develop self-management skills to maintain their 
mental health and the Suicide Prevention Outreach Team 
at Sutherland Hospital, a service that supports people 
in the community.
We celebrated some key milestones this year, including: 
50 years of pioneering treatment at Prince of Wales 
Hospital’s Hyperbaric Unit, the 10-year anniversary of the 
Narrangy-Borris Strong Foundations Aboriginal Child 
and Family Health Service at Menai and the topping out 
ceremony to mark the Prince of Wales Hospital’s new 
Integrated Acute Services Building reaching the highest 
point in its construction.
Thanks to our frontline and support staff who continue 
to provide safe, quality healthcare and essential services 
to our community during the COVID-19 pandemic and 
our volunteers and foundations who support us to deliver 
these services.

Year in review
Through the evolving COVID-19 pandemic, our staff have 
provided outstanding care to our community. Their 
dedication and teamwork has been truly inspirational.
From the COVID-19 cluster in Casula to the opening 
of the Liverpool Vaccination Clinic, our District has 
responded with exceptional commitment to keeping our 
patients, consumers and community safe. We conducted 
243,512 COVID-19 tests in drive-through, pop-up and 
hospital clinics across our region – an incredible effort 
from our team.
The new year brought new hope in the fight against 
COVID-19 with the opening of the Liverpool Vaccination 
Clinic. Our frontline staff were among the first to be 
immunised before we extended the protection of 
vaccination to the rest of our workforce, essential workers 
and the community. We conducted over 72,000 vaccinations 
in our District and as well as in country areas. I am immensely 
proud of the dedication of our staff and thank them 
for their excellent work.
The District’s Transforming Your Experience Strategy provided 
support and reassurance for our staff with risk huddles 
and leader rounding now embedded into our practice. 
NSW Health	
Annual Report 2020-21   :  NSW Health organisations  :  page 289


Through the introduction of quality-focused programs, 
the Improvement Science Learning Pathways and Mental 
Health Pathways in Practice, we continued to empower 
our staff to improve their skills.
The development of our One Service Multiple Sites 
strategy has provided a seamless network of services 
across the District’s care. It is delivering a healthcare 
system of the future, an important priority of the District’s 
Strategic Plan 2018-2021. Two District research projects 
also received NSW Health COVID-19 grants to explore 
virtual models of care in childhood development and 
intensive care, highlighting our commitment to the plan’s 
strategic direction of research leadership.
The District’s $3 billion hospital redevelopment projects 
achieved significant milestones. We celebrated the 
completion of stage one of the $68.7 million Bowral & 
District Hospital redevelopment and the $25 million 
emergency department extension at Bankstown-
Lidcombe Hospital. Both projects have brought world-
class facilities to their communities. The $632 million 
stage two Campbelltown Hospital redevelopment reached 
its highest point of construction, early works started on 
the $740 million Liverpool Health and Academic Precinct 
and planning is well underway for the new $1.3 billion 
Bankstown-Lidcombe Hospital.
It’s been an amazing year of progress and achievement for 
our District and I am incredibly proud of our staff as they 
provide outstanding care to our community, not only 
through the challenges of the pandemic, but every day.

Year in review
Renewal was the main theme for our community and 
staff at Southern NSW Local Health District this year. 
The District is recovering from the significant impact 
of bushfires, drought and floods, while the challenges 
of the COVID-19 pandemic continue. 
Several significant organisational changes were 
implemented over the last year to improve efficiency, 
collaboration and workplace culture, which included:
•	finalisation of a four-year business restructure
•	establishment of the Elevate workplace culture and 
leadership framework
•	creation of the Coastal, Monaro and Tablelands networks 
to align health services into geographical clusters
•	development of strategic and operational plans for 
2021-2026.
Our District recognises the extraordinary work of the 
Public Health and COVID-19 planning, screening, testing 
and vaccination teams this year. Our teams managed 
complex and changing border arrangements with the 
Australian Capital Territory and Victorian governments, 
airlines and shipping. Southern NSW testing clinics 
performed 82,644 COVID-19 tests in 2020-21 and there 
were 25 confirmed cases of COVID-19 in the Southern 
NSW Local Health District.
Key achievements
•	Introduced quantitative fibronectin testing by the 
Nursing and Midwifery Directorate, across maternity 
services to improve safety and reduce unnecessary 
transfers to tertiary facilities. The testing enables 
clinicians to predict the likelihood of preterm birth 
occurring within seven days of testing. As a result, there 
was a 97 per cent reduction of women with threatened 
preterm labour needing to be transferred.
•	Developed a GradStart program at Goulburn Hospital 
and Mental Health Inpatient Unit, which supports new 
graduate nurses to become highly skilled in both General 
and Mental Health Nursing.

•	Created the Quit4Bub project to research smoking in 
pregnancy. Population Health examined if smoking 
cessation during the second half of pregnancy could 
prevent low birth weight babies. Based on Phase 1 
research of the project, it was hypothesised that women 
who received smoking cessation enhanced brief 
intervention during pregnancy would quit smoking in the 
second half of pregnancy compared with those who 
received usual smoking cessation care.
•	Implemented the No Wrong Door initiative to improve the 
care of mental health patients who presented at Queanbeyan 
Hospital. The Queanbeyan Hospital Emergency Department 
and Community Mental Health Drug and Alcohol team’s 
program helped to increase the number of patients 
diagnosed with mental health-related concerns to be 
seen by mental health services prior to discharge.
•	Supported the healing of the local Bega Valley and 
Eurobodalla Aboriginal people following the fires and 
fostered interagency collaboration through the project, 
See the country recover through the eyes of the Yuin 
People. The project aimed to explore and understand the 
impact of the Black Summer fires on Aboriginal people 
and their lands, and how we can walk together on the 
journey called recovery. 
•	Created an online platform to make maternity-specific 
information easily accessible to consumers and reduce 
paperwork. Queanbeyan Hospital’s Maternity Service’s 
new platform was well received by patients who 
commented on the improved communication with the 
service and a significant reduction in administration time.
•	Delivered two projects as part of the NSW Government’s 
$297 million Multipurpose Service program:
	 -	 
completed the Braidwood Multipurpose Service project 
in September 2020, which features health services 
co-located under one roof; in-patient rooms designed 
according to latest models of care requirements; a 
purpose-built facility delivering therapeutic benefits 
for patients and visitors; 37 single room residential 
aged care beds with multiple activity rooms, and 
shared lounge and dining facilities; acute care beds; 
an emergency department with dedicated ambulance 
entry and X-ray services 
	 -	 
delivered the main works stage for the $8 million Yass 
Hospital Redevelopment project in September 2020. 
Construction of the new emergency department was 
completed in June 2020 and the department 
commenced operations in July 2020. The redeveloped 
health facility includes 24-hour access to emergency 
care, an additional emergency department treatment 
bay, dedicated ambulance entry point, patient beds 
increased from 10 to 12, improved community and allied 
health facilities and ongoing access to X-ray services. 
The redeveloped health facility also includes a heritage 
timeline detailing the history of Yass District Hospital.
•	Expanded the reach of the Cardiac Rehabilitation 
Program as Eurobodalla Cardiac Rehabilitation launched 
a telehealth project and new model of care to include 
home-based options for cardiac rehabilitation clients as 
an alternative to traditional gym-based group sessions. 
It allowed continuity of service during the COVID-19 
pandemic and also improved patient outcomes compared 
with non-pandemic years.
•	Recruited a temporary for seclusion and restraint 
reduction in November 2020. This role was created to 
implement the Six Core Strategies for Seclusion and 
Restraint Reduction across the mental health inpatient 
units and five declared emergency departments. 
A service-based seclusion and restraint reduction plan 
was developed and sensory modulation rooms were 
opened in our two acute mental health inpatient units. 
A clinical redesign project using redesign methodology 
(in conjunction with the Agency for Clinical Innovation) 
has commenced, which will support our emergency 
departments to identify solutions for change and support 
the reduction of seclusion and restraint in these spaces.
•	Achieved all 14 Hospital Acquired Complications targets 
for 2020-21 and commenced implementation of the 
Patient Reported Measures Program with a rollout 
schedule planned for 2021.

Year in review
Twelve months into the COVID-19 response in NSW, the 
opening of the NSW Health Vaccination Centre – RPA 
Hospital in February brought hope and joy for our staff. It 
was a major milestone in the pandemic and provided further 
reassurance to those working in our border and quarantine 
programs, critical care areas and those in our flying squads 
and testing clinics. 
Within months our District had an instrumental role in further 
amplifying the state’s vaccination program. A clinic was 
set up at Sydney Airport and the state’s first mass 
vaccination centre opened at Sydney Olympic Park.
The NSW Health Vaccination Centre was initially 
established with capacity to vaccinate 5000 people every 
day. Establishing it required the collaboration of hundreds 
of staff from engineering, ICT and communication, to 
workforce, administration and training, as well as clinicians 
and staff required for everyday operations including 
doctors, nurses, pharmacy and other clinical staff, 
cleaners and security, students, and partners from 
government and industry. 
The model and design has since been utilised in other 
vaccination centres across the state. By end June 2021, 
the centre’s daily capacity had doubled to 10,000 and 
almost 400,000 people had been vaccinated at the three 
Sydney Local Health District sites. 
Our hospitals, Special Health Accommodation and RPA 
Virtual Hospital continued to care for community members 
who needed additional support, for people with COVID-19 
and for returning travellers who needed additional care or 
who became unwell. 
Since its launch as the state’s first virtual hospital in 
February 2020, rpavirtual has had a critical role in the 
state’s COVID-19 response. In 2020-21 alone, we delivered 
virtual care to almost 18,700 patients, including 1780 
COVID-19-positive patients and more than 11,000 in 
Special Health Accommodation. 
It was estimated that together the services have helped to 
avoid more than 700 hospital admissions. rpavirtual won 
the Premier’s Award for excellence in digital innovation.

We heightened measures to stop the spread of COVID-19. 
Our ICT service designed, built and supported the 
implementation of daily saliva testing for around 3500 
quarantine and frontline staff at more than 24 sites. More 
than 67,000 virtual meetings or telehealth sessions were 
held. We tested more than a million people for COVID-19 
at locations across Sydney, at times testing more than 
4750 people in a single day. Our Public Health Unit 
managed over 4000 contacts and has surged as needed 
for contact tracing, surveillance and to inform decision 
making. We continued to support vulnerable people in our 
community with COVID-19 testing, vaccination, meal, 
welfare and other outreach services. 
There were more than 3.1 million people cared for in our 
outpatient services in 2020-21, almost 165,000 people 
attended our emergency departments and there were 
over 165,000 admissions and discharges at our hospitals. 
Over 30,000 surgeries were performed in our hospitals 
and more than 6000 babies were born at Royal Prince 
Alfred and Canterbury hospitals.
Our Community Health Services delivered care to nearly 
39,500 clients at our service locations and more than 11,000 
services were delivered in people’s homes. We also provided 
care to almost 40,000 children, tested the vision of 1100 
children and offered 3300 talking and listening checks. 
The Sydney Health Care Interpreter Service received 
69,752 requests and spent almost 43,000 hours 
interpreting for patients and their loved ones. 
We continued to focus on excellence in healthcare for all, 
launching Australia’s first total body PET-CT scanner at 
Royal Prince Alfred Hospital, offering new opportunities to 
treat patients with cancer, neurological conditions and 
heart disease. The $341 million redevelopment of Concord 
Hospital reached a significant milestone, with the new 
clinical services building reaching its highest point. 
We opened Fussell House, a new residential facility to 
support the National Centre for Veterans’ Healthcare at 
Concord Hospital, and spent $6.5 million on the 
Canterbury Hospital Emergency Department upgrade. 
During NAIDOC Week, we officially opened the revamped 
Sister Alison Bush Lounge at Royal Prince Alfred Hospital, 
named in honour of one of the state’s longest serving 
and most influential midwives. We also celebrated the 
announcement by the NSW Government that the $750 
million redevelopment of Royal Prince Alfred Hospital 
would be fast-tracked as a key investment in health 
infrastructure in NSW.
The last 18 months have required an indescribable resolve. 
What staff working in our health service have faced, found 
solutions for, and managed to overcome during 2020-21 
is extraordinary. But, every day during this pandemic, staff 
have stepped forward to say ‘I can help’. I am so proud to 
work alongside them and so very grateful for the work 
they do. Our team has been strengthened by new and 
existing partnerships – including other government 
agencies (especially the NSW Police), non-government 
organisations and private businesses. I would also like to 
thank our community for their support during this time.

Year in review
It has been another challenging year for our health system. 
Our communities have been relentlessly tested but 
continue to demonstrate resilience, courage and strength. 
As a community, we are feeling the fatigue associated 
with the pandemic. We enter a stage of recovery from the 
drought but now face the detrimental impacts of the 
mouse plague.

Despite the ongoing challenges, we continue to adapt to 
working and living in a pandemic. Our healthcare team has 
reached a point of substantial maturity with managing the 
challenges of COVID-19. We have established culturally 
appropriate communication strategies, workforce 
contingency measures including surge planning and 
emergency response teams to ensure continuity of care. 
We have tested more than 130,000 people and continue to 
work with the community and service providers to support 
and expand on the vaccine rollout in rural and remote 
communities. 
As part of our commitment to provide sustainable 
healthcare closer to home, we continue to build on 
innovative technology solutions for remote and virtual 
care. We have implemented the statewide Telestroke 
Service, the District-wide pharmacy service incorporating 
virtual pharmacy, established a virtual Mental Health Drug 
and Alcohol team and piloted a virtual mental health 
emergency service.
We have managed the pressures of the pandemic while 
simultaneously managing the significant increase in the 
demand for services. Surgeries performed in the District 
have grown by more than 10 per cent in 2020-21 compared 
with the previous year, emergency attendances were up 
by almost 24 per cent and we have had a nine per cent 
increase in babies being born in our facilities.
The health and wellbeing of Aboriginal people remains a 
priority. We continue to implement and deliver a range of 
workforce strategies. We have introduced Aboriginal and 
Torres Strait Islander targeting for all recruitment, and 
have established an Aboriginal Workforce Training 
Coordinator to oversee and implement training and 
development initiatives. 
We continue to work in partnerships with other service 
providers and Aboriginal communities to improve the 
health of Aboriginal people. 
We have an incredible healthcare team. We are proud of 
the flexibility and resilience of the team. They have shown 
commitment to providing high-quality patient care during 
unprecedented times and we would like to thank the team 
for their ongoing efforts.

Year in review
The resilience and versatility of Western Sydney Local 
Health District came to the fore in 2020-21 as we grew and 
improved services, increased our commitment to research, 
looked after our staff and planned for the future of 
healthcare – all while continuing to tackle COVID-19 
through testing, treating and now vaccination.
We opened the Central Acute Services Building as the 
$1.1 billion Westmead Redevelopment continued. We also 
opened a new leisure and recreation hub for mental health 
consumers at Cumberland Hospital, and unveiled the 
refurbished Merrylands HealthOne community health 
centre. Work also commenced on significant upgrades 
to our mental health facilities at Blacktown Hospital.
We have conducted more than 800,000 COVID-19 tests, 
delivered more than 120,000 doses of the vaccine, and 
supported people in hotel quarantine with more than 
100,000 interpreter sessions. We opened more than 
40 COVID-19 testing clinics across western Sydney, and 
worked with community organisations to vaccinate more 
than 1000 vulnerable people at dedicated outreach events.
Westmead and Blacktown emergency departments 
launched a new model of care Rapid Assessment, 
Intervention, and Discharge-Emergency Department 
with allied health, significantly improving the patient 
experience score from 53 per cent to 79 per cent at 
Blacktown and from 58 per cent to 92 per cent at 
Westmead. A new antenatal care model at Auburn 
Hospital saw the proportion of pregnant women engaged 
in early care rise from four per cent to 35 per cent.
We were thrilled to launch a new Dragonfly Midwifery 
Clinic for Aboriginal mothers. The proportion of our staff 
who identify as Aboriginal or Torres Strait Islander has 
nearly doubled over the past two years, and we began 
regular yarning circles with Aboriginal elders and the 
community to discuss how we can improve services.
The launch of a Collaborative Commissioning with the 
Western Sydney Primary Health Network is driving 
innovation in the way we manage heart health, urgent 
health concerns and COVID-19. Our mental health service 
is working with Blacktown Police to respond to mental 
health emergencies, responding to more than 400 call-
outs and diverting two-thirds of consumers away from the 
emergency department. 
Our commitment to research is stronger than ever with the 
appointment of our first District Director of Research, and 
successful grants covering every area of health from heart 
regeneration and liver cancer to parental health literacy 
and COVID-19 stress.
This is just the tip of the iceberg, and of course none 
of it would be possible without the incredible work 
of the people who make it happen. I could not be more 
proud of our staff and want to thank them for everything 
they do each day for the people of Western Sydney 
Local Health District.
Key achievements
•	Applied successfully for a National Health and Medical 
Research Council Partnership grant for a cluster-
randomised controlled trial of the Parenting Plus 
intervention program. Child and Family Health, in 
collaboration with partners, designed the program for 
new parents to receive more education and guidance 
through the healthcare system. At the same time, Child 
and Family Health implemented the Circle of Security 
Parenting. The highly regarded evidence-based parenting 
program incorporates videos, teaching, discussion 
and reflection to help develop the capacity of the parents 
of western Sydney. 
•	Targeted priority populations with Youth Health, as 
The COVID STREETFIGHTER program communicated 
with stakeholders and rapidly scaled up messaging on 
Facebook. This resulted in many young vulnerable people 
receiving COVID-19 tests and information, access to 
telehealth for counselling appointments and mental 
health care packs for young people in isolation during 
the first wave of the pandemic.
NSW Health

•	Provided a coordinated approach to COVID-19 
communication through Multicultural Health Services, 
working in collaboration with internal and external 
stakeholders to ensure culturally and linguistically 
diverse communities in western Sydney received timely, 
credible, linguistically and culturally appropriate 
information. Two-way communication processes were 
established with culturally and linguistically diverse 
communities early in the pandemic to help identify fears, 
concerns, challenges and communication needs. 
Multilingual resources were developed to meet 
communication needs of a very diverse Western Sydney 
Local Health District population.
•	Started our new Aboriginal Supportive and Palliative care 
worker, of which we have seen improved culturally 
appropriate services delivery and support for those and 
their families who are experiencing end of life.
•	Implemented an innovative allied health model of care, 
the Rapid Assessment Intervention and Discharge in the 
Emergency Department team at Westmead and 
Blacktown hospitals. The team works extended hours 
across seven days including occupational therapy, 
physiotherapy and social work with the model of care 
enabling proactive screening of all patients who present 
to the emergency department.
•	Delivered construction of the 14-storey Central Acute 
Services Building in accordance with the schedule 
program and handed over to Western Sydney Local 
Health District on 17 July 2020. The $1.1 billion Westmead 
Redevelopment is the biggest health infrastructure 
project in the state – including the Westmead Hospital 
redevelopments and stage one of The Children’s Hospital 
at Westmead. Stage 3 refurbishment works, to create a 
new specialist cardiology outpatient and administrative 
hub along with new high-acuity neurosciences inpatient 
beds, were completed on 21 May 2021.
•	Achieved more than five percentage points improvement 
in patient experience through Auburn Hospital 
Emergency Department during the COVID-19 pandemic 
as reported by Bureau of Health Information as 
a result of strategies focused on transforming the 
patient’s experience.
•	Launched a pilot leadership program in February 
2021, recognising the importance of fostering the next 
generation of leaders among nurses and midwives in 
western Sydney. The participants of the Nursing and 
Midwifery Directorate’s leadership program were 
selected across facilities and services, and have been 
provided the opportunity to develop and grow on their 
leadership journey through the engagement with subject 
matter experts at specialised workshops focusing on 
patient safety, workforce, conflict and financial 
management. 
•	Delivered further progress on cultural transformation 
focusing on three key areas: leadership, behaviours and 
communication – including the development and launch 
of our Culture Vision of ‘Our Place, Our People’ 
•	Established a Health Academy for Aboriginal and Torres 
Strait Islander students to create pathways into 
employment in partnership with Indigenous Allied Health 
Australia Ltd, NSW Department of Education, NSW 
TAFE, South Eastern Sydney Local Health District and 
Nepean Blue Mountains Local Health District. Western 
Sydney Local Health District will be offering clinical 
placements for trainees with a view of transitioning to 
permanent employment.

Conditions for which hospitalisation is considered 
potentially avoidable through preventive care and early 
disease management, usually delivered in an ambulatory 
(walk-in) setting, such as primary healthcare.
The term does not mean that a patient admitted for that 
condition did not need to be hospitalised at the time of 
admission. Rather, the hospitalisation may have been 
prevented by timely and appropriate provision of primary 
or community-based healthcare. Reducing hospitalisations 
might involve vaccination, early diagnosis and treatment, 
and/or good ongoing management of risk factors and 
conditions in community settings. 
Rates of potentially preventable hospitalisations have 
been fairly stable over time, with rates for males and 
females converging in recent years. In 2019-20 in NSW, 
the rate of potentially preventable hospitalisations was 
1995 per 100,000 population for both males and females 
or 180,305 hospital episodes in total.

There has been a long-term reduction in smoking over the 
last 10 years, with 9.2 per cent of adults (10.8 per cent of 
males and 7.7 per cent of females) in NSW reporting daily 
smoking in 2020.
Tobacco use is the leading contributor to the burden of 
illness and deaths in Australia, followed closely by high 
body mass and excessive alcohol consumption. Australia 
has one of the most comprehensive tobacco control 
policies and programs in the world. The aim of these 
tobacco control programs in NSW is to contribute to a 
continuing reduction of smoking prevalence rates in the 
community.

In NSW over the 10 years between 2011 and 2020, the rate 
of overweight and obesity in the population has gradually 
increased from 52.1 per cent to 56.8 per cent of adults. 
Underlying this trend, the rate of increase in overweight 
was lower than that of obesity (between 2011 and 2020, 
overweight rates increased from 33.1 per cent to 34.3 per 
cent whereas obesity rates increased from 19.1 per cent to 
22.5 per cent). 
In 2020, 56.8 per cent of adults aged 16 years and over 
(62.2 per cent of men and 51.6 per cent of women) were 
overweight or obese. Further, 34.3 per cent of adults (40.2 
per cent of males and 28.4 per cent of females) were 
overweight and 22.5 per cent (22.0 per cent of males and 
23.1 per cent of females) were obese. 
Excess body weight is one of the main public health 
problems in Australia. The risk of developing chronic 
health conditions such as diabetes and heart disease 
increases with increasing levels of excess weight.

In NSW, the prevalence of overweight and obesity in 
children has been relatively stable over the 10-year period 
from 2011 to 2020. In 2020, 19.3 per cent of children aged 
five to 16 years (21.3 per cent of boys and 17.1 per cent of 
girls) were overweight or obese. However, the prevalence 
remains high and is a cause for concern.

In 2020 in NSW, 32.5 per cent of adults (41.7 per cent of 
men and 23.6 per cent of women) consumed more than 
two standard alcoholic drinks on a day when they drank 
alcohol, posing a long-term risk to their health.
While alcohol consumption at levels that pose a long-term 
health risk was in decline over the 10 years prior to 2015 in 
NSW, rates have increased since then.
Excessive alcohol consumption is the leading contributor 
to the burden of illness and deaths in Australia for people 
aged up to 44 years and the third overall contributor to 
total burden of disease and illness for all ages, behind 
tobacco and high body mass.
The guidelines to reduce the health risks from drinking 
alcohol, published by the National Health and Medical 
Research Council in 2009, state that the lifetime risk of 
harm from alcohol-related disease or injury is reduced by 
drinking no more than two standard drinks on any day 
when drinking alcohol. The measure of lifetime risk of 
harm is defined as more than two standard drinks on a day 
when alcohol is consumed, and is referred to as ‘long-term 
risk of harm’ from alcohol consumption. As this definition 
is based on usual alcohol consumption, therefore 
representing an overall pattern of drinking, it reflects 
alcohol use related to health risk over the long term.

The infant mortality rate is the number of infant deaths 
(up to one year of age) per 1000 births. During 2017-19, an 
average of 30 deaths of Aboriginal infants under one year 
of age per year were registered in NSW. Over the period 
2001-03 to 2017-19, the infant mortality rate among 
Aboriginal infants halved from 8.6 to 4.3 deaths per 1000 
births, while the rate among non-Aboriginal infants 
reduced by around one-third from 4.3 to 2.9 infant deaths 
per 1000 births.
The mortality rate among Aboriginal infants in NSW is 
lower than in other Australian states and territories. From 
2017-19, the infant mortality rate for all Aboriginal infants 
in Australia was 5.4 compared with a rate of 4.3 deaths 
per 1000 births for Aboriginal infants in NSW.

In NSW in 2020, the proportion of low birth weight babies 
born to Aboriginal mothers was around two-thirds higher 
than the proportion born to non-Aboriginal mothers. 
Between 2001 and 2020, the proportion of low birth 
weight babies among Aboriginal mothers decreased from 
12.5 per cent to 10.2 per cent. 
Smoking in pregnancy is associated with an increased risk 
of having a low birth weight baby. 
The proportion of Aboriginal mothers who reported 
smoking at some time during pregnancy fell from 59.0 per 
cent in 2001 to 41.7 per cent in 2020. In 2020, 11.3 per cent 
of Aboriginal mothers who smoked quit during the first 
half of their pregnancy.

The purpose of antenatal visits is to monitor the health of 
the mother and baby, provide advice to promote the health 
of the mother and baby, and identify antenatal 
complications so that appropriate intervention can be 
provided at the earliest time.
The first comprehensive antenatal assessment should be 
carried out as early as possible in pregnancy. In NSW in 
2020, the proportion of Aboriginal mothers who attended 
their first antenatal visit before 14 weeks of pregnancy 
was 76.3 per cent, compared with 80.2 per cent of non-
Aboriginal mothers.

system with mental health illness were diverted away from 
custody into community-based treatment by the Justice 
Health and Forensic Mental Health Network (excludes

The percentage of patients who received their elective 
surgery within clinically recommended timeframes 
declined in NSW. In 2020-21, the number of patients 
receiving their surgery on time remained at 100 per cent 
for category 1 (urgent surgery), with category 2 
(semi-urgent surgery) at 87 per cent and category 3 
(non-urgent surgery) at 75 per cent. Elective surgery 
activity and performance has been impacted by COVID-19 
with restrictions placed on non-urgent elective surgery for 
a substantial portion in early 2020.

compared with 2019-20. Emergency departments are 
maintaining high levels of care while caring for an 
increased volume of patients. Districts and networks 
continue their efforts towards improving patient flow in 
emergency department and hospital wards despite the 
additional pressures brought on by the COVID-19

achieved in salary bands not currently at or above 1.8 per cent, 
the cumulative representation of Aboriginal employees in the 
sector is expected to reach 3.3 per cent (original overall target 
is 2.6 per cent).

Staff turnover	
Factors influencing staff turnover include remuneration 
and recognition, employer/employee relations and 
practices, workplace culture and organisational 
structure. Monitoring turnover rates over time enables 
the identification of areas of concern and development 
of strategies to reduce turnover.
The desired outcome is to reduce turnover rates within 
acceptable limits to increase staff stability. For June 2021, 
the staff turnover rate was 8.4 per cent – an increase 
from 7.9 per cent in June 2020.

Sick leave
Effective people management and monitoring helps 
reduce the amount of sick leave staff take. This in turn 
helps reduce the need for, and cost of, replacing staff 
and prevents the potential negative effect on service 
delivery where replacement staff are not readily available. 
Sick leave per FTE increased slightly from 62.65 hours 
per FTE in 2019-20 to 64.65 hours per FTE in 2020-21.

Award changes and 
industrial relations claims
Wage increases
Unions sought a wage increase for NSW Health staff of 
2.5 per cent for the period 1 July 2020 to 30 June 2021, 
as the NSW Government submitted that wage increases 
should not occur due to the economic impacts of the 
COVID-19 pandemic. 
The NSW Industrial Relations Commission awarded a 
0.3 per cent wage increase to NSW Health Awards 
following arbitration. For paramedics, the Commission also 
awarded an additional bonus amount being the difference 
between $1000 and the 0.3 per cent wage increase.
Nursing hours per patient day 
The NSW Government committed to increase the 
‘Nursing Hours per Patient Day’ minimum award staffing 
requirements over four years from 2019-20. NSW Health 
implemented the second year of the commitment this year.
Patient Transport Officer 
training arrangements
The Ministry made an application for the Award to be 
varied to modernise and clarify its qualification and 
training requirements for Patient Transport Officers. If not 
settled beforehand, this dispute will be arbitrated in the 
Industrial Relations Commission in late September 2021.
Paramedics Claim for a New 
Transitional Benefits Award
The NSW Industrial Relations Commission rejected the 
union claim, which sought a new Award for Paramedics, 
providing a new allowance to compensate employees 
for reduced overtime as a result of enhanced staffing 
numbers as part of the Statewide Enhancement Program. 
Broken Hill Award application
The Ministry filed an award application for the staff 
of the Broken Hill Health Service, with the Award seeking 
to grandfather beneficial conditions existing staff 
presently have while employing new staff under the 
relevant state award. 
In January 2021, the Industrial Relations Commission 
issued its decision, setting down the principles for the new 
Award. The new Award is subject to ongoing discussions 
between the Ministry, the Health Services Union and the 
Barrier Industrial Council. The new Award will provide 
clarity around conditions of employment and replace an 
outdated 1997 Industrial agreement between the parties, 
which continues to be the cause of ongoing disputation 
between the parties. 
ASMOF claim for Registrar 
classification dispute mechanism
The Australian Salaried Medical Officers Federation of 
NSW (ASMOF) lodged a dispute in the NSW Industrial 
Relations Commission about the classification of 
Registrars in local health districts. ASMOF seek to vary the 
Medical Officers’ Award to remove the requirement of 
three years’ postgraduate experience for a Medical 
Officer to be classified as a Registrar. The matter is listed 
for hearing in November 2021.
NSW Health	
Annual Report 2020-21   :  Appendix   :  page 309


ASMOF claim to maintain non-standard 
arrangements for Western Sydney 
Local Health District Radiologists
NSW Ministry of Health is seeking to remove unauthorised 
industrial arrangements covering radiology staff 
specialists at Western Sydney Local Health District dating 
back to 1999. The arrangements are being maintained 
until the matter is determined by the NSW Industrial 
Relations Commission as the status quo provisions of the 
Award have been invoked.
Excess travel allowance dispute 
On 8 March 2021, the Industrial Relations Commission 
determined that staff who were transferred temporarily 
to a new location were entitled under the Award to 
the excess fare and travel provisions for the duration 
of the transfer.
Section 19 Award Reviews and further 
action on the Infectious Cleaning Allowance
The Ministry filed submissions and evidence and 
participated in a full bench arbitration in November 2020. 
Further conciliation efforts after the arbitration were 
unsuccessful.
On 30 June 2021, the Full Bench handed down its decision 
and proposed an updated infectious cleaning cause. The 
parties have an opportunity to raise comments or 
concerns about the proposed clause and file a further 
variation application if necessary.
Restructuring processes with 
redundancy/excess staff implications
Ongoing advice and management has been provided to 
local health districts and public health organisations 
relating to their workforce change proposals. Major 
change processes included the Bulli Hospital restructure, 
Illawarra Shoalhaven Local Health District Anatomical 
Pathology Commissioning, Gloucester Aged Care 
transition to AnglicanCare, the closure of Liverpool Aged 
Care Respite Care Centre, the Mental Health Line 
outsourcing to MediBank and the restructure in Southern 
NSW Local Health District.
Appeal of NSW Industrial Relations 
Commission decision in relation 
to On Call Allowance
The Secretary, NSW Health appealed the NSW Industrial 
Relations Commission’s decision which required the 
continued payment of an on-call allowance to staff that 
were not required to be on call as per the Award. The 
Commission’s decision has not yet been handed down.

Note: 1. Data sourced from Health Information Exchange (HIE). The number of separations includes care type changes. 2. Activity 
includes services contracted to private sector. Data reported are as at 08/08/2021. 3. Acute average length of stay = (Acute bed days/
Acute separations). 4. Daily average of inpatients = Total Bed Days/365. 5. Bed occupancy rate is based on June data only. Facilities 
with peer groups other than A1 to C2 are excluded. The following bed types are excluded from all occupancy rate calculations: 
emergency departments, delivery suites, operating theatres, hospital in the home, recovery wards, residential aged care, community 
residential and respite activity. 6. Acute activity is defined by a service category of acute or newborn. Results for Acute separations 
and bed days from 2018-19 onwards may not be directly comparable to previous years due to the impact of the implementation of the 
Mental Health Care Type classification. 7. Service events measured from aggregate of patient level and summary data submissions 
for each non-admitted service/clinic. Pathology services are not included. Data for previous years is not comparable. Data as at 
27/08/21. Source: EDWARD.

Appendix 4
Mental Health
Section 108 of the NSW Mental Health Act 2007 
In accordance with section 108 of the NSW Mental 
Health Act 2007 the tables presented here provide an 
overview of mental health activities and performance 
in mental health public hospitals for 2020-21 in relation to:
a)	 
achievements during the reporting period in mental 
health service performance
b)	 
data relating to the utilisation of mental health 
resources.
Table 1 provides data against a set of measures for 
hospital activities related to bed utilisation (availability 
and occupancy of beds), hospital separations (same day 
and overnight), and community contacts. Activity measure 
is based on all acute, sub-acute and non-acute mental 
health facilities.
Table 2 provides rates for three national key performance 
indicators (KPIs). These indicators measure effectiveness 
(28 days readmission rate), appropriateness (seclusion rate, 
duration and frequency) and continuity (seven days post 
discharge community care) of care in acute mental health 
service.
Table 1 includes indicators only for services directly funded 
through the Mental Health program. National reports on 
mental health also include data from a small number of 
services funded by other funding programs (for example, 
Primary Care, Rehabilitation and Aged Care). Therefore, the 
numbers reported here may differ from those in national 
reports (for example, Report on Government Services, Mental 
Health Services in Australia, National Mental Health 
Commission National Report).

Annual Report 2020-21   :  Appendix   :  page 313


Definitions: 1. ‘Average available beds’ are the average of 365 nightly census counts. This data is extracted from the Bed Reporting 
System by System Information and Analytics (SIA) Branch, NSW Health. An available bed is one that is staffed, open and available 
for admission of a patient. 2. ‘Average occupied beds’ are calculated from the total Occupied Overnight Bed Days for the year. 
Higher numbers of occupied beds than available can sometimes be reported due to use of surge beds to cope with high demands. 
1,2. Components may not add to total in NSW due to rounding error. 3. ‘Same-day separations’ are those where the hospital episode 
begins and ends on the same day. 4. ‘Overnight separations’ are episodes of hospital care where the person stays at least one night in 
hospital, and are concluded by discharge, death, transfer to another hospital or change to a different type of care at the same hospital. 
5. Ambulatory mental health care includes all care provided by specialist mental health services for people who are not inpatients of 
mental health units at the time of care. 6. Revised ambulatory contacts, NSW 2019-20.

Glossary
Activity Based Funding
Activity Based Funding is a 
management tool which helps plan  
and assess performance and clinical 
needs as part of the approach to the 
funding, purchasing and performance 
of health services. Activity Based 
Funding helps make public health 
funding more effective because health 
service management can allocate  
their share of available state and 
Commonwealth funding based on real 
levels of patient care. The Activity 
Based Funding tool allows public health 
planners, administrators, consumers 
and clinicians to see how and where 
taxpayer funding is being allocated.
Acute care
Short-term medical treatment, usually 
in a hospital, for patients with an acute 
illness or injury, or recovering from

of diseases, such as heart disease, 
cancer, and arthritis, that tend to be 
long-lasting and persistent in their 
symptoms or development. Although

communicable diseases (infections),  
the term chronic diseases is usually 
confined to non-communicable 
diseases.

Pillars
The five pillar organisations in  
NSW Health provide expertise  
in the development of new models  
of care, quality and safety initiatives, 
training and development and 
performance reporting which helps 
local health districts and networks 
provide the best possible care. The 
pillar organisations are: Agency for 
Clinical Innovation, Bureau of Health 
Information, Cancer Institute NSW, 
Clinical Excellence Commission, and 
Health Education and Training Institute.
Primary care
Provides the patient with a broad 
spectrum of care, both preventive and 
curative, over a certain period of time 
and coordinates all of the care the 
person receives.
Primary Health Networks
Primary Health Networks have been 
established with the key objectives of 
increasing the efficiency and 
effectiveness of medical services for 
patients, particularly those at risk of 
poor health outcomes.
QIDS
The Clinical Excellence Commission’s 
Quality Improvement Data System 
(QIDS), which provides a single point of 
access to information and tools for the 
purpose of improving the quality and 
safety of health service delivery. 
Radiotherapy
The study and discipline of treating 
malignant disease with radiation. The 
treatment is referred to as radiotherapy 
or radiation therapy.
REACH
A system that helps patients, their 
family and carers escalate concerns 
with staff about changes in a patient’s 
condition. REACH – Recognise, Engage, 
Act, Call, Help is on its way – was 
developed by the Clinical Excellence 
Commission in collaboration with local 
health districts and consumers.
SafeHaven
SafeHavens are a drop-in alternative  
to the emergency department for 
people experiencing emotional and 
suicidal distress. 
Specialty Health Networks
Two specialist networks operate across 
NSW with a focus on children’s and 
paediatric services, and forensic mental 
health. A third network operates across 
the public health services provided  
by three Sydney facilities operated by 
St Vincent’s Health Network.
Take own leave
When an admitted or non-admitted 
patient leaves a hospital or healthcare 
setting before their treating provider 
has authorised discharge.
Telehealth
The delivery of health services using 
different forms of communications 
technology, such as videoconferencing, 
giving access to healthcare services  
to people in rural and remote areas and 
to people as a response to the 
COVID-19 pandemic.
Tranche 1
Eight initiatives were selected for 
Tranche 1 in 2016, as part of the Leading 
Better Value Care program, with 
implementation commencing in 2017-18. 
The eight Tranche 1 initiatives are: 
osteoarthritis chronic care program, 
osteoporosis refracture prevention, 
chronic heart failure, chronic 
obstructive pulmonary disease, 
diabetes mellitus, diabetic high risk  
foot services, falls in hospitals and 
renal supportive care.
Tranche 2
In 2017, local health districts nominated 
five more initiatives as part of Leading 
Better Value Care. These Tranche 2 
initiatives commenced implementation 
in 2019-20 and are: hip fracture care, 
wound management, bronchiolitis, 
hypofractionated radiotherapy for 
breast cancer, and direct access 
colonoscopy.
Transfer of Care
Measures the percentage of patients 
arriving at hospital by ambulance 
whose care is transferred from 
ambulance staff to the emergency 
department staff within 30 minutes  
of arrival.
Triage
An essential function of emergency 
departments where many patients may 
present at the same time. Triage aims  
to ensure that patients are treated in 
order of their clinical priority and that 
their treatment is timely.
Unwarranted clinical variation
Where patients with similar diagnoses 
are treated differently when there  
is no clinical reason for this to happen.
Value based care
Is focused on generating value for 
patients by improving health outcomes, 
reducing costs and enabling healthcare 
access across a greater geographical 
area. In NSW, value based healthcare 
means continually striving to deliver 
care that improves:
•	health outcomes that matter  
to patients
•	experiences of receiving care
•	experiences of providing care
•	effectiveness and efficiency  
of care.
Viral vector
Viral vectors are microscopic tools 
commonly used by molecular biologists 
to deliver healthy copies of genes to 
tissues and organs within patients or 
deliver the ability to correct the genetic 
error at its source. This process can  
be performed inside a living organism 
or in cell culture.
Virtual care
Virtual care, also known as telehealth, 
safely connects patients with health 
professionals to deliver care when and 
where it is needed. It complements the 
face-to-face care that patients are used to.
Visiting Medical Officer (VMO)
A medical practitioner in private 
practice who also provides medical 
services in a public hospital. VMOs are 
not hospital employees but are 
contracted by the local health district  
to provide specific medical services.

Secretary’s year 
in review
Every day, NSW Health delivers 
world-class care and achieves 
outstanding outcomes for 
people across the state. 
This is made possible by our 
remarkable staff who provide 
high-quality, safe, kind and 
compassionate care. 
It is a privilege to lead and work with this diverse team 
of exceptional people. On behalf of the executive team 
at NSW Health, thank you for your dedication, passion, 
and making a positive difference - for patients, their 
families, your colleagues, and the communities we serve. 
Our remarkable people
Great people working together creates great experiences 
and outcomes of care. We also know that the experiences 
of our patients, their families, and carers, are closely tied 
to the experiences of our staff.
We want our diverse workforce to thrive, in an environment 
where everyone is valued, respected, and empowered to 
deliver their best. A strong, vibrant culture, underpinned 
by our values of Collaboration, Openness, Respect and 
Empowerment takes time and effort to build and sustain.
While we have so much to be proud of, we are committed 
to evolving. Listening to our staff and acting on their 
feedback remains a big focus for us. My thanks to the 
many teams and leaders across NSW Health who have 
been working hard on initiatives that contribute to making 
NSW Health an even better place to work.
NSW Health System Advisory Council
Our NSW Health vision is for a sustainable health system, 
that delivers outcomes that matter most to patients and 
the community, is personalised, invests in wellness and 
is digitally enabled.
To achieve our vision, NSW Health has been focused on 
progressing key objectives within the Future Health 
Strategic Framework – an ambitious ten-year roadmap 
launched in 2022 and informed by inputs from thousands 
of stakeholders to determine and address both current, 
and anticipated whole of system priorities. 
The recently established NSW Health System Advisory 
Council will play a key role in bringing our vision and 
strategy to life. The advisory council is a diverse, 
multidisciplinary group. Its members are a cross-section 
of NSW Health clinical and allied healthcare professions, 
along with representatives from the Aboriginal clinical 
community, and the NSW Health executive team. 
Together, the advisory council will provide expert advice 
to inform frontline healthcare delivery and ensure the 
views and insights of healthcare professionals working 
across our system inform key statewide priorities.
NSW Health	
Annual Report 2022–23   :  Preface   :  page iv


Time for care
Our ‘Time for Care’ initiative aims to reduce and streamline 
non-clinical and administrative work for frontline staff 
to free up more time for what matters most – patient care. 
More than 3,000 people across our local health districts 
provided a wide array of feedback to help identify 
opportunities for healthcare staff to spend more time 
with patients. 
These opportunities included practical suggestions 
to simplify policies and processes, to ideas for how we 
better use our technology. These will be converted 
into a series of short, medium and longer-term actions 
that enable healthcare workers to spend more time with 
patients, ultimately leading to better outcomes, and 
achieving tangible progress towards our Future Health 
strategic priorities.
Planning for the future
Several changes have been made to deliver a more 
streamlined, integrated and effective structure within the 
NSW Ministry of Health, as it works to support the whole 
health system. This included bringing together the Agency 
for Clinical Innovation and the Office for Health and 
Medical Research under the leadership of a newly 
appointed Deputy Secretary, Jean-Frédéric Levesque. 
Wayne Jones, formerly Chief Executive of Northern 
NSW Local Health District, was appointed State Health 
Services Functional Area Co-ordinator and is working 
to strengthen our systemwide emergency planning. 
Matthew Daly was appointed Deputy Secretary, System 
Sustainability and Performance, and Deb Willcox was 
appointed Deputy Secretary, Health System Strategy 
and Patient Experience, with changes to their respective 
responsibilities to better meet future system needs. 
NSW Health is aiming for a smaller, more environmentally 
sustainable footprint, and we want to achieve ‘net zero’ 
by 2050. This year we established a Climate Risk and Net 
Zero Unit to coordinate and scale up action across 
NSW Health and help achieve our vision of a sustainable, 
climate-resilient health system. 
We also launched the NSW Health Sustainable Futures 
Innovation Fund to support staff-led projects that improve 
patient care and reduce our environmental footprint, and 
accelerate innovation across NSW Health. 
Responsiveness and innovation
COVID-19 was still prevalent in NSW during the last 
year and continued to impact all aspects of the health 
service. Although COVID-19 remains with us, last year we 
reached an inflection point and took time to review and 
reflect on NSW Health’s operational response to the 
pandemic and inform future responses to public health 
emergencies. My sincere thanks to everyone who 
contributed to this work, helping to strengthen future 
emergency preparedness. 
“NSW Health could not 
have done what it did 
without the unrelenting 
efforts, unprecedented 
collegiality, and flexibility 
of its staff.” 
Source: As one system page v.
The pandemic not only demonstrated the unwavering 
commitment of NSW Health’s staff to the communities 
it serves, but their ability to quickly respond to an 
ever-changing environment and implement innovations 
to advance patient care. 
I am excited about continuing to focus on what we can 
achieve in this area and the growing opportunities 
presented by technology and its innovative applications, 
which continue to go from strength to strength. 
We are providing virtual care to more people than 
ever, including in the comfort of their own homes, 
implementing exciting new models of care and seeing 
deeper collaboration between metropolitan and 
regional clinicians and allied health professionals. 
In 2022-23, we launched the virtual intensive care 
service, which links clinicians caring for critically ill 
patients in the Far West Local Health District, with 
intensive care specialist nurses and doctors from Sydney 
Local Health District. There are many examples of this 
type of service across the state including the very 
impressive maturation of vCare in Dubbo which supports 
a huge geography across western NSW. 
NSW Health	
Annual Report 2022–23   :  Preface   :  page v


These services are a great example of how virtual 
care enhances collaboration, while also boosting access 
to health services, particularly specialist services, 
to communities throughout NSW. 
Through this work we are building an even more robust, 
patient-centred health system for the people of NSW. 
Regional, rural and remote healthcare 
Following the establishment of the Regional Health 
Division within the NSW Ministry of Health, we delivered 
the Regional Health Strategic Plan 2022-2032 
– a blueprint for the next decade of regional healthcare. 
The plan was developed after extensive, statewide 
stakeholder consultation and identifies outcomes that 
matter most to regional, rural and remote patients and 
communities. Focus areas include: strengthening the 
regional health workforce; improving access to quality, 
timely healthcare; and building community engagement. 
It also addresses issues raised in the NSW Parliamentary 
Inquiry into health outcomes and access to health 
and hospital services in rural, regional and remote NSW.
The Single Employer Model is a great example of how 
we are investing in regional health, and attracting and 
retaining healthcare professionals. The program provides 
pathways for junior doctors to train as rural generalists, 
enabling them to provide care in both emergency 
departments and general practice. For regional, rural 
and remote areas of NSW, this program will help boost 
their access to specialist skills, while also providing 
an attractive career opportunity for doctors. 
I also want to acknowledge the challenges faced by those 
regional areas, which in recent years have included 
multiple natural disasters that have greatly impacted 
our staff, their families, and communities. Nonetheless, 
our incredibly dedicated staff continue to deliver 
outstanding care for their communities. It is no wonder 
feedback from patients in our rural health facilities 
remains consistently and overwhelmingly positive.
Our commitment to Closing the Gap
NSW Health continues our commitment to Closing the 
Gap by supporting truth-telling and the ongoing process 
of healing for our Aboriginal communities. This is a 
unifying goal for all of us across the NSW Health System. 
We are deeply committed to working in partnership with 
stolen generations' survivors and their descendants, 
ensuring that their lived experience guides our strategic 
planning and service delivery.
In May 2023, one year on from our formal apology to the 
survivors of the stolen generations, we held a special 
unveiling ceremony with special guests from the Stolen 
Generations Organisations, permanently embedding our 
apology into a sandstone monument and installing it 
in the Yarning Circle outside the NSW Ministry of Health’s 
building in St Leonards. 
Our health family
NSW Health and our outstanding workforce is 
incredibly rich in its diversity, but we are one big family.
No matter where you are based or what you do in 
NSW Health, what binds us together is our shared 
passion and commitment to caring for people.
Thank you, from the bottom of my heart, for all you 
contribute to each other and the people of NSW.

Health
Guiding the next 
decade of care in NSW 
2022-2032
Report
Future Health: 
Guiding the next 
decade of care 
in NSW 2022–2032
Future Health is 
NSW Health’s 
strategic roadmap.
Future Health positions our health system to 
meet the needs of our patients, community and 
workforce over the next decade, while adapting 
to and addressing the demands and challenges 
facing our system.
Our NSW Health vision, as well as the strategic 
outcomes and key objectives of Future Health 
(see page 15), has been informed by the 
experiences and viewpoints of the people who 
work in, and who interact with, our health system. 
Throughout the 2022–23 financial year, we have 
focused on implementing Future Health by 
developing action plans and a measurement and 
governance framework to guide our approach. 
Our system’s challenges 
Health is expected to remain the largest category of 
recurrent state spending. NSW Health spends more 
than $30 billion on healthcare services in NSW: 
•	This spend is largely concentrated in hospitals, with 
85% of spend on outpatient, ambulatory, emergency, 
inpatient and sub-acute/rehabilitation care. 
•	Prevention and promotion currently account for 10% 
of NSW Health expenditure.
•	The remainder, or about 5%, is invested in community 
or other care settings. 
This distribution of cost reflects the historic hospital-
focused approach to healthcare, and has been an 
appropriate model for decades, given traditional patient 
needs and methods of service delivery. 
The burden of disease in the community that the 
NSW Health system faces now and will continue to 
experience in coming decades, requires a different 
approach. A national focus on keeping people 
healthy and well, and effective management of 
chronic conditions is needed to reduce demand for 
hospital care and keep health spending sustainable, 
while maintaining optimal health outcomes. This will 
need to be complemented by greater integration 
with primary care and non-government organisations.

Understanding the patient experience 
Elevating the Human Experience 
Delivering on initiatives in Elevating the Human 
Experience – Our Guide to Action continues to be a 
priority for NSW Health. Establishing collaborative 
partnerships has been identified as a priority area and in 
2022, over 200 consumers, staff and representatives 
from peak agencies were involved in the co-design of All 
of Us – A guide to engaging consumers, carers, and 
communities. Published in May 2023, All of Us is a set of 
core principles for respectful engagement.
Bureau of Health Information 
The Bureau of Health Information (BHI) continued to 
provide the most reliable and comprehensive statewide 
picture of patient experience in NSW public hospitals. 
Regular reporting provides transparency for patients 
about healthcare performance, while delivering analyses 
and insights to support accountability and improvement. 


NSW Health	
Annual Report 2022–23   :  Operations and Performance  :  page 19
In 2022-23, BHI enhanced the timeliness of its reporting, 
supported health staff to make more effective use of 
survey results, focused on high-priority issues, such as 
virtual care and experiences of elective surgery, and 
deployed more advanced analytics in new short-form 
reports in the Insights Series.
Experiences of service
The Your Experience of Service (YES) survey and Mental 
Health Carer Experience (CES) Survey continue to be 
routinely collected to inform improvement initiatives. 
In 2022-23, more than 22,400 YES, 2,900 CES and 
1,400 Your Experience of Service- Community Managed 
Organisations (YES-CMO) surveys were completed. 
Services receive regular reports to assist them in 
identifying what they are doing well and areas for 
improvement. 
In 2022-23, 75% of consumers reported an excellent 
or very good experience, an increase from the previous 
year, and 67% of carers reported an excellent or 
very good experience. Positive consumer experience 
of CMO services continued to be rated highly, with 
92% of respondents rating it excellent or very good.
The Centre for Alcohol and Other Drugs also conducted 
a small pilot of an Alcohol and Other Drugs Your 
Experience of Service Survey to measure patient 
experience in local health district and non-government 
organisation services.
Patient Transport Service
HealthShare NSW launched the dedicated patient and 
carer feedback survey in September 2022. The survey 
captures feedback on NSW Health Patient Transport 
Service crews and partner providers, and measures 
overall satisfaction, timeliness and in-vehicle experience. 
For carers, the survey also measures the extent to which 
they feel supported in the provision of care for the 
patient. Results in 2022-23 show an overall satisfaction 
rating of nine out of 10. 
Driving improvements 
in patient-centred cancer care
Cancer Institute NSW drove improvements in patient-
centred care through its patient-reported measures 
program, which collects feedback about cancer patients’ 
experiences and outcomes. In 2022-23, the program 
reached 14,500 electronic patient information surveys. 
Results were available to clinicians in real time, 
supporting discussions with patients and the provision 
of tailored information and support.
The Institute funded implementation of in-language 
surveys at existing sites in eight community languages 
and supported cancer services to employ multicultural 
support staff to establish links to local services and 
referral pathways. In 2022-23, the program expanded to 
an additional three local health districts, with the system 
implemented and in use in 24 cancer centres across 
10 local health districts. 
As part of this program, the Cancer Institute NSW 
funded South Western Sydney Local Health District to 
embed the patient-reported measures program for 
Arabic and Vietnamese speaking people accessing 
cancer services. 
There is also a tailored, evidence-based supportive care 
needs assessment tool for Aboriginal people, which 
accommodates the language, customs and culture-
specific needs of Aboriginal people with cancer. 
Patient-reported measures
The Agency for Clinical Innovation (ACI) is committed to 
ensuring that patient-reported measures are culturally 
safe, and give Aboriginal people the opportunity to 
provide direct, timely feedback about their experiences 
and outcomes of care. 
This year, ACI partnered with the Kowa Collaboration 
and local health districts for the implementation, 
collection and use of patient-reported measures for the 
Aunty Jean program. It is a community orientated 
program to support Aboriginal people with or at risk of 
chronic illness. This included the development of a data 
sovereignty framework. 
Patient-reported measures are captured using the 
Health Outcomes and Patient Experience platform for 
25 different patient cohorts. In 2022-23, new patient 
surveys were integrated into the platform to help 
capture the impact of Long COVID on patients. 
Recipes for success
HealthShare NSW provides around 25 million quality and 
nutritious meals each year for patients. In 2022-23, the 
Food Services Reform program focused on expanding 
meals and menus to meet the needs of every patient. 
As part of the program, HealthShare NSW has engaged 
mental health consumers in the development and design 
of a new menu; commenced the staged implementation 
of KidsCHEF for paediatric patients; rolled out new 
texture modified foods to improve the experience of 
patients and residents on a pureed diet; and introduced 
a new, award-winning meal service model for the 
Adolescent and Young Adult Hospice at Manly, giving 
patients and families the opportunity to experience 
nourishing, home-style food.

Safety Fundamentals
Safety Fundamentals for patient-centred care were 
developed in recognition of the importance of teamwork 
to achieve a culture of safety and a shared goal of 
delivering safe, reliable, patient-centred care. 
These practical tools were formed by clinician and 
consumer consultation and cumulative evidence and 
have the potential to bring quick and measurable gains. 
Health workers can use these tools as part of day-to-day 
practice to strengthen the focus on partnering with 
patients, their families and carers and support improved 
patient and staff experience.
Designing our spaces well
Health Infrastructure collaborated with the Government 
Architect NSW to develop and release the Design Guide 
for Health: Spaces, Places and Precincts. It sets principles 
and design criteria to support government and industry 
to deliver functional, welcoming and inclusive health 
facilities. 
The Guide, together with capital project objectives and 
sustainability principles, supports Health Infrastructure’s 
decision making, and enables a whole-of-lifecycle 
approach to ensure facilities are sustainable, efficient 
and affordable to operate, while providing a legacy for 
future generations.
Informed cancer decisions
Evidence-based cancer information
Cancer Institute NSW supported people to access 
high-quality, evidence-based cancer information online. 
Resources supported people diagnosed with cancer to 
make informed decisions and self-manage. A total of 
22,093 users accessed online patient information during 
2022-23. 
Supporting multicultural communities 
In 2022, more than 14,200 users accessed online in-
language patient information, including resources on 
diagnosis and treatment in eight community languages 
to support improved cancer literacy in multicultural 
communities.
A total of 42 new online and print-on-demand resources 
in 24 languages were developed to support patients 
and carers from culturally and linguistically diverse 
backgrounds to make informed decisions. In total, 
the Cancer Institute now has at least one resource in 
38 community languages. All of the Cancer Institute 
NSW public awareness campaigns have been translated 
into community languages. 
Culturally safe and 
trauma-informed care
Aboriginal cancer care
Cancer Institute NSW appointed Aboriginal Care 
Coordinators in four local health district cancer services 
to provide culturally appropriate and safe care.
BreastScreen NSW commenced the Putuwa project, 
which aims to increase breast screening participation of 
Aboriginal women aged 40 years and over. To encourage 
more Aboriginal women to feel welcome at screening 
and assessment services, BreastScreen NSW engaged 
an Aboriginal artist to create artwork used for modesty 
shawls and promotional material, including a mobile 
screening site on the NSW north coast.
Providing care to sexually and 
gender diverse people with cancer
Cancer Institute NSW enhanced cancer service workers’ 
knowledge, confidence and skills in providing care to 
sexually and gender diverse people with cancer. In 
partnership with ACON, the Institute developed 
eLearning modules about the unique health and 
wellbeing issues and health disparities faced by 
LGBTIQ+ people. 
Since publication in January 2023, more than 200 people 
have enrolled in the training. An internal staff training 
course has also been completed by more than 220 
Cancer Institute NSW and BreastScreen NSW staff.
Safe environments for rehabilitation
The Agency for Clinical Innovation supported the adoption 
of Gadjigadji – my rehab, my journey, a digital resource to 
support clinicians to create a culturally safe environment 
for Aboriginal people in their rehabilitation service. 
The resource encourages clinical yarning, videos, 
stories, templates, quizzes, a self-assessment tool and 
artwork. Gadjigadji is being used in 35 locations across 
NSW, representing half the state’s rehabilitation sites. 
Clinicians have reported improved relationships with 
Aboriginal patients, improved engagement with 
rehabilitation services, and improved health outcomes. 
Integrated Trauma Informed Care Framework
In February 2023, the Integrated Trauma Informed Care 
Framework – My story, my health, my future was launched 
to address the need for trauma-informed, integrated 
care for children, young people, their families and carers. 
The Framework has been published on the NSW Health 
website along with a range of resources to support 
implementation.

Delivering healthcare to refugee 
communities in regional NSW
The Agency for Clinical Innovation published guidance 
for clinicians and their community partners on Delivering 
healthcare to refugee communities in regional NSW. The 
guidance supports the establishment of trauma-
informed and culturally safe health services for refugee 
communities. Health professionals and regional local 
health districts use this resource to effectively engage 
with vulnerable people with refugee backgrounds and 
improve experiences of healthcare. 
Making Visible: Preventing and 
responding to violence, abuse and neglect
In 2022-23, the Agency for Clinical Innovation launched 
its first ever podcast series, Making Visible: Preventing 
and responding to violence, abuse and neglect. Each 
episode shared practitioner perspectives and advice to 
support social workers, psychologists and health 
professionals deliver trauma-informed, best practice 
therapeutic care. The series proved successful with 
more than 1,000 downloads within a month of launch. 
Alcohol and other drugs
The NSW Ministry of Health Centre for Alcohol and Other 
Drugs funded two sites to establish a Safe Assessment 
Unit. The units provide integrated care, and respond to the 
needs of people presenting with, or at risk of, behavioural 
disturbances associated with substance use, mental health 
and/or social crisis. The Centre also incorporated principles 
of trauma-informed care into Special Commission of 
Inquiry into the Drug Ice initiatives, prioritising populations 
with specific needs. 
Making informed decisions 
about surgery
The Surgical Services team published online patient 
resources to provide public information about elective 
surgery access in NSW public hospitals and answer 
frequently asked questions from the community. From 
their release in September 2022 until 30 June 2023, the 
resources have had more than 16,000 page views with 
more than 10,000 visits to the How to join an elective 
surgery waitlist at an NSW public hospital webpage. 
In 2022-23, the Surgery Access Line responded to 934 
calls from patients, carers and general practitioners and 
provided information on access to surgery. This was an 
increase of 236 more calls from the previous year.
The Agency for Clinical Innovation published shared 
decision-making resources for older people living with 
frailty considering surgery. These resources aim to help 
older people living with frailty, their families and health 
staff make informed decisions about surgery. 
Excellence in Aboriginal Healthcare Award
South Western Sydney 
Local Health District
Aboriginal GOT IT! 
The Aboriginal Getting On Track In Time (GOT IT!) 
program is a cultural adaption program designed 
and led by local Aboriginal people from the 
South West Sydney area, aimed to improve the 
capacity of caregivers and schools to identify 
and respond to the social and emotional needs 
of children between three and nine years in a 
culturally responsive way.
The cultural adaptions reflected the localised 
need and showed that the program had significant 
positive impacts on the emotional regulation 
of children, parenting practices, and responses 
of school staff to emotion-based behaviours.

Enhancing our pathology services
NSW Health Pathology progressed work on the Fusion 
program which will standardise technologies, processes 
and workflows and deliver a new statewide laboratory 
information management system, an integral part of the 
ambitious Single Digital Patient Record program.
Its laboratories provided specialist testing for outbreaks 
and emerging notifiable diseases, including Japanese 
encephalitis, Mpox.
NSW Health Pathology undertook a review of collection 
services to better understand consumer and referrer 
needs, the physical environment of collection centres 
and the needs of collectors. 
Forensic Medicine Newcastle collaborated with local 
Aboriginal community members and used handmade 
quilts to cover the deceased for family viewings. Leaves 
painted by Aboriginal artists were offered to Aboriginal 
families to place with loved ones.
Working to keep people safe from harm
Royal Commission into Institutional 
Responses to Child Sexual Abuse
NSW Health has now delivered on all its public 
commitments under the NSW Government’s response 
to the Royal Commission into Institutional Responses 
to Child Sexual Abuse (Royal Commission). The 2022 
NSW Annual Report on Progress is the final report and 
covers NSW Health’s activities over 2022. 
NSW Health will continue the work to keep children 
and young people in NSW safe from harm. 
Children First 2022-2031, Talking About 
It and Safety in Action 2022-2024
On behalf of the NSW Government, NSW Health has 
led the development of Children First 2022-2031, a 
multiagency public health framework for the prevention 
and response to problematic and harmful sexual 
behaviours by children and young people. 
Children First is a world-first whole of government 
and community public health framework. It is supported 
by Talking About It, the NSW prevention action strategy, 
which outlines the evidence for preventing problematic 
and harmful sexual behaviours in children and 
 young people. 
Together, these documents set the vision and priorities 
for how NSW government agencies and the community, 
can and will work together to support children and 
young people who have displayed, or been affected by, 
problematic and harmful sexual behaviours. 
Safety in Action 2022-2024 is our NSW multiagency 
first action plan for the prevention and responding to 
problematic and harmful sexual behaviours by children 
and young people. Safety in Action outlines our 
collective actions in the first implementation phase 
of Children First and Talking About It.
Children First 2022-2031, Talking About It and Safety in 
Action 2022-2024 are the culmination of a significant 
and complex program of work across government that 
responds to the findings and recommendations of the 
2017 Royal Commission into Institutional Responses to 
Child Sexual Abuse. More than 2,500 workforce and 
community stakeholders across NSW contributed to the 
work, including children and families with lived experiences 
and representatives from our priority populations.
Working in partnership
During 2022-23, Education Centre Against Violence 
established a statewide, multiagency workforce 
development committee that has, together with the 
time-limited co-design advisory committee, guided 
implementation activities. This included the development 
and delivery of evidence-based, best practice training in 
partnership with People with Disability Australia and the 
NSW Council for Intellectual Disability in 2022; and the 
development of accessible information resources 
anticipated to be released in late 2023.
National Redress Scheme 
NSW Health participates in the National Redress 
Scheme for Survivors of Institutional Child Sexual 
Abuse. Through the Redress Scheme, successful 
applicants are eligible for a monetary payment, 
counselling, and a Direct Personal Response, which is 
a formal apology delivered to survivors by the institution 
found responsible for the abuse they have suffered. 
The purpose of these formal apologies is to contribute 
to healing and justice, and to provide an opportunity for 
survivors’ personal experiences to be heard and 
acknowledged.
Regional connections 
A comprehensive review was undertaken of local health 
councils and advisory committees across NSW. In 
February 2022, a report was published, outlining the 
development of new guiding principles to support 
the reinvigoration of local health committees across 
NSW. Extensive stakeholder consultation was integral 
to the development of the report.
Implementation and monitoring of the guiding principles 
is ongoing across all regional local health districts to 
strengthen local health committees.


NSW Health	
Annual Report 2022–23   :  Operations and Performance  :  page 23
The Regional Health Division continued to support local 
health districts to strengthen their committees by 
building connections, sharing insights and partnering 
for capability development across the system.
Communicating on priority 
health issues
Health Protection NSW worked closely with the NSW 
Ministry of Health’s Strategic Communications and 
Engagement team on opportunities to share key 
messages to the NSW public.
A Behavioural Science and Communications Advisory 
Group was convened to bring together experts to 
discuss relevant public health topics. Improving 
influenza vaccination coverage in children under five 
years was the first topic. Actions from the meeting 
included updating the NSW Immunisation Schedule, 
liaising with Aboriginal Medical Services and 
contributing to Yarn Up, a question and answer session 
with, and for, Aboriginal communities with experts 
hosted on the NSW Health Facebook. 
In partnership with the Aboriginal Health and Medical 
Research Council, the Agency for Clinical Innovation 
hosted an Aboriginal Chronic Conditions Conference 
on 14 June 2023. More than half of the 450 attendees 
identified as an Aboriginal peoples. Attendees heard 
from 28 speakers and expert panel members 
showcasing key learnings on the theme Aboriginal 
Workforce and Chronic Care Models.
The Winter Respiratory public health communications 
campaign launched on 9 May and ran until 31 August 
2023. 
The campaign targeted parents and carers of children 
six months to under five years (including culturally and 
linguistically diverse and Aboriginal communities), 
pregnant women, and all Aboriginal people from six 
months. These audience groups were entitled to the 
Commonwealth-funded influenza vaccine. The general 
population between 16 and 39 years were also targeted 
with hygiene and ‘stay at home if unwell’ messaging.
The campaign used the results of focus testing (with 
pregnant women and parents, including culturally and 
linguistically diverse communities and Aboriginal people) 
to inform the creative. 
By mid-August, the campaign had generated 20 million 
impressions. The campaign was also supported by 
organic social media and stakeholder engagement.
A clinician working group was created to identify new 
strategies to support clinicians in sharing public health 
messaging. A range of materials and resources were 
developed with the working group including:
•	influenza vaccination safety data resources 
•	the NSW weekly respiratory report for COVID-19 
and influenza 
•	hard copy promotional material for pharmacies 
and GPs to promote influenza vaccination.

Virtual care
Progressing the NSW Virtual Care Strategy 
The NSW Virtual Care Strategy 2021-2026 supports 
timely access to care by increasing capacity and 
expanding virtual care, such as telehealth, video 
conferencing and remote patient monitoring. This will 
deliver service benefits that increase effective and 
efficient care delivery, reduce potentially preventable 
hospitalisations, reduce length of hospital stays and 
improve system integration between primary care and 
acute care.
The NSW Ministry of Health worked with partners across 
the system to embed sustainable, safe, effective and 
efficient models of care to further support the delivery 
of the NSW Virtual Care Strategy. 
A Virtual Care Services Implementation Guide was 
developed to provide consistent statewide guidance 
about best practice principles and enable a coordinated, 
consistent and integrated approach to implementing 
virtual care services.
A six-month pilot was commenced to expand the 
existing Virtual Rural Generalist Service into selected 
sites across Southern New South Wales Local Health 
District. The highly successful model provides specialist 
advice and 24/7 rural medical support. 
The virtualKIDS Urgent Care Service was launched 
to help prevent children having to attend an emergency 
department and to support providing care closer 
to home. The service provides care through 
videoconferencing and a 24/7 hotline, connecting 
families with a clinical nurse to provide an assessment 
before they get to hospital and to determine the best 
care pathway and care provider based on each child’s 
needs. The service is accessed by calling HealthDirect.
Sharing the message
NSW Health continues to raise awareness, address 
misconceptions, and promote the benefits of virtual 
care amongst patients, carers, families and communities 
across NSW, as well as the staff and clinicians 
working in or with NSW Health.
To build on the consistent messaging and resources 
developed in previous years, the NSW Ministry of 
Health collaborated with partners across the system 
and externally to develop targeted communications for 
priority populations, including culturally and 
linguistically diverse and Aboriginal and Torres Strait 
Islander communities. The Ministry continues to work 
closely with local health districts and specialty health 
networks to address their communication needs and 
have developed materials for local adaptation.
More than 19,000 people visited the NSW Health virtual 
care website in 2022-23, with more than 42,000 visiting 
the site since it launched in January 2021. The website 
includes information about virtual care, such as how it 
works and the benefits, plus more than 25 patient, 
carer and clinician stories about their experiences of 
virtual care. 
Projects to build support for virtual care with local 
health districts and clinicians have focused on 
streamlined and consistent communications and 
engagement. To support this, a virtual care newsletter 
was developed and sent to more than 500 partners 
across NSW Health. 
Understanding the virtual experience
The Bureau of Health Information continued to survey 
patients about their experiences of virtual care, resulting 
in datasets and insights that are unique in Australia. 
This provided clinicians and health system managers 
with the second year of Virtual Care Survey results, as 
well as new modules in other surveys covering adult 
admitted patients and outpatient cancer clinics. 
The resulting insights, for example, that approximately 
9 out of 10 patients rated their virtual outpatient care 
in 2022 as very good or good, have played a key role in 
communicating the value of new care models among 
both patients and clinicians, as well as informing the 
evaluation of the NSW Virtual Care Strategy 2021–2026.
Referring patients to care
Initially established in response to the COVID-19 
pandemic, the Virtual Clinical Care Centre has continued 
to evolve to meet community needs, particularly for 
non-emergency responses. There were more than 
46,000 secondary triage incidents in 2022-23 with more 
than 20% successfully referred. This equates to freeing 
up 917 paramedic crews over their 12-hour shift to 
respond to emergency incidents, ultimately improving 
patient safety and operational performance.
Telestroke
The NSW Telestroke Service provided specialist stroke 
care to patients in rural and regional NSW, connecting 
local emergency physicians with 24/7 access to expert 
stroke clinicians using virtual care. 
The program rollout was completed in December 2022 
and was scaled to 23 rural and regional hospitals in 
NSW. The service supported communication across 
hospital and local health district boundaries, and its 
screen-sharing and collaboration functions enable 
remote viewing of electronic medical records, real time 
scanning review of images and live patient assessment. 


NSW Health	
Annual Report 2022–23   :  Operations and Performance  :  page 27
The service has improved health outcomes and provided 
lifesaving consultations for more than 4,000 stroke 
patients in regional and rural NSW. The NSW Telestroke 
Service won two 2022 NSW Health Awards, in the 
Patient Safety First category, and won the Secretary’s 
Award for Integrated Value Based Care, along with key 
partners: the Agency for Clinical Innovation, South 
Eastern Sydney Local Health District, eHealth NSW and 
the NSW Ministry of Health. 
Community Single Front Door helps patients
NSW Health has partnered with Healthdirect to launch 
the Community Single Front Door initiative, a program 
that aims to healthcare services more accessible and 
easier to navigate, by providing a single, dedicated, 24/7 
point of contact for non-life-threatening healthcare 
needs. For cases requiring immediate attention, the 
nurse triage team connects patients to statewide virtual 
care services, including Virtual GP and Virtual KIDS. The 
service has been functional over the last 12 months, and 
has helped connect over 321,218 callers with clinical 
advice and alternate service providers. More than 
39,000 people were referred to Virtual GP and Virtual 
KIDS consultations, and approximately 65% of people 
who were intending to present to an emergency 
department were assessed and triaged to appropriate 
non-emergency department care. It has led to an 8% 
decrease in Healthdirect callers being referred to 
emergency departments, amounting to approximately 
between 80-120 patients a day across NSW. The Service 
was also a critical support initiative for healthcare 
access during the NSW flood crises.
myVirtualCare
The myVirtualCare videoconferencing platform 
provided patients in NSW with a seamless and 
convenient way to access their clinical and social care 
providers using one web link on any internet-enabled 
device. myVirtualCare supported patients to access a 
variety of services from anywhere in the state, including 
cancer care, palliative care, nutrition and dietetics, 
pain, mental health, chronic and complex care, and 
speech and rehabilitation services. 
At the end of the 2022-23 financial year, more than 
121,100 clinicians had been trained to use myVirtualCare 
and more than 30,700 clinicians provided care using 
the platform. This resulted in more than 395,000 
virtual consultations occurring across 129 established 
virtual consultation rooms. 
A survey of more than 25,000 consumers who have 
experienced virtual care and the myVirtualCare platform 
showed very positive responses. 
This included 96% 
of respondents saying the virtual care they received was 
very good or good, and 79% saying their virtual care 
experience was better or the same as an in-person 
appointment.
Strengthening access for rural, 
regional and remote NSW
NSW Regional Health Strategic 
Plan 2022-2032 
The Regional Health Division developed the NSW 
Regional Health Strategic Plan 2022-2032, a blueprint 
for the future provision of health services that 
understands and celebrates, the diverse and unique 
nature of regional communities.
The plan, published in February 2023, aligns closely 
with Future Health. Extensive consultation was 
undertaken at every stage of the plan’s development 
and included face-to-face and virtual workshops, a 
survey, written submissions and responses from the 
NSW Government’s Have Your Say platform. 
Response to the NSW Parliamentary Inquiry
The Regional Health Division coordinated the 
government response to the NSW Parliamentary Inquiry 
into health outcomes and access to health and hospital 
services in rural, regional and remote NSW. The 
response was tabled in parliament on 1 September 2022.
NSW Health branches, pillars and agencies are 
responsible for delivering on the actions to implement 
each recommendation.
The Regional Health Division coordinates the monitoring 
and reporting on the actions against the Inquiry 
recommendations and an Independent Review to 
assess progress.
Reducing the financial burden 
The Isolated Patients Travel and Accommodation 
Assistance Scheme, known as IPTAAS, can help 
to reduce the financial burden on people who need to 
travel long distances to access specialist healthcare.
On 1 August 2022, enhancements were made to the 
scheme, including the expansion of the eligibility criteria 
to include high-risk foot services, non-commercial 
clinical trials, ocularists and publicly funded oral health 
clinics. In 2022-23, IPTAAS helped 32,700 patients, 
which is an additional 9,500 patients compared to the 
previous financial year. 
Subsidy rates for private vehicle travel also increased 
from 22 to 40 cents per kilometre and reimbursement 
for accommodation has almost doubled. 


NSW Health	
Annual Report 2022–23   :  Operations and Performance   :  page 28
NSW Health is continuing to promote the scheme 
and streamline the IPTAAS application process to make 
it easier for patients to lodge claims.
Support nursing practice in rural 
and regional areas
NSW Health published Rural Nurse Practitioners, 
a framework for service and training. The framework 
provides guidance for the delivery of accessible, 
person-centred care that addresses the needs of rural 
communities. 
In 2022-23, 45 nurse practitioner positions, including 
20 rural generalist nurse practitioner positions, were 
funded across rural local health districts.
Rural Nursing Pathways in Practice is a statewide 
framework launched in 2022 to support rural nursing 
practice. The pathway is a collection of customised 
professional development opportunities and has been 
implemented in six rural local health districts. In 2022-
23, nurses completed more than 14,000 rural nursing 
e-learning modules.
Remote Hepatitis C Prescribing Program 
The Centre for Population Health partnered with the 
Australasian Society for HIV, Viral Hepatitis and Sexual 
Health Medicine to deliver the Remote Hepatitis C 
Prescribing Program. The Program links Hepatitis C 
prescribers in rural, remote, and regional areas and other 
settings where access to treatment may be limited. 
Medications that can be supplied by registered nurses 
in publicly funded sexual health services were expanded 
in February 2023 to include post and pre-exposure 
prophylaxis (PEP/PrEP) HIV medications and syphilis 
treatments.
Albury Wodonga Health Intergovernmental 
Agreement 2022-2035
NSW Health signed a new Intergovernmental Agreement 
with the Victorian Department of Health regarding 
the operation of Albury Wodonga Health. While the 
unique cross-border service is operated by Victoria, 
under the new agreement, both states now have 
strategic oversight to ensure representation on behalf 
of all local residents. 
The agreement ensures financial arrangements are fit 
for purpose and initiates work to improve performance 
reporting and monitoring and supporting data systems. 
The agreement also enables NSW to drive infrastructure 
improvements at Albury Base Hospital.

Mental Health Virtual 
Clinical Pharmacy Project 
Mental Health Pharmacists face many challenges 
and are tasked with a multitude of duties to ensure 
safe and best practices in medication management.
The Mental Health Virtual Clinical Pharmacy 
Project was developed to provide three mental 
health units in Tamworth, Manning and Maitland 
hospitals, without onsite mental health clinical 
pharmacists, access to virtual clinical pharmacy 
services. 
The project provides beneficial healthcare 
interventions for mental health patients and 
acknowledges the crucial role of pharmacists in 
patient care.

Pharmacy
Supporting pharmacies to improve 
patient access in the primary care setting
In November 2022, the NSW Government announced 
pharmacy reforms to increase the community’s access 
to primary care services, including an increase to the 
vaccines available at local pharmacies from 6 to 12. 


NSW Health	
Annual Report 2022–23   :  Operations and Performance  :  page 29
Following an expression of interest process in early 
2023, a University of Newcastle-led research consortium 
was awarded a $3 million grant to design, implement 
and evaluate a clinical trial to assess the effectiveness 
of pharmacy management of uncomplicated urinary 
tract infections. 
In February 2023, the NSW Government announced an 
expansion of the clinical trial to include the provision of 
oral contraception and the management of mild skin 
conditions. An additional grant for $3 million was 
awarded to the University of Newcastle to incorporate 
these components into the existing trial framework. 
In May 2023, a small feasibility study commenced with 
94 randomly selected pharmacies to test the processes 
and systems in place for pharmacy management of 
uncomplicated urinary tract infections, prior to the full 
rollout to more than 1,000 pharmacies across NSW in 
July 2023. The NSW Government also announced 
patients would not need to pay to see a pharmacist 
participating in the trial and $20 would be paid per 
consultation to participating pharmacies to support 
administration associated with the trial. The feasibility 
study demonstrated significant community interest in 
the trial, with nearly 939 consultations in nine weeks.
The NSW Government also partnered with the ACT 
Government to allow up to five pharmacies located in 
the ACT to participate in the NSW clinical trial, to 
provide convenience and consistency for residents of 
NSW located in areas close to the ACT border. 
Keeping medication safe
SafeScript NSW continued to provide NSW Health 
prescribers and pharmacists with access to real-time 
information about a patient’s prescribing and dispensing 
history for certain high-risk medicines, from anywhere 
in the state. This information helps prescribers and 
pharmacists to make safer clinical decisions and 
reduces the incidence of harm, including death, from 
the unsafe use of monitored medicines. 
Delivered by eHealth NSW in partnership with the NSW 
Ministry of Health, SafeScript NSW’s uptake was strong 
and health practitioners reported finding it to be a helpful 
clinical tool. More than 22,000 health practitioners 
registered for the system in the 2022-23 financial year.
Reducing hospitalisations
Urgent Care Services 
The Urgent Care Services Program commenced in 
August 2022 to reduce pressure on emergency 
departments and to increase capacity to provide urgent 
care services to the community. 
An Urgent Care Service is a health service that provides 
short-term, one-off episodes of care for urgent but 
non-life-threatening health care needs and is not an 
emergency department.
In partnership with local health districts, primary health 
networks, Healthdirect and multiple divisions across the 
NSW Ministry of Health, the NSW Government is 
continuing the investment to deliver 25 Urgent Care 
Services by 2025.
Out of Hospital Care Program
This strategy is also effective for freeing up acute 
and sub-acute beds to assist with patient flow. 
The program delivers packages of case management 
and home supports including ComPacks (non clinical 
packages of case management and home care services 
for patients being discharged from a NSW public 
hospital), Safe and Supported at Home, and End of Life 
packages. These can provide eligible patients with 
immediate access to care when being discharged from 
NSW public hospitals or when a person is identified at 
risk of an avoidable admission. 
In the 2022-23 financial year the program used the 
more than $50 million budget to deliver 25,005 
packages, including:
•	14,317 ComPacks 
•	5,733 Safe and Supported at Home packages
•	4,955 End of Life packages
Reducing the risk of hospitalisation 
The risk of hospitalisation algorithm helps to predict 
whether a person is likely to have an unplanned admission 
to hospital in the next 12 months. This is then used to 
identify people who would benefit from care coordination 
through Planned Care for Better Health to help prevent 
hospitalisation. 
Planned Care for Better Health provides care 
coordination to people with chronic conditions who are 
at risk of further hospitalisation. In the 2022-23 financial 
year, 10,255 people were enrolled in a Planned Care 
for Better Health service across all local health districts 
and speciality health networks in NSW.
Emergency Department 
to Community Initiative
The Emergency Department to Community Initiative 
provides tailored intensive case management and 
multidisciplinary case review to support patients 
under the age of 70 who have been identified as 
frequent presenters to emergency departments. 


NSW Health	
Annual Report 2022–23   :  Operations and Performance   :  page 30
The initiative has been implemented across the NSW 
Health System and more than 741 people received 
care from the Emergency Department to Community 
team in 2022-23.
Statewide Referral Criteria
The Statewide Referral Criteria are clinical decision-
support tools that give health professionals the criteria 
they need to refer their patients to public specialist 
outpatient services across NSW. The first series of 
criteria were developed in 2022-23 for selected 
ophthalmology and gastroenterology conditions.
Improving patient flow
Onboarding more paramedics 
In 2022-23, NSW Ambulance successfully onboarded 
more than 500 additional paramedics, in line with the 
State-wide Infrastructure Team recruitment targets. 
This has led to a permanent enhancement to the rosters 
for 30 stations and improved ambulance response times, 
staff wellbeing and created a positive change to the 
critical care landscape. 
The onboarding of more paramedics and construction 
of new ambulance stations will further improve these 
outcomes. 
Getting real time information
Patient Transport Service real time dashboards are 
currently being used by service operational teams to 
enhance real time decision capabilities and address 
patient flow priorities across the system. The dashboard 
provides a real-time depiction of capacity and vehicles 
remaining on scene to enable better resource utilisation, 
improved transparency, timely escalation and mitigation 
of risk to reduce strain on NSW Ambulance and local 
health districts. 
Working together
Established in 2022-23, the Patient Flow Portal working 
group provides oversight, strategic direction and advice 
around all matters relating to the Patient Flow Portal 
and the Patient Flow Systems Framework. The working 
group ensures NSW Health has the best enterprise 
solutions to manage care coordination and patient flow 
across the system. 
Establishment of statewide 
system flow function
In June 2023, NSW Ministry of Health System Flow 
Officers were permanently recruited to monitor 
ambulance arrivals at hospitals and assist with the 
coordination of whole-of-system patient flow. These 
roles are supported by the NSW Health executive to 
ensure 24/7 support is available for the health system, 
providing a liaison point between the NSW Ministry 
of Health, NSW Ambulance, local health districts and 
networks. The system flow function monitors and 
escalates transfer of care delays and capacity of 
neonatal intensive care units across NSW, and actions 
ambulance adjustment requests in periods of peak 
demand. 
Keeping patients safe
NSW Ambulance delivers initiatives to aid the delivery 
of safe, high quality and reliable care for patients in the 
home, community and virtual settings, including a virtual 
secondary triage model and streamlined and integrated 
referral pathways. 
Mechanical CPR devices were rolled out to all NSW 
Ambulance frontline units to improve clinical outcomes 
for out-of-hospital cardiac arrests.
The Clinical Device and Notification Platform pilot was 
implemented in partnership with eHealth NSW, NSW 
Ambulance, the Agency for Clinical Innovation and the 
NSW Ministry of Health at Illawarra Shoalhaven Local 
Health District. The program replaces existing 
transmitting monitor/defibrillators and the notification 
platform that sends electrocardiograms (ECGs) from 
ambulances and smaller hospitals to specialists. This 
will improve patient care at the point of treatment and 
provide better outcomes and access to specialist advice 
for regional patients.
NSW Health Pathology continued to improve and 
promote its Akuna Electronic Specimen Tracking System 
which provides real-time tracking of specimens between 
NSW Health Pathology laboratory locations across 
NSW to help keep every precious sample safe. Akuna 
shows users where all specimens are at any time, 
provides alerts for overdue items and uses other 
extensive reporting capabilities to troubleshoot and 
manage workload and resourcing. 
Patient data
Integrated Care Outcomes Database
To support the ongoing monitoring and evaluation of 
integrated care initiatives, the Integrated Care Outcomes 
Database is linked to hospital, emergency, ambulance, 
perinatal and births, deaths and marriages data. 
In early 2023, the definition of the enrolled cohort linked 
in the database was expanded to capture a range of 
value-based healthcare initiatives in addition to the 
NSW Integrated Care Strategy. This has reduced the 
data collection and linkage burden and maximised the 
utility of the linked data. 


NSW Health	
Annual Report 2022–23   :  Operations and Performance  :  page 31
This information is used to support continuous quality 
improvement to improve the engagement of patients 
who require integrated care services. To support local 
services and the NSW Ministry of Health monitor the 
performance of the Planned Care for Better Health 
Initiative, an operational dashboard in the Patient Flow 
Portal was launched. It includes information about 
enrolments and performance trends, and is being rolled 
out across all local health districts and speciality health 
networks. 
Clinical Health Information Exchange 
The Clinical Health Information Exchange is a patient 
centric clinical repository that provides clinicians 
with access to aggregated information about their 
patient’s health history. In 2022-23, the exchange 
continued to be successfully implemented across the 
state’s local health districts. 
It was viewed 326,287 times by NSW Health staff 
throughout the 2022-23 financial year and is one 
of the key enablers for the upcoming healthcare 
transformation program, the Single Digital Patient 
Record.
MedSync 
eHealth NSW developed the MedSync platform to help 
clinicians securely share clinical information, upload 
images and collaborate easily on the go. The platform 
was made available to more than 110,000 clinical staff, 
supporting the delivery of virtual clinical collaboration 
across multiple settings statewide.
Reporting for Better Cancer Outcomes
Through the Reporting for Better Cancer Outcomes 
program, Cancer Institute NSW provided actionable data 
insights to the NSW Health system to support service 
planning, design and care delivery. 
The program focused on reducing variation of clinical 
care, improving patient experience, better responding 
to emerging issues, and reducing inequalities in access 
and outcomes for priority populations. 
In the 2022-23 financial year, 86 reports were delivered, 
including the inaugural patient-reported measures for 
people affected by cancer and lung optimal care 
pathway reports, and the second Reporting for Better 
Cancer Outcomes for Aboriginal People report.
Using data to support patients 
with severe trauma
The Agency for Clinical Innovation partnered with 
eHealth NSW to co-design a prototype for a single state 
level electronic Clinical Quality Registry for trauma, 
connected to existing electronic medical records. 
This will assist in the identification of areas of trauma 
care that could be improved for future patients. The 
partnership saw the development of a prototype with 
conceptual wireframes and modules to enable 
automated data extraction, intended to minimise the 
burden of manual data entry on clinicians and teams. 
Electronic Record for Intensive Care
The Electronic Record for Intensive Care is a state-of-
the-art clinical information system which improves the 
safety and quality of care offered to critically ill patients 
in intensive care units. It replaces almost all paper charts 
and forms for adult, neonatal and paediatric intensive 
care units across NSW. More than 65,000 patients have 
benefitted from better quality and safer care.
In 2022-23, the Electronic Record for Intensive Care 
Neonatal Intensive Care Unit implementation was 
completed by eHealth NSW at the Nepean Hospital 
pilot site. The system was also implemented at an 
additional four sites: Royal North Shore Hospital, 
Royal Hospital for Women, Liverpool Hospital and John 
Hunter Hospital. The electronic record integrates patient 
data every minute from multiple systems and devices, 
supporting better clinical decision-making. 
Statewide Initiative for 
Diabetes Management
Diabetes represents a significant and complex public 
health challenge in NSW and Australia. The condition 
is associated with a range of health complications, 
affecting approximately 1 in 11 individuals aged over 
16 years in NSW. Moreover, the prevalence of diabetes 
is increasing, necessitating a concerted effort to 
address this issue through an integrated and 
coordinated approach.
In response, NSW Health partnered with NSW Primary 
Health Networks to develop the Statewide Initiative for 
Diabetes Management. Throughout 2022-23, local health 
districts worked together with their respective primary 
health networks and other partners to adopt a one 
health system approach. This led to identifying priority 
areas and population groups within each region and 
collaboratively developing, implementing and monitoring 
locally relevant strategies to address these priorities 
which will continue into future years.
In addition to local efforts, a statewide governance 
structure was established to oversee four workstreams 
that will develop, implement and scale systemwide 
enablers and solutions to address key areas of the 
initiative. It has brought together healthcare 
professionals from various sectors, alongside individuals 
with lived experience of diabetes.

By aligning efforts at both the local and statewide 
levels, NSW Health strives to address the diabetes 
challenge, improve patient outcomes and experience, 
and deliver better value care.
Preparing for future care needs
Effective and sustainable solutions
A Guide for Early Options Development and Analysis in 
Service Planning was approved and released to NSW 
Heath organisations as part of the 2023 capital 
investment planning process. The guide aims to improve 
the rigour, approach, consistency and documentation of 
options analysis by local health districts and specialty 
health networks earlier in the planning process. This will 
ensure the most effective and sustainable solutions are 
proposed for funding consideration. In 2023, districts 
and networks were required to demonstrate that they 
have investigated, consulted on and analysed a range of 
options before recommending their preferred option.
To uplift system capability to perform early options 
analysis, health economics experts were engaged to 
co-design a training workshop for health service 
planners across NSW Health. The training was delivered 
in April 2023 to participants from across 20 health 
organisations and received positive feedback. 
The revised capital investment proposal template was 
issued in March 2023. The updated template aimed to 
assist health entities to develop proposals and included 
revised sections on service planning and recurrent cost 
impacts to improve the quality of submissions. 
Enhancing our capital works program
Health Infrastructure established a new Program 
Performance and Assurance function to centralise and 
enhance its capital works program assurance, 
governance, support and reporting. Project governance 
for the capital program has been updated for 
implementation in 2023-24. 
Implementation of a new project data analytics platform 
is providing improved real-time reporting on capital 
program performance to drive more informed and 
data-driven decision making across the program. The 
reporting, together with continued development of 
Project Toolkit guidance and documentation, is working 
to facilitate more strategic, efficient and consistent 
delivery of the capital program and embed NSW 
Health’s Facility Planning Process.

results by expanding localised direct access colonoscopy 
services in public hospitals. There are now 19 services in 
NSW, an increase of six over the previous year.
The Institute worked alongside key stakeholders to 
support increased access to hypofractionated 
radiotherapy for women with early-stage breast cancer. 
This supports patients’ improved quality of life and 
health outcomes by reducing side effects for patients. 
More than 90% of radiation therapy courses delivered in 
NSW public facilities are hypofractionated.
Supporting access to cancer 
multidisciplinary teams
Cancer Institute NSW supported people to access 
high-quality cancer care services through Canrefer, an 
online directory of cancer specialists, multidisciplinary 
cancer care teams and treatment centres. This year, 
Canrefer was accessed by 155,439 users seeking 
referrals to specialists working in multidisciplinary 
cancer care teams.
Building skills and capabilities 
of cancer care professionals
Cancer Institute NSW supported best practice cancer 
care through the expansion of eviQ, an online resource 
providing evidence-based, peer-reviewed cancer 
treatment protocols and information. In 2022-23, eviQ 
users increased by 36% to more than 1.2 million users.
In October 2022, the eviQ program published the 
International Consensus Guideline for Anticancer Drug 
Dosing in Kidney Dysfunction, a supportive decision-
making tool for clinicians. 
The guideline provides a transparent and standardised 
global approach to manage dosing in a complex patient 
population. eviQ also developed several complementary 
clinical resources to assist users in adopting the 
guideline recommendations, including calculators and 
eLearning, and is updating related information and 
treatment protocols to reflect the guideline 
recommendations.
eviQ Education supports the rapid uptake of emerging 
evidence into clinical practice and provides online 
education for oncology professionals. In the 2022-23 
financial year, the platform had more than 143,000 
users, an increase of 14% from 2021-22. 
Supporting communities affected by cancer
In 2022-23, Cancer Institute NSW grants supported 2,500 
community members from 29 different language and 
cultural groups to receive education about cervical, breast 
and bowel cancer screening and healthy modifiable 
behaviours to prevent cancers. More than 125 community 
education sessions were delivered over this time.
Cancer Institute NSW also provided training to 37 bilingual 
community educators and cultural support workers to 
deliver ongoing training sessions. These aimed to increase 
multicultural communities’ awareness and uptake of the 
three national screening programs, and healthy 
lifestyle habits to help prevent cancer. 
Fifteen new multicultural community education 
grants were awarded to government and non-
government agencies to deliver future community 
education sessions.
Cancer Institute NSW also undertook the Refugee 
Cancer Screening Project, which aims to improve cancer 
screening awareness in refugee communities from the 
Middle East and Sub-Sahara Africa through capacity-
building, research and community engagement. This 
year, 17 community consultations were held involving 
more than 160 people who provided feedback on 
barriers, including systemic and cultural issues, 
impacting community participation in cancer screening. 
Ongoing funding was provided by Cancer Institute 
NSW to cover pathology costs of cervical screening 
tests undertaken by women’s health nurses, who 
generally work in publicly funded clinics in rural and 
regional areas. These nurses use innovative outreach 
models to help to engage women experiencing barriers 
to cervical screening. 
Supporting sexuality and gender diverse 
communities at risk of and affected by cancer
Cancer Institute NSW and ACON have a multi-year 
partnership to improve cancer screening participation, 
and reduce cancer risk for sexuality and gender diverse 
(LGBTIQ+) people in NSW through community 
engagement, targeted health promotion and inclusive 
practice training for the cancer sector.
In 2022-23, this collaboration delivered targeted cervical 
screening and smoking cessation campaigns and 
tailored eLearning on inclusive practice for BreastScreen 
NSW, Quitline, Cancer Institute NSW staff and cancer 
service workers.

Supporting people impacted 
by Violence, Abuse and Neglect
Standardising our approach to 
early evidence collection
NSW Health provides 24/7 integrated psychosocial, 
medical and forensic crisis responses to adult and child 
victims of sexual assault through a network of specialist 
Sexual Assault Services, delivered in more than 60 
locations in metropolitan, regional and rural sites. In 
2022-23, NSW Health finalised and implemented a 
statewide standardised approach to Early Evidence 
Collection, which is the process of self-collecting 
forensic or toxicology samples when a comprehensive 
medical and forensic examination is delayed or not 
appropriate. The new Early Evidence Kits, guidelines and 
accompanying training program are now operational in 
all 15 local health districts.
Pathways to providing trauma-informed care
Development of a suite of Violence, Abuse and Neglect 
Health Pathways to support general practitioners to 
provide trauma-informed, integrated responses and 
referral to people experiencing sexual assault, domestic 
and family violence, and child abuse and neglect. The 
NSW Ministry of Health and South West Sydney Primary 
Health Network have partnered to deliver the project. 
All 10 NSW primary health network regions will be able 
to upload or adapt these HealthPathways for their 
local contexts. Three Pathways are now live, including 
domestic and family violence, perpetrators of domestic 
violence and physical assault and injury recording.
NSW Health Pathology
NSW Health Pathology began work on a 10-year 
statewide service blueprint, Pathology 2035, which 
examines long-term sustainable approaches to 
delivering public pathology services.
It partnered with five regional local health districts to 
begin adding a new point of care testing device, the 
PixCell Hemoscreen, to 30 hospitals without on-site 
pathology labs. It expanded point of care testing to 
support hospital in the home, emergency department 
in the home and geriatric flying squads. 
It also supported health screening programs including 
the Hunter New England Local Health District medibus 
clinic-on-wheels that brings diabetes care to vulnerable 
communities and the Pasifika Preventing Diabetes 
Program.
NSW Health Pathology assembled a team to design its 
new statewide laboratory information management 
system. It also launched the Pathworks mobile app for 
clinicians at Northern Sydney and Port Macquarie. The 
app lets clinicians reliably, securely and conveniently 
access patient test results when they are on the move.
Telematics were installed in pathology courier vehicles 
to monitor vehicle location, driver behaviour, engine 
diagnostics and activity, and route efficiency was 
enhanced and driver safety improved with the use of 
personal duress alarms.
Agency for Clinical Innovation
Standardising care for people with Long COVID
The Agency for Clinical Innovation published the Long 
COVID Model of Care outlining a standardised approach 
to caring for people with Long COVID across care 
settings. The model was developed in consultation with 
the Long COVID Clinical Expert Reference Taskforce and 
describes the different stages of care and the different 
settings where care can be delivered, depending on a 
person’s needs. 
Improving paediatric rehabilitation in NSW
The Agency for Clinical Innovation published the 
Paediatric Rehabilitation: Minimum Standards and Toolkit 
to improve the coordination of paediatric rehabilitation, 
in response to recommendation 50 of the review of 
health services for children, young people and families 
within the NSW Health system. The toolkit has been 
developed for use by clinicians in paediatric 
rehabilitation services and local health districts, 
as well as families who access these services.
Standardising nurse-initiated emergency care
Emergency Care Assessment and Treatment is a 
statewide, co-designed project that aims to standardise 
nurse-initiated emergency care. The Agency for Clinical 
Innovation collaborated with system leaders and 
clinicians to develop 73 clinical protocols, an education 
pathway to enable nurses with the relevant knowledge 
and skills to transition to using the protocols, and an 
implementation toolkit to support local health districts 
and specialty health networks implement the protocols.

Centre for Alcohol and Other Drugs
As part of NSW Health’s commitment to Close the gap for 
Aboriginal people, in 2022-23 the NSW Ministry of Health 
Centre for Alcohol and Other Drugs established 
collaborative arrangements with key Aboriginal 
stakeholders to assist in the design of new alcohol and 
other drugs services, including post-custodial support, 
multidisciplinary hubs and initiatives to enhance and 
expand the Aboriginal alcohol and other drugs workforce.
In addition, the centre has quarantined grant funding for 
Aboriginal Community Controlled Organisations to deliver 
post-custodial support services and new multidisciplinary 
hub services, prioritising rural and regional areas. 
The centre has also partnered with the Department of 
Communities and Justice to deliver diversion programs. 
Sites for the statewide expansion of the Magistrate’s Early 
Referral into Treatment and the expansion of the Drug 
Court Program into Dubbo this year were prioritised based 
on rural and regional locations and high Aboriginal 
populations. As part of the Dubbo Drug Court expansion, 
NSW Health joined the Cultural Safety Framework 
committee and participated in a community education and 
question and answer session hosted by the Wellington 
Aboriginal Corporation Health Service.
The centre continued to work with the broader alcohol and 
other drug sector to establish outcome measures across 
their services which will incorporate these measures for 
Aboriginal people. 
Throughout 2022-23, the centre also collaborated with the 
Aboriginal Health and Medical Research Council on 
priorities to reduce the incidence of fetal alcohol spectrum 
disorder. In particular, it worked to support the Council in 
growing confidence within the workforce around 
conversations with Aboriginal women about alcohol use in 
pregnancy and raising awareness of fetal alcohol 
spectrum disorder within the Aboriginal community.
The YourRoom website has been updated to include fact 
sheets, videos, podcasts and other resources about fetal 
alcohol spectrum disorder.
Dashboards and Insights

Cultural safety
The Agency for Clinical Innovation continued to scale the 
Finding Your Way - Shared Decision Making Model, a 
holistic two-way process that helps guide shared decision 
making between Aboriginal people and their healthcare 
providers, so Aboriginal people can feel safe and trusted 
to make informed decisions based on their values and 
beliefs. The agency identified ten capabilities required to 
use the shared decision-making resources for Aboriginal 
people in Australia and developed a learning map to 
reflect the Aboriginal eight Ways of Learning.
Aboriginal Family Wellbeing and Violence 
Prevention Program
The Aboriginal Family Wellbeing and Violence Prevention 
Program seeks to prevent and respond to violence, abuse 
and neglect through a range of prevention, early 
intervention, tertiary and recovery services. Through the 
National Partnership Agreement on Family, Domestic and 
Sexual Violence Responses 2021-23, additional funding 
was provided to program workers to organise men’s and 
women’s camps to raise awareness of family and sexual 
violence and to contribute to healing, develop local 
resources for men’s and women’s groups and to 
implement community development activities. This has 
supported and built further capacity for Aboriginal 
communities to prevent and respond to violence, abuse 
and neglect.
Towards Zero Suicides 
As part of the Zero Suicides in Care initiative, the Agency 
for Clinical Innovation published a guide for developing a 
local suicide care pathway to support local health districts 
and specialty health networks to review current 
approaches and align to best practice. The Agency for 
Clinical Innovation partnered with Illawarra Shoalhaven 
Local Health District to develop and implement a local 
adult suicide care pathway.
Mental Health and suicide prevention
NSW Ambulance is committed to actively contributing 
towards the zero suicides goal. The service is 
collaborating with the NSW Ministry of Health Mental 
Health Branch and local health districts to formalise a 
referral pathway to the Mental Health Line and pilot 
innovative service delivery models. An example of one 
of those models is the Mental Health First Responder, a 
collaboration with Hunter New England Local Health 
District, to deliver patient-centred care to patients 
experiencing a mental health crisis who call Triple Zero 
(000). 
NSW Ambulance also undertook a comprehensive 
review of protocols and clinical practice guidelines 
relating to mental health management, including 
strengthening suicide risk assessment tools. 
Safeguards
Safeguard Teams provide a mental health rapid 
response service for children and young people in crisis, 
and their families. New Safeguards Teams have been 
established across NSW, with the Agency for Clinical 
Innovation providing redesign and change capability to 
support successful implementation of Safeguard 
models of care in local health districts.
Aboriginal Community Resilience
The Aboriginal Mental Health Models of Care initiative 
provided 12 grants to local health districts and 
Aboriginal Community Controlled Health Services. The 
grant recipients represent rural, remote and 
metropolitan based services in NSW. Proposals included 
projects with shared employment models, workforce 
development, clinical service delivery and care 
navigation. Evaluation of the program began in July 
2023, with the preference for an Aboriginal-led 
evaluator or organisation to undertake the work.
The Building on Aboriginal Community Resilience 
initiative has expanded the Towards Zero Suicide 
program to 25 sites across NSW, with 12 new grant 
recipients commencing in 2023. The new sites provide 
suicide prevention programs, workshops and workforce 
initiatives to local Aboriginal communities
The NSW Aboriginal Mental Health and Wellbeing 
Strategy 2020-25 implementation continues, with local 
health district and specialty health networks completing 
implementation plans and submitting annual reports in 
2023. The endorsement of the monitoring and reporting 
framework was completed in 2022 with the 
establishment of the NSW Aboriginal Mental Health and 
Wellbeing Steering Committee. Yulang Indigenous 
Evaluation is undertaking the evaluation of the Strategy 
with a mid-term report completed in 2023.
Mother and Baby Unit
Health Infrastructure continued to progress the 
$669.8 million Statewide Mental Health Infrastructure 
Program to support delivery of mental healthcare 
reform across NSW. 
In 2022-23, the Mother and Baby Unit at the Westmead 
Health Precinct was completed. Facilities were 
co-designed with women with lived experiences of 
mental illness, their families and clinicians, and are 
designed to keep families together while women 
receive the care they need.

consumers and their families to help create clinical 
spaces that feel safe, inviting and home-like, as part of 
co-designing the new Acute Mental Health Inpatient 
Unit at Broken Hill, the Tamworth Mental Health Unit, 
and a Child and Adolescent Unit at Nepean Hospital.
NSW Suicide Monitoring System
The NSW Suicide Monitoring System has commenced 
a suite of regular reporting and system engagement 
activities for local health districts and partner 
organisations to support monitoring trends and timely 
identification of possible at-risk groups or regions.
In 2022, the system reported 965 suicide deaths in 
NSW1. This is more suicide deaths than any of the 
preceding three years. The system identified that 
possible at-risk groups in 2022 were people residing in 
the Greater Sydney region and males aged 35-44 and 
55-74 across NSW. 
Screening reports are now shared monthly with local 
health districts and their local partner agencies to 
provide information on localised suicide data based on 
age group, gender and locality with the aim to support 
targeted suicide prevention and planning activities 
across NSW.
NSW Health continues to work collaboratively with the 
NSW Department of Communities and Justice and NSW 
Police to expand the foundations of the system to 
better support communities, local organisations and 
government agencies in developing and implementing 
targeted strategies and responses.
Care pathways
In June 2022, the Agency for Clinical Innovation 
delivered the NSW Health Suicide Care Pathway: A 
Framework for Clinicians, which provides guidance on 
the provision of comprehensive identification, 
assessment, intervention and transition of care for all 
individuals who enter NSW Health facilities with suicidal 
ideation and suicidal behaviours. 
Postvention services are now available to all people in 
NSW impacted or bereaved by suicide, including family 
and friends, witnesses, service providers and first 
responders. The Post Suicide Support initiative provides 
a range of services, including bereavement counselling, 
peer support and support dealing with police and 
coroners, and is jointly funded by the Australian and 
NSW Governments.

State ODS Program and COVID-19 
care in the Community 
The massive surge in COVID-19 cases in December 
2021 meant pathology testing centres, hospitals, 
emergency departments and Ambulance services 
were overwhelmed. 
To support the mandatory reporting of RAT results, 
the State Operational Data Store Program and 
COVID-19 Care in the Community Teams 
collaborated with Service NSW to deliver a digital 
solution using the Patient Flow Portal and Service 
NSW’s website.
The program was implemented in a record time of 
two weeks. It allowed people to self-register 
positive tests, screen themselves at home and 
easily be linked to appropriate care providers. It 
also immediately relieved pressure on the system.

LivingWorks Australia is delivering training in suicide 
intervention skills to up to 25,000 people, who work with 
and support young people primarily within the NSW 
education sector, including high school, parents and carers, 
and targeted community suicide first responders. The 
training equips key community touchpoints with the skills 
to develop safe conversations around suicide, identify the 
early signs of distress and suicidal crisis and enable people 
in the community to support those in distress to connect 
with appropriate supports or services.
The Zero Suicides in Care initiative aims to reduce suicides 
among people in inpatient and community-based local 
health district mental health services through promoting 
service leadership that embeds a just and restorative 
culture. This involves changes to NSW Health policies and 
models of care and enhanced suicide prevention training 
for staff in the mental health system. Zero Suicides in Care 
is being implemented across all local health districts in 
NSW and is a collaboration between the Mental Health 
Branch, the Agency for Clinical Innovation, the Health 
Education and Training Institute and the Clinical Excellence 
Commission.
As part of the Zero Suicides in Care initiative, the Health 
Education and Training Institute has developed the Older 
Persons Suicide Prevention Workshop to support NSW 
Health staff who work with older people to be better 
prepared to identify warning signs, provide initial support 
and guide individuals towards appropriate resources and 
services.
Anglicare is delivering the Suicide Prevention for Seniors 
Program to up to 2,800 NSW aged care, allied health and 
mental health staff who work with older people. The 
program provides key frontline workers suicide prevention 
training skills specific to older people and aims to ensure 
early identification and warm referrals to support.
ACON
NSW Health provided funding of $1.3 million over three 
years to ACON, who established a Trans Mental Health and 
Wellbeing support service model accessible across NSW. 
Two counsellors work with four peer workers to provide 
care coordination, including up to 12 counselling sessions 
and up to 12 peer support sessions. 
The Mental Health Branch provided funding for BEING 
Mental Health Consumer Group and Mental Health Carers 
NSW to co-design and develop online and physical 
information resources. The resources were designed to 
assist consumers and carers in understanding and 
navigating the NSW Mental Health Act 2007 and the NSW 
Mental Health and Cognitive Impairment Forensic Provisions 
Act 2020. These resources have been distributed to local 
health districts and specialty networks and put on the NSW 
Health website. 
Housing and Accommodation Support Initiative 
The Mental Health Branch published longitudinal 
evaluations for the Housing and Accommodation Support 
Initiative (HASI), Community Living Supports and HASI Plus 
programs which provide community based psychosocial 
support to over 1,800 people in NSW. The evaluation 
findings demonstrated that the programs are making a real 
difference to people’s lives including significant reductions 
in hospital admissions and length of stay. 
Skill building
The Whole Family Team clinical service received 
comprehensive training throughout 2022-23 to build 
skills and capacity to integrate considerations of family 
domestic violence, child protection, mental health and 
alcohol and other drug issues. Invitations to the training 
have been extended to Child Protection Counselling 
Services to support networking and provide an opportunity 
for a shared understanding between 
the two programs. 
Sydney Children’s Hospitals Network
A suite of resources addressing the impact of climate 
change on mental health has been launched by the Sydney 
Children’s Hospitals Network in partnership 
with NSW Health. Developed by a team of clinicians, 
who noticed the effect climate change was having on 
patients they were treating for mental health conditions, 
the resources address coping strategies, emotional and 
trauma support, understanding anxiety and climate 
change, and supporting children’s wellbeing. They feature 
content tailored specifically for health professionals, 
children and young people, parents, carers and teachers. 
The resources also bring awareness to the complex 
underlying causes contributing to declining mental health.
Preventing, preparing, responding 
to threats to population health
COVID-19 monitoring
The 2022-23 annual period experienced fewer pronounced 
COVID-19 epidemic waves than 2021-22. Health Protection 
NSW continued to regularly gather, analyse, interpret and 
report on the surveillance of COVID-19 and other 
respiratory infections. The System Information and 
Analytics branch continued to partner with experts from 
the University of New South Wales to provide fortnightly 
projections on the general ward and intensive care unit bed 
demand to monitor the situation and assess the need for 
interventions to manage excess demands if required.

Emergency response
NSW Ambulance is working on the development of the 
Emergency Management Strategy and advancement of 
the dedicated Emergency Management Unit to address 
and mitigate the impact of future pandemics and other 
health threats.
The State Health Emergency 
Operations Centre (SHEOC)
The System Management Branch is responsible for 
‘Whole of Health’ state-level preparedness and 
response to major incidents and emergencies arising 
from a range of hazards. The State Preparedness 
and Response Unit within the System Management 
Branch maintains equipment and technology to rapidly 
activate the State Health Emergency Operations Centre 
when required. The State Health Emergency Operations 
Centre was operational from September through 
November 2022 to support the response to severe 
weather events and major flooding across the state. 
Support a coordinated state-led approach 
for NSW Health’s response to major events
During 2022-23 the NSW Health System Management 
Branch and NSW Ambulance continued to support 
whole of government event planning for major events 
and mass gatherings, such as: City2Surf (August 2022), 
Sydney World Pride (February-March 2023), HOKA 
Runaway Sydney Half Marathon (May 2023), VIVID 
(May-June 2023). For City2Surf, local health districts 
provided over 50 NSW Health medical, nursing 
assistance staff to provide medical care to event 
participants in Bondi.
Referral pathways
In 2022-23, NSW Ambulance continued to invest in 
wellness, prevention and early detection through the 
advancement of the Alternate referral pathways: Improving 
patient experience and system efficiency program, using 
co-commissioning is a guiding principle. This has 
streamlined clinician access to integrated referral 
pathways, allowing them to refer patients to appropriate 
established local health district and specialty health 
network services avoiding transports to emergency 
departments. 
Ongoing investment in the Extended Care Paramedic 
workforce has improved access to appropriate care, 
increasing the clinical role of a small group of selected 
paramedics in patient assessment, recognition and 
management of minor illness and minor injury 
presentations; the provision of definitive care; and referral 
to community-based health services for a range of 
presentations.
Extended Care Paramedics have additional training and 
qualifications that enable them to play an enhanced 
clinical role in medical and clinical examination; the 
recognition and management of chronic and complex care; 
and injury presentations. They play an important role in 
treating people in a non-hospital setting and help improve 
patient care. 
Pathogens
The Clinical Excellence Commission developed infection 
prevention and control policies, guidelines 
and implementation resources to prevent and respond 
to existing and emerging pathogens. The Clinical 
Excellence Commission continued to refine the response 
and escalation framework for COVID-19 and other 
respiratory infections in NSW.
Healthy ageing
The Clinical Excellence Commission collaborated with 
Neuroscience Research Australia, NSW Fall Prevention 
and Healthy Ageing Network to deliver four workshops on 
Exercise to Prevent Falls Training, three videos for 
residential aged care on safe exercise and the Annual 
Network Forum for hospital, community and residential 
aged care settings.
The Clinical Excellence Commission collaborated with 
NSW Health agencies to develop evidence-based fall 
prevention exercise and multidisciplinary interventions in 
community settings and is progressing a draft falls white 
paper. For the Older Persons’ Patient Safety Program’s 
Comprehensive Care – Minimising Harm model, the 
commission continued working with local health district 
and specialty health networks to support quality 
improvement initiatives.
The Centre for Oral Health also produced oral health 
resources for older people available in hard copies or via 
the Centre for Oral Health Strategy website. These 
resources are designed to help to prevent unnecessary 
hospital visits resulting from deteriorating oral health.
Surveillance and investigation
NSW Health Pathology’s Forensic and Analytical Science 
Service’s Clinical and Environmental Toxicology 
Laboratory tested e-cigarettes (or vapes) to determine 
their contents and assist the NSW Ministry of Health with 
its surveillance and public health investigation activities. 
Most of the devices tested were found to contain nicotine, 
although many made no reference to this on their labels. 
The service also analysed seized drugs to alert the NSW 
Ministry of Health and provide vital information to 
clinicians treating patients in critical care units.

Development of the new SIGNAL disease notification 
program was further progressed by Health Protection 
NSW and eHealth NSW to eventually replace the 
Notifiable Conditions Information Management System to 
capture statewide reporting of notifiable medical 
conditions.
Five public drug warnings were published to alert the 
community to drugs in circulation in NSW with the 
potential to cause serious harm. 
The Centre for Alcohol and Other Drugs worked with other 
government agencies to promote the Australian Alcohol 
Guidelines highlighting the importance of reducing access 
by minors and the health impacts associated with alcohol. 
An eight-month awareness campaign also ran across NSW 
Health channels. 
Public health information
Health campaigns
Teams across the system including Health Protection 
NSW, the Centre for Population Health, and the Centre 
for Alcohol and Other Drugs worked on a variety of 
statewide campaigns across channels to share public 
health information and promote behaviour change across 
a range of topics. Campaigns included messaging about 
mosquito-borne diseases (e.g. Japanese Encephalitis 
Virus), mpox, hand hygiene, and respiratory viruses.
The winter respiratory campaign targeted people at higher 
risk of severe illness particularly: children under five years 
of age; pregnant women; Aboriginal people; and culturally 
and linguistically diverse groups. Messaging aimed to 
increase the public's awareness of the risks of respiratory 
illness such as COVID-19, influenza and respiratory 
syncytial virus, and promoted vaccination and safe 
behaviours including hand hygiene and staying at 
home if unwell. 
NSW Health content had a reach of over 336 million on 
social media during the 12 months to June 2023, achieving 
over 3.6 million engagements. 
Sexually Transmissible Infections (STI) Strategy
The NSW Sexually Transmissible Infections (STI) Strategy 
2022-2026 was released in September 2022 and aims 
to reduce the prevalence and impacts of STIs, with a 
new focus on equity and access to testing and treatment 
to safeguard the sexual health and wellbeing of everyone 
living in NSW. 
NSW Health has introduced ambitious targets to track 
progress towards the vision set by the strategy, which 
include a 5% reduction in notification rates of infectious 
syphilis by 2026, and a 5% increase each year in 
comprehensive STI testing in priority populations, 
including men who have sex with men, sex workers, 
trans and gender diverse people, and Aboriginal people. 
HIV and Hepatitis
Dried Blood Spot (DBS) testing is an innovative finger stick 
test for HIV and hepatitis C accessible for eligible people 
either by registering for a test online or in receiving one 
approved settings. Both DBS and point of care testing 
increased in 2022-23 so that 7,186 DBS and 8,863 RNA 
point of care hepatitis C tests were completed in key 
settings such as the Needle and Syringe Program, alcohol 
and other drug services and prisons. 
Getting the best start in life
From conception
In 2022-23, a total of 11,313 women were referred to the Get 
Healthy in Pregnancy coaching service which supports 
women to eat healthily, be active, abstain from drinking 
alcohol, and achieve healthy weight gain during pregnancy, 
in line with the Institute of Medicine guidelines. 
First statewide guideline on Nausea and 
Vomiting in Pregnancy and Hyperemesis 
Gravidarum
The Hyperemesis Gravidarum Initiative is a $17 million 
investment over four years (2020-2024) to provide 
education and research into this condition and offer women 
and their families more practical support.
The first NSW Health statewide Guideline for Nausea and 
Vomiting in Pregnancy and Hyperemesis Gravidarum was 
released in July 2022. It was developed in response to 
consultation with clinicians, consumers, key associations 
and organisations. It provides evidence-based guidance to 
support consistency of practice, decision-making, and 
care coordination for the diagnosis and management of 
the condition.
NSW Health also raised awareness about the impact of 
hyperemesis gravidarum and promoted the care, support 
and treatment options available through resources for 
consumers and clinicians, education activities for NSW 
Health staff, community pharmacists and general 
practitioners and a communication strategy for consumers 
and clinicians.

Maternity care
Connecting, listening and responding: A Blueprint for Action 
– Maternity Care in NSW (the Blueprint) was published in 
March 2023. The Blueprint reflects the extensive 
consultation undertaken to inform the revision 
of the NSW Health Policy Directive Towards Normal Birth. 
It followed face-to-face consultations with 1,000 
stakeholders spanning health professionals and 
consumers, two online consumer surveys for women and 
partners with more than 18,000 responses, and 513 
submissions from the public.
The Blueprint aims to ensure all women in NSW receive 
respectful, evidence-based and equitable maternity care 
that improves experiences and health and wellbeing 
outcomes.
Maternal Transfers Redesign
The Maternal Transfers Redesign ensures that pregnant 
women and their babies receive the right care, in the right 
place, at the right time. While the majority of transfers of 
pregnant women and their babies for higher-level care 
occur efficiently and effectively, NSW Health, in 
collaboration with midwifery redesign leads, obstetric 
leads and tiered perinatal networks, identified 
opportunities to improve the pathways when higher-level 
care is required. 
The initiative resulted in a reduction of clinical variation 
and improved decision making with more women being 
cared for closer to home, enhancing the experience for 
women and clinicians without compromising safety. 
Brighter Beginnings and First 2000 Days 
Summit 
Some 845 delegates across NSW government and the 
non-Government sector registered for the Brighter 
Beginnings Summit. The Brighter Beginnings initiative aims 
to to drive transformational change in early childhood 
development in the first 2,000 days of a child's life which is 
an important time for their development.The Summit 
included renowned national and international speakers 
and panel discussions with NSW Government Ministers 
and senior executives supporting the initiative. Focus 
areas included progress to date, disseminated learnings 
and driving momentum within NSW Health and across 
government.
Keeping People Healthy Award 
Hunter New England 
Local Health District
PACE (Physically Active Children 
in Education) 
Physical inactivity is the fourth leading cause of 
death worldwide. By ensuring children are 
physically active, it could prevent 8,000 deaths 
each year in Australia. 
The Physically Active Children in Education (PACE) 
was rigorously tested and shown to be an effective 
model of service to support schools to deliver 150 
minutes of weekly physical activity, as mandated 
by the NSW Department of Education.

Brighter Beginnings: the first 2000 days of life 
accelerator initiatives
NSW Health has implemented several initiatives to 
improve support to families in the first 2000 days 
(pregnancy to age five) of their children’s lives. 
NSW Health and the Department of Education co-
designed a program to provide health and development 
checks to four-year-old children in NSW preschool 
settings, to begin in the 2023-24 financial year.
Demand modelling and a targeted expression of interest 
process identified eight new Sustaining NSW Families 
sustained health home visiting sites in local government 
areas in Nepean Blue Mountains, Hunter New England, 
Northern Sydney, Western NSW, Murrumbidgee, 
Mid North Coast and Southern NSW Local Health 
Districts. These sites will start delivering services in the 
2023-24 financial year.

eHealth NSW in collaboration with the NSW Ministry of 
Health and other NSW Government partners. 
NSW Health and the Department of Communities and 
Justice progressed expansion of Pregnancy Family 
Conferencing to make it available to more parents
across NSW. 
The Building Brains and Bodies video series for parents 
promotes the importance of early interactions to support 
child development. The resources can be found on the 
NSW Health website, Child Health and Development page, 
and have been translated into Arabic, Bangla, Mandarin 
and Vietnamese, with more to come. 
First 2000 Days HETI module 
on My Health Learning
The learning module provides an overview of the research 
and evidence behind a child’s first 2000 days - from 
conception to age five, as well as strategies to work 
collaboratively and identify pathways for additional support.
Newborns
In 2022-23, the Agency for Clinical Innovation published a 
clinical practice guide on recognition, monitoring and early 
management of newborns with hypoxic ischaemic 
encephalopathy who may benefit from therapeutic 
hypothermia (cooling) and a supplementary patient 
information sheet. 
Effects of smoking and vaping
A new Policy Directive, Reducing the effects of smoking 
and vaping on pregnancy and newborn outcomes, was 
released in October 2022. The Directive establishes 
minimum requirements for NSW Health staff to provide 
evidence-based smoking and vaping cessation support to 
women before, during and after pregnancy. The Centre for 
Population Health coordinated implementation with local 
health districts and speciality health networks. 
Syphilis screening
Over the past five years, there has been an increase in 
infectious syphilis and confirmed and probable congenital 
syphilis notifications in NSW.
A second universal syphilis screen was introduced at 28 
weeks pregnancy to improve detection and treatment 
rates, reducing adverse outcomes for mothers and babies. 
Syphilis is a nationally notifiable sexually transmissible 
infection that can be safely treated with antibiotics. 
Healthy behaviours
In partnership with local health districts, the Centre for 
Population Health delivers the Munch & Move program. 
This supports the healthy development of children from 
birth to five years by modelling and promoting healthy 
eating and physical activity. In 2022-23, a total of 3,733 or 
89% of centre-based early childhood services participated 
in the program.
NSW Health, led by the Centre for Population Health 
partnered with the NSW Department of Education to 
strengthen student mental and physical health and 
wellbeing through the Supporting Student Wellbeing 
Memorandum of Understanding and annual workplan. 
Over 95% of government primary and secondary schools 
with a canteen are meeting the NSW Healthy School 
Canteen Strategy. 
NSW Health continued to offer the Go4Fun program 
for children above a healthy weight, and their families, to 
support them to adopt healthier lifestyles. The program is 
available online, face-to-face and as a culturally adapted 
program for Aboriginal families. 
Improving treatment access
The Centre for Alcohol and Other Drugs opened Alcohol 
and Other Drug Treatment Access Expansion Grants in 
April 2023. Two new funding packages were made 
available to non-government organisations specifically 
to promote access to residential and community-based 
alcohol and other drugs treatment for women and families 
with dependent children. 


NSW Health	
Annual Report 2022–23   :  Operations and Performance   :  page 44
It also expanded the Substance Use in Pregnancy and 
Parenting Service across eight local health districts and 
established the service in a local health district where it 
was not previously available. 
Pathology improvements
Collections
NSW Health Pathology introduced a standard procedure 
for risk assessments to help improve home collections and 
aged care testing. It published a statewide positive patient 
identification procedure that clarified how to meet 
identification requirements in all settings, including 
complex environments such as aged care facilities, thereby 
minimising risk to patients.
Paediatric pathology 
NSW Health Pathology partnered with the Sydney 
Children’s Hospitals Network to explore best practice in 
providing pathology services for paediatric patients across 
NSW. In late 2022, more than 400 health practitioners, 
stakeholders and families across NSW participated in 
consultation sessions providing more than 1,700 individual 
comments. Over 110 health practitioners helped to prioritise 
short, medium and longer-term priorities in key areas 
including access, collections, research, technology, testing 
and workforce. 
Prevention and wellness
Preventable cancer risk factors 
Cancer is a major cause of illness and threat to population 
health, with a substantial social and economic impact on 
individuals, families and the community. Nearly half of the 
cancer deaths worldwide are attributable to preventable 
risk factors, such as tobacco use, sun exposure, alcohol 
consumption, diet and physical activity.
In 2022-23, Cancer Institute NSW delivered public 
education campaigns to drive change in public behaviour 
across NSW and prevent cancers. 
This Could Be the One, a tobacco control campaign, 
was developed in consultation with ACON and targeted 
LGBTIQ+ people aged 18 and older who smoke or have 
recently quit.
NSW Health delivered phase two of the Do You Know What 
You’re Vaping? campaign, targeting young people and 
aiming to debunk common myths about vaping. Parent and 
carer resources have been translated into 10 languages, 
promoted through engagement with multicultural 
communities and supported by a tailored communication 
strategy. NSW Health has provided licencing for the 
campaign and a resource toolkit to five other jurisdictions.
The If You Could See UV skin cancer prevention campaign 
encouraged 18-24-year-olds to protect their skin from 
harmful ultraviolet (UV) radiation, with the objective of 
reducing their lifetime risk of developing skin cancer.
The Change Your Routine, skin cancer prevention 
campaign aimed to increase sun protection behaviours 
among outdoor workers to reduce their lifetime risk of 
developing skin cancer. 
Smoking cessation
In 2022-23 there were more than 4,900 inbound calls to 
Quitline and 9,000 outbound calls. During the same period 
about 364,010 people accessed the iCanQuit website for 
smoking cessation advice.
A Quitting Smoking in Pregnancy campaign aimed to 
provide support for pregnant women aged 18-34 in NSW 
who smoke, helping them to quit by using available 
support services. The campaign included a specific focus 
on Aboriginal women, given the higher proportion of 
smokers among this group during pregnancy.
Compliance
In 2022-23, NSW Health continued its comprehensive 
compliance and enforcement program for illegal tobacco 
and e-cigarettes containing nicotine. NSW Health 
undertook seven successful prosecutions against retailers 
for the sale of e-cigarettes containing nicotine; and seized 
more than 310,000 e-cigarette products containing 
nicotine or labelled as containing nicotine. Inspectors also 
conducted more than 240 seizures of illegal tobacco and 
seized and destroyed more than 2,500,000 cigarettes and 
1,000 kilograms of other tobacco.
Sun safety
Cancer Institute NSW provided advice to local councils 
about how to increase the quality and quantity of shade 
through public policy and planning provisions. Quality shade 
can provide 75% protection from UV radiation from the sun, 
which causes over half of all skin cancer cases. As a result, 
over 20 councils updated their shade policy provisions. 
Consultation on strategy development
Development of a statewide Alcohol and Other Drugs 
Strategy has commenced. NSW Health has participated in 
consultation to inform the Strategy development and 
participated in the Cross Agency Advisory Group. 
NSW Health has engaged the National Drug and Alcohol 
Research Centre to develop a Whole of Community 
Prevention Framework for Alcohol and Other Drugs.

Healthy lifestyles
The Healthy Eating & Active Living Strategy 2022-2032 
launched in September 2022 and outlines an approach to 
addressing overweight and obesity by enabling healthy 
eating and active living across the community with a 
particular focus on priority populations. The strategy 
provides the foundation for collaboration between NSW 
Health, partner organisations and other government 
agencies to support keeping people healthy and well. An 
Implementation Plan for the first years of the strategy has 
been established to support the delivery of key outcomes.
The Get Healthy Service provides coaching support for 
people over the age of 16 to make healthy lifestyle 
improvements with the support of university qualified 
health coaches. In 2022-23, there were 15,497 referrals 
made to the service with 6,643 enrolments.
Opportunistic immunisation
Children with chronic illnesses or frequent hospital 
attendances are at increased risk of severe illness and 
have substantially lower immunisation coverage rates 
compared to their peers without chronic illness. 
Opportunistic immunisation services were established in 
the Sydney Children’s Hospitals Network and HNEKids 
Health in the Hunter New England Local Health District. 
From January to June 2023, 300 children, parents and 
siblings were vaccinated for influenza and National 
Immunisation Program vaccines by HNEKids Health; and a 
further 1,187 via the Sydney Children’s Hospitals Network.
Mpox
eHealth NSW developed the mpox virus vaccination 
administration management platform in 40 days to 
support 22 clinics. There were 10,593 mpox vaccine doses 
administered from the platform launch in October 2022 
up until its closure in April 2023. 
Mosquito-borne diseases
NSW Health continued measures to reduce the risk of 
severe mosquito-borne diseases in 2022-23, with key 
activities spanning: 
•	The development of state and national guidance on 
mosquito population control
•	Expansion of the NSW Arbovirus and Mosquito 
Monitoring Program
•	Distribution of mosquito repellent to high-risk areas
•	Provision of financial support and training to local 
councils to implement signage and vector control 
measures
•	The launch of a public awareness campaign.
Japanese Encephalitis vaccines costing over $20 million 
were purchased. Legislative changes allowing pharmacists 
and nurse immunisers supported the roll out. 
Immunisation - online consent
NSW Health launched an online Consent and Records 
Management for Immunisation system for parents in 
February 2023. This digital solution was delivered by 
eHealth NSW in partnership with Health Protection NSW 
and enables online consent, clinic management and 
operational reporting for the NSW School Vaccination 
Program. The system enables real-time recording of 
vaccination details, resulting in a faster upload to the 
Australian Immunisation Register. 
For parents, it makes it quick and easy for them to provide 
consent to help keep NSW children healthy and well. 
Parents also receive SMS notifications when vaccinations 
are given. This program supports better data quality and 
security and improved access to vaccination records. Up to 
30 June 2023, there were 106,503 online parent/carer 
consent forms completed.
Domestic Violence Routine Screening
The NSW Health Domestic Violence Routine Screening 
Policy Directive was released in April 2023. It establishes a 
new streamlined process for services outside the four 
mandated screening settings to opt into routine screening, 
including services such as women’s health, emergency 
departments, dental services and refugee health services. 
The Policy Directive also provides a new screening 
flowchart and intranet support page to support screening 
delivery, and mandates that all staff who conduct routine 
screening must receive targeted training.

From pilot to rollout
Adult survivors of childhood sexual abuse often have 
multiple and complex health and wellbeing needs and can 
experience many barriers to accessing trauma-informed 
and culturally safe health services. 
In 2022-23, NSW Health implemented a statewide Adult 
Survivors Program to improve outcomes for this highly 
vulnerable population group following a successful pilot 
project delivered in 2019-2022. 
Clinical innovation and intelligence
The Critical Intelligence Unit provided rapid, evidenced-
based insights that informed decisions on the pandemic 
response, producing over 1,800 evidence-based products. 
The unit engaged with around 2,000 direct subscribers to 
Daily Digest and more than 300,000 visits to webpages. 
The Critical Intelligence Unit has been recognised as 
having value beyond COVID-19, offering systems 
intelligence, clinical intelligence and evidence integration. 
This led to the launch of the new Evidence Digest covering 
innovations that have the potential to change clinical 
practice and care delivery.
Oral Health
In February 2023, the Centre for Oral Health Strategy 
published the NSW Oral Health Strategic Plan 2022 – 2032 
which guides coordinated action for the future of oral 
health care. The plan outlines NSW Health’s commitment 
to reducing dental disease and providing equitable access 
to oral health care for our patients, while focusing on 
providing care for priority populations. 
Early Childhood Oral Health online training is available for 
internal and external organisations and agencies to access 
to help improve oral health outcomes for young people.
The Primary School Mobile Dental Program and Mobile 
Dental Outreach Program are designed to target children in 
the most need and improve equity of access to care 
through a child’s developmental years. 
Oral Health content is now included in the TAFE NSW 
Children’s Services Certificate III in Early Childhood 
Education and Care to spread awareness of children’s oral 
health through various childcare settings.
In addition, the NSW Health Centre for Oral Health has 
collaborated with multiple agencies to include and 
disseminate oral health information on the NSW Health 
Parent Portal.

nursing and midwifery students to support diverse clinical 
experiences across rural and metropolitan areas.
Developing effective nursing 
and midwifery leaders 
NSW Health provides programs and workshops to nursing 
and midwifery leaders at all levels to promote leadership 
development and provide support. A customised 
foundational leadership program, Take the Lead, was 
commenced by 47 nursing and midwifery unit managers in 
2022. The program is designed to equip and empower 
participants to lead change and foster cultures that 
underpin safe, quality care.
A leadership development series for 30 facility Directors of

midwives and other midwives across NSW.
Aboriginal midwifery and nursing 
NSW Health is committed to increasing the Aboriginal 
nursing and midwifery workforce by improving career 
development opportunities for Aboriginal people. 
In 2023 NSW Health supported 128 Aboriginal nursing and 
midwifery cadets, with more than half located in rural and 
regional areas. In addition, 55 undergraduate, 17 
postgraduate and 20 enrolled nurse to registered nurse 
scholarships were awarded to support nursing and 
midwifery studies for Aboriginal people in 2023.
Sydney Children’s Hospitals network
The Sydney Children’s Hospitals Network has invested in 
comprehensive leadership development programs, 
including a bespoke development pathway for Nursing Unit 
Managers. It provides a structured development pathway, 
incorporating educational and training opportunities, as 
well as a support system of mentorship and coaching, 
promoting leadership and management capabilities. 
A twice-yearly Development Pathway Masterclass also 
offers an opportunity for Nursing Unit Managers to share 
their experiences and knowledge, build peer networks, 
reflect and support each other.
Student placements
NSW Health provided more than 8.4 million student 
placement hours to 31,442 students across 31 disciplines.
Aboriginal Health Practitioners
Growing the Aboriginal Health Practitioner 
workforce
NSW Health maintains its commitment to growing the 
Aboriginal Health Practitioner registered clinical 
workforce, through workforce targets in the annual service 
agreements with local health districts and specialty health 
networks. This workforce has a relative equivalence in 
clinical skills to an enrolled nurse and supports the 
Aboriginal patient journey in a culturally safe and 
supportive manner. The project to grow the Aboriginal 
Health Practitioner workforce also builds the knowledge 
and capability of clinical supervisors and clinical placement 
supervisors of the role scope. This enables the 
establishment of the positions in clinical multi-disciplinary 
teams and supports the appropriate alignment of the role 
within teams and services for Aboriginal people. The role 
scope can include virtual care models and has the potential 
for use in programs such as Hospital in the Home, men’s 
and women’s health, sexual health, diabetes and dialysis, 
rehabilitation and ambulatory and urgent care. 
Embedding training into clinical placements
To support Aboriginal Health Practitioners and Allied 
Health Assistants, NSW Health has embedded registered 
training organisations and training programs into Student 
Placement Agreements. This supports students to 
effectively complete their clinical placement hours and 
their course of study. Students are then ready to work and 
practice in their role and have the relevant Aboriginal 
Health Practitioner program registration. 
Healthy Deadly Feet 
Aboriginal Health Practitioner roles support high risk foot 
disease services under the Healthy Deadly Feet model and 
as part of the overall effort to improve foot health and 
reduce the burden of lower limb amputations. 
Respecting the Difference training
Respecting the Difference aims to significantly improve the 
health status of Aboriginal people and reverse the impact 
of racism as there is an immediate and ongoing need for 
organisations to provide more respectful, responsive and 
culturally sensitive services.
The purpose of this training is to motivate NSW Health 
staff to build positive and meaningful relationships with 
Aboriginal people who may be clients, visitors or staff, 
and to improve their confidence in establishing appropriate 
and sustainable connections.


NSW Health	
Annual Report 2022–23   :  Operations and Performance  :  page 49
The Respecting the Difference Aboriginal cultural training 
eLearning and face-to-face mandatory training program 
was refreshed in July 2022. The program was relaunched 
and agencies remain committed to 90% completion targets. 
Junior Medical Officers
In May 2023, the Junior Medical Officer (JMO) Workforce 
Management Forum was held, with over 200 delegates 
attending in-person from across local health districts and 
specialty networks. The one-day forum was designed to 
enable JMO workforce managers and education support 
officers an opportunity to collaborate on emerging 
workforce issues, share best practice and network with 
their peers. 
The event is consistent with the NSW Health Workforce 
plan 2021-2031, to build positive work environments and 
the Future Health Plan, to attract and retain skilled people 
who put patients first. Future annual forums are planned 
for medical workforce managers to provide ongoing 
opportunities to foster collaboration and ensure they are 
equipped to manage the changing needs and environment 
of the JMO Workforce.
Our regional workforce
Single Employer Model
NSW Health, with the support of the Federal Government, 
has expanded the Single Employer Model, which allows 
local health districts to employ rural generalist trainees to 
work in local hospitals and general practices while 
completing their training.
Rural generalists are general practitioners who provide 
primary care services, emergency medicine and have 
training in additional skills like obstetrics, anaesthetics or 
mental health services.
The innovative model, initially piloted in Murrumbidgee 
Local Health District, helps attract doctors to work in 
regional, rural and remote hospitals to improve access to 
primary care and essential medical services in regional 
communities.
Rural Health Workforce Incentive Scheme
The Rural Health Workforce Incentive Scheme recruits 
and retains staff in eligible positions at health services 
across rural and regional NSW. In addition to standard 
employment entitlements, the scheme also offers 
packages of up to $20,000. In 2022-23, the scheme 
recruited more than 800 staff with new recruits receiving 
more than $4.3 million in incentive payments. More than 
7,000 existing staff were also retained with incentives 
valued at over $37 million. 
NSW Rural and Regional Health 
Allied Health Career Scholarships
The NSW Rural and Regional Health Career Scholarships 
program supports new entrants, as well as existing rural 
health staff into health careers and early career 
development. The program addresses priorities outlined in 
the NSW Health Workforce Plan that include the building 
of a pipeline of future job ready graduates, particularly in 
rural and remote areas. 
The program, which has already awarded more than 
$675,000 in scholarships, also strengthens diversity 
and equips our people with skills and capabilities as part 
of a future, locally-connected, agile workforce.
September 2022 saw new scholarships approved with 
a focus on workforce development and the retention 
of Allied Health professionals in areas of critical need, 
specifically rural and remote regions. 
As part of the scholarships, eligible Allied Health 
assistants and Allied Health professionals received 
financial assistance to complete ongoing study while 
working and attaining further qualifications. Since its 
launch in February 2023, a total of 29 Allied Health 
Scholarships have been taken up across the Rural Allied 
Health Assistant Scholarship, the Allied Health Rural 
Generalist Program Scholarship and the Allied Health 
Rural Generalist Diploma Rural Practice Scholarship.
Regional staff accommodation
Health staff accommodation is an important consideration 
in the recruitment and retention of health staff in 
regional areas. 
The Regional Health Division commissioned a feasibility 
study to determine future strategies for the management 
and delivery of health staff accommodation in NSW. 
The division is exploring opportunities to work

Allied Health
Governance
In February 2023, the NSW Principles of Allied Health 
Governance Report was delivered. The report provides a 
foundation to guide best practice strategic, operational, 
professional, and clinical Allied Health governance, which 
are essential for safe and high-quality service delivery. 
The report provides value to local health districts and 
specialty health networks by outlining the approach, 
drivers and opportunities to strengthen Allied Health 
governance that can be considered for local customisation 
and implementation. A toolkit to support district and 
network assessment and implementation in alignment 
with the principles is included as part of the report.
Graduate Pipeline
An Allied Health Graduate Workforce Pipeline project 
was undertaken to explore barriers facing the recruitment 
of new graduate Allied Health professionals and identify 
the specific opportunities to improve the new graduate 
pipeline. Early findings highlight the need for more 
investment in student placement and early graduate 
experience to positively impact attraction and retention 
to NSW Health. 
Cadetships
In 2022-23, the Aboriginal Workforce team refreshed 
the program for the Aboriginal Allied Health Cadetship. 
The work expanded the supported pathways to now include 

all 23 Allied Health professions, including those requiring 
a post-graduate qualification. This new scope enables 
the organisational response to recruiting and retaining 
skilled, qualified and capable professionals in areas 
of critical need. 
The program resources have been updated to support 
promotion of the cadetship in the Aboriginal community 
and Aboriginal university student sectors. A community 
of practice has been established statewide to provide 
support, with the goal of establishing minimum standard 
practices for positive cadetship outcomes and a peer 
network to enable a responsive program to meet the 
needs of NSW Health.
People and Culture Award
Mid North Coast Local 
Health District
Words Matter 
The Words Matter team identified the integral role 
of language in reducing stigma, creating a safe work 
environment and improving collaboration. 
The team developed a patient-centred and trauma-
informed approach for staff that improves patient 
experience by using non-judgemental words in 
discussions, notes and handovers. This improved 
staff awareness and understanding of the impact of

Innovation
An evaluation of Allied Health workforce innovations 
during the COVID-19 pandemic was undertaken. The 
evaluation highlighted opportunities for sustained 
innovations into the future, including new models of care.
Future requirements
To ensure the NSW Health workforce has the capacity 
and capability to meet health service demand now and in 
the future, workforce modelling maps were created for 
21 Allied Health specialities. This work informs the 
requirements for future training and recruitment to the 
system. The Allied Health Workforce Modelling project 
published 23 factsheets to the NSW Health Allied 
Health webpage. 
This project marks a significant milestone as it delivers 
future forecasting of NSW Health growth demand 
scenarios for the Allied Health professions. The factsheets 
can be used to support state and local workforce 
planning, inform potential career seekers on job 
opportunities within NSW Heath and support partnerships 
with universities to optimise course attraction and student 
to workforce pipelines.
The Allied Health team along with the Workforce 
Operational Strategic Unit implemented a strategy to 
provide the NSW Health system surge capacity through a 
centralised Exercise Physiologist pool. Six professionals 
were employed under the strategy in 2022-23.
A student pipeline dashboard proof of concept was also 
developed for podiatry. The dashboard will increase 
visibility of the higher education enrolment to employment 
pathway to improve workforce planning.
NSW Allied Health Deans Forum 
The NSW Allied Health Deans Forum has been 
re-established to align NSW Health and Higher Education 
strategic directions, as well as to provide a forum for 
information sharing, collaboration, partnership and 
solution design. An initial forum was held in May 2023, 
with future forums planned. These will explore 
opportunities to improve the attraction of students into 
Allied Health degrees and further strengthen the student 
to workforce pipeline. 
Improving the wellbeing 
of our workforce
In December 2021, the Workforce Planning and Talent 
Development branch established the Workforce Wellbeing 
Collaborative to address the impact of COVID-19 on 
the wellbeing of our workforce. The objective was to 
proactively design approaches to enhance workforce 
wellbeing that could be shared and promoted across 
the state. 
Staff experience leads were appointed in 21 health 
organisations for six months. These positions were shared 
between health organisations and implemented a 
statewide project to reduce duplication, drive consistency 
and reduce gaps in workforce wellbeing approaches. 
Working groups focused on initiatives in support of the 
eight workplace contributors to wellbeing that include 
purpose, health, happiness, clarity, connection, growth, 
achievement and security.
As of June 2023, the project had delivered a range of 
recommendations spanning a diversity and inclusion 
checklist, a statewide employee listening approach, 
a wellbeing index tool, a critical moments toolkit, 
an identifying psychosocial risks tool and mapping 
current programs.
Award reform
The Ministry of Health and public health unions recognise 
the need for award reform. The Ministry has established 
an internal award reform team in the Workplace Relations 
Branch to progress reforming the NSW Health industrial 
awards. Award reform presents an opportunity for 
NSW Health and the public health unions to work 
collaboratively to modernise the industrial instruments 
that establish wages and conditions for the workforce 
to enhance workplace productivity and resolve current 
workforce challenges.
NSW People Matter Employee Survey 
In August and September 2022, more than 76,000 NSW 
Health staff participated in the NSW People Matter 
Employee Survey. Conducted by the NSW Public Service 
Commission in collaboration with public sector agencies, 
the survey provides an opportunity for staff to share 
feedback about their experiences of working. 
NSW Health achieved an overall employee engagement 
score of 62 with small improvements achieved in 
areas including job purpose, feedback and performance 
management, decision making and accountability, and 
learning and development.

Cutting edge therapy
The Agency for Clinical Innovation (ACI) worked with 
clinicians and key partners to implement immune effector 
cell treatments for people with certain blood diseases 
such as cancer. The cutting-edge therapy uses an 
individual’s own immune effector cells to target and treat 
their disease. ACI supported centres to become accredited 
and ensure they have the appropriate technology, 
procedures and skills in place to implement immune 
effector cell therapies into clinical practice. The standard 
frontline therapies available for children and adults with B 
cell haematological cancers are generally successful, 
resulting in a 5-year relative survival rate of up to 90%, 
particularly in Australians up to 39 years of age.
CAR T-cell
NSW Immune Effector Cell Therapy services continue to 
deliver commercial CAR T-cell therapies for certain blood 
cancers. In 2022-23 over 60 people with very late-stage 
cancer were able to access this innovative therapy. 
A state-wide evaluation of the experience of adult and 
paediatric patients and carers who have received CAR 
T-cell therapy in NSW has informed service delivery 
enhancements. NSW continues to be a global leader in 
the gene-based treatment of spinal muscular atrophy 
and nationally in the provision of gene therapy for
 blinding eye disease.

the potential system impacts and inform contract and 
funding negotiations. This has supported an evidence-
based approach to joint primary health network and local 
health district planning and service delivery.
Patient flow
Patient management
In 2022-23, System Performance Support commenced the 
statewide rollout of the Patient Flow Portal Incoming 
Patient Allocations module. The module is used to manage 
patients incoming from other hospitals, admitted from the 
emergency department or from planned surgical and 
medical waitlists. The team also enhanced predictive 
modelling of hospital bed demand and supply to better 
manage patient flow throughout a hospital.
The team also implemented discharge bed cleaning 
management functions to allow faster bed turnaround 
times and developed the Planned Care for Better Health 
Operational Dashboard for consistent integrated care for 
all patients.
Modern, safe and innovative IT
Cyber security
The Essential Eight Maturity Uplift Program remained on 
track with eHealth NSW to develop important capabilities 
around the eight essential controls, as recommended by 
the Australian Cyber Security Centre. 
New mandatory Cyber Security Awareness training for 
NSW Health Staff was rolled out by eHealth NSW and the 
NSW Ministry of Health in March 2023. The module helps 
staff learn more about how they can protect personal, 
health or other sensitive information from cyber-attacks.
In the cloud
The Infrastructure Refresh Program continued to transition 
IT infrastructure from on-premises to the cloud. As of 30 
June 2023, 35% of critical eHealth NSW ICT services were 
hosted on NSW Health's public cloud platform. As a result, 
the program saved 120,000 clinical productivity hours, 
achieved a 70% reduction in unplanned outages and a 50% 
reduction in maintenance windows. 
eHealth NSW’s Statewide Data Centre Reform Program 
continued to work with NSW Health organisations to 
migrate locally managed in-scope applications and related 
on-premise infrastructure to the NSW Health cloud 
platform. As of 30 June 2023, 72% of applications and 
62% of supporting infrastructure were migrated to the 
cloud. The 15 NSW Health organisations can now maximise 
the benefits of public cloud with local ICT teams upskilled 
to leverage the latest cloud services. 
Removing legacy ICT
eHealth NSW remained on track with the decommissioning 
of ICT legacy systems. The criteria, targets and roadmap 
were defined and an ICT decommissioning strategy 
was drafted.

eHealth NSW completed the statewide rollout of the 
electronic Medical Record connect program, to support a 
digitally enabled health system. The new Single Digital 
Patient Record Program will evolve electronic medical 
records further in the coming years and provide a single 
platform where clinicians can access patient records from 
across the state, regardless of location.
MotherSafe
South Eastern Sydney Local Health District launched a 
new cloud-based contact centre for their MotherSafe 
telephone service, with support from eHealth NSW. This 
enables MotherSafe clinicians and counsellors to answer 
calls from any workplace location and provide additional 
support such as public announcement messages and call 
backs, making it easier for consumers to access this 
counselling service.
myVirtualCare 
The myVirtualCare video conferencing platform provided 
patients in NSW with a seamless and convenient way to 
access their clinical and social care providers using any 
internet-enabled device. myVirtualCare supported patients 
to access a variety of services including cancer care, 
palliative care, nutrition and dietetics, pain, mental health, 
chronic and complex care and speech and rehabilitation 
services. There have been 300,000+ virtual consultations 
conducted to 30 June 2023. 
eHealth NSW and the Cancer Institute NSW worked 
together on the development of an Oncology Information 
Systems Strategy in partnership with local health districts, 
specialty health networks and NSW Health pillar 
organisations. The strategy’s key objective is to provide a 
consistent, standardised and more holistic cancer patient 
view. This will improve the effectiveness, efficiency and 
safety of cancer care. 
Identifying Sepsis risk
eHealth NSW launched the clinical pilot for the Sepsis 
Risk Tool Dashboard at Westmead Hospital in September 
2022. The tool was developed in collaboration with the 
Clinical Excellence Commission, Western Sydney Local 
Health District, Sydney Health Partners, the University of 
Sydney and NSW Health Pathology. It will be used in 
emergency departments to identify a patient’s risk of 
sepsis, a life threatening condition.

Sustainable asset management
NSW Health is focused on delivering an asset 
management program that provides safe, reliable and 
high-quality healthcare delivery and patient outcomes. 
In 2022-23, NSW Health achieved the following initiatives 
to support asset management optimisation, sustainability 
and maturity:
•	commenced and continued to a centralised management 
model within the Ministry for key focus areas
•	development of an Asset Management Benefits 
Framework to link the asset management outcomes and 
benefits to the NSW Future Health Strategy and 
enhance patient and community outcomes
•	development of an Asset Information Strategy and Asset 
Data Standard for buildings and facilities to help ensure 
stakeholders have access to key enablers in data and 
information to achieve asset management objectives
•	improving data consistency and enhancing the data 
available in the online asset register to provide greater 
visibility and inform proactive management of assets 
across the state via statewide initiatives to support local 
adoption
•	completed annual maturity assessments to enable 
continual improvement and to prioritise initiatives under 
policy requirements. 
Supply Chain and UN Sustainability Goals 
Of NSW Health’s top 20 suppliers, 14 are now reporting 
against one or more of the UN Sustainability Goals, 
resulting in monitoring against climate action and carbon 
emission goals for medical equipment and pharmaceutical 
suppliers. Work with the remaining suppliers is ongoing to 
develop their reporting. 
NSW Health Pathology
In 2022-23, NSW Health Pathology developed its Climate 
Change Adaptation Plan including the Climate Change 
Risk Assessment. Amongst the subsequent achievements, 
the Forensic and Analytical Science Service Drug 
Toxicology Unit reduced waste by 8.4 tonnes, equivalent 
to 9.7 tonnes of carbon dioxide; solvent use fell by 76%; 
new test methods reduced single use plastics, cutting 
clinical waste by 40%; a new laboratory information 
management system reduced A4 paper use by 68%; and 
outdated instruments were sold rather than disposed. 
Five new performance indicators 
To improve sustainability, NSW Health developed five new 
key performance indicators to be included in the annual 
Service Agreements between the NSW Ministry of Health, 
local health districts, specialty networks, NSW Ambulance 
and support organisations. The focus areas span two 
anaesthetic gases (nitrous oxide and desflurane), waste, 
energy and fleet. 
Anaesthetic gases account for approximately 5% of a 
hospital’s carbon footprint. Desflurane and nitrous oxide 
have a global warming impact 2,500 and 298 times 
greater than CO2 respectively. Closer tracking of their use 
and raising awareness of this environmental issue help to 
reduce emissions whilst improving patient care.
Using data to inform decision making 
Data-enabled 
The Bureau of Health Information continued to maximise 
the value and use of data through data linkage and 
sharing. This included creating a linked dataset, bringing 
together admission information with previous survey 
responses. The bureau also continued to monitor and 
support the workspace in the Secure Unified Research 
Environment. This allows appropriately skilled experts to 
access unit record data to produce high-value insights on 
approved projects. It will also ultimately provide a safe 
platform for linked data access once available.
Data informed decision making
NSW Health supports public health organisations in 
applying activity-based management. This evidence-
based management approach focuses on patient data to 
inform strategic decision making. Ensuring that robust and 
reliable costing information is available in a timely manner 
is a key focus area to provide a better understanding of 
service delivery costs and inform local decision making. 
Food services transformation
At Royal North Shore Hospital, 95% of cleaning tasks 
and locations have transitioned into the Task Allocation 
System, with improved communications made available 
on hand-held devices. A strategic business case for food 
services transformation has been developed to inform a 
further 15 month food service program pilot, with a focus 
on patient-centred and sustainable models of care.

Infrastructure for the future
Health Infrastructure
Health Infrastructure progressed an $11.9 billion capital 
pipeline, delivering critical new and upgraded health 
facilities and services on time and budget at a time when 
the construction sector is facing unprecedented global 
challenges. Forty projects were completed in 2022-23, 
including the first dedicated Adolescent and Young Adult 
Hospice in Australia, the Coffs Harbour Hospital 
Expansion, and Tumut Hospital Redevelopment.
New pathology infrastructure 
NSW Health Pathology collaborated with local health 
districts to review clinical service plans, service models 
and business cases to recommend pathology services and 
meet evolving hospital, patient and community needs. It 
also provided analytical support for medical equipment 
rollouts to inform improved laboratory throughput and 
workflow. Laboratories undergoing operational 
commissioning to open in the next 12 months include 
Nepean, Cooma, RPA Anatomical Pathology, Tweed 
Heads, Liverpool and Griffith.
Capital works at Randwick and Westmead
Major capital works have continued at the Sydney 
Children's Hospital Network at Randwick and Westmead. 
Following the completion of the detailed design phase, 
involving extensive consultation with staff, patients, 
community groups and Aboriginal community members, 
contractors have now been procured for the principal 
works at both sites. The project team worked 
on several projects to improve the experience of patients 
and staff at the hospitals, including consultation on the 
single-patient bedroom model, ensuring the design 
accommodates patient needs while supporting safety 
and best medical practice.
Safe, quality healthcare
To help align our governance and leaders to support the 
system and deliver the outcomes of Future Health, the 
Chief Executive of the Clinical Excellence Commission 
represented NSW at the quarterly Inter-Jurisdictional 
Committee. The committee is coordinated by the 
Australian Commission on Safety and Quality in Health 
Care which leads national safety and quality 
improvements in healthcare. 
Joint Replacement Pathways
The NSW Health Joint Replacement Pathways 
Framework was published in 2023 to help optimise 
local orthopaedic services. 
The NSW Ministry of Health, in partnership with the 
Agency for Clinical Innovation, commenced a redesign 
program to provide onsite support to seven hospitals, 
including Prince of Wales, Sutherland, Nepean, Gosford, 
Fairfield, Coffs Harbour and Royal Prince Alfred. The 
hospitals implemented a same day or short stay joint 
replacement surgery, and the resources developed in 
the program are being shared to encourage statewide 
implementation. 
Regional Health 
The Regional Health Ministerial Advisory Panel was 
established in September 2022 to strengthen community 
engagement and foster co-design principles in regional 
healthcare. The panel met five times in 2022-23.
A steering committee to oversee the development, 
implementation and evaluation of the Regional Health 
Strategic Plan 2022-2023 was formed in July 2022. 
The steering committee consists of consumers, local 
health district representatives, staff from the Aboriginal 
health sector and key health partners.
In December 2022, the NSW and Commonwealth 
governments recommenced the Bilateral Regional Health 
Forum, which provides an opportunity to discuss regional, 
rural and remote health issues and monitor progress 
on Commonwealth and NSW Governments’ commitments, 
to ensure a collaborative approach to improving health 
outcomes.
Progressing our strategy
Implementation and evaluation 
Following the release of the Future Health Strategic 
Framework in May 2022, NSW Health commenced 
implementation in 2022-23.
Future Health is an ambitious strategy that looks to 
position our health system to meet the needs of our 
patients, community and workforce over the coming years. 
To ensure its successful implementation, a set of 
roadmaps and action plans have been created to outline 
clear milestones to guide us over the next ten years. 
The Future Health Key Objectives have been embedded 
in service agreements, annual business plans and 
local strategic planning to ensure alignment across 
NSW Health.


NSW Health	
Annual Report 2022–23   :  Operations and Performance   :  page 66
Reporting processes to monitor and evaluate our progress 
were established, and a new governance structure that 
will support implementation across NSW Health was 
introduced. The governance approach features steering 
committees with members from across NSW Health 
agencies, pillars and local health districts.
Driving strategic alignment 
In 2022-23 the NSW Ministry of Health established an 
internal committee, the Strategic Investment Committee, 
to implement a framework to prioritise New Policy 
Proposals, competing priorities and NSW Treasury funding 
requirements. The Committee comprises senior Ministry 
Executive along with health policy and subject matter 
experts. It works toward ensuring strategic alignment of 
new policy measures with NSW Health Government 
priorities and NSW Health Future Health strategy.
Value based healthcare
Collaborative Commissioning
Collaborative Commissioning is a statewide initiative 
that enables organisations to establish partnerships to 
deliver local, integrated, value-based health care. NSW 
Health has developed a structured approach to support 
the establishment of partnerships and care pathways 
and provided support including funding, subject matter 
expertise, information sharing, data collection and 
monitoring and evaluation of care pathways. 
Across NSW, four partnerships between local health 
districts, primary health networks and the Rural Doctors 
Network are implementing care pathways for vulnerable 
populations. These partnerships focus on value-based 
urgent care including: cardiology in community; frail older 
persons; poorly managed diabetes and chronic obstructive 
pulmonary disease; and congestive heart failure. Each 
pathway has a tailored monitoring and evaluation plan and 
each care pathway provides opportunities to assess the 
feasibility and scalability of a state-wide approach. 
Value based models
The Agency for Clinical Innovation (ACI) published the 
3Ci Model of Care that aims to improve outcomes and 
reduce unnecessary hospitalisations for people with 
chronic heart failure (CHF) and chronic obstructive 
pulmonary disease (COPD) in NSW. The model builds upon 
the CHF and COPD clinical initiatives of the NSW Health 
Leading Better Value Care program and supports the 
management of people living with these conditions across 
the continuum of care in acute and community settings.

The ACI published a wound self-assessment tool to 
support health services across NSW to understand their 
current service capacity and capability around chronic 
wound management and take action towards meeting 
the NSW Health Leading Better Value Care standards 
for chronic wound management. 
ACI completed eight rounds of the Stroke Rural and 
Regional Mentorship Program, which supported the skill 
development of rural-based stroke clinicians. 
The program provided clinicians with rotations through 
high-volume metropolitan stroke centres and peer support 
from senior stroke clinicians. Evaluations indicate that the 
program contributed to an enhanced skill and knowledge 
base that will translate to improved service provision in 
rural settings. 
ACI’s Intensive Care NSW, in collaboration with Health 
Education and Training Institute, launched Intensive Care 
Unit Transition to Practice education modules. Intensive 
Care NSW engaged clinical groups to develop, review and 
test the content, and to create a new approach to address 
variation in practice and sustainability for clinicians and 
their work environment.
Procurement 
Procurement workstreams
The Procurement Reform program aims to deliver a 
state-wide procurement system that maximises value 
for money and supports better value care. There are 
five workstreams, including Operating Model; Pharma – 
Medicines Formulary; DeliverEase; SmartChain; and 
IT Systems and Technology. 
SmartChain 
The SmartChain program is a collaboration between 
eHealth NSW and HealthShare NSW to deliver a new 
statewide digital solution for NSW Health supply chain 
and procurement systems. The Traceability solution pilot 
at Nepean Blue Mountains Local Health District was 
launched to track and assess product usage across the 
supply chain at department, facility, local health district or 
statewide level. Traceability provides improved catalogue 
and contract compliance, easier ordering, usage and 
product tracking, improved stock management and 
enhanced reporting capabilities, visibility of stock, usage 
and cost. It is integrated with electronic Medical Record, 
and Patient Administration System, statewide Catalogues 
and Contracts, Billing and Stafflink. The digitisation of 
procurement and supply chain processes is making it 
easier and more efficient for a range of users.
DeliverEASE
South Eastern Sydney Local Health District was the first 
local health district in the state to complete its upgrade 
of medical consumables storerooms and treatment rooms 
in hospitals using the DeliverEASE stock inventory system. 
Together with HealthShare NSW, the system has 
expanded to more than 28 hospitals, providing improved 
stock-management practices, principles, tools and training 
for staff.
Medicines Formulary
Instead of using paper forms, changes to the NSW 
Medicines Formulary are now able to be received and 
approved digitally. This improvement is part of the 
Pharmaceutical Procurement Reform initiative and 
was developed by eHealth NSW in partnership with 
the Clinical Excellence Commission.
Driving continuous improvement
NSW Health is committed to whole of Government 
initiatives to drive continuous improvement in 
procurement, including participation in the NSW Treasury 
Procurement Professionals Community of Practice; the 
Aboriginal Procurement Community of Practice; and the 
Modern Slavery Working Group.
The Ministry also participates in whole of Government 
working groups driving improvement and savings on 
contingent labour and professional services.
Key procurement focus areas have included increasing the 
capability and capacity of the system and developing key 
performance indicator dashboards to enhance data 
transparency and best practice. 
The Ministry has increased staff procurement knowledge 
and run education programs across the NSW Health 
System, including training more than 700 staff on the 
NSW Health (Goods and Services) Procurement Policy. 
Through the NSW Ministry of Health’s Procurement 
Reform Program, local health districts, HealthShare NSW 
and eHealth NSW have collaborated to develop and 
implement Procurement KPI Dashboards. These cover on 
and off-contract spend, contract price compliance and 
catalogue compliance for medical-related procurements. 
Dashboards provide insights and data analytics to improve 
procurement management capability across the system 
including for medical consumables and prosthesis, 
medical equipment consumables and pathology 
procurement.

Standardising procurement processes
In 2022-23, Health Infrastructure continued its focus 
on standardising procurement processes and contracts 
for capital delivery, as part of a whole-of-government 
commitment to more collaborative and sustainable 
capital procurement.
Tender schedules and assessment criteria have been 
updated and implemented in all construction tenders to 
leverage industry expertise and innovation, helping to 
drive sustainable design and delivery outcomes that 
address the whole-of-life impacts of capital investments.
Health Infrastructure’s Statement of Participation process 
is providing visibility of the procurement pipeline and 
enhancing transparency of tendering processes, enabling 
industry to adequately plan and nominate preferences for 
work package tendering opportunities. 
Early Contractor Involvement procurement processes on 
construction projects such as the John Hunter Health and 
Innovation Precinct, is yielding tangible design and 
commercial benefits for the capital program.
Payment and revenue portals
Payment Portal
A new NSW Health Payment Portal was delivered by 
eHealth NSW to manage sundry debtor invoices across 
29 NSW Health entities. The portal provides a consistent, 
secure and user-friendly digital experience. The portal was 
part of the Cash Transformation Program which is a 
collaboration with eHealth NSW, NSW Ministry of Health, 
NSW Treasury, HealthShare NSW and local health districts 
to simplify banking structures, increase efficiency and 
improve user experiences. 
During the year, NSW Health commenced consultation 
and research on a single patient billing system for use 
across all local health districts. 
The development and implementation of the Payments 
Portal across NSW Health is focused on standardised, 
digital functionality for patients and customers paying 
invoices. The new central Health Payments Portal went 
live in November 2022 helping to standardise and simplify 
online payments for local health organisations.
A new Revenue Portal was rolled out and provides a 
statewide view of operational data to assist with capturing 
revenue from patient fees. The portal has streamlined 
administrative and billing management functions: 
improved patient and staff experience, and provides 
standardised statewide reporting on chargeable and 
compensable patients utilising NSW public hospitals to 
support the provision of health care in a more financially 
sustainable way.

Annual Report 2022–23   :  Management and accountability   :  page 70
Governance 
NSW Health relies on 
frameworks and structures 
that promote excellence 
in healthcare management 
and service delivery to 
provide a world-class 
health system that delivers 
essential services. 
Our governance structure, financial frameworks and 
approach to risk management ensure our commitment
to health services are needs-based and we provide safe, 
high-quality, and patient-centred care for the people of NSW.
NSW Health comprises the NSW Ministry of Health 
(a public service department under the Government Sector 
Employment Act 2013) and the various NSW Health 
organisations making up the NSW public health system, 
including local health districts and specialty health networks 
(see the NSW Health organisational chart on page X). 
The NSW Ministry of Health is the system manager for 
NSW Health. NSW Health organisations are governed 
by an accountable authority – either a board or a chief 
executive, or both. The Corporate Governance and 
Accountability Compendium outlines the governance 
requirements that apply to the organisations that 
form part of NSW Health and sets out the roles, 
relationships and responsibilities of each organisation. 
A copy is available at health.nsw.gov.au
Clinical governance
The NSW Ministry of Health Patient Safety First Unit, 
in collaboration with the Clinical Excellence Commission, 
is responsible for monitoring the quality and safety 
of the NSW public health system and for providing 
leadership in clinical governance. 
NSW Health is committed to partnering with patients, 
consumers, families and carers in healthcare decision 
making and improving staff culture and wellbeing to 
enable provision of high-quality care. 
Across NSW Health, clinical governance systems are 
aligned to the five components of the National Model 
Clinical Governance Framework:
•	Governance, leadership and culture
•	Patient safety and quality improvement systems
•	Clinical performance and effectiveness
•	Safe environment for the delivery of care
•	Partnering with consumers.
Incident management in NSW Health is governed by the 
principles of immediacy, accountability and kindness. 
Health leaders, clinicians and teams act immediately when 
people are harmed or at risk of harm. NSW Health supports 
all who are affected. Our health system is open when 
incidents occur, and incident reviews drive learning and 
improvement actions. 
Local health districts and specialty health networks have 
primary responsibility for providing safe, high-quality care 
for patients. To protect patients from harm and ensure the 
quality of health services, hospitals, dental services and 
oral health clinics within hospitals must be accredited. 
Accreditation is determined by assessment against the 
National Safety and Quality Health Service Standards, 
in accordance with the Australian Health Services Safety 
and Quality Accreditation Scheme. From 1 July 2023, 
assessments to the Standards transitioned to a short 
notice assessments program.
The Clinical Excellence Commission risk-assessed notification 
of 828 medical device, medicine and biological agent issues 
in 2022-23. Of these, 17 required a system-wide critical 
response and 47 required an urgent Safety Alert Broadcast. 
Seventeen critical device issues and 12 urgent medicines 
issues required rapid activation of an inter-agency 
management team, each with weekly to fortnightly meetings.
Feedback and complaints 
At NSW Health we listen to feedback, and encourage 
patients, their families and carers to share their healthcare 
experiences. This is to ensure we meet our commitment of 
value-based, patient-centred care. 
The NSW Health incident management system (ims+) 
records consumer feedback and complaints. In 2022-23 
there were 14,980 complaints recorded, a decrease from 
17,806 in the previous year*. The top five issues related to 
clinical care, communication, timing and access, patient 
rights and management of facilities.

Finance and performance management
Organisation performance monitoring and review of 
financial management form a key part of the system of 
internal controls for public health organisations. 
Chief executives and boards are responsible for putting 
into place appropriate arrangements to: 
•	ensure the efficiency and effectiveness of resource 
utilisation by public health organisations
•	regularly review the adequacy and effectiveness of 
organisational financial and performance management 
arrangements.
NSW Health Performance Framework
The NSW Health Performance Framework (the 
Framework) outlines the NSW Ministry of Health (the 
Ministry) process for setting performance expectations 
and monitoring performance of public sector health and 
support services. 
The Framework clearly outlines the process of assessing 
the level of performance of each health service. It allows 
the Ministry to identify and acknowledge sustained high 
performance with the view for lessons to be shared across 
NSW Health. Where under performance is identified, 
the Framework sets out the process to escalate concerns 
and ensure support is available to remediate performance. 
The Framework and associated key performance 
indicators listed in service agreements apply at both 
whole-of-health-service and facility or service levels, 
promoting and supporting a high-performance culture. 
The Framework applies to: 
•	The 15 geographical NSW local health districts and other 
NSW Health services: NSW Ambulance, Sydney 
Children’s Hospitals Network, St Vincent’s Health 
Network, Justice Health and Forensic Mental Health 
Network and affiliated health organisations 
•	NSW Health support organisations: Agency for Clinical 
Innovation, Bureau of Health Information, Cancer 
Institute NSW, Clinical Excellence Commission, Health 
Education and Training Institute, HealthShare NSW 
and NSW Health Pathology.
*These figures exclude complaints recorded by 
St Vincent’s Health Network and are subject to change 
via ongoing data verification processes.
Service agreements
Service agreements are a central component of the 
Performance Framework. They clearly set out the service 
delivery and performance expectations for funding and 
other support provided to local health districts, other 
health services and support organisations. 
Annual service agreements between the NSW Ministry 
of Health and local health districts and specialty health 
networks include budgets for the level and mix of services 
each health service needs for their communities. Funding 
decisions consider the outcomes for patients, carers, 
staff and the public health system, and funding adjustors 
are used to incentivise value-based care.
Audit and risk management
NSW Health policy requires public health organisations 
to maintain effective, independent audit frameworks and 
corporate governance practices consistent with NSW 
public sector best practices. Enterprise-wide risks are 
managed through continuous monitoring and risk control 
(policy, procedures and guidelines), which are reflected in 
the NSW Health Enterprise-wide Risk Management Policy. 
Audit and risk management committees
Each public health organisation must establish an audit 
and risk management committee, which is a key 
component in the public health organisation’s corporate 
governance framework. It oversees: 
•	internal controls and internal audit 
•	enterprise risk management 
•	business continuity plans 
•	disaster recovery plans 
•	corruption and fraud prevention 
•	external accountability and external audit 
•	compliance with applicable laws and regulations.
Internal auditing at the Ministry
Internal Audit provides an independent review and 
advisory service to the Secretary and the Risk 
Management and Audit Committee. It provides assurance 
that the NSW Ministry of Health’s financial and operational 
controls, designed to manage the organisation’s risks 
and achieve its objectives, are operating in an efficient, 
effective and ethical manner. 
Internal Audit assists management in improving business 
performance, advises on fraud and corruption risks, and 
internal controls over business functions and processes.

External agency oversight
Several statutory and government agencies are involved 
in the oversight and governance of NSW public health 
organisations. These include the NSW Ombudsman, 
Information and Privacy Commission, Independent 
Commission Against Corruption, NSW Treasury, 
Department of Premier and Cabinet, the Auditor-General, 
Audit Office of NSW and the Public Accounts Committee 
of the NSW Parliament.
NSW Ombudsman
The NSW Ombudsman tabled one report involving 
NSW Health during 2022-23. The NSW Child Death 
Review Team Annual Report 2021-22 was tabled 
in Parliament on 25 October 2022. 
The tabled report, including relevant data and updates 
on implementation of previous recommendations, was 
provided by NSW Health and can be accessed on the 
Ombudsman’s website: ombo.nsw.gov.au. 
Audit Office of NSW
The Audit Office of NSW fulfils an external oversight 
function, undertaking financial audits, performance audits 
and compliance audits each year. In addition to the 
three types of audits, the Audit Office also tables special 
reports on internal controls.
In 2022-23, the Audit Office tabled two performance 
audit reports in Parliament concerning NSW Health: 
1.	New South Wales COVID-19 Vaccine Rollout 
2.	
Coordination of the Response to COVID-19 
(June to November 2021).

The NSW Ministry of Health, together with 24 other 
large NSW Government agencies, was involved in the 
preparation of the Auditor General’s report: Internal 
Controls and Governance 2022, tabled on 20 December 
2022. The focus of the report was on whole of 
government internal control risks, controls on information 
technology, management of cyber risks and risks 
associated with over reliance on consultants and 
contractors.
All tabled reports, including the related response 
from NSW Health on performance audits, are available 
at audit.nsw.gov.au. 
Public Accounts Committee 
of the NSW Parliament
The Public Accounts Committee reviews performance 
audit reports tabled by the Auditor-General of NSW in 
Parliament as part of a 12-month follow-up program, 
with status updates being sought from NSW Health on the 
implementation of the audit recommendations that were 
accepted by NSW Health. In 2022-23, a submission was 
made to the Committee on the performance audit report 
Access to Health Services in Custody, which was originally 
tabled on 23 September 2021.
Events arising after the end 
of the annual reporting period
No other events have arisen subsequent to the 
end of the annual reporting period that would have 
a significant effect on financial operations, 
other operations and clientele and the community 
that would require the annual report to be amended.
Modern Slavery Act 2018
No specific issues have been raised by the Anti-Slavery 
Commissioner concerning the operations of NSW Health 
during the financial year. The Anti-Slavery Commissioner 
has provided draft Guidance to the Modern Slavery 
Working Group and NSW Health has provided comments 
as a member of the group.
NSW Health submitted its annual Modern Slavery Report 
in December 2022 in relation to the Commonwealth 
Modern Slavery Act commitments. HealthShare NSW is 
currently developing a Modern Slavery Action Plan. 
Modern Slavery guidance is provided in NSW Health’s 
Procurement Policy Procedures.
A Modern Slavery component was included in the 
NSW Health policy training provided to approximately 
700 staff in 2022 and within the ongoing Procurement 
Academy training.

Departures from Core Requirement 
I, Ms Susan Pearce, Secretary, NSW Health, advise that the internal audit and risk 
management processes for the Ministry of Health depart from the Core Requirements 
set out in the Internal Audit and Risk Management Policy for the General Government 
Sector. 
The circumstances giving rise to the departure have been determined by the Responsible 
Minister and the Ministry of Health is implementing the following practicable alternative 
measures to meet the Core Requirements 
Departure from Policy/Procedure 
Reason for departure and description of practicable 
alternative measures implemented / being 
implemented 
Core Requirement 1.2 
The Accountable Authority shall establish 
and maintain a risk management framework 
that is appropriate for the agency. The 
Accountable Authority shall ensure the 
framework is consistent with AS ISO 
31000:2018.  
The Ministry prioritised its system manager role to 
develop and implement the Enterprise-wide Risk 
Management Policy Directive (PD2022_023) for all of 
NSW Health in the first instance. 
The Ministry of Health is now in the process of 
developing a risk management framework for itself. 
The risk management framework will be consistent 
with TPP20-08 and, PD2022_023 and industry 
standards. 
The risk management framework is planned to be 
implemented before the end of the 2023 calendar 
year. 
I, Ms Susan Pearce, Secretary, NSW Health, declare that this Internal Audit and Risk 
Management Attestation is made in respect of the consolidated accounts, verified 
through an annual attestation statement submitted to the Ministry of Health by the Chief 
Executive, of the following controlled entities: 
Central Coast Local Health District 
The Sydney Children’s Hospitals Network 
Far West Local Health District 
Western NSW Local Health District 
Hunter New England Local Health District

Departures from Local Policy 
I, Ms Susan Pearce, Secretary, NSW Health, advise that the internal audit and risk 
management processes for the controlled entities of the Ministry of Health depart from 
the policy requirements outlined below, as set out in the Internal Audit policy 
(PD2022_022) and Enterprise-wide Risk Management (PD2022_023) for the NSW Health. 
The circumstances giving rise to these departures have been determined by the 
Secretary, as system manager, as an exception, and the following practicable alternative 
measures to meet the core requirements have been implemented. 
Departure from Policy/Procedure 
Reason for departure and description of practicable 
alternative measures implemented / being 
implemented 
Local Procedure: 
PD2022_022 
2.1 Chief Audit Executive 
The Chief Audit Executive must not have the 
Chief Financial Officer (or equivalent) as a 
direct report. 
One Health Organisation’s Chief Operating Officer 
held the Chief Audit Executive role. The Chief 
Financial Officer was a direct report of the Chief 
Operating Officer.  
The departure from policy will be resolved in the 
2023/24 financial year. 
Local Procedure: 
PD2022_022 
2.5 Internal Audit 
The organisation’s enterprise-wide risk 
management framework must be the 
subject of an internal audit at least once 
every five years. 
One Health organisation sought to complete the 
internal audit of the framework next financial year 
due to Enterprise Risk Management personnel and 
structural reporting changes.  
The audit is now scheduled in 2023/24 financial year 
once the changes are established. The organisation’s 
Audit and Risk Committee members are supportive of 
the approach. 
Local Procedure: 
PD2022_022 
2.6 Internal Audit Quality Assurance and 
Improvement Program 
An external assessment of the internal audit 
function is to be conducted at least once 
every five years by a qualified, independent 
assessor selected in consultation with the 
Audit and Risk Committee. 
 
Two Health Organisations did not complete an 
independent quality assurance review of the Internal 
Audit function within the five-year period.  
1.
Delay was due to change in audit model with
new auditors and disruptions by COVID. The
external review of the Internal Audit function
has commenced and will be completed by the
end of 2023.
2.
The last review was finalised April 2017 and
the assessment was instead scheduled as part
of the 2022-23 Internal Audit Plan. The
external assessment of the internal audit
function is scheduled for completion by end of
2023.

Annual Report 2022–23   :  Management and accountability   :  page 76
Local Procedure: 
PD2022_022 
3.1.1 Appointment of a Chair 
The Chair of the Audit and Risk Committee is 
to be appointed for a single term only, of at 
least three years and not greater than five 
years.  
The total period of membership on the 
Committee must not exceed eight years. 
Two NSW Health Organisations sought that the Chair 
be appointed to the Committee for a single term of 
less than three years.   
In both organisations, the previous Chair declined an 
extension/retired and to retain knowledge within the 
Committee, proposed offering the position to an 
existing member of the Committee. As the members 
were experienced with years already on the 
Committee, to ensure the total membership did not 
exceed eight years, appointments under the three-
year term were granted exception. 
One NSW Health organisation sought to extend the 
term of a Chair which would exceed the eight-year 
total membership. 
The extension allowed the transfer of knowledge to a 
new member of the Committee who would succeed as 
Chair. 
These processes, including the practicable alternative measures implemented, 
demonstrate that the Ministry of Health has established and maintained frameworks, 
including systems, processes and procedures for appropriately managing audit and risk 
within the Ministry of Health.

Public accountability 
Public interest disclosures
NSW Health values the contributions of staff to improve 
administrative and management practices. Staff can report 
any alleged wrongdoing under the Public Interest 
Disclosures Act 1994. NSW Health has a Public Interest 
Disclosures Policy (PD2016_027) which covers 
management of public interest disclosures across all NSW 
Health organisations.
During 2022-23 NSW Health organisations received 
59 public interest disclosures. Forty-one were made by 
staff in the course of their day-to-day functions, and 18 fell 
into the category of ‘all other public interest disclosures’.
Of the 59 public interest disclosures received, 53 primarily 
related to reports alleging corruption and six related to 
allegations of maladministration.
Across NSW Health, 50 public interest disclosures were 
finalised during the 2022-23 period.
The number of public interest disclosure reports received 
in the 2022-23 financial year is up slightly from the 57 
reports received in the 2021-22 reporting period.
Public interest disclosure coordinators for NSW Health 
implement tailored staff awareness strategies to suit their 
organisational needs. NSW Health organisations used 
training provided by representatives from the NSW 
Ombudsman, internal staff briefings, e-learning, and 
employee induction training to improve awareness. 
Information about public interest disclosures is available on 
intranet sites. 
NSW Health has also worked during the year in preparing 
policy, training and implementation resources to support 
the commencement of the Public Interest Disclosures Act 
2022, which will commence on 1 October 2023.
Government Information 
(Public Access) Act 2009
The NSW Ministry of Health regularly reviews information 
on its website and routinely uploads information that may 
be of interest to the public. This includes a wide range of 
publications and resources including reports, fact sheets, 
brochures and pamphlets. Information is also available in 
other languages from the NSW Multicultural Health 
Communication Service website. 
During 2022-23 the Ministry received 153 formal access 
applications under the Government Information (Public 
Access) Act 2009 (the GIPA Act), including 36 applications 
and four appeals carried over from the 2021-22 reporting 
year. Of the 153 applications received, 23 applications were 
transferred to other agencies for completion. During this 
reporting year, 25 applications were initially assessed as 
invalid, for not complying with the formal requirements of 
section 41 of the GIPA Act, with nine applications 
subsequently becoming valid requests. 
There were 38 informal GIPA requests processed, 25 
external third party consultation requests, as well as 35 
disclosure log requests, processed within the 2022-23 
reporting period. A total of 108 formal applications were 
decided within the reporting period. There were a further 
six applications received that were un-decided, as well as 
two applications under review, as of 30 June 2023.
Nine internal reviews were conducted in 2022-23, with 
25 external reviews completed by the Information 
Commissioner and the NSW Civil and Administrative 
Tribunal in this same period. Of the 34 appeals finalised 
during this reporting year, the original decision was upheld 
in 30 appeals.
Of the 108 formal access applications decided in 2022-23, 
the NSW Ministry of Health made six decisions to refuse 
access to information referred to in Schedule 1 of the GIPA 
Act (four in full and two in part), where there was a 
conclusive presumption of overriding public interest 
against disclosure. 
Twenty decisions were made to release information in full, 
with nine decisions made to refuse access to part of the 
information requested. A further nine applications resulted 
in a full refusal of access to some, or all, the information 
requested. There were a further 49 decisions made that 
the information requested was not held by the NSW 
Ministry of Health, and 16 decisions were made that the 
information is already available to the applicant. In addition, 
25 decisions were made to refuse to deal with the 
application in full or in part, and 12 applications were 
withdrawn by the applicant.
Statistical information regarding formal access 
applications received during 2022-23 is provided in 
the following tables.

Internal Review
The Privacy and Personal Information Protection Act 1988 
provides a formalised structure for managing privacy 
complaints relating to this Act and the Health Records 
and Information Privacy Act 2002. This process is known 
as ‘internal review’. 
During 2022-23, the NSW Ministry of Health received one 
application for internal review under the Privacy and 
Personal Information Protection Act 1988 and Health Records 
and Information Privacy Act 2002. No breach of either Act 
was found.

Our people
The NSW Health Workforce 
Plan 2022-32 is a 10-year 
strategic statewide workforce 
plan that aligns with, 
supports and reinforces NSW 
Health’s Future Health goals. 
The plan outlines the NSW Ministry of Health workforce 
vision and its urgent system priorities to achieve this vision. 
It builds on the achievements of the Health Professionals 
Workforce Plan 2012-22 and provides a delivery framework 
to guide the implementation of Future Health’s workforce-
related strategies across the health system. It supports the 
state’s health workforce to deliver safe, reliable and 
person-centred care, driving the best outcomes and 
experiences for NSW residents.
NSW Health continues to employ graduate nurses and 
midwives to ensure a sustainable workforce into the 
future. The NSW Health Nursing and Midwifery Office 
coordinates the statewide graduate nurse and midwife 
recruitment with over 3,000 graduates employed 
across NSW Health in 2022. 
A total of 93% of Aboriginal nursing and midwifery 
GradStart candidates interviewed were offered graduate 
positions in 2023, and all Aboriginal Nursing and Midwifery 
Cadetship and Scholarship recipients interviewed were 
offered graduate positions as nurses or midwives.
NSW Health continued its highly successful annual 
medical recruitment campaign for Junior Medical Officers 
who have completed their first two years of postgraduate 
medical training. The annual recruitment campaign 
provides an opportunity for junior doctors to apply for 
positions in a range of specialties including general 
medicine, intensive and emergency care, pain management 
and psychiatry. The 2023 campaign resulted in the 
employment of more than 6,100 Junior Medical Officers 
for NSW Health, providing junior doctors with a valuable 
opportunity to work with world-class senior clinicians and 
to train in rotations across different clinical settings and 
geographic locations. 
In 2023, there were 1,120 medical intern positions, an 
increase of 46 from 2022. Of these, 176 were rural 
preferential recruitment positions. Interns recruited 
through the rural preferential pathway spend their first 
two years working in a rural location. 
Building positive workplace culture
Our workplaces strive to make continuous improvement 
to workplace culture. Each year, NSW Health makes it a 
priority to track employee engagement and workplace 
culture. This is done through the NSW People Matter 
Employee Survey, the NSW public sector’s annual 
employee opinion survey. 
The survey asks employees about their experience and 
perceptions of a range of workplace issues and practices, 
including management and leadership, service delivery, 
employee engagement, diversity and inclusion, public 
sector values, and unacceptable conduct. 
The survey is conducted by the NSW Public Service 
Commission with assistance from NSW public sector 
agencies and Big Village, an external service provider. 
Big Village (which was previously known as ENGINE) is a 
member of the Association of Market and Social Research 
Organisations (AMSRO) and adheres to the Privacy 
(Market and Social Research) Code 2014 (the Code).

Responding to bullying and complaints
NSW Health agencies implemented local strategies to 
reduce the incidence of bullying and unacceptable 
behaviour and enhance positive and productive workplace 
culture. In addition, agencies also implemented the 
following statewide strategies: 
•	Anti-bullying management advisors, responsible for 
collaborating and knowledge sharing on best practice 
initiatives, using this information pool to improve 
communication, guide future processes and coach 
managers on effective bullying management strategies 
•	The confidential Anti-Bullying Advice Line, responsible for 
provision of guidance and information to employees about 
the complaint resolution process 
•	Bullying data collection where NSW Health organisations 
are responsible to report individual complaint data to the 
NSW Ministry of Health, where complaints are initially 
assessed as potential bullying complaints 
•	Addressing Grievances and Concerns Managers’ and 
Staff Portal – web portals to support managers and staff 
across NSW Health to address grievances and concerns, 
including bullying, appropriately and as soon as they arise 
•	Bullying Risk Assessment Tool is to be launched to assist 
health organisations assess the potential of bullying in the 
workplace with an aim to prevent or minimise the risk of 
psychological injury. 
NSW Health has made a concerted effort to improve the 
accuracy of bullying complaint reporting. There were 128 
bullying complaints between 1 July 2022 to 30 June 2023, 
up from 66 complaints in 2021-22. These complaints 
represent 0.09% of the total full-time equivalent staff in 
the NSW Health System (based on full-time equivalent 
staff as of 30 June 2023). The NSW Ministry of Health has 
also implemented an Addressing Grievances and Concerns 
Staff Portal, which contains extensive tools to educate and 
assist staff on self-resolving grievances with the other 
party and to participate in the grievance process when the 
matter is escalated to their manager.
Workforce diversity
NSW Health welcomes people of diverse backgrounds and 
recognises the crucial role a sense of belonging plays in 
delivering an effective, functioning, diverse and inclusive 
workplace. 
The Diversity Inclusion Belonging resource hub provides 
direction to NSW Health organisations to help them 
meet the diversity and inclusion targets set under the 
Premier’s Priorities. 
The NSW Health human resources information system has 
been modified to allow a person with disability, an 
Aboriginal person or a person who is serving, or has served, 
in the Australian Defence Force to self-identify, resulting in 
more accurate NSW Health diversity data that reflects our 
workforce and the community it serves. 
Together, the Centre for Aboriginal Health and the 
Workforce Planning and Talent Development Branch 
fund 20 cadetships per year as a workforce target and 
reflects the priorities of the “NSW Health Workforce Plan 
2022- 2032”. The program has been managed by the 
Health Education and Training Institute. The Aboriginal 
Allied Health Cadetship supported 16 Cadets throughout 
the 2022-2023 financial year.
Aboriginal workforce representation continues to develop 
across the breadth of role types in NSW Health services. 
NSW Health continues to set specific workforce 
targets to drive improvements in the establishment of 
the Aboriginal Health Practitioner role across clinical 
multidisciplinary teams. 
NSW Health has established a stretch target of 16 
Aboriginal people in leadership roles by 2025, exceeding 
the previous goal of doubling Aboriginal people in 
leadership roles from five to 10 by 2025 and achieving 
11 Aboriginal senior leaders by December 2020. 
As of June 2023, 26 Aboriginal people were employed 
in a senior leadership role. 
The cultural safety of NSW Health’s Aboriginal workforce 
and client group continues to be a priority. The focus is to 
address racism and unconscious bias through the delivery 
of the Respecting the Difference – an Aboriginal cultural 
training program – as well as refreshing the program to 
drive improvements into the future.

Note: 1. The benchmark of 50% for representation of women across the sector is intended to reflect the gender composition of the 
NSW community. 2. The NSW Public Sector Aboriginal Employment Strategy 2014 – 17 introduced an aspirational target of 1.8% by 2021 for 
each of the sector’s salary bands. If the aspirational target of 1.8% is achieved in salary bands not currently at or above 1.8%, the cumulative 
representation of Aboriginal employees in the sector is expected to reach 3.3%. 3. A benchmark from the Australian Bureau of Statistics 
(ABS) Census of Population and Housing has been included for People whose First Language Spoken as a Child was not English. The ABS 
Census does not provide information about first language, but does provide information about country of birth. The benchmark of 23.2% is 
the percentage of the NSW general population born in a country where English is not the predominant language. 4. In December 2017 the 
NSW Government announced the target of doubling the representation of people with disability in the NSW public sector from an estimated 
2.7% to 5.6% by 2027. More information can be found at: Jobs for People with Disability: A plan for the NSW public sector. The benchmark 
for ‘People with Disability Requiring Work-Related Adjustment’ was not updated.

Note: 1. A Distribution Index score of 100 indicates that the distribution of members of the Workforce Diversity group across salary bands 
is equivalent to that of the rest of the workforce. A score less than 100 means that members of the Workforce Diversity group tend to be 
more concentrated at lower salary bands than is the case for other staff. The more pronounced this tendency is, the lower the score will be. 
In some cases, the index may be more than 100, indicating that members of the Workforce Diversity group tend to be more concentrated 
at higher salary bands than is the case for other staff. 2. The Distribution Index is not calculated when the number of employees in the 
Workforce Diversity group is less than 20 or when the number of other employees is less than 20.

Workplace health and safety
In 2022-23, NSW Health continued to enhance the 
policy framework to ensure a best practice approach to 
health and safety. 
Policies and guidelines reviewed and released 
in 2022-23 were:
Work Health and Safety Audits (PD2023_010)
This policy sets out the requirement for NSW Health 
organisations to undertake work health and safety (WHS) 
audits. Audits are conducted to determine the 
effectiveness of management systems, to identify the 
strengths and opportunities for improvements and to 
ensure compliance with the WHS legislation and NSW 
Health policies and procedures. This policy provides a 
consistent, effective approach for gathering information 
on which a NSW Health organisation can plan and 
implement WHS improvements.
Fatigue Management in NSW Health 
Workplaces (GL2023_012)
This guideline provides a risk management approach for 
managing work-related fatigue. It includes guidance on 
identifying areas at increased risk for work-related fatigue, 
assessing the work, health and safety-related issues and 
providing strategies to eliminate work-related fatigue as 
much as possible or to minimise its impact where it cannot 
be eliminated.
Employee Assistance Programs 
(PD2022_048)
This policy directive outlines standards for Employee 
Assistance Programs (EAPs) to ensure employees have 
access to effective assistance services. 
NSW Ministry of Health has also developed a Mental 
Health and Wellbeing Framework intended to provide 
strategic direction for the creation of psychologically safe 
workplaces where psychosocial risks are identified, 
eliminated or controlled. Work has commenced on an 
action plan to ensure the implementation of the framework. 
A program of security audits has commenced across NSW 
Health workplaces to ensure compliance with NSW Health 
security standards. A wide range of supporting resources 
have been developed to assist frontline managers identify 
and manage security-related risks in their workplaces.
Additionally, a range of training programs have been 
provided across NSW Health including:
• Certificate II in Security Operations: this is the pre-
qualification program to be completed by individuals 
who are seeking to hold a NSW security licence. 
This program has allowed hospitals to enhance the 
existing security workforce.
• Security in the Health Environment: this program builds 
on the current skills of existing NSW Health security staff 
to provide effective and appropriate security operations 
in a therapeutic health environment.
• Security auditor training: this program ensures staff 
involved in local security auditing have the capability 
and expertise to undertake robust audits.
Workers compensation
In 2022-23, NSW Health supported its workplaces with 
a range of practice guides to continue to improve 
rehabilitation, injury management and recover at work 
practices.
The NSW Ministry of Health is progressing strategies to:
• facilitate opportunities to enhance recovery at work 
through the identification and sharing of suitable duties
• identify and mitigate psychosocial issues for workers 
following a workplace injury
• reduce risk associated with Work Injury Damages (WDI) 
claims.
Prosecutions under the Work 
Health and Safety Act 2011
There were no prosecutions against the NSW Ministry of 
Health under the Work Health and Safety Act in 2022-23.

NSW LGBTIQ+ Health 
Strategy 2022-2027
The NSW LGBTIQ+ Health Strategy 2022-2027 provides 
direction to all NSW Health organisations and staff, so that 
collectively the system can deliver the best care to 
LGBTIQ+ people and work with them to achieve optimal 
health and wellbeing.
Delivery of the strategy is supported by an implementation 
plan and guided by a committee comprising 
representatives from NSW Health, Primary Health 
Networks, St Vincent’s Hospital Sydney, the University of 
Sydney, the University of NSW and community 
organisations, including BlaQ Aboriginal Corporation, 
ACON, The Gender Centre, Twenty10, Trans Pride Australia 
and Intersex Human Rights Australia.
In the strategy’s first year of implementation, NSW Health 
has realised many significant steps forward:
•	Provided funding to establish a LGBTQ+ Health Centre in 
Sydney
•	Facilitated the NSW LGBTIQ+ Health Fund to kickstart 
over 20 local projects across the health system to achieve 
actions under the strategy
•	Committed funding and strengthened community 
partnerships to enhance mental health and suicide 
prevention initiatives in LGBTIQ+ communities
•	Provided specialist multidisciplinary health services for 
trans and gender diverse young people and their families 
through a statewide service
•	Implemented a discovery project to investigate 
improvements for collecting data in the NSW Health 
System on gender, sexuality, intersex variations and other 
variables
•	Provided LGBTIQ+ inclusion training in collaboration with 
Twenty10 and Intersex Human Rights Australia to over 
200 staff at the NSW Health head office
•	Promoted the strategy to international delegates at the 
Sydney WorldPride Human Rights Conference 2023
•	Delivered a cross-organisational response to support a 
healthy and safe Sydney WorldPride 2023.
The pivotal strength of the strategy’s successful 
implementation is the partnerships that have been built 
with communities. These relationships acknowledge the 
depth of lived experience, trauma, resilience, passion, pride 
and possibilities.
Disability Inclusion Action Plan
The NSW Health Disability Inclusion Action Plan 2016-2019 
supports improved access to quality healthcare and 
employment for people with disability. It remains ongoing 
until a new plan is released in early 2024. The new plan will 
reflect NSW Health’s continued commitment to providing 
equitable and dignified access to services and employment 
for people regardless of disability and align with Australia’s 
Disability Strategy 2021-2031.
Key achievements in 2022-23 include:
• The Intellectual Disability Health Service (IDHS), which 
provides clinical assessment and referral for people with 
intellectual disability and complex health needs, saw 943 
clients in 2022. The IDHS also offers advice, education 
and clinical supports to general practitioners and NSW 
Health staff to build the capacity of mainstream health 
services to respond to the needs of people with 
intellectual disability and their carers.
• In collaboration with the Department of Developmental 
Disability Neuropsychiatry, University of NSW (3DN):

NSW Carers (Recognition) Act 2010
NSW Health recognises and acknowledges carers’ unique 
knowledge and experience. Carers play an important role 
in supporting the health and wellbeing of people across 
the state. NSW Health seeks to provide timely, responsive, 
appropriate and accessible supports through a variety of 
initiatives and programs across the state.
NSW Health has begun the review and update of the 
NSW Health Recognition and Support for Carers: Key 
Directions. This document is designed to provide a 
framework for NSW Health’s response to the needs 
of carers across the NSW public health system. The 
updated document will focus on the three main groups of 
carers involved with NSW Health’s services – carers of 
patients, patients who are carers, and NSW Health staff 
who are carers, outlining system-level work that enables 
support for these groups.
This year NSW Health also partnered with Department of 
Communities and Justice and committed to several actions 
in the NSW Carers Strategy Action Plan 2023–2024. Work 
has started to review NSW Health's approach to data 
around carers and to implement the Family and Carer 
Mental Health Program evaluation recommendations. 
NSW Health is also committed to reviewing available 
resources and information for carers, which will 
commence in coming months.
NSW Health local carer support services across NSW 
continue to assist carers to access appropriate services 
and current information, as well as raise awareness of 
carers and their needs.
Multicultural health 
Multicultural NSW oversees 
the Multicultural Policies 
and Services Program. 
It is a whole-of-government initiative focused on ensuring 
government agencies implement the principles of 
multiculturalism through their strategic plans and deliver 
inclusive and equitable services to the public. 
In 2022-23 NSW Health has continued to ensure the 
health system is accessible and responsive to the needs 
of culturally and linguistically diverse (CALD) people. 
The NSW Health Plan for Healthy Culturally and 
Linguistically Diverse Communities 2019-2023 aligns with 
the Multicultural Policies and Services Program 
Framework and is a statewide policy for meeting the 
health needs 
of CALD consumers in NSW. The plan focuses on access 
and quality of healthcare; health literacy; cultural 
responsiveness; and understanding community 
health needs. 
In 2022-23 NSW Health published the NSW Refugee 
Health Plan 2022-27. The plan outlines NSW Health's 
commitment to meeting the health needs of people from 
refugee backgrounds. The plan takes a culturally 
responsive, trauma-informed, and strengths-based 
approach to support people from refugee backgrounds to 
be healthy, thriving members of NSW.
In 2021-22 the Health and Social Policy Branch launched 
a new NSW Refugee Health Flexible Fund which provided 
over $2 million across a two-year period to 15 initiatives 
which aim to improve health access, equity and outcomes 
for patients from refugee backgrounds. 
Initiatives have focused on creating and improving 
culturally appropriate models of care, improving access to 
in-language health resources and information, cultural 
sensitivity education and awareness for NSW Health staff, 
and empowering refugee patients, their families and 
carers to be more involved in their care.

NSW Health improves access and quality 
of care for people from culturally and 
linguistically diverse backgrounds
Examples of significant work across each of the 
outcomes outlined in the NSW Health Plan for Healthy 
Culturally and Linguistically Diverse Communities 
2019-2023 and Multicultural Policies and Services 
Program Framework include: 
Cancer Institute NSW 
Cancer Institute NSW supported improvements in patient-
centred care through enhancing its patient-reported 
measures program. The program collects feedback about 
cancer patients’ experiences and outcomes, supporting 
discussions with patients and provision of tailored 
information and support. Surveys from the program 
were expanded to include an additional eight languages 
(Arabic, Vietnamese, Chinese simplified, Chinese 
traditional, Korean, Greek, Spanish and Italian) to increase 
accessibility for culturally and linguistically diverse (CALD) 
people. Multicultural consumers were actively engaged 
throughout the design and roll-out of the surveys. 
The surveys will allow CALD patients to provide feedback 
in their language on how care is affecting their wellbeing, 
which will enable clinicians to respond appropriately.
Centre for Oral Health Strategy
The Refugee and Asylum Seeker Oral Health Project has 
been running since 2021 and aims to promote culturally 
sensitive oral health care and improve access to preventive 
oral health advice and care. The project partners with local 
health district’s oral health services, refugee health 
services and multicultural health services, as well as local 
organisations. The program has now expanded across two 
metropolitan local health districts and has streamlined 
processes for refugee and asylum seeker patients, 
including improving access to interpreter services. 
This has enabled people from multicultural communities 
to prioritise dental care.
South Western Sydney Local Health District
The Natural Helper program is a consumer-partnership 
initiative which aims to better support patients from CALD 
backgrounds. The program enables healthcare providers 
working in chronic and complex care clinics to work with a 
volunteer consumer mentor from a CALD community. 
The consumer mentor has lived experience of a chronic 
condition, has successfully navigated healthcare for their 
condition and identifies with one of the target CALD 
communities. They volunteer in participating clinics, 
engage with healthcare providers on a regular basis and 
are matched with consenting patients for up to six months. 
They provide social and emotional support to patients, 
while also reinforcing messages from the healthcare team 
and encouraging patients to adopt an active role in their 
chronic disease management. Thirteen consumer mentors 
from Arabic, Assyrian and Vietnamese backgrounds are 
participating in the program.
Sydney Children’s Hospitals Network 
The Sydney Children’s Hospitals Network is delivering the 
Providing Enhanced Access to Healthcare project. The 
project aims to respond to the needs of CALD, refugee and 
asylum seeker communities by identifying issues and 
solutions through co-design. Key priorities identified 
through the project so far include: 
•	Enhancing access to medications: a patient resource is 
being developed to simplify the process of accessing and 
renewing medications to reduce patients and families 
needing to return to the hospital. This resource will be 
translated into a range of languages.
•	Developing solutions to improve access to care, including 
prioritising waitlists for CALD and refugee patients with 
chronic and complex conditions and/or disability: A 
statement of intent is being developed which outlines the 
network’s intention to support and prioritise care for 
priority populations, including refugees. Guidelines for 
implementation will be developed in conjunction with this 
statement. 
•	Enhancing care coordination, including a single point of 
contact and flexibility of appointment times. 
Western Sydney Local Health District
The Western Sydney Local Health District successfully 
secured funding to continue 20 years of ground-breaking 
work by its GambleAware Multicultural Service, which 
provides gambling counselling to CALD communities 
across NSW. Counselling is tailored to different cultural 
and linguistic needs and includes established referral 
pathways to care. The purpose of the model is to upskill 10 
mainstream GambleAware providers across metropolitan 
Sydney, regional and rural NSW to work with CALD 
communities. 
The district’s Health Care Interpreter Service and Clinical 
Research Support Unit collaborated on a project which 
sought to prioritise CALD and deaf patients' access to 
interpreter services for consultations related to clinical 
trials. This initiative is the first in NSW Health and has 
resulted in a dramatic increase in the number of CALD 
patients accessing lifesaving or life prolonging clinical trials.

simplifying bowel cancer screening for CALD 
communities. The program will provide community 
education in Arabic, Chinese, Kurmanji, Vietnamese and 
English.
Southern NSW Local Health District
The Population Health team at Southern NSW Local Health 
District has initiated a Multicultural Healthy Eating program 
in collaboration with local multicultural centres. The 
seven-week program provides healthy eating and active 
living messages. Evaluation has shown improved intake of 
fruit and vegetables, water and increased exercise.
Mental Health Branch, NSW Ministry of Health
The Ministry has funded the delivery of the Mental Health 
Community Living Supports for Refugees program. The 
program provides trauma-informed, recovery-oriented, 
culturally safe and responsive psychosocial supports to 
refugees and asylum seekers experiencing psychological 
distress, mental ill health and impaired functioning. The 
purpose of the program is to enable participants to recover 
and live independently in the community. Evaluation of the 
program shows that 165 consumers have received support 
from the program, which is more than double the minimum 
contracted benchmark of 79 consumers. The evaluation 
also showed the program is well received by consumers 
and the sector.

NSW Ambulance
NSW Ambulance is developing a Consumer and Community 
Engagement Framework and Patient Charter. This work 
included consultation with 11 consumers and two consumer 
representatives, including consumers from CALD 
backgrounds. The draft Patient Charter includes 
statements that support people from CALD backgrounds to 
be active partners in their healthcare.

The Breast Cancer Concierge Program delivers one-to-one, 
in-language phone support from trained, bilingual 
‘concierges’. The program aims to assist CALD patients, 
families and carers with health system navigation and 
support after a diagnosis of breast cancer. The district will 
continue to support improvements to the program based on 
evaluation outcomes and quality improvements programs.
South Eastern Sydney Local Health District
South Eastern Sydney Local Health District, in partnership 
with the NSW Multicultural Health Communication Service, 
published the Developing health resources for people from 
refugee backgrounds: Best practice guide for NSW Health 
staff. The guide highlights the need for greater health 
resources targeted towards CALD communities, including 
the need for audio-visual resources which are informed by 
the expertise of key stakeholders in NSW Health and 
community organisations who work with refugee 
communities. The guide was developed based on 
consultation with CALD communities. 
Centre for Population Health, 
NSW Ministry of Health
The Centre for Population Health has a range of population 
health strategies with a focus on priority populations 
including CALD background. These include:
•	NSW Hepatitis C Strategy 2022-2025, released in July

Agency for Clinical Innovation
The Agency for Clinical Innovation continued to develop the 
Health Outcome Patient Experience (HOPE) platform in 
partnership with eHealth NSW and the NSW Ministry of 
Health. The purpose of the platform is to store and manage 
information provided by patients through online surveys, 
enabling patients and multidisciplinary care teams to 
capture, review and act on data in a timely and holistic way. 
CALD patients and carers from 10 language groups were 
included in the development and user acceptance testing 
of the platform. Interpreters, CALD patients and carers 
were also involved in developing a report on the cultural 
appropriateness of various quality of life and mental health 
assessment tools.
South Western Sydney Local Health District
Changing Life Keep Your Balance is a seven-session 
community education program which aims to support 
vulnerable CALD communities in South Western Sydney 
who have been disproportionally impacted by the COVID-19 
pandemic. The program seeks to support healthy lifestyle 
choices and enhance mental health and wellbeing. A total 
of 18 programs were delivered in 118 sessions, reaching 225 
members from various CALD communities in South Western 
Sydney. Program evaluation shows that participants had 
improved mental health literacy, stress management, 
mental health status and family relationships, and that 
family members also benefited 
from the program.
Cancer Institute NSW
Cancer Institute NSW engaged CALD consumers to 
develop a variety of print, web and audio-visual resources 
on cancer prevention, screening, care and clinical trials. The 
resources were developed in 38 languages and support 
increased cancer literacy and improved patient experience 
for multicultural communities.
Central Coast Local Health District
As part of the Central Coast Multicultural Interagency, The 
Central Coast Local Health District delivered four 
community interpreter workshops to Adult Migrant English 
Program students at both Gosford and Wyong TAFE. There 
were 108 participants from 21 countries, with information 
provided about interpreter access and usage, and how staff 
and consumers could provide feedback to the district. 
Illawarra Shoalhaven Local Health District
Illawarra Shoalhaven Local Health District, in collaboration 
with Cancer Institute NSW, developed the Healthy Living 
and Cancer Screening project which aims to improve equity 
of outcomes for people affected by cancer from CALD 
backgrounds. The project specifically targeted the 
Macedonian community, with the Macedonian Welfare 
Association engaged to support the design, implementation 
and evaluation of the 12-month project. A key output of the 
project was a radio script promoting bowel cancer 
screening, which was developed in partnership with the 
Multicultural Health Communication Service. Macedonian 
consumers were directly involved in developing the script, 
with consumer representatives doing voiceovers. The 
project was evaluated with high levels of satisfaction, 
significant increase in screening knowledge and high levels 
of intention to engage in bowel screening tests. 
Murrumbidgee Local Health District
The Enhancing Paediatrics in Primary Care model seeks to 
provide support to general practitioners to care for children 
within the Murrumbidgee region who are experiencing

rehabilitation outcomes
•	A stakeholder survey to understand barriers, enablers 
and learning needs of rehabilitation professionals
•	Creation of a national dataset to understand rehabilitation 
outcomes for CALD patients nationally.
Western Sydney Local Health District
In 2023, Western Sydney Local Health District’s 
Epidemiology and Health Analytics team developed the 
Epidemiological Profile of Pacific People to examine the 
health of the Pacific Islander population in Australia. The 
profile highlighted that Pacific people experience poorer 
health, present to hospital late and have reduced 
engagement with health services.
In June 2023, the first Pacific Communities Health Forum, 
Towards Holistic Health for Pacific Communities, was 
organised to share the perspectives, needs and 
experiences of Pacific people and discuss pathways to 
improve engagement and health outcomes. The forum was 
attended by over 100 Pacific community/religious leaders 
and members, as well as health leaders from community 
health and acute services. It was an important step to 
establish trust and respectful relationships with the Pacific 
community and to work collaboratively to develop more 
holistic, culturally safe and responsive approaches to 
improve health.
Northern Sydney Local Health District
The Northern Sydney Local Health District Health 
Promotion Service surveyed 212 primary schools to better 
understand the health needs of CALD students and better 
direct attention and resources. Fifteen schools were 
identified where more than 80% of the student population 
speak a language other than English at home. Based on the 
survey findings, the service will ensure that these schools 
receive intensive support and additional resources from the 
School Years team in 2023-24.

Annual Report 2022–23   :  Sustainability   :  page 100
Human health and wellbeing 
are intrinsically linked to the 
environment in which we live.
More than ever, NSW Health is facing challenges related 
to our changing climate and the environmental impact 
of healthcare. There is considerable scientific evidence 
that climate change resulting primarily from greenhouse 
gas emissions is increasing the frequency and severity 
of extreme climate events. 
Researchers estimate that Australia’s health system 
contributes 7% of Australia’s total carbon footprint, and 
hospitals represent 34% of the total healthcare carbon 
footprint.1 As such, NSW Health has a responsibility, 
and the potential to find ways to reduce its emissions. 
NSW Health recognises that it must continue to deliver 
high quality healthcare alongside responding to climate 
risk. The effects of climate change will impact the ability 
of NSW Health to deliver services and manage population 
health, while driving increasing demands on the system. 
The delivery of an environmentally sustainable, climate 
resilient healthcare system is a key priority for NSW Health, 
and a system-wide program of work is already underway.
NSW Health’s Strategic Framework, Future Health: 
Guiding the next decade of care in NSW 2022-2032, clearly 
states this commitment. NSW Health is partnering with 
key stakeholders to progress this work, supporting the 
NSW Government’s commitment to deliver a 70% cut 
in emissions by 2035 (compared to 2005 levels) and to 
reach net zero emissions by 2050. 
To meet these challenges, NSW Health is taking action 
in the areas of governance, strategy, risk management, 
metrics and targets.

Environmental Sustainability
Improving resource efficiency and energy management 
are two key ways we can reduce CO2 emissions while 
also reducing electricity costs for NSW Health. 
A new energy management strategy for the coming 
decade will align with the Government Resource Efficiency 
Policy and the Net Zero Plan Implementation Update 
to ensure NSW Health will deliver its contribution to the 
State’s targets of a 50% reduction by 2030, and net zero 
emissions by 2050.
Energy management 
Electricity consumption decreased by 1.7% from last year, 
despite asset floor-space growth. 
A combination of energy efficiency measures, including 
numerous solar installations across the local health 
districts, have contributed to a decrease in NSW Health’s 
building energy consumption. On this basis, and along with 
a greening electricity-grid, net carbon emissions for NSW 
Health are falling (see table below).

Energy leadership across the system
NSW Health continues to show strong leadership within 
the public sector for renewable energy and energy 
efficiency projects. Nationally, NSW Health has the largest 
number of solar-power systems installed on public hospital 
rooftops in Australia.
In 2022-23, NSW Health rolled out an additional 10MWp 
of solar generated energy across the network, increasing 
the total generation capacity by about 30%. In addition to 
hospital rooftops, NSW Health now has solar installations 
at carparks across the state. The recently completed 
carpark solar systems at Liverpool and Maitland Hospitals 
have reduced electricity bills at each site. Together, these 
improvements are generating electricity each year which 
is equivalent to powering around 220 homes. The solar 
car parks also provide an opportunity to install electric 
vehicle charging stations. As electric vehicles become 
more common in NSW Health’s fleet, these car park solar 
systems will form part of the strategies employed by 
NSW Health to power the new vehicles in a more 
environmentally sustainable way.
All 15 NSW Health local health districts have solar 
installations installed or in planning at their major hospitals, 
with a generation capacity of more than 30MWp. This is 
enough to power about 8,600 average Australian homes 
and reduces the carbon footprint by approximately 36,800 
tonnes. This is equivalent to removing nearly 20,000 cars 
from the road every year. The combined financial savings 
from these solar installations will help reduce electricity 
costs by nearly $9 million per year, and these savings will 
only increase as electricity costs rise.
During 2022-23, NSW Health continued to roll out light 
emitting diodes (LED lights) across the network. LEDs are a 
very cost effective and highly energy efficient form of 
lighting and can replace older inefficient lighting in most 
applications. An additional $5.5 million in energy bill 
savings were realised in 2022-23 from using LEDs across 
many sites. 
In 2022-23, the NSW Health passenger fleet contained 
approximately 6,800 vehicles with over a third of the fleet 
comprised of low emission vehicles (hybrids and electric). 
NSW Health is transitioning the passenger fleet to fully 
electric vehicles in line with the NSW Government fleet 
electrification campaign. The program will see the 
progressive electrification of vehicles with 50% of new 
leases and purchases being fully electric vehicles by 2026 
and 100% by 2030. 
The NSW Ministry of Health is working with the system and 
in partnership with the Office of Energy and 
Climate Change to upgrade infrastructure and install 
charging points across the NSW Health network. 
The speed of fleet electrification will intensify over the 
coming years as electric cars become more mainstream 
and charging infrastructure at garaging locations becomes 
more readily available.

Implementation of price determination
The NSW State Efficient Price per national weighted 
activity unit (NWAU22) for 2022-23 was $5,095. NSW 
local health districts and specialty health networks were 
funded for their activity at this single price, with exception 
for some specific contractual funding arrangements. 
The NSW State Efficient Price is not directly comparable 
year on year due to changes in NWAU versions and 
local health district and specialty health network 
costing results.
Non-government funding
Each year, NSW Health allocates funding to non-
government organisations (NGOs) to deliver community 
based services supporting health and wellbeing, 
particularly for vulnerable or hard-to-reach populations. 
Aboriginal health, aged care, children, youth and families, 
chronic care and disability, community transport, drug 
and alcohol, mental health, palliative care, population 
health and women’s health are among the services 
for which NSW Health provides funding.

Commentary
Time for payment of accounts for the NSW Ministry of Health showed a consistent performance over the year. 
During the year, measures have been taken to ensure Ministry staff are aware of NSW Treasury Circular 11/21 including 
conducting training sessions to educate relevant personnel about invoice approval processes. Actions are taken 
to monitor and promptly follow up invoice payments. The NSW Ministry of Health was not required to make 
any payment of interest on overdue accounts related to small business suppliers in the 2022-23 financial year.

NSW Treasury Managed Fund
Insurable risks are covered by the NSW Treasury 
Managed Fund (TMF), of which the NSW Ministry of 
Health (and its controlled organisations) is a member 
agency. The Health portfolio is a significant proportion 
of the TMF Fund and is identified as an independent 
pool within the TMF Scheme.
NSW Treasury provides funding to NSW Health 
via a benchmark process. NSW Health pays deposit 
contributions to icare for workers compensation, 
motor vehicle, liability, property, and miscellaneous 
lines of business.
Workers’ compensation and motor vehicle contributions 
are actuarially determined and include an experience 
factor. The aim of the deposit contribution funding 
is to allocate deposit contributions across the TMF with 
reference to benchmark expectations of relative 
claims costs for the agencies in the TMF, and to provide 
a financial incentiveto improve injury and claims 
management outcomes.
icare NSW, in administering the Treasury Managed 
Fund, implemented the Agency Performance Adjustment 
(APA), replacing the workers compensation hindsight 
adjustments. The APA is an opportunity for Health entities 
to influence impacts by proactively managing workers 
compensation performance. An unfavourable result 
$33.6 million was declared in 2022-23.

Asset Management overview
NSW Health is focused on supporting local and statewide 
optimisation, sustainability, and maturity of assets to 
improve patient care outcomes. This includes shifting the 
focus to a whole of lifecycle approach for healthcare 
assets to improve performance and support the Future 
Health strategy, aligned with NSW Health’s Asset 
Management Policy Directive (PD2022_044) and other 
policies and standards. Strategic asset management 
capability has been enhanced to support continuous 
improvement in asset data, system monitoring, 
performance and reporting.
NSW Health continues to consider return on investment 
for asset management strategies through alignment 
with patient and clinical services and risk minimisation. 
Six key focus areas set the strategic direction and drive 
policy development and assurance across its asset 
management portfolio. This includes reducing the risk 
of asset failures; key asset strategies programmed to align 
asset services and patient care outcomes; improving 
workforce capability; evidence-based reporting to enable 
informed and data driven decisions; balancing cost, risk 
and performance to identify opportunities for enhanced 
outcomes; and embedding lifecycle management and 
whole-of-life approach.
Land disposals 
The properties sold in 2022-23 incurred gross proceeds of approximately $13.1 million. This represents a 13.2 per cent 
increase in proceeds from sales compared to 2021-22 ($11.5 million) (Refer to table below).
Proceeds in 2022-23 were impacted by a NSW Government directive to pause all government disposal of property, 
with limited exceptions such as transfer of real property between NSW Government agencies or transactions where 
contracts were exchanged, and final completion was pending.
All sales were undertaken in accordance with government policy. Documents relating to these sales can be obtained 
under the Government Information (Public Access) Act 2009.

INDEPENDENT AUDITOR’S REPORT 
Ministry of Health (the Ministry) and the Consolidated Entity 
To Members of the New South Wales Parliament 
Opinion 
I have audited the accompanying financial statements of the Ministry of Health (the Ministry) and the 
Consolidated Entity, which comprises the Statement by the Accountable Authority, the Statements of 
Comprehensive Income for the year ended 30 June 2023, the Statements of Financial Position as at 
30 June 2023, the Statements of Changes in Equity and the Statements of Cash Flows for the year 
then ended, notes comprising a Statement of Significant Accounting Policies and other explanatory 
information of the Ministry and the Consolidated Entity. The Consolidated Entity comprises the 
Ministry and the entities it controlled at the year’s end or from time to time during the financial year. 
In my opinion, the financial statements: 
•
have been prepared in accordance with Australian Accounting Standards and the applicable
financial reporting requirements of the Government Sector Finance Act 2018 (GSF Act), the
Government Sector Finance Regulation 2018 (GSF Regulation) and the Treasurer's Directions
•
presents fairly the financial position, financial performance and cash flows of the Ministry and
the Consolidated Entity.
My opinion should be read in conjunction with the rest of this report. 
Basis for Opinion 
I conducted my audit in accordance with Australian Auditing Standards. My responsibilities under the 
standards are described in the ‘Auditor’s Responsibilities for the Audit of the Financial Statements’ 
section of my report. 
I am independent of the Ministry and the Consolidated Entity in accordance with the requirements of 
the: 
•
Australian Auditing Standards
•
Accounting Professional and Ethical Standards Board’s APES 110 ‘Code of Ethics for
Professional Accountants (including Independence Standards)’ (APES 110).
Parliament promotes independence by ensuring the Auditor-General and the Audit Office of 
New South Wales are not compromised in their roles by: 
•
providing that only Parliament, and not the executive government, can remove an
Auditor-General
•
mandating the Auditor-General as auditor of public sector agencies
•
precluding the Auditor-General from providing non-audit services.
I have fulfilled my other ethical responsibilities in accordance with APES 110. 
I believe the audit evidence I have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for my 
audit opinion.

Annual Report 2022–23   :  Financial Report   :  page 133


Key Audit Matters 
Key audit matters are those matters that, in my professional judgement, were of most significance in 
my audit of the financial statements for the year ended 30 June 2023. These matters were addressed 
in the context of my audit of the financial statements as a whole, and in forming my opinion thereon. I 
do not provide a separate opinion on these matters. 
Key Audit Matter 
How my audit addressed the matter 
Valuation of property, plant and equipment 
Refer to Note 25 Property, plant and equipment 
At 30 June 2023, the Consolidated Entity reported 
$28.4 billion in infrastructure, property, plant and 
equipment measured at fair value comprised of:  
• 
$26.0 billion - land and buildings  
• 
$1.5 billion - plant and equipment  
• 
$0.9 billion - infrastructure. 
 
I considered this area a key audit matter due to the:  
• 
financial significance, geographical distribution 
and specialised or unique nature of health and 
health infrastructure assets;  
• 
high degree of management judgement required 
in respect of classifying project costs as capital or 
expense; and  
• 
complexities associated with the application of 
AASB 13 Fair Value Measurement being 
dependent on assumptions that require 
significant judgement in areas such as: 
- 
identifying components of buildings and 
determining their current replacement cost  
- 
forecasting remaining useful lives  
- 
application of discount rates  
- 
assessment of the conditions of the assets  
- 
assessment of the financial impact of 
indicators of impairment. 
To address the key audit matter, I:  
• 
assessed the adequacy of management's review 
of the valuation process;  
• 
assessed the competence, capabilities and 
objectivity of management's valuers; 
• 
reviewed the scope and instructions provided to 
the valuers and obtained an understanding of the 
methodology used and its appropriateness with 
reference to relevant Australian Accounting 
Standards and Treasurer’s Directions; 
• 
assessed the appropriateness of the components 
of buildings used for measuring gross 
replacement cost with reference to common 
industry practice; 
• 
tested a sample of costs allocated to work in 
progress to assess the appropriateness of 
capitalisation; 
• 
evaluated whether the useful lives applied to the 
various asset classes were consistent with 
management's planned usage of those assets; 
• 
assessed the reasonableness and 
appropriateness of judgement used by 
management to assess non-financial assets for 
impairment. This included the process employed 
to monitor impairment indicators; and 
• 
assessed the adequacy of the financial statement 
disclosures against the requirements of 
applicable Australian Accounting Standards and 
Treasurer’s Directions. 
Existence and valuation of COVID-19 related inventories (including Rapid Antigen Tests {RATs}) 
Refer to Note 22 Inventories 
At 30 June 2023, the Consolidated Entity reported a 
total net inventory balance of $451.6 million (COVID-
19 related inventories balance was $412.7 million; of 
which, $68.78 million related to RATs).  This was 
comprised of a total gross inventory balance of 
$737.4 million, offset by a total impairment provision 
of $285.8 million (RATs: $251.2 million; General: 
$34.6 million) 
I considered this area a key audit matter due to the 
complexities associated with: 
• 
procurement and distribution processes with the 
Commonwealth; 
• 
obtaining a reliable measurement base for 
vaccines received free of charge; and 
To address the key audit matter, I: 
• 
reviewed and verified the key components of 
management's approach to valuing COVID-19 
inventory lines relevant for the 2022-23 financial 
reporting period; 
• 
obtained an understanding of the systems and 
processes relied upon to manage inventory 
holdings; 
• 
assessed the inputs and logic applied in arriving 
at the 2023 inventory impairment assessment; 
and 
• 
tested a sample of transactions verifying price 
and quantity movements back to supporting 
documentation.

Key Audit Matter 
How my audit addressed the matter 
• 
an evolving environment where responses to the 
COVID-19 pandemic during 2023 were different 
to previous years.  
 
Recognition and measurement of grants and contributions revenue 
Refer to Note 11 Grants and Other Contributions 
Of the $9.1 billion recognised as grants and other 
contributions revenue during the year, over $8 billion 
related to the funding arrangements through the 
National Health Reform Agreement (NHRA) and the 
National Partnership Agreement (NPA) in 2022-23. 
I considered this area a key audit matter due to the: 
• 
significance of the balance relative to the 
Consolidated Entity's Statement of 
Comprehensive Income; 
• 
different types of performance obligations 
attached to each revenue stream; 
• 
continuous funding received over more than one 
financial reporting period; and 
• 
evolving environment where certain funding 
streams and agreements were wound up in 2023. 
 
 
To address the key audit matter, I: 
• 
documented and understood the nature of the 
key revenue streams relating to the NHRA and 
NPA; 
• 
reviewed the terms and conditions contained 
within the key funding agreements entered with 
the Commonwealth; 
• 
assessed the key accounting treatments applied 
to each type of grant funding stream;  
• 
understood and assessed the implications 
resulting from expiration of any agreement; and 
• 
reviewed a sample of transactions to ensure the 
appropriate accounting treatment had been 
applied. 
 
Provision for Parental Leave 
Refer to Note 34 Provisions 
At 30 June 2023, the Consolidated Entity reported a 
$117.5 million provision in relation to enhanced paid 
parental leave entitlements. 
Before 1 October 2022, the parent with primary 
responsibility for the care of their child at the time of 
birth, adoption or surrogacy could take up to 14 
weeks of paid parental leave.  
The other parent could take 2 weeks paid parental 
leave at the time of birth, adoption or surrogacy plus 
up to 12 weeks paid parental leave if they assumed 
primary responsibility for the care of their child during 
that period (and their partner has returned to work or 
study). 
Under the new entitlements, that came into effect for 
eligible NSW Government sector employees who 
have babies born on or after 1 October 2022 
(regardless of the expected date of birth) and have at 
least 40 weeks of continuous service, both parents 
can take up to 14 weeks paid parental leave (and a 
further 2 weeks bonus leave if certain conditions are 
met). This is also now available to employees who 
become parents or guardians to a child under a 
permanent out of home care order. 
I considered this area a key audit matter due to the: 
• 
significance of the balance; and 
• 
complexities regarding inputs used in calculating 
the balance. 
 
To address the key audit matter, I: 
• 
obtained and understood management's process 
supporting the calculation of the balance; 
• 
tested the reasonableness of assumptions 
underlying the provision balance; and 
• 
performed detailed testing on a sample of 
employees included in the provision balance to 
ensure these employees met the eligibility 
criteria.

Secretary’s Responsibilities for the Financial Statements 
The Secretary is responsible for the preparation and fair presentation of the financial statements in 
accordance with Australian Accounting Standards and the GSF Act, GSF Regulation and Treasurer’s 
Directions. The Secretary’s responsibility also includes such internal control as the Secretary 
determines is necessary to enable the preparation and fair presentation of the financial statements 
that are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error. 
In preparing the financial statements, the Secretary is responsible for assessing the ability of the 
Ministry and the Consolidated Entity to continue as a going concern, disclosing as applicable, matters 
related to going concern and using the going concern basis of accounting. 
Auditor’s Responsibilities for the Audit of the Financial Statements 
My objectives are to: 
• 
obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements as a whole are free from 
material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error 
• 
issue an Independent Auditor’s Report including my opinion. 
 
Reasonable assurance is a high level of assurance but does not guarantee an audit conducted in 
accordance with Australian Auditing Standards will always detect material misstatements. 
Misstatements can arise from fraud or error. Misstatements are considered material if, individually or 
in aggregate, they could reasonably be expected to influence the economic decisions users take 
based on the financial statements. 
A description of my responsibilities for the audit of the financial statements is located at the Auditing 
and Assurance Standards Board website at: www.auasb.gov.au/auditors_responsibilities/ar5.pdf. The 
description forms part of my auditor’s report. 
The scope of my audit does not include, nor provide assurance: 
• 
that the Ministry and the Consolidated Entity carried out their activities effectively, efficiently and 
economically 
• 
about the assumptions used in formulating the budget figures disclosed in the financial 
statements 
• 
about the security and controls over the electronic publication of the audited financial 
statements on any website where they may be presented 
• 
about any other information which may have been hyperlinked to/from the financial statements.

Principles of consolidation
The Ministry of Health (the Ministry or Parent) is a NSW government entity and is controlled by the State of New South
Wales, which is the immediate and ultimate parent. The Ministry is a not-for-profit entity (as profit is not its principal
objective) and it has no cash generating units. The Ministry and its controlled entities are consolidated as part of the NSW
Total State Sector Accounts.
The Ministry controls the Local Health Districts established from 1 January 2011, as well as other controlled entities
constituted under the Health Services Act 1997 which include:
The Health Administration Corporation includes the operations of:
The Ministry and its controlled entities are collectively referred to as the consolidated entity.
The consolidated financial statements also include results for the parent entity thereby capturing the central
administrative function of the Ministry.
These consolidated financial statements for the year ended 30 June 2023 have been authorised for issue by the Secretary,
NSW Health on the date the accompanying statement was signed.
The financial statements of the controlled entities are prepared for the same reporting period as the parent entity using
uniform accounting policies for like transactions and other events in similar circumstances. As a result, no adjustments
were required for any dissimilar accounting policies.
The consolidated financial statements comprise the financial statements of the parent entity and its controlled entities,
after elimination of all inter-entity transactions and balances. The controlled entities are consolidated from the date the
parent entity obtained control and until such time as control passes.

●
●
Property, plant and equipment, assets held for sale and certain financial assets and liabilities are measured using the fair
value basis. Other financial statement items are prepared in accordance with the historical cost convention except where
specified otherwise.
Judgements, key assumptions, and estimations management has made are disclosed in the relevant notes to the
consolidated financial statements.
All amounts are rounded to the nearest one thousand dollars (unless otherwise stated) and are expressed in Australian
currency, which is the consolidated and the parent entity's presentation and functional currency.
The consolidated financial statements and notes comply with Australian Accounting Standards which include Australian
Accounting Interpretations.
amount of GST incurred by the consolidated and parent entity as a purchaser that is not recoverable from the
Australian Taxation Office is recognised as part of an asset's cost of acquisition or as part of an item of expense; and
The consolidated financial statements have been prepared on a going concern basis, which assumes it will be able to meet
its obligations as and when they fall due.
The consolidated entity has determined that it is not probable a liability arises to pay superannuation on annual leave
loading. This position has been formed based on current inquiries, other information currently available to management,
and after considering the facts from a decision in the Federal Court of Australia: Finance Sector Union of Australia v
Commonwealth Bank of Australia [2022] FedCFamC2G 409 . That decision confirmed that, in relation to the industrial
agreement considered in that case, annual leave loading did not form part of ordinary time earnings and therefore, did not
require superannuation contributions to be made under superannuation guarantee legislation because the obligation to
pay annual leave loading was not referable to ordinary hours of work or to ordinary rates of pay. Rather, it was paid by
reference to the period of annual leave, and for the purpose of compensating employees for their loss of opportunity to
work additional hours at higher rates during this period.
This position will be re-assessed in future reporting periods as new information comes to light on this matter.
Cash flows are included in the Statement of Cash Flows on a gross basis. However, the GST components of cash flows
arising from investing and financing activities which are recoverable from, or payable to, the Australian Taxation Office are 
classified as operating cash flows.
The consolidated financial statements are general purpose financial statements which have been prepared on an accruals
basis and in accordance with:
applicable Australian Accounting Standards (AAS) (which include Australian Accounting Interpretations);
the requirements of the Government Sector Finance Act 2018 ('GSF Act');  and 
Treasurer's Directions issued under the GSF Act.
receivables and payables are stated with the amount of GST included.
Income, expenses and assets are recognised net of the amount of GST, except that the:

Differences arising on settlement or translation of monetary items are recognised in net result.
Transactions in foreign currencies are recorded using the spot rate at the date the transaction first qualifies for
recognition.
Monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies are translated at the functional currency spot rates of
exchange at the end of the reporting date.
Non-monetary items that are measured in terms of historical cost in a foreign currency are translated using the exchange
rates at the dates of the initial transactions. Non-monetary items measured at fair value in a foreign currency are
translated using the exchange rates at the date when the fair value is determined. The gain or loss arising on translation of
non-monetary items measured at fair value is treated in line with the recognition of the gain or loss on the change in fair
value of the item (i.e. translation differences on items whose fair value gain or loss is recognised in other comprehensive
income or net results are also recognised in other comprehensive income or net results, respectively).
Certain comparative information has been restated as a result of a prior period error (refer to Note 17) or reclassified to
ensure consistency with current year presentation.
Except when an Australian Accounting Standard permits or requires otherwise, comparative information is presented in
respect of the previous period for all amounts reported in the financial statements.
Asset componentisation
During 2023, the consolidated entity conducted a review of the useful lives of its specialised buildings. As part of the
review, new depreciation useful lives were determined for each of the four major specialised building components,
which previously were all depreciated over 40 years. As a result, the consolidated entity has revised the accounting
policy for the useful lives for specialised buildings, effective from 1 July 2022. The new useful lives were determined

Effective for the first time in FY2022-23
Several amendments and interpretations apply for the first time in 2022-23. The consolidated entity has assessed
the new and amended standards and interpretations that are effective for the first time and have determined they
are unlikely to have a material impact on the financial statements of the consolidated entity.
Issued but not yet effective
NSW public sector entities are not permitted to early adopt new Australian Accounting Standards, unless NSW
Treasury determines otherwise. 
The net effect of the change in useful lives on actual and expected depreciation expense (increase / (decrease)),

1 'New/replacement equipment under $10,000' has been restated lower by $10.94 million in the prior period in the consolidated entity
as a result of certain expenses reclassified to 'disability equipment support services' in Note 3.
* This balance consists of employees who have been classified as providing maintenance services for the
consolidated entity and the expense is included in employee related expenses in Note 2.
General expenses of $223.24 million (2022: $257.13 million) includes advertising and marketing, courier and freight,
taxes, rates and related charges, hosted services purchased from local health districts (for parent entity), isolated
patient travel and accommodation assistance and security services.
Pharmaceutical supplies includes $2.54 million (2022: $116.83 million) of COVID-19 vaccinations administered by
vaccination clinics within the consolidated entity. Refer to Note 22 for further details on COVID-19 vaccines.
Specialised health services includes $149.75 million (2022: $489.49 million) of COVID-19 polymerase chain reaction
(PCR) tests and rapid antigen tests provided by private pathology clinics, saliva testing costs and sewerage surveillance
monitoring within the consolidated entity.
Apart from the above-mentioned items, the majority of the costs in relation to food supplies, medical and surgical
supplies and pharmaceutical supplies relate to the consumption of inventory held by the consolidated entity. 
During the current year, the consolidated and parent entity made a 50 per cent contribution of $19.04 million (2022:
$103.58 million) towards providing rapid antigen tests to concession card holders. The contribution was made in
agreement with National Cabinet to support the concession card holders to obtain access to subsidised rapid antigen
tests through pharmacies. The amounts are disclosed under medical and surgical supplies.

Operating expenses includes non-employee costs incurred in delivering the services provided by the consolidated
entity. These expenses are recognised in the reporting period in which they are incurred.
Refer to Note 25 Property, plant and equipment, Note 26 Leases and Note 27 Intangible assets for recognition and
measurement policies on depreciation and amortisation.
Leases of assets that are valued at $10,000 or under when new.
The consolidated entity recognises the lease payments associated with the following types of leases as an expense on
a straight-line basis:
Leases that meet the definition of short-term. i.e. where the lease term at commencement of the lease is 12 months
or less. This excludes leases with a purchase option.
Variable lease payments are not included in the measurement of the lease liability (i.e. variable lease payments that do
not depend on an index or a rate, initially measured using the index or rate as at the commencement date). These
payments are recognised in the period in which the event or condition that triggers those payments occurs.
Depreciation - buildings for the consolidated entity is higher by $27.14 million in 2023 due to a change in the useful
lives of specialised buildings. The parent entity does not hold any specialised buildings. Refer to Note 1(h) for further
details.
Maintenance expense
Day-to-day servicing costs or maintenance are charged as expenses as incurred, except where they relate to the
replacement or enhancement of a part or component of an asset, in which case the costs are capitalised and
depreciated.
The consolidated entity's insurance activities are conducted through the NSW Treasury Managed Fund (TMF) Scheme
of self insurance for Government entities. The expense (premium) is determined by Insurance and Care NSW (icare), an
entity controlled by the ultimate parent, based on past claims experience. The TMF is operated by NSW Self Insurance
Corporation (SiCorp), an entity controlled by the ultimate parent.

Revenue
Recognition and Measurement
Comments regarding the accounting policies for the recognition of income are discussed in Notes 8 to 13.
Income is recognised in accordance with the requirements of AASB 15 Revenue from Contracts with Customers (AASB 
15) or AASB 1058 Income of Not-for-Profit Entities (AASB 1058), dependent on whether there is a contract with a
customer defined by AASB 15.
Finance costs consist of interest and other costs incurred in connection with the borrowing of funds. Finance costs are
recognised as expenses in the period in which they are incurred, in accordance with NSW Treasury's mandate to not-
for-profit NSW General Government Sector entities.
* Of the interest expense from financial liabilities at amortised cost, $0.74 million (2022: $0.78 million) related to
financial liabilities relating to service concession arrangements. Refer to Note 25 for further details on service
concession arrangements.
1 Cost for all bank fees, commercial card charges and debt collection fees were previously classified under 'other interest and charges'
and has now been reclassified to 'operating expenses' (refer to Note 3). The prior period comparatives have been restated in the
consolidated and parent entity with a decrease in 'other interest and charges' by $3.24 million (parent entity: $0.01 million) and an
increase in 'operating expenses' by $3.24 million (parent entity: $0.01 million).

Section 4.11 GSF Act (variations of annual appropriations for Commonwealth

1 Prior period amounts have been restated to align with amendments to sections 4.7 and 4.9 of the Government Sector Finance Act 2018.
The Appropriation Act 2022 (Appropriations Act) appropriates the sum of $18,729.86 million to the Minister for Health
out of the Consolidated Fund for the services of the Ministry of Health for the year 2023. The spending authority of the
Minister from the Appropriations Act has been delegated or subdelegated to officers of the Ministry of Health and
entities that it is administratively responsible for, listed in Note 1 to the financial statements, with separate instruments
of delegation issued to cluster agencies Mental Health Commission of New South Wales and Health Care Complaints
Commission.
The Treasury and Energy Legislation Amendment Act 2022 made some amendments to sections 4.7 and 4.9 of the
Government Sector Finance Act 2018 (the GSF Act). These amendments commenced on 14 November 2022 and are
applied retrospectively. As a result, the lead Minister for each entity above, being the Minister for Health, is taken to
have been given an appropriation out of the Consolidated Fund under the authority of section 4.7 of the GSF Act, at the
time the entity receives or recovers any deemed appropriation money, for an amount equivalent to the money that is
received or recovered by the entity. These deemed appropriations are taken to have been given for the services of the
Ministry of Health.

Appropriations and transfers to The Crown in right of the State of New South Wales (Crown) (continued)
Summary of compliance at a lead minister level (continued)
●
Appropriations are not recognised as income in the following circumstances:
Equity appropriations to fund payments to adjust a for-profit entity’s capital structure are recognised as equity 
injections (i.e. contribution by owners) on receipt and equity withdrawals on payment to a for-profit entity.
Recognition and Measurement
Parliamentary appropriations other than deemed appropriations
The summary of compliance has been prepared on the basis of aggregating the spending authorities of both the
Minister for Health for the services of the Ministry of Health and the lead Ministers for the services of the entities listed
above that receives or recovers deemed appropriation money. It reflects the status at the point in time this disclosure
statement is being made.
The delegation / sub-delegations for 2023 and 2022, authorising officers to spend Consolidated Fund money, impose
limits to the amounts of individual transactions, but do not specify an aggregate expenditure limit for the respective
entities. However, as it relates to expenditure in reliance on a sum appropriated through an annual Appropriations Act , 
the delegation / sub-delegations are referrable to the overall authority to spend set out in the relevant Appropriations 
Act . The individual transaction limits have been properly observed. The information in relation to the limit from the
Appropriations Act is disclosed in the summary of compliance table above.
Income from appropriations, other than deemed appropriations (of which the accounting treatment is based on the
underlying transaction), does not contain enforceable and sufficiently specific performance obligations as defined by
AASB 15. Therefore, except as specified below, appropriations (other than deemed appropriations) are recognised as
income when the entity obtains control over the asset comprising the appropriations. Control over appropriations is
normally obtained upon the receipt of cash.
In addition, government money that a GSF agency receives or recovers, from another GSF agency, of a kind prescribed
by the GSF regulations that forms part of the Consolidated Fund, is now capable of giving rise to deemed
appropriations where the receiving agency has a different lead Minister to the agency making the payment, or one or
both of the agencies is a special office (as defined in section 4.7(8)).
On 16 June 2023, the GSF Amendment (Deemed Appropriations) Regulation 2023 was approved to bring the GSF
regulations in line with the above deemed appropriation amendments to the GSF Act.
The State Budget and related Appropriation Bill for year commencing 1 July 2023 was delayed and only tabled in
September 2023. Pursuant to section 4.10 of the GSF Act, the Treasurer authorised the payment of specified sums out
of the Consolidated Fund to meet the requirements of this period.

The performance obligations in relation to 
patient services are typically satisfied as the 
health services are delivered to the chargeable 
inpatients and non-inpatients. Public patients 
are not charged for health services provided at 
public hospitals. Chargeable patients, 
including Medicare ineligible patients, 
privately insured patients, eligible veterans 
and compensable patients are billed for health 
services provided under various contractual 
arrangements. Billings are typically performed 
upon patient discharge and are based on the 
rates specified by the Ministry of Health. The 
payments are typically due within 30 days 
after the invoice date.
Revenue is recognised on an accrual 
basis when the service has been provided 
to the patient. In limited circumstances 
the price is not fully recovered, e.g. due 
to inadequate insurance policies, 
overseas patients returning to their home 
country before paying, etc. The likelihood 
of occurrences is considered on a case by

Interest income from financial assets at amortised

Net gain / (loss) from TCorpIM Funds measured at fair 
value through profit or loss
Dividend income is recognised when the consolidated entity's right to receive the payment has been established.
Royalties are usually recognised when the underlying performance obligation is satisfied. It is recognised at the
estimated amount if the consideration is variable.
Interest revenue is calculated by applying the effective interest rate to the gross carrying amount of a financial asset
except for financial assets that subsequently become credit impaired. For financial assets that become credit impaired,
the effective interest rate is applied to the amortised cost of the financial asset (i.e. after deducting the loss allowance
for expected credit losses).

Commonwealth government funded grant under the National Partnership Agreement for Priority Groups COVID-19
Testing and Vaccination to deliver testing and vaccination programs to protect priority populations groups from
COVID-19;
Income from grants to acquire / construct a recognisable non-financial asset to be controlled by the consolidated entity
is recognised when the consolidated entity satisfies its obligations under the transfer. The consolidated entity satisfies
the performance obligation under the transfer over time as the non-financial assets are being constructed. The
percentage of cost incurred is used to recognise income, because this most closely reflects the progress to completion.
Revenue from grants with sufficiently specific performance obligations are recognised when the consolidated entity
satisfies a performance obligation by transferring the promised goods or services. 
Grants and other contributions
Commonwealth government grants - other in the consolidated entity includes $73.12 million of COVID-19 and Japanese
encephalitis pharmaceutical supplies received from the Commonwealth (2022: $93.98 million of personal protective
equipment, rapid antigen testing kits and COVID-19 pharmaceutical supplies received from the Commonwealth) for nil
consideration and recorded at current replacement cost at the time of receipt.
The consolidated entity received the majority of COVID-19 vaccines directly from the Commonwealth government and
the remainder were received from external third parties. The total value of COVID-19 vaccines recognised was $2.01
million (2022: $129.71 million) under Commonwealth Government COVID-19 vaccines and $0.13 million (2022: $0.32
million) from external third parties under other grants. All COVID-19 vaccines were received for nil consideration and
recorded at current replacement cost at the time of receipt. Refer to Note 22 for further details on COVID-19 vaccines.
The consolidated entity typically receives grants in respect of:
Commonwealth government funded grant under the National Health Reform Agreement to improve the state's
health outcomes and ensure sustainability of the health system;
Commonwealth government funded grant under the National Partnership Agreement on COVID-19 Response which
provides stability and certainty of funding while responding to the COVID-19 pandemic;
Other various grants in respect of research, clinical drug trials and other community, health and wellbeing related
projects.
Commonwealth government funded vaccinations, including COVID-19 vaccinations which are provided free of
charge to the community. Refer to Note 22 for further details; and
Commonwealth National Health Reform - consists of Activity Based Funding, Public Health Funding and Block
Funding. Activity Based Funding is recognised under AASB 15 Revenue from Contracts with Customers (AASB 15),
while Public Health and Block Funding is recognised under AASB 1058 Income of Not-for-Profit Entities (AASB
1058) due to lack of specific performance obligations. Revenue for Activity Based Funding is recognised when the
hospital activities are performed. The revenue is calculated by the activity multiplied by the agreed National
Weighted Activity Unit price. The Commonwealth undertakes an annual reconciliation of reported activity (revenue)
against funding payments made for that year. Any differences arising from the reported activity (revenue) in
previous years, is adjusted in the current year annual reconciliation.
The consolidated entity uses various methods to recognise revenue over time, depending on the nature and terms and
conditions of the grant contract. The payments are typically based on an agreed timetable or on achievement of
different milestones set up in the contract. Revenue is recognised as follows:

(commenced on 1 January 2023) - consists of two financial arrangements:
PCR Testing Payment - The Commonwealth shares the funding equally (pays for 50 per cent of costs) with the state
government for costs incurred by states and territories for PCR testing for COVID-19. Revenue is recognised when
the actual testing cost is incurred as a PCR testing payment. 
Vaccination Dose Delivery Payment - The Commonwealth government provides states and territories a 50 per cent
contribution to the agreed price per COVID-19 vaccine dose delivered. Revenue is recognised when the vaccine
doses are delivered as a vaccination dose delivery payment. 
Schedule D - The Commonwealth provided 100 per cent of the funding to support aged care preparedness and
response during COVID-19. This funding was targeted to ensure prevention, preparedness and response activities
were in place to address outbreaks of COVID-19 in residential aged care facilities and to provide additional targeted
training. Revenue was recognised when the actual costs were incurred as a state public health payment.
Other grants and contributions - consist of various types of grants and contributions received. The performance
obligations are typically satisfied when the specified activities / milestones agreed in the grant contract are
completed/met. Where there are no specific performance obligations, revenue is recognised on receipt of funding
under AASB 1058. The payments are typically made in advance or based on an agreed timetable.
Grants and other contributions (continued)
Schedule C - The Commonwealth government provided states and territories two payments for COVID-19
vaccinations, a fixed upfront payment to ensure funds were available to setup up state-run vaccination clinics
regardless of the amount of vaccination activity delivered and a vaccination dose delivery payment of a 50 per cent
contribution to the agreed price per vaccination dose delivered. Revenue was recognised when actual vaccines are
delivered except for the fixed upfront vaccination payment which was recognised under AASB 1058 due to lack of
specific performance obligations.
Schedule A - The Commonwealth shared the funding equally (paid for 50 per cent of costs) with the state
government for hospitals and state public health authorities to assess, diagnose, treat and contain COVID-19.
Revenue was recognised when the actual costs were incurred as either a hospital services payment or a state
public health payment depending on the related activities.
Schedule B - The Commonwealth shared the funding equally (paid for 50 per cent of costs) with the state
government to purchase private hospital service activities as needed and the Commonwealth provided 100 per cent
of the funding for viability payments to identified private hospitals to ensure the state had access to private
hospital beds, staffing and resources to support their ongoing response to the pandemic. Revenue was recognised
when the actual costs were incurred for services purchased from private hospitals as a hospital service payment
and viability payments as a state public health payment. 
Commonwealth National Partnership Agreement on COVID-19 Response (ended 31 December 2022) - consisted of
four financial arrangements:

Receipt of these services, while important, is not recognised because typically such services would not have been
purchased if not donated.
- Health Education
Receipt of volunteer services is recognised when and only when the fair value of those services can be reliably
determined and the services would have been purchased if not donated. The consolidated entity receives volunteer
services for the below activities:
Revenue from these grants is recognised based on the grant amount specified in the funding agreement / funding
approval, and revenue is only recognised to the extent that it is highly probable that a significant reversal will not occur.
No element of financing is deemed present as funding payments are usually received in advance or shortly after the
relevant obligation is satisfied.
Income from grants without sufficiently specific performance obligations is recognised when the consolidated entity
obtains control over the granted assets (e.g. cash).

Other income
Other income arises from varying arrangements. Income is generally recognised on an accrual basis and / or when the
right to receive the income has been established in accordance with the substance of the relevant agreement.
Rental income is accounted for on a straight-line basis over the lease term. The rental income is incidental to the
purpose for holding the property.
Revenue reflects the progressive unwinding of the 'grant of right to operate liability' (Note 35) over the remaining
period of the arrangement. Refer to Note 25 for further details on service concession arrangements.
Insurance activities are conducted through the NSW Treasury Managed Fund (TMF) Scheme of self insurance for
Government entities. Insurance refunds are recognised when TMF accepts the insurance claim.
Significant fluctuations in the actuarial factors for the long service leave provision in 2022 resulted in negative
movements in the consolidated and parent entity for the year ended 30 June 2022.
The following liabilities and / or expenses have been assumed by the Crown or other government entities:
¹ 'Long service leave provision' has been restated to be lower by $16.81 million in the prior year for the consolidated entity. Refer to Note 17

Prior period error
Correction of permanent part time long service leave 
During the year it was identified that the long service leave entitlement for certain employees has not been correctly
calculated and recognised. The issue only impacted employees who have had a period of part time service under the
Health Employees' Conditions of Employment Award during their employment duration. It was identified that the
accrual for enhanced entitlement did not start on the completion of first 10 years of service by the employee, rather it
was delayed in some instances and only started upon the completion of full-time equivalency of 10 years of service.
This has resulted in an under accrual and / or underpayment of long service leave entitlements for such employees in
the current and prior years. The error has been corrected during the year, with retrospective adjustments made in the
prior periods.
The consolidated entity's liability for long service leave are assumed by The Crown in right of the State of New South
Wales. The consolidated entity accounts for the liability as having been extinguished, resulting in the amount
assumed being shown as part of the non-monetary revenue item described as 'Acceptance by the Crown of employee
benefits'. Specific on-costs relating to long service leave assumed by The Crown in right of the State of New South
Wales are borne by the consolidated entity.
The impact to the consolidated entity's Statement of Comprehensive Income and Statement of Financial Position from
restating the balances in the prior year due to above matter are shown below. There was no impact on the parent
entity as all employees of the parent entity are on a separate award to the impacted employees.

Recognition and Measurement
●
●
Subsequent measurement
Impairment
For trade receivables, the consolidated entity applies a simplified approach in calculating ECLs. The consolidated entity
recognises a loss allowance based on lifetime ECLs at each reporting date. The consolidated entity has established a
provision matrix based on its historical credit loss experience for trade receivables, adjusted for forward looking factors
specific to the receivable.
The consolidated entity recognises an allowance for expected credit losses (ECLs) for all debt financial assets not held
at fair value through profit or loss. ECLs are based on the difference between the contractual cash flows and the cash
flows that the consolidated entity expects to receive, discounted at the original effective interest rate.
The consolidated entity holds receivables with the objective to collect the contractual cash flows and therefore
measures them at amortised cost using the effective interest method, less any impairment. Changes are recognised in
the net result for the year when impaired, derecognised or through the amortisation process.
Receivables are initially recognised at fair value plus any directly attributable transaction costs. Trade receivables that
do not contain a significant financing component are measured at the transaction price.
All 'regular way' purchases or sales of financial assets are recognised and derecognised on a trade date basis. Regular
way purchases or sales are purchases or sales of financial assets that require delivery of assets within the time frame
established by regulation or convention in the marketplace.
The consolidated entity recognises a financial asset or a financial liability when, and only when, it becomes a party to
the contractual provisions of the instrument. To determine when the agency becomes a party to the contractual
provisions of the instrument, the consolidated entity considers:
Whether the consolidated entity has a legal right to receive cash (financial asset) or a legal obligation to pay cash
(financial liability); or
Whether at least one of the parties has performed under the agreement.

Contract assets relate to the consolidated entity's right to consideration in exchange for goods and services
transferred to customers / works completed, but not billed at the reporting date. The contract assets are transferred to
receivables when the rights become unconditional. This usually occurs when the consolidated entity issues an invoice
to the customer. The balance of the contract assets relates to grants and other contributions for work completed but
not yet invoiced as future work is required to be completed before the consolidated entity has the rights to invoice.
Once all performance obligations are met and the consolidated entity has rights to invoice for the payment to be made,
the contract asset is transferred to receivables.
The contract asset balance has increased in the consolidated and parent entity during the year due to the varying
billing arrangements from contracts existing at different reporting dates.
¹ Prior year figures in the parent entity have been restated higher by $0.12 million as a result of items previously excluded under contract
receivables.

Material inventories are held for distribution (consumed in the ordinary activities of the consolidated entity). Inventories
held for distribution are stated at cost, adjusted when applicable, for any loss of service potential. A loss of service
potential is identified and measured based on the existence of a current replacement cost that is lower than the
carrying amount or any loss of operating capacity due to obsolescence. Costs are assigned to individual items of stock
mainly on the basis of weighted average costs.
Recognition and Measurement
The majority of the inventory held-for-distribution is held for consumption in the ordinary activities of the consolidated
entity and upon consumption, are expensed in food supplies, medical and surgical supplies and pharmaceutical
supplies (Note 3).
Inventories (other than those held for distribution) are stated at the lower of cost and net realisable value. Cost is
calculated using the weighted average cost method.
In 2022, medical and surgical supplies inventory held-for-resale consisted of items the consolidated entity had agreed
to resell to the Commonwealth for inclusion in the national medical stockpile. 
In 2023, the consolidated entity wrote off $125.86 million of medical and surgical supplies. Following the write-off, the
allowance for impairment of medical and surgical supplies was reassessed and an additional impairment of $39.09
million was recognised due to the changes in the current consumption forecast model of medical and surgical supplies.
The write-off and additional allowance for impairment expensed under other gains / (losses) (Note 15) is $164.96
million.
In 2022, the consolidated entity held an allowance for impairment of medical and surgical supplies of $246.70 million.
The allowance for impairment was based on a consumption forecast model, on medical and surgical supply categories
that are likely to expire before they are consumed or are in an unserviceable condition (does not meet the clinical
requirements) and have no alternative use before they expire.

22. Inventories (continued)
In addition, the consolidated entity wrote-off $0.09 million (2022: $Nil) of monkeypox vaccinations as a result of
vaccinations being damaged or expired.
At the beginning of 2021, the rollout of the Commonwealth's COVID-19 vaccine program commenced, with the aim of
providing free vaccines to all Australians. The consolidated entity played a key role in the rollout within NSW, including
in relation to logistics, vaccination delivery, safety and reporting. The Commonwealth assumed the responsibility for
procuring and distributing vaccines to all states and territories. The consolidated entity received COVID-19 vaccines for
nil consideration and provided to the public free of charge. On the basis that the consolidated entity controls the
inventory once it is received from the Commonwealth, the value of the inventory received, distributed and wasted were
recognised by the consolidated entity. 
The value attributable to each COVID-19 vaccine received was its fair value based on replacement cost. The
consolidated entity was unsuccessful in obtaining cost information from the Commonwealth because of non-disclosure
agreements signed by the Commonwealth and the pharmaceutical companies supplying the COVID-19 vaccines. An
internal valuation was undertaken based on publicly available information to estimate the replacement cost of the
COVID-19 vaccines received by the consolidated entity.
Recognition and Measurement (continued)
Obsolete items are disposed of in accordance with instructions issued by the Ministry. 
The cost of inventories acquired at no cost or for nominal consideration is the current replacement cost as at the date of
acquisition. Current replacement cost is the cost the consolidated entity would incur to acquire the asset. Net realisable
value is the estimated selling price in the ordinary course of business less the estimated costs of completion and the
estimated costs necessary to make the sale.
The value of the COVID-19 vaccines received, administered and granted during the financial year ended 30 June 2023
was $2.14 million (2022: $130.02 million), $2.54 million (2022: $116.83 million) and $0.13 million (2022: $0.39 million),
respectively. $11.74 million (2022: $5.36 million) of COVID-19 vaccines were written-off and $11.31 million decrease in
the allowance for impairment (2022: increase in the allowance for impairment of $11.31 million). COVID-19 vaccine
closing inventory balance as at 30 June 2023 was $0.15 million (2022: $12.42 million) which is included as part of drug
supplies.

The consolidated entity has elected not to apply hedge accounting to the economic hedges.
Derivative contracts are carried as financial assets when their fair value at the reporting date is positive. Derivative
contracts maturing less than 12 months are classified as current and all other contracts as non-current. 
Refer to Note 44 for further information regarding fair value measurement, credit risk, and market risk arising from
financial instruments.
The consolidated entity recognises a financial asset or a financial liability when, and only when, it becomes a party to
the contractual provisions of the instrument. To determine when the agency becomes a party to the contractual
provisions of the instrument, the consolidated entity considers:
Whether the consolidated entity has a legal right to receive cash (financial asset) or a legal obligation to pay cash
(financial liability); or
Whether at least one of the parties has performed under the agreement.
Financial assets at fair value through profit or loss include financial assets designated upon initial recognition at fair
value through profit or loss, or financial assets mandatorily required to be measured at fair value under AASB 9
Financial Instruments (AASB 9).
Financial assets are held for trading if acquired for the purpose of selling or repurchasing in the near term. Derivatives
are economic hedges classified as fair value through profit or loss unless they are designated as effective hedging
instruments.
Classification and measurement
Recognition and Measurement
Financial assets at fair value through profit or loss
All 'regular way' purchases or sales of financial assets are recognised and derecognised on a trade date basis. Regular
way purchases or sales are purchases or sales of financial assets that require delivery of assets within the time frame
established by regulation or convention in the marketplace.
The consolidated entity's financial assets at fair value are classified, at initial recognition, at fair value through profit or
loss.
Transaction costs of financial assets carried at fair value through profit or loss are expensed in net results.

Recognition and Measurement (continued)
A gain or loss on a financial asset that is subsequently measured at fair value through profit or loss is recognised in net
results and presented net within other gains / (losses), except for TCorpIM Funds that are presented in 'investment
revenue' in the period in which it arises.
Recognition and Measurement
All 'regular way' purchases or sales of other financial assets are recognised and derecognised on a trade date basis.
Regular way purchases or sales are purchases or sales of other financial assets that require delivery of assets within
the time frame established by regulation or convention in the marketplace.
Refer to Note 44 for further information regarding fair value measurement, credit risk, and market risk arising from
financial instruments.
Other financial assets are initially measured at fair value plus any transaction costs.
The current intra health loans receivable balance within the parent entity includes $203.04 million (2022: $495.80
million) of cash advances provided to HealthShare NSW to make all payments to employees and most payments to
suppliers of goods and services and grants and subsidies on behalf of the controlled entities.
Financial assets with cash flows that are not solely payments of principal and interest are classified and measured at
fair value through profit or loss, irrespective of the business model. TCorpIM Funds are managed and their performance
is evaluated on a fair value basis and therefore the business model is neither to hold to collect contractual cash flows or
sell the financial asset. Hence these investments are mandatorily required to be measured at fair value through profit or
loss.
Notwithstanding the criteria to be classified at amortised cost or at fair value through other comprehensive income,
financial assets may be designated at fair value through profit or loss on initial recognition if doing so eliminates, or
significantly reduces, an accounting mismatch.

24. Other financial assets (continued)
The consolidated entity's term deposits are issued by financial institutions that have strong credit ratings and are
therefore considered to be low credit risk investments. Hence the consolidated entity measures the loss allowance for
term deposits at an amount equal to a 12-month ECL. However, when there is a significant increase in credit risk since
origination, the allowance will be based on the lifetime ECL.
The consolidated entity uses the ratings from external credit rating agencies both to determine whether there has been
a significant increase in credit risk on the deposits and to estimate ECLs. These estimates are performed at every
reporting date.
Impairment
Other financial assets are classified and subsequently measured at amortised cost as they are held for collection of
contractual cash flows solely representing payments of principal and interest. Impairment losses are presented as a
separate line item in the Statement of Comprehensive Income. Any gain or loss arising on derecognition is recognised
directly in net results and presented in other gains / (losses) together with foreign exchange gains and losses.
Financial assets at amortised cost
For lease receivables, the entity applies the simplified approach permitted by AASB 9 Financial Instruments, where the
loss allowance is based on lifetime ECLs.
Recognition and Measurement (continued)
The consolidated entity recognises an allowance for expected credit losses (ECLs) for all debt financial assets not held
at fair value through profit or loss. ECLs are based on the difference between the contractual cash flows and the cash
flows that the consolidated entity expects to receive, discounted at the original effective interest rate.
ECLs are recognised in two stages. For credit exposures where there has not been a significant increase in credit risk
since initial recognition, ECLs are based on default events possible within the next 12-months (i.e. a 12-month ECL). If
there has been a significant increase in credit risk since initial recognition, a loss allowance is required for credit losses
expected over the remaining life of the exposure, irrespective of the timing of the default (i.e. a lifetime ECL). In
addition, the consolidated entity considers that there has been a significant increase in credit risk when contractual
payments are more than 30 days past due.

Ministry of Health
Notes to and forming part of the Financial Statements
for the year ended 30 June 2023
25. Property, plant and equipment (continued)
Assets acquired at no cost, or for nominal consideration, are initially recognised at their fair value at the date of
acquisition (see also assets transferred as a result of an equity transfer in Note 36).
Recognition and Measurement
Acquisition of property, plant and equipment
Property, plant and equipment acquired are initially recognised at cost and subsequently revalued at fair value less
accumulated depreciation and impairment. Cost is the amount of cash or cash equivalents paid or the fair value of the
other consideration given to acquire the asset at the time of its acquisition or construction or, where applicable, the
amount attributed to that asset when initially recognised in accordance with the requirements of other Australian
Accounting Standards.
Major inspection costs
Land and buildings which are owned by the Health Administration Corporation or the State and operated by the parent
or its controlled entities are deemed to be controlled by the parent and its controlled entities and are recognised as
such in the financial statements.
Capitalisation thresholds
Property, plant and equipment and intangible assets costing $10,000 and above individually (or forming part of a
network costing more than $10,000) are capitalised.
Fair value is the price that would be received to sell an asset in an orderly transaction between market participants at
measurement date.
Where payment for an asset is deferred beyond normal credit terms, its cost is the cash price equivalent, i.e. the
deferred payment amount is effectively discounted over the period of credit.
When a major inspection is performed, its cost is recognised in the carrying amount of the plant and equipment as a
replacement if the recognition criteria are satisfied.
Restoration costs
The present value of the expected cost for the restoration or cost of dismantling of an asset after its use is included in
the cost of the respective asset if the recognition criteria for a provision are met. 
Depreciation of property, plant and equipment
Except for certain non-depreciable assets, depreciation is provided for on a straight-line basis so as to write off the
depreciable amount of each asset as it is consumed over its useful life to the consolidated entity.
All material identifiable components of assets are depreciated separately over their useful lives. 
Land is not a depreciable asset. Certain heritage assets including original artworks and collections and heritage
buildings may not have a limited useful life because appropriate curatorial and preservation policies are adopted. Such
assets are not subject to depreciation. The decision not to recognise depreciation for these assets is reviewed annually.

Buildings - leasehold improvements
Depreciation of property, plant and equipment (continued)
Plant and equipment comprises, among others, medical, computer and office equipment, motor vehicles, furniture and
fittings and PODS (a detachable or self - contained unit on ambulances used for patient treatment).
Infrastructure systems                                                                                     
Further information on leases is contained at Note 26.
Based on the consolidated entity's assessment, the following arrangements fall in scope of AASB 1059:
Service concession assets
Service concession arrangements (SCAs) are contracts between a grantor and an operator where an operator provides
public services related to a service concession asset on behalf of a public sector grantor for a specified period of time
and manages at least some of those services.
AASB 1059 Service Concession Arrangements (AASB 1059) requires the grantor to recognise the service concession
asset when the grantor obtains control of the asset and measures the service concession asset at current replacement
cost. At the same time the grantor recognises a corresponding financial liability or unearned revenue liability or a
combination of both.
This note provides disclosures required under AASB 1059 and relates to the consolidated entity's service concession
arrangements in place.
Infrastructure systems comprises public facilities which provide essential services and enhance the productive capacity 
of the economy including roads, bridges, water infrastructure and distribution works, sewerage treatment plants,
seawalls and water reticulation systems. 
The estimated useful lives, residual values and depreciation methods are reviewed at the end of each reporting period
and adjusted if appropriate.
Right-of-Use Assets acquired by lessees
From 1 July 2019, AASB 16 Leases (AASB 16) requires a lessee to recognise a right-of-use asset for most leases. The
consolidated entity has elected to present right-of-use assets separately in the Statement of Financial Position.

Description
The consolidated entity is obligated to provide both operators access to the
hospital and the carpark. The operators are responsible for the delivery of health
services to public patients at the hospital which the consolidated entity is obligated
to pay for under the annual service agreements. At the end of the arrangement, the
operators are obligated to return all assets back to the consolidated entity. For
Northern Beaches Hospital, the consolidated entity will be sharing a portion of the
hospital facilities with the private operator for an additional term of 20 years after
the expiry of the concession period. The consolidated entity is required to issue a
notice outlining what shared services will be provided by different parties. The
consolidated entity has the right to extend the Northern Beaches Hospital
arrangement for up to five years, by way of giving three years notice to the
operator. For Hawkesbury Hospital, an extension of 18 months was negotiated with
the Operator in 2022. The extension allows both parties to define and agree on the
principles of a new service agreement, which will replace the existing service
agreement.
The consolidated entity has contracted HealthScope (Operator for Northern
Beaches Hospital) and St John of God Health Care (Operator for Hawkesbury
Hospital) to build, operate and manage the hospitals and the car park for the
duration of the arrangement. The construction of both hospitals was funded by the
consolidated entity. Northern Beaches Hospital was paid upfront on completion of
the construction works, while Hawkesbury Hospital was paid over time under a
financing
arrangement
with
the
Operator.
There
are
no
remaining
future
construction payments. The Operator has fully funded the Northern Beaches car
park, and the consolidated entity has granted rights to the Operator to operate and
generate revenue from that car park. Annual service level agreements are entered
into for the delivery of public health services at both hospitals with the Operator,
which is funded by the consolidated entity, paid on a monthly basis. 
Northern Beaches Hospital and Hawkesbury Hospital are two public hospitals built
under two separate Public Private Partnership (PPP) arrangements that are now
treated as part of service concession arrangements. 
Nil
An extension of 18 months was agreed for the Hawkesbury Hospital arrangement
with the Operator. The change has no impact on the current accounting of this
arrangement.

Consist of three arrangements:
The consolidated entity has contracted Infrashore (Operator) to build RNSH P2 car
park and manage both RNSH P1 and P2 car parks for the duration of the
arrangement. The construction of the RNSH P2 car park is funded by the
consolidated entity, paid in instalments under a financing arrangement for the
duration of the term. RNSH P1 car park was an existing carpark of the consolidated
entity. The other two car parks (Prince of Wales hospital car park and St George
hospital car park) were funded by the International Parking Group (Operator) which
was contracted by the consolidated entity to build, manage and operate both car
parks for the duration of the arrangement. For all these car parks, the consolidated
entity has granted rights to the Operator to operate and generate revenue from the
car parks. Upon grant of this right, the Operator has paid an upfront license fee to
the consolidated entity.
The consolidated entity is obliged to provide the operators with access to the
carparks and obligated to pay for the construction of the RNSH P2 car park under

Recognition and Measurement (continued)
Property, plant and equipment is measured at the highest and best use by market participants that is physically
possible, legally permissible and financially feasible. The highest and best use must be available at a period that is not
remote and takes into account the characteristics of the asset being measured, including any socio-political restrictions
imposed by government. In most cases, after taking into account these considerations, the highest and best use is the
existing use. In limited circumstances, the highest and best use may be a feasible alternative use, where there are no
restrictions on use or where there is a feasible higher restricted alternative use.
Fair value of property, plant and equipment is based on a market participant's perspective, using valuation techniques
(market approach, cost approach, income approach) that maximise relevant observable inputs and minimise
unobservable inputs. Also refer to Note 29 for further information regarding fair value.
reference to fair value reverts from the mandated current replacement cost under AASB 1059 to the
appropriate approach under AASB 13; and
the asset is only derecognised when the entity loses control of the asset in accordance with AASB 116.
Revaluations of property, plant and equipment
Physical non-current assets are valued in accordance with the 'Valuation of Physical Non-Current Assets at Fair Value'
Policy and Guidelines Paper (TPP 21-09) and Treasurer's Direction, 'Valuation of Physical Non-Current Assets at Fair
Value' (TD 21-05). TD 21-05 and TPP 21-09 adopt fair value in accordance with AASB 13 Fair Value Measurement and 
AASB 116 Property, Plant and Equipment. 
the consolidated entity accounts for the asset in accordance with other AAS, with the entity reclassifying the
asset based on its nature or function;
Initial recognition
For arrangements within the scope of AASB 1059, the entity recognises a service concession asset when it
controls the asset. Where the asset is provided by the operator, or is an upgrade to or a major component
replacement of an existing asset of the entity, the asset is recognised at current replacement cost based on AASB
13 Fair Value Measurement  (AASB 13) principles.
Service concession assets (continued)
Where the asset is an existing asset of the entity, the asset is reclassified as a service concession asset and
remeasured at current replacement cost at the date of reclassification. Any difference between the previous
carrying amount and current replacement cost is recognised as if it is a revaluation of the asset.
Subsequent to initial recognition
Subsequent to the initial recognition or reclassification, the service concession asset is measured at current
replacement cost and accounted for in accordance with the depreciation and impairment requirements of AASB
116 Property, Plant and Equipment (AASB 116) and AASB 136 Impairment of Assets (AASB 136).
At the end of the arrangement

25. Property, plant and equipment (continued)
Revaluation increments are recognised in other comprehensive income and credited to revaluation surplus in equity.
However, to the extent that an increment reverses a revaluation decrement in respect of the same class of asset
previously recognised as a loss in the net result, the increment is recognised immediately as a gain in the net result.
When revaluing non-current assets using the cost approach, the gross amount and the related accumulated
depreciation are separately restated. Where the income approach or market approach is used, accumulated
depreciation is eliminated against the gross carrying amount of the asset and the net amount restated to the revalued
amount of the asset.
Where an asset that has previously been revalued is disposed of, any balance remaining in the revaluation surplus in
respect of that asset is transferred to accumulated funds.
As a not-for-profit entity, revaluation increments and decrements are offset against one another within a class of non-
current assets, but not otherwise.
Revaluation decrements are recognised immediately as a loss in the net result, except to the extent that it offsets an
existing revaluation surplus on the same class of assets, in which case, the decrement is debited directly to the
revaluation surplus.
For other assets valued using other valuation techniques, any balances of accumulated depreciation at the revaluation
date in respect of those assets are credited to the asset accounts to which they relate. The net asset accounts are then
increased or decreased by the revaluation increments or decrements.
Revaluations are made with sufficient regularity to ensure the carrying amount of each asset in the class does not differ
materially from its fair value at reporting date. The consolidated entity conducts a comprehensive revaluation at least
every three years on a rotational basis for its land and buildings and infrastructure. Interim desktop revaluations are
conducted between comprehensive revaluations for those assets, where cumulative changes to indicators suggest fair
value may differ materially from carrying value. The consolidated entity uses an independent professionally qualified
valuer for such revaluations.
Recognition and Measurement (continued)
Revaluations of property, plant and equipment (continued)
The last comprehensive revaluation for the parent entity was completed on 31 December 2021 and was based on an
independent assessment.
Comprehensive revaluations are conducted in December for the controlled entities on a rolling basis and are based on
an independent assessment. A schedule of revaluations has been developed which rolls over every three years. Interim
or out of schedule revaluations are conducted where cumulative changes to indicators suggest fair value may differ
materially from the carrying value. 
Indices obtained from external professionally qualified valuers in 2023 indicated a material cumulative increase in
market prices for land and a material increase in construction and labour costs for building and infrastructure from the
last comprehensive revaluation. Management has applied these indices to perform an interim revaluation and has
recognised the resulting revaluation increment for land, building and infrastructure. A similar assessment was
performed in 2022 resulting in a revaluation increment recognised for land, building and infrastructure.
Non-specialised assets with short useful lives are measured at depreciated historical cost, as an approximation of fair
value. The consolidated entity has assessed that any difference between fair value and depreciated historical cost is
unlikely to be material.

25. Property, plant and equipment (continued)
The consolidated entity assesses, at each reporting date, whether there is an indication that an asset may be impaired.
If any indication exists, or when annual impairment testing for an asset is required, the consolidated entity estimates
the asset's recoverable amount. When the carrying amount of an asset exceeds its recoverable amount, the asset is
considered impaired and is written down to its recoverable amount.
Specialised assets held for continuing use of their service capacity are rarely sold and their cost of disposal is typically
negligible. Their recoverable amount is expected to be materially the same as fair value, where they are regularly
revalued under AASB 13.
Impairment of property, plant and equipment
Revaluations of property, plant and equipment (continued)
Property, plant and equipment is derecognised upon disposal or when no further future economic benefits are expected
from its use or disposal. Gains and losses on disposals are determined by comparing the proceeds with the carrying
amount of the asset and are included in the consolidated Statement of Comprehensive Income.
Recognition and Measurement (continued)
As a not-for-profit entity, an impairment loss is recognised in the net result to the extent the impairment loss exceeds
the amount in the revaluation surplus for the class of asset.
After an impairment loss has been recognised, it is reversed only if there has been a change in the assumptions used to
determine the asset's recoverable amount. The reversal is limited so that the carrying amount of the asset does not
exceed its recoverable amount, nor exceed the carrying amount that would have been determined, net of depreciation,
had no impairment loss been recognised for the asset in prior years. The reversal is recognised in other comprehensive
income and is treated as a revaluation increase, except to the extent that an impairment loss on the same class of asset
was previously recognised in net result, where a reversal of that impairment loss is also recognised in net result.
Derecognition of property, plant and equipment
As a not-for-profit entity with no cash generating units, impairment under AASB 136 Impairment of Assets is unlikely to
arise. As property, plant and equipment is carried at fair value or an amount that approximates fair value, impairment
can only arise in the rare circumstances such as where the costs of disposal are material.  
The residual values, useful lives and methods of depreciation of property, plant and equipment are reviewed at each
financial year end and adjusted if appropriate.

26. Leases
(a)
Entity as a lessee
During the financial year ended 30 June 2022, the consolidated and parent entity derecognised all leases with Property 
NSW (PNSW), an entity of the ultimate parent. A new 'substitution right' clause was added to the lease arrangements
with PNSW, providing PNSW with a substantive substitution right to relocate the consolidated and parent entity during
the term of the agreement. As a result of this new clause, those agreements were no longer accounted for as a lease
within the scope of AASB 16.
The corresponding right of use assets and lease liabilities have been derecognised on 30 June 2022, the effective date
of the new clause. The net impact of the derecognition is recognised in 'Gains / (Losses) on disposal' (refer to Note 14).
From 1 July 2022, the associated accommodation and warehouse charges are recognised as 'occupancy agreement
expenses - Property NSW' (refer to Note 3) when incurred over the agreement duration.
The consolidated entity leases various property, equipment and motor vehicles. Lease contracts are typically made for
fixed periods of 1 to 40 years (parent entity: 1 to 4 years), but may have extension options. Lease terms are negotiated
on an individual basis and contain a wide range of different terms and conditions. The lease agreements do not impose
any covenants but leased assets may not be used as security for borrowing purposes. The consolidated entity does not
provide residual value guarantees in relation to leases.
Extension and termination options are included in a number of property and equipment leases. These terms are used to
maximise operational flexibility in terms of managing contracts. The majority of extension and termination options held
are exercisable only by the consolidated entity and not by the respective lessor. In determining the lease term,
management considers all facts and circumstances that create an economic incentive to exercise an extension option,
or not exercise a termination option. Extension options (or periods after termination options) are only included in the
lease term if the lease is reasonably certain to be extended (or not terminated). Potential future cash outflows of
$264.39 million (2022: $278.20 million) (parent entity: $Nil, 2022: $Nil)) have not been included in the lease liability
because it is not reasonably certain that the leases will be extended (or not terminated). The assessment is reviewed if
a significant event or a significant change in circumstances occurs which affects this assessment and that is within the
control of the lessee. During the current financial year, the financial effect of revising lease terms to reflect the effect
of exercising extensions and termination options was an increase in recognised lease liabilities and right-of-use assets
of $7.51 million (2022: $0.18 million) (parent entity: $Nil, 2022: $Nil).
The consolidated entity has elected to recognise payments for short-term leases and low value leases as expenses on
a straight line basis, instead of recognising a right-of-use asset and lease liability. Short-term leases are leases with a
lease term of 12 months or less. Low value assets are assets with a fair value of $10,000 or less when new and
comprise mainly of small office and medical equipment items.
AASB 16 Leases (AASB 16) requires a lessee to recognise a right-of-use asset and a corresponding lease liability for
most leases.

CONSOLIDATED
The consolidated entity continues to carry the responsibility to make good, and to control the fit-out during the
remaining occupancy period as the entity receives the economic benefits via using the fit-out or expected
compensation from PNSW upon relocation. Therefore, the consolidated entity's accounting treatment for make-good
provision and fit-out costs in relation to the relevant accommodation and warehouses remains unchanged.

The right-of-use assets are also subject to impairment. The consolidated entity assesses, at each reporting date,
whether there is an indication that an asset may be impaired. If any indication exists, or when annual impairment
testing for an asset is required, the consolidated entity estimates the asset's recoverable amount. When the
carrying amount of an asset exceeds its recoverable amount, the asset is considered impaired and is written down
to its recoverable amount. After an impairment loss has been recognised, it is reversed only if there has been a
change in the assumptions used to determine the asset's recoverable amount. The reversal is limited so that the
carrying amount of the asset does not exceed its recoverable amount, nor exceed the carrying amount that would
have been determined, net of depreciation, had no impairment loss been recognised for the asset in prior years.
Such reversal is recognised in the net result.
Leases at significantly below market terms and conditions principally to enable the entity to further its objectives
Recognition and measurement
The right-of-use assets are subsequently measured at cost. They are depreciated on a straight-line basis over the
shorter of the lease term and the estimated useful lives of the assets, as follows:
If ownership of the leased asset transfers to the consolidated entity at the end of the lease term or the cost
reflects the exercise of a purchase option, depreciation is calculated using the estimated useful life of the asset.
The consolidated entity assesses at contract inception whether a contract is, or contains, a lease. That is, if the
contract conveys the right to control the use of an identified asset for a period of time in exchange for consideration.
The consolidated entity recognises lease liabilities to make lease payments and right-of-use assets representing the
right to use the underlying assets, except for short-term leases and leases of low-value assets.
The consolidated entity entered into a number of leases, with lease terms ranging from 1 to 99 years with various
organisations, including local councils, health charities, Catholic churches and other NSW State entities for the use of
various community health buildings. There are also some leases for the use of various helipads across the state. These
contracts generally specify lease payments of $Nil or negligible amounts per annum, and the leased premises are
used by the consolidated entity to provide different community health services and access to helipads. These
community health buildings and helipads account for a small portion of similar assets used by the consolidated entity
for the purposes of providing health services. Therefore, these lease arrangements do not have a significant impact on
the consolidated entity's operations.                                                                         
The consolidated entity recognises right-of-use assets at the commencement date of the lease (i.e. the date the
underlying asset is available for use). Right-of-use assets are initially measured at the amount of initial
measurement of the lease liability (refer ii below), adjusted by any lease payments made at or before the
commencement date, lease incentives, any initial direct costs incurred, and estimated costs of dismantling and
removing the asset or restoring the site.

The lease payments are discounted using the interest rate implicit in the lease. If that rate cannot be readily
determined, which is generally the case for real estate leases, the incremental borrowing rate is used. The
consolidated entity does not borrow funds in the market. Instead it receives an allocation of the appropriations
from the Crown and where the Crown needs additional funding, Treasury Corporation (TCorp) goes to the market
to obtain these funds. As a result, the consolidated entity is using TCorp rates as its incremental borrowing rate.
These rates are published by NSW Treasury on a regular basis.
Short-term leases and leases of low-value assets
The initial and subsequent measurement of right-of-use assets under leases at significantly below-market terms
and conditions that are entered into principally to enable the consolidated entity to further its objectives is the
same as normal right-of-use assets. They are measured at cost, subject to impairment.
Leases that have significantly below-market terms and conditions principally to enable the entity to further its
objectives
After the commencement date, the amount of lease liabilities is increased to reflect the accretion of interest and
reduced for the lease payments made. In addition, the carrying amount of lease liabilities is remeasured if there is
a modification, a change in the lease term, a change in the lease payments (e.g. changes to future payments
resulting from a change in an index or rate used to determine such lease payments) or a change in the assessment
of an option to purchase the underlying asset.
The consolidated entity's lease liabilities are included in borrowings in Note 33.
Variable lease payments that do not depend on an index or a rate are recognised as expenses (unless they are
incurred to produce inventories) in the period in which the event or condition that triggers the payment occurs.
Recognition and measurement (continued)
●  exercise price of a purchase option reasonably certain to be exercised by the consolidated entity; and
●payments of penalties for terminating the lease, if the lease term reflects the entity exercising the option to
terminate.
Lease liabilities
At the commencement date of the lease, the consolidated entity recognises lease liabilities measured at the
present value of lease payments to be made over the lease term. Lease payments include:
●  fixed payments (including in substance fixed payments) less any lease incentives receivable;
●  variable lease payments that depend on an index or a rate;
●  amounts expected to be paid under residual value guarantees;
The consolidated entity applies the short-term lease recognition exemption to its short-term leases of buildings,
machinery, motor vehicles and equipment (i.e., those leases that have a lease term of 12 months or less from the
commencement date and do not contain a purchase option). It also applies the lease of low-value assets
recognition exemption to leases of office equipment that are considered to be low value. Lease payments on short-
term leases and leases of low value assets are recognised as expense on a straight-line basis over the lease term.

The consolidated entity leases some retail spaces located within the hospital precincts under operating leases with
rental payable monthly. Lease payments generally contain uplift clauses to align to the market conditions.
Recognition and measurement
The consolidated entity also leases out certain areas and floors within its buildings on a long term basis, which are
treated as finance leases. All lease payments are generally paid upfront and the asset gets derecognised from non-
current assets.                                                                   
Future minimum rentals receivable (undiscounted) under non-cancellable finance leases as at 30 June are, as follows:
At the lease commencement date, the consolidated entity recognises a receivable for assets held under a finance
lease in its Statement of Financial Position at an amount equal to the net investment in the lease. The net investment in
leases is classified as financial assets at amortised cost and equals the lease payments receivable by a lessor and the
unguaranteed residual value, plus initial direct costs, discounted using the interest rate implicit in the lease.
Leases that the consolidated entity transfers substantially all the risks and rewards incidental to ownership of an asset
are classified as finance leases. Subleases are classified by reference to the right-of-use asset arising from the head
lease, rather than by reference to the underlying asset.
Reconciliation of net investment in leases
The consolidated entity also leases land and buildings to non-government organisations (NGO's) and universities under
operating leases arrangements. Generally there are no rental payments as the consolidated entity provides market
rental assistance grants which offset the rental payments.

Ambulance Service of NSW has entered into a 10 year contract with Pel-Air Aviation Pty Ltd to provide aeromedical
services. The contract has a lease component for the right-to-use of the contracted aircraft. Stage 2, which includes
two additional aircraft, has not yet commenced operating and as a result, no right-of-use asset or liability has been
recognised at the reporting date in respect of those two aircraft. Future cash outflows from the lease of these two
aircraft is expected to be $67.62 million.
An operating lease is a lease other than a finance lease. Rental income arising from operating leases is accounted for
on a straight-line basis over the lease terms and is included in other revenue in the Statement of Comprehensive
Income due to its operating nature. Initial direct costs incurred in negotiating and arranging an operating lease are
added to the carrying amount of the underlying asset and recognised over the lease term on the same basis as rental
income. Contingent rents are recognised as revenue in the period in which they are earned.
Leases not yet commenced to which the lessee is committed
Future minimum rental receivables (undiscounted) under non-cancellable operating leases as at 30 June are as
follows:
Finance income arising from finance leases is recognised over the lease term, based on a pattern reflecting a constant
periodic rate of return on the lessor’s net investment in the lease.

Further details regarding the fair value measurement are disclosed in Note 29.
Intangible assets with indefinite useful lives are not amortised, but are tested for impairment annually. The assessment
of indefinite life is reviewed annually to determine whether the indefinite life continues to be supportable. If not, the
change in useful life from indefinite to finite is made on a prospective basis.
Intangible assets are tested for impairment where an indicator of impairment exists. If the recoverable amount is less
than its carrying amount, the carrying amount is reduced to recoverable amount and the reduction is recognised as an
impairment loss.
These assets are not depreciated while they are classified as held for sale. Interest and other expenses attributable to
the liabilities of a disposal group classified as held for sale are continued to be recognised.
The consolidated entity has certain non-current assets classified as held for sale, where their carrying amount will be
recovered principally through a sale transaction, not through continuing use. Non-current assets held for sale are
recognised at the lower of carrying amount and fair value less costs of disposal. 
Recognition and Measurement
The consolidated entity recognises intangible assets only if it is probable that future economic benefits will flow to the
consolidated entity and the cost of the asset can be measured reliably. Intangible assets are measured initially at cost.
Where an asset is acquired at no or nominal cost, the cost is its fair value as at the date of acquisition. Following initial
recognition, intangible assets are subsequently measured at fair value only if there is an active market. If there is no
active market for the consolidated entity's intangible assets, the assets are carried at cost less any accumulated
amortisation and impairment losses.
All research costs are expensed. Development costs are only capitalised when certain criteria are met.
The useful lives of intangible assets are assessed to be finite. 
The consolidated entity's intangible assets are amortised using the straight-line method over a period of four to fifteen
years. Computer software developed or acquired by the consolidated entity are recognised as intangible assets.
The amortisation period and the amortisation method for an intangible asset with a finite useful life are reviewed at
least at the end of each reporting period.

There were no transfers between Level 1 and 2 during the year ended 30 June 2023 and 2022.
(i) Leasehold improvements, work in progress and newly completed buildings are carried at cost, therefore excluded from figures
above and as a result the balances in Note 25 will not reconcile with balances disclosed above.
Fair value is the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction
between market participants at the measurement date. The fair value measurement is based on the presumption that
the transaction to sell the asset or transfer the liability takes place either in the principal market for the asset or
liability or in the absence of a principal market, in the most advantageous market for the asset or liability. 
When measuring fair value, the valuation technique used maximises the use of relevant observable inputs and
minimises the use of unobservable inputs. Under AASB 13 Fair Value Measurement,
the consolidated entity
categorises, for disclosure purposes, the valuation techniques based on the inputs used in the valuation techniques as
follows: 
Level 1 – quoted (unadjusted) prices in active markets for identical assets / liabilities that the entity can access at
the measurement date.
Level 2 – inputs other than quoted prices included within Level 1 that are observable, either directly or indirectly.
Level 3 – inputs that are not based on observable market data (unobservable inputs).
The consolidated entity recognises transfers between levels of the fair value hierarchy at the end of the reporting
period during which the change has occurred.
(ii) Land and buildings – Level 3 has been restated higher by $276.27 million as a result of some assets incorrectly excluded and
some incorrectly included in the 2022 financial statements.
(iii) Infrastructure systems – Level 3 has been restated higher by $17.52 million as a result of some assets incorrectly excluded in
the 2022 financial statements.

(b)
Valuation techniques, inputs and processes
The consolidated entity obtains independent valuations for its non-financial assets at least every three years. The
valuer used by the consolidated entity is independent of the respective entities.
At the end of each reporting period, the consolidated entity updates its assessment of the fair value of each
category of non-financial assets, taking into account the most recent independent valuations. The best evidence
of fair value is current prices in an active market for similar assets. Where such information is not available, the
consolidated entity considers information from other sources, such as the indices provided by independent
external valuers. These fair value adjustments are reflected in Note 25 Total property, plant and equipment -
reconciliation.
The valuations techniques used maximise the use of observable inputs where available and rely as little as
possible on entity or asset specific estimates. The level in the fair value hierarchy is determined on the basis of the
lowest level input that is significant to the measurement in its entirety. If significant inputs required to measure
fair value of an asset are observable, the asset is included in level 2 of the fair value hierarchy. If one or more of
the significant inputs is not based on observable market data, the asset is included in level 3 of the fair value
hierarchy. All resulting fair value estimates for non-financial assets are included in level 3 with the exception of
some land and buildings and non-current assets held for sale included in level 2.

building(s)
The non-financial assets categorised in (a) above have been measured based on the following valuation
techniques and inputs:
For land, the valuation by the valuers is made on a market approach, comparing similar assets (not identical)
and observable inputs. The most significant input is price per square metre. All commercial and non-
restricted land is included in level 2 as these land valuations have a high level of observable inputs, although
these lands are not identical. The majority of the restricted land has been classified as level 3 as, although
observable inputs have been used, a significant level of professional judgement is required to adjust inputs
in determining the land valuations. Certain parcels of land have zoning restrictions, for example hospital
grounds, and values are adjusted accordingly. 
For buildings and infrastructure systems, many assets are of a specialised nature or use, and thus the most
appropriate valuation method is depreciated replacement cost. These assets are included as level 3 as
these assets have a high level of unobservable inputs. However, residential and commercial properties are
valued on a market approach and are included in level 2.
Non-current assets held for sale are a non-recurring item that is measured at the lesser of its carrying
amount or fair value less cost to sell. These assets are categorised as level 2 except when an asset was a
level 3 asset prior to transfer to non-current assets held for sale, and continues to be recognised as a level 3
asset where the carrying amount is less than the fair value (less cost) to sell. 
The fair value of buildings computed by suitably qualified independent valuers using a methodology known as
the depreciated replacement cost valuation technique. The following table highlights the key unobservable (level
3) inputs assessed during the valuation process, the relationship to the estimated fair value and the sensitivity to
changes in unobservable inputs.

Payables are financial liabilities at amortised cost, initially measured at fair value, net of directly attributable
transaction costs. These are subsequently measured at amortised cost using the effective interest method. Gains and
losses are recognised in the net result when the liabilities are derecognised as well as through the amortisation
process.
Recognition and Measurement
Payables represent liabilities for goods and services provided to the consolidated entity and other amounts. Short-term
payables with no stated interest rate are measured at the original invoice amount where the effect of discounting is
immaterial. 
Details regarding liquidity risk, including a maturity analysis of the above payables are disclosed in Note 44.
¹ Manual creditors has been reclassified from 'other creditors - other' to 'trade operating creditors' and 'payables to controlled health
entities' in the current year. The prior period 'other creditors - other' has been restated lower by $838.90 million (parent entity: $134.59
million), 'trade operating creditors' higher by $838.90 million (parent entity: $134.58 million) and 'payables to controlled health entities'
higher by $Nil (parent entity: $0.003 million) to reflect this change.

Contract liabilities are in respect of consideration received in advance from the sale of goods and services from
contracts with customers and grants and other contributions.
The current contract liability balance has increased in the consolidated entity and reduced in the parent entity during
the year due to the timing of meeting the specific performance obligations within the contracts. The non-current
contract liability has decreased in the consolidated entity as some long term grants and other contribution funds were
reclassified to current within the current year.
The balance of the contract liabilities at the 30 June 2023 was impacted by the timing of payments received for the
sales of goods and services from contracts with customers and grants and other contributions. The satisfaction of the
specific performance obligations within the contracts hadn't been met at the 30 June 2023. Revenue from the contract
liabilities will be recognised when the specific performance obligations have been met.

* This relates to contractual payments made to the operator, refer to Note 25 for further details on the consolidated
entity's service concession arrangements.
Borrowings represents interest bearing liabilities mainly through NSW Treasury Corporation, lease liabilities, service
concessions arrangement liabilities, other interest bearing liabilities and derivatives.
Details regarding liquidity risk, including a maturity analysis of the above borrowings are disclosed in Note 44.
No assets have been pledged as security / collateral for liabilities and there are no restrictions on any title to property.
The Public, Private Partnerships (PPP) relate to the provision of service-enabling infrastructure that includes private
sector delivering a combination of design, construction, financing, maintenance, operations and delivery of clinical and
non-clinical services. Payments are made by the consolidated entity to the private sector entities on the basis of
delivery of assets or service delivery. The liability to pay private sector entities is based on financing arrangements
involving Consumer Price Index (CPI)-linked finance and fixed finance.

Recognition and Measurement
Financial liabilities at amortised cost
Financial liabilities at fair value through profit or loss
●
●
●
Financial guarantees
Borrowings classified as financial liabilities at amortised cost are initially measured at fair value, net of directly
attributable transaction costs. These are subsequently measured at amortised cost using the effective interest method.
Gains and losses are recognised in the net result when the liabilities are derecognised as well as through the
amortisation process. 
Financial guarantee contracts are recognised as a financial liability at the time the guarantee is issued. The liability is
initially measured at fair value, being the premium received. Subsequent to initial recognition, the consolidated entity's
liability under each guarantee is measured at the higher of the amount initially recognised less cumulative amortisation,
and an expected credit loss provision.
The consolidated and parent entity has not granted any financial guarantees.
A financial guarantee contract is a contract that requires the issuer to make specified payments to reimburse the holder
for a loss it incurs because a specified debtor fails to make payment when due in accordance with the original or
modified terms of a debt instrument.  
Financial liabilities at fair value through profit or loss include financial liabilities held-for-trading such as derivative
financial liabilities designated upon initial recognition as at fair value through profit or loss.
Financial liabilities are classified as held-for-trading if they are incurred for the purpose of repurchasing in the near
term or on initial recognition are part of a portfolio of identified financial instruments that are managed together and for
which there is evidence of a recent actual pattern of short-term profit-taking. Derivatives are economic hedges
classified as at fair value through profit or loss unless they are designated as effective hedging instruments.
Derivatives are carried as financial liabilities when the fair value is negative. Gains or losses on derivative liabilities are
recognised in the net result as the consolidated entity has elected not to apply hedge accounting.
Management only designates an instrument at FVPL upon initial recognition when one of the following criteria are met.
Such designation is determined on an instrument-by-instrument basis:
The changes in fair value of liabilities designated at fair value through profit or loss are recorded in profit or loss with
the exception that movements in fair value due to changes in the entity's own credit risk are recorded in other
comprehensive income and do not get recycled to net result.
The consolidated entity has not designated any financial liability as at fair value through profit or loss.
the designation eliminates, or significantly reduces, the inconsistent treatment that would otherwise arise from
measuring the assets or liabilities or recognising gains or losses on them on a different basis; or
the liabilities are part of a group of financial liabilities, that are managed and their performance evaluated on a fair
value basis, in accordance with a documented risk management or investment strategy; or
the liabilities contain one or more embedded derivatives, unless they do not significantly modify the cash flows
that would otherwise be required by the contract, or it is clear with little or no analysis when a similar instrument is
first considered that separation of the embedded derivative(s) is prohibited.

Movements in provisions (other than employee benefits)
Movements in each class of provision during the financial year, other than employee benefits, are set out below:
The majority of 'restoration costs' represent the expected cost to restore a leased asset at the end of the lease term.
Lease end dates vary across the consolidated entity's lease portfolio and therefore the timing of the payments to
restore the leased asset at the end of the term will vary. The majority of the 'restoration cost' provision is as per the
lease contracts.
The remaining balance consists of site remediation costs with the majority of the payments not expected to be made
until 2024.

Recognition and Measurement 
Employee benefits and related on-costs
Salaries and wages, annual leave, allocated days off (ADOs), parental leave, sick leave and on-costs
Salaries and wages (including non-monetary benefits) and paid sick leave that are expected to be settled wholly within
12 months after the end of the period in which the employees render the service are recognised and measured at the
undiscounted amounts of the benefits. 
Annual leave, ADOs and parental leave are not expected to be settled wholly before twelve months after the end of the
annual reporting period in which the employees render the related service. As such, it is required to be measured at
present value in accordance with AASB 119 Employee Benefits  (although short-cut methods are permitted).
Actuarial advice obtained by NSW Treasury, an entity controlled by the ultimate parent, has confirmed that using the
nominal annual leave balance plus the annual leave entitlements accrued while taking annual leave (calculated using
8.4% to 14.03% of nominal value of annual leave) can be used to approximate the present value of the annual leave
liability. The consolidated entity has assessed the actuarial advice based on the consolidated entity's circumstances to
annual leave, ADOs and parental leave and has determined that the effect of discounting is immaterial. All annual
leave is classified as a current liability even where the consolidated entity does not expect to settle the liability within
12 months as the consolidated entity does not have an unconditional right to defer settlement.
Unused non-vesting sick leave does not give rise to a liability as it is not considered probable that sick leave taken in
the future will be greater than the benefits accrued in the future.
Movements in provisions (other than employee benefits) (continued)
The majority of the 'other' provision represent various contractual related obligations. The consolidated and parent
entity has recognised the provision amount by taking into consideration all available information at the reporting date
and making the best management estimation of the obligation. The timing of the payments will vary for each
contractual related obligations.
* In 2022, additional provisions recognised included a one-off payment to visiting medical officers of $18.28 million
(parent entity: $Nil) and affiliated health organisations of $19.89 million (parent entity: $11.40 million) for the
recognition of service during the COVID-19 pandemic.

34. Provisions (continued)
Recognition and Measurement (continued)
If the effect of the time value of money is material, provisions are discounted at a pre-tax rate that reflects the current
market assessments of the time value of money and the risks specific to the liability. When discounting is used, the
increase in the provision due to the passage of time (i.e. unwinding of discount rate) is recognised as a finance cost.
Any provisions for restructuring are recognised only when the consolidated entity has a detailed formal plan, and the
entity has raised a valid expectation in those affected by the restructuring that it will carry out the restructuring by
starting to implement the plan or announcing its main features to those affected.
Other provisions are recognised when the consolidated entity has a present legal or constructive obligation as a result
of a past event; it is probable that an outflow of resources will be required to settle the obligation; and a reliable
estimate can be made of the amount of the obligation. When the consolidated entity expects some or all of a provision
to be reimbursed, for example, under an insurance contract, the reimbursement is recognised as a separate asset, but
only when the reimbursement is virtually certain. The expense relating to a provision is presented net of any
reimbursement in the consolidated Statement of Comprehensive Income.
Consequential on-costs
Consequential costs to employment are recognised as liabilities and expenses where the employee benefits to which
they relate have been recognised. This includes outstanding amounts of payroll tax, workers' compensation insurance
premiums and fringe benefits tax.
Other provisions
Specific on-costs relating to long service leave assumed by The Crown in right of the State of New South Wales are
borne by the consolidated entity.
Long service leave is measured at the present value of expected future payments to be made in respect of services
provided up to the reporting date. Consideration is given to certain factors based on an actuarial review, including
expected future wage and salary levels, experience of employee departures, and periods of service. Expected future
payments are discounted using the long-term Commonwealth Government bond rate at the reporting date.
The superannuation expense for the financial year is determined by using the formula specified in the NSW Treasury's,
an entity controlled by the ultimate parent entity, Directions. The expense for certain superannuation schemes (i.e.
Basic Benefit and Aware Super) is calculated as a percentage of the employees' salary. For other superannuation
schemes (i.e. State Superannuation Scheme and State Authorities Superannuation Scheme), the expense is calculated
as a multiple of the employees' superannuation contributions.
The consolidated entity's liability for long service leave and defined benefit superannuation are assumed by The Crown
in right of the State of New South Wales. The consolidated entity accounts for the liability as having been extinguished
resulting in the amount assumed being shown as part of the non-monetary revenue item described as 'Acceptance by
the Crown of employee benefits and other liabilities'.

The Greater Sydney Parklands Trust Act 2022 commenced on 1 July 2022, which amended the Paramatta Park Trust Act
2001 to provide for Wistaria Gardens to be vested in the Parramatta Park Trust, an entity controlled by the ultimate
parent. The transfer of Wistaria Gardens to the Parramatta Park Trust was completed on the 1 July 2022 and was treated
as an equity transfer. The Wistaria Garden assets were carried at fair value. The carrying amount of the assets prior to
the transfer was $9.4 million.
PARENT
In 2022, in accordance with the Real Property Disposal Framework, the following assets were transferred from
Ambulance Service of NSW, Illawarra Shoalhaven Local Health District, Mid North Coast Local Health District and
Northern Sydney Local Health District, controlled entities of the Ministry of Health, at the fair value of the asset: Bulli
Hospital, 29 Hospital Road Bulli $5.0 million, Macksville Hospital, 14 - 22 Boundary Street Macksville $1.6 million,
Macquarie Hospital, 120 Coxs Road North Ryde $2.9 million and Wagga Wagga ambulance station, 54 Johnston Street
Wagga Wagga $0.6 million.
In 2023, in accordance with the Real Property Disposal Framework, the following assets were transferred from
Ambulance Service of NSW and Northern Sydney Local Health District, controlled entities of the Ministry of Health, at
fair value of the asset: Yass ambulance station, 88 Meehan Street Yass $0.4 million and 10 Kooloora Avenue Freshwater
$6.0 million.
The category 'accumulated funds' includes all current and prior period retained funds.
The revaluation surplus is used to record increments and decrements on the revaluation of non-current assets. This
accords with the consolidated entity's policy on the revaluation of property, plant and equipment as discussed in Note
25.
Transfer of property, plant and equipment
Separate reserve accounts are recognised in the financial statements only if such accounts are required by specific
legislation or Australian Accounting Standards (e.g. revaluation surplus and foreign currency translation reserve).

Input tax receivable related to capital commitments for expenditure
Output tax payable related to commitments for revenue
Aggregate capital expenditure for the acquisition of land and buildings, plant and equipment, infrastructure and
intangible assets, contracted for at balance date and not provided for:
The total of capital 'commitments' payable, i.e. $3,092 million as at 30 June 2023, includes input tax credits of
$281.10 million that are expected to be recoverable from the Australian Taxation Office (2022: $211.70 million).
The total of 'commitments' receivable, i.e. $179 million as at 30 June 2023, includes input tax of $16.30 million that
is expected to be payable to the Australian Taxation Office (2022: $13.20 million).
All other equity transfers are recognised at fair value, except for intangibles. Where an intangible has been recognised
at (amortised) cost by the transferor because there is no active market, the consolidated entity recognises the asset at
the transferor's carrying amount. Where the transferor is prohibited from recognising internally generated intangibles,
the consolidated entity does not recognise that asset.
Recognition and Measurement
The transfer of net assets between entities as a result of an administrative restructure, transfers of programs / functions
and parts thereof between entities controlled by the ultimate parent is designated or required by Accounting Standards
to be treated as contributions by owners and is recognised as an adjustment to 'accumulated funds'. This treatment is
consistent with AASB 1004 and Australian Accounting Interpretation 1038 Contributions by Owners Made to Wholly-
Owned Public Sector Entities.
Transfers arising from an administrative restructure involving not-for-profit and for-profit government entities are
recognised at the amount at which the assets and liabilities were recognised by the transferor immediately prior to the
restructure. Subject to below, in most instances this will approximate fair value.

The consolidated entity holds money in trust in relation to patient trusts, refundable deposits, private patient trust
funds and third party funds. As the consolidated entity performs only a custodial role in respect of trust monies, they
are excluded from the financial statements as the consolidated entity cannot use them for the achievement of its own
objectives. The following is a summary of the transactions in the trust account. 
The parent entity holds money in a trust in relation to Nationally Funded Centres (NFC), Health Chief Executives Forum
(HCEF) formerly known as Australian Health Ministers' Advisory Council (AHMAC) and other third party funds. As the

Set out below are the associates of Hunter New England Local Health District (HNELHD) as at 30 June 2023 which, in the opinion of management at HNELHD, are material to the
group. The proportion of ownership interest held by the group equals the voting rights held by the group.
Central Coast Local Health District has entered into an agreement called Affiliation Agreement for the Central Coast Research Institute (CCRI) with the University of Newcastle,
to undertake research.
The agreement requires equal appointment of directors to the CCRI's Governance Board, which will be managing the relevant activities of the CCRI. Both parties have direct
rights to the assets of the CCRI and are jointly and severally liable for the liabilities incurred. CCRI is therefore classified as a joint operation and Central Coast Local Health
District recognises its direct right to the jointly held assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses and its share of any jointly held or incurred assets, liabilities, revenues and
expenses. These have been incorporated in the financial statements under the appropriate headings.
Hunter Medical Research Institute is a company limited by guarantee, whose constitution prohibits the distribution of funds to its members. Accordingly the carrying amount has
been equity accounted at $Nil value and as such no financial information has been disclosed.

Impairment losses on financial assets includes higher than expected credit losses for receivables than
budget.
Investment revenue exceeded budget as a result of higher interest rates on financial assets at
amortised cost and higher distributions and unit price increases on TCorpIM fund investments.
Grants and other contributions revenue was lower than budget resulting from reduced National Health
Reform Funding Agreement revenue due to lower activity levels but partly offset by higher revenue
recognised under the Commonwealth National Partnership Agreements for COVID-19.
Gains / (losses) on disposal exceeded budget due to the disposal of various items of property, plant and
equipment below their written down value and other gains / (losses) exceeded budget from increased
write-off of and impairment of medical and surgical supplies.
Other income were lower than budget due to varying other arrangements not occurring throughout the
year.
Net result - budget 
The budgeted amounts are drawn from the original budgeted financial statements presented to Parliament in respect
of the reporting period. Subsequent amendments to the original budget (e.g. adjustment for transfer of functions
between entities as a result of Administrative Arrangements Orders) are not reflected in the budgeted amounts. Major
variances between the original budgeted amounts and the actual amounts disclosed in the financial statements are
explained below.
Sale of goods and services from contracts with customers exceeded budget with fees for medical
services rendered and fees for private usage of hospital facilities increasing due to increasing patient
activity levels.
NET RESULT
The actual net result ($403 million) is lower than the budgeted net result ($617 million) by $214 million for the year
ended 30 June 2023. 
A reconciliation of the movements between the actual and budgeted net result is presented below: 
Net result - actual 
Acceptance by the Crown of employee benefits and other liabilities was lower than budget due to the
timing of employees qualifying for long service leave entitlements and the decrease in the actuarial
valuation to long service leave benefits assumed by the Crown.
Operating expenses were lower than budget resulting from reduced medical and surgical supplies,
specialised health services and outsourced patient care expenses as the COVID-19 response eased.
Employee related expenses were lower than budget due to the one-off payment for the recognition of
service during COVID-19 which was recognised in the prior year and lower spend against workforce
initiatives.
Depreciation and amortisation were lower than budget due to the timing of new capital projects coming 
into service.
Grants and subsidies expenses were higher than expected with higher than anticipated payments
made to affiliated health organisations.
Appropriation funding was lower than budget as appropriations were only drawn down from the
Consolidated Fund to meet the cash requirements for the financial year.
Finance costs were lower than budget from the timing of interest in connection with borrowings.

Net movement across several asset classes due to other minor variations.
Net assets - budget
Borrowings were higher than expected resulting from the additional recognition of leases.
Provisions were higher than expected primarily resulting from annual leave accrued, first time
recognition of parental leave accrued, contractual non employee provisions and prior period error
correction on long service leave consequential on-costs.
Other liabilities were higher than budget due primarily to the recognition of increased revenue
deferrals.
Intangibles were lower than original budget primarily resulting from reduced capital spend.
Payables were lower than expected resulting from decreased operating costs and trade creditors
payable at year end. This reduction was partly offset by increases in accrued salaries, wages and on-
costs due to timing differences.
Contract liabilities were lower than budget due to the timing of meeting the specific performance
obligations within contracts.
ASSETS AND LIABILITIES
The actual net assets ($26,788 million) is higher than the budgeted net assets ($23,921 million) by $2,867 million as at
30 June 2023. 
A reconciliation of the movements between significant assets and liabilities is presented below: 
Net assets - actual
Cash and cash equivalents were higher than expected resulting from the timing of year end creditor
and payroll payments, the divestment of TCorpIM fund investments into cash holdings and higher
restricted financial asset holdings.
Right-of-use assets were higher than budget due to lease remeasurements and additional aeromedical
and property leases.
Property, plant and equipment was higher than expected primarily due to increases resulting from
revaluation adjustments not captured in the budget.
Financial assets at fair value were lower than budget primarily as a result of the divestment of a
number of TCorpIM fund investments into cash holdings and no new financial assets were entered into
throughout the financial year.
Inventories were higher than budget due to lower consumption rates of medical and surgical supplies
than expected, including rapid antigen tests.
Receivables were higher than budget under trade receivables from contracts with customers as a
result of increased debtor balances for the Commonwealth National Partnership Agreements on COVID-
19 and prepayment balances for capital projects.

CASH FLOWS
Operating activities net cash inflows were lower than budget by $688 million attributable to receipts being lower than
budget for appropriations but slightly offset by higher sale of goods and services and grants and other contributions.
Similar to receipts, payments were lower than budget due mainly to lower employee related expenses.
Financing net cash outflows were higher than expected by $14 million. This was attributable primarily to higher
repayments of the principal portion of lease liabilities and service concession financial liabilities than budgeted. 
Investing activities net cash outflows were lower than budget by $562 million attributable to decreases in purchases
of property, plant and equipment and intangibles, and increases in proceeds from the sale of property, plant and
equipment and intangibles and financial assets sales.

The consolidated entity's principal financial instruments are outlined below. These financial instruments arise directly
from the consolidated entity's operations or are required to finance its operations. The consolidated entity does not enter
into or trade financial instruments, including derivative financial instruments, for speculative purposes.
The consolidated entity's main risks arising from financial instruments are outlined below, together with the consolidated
entity's objectives, policies and processes for measuring and managing risk. Further quantitative and qualitative
disclosures are included throughout these financial statements.
The Secretary of NSW Health has overall responsibility for the establishment and oversight of risk management and
reviews and agrees policies for managing each of these risks. Risk management policies are established to identify and
analyse the risks faced by the consolidated and parent entities, to set risk limits and controls and to monitor risks.
Compliance with policies is reviewed on a continuous basis.

Derecognition of financial assets and financial liabilities
The consolidated entity determines the classification of its financial assets and liabilities after initial recognition and,
when allowed and appropriate, re-evaluates this at each financial year end.

Carrying amount
A financial asset (or, where applicable, a part of a financial asset or part of a group of similar financial assets) is
derecognised when the contractual rights to the cash flows from the financial assets expire; or if the entity transfers
its rights to receive cash flows from the asset or has assumed an obligation to pay the received cash flows in full
without material delay to a third party under a pass through arrangement and either:
When the consolidated entity has transferred its rights to receive cash flows from an asset or has entered into a pass
through arrangement, it evaluates if, and to what extent, it has retained the risks and rewards of ownership. Where
the consolidated entity has neither transferred nor retained substantially all the risks and rewards or transferred
control, the asset continues to be recognised to the extent of the consolidated entity continuing involvement in the
asset. In that case, the consolidated entity also recognises an associated liability. The transferred asset and the
associated liability are measured on a basis that reflects the rights and obligations that the entity has retained.
●  the consolidated entity has transferred substantially all the risks and rewards of the asset; or
●the consolidated entity has neither transferred nor retained substantially all the risks and rewards for the asset,
but has transferred control.
Continuing involvement that takes the form of a guarantee over the transferred asset is measured at the lower of the
original carrying amount of the asset and the maximum amount of consideration that the consolidated entity could be
required to repay.

Financial risks
i. Credit risk 
Cash and cash equivalents
Credit risk associated with the consolidated entity's financial assets, other than receivables, is managed through the
selection of counterparties and establishment of minimum credit rating standards.
A financial liability is derecognised when the obligation specified in the contract is discharged or cancelled or
expires. When an existing financial liability is replaced by another from the same lender on substantially different
terms, or the terms of an existing liability are substantially modified, such an exchange or modification is treated as
the derecognition of the original liability and the recognition of a new liability. The difference in the respective
carrying amounts is recognised in the net result.
The consolidated entity considers a financial asset in default when contractual payments are 90 days past due.
However, in certain cases, the consolidated entity may also consider a financial asset to be in default when internal or
external information indicates that the entity is unlikely to receive the outstanding contractual amounts in full before
taking into account any credit enhancements held by the consolidated entity.
Financial assets and financial liabilities are offset and the net amount is reported in the Statement of Financial
Position if there is a currently enforceable legal right to offset the recognised amounts and there is an intention to
settle on a net basis, or to realise the assets and settle the liabilities simultaneously.
Credit risk arises from financial assets of the consolidated entity, including cash, receivables and authority deposits.
No collateral is held by the consolidated entity. The consolidated entity has not granted any financial guarantees.
Credit risk arises when there is the possibility that the counterparty will default on their contractual obligations,
resulting in a financial loss to the consolidated entity. The maximum exposure to credit risk is generally represented
by the carrying amount of the financial assets (net of any allowance for credit losses or allowance for impairment).
To measure the expected credit losses, trade receivables, other receivables, contract assets and lease receivables
have been grouped based on shared credit risk characteristics and the days past due.
Accounting policy for impairment of trade receivables and other financial assets
Receivables - trade receivables, other receivables, contract assets and lease receivables
The consolidated entity applies the AASB 9 simplified approach to measuring expected credit losses which uses a
lifetime expected loss allowance for all trade receivables, other receivables, contract assets and lease receivables.
Collectability of trade receivables, other receivables, contract assets and lease receivables is reviewed on an ongoing
basis. Procedures as established in the Treasurer's Directions are followed to recover outstanding amounts, including
letters of demand.
Cash comprises cash on hand and bank balances within the NSW Treasury Banking System. Interest is earned on
daily bank balances at the monthly average NSW Treasury Corporation (TCorp) 11am unofficial cash rate, adjusted for
a management fee to NSW Treasury. The TCorp IM Funds cash facility is discussed in market risk below.

i. Credit risk (continued)
Trade receivables, other receivables, contract assets and lease receivables are written off when there is no
reasonable expectation of recovery. Indicators that there is no reasonable expectation of recovery include, amongst
others a failure to make contractual payments for a period of greater than 90 days past due.
The expected loss rates are based on historical observed loss rates. The historical loss rates are adjusted to reflect
current and forward-looking information on macroeconomic factors affecting the ability of the customers to settle
the receivables. The consolidated entity has not identified any relevant factors, and accordingly has not adjusted the
historical loss rates.

Notes
The loss allowance for trade receivables, other receivables, contract assets and lease receivables as at 30 June 2023
and 2022 was determined as follows:
The consolidated entity is not materially exposed to concentrations of credit risk to a single trade debtor or group of
debtors as at 30 June 2023 and 30 June 2022.
30 June 2023
30 June 2022
30 June 2023
30 June 2022
¹ The analysis excludes statutory receivables and prepayments as these are not within the scope of AASB 7 Financial Instruments:
Disclosures. Therefore the 'total' will not reconcile to the receivables total in Note 20 and the contract assets total in Note 21.
2 The estimated total gross carrying amount for the parent entity also excludes receivables from controlled health entities.
3 The estimated total gross carrying amount for the parent entity has been restated lower by $0.12 million in the prior period due to an
amount being reclassified from other receivables to receivables from controlled health entities.

ii. Liquidity risk
Liquidity risk is the risk that the consolidated entity will be unable to meet its payment obligations when they fall
due. The consolidated entity continuously manages risk through monitoring future cash flows and maturities
planning to ensure adequate holding of high quality liquid assets. The objective is to maintain a balance between
continuity of funding and flexibility through effective management of cash, investments and liquid assets and
liabilities.
The consolidated entity has negotiated no loan outside of arrangements with the Crown. During the current and prior
year, there were no defaults of loans payable. No assets have been pledged as collateral.
Liquidity risk is minimised by the use of service agreements between the Secretary of NSW Health and controlled
health entities. The annual service agreements, requires controlled entities to manage their financial liquidity and in
particular, meet benchmarks for the payment of creditors. Where the controlled entities fail to meet service
agreement performance standards, the parent as the state manager can take action in accordance with annual
performance framework requirements, including providing financial support and increased management interaction.
For small business suppliers, where payment is not made within the specified time period, simple interest must be
paid automatically unless an existing contract specifies otherwise. 
For other suppliers, where settlement cannot be effected in accordance with the above, e.g. due to short term
liquidity constraints, contact is made with creditors and terms of payment are negotiated to the satisfaction of both
parties.
Liabilities are recognised for amounts due to be paid in the future for goods or services received, whether or not
invoiced. For a supplier, that has a correctly rendered invoice, a matched purchase order and where goods have been
received, an immediate payment is made irrespective of current contract payment terms.

Market risk is the risk that the fair value of future cash flows of a financial instrument will fluctuate because of
changes in market prices. The consolidated entity's exposures to market risk are primarily through interest rate risk
on the consolidated entity's borrowings, foreign currency risk and other price risks associated with the movement in
the unit price of the Hour Glass Investment Facilities. The consolidated entity does not enter into commodity
contracts.
The effect on net result and equity due to a reasonably possible change in risk variable is outlined in the information
below for interest rate risk, foreign currency risk and other price risk. A reasonably possible change in risk variable
has been determined after taking into account the economic environment in which the consolidated entity operates
and the time frame for the assessment (i.e. until the end of the next annual reporting period). The sensitivity analysis
is based on risk exposures in existence at the Statement of Financial Position reporting date. The analysis was
performed on the same basis for 2022. The analysis assumes that all other variables remain constant.
Interest rate risk is the risk that the fair value or future cash flows of a financial instrument will fluctuate because of
changes in market interest rates. Exposure to interest rate risk arises primarily through the consolidated entity's
interest bearing liabilities.
However, controlled entities are not permitted to borrow external to the Ministry of Health (energy loans which are
negotiated through NSW Treasury are excepted).
Both NSW Treasury and Ministry of Health loans are set at fixed rates and therefore are generally not affected by
fluctuations in market rates. The consolidated entity does not account for any fixed rate financial instruments at fair
value through profit or loss or at fair value through other comprehensive income. Therefore, for these financial
instruments, a change of interest rates would not affect the carrying value or interest paid / earned.
The following table demonstrates the sensitivity to a reasonably possible change in interest rates:
A reasonably possible change of +/-1% is used consistent with current trends in interest rates (based on official RBA
interest rate volatility over the last five years). The basis will be reviewed annually and amended where there is a
structural change in the level of interest rate volatility.

A sensitivity analysis has been disclosed for the cash held in foreign currency bank account and outstanding
derivative contracts at year end. A sensitivity of 10% movement in the exchange rates has been selected for use in the 
sensitivity analysis at the reporting date, as this is considered reasonable, based on the current Australian dollar level
and the historical volatility of the Australian dollar against the US currency. Based on the value of the Australian
dollar at the reporting date as compared with the currencies below, adverse or favourable movements in the foreign
exchange rates would result in an increase or decrease in the Australian dollar fair value respectively.
Exposure to foreign exchange risk arises primarily through the contractual commercial transactions denominated in a
foreign currency. The risk is measured using sensitivity analysis and cash flow forecasting.
The consolidated entity manages its foreign exchange risk by maintaining foreign currency denominated bank
accounts or buying foreign currency from TCorp at the time of purchase commitment, or enters into derivative
economic hedges with TCorp in accordance with the consolidated entity's risk management policies.
At year end, the consolidated entity did not hold any foreign currency denominated monetary assets and monetary
liabilities, except for cash held in a US dollar denominated bank account. All funds held at year end in foreign
currency are expected to be used to settle existing purchase commitments that are denominated in US currency.
The consolidated entity has outstanding forward foreign exchange contracts entered with TCorp to hedge foreign
currency risks. The forward foreign exchange contracts enable the consolidated entity to exchange fixed foreign
currency for fixed AUD at specified future date, enabling cash flow certainty.
The consolidated entity is exposed to foreign exchange risks associated with commercial contracts payments
denominated in foreign currency. The consolidated entity's risk management strategy is to hedge foreign currency
risks by maintaining foreign currency denominated bank accounts, buying foreign currencies from TCorp at the time
of purchase commitment or entering into foreign exchange derivative contracts as approved within internal policies
and guidelines set out under NSW Health's Procurement Policy and broader framework under NSW Government
Foreign Exchange Risk Policy (TPP18-03). The forward foreign exchange derivative contracts are economic hedges
which enables the consolidated entity to exchange a fixed amount of foreign currency for fixed AUD amount at a
specified future settlement date, ensuring cash flow certainty.

Exposure to 'other price risk' primarily arises through the investment in the TCorpIM Funds, which are held for
strategic rather than trading purposes. The consolidated entity has no direct equity investments. The consolidated
entity holds units in the following TCorpIM Funds trusts:
TCorp provides sensitivity analysis information for each of the Investment facilities, which is used to demonstrate the
impact on the funds' net assets as a result of a change in the unit price. This impact is based on a sensitivity rate of
10%, multiplied by the redemption value as at 30 June each year for each facility (balance from TCorpIM Funds
statement). Actual movements in the price risk variables may differ to the sensitivity rate used due to a number of
factors. The TCorpIM Funds are measured at fair value through profit or loss and therefore any change in unit price
impacts directly on net results / equity.
Investment in the TCorpIM Funds facilities limits the consolidated entity's exposure to risk, as it allows diversification
across a pool of funds with different investment horizons and a mix of investments.
The unit price of each facility is equal to the total fair value of net assets held by the facility divided by the total
number of units on issue for that facility. Unit prices are calculated and published daily. TCorp as trustee for each of
the above facilities is required to act in the best interest of the unit holders and to administer the trusts in accordance
with the trust deeds. As trustee, TCorp has appointed external managers to manage the performance and risk of each
facility in accordance with a mandate agreed by the parties. A significant portion of the administration of the facilities
is outsourced to an external custodian.

Fair value is the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction
between market participants at the measurement date. The fair value measurement is based on the presumption
that the transaction to sell the asset or transfer the liability takes place either in the principal market for the asset or
liability or in the absence of a principal market, in the most advantageous market for the asset or liability.
The consolidated entity recognises transfers between levels of the fair value hierarchy at the end of the reporting
period during which the change has occurred.
There were no transfers between Level 1, 2 or 3 during the year ended 30 June 2023 (2022: $Nil).
Derivative economic hedges and TCorpIM Funds Investment Facilities are measured at fair value. Management
assessed that cash and short-term deposits, trade receivables, trade payables and other current liabilities
approximate their fair values, largely due to the short-term maturities of these instruments.
The consolidated entity had no financial liabilities at fair value in the Statement of Financial Position for the year
ended 30 June 2022.
When measuring fair value, the valuation technique used maximises the use of relevant observable inputs and
minimises the use of unobservable inputs. Under AASB 13, the consolidated entity categorises, for disclosure
purposes, the valuation techniques based on the inputs used in the valuation techniques as follows:
●
Level 1 – quoted (unadjusted) prices in active markets for identical assets / liabilities that the entity can access at
the measurement date.
●    Level 2 – inputs other than quoted prices included within Level 1 that are observable, either directly or indirectly.
●    Level 3 – inputs that are not based on observable market data (unobservable inputs).
The parent entity had no financial assets or liabilities at fair value in the Statement of Financial Position for the year
ended 30 June 2023 or 2022.

The value of the TCorpIM Funds Investments is based on the consolidated entity's share of the value of the
underlying assets of the facility, based on the market value. All of the TCorpIM Funds Investment facilities are
valued using 'redemption' pricing.
The fair values of derivative economic hedges are determined using standard valuation technique based on the
applicable market observable rates including spot rate and forward points.
Compensation for the Minister for Health is paid by the Legislature and is not reimbursed by the Ministry of Health
and its controlled entities. Accordingly no such amounts are included in the key management personnel

Year in review
This year, the Agency for Clinical 
Innovation continued to deliver outstanding, diverse, 
award-winning projects that enhanced the provision of 
clinical care across NSW. 
The NSW Telestroke Service won two NSW Health Awards, 
and our Finding Your Way team were finalists for their 
shared decision-making model. The Patient Reported 
Measures team were also finalists in the prestigious 
Premier’s Awards. 
We published our new strategy which signals a change 
in how we work together and partner with clinicians, 
consumers, system leaders and innovators. We are focused 
on pushing the boundaries of innovation and projects that 
drive transformational change. 
This year our governance structure changed from being 
board-governed to being a chief executive-governed 
organisation. I would like to thank the former Agency for 
Clinical Innovation Board who provided more than a decade 
of strong leadership and guidance to our organisation. 
I am very proud of the overwhelmingly positive culture 
that our staff continue to foster, and I thank them for their 
dedication to the agency.
Key achievements

Chief Executive
Dr Diane Watson
Dr Diane Watson has led the 
establishment of three reporting 
agencies in Australia that use big data to 
drive decisions on healthcare provision 
nationally and locally. For more than 30 years, Diane has 
held senior management positions measuring, monitoring 
and reporting on the performance of healthcare systems to 
drive improvements in health, patient care and productivity. 
Diane was the inaugural Chief Executive Officer of the 
Victorian Agency for Health Information and the inaugural 
Chief Executive of the National Health Performance 
Authority.
Year in review
In 2022-23, the Bureau of Health Information further 
enhanced the value of its healthcare performance reporting 
to ensure it continues to inform improvements and 
strengthen accountability across the NSW Health System.
This was achieved by pursuing innovations and efficiencies 
that allowed quicker delivery of high-value insights into 
health services in areas that matter most to patients.
A major focus of this work was the NSW Patient Survey 
Program, with significant improvements to processing 
times that will allow the bureau to provide results sooner 
to healthcare professionals, system managers and 
policymakers. 
The Bureau continued to ensure its reporting is aligned 
with health system priorities. This was achieved through 
the introduction of targeted questionnaire modules in 
areas such as ambulance services, elective surgery, 
virtual care and Aboriginal patient experiences, and new 
short-form reports to deliver high-value insights based on 
advanced analysis of the results. 
The Bureau also responded again to the need for information 
related to the COVID-19 pandemic through major report 
series Healthcare in Focus and Healthcare Quarterly. 
To ensure the full benefits of those initiatives are realised, 
in 2022-23 the Bureau embedded its ongoing program of 
information sessions with hundreds of key representatives 
across NSW Health, with attendees shown how to access 
and use the data to drive improvements to health services.
Key achievements
•	Informed healthcare improvements by surveying more 
than 70,000 patients about their experiences with NSW 
public hospital and ambulance services, using advanced 
analytic methods to deliver high-value insights into health 
system performance.

performance information through ongoing digital 
improvements with a 9% increase in web visits, and a 63% 
increase in media mentions.
•	Improved timeliness of reporting on NSW Patient Survey 
Program results through innovations in sampling, data 
collection and delivery. The timelines for the Adult 
Admitted Patient Survey 2022 and Virtual Care Survey 
2022 were reduced by nine and 15 weeks respectively.
•	Increased awareness and use of Bureau of Health 
Information data to improve health services by presenting 
an ongoing program of information sessions to more than 
800 senior executives, health system managers and 
clinicians.
•	Delivered further insights into the performance of the 
health system during the pandemic by publishing 
Healthcare in Focus and four issues of Healthcare 
Quarterly, featuring detailed information about the activity 
and performance of NSW public hospital and ambulance 
services.

Year in review
The past year has been one of COVID-19 recovery for 
St Vincent’s Health Network Sydney.
Having wound down all of our COVID-19 testing sites and 
vaccination clinics, St Vincent’s achieved elective surgery 
access targets and delivered above 2018-19 activity levels 
by utilising contracted care models, increasing theatre 
capacity, developing 23-hour clinical pathways and utilising 
short stay models.
St Vincent’s led preparations and readiness for World Pride 
Sydney, with an estimated 78,000 tourists coming to 
Sydney, predominantly concentrated in Sydney’s inner city 
areas in close proximity to our health service. In response, 
we established the Pride Health Hub, providing free Mpox 
vaccinations, sexual health and HIV checks.
We were also formally recognised by NSW Health as a 
Health Innovation Precinct, and have commenced work to 
elevate the St Vincent’s Sydney Health Innovation 
Research Precinct in collaboration with our partners – St 
Vincent’s Clinic, St Vincent’s Private Hospital Sydney, the 
Garvan Institute of Medical Research and the Victor Chang 
Cardiac Research Institute, to the benefit of all Australians.
Key achievements
•	Opened a new state-of-the-art, hybrid trauma operating 
suite. The theatre houses the newest hybrid 
technologically available – Resuscitation with 
Angiography, Percutaneous Techniques and Operative 
Repair. The new theatre provides a one-stop-shop for 
treating the most critical trauma patients. 
•	Commenced a Mpox vaccination centre in response to the 
Communicable Disease Incident of National Significance 
as described by the Chief Medical Officer. 
•	Commenced a new Chronic Care Service for Aboriginal 
patients. The service supports Aboriginal patients living 
with chronic health issues, including cardiac disease, 
cancer, renal disease, diabetes and lung disease. 
Additionally, support is given to patients with other 
complex conditions affecting their health, including 
mental ill health, substance use and homelessness. 
•	Opened the Eating Disorders Outpatient Clinic to provide 
continuum of care for eating disordered patients upon 
discharge as well as people in the community who are 
not engaging with dedicated professional help for their 
disordered eating. 
•	Launched the inaugural St Vincent’s Sexuality and 
Gender Diversity Strategy for Continuous Improvement to 
deliver healthcare service that is driven by equity, and a 
sense of belonging for all sexuality and gender diverse 
people who come into our care, as well as our colleagues. 
•	Discovered the biomarker responsible for cognitive 
decline in patients with Long COVID. 
•	Commenced a Walk-in Home and Housing Clinic in 
partnership with local non-government organisation 
partners, Way2Home. The service which includes Peer 
Support Workers and Aboriginal Health Workers provides 
support with pathways to permanent housing, case 
management and general health support for people 
sleeping rough. 
•	Implemented a remote patient monitoring and electronic 
medication management system enabling Hospital in the 
Home to be fully digitalised, facilitating rapid responses 
to changing priorities, while maintaining patient and 
clinical safety. The improved data sharing and medication 
management, provided clinical decision support tailored 
to Hospital in the Home, flexibility to patient or nurse-
managed medication administration, and medication 
reconciliation. 
•	Conducted a major study detailing the impact of heat and 
hot weather on human health, particularly for older 
populations and for people sleeping rough. The published 
findings include practical strategies to mitigate the 
dangers of heat related presentations on our vulnerable 
communities.

Year in review
In November 2022, NSW Health Pathology marked 10 
years as a statewide service, providing vital public 
pathology and forensic services to the people of NSW.
Just months later, we said farewell to our respected and 
warmly regarded founding Chief Executive Tracey

More than 600 experts worked in 75 subgroups to 
standardise 38,979 items, with more to do.
•	Developed and launched Pathworks, a mobile app that 
gives clinicians secure, timely and convenient access to 
laboratory results via laptops and mobile devices. It was 
piloted at Royal North Shore Hospital, North Shore 
Private Hospital and Port Macquarie Hospital and will 
be deployed statewide.
	 Launched the Forensic Medicine Information System, a 
fully integrated single-source-of-truth to manage coronial 
and non-coronial referrals across Forensic Medicine sites.

Replacement Project. This capitalised on technological 
advances and supported a critical shift in policing 
strategies towards intelligence-led policing and crime 
disruption. 
•	Partnered with eHealth NSW, HealthShare NSW 
and Health Infrastructure NSW to launch the Health 
Prototyping Centre. Ideas, designs and concepts were 
tested before products were built. Anatomical 
Pathologists examined augmented reality for supervision 
in specimen cut-up.
•	Expanded technology and urine drug testing procedures 
to the Forensic and Analytical Science Service Drug 
Toxicology Unit to meet needs of expanded Drug Court 
NSW operation. Four liquid chromatography mass 
spectrometers capable of testing for up to 80 different

Year in review
eHealth NSW is dedicated to transforming care delivery 
and experiences across NSW Health by providing secure, 
modern digital systems and infrastructure. Working in 
partnership with local health districts, specialty health 
networks and NSW Health organisations remains a key 
tenet of our work. 
As we digitise healthcare, we all play a role in keeping our 
systems and information safe and secure. Non-technical 
measures, such as education, are critical. In February 2023 
eHealth NSW launched a new Cyber Security Awareness 
training module for all NSW Health staff. Technical 
measures, like MedSync, enable virtual clinical 
collaboration so clinicians can share clinical information 
and images securely. 
The Health Grade Enterprise Network new procurement 
approach for ICT networking infrastructure also 
strengthens virtual care capabilities. Our move to cloud 
adoption is delivering greater speed, and reliability to 
essential systems underpinning care delivery, such as 
cardiovascular imaging.
High-quality, integrated, accessible solutions promote 
digital system adoption. Involving consumers, our 
colleagues and industry partners is crucial in delivering 
systems that meet their needs and the needs of the health 
system. I’d like to thank everyone, including our staff, for 
their continued collaboration and efforts. 
Key achievements
•	Delivered the new NSW Health Enterprise Data Lake 
which is modernising the analytics capability and 
producing data-driven insights in NSW Health. The data 
lake consolidates data in near real-time, presenting a 
significant breakthrough for data science, machine 
learning, artificial intelligence and big data analytics. 
•	Progressed the Single Digital Patient Record program 
which will provide a secure, holistic, integrated view of the 
care a patient receives across the health system.
•	Continued work on the Health Grade Enterprise Network 
to deliver reliable, consistent and robust infrastructure to 
future-proof our hospitals.

across NSW Health facilities. This was a major milestone 
in the NSW Health Procurement Reform Program. 
SmartChain aims to simplify and digitise the source-to-
pay process.
•	Enabled online consent by parents and carers for school 
vaccinations through the Consent and Records 
Management for Immunisation system, which replaces 
the paper-based process. There were 106,503 online

healthcare innovation, services and solution 
improvements in partnership with NSW Health Pathology, 
HealthShare NSW and Health Infrastructure. 
•	Developed the MedSync platform to helps clinicians 
securely share clinical information, upload images and 
collaborate easily on the go. The platform was made 
available to more than 110,000 clinicians, supporting the 
delivery of virtual clinical collaboration across multiple 
settings statewide. 
•	Supported NSW Health staff 24 hours a day, seven days a 
week via the statewide Service Desk. Technical support 
was provided across more than 400 corporate and clinical 
applications. More than 500,000 calls for IT support were

Year in review
Central Coast Local Health District provided high-quality 
care to our community, working towards our vision of 
delivering exceptional and timely care in the right place, 
for every patient, every time. 
We launched our Central Coast Health Care at Home 
program, a partnership with general practitioners, the 
Primary Health Network, residential aged care facilities 
and NSW Ambulance, to support people to receive care 
from community-based services as an alternative to 
hospital, where it is safe to do so. 
Providing virtual care, aged care and a medically-led 
hospital in the home model, the program is delivering care 
where people need it while helping to free up capacity in 
our hospitals. 
Our focus on timely access to care led to reduced wait 
times and meant that all of our patients had their planned 
surgery within the recommended timeframes for NSW. 
Our staff continued to develop new ways to improve the 
patient experience and the care we provide, and we 
celebrated some of these outstanding achievements 
by our staff at our Caring for the Coast Awards night. 
A new approach to recruitment supported hiring managers 
in finding and retaining candidates, while wellbeing, peer 
support and mentoring programs were introduced to 
support and engage staff. 
We thank our teams for their outstanding efforts, 
commitment and dedication.
Key achievements
•	Implemented a range of pharmacy initiatives, including 
the NSW Medicines Formulary improving patient safety 
and achieving cost savings. 
•	Commissioned a new magnetic resonance imaging as 
part of the Wyong Hospital redevelopment and

Year in review
The focus for Far West Local Health District in 2022-23 
was consolidating relationships and partnerships with 
internal and external stakeholders. In doing so, we have 
been able to provide increased services and staff 
development across the district.
The unique landscape in the Far West is host to some of 
the biggest outback festivals from the three-day Broken 
Heel Festival showcasing drag and disco to the red earth 
of the Mundi Mundi Bash – a remote three-day music and 
camping event showcasing some of the world’s greatest 
artists. Our staff as part of their communities work as 
volunteers and professionals to support these great events 
and promote the communities. 
The district has established two community advisory 
committees, the Carer Advisory Committee, and the Youth 
Health Advisory Committee. The committees will work in 
collaboration with district in a co-design model, providing a 
pathway for carers and young people to be a part of 
resource development, project planning and evaluating, 
and policy review. 
We continued our focus on our people and capabilities. 
A key achievement during the year was the 
commencement of the inaugural partnership with 
Australasian College of Health Service Management 
Health Management Internship Program. The program 
offers committed, high-potential interns the opportunity 
to develop the skills, capabilities and knowledge required 
to start a career in managing the challenges and 
complexities of health service delivery across the district.
The district has worked together to ensure excellence in 
rural and remote healthcare was delivered to all our 
communities across Far West. 
Key achievements
•	Implemented My Emergency Doctor virtual medical 
services in the Broken Hill Emergency Department, 
Balranald Emergency Department and in Broken Hill 
community-based services such as Integrated Care and 
Community Nursing. The virtual medical service was 
tailored to non-urgent patient categories and in response 
to improve access of general practitioner service and 
primary healthcare. My Emergency Doctor is a telehealth 
model of care available to consumers. 
•	Hosted the Aboriginal Mental Health and Wellbeing 
Forum. With the theme of Tune into Country, the forum 
was well attended by people from across NSW. Day one 
was a full day of presentations, including from our first 
Aboriginal Trainee in the Violence, Abuse and Neglect 
Service NSW - Safe Wayz Clinician Violence, Abuse and 
Neglect Service.
•	Completed the master planning phase of the $10 million 
Broken Hill Hospital’s emergency department upgrade.
•	Based in Broken Hill, Rebecca Smith, Manager of 
integrated care for the district was awarded the Allied 
Health Leader of the Year at the 2022 NSW Health 
Excellence in Allied Health Awards. 
•	The release of the Safety and Quality Newsletter by the 
Clinical Governance Unit has successfully engaged 
healthcare professionals on patient safety and quality 
care, and empowered people to uphold the highest 
standards of patient care.
•	The district has developed and implemented the Far West 
LHD Nursing and Midwifery Career Pathways Guideline. 
The pathways encompass tertiary qualifications with 
contextualised pathways linked to the NSW Health 
Workforce Plan 2022-2032, and other key workforce plans. 
The Career Pathways Guideline addresses the individual’s 
career aspirations and requirements, to achieve their 
professional goals, while being supported holistically 
in our district. 
•	October 2022 marked the unveiling of the concept design 
of the Wentworth Health Service redevelopment, which 
showcased the plans for the new hospital’s construction. 
•	The dedication to improving alcohol and other drug 
services was evident through increased investment from 
the Special Commission of Inquiry into the Drug 'Ice' 
Report. This funding allowed for the expansion of alcohol 
and other drug teams, particularly in the vital area of 
youth services, resulting in improved support and 
expertise for those in need.
•	Virtual Nurse Assist is a very exciting new telehealth 
project implemented in collaboration with Sydney Local 
Health District this year. A highly skilled clinical nurse 
consultant provides virtual support to frontline nurses in 
the district who call a central number from any of the 
remote facilities in the Far West. The use of cameras and 
speakers in the room assists the virtual consultant to be 
able to see everything that is happening and the patient 
can be introduced to them as if they are in the room. 
•	Far West continues to maintain a high level of excellence 
in specialist palliative care service provision, with 98% of 
patients known to specialist palliative care dying in their 
preferred place. Palliative care funded refurbishments 
have occurred in Wilcannia and Balranald Multipurpose 
Services to ensure a room with a more home-like 
environment is available for palliative care patients and 
their families.

This included ongoing enhancements to our virtual care 
capability and how we work with residential aged care 
facility providers to better support timely discharge for 
older patients who no longer need hospital-based care.
Learnings from our COVID-19 response have continued 
to inform service improvements, including the development 
and implementation of automated epidemiological 
reporting, upgrades to data and analytics platforms and 
e-waste reduction strategies to better support our digital 
systems.
Our pledge to Close the Gap for our Aboriginal 
communities was reconfirmed this year with the signing 
of a new Statement of Commitment to Aboriginal Health. 
We commenced the development of the Aboriginal Mental 
Health Implementation Plan and have progressed plans

refurbishment of the Cardiology Unit.
Key achievements
•	Significantly increased capacity to deliver virtual-based 
healthcare, including the establishment of a virtual 
hospital ward to enable post-discharge care in the home 
for almost 1,000 patients. The district has also enabled 
150 clinical services to provide virtual consultation, review 
and care management for patients in rural and regional 
areas. 
•	Recognised by the Clinical Excellence Commission as one 
of the first NSW Health entities to deliver the inaugural 
Adept Applied Safety and Quality Program, aimed at 
developing capability to lead local safety and quality 
improvements. More than 20 participants graduated from 
the first cohort in the district. 
•	Implemented a nurse practitioner-led model of care at the 
Bulli Urgent Care Centre, better supporting a growing 
number of patients with lower acuity conditions. This has 
enabled the facility to treat twice as many presentations 
at Bulli compared to the previous year, while supporting 
the nearby Wollongong Emergency Department to better 
manage more serious and emergency presentations. 
•	Established a program to enable patients to leave hospital 
sooner following joint replacement surgery. At

our approach to providing multidisciplinary care for people 
living with chronic disease.
With a focus on growing our own workforce, we have 
developed end-to-end training pathways for doctors and 
nurses, creating innovative pathways for local people to 
train and grow careers within our region. 
Major capital projects across the district have reached 
important milestones, including the completion of the

Year in review
Our collaboration with patients, consumers, staff and 
stakeholders this year continues a long-standing tradition 
of working with our communities to help shape and deliver 
services. 
This year we actively engaged consumer and patient 
groups to collaboratively address challenges and gaps in

past year, and it was exciting to see the 2022 Wellbeing 
Grants come to life.
The district has always taken a strong stand on Closing the

part in cultural ceremonies, song, dance and yarning.
Our redevelopment teams continue to do terrific work as 
our expansive new hospitals move from plans to reality.

As well as forging ahead with new services and buildings, 
making sure everyone has access to excellent healthcare, 
no matter what their background, is a bedrock of the 
district.
We are renowned for the way we care for communities well 
beyond our hospital wards. This was exemplified when we 
stepped in to help residents evacuate from their homes

Key achievements
•	Prince of Wales Hospital Acute Services Building opened 
its doors to the public after more than seven years of 
design consultation, construction, planning and 
commissioning. The Acute Services Building will enhance 
the patient experience through new and improved 
technology, intuitive way finding and bright, open spaces.
•	A surgical team at the Royal Hospital for Women became 
the first in Australia to perform a uterus transplant as part 
of a ground-breaking research trial. 
•	Staff celebrated, created awareness, and kept thousands 
of people safe and healthy during Sydney World Pride. 
Our Crown Street vaccination clinic was transformed into 
a temporary preventative health hub providing a range of 
free services such as STI and HIV tests.
•	The Mental Health Virtual Centre was launched. This new 
site brings together a number of diverse mental health 
services, providing consumers with different options for 
their care, including virtual clinical services, face-to-face 
and online recovery education, physical health group 
programs and after-hours suicide crisis support.
•	Researchers at the Royal Hospital for Women made a 
major breakthrough in the future diagnosis and treatment 
of endometriosis. In a world first, the team successfully 
grew tissue from all known types of endometriosis in a 
laboratory, allowing researchers to observe cell changes 
and compare how different tissue responds to different 
treatments.
•	The NSW Telestroke Service reached an exciting 
milestone, treating more than 3,000 stroke victims across 
rural and regional NSW. The service is hosted by Prince of 
Wales Hospital and connects local doctors with 
specialised stroke physicians located hundreds of 
kilometres away in major hospitals via video consultations.
•	Sutherland Hospital's magnetic resonance imaging 
service officially opened. The state-of-the-art facility was 
delivered as part of the hospital's Operating Theatre 
Complex redevelopment. The service has enabled faster 
care for inpatients as fewer need to be transferred to St 
George Hospital or private providers for their scans.
•	The Festival of Care – an initiative designed to bring 
entertainment, joy and a sense of calm – launched at our 
hospitals.
•	The opening of the children’s playground and garden at 
St George Hospital completed a series of projects to 
transform various areas of the paediatric ward. The space 
was transformed in 2022 from a grant received from the 
Department of Infrastructure in collaboration with the 
Rotary Club of Hurstville. The project included a 
playroom, parents retreat and alfresco pirate ship 
playground in the children’s ward. The garden provides 
patients, visitors, and staff a space to sit and enjoy the 
outdoors.
•	The Kirketon Road Centre collaborated with Uniting to 
open a free clinic in Kings Cross, providing high-quality, 
compassionate medical care to people who use drugs. 
The service is an opportunity to integrate clinical, social 
and harm reduction services for clients who have 
difficulty accessing medical care.

Year in review
The vibrant and diverse communities across South Western 
Sydney are one of our region’s greatest strengths. 
From Traditional Owners to people who have made the South 
West home, we have a wealth of diversity accessing our 
health services. We also have local cultural knowledge and 
experience to draw on from communities and our staff. 
During 2022-23, our focus was reinforcing our ties to those 
communities, ensuring we take the time to understand their 
different perspectives and health needs to adjust our models 
of care and tailor our services. 
We formed the South West Sydney Multicultural 
Partnership in 2022. It aims to create better health 
outcomes and experiences for multicultural communities 
with formalised collaborations between the district and 
local multicultural organisations.
Our Aboriginal Health Services have established deep 
partnerships with local Aboriginal organisations, whose 
expertise in health and culture enable the delivery of 
culturally responsive care. 
We launched the South Western Sydney Local Health District 
Strategic Plan 2022-2027 Framework to reach our vision of 
leading safe, sustainable care for healthier communities. 
Key to our success will be to deepening engagement with the 
people of South Western Sydney, listening to their needs and 
co-designing care to support their health and wellbeing.

Year in review
This year, Sydney Local Health District’s culture of 
discovery has driven incredible advances in practice, 
research and new models of care for our patients and their 
loved ones. I am incredibly proud of the way our staff and 
services have emerged from the intensive pandemic 
response period to innovate services and apply learnings, 
to care for our communities. 
We have cared for 1.5 million people in our outpatient 
services, and a further 81,900 patients treated with 
COVID-19. Almost 176,500 people attended our emergency 
departments, with 43,650 arriving by ambulance. There 
were more than 163,460 admissions and discharges at our 
hospitals and almost 43,160 operations were performed in 
our hospitals and through collaborative care arrangements. 
Close to 5,000 babies were born at Royal Prince Alfred 
Hospital and Canterbury Hospital.
Our services in our communities have continued to deliver 
excellent care close to people’s homes, working in 
partnership with community to keep people healthy. We 
turned the district rainbow during Sydney WorldPride, 
highlighting our commitment to equity and inclusion. Our 
district achieved the highest results in NSW Health across 
every theme in the People Matter Employee Survey 
highlighting culture and engagement. 
I would like to thank everyone who supports our work to 
make a difference for our community. Sydney Local Health 
District is Ngurang Dali Mana Burudi, ‘a place to get better’.

Year in review
The Western NSW Local Health District has a proud 
tradition of innovation and agility in providing healthcare to 
some of the most geographically and demographically 
diverse populations in the state. 
This year, that spirit of innovation was demonstrated in key 
undertakings that support both our workforce and the 
health of our communities. 
We developed a comprehensive people strategy containing 
a range of initiatives to grow and support our workforce. 
We also laid the groundwork for more meaningful 
relationships between our network of services and the 
communities they provide care to. 
We also continued to take the best advantage of 
technology to support care both at the bedside and 
virtually into hospitals and homes. 
While innovation takes us forward, so too does the spirit of 
our people. In 2022-23, some of our communities were 
devastated by natural disasters. In response, we witnessed 
acts of bravery, kindness and generosity that are truly 
exceptional. In many cases, along with other emergency 
services, our healthcare teams – all too often the victims of 
these events themselves – showed themselves again to be 
at the heart of their community.
Key achievements

Simulation centre at Wellington, providing state-of-the-art 
classroom learning and simulated ward training to 
support the expansion of the clinical workforce in size 
and capability.

impactful delivery, innovatively supporting patients, 
carers and staff.
In 2023, the completion of the Westmead Hospital 
Mother Baby Unit marked a milestone in maternal and 
infant care, designed with a focus on preserving the 
parent-infant relationship. 
The implementation of a remote monitoring solution for 
cardiotocography traces and the introduction of the 
Westmead Emergency Department Tap-on/Tap-off Pilot 
further improved healthcare efficiency. 
Supportive and palliative care unit at Auburn Hospital 
provided tailored care for patients with life-limiting 
illnesses, considering diverse cultural and religious needs. 
The GradStart Program supported 520 new graduate 
nurses and midwives, reducing the district's vacancy rate 
and fostering a supportive learning environment. 
Hospital in the Home in Integrated and Community Health 
tripled in size in the past 12 months, reaching its target of 
100 in-patient acute beds in the home on 30 June 2023. 
Digital enablement, strong clinician and executive 
engagement, remodelling of governance and a complete 
cultural focus on quality and safety right across the team has 
led to more patients being able to be treated in their home.

age, compared with 94.3% in 2021–22. 
Adults aged 65 years and over vaccinated 
against influenza in the last 12 months 
From 1 March 2023 (when the 2023 influenza vaccine became 
available) until 30 June 2023, 58.5% of people aged 65 and 
over received an influenza vaccine, compared to 61.8% of 
Aboriginal people in this age group. Overall, influenza vaccine 
coverage in NSW was 28.2% compared to 34.8% at the 
same time the previous year. 
Smoking
Tobacco use is the leading contributor to the burden of illness and 
deaths in Australia. Australia has one of the most comprehensive 
tobacco control policies and programs in the world, which aims 
to continue reducing smoking prevalence in the community.

There has been a long-term reduction in current (daily or occasional) 
smoking over the last 20 years, with 11% of people aged 16 years 
and over in NSW reporting current (either daily or occasional) 
smoking in 2022, down from 23% in 2003.
Over the last 20 years, the trend in current smoking has also 
declined for Aboriginal people aged 16 years and over, from 
45% in 2003 to 29% in 2022. This decline has fluctuated from 
year to year due to small Aboriginal population samples, and the 
error margins are wide.

In NSW in the combined years 2021–2022, an estimated 17% 
of young adults aged 16–24 years and 10% aged 25–34 years were 
current (daily or occasional) users of e-cigarettes. This was a 
significant increase from the 2019–20 period where 4.5% of young 
adults aged 16–24 years and 2.9% aged 25–34 years were current 
e-cigarette users.
E-cigarettes (or vapes) are battery operated devices that heat a 
liquid (also known as e-liquid) to produce a vapour that users inhale. 
E-cigarettes are known to be harmful, especially for young people. 
Liquids in e-cigarettes have been found to contain chemicals 
such as formaldehyde, heavy metals, solvents and volatile 
compounds. Potential harms of vaping include nicotine addiction, 
nicotine poisoning, throat irritation, breathlessness, coughing, 
dizziness, headaches, nausea, and lung damage.

In 2022, 91% of total mothers in NSW did not smoke during 
pregnancy. There has been a long-term decline in mothers who 
smoked at all during pregnancy over the last 20 years, with just 
under 8% of total mothers in NSW reporting smoking during 
pregnancy in 2022, down from 15% in 2003. 
Among Aboriginal mothers in 2022 in NSW, 60% did not smoke 
during pregnancy. Over the last 20 years, the trend in smoking 
during pregnancy declined at a faster rate for Aboriginal mothers, 
from 57% in 2003 to 40% in 2022. 
Smoking during pregnancy is associated with a wide range of 
complications impacting both mother and baby.

In NSW in 2022, 44% of women were a healthy weight compared 
to 35% of men. Over the 10 years between 2013 and 2022, 
the rate of healthy weight in adults aged 16 years and over 
gradually decreased from 45% to 39%. 
The growing number of people above a healthy weight is a 
significant public health concern in NSW and across Australia. 
Increasing weight, above a healthy weight, increases the risk 
of developing serious chronic health conditions such as diabetes 
and heart disease.

In 2022 in NSW, 27% of adults aged over 16 years (36% of men 
and 19% of women) consumed more than four standard alcoholic 
drinks on at least one occasion in the previous four weeks, posing a 
short-term risk to their health. Alcohol consumption at levels that 
pose a short-term health risk has been stable over the seven years 
between 2016 and 2022 in NSW.
Alcohol use is the leading contributor to the burden of illness and 
deaths in Australia for people aged up to 44 years and the fifth 
overall contributor to total burden of disease and illness for all ages.

Among Aboriginal adults aged over 16 years in NSW in 2021–22, 
31% reported that they never drank alcohol, an increase from 
2017–18 of 26%. The fluctuation is likely due to sample size and

The infant mortality rate is the number of infant deaths 
(up to one year of age) per 1,000 births. 
In the combined years 2019–21, the infant mortality rate among 
all infants in NSW was 3.3 per 1,000 births, which has declined from 
4.8 per 1,000 births in 2001–03. 
The mortality rate for Aboriginal infants in NSW in 2019–21 was 
3.8 per 1,000 births. This rate has more than halved from 8.6 per 
1,000 births in 2001–03. 
The mortality rate among Aboriginal infants in NSW is lower than 
in other Australian states and territories. In the combined years 
2019–2021, the infant mortality rate for all Aboriginal infants in 
Australia was 4.9 per 1,000 births compared with a rate of 3.8 for 
Aboriginal infants in NSW.

Healthy birth weight is an important indicator of an infant’s future 
health and is defined as babies who weighed between 2,500 and 
4,499 grams at birth. Based on the National Agreement on Closing 
the Gap, this indicator tracks the progress on the outcome 
“Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander children are born healthy and 
strong”. The target is that the proportion of Aboriginal and Torres 
Strait Islander babies with a healthy birth weight will increase to 
91% by 2031.
In 2022, 94% of total babies in NSW were born with a healthy birth 
weight. This percentage has been stable for the 10 years since 2013.
Among Aboriginal babies in NSW, just under 91% were born with a 
healthy birth weight, which has also been stable since 2013.

in a timely and clinically appropriate manner. Despite additional 
clinical protocols brought on by the COVID-19 pandemic, 57.7% 
of patients who presented to a NSW emergency department left 
within four hours following treatment, a small reduction on the

The NSW Public Sector Aboriginal Employment Strategy 2014–17 
introduced an aspirational target of 1.8% by 2021 for each of the 
sector’s salary bands. If the aspirational target of 1.8% is achieved 
in salary bands not currently at or above 1.8%, the cumulative 
representation of Aboriginal employees in the sector is expected 
to reach 3.3% (original overall target is 2.6%).
Staff turnover 	
The desired outcome is to have turnover rates within 
acceptable limits to ensure system stability. As at June 
2023, the staff turnover rate was 13.1% a reduction of 
0.8%. These higher than usual turnover rates are primarily 
attributed to changes in service delivery as pandemic 
responses are brought back into line with normal activity.

Key policies 2022–23
Employee Assistance Programs 
(PD2022_048)
This Policy Directive outlines standards for Employee 
Assistance Programs (EAPs) to ensure employees have 
access to effective assistance services. The Ministry 
has also developed a Mental Health and Wellbeing 
Framework intended to provide strategic direction for the 
creation of psychologically safe workplaces where 
psychosocial risks are identified, eliminated or controlled. 
Work has commenced on an action plan to ensure the 
implementation of the Framework.
Fatigue Management in NSW Health 
workplaces (GL2023_012)
This Guideline provides a risk management approach for 
managing work related fatigue. It includes guidance on 
identifying areas at increased risk for work-related fatigue, 
assessing the Work Health and Safety related issues and 
providing strategies to eliminate work related fatigue as 
much as possible or to minimise its impact where it cannot 
be eliminated.
Leave Matters for the NSW Health Service 
(PD2022_006)
This policy summarises leave entitlements, administration 
and management for employees of the NSW Health 
service. The policy directive was reviewed and reissued in 
February 2023 to reflect enhanced leave provisions for 
parental leave and leave to support employees 
experiencing domestic and family violence. 
Work Health and Safety Audits (PD2023_010)
This Policy sets out the requirement for NSW Health 
organisations to undertake work health and safety 
(WHS) audits. Audits are conducted to determine the 
effectiveness of management systems, to identify the 
strengths and opportunities for improvements and to 
ensure compliance with the WHS legislation and NSW 
Health policies and procedures. This Policy provides a 
consistent, effective approach for gathering information 
on which a NSW Health organisation can plan and 
implement WHS improvements.

The overall increase in workers compensation claims recorded for 2022–23 was largely attributable to COVID-19 related 
claims (biological factors). Claims relating to mental stress, body stressing, hitting objects with a part of the body, 
chemicals/other substances, heat/electricity and other environment factors were reduced for 2022–23.

Award changes and industrial relations claims
Wage increases for NSW Health staff
The Ministry conducted all industrial negotiations under 
the provisions of the NSW Public Sector Wages Policy 
2022. The negotiations resulted in a 3% remuneration 
increase (including superannuation) for NSW Health 
service employees for the period 1 July 2022 to 30 June 
2023. The NSW Government also provided a one-off 
payment of up to $3,000 for NSW Health employees in 
recognition of their work during the COVID-19 pandemic. 
On 5 June 2023, the NSW Government announced a 
new fair pay policy providing a 4% remuneration increase 
and a 0.5% increase to superannuation from 1 July 2023. 
The Ministry commenced industrial negotiations under 
the new policy for 2023–24 with the relevant industrial 
organisations that cover NSW Health employees. 
Introduction of safe staffing levels
On 27 April 2023, the Government announced the 
establishment of the Safe Staffing Level Taskforce to 
implement its election commitment of “minimum and 
enforceable safe staffing levels” in public hospitals. 
The commitment extends to current nursing hours per 
patient day wards, emergency departments, intensive 
care units, multipurpose services, and maternity services.
Claim at the NSW Supreme Court for alleged 
breaches to Nursing Hours Per Patient Day
The NSW Nurses and Midwives’ Association filed a 
statement of claim in the Supreme Court relating to 
alleged breaches of Nursing Hours Per Patient Day 
during the period January 2019 to October 2022. 
The parties are in the process of filing evidence and 
submissions for the Court to consider.
Determination to recognise prior 
service for Aboriginal Health Workers
On 31 January 2023, the NSW Ministry of Health issued a 
Determination to enable the recognition of relevant prior 
service in setting the commencement rate of pay for staff 
appointed to NSW Health in the classification of 
Aboriginal Health Worker. 
This Determination was specifically developed to support 
the recruitment of staff to this classification and to assist 
in attracting suitably experienced people by enabling 
their relevant employment history to be considered when 
setting their commencement rate of pay. 
Claims in the Supreme Court of 
NSW for alleged non-compliance 
with the Medical Officers Award
A representative proceeding has been brought against 
the State of NSW for alleged underpayment of junior 
medical officers in breach of the Public Hospitals Medical 
Officers (State) Award. A separate proceeding has been 
commenced by the Australian Salaried Medical Officers 
Federation (NSW) (ASMOF) on behalf of specified 
employees under the Industrial Relations Act 1996 (NSW). 
There is substantial overlap in the issues raised in the two 
proceedings. The Court has set the matters down for an 
initial hearing in May 2024 of the claim of the lead plaintiff 
in the representative proceeding and a single specified 
employee in the ASMOF proceeding.
Staff Specialist Award Variation 
NSW Health has submitted an application to the Industrial 
Relations Commission to vary the Staff Specialists (State) 
Award. ASMOF will submit a counter variation then the 
parties will prepare evidence with the matter likely to be 
heard in the Commission in 2024.
Dispute in the Industrial Relations 
Commission concerning the Public 
Hospital Medical Officers Award
ASMOF submitted a Dispute Notification on 12 December 
2019 in the Industrial Relations Commission (IRC) in 
relation to the definition of a registrar. The matter 
is ready to proceed to hearing but the parties are seeking 
to resolve the matter via conciliation. The matter is next 
listed for report back on 11 March 2024.

Note: 1. Data sourced from Health Information Exchange (HIE). The number of separations include care type changes. 2. Activity includes 
services contracted to private sector. Data reported are as at 16/09/2023. 3. Acute average length of stay = (Acute bed days/Acute 
separations). 4. Daily average of inpatients = Total Bed Days/365. 5. Bed occupancy rate is based on June data only. Northern beaches 
hospital is not available due to missing available beds. Facilities with peer groups other than A1 to C2 are excluded. The following bed types 
are excluded from all occupancy rate calculations: emergency departments, delivery suites, operating theatres, hospital in the home, 
recovery wards, residential aged care, community residential and respite activity. 6. Acute activity is defined by a service category of acute 
or newborn. Results for Acute separations and bed days from 2018–19 onwards may not be directly comparable to previous years due to the 
impact of the implementation of the Mental Health Care Type classification. 7. Service events measured from aggregate of patient level and 
summary data submissions for each non admitted service/clinic. Pathology services are not included. Data for previous years is not 
comparable. 8. Rounding of numbers to the nearest whole number in this table may cause minor differences in totals.Data as at 16/9/23.

Appendix 4
Mental Health
Section 108 of the NSW Mental Health Act 2007 
In accordance with Section 108 of the NSW Mental Health 
Act (2007) the tables presented here provides an overview 
of mental health activities and performance in mental 
health public hospitals for 2022–23 in relation to:
a)	 
achievements during the reporting period in mental 
health service performance
b)	 
data relating to the utilisation of mental health 
resources.
Table 1 provides data against a set of measures for 
hospital activities related to bed utilisation (availability 
and occupancy of beds), hospital separations (same day 
and overnight), and community contacts. Activity measure 
is based on all acute, sub-acute and non-acute mental 
health facilities.
Table 2 provides rates for three national key performance 
indicators (KPIs). These indicators measure effectiveness 
(28 days readmission rate), appropriateness (seclusion 
rate, duration, and frequency) and continuity (seven days 
post discharge community care) of care in acute mental 
health services.
Table 1 includes indicators only for services directly 
funded through the Mental Health program. National 
reports on mental health also include data from a small 
number of services funded by other funding programs 
(e.g., Primary Care, Rehabilitation and Aged Care). 
Therefore, the numbers reported here may differ from 
those in national reports (e.g., Report on Government 
Services, Mental Health Services in Australia, National 
Mental Health Report).

Definitions: 1. “Average Available beds” are the average of 365 nightly census counts. This data is extracted from the Bed Reporting 
System by System Information and Analytics (SIA) Branch, NSW Health. An available bed is one that is staffed, open and available for 
admission of a patient. 2. “Average occupied beds” are calculated from the total Occupied Overnight Bed Days for the year. Higher numbers 
of occupied beds than available can sometimes be reported due to use of surge beds to cope with high demands. 1,2. Components may not 
add to total in NSW due to rounding error. 3. “Same-day Separations” are those where the hospital episode begins and ends on the same 
day. 4. “Overnight Separations” are episodes of hospital care where the person stays at least one night in hospital, and are concluded by 
discharged, death, transfer to another hospital or change to a different type of care at the same hospital. 5. Ambulatory mental health care 
includes all care provided by specialist mental health services for people who are not inpatients of mental health units at the time of care. 
6. Revised ambulatory contacts, NSW 2021–2022.

Activity Based Funding (ABF)
Activity Based Funding is a management 
tool which helps plan and assess 
performance and clinical needs as part of 
the approach to the funding, purchasing and 
performance of health services. Activity 
Based Funding helps make public health 
funding more effective because health 
service management can allocate their 
share of available state and Commonwealth 
funding based on real levels of patient care. 
The Activity Based Funding tool allows 
public health planners, administrators, 
consumers and clinicians to see how and 
where taxpayer funding is being allocated.
