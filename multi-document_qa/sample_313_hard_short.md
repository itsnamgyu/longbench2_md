# Question

# Choices

- A: PRISM characterizes the evaluation task as a text rephrasing exercise, requiring both texts to express identical meanings, BartScore   recharacterizes the evaluation task as the generation of text.
- B: PRISM builds its model from the ground up using parallel datasets. Conversely, BartScore leverages open-source pre-trained sequence-to-sequence (seq2seq) models.
- C: BARTSCORE accommodates prompt-based learning techniques, while PRISM does not.
- D: BARTSCORE uses the token level generation probability of the model for evaluation, while PRISM uses the comparison of x and y probabilities for evaluation.

# Answer

D
