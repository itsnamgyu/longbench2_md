REPORT BY THE SUPERVISORY BOARD 
DEAR SHAREHOLDERS, 
In a transition year for our industry, characterized by a challenging market environment, geopolitical con-
flict, macroeconomic headwinds and currency volatility, the PUMA Group sustained its strong momentum, 
gained market shares and delivered a profitability fully in line with its outlook.

Product Officer, Anne-Laure Descours as Chief Sourcing Officer and Hubert Hinterseher as Chief Financial 
Officer, started to build a foundation for the future growth of the company with the strategic priorities of ele-
vating the brand, increasing product excellence, and improving the distribution quality. Within that strategic 
framework, PUMA put a special focus on the important US and China markets. As the Supervisory Board, 
we are convinced that these are the right priorities to ensure not only sustainable but also more profitable

right track. We are particularly pleased to see that the Management Board acts as a team and that this team 
spirit not only motivates employees but is also recognized and appreciated by external stakeholders. We are 
also proud of the progress PUMA has made on its sustainability journey. Making our supply chains fair and 
sustainable has always been a matter close to PUMA's heart and we want to remain one of the leading 
brands in the industry. The topic will also have a strong influence on the work of the Supervisory Board in 
the future, which is why we are striving for further professionalization in this area.  
Another focus of the Supervisory Board's work was resolving the unfavourable YRWLQJUHVXOWVDWWKH“ú“ö“ú“ù$Q-

of further professionalizing its own work and strengthening the diversity concept of the Supervisory Board. 
Especially, increasing independence at the Supervisory Board is our top priority going forward. The Supervi-
sory Board decided to actively engage with some of the Company‚Äôs largest investors and conduct a Govern-
ance Roadshow for the first time. In these conversations, I received valuable feedback which will shape the

Annual Financial Report. Until Thore‚Äôs resignation becomes effective, he continues to contribute his exten-
sive knowledge and many years of experience as a member of the Audit Committee for the benefit of PUMA 
with great commitment. As a consequence, there will be two new vacancies on the Supervisory Board that 
need to be filled. To find the right candidates, the Supervisory Board has assigned the search to a leading 
global executive search consulting company. The search will focus on profiles with expertise in the areas of 
sustainability and retail and will comply with the required independence by investors. With this step, the Su-
pervisory Board aims to strengthen the structure of the Board, both in terms of skills and independence. A 
particular effort will be made in the next years to ensure that the chair of the Personnel Committee, who is 
in charge of remuneration topics, of the Nominating Committee and of the Audit Committee as well as the 
majority of the members of those Committees, are independent. 
At the last Annual General Meeting, the majority of our shareholders present voted against the proposed 
remuneration report. We have taken these voting results on the remuneration report very seriously and I am 
addressing them in the introduction to the remuneration report (see https://about.puma.com/en under In-
vestor Relations/Corporate Governance). Following the feedback that emerged during the engagement with 
the investors regarding the remuneration system, we are taking steps to review the remuneration system in

General Meeting for approval.  
Although the current share price performance is not in line with our and your expectations, I am convinced 
that it does neither reflect the actual value of our company nor the good operating performance. The Super-
visory Board and the Management Board anticipate that the current challenging market environment is 
temporary and are confident that the long-term prospects of the company based on its strong brand, strong 
product, strong partnerships and strong team will lead to a sustainable growth.  
The Supervisory Board would like to thank PUMA‚Äôs Management Board, Leadership Team and the entire

corporate development and corporate planning, the Company‚Äôs economic situation, including its net assets, 
financial position and results of operations, the adequacy of capital resources and all key decisions for the

manner in written and verbal form about the implementation of all decisions and about all major business 
transactions. The members of the Management Board took part in meetings of the Supervisory Board and 
its committees; the Supervisory Board also met regularly without the Management Board.

The Supervisory Board discussed in detail all of the Company‚Äôs key business transactions, based on the re-
ports by the Management Board and the Committees, and presented its own ideas. The Management Board 
provided the Supervisory Board with detailed information on any deviations of the business performance 
from the budgeted figures, both in writing and orally. The Supervisory Board verified these explanations us-
ing the supporting documents, which were always submitted in appropriate time before the meetings. The 
Supervisory Board was involved in all key decisions at an early stage. In addition, the Chair of the Supervi-
sory Board maintained, and continues to maintain, regular verbal or written contact with the CEO and keeps 
herself informed of all major developments. Overall, these discussions did not give any indication that the 
Management Board was managing the Group in anything other than a lawful and proper manner. 
The Supervisory Board members took part, on their own initiative, in the educational and training measures 
necessary for the performance of their duties. The Company supports the Supervisory Board members in 
their training activities, for example by having the Legal Department regularly prepare changes in the legal

responsible for monitoring the accounting process, the effectiveness of the internal control system, the risk 
management system, the internal audit system, compliance and the statutory audit of the financial state-
ments, with particular regard to the process of selecting an auditor. The Audit Committee is also responsi-
ble for conducting the selection process of the auditor. In addition, the Audit Committee monitors the inde-
pendence of the auditor and ensures that the non-audit services of the auditor commissioned by the Man-
agement Board do not give rise to any grounds for disqualification or partiality or any threat to independ-
ence. The Audit Committee issues the audit mandate on behalf of the Supervisory Board to the auditor 
elected by the general meeting, determines the audit areas of the audit, monitors the quality of the audit 
and the services additionally provided by the auditor and agrees the fee with the auditor. Heads of the corpo-
rate functions were also available for reports and questions on individual agenda items at the committee 
meetings. The Audit Committee meets regularly with the auditor, also without the Management Board.

OUR PEOPLE* 
Our PUMA Family is the key to our success. Our people strategy is the foundation of PUMA‚Äôs unique work 
environment and corporate culture, which helps us attract the world‚Äôs best talent and shapes the future 
success of the company. Our people strategy is centred on three main pillars: People First, Sustainable 
People Practices and Digitalisation. 
People First means understanding employees' needs, values, and potential of our employees and putting 
them at the centre of our decision making. That helps us create an inclusive culture that respects diversity, 
promotes health and well-being, and encourages personal and professional growth.  
Sustainable people practices create a workplace culture that prioritises employee health and happiness, 
diversity, and inclusivity, and offers ample opportunities for career growth. Our sustainable people practices 
are central to building a resilient organisation. By thinking ahead and equipping our employees with the 
future skills and leadership qualities necessary, we ensure the long-term success of PUMA.  
Digital tools in Human Resources improve work experience and help us stay competitive and agile in the 
fast-changing business landscape. By using digital technology, we are improving efficiency, data-driven 
decision-making, candidate and employee experiences. We deploy easy-to-use digital tools that enhance 
collaboration and productivity and offer digital literacy programs to ensure all employees are equipped to 
thrive in a digital environment. 
Putting the human element first ensures that our pursuit of environmental and technological excellence is 
responsible and rewarding. The result is a sustainable future where innovation and well-being go hand in hand. 
 
PUMA LIFE CYCLE 
RECRUITING/ONBOARDING 
People are our most valuable asset. We adopt a data-driven approach to talent acquisition to ensure that 
PUMA remains the employer of choice in the minds of external applicants. We analyse previous trends in 
recruitment, identify the primary source of talent inflow, and tailor our talent acquisition approach accordingly. 
To complement our goal, we employ digital platforms, social media, and the PUMA career website to 
engage with talent around the world.  
To ensure a continuous talent pipeline, we cultivate links with universities through career events, company 
lectures and master classes. We also regularly participate in external professional events, panel 
discussions, and seminars to build a solid talent network. 
Over the past two years, we have fostered a deeper relationship with candidates by offering them the chance 
to participate in unique PUMA digital events. These events allowed candidates to speak with top officials at 
PUMA and offer suggestions on how to improve the brand. 
Our onboarding process should not only provide the new starters with a great first day experience but also 
guarantee that they will work effectively and feel a member of the PUMA family as soon as possible. This 
effective onboarding serves as the foundation for a successful employee journey, aligning our new team 
members with our culture, values, and mission. It ensures compliance, clarifies roles, and provides 
essential support, enabling a seamless integration. This process not only fosters productivity and teamwork 
but also enhances our employees' sense of belonging and growth within PUMA.

LEARNING AND DEVELOPMENT 
Talent management 
We believe that each employee is in charge of their own personal development. At PUMA, we foster a culture 
centred around feedback and results, coupled with a self-directed learning mindset through an integrated 
talent management approach. At least annually, we evaluate of all our employees, assessing their 
performance and potential. Personal development plans are crafted, and we identify the right individuals to 
prepare them for shaping the future of PUMA. 
Global talent conferences are held to assess the entire PUMA workforce, including all levels of 
management. Criteria such as individual performance, competencies, potential, learning agility, ambition, 
and mobility are used for evaluation. A targeted analysis of our employees' profiles allows us to align 
internal talent with upcoming career opportunities. This helps us build a strong succession pipeline and 
address future competency needs. 
Our unwavering focus on internal talent mobility provides our employees with opportunities for professional 
growth and cross-cultural experience, resulting in an enhanced learning curve on both professional and 
personal levels. Utilizing digital platforms, such as Workday's ‚ÄúJob Alert‚Äù and ‚ÄúTalent Marketplace‚Äù feature, 
our internal talents can easily find job opportunities. 
For instance, in 2023, a substantial number of internal moves, including relocations abroad, were reported. 
Overall, we successfully filled three out of four vacant key positions worldwide through internal promotions 
or horizontal transfers, with 60% of open positions filled by internal candidates. This accomplishment 
confirms the effectiveness of our talent and development strategy. 
Our overarching goal is to minimize voluntary turnover and maintain a permanent employment rate of over 
80% for our workforce. In 2023, 92% of our employees worldwide held permanent employment contracts, 
and over 31% were governed by collective agreements. The turnover rate is intricately linked to the share of 
retail business in respective markets and regions, with the employee-induced turnover rate standing at 24% 
(7% for non-retail employees and 39% for retail employees). The overall turnover rate, including retail 
employees, was 32% shows a decrease of 3% compared to last year. At the end of 2023, 22% of our 
employees were working part-time.

Development 
Our employees‚Äô ongoing professional and personal development ensures they have the necessary skills to 
support internal growth and drive the company forward.  
Strategic workforce planning and the use of Workday help us to identify skill gaps and determine the 
capabilities of our employees. We provide a wide choice of training and development options, including 
courses, workshops, and coaching ‚Äì both online and offline, standardised or tailored to specific needs. We 
offer a cutting-edge learning environment for both internal and external training classes, built into the 
Workday Human Capital Management system. This is based on the idea of lifelong learning, which fosters a 
self-driven learning culture. 
In 2023, 18,527 employees worldwide attended 160,481 hours of training and workshops. This averaged 9 
hours and ‚Ç¨ 226 per FTE for training activities. Compared to 2023, the average number of training hours per 
FTE increased by 2 hours. We achieved this by a proactive learner engagement strategy, including fun 
activations on various topics, a gamified approach, and internal learning competitions. The most engaged 
learners worldwide were rewarded quarterly with the ‚ÄúTop Learner Award‚Äù. Based on this strategy, PUMA 
was nominated for an ‚ÄúeLearning Journal‚Äù Award 2024 in the ‚ÄúLearner Engagement‚Äù category.  
LinkedIn Learning and GoodHabitz offer more than 23,000 online training courses in up to 13 languages for 
personal and professional growth. Additionally, PUMA employees actively generate product-specific 
learning content. 
Employees around the globe can access the language learning platform on any device. Speaking a second 
language helps people understand each other, makes connections, and increases diversity. It also enhances 
our internal mobility. While the global focus is on English, people can acquire or perfect any other language 
for business or travel. 
Our entire staff, including retail employees, can now learn a new language online, at their own pace and in a 
way that fits their needs. By offering weekly language training in an office classroom, PUMA helps 
employees integrate locally faster by eliminating the need to drive to external courses after work. 
To support our global workforce during challenging times, we focused on mental health, resilience, 
mindfulness, and emotional stability in 2023. All our current classroom training is based on hybrid concepts 
to ensure that our employees can learn in the way that is best for them. 
We continue to provide our digital agile coach programme to workers globally to establish an agile learning 
organisation and increase agile working practises. Since its launch, approximately 190 employees around 
the globe have completed the programme by 2023. We focus on need-based training at three levels ‚Äì Agile 
Rookie, Agile Facilitator, and Agile Coach ‚Äì to equip the right people with the right skills. Various business 
units are actively using agile ideas and frameworks such as Scrum, Kanban, Design Thinking, and OKRs, in 
their daily operations and strategic planning.

Leadership Training ILP/ILP¬≤/PLE 
Our leaders are vital for PUMA becoming FOREVER.FASTER. We highly value their skills and leadership 
expertise in mastering complex challenges in a volatile world while achieving our goals of excellence. 
Our International Leadership Programme (ILP & ILP¬≤) provides staff with essential competencies and 
promotes a shared knowledge of our leadership culture. PUMA leaders receive comprehensive training and 
coaching, including interactive learning, roleplay, best-practice learning, and joint projects. Mindful 
leadership and agile work are emphasised. The programme's modular design allows managers to apply 
their newly acquired knowledge between seminars. 191 global leaders took part in this state of the art 
programme. 
We continued to promote healthy and sustainable leadership in 2023 with the PUMA Leadership Expedition 
programme. It is designed to teach leaders how to lead well in a VUCA world marked by volatility, 
uncertainty, complexity, and ambiguity. Self-driven learning, nugget-learning, learning sprints, and peer-
learning underpin this virtual, easily accessible course.  
Our leaders can choose what, when, and how to learn from over 130 one-hour learning nuggets with a 
balanced mix of trainer-led virtual sessions and self-directed learning. To maximise learning and transfer 
success, the programme is centred on Learning Sprints, which include trainer-led sessions, self-driven 
nugget learning, retrospective sessions with coaches, and group assignments. 67 talents completed the 
programme successfully in 2023. 
First-time managers get PUMA-tailored training ‚ÄúFrom employee to manager‚Äù to prepare them for their 
new role and ensure a common concept of leadership at PUMA. This programme includes training modules 
and individual coaching as well as online pre- and post-learning. Classroom trainings provide new 
executives with recruiting and appraisal skills. 
Speed Up/Speed Up¬≤ 
Retaining talent and speeding up their progress is important for the success of our business. Two selective 
development programmes, Speed Up and Speed Up¬≤, are designed to help us reach this goal by bringing out 
the best in our people.  
An intensive curriculum of cross-functional projects and tasks, coaching, mentoring, and specialised 
training prepares employees for their next career steps. Participants also get to meet top management and 
build strong networks around the world. 
Future Talent 
We are always looking for future talent we can develop and equip with the relevant skills to take on 
demanding PUMA Group responsibilities. We participate in various career fairs and university initiatives 
both locally and abroad to approach potential employees and identify suitable candidates. Plenty of options 
in an international work environment make PUMA an excellent place for career starters.  
Nine apprentices and six dual students joined the PUMA Headquarters in Herzogenaurach in 2023. Dual 
study programmes are available in International Business, Fashion Management, and Business Informatics. 
Students acquire theoretical grounding through partnerships with various universities and practical 
experience in different PUMA teams. Our apprentices either train as industrial clerks, IT specialists or retail 
sales manager. They work in various company departments to build personal and professional skills and 
increase their knowledge while attending vocational school. By the end of 2023, PUMA employed 41 trainees 
and dual students.  
Internships and working student positions are another way to become familiar with PUMA. Students from 
around the world get six months of work experience as well as the opportunity to build their network and 
hone their talents. By the end of 2023, roughly 140 interns and working students were part of the PUMA 
family.

Feedback 
We value internal and external feedback at PUMA, as it reveals whether we are on track and helps us grow. 
We compare ourselves to other organisations and gain valuable insights from our employees. 
Our "listening strategy" includes surveys, pulse surveys, focus groups, interviews and sentiment analysis to 
gauge employee mood and understand their needs. For this, we use tools such as Amber, Leena AI, and 
Workday. Our Top Employer certification, Great Place to Work award, ‚Äúberufundfamilie‚Äù audit, and other 
honours reflect regular industry benchmarking.  
Since 2009, we have conducted global employee opinion surveys regularly to monitor employee engagement 
and collect feedback on various topics. Overall, 15,339 employees participated in our 2023 global survey to 
share their workplace and work life opinions. This equates to an 85% participation rate (2021: 86%). Despite 
geopolitical tensions in Europe and their far-reaching social and economic effects, from 13 categories two 
categories saw an increase in favourable scores, four categories stayed at their high levels, and seven 
categories saw a slight 1% decrease from the last survey. Our poll results beat or match market data, 
including high-performance data, in all but four categories. High-performance companies outperform the 
market financially and consistently score excellently in surveys. This positive feedback inspires us to 
continue and further strengthen the measures we have implemented. We shared the survey results globally, 
locally, and at departmental level, and follow-up actions were devised. 
Engagement 
Outstanding performance and ongoing growth demand our employees' commitment and dedication. We 
monitor employee engagement by regular global employee opinion surveys. The most recent one achieved 
again an extraordinarily high engagement score of 91%, compared to 92% for the previous survey. This 
implies our engagement score over the last three surveys has remained strong, something we are very proud 
of. We value our employees' high level of engagement and brand loyalty and intend to retain this in the future. 
We started already to implement the action plan resulting from this year's global employee survey.

REWARD, RECOGNITION & BENEFITS 
Compensation & Benefits 
The attractive performance-based compensation system at PUMA consists of fixed base salary, PUMA 
bonus schemes, profit-sharing programs and various social benefits and intangible benefits. We also offer 
long-term incentive programs to the senior management level that honours the sustainable development 
and performance of the business. The bonus system is transparent and globally standardised. Incentives 
are exclusively linked to company goals.  
Ensuring fair and non-discriminatory compensation at PUMA is one of our strategic priorities. Our 
compensation framework is based on analytical job evaluations and a global grading system. Since the 
criteria to be evaluated relate exclusively to characteristics of the job ‚Äì not to the job holder ‚Äì the 
remuneration system as such is gender-neutral. This enables us to rule out any gender-specific 
discrimination emanating from the compensation system.  
After becoming Universal Fair Pay Analyst in Germany in 2022, PUMA was certified as Universal Fair Pay 
Developer in Germany by FPI Fair Pay Innovation Lab as we successfully closed the adjusted pay gap in 
January 2023. We extended the gender pay analysis to our subsidiaries in Europe and EEMEA markets by 
using the consistent methodology. For Sweden and United Arabic Emirates we also closed the adjusted gap 
in 2023. Certain regression analysis results look optimistic, and we are confident to close the adjusted pay 
gap with the support of both local and global management in other European countries soon. For markets 
with highly diversified workforce, nationality does not have a significant impact in the analysis. In 2024, the 
gender pay gap analysis will be continuously conducted and introduced to our other regions to enhance 
internal fairness.  
In addition, we have continued our cooperation with the Fair Wage Network and are able to access 
benchmarks for all of our subsidiaries and analyse them in terms of living wages as defined by the Fair Wage 
Network. For the year 2023 we can confirm, with regards to the Living Wage Adjusted Mean benchmark as 
defined by the Fair Wage Network, that all of our employees are earning a living wage or more. 
Wellbeing 
At PUMA, we care about the well-being of our people. Through a variety of services and benefits, we strive 
to improve the health and happiness of our employees. We started the wellbeing approach at our 
headquarters in Herzogenaurach, Germany. All PUMA companies around the world have adopted it and 
adapted it to their local needs and regulations. It is now an important part of all PUMA subsidiaries around 
the world. 
There are four components to our wellbeing programme: Flex, Social, Financial and Athlete.  
As a sports company, we offer regular in-house sports classes and training, sporting events and free access 
to the gym. We provide outdoor facilities for football, volleyball, basketball, tennis, and paddle tennis. Our

exercise classes include meditation, yoga, Zumba, jumping fitness, and Pilates. We host bouldering, stand 
up paddling, trampolining, bowling, snowshoeing, and skiing events, among others. 
Our "Be Well Weeks", which promote healthy lifestyles, offered free health checks and nutritional advice, as 
well as the opportunity for employees to explore the latest fitness and sports trends. We provide access to 
health and wellness resources, such as ergonomic assessments, mental health days, and health-related 
information. To foster camaraderie and a sense of community, we organise team-building and social events 
for our employees. 
Flexible Working Conditions 
The wellbeing of our people goes hand in hand with excellent working conditions based on a unique culture. 
We offer a range of models, such as flexible working, mobile office, part-time and sabbaticals, to help our 
employees balance their work and personal lives and manage stress. They can choose from these models 
at different points in their lives.  
All our offices around the world have a hybrid working model, which is very flexible in terms of when and 
where people work. Employees in Germany can take advantage of free employee assistance services 
provided by one of our partners. Our headquarters in Herzogenaurach was awarded the German "audit 
berufundfamilie" certificate in 2015, which it has held ever since. The certificate recognises among other 
offers services such as a parent-child office, a nursing room, day care and summer camps for children 
during school holidays. 
PROGRESSION & PERFORMANCE 
Digitalised Infrastructure (Digitalisation) 
A big part of PUMA's plan to streamline processes and improve the employee experience is investing in our 
digital infrastructure. Since 2017, Workday has been our main human capital management (HCM) system. It 
covers HR tasks at all stages of the recruitment process, from candidate to employee experience, 
simplifying tasks such as recruitment, talent management and employee engagement. As a result, the 
workforce is seamlessly integrated throughout the candidate and employee lifecycle.  
Through this digital platform, our employees can access HR resources and data at any time, in a controlled 
and secure environment that protects data privacy and integrity. It gives both employees and managers the 
tools and processes they need to manage people effectively. 
Workday's easy-to-use dashboards give managers clear, actionable insights for strategic planning and 
decision-making. And because all of our global data is stored in one place in Workday, it enables 
comprehensive analytics that help us make evidence-based decisions and drive tangible results. 
By using such a digitalised infrastructure, we aim to maintain our focus on operational efficiency and 
improving our HR practices throughout the PUMA employee lifecycle. This supports PUMA's overall goal of 
improving workplace operations and the employee journey. It also helps us to prepare for the future to 
better deal with the dynamics of challenging labour markets. 
OCCUPATIONAL HEALTH & SAFETY 
We want our employees to be healthy and safe, so we make sure that health and safety issues in the 
workplace are taken seriously. Although the COVID-19 pandemic ceased in 2023, we continued to provide 
free masks, rapid tests and vaccines where needed. To help our employees cope with this politically and 
economically challenging environment and its increased mental stress, we focused on mental wellbeing, 
resilience, and mindfulness in 2023. 
Our global occupational health and safety policy underlines the importance of this issue. PUMA has a 
central Health and Safety Committee at our headquarters in Herzogenaurach, which meets every three 
months. The health and safety experts on this internal committee exchange information on health problems 


PUMA Annual Report 2023

and risks and carry out regular health and safety inspections. These are supplemented by inspections by 
official bodies such as the German Berufsgenossenschaft. Each of our major sites has local health and 
safety experts. Our Global Director People and Organisation, as part of our Executive Management Team, 
reports at least quarterly on health and safety issues to our Executive Committee.  
In our Headquarter in Herzogenaurach we got successfully certified for the ISO 45001 standard. ISO 45001 is 
an international standard that outlines the requirements for an occupational health and safety management 
system (OHSMS) and provides a framework to proactively manage and improve the occupational health and 
safety performance. This certification not only demonstrates our commitment to safety and compliance with 
health and safety law but also helps us to identify and address safety risks. 
We have set ourselves the bonus-related goals of zero fatalities and lowering the average injury rate year on 
year. For 2023, we set a goal to stay below a lost time injury rate of 0.50. The lost time injury rate expresses 
the number of lost time injuries per 200.000 worked hours. In addition to conducting safety training courses 
at all our sites, we also offer online training programs to prepare employees for potential emergency 
situations and thus reduce the number of accidents. In 2023, we promoted our digital OHS training course to 
all our sites, which included hygiene and proper mobile office behavior. Last year, we provided a total of 
27,764 hours of safety training, while 10,769 employees were trained in fire safety and 7,692 employees in first 
aid. In 2023, 98 workplace accidents requiring a work stoppage were recorded worldwide. This corresponds 
to a lost time injury rate of 0.46 compared to 0.45 in 2022. The lost time injury rate for PUMA SE was zero 
and zero in the previous year. Another indicator of employee engagement and the health of our workforce is 
the rate of absence due to sickness, which was 1.95% in 2023. We recorded no fatal accidents, and the rate 
of occupational diseases was zero at PUMA in the last 12 years, including 2023.

Community Engagement 
2023 was another good year for PUMA's community engagement. With the support of our employees, we 
engaged with local communities around the world through various projects. These ranged from beach 
clean-ups and tree planting to organising and participating in charity runs. Colleagues also helped 
underprivileged people, especially children, by donating food and school supplies and started many other 
wonderful initiatives.

Community engagement activities: Reforestation in Renca (from PUMA Chile) 
Here are two examples of how they have helped: 
PUMA Ukraine supports children affected by the war. Many of these children have lost everything -‚Äì their 
childhoods, their homes, and their friends. In collaboration with the Peace in Amour Shelter in Dnipro, 
PUMA Ukraine employees sought to bring joy and warmth to these youngsters. Corporate staff, store 
managers and warehouse staff personalised gifts for the children by printing their names on T-shirts, 
backpacks, and hoodies. 
The PUMA team in South Africa organised several projects. As part of a beach clean-up, they picked up litter 
from the beach and riverbanks. They also went to animal shelters and walked and played with the animals, 
bringing food and blankets for the pets. The biggest CSR events take place every year at the head office and 
in the stores: In 2023, the group prepared 2000 staple food parcels and 850 amenity kits for food banks, 
children's homes and elderly people who can not move around. South African retail workers across the 
country packed individual sandwiches to send to organisations in their local areas. 
We have set ourselves the ambitious goal of spending at least twice as many hours on social engagement as 
our average full-time equivalents (FTE) this year. We encouraged all of our employees around the world to 
participate and recorded projects and employee engagement on an online platform. In total, initiatives led 
by our subsidiaries on five continents contributed a total of 57,344 hours (3,113 for PUMA SE) of community 
engagement. With the projects, we helped protect the environment, promote health and fitness, fight 
discrimination or support education for children in need. Often these projects were carried out in 
cooperation with local non-profit organisations. Considering that the number of full-time employees (FTEs) 
in 2023 was 18,681 (1,255 for PUMA SE), we significantly exceeded our target. Since the start of our 
community engagement program in 2016, we have recorded now over 200,000 community engagement 
hours globally.

CHARITY CAT 
Charity Cat organisation founded by employees continues to support projects near and far in 2023 
The members of Charity Cat have a huge heart for people in need ‚Äì whether that is right next door or across 
the globe. The charitable organisation was founded by PUMA employees in 2004 and has been fundraising, 
supporting special causes, and partnering with different other charities ever since. There is Sozialtreff 
Erlangen, for example, in the next town over from PUMA‚Äôs headquarters in Germany. Charity Cat not only 
supports Sozialtreff Erlangen with the food donations, but members of the charity actually help out within 
that organisation.  
Further afield, on the Philippine island Samar to be precise, Charity Cat has been supporting the activities of 
the charity Herz zu Herz e.V. (which means ‚ÄúHeart to Heart‚Äù in English). The goal is to help the poorest 
families and children there to build a roof over their heads, make sure they have enough to eat and send 
them to school. This year‚Äôs success story from Samar was that several children were able to finish high 
school, while two young people went through culinary school, with one of them landing a job in a five-star 
hotel at the end! 
Another long-time partnered organisation of Charity Cat is FONMEH e.V. in Haiti, that has built an orphanage 
for a group of children and young people, keeping them off the streets and in education. In Haiti, the situation 
has gotten a lot worse: due to droughts and inflation, around 40% of the country‚Äôs population is suffering 
extreme hunger or does not have enough to eat. So, Charity Cat was glad to help at least the kids in 
FONMEH‚Äôs orphanage ‚Äì who have been sharing their food with friends as neighbours ‚Äì as well as other local 
people in Haiti with a special financial donation in 2023, on top of the usual clothes and financial support. 
Other Charity Cat activities included payments for food donations to be driven to the Ukraine, where the war 
that started over one year ago is still ongoing and affecting many people, as well as emergency financial 
donations for the victims of the huge earthquake in the already hard-hit area of south eastern Turkey in 
spring and the catastrophic flooding that struck eastern Libya in the summer via Aktion Deutschland Hilft 
e.V.  
Besides financial support, Charity Cat also gives away PUMA clothing and shoes to partnered projects. For 
example ‚ÄûWir packen‚Äôs an e.V.‚Äúreceived several donations of clothing, underwear and especially shoes, that 
was distributed to refugees fleeing their countries via Greece, France or Bosnia. 
Charity Cat raises money through generous monetary donations from individuals, by fundraising during 
employee events and by organising internal sample give-aways of products provided by PUMA, during which 
employees can donate money for different Charity Cat projects.

DIVERSITY, EQUALITY & INCLUSION 
At PUMA, equality and non-discrimination are an important part of our culture. We encourage and support 
people of all genders and believe that diversity drives success. The different nationalities and backgrounds 
of our employees is one of our key strengths. We employ people from 143 countries and at our home base in 
Germany, we have people with more than 81 different passports. BE YOU, the central tenet of the PUMA 
family, is essential to creating a respectful and supportive work environment where each employee can be 
their true self. We want to create a culture that fosters collaboration and fairness. That is why we are 
listening to our PUMA family to address systemic barriers and identify areas for improvement. 
In 2023, we reviewed our diversity policy and included employee training on discrimination and injustice, 
intercultural communication, diversity, inclusion and belonging. We also hosted talks with internal and 
external speakers and published articles on our internal communication platforms to raise awareness. 
Celebrating diversity! 
We treat all our employees fairly and equally, regardless of their gender, nationality, ethnicity, religion, 
disability, age, or sexual orientation. These values are also part of our PUMA Code of Ethics (2005) and our 
2010 Diversity Charter.  
During Pride Month in June, for example, we celebrated our commitment to diversity and inclusion with a 
‚ÄúTogether Forever‚Äù summer party at our headquarters, complete with food trucks, a live band and a DJ set. 
Our partners from Christopher-Street-Day Nuremberg e.V. had their own stand with information about 
LGBTQ+ events in the area. We also put up rainbow flags at our headquarters and lit up the building in 
rainbow colours.  
We share our beliefs with the rest of the world and support various NGOs and groups around the world.  
For the fourth year running, PUMA worked with The Christopher-Street-Day N√ºrnberg e.V. to celebrate 
PRIDE month in the Nuremberg metropolitan area, support the local PRIDE parade and raise awareness. 
We were proud to organise our own information stand for the first time. This gave us the opportunity to 
connect with the PRIDE community and showcase PUMA‚Äôs diverse and inclusive workplace culture where 
employees can truly be themselves. 
In 2023, PUMA North America‚Äôs (PNA) Diversity, Equity and Inclusion (DEI) team designed strategies based 
on their five pillars: Environment, Talent, Learning, Advocacy, and Marketplace. PNA has four Employee 
Resource Groups: BBOLD for Black and Brown Employees + Allies, Puma Association of Women (PAW) for 
Women + Allies, PumALLiance for LGBTQ+ Employees + Allies, and ROAR for Asian-American and Pacific 
Islander Employees + Allies. Our efforts also included trainings for leaders to improve their resources and 
best-practices needed to act as an inclusive leader. 
PNA‚Äôs DEI team hosted several cultural celebrations throughout the year including a conversation with 
Black Panther‚Äô Oscar winning costume designer Ruth Carter for Black History Month, Peloton instructor 
and PUMA ambassador Aditi Shah for AAPI Heritage Month, and PUMA Ambassadors Dapper Dan and Alex 
Toussaint for Juneteenth. 
‚ÄúCulture Labs‚Äù quarterly conversations meant to build a culture of belonging for everyone and ‚ÄúConnect & 
Reflect‚Äù sessions which focus on providing safe space conversations were also offered by PNA. 
PNA officially kicked off our strategic talent partnership with Clark Atlanta University, a historically black 
university (HBCU), to foster talents among underrepresented groups in the industry and has, in addition, 
partnerships with ALPFA, Ascend, Boston While Black, the Black Footwear Forum, National Black MBA, 
College of Creative Arts and Pensole Lewis College of Business and Design, amongst other collegiate 
partners. To date, this partnership has allowed PNA to impact more than 100 students and PUMA will 
provide over $ 1 million in scholarships over a 5-year period.

Our efforts over the past year have been recognised with independent awards that we are delighted to 
receive. 
For the fourth year running, the Financial Times named us one of Leaders in Diversity, reflecting our 
commitment to creating a diverse, equal, and inclusive culture. In terms of diversity, we are proud to be 
included in the Pride Index and to be one of the top teams in the British Business Women Awards series. 
Integrating Diversity, Equality, and Inclusion (DE & I) into the fabric of our business will help us maintain and 
enhance our international competitiveness. 
Actions to promote gender equality 
We promote equality and are pleased that the PUMA Group has a balanced gender mix, with approximately 
50% women and 50% men working with us. 44% of our STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering and 
Mathematics) employees are female. Women held 43% of global leadership positions in 2023. Thanks to 
PUMA's equal opportunities work, this figure has been on a high level over the last few years (2018: 40%, 
2019: 41%, 2020: 43%, 2021: 44%, 2022: 44%, 2023: 43%). Due to the discontinuation of our Russian Operation 
this year‚Äôs figure decreased by 1%. However, in the rest of the world the share of female managers has 
increased by 0.2%. But there is still room for improvement. We are committed to increasing the number of 
women in leadership positions around the world in the coming years, especially at the highest levels of 
management.

In addition, the Supervisory Board of PUMA SE has set a target of at least two women (33%) for the 
proportion of women on the Supervisory Board. For the Management Board, the Supervisory Board has set 
the following targets for the proportion of women: (i) At least one woman (25%), on condition that PUMA SE 
has four Management Board members, (ii) at least one woman (20%), on condition that PUMA SE has five 
Management Board members, (iii) at least two women (33%), on condition that PUMA SE has six 
Management Board members. We set ourselves an implementation deadline by October 31, 2026. 
We want to continuously support the development of women in management positions. For this reason, we 
offer special training and access to inspiring networks. The exchange with experienced female managers is 
intended to encourage and motivate female employees to take on leading roles within the company 
themselves.  
We see the fact that PUMA has two women on the Management Board of four since January 1, 2023, with 
Anne-Laure Descours (CSO) and Maria Valdes (CPO), as a success of our efforts to achieve equal 
opportunities. 
The average age of our employees worldwide is 32. Our employees represent all working age groups.

BEING INCLUSIVE 
We prioritise creating an inclusive workplace where people with disabilities can work and grow. We adapt 
workplaces and training to meet their needs. In Germany, an elected works council member represents the 
interests of employees with disabilities. In some countries, legal issues prevent our companies from 
recording disability status and severity. Around 1% of our employees have told us that they have a severe 
disability, but the true number is probably higher. 
OFFBOARDING 
Our aim is to ensure that the employee‚Äôs last day is as positive as their first day at PUMA, signifying an 
appreciative end to the employment relationship. We facilitate a respectful and insightful offboarding 
process, allowing both PUMA and the employee to reflect on their time together, ensure knowledge transfer, 
and maintain a positive relationship post-employment. Employees are asked to complete an anonymous exit 
questionnaire on Workday to provide feedback about their work experience. We will conduct an in-depth exit 
interview to understand the reasons behind the decision to leave and propose to reapply in the future. We 
also ask the leaving employees to remain a part of the PUMA family by joining our Alumni Network. This way 
we keep in touch fostering professional networking opportunities as well as using this platform as talent 
pool for future rehires.  
AWARDS 
As a global employer, PUMA received many awards in 2023. One of our main goals is to provide our 
employees with a workplace where they can grow and take on new chances.  
Forbes, together with market research company Statista, created the ‚ÄúWorld's Best Employers‚Äù 
certification. We are proud to be included for the fourth year running in 2023. We were also awarded as one 
of the ‚ÄúWorld‚Äôs Top Companies for Women‚Äù 2023 by Forbes and Statista. In addition, we have also been 
recognised by Newsweek and Statista as one of the ‚ÄúWorld's Most Trustworthy Companies‚Äù. The Financial 
Times together with Statista appointed us as ‚ÄúLeader in Diversity‚Äù for the fourth year in a row.  
In addition to global recognition, we also received several regional awards. Focus magazine named PUMA 
Europe ‚ÄúTop Nationaler Arbeitgeber‚Äù 2023. This award reflects our efforts to create a diverse, equal, and 
inclusive culture. In terms of diversity, we are very proud to be listed in the Pride Index, and to have been 
named one of the top teams in the British Business Women Awards series. All of this demonstrates that 
PUMA supports and promotes diversity at all levels and around the world.

FOREWORD ANNE-LAURE DESCOURS, CSO 
 
In 2023 we started preparing our sustainability vision for 2030 by asking our most important partners and 
internal decision-makers to give us feedback on the sustainability topics that are most relevant for PUMA. 
The results are included in the materiality assessment published in this report.  
In parallel, we accelerated the implementation of our FOREVER. BETTER. Sustainability Strategy, making 
progress towards achieving our 10FOR25 targets in Climate Action, Circularity, and Human Rights.  
From a products and materials perspective, we produced eight out of ten products* according to our PUMA 
Sustainability Index, which means these products are made with materials that are classified as preferred 
fibres by Textile Exchange or originate from certified sources. In 2023, 99.7% of all leather was sourced from 
Leather Working Group-certified tanneries, 99.2% of all cotton was sourced from Better Cotton licensed 
farms or recycled and 99.4% of all paper and cardboard packaging was FSC-certified or recycled paper and 
cardboard. 
In Circularity, we expanded take-back programmes in three new countries. Meanwhile, almost 65% of the 
polyester used for our apparel and accessories products came from recycled materials. We also started to 
scale up the use of recycled cotton, which reached 8.6% in 2023. 
We published the results of our RE:SUEDE project, an experiment to turn a new version of our iconic Suede 
sneaker, into compost (under tailor-made industrial composting conditions) and expanded our RE:FIBRE 
programme to transform textile waste and other used materials into new textiles. During the Women's 
World Cup in Australia, the Swiss National Team played in RE:FIBRE jerseys, and our club partners re-

launched the RE:FIBRE initiative by deploying new take-back bins in additional locations. Overall, 46,000 
RE:FIBRE garments were produced in 2023. 
To help fight climate change, we continued to source 100% renewable electricity for PUMA‚Äôs own offices, 
stores, and warehouses, with either renewable electricity tariffs or renewable energy attribute certificates. 
We also invested over ‚Ç¨ 2 million to electrify our PUMA car fleet and the first low carbon shipment tariffs 
with our logistics service provider Maersk were implemented for our most important sea freight routes 
between Asia and Europe. This has helped us to reduce our own carbon emissions by 85% (market-based, 
including the purchase of RECs) compared to our 2017 baseline, as well as our logistics emissions from sea 
freight by almost 50% compared to 2022.   
In our supply chain, recycled material was up to 22% of the total material used for our products. Our core 
suppliers continued to transition to renewable energy with large-scale rooftop solar PV installations, REC 
purchases, and to transition boiler fossil fuels to renewable fuels. As a result, we reduced our absolute 
Greenhouse Gas emissions (for Scope 3 category 1) by 30% compared to our 2017 baseline and our core 
suppliers used 22% of renewable energy. 
In 2023, PUMA joined Zero 100, a cross-sector membership-based research and intelligence organisation, to 
accelerate progress on Digital Supply Chain Transformation and the path to zero carbon emissions.  
On the social side, more than 222,000 factory workers received training on sexual harassment at work, 
achieving our target three years ahead of schedule. As a long-term signatory to the Bangladesh 
International Accord on Building and Fire Safety, we also joined Accord Pakistan and a pilot to establish an 
Employment Injury Scheme in Bangladesh. Collectively, our PUMA employees contributed 57,000 hours of 
community engagement work around the globe to support educational, women empowerment, 
environmental, and sports activities. 
Our efforts were recognised in several rankings and ratings such as the Corporate Human Rights 
Benchmark, the Platform Living Wage Financials Benchmark, Know the Chain, the Carbon Disclosure 
Project and being a finalist of the German Sustainability Award.  
Despite this recognition, there are still many areas for improvement. We need to further strengthen our 
efforts in Human Rights, Climate Action and Circularity.   
Following our Conference of the People in 2022, we created our Voices of a RE:GENERATION initiative. 
Empowering a cohort of four Young Voices to help PUMA identify key areas for improvement. Through 
various projects, the Voices are helping us to communicate in a way that resonates with the next generation, 
bringing new perspectives and challenging PUMA to think differently. The Voices have met several times 
with key players at PUMA to discuss the progress and challenges surrounding our FOREVER. BETTER. 
Sustainability Strategy and produced PUMA RE:GEN Reports; a podcast series created to engage and better 
communicate with the younger generation on PUMA‚Äôs FOREVER. BETTER. 10FOR25 targets. The Voices have 
also produced RE:HACKS (a social content series sharing tips with consumers on how to extend the lifespan 
of clothing and kicks). The Voices participated in our materiality assessment, giving input into what will 
shape PUMA's 2030 Sustainability Strategy.

HIGHLIGHTS OF 2023 
We continued to implement our FOREVER. BETTER. Sustainability Strategy working towards our 10FOR25 
sustainability targets. We also started preparing for the Corporate Sustainability Reporting Directive (CSRD) 
and of our next target cycle for 2030 with a new double materiality analysis. 
Eight out of ten PUMA products globally were made with a significant part of recycled or certified materials, 
such as better cotton or recycled polyester. 
In Circularity, we re-launched product take-back initiatives at selected stores of our major football club 
partners. At PUMA, we now operate take-back bins at our Headquarters Store in Germany as well as stores 
in the USA, China/Hong Kong, and Australia. We equipped the Swiss National Women‚Äôs Football Team with 
jerseys made from our RE:FIBRE initiative for the Women‚Äôs World Cup in Australia and launched product 
take-back bins at our stores in Switzerland. 
In Climate Action, we agreed on a new more ambitious science-based greenhouse gas reduction target with 
the Science Based Targets initiative (SBTi) and published our first Climate Action Transition Plan. We 
continued to power our own offices, stores, and warehouses with 100% green electricity (including purchase 
of RECs) and added 92 electric cars to our PUMA car fleet. We decreased the air-freight ratio for the 
transport of our products to under 0.5% and started using biofuels for the shipping of PUMA products from 
Asia to Europe. We decreased our absolute Scope 3 emissions from the category purchased goods and 
services by 30% from 2017 to 2023, our core suppliers used 22% of renewable energy and almost 62% of the 
polyester used in our products is recycled. 
In Human Rights, we made the payment of a fair wage a bonus relevant topic for PUMA's own staff and 
continued to track the payment of wages at our core suppliers. For our core supplier Tier 1 factories, the 
average payment is 12.7% above minimum wage. 222,933 factory workers received training on sexual 
harassment and 83,089 were paid a living wage on average. Our PUMA employees donated 57,000 working 
hours to community engagement work and we continued to focus on diversity and inclusion, for example by 
increasing the percentage of women on our management board to 50% and by becoming a signatory of UN 
Women Empowerment Principles (UNWEPs). Finally, we appointed a Human Rights Officer and worked on a 
Human Rights Handbook for our employees to be published in 2024.  
In Biodiversity, we continued to partner with the Fashion Pact and Textile Exchange and supported the 
publication of a biodiversity landscape report for our industry. To ensure that the leather used for PUMA 
products does not contribute to deforestation, we joined the call to action launched by the Leather Working 
Group and Textile Exchange to source all bovine leather from deforestation-free supply chains by 2030 or 
earlier. Since 2022, almost all tanneries used for PUMA leather products have been certified by the Leather 
Working Group. For paper and cardboard, 99.4% are either FSC-certified and/or recycled, to avoid any link to 
deforestation.

AWARDS AND RECOGNITIONS 
Our sustainability efforts continued to be recognised in several external rankings and recognitions. In 2023, 
PUMA maintained its triple-A rating from MSCI, achieved a ‚Äúgood‚Äù rating from the critical consumer 
labeling organisation ‚ÄúGood on You‚Äù, and achieved the highest score in the Platform Financials for Living 
Wages benchmark report and Corporate Human Rights Benchmark for our industry, and maintained an A 
rating from CDP.  
PUMA once again topped the FTSE4Good sector ranking. We received a prime rating from ISS and were 
included in the Corporate Knights Global 100 Most Sustainable Companies list for the third year in a row, 
leading the textiles and clothing peer group. PUMA also had the highest score among all sports brands in 
the S&P Corporate Sustainability Assessment.  
At the same time, we continued to receive critical feedback in reports issued by Stand Earth on the use of 
biomass as a replacement for coal in our supply chain, the Changing Markets Foundation on the 
dependence on oil as a raw material for synthetic fibres and components, Labor Behind the Label on 
working conditions in Pakistan, and Clean Clothes Campaign and Action Aid on the wage gap during the 
COVID-19 pandemic in Cambodia. We consider these critical remarks as we develop our sustainability 
standards, process and strategy.

PUMA‚ÄôS FOREVER. BETTER. SUSTAINABILITY 
STRATEGY 
Sustainability remains an integral part of the strategic priorities for PUMA under the leadership of our CEO 
Arne Freundt and our CSO Anne-Laure Descours. 
Our FOREVER. BETTER. Sustainability Strategy is based on our 10FOR25 targets, which were introduced in 
2019 following an extensive materiality analysis and stakeholder dialogue. In 2023, we updated our 
materiality analysis in preparation for our new target cycle until 2030. The results confirm that the areas of 
Human Rights, Circularity, and Climate Action (including Biodiversity) were ranked as a high priority. 
Until the end of our 10FOR25 targets period, we will still report on the 10 target areas to improve our 
sustainability performance: Human Rights, Climate Action, Circularity, Products, Water and Air, Biodiversity, 
Plastics and the Oceans, Chemicals, Health & Safety as well as Fair Income. 
For each of these target areas, which reference the related United Nations Sustainable Development Goals 
(SDG), we have defined a minimum of three concrete targets, as well as key performance indicators to 
follow the progress we have made. 
With our FOREVER. BETTER. Sustainability Strategy, we continue our path to fully integrate sustainability 
into all our core business functions. Sustainability targets are part of the bonus arrangements for every 
member of our global leadership team, from the CEO to Team Heads. 
PUMA‚Äôs Code of Conduct and our vendor compliance programme, which were introduced more than 20 
years ago, are still the basis for any contractual relationship with manufacturers globally and remain the 
foundation of our responsible sourcing strategy and programme. We revised the Code in 2023 and will 
publish the new version in 2024.

SUSTAINABILITY ORGANISATION AND 
GOVERNANCE STRUCTURE  
PUMA‚Äôs sustainability organisation is structured and governed in multiple ways: 
‚Ä¢ At the Supervisory Board level, with a Sustainability Committee. In 2023, we had several meetings to 
discuss the PUMA action plan related to the Corporate Sustainability Reporting Directive (including our 
plan to conduct a double materiality assessment in 2023). We had a deep dive discussion into Human 
Rights including PUMA work on fair income, responsible purchasing practices, the implementation plan 
of the German Supply Act and critical feedback received through NGO reports regarding factories' 
working conditions. We also had a deep dive discussion into circularity, including PUMA programmes 
and projects update, and into Climate actions including our 2030 decarbonisation pathway plan. 
‚Ä¢ At the Management Board level, the responsibility for sustainability is assigned to the Chief Sourcing 
Officer (CSO). 
- There were several Management Board meetings in 2023 with dedicated sustainability updates and 
decision on topics like the 2022 sustainability target status and 2023 action plan, PUMA‚Äôs action plan 
related to the German Supply Chain Act and Corporate Sustainability Reporting Directive (including 
our plan to conduct a double materiality assessment in 2023), new minimum wage negotiation 
development in Bangladesh and PUMA‚Äôs position, circularity programmes and projects status and our 
2030 decarbonisation pathway plan.   
- PUMA‚Äôs CEO, the Chair of the Supervisory Board and the Works Council all participated in our 
materiality assessment, which will lay the foundations of our new Sustainability Strategy for 2030. 
- Our CSO has a monthly meeting with the Sustainability Leads for corporate and supply chain 
sustainability. Topics include Human Rights, Health and Safety, and chemical programmes, as well as 
climate and water projects in the supply chain. 
‚Ä¢ At the Functional Heads level, with an Executive Sustainability Committee.  
- The Executive Sustainability Committee comprises of all Functional Heads of the company, such as 
the People & Organisation, Sourcing, Finance, IT, Marketing, Risk Management, Investor Relations, 
Retail, Logistics and Legal Affairs. The committee met twice in 2023 to provide an update on 
sustainability programmes and approved the 2023 Sustainability Bonus Targets. 
‚Ä¢ At the Product level, with a Cross-Functional Business working group and monthly updates on PUMA‚Äôs 
more sustainable product strategy and execution. 
‚Ä¢ At the Subsidiary level with nominated Sustainability Leads for each PUMA subsidiary (quarterly updates 
on PUMA Sustainability Strategy and performance, best practice sharing from individual subsidiaries). 
‚Ä¢ At the Sustainability Experts level, with a corporate sustainability department and a supply chain 
sustainability department. 
‚Ä¢ At the Legal and Compliance level, with a Human Rights Officer. In December 2023, PUMA appointed 
PUMA General Counsel Corporate Governance & Compliance as Human Rights Officer. The Human 
Rights Officer shall monitor PUMA‚Äôs risk management system, risk analysis relating to Human Rights 
and compliance with Human Rights due diligence regulations. 
‚Ä¢ PUMA has a Health and Safety Committee that operates in the headquarters and conducts quarterly 
meeting. This committee regularly reviews existing reports on known health and safety risks, conducts 
frequent health and safety inspections and exchanges documentation on health issues and risks. The 
Global Director People & Organisation, who is part of the Health and Safety Committee, informs the 
Management Board of PUMA SE about relevant health and safety matters at least quarterly.

STAKEHOLDER OUTREACH 
To ensure that the PUMA Sustainability Strategy covers the most relevant topics, we use a formal 
materiality analysis process combined with stakeholder dialogue and outreach. 
For our updated materiality assessment, we interviewed several non-profit stakeholders including the 
Global Trade Union Federation IndustriAll, Fair Labor Association, Textile Exchange, United Nations 
Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC), and the German Development Organization GIZ. 
Our first PUMA stakeholder dialogue dates back to 2003. Since then, we have organised 15 in-person 
stakeholder meetings and held one virtually. Our stakeholder dialogue includes representation in and 
contribution to several sustainability initiatives. In 2023, we actively participated in several sustainability 
initiatives and events, such as conferences by the UNFCCC (Global Stocktake and COP28), ZDHC (Board 
Meetings), Textile Exchange Annual Conference, Better Work Global Business Forum, OECD Forum on Due 
Diligence in the Garment and Footwear Sector, Better Cotton Initiative Annual Conference and the Global 
Fashion Agenda (Global Conference), to name just a few. Our overall investment in partnerships to 
accelerate sustainability efforts amounts to over ‚Ç¨ 1 million. Our next formal PUMA stakeholder dialogue 
meeting is planned for April 2024. 
In 2023, we developed a Civil Society Organisations (CSOs) engagement policy to engage with them 
reactively and proactively, further details are given in the Due Diligence and Risk Assessment section of this 
report. 
PUMA has placed a large emphasis on industry collaboration and, where possible, supporting existing 
industry initiatives. Collaboration with our peers is paramount to streamlining the sustainability efforts of 
our industry. We believe that encouraging the alignment of individual industry organisations, e.g., 
converging the use of tools and processes, makes the overall system more efficient.

‚Üó G.03 MATRIX OF KEY PARTNERSHIP INITIATIVES 
 
CONFERENCE OF THE PEOPLE AND VOICES OF A RE:GENERATION 
In 2022, PUMA held the Conference of the People, a first-of-its-kind event for PUMA. Industry peers, 
activists, NGOs, experts, ambassadors, and consumers came together to discuss solutions for some of the 
fashion industry‚Äôs pressing sustainability challenges. With a special focus on Gen-Z, the conference 
highlighted the need for brands to improve transparency and communication more regarding sustainability.   
Following this event, in April 2023 PUMA launched its year-long Voices of a RE:GENERATION initiative, 
empowering a group of Young Voices to help PUMA identify key areas for improvement and giving them a 
seat at the table alongside leading stakeholders. 
Through various projects, the Voices are educating, engaging and co-creating with PUMA to help improve 
how PUMA communicates about sustainability in a way that resonates with the next generation, bringing 
new perspectives and challenging PUMA to think differently. In September 2023, PUMA expanded the reach 
of the initiative beyond Europe and the USA by adding Indian sustainable fashion advocate Aishwarya 
Sharma. Aishwarya joined PUMA‚Äôs current Voices, the USA-based upcycler Andrew Burgess, Germany-
based sustainable and healthy living vlogger Luke Jaque-Rodney and France-based visual artist and 
creative consultant Jade Roche.

To date, the Voices have met several times with key players at PUMA to discuss the brand‚Äôs progress and

Reports, a podcast series created to engage and better communicate with the younger generation on 
PUMA‚Äôs FOREVER. BETTER. 10FOR25 target areas.  
Since then, the Voices have also partnered with PUMA to produce RE:HACKS (a social content series 
sharing tips with consumers on how to care for and extend the lifespan of clothing and kicks) and 
participated in the PUMA 2023 sustainability materiality assessment, giving input into what will shape 
PUMA‚Äôs 2030 sustainability action plans. 
In October 2023, three of the Voices visited some of PUMA‚Äôs manufacturing partners in Bangladesh, 
Vietnam, and Turkey to get their impressions of PUMA‚Äôs supply chain and experience the realities, progress 
and challenges of sustainability at scale on the ground. Their learnings will be shared through their social 
channels in 2024. Building on these efforts and progress, PUMA will continue the RE:GENERATION initiative 
into 2024.

PUBLIC POLICY ADVOCACY ENGAGEMENT 
PUMA does not lobby as a separate entity. However, as part of our membership in industry federations and 
expert organisations like the Federation of the European Sporting Goods Industry (FESI) or the Policy Hub, 
our experts provide feedback on policy positions to those organisations and attend meetings with policy 
makers from time to time. We ensure that our feedback provided is aligned with our Sustainability Strategy 
and targets, such as limiting global warming to 1.5 degrees. In 2023, PUMA joined the Fashion Industry

MOST MATERIAL ASPECTS 
PUMA performed a formal materiality analysis in 2018 ‚Äì 2019 with the help of expert consultancy BSR. The 
methodology, list of consulted stakeholders, and results were reviewed and approved by PUMA‚Äôs Managing 
Directors. Materiality assessment results are also considered in the risk management process. Our risk 
management function assesses our most material topics and the risks related to those topics in 
collaboration with the risk owners. The 2019 materiality assessment formed the basis for our existing PUMA 
FOREVER. BETTER. Sustainability Strategy and 10FOR25 targets, as well as the structure of this 2023 report, 
and is outlined in the graph below. Further details on the methodology can be found in PUMA‚Äôs 2022 Annual 
Report. 
 
‚Üó G.04 PUMA‚ÄôS MOST MATERIAL ASPECTS (2018 ‚Äì 2023) 
 
DOUBLE MATERIALITY ANALYSIS ‚Äì 2024 AND BEYOND 
In 2023, PUMA conducted an updated materiality analysis based on the principle of double materiality as 
requested by the Corporate Sustainability Reporting Directive (CSRD). The methodology, list of consulted 
stakeholders, and results were reviewed and approved by PUMA‚Äôs Managing Directors (CEO, Chief Financial 
Officer, Chief Product Officer and Chief Sourcing Officer). PUMA‚Äôs CEO, the Chair of the Supervisory Board, 
and a Workers Council representative participated in the materiality assessment.  
The 2023 materiality assessment was conducted by the expert consultancy Radley Yeldar and included:  
‚Ä¢ A horizon scanning stage, including peer benchmark assessment, legislation, sustainability frameworks 
and ratings, and media screening 
‚Ä¢ Development of CSRD-compliant impact assessment criteria 
‚Ä¢ Stakeholders interviews with 32 participants, including 16 PUMA and 16 external stakeholders as well as 
an online survey (37 responses)  
‚Ä¢ Out of the interviews, eight in-depth interviews for financial impact were conducted, including investor 
and lender views 
‚Ä¢ Results validation meetings between PUMA‚Äôs Sustainability Team and Radley Yeldar 
‚Ä¢ Managing Directors‚Äò approval 
 
A total of 25 sustainability topics were selected after the horizon scanning stage to be evaluated by 
stakeholders. Seven topics were identified by our stakeholders as being financially material to PUMA.

SCOPE OF THE REPORT 
DATA COLLECTION 
In the Sustainability report, we cover the PUMA Group data, excluding PUMA United. We collect data from 
our core suppliers of components, materials, and finished products. Our materials data excludes the 
materials used by stichd (mainly socks and bodywear) and PUMA United, as well as the materials used for 
Cobra Golf equipment, as these companies run their own sourcing. For social compliance data, PUMA 
United, stichd, and Cobra Golf factories producing PUMA products are included. For environmental data, we 
also report stichd own sites and factories according to PUMA‚Äôs Environmental Performance Rating System. 
We do not provide separate reports for PUMA SE and the Group in the Sustainability section.  
 
DATA SOURCES 
To ensure a high level of transparency and promote the sharing of environmental and social data with our 
industry peers, we have chosen to use external databases, most of which are publicly accessible: 
‚Ä¢ The Open Supply Hub, an open-source map and database of global apparel facilities  
‚Ä¢ The Fair Factories Clearinghouse for sharing social audit data with other brands  
‚Ä¢ The wastewater platform of the Zero Discharge of Hazardous Chemicals Foundation (ZDHC) for supplier 
data on wastewater testing reports (ClearStream reports) 
‚Ä¢ The ZDHC Chemicals Gateway for the use of safe chemicals 
‚Ä¢ ZDHC-approved chemical inventory platforms: BHive, CleanChain, E3 
‚Ä¢ RSL database Green Arrow 
‚Ä¢ The China-based NGO IPE for the publication of suppliers‚Äô environmental data  
‚Ä¢ IPE‚Äôs Green Supply Chain Map of environmental performance data of some of our core suppliers in 
China  
‚Ä¢ The Higg Index Platform Worldy  
‚Ä¢ The Fair Labor Association (FLA) fair compensation dashboard to benchmark factory workers‚Äô income

‚Ä¢ ACCORD Bangladesh inspections database: The Bangladesh Accord on Fire and Building Safety in 
Bangladesh 
‚Ä¢ Worker Complaints ‚Äì third-party platforms: MicroBenefits CIQ, Labor Solution - WOVO, Amader Kotha 
We also use our own sustainability data collection tool to record social and environmental performance data 
from PUMA-owned and operated sites and from the core suppliers that manufacture our products or the 
material used in our products.

DUE DILIGENCE AND RISK ASSESSMENT 
PUMA conducts regular and industry-specific due diligence on human rights and labour, environmental, and 
integrity risks (listed in T.03) for its own activities and across its supply chain as per the recommendations of 
the UN Guiding Principles for Business and Human Rights, OECD Due Diligence Guidance for Responsible 
Supply Chains in the Garment and Footwear Sector, and other relevant responsible business conduct 
standards, such as the German Supply Chain Act. We embed responsible business conduct in our policies, 
training, and management systems and identify actual and potential harms in our own operations and 
supply chain.

Due diligence is an ongoing process, to identify, mitigate, and prevent risks and address their existing and 
potential adverse impacts (e.g. child labour, discrimination, hazardous chemicals, etc.).  
As stated in the ‚ÄúCorporate Governance Statement‚Äù, PUMA has a functioning Compliance Management 
System (CMS) to systematically prevent, detect and sanction violations in the areas of corruption, money 
laundering, conflicts of interest, antitrust law and fraud/embezzlement. 
In response to the possibility of future crises and/or upcoming regulations, our vendors are recommended 
to conduct their own due diligence. PUMA‚Äôs process of assessing the risk of potential harm to people 
(human rights and labour and environmental risks) includes: 
‚Ä¢ External sources: NGO reports, media, country indices and country regulation, PUMA partnerships with 
Fair Labor Association, Better Work, Fashion Charter, ZDHC, AFIRM, etc.  
‚Ä¢ Internal sources: PUMA social, chemical and environmental audit findings/data analysis, grievances 
received per country, supply chain risk mapping, number of factories in countries with high risk, per 
commodity, also including non-core factories, material processing and raw material extraction. 
We prioritize risks based on: 
‚Ä¢ Severity: Scale (how serious the impact is), scope (how many people are or will be affected) and 
irremediability 
‚Ä¢ The likelihood of risk occurring based on the operating environment: Conflict zone, weak governance; 
mismatch between local practices and international standards 


PUMA Annual Report 2023 
‚Üó Sustainability

Our mitigation measures include the factory monitoring programme, grievance mechanism, supplier 
scorecard, business integration, goal-setting and internal and external reporting. The effectiveness of our 
measures is evaluated based on progress and compliance with our policies. 
PUMA‚Äôs policies are published on our website, as well as our factory monitoring programmes and 
standards defined in our Social, Environmental, Occupational Health and Safety and Chemical Handbooks.  
In 2023, we developed a Civil Society Organisations (CSOs) engagement policy, following Fair Labor 
Association guidelines and approval. It formalizes PUMA‚Äôs commitment to engage with CSOs reactively and 
proactively for information sharing (to understand concerns and to increase transparency about PUMA‚Äôs 
works, challenges and progress) and for consultation purposes (to make informed sourcing decisions to not 
impact people's rights) which can lead to collaboration to address a specific challenge or remediate an 
issue. 
It also defines the criteria below to plan the form and frequency of engagement: 
‚Ä¢ High-risk and high-production volume countries  
‚Ä¢ Severity and the likelihood of violations or risks 
‚Ä¢ Knowledge gaps regarding new or upcoming risks identified through a supply chain risk assessment  
‚Ä¢ Persistent issues identified through factory monitoring programme or risk assessment 
‚Ä¢ Concerns raised through PUMA grievance mechanisms and third-party reports 
Proactive engagement with CSOs aims to develop and review our sustainability-related goals, policies and 
standards, assess risks or get input for our double materiality assessment, develop remediation plans and 
improve access to remedy, inform about PUMA‚Äôs sustainability performance and open issues and evaluate 
the effectiveness of our due diligence processes, sustainability programmes and grievance mechanism. 
Reactive engagement takes place when a concern is raised to PUMA. PUMA and PUMA‚Äôs suppliers offer 
different grievance channels to any worker as well as third parties, including CSOs, to raise their concerns 
regarding human rights, environmental protection and violations of PUMA‚Äôs policies: such concerns can be 
raised through workers‚Äô voice platforms, the PUMA hotline and Fair Labor Association third party 
complaints. 
PUMA also adopted ELEVATE intelligence (EiQ), a comprehensive suite of supply chain analytics, to: 
‚Ä¢ Assess our supply chain risks by geography, commodity and issue 
‚Ä¢ Complete a risk assessment for suppliers, factories and sites 
‚Ä¢ Manage risks that are material for each supplier, factory or site 
Our 10FOR25 targets are linked directly to the four main sustainability-related risks identified in our due 
diligence process:  
‚Ä¢ Potential human rights violations or incidents in our supply chain (Tier 1 and core Tier 2*) 
‚Ä¢ Potential incidents of environmental pollution in our supply chain (Tier 1 or core Tier 2) 
‚Ä¢ Potential non-compliance with chemical regulations during production (Tier 1 or core Tier 2)  
‚Ä¢ Negative effects of climate change (transition risks and physical risks) 
The four main sustainability-related risks are reflected in the Risk Management System that PUMA has 
established to identify and manage material risks or risks that could pose a threat to the company‚Äôs 
objectives at an early stage. The Risk Management function conducts formal interviews with selected risk 
owners (key function management responsible for identifying and addressing the risks) on a semi-annual 
basis set to identify, evaluate, and report risks. The risk owners of PUMA‚Äôs Sustainability Department review 
risks within their area of responsibility and report on the measures implemented to mitigate or reduce the 
potential impact of sustainability-related risks to the Risk Management function.

To mitigate and prevent sustainability risks, PUMA has set the 10FOR25 targets and implemented a due 
diligence process. PUMA reports internally and publicly (through annual sustainability reports) on the 
following activities and progress toward our 10FOR25 targets: 
‚Ä¢ Conducting regular complete and follow-up social audits based on International Labor Organization 
standards (including reaudits and capacity building projects) for all Tier 1 and core Tier 2 suppliers.  
‚Ä¢ Monitoring performance with factory environmental management system via Higg Index Facility 
Environmental Module (FEM), regular RSL (Restricted Substances List) testing of materials and 
products, input chemistry control via Manufacturing Restricted Substances List (MRSL) by ZDHC, output 
control via wastewater tests by independent and accredited laboratories.  
‚Ä¢ Following the status of new regulations via industry associations such as the Federation of the European 
Sporting Goods Industry (FESI), or the Policy Hub, and other key partners. A matrix listing PUMA's key 
partnership initiatives is maintained to track all relevant international and national sustainability 
organisations, and follow up on legal requirements (e.g. UK Modern Slavery Act, new German Supply 
Chain Due Diligence Act) in a timely manner.  
‚Ä¢ Implementation of an approval procedure for sustainability related product claims. 
‚Ä¢ Conducting stakeholder dialogue with NGOs and other expert organisations.  
‚Ä¢ Regular updates of PUMA policies and sustainability standards (e.g. Code of Conduct, sustainability 
handbooks). 
‚Ä¢ Establishing of a functioning workers‚Äô hotline (included in Code of Conduct) and employees‚Äô hotline 
(included in Code of Ethics). 
‚Ä¢ Enhanced industry-wide collaboration with competitors in terms of human rights and environmental 
performance measurement tools, standards and certifications (e.g. Facility Environmental Module, 
Social Labour Convergence Programme, Material Restricted Substances List, Leather Working Group, 
Forest Stewardship Council). 
‚Ä¢ Regular internal training (for example e-learning accessible via Workday). 
Net risks as outlined in the CSR Directive Implementation Act (¬ß 315c in relation to ¬ß 289c, section 3, number 
3 German Commercial Code (HGB)), were not identified in 2023. 
Further details on PUMA‚Äôs overall risk management can be found in the Risk Management section. 
In 2023, as part of PUMA‚Äôs continuous review of Due Diligence policies and processes, we revised our Code 
of Conduct and will publish it in 2024. We will also revise PUMA FOREVER. BETTER. Sustainability 
Handbooks in 2024. 
The scope of the implementation of the Code, Policies and Handbooks has been expanded, mentioning all 
PUMA‚Äôs business partners within and beyond the supply chain, including business partners who represent 
PUMA (such as consultants and agents), and PUMA‚Äôs own organisation. 
The updates of the Code of Conduct include clarifying definitions regarding the worst forms of child labour 
and the prohibition of slavery. Provisions were added regarding supply chain traceability, the use of security 
forces without violating any Human Rights, provision on chemical and waste management in line with 
International Conventions, as well as unlawful eviction and taking of land. We also emphasize PUMA‚Äôs 
commitment to remediation of violations and similar expectations from our business partners; we also 
added how workers can use PUMA hotline for any grievance. 
 
Two new standards were added to the Code of Conduct: 
‚Ä¢ No harm when using security forces 
‚Ä¢ Respect of land rights

To ensure that our suppliers understand the requirements set by PUMA as well as international Due 
Diligence regulation and standards in the garment and footwear industry, PUMA organised multiple training 
sessions in 2023 including: 
 
‚Ä¢ Meetings with suppliers to share updates on PUMA standards and industry best practices, elaborate on 
the German Due Diligence Supply Chain Act by industry experts; CNTAC in China and VITAS in Vietnam. 
‚Ä¢ Training on Accident Prevention and Reporting with factory management, who will support us in 
achieving the goal of training 100,000 workers in this area. 
‚Ä¢ Root cause analysis training for strategic suppliers. 
‚Ä¢ Customised e-learning on Social Standards, to support existing and new suppliers with understanding 
PUMA's expectations. 
‚Ä¢ PUMA expectations for suppliers regarding our Code of Ethics. 
 
Fashion Revolution works towards a vision of a fashion industry that conserves and

PUMA‚Äôs sustainability policies are aligned with the United Nations‚Äô (UN) Declaration of Human Rights, the 
UN Guiding Principles (UNGPs) on Business and Human Rights, the International Labor Organization‚Äôs Core 
Labor Conventions, and the ten principles of the UN Global Compact (UNGC). Observing Human Rights was 
part of our first Code of Conduct developed in 1993 and has guided our business ethics ever since. It has 
been the long-standing practice of PUMA to monitor our supply chain and conduct Human Rights due 
diligence for our suppliers globally, including those in major production hubs, such as Vietnam, Bangladesh 
and China continuously and rigorously. 
 
HUMAN RIGHTS AT PUMA'S OWN ENTITIES 
Guided by our Code of Ethics and Code of Conduct, PUMA‚Äôs company culture of diversity and inclusion puts 
Human Rights at the centre of everything we do. Our commitment to employee well-being is also 
documented in numerous employee awards and top-employer rankings received all over the world. 
Our internal programmes to uphold Human Rights include measuring gender, nationality, and age distri-
bution among our colleagues, providing a safe work environment as well as elected worker representatives 
and collective bargaining agreements at selected larger offices, such as our German headquarters. In 
December 2023, PUMA appointed a Human Rights Officer to monitor PUMA‚Äôs risk management system, risk 
analysis relating to human rights and compliance with Human Rights due diligence regulations. In addition, 
we worked on a Human Rights Handbook for our own entities globally, to be published in 2024.  
All PUMA employees who feel that ethical standards in business may have been compromised can raise 
their voices. Various channels are in place to report any suspicions and/or observations related to modern 
slavery or other Human Rights aspects. In practice, all employees can address their requests regarding 
apparent failures to their line manager. They may also raise the matter with staff representatives, the Legal 
department, the Internal Audit department, or via a toll-free external whistleblower platform available

Obligations in Supply Chains (LkSG), PUMA published its Rules for the Complaint Procedure. 
REFORM INITIATIVE 
As REFORM continues through its fifth year of existence, our partnership with The Trevor Project (TTP) 
continues to drive impact in our communities with a focus on supporting policies and practices that affirm 
and protect young LGBTQ athletes. In 2021, in partnership with TTP, we sought to build a well-researched 
and comprehensive training scheme to support equity in sports and promote gender inclusivity. In 2023, we 
launched the Reform the Locker Room programme, furthering our reach to locker rooms, classrooms, and 
offices alike. 
REFORM was also able to launch a new project and collection, called Icons of Unity. Icons of Unity honors 
PUMA ambassador and global Icon, Tommie Smith, and amplifies his message of Justice, Dignity, Equality 
and Peace. As we continue to build out this programme, we look forward to identifying athletes, colleagues, 
and community leaders who embody this characteristic of Tommie, being more than what is obvious and a 
beacon for a more united community. We kicked this off with an amazing interview with Tommie and 
Olympians, Felix Streng and Colin Jackson. 
In 2023, we educated and preserved culture and history through our work with BLACK FIVES and its NY 
RENS 100 collection launched in November with court refurbishments and street dedications. We have been 
able to advocate for and amplify a message of rebuilding communities in conjunction with our partner Game 
of Our Lives and football star and PUMA ambassador Oleksandr Zinchenko and his Game4Ukraine 
charitable celebrity soccer match that raised large amounts of money to support the rebuilding of Ukrainian 
schools. We supported the match with game balls and training gear for all participants. We also hosted a 
match viewing event at our Herzo HQ with many of the Ukrainian families that have been relocated during 
the time of war. 
REFORM continues to show up and show out for our broader communities and remains true to our brand 
vision; ‚Äú‚Ä¶where all barriers to participation are removed so that everyone who wants to play can play.‚Äù

COMMUNITY ENGAGEMENT  
Our goal is to reach a total number of hours spent on community engagement equal to twice our annual 
average FTE (full-time equivalent). We encourage all our employees around the world to participate and 
record projects and employee engagement on an online platform. 
Our Community Engagement Programme has continued to create a positive impact locally by supporting 
social, health and environmental causes, and we were able to donate 57,000 community hours in 2023. Since 
2017, we have now recorded over 200,000 community engagement hours globally.

HUMAN RIGHTS IN THE SUPPLY CHAIN 
 
RESPONSIBLE PURCHASING PRACTICE POLICY 
As a responsible business partner for our suppliers, we recognise that our business practices, and our 
trading terms and conditions can have a significant impact on the organisation at our suppliers‚Äô factories. 
PUMA‚Äôs Responsible Sourcing Policy aims to reduce potential negative impacts. PUMA‚Äôs Responsible 
Purchasing Practice Policy was developed in 2019 to create a framework for guiding decisions and 
maintaining consistency through eight key principles: 
1. Only working with suppliers that have signed a Manufacturing Agreement. 
2. Payments to suppliers are made on time and in full. We only deduct payments and impose penalties 
when it is lawful to do so. 
3. Price paid for the product to include reasonable labour costs, such as overtime premium payments, 
social insurance payments, and costs to comply with environmental standards. 
4. Open production capacity must be declared by the supplier based on standard work weeks as per the 
law of the relevant production country. 
5. Seasonal production plans are allocated considering the negotiated capacity with the supplier. 
6. Sufficient production lead time must be provided. 
7. Suppliers may not subcontract production without authorisation from PUMA. All subcontracting units 
should respect our Code of Conduct. 
8. A minimum notice of six months must be given when ending a partnership or downscaling orders. 
Longer timeframes will be granted, based on the average production capacities used in the last two to 
three years, to reduce the impact on workers. 


PUMA Annual Report 2023 
‚Üó Sustainability 
56 
In 2022, 280 PUMA staff and 1,145 supplier participants received Responsible Sourcing Practice training. The 
training referred to the UN Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights, to explain the link between 
the purchasing practices, potential impact on working conditions, and the risk of Human Rights violations.  
In 2023, as part of our Due Diligence Policy review, we added a clause on responsible disengagement into 
our responsible purchasing practices. Following the Fair Labor Association guidelines, PUMA commits to 
provide a minimum of six months of notice when significantly downscaling orders or terminating a business 
relationship with suppliers. To mitigate impact on workers‚Äô jobs and give suppliers time to find new buyers, 
a longer timeframe shall be granted, depending on the average production capacities used over the last two 
to three years. 
 
BETTER BUYING SURVEY 
In 2023 we asked 32 strategic Tier 1 suppliers (11 accessories, 12 apparel, and nine footwear suppliers 
representing 69% of our business volume and 80% of our business value) to participate in the Better Buying 
survey to collect feedback from our core suppliers on the implementation status of PUMA‚Äôs responsible 
purchasing practices. 28 suppliers responded, and the response rate was 90.3%. 
Better Buying gathers data from suppliers to provide guidance to brands for improving purchasing 
practices. Brands voluntarily invite their suppliers to participate. Suppliers rate their brands anonymously 
according to the five principles of responsible purchasing which focus on the buyer purchasing practices 
that could have the biggest impact on suppliers‚Äô businesses: 
1. Visibility: Brands provide enough information about the planned business for suppliers to act 
2. Stability: Brands give suppliers steady and predictable business across the year 
3. Time: Brands provide enough time for suppliers to complete all processes 
4. Financials: Brands use fair financial practices with suppliers 
5. Shared Responsibility: Brands play their part in improving supply chain social and environmental 
sustainability 
We benchmarked our 28 suppliers' feedback with more than 800 suppliers' feedback from the 16 brands 
classified under sporting goods and discussed these results internally to set a clear focus area for 
improvement. PUMA‚Äôs overall score slightly increased in 2023, mainly due to the increased score on 
covering cost for compliant production, accountability for delays, regular forecast updates, and order 
cancellation percentage. The feedback is described below. 
VISIBILITY 
Design and development can play a significant role in improving supply chain sustainability. Choices made at 
this stage have significantly lower financial, social, and environmental impacts. While all our samples are 
based on a tech pack, tech packs have also been reviewed in 2023 to improve the accuracy of information. 
PUMA has also provided internal training on the importance of providing accurate information to suppliers. 
Our purchase order accuracy has improved compared to 2022. Our suppliers recognise our efforts in 
increasing the use of more sustainable materials, 3D sampling, industry certification, and setting target 
prices before product development. Our sample hit rate remains strong.  
All our suppliers confirmed that we provide them with a business forecast, enabling them to plan the 
workforce that is needed. In 2023, PUMA discussed its production capacity and the potential impact of 
forecast inaccuracies on suppliers. We also provided internal training for key business departments 
involved. PUMA has also been working with its suppliers to ensure their production capacity is accurate and 
there has been regular feedback on sales forecast to its sales division. Although the overall score has 
improved for 2023, we have identified the need to better communicate our overall forecasting and planning 
timelines and processes to our suppliers and improve in-season communication for some product divisions. 
Given the global macroeconomic situation in 2023, which has led to a change in customers' ordering 


PUMA Annual Report 2023 
‚Üó Sustainability 
57 
behaviour, the gap between the placed and planned capacity results in unutilised capacity and excess 
material increased according to our suppliers. 
STABILITY  
We value long term relationships with our suppliers. 40% of our suppliers have been working with PUMA for 
more than ten years. To help ensure stability, as a principle, we will not cancel orders and accommodate 
order placement to respond to suppliers‚Äô difficulties such as lockdown periods. In the case of order 
cancellation which remains less than 1% for PUMA, we always pay our suppliers for any liability associated 
with cancellations. In 2023, 100% of suppliers from Accessories and Footwear reported no order 
cancellation, while some Apparel suppliers reported cancelled orders.  
TIME 
A large majority of our suppliers confirmed that we have an agreed time and action calendar for pre-
production and production deadlines. In 2022 we received feedback from our suppliers that PUMA missed 
some deadlines, however through better communication in 2023, our suppliers confirmed an improvement.  
FINANCIAL 
Most suppliers feel they have favourable financial terms through digital payment, the FOREVER. BETTER. 
Vendor Financing Programme and through receiving payment for samples and bulk production in a timely 
manner. PUMA International Trading and the vendors have enabled the digitisation of the supply chain 
creating transparency, operational efficiency, and reducing complexity. For example, all payments to 
vendors are automated and paper-free. 
We do not apply late penalties to our vendors, and suppliers confirmed we are flexible and accountable for 
delays. We will strengthen our communication of payment terms to suppliers. We also see opportunities to 
collaborate with our suppliers to increase their production efficiency related to style allocation, volume, 
standardisation of fabrics, labelling and packaging processes, etc. We made significant improvements in 
covering costs for compliant production compared to 2022, but suppliers also reported pressure in cost 
negotiation in 2023. Our suppliers also recognised our efforts to reduce audit duplication which benefits 
them in saving cost. 
SHARED RESPONSIBILITY 
All our suppliers recognise that sustainability is the precondition for doing business with PUMA. However, in 
2023, suppliers felt less incentivised to reach the sustainability goals compared to 2022 since we saw a 
decline in orders in the first half of the year and stabilisation during the second half. The majority of our 
suppliers acknowledge our effort to enforce our sustainability standards. 
FOREVER. BETTER. VENDOR FINANCING PROGRAMME 
The programme, established in 2016, allows suppliers with a good or very good compliance rating to benefit 
from PUMA‚Äôs high credit rating and preferred interest rates. The programme runs in partnership with IFC, 
BNP Paribas, HSBC, and Standard Chartered Bank. 
At the end of 2023, 72 vendors were registered users (compared to 71 at the end of 2022). The financed 
volumes in the full year 2023 amounted to $ 478 million (-$ 322 million compared to 2022), which reflects the 
massive interest rate and with this financing cost increases for our suppliers, who chose other sources or 
tried to avoid external financing. 
HUMAN RIGHTS RISK ASSESSMENT 
In previous years we have conducted Human Rights risk assessments at corporate and the supply chain 
level and shared the results in our 2016 and 2017 Annual Reports. In 2021 we commissioned and completed a 
Human Rights risk assessment, focusing on forced labour management in the supply chain.  


PUMA Annual Report 2023 
‚Üó Sustainability

In our Handbooks, we request our vendors to conduct due diligence. To increase transparency, we report on 
the most common audit findings, training, grievances, and mitigation measures as outcome-focused key 
performance indicators (KPIs) to track the effectiveness of our supplier programmes. 
The PUMA hotline is accessible to Civil Society Organisations (CSOs) and external stakeholders, including 
stakeholders representing vulnerable groups: women, children, migrant workers, indigenous people and 
national or ethnic, religious, and linguistic minorities. We also extend the scope of our social monitoring 
programmes to EMEA factories, high-risk countries warehouses, and to some non-core Tier 2 suppliers. 
In 2023, we conducted a review of our grievance mechanism, in line with the UNGP criteria for operational-
level grievance systems. To do this, we surveyed 14,823 workers at 45 factories in eight countries. The 
legitimacy of the PUMA hotline was acknowledged by 94% of workers, accessibility confirmed by 80% of 
participants together with 92% regarding the hotline's availability in a language they understand. 
In 2023, we developed a Civil Society Organisations (CSOs) engagement policy to engage with them 
reactively and proactively. Please refer to the Due Diligence and Risk Assessment section of this report for 
more information. 
RISKS 
The most salient risks to human rights are forced or bonded labour in the supply chain and, at the farm 
level, child labour. 
Freedom of association 
As per World Governance Indicators (WGI), PUMA‚Äôs main sourcing countries have been identified as risk 
countries on the Voice and Accountability indicator, which measures freedom of association. Social conflict 
and freedom of association breaches could be a risk due to a lack of social dialogue at factories. The risk 
could be more upstream in our supply chain when no audit programme is in place or when there is no 
monitoring programme at the raw material extraction stage. We support our core Tier 1 suppliers to set up 
effective social dialogue platforms in factories and adopt certification such as Better Cotton and the Forest 
Stewardship Council to address raw material extraction Human Rights risks.  
ILO Freedom of Association Committee has been investigating cases reported by International Trade 
Unions on allegations of retaliation, anti-union discrimination and dismissals, and the arrest and detention 
of workers for having participated in strike action, in a context where the legislative framework inadequately 
ensures the effective recognition of freedom of association, in Bangladesh and Cambodia. 
In Bangladesh and Cambodia, there were third-party complaints related to freedom of association 
(described in the grievance section). As a countermeasure, all our factories in Bangladesh and Cambodia 
are enrolled in the ILO Better Work programme, which provides advisory services and supports factory 
management to create a participation committee as a platform for social dialogue. 
Discrimination, sexual harassment, and gender-based violence 
The Global Gender Gap Index measures gender equality in 153 countries by tracking and ranking a range of 
gender-based gaps across society. East Asia is ranked as medium, while South Asia is ranked lower. While 
East Asia has been able to reduce educational gender gaps, South Asia is one of the regions where women 
are the most disadvantaged in the workplace. 
Social dialogue can be used as an effective tool to overcome the under-representation of women and 
promote gender equality at work. We support our core suppliers in setting up effective social dialogue 
platforms in factories that include women's voices. We also support them in conducting women 
empowerment training for factory workers. 


PUMA Annual Report 2023 
‚Üó Sustainability 
59 
Health and Safety 
South East Asia is prone to natural disasters, disease outbreaks, and health risks related to climate change. 
In addition, building and fire safety risks have been identified as major risks in the apparel sector, especially 
in Tier 1 and Tier 2 facilities. One of the World Health Organization‚Äôs key priorities is to strengthen 
emergency risk management for sustainable development and to promote health coverage and robust 
health systems. 
We maintain a high focus on the OHS performance of our core Tier 1 and Tier 2 factories through factory 
injury rate monitoring and OHS risk assessment training. 
Wage and benefits, living wage, and working hours 
Asian sourcing countries have been rated with low scores by the ITUC Global Rights Index.  
We support our core Tier 1 factories, with which we have direct business relationships, to provide a fair 
income for to their workforce, including all legal wages and benefits along with additional components 
which could increase workers' incomes according to fair wage assessments. We launch fair wage 
assessments and remediation in collaboration with the Fair Wage Network, for factories which fall short of 
paying a living wage and continue benchmarking all our core Tier 1 wage data through the Fair Labor 
Association (FLA) wage dashboard. 
We also conduct training on root cause analysis to strengthen working hours management at our core Tier 1 
factories, so the level of workers‚Äô income depends less on overtime hours workers. 
Child and forced labour 
As per World Governance Indicators (WGI), PUMA‚Äôs main sourcing countries have been identified as risk 
countries on Regulatory Quality (RQ) and Rule of Law (RL). The risk could be more upstream in our supply 
chain when no audit programme is in place or when there is no monitoring programme at the raw material 
extraction stage. We adopt certification to address raw material extraction and Human Rights risks such as 
Better Cotton and the Forest Stewardship Council. 
In 2021, we conducted a risk assessment on forced labour management through a third party and have 
prioritised the traceability of our supply chain as a key focus. In addition, PUMA reviewed the severity 
grading of audit findings according to ILO 11 forced labour indicators to prioritize the remediation process. 
RISK ASSESSMENT FOR NEW FACTORIES 
EiQ is a risk assessment tool for new and existing suppliers. The EiQ Sentinel service scans online and 
media sources and provides alerts for supplier controversies relating to labour, health and safety, the 
environment, business ethics and management systems. Sentinel alerts provide near-real-time monitoring 
of supply chains from public news and information sources (in English and local languages), including local 
or international media, NGO reports, government reports, worker allegations and social media platforms. 
PUMA checks the EIQ Sentinel whenever it onboards a new factory. For China, we also use the IPE 
database to check if any of the new factories have a record of environmental violations. We would then 
ensure that factories comply with PUMA standards though a social audit. In 2023, one factory was not 
onboarded due to two Sentinel alerts related to potential risks of forced labour.  
IPE violations were found in three other factories. One factory was onboarded after it improved as per PUMA 
standards and corrected its excessive daily wastewater discharge. The second factory improved and passed 
the legally required environmental assessment but could not be onboarded in 2023 since we had not 
conducted our social audit, it will be done in 2024. The third factory started production before going through 
the legally required environmental assessment and without the approval of the local authorities; they 
improved, so these violations were removed from the IPE database, but they could not be onboarded since 
we had not completed our social audit within 2023.  


PUMA Annual Report 2023 
‚Üó Sustainability 
60 
For PUMA‚Äôs existing supplier factories, 15 Sentinel cases were found as of September 2023. Eight cases 
were from factories that had already been deactivated, and thus have no production for PUMA anymore. Five 
cases were related to insufficient payments, health and safety, and waste management, which were 
addressed through remediation action and the issues were resolved. The other two cases involve allegations 
that have not been confirmed by our investigations.  
RISK ASSESSMENT FOR EXISTING FACTORIES 
In 2021, PUMA adopted ELEVATE intelligence (EiQ), a comprehensive suite of supply chain analytics, to: 
‚Ä¢ Assess our supply chain risks by country, commodity and issue 
‚Ä¢ Complete risk assessments for suppliers, factories, and sites 
‚Ä¢ Manage risks that are material to each supplier, factory or site 
In 2023, we uploaded 676 audit results (2021-2022) to the EiQ tool. This tool shows the combined risk level 
based on geography, product, and audit result. We evaluated the countermeasures we have in place in the 
factories identified as high-risk facilities in this tool. 28 factories were identified as high-risk mainly due to 
legal violations such as missing building safety permits, systematic excessive overtime or working hours 
management. 16 factories are from Tier 1 suppliers, one is a warehouse, and 11 are Tier 2 factories. All of 
them are under regular social compliance monitoring. 29% (eight) of these factories are under the ILO 
Better Work Programme which offers a factory assessment and advisory services for remediation, 21% 
(six) of these factories are covered by Worker Voice mobile app, through which workers can raise their 
concerns to factory management (such concerns are escalated to PUMA when factories do not respond 
timeously). This mobile app has also the functions to conduct workers survey and launch e-learnings for 
workers. We also provided Root Causes Analysis training for 25% (seven) of the factories. One supplier in 
China has been going through a capacity building programme since 2022 at PUMA‚Äôs expense to strengthen 
its management system. In 2023 we saw a significant improvement as per the consultant company Elevate, 
which we further explained as a case study.  
In 2023, 75% (21 out of 28) of factories improved. Measures included obtaining building safety or fire safety 
certificates, installing sufficient fire safety equipment, and ensuring that emergency exits were 
unobstructed. Some factories improved working hours management after they joined the Root Cause 
Analysis training that we provided or paid back insufficient overtime compensation. As a result, these 21 
factories are no longer considered as high-risk. The four other factories are still implementing their 
improvement plan and working to obtain legally mandated certificates and improve working hours 
management. Three out of four factories have already joined ILO Better Work; for the one factory which is 
outside of scope of ILO Better Work, we expect them to remedy the critical violations by 2024. The other 
three factories are to be deactivated. 
In 2023, PUMA‚Äôs Supply Chain Sustainability Team added one full-time staff member in Brazil. We now have 
local team members in nearly all high-risk sourcing countries to support the implementation of our 
standards. In Pakistan, with the launch of the Better Work programme, we have registered all factories in 
scope to mitigate risks. We plan to add one full-time staff member to support Bangladesh and Pakistan in 
2024. For the rest of the high-risk countries such as the Philippines, Mexico, or South Africa, we do not have 
a local team member due to the total number of suppliers being less than ten. For these locations, we 
work with third-party auditing firms to conduct regular social compliance audits. 
Based on all these actions, we aim to mitigate the risks identified through this risk assessment. 
WORKERS SURVEY  
In 2020, PUMA launched the Worker Survey Programme to get workers‚Äô feedback in eight countries and to 
assess their satisfaction with the factory work environment through a mobile survey app.   
PUMA operates multiple worker voice channels. The third-party worker engagement platforms cover 89 
suppliers and 201,579 workers. 29 non-strategic factories in three countries (Bangladesh, Vietnam and 


PUMA Annual Report 2023 
‚Üó Sustainability 
61 
China) also used the platforms in 2023. To review the design and efficiency of PUMA‚Äôs grievance system as 
per the criteria of the UN Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights, we collected feedback 
from factory workers in 2023.  
The UN Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights set the following criteria to assess the 
effectiveness of non-judicial operational-level grievance mechanisms: legitimacy, accessibility, 
predictability, equitability, transparency, rights-compatibility, a source of continuous learning, and based on 
engagement and dialogue. In 2023, to assess our hotline against these criteria, we surveyed 14,823 workers 
at 45 factories in China, Cambodia, Vietnam, Indonesia, the Philippines, Turkey, Pakistan and Brazil. 
‚Ä¢ Legitimacy (enabling trust from the hotline users): 94% of workers agreed they can trust the PUMA hotline 
‚Ä¢ Accessibility (no barrier to access for users): 80% of workers know where to find the PUMA hotline 
phone numbers and email, and 92% confirmed it is available in a language they understand 
‚Ä¢ Predictability (users are clear on the procedure): 75% of workers responded that they know what the 
complaint procedure is and 90% understand their complaint will be investigated  
‚Ä¢ Transparency (keeping parties informed about progress on the issue): 91% of workers with unresolved 
complaints (at the time they responded to the survey) said they were aware of the status of their cases 
The Rights-compatibility criteria (ensuring that outcomes and remedies accord with internationally 
recognised human rights) was not evaluated. We shall assess it in the future. 
The survey results also showed that workers in Brazilian factories did not know where to find the PUMA 
hotline, nor did they understand the procedure (only 25% responded positive). As a follow-up action, we will 
conduct further training for workers in Brazil about our grievance mechanism and translate our video 
material that explains the PUMA hotline procedure into Portuguese in 2024. 
Lastly, to evaluate the effectiveness of remedial action, workers were asked systematically whether their 
complaints were resolved. Of the 15% of surveyed workers who had used the hotline, 65% said they had filed 
a complaint, with a complaint resolution rate of 96%.

dialogue. For equitability, we are seeking to ensure that complainants can access a network of public and 
private organisations or services to engage through the PUMA hotline on fair, informed and respectful 
terms. In 2024, we plan to map local relevant organisations and institutions together with our suppliers, to 
identify and share contacts of emergency care, psychological support or the judicial system, for any factory 
worker in need who has raised a complaint.

From 2021 onwards we have used Gallup‚Äôs methodology to define the sample of production workers of each factory, based on 
a 95% confidence interval and a margin of error of plus or minus 5%.   
 
WOMEN‚ÄôS EMPOWERMENT 
Training women about their rights and empowering them to advance their careers is key to achieving 
gender equality, where both men and women have equal power and opportunities for education, healthcare, 
economic participation and personal development.  
60% of workers producing PUMA goods are women and 50% of factory managerial positions at our core Tier 1 
suppliers are filled by women. PUMA initiatives support suppliers in reviewing existing policies and practices 
or establishing new ones for women‚Äôs empowerment. We believe that collaboration within the industry and 
with NGO experts in women‚Äôs empowerment is key to avoid duplication and provide the right expertise. 
Since 2021, the accumulated participants of sexual harassment prevention training amounts to 222,933 
workers, accounting for more than 148,642 training hours. 
In 2023, we expanded the e-learning course on Sexual Harassment Prevention at the Workplace via Micro 
Benefits to 50,478 workers in 37 factories in China and Vietnam. Another 4,418 workers at eight factories in 
Cambodia and Indonesia completed the Better Work e-learning course on Discrimination and Elimination of 
Violence and Harassment at Work via the mobile phone app WOVO, covering 51% of employees in these 
factories.  
China‚Äôs textile and apparel industry employs approximately 20 million people, over 60% of them female, 
comprising many domestic migrants at the age of marriage, childbirth, or childcare. These workers have 
limited education in personal development, childbirth and family care, and often must juggle their work at 
the same time. Therefore, the China National Textile and Apparel Council (CNTAC) has launched the 
initiative to build Family-Friendly Factories in the Chinese textile and apparel industry. This initiative is 
supported by UN Women and UNICEF. In 2023, we partnered with CNTAC, piloting the Family-Friendly 
Factories project at three core Tier 1 factories with 5,566 workers in total.  
The programme‚Äôs objectives are: 
‚Ä¢ Understand how Chinese textile and apparel companies implement family-friendly policies, as well as 
their challenges in implementing a gender equality system   
‚Ä¢ Develop guidance for these companies to promote family-friendly policies at the workplace 
‚Ä¢ Assist pilot companies in establishing family-friendly mechanisms in line with their existing human 
resources management system 
‚Ä¢ Promote and pilot best practices across the industry 


PUMA Annual Report 2023 
‚Üó Sustainability

In 2023, CNTAC conducted an onsite baseline assessment at three PUMA factories through workers surveys 
and interviews about their perception of their factory‚Äôs current policies and practices, and their challenges 
regarding family care. The project team also trained 207 workers (73% female) on gender equality, family-
friendly policies, work-life balance, and parent-child education. The three factories were provided with an 
improvement plan to review their internal policies. PUMA‚Äôs Sustainability Team is working closely with them 
to implement these improvement plans by the end of 2024. 
PUMA encourages suppliers to join the ILO Better Work programme. The Better Work‚Äôs factory 
improvement process includes three integrated services: assessments, follow-up advisory services and 15 
training days per year. In 2023, 32 management staff (72% female participants), from 17 factories in 
Bangladesh, Cambodia, Indonesia and Vietnam joined 19 training sessions on topics including gender 
equality, sexual harassment and prevention of discrimination and gender.  
The World Benchmarking Alliance (WBA)‚ÄâGender Benchmark evaluates 112 of 
the largest apparel, food and agriculture companies globally on their 
responsibility to drive and promote gender equality in their entire value chain. 
In the 2023 Gender Benchmark PUMA ranked eighth out of 112 companies and 
sixth in the apparel sector with a score of 43.5 out of 100. 2023 was the first 
time PUMA participated in the Gender Benchmark.  
SUPPLIER SCORECARD 
In 2023, PUMA conducted calls with 58 core Tier 1 factories to review the social scorecards for each of their 
factories performance as of end of 2022, which included: 
‚Ä¢ Audit rating 
‚Ä¢ Participation in supplementary worker voice tools offered by third parties 
‚Ä¢ Workers‚Äô training on women‚Äôs empowerment/sexual harassment 
‚Ä¢ Factory's injury rate compared to PUMA core Tier 1 factories‚Äô average rate and 2023 goals 
‚Ä¢ Factory's average weekly overtime hours vs. PUMA core Tier 1 factories‚Äô average 
‚Ä¢ Factory‚Äôs fair wage performance compared to living wage benchmark 
‚Ä¢ Whether the factory has freely elected worker representatives against 2025 goals 
During these meetings, we reviewed the scorecard and discussed next steps to address identified gaps. 
Most suppliers agreed with the scorecard and the action plan to achieve PUMA‚Äôs 2025 sustainability targets: 
‚Ä¢ Worker voice: 57 out of 58 factories are covered by third-party worker voice platforms (mobile app) and 
one supplier in Brazil was added to PUMA‚Äôs 2023 strategic partner list. We discussed launching a third-
party worker engagement platform. Some suppliers shared their concerns about the functionality 
of third-party worker engagement platforms, we are looking into it to further improve or find an 
alternative. 
‚Ä¢ Fair wage: The discussion was based on the factories 2021 wage data; three factories were suggested to 
conduct a Fair Wage Assessment as their wage level is below the industry or GLWC benchmark, which 
was conducted in 2023.  
‚Ä¢ Women‚Äôs empowerment: Except for our new strategic supplier in Brazil, the rest of our core suppliers 
provided sexual harassment prevention training to workers after the managerial staff had been trained 
by PUMA. In 2023, 41 out of 58 factories continued the sexual harassment e-learning via the third-party 
worker engagement platforms, and three Chinese factories joined a pilot led by CNTAC on promoting 
gender equity. 
‚Ä¢ Worker representation: During these meetings, we encouraged 20 factories which had not freely elected 
workers‚Äô representatives, to either join the ILO Better Work programme, which help suppliers to set up a 
Worker-Management Committee or join PUMA‚Äôs programme when the factory is not under the scope of 
Better Work. Four of them joined the Better Work programme in 2023 or will join in 2024. In 2023, 
PUMA‚Äôs Sustainability Team members in China, Vietnam, Bangladesh and Indonesia had been trained by 
Timeline Consultancy, a China-based consultancy company, on guiding factories not in scope of the 


PUMA Annual Report 2023 
‚Üó Sustainability 
64 
Better Work programme to have freely elected worker representatives and to build a dialogue 
mechanism. The 16 factories agreed to join PUMA‚Äôs Worker Representation Programme. 
SOCIAL COMPLIANCE 
PUMA‚Äôs Code of Conduct is an integral part of our supply contracts. All PUMA suppliers sign a legally 
binding ‚ÄúDeclaration of Principles‚Äù to comply with the PUMA Code of Conduct. PUMA requires all vendors, 
their subcontractors, and their suppliers to comply with this Code of Conduct, as well as PUMA‚Äôs Social and 
OHS handbooks. These compliance expectations are verified through regular audits. The frequency of audits 
is based on a factory‚Äôs previous audit results: A-graded factories are re-audited after 24 months, B+ after 
18 months, B- after 12 months and C-graded after six months. Warehouses graded A, B+, B- are re-audited 
after 24 months, C-grade after 12 months and D after six months. For factories with a D grade, including 
Better Work Factories, Zero Tolerance (ZT) issues need to be corrected between two and six months. 
Potential new factories will not be authorised to produce PUMA products until the factory can be rated 
A or B. Regardless of the factory grade, all issues identified during audits need to be remediated as part of a 
corrective action plan. 
Since 1999, all direct PUMA factories (Tier 1) have been frequently audited for compliance with the ILO Core 
Conventions and basic environmental standards. Each year we collect between 300 and 500 audits or 
assessment reports issued through PUMA‚Äôs compliance programme, the ILO Better Work Programme, our 
industry peers‚Äô compliance programmes or independent experts accredited by the Social and Labour 
Convergence Programme (SLCP). We have also included our most relevant material and component 
suppliers (Tier 2) and key priority warehouses in our audit programme. Through collaborative efforts with 
the sourcing team, we mapped more than 200 non-core Tier 2 suppliers in 2022. While one-third use FEM 
(Facility Environmental Module) for other brands, only 13 have had a social audit. We converted these audit 
reports in our grading system. In 2023, we reminded all suppliers that the use of undeclared sub-
contractors is a Zero Tolerance issue, as per PUMA standards. We asked them to self-declare their Tier 1 
subcontractors used for PUMA production. 66 Tier 1 subcontractors were declared, 26 (19 for the first time) 
had an audit report that we converted into PUMA‚Äòs grading system. 
In 2023, 454 Tier 1 suppliers, 92 Tier 2 suppliers and three warehouses were audited. 581 audit reports from 
these 549 factories were collected to safeguard workers‚Äô rights to more than half a million workers 
(656,473).  
All PUMA suppliers are required to display our Code of Conduct in factories producing PUMA products, 
materials or components. This contains the contact details of the PUMA Sustainability Team as a whistle-
blower hotline. The number of grievances received and solved, as well as the most frequent type of 
grievances are shared in this report. 
Furthermore, PUMA is a member of the Fair Labor Association, which regularly audits and accredits 
PUMA‚Äôs compliance programme for compliance with the Fair Labor Association‚Äôs Code of Conduct. This 
ensures that PUMA has the systems and procedures in place to successfully uphold fair labour standards 
throughout its supply chains and mitigate and remediate violations. As an FLA member, PUMA has agreed 
to subject our supply chain to independent assessments and monitoring as part of an organisational 
commitment to upholding fair labour standards through transparency. FLA publishes the results of these 
assessments to encourage an open and honest dialogue about the conditions that workers face, ensure 
PUMA‚Äôs accountability, and help consumers make more informed decisions about the products they buy. 
View the public assessment results here: PUMA, SE ‚Äì Fair Labor Association. 
A comprehensive explanation of our compliance programme for suppliers (including grievance mechanisms 
and case studies) can be found in our Sustainability Handbook for Social Standards. Our Social Handbook 
explains the procedure for factory monitoring programmes (section 3) and our standards. This handbook is 
reviewed on a regular basis and our suppliers receive regular training on our standards and monitoring 
process. We launched the e-learning via Elevate‚Äôs EiQ Learning platform in April 2023. All suppliers were 


PUMA Annual Report 2023 
‚Üó Sustainability 
65 
invited to complete the training course. 1,035 participants from 557 factories passed the e-learning in 2023, 
representing 85% of PUMA‚Äôs active factories. 
PUMA‚Äôs supplier factory list is disclosed on our website. It includes details such as the factory name, 
address, product category, headcount range, the percentage of female workers, percentage of foreign 
migrant workers and freely elected worker representation. PUMA also publishes its factory list in the Open 
Supply Hub platform. 
AUDIT PROCESS  
Our audit starts with briefing the factory management and worker or union representatives on PUMA 
standards, the audit process and its scope. In 2023, 94% of the audits conducted included a trade union 
representative or workers‚Äô representative during the audit‚Äôs opening and closing meetings (when closing 
meetings take place during factory working hours).  
We have a team of compliance experts in all our major sourcing regions who regularly visit our core 
manufacturing partners. We work with external compliance auditors and with the ILO‚Äôs Better Work 
Programme. Each PUMA supplier factory must undergo a regular compliance audit every six to 24 months 
based on their audit rating and all issues identified need to be remedied as part of a corrective action plan. 
Interviews with workers, workers‚Äô representatives or union representatives are crucial for understanding 
workers‚Äô perspectives on workplace standards, the atmosphere at factories and protecting vulnerable 
workers from any work that is likely to cause harm. All interviews with workers are conducted on-site (no 
offsite interviews). 
Around 79% of active factories were audited in 2023. Factories not audited in 2023 either had an audit that was 
still valid because of their grading, were waiting for Better Work assessment or were located in Ukraine. 
To avoid duplication and prevent auditing fatigue, in 2023, we increased the percentage of shared 
assessments to 67% (59% in 2022). We will further increase our use of SLCP-based assessments 
to 350 factories in 2024. We believe that SLCP is an ideal tool for building long-term relationships with 
suppliers and supporting them to take ownership of their social and labour data. PUMA is a member of the 
ILO Better Work Programme and uses Better Work assessment reports in lieu of the PUMA compliance 
programme. PUMA also uses FLA-accredited brands' reports as well as some other brands‚Äô audit reports in 
lieu of the PUMA compliance programme. We aim to use external reports converted to PUMA standards for 
up to 80% of our factories by the end of 2025.

AUDIT RESULTS AND FINDINGS 
In 2023, we continued following up and training the factories with low performance; as a result, 67 factories 
were upgraded to A or B+. 144 factories were audited for the first time in 2023 as per our strategy to 
increase local-for-local production and to scale up our social monitoring programme to non-core Tier 
2 suppliers (11) and Tier 1 sub-contractors (19).  
In total, 36 factories failed the audit, (31 Tier 1, five Tier 2); 14 were deactivated due to low performance. Five 
were re-audited in 2023 and passed the audit; 17 factories will be re-audited in 2024 since they have six 
months to improve. 19 out of 36 were new factories, 12 factories were not onboarded so we did not enter into 
any business relationship with them, four were re-audited and improved to a passing grade, the three other 
factories (two non-core Tier 2, one retail furniture supplier) were audited for the first time in 2023 as we 
expanded our audit scope; they all committed to improve and they will be re-audited in 2024.   
Out of the 11 factories graded D in 2023, seven factories were deactivated. Four are still active as at the end 
of 2023, as progress is on-going. Two out of these four D-graded factories had Zero Tolerance issues on 
transparency and payment below minimum wage which were uncovered in late 2023. They corrected these 
issues within 2023, as one paid back minimum wages. The other factory stopped subcontracting home 
workers, recruited workers and communicated their policy change to all managerial staff and workers; 
several critical issues are still under remediation and should be corrected in 2024. For the other two D-
graded factories, since the factory management submitted reliable corrective action plans, we will follow up 
on the remediation by mid-2024.

standards, which helped newly onboarded suppliers to better understand our expectations. As a result, the 
pass rate of newly onboarded suppliers in 2023 was 4% higher than in 2022 (2023: 87%; 2022: 83%). 
Working hours management: In 2022 we provided working hours management training for all Tier 1 
factories. A root cause analysis workshop was held with selected core suppliers in both 2022 and 2023 to 
explore opportunities for improvement. Factory management reviewed and strengthened their policy and 
working hours monitoring system. They gained a deep understanding of how to conduct a root 
cause analysis. We developed an action plan to address prioritised root causes of overtime hours. We 
noticed improvements as there was a decrease in the number of audit findings in systematic excessive 
overtime (reduced by 4.6%), overtime compensation (reduced by 3.2%), and working hours management 
(reduced by 0.6%). We notice a decrease in the average overtime hours at our core Tier 1 factories compared 
to 2022 from 7.7 to 5.3 hours in 2023, but it can be due to a decrease of our order book due to 2023 global 
macroeconomic situation, which led to a change in customers' ordering behaviour. 
Wages and overtime: Among issues related to wages and/or overtime, 31% of the corrective actions were 
implemented and these issues were resolved in 2023, which is 20% higher than the 11% rate in 2022. We 
expect more progress in 2024 as 31% of audits were conducted at the end of 2023, these factories involved 
will receive a follow-up audit in 2024 to validate their improvements.  
Social security: 100% of workers are covered under social security among all our core Tier 1 suppliers, 
except in China where this is the case for 80.4% of workers. We plan to further explore how to support 
suppliers to remedy those issues via in-person workshops in 2024. Improving working hours management, 
following up with suppliers to obtain legal permits, and increasing social security coverage will continue to 
be a focus of our efforts.  
Transparency: Four transparency issues were found in 2023. One new factory with one transparency issue 
along with other violations such as insufficient benefits and several OHS findings was not onboarded as a 
PUMA supplier; two factories with one transparency issue each provided consistent records for review after 
we emphasised PUMA‚Äôs zero tolerance policy on transparency. These records were verified by PUMA. One 
transparency issue in one factory detected in late 2023 remains open; we will follow up in early 2024. 
Freedom of association: The four open issues related to Freedom of association identified in 2022 were all 
closed through follow-up with the management or under the Better Work programme. Five audit findings 
related to Freedom of Association breaches were identified in 2023, such as the dismissal or poor treatment 
of union members and delayed union elections. As of today, three issues were closed; one is still open 
as there is an on-going mediation process between the management and trade union workers; the other 
issue remains open, and concerns the factory HR manager taking dual leadership roles in 
both management and union. This factory is working with Better Work Vietnam for remediation. 
Women‚Äôs rights: PUMA is committed to respecting women‚Äôs rights as per the Convention on the Elimination 
of Discrimination Against Women and expects suppliers to commit to and respect women‚Äôs rights. In this 
context, we carefully monitor working conditions for women. In 2023, we identified 38 women-related audit 
findings about missing benefits for nursing workers, unadopted conditions for pregnant workers or toilets 
not maintained in clean and sanitary conditions. 15 of them were closed through follow-up with the factories 
or via the Better Work programme, three findings will not be followed-up on because the factories 
have been deactivated, 20 are still under remediation and are being followed-up. One violation was related 
to unvoluntary overtime and has been corrected as per a Better Work progress report.  
Freedom of movement: One audit finding was identified related to restricted freedom of movement. As a 
result, the factory management issued warning letters to all relevant supervisors and conducted training to 
avoid similar situations in future. We will verify these actions onsite in 2024. No case was found related to 
workers' passports nor other identity and personal documents being retained. 


PUMA Annual Report 2023 
‚Üó Sustainability 
69 
Wage payments: We identified 16 violations regarding delayed wage payments, 12 of them were closed; two 
findings will not be followed-up because the factories were deactivated; for the two open findings, one 
factory is working with Better Work on remediation, and another factory took appropriate actions so no 
wage payments will be delayed. We will verify that proper actions were taken on-site in 2024.  
Beyond auditing, we track social key performance indicators such as average payments vs. minimum wage 
payments, overtime hours or coverage by collective bargaining agreements. This data is reported 
under the Fair Income target section. 
SUPPLIER TRAINING 
To ensure that our suppliers understand the requirements set by PUMA as well as international due 
diligence regulation and standards in the garment and footwear industry, PUMA organised multiple training 
sessions in 2023, including: 
‚Ä¢ In-person or virtual suppliers round tables to share updates on PUMA standards and industry 
best practices, elaborate on the German Due Diligence Supply Chain Act by industry experts; CNTAC in 
China and VITAS in Vietnam. 
‚Ä¢ Training factory management on Accident Prevention and Reporting, who will then support us to achieve 
the goal of training 100,000 workers on this subject. 
‚Ä¢ Root cause analysis training for strategic suppliers, so that they can develop corrective actions to resolve 
their audit findings by addressing their root causes. 
‚Ä¢ Customised e-learning on Social Standards, to help suppliers, especially those newly onboarded, to 
better understand PUMA's expectations. 
‚Ä¢ PUMA‚Äôs expectations to suppliers regarding our Code of Ethics. 
We launched the e-learning via Elevate‚Äôs EiQ Learn platform in April 2023, and all suppliers were invited to 
complete the training. 1,035 participants from 557 factories passed the e-learning in 2023, representing 85% 
of PUMA‚Äôs active factories. We plan to add this e-learning to PUMA‚Äôs website, which will allow users, new 
factories and workers, to access the course at any time.

‚Üó CASE STUDIES 
Capacity Building in China 
With Elevate as a partner, a one-year capacity building programme was carried out to help the 
supplier and its factory staff to identify key gaps in the factory‚Äôs management system and provide 
them with a toolkit and expertise to drive sustainability-related improvements. Through top 
management commitment, training and capacity building, regular review of metrics and impact 
assessments, the factory understood the importance of being transparent with PUMA; established a 
proper grievance mechanism, established an effective working time recording system; started to use 
internal inspection tools to manage CSR performance independently and corrected most (91.7%) of 
the EHS findings. 
To further improve it was recommended that the factory should enhance compensation and benefits 
payment systems, conduct follow-up investigations of workers‚Äô suggestions and have a proper 
mechanism to answer these suggestions.  
 
GRIEVANCE CHANNELS 
PUMA works towards providing access to functioning grievance channels throughout its supply chain. 
Where we do not have direct operations, we seek out partners who can run such complaints mechanisms, 
according to the UN Guiding Principles. At the cotton farm level, the Better Cotton Grievance procedure 
provides a system for anyone, including third parties, who engages with its activities, people or programmes 
to raise a complaint relating to any aspect of Better Cotton and its activities. 
We operate multiple worker voice channels to reach more than half a million workers at our Tier 1 and core 
Tier 2 factories. If workers are not satisfied with the responses offered by the factories via their respective 
internal grievance system, we encourage them to use the PUMA hotline to raise complaints or request 
consultations. Hotline contact details are published on our Code of Conduct posters, displayed at every 
audited factory globally. We also use WeChat, Zalo, Facebook and other social media channels to connect 
with workers and have established more formalised compliance and human resources apps at selected core 
suppliers. 
The third-party worker engagement platforms cover 89 factories (201,579 workers), which represents more 
than 80% of our production volume. In 2023, 1,544 feedback messages were received through the 
MicroBenefits and the WOVO platforms in China, Indonesia, Pakistan, Philippines, Turkey, Cambodia and 
Vietnam, as well as the Amader Kotha Helpline in Bangladesh. Of the 1,544 messages, 41 cases were 
escalated to PUMA as the factory did not respond within the 48-hour timeline. PUMA engaged with the 
factories‚Äô management to address workers‚Äô concerns. All other concerns not escalated to PUMA were 
handled and resolved directly by the suppliers. 
In 2023, we engaged with a local hotline, Hamari Awaz who will provide all workers in factories producing 
for PUMA in Pakistan with access to a local hotline in early 2024. 
In 2023, 107 workers‚Äô concerns were raised through PUMA‚Äôs hotline across eight countries. Together with 
our suppliers, our team was able to resolve all these cases.

In 2023, to meet its obligations under the German Act on Corporate Due Diligence Obligations in Supply 
Chains (LkSG), PUMA published its Rules for the Complaint Procedure. PUMA‚Äôs own employees and the 
employees of PUMA‚Äôs business partners can submit complaints in connection with human rights or 
environmental risks and violations, as well as violations of PUMA policies via the following channels: 
‚Ä¢ PUMA‚Äôs electronic whistleblowing platform 
‚Ä¢ Telephone numbers of the PUMA Sustainability Team (‚ÄúPUMA Hotline‚Äù)   
‚Ä¢ Third-party platforms made available to factory workers by the factories  
Complaints may be made anonymously and all information regarding the complaint is treated as strictly 
confidential and only shared on a need-to-know basis or if required by law. All complaints received are 
acknowledged within seven days and PUMA shall conduct a comprehensive investigation without delay. 
PUMA will also share the outcome of the investigation with the party making the complaint.  
PUMA shall review the effectiveness of its complaint procedure at least once a year, or on an adhoc basis if 
PUMA expects a significant change or increase in risk exposure in PUMA‚Äôs own operations and at PUMA‚Äôs 
business partners. We aim to translate the Rules for the Complaint Procedure into 40 languages in 2024 to 
ensure it is accessible for end users in PUMA‚Äôs supply chain.

The most frequent areas of concern raised by workers remain as fair compensation, their employment 
relationship, and excessive working hours. Most workers‚Äô concerns about wages and benefits are mainly 
due to their misunderstanding of wage and benefit calculations. We asked factories to proactively talk to and 
train workers on wage and benefits' calculation methods. Regarding the employment relationship topic, 
many cases are about workers wishing to resign without following the legally required notice period. 
We asked factory management to discuss solutions with their employees.  
In any country, when workers complain about working during public holidays or overtime hours, PUMA 
would engage with factory management, to adjust the production schedule and to make sure overtime is 
voluntary and properly communicated with workers. Furthermore, PUMA provided training to these 
factories on working hours management, and overtime root cause analysis to prevent excessive overtime. 
Below is a case study of the PUMA Hotline, which explains how we followed-up with our supplier to close 
the single remaining open case of 2022.

‚Üó CASE STUDIES 
PUMA Hotline 
A worker from a footwear factory in Vietnam called the PUMA Hotline in September 2022 regarding 
the subsidies sponsored by the government according to the Resolution No. 68/NQ-CP dated on 
July 1
st, 2021. Under this regulation, employees who were under contract suspension or termination, 
or unpaid leave between May 1
st, 2021 and December 31
st 2021, and pregnant or taking care of children 
under six years old are entitled to one of government subsidies. The complainant submitted all the 
necessary documents to the factory to apply for this government subsidy but did not receive 
any updates. 
PUMA immediately contacted the factory. The factory explained that due to being busy with Covid 
prevention measures and high levels of absenteeism in January 2022, they missed the deadline to 
submit the documents to the local authority. In total 2,032 workers failed to receive a total amount of 
about $ 115,000. Despite the factory‚Äôs efforts to follow-up with the local authority for the payment, 
there was no positive response.  
 
PUMA encouraged the factory to discuss with the Trade Union representatives to find a solution. In 
July 2023, the Trade Union and the factory reached a consensus so the factory would pay 70% of the 
subsidy, $ 78,388 to make up for the unpaid subsidy. PUMA verified that an instalment of about 
$ 77,181 were paid to workers in 2023. A few workers could not be paid ($ 1,207) as they had left the 
factory. We are still engaged with the factory management regarding the remaining 30%.  
 
THIRD PARTY COMPLAINTS 
We continued following-up on the six open third-party complaints in 2022. Five related to freedom of 
association were resolved through active engagement with factories, union and other stakeholders, with 
union representatives reinstated or compensated in agreement with the unions involved. One of these five 
cases was settled in collaboration with the Fair Labor Association and other brands, more details can be 
found in case study below. Another complaint is about workers‚Äô wages in Mauritius, which was followed-up 
under the umbrella of the Fair Labor Association and in collaboration with other brands: migrant workers in 
Mauritius received less than a minimum wage after the dormitory fees were deducted from their salary. 
Based on the inspection report of local labor authority the practice is legal. In 2024 we will continuously 
engage with the FLA and other stakeholders to find a collective solution. 
In 2023, we received 15 third-party complaints from external organisations, 11 of which have been resolved.  
Nine cases were related to freedom of association breaches, eight out of these nine cases were resolved 
through active engagement with factories, unions and other stakeholders. The union representatives were 
either reinstated or compensated in agreement with the unions involved. One case is still going through the 
mediation process between management and the trade union.  
Three cases involved wage and benefits issues; one of them is the request from the Bangladesh Union 
Federation to provide support on their minimum wage demands. Upon receipt, PUMA actively engaged with 
ILO Better Work and the Fair Labor Association. We published our Position on our website, and co-signed a 
letter to the prime minister with other brands, through Fair Labor Association in November, to support 
trade unions. Another two wage and benefits cases are still under investigation.  
Two cases relate to NGO reports on working conditions for supply chain workers in Pakistan and Cambodia. 
For both reports we engaged with ILO Better Work and the reporters. Details are provided under Pakistan 
and Cambodia paragraphs below.

In May 2023, a trade union requested the dismissal of two managers at a factory in Cambodia because they 
thought they were responsible for the reduction of orders, among other concerns. The management and 
union had several meetings to discuss the concerns. The management accepted all the trade union‚Äôs 
concerns and took action, except for the dismissal of the two factory managers, which the trade union 
agreed to retract.   
Pakistan 
In 2023, Labour Behind the Label published a Report on labour rights in Pakistan regarding issues such as 
no payment of living wage, no employment contract, leave being denied or unpaid, child labour, no social 
security, harassment, health and safety issues, fire safety risks and freedom of association breaches. 
PUMA has investigated the details of the report and engaged with the reporters to understand the 
methodology used. The report relates to factories located in Karachi, Faisalabad, and Lahore. While PUMA 
does not have a business relationship with any suppliers in these regions, our subsidiary stichd, does have a 
business relationship with four factories in this region, two of which are included in the report. 
Three out of the four factories in the mentioned areas were audited in 2023, while one factory was audited in 
2021 with a rating still valid in 2023. As a follow-up in 2023, PUMA conducted a full unannounced 
assessment of all four factories through a different third-party company. As a result, three of the factories 
were downgraded. We are closely following up on progress to address these newly identified violations 
and all factories producing PUMA products that fall within the scope of the Better Work programme are now 
enrolled in the Better Work programme. Additionally, all workers of factories producing for PUMA in 
Pakistan will have access to a local hotline, Hamari Awaz. 
Better Work Pakistan will also provide a social dialogue programme, as well as leadership capacity building 
initiatives and training for female workers. Other services will include the ILO‚Äôs occupational health and 
safety approaches, a factory improvement toolkit and productivity focused training. Additionally, PUMA 
signed the ACCORD Pakistan in March 2023 for all factories producing PUMA and stichd products. 
Cambodia 
In 2022 we received five complaints concerning three Cambodian factories, about potential breach of 
freedom of association rights. Three were resolved in 2022 and two in early 2023. We worked to find the best 
solution related to these concerns, facilitating mediation meetings between workers‚Äô representatives and 
factory management, partnering with Better Work Factories Cambodia and/or with other brands producing 
in the same factories. It took three to five months to solve these complaints.  
Despite all our efforts, we received five complaints about freedom of association from Cambodia in 2023. 
Four cases were resolved through open dialogue and facilitated mediation meetings between factories and 
unions. One case is still under mediation or investigation.   
We continued to work with Better Factories Cambodia (BFC) and hosted a training series from April to 
August 2023 for all Cambodian factories producing PUMA products. 183 participants from 27 factories‚Äô 
management teams, shop stewards and union representatives attended the training. As a lesson learned 
from training conducted in 2021, we added one exclusive session for factory decision-makers in Chinese in 
addition to a session conducted in Khmer for workers representatives and trade union leaders.  
The aim of the training was to provide participants with a better understanding of: 
‚Ä¢ Rights and obligations of the employer, unions and worker representatives  
‚Ä¢ Managing communication and employment contract termination such as: resignation, dismissal, and 
retrenchment.  


PUMA Annual Report 2023

As per the BFC feedback, as result of the training participants confirmed they gained a better understanding 
about Freedom of Association and their roles and responsibilities. All 27 factories submitted a Corrective 
Action Plan after the training. We will verify the implementation of each action plan in early 2024 according 
to the five KPIs established by BFC. They are described below: 
1. Conduct regular meetings between the employer, union and shop stewards to raise and address any 
concerns in the workplace on weekly/biweekly/monthly basis. 
2. Develop/review a Freedom of Association (FoA) policy in consultation with the unions and shop stewards 
and implement this policy accordingly. 
3. Develop/review a Grievance Handling policy in consultation with the unions and shop stewards and 
implement this policy accordingly. 
4. Develop/review a policy for Employment Contract Termination in consultation with the unions and shop 
stewards and implement this policy accordingly. 
5. Provide internal/external training to more workers on relevant topics such as the roles and 
responsibilities of the employers, unions and shop stewards. 
In September 2023, the NGO Action Aid published an investigative report alleging that garment factories in 
Cambodia, supplying apparel and footwear to companies (including PUMA), reduced monthly wages 
compared to 2020 levels and failed to pay sufficient severance when the factories closed due to the COVID-19 
lockdown. The report, which interviewed 308 garment workers in 15 factories, also claimed that workers 
were unable to afford necessities even after the COVID-19 lockdown restrictions were lifted due to lower 
wages and fewer overtime hours, while overtime pay became a systemic dependency. 
Following the report, PUMA engaged with the Clean Clothes Campaign (CCC) and Action Aid to understand 
the methodology behind the allegations that were made. For PUMA, the allegations relate to six of PUMA‚Äôs 
suppliers, two of which PUMA had ended the business relationship with by mutual agreement in 2021. After 
further investigation, PUMA did not identify any wage gap as per the government‚Äôs instructions during the 
lockdown period in the remaining four factories. Although ‚Äúno work, no pay‚Äù directives were in effect, PUMA 
ensured that workers would receive a regular income during 2021 lockdown through regular communication 
with our suppliers in collaboration with our sourcing team. 
Between 2019 and 2022, Cambodia represented around 13% of PUMA‚Äôs total sourcing volume. In 2020 and 
2021, PUMA focused on keeping suppliers in business and safeguarding workers‚Äô health, employment, and 
income through several measures including: minimizing order cancellations (0.35% of orders were 
cancelled in 2020) and expanding our PUMA Vendor Financing Programme, with an increase in suppliers' 
participation from 21% in 2019 to 30% in 2020. As a responsible business partner for our suppliers, PUMA set 
up a responsible purchasing practices policy and engaged with Better Buying, an independent non-profit 
organisation, to collect feedback from our core suppliers related to our purchasing practices. We reported 
the key findings of the Better Buying survey in this report.

‚Üó CASE STUDIES 
Indonesia 
On July 7
th, 2023, PUMA received complaints from a union related to union staff members at one of 
PUMA‚Äôs footwear suppliers who were terminated based on not passing their probation period. The 
union mentioned that the termination was considered illegal since it was without prior notice and no 
evaluation was performed by a respective supervisor and section manager. The union believed that 
this happened due to their union membership. The union leaders asked PUMA to support the 
reinstatement of the three workers. On July 13
th, 2023, PUMA investigated and interviewed the factory 
management and union representatives. PUMA found that the termination of the three union 
members was not legal since there was no clear performance assessment from the respective of the 
section heads. This was explained to factory management who agreed to re-instate the three 
workers to the same position with the same wage. No wages were deducted for the period when the 
workers were laid off. The union leader acknowledged PUMA‚Äôs engagement in this case and 
recognised our commitment to respect freedom of association.  
 
Madagascar 
In June 2022, PUMA received a request from IndustriALL
‚Äôs Sub-Saharan Africa regional office to 
support one of their trade union affiliates called SEMPIZOF in Madagascar. According to IndustriAll, 
about 350 machinists went on strike in a factory producing for PUMA and other brands from May 18
th 
to 25
th, 2022 to protest on wages and unfair skills‚Äô assessments for experienced workers. The strikers 
also denounced sexual harassment against female workers and bribery during recruitment. 
SEMPIZOF approached the Labour Inspectorate and Labour Tribunal with another IndustriALL 
affiliate SVS to request the reinstatement of 50 workers (dismissed during the strike) and respect of 
workers‚Äô rights. We immediately followed up with the supplier, who confirmed the unrest of 345 
workers (out of 1,550), the dismissal of 58 workers, and their willingness to collaborate 
for remediation. The four brands including PUMA producing in this factory had several meetings on 
collaborative actions and reached out to the Fair Labor Association (FLA) for support.  
 
In July 2022, during a first call with the FLA, the brands agreed to find an independent third party to 
conduct an in-depth investigation. The FLA interviewed several candidates and commissioned an 
independent third-party The Labour Hive in November 2022. It completed an investigation and 
provided a detailed report with suggested actions in February 2023. The report includes a thorough 
analysis of all allegations. The factory immediately suspended the manager related to 
sexual harassment allegations and dismissed him after the investigation. The investigation did not 
identify issues related to overtime, short-term contracts, unfair dismissals because of trade union 
activities nor bribery at recruitment. The FLA published the results of the investigation report. 
Brands studied the report and agreed on an action plan with the supplier in May 2023. During a 
follow-up verification of the remedial action plan in November 2023, it was confirmed and verified by 
The Labor Hive that factory management had engaged with various stakeholders such as 
local authorities, Better Work, trade union (FISEMA), and worker reps to take corrective actions. 
 
Various projects and programmes have been implemented, and improvements such as an increased 
meal allowance, adjusted salary as per government decree, regulating probation period 
for production workers, and removal of the dismissed workers from the blacklist (so that they can 
find jobs in other factories) were made. In partnership with ILO Better Work, the factory 
arranged several trainings on Freedom of Association, Harassment and Abuse, Compensation and 
Benefits and Hours of Work. Further improvements on workplace dialogue, workers‚Äô 
satisfaction surveys, training effectiveness, renewal of workers‚Äô representation election, and the 
implementation of a workers‚Äô performance evaluation system are still on-going and aim to be 
completed by August 2024.

ZERO TOLERANCE ISSUES 
All issues identified during our auditing and hotline activities are classified as zero tolerance issues (such 
as child labour or forced labour), critical issues or other issues in our Sustainability Handbooks.  
Zero tolerance issues lead to the immediate failure of an audit. If these issues are reported for a new 
factory, the factory will not be allowed to produce PUMA goods. Established suppliers must remedy all zero 
tolerance issues immediately by conducting a root cause analysis and implementing preventive measures to 
prevent the issue reoccurring. As a last resort, a business relationship can be terminated if the factory fails 
to cooperate. Other issues are also followed up on by our Compliance team. 
In 2023, we identified 19 zero tolerance issues and were able to remedy eight on workers‚Äô compensation in 
line with legal requirements, lack of transparency and wastewater discharge. Two zero tolerance issues 
remain open. One was related to a South Africa-based factory producing furniture for our retail stores 
paying 94% of the minimum wage, as they were granted an exemption by local authorities. After meeting the 
factory management, they committed to pay the full minimum wage from July 2024. Another example is 
a factory in Pakistan which was found to have transparency issues during an unannounced audit in late 2023 
conducted after the publication of a Report from Labour Behind the Label. The factory committed to 
improve and joined the Better Work programme in December 2023. We informed Better Work about this 
case and intend to resolve this issue during its first assessment. Nine factories were not onboarded or were 
deactivated in 2023. The increase in zero tolerance issues is due to the increased number of 
factories audited in 2023.

FREEDOM OF ASSOCIATION PROTOCOL IN INDONESIA 
To ensure workers‚Äô voices are heard, we want to foster Freedom of Association (FoA) and signed the 
Indonesia FoA Protocol.  
The main objectives of the Freedom of Association Protocol are: 
‚Ä¢ Eliminate the practice of union busting in the factory and to foster healthy industrial relationships 
‚Ä¢ Factory management and union leaders can identify violations and challenges around FoA that arise in 
the factory and are able to discuss solutions together 
‚Ä¢ Avoid victimisation of union representatives and members when disputes arise between union members 
and management 
‚Ä¢ Set up fair rules for the implementation of FoA by having a joint understanding and commitment 
between workers and the factory management 
‚Ä¢ To have extra layer of rules and regulations related to FoA practice that is not regulated in Law 
No. 21/2000 
As of end of 2023, seven Tier 1 factories have agreed to apply the FoA Protocol with 13 unions. Two factories 
are planning to sign up in 2024, while the remaining ten Tier 1 suppliers either do not have a union or their 
union is not a member of FoA Protocol. As of end of 2023, no FoA case within PUMA suppliers has been 
escalated to the FoA Protocol national committee. FoA cases are mainly resolved internally at a factory level 
without PUMA‚Äôs involvement.  
WAGE ISSUE IN KARNATAKA 
On February 19, 2020, the state government of Karnataka increased the Variable Dearness Allowance (VDA), 
requiring manufacturers to pay workers Rs. 417.56/month as a component of their wages, from April 2020 
onwards. The VDA is calculated based on the increase or decrease in the consumer price index (CPI) to help 
employees in the public and private sector to cope with the rising cost of living due to inflation. 
The Karnataka labour department deferred the payment of VDA (as per the VDA Hike Order) until 
March 2021 due to the financial hardships caused to employers during COVID-19. Two unions challenged the 
deferral order and filed two petitions in August 2020. On September 11, 2020, the Karnataka High Court 
announced that the Labor Department‚Äôs postponement of the wage increase was illegal as per Section 26(2) 
of the Minimum Wages Act. This means that non-payment could be seen as being in contempt of such a 
court order. In practice, factories paid Rs. 622.44/month VDA to workers from April 2021, but they did not pay 
Rs. 417.56/month to workers from March 2020.  
We have actively been working with our sourcing and suppliers in the region, informing our three suppliers 
that PUMA expects suppliers to pay the incremental minimum wages (considering both the 2020 and 2021 
VDA adjustment), including arrears to both existing and former workers. We aligned our expectations of 
suppliers with the Worker Rights Consortium and kept informing them on our progress. In 2023, $ 484,928 
was paid to 13,687 workers, including both existing and former workers. We verified payment on-site, except 
for one factory onboarded in April 2023, where a visit is scheduled in early 2024.

TARGET DESCRIPTION:  
‚Ä¢ Make sure all PUMA employees are paid a living wage 
‚Ä¢ Carry out fair wage assessments including mapping a specific wage ladder for top five sourcing 
countries to help improve their wage levels and practices 
‚Ä¢ Ensure bank transfer payment to workers at all core suppliers by 2022 
‚Ä¢ Ensure effective and freely elected worker representation at all core Tier 1 suppliers  
Relates to United Nations Sustainable Development Goals 1, 2 and 10

‚Ä¢ Percentage of average wages compared to minimum wage 
‚Ä¢ Percentage of workers with permanent contracts 
‚Ä¢ Percentage of workers with social insurance coverage 
‚Ä¢ Percentage of workers paid via bank transfer  
‚Ä¢ Percentage of factories with freely elected worker representation 
‚Ä¢ Percentage of factories with collective bargaining agreements 
‚Ä¢ Number of countries with fair wage assessments over the last five years 
For the definition of fair wages, PUMA follows the requirements for compensation set out in the Code of 
Conduct published by FLA. The Fair Wage Network conducts wage assessments and evaluates the wage 
systems of selected factories across 12 dimensions, focusing on five major areas: legal compliance, wage 
levels, wage adjustments, pay systems and social dialogue and communication. It also assesses the priority 
the wage policy takes within the company‚Äôs Human Resources policy and its Sustainability Strategy 
(considered as a thirteenth cross-cutting dimension). 
 
FAIR WAGES AT PUMA'S OWN ENTITIES 
The increasing cost of living is an emerging risk for PUMA. In 2021, we purchased a license for the living 
wage database of the Fair Wage Network. In 2021 and 2022, we used this database to check that a living 
wage was being paid to all PUMA employees globally. In 2022, our global leadership team implemented 
performance indicators - tied to bonuses - related to ensuring PUMA employees earned a living wage. The 
results of this internal assessment show that in 2022 all regular PUMA employees globally who were 
working full time were paid according to living wage thresholds at the regional/city level or above the Living 
Wage National Adjusted Mean as defined by the Fair Wage Network. This was also the case for 2023. See 
Our People section for further details. 
 
FAIR WAGES IN THE SUPPLY CHAIN 
As part of our efforts to ensure fair wage practices at the factories of our suppliers, we have defined 
the failure to make a full payment of at least the minimum wage as a zero-tolerance issue. This means that 
to be taken on as or to remain an active PUMA supplier, a company must pay minimum wages in full 
compliance with local regulations. 99.97% of workers in 2023 were paid at least minimum wage. Provisions

around the payment of overtime hours and social insurance are also clearly articulated in PUMA‚Äôs Code of 
Conduct and are scrutinised regularly as part of our Compliance Audit Programme. The performance of 
PUMA‚Äòs suppliers in other Fair Wage dimensions is also assessed through fieldwork assessment surveys 
(among both the workers and management) carried out by the Fair Wage Network. 
DIGITAL PAYMENT 
In 2023, 100% of our core factories paid 224,444 employees digitally. We are further expanding the digital 
mapping to all Pakistan factories, where 1,742 employees from four suppliers are not yet paid digitally. We 
will follow up in 2024. 
FAIR COMPENSATION DASHBOARD 
We have collected wage data annually from our core Tier 1 factories for several years. We use this data to 
report S-KPIs (see table T. 12). In 2022, we used the FLA‚Äôs Fair Compensation Dashboard* to analyze 2021 
wage data for 59 strategic Tier 1 factories, and 2022 wage data for 60 strategic Tier 1 factories in 2023. We 
use the Dashboard to compare aggregated and anonymised data from industry peers and, where available, 
against living wage estimates of the Global Living Wage Coalition (GLWC), developed by the Anker Research 
Institute**. Where GLWC estimates are not available, namely in Indonesia, we used 2022 Fair Wage Network 
benchmarks***. 
Graph G.10 shows the results of our benchmarking for 60 core Tier 1 factories in local currency, covering 
wages in 2022. This data covers approximately 75% of PUMA‚Äôs global production volume for 145,834 
workers employed under those suppliers. 32 factories paid a living wage to 83,089 workers in Cambodia, 
China, Pakistan and Vietnam, covering 45% of PUMA‚Äôs global production volume. Those 83,089 workers 
represent 13% of our total supply chain workforce.  
 
Below is our analysis of the results:  
‚Ä¢ All of our five strategic factories in Cambodia, one out of two strategic factories in Pakistan, 13 out of 18 
strategic factories in China and 13 out of 20 strategic factories in Vietnam pay, on average, a living wage 
as set by the Global Living Wage Coalition. For Vietnam, as the GLWC provided a breakdown of the living 
wage benchmark into four different levels instead of two previously, seven Vietnam factories out of 20 fell 
below GLWC benchmarks. These seven factories now have a higher living wage level to reach. 
‚Ä¢ One supplier in the Philippines, which is below GLWC benchmark, will go through a Fair Wage 
Assessment in 2024. 
‚Ä¢ In Indonesia, all strategic factories went through Fair Wage Assessments or Remediations. One of the 
factories received the Fair Wage Certificate. At two factories re-assessed after remediation, we saw 
improvements in their scores on the 12 Fair Wage Dimensions, especially on prevailing wage, real wages, 
communication and social dialogue. These actions were taken between 2022 and 2023, which explains 
why there is a wage gap towards a living wage. We will keep following the remediation actions of these 
four core factories in Indonesia. 
 
 
*    Industry average wage data from the FLA Fair Compensation Dashboard from November 2020 and October 2021. Users of the 
FLA‚Äôs Fair Compensation Dashboard have access to live anonymised monthly average net wage calculations based on all 
wage data uploaded per country and year. Averages are updated as wage data is uploaded into the dashboard and includes 
the Net Wage = Basic (Contracted) Wage + Cash Benefits + In-Kind Benefits ‚Äì Mandatory Taxes and Legal Deductions. 
Payment of overtime is excluded. 
**  Global Living Wage Coalition: The GLWC estimates and reference values are developed by the Anker Research Institute. The 
methodology for these estimates uphold the definition of the living wage, which includes the standard remuneration received 
by a worker for a workweek, in a particular place, to afford a decent standard of living for the worker and his/her family. 
Elements of a decent standard of living include food, water, housing, education, healthcare, transportation, clothing and 
other essential needs, including provision for unexpected events.  
***Fair Wage Network methodology: It takes into account the minimum living wage necessary for a worker to cover his/her 
family's basic needs considering multiple income earners in the family (the necessary family budget being covered by the 
sum of income earners). FWN also proposes a more ambitious living wage threshold that would consider one income earner 
and not multiple income earners. PUMA used multiple income earners thresholds in our fair wage analysis.

‚Ä¢ The Turkey factory‚Äôs net pay has increased by 55% compared to 2021 due to the high inflation. We plan to 
enroll this factory for a Fair Wage assessment in 2024 to evaluate its wage system, so the factory can set 
up an action plan and workers‚Äô income can increase. 
‚Ä¢ One supplier in Pakistan reached the Global Living Wage Coalition Benchmark. Another supplier 
reached 97% of the GLWC benchmark. We will launch Fair Wage Remediation with the latter in 2024. 
‚Ä¢ Wage payments in Bangladesh, despite being above industry average, fell well short of the Global Living 
Wage Coalition Benchmark and reached 67% of the Global Living Wage Coalition Benchmark in 2022; 
(70% in 2021, 69% in 2020). 
In 2023, we conducted Fair Wage Assessments with ten factories in Bangladesh, Pakistan, Indonesia, 
Cambodia and China, including seven re-assessments at factories in Bangladesh, Cambodia, Pakistan and 
Indonesia and three first-time assessments at two suppliers in China and one in Bangladesh.

Since 2018, we have asked Fair Wage Network (FWN) to conduct fair wage assessments at our core factories 
based in Bangladesh (2018), Cambodia (2019), Cambodia and Indonesia (2021), Bangladesh, 
Vietnam, Pakistan (2022), and China (2023) at 27 factories in total. Six factories obtained a Fair Wage 
Certificate, meaning that across the 13 dimensions of Fair Wage, wage and overtime payment, 
communication, and social dialogue for example, factories received at least 280 points out of 400 with no 
more than two dimensions below a 40% score, and workers are paid above the Fair Wage Network Living

A positive outcome is that factories are strong in some institutional elements such as wage grids, 
monitoring the wages‚Äô cost progression within the total production cost (including involving worker 
representatives to discuss and negotiate wage related issues and paying wages above competitors‚Äô rates 
and above companies from other sectors located in the same area. However, similar developments were not 
always reported on in collective agreements, which have rarely been signed at the factory level, and 
monitoring process for moving towards the payment of a living wage. These insights still provide valuable 
information for follow-up and remediation in these factories. Worker satisfaction with wages and working 
conditions was found to be relatively good, with most workers being either ‚Äòfully‚Äô or ‚Äòpartly‚Äô satisfied with 
their wages and working conditions. At one supplier, however, it was found that nearly half of the workforce 
were not satisfied with the working conditions, we will follow up on this in 2024. 
In 2023, out of 10 factories that went through a fair wage assessment, six were re-assessed after a nearly 
one-year remediation phase with the support of Fair Wage Network (three in Bangladesh, one in Cambodia 
and two in Indonesia). All six factories improved significantly in communication and social dialogue, wage 
structure and also competitiveness. Under the Fair Wage Network Remediation Framework, social dialogue 
activities took place at those six factories and the wage structure was jointly reviewed as a result. Although 
wage adjustment mechanisms were improved, there is still room for improvement as regards the living 
wage. At the three factories assessed for the first time, we will work with the Fair Wage Network to further 
improve their wage strategy and pay systems. One factory in Pakistan was re-assessed as they previously 
had reached the GLWC living wage threshold. The factory has not yet received fair wage certification 
although its score has improved. 
The Fair Wage Remediation programme provides a remediation plan to factories based on their individual 
assessments, and guides factories in setting up a Fair Wage Implementation Committee (consisting of 
workers and management representatives). The Committee is trained by the Fair Wage Network, on fair 
wage dimensions, wage grid, and how to a conduct living wage survey. The committee is responsible -under 
FWN guidance- for implementing the remediation plan.  
In Indonesia, both factories under the remediation programme opened a dialogue channel with trade unions 
to negotiate the pay systems. One supplier included a seniority bonus into its basic wage, 90% of workers 
had a 0.46%-1.15% wage increase since January 2023; the factory also provided 14% to 28% as skill bonuses 
to workers having the ability to operate more than one machine. Another supplier pays workers higher than 
the legal requirement, providing a seniority bonus of 0.42%-0.48% of the minimum wage to workers who 
have worked more than one year, and providing a skill bonus that ranges from 0.65% to 16.34% of the 
minimum wage. All of these measures improve not only the fairness but also the efficiency of pay systems. 
In Bangladesh, all three suppliers developed training modules and trained almost 100% of the workers 
using a skills matrix for all the designations. This ensures that workers‚Äô wages increase in step with human 
capital developments (people skill development, working experience, creativity, strengths and attributes) 
and that the promotion system is fair and transparent. Training programmes were also provided to both 
management and workers on their roles and responsibilities based on the skills matrix and its connection to 
wage increases. Suppliers also looked at the gap between workers‚Äô gross income and the living wage, and 
took initiative to minimize this gap. For example, one supplier introduced a fair price shop on the premises 
of the factory, so that the workers get the daily products they need at an affordable price, allowing workers 
to keep part of their wages for other needs. As a result of actions taken by our suppliers, we witnessed an 
improved dialogue between workers and factory management on the topic of wages. Workers, in one of 
three factories, formed a Trade Union during the remediation, so workers will be able to better coordinate 
their workforce concerns through this platform. We got to understand that the management of this 
particular supplier was highly supportive of the Trade Union‚Äôs creation, and it was found that their 
concerned parties are currently engaged in a congenial relationship.

In Cambodia, with the involvement of the Fair Wage Implementation Committee, the factory that started its 
remediation programme in mid-2022, reviewed its wage structure by creating more bonuses such as 
productivity bonuses and multi-skill bonuses. All of these are contributing to an almost 6% wage increase 
on average for about 3% (122) of qualified workers. This helped the factory to stabilize its workforce, with a 
14.8% reduction of annual staff turnover in 2022 and a further 68.5% reduction in 2023. 
‚Üó CASE STUDY 
Bangladesh 
A factory in Bangladesh was assessed by Fair Wage Network team in 2018 to evaluate its wage 
practices. The factory could not be certified, joined the Fair Wage Remediation Programme in 2022 
and was re-assessed at the end of the programme in 2023. The company has developed a rather 
comprehensive wage policy. 
One of the major improvements was in ‚ÄòCommunication and social dialogue‚Äô. A committee, 
consisting of an equal number of representatives from management and workers, was formed to 
implement a remediation plan. The workers‚Äô representatives on the committee were engaged in the 
decision-making process while developing and implementing the skills matrix, performance 
evaluation processes, for example. A robust communication strategy was set, ensuring that 
employees are well-informed about their wage levels and pay structures. The company set up a 
social dialogue policy, allowing representatives of workers to be involved in discussions and 
negotiations on wage matters. The intention is for these negotiations to lead to regular talks on 
wage issues and the possible endorsement of a collective agreement in future. The improved labour 
relations led to a 0.5% reduction in the staff turnover rate. 
In March 2023, while the remediation programme was underway, the workers at the factory created a 
Trade Union. This action suggests that the workers recognise the potential benefits of having a 
collective organisation to represent their interests. By establishing the Trade Union, the workers 
have created a structured platform that allows them to collaborate more effectively on matters of 
collective concern. Currently, approximately half of the workers of the factory are members of that 
Trade Union. The factory is working with Better Work Bangladesh, who provide training for both 
management and union members on their roles and responsibilities under the Labor Law.  
 
GENDER PAY GAP 
For the first time in 2023, we collected wage data by gender. There is no wage gap between female and male 
workers on a global average. We notice a difference of a few cents of Euros per hour in Pakistan, China, 
Cambodia and Turkey, mainly because factories are paying higher wages for working positions, such as 
polishing, or in warehouses that require the use of chemicals or heavy lifting and are positions 
predominantly filled by male workers.

RECRUITMENT FEES 
PUMA signed the Fair Labor Association/American Apparel and Footwear Association Commitment to 
Responsible Recruitment in 2018. Since then, we have been actively involved with suppliers, industry peers 
and the UN‚Äôs International Organization for Migration (IOM) to ensure that the labour rights of foreign and 
migrant workers are upheld in our supply chain. 
We map on a yearly basis if our factories employ foreign migrant workers and how much workers paid in 
recruitment fees. We then engage with our sourcing leaders, supplier top management, and in some cases 
other brands the supplier produces for, to come up with an agreement on a timeline to pay migrant workers 
back. The back payment could in certain cases be made in different instalments and not a lump sum to not 
disturb the factory as not all workers are entitled to this payment ‚Äì an issue which could lead to 
misunderstandings between workers. 
Through the efforts of multi-stakeholder engagements, factories paid back more than $ 100,000 to 255 
foreign migrant workers at six factories in Japan, South Korea, China (Taiwan) and Thailand in 2022. PUMA 
has used e-learning from the International Organization for Migration in employer guidelines to train 36 
factories from Mauritius, China (Taiwan), South Korea, Thailand and Japan in 2022. In 2023, we kept 
monitoring factories‚Äô recruitment practices.  
In May 2023, we found that eight foreign migrant workers had paid recruitment fees before starting to work 
at three factories (two core Tier 2, one non-core Tier 2) in Taiwan; through communication with factories and 
support from our sourcing team, over $ 16,000 in total was paid back to these workers.  
During an audit at one South Korea factory, we found that one worker had paid $ 370 for a flight ticket from 
their home country to South Korea. The factory immediately reimbursed this worker after the audit.  
During audits conducted at the end of 2023, we found that 12 migrant workers had paid a total of 
approximately $ 33,000 before they started to work at three factories in Japan. Two factories agreed to pay 
back a total of $ 23,109 to nine migrant workers in January 2024; we will terminate our business relationship 
with the third factory which refused to reimburse workers since it is in breach of PUMA‚Äôs standards. We will 
phase out this supplier by June 2025, so that they have sufficient time to find another customer to replace 
PUMA‚Äôs business and to avoid impacting workers‚Äô employment.

2022-2023 PUMA PLWF REPORT: LEADING  
The Platform Living Wage Financials (PLWF) is a coalition of 20 financial institutions 
that engage and encourage investee companies to enable living wages and incomes in 
their global supply chains. The 2022-2023 PLWF report presents the annual 
assessments of investee companies on living wage and responsible purchasing 
practices. In 2023, PUMA was the only company that reached the Leading category for 
its work on fair income, out of 31 companies from the Garment and Footwear sector. 
SUPPORTING LEGAL MINIMUM WAGE INCREASE IN BANGLADESH 
In 2023, PUMA received a letter from four Bangladeshi Unions calling for support for minimum wage to 
increase, through social dialogue, and by making a long-term commitment to continue sourcing from 
Bangladesh.  
PUMA answered through a public statement recognizing that the current legal minimum wage in the 
Ready-Made Garment sector is significantly below a living wage. In this statement, we share PUMA‚Äôs 
standards regarding legal minimum wage, overtime and social insurance payment-related issues, as well 
as our continuous monitoring and methodology, regarding living wage benchmarks and assessments. We 
reiterated the importance of freedom of association and collective bargaining as a key means through which 
employers, their organisations and trade unions can establish fair wages and working conditions. We also 
supported the FLA‚Äôs letter shared in August 2023, which appeals to the Chairman of the Minimum Wage 
Board to champion local union demands for increases in the minimum wage. 
In October 2023, PUMA also joined other FLA-affiliated brands to ask the government to consider that the 
minimum wage consultations should be made in an environment to support dialogue with relevant 
stakeholders and Unions, seek to raise the minimum wage to a level that is sufficient to cover workers‚Äô 
basic needs and some discretionary income and takes into account inflationary pressures, while ensuring

that the minimum wage is reviewed annually. Signatory brands are AEO, Inc. Abercrombie & Fitch, adidas, 
Amer Sports, Burton, Gap Inc., Hugo Boss AG, KMD Brands, Levi Strauss & Co., lululemon, Patagonia, 
PUMA SE, PVH Corp, SanMar and Under Armour. 
In both letters, PUMA shared its commitment to implement Responsible Purchasing Practices to support 
negotiations and wage increases and to continue sourcing in Bangladesh. 
WORKER REPRESENTATIVES PROJECT  
Effective social dialogue and sound industrial relations are key components of achieving decent work. 
Ensuring effective and freely elected worker representation in all core Tier 1 suppliers is among our 
10FOR25 Sustainability Targets. PUMA encouraged our suppliers to join the ILO Better Work Programme, 
which coaches the factory management to create or work with an existing bipartite or worker/management 
committee to discuss and resolve workplace issues on an ongoing basis. 
For factories that are not part of the Better Work programme, we partnered with Timeline Consultancy, a 
China-based consultant experienced on improving worker-management cooperation, who trained PUMA‚Äôs 
Sustainability Team in 2022 and 2023. Our PUMA Sustainability Team gained the ability to independently 
promote the establishment of an effective Worker Representative Committee and to evaluate 
its effectiveness.  
Since 2022, 12 factories in China have established a Worker Representative Committee. 358 worker 
representatives were freely elected by production workers, 59% of which are female workers. For a better 
understanding of the worker-management dialogue mechanism, 380 representatives of factory 
management were trained by PUMA‚Äôs Sustainability Team on the Significance of Dialogue and Worker 
Representation before the worker representative election. After the election, all these factory management 
and worker representatives were trained on their roles and responsibilities, rights and obligations, how to 
conduct adequate information sharing and how to establish a dialogue mechanism, which enables open 
dialogue between factory management and worker representatives. 
In 2023, we expanded the programme to include two Vietnamese factories and one factory in Indonesia: 
worker representative elections will be held in three factories in 2024. 
SOCIAL-KPIS  
On average, our core suppliers paid basic wages that exceed minimum wage levels by 12.7% in 2023. When 
adding overtime and bonus payments, our core suppliers pay 62.7% above minimum wage. In view of the 
global macroeconomic situation, which has led to a change in customers' ordering behaviour, we saw a 
decline in the order book in the first half of 2023 and stabilisation during the second half of 2023; as a result, 
overtime working hours decreased on average by 2.4 hours per week compared with 2022, which explains 
why the percentage of gross wages (including overtime and bonuses) above minimum wage decreased 
compared with 2022. At the same time, in 2023, the minimum wage increased over a 12-month average by 
104% in Turkey, by 11% in Pakistan, by 2% in Indonesia, by 4% in the Philippines, by 3% in Cambodia and 0.3% 
in China. For Bangladesh the new minimum wage came into effect on the first of December 2023, and 
increased by 56%. 
100% of workers are covered by social insurance in all countries except for China where 80.4% are covered: 
this represents a 4.4% increase compared to 2022 due to factories making an effort to explain the benefits of 
the programme and convincing workers to join social insurance schemes. The total average coverage with 
social insurance increased from 97% to 97.5%. 
In 2023, 32.3% workers are covered by a collective bargaining agreement (in 2022 34.4%). This number 
decreased as one of our suppliers in Indonesia with a CBA dropped off our core supplier list. 


PUMA Annual Report 2023 
‚Üó Sustainability 
87 
The percentage of women in managerial positions increased slightly to 50.4% (in 2022 49.1%) as some 
factories reached their goals of increasing the number of females in managerial roles.  
The percentage of permanent workers increased from 74.2% to 76.7% on average, mainly due to labour law 
changes in Cambodia, under which more workers get an Undetermined Duration Contract (UDC), after 
completing a two-year Fixed Duration Contract (FDC). In addition, since there was a decrease in orders 
during the first half of 2023, factory management teams recruited fewer temporary workers.  
The turnover rate decreased due to factories implementing worker retention programmes. However, in 
countries such as Pakistan, Indonesia and Turkey turnover rates increased due to downsizing business or 
workers entering into retirement.  
The average injury rate was reduced to 0.2% (0.3% in 2022). We followed up on action plan implementation 
after various OHS trainings, such as Accident Prevention and Reporting training, conducted by PUMA since 
2021. In view of the 2023 global macroeconomic situation, which led to a change in customers' ordering 
behaviour, we saw a decline in the order book in the first half of 2023 and stabilisation during the second 
half. This led to a downturn in working hours, fewer temporary workers being recruited and potentially 
fewer risks of injury. This could also explain why the injury rate decreased this year.

aimed to reduce the number of work-related accidents. In 2021, we revised our Supplier OHS handbook, 
requiring our manufacturing partners to conduct an OHS risk assessment. We also published the PUMA 
OHS Policy for our own employees. Our health and safety targets are linked to the bonuses of our global 
leadership team.  
 
HEALTH AND SAFETY AT PUMA‚ÄôS OWN ENTITIES 
At our headquarters, we operate an occupational Health and Safety Committee, that oversees our health 
and safety management system. The Committee includes a specialised labour physician, a health and safety 
technician and employee representatives. In 2023, we certified our OHS management system according to 
ISO 45001 at the headquarters level.  
To ensure a global implementation of our health and safety policy, our larger subsidiaries have their own 
health and safety committees or experts in place. For more than ten years, we have been able to record zero 
fatal accidents at our own entities globally. We have also kept the lost time injury rate below 0.5 since 2019, 
meaning that per 100 full-time employees, less than 0.5 accidents were recorded, in line with our targets. 
 
* 
High-risk countries are defined by the building safety index which is based on instances of non-compliance associated 
with building approval, multi-tenant building, structural integrity, ventilation/ heating, and warehouses.

In 2023, this target was supported by continuing our Occupational Health and Safety e-learning. Over 80% of 
PUMA staff members globally participated in health and safety training to prevent injuries or work-related 
negative health effects. 
In addition, we offer sports facilities, canteens with balanced food and work-life balance courses at our 
major offices globally. For more information on employee wellbeing please refer to the Our People section 
of this report. 
 
HEALTH AND SAFETY IN THE SUPPLY CHAIN 
Apart from our ongoing auditing programme that includes occupational health and safety assessments, we 
implement our Building Safety Assessment Programme in countries where we have identified risks. We also 
set up professional risk assessments at all our major manufacturing partners. Despite these preventive 
measures, unfortunately, a work-related accident resulted in the death of an employee in one of our 
suppliers‚Äô factories in India in 2023. We will keep our focus on Occupational Health Safety accident 
prevention. 
SUPPLIER TRAINING ON OHS RISK ASSESSMENT 
In 2021, we updated our OHS Handbook to guide the OHS risk assessment processes and tools for the 
factory management and OHS person in charge.  
PUMA provided training to core Tier 1 and Tier 2 suppliers on how to conduct Occupational Health and Safety 
(OHS) risk assessments in 2021 and 2022. We followed up on progress with an on-site visit by a third-party 
auditing company.  
 
In 2023, among the trained factories, we noticed fewer violations related to Chemical Safety Management (-
3%), and Electrical and Mechanical Safety Management (-2%) compared to 2022. However, we noticed more 
violations related to noise pollution. We will explore how to improve together with suppliers in 2024. 
 
In 2023, the PUMA Sustainability Team developed accident prevention and reporting training based on the 
ITC-ILO material and provided Train-the-Trainer sessions to 266 managerial staff at 102 factories (core Tier 1 
suppliers and all factories in India and Sri Lanka). Trained factory managers provided this training to 115,588 
workers in 59 factories. Training hours were 117,695 in total. Some of the factory managers received the 
training in late 2023, we will follow up on their workers‚Äô training in 2024. 
 
4,364 workers from eight factories in Cambodia and Indonesia completed the Better Work e-learning course 
on Occupational Safety and Health via the WOVO mobile app, covering 51% of the employees in these 
factories.  
 
BUILDING SAFETY ASSESSMENT AND RISK ASSESSMENT 
A safe workplace is a top priority at PUMA and we continuously carry out building safety inspections among 
high-risk factories in our supply chain. From 2015 to the end of 2023, our Building Safety Assessment 
Programme covered Bangladesh, India, Indonesia and Pakistan.

In 2023, we used EIQ to map all sourcing countries where building safety is considered as high risk. As a 
result, two factories in Indonesia and four factories in India were identified as high-risk. The four factories in 
India already went through a Building, Electrical and Fire Safety Assessment (BEFS) in 2022, conducted by 
ELEVATE. A similar assessment was conducted in the two Indonesian factories in 2023. Through active 
engagement with these four suppliers in India, 69% of the findings had been remediated by the end of 2023. 
We will keep following up to ensure all findings are taken care of.  
Five factories went through building safety inspections in Indonesia, two in 2023 and three in 2018. We 
continued following up on remediation at the three factories. Two factories obtained building safety 
certificates issued by the government, and one will be certified in early 2024.  
‚Üó CASE STUDIES 
Building Safety in India 
A factory under the largest footwear supplier in India, underwent the Building, Electrical and Fire 
Safety Assessment by a third-party inspection firm, Elevate, in 2022, as well as a follow-up 
inspection in 2023.  
75 findings were identified at the initial assessment, 22 of them categorised as Major Issues. PUMA 
conducted an onsite follow-up with factory management, who then agreed to engage with experts to 
conduct feasibility studies and implement corrective actions. Over $ 41,000 was invested to install 
fire-fighting equipment, strengthen the building structure, do panel modifications, etc. As a result, 
92% of findings had been corrected during the follow-up inspection in September 2023. The rest of 
the findings require more time to remediate. PUMA will follow up with the supplier in 2024.  
 
ACCORD 
As part of its continued commitment to the ACCORD international programme, PUMA signed the Pakistan 
ACCORD in early March 2023. Seven supplier factories joined the programme, including two of the three 
factories that were previously assessed by ELEVATE and other third parties. Another factory in scope of this 
programme was on-boarded in mid-2023, we are now applying for this factory to join the ACCORD.  
Two factories are not under the scope of Pakistan ACCORD programme, as these are not textile product 
manufacturers. One of these factories was on-boarded in the last quarter of 2022 and will go through an 
assessment in 2024. The second factory went through a Building, Electrical and Fire Safety Assessment 
(BEFS) conducted by ELEVATE in 2017 and 2021. Since then, the factory management has hired a 
professional third party to support the remediation of the open findings. In 2024, this factory will be re-
assessed to measure progress. 
Our factories in the ACCORD in Bangladesh have a completion rate (initial findings) of 94%, whereas the 
average rate of all factories in the RSC programme is 91%. Eight (out of 21 ACCORD active) factories 
achieved 100% remediation of the initial findings. Another seven factories achieved 90%-98% remediation of 


PUMA Annual Report 2023 
‚Üó Sustainability 
92 
the initial findings. Six out of 21 factories were at low completion rates (0%-89%): two did not receive a follow 
up inspection by ACCORD in 2023, two were newly onboarded to ACCORD, and two were delayed in 
remediation of the findings. We will keep working with those factories on ACCORD remediation plan in 2024. 
ACCIDENTS 
In 2023, we unfortunately reported an employee death resulting from a work-related incident at one of our 
suppliers‚Äô factories in India. An electrician fell from the factory‚Äôs roof, as neither a secured ladder was used 
nor a harness rope was installed. After 55 days of hospitalisation, the worker‚Äôs health deteriorated, leading 
to his death. The factory paid all medical expenses and the legal compensation, as well as an additional 
lump sum to the worker's family. An investigation and Hazard Risk Assessment were conducted by an 
independent expert. Following this assessment, safety equipment including a harness hook was installed on 
the rooftop, staff training on hazards and risks was provided and enhanced monitoring of potential unsafe 
conditions was implemented to prevent similar accidents. We deeply regret this tragic accident which 
caused the loss of this employee‚Äôs life.  
INJURIES 
The average injury rate was reduced to 0.2%. We followed up on factories' action plan implementation after 
various OHS trainings, such as Accident Prevention and Reporting training, conducted by PUMA since 2021. 
Given 2023‚Äôs global macroeconomic situation, which led to a change in customers' ordering behavior, we 
saw a decline in the order book in the first half of the year and stabilisation in the second half. This led to 
fewer working hours, and fewer temporary workers recruitment, meaning less risks for injury, this could 
also explain why the injury rate decreased this year.

BANGLADESH EMPLOYMENT INJURY SCHEME PILOT 
Despite significant progress on the way towards decent and safe working conditions in the ready-made 
garment industry in Bangladesh, it lacks a comprehensive Employment Injury Scheme (EIS) in accordance 
with international standards as defined in the ILO Employment Injury Benefits Convention. To mitigate that 
gap the Bangladesh Government initiated a pilot programme to provide income replacements for the 
permanently disabled and the dependents of deceased workers. The ILO and GIZ collaborated in the project 
and agreed on the implementation as well as the transition to a permanent EIS after three to five years. 
The EIS provides periodic payments/pensions as top-ups to the lump-sum payments of the Central Fund, 
rendering the level of benefits compatible with ILO Convention No. 121. These payments are financed by 
international brands.  


PUMA Annual Report 2023 
‚Üó Sustainability 
93 
PUMA signed the voluntary pledge for the Employment Injury Scheme pilot in Bangladesh to contribute to 
safeguarding decent living conditions for victims and their families. PUMA joined in early 2023, together with 
seven other brands. We are actively engaged with the project not only by providing financial support, but 
also by providing feedback for learning. 
According to EIS data on 31 December 2023, the pilot has responded to 13 death cases. The EIS committee 
has disbursed a total of 932,766 BDT, equivalent to 5,241 BDT as a monthly compensation, directly to the 
family members affected by this tragedy. The pilot has responded to eight permanent disability cases, with a 
total estimated lifelong benefit of 5,837,724 BDT. 
As per EIS policy, factory and workers are kept anonymous, so we have no way to know if the families of the 
two workers who passed away as reported in our 2022 Annual Report, have received such a benefit.

ENVIRONMENT 
The purpose of our environmental efforts is to ensure that PUMA and its suppliers are in full environmental 
compliance and that any negative impact on the environment is minimised. Over the last ten years, PUMA 
has not incurred any environmental violations or fines known to us. Ultimately, we are aiming for a positive 
environmental impact of PUMA and our supply chain on the environment. 
 
ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT AT PUMA‚ÄôS OWN ENTITIES 
We conduct energy efficiency audits every four years at our own entities. In 2023, we commissioned 19 audits 
at PUMA offices, stores and warehouses in Germany, the Netherlands, France, Spain and Sweden. 
Compulsory in the European Union, these audits help us to identify energy-saving opportunities at our 
offices, stores and warehouses and roll them out globally. In 2023, for example, we replaced some lights at 
our headquarters with more energy-efficient LED lights. 
In 2022 we achieved the ISO 14001 Environmental Management certification for our headquarters and 
published a stand-alone environmental policy. We also compiled and published an environmental handbook 
specific to our own offices, stores and distribution centres. We continued our global data collection and 
management processes for our own entities and set up a quarterly subsidiaries call for peer learning and 
good practice sharing. These calls are also used to re-emphasize our Sustainability Strategy and goals with 
our PUMA countries worldwide. The progress towards those goals is reported in this report. 
 
ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT IN THE SUPPLY CHAIN 
ENVIRONMENTAL RISK ASSESSMENT 
In 2023, we developed a Civil Society Organisations (CSOs) engagement policy to engage with them 
reactively and proactively. Please refer to the Due Diligence and Risk Assessment section of this report. 
In 2023, we conducted an environmental risk assessment using EiQ platform by Elevate. EiQ is a data-driven 
supply chain ESG due diligence platform used by businesses to enhance Environmental, Social, and 
Governance (ESG) risk management. We focused on two risk areas; firstly, environmental country 
risk exposure for supply chain and secondly environmental material risk exposure.  
COUNTRY RISK EXPOSURE 
We evaluated the environmental risk profile of our key sourcing countries. In 2023, the six most important 
sourcing countries, comprising 90% of the total volume, are located in Asia. China is the biggest production 
country in 2023 with a total of 30%, followed by Vietnam is the second biggest production country with 26%, 
Cambodia with 13%, Bangladesh, which focuses on apparel, at 12%, Indonesia with 5% and India ‚Äì only 
serving the local market at 3%. 
The parameters for the country risk include indexes such as air emission, environmental management, 
waste management, environment permits and wastewater violations. The supply chain risk environmental 
profile indicates that Indonesia and the Philippines are extreme-risk countries, whereas other key sourcing 
countries like Vietnam, China, Bangladesh, India and Cambodia are high-risk countries. Taiwan is a 
medium-risk country from supply chain environment risk. For environmental permits violations, Indonesia 
and Bangladesh are indicated as extreme-risk countries.   
The risks mitigation measures in place for extreme-risk and high-risk countries, excluding India include; 
factory performance evaluation through Higg FEM verification, chemical management following ZDHC 
guidelines, compliance to ZDHC Wastewater Guidelines and core factories‚Äô participation in cleaner 


PUMA Annual Report 2023 
‚Üó Sustainability 
95 
production programmes, capacity building training programmes, supplier scorecard with E-KPIs followed 
by meetings with these core suppliers.  
Publicly disclosed goals on reduction in water consumption, reduction in production waste to landfill and 
increased use of renewable energy help to track the performance of core suppliers and hence help to 
mitigate environmental risks. In China, the country with the largest sourcing volume in 2023, our suppliers 
have been disclosing their environmental performance data on The Institute of Public & Environmental 
Affairs (IPE) platform.  
India production is only serving the local Indian market, and we have prioritised compliance with our Zero 
Tolerance Issues. We have not yet launched mitigation measures such as Higg FEM verification, 
chemical management following ZDHC guidelines, and compliance to ZDHC Wastewater Guidelines to all 
factories. We will gradually enroll these factories in these programmes in the coming years. In 2024, we will 
strengthen our existing measures to improve the environmental performance of supplier factories. We will 
focus on the transition to Higg FEM 4.0 which is a more exhaustive evaluation. It will help factories to 
further improve their performance and in turn help PUMA to manage its environmental risks. We plan to 
discuss the results of this risk assessment with our sourcing teams for business consideration.       
MATERIAL RISK 
We evaluated the environmental risk of our key materials such as cotton, polyester, leather & rubber. The 
environmental risk covers water use, non-GHG air pollutants, terrestrial ecosystem use, soil pollutants, 
solid waste and water pollutants. The results indicate that material environment risk is highest for natural 
rubber, followed by synthetic rubber and leather. Polyester has the lowest environmental risk. Furthermore, 
we mapped our sourcing share by country of these materials. 
Cotton: In 2023, we sourced 63% of cotton from the USA, followed by Brazil (15%), Australia (8%) and India 
(4%). The USA is a high-risk country while Brazil and India are extreme-risk countries; Australia is a 
medium-risk country. The risks are water use, air pollution and biodiversity and ecosystem.  
We have required our suppliers to source only cotton grown in farms that are licensed as having good 
farming and human rights standards (BCI), or recycled cotton from factories that are either Global Recycled 
Standard (GRS) or Recycled Claim Standard (RCS) certified by 2025. 
PUMA is taking steps to mitigate some of the environmental risks associated with cotton sourcing which 
includes the adoption of BCI cotton, increased usage of recycled cotton, innovation to increase the share of 
recycled cotton in our products, conducting Life Cycle Assessments of products and materials to evaluate 
the environmental impact in lifecycle stages and engaging with the industry such as Textile Exchange to stay 
informed on industry best practices.  
We collect material data consumption on an annual basis along with the country of origin and require our 
suppliers to keep all the supportive documentation available. We have also established an on-going due 
diligence programme with our partner laboratory in Germany where we regularly test samples of cotton-
finished garments before shipment. This further strengthens traceability and control across our supply 
chain, from the raw material to the finished products.  
Through our partnership with Better Cotton, we support farmers in developing a better understanding of 
Integrated Pest Management and phasing out the use of Highly Hazardous Pesticides (this helps to 
address improper disposal of used agrochemical containers which can contaminate air, soil, water and 
local ecosystems), to use water responsibly, to better protect the soil and to conserve and enhance 
biodiversity on their land. Better Cotton has set up goals to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 50% per 
ton of Better Cotton lint produced by the end of the decade, ensure 100% of Better Cotton Farmers have 
improved the health of their soil and reduce the use and risk of synthetic pesticides by at least 50%. 
In 2023, the share of BCI cotton was 90.3% and recycled cotton was 8.6% of total cotton sourced by PUMA. 


PUMA Annual Report 2023 
‚Üó Sustainability 
96 
Polyester: We sourced 79% of our polyester from China in 2023, followed by Taiwan at 9.2% and Vietnam 
at 7.4%. China is a high-risk country. Risk profiles for polyester from Vietnam and Taiwan are not available 
on the EIQ platform. High-risks are air pollution, water use and solid waste. 
We have required our suppliers to source only polyester-certified by Bluesign/Oekotex, or recycled polyester 
from factories that are either Global Recycled Standard (GRS) or Recycled Claim Standard (RCS) certified by 
2025. PUMA has joined the Textile Exchange polyester challenge since our 2025 goal of 75% recycled 
polyester is aligned with this challenge. We engage our core fabric manufacturing plants in energy 
efficiency programmes and support them to the transition to 25% renewable energy processing in 2025. We 
monitor and report chemical discharges, and work to eliminate pollutant chemicals.  
In 2023, we sourced bio-based, high-performance polyester fibre known as Sorona, to up to 0.11% of our 
total polyester consumption. Sorona contains over 20% bio-based carbon content, which helps to reduce 
environmental impact, while maintaining quality and performance. Sorona is produced via a fermentation 
process that utilizes corn sugar as the main ingredient.  
In 2023, 61.8% of the polyester used in our products was recycled, 23.3% certified by Bluesign/Oekotex and 
0.11% biobased.  
Leather: In 2023, we sourced, 61% of our leather from the USA, followed by Argentina 27%, Australia 6% and 
Brazil 5%. The USA, Brazil and Argentina are high-risk countries, while Australia is a medium-risk 
country. High risks are air pollution, water use and impact on ecosystem. 
PUMA is taking several steps to mitigate environmental risks associated with leather sourcing. These 
include sourcing leather from Leather Working Group-rated tanneries, committing for sourcing 
deforestation-free bovine leather, and focusing on innovation for the development of recycled and other bio-
based alternatives. We engage with Fashion Pact, Textile Exchange and the Leather Working Group (LWG) 
to remain updated about industry best practices.  
We have committed to sourcing all the bovine leather used in our products from verified deforestation-free 
supply chains by 2030 or earlier. We have signed up for the Deforestation-Free Call to Action for 
Leather, launched by global non-profits Textile Exchange and LWG.  
99.7% of the leather that PUMA sourced in 2023 is from Leather Working Group-certified tanneries. This 
means that the leather used in PUMA products comes from manufacturers who are working to implement 
industry good practice standards of environmental management and traceability. PUMA currently monitors 
its LWG medal-rated tanneries‚Äô upstream traceability performance. 
Around 76% of the leather used at PUMA is Suede, a byproduct of the full-grain leather business. The 
challenge faced currently by PUMA and others in the industry is that most suede tanneries work with agents 
and intermediaries alongside direct tanneries, to guarantee a stable supply which creates a challenge 
to have full traceability at the cattle ranch level. 
Our innovation team has worked to address the technological limitations of a shoe designed for composting 
and launched the RE:SUEDE experiment. The upper of the RE:SUEDE is made of Zeology tanned suede. 
Synthetic Rubber: We sourced, 74% of our synthetic rubber from China, followed by Vietnam 14% and South 
Korea 4%. China and South Korea are high-risk countries. The risk profile for synthetic rubber from Vietnam 
is not available on the EiQ platform. High risks are greenhouse gas emissions, water use and solid waste.  
We have not yet mapped the manufacturing plants supplying synthetic rubber to our outsole manufacturers. 
As part of our 10FOR25 targets, we work on developing recycled materials as alternatives to rubber. In 2023, 
5% of synthetic rubber was recycled. We engage our strategic outsole suppliers in Higg FEM (environmental 


PUMA Annual Report 2023 
‚Üó Sustainability

performance tool measurement of which includes energy use and greenhouse gas emissions, water use, 
wastewater, emissions to air and waste management) and work with them to eliminate pollutant chemicals. 
Natural Rubber: In 2023, we sourced 29% of natural rubber from Vietnam, followed by Brazil 25%, 
Pakistan 13%, and Thailand 5%. Vietnam is categorised as an extreme-risk country. Risk profiles for natural 
rubber from Brazil, Pakistan and Thailand are not available on the EiQ platform. High risks are mainly water 
use and impact on the ecosystem. 
In 2023, only 2% of the rubber used in our products was natural rubber. We aim in the future to only source 
FSC-certified rubber. The FSC certification includes standards to maintain, conserve, and/or restore the 
ecosystem and environmental values of managed forests and also avoid, repair, or mitigate negative 
environmental impacts. 
SUPPLIER ENVIRONMENTAL SCORECARD 
In 2023, we developed environmental performance scorecards for core supplier factories to visualize their 
progress towards our 10FOR25 targets and 2022 goals. During one-to-one meetings, we explained the need 
for setting Science Based Targets to 21 selected suppliers, we reviewed the 2022 Environmental KPIs (E-
KPIs) for 60 suppliers and discussed their 2023 plans; the need for participation in cleaner production and 
renewable energy programmes for some factories was also discussed. Environmental KPIs include Higg 
FEM score, FEM chemical module score, MRSL conformance rate, wastewater test results, percentage of 
renewable energy usage, greenhouse gas emission per product or volume of material, percentage of water 
consumption reduction (per product or volume of material), percentage of production waste sent to landfill 
(per product or volume of material). 
These meetings were useful for understanding the challenges of our suppliers and for prioritizing our 
actions to support them. Key meetings outcomes: 
‚Ä¢ Alignment on setting Science-Based Targets (SBT): In summer 2023, 20 out of 21 selected suppliers 
agreed to set climate goals based on SBT methodology. In these meetings, we followed up our suppliers 
decision to set up SBT. In October 2023, in partnership with Guidehouse, we launched a capacity 
development programme for eight suppliers called Leadership on Climate Transition (LoCT), to support 
suppliers in this journey. In 2024, this programme will be expanded to other suppliers who do not have 
sufficient in-house or external expertise. 
‚Ä¢ Enrolment in cleaner production programmes: Factories were nominated to participate in Cleaner 
Production programmes based on their performance through E-KPIs and the expertise of their team 
members. In August 2023, Clean by Design (CbD) program phase three was launched in the China and 
Taiwan region for seven factories. A new programme called Resource Efficiency (REF) in partnership 
with ENERTEAM was started in Vietnam in August 2023 for four factories. The Cambodia Decarbonization 
Programme (CaDP) with IFC will be launched in early 2024 for four factories in Cambodia.  
‚Ä¢ Enrolment in renewable energy programmess: Suppliers shared their plans to complete feasibility 
studies or install rooftop solar systems. In the absence of adequate rooftop solar capacity, RECs 
purchases were discussed. The suppliers also highlighted their challenges. Subsequently, GIZ-PDP 
programme phase II was rolled out in Cambodia in February 2023 for one factory and in Vietnam in 
March 2023 for four factories to support rooftop solar installation.   
‚Ä¢ Phase-out of coal-fired boilers: We discussed this challenging goal with the relevant suppliers to align 
on a phase-out plan. Suppliers raised their concerns about the unstable availability of biomass, the 
absence of sustainable biomass guidelines, and the increased cost of natural gas. We will bring these 
challenges to the Fashion Charter working group to find solutions to address them. 
‚Ä¢ Higg FEM Performance: Discussions focused on FEM (Facility Environmental Module) score. We also 
acknowledged improvements made by factories with an increased score in 2022 (2021 FEM score). We 
aligned on the need for additional training and/or support, such as one-to-one support for low 
performing factories to improve their score. 210 factories in total were provided training on Higg FEM in 


PUMA Annual Report 2023 
‚Üó Sustainability 
98 
2023. As a result, the average 2022 FEM score of core factories improved to 69% from 61% (2021 FEM 
score). 
‚Ä¢ Chemical Management: we focused on the factories with low compliance with MRSL standards and 
ZDHC Wastewater Guidelines. We aligned with factories on the need to bring in chemical suppliers 
disclosing their chemicals to the ZDHC gateway, a platform used to upload factory chemicals inventory 
lists and measure their MRSL conformance rate. In February 2023, we invited chemical suppliers to join 
the training session on ZDHC MRSL conformance. We also worked with some key chemical suppliers to 
support them in complying with ZDHC MRSL standards. As a result of the efforts, the MRSL 
conformance rate has increased from 68% in 2022 to 71% in 2023, and the average Higg FEM Chemical 
module score improved from 39% in 2022 to 51% in 2023. For factories with low ZDHC Wastewater pass 
rate tests, we discussed their corrective action plans. In 2024, we will continue to engage them to get 
more chemicals to comply with ZDHC MRSL. 
 
FACTORY ENVIRONMENTAL PERFORMANCE MONITORING 
Social compliance audits: For suppliers, our PUMA social compliance audits (detailed in the Human Rights 
section) contain a dedicated section on environmental and chemical compliance. For example, during each 
audit, we inspect environmental permits, waste management and effluent treatment plants. In general, 
PUMA social compliance audits are used for onboarding new factories. 
Monitoring tools: For monitoring the environmental performance of suppliers, PUMA has used an industry-
wide tool, the Higg Index Facility Environmental Module (FEM) 3.0. PUMA requires an annual external 
verification of the self-assessment FEM modules. This external verification may be completed by approved 
verifiers from PUMA‚Äôs internal team, other credited brands, or third-party organisations on the approved list 
from SAC. 100% of verification inspections are announced. 
PUMA‚Äôs Environmental Performance Rating System is based on the ratings developed from the factories‚Äô 
Higg FEM score verified by SAC-approved verifiers: A, B+, B-, C and D. The minimum passing grade from 
the environmental perspective is 40% (i.e., only A, B+ and B- ratings are passing grades) and C and D are 
failure ratings. This rating system was presented to suppliers in 2022 and implemented gradually during 
2022 and 2023. Our environmental handbook has been updated accordingly. This rating system was included 
in our vendor supplier scorecard along with social and chemical ratings.

Since 2020, we have communicated to our core factories our expectation for them to improve their score by 
setting up annual goals and using our new grading system. In 2021, 2022 and 2023 we facilitated training 
sessions conducted by FEM experts. This training was compulsory for low-performance factories and for 
those not familiar with this industry tool to attend. We closely monitor the factories to ensure completion of 
the verification of their self-assessment. 
Throughout 2023, we continued to provide customised training sessions by FEM experts for our existing core 
Tier 1 and Tier 2, as well as non-core Tier 1 suppliers. The training focused on how to improve the Higg FEM 
score on low-performing areas for each region. We also facilitated entry-level training sessions for factories 
new to the Higg FEM tool. These trainings have helped our suppliers improve their environmental 
performance as is visible from the improved average FEM score for PUMA and stichd factories moving from 
61% in 2022 up to 68% in 2023. We also facilitated for our suppliers to attend webinars and workshops on 
Higg FEM 4.0 to be launched in 2024, organised by SAC. In Vietnam, we facilitated for 61 factories to join the 
training programme, To The Finish Line (TFL) initiative, from GIZ for building capacity to transition to Higg 
FEM 4.0. The TFL initiative online sessions explained the changes made in this new tool and how to answer 
new questions. 26 core factories from six countries participated in a Higg FEM 4.0 pilot initiated by SAC, 
after which our suppliers provided valuable feedback to SAC on the new version of Higg FEM.   
In 2023, all 131 PUMA core Tier 1 and Tier 2 factories completed the verification of their FEM self-
assessment. We have set a target to achieve an annual 10% increase of the average verified score from 2021 
(the goal was to reach 64% FEM score in 2023). We exceeded this target by achieving an average FEM score 
of 69%. Improvements are visible in all the sections of Higg FEM as compared to the previous year. PUMA‚Äôs 
average FEM score is higher than the industry median in each section. In 2023, we included our group 
company stichd‚Äôs core Tier 1 Higg FEM score. The combined average of PUMA and stichd also exceeded by 
achieving the target with an average score of 68%.  
The number of C-rated PUMA factories came down from 12 in 2022 to four in 2023. However, one factory in 
Brazil which is a new core factory and new to FEM received a D rating. We will provide additional training 
and support to improve their performance next year.  
In 2023, we continued to closely track factories to ensure the timely completion of their verifications. We saw 
the positive impact of our continued efforts to scale up cleaner production and renewable energy projects, 
climate action training, chemical projects, chemical management training and wastewater treatment 
training on the FEM scores of factories that had joined these programmes. For 2024 we have shared a goal 
of an average FEM score of 71% with our PUMA core suppliers, which needs to be reviewed as the Higg FEM 
will be going through a transition to Higg FEM 4.0.   
Overall, our core factories have a score above 70% on wastewater, water, energy and GHG emissions, and 
environment management systems. We see topics like chemicals, air and waste as a key focus. In 2021, we 
conducted a risk assessment for chemical and waste and identified actions to be taken in the coming years. 
PUMA, as one of the signatory brands under ZDHC, follows up closely on the development and the progress 
of ZDHC air emission standards and guidelines and will apply them in the supply chain as applicable, once 
details are available. In 2023, we joined the ZDHC air emission pilot which we report in the Water and Air 
section of this report.

Scope for non-core FEM assessment includes only PUMA factories. Does not include stichd non-core factories.   
In 2022, we rolled out FEM/Facility Environmental Foundation (FEP) which is a lighter version of FEM, to 
non-core factories in our top three sourcing countries (Vietnam, China and Bangladesh) and to the factories 
which are participating in the PUMA Vendor Financing Programme. As a continuation, in 2023 we rolled out 
FEM/FEP to 154 of our non-core factories. The purpose is to also create a supplier scorecard for our non-
core factories.  
Out of 154 factories, 141 completed the self-assessment. Out of these 141 factories, 116 factories used the 
FEM tool, and 109 had their score verified by third party. 25 factories used the FEP tool, and 21 have 
completed the verification. Most of our non-core facilities that had a verified FEM achieved an A or B rating, 
while 15 factories got a C rating and four factories recorded a D rating. We will work with these C- and D-
rated factories to improve their performance by providing training and support in 2024.   
Further data on the environmental performance of PUMA and our suppliers can be found in the Climate and 
Environmental Key Performance Data sections. 
SUPPLIER TRAINING 
32% of supplier factories out of the total (656 factories) were provided with Higg FEM training. Currently we 
are providing training to core Tier 1 and Tier 2, for which we set goals to increase their FEM score and non-
core Tier 1 factories for which we just required the use of FEM/FEP tool to measure their environmental 
performance (in additional to their social performance) in 2023. We will expand the roll-out of the FEM/FEP 
tool to licensee factories in the future and will include FEM training for stichd factories in 2024.   
The Finish Line (TFL) training by GIZ for Higg FEM 4.0 was only available in Vietnam and hence the 
percentage of total supplier factories covered is only 9%.  
Similarly, the percentage of factories coverage is only 15% for sustainable material certification training, as 
we currently only invite PUMA Tier 1 and core Tier 2 factories supplying recycled and other sustainable 
materials/products. We need to expand the scope of this training to include all suppliers in the future to 
raise awareness of recycled and other sustainable materials, as we aim at increasing the use of more 
sustainable materials in our products.

‚Üó CASE STUDIES 
Improvement in HIGG FEM Verified score 
Being a longtime partner to PUMA, Royal Footwear Group is producing PUMA products at three 
factories in Vietnam (Dai Loc Shoes, Sao Viet & Thien Loc Shoes). These three factories actively 
participated in different trainings on all sections of Higg FEM provided by PUMA and its training 
partner GIZ, and engaged in active consultation with PUMA‚Äôs Sustainability Team on its Performance 
Improvement Plan. As a result, these three factories significantly improved their verified Higg FEM 
total scores as compared to last year. Dai Loc increased its total verified score from 56% to 76%, Sao 
Viet from 40% to 77%, and Thien Loc from 46% to 75%. Significant improvements were made in 
sections like Environmental Management System, Chemical Management and Air Emissions.  
 
THE INSTITUTE OF PUBLIC & ENVIRONMENTAL AFFAIRS (IPE) IN CHINA 
PUMA is actively engaged with The Institute of Public & Environmental Affairs (IPE) which is a non-profit 
environmental research organisation based in Beijing, China. IPE is involved in collecting, arranging and 
analyzing government and corporate environmental information to build a database of environmental 
information. IPE has developed a database called Blue Map and an online platform called BlueEcochain and 
both are interconnected. Powered by IPE's Blue Map Database and AI technology, Blue EcoChain platform 
provides an efficient means of supply chain oversight for environmental risks in China. Blue EcoChain 
enables PUMA to track its suppliers in China for environmental compliance at scale, and sends automated 


PUMA Annual Report 2023 
‚Üó Sustainability 
103 
updates on regulatory violations and environmental remediation, as well as carbon emission and pollutant 
data disclosure continuously on a large scale. 
Since 2013, PUMA has used IPE‚Äôs Blue Map database to screen its China supply chain and pre-screen its 
potential new factories for any legal environmental violation and requires suppliers to improve on their 
environmental performance. PUMA also discloses its local supplier list via the IPE supply chain map 
platform. In these years, PUMA engaged and influenced its Tier 1 factories in China and their upstream 
suppliers, e.g. core Tier 2 and selected Tier 3 suppliers, chemical suppliers, centralised wastewater 
treatment plants, solid waste contractors, logistics partners, etc. to join ‚ÄúBlue EcoChain‚Äù to monitor and 
disclose their own environmental performance. These disclosures include their Pollutant Release and 
Transfer Register (PRTR) data, carbon emissions, targets for carbon emissions, and water consumption 
reduction. PUMA worked with its core Tier 1 and Tier 2 factories to reduce their greenhouse gas emissions 
and encourage them to disclose their action taken and progress made on the IPE platform.  
Through the Blue EcoChain platform and engagement with IPE, PUMA influenced its Tier 1 suppliers and 
their upstream suppliers to promptly issue public explanations regarding the reason for any environmental 
violations and encouraged them to adopt corrective actions and track their implementation. This 
supports PUMA Tier 1 factories in China to engage with their upstream suppliers for better practices and 
promote transparency.  
Since 2021, PUMA published its actions annually on the Brand Stories IPE webpage to communicate to the 
public in China about PUMA's activities related to environmental protection. 
2023 PUMA CITI & CATI RATINGS 
PUMA participated in the first CITI (Corporate Information Transparency Index) 
campaign in 2014 and first CATI (The Corporate Climate Action Transparency 
Index) campaign in 2018‚Äâto‚Äâscore and rank PUMA‚Äôs‚Äâenvironmental‚Äâmanagement 
and climate action. 
In 2023, PUMA jumped seven places compared to 2022 and was ranked number five in CITI out of 742 
brands. In the CITI 2023 rating, PUMA did well in responsiveness to inquiries and engagement with IPE, 
supply chain transparency, environmental compliance and corrective actions for any violations, energy 
conservation and GHG emission reduction. PUMA‚Äôs strength is also in publicly disclosed targets on low 
carbon and recycled products.‚Äâ  
PUMA also‚Äâjumped four places to be ranked number two in CATI out of 1,504 brands.‚ÄâIn this rating, PUMA 
climate governance such as policy and board accountability, Scope 1, 2 and 3 emissions and progress 
disclosure and targets, as well as product carbon footprint disclosure and disclosures on decarbonisation 
actions of our value chain was evaluated as strong areas by IPE. Disclosure of climate action by affiliated 
companies, such as the PUMA subsidiary in China, was identified as a major improvement area. Other 
improvement areas include the disclosure of our performance against PUMA‚Äôs net-zero target and our 
action to decarbonize our own operations such as PUMA offices, stores and warehouses.   
The details on our climate actions are provided in the Climate section of this report. ‚Äâ

The GHG Protocol Corporate Standard classifies a company's GHG emissions into three scopes: 
‚Ä¢ 
Scope 1: Direct GHG emissions from sources that are owned or controlled by the company (offices, stores, warehouses) 
e.g. office building heating, car fleet emissions. 
‚Ä¢ 
Scope 2: Indirect GHG emissions from the generation of purchased electricity, steam and heating/cooling consumed by 
the company  
‚Ä¢ 
Scope 3: All other indirect emissions not covered in Scope 2, such as extraction and production of purchased materials; 
transportation of purchased goods and use of sold products and services, business travel, employee commuting, etc. 
During the UN Climate Conference in Paris in 2015, PUMA agreed to set a science-based CO2 emissions 
target. In 2018 PUMA co-founded the Fashion Industry Charter for Climate Action, an industry-wide coalition 
that aims to align the fashion industry‚Äôs emissions with the targets included in the Paris Agreement. One 
year later, PUMA agreed and published its first science-based emission target (SBT), which was aligned to a 
well below 2-degree emission scenario with the SBT Coalition and joined the Fashion Pact, which also 
includes a climate action commitment. 
With an 85% reduction of own emissions (market-based, incl. the purchase of RECs) and a 65% reduction of 
supply chain emissions relative to sales, we achieved our first science-based greenhouse gas reduction 
target in 2023, seven years ahead of the target year 2030. 
In 2022, we already prepared an updated and more ambitious science-based greenhouse gas reduction target 
and aligned the target with a 1.5-degree scenario. We also published a net zero target for 2050 and added a 
100% renewable electricity target to our SBT proposal since we already committed to net zero GHG emissions 
and 100% renewable electricity as part of our Fashion Industry Charter for Climate Action engagement. Our 
updated science-based target was formally submitted to and approved by the SBTi in 2023. 
With a 90% absolute reduction target for PUMA's own operations by 2030, the new target sets a much higher 
ambition level for Scope 1 and 2 emissions, after the first target of 35% reduction had already been achieved 
in 2020, mainly through the purchase of renewable energy and renewable energy attribute certificates. The 
SBTi has classified PUMA Scope 1 and 2 targets as in line with a 1.5-degree trajectory. 
For Scope 3 emissions, the new 2030 target marks the transition from a target relative to sales (-60%) to an 
absolute reduction target of 33%. Given PUMA's strong growth rates, the new target could even be 
considered more ambitious.  
TRANSITION PLAN TOWARD OUR 2030 SCIENCE-BASED GHG REDUCTION TARGET 
During the year 2023, PUMA also developed and published its first climate transition plan. The plan lists the 
planned actions and investments toward hitting our 2030 climate targets.  
In 2023, PUMA‚Äôs Chief Sourcing Officer joined Zero 100, a membership-based research and intelligence 
organisation, to accelerate progress on Digital Supply Chain Transformation and the path to zero carbon 
emissions. Forward-thinking Chief Operations and Supply Chain Officers of international companies partner 
up, sharing a common purpose ‚Äì to harness new technology to re-invent the production, distribution 
and consumption of physical goods around the world. 
 
PUMA CDP CLIMATE SCORE: A 
The Carbon Disclosure Project (CDP) is an investor-led coalition that ranks global companies and cities for 
their climate strategies and disclosure. PUMA has been a long-term participant in the CDP, and we make 
our responses to the CDP questionnaire publicly available via the CDP website. In 2022, for the first time in 
PUMA‚Äôs history, we received an A score for our climate disclosure with CDP for the reporting year 2021. Until

Over the last two years, we have made significant improvements in value chain engagement, Scope 3 
emissions, risk management processes and risk disclosure, leading to the highest possible rating of A. Our 
score increased as a result of a host of initiatives taken, including facilitating climate training programmes 
for our suppliers, the participation of our suppliers in industry-wide resource efficiency and renewable 
energy programmes, participation in Higg FEM, the recalculation of Scope 3 emissions, in line with the 
greenhouse gas protocol,  life cycle assessments (LCA) for our products, the preparation of a climate 
roadmap for 2030 and a risk assessment.  
For more information, please visit the PUMA sustainability website or the CDP website. 
CLIMATE ROADMAP AND RISK ASSESSMENT 
In 2021 we developed a climate roadmap and conducted a risk assessment using our risk assessment 
methodology. This roadmap laid the foundation for our climate transition plan, which was published in 2023. 
We see a regulatory landscape with unfavourable policies for renewables in some countries as a high risk. 
Furthermore, unstable business in our industry overall can restrain suppliers from investing in technologies 
and upgrading their facilities with low-carbon machinery. 
Below are some key focus areas for the coming years. Some actions taken since 2021 and continued in 2023 
are covered in this report. 
‚Ä¢ Raise awareness: We realised that suppliers need specific training to achieve the ambitious renewable 
energy targets and that challenges vary from region to region. We facilitated certain training 
programmes in partnership with industry experts as per the needs of suppliers, such as the possibility of 
purchasing renewable energy certificates in various regions. In 2023, we launched a new capacity 
development programme, called Supplier Leadership on Climate Transition (LOCT), to enable selected 
suppliers to set and achieve Science Based Targets. Our suppliers continued to attend the GIZ Climate 
Training programme at their own pace in 2023. The details of these training sessions are provided in the 
table in ‚ÄúClimate Training 2023‚Äù.  
‚Ä¢ Knowledge of impact: In 2023, we continued to conduct Life Cycle Assessments (LCA) for two top-selling 
products. We also conducted a comparative LCA of three types of polyester team sports jerseys to 
evaluate the environmental impacts of virgin polyester, recycled polyester made from PET bottles and 
recycled polyester made from recycled post-consumer waste and PET bottles. We also conducted a 
comparative LCA study of the environmental impacts of virgin cotton and blended cotton (75% virgin and 
25% recycled). We intend to use the outcomes of these LCA studies to increase internal awareness and 
improve the products' carbon footprint by increasing the use of low-carbon materials, improving 
resource efficiency, optimizing energy use, promoting renewable energy in the value chain and 
enhancing the circularity of our products. LCA results are reported in the Products section of this report.

‚Ä¢ Internal action: We reviewed factories‚Äô performance scorecards in 2023 based on their Higg FEM overall 
score and chemical score with our sourcing leaders. We also discussed with suppliers about their 
performance through one-to-one meetings and aligned on the next steps. We initiated a pilot to test a 
data platform, which will help us to measure progress more frequently. We will keep our focus on 
increasing the use of recycled materials in our products and explore opportunities to use more 
biosynthetic materials. In 2023, PUMA upgraded its near-term science-based emissions reduction target 
which includes our Scope 1 and Scope 2 emission targets in line with a 1.5-degree Celsius trajectory. We 
continue to enroll more factories in cleaner production programmes and renewable energy 
programmes. In 2023, the number of core factories with coal-fired boilers reduced from 21 in 2022 to 17 
due to our business priorities that implied the revision of our core factory list. Two factories out of 17 
have successfully phased out coal and 11 factories have partially replaced coal. The remaining four 
factories completed a feasibility study and will initiate replacement in 2024. We remain committed to 
phasing out coal from our core supply chain.  
‚Ä¢ Collaboration and partnership: We will keep our active engagement in the Fashion Charter to drive 
collaboration on climate actions and influence policymakers to enable access to affordable renewable 
energy. In 2023, we participated in a dialogue event organised by UN Fashion Charter with Bangladesh 
policymakers on renewable energy policy.  
 
TASK FORCE ON CLIMATE-RELATED FINANCIAL DISCLOSURES (TCFD) 
Climate change has been a focus area for PUMA since the publication of the first Environmental Profit and 
Loss Account in 2011. As a long-term and A-ranked respondent of the investor-led CDP questionnaire and a 
founding member of the UN Fashion Industry Charter for Climate Action, PUMA has shown its commitment 
to combatting climate change. Subsequently, we recognise the importance of disclosing climate-related 
risks and opportunities in line with the recommendations of the TCFD, which are now being transitioned into 
the IFRS standards. 
The success of our business over the long term will depend on the social and environmental sustainability 
of our operations, the resilience of our supply chain and our ability to manage the potential impact of 
climate change on our business model and performance. 
Through the implementation of the recommendations set by the TCFD, we summarize the actions PUMA 
has taken to review its key climate-related risks and opportunities, and the potential impacts on its business 
and strategy. 
GOVERNANCE 
The PUMA Board of Management takes overall accountability for the management of all risks and 
opportunities, including climate change. PUMA‚Äôs CEO is responsible for the overall oversight of the group‚Äôs 
strategy, including the Sustainability Strategy. This includes climate-related targets as stated in PUMA‚Äôs 
10FOR25 sustainability targets. Besides the oversight of the CEO, PUMA‚Äôs Chief Sourcing Officer (CSO) 
oversees all sustainability-related topics at PUMA, including climate change, at the management board 
level. Responsibilities of the CSO include approving new climate-related targets, strategies and initiatives. 
Sustainability falls under the scope of the CSO because the vast majority of the environmental impact of 
PUMA‚Äôs activity is generated during the manufacturing of our products, which are sourced from 
independent third-party vendors. Therefore, to reduce our climate impact, our Sustainability Strategy needs 
to be driven through our supply chain into our vendors‚Äô factories and into the components we procure. 
Responsibility for these two activities lies with the CSO. 
The Supervisory Board Sustainability Committee is handling sustainability at a Supervisory Board level. The 
Management Board receives updates on sustainability-related matters quarterly, including those related to 
climate change. The CSO has a monthly meeting with the sustainability leads for corporate and supply chain 
sustainability in which climate and all other sustainability-related topics are governed. The Executive 
Sustainability Committee meets twice a year to discuss and govern cross-functional sustainability-related

topics, like the sustainability bonus targets. It is comprised of all functional heads of the company, such as 
People & Organisation, Sourcing, Finance, IT, Marketing, Risk Management, Investor Relations, Retail, 
Logistics and Legal Affairs. Sustainability at a product level is governed in a cross-functional business units 
call, where updates on PUMA‚Äôs more sustainable product strategy are shared and discussed monthly. To 
engage with PUMA‚Äôs worldwide subsidiaries on climate change and other sustainability-related topics, the 
corporate sustainability department organises a quarterly call in which the nominated sustainability leads 
for each PUMA subsidiary take part. 
All PUMA leaders globally ‚Äì from CEO to Team Head level ‚Äì have clearly defined sustainability targets as 
part of their annual performance bonus. These targets are aligned with PUMA‚Äôs FOREVER. BETTER. 
Sustainability Strategy and focus on our 10FOR25 target areas, including climate change. Climate-related 
bonus targets include a reduction in air freight to 0.5% as well as a gradual shift of PUMA‚Äôs car fleet to zero 
or low-emission vehicles. Targets on recycled polyester also support our Scope 3 GHG reduction. The 
targets cover 10% of the overall bonus for members of the Management Board and 5% for other leaders 
globally., with climate-related targets accounting for 2,5% and 1.25% respectively. 
Our sustainability governance structure is referenced in the Sustainability Organisation and Governance 
Structure section. 
 
STRATEGY AND RISK MANAGEMENT 
PUMA has analysed risks and opportunities related to climate change for over 10 years and identified 
climate change as a material risk to PUMA during its last materiality analyses conducted in 2018 and 2023. 
Climate Change has the potential to impact PUMA‚Äôs business in the short (0-2 years), medium (2-5 years) 
and long term (5-10 years). The climate-related risks can be grouped into physical risks and transitional 
risks. Physical risks for PUMA include extreme weather events, such as flooding or heat waves, or water 
scarcity, which can influence raw material availability. Transitional risks include all risks related to the 
transition to a low-carbon economy, such as changing consumer preferences, policies and regulations, such 
as carbon taxes or rising energy prices. 
The process for assessing, identifying and managing climate-related risks is the same for all principal risks 
and is described in the Risk Management section. All risks are monitored and reported regularly 
throughout the year by the risk owners, who are the managers of the functional areas and the managing 
directors of the subsidiaries. The risk owners are also responsible for the operational management of the 
identified risks. For example, climate risks concerning manufacturing in the supply chain are managed by 
PUMA‚Äôs Supply Chain Sustainability team. 
To identify the impact of potential climate-related risks, a scenario-based analysis of climate-related risks 
was commenced in 2022 (see G.16). The analysis is in line with TCFD recommendations by taking into 
consideration two different climate-related scenarios: first, to analyse transitional risks, the Net Zero 
Emissions by 2050 Scenario (NZE) developed by the IEA was considered. This scenario represents the 
development of a low-carbon economy in line with global warming of 2¬∞C or lower. It was also used to 
develop our 1.5¬∞C aligned science-based target, which was submitted at the beginning of 2023. Second, the 
impact of physical risks was assessed using the SSP2 ‚Äì RCP4.5 scenario. This scenario relies on the 
Representative Concentration Pathways (RCPs) and Shared Socioeconomic Pathways (SSPs) published by 
the IPCC and reflects the development of greenhouse gas emissions under current government policies, 
resulting in warming of about 2.7¬∞C by 2100 (per Climate Action Tracker). The different risk categories 
shown in G.16 are taken from our CDP 2023 response.

Climate-related risks and opportunities have influenced PUMA‚Äôs strategy in multiple areas. The demand for 
more sustainable products has influenced our product portfolio and sourcing practices to shift towards 
recycled and/or certified materials. On the supply chain side, PUMA invests in supplier programmes 
focused on energy efficiency and renewable energy to reduce the carbon footprint of its manufacturing 
process. PUMA is investigating and investing further in more sustainable material options, such as 
biodegradable or recyclable materials. Additionally, PUMA operates its Circular Lab, under which it 
collaborates with innovation partners on different pilot projects, such as a garment-to-garment recycling 
process and a biodegradable shoe. Within its own operations, PUMA reduces its carbon footprint by 
sourcing 100% renewable electricity since 2020 and by gradually shifting its car fleet to low- and zero-
emissions vehicles. 
Climate-related issues also had an impact on PUMA‚Äôs financial planning. Direct costs have been influenced 
by ESG-linked supplier financing programmes that have been in place since 2016. The programme provides 
access for PUMA suppliers to external financing resources with favourable financing conditions. 
Additionally, as part of the EU Taxonomy Regulations, PUMA is required to report on capital expenditures 
that lead to greenhouse gas reductions. PUMA‚Äôs sales are currently not eligible under the EU Taxonomy 
Regulation due to the nature of PUMA‚Äôs business (sale of footwear and apparel). In 2023, PUMA identified 


PUMA Annual Report 2023 
‚Üó Sustainability 
110 
investments in zero-emissions vehicles and infrastructure such as charging stations as well as solar PV 
installations to be aligned with Taxonomy criteria. The overall Taxonomy-aligned investment amounts to 
EUR 910,000. Further information on the EU Taxonomy can be found in the Reporting in Accordance with the 
EU Taxonomy Regulation section. Sustainability also influences PUMA‚Äôs access to capital as it becomes an 
increasingly important topic for attracting equity and investors. In 2023, PUMA received an AAA rating from 
MSCI for its sustainability efforts. PUMA is also listed in the FTSE4Good Index. Our Investor Relations and 
Sustainability teams are in an ongoing dialogue with investors on ESG topics. PUMA maintains a revolving 
credit facility and two promissory notes, which are linked to the achievements of five ESG targets as defined 
within our 10FOR25 ESG framework. The targets relate to the sourcing of renewable electricity (climate), 
sourcing of materials from certified sources (biodiversity), reduction of water consumption at core suppliers 
(water and air), elimination of plastic bags in stores (plastics and the oceans) and community engagement 
(human rights). 
The results of our scenario analysis are used to ensure the necessary mitigating controls are in place, 
support PUMA‚Äôs risk management activities and inform future business strategies. We will update our 
scenario modeling as more climate data becomes available and regularly reframe the risks and 
opportunities to PUMA presented by climate change. 
METRICS AND TARGETS 
PUMA has been measuring and reporting environmental key indicators for its own operations and its T1 and 
T2 suppliers for many years, including energy consumption, carbon emissions, water consumption and 
waste management. These are part of the Sustainability section of its Annual Report, which is published 
annually and audited by a third party. 
PUMA aligns its reporting on climate-related metrics with recognised standards, including the GHG Protocol. 
In addition, our 10FOR25 sustainability targets include absolute carbon reductions, renewable energy 
procurement and manufacturing of more sustainable products. Further information on our environmental 
KPIs can be found in the Environmental Key Performance Data section and throughout this report. 
Sourcing 100% renewable electricity for all PUMA entities from 2020 is one of the milestones of PUMA‚Äôs 
climate change mitigation efforts. For its suppliers, PUMA has a target of sourcing 25% renewable energy 
by 2025 (2023: 22.1%). During 2023, our 1.5 degree aligned near-term SBT was approved by the Science 
Based Target Initiative: reducing absolute Scope 1 and 2 GHG emissions by 90% (market-based*, including 
the purchase of RECs) by 2030 and reducing absolute Scope 3 GHG emissions by 33% by 2030, both from a 
2017 baseline year. 
‚Ä¢ Scope 1 and 2 targets focus on GHG emissions from our direct operations (including electricity and gas 
consumption at our stores, offices, internal manufacturing and distribution centres) 
‚Ä¢ Scope 3 targets relate to indirect GHG emissions in our extended supply chain and the transportation of 
finished goods 
By the end of 2023, PUMA had already reduced its combined Scope 1 and 2 emissions by 85% and its Scope 3 
emissions from purchased goods and services and transportation by 28%. Our efforts in sourcing more 
sustainable materials led to 99.2% cotton, 99,7% leather and 85% polyester coming from recycled or 
certified sources and eight out of ten products being more sustainable in line with our internal definition. We 
also reduced our GHG emissions from materials by 50%.

As part of its commitment to the UN convened Fashion Industry Charter for Climate Action, and according to 
PUMA‚Äôs Environmental Handbook, PUMA declared its ambitions to meet a net zero 2050 goal. PUMA 
recognises that meeting its climate-related targets is dependent on collective action and focus. Improving 
the market conditions for clean energy supply, such as the rate of installation of renewable electricity in 
many countries, reducing costs and the availability of power purchase agreements (PPAs) will help shift the 
rate of decarbonisation at scale. PUMA believes it has a role to play in helping to shape the policy and 
regulations required and is working collaboratively with partners, suppliers and other organisations to 
achieve its ambition, including the United Nations Global Compact, the UN Fashion Industry Charter for 
Climate Action, the Fashion Pact and Stiftung Klimawirtschaft. PUMA met with representatives of the 
delegations of Bangladesh, Indonesia and Vietnam during the UN COP 28 climate conference to promote the 
further expansion of renewable energy in those countries. 
 
SCOPE 1 EMISSIONS 
Our own direct CO2 emissions (Scope 1) are mainly caused by emissions from our PUMA car fleet and 
airplane, as well as emissions from the heating of buildings. We are tackling the emissions from our car 
fleet by gradually transitioning to zero-emission vehicles in those countries where the charging 
infrastructure is mature enough to support the transition. Starting in 2023, only electric vehicles are allowed 
as new additions to our car fleet in the region of Germany, Austria and Switzerland, which includes our 
Headquarters and 242 cars. At the end of 2023, 319 out of 905 cars (35%) globally were already low or zero -
emission battery electric or hydrogen fuel cell cars, in line with our bonus target of hitting 30%. 
We also significantly expanded the charging infrastructure at our headquarters and selected other offices 
and now have over 75 charging stations in operation, including twelve public charging stations at our 
headquarters stores that can be used by employees, business partners and customers free of charge. 
For the heating of buildings, we use natural gas in 8% of buildings globally and plan to transition these 
buildings to biogas or other renewable heat sources over time. Many PUMA buildings globally already use 
(renewable) electricity for heating. 
Overall we were able to reduce our Scope 1 GHG emissions by 17% between 2017 and 2023, and plan to 
reduce these emissions further by 2025. 
 
SCOPE 2 EMISSIONS 
PUMA‚Äôs indirect GHG emissions (Scope 2) are caused by the electricity used for running our offices, stores 
and warehouses, including the charging of electric cars, as well as thermal energy used from district 
heating. 
All of our offices, stores and warehouses have used renewable electricity via green electricity tariffs or 
renewable energy attribute certificates since 2020. This has led to a significant reduction of our Scope 2 
emissions (market-based). In addition, the closure of our stores in Russia, which were mostly heated by 
district heating, contributed further to the reduction of Scope 2 emissions. At our headquarters, which is by 
far the largest consumer of district heat among all PUMA entities, the district heat is created in co-
generation with electricity and by using over 50% biogas. In total, we were able to reduce our Scope 2 
emissions by 99% (market-based, incl. the purchase of RECs) since 2017. 
Further actions to reduce PUMA‚Äôs own greenhouse gas emissions include the use of energy-efficient heat 
pumps at our headquarters, frequent energy efficiency audits at our stores, a free public transport ticket for 
employees, job-bike-leasing and a meat-free Monday at canteens.

The values for November and December 2023 were estimated by employing the Exponential Smoothing (ETS) algorithm in 
Microsoft Excel, utilizing data from January to October of 2023. This approach was chosen after comparing it to alternative 
methods, considering its performance against actual historical data, specifically in terms of deviation from the actual values 
in percentage terms. The ETS method displayed higher accuracy and higher precision compared to other methods, such as 
averaging the last 10/12 months or multiplying the estimated production by the average KPI (per production unit) from the 12 
months of data spanning from November 2021 to October 2022.

PUMA is determined to reduce its carbon emissions, water usage, waste and air pollution at its offices and 
in its supply chain. For materials, PUMA strives to use more sustainable materials, such as cotton, 
polyester, leather and cardboard. 
The purpose of PUMA‚Äôs environmental efforts is to ensure that its suppliers are in full environmental 
compliance and any negative impact on the environment is reduced. Ultimately, our goal is to achieve a 
positive environmental impact. We ask all of our core suppliers to complete the Facilities Environmental 
Module developed by the SAC. 
For climate, PUMA‚Äôs 10FOR25 action plan includes steps such as: 
‚Ä¢ Work with industry peers on climate action through the Fashion Industry Charter for Climate Action and 
the Fashion Pact. 
‚Ä¢ Joining industry-level energy efficiency programmes for suppliers in our top five sourcing regions. 
‚Ä¢ Joining industry-level programmes for renewable energy in our top five sourcing regions. 
‚Ä¢ Replacing all coal-fired boilers at PUMA‚Äôs core suppliers. 
‚Ä¢ Gradually transitioning to materials with a lower carbon footprint, such as recycled polyester. 
To reduce the emissions from the production of our PUMA products, we worked with our suppliers on 
programmes ranging from energy efficiency to installing on-site solar photovoltaic power plants to generate 
renewable energy.  
The reduction of our Scope 3 emissions at the factory level is complemented by using more sustainable 
(less carbon-intensive) raw materials. In 2023, we used 85% more sustainable polyester, of which 61.8% was 
recycled polyester; 99.2% more sustainable cotton, mainly from the Better Cotton Initiative (BCI) and 99.7% 
leather from Leather Working Group medal-rated tanneries. In addition, 99.4% of our paper and cardboard 
packaging was recycled or FSC-certified paper. By 2025 we aim to use 75% recycled polyester and 100% 
recycled and/or certified paper and cardboard. 
Supplier Training and Programme 
In 2021, PUMA joined hands with other brands and key suppliers under the UN-led Fashion Industry Charter 
for Climate Action to develop a standard training programme on climate action for apparel and footwear 
suppliers in Asia, in partnership with GIZ. This online training programme provides foundational knowledge 
for suppliers on global decarbonisation efforts, GHG emissions accounting, climate target-setting 
methodology and solutions to reduce emissions and achieve these targets. The training is available in 
English and other local languages such as Khmer, Mandarin, Bengali and Vietnamese. We encouraged our 
suppliers to participate in this training, available free of charge.  
The training provides foundational knowledge to suppliers on:  
‚Ä¢ Understanding global decarbonisation efforts  
‚Ä¢ How to account for GHG emissions 
‚Ä¢ How to implement available energy solutions to reduce emissions 
In 2023, we continued to encourage factories to join the GIZ‚Äôs Climate Action Training. 57 participants from 
42 factories completed the course and attempted the final exam. 100% of the participants successfully 
passed the exam and obtained the certificate from GIZ, with an average score of 75%.  Since 2021, 933 
participants from 284 factories have completed this course.

In 2023, we provided training to our suppliers on Science Based Target setting, renewable energy 
procurement through RECs, carbon trading and energy efficiency. This climate-related training helped to 
accelerate the implementation of rooftop solar projects, increase the purchase of renewable energy 
attribute certificates and initiate coal phase-out measures. The progress made in these areas are described 
in this report.  
In 2023, we approached 21 selected supplier groups representing 40-50% of our business volume to suggest 
that they set Science-Based Targets at a company level (covering all of their factories, including the ones 
not producing for PUMA). In March 2023, 19 out of these 21 suppliers agreed to set up SBT; one supplier 
declined, and one supplier already had an approved target. In October 2023, we engaged with Guidehouse to 
launch the Supplier Leadership On Climate Transition (LOCT) capacity development programme. The 
programme provides a web-based platform to learn and implement a step-by-step approach for 
setting Science Based Targets and guidance on how to achieve those targets. Nine suppliers registered to 
join this programme in 2023. However, only eight suppliers joined, since one supplier selected a training 
available only after a supplier has set SBT. This supplier will join the programme in 2024. We expect more 
suppliers to join in early 2024. We do not expect all 20 suppliers to join this programme, since some 
suppliers have the required expertise in-house or are already engaged with a consultant to support them. 
The renewable energy procurement training conducted by Monsson Carbon for Vietnam, Cambodia, 
Indonesia and the Philippines focused on how to procure energy attribute certificates such as iRECs, while 
the training conducted by Envision in China and Taiwan focused on iREC procurement and other green 
energy procurement schemes available in the region like green electricity consumption certificate (GECC). 
The percentage of training participation for factories in renewable energy procurement is 53%; as it was a 
refresher training in 2023, the supplier factories which have already purchased iRECs, or other forms of 
green energy certificates did not join.  
In 2023, a training on carbon trading provided by IMPAQ (a
 third party organisation) was only relevant for 
textile/fabric core Tier 2 factories located in mainland China. However, all core Tier 1 and Tier 2 factories 
located in China and Taiwan regions were invited to attend for awareness about regulatory requirements in 
the area. As per these requirements, heavy industries in Guangdong province with greenhouse gas emissions 
of more than 10,000 tons per year or energy consumption of at least 5,000 tons of standard coal per year are 
required to be included in a carbon trading scheme. Although the textile sector is one of the potential sectors 
to be included, this regulation is still not enforced for the textile sector. Because of this, 53% of core Tier 2 
textile factories invited attended this training, whereas only 44% of non-textile core Tier 2 factories joined this 
session. However, 76% core Tier 1 factories joined this training due to better engagement with them. In total, 
59% of factories invited attended this training. If the scope of these regulatory requirements expands to other 
product divisions, we will continue to provide this training in the future.   
For the German Training Week on Energy Efficiency programme, organised by GIZ in Vietnam, PUMA was 
allocated only eight slots, and eight core factories joined the programme. Hence, the percentage of core 
factories which participated relative to the total number of core factories in Vietnam (47) is only 17%.

To improve the awareness level of PUMA employees, we developed a foundational e-learning training 
module on climate action for all employees which is expected to be rolled out in the first half of 2024. In 
2023, we launched phase 3 of Clean by Design (CbD) in the China-Taiwan region in partnership with Apparel 
Impact Institute (Aii) at two core Tier 1 and five core Tier 2 factories. We also kicked off a new resource 
efficiency programme called REF Programme at four core Tier 1 factories in Vietnam in partnership with 
ENERTEAM. In early 2024, we will launch an IFC cleaner production programme, called Decarbonization 
programme (CaDP) in Cambodia at three core Tier 1 and 1 core Tier 2 factories.   
In addition to this, four Tier 1 and three Tier 2 factories participated in various rooftop solar projects in 2023.  
The macroeconomic situation and overall uncertainty in the trade remained challenging during the first half 
of 2023. Recession fears in various markets, persistent high inflation and elevated interest rates led to 
muted consumer sentiment and volatile demand in retail. In addition, elevated inventory levels in the 
market contributed to a slower sell-in to the Wholesale channel. This created less demand from the 
markets, and we had to adjust our orders accordingly. This explains why we did not launch Renewable 
Energy programmes in 2023 to cover 76% sourcing volume of Tier 1, 75% sourcing volume of Tier 2, and 
cleaner production programme to cover 74% sourcing volume of Tier 1 and 75% sourcing volume of Tier 2, 
as reported in our 2022 annual report. 
The values below represent annual savings from completed and ongoing projects (PaCT programme in

Coal-Fired Boiler Phase-Out 
We are committed to phasing out coal-fired boilers from our supply chain, mainly from the core Tier 1 and 
Tier 2 suppliers, by 2025. In 2022, we mapped our core suppliers and found that 21 of them have coal-fired 
boilers. In 2023, the number of core factories with coal fired boilers reduced to 17 due to revisions in the core 
factory list, out of which two factories have successfully phased out coal and 11 factories have partially 
replaced coal. In 2024, we plan to engage with remaining four factories which have not yet initiated the 
transition. We also plan to continue our tracking of factories which are under transition.  
‚Üó G.16 COAL-FIRED BOILER PHASE OUT STATUS 
 
In 2022 PUMA joined the Coal Phase Out Action Group under the UN‚Äôs Fashion Charter, with an objective to 
collaborate with other brands to expedite the phase-out of coal in our supply chain. We included a coal-fired 
boiler question in our on-boarding checklist for new factories in July 2022, to avoid on-boarding such 
factories with coal-fired boiler. 
 
As a first step the brands have mapped their supply chain to identify supplier factories with coal fired 
boilers, and also identified the overlapping suppliers to prioritize these factories. GIZ joined this programme 
as an implementation partner and offered a coal phase-out pilot in Vietnam. This programme has a 10-step 
approach to realize coal phase out. Currently we are exploring options to partner with other brands to test 
the programme in our supply chain.  
 
‚Üó CASE STUDY 
Coal phase-out 
In 2023, Chen Tai (Vietnam) Woven Tapes Enterprise Co., Ltd. successfully phased out the use of coal 
for its boiler by switching to rice husk biomass. Not only did this transition allow the facility to reduce  
their GHG emissions by 2,600 tCO2e, it also helped the facility to save 20% in fuel costs.   
 
Supplier Climate Targets 
Science based targets are ambitious and difficult to achieve. Only large suppliers with capacity and top 
management commitment will be able to succeed. Those suppliers are identified through a readiness 
survey, climate investment study, long term business potential and in alignment with sourcing leaders. For 
the remaining suppliers, we plan to implement a simplified target setting system and hence an in-house 
tool is being developed for these suppliers.

In 2021, we developed two training modules for our core suppliers with the objective of driving climate target 
setting. One module focuses on the group of suppliers that need to establish science-based targets, and the 
other is aimed at the group of suppliers that needs to establish climate targets based on a simplified tool 
developed in-house. 
In continuation of efforts made in 2021 regarding SBT for key suppliers, we conducted a climate investment 
survey for our top 20 suppliers and evaluated long-term business potential with them in alignment with our 
sourcing leaders. We evaluated their readiness level to set a SBT in future.  
In 2023, we approached 21 selected supplier groups representing 40-50% of our business volume, 
to suggest them to set Science-Based Targets on company level (covering all of their factories including the 
ones not producing for PUMA). In March 2023 we kicked it off through a meeting, to go in detail through SBT 
process with the help of CDP. 19 out of these 21 suppliers agreed to set up SBT, one supplier declined, and 
one supplier already had an approved target. To encourage peer learning and to learn from industry experts 
we launched regular networking sessions on SBT. So far, we have completed two this year after the kickoff 
meeting in March. One supplier has already an SBT approved by SBTi, one has science-aligned targets 
(Scope 1 and 2) approved by World Resources Institute (WRI), nine suppliers are in process of getting 
SBT approved. 
Supplier Leadership On Climate Transition (LOCT) Programme 
In October 2023, we engaged with Guidehouse to launch a capacity development programme called Supplier 
Leadership On Climate Transition (LOCT). The programme provides a web-based platform to learn and 
implement a step-by-step approach for setting Science Based Targets and guidance on how to achieve those 
targets. So far, nine suppliers registered to join this programme in fall 2023. However, only eight suppliers 
joined, since one supplier selected a training available only after a supplier has set a SBT. This supplier will 
join the programme in 2024. We expect some other suppliers to join in early 2024.

‚Üó CASE STUDIES 
Resource efficiency 
TST Group, which is one of our dyed fabrics suppliers, has implemented an innovative low-carbon 
coloration process, at its dyeing mills located in China and Cambodia. The supplier has installed 
advanced dyeing machines such as low liquor ratio dyeing machines, which require much less water 
than conventional dyeing machines. The factories also switched from batch to continuous 
pretreatment (preparation of fabric for dyeing) and continuous after-treatment (finishing of fabric) 
which are more efficient processes and hence consume less energy and water. These initiatives are 
estimated to reduce water usage by 70% and carbon footprint by 60% as compared to the 
conventional dyeing process in China. In Cambodia, it is estimated to reduce water usage by 40% and 
carbon footprint by 45% compared to the conventional process. TST has also gone for cold pad batch 
dyeing machines in its Chinese factory, which dye fabric in a cold condition, rather than in a heated 
condition in the conventional dyeing process. This technology, along with continuous pre-treatment 
and continuous after-treatment, is estimated to reduce water consumption by 75%, carbon footprint 
by 55% and chemical consumption by 90% compared to conventional dyeing process. The 
environmental benefit of these initiatives can be evidenced from water and energy data we collected. 
TST China‚Äôs GHG emissions are 54% lower, and the water consumption is 16% less than PUMA 
suppliers' average for textile mills. TST Cambodia‚Äôs GHG emissions are 50% lower and the water 
consumption is 10% less than PUMA suppliers‚Äô average for the textile mills.  
 
Solar PV 
The Urmi Group, a renowned group of companies based in Bangladesh, has committed to reducing 
the greenhouse gas emissions from its business operations by 52.6% (intensity) by 2027 compared to 
the baseline year 2017. Therefore, Fakhruddin Textile Mills Ltd., one of the largest textile 
manufacturing units of the Urmi Group, installed roof-top solar panels in April 2022 and started to 
add renewable energy with a full design capacity of 2.5 MWp. As a result, solar PV is contributing to 
increasing the share of renewable energy and lessening GHG emissions into the atmosphere. In 
2023, renewable electricity consumption accounted for 10% of the total electricity consumption 
(purchased & captive) of the factory. At the same time, the factory lowered its emissions by 1,216 
tCO2e of greenhouse gas annually.  
 
 
Forest, Land and Agriculture (FLAG) emissions estimation  
As required by the Science Based Target Initiative (SBTi), in 2023 we undertook a study to estimate the 
greenhouse gas emissions from the Forest, Land and Agriculture (FLAG) sector of our supply chain. The 
SBT requirement states that we need to set a target for FLAG emissions, if the FLAG-related emissions total 
20% or more of our Scope 1, 2 and 3 emissions. PUMA engaged leading sustainability consultant Sphera to 
assess the FLAG footprint of our materials; the assessment indicates that FLAG emissions constitute 3% of 
the total emissions in 2022 and 4% in the baseline of 2017. Thus, there is no requirement for PUMA to set 
separate FLAG targets under SBT. Out of the total FLAG emissions cotton accounts for 55% of emissions 
followed by leather which contributes 26%.

The values for November and December 2023 were estimated by employing the Exponential Smoothing (ETS) algorithm in 
Microsoft Excel, utilizing data from January to October of 2023. This approach was chosen after comparing it to alternative 
methods, considering its performance against actual historical data, specifically in terms of deviation from the actual values 
in percentage terms. The ETS method displayed both higher accuracy and higher precision compared to other methods, 
such as averaging the last 10/12 months or multiplying the estimated production by the average KPI (per production unit) 
from the 12 months of data spanning from November 2021 to October 2022.

its suppliers related to PUMA products and associated packaging. This excludes emissions associated with other goods and 
services acquired by PUMA offices, stores and warehouses. 
We can see that our absolute Scope 3 emissions from the purchased goods and services category have 
decreased by 30% from 2017 to 2023, while material consumption has in increased by 10% during the same 
period.  
In view of the global macroeconomic situation, which has led to a change in customers' ordering behaviour, 
and the normalisation of the supply chain, we saw a decline in the order book in the first half of the year and 
stabilisation during the second half, with a return to the pre-pandemic ordering practices. Therefore, we 
actively adjusted sourcing activities respectively and continued to provide transparency to our sourcing 
partners so they can adjust their capacities accordingly. This explains why material consumption and energy 
consumption decreased compared with 2022. This contributed to our absolute greenhouse gas emission 
reduction, alongside energy efficiency improvements and the increased use of renewable electricity at a 
factory level, as well as the usage of more sustainable materials. 
Scope 3 Category 1 emissions mainly originate from two sources; the raw materials and the energy 
consumed by our core Tier 1, Tier 2, Tier 3 (production of raw material) suppliers to produce finished 
materials and components as well as finished goods. A breakdown of total GHG emissions by source is 
presented below. 
‚Üó G.18 GHG EMISSIONS BY SOURCE 
 
Carbon footprint at a supply chain level 
Looking deeper into the emissions from our supply chain, we see that absolute GHG emissions from Tier 1 
and Tier 2 suppliers were 3% lower in 2023 than in 2017. 65% of greenhouse gas emissions are coming from 
Tier 2 factories while 35% of emissions are contributed by Tier 1 factories. Drilling down into product 
divisions, we can see that the Tier 2 textile/fabric mills contribute a maximum of 61% followed by Tier 1 
footwear factories with 26%. This is mainly due to the higher energy footprint of Tier 2 textile wet processing 
units. Further analysis indicates that absolute emissions from Textile Tier 2 factories have increased by 
18% while the production of textile/fabric for PUMA factories has increased by 23% in 2023 as compared to 
2017. The absolute emissions from Footwear Tier 1 factories have reduced by 17% in 2023 as compared to 
2017, while the PUMA production from Tier 1 Footwear factories has increased by 31%. This was achieved 
due to the participation of these factories in cleaner production, renewable energy programmes and the 
purchase of iRECs. 
Absolute GHG emissions from Tier 3 suppliers in 2023 saw a marginal increase of 0.3% compared to 2017. A 
closer look at the data indicates that this marginal increase in absolute emissions from Tier 3 suppliers is 
mainly due to a rise in the consumption of polyester and polyurethane during this period. Polyester and

polyurethane together increased by 27% in 2023 as compared to 2017; this was mainly due to an increase in 
sourcing volume but also because our material data quality and accuracy has improved since 2021.  
We see opportunities to further scale up cleaner production and renewable energy programmes to more 
Tier 1 and Tier 2 suppliers, and also to launch them at some of the spinners (Tier 3). 
In 2023, we mapped our core Tier 3 spinning mills for the Apparel division through our core Tier 1 and Tier 2 
suppliers. We could identify 20 spinning mills. We collected yarn volume supply for PUMA production in 2022 
for 19 mills. These 19 factories represented 25.8% of our total volume of yarns sourced in 2022. The objective 
was to engage these factories to collect primary energy data from Tier 3 suppliers to calculate greenhouse 
gas Scope 3 emissions rather than estimating the emissions from Tier 3 factories by using raw material 
data and subsequently to engage them on cleaner production and renewable energy programmes. We 
provided training to these Tier 3 suppliers on energy data questionnaires and asked them to provide the 
data. However, we faced many challenges, including a lack of willingness on the part of these Tier 3 
suppliers to provide energy data and supporting documents.  
Only eight factories submitted data. Out of these eight factories only three factories‚Äô data could be validated.

The values for November and December 2023 were estimated by employing the Exponential Smoothing (ETS) algorithm in 
Microsoft Excel, utilizing data from January to October of 2023. This approach was chosen after comparing it to alternative 
methods, considering its performance against actual historical data, specifically in terms of deviation from the actual values 
in percentage terms. The ETS method displayed both higher accuracy and higher precision compared to other methods, 
such as averaging the last 10/12 months or multiplying the estimated production by the average KPI (per production unit) 
from the 12 months of data spanning from November 2021 to October 2022. 
Note: Tier 1 & Tier 2 emissions are estimated based on actual energy consumption collected from core Tier 1 and Tier 2

Carbon Footprint At A Raw Material Level 
Absolute GHG emissions from raw material consumption fell by 50% even as total material consumption 
increased by 10% since 2017. This was achieved due to our continuous endeavour to shift towards more 
sustainable materials and other measures. More sustainable cotton and polyester increased from 40% and 
47% in 2017 to 99.2% and 85% respectively in 2023. In view of the global macroeconomic situation, which has 
led to a change in customers' ordering behaviour, and the normalisation of the supply chain, we saw a

Assumptions: During the Scope 3 assessment, it was observed that material data collection has improved over time and 
that, since 2021, we have been able to capture the material data comprehensively. For example, 2017, material data was not 
available for all types of materials and some material data were incomplete. In the absence of comprehensive raw material 
data for 2017, material data was extrapolated from 2020. Furthermore, we observed that the polyester consumption data for 
footwear was exceptionally high for 2020 and possibly erroneously overestimated. Therefore, the polyester data for footwear 
for 2017 and 2020 was extrapolated from 2019 data. 
A breakdown analysis as shown in the following chart indicates that polyurethane (23%) contributes the 
most, followed by leather (18%) and polyester (17%). The share of rubber has significantly reduced from 33% 
in 2017 to 15% in 2023, mainly due to a reduction in rubber consumption during the same period, while 
the share of polyurethane has significantly increased from 7% in 2017 to 23% in 2023, and polyester‚Äôs share 
has increased from 12% to 17% mainly due to significant increase in polyurethane and polyester 
consumption during the same period. The share of leather has fallen from 21% in 2017 to 18% in in 2023. This 
is due to a combination of strategies to replace leather with polyurethane and textile and the improved 
capture of leather data in 2023, as we collected suede leather and grain leather data separately and suede 
leather has a lower carbon footprint than full grain leather.  
The analysis for 2023 indicates that we need to focus more on sustainable alternatives for polyurethane, 
polyester, leather and synthetic rubber.

In 2023, we evaluated the energy and water footprint at a raw material level. The results indicates that the 
energy footprint of rubber is the highest (25.1%) followed by polyurethane (21.2%) and polyester (20.9%). 
When it comes to water cotton has the highest share (72.5%) followed by polyester (12.6%). We intend to use 
this analysis for material selection purposes to reduce the energy and water footprint of our products.    
Renewable Energy  
In line with our 10FOR25 target to achieve a 25% share of renewable energy for core Tier 1 and Tier 2 
suppliers, we have set a goal of 15% renewable energy share for 2023. The share of renewable energy 
consumption by Tier 1 suppliers increased from 11.3% in 2022 to 23.1% in 2023 and Tier 2 suppliers increased 
from 10.8% in 2022 to 21.7% in 2023. The increase in both tiers therefore has helped PUMA to reach an 
overall share of renewable energy of 22.1% in 2023, greatly exceeding our target. This was mainly achieved 
due to the participation of the core suppliers in renewable energy projects, followed by the installation of 
rooftop solar facilities, switching from coal to biomass and the purchase of energy attribute certificates 
by both core Tier 1 and Tier 2 suppliers.

Renewable electricity 
The share of renewable electricity sourcing by Tier 1 and Tier 2 suppliers has increased from 0.35% in 2017 
to 27.4% in 2023. Looking at the Tiers in the value chain, the share of renewable electricity has increased 
from 0.18% in 2017 to 18.0% in 2023 by Tier 1 suppliers, while it has increased from 0.74% to a 
significant 47.2% for Tier 2 suppliers during the same period including the purchase of RECs by suppliers.   
This progress is achieved due to publicly disclosed 2025 goals on renewable energy, one-to-one follow-up 
meetings with the suppliers, the participation of factories in renewable energy programmes which led to 
the installation of roof-top solar PV and the purchase of RECs. Support from the Sourcing department has 
played a major role in engaging with our core suppliers.

Policy Advocacy 
As a part of Policy Engagement working group under Fashion Industry Charter for Climate Action. In 2023, 
the UNFCCC organised a policy dialogue event with stakeholders in Bangladesh. The purpose of this policy 
dialogue was to initiate an inclusive but focused discussion among key stakeholders in the fashion sector 
about how to jointly effect the required changes, identify actions that can be taken in the near-term future to 
accelerate renewable energy, support scaling renewable energy solutions, and connect existing efforts on 
the ground with best practice case studies. 
PUMA participated in this policy dialogue event on February 27
th, 2023, along with other brands. The key 
outcomes were: 
‚Ä¢ The government of Bangladesh remains committed to accelerating transition to renewables.  
‚Ä¢ Discussions were focused on exploring direct Power Purchase Agreements (PPAs) as a solution for 
transiting to renewable energy in Bangladesh. 
‚Ä¢ The need for fiscal and tax incentives, including upgrade of tariffs were identified as key required policy 
interventions. 
‚Ä¢ Opportunities to identify financing for renewable energy were another key aspect which needs to be

GREENHOUSE GAS EMISSIONS FROM THE TRANSPORT OF GOODS 
PUMA‚Äôs Logistics Team has been working on reducing greenhouse gas emissions from the transport of 
goods for several years. Key measures include the optimisation of container loads, as well as reducing 
airfreight to an absolute minimum. Air freight reduction is also part of PUMA‚Äôs annual bonus targets.   
2023 brought progress in several areas: 
‚Ä¢ We managed to further reduce our airfreight ratio to 0.3%, meaning that only 0.3% of all PUMA goods (by 
unit) are transported by air. This is a significant reduction compared to 2019 (before the COVID-19 
pandemic) where the value was close to 3%. 
‚Ä¢ Together with our main logistics service provider Maersk, we've integrated biofuels into our marine 
shipments as part of Maersk‚Äôs eco-friendly shipping initiative. Since February 2023, the utilisation of 
biofuels for transporting goods from our manufacturing sites to the European market has resulted in an 
impressive 84.6% reduction in GHG emissions along these routes. 
‚Ä¢ Our logistics team in the USA was able to expand the use of electric trucks from one to three trucks for 
the transport of PUMA goods between the port in Los Angeles and the warehouse in Torrance. We 
anticipate that more electric trucks will follow in other countries over the next years.

PUMA follows the precautionary principle and takes measures to prevent harm to human health and the 
environment from its products and operations. 
All the materials used in PUMA products are subject to our Restricted Substance List (RSL) Testing 
Programme to ensure compliance with global chemical regulations. Rather than applying internal testing 
standards for our tests, we rely on the AFIRM Group‚Äôs Product RSL and on the Manufacturing RSL 
developed by the Zero Discharge of Hazardous Chemicals Foundation (ZDHC). 
In 2021, we updated our target to RSL compliance rate above 90% considering the potential use of new 
chemicals in the new material development and innovation. No material with a failed RSL test can be used 
for PUMA products until the failure has been corrected and the material has successfully passed the test. In 
this way, we mitigate the risk of product-level RSL failures. We will still track our RSL failure rates to 
identify improvement opportunities and to prevent such failures from occurring in future.  
At the manufacturing level, as part of our Zero Discharge of Hazardous Chemicals commitment, we 
continued to ban the intentional use of priority chemical groups classified as particularly hazardous under 
ZDHC standards. This phase-out was supported by the widespread use of bluesign¬Æ and OEKO-TEX¬Æ-
certified materials. There was no intentional use of the priority chemical groups. Poly- and per-fluorinated 
chemicals (PFCs) were used until 2017 for water-repellent finishes on apparel and footwear products. In 
2021 we started using Gore-Tex bluesign¬Æ-certified membranes and finishes again, which are either 
completely PFC-free or free from PFCs of environmental concern. In February 2017, Gore announced the 
‚ÄúGoal and Roadmap for Eliminating PFCs of Environmental Concern (PFCEC)‚Äù from the lifecycle of its 
consumer fabric products following discussions with Greenpeace. Gore Fabrics Division is still fully 
committed to the PFCEC-free goals for its consumer products and is now on track to transition most of its

Our phase-out of hazardous substances is also reflected in the results of wastewater tests performed by 
our wet-processing suppliers. The tests show compliance levels of 98% among the 20 MRSL parameters 
listed in the ZDHC MRSL. Most parameters show compliance rates of 100% or close to 100%. Some MRSL

chemicals were still found in certain samples because we share production lines with other brands and 
retailers. Please see our Water and Air section for further details. 
A total of 283 ZDHC Gateway accounts are connected with PUMA: 45 are core Tier 1 and 64 core Tier 2 
factories and the remaining are non-core factories. These factories are part of different ZDHC programmes, 
depending on what applies to them: InCheck reports for MRSL conformance, ClearStream reports for 
wastewater conformance, and the Supplier To Zero programme for chemical management. 
 
 
CHEMICAL RISK ASSESSMENT AND NEXT STEPS  
In 2021, we conducted a risk assessment using our risk assessment methodology. We used the Higg FEM 
chemical management 2020 for our core suppliers and engaged with AFIRM and ZDHC foundation to review 
our risk assessment.  
We see a high level of risk in upcoming regulatory requirements. We will keep our engagement with AFIRM 
and FESI as a platform to engage with policymakers in different regions and countries such as EU and the 
USA, so that standards are achievable by the industry.  
PUMA has a long-lasting programme to ensure compliance with industry standards. 
We will keep using the China IPE database to screen any environmental violations by factories located in 
China producing PUMA products or materials. We will keep monitoring compliance with ZDHC Wastewater 
Guidelines, ZDHC MRSL and AFIRM RSL.  
We organised MRSL conformance training for PUMA Tier 1 and Tier 2 suppliers and also invited chemicals 
suppliers to engage on MRSL conformance engagement. In 2023 we initiated in-check report verification by 
an authorised third party to ensure the credibility and reliability of MRSL conformance data.  
The details of compliance with ZDHC Wastewater Guidelines, ZDHC MRSL, and Higg FEM chemical 
management are described in this report.   
 
2022 PUMA BRANDS TO ZERO ‚Äì PROGRESSIVE LEVEL 
We reached the Progressive Level for the Brands to Zero Assessment 2023. Brands 
to Zero is ZDHC‚Äôs leader programme for contributor brands. ZDHC developed the 
questionnaire and scoring methodology to assess the brands.  
All participating contributors in the leader programmes are graded into three performance levels 
Foundational, Progressive, and Aspirational. Our rating dropped from aspirational level in 2022 to 
progressive level in 2023, due to changes in the rating criteria. Higher weightage is allocated to business 
decisions linked to chemical management performance. Though at PUMA, we have a procedure in place to 
link business decisions with factories‚Äô chemical performance, we have not had such a case. We launched a 
factory scorecard that includes chemical performance in 2021, so far factories have improved their 
performance year after year. 
In the 2023 Brands to Zero Assessment, we achieved a 100% score for five out of ten performance areas 
such as Commitment, Internal Enablement, Supply Chain Engagement, ZDHC Gateway Chemical Module, 
and ZDHC Wastewater Guidelines, as a result of our strong commitment to enhancing sustainable chemical 
management in our supply chain.

FEM CHEMICAL MODULE 
PUMA has moved from individual brand chemical and environmental audits to using industry-wide tools, 
such as the Higg Index Facility Environmental Module (FEM) 3.0. PUMA requires an annual external 
verification of the self-assessment FEM modules (verification visits are announced). This external 
verification may be completed by approved verifiers from PUMA‚Äôs internal team, other brands, or third-party 
organisations on the approved list from SAC. The FEM Chemical Management Section measures factory 
performance from inventory and purchasing through production, storage, and waste. PUMA‚Äôs Chemical 
Performance Rating System is based on the ratings developed from the factories‚Äô verified Higg FEM scores 
under the chemical management section as verified by SAC-approved verifiers: A, B+, B-, C and D. The 
minimum passing grade from a Chemicals perspective is 40% (i.e., only A, B+ and B- ratings are a passing 
score) and C and D are failure ratings. This rating system was presented during meetings of suppliers and 
sourcing teams in 2021 and was implemented gradually during 2022 and 2023. Our Chemicals handbook has 
been updated accordingly. The rating system was included in vendor supplier scorecards along with social 
and environmental ratings. 
The table shows the aggregated verified FEM 2022 chemical module scores (median) for PUMA core 
factories with industry benchmarking. Compared to the industry, the overall verified FEM score for our 
factories is higher than the industry median score.

In 2023, PUMA continued to use the Higg Facility Environmental Module (FEM), an industry tool, to measure 
chemical management performance through the Higg FEM Chemical Management Module, which tracks 
purchasing and inventory management, production, storage, and waste locations. This tool is also used to 
measure Chemical Management performance for stichd core factories.  
 
In 2022, we communicated our expectation to the PUMA core factories that they improve their verified FEM 
Chemical Management score to 46% in 2023. We exceeded this goal with a FEM Chemical Management 
score for PUMA of 51%. The combined average of PUMA and stichd‚Äôs chemical module score also exceeded

During 2023, we continued to engage with our PUMA core Tier 1 and Tier 2 factories in capacity-building 
activities and projects in chemical management, for factories with a low Higg FEM Chemical Module score. 
We worked together with industry expert groups like ZDHC, AFIRM as well and ZDHC-approved laboratories 
to organise training webinars and develop training videos in local languages.  
 
PUMA also continued to join the Chemical Management Improvement (CMI) Programme of GIZ to improve 
the factories‚Äô performance. We collaborated with other brands to nominate participating factories in 
Vietnam for a tutor-assisted and onsite consultancy programme. For other countries, the factories were 
invited to join online training on chemical management developed by GIZ.   
 
The improvement in the MRSL conformance rate also contributed to an increase in Higg FEM Chemical 
Management score. 
 
In 2024, we will continue to engage with our core Tier 1 and Tier 2 factories in capacity-building activities and 
projects in chemical management. We will organise customised training sessions by SAC-authorised 
trainers. The training sessions will focus on Higg FEM 4.0, such as key updates and their relevant impact on 
their facility for a smooth transition to the new version. 
 
SUPPLIER TRAINING 
A series of training sessions were conducted in 2023, covering chemical management in input, process and 
output phases, in collaboration with ZDHC, accredited third-party laboratories and external consultants. 
ZDHC SUPPLIER TO ZERO ASSESSMENT 
In 2023, our factories participated in the ZDHC Supplier To Zero programme, a ZDHC Chemical Management 
System (CMS) Framework that contains a chemical management checklist to help factories identify 
opportunities to improve their chemical performance. 77 core Tier 1 and core Tier 2 factories completed the 
ZDHC Supplier To Zero assessment. Almost all of them completed their assessment at the end of 2023 and 
we will monitor their improvement in 2024. As a result of this programme, the average Higg FEM Chemical 
Management score of the 58 factories which participated in this programme in 2022, improved from 36% in 
2022 to 55% in 2023.  
 
CHEMICAL MANAGEMENT IMPROVEMENT (CMI) 
Chemical Management Improvement (CMI) training course is an initiative by GIZ. The purpose is to 
develop the knowledge and capacity of the team in charge of chemicals at factories. In 2023, 40 
participants from 23 core factories completed and passed the course. 
 
In Vietnam, the training aims to develop a sound knowledge of the responsible management of chemicals, 
improving capacities for the corporate environment, safety and health, and resource management in 
relevant industries. Four core factories in Vietnam joined this programme and received onsite consulting 
from Chemical Management Advisors (CMA) assigned by GIZ, such as Leadership and Sustainability 
consultancy company. After the consulting, the factories were requested to submit an Action Plan to 
improve chemical management, CMA will review this and provide recommendations. 24 participants from 
these four factories joined and completed this programme in 2023. 100% of participating factories worked on 
improvement plans after these training sessions.

In 2023, Chemical Management training sessions covered MRSL conformance and factory chemical 
management. Ten training sessions were conducted in four different languages. More than 200 factories 
and nearly 450 participants were invited. More than 90% of participants were satisfied with the training. 
These training programmes helped our suppliers to improve their understanding of PUMA and industry 
requirements and to improve the effectiveness of their Chemical Management Systems. After the training, 
the core factories with low MRSL conformance rates developed an Action Plan to improve MRSL 
conformance. We received and reviewed Action Plans from 13 factories to facilitate their implementation. 
We also encouraged the suppliers‚Äô chemical management teams to attend training courses under ZDHC 
Academy as conducted by ZDHC-approved service providers. Examples of the training courses that PUMA 
suppliers attended include ZDHC Chemical Management System (CMS) and Technical Industry Guide (TIG) 
training.

MANUFACTURING RESTRICTED SUBSTANCE LIST (MRSL) 
Regarding MRSL conformance, we use ZDHC MRSL, an industry standard adopted by many brands/retailers 
at the supplier level. Out of 131 core factories, 25 factories do not use chemicals during the manufacturing 
process and therefore are out of the scope of MRSL. 
In 2023, 96 of our core factories used either BHive, CleanChain, or E3 tools to track MRSL compliance. 86% 
of Tier 1 factories and 94% of Tier 2 factories under the scope of our MRSL programme have an InCheck 
Report, issued by ZDHC-approved solution providers to track MRSL compliance. These are the chemical 
management platforms used to manage chemical inventory and generate Performance InCheck Reports, 
which provide a summary of the MRSL conformance of the factory‚Äôs chemical inventory.

chemical product labels, generate a full and accurate chemical inventory, and quickly identify which 
chemical products meet MRSL requirements used by many brands and retailers. Facilities can then see 
which chemicals they should keep using and which they should phase out. 
‚Üó CASE STUDIES 
Gold Emperor Group is a footwear manufacturer in China that developed an Action Plan to improve 
MRSL conformance in 2023. They analysed the MRSL conformance rate, based on the January to 
July 2023 InCheck reports to make a list of the top Non-conformance Chemicals. Then they engaged 
with the concerned chemical suppliers to request that they register in ZDHC Gateway platform and 
submit the evidence that their chemicals comply with ZDHC MRSL (at least level 1) on this platform. 
The factory improved its MRSL conformance rate from 31% in 2022 to 92% in 2023. This conformance 
rate is very high compared to PUMA's average MRSL conformance rate of 71%. 
Active Creation under DSC group is an insole factory in Vietnam that joined the Chemical 
Management Improvement (CMI) programme of GIZ to improve its Chemical Management 
performance. Under this programme, the factory completed training courses on chemical 
management systems through an online platform. As part of this programme, a Chemical 
Management Advisor visited the factory and prepared a Performance Improvement Plan. As a result, 
this factory has significantly improved its verified Higg FEM Chemical Management scores from 18% 
in 2022 to 60% in 2023.

Based on a baseline of 45% in 2021, we set a goal of 70% MRSL conformance in 2023 for all factories with an 
InCheck report. We exceeded the 2023 Goal with an average MRSL conformance rate of 71% for 96 factories 
with an InCheck report. 59 out of 96 core factories reached a conformance rate higher than 70% MRSL 
conformance by weight. 37 factories did not reach 70% MRSL conformance rate. 
In 2024, we will strive for all core factories to have an InCheck report. We will organise customised training 
sessions together with ZDHC and ZDHC-approved third-party laboratories, to improve MRSL conformance 
rate for the factories. 2024‚Äôs MRSL conformance goal is 80% for all factories with an InCheck report.  
In 2023, we worked with ZDHC-approved verifiers to conduct a verification of InCheck. The Verified InCheck  
is an on-site review to establish credibility and trust in the chemical inventory that was used by the supplier 
to generate their Performance InCheck Reports. The verification is done by a ZDHC-approved third-party or 
second-party (brand representative) verifier who conduct ‚Äúspot check‚Äù verification of specific parameters. 
To pass the verification ‚â• 80% of the spot check parameters need to be validated, then the factory gets a 
passed Verified InCheck checkmark on their ZDHC Gateway account. Out of 96 core factories with InCheck 
report, 79 went through the verification process. 75 obtained a passed verified InCheck report. The four 
factories with a failed InCheck verification (less than 80% validation rate) were required to conduct a Root 
Cause Analysis, create a Corrective Action Plan and re-verify after at least three months. We will follow up 
on the implementation of their action plan and will re-verify in 2024.  
Besides using a chemical inventory to control input chemistry, we also use wastewater tests conducted by 
accredited independent laboratories to ensure no harmful chemicals are released through the wastewater 
of our manufacturer‚Äôs facilities with wet processing. The results of these tests show a compliance rate of 
over 90% for each parameter, with most parameters scoring 99 or 100% compliance.  
More details on wastewater testing are provided in the Water and Air section of this report. 
 
VOLATILE ORGANIC COMPOUNDS 
With much collaborative effort, we continue to edge closer toward our 2025 target of limiting volatile organic 
compounds (VOC) emissions to 10 g per pair of footwear produced. Although we faced certain supply chain 
difficulties in 2023, including the increased bonding requirements for our fast-growing performance 
categories, we have again managed to reduce our VOC and for 2023 we are reporting 12.5 g per pair. Looking 
towards 2025, we remain confident of achieving our 2025 target, through the increased use of water-based 
adhesives, as well as further innovations within our adhesive suppliers.

WATER ROADMAP AND RISK ASSESSMENT  
In 2021 we developed a water roadmap and conducted a risk assessment using our risk assessment 
methodology. 
WATER ROAD MAP 
Below are some key focus areas for the coming years. The measures below are a continuation of the ones 
started in 2021. 
‚Ä¢ Raise awareness: As a part of Higg FEM training, we provided training to suppliers on how to improve 
their score in water and wastewater sections. The cleaner production programmes like Clean by Design 
(CbD), and PaCT provided support to suppliers to help them reduce water consumption in selected core 
factories. The targets on water consumption reduction and ZDHC wastewater compliance rate were 
communicated to the suppliers during supplier meetings. We also reviewed these KPIs in one-to-one 
meetings with our core suppliers.  
‚Ä¢ Knowledge of impact: We continued our Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) journey for our top selling 
products. In 2023 we conducted LCA of three types of sports jerseys made of virgin polyester, PET 
recycled polyester and RE:FIBRE polyester. We also completed an LCA to compare cotton fabric with a 
75/25 blend of virgin and recycled cotton. LCA results are reported under the Products section of this 
report. As a part of Higg FEM self-assessment the core suppliers and selected noncore suppliers have 
conducted water risk assessments by using either the WRI Aqueduct Tool or the WWF Water Risk 
Filter. In 2023, we conducted a waste governance mapping for our top three sourcing countries, 
summarised their water policy landscape and mapped key local stakeholders. We also conducted a 
water risk assessment for our wet processing core factories. 


PUMA Annual Report 2023 
‚Üó Sustainability

‚Ä¢ Internal action: Our Material and Development teams continued to launch products with a reduced 
water footprint. We created a Microsoft excel tool for internal decision making which compares the 
environmental impact of alternative materials. Our suppliers improved their efforts to recycle treated 
wastewater, process optimisation, implement rainwater collection etc. to reduce the water footprint in 
the supply chain. Some of the case studies are presented in this report.  
‚Ä¢ Collaboration and partnership: We continue to participate in industry-wide cleaner production projects, 
which include water efficiency measures.  
 
WATER RISK ASSESSMENT 
WATER RISK ASSESSMENT AT OUR OWN OPERATIONS 
In 2022 we added a water risk mapping for our PUMA sites (offices, stores and logistic centres) globally. 
Using the WWF Water Risk Filter, we identified 164 sites in areas of water scarcity. For the sites, we 
identified the water consumption and compared it to the water consumption of similar sites (offices, stores 
and warehouses separately assessed). We also published an environmental handbook for our entities with 
recommendations for water-saving measures. In 2023 we followed up with the identified sites and asked for 
planned or implemented actions on water savings. 
At our headquarters in Herzogenaurach, we collect rainwater on our property and use it in the office and the 
surrounding green area. This helps us reduce our freshwater consumption and water costs. 
Most of the other PUMA-operated sites globally are rented and both, rented as well as non-rented, none of 
the sites use water for industrial processes. Therefore, our ability to reduce water consumption at our sites 
is limited to using water-efficient kitchen equipment and sanitary facilities. 
WATER RISK ASSESSMENT IN THE SUPPLY CHAIN 
DETOX.Live is a public disclosure platform operated by ZDHC that provides an overview of suppliers and 
their input and output control performance, including facility wastewater performance according to ZDHC 
Wastewater Guidelines. Factory performance, after uploading the test data to ZDHC Gateway Wastewater 
Module, is shown in three different colour codes on the public DETOX.Live map: green ‚Äì facility meets the 
ZDHC requirements, red -  facility does not meet requirements, and orange - facility does not meet the 
requirements but a CAP (Corrective Action Plan) was submitted.  
We will use the DETOX.Live platform to check the wastewater performance of new factories that have not 
connected with PUMA on the ZDHC Gateway. We can know whether new factories have implemented ZDHC 
Wastewater Guidelines, and what their wastewater performance is like. 
PUMA has also adopted ELEVATE intelligence (EiQ), a comprehensive suite of supply chain analytics, to: 
‚Ä¢ Assess our supply chain risks by geography, commodity and issue. 
‚Ä¢ Complete a risk assessment for suppliers, factories and sites. 
‚Ä¢ Manage risks that are material for each supplier, factory or site. 
In 2023, we conducted a water risk assessment for 62 wet processing core Tier 1 and Tier 2 factories located 
in six sourcing countries: Vietnam, China, Bangladesh, Taiwan, Cambodia, Turkey and Indonesia. We used 
the WWF Risk Filter and WRI Aqueduct. With the WWF Risk Filter, we assessed basin risk covering water 
scarcity, water quality and regulatory risk. With WRI Aqueduct, we assessed physical risk quantity and 
quality, as regulatory and reputational risks.  
We identified which factories are located in high and very/extremely high-risk areas. Then we looked at their 
water KPIs, ZDHC wastewater standards conformance, MRSL compliance rate and their water consumption 
reduction initiatives to mitigate water risks. 


PUMA Annual Report 2023 
‚Üó Sustainability 
144 
Out of 62 wet processing factories, 50 have a high and extremely high-water risk level as per the WRI 
Aqueduct. Out of these 50 high and extremely high-water risk level factories, 26 have a FEM 2022 water 
module score higher than PUMA average, 31 factories have MRSL conformance rate higher than the PUMA 
goal, 35 factories comply with ZDHC wastewater compliance, 15 have water KPIs above PUMA average and 
13 factories have wastewater recycling practices. In the coming years, we plan to work with high and 
extremely high-risk factories that do not have adequate risk mitigation measures in place. These activities 
will include providing training and support in terms of improving MRSL conformance, corrective action

WATER GOVERNANCE 
In 2023, we conducted a water governance mapping for our top three sourcing countries, namely Vietnam, 
China and Bangladesh. We looked at the water policy landscape and identified key stakeholders. Challenges 
and opportunities in water and wastewater management were also identified for each of the regions. We 
found that water, wastewater policy and regulations are evolving with stringent requirements being 
introduced progressively. We also see that interesting water projects are being undertaken in these 
countries on water reduction and water recycling. 
Vietnam has a national strategy on water, regulations on water security, water protection and development. 
The five countries (Vietnam included) under the Mekong River Commission promote and coordinate the 
sustainable management and development of water, for the mutual benefit of these countries and their 
citizens‚Äô well-being through a 2030 strategy. In addition, Vietnam has a national 2030 Water Resource 
Strategy with a view to 2045. There are some fiscal incentives in place, such as tax reduction or exemption 
schemes for the effective use of water. There are resource efficiency programmes such as FABRIC 
programme by GIZ, HSBC water programme, Clean by design by Aii and WWF‚Äôs Greater Mekong Delta, 
Vietnam improvement programme by IFC, and Race to Top by IDH. There is a need for more public-private 
partnership projects to develop further competence for green business or to encourage green 
production. There is also a legislation gap related to groundwater withdrawal. 
China has an elaborate regulation on water and wastewater. In 2019, the country introduced the Developed 
National Water Conservation Plan. The fourteenth five-year plan released in 2022 focuses on national water 
security over the next 100 years, to target flood control and drought relief, utilisation of water resources, 
optimal allocation of water resources to prevent uneven water distribution and aquatic ecology protection.  
Water/resource efficiency improvement programmes launched in China include WWF‚Äôs water stewardship 
programme, GIZ‚Äôs FABRIC programme, and the Clean by Design programme by Apparel Impact Initiative. 
The Institute of Public & Environmental Affairs (IPE) publishes a Water Map, to visualise China‚Äôs ground 
water and drinking water source quality over the years.  
China is still having critical issues with the unbalanced distribution of water resources which leads to water 
stress in specific areas, especially the east of the country where industries are blooming, and the population 
is rapidly growing.  
Bangladesh's latest regulation on water was introduced in 2013 and introduces amendments and new 
regulations to promote water conservation in the country. Legal frameworks need to be consistent and 
integrated, and account for all major water impacts and risks within Bangladesh. Falling groundwater 
tables combined with the projected increased water abstraction rates are likely to threaten industrial 
production. The cost of developing alternative water sources is substantial and could hinder growth. The 
country is prone to flooding with a very high-risk rating by the WWF Risk Filter. Water Partnership for 
Cleaner Textile (PaCT) by IFC and Sweden Textile Water Initiative (STWI) by Stockholm International Water 
Institute are a few successful resource/water efficiency improvement programmes implemented in the 
country.

We mapped our core factories in these three countries to evaluate the risks and determine if mitigation 
measures through our water-related goals and the factories' own initiative address these risks. 
In coming years, we will engage with relevant stakeholders to promote water conservation and recycling in 
these key sourcing countries.     
LCA WATER DATA 
In 2023, we did an analysis of Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) studies conducted during 2021 to 2023 with a 
focus on water footprint*. The objective was to come up with an actionable framework for material selection 
that would reduce our water footprint. Six footwear products, five apparel products, one accessory 
product** and three types of cotton fabrics were analysed. The outcome is summarised below.  
Among the three product divisions, the water footprint of apparel products was the highest, followed by 
footwear and accessories.  
Apparel: We found out that the consumer use phase of apparel products has the highest impact on the total 
water footprint (44 to 81% of total lifecycle water footprint), which is due to consumers washing garments at 
home. Since the use phase impact is not under our control, we excluded it from our water footprint 
analysis. We observed that the fabric dyeing process at Tier 2 factories has a larger water footprint (8 to 29% 
of the total lifecycle water footprint excluding the use phase) as compared to other manufacturing 
processes such as spinning, knitting, garment manufacturing and packaging. It was found that the water 
footprint of cotton is larger than that of polyester material. This is mainly due to the water consumption 
during cotton cultivation. This also explains why recycled cotton has a smaller water footprint than virgin 
cotton. From a water impact perspective, recycled polyester appears to be the best option. The analysis 
indicates that selecting materials with less water impact such as recycled cotton and polyester and 
materials made of Better Cotton fibre helps to reduce our water footprint. Better Cotton helps farmers to 
use water in a way that is environmentally sustainable, economically beneficial and socially equitable. This 
water stewardship approach can improve crop yields, strengthen resilience to climate change, minimise 
negative impacts on water quality and enable fair water access for all users in a catchment area. The 
analysis also indicates that we should focus on improving the water efficiency of the dyeing mills. This could 
include the installation of low-water ratio dyeing machines, waterless dyeing machines and recycling of 
wastewater.  
Footwear: The Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) of footwear highlights the various environmental implications 
connected with various materials and phases of manufacture. Notably, Ethyl Vinyl Acetate (EVA) which is 
generally used as a midsole, appears to be a low water footprint substance, providing a better 
option. Polyurethane (PU), leather, and natural rubber, on the other hand, have larger water footprints. This 
calls for our innovation and material team to focus on having more recycled materials such as recycled 
polyester, recycled PU, recycled rubber and recycled EVA. We mainly source leather from tanneries which 
are LWG certified. In 2021 LWG released a new version of the LWG audit standard, bringing major changes to 
how they assess leather manufacturers, this will help to further reduce the water footprint of leather 
footwear products.  
 
 
 
* 
Water Footprint is expressed in terms of blue water consumption (BWC), which means freshwater consumption sourced 
from surface and ground water  
** Since there is only one accessory product for which the LCA was conducted so far, there was not enough data to compare 
among accessories materials and reach a conclusion. Hence, the analysis on accessory materials was excluded from the 
above description.

MRSL WASTEWATER TESTING  
Since 2015 we have increased the number of wastewater tests from 33 to 153 factories and in 2023 we 
received 276 Wastewater test reports. 97% of all factories with wet-processing facilities (157 factories have 
wet processes) have been covered by tests, and tests show that all these factories have at least a 90% 
compliance rate with the ZDHC Wastewater Guidelines (Foundational level). ZDHC has created a three-level 
approach to the limits for heavy metals and conventional parameters to promote continuous improvement. 
The limits get more stringent as they move from Foundational, Progressive to Aspirational levels. 
All 153 suppliers have a ZDHC ClearStream report. ClearStream report, an easy-to-read facility 
performance report of ZDHC wastewater conformance, is automatically generated on the ZDHC gateway 
platform. To obtain a ZDHC ClearStream report, the factories must conduct wastewater testing following the 
ZDHC Wastewater Guidelines at one of ZDHC Accepted Laboratories, and all test results must be uploaded 
to the ZDHC Gateway Platform by the laboratory. 
Out of 153 factories, 117 factories are fully compliant with all ZDHC Wastewater Guidelines requirements. 
Where a wastewater test failed, we helped factories to conduct a root cause analysis and create corrective 
actions for wastewater and sludge, using the industry standard template. In 2023, we followed up with those 
factories that failed to fully comply with the Wastewater Guidelines, and received ten corrective action plans. 
We will continue to follow up through 2024 to obtain corrective action plans and we will evaluate further 
measures that need to be taken. We will also follow up on their implementation through wastewater testing 
in 2024.  
In 2023 we partnered with an accredited third-party laboratory to organise training on chemical 
management and wastewater conformance, as well as root cause analysis and corrective actions for non-
conformance. Case studies of conventional parameter failures have been presented in the training. 
The overall compliance rate for each category is: 
‚Ä¢ Conventional wastewater parameters: 99% 
‚Ä¢ Heavy metals: 99% 
‚Ä¢ Restricted chemicals (MRSL): 98% 
The overall compliance rate for conventional parameters increased by 1% in 2023 as compared to 2022, the 
compliance rate for heavy metals was maintained at 99%, and the compliance rate for restricted chemicals 
has fallen by 1%. The reason for the lower compliance rate for restricted chemicals this year is that 50% of 
the factories do not comply with new substances listed in ZDHC Wastewater Guidelines Version 2.1, which is 
a new version that came into effect in 2023. 
The conventional wastewater parameters, apply only to suppliers which discharge their wastewater directly 
into natural water bodies. Test results show over 90% compliance with the ZDHC Wastewater Guidelines 
(Foundational level). For heavy metals and restricted substances, the test results also show over 90% 
compliance for each parameter with the ZDHC Wastewater Guidelines. This means we have achieved our 
wastewater quality target as a part of our 10FOR25 sustainability goals.

The training helped the factories‚Äô participants to understand the new ZDHC Wastewater Guidelines, along 
with implications and impacts on their facility of the key updates. It also clarified how to conduct a 
Wastewater Root Cause Analysis and take Corrective Actions in the event of a non-compliant test result.  
After the training, the factories which were not compliant with the ZDHC Wastewater Guidelines, were 
required to conduct a Wastewater Root Cause Analysis and provide Corrective Actions. We received ten 
Corrective Action Plans from ten factories. We will follow up on their implementation through wastewater 
testing in 2024.  
In addition, we encouraged suppliers‚Äô chemical management teams to attend in-depth training courses as 
part of the ZDHC Academy, which is conducted by ZDHC-approved service providers.  
 
WATER SAVING 
In 2023, we expanded the participation of our core Tier 1 and Tier 2 suppliers in cleaner production 
programmes to improve energy and water efficiency.  
Below are the annual savings from completed and ongoing projects between 2019 and the end of 2023: 
‚Ä¢ Greenhouse gas reduction: 90,182 tCO2e per year 
‚Ä¢ Renewable energy: 247 MWp of RE capacity (including offsite wind) added in 2021, 2022 and 2023 
‚Ä¢ Water saving: 2,401,002 m

Water reduction at two suppliers 
Tai Hing Zipper, introduced an innovative wastewater treatment and recycling plant for its dying 
system in 2022 with an investment of $ 800,000. This advanced biological treatment along with a 
water recycling plant, helps in conserving 90% of water for every kilogram of fabric. From its early 
stage of implementation to the present, water usage and wastewater output have been significantly 
optimised. Previously, consuming 100 m
3 of water per day in the dyeing workshop, the factory has 
progressively reduced its water consumption to an average of 10 m
3 per day for the same production 
volume. The factory has adopted an innovative technology called the A/O process for the treatment of 
wastewater generated from its dyeing operation. This allows for the recycling of the treated 
wastewater back into the dyeing process. The factory has also installed a chemical index monitor to 
facilitate the monitoring of the treated wastewater quality.  
 
SQUARE Fashions Limited (SFL), a vertically integrated readymade garments manufacturing 
company has placed significant emphasis on sustainability and environmental responsibility. To 
further enhance these goals, SFL implemented various measures in 2023 to reduce its impact on 
water. These include the installation of a water reclamation plant, rainwater harvesting systems, 
reuse of steam condensate water, process optimisation, reuse of machine cooling water and raising 
awareness amongst employees. These initiatives resulted in a reduction of 36.3% as compared to 
2022 in groundwater consumption. This accounts for an absolute annual saving of 1,128,755 m
3 and a 
financial savings of 10 million BDT ($ 97,785) in 2023.

Although we do not have any goal for absolute reduction in water consumption from our core suppliers, we 
continue to track their water consumption. In 2023, the absolute water consumption has decreased by 7.5% 
for Tier 1 suppliers, as compared to the baseline of 2020. This is achieved due to a decrease in production 
volume for apparel by 15% and an improvement in water usage efficiency per pair of footwear by 21.5% 
during the same period.  
For Tier 2 suppliers, absolute water consumption has increased by 7.7% compared to the baseline of 2020, 
despite a significant increase in production volume in all Tier 2 divisions (12% for textiles, 7.3% for leather, 
and 171% for PU). It is worth noting that water usage efficiency at textile production, the highest contributor 
to water usage, has improved by 4.9% (from 103 to 98.3 m
3/ton of fabric), due to the water-saving measures 
taken by the suppliers including the installation of water recycling plants by some suppliers towards end of 
2022. The increased usage of recycled materials such as recycled cotton and recycled polyester has also 
contributed to less water consumption.  
 
AIR EMISSION 
AIR EMISSION AT OUR OWN OPERATIONS  
In terms of air emissions, there are no significant air emissions to report from our own sites. We have 
outsourced all manufacturing to external manufacturing partners and at our largest sites globally we do not 
have any industrial processes which could create air emissions. The only exception is our own 
manufacturing site in Argentina, which is covered by our supply chain efforts listed below. 
For our largest site, our global headquarters, we use district heating and heat pumps for heating, resulting 
in zero direct air emissions from the building. This fact was confirmed during our ISO 14001 certification 
audit in 2022. 
AIR EMISSION IN OUR SUPPLY CHAIN  
Since the publication of the ZDHC Air Emission Guidelines was still not been finalised in 2023, we decided to 
internally monitor our core supply chain‚Äôs performance regarding air emissions. We designed a set of 
questionnaires to gather the relevant air emission compliance information for our 131 core factories (Tier 1 
and Tier 2), towards local regulations (samples are selected by the factories and tested towards the 
requirements provided by the local environmental authorities). 
The result shows that 100% of the core factories sampled were compliant with the local regulation for air 
emission in 2023.  
ZDHC AIR EMISSION GUIDELINES PILOT  
In 2023, ZDHC circulated a draft air emission guideline V1.0 to the Air Emissions Task Team for review. We 
tested the draft guideline in our supply chain through a pilot study. The objective was to evaluate suppliers' 
readiness to comply with ZDHC draft guidelines and to provide feedback for review by the Task Team.    
We partnered with a third-party laboratory, Eurofins MTS, to collect chemical samples and conduct tests 
from six factories in Vietnam and two factories in China, out of which four are footwear factories and four 
are apparel factories. The tests include the measurement of total VOCs (TVOCs) and calculate the Potential 
to Emit (PTE), using the methodology referenced in the draft guidelines. We will share this data with ZDHC 
to help establish the Foundational limit value for TVOCs in the guidelines. We also tested Hazardous Air 
Pollutants/Toxic Air Pollutants (HAP/TAP). Out of 833 collected chemical samples, we detected HAP/TAP in 
132 samples accounting for around 15.8% of total samples. Further breakdown indicates 13.2% of samples 
are from footwear factories and 2.6% are from apparel factories. However, these factories have a high MRSL 
conformance rate which is verified by a third party and they provide appropriate personal protective 
equipment to their workers. ZHDC has not yet specified any limits for these air pollutants in the draft 
guidelines.   


PUMA Annual Report 2023 
‚Üó Sustainability 
152 
We also collected air emission samples from three factories (one apparel Tier 2, one footwear Tier 1, one 
footwear Tier 2) to test the air pollutants. Tests included air pollutants from point sources i.e. combustion of 
fuels and fugitive emissions from the production processes as per the draft guideline. The draft guidelines 
do not yet specify any limits for World Health Organization (WHO) pollutants like Particulate Matter (PM), 
Nitrous Oxides (NOx) Sulphur Oxides (SOx), and Ozone and globally regulated air pollutants like Carbon 
Monoxide (CO) and Volatile Organic Compounds (VOCs); they will be incorporated into future updates to the 
guidelines. In the absence of ZDHC limits, these results were compared with local regulation limits 
wherever available, and the test results show 100% compliance.  
We will communicate the test results with the factories and work to identify the root causes of test results 
with high values. We will also discuss our results with ZDHC to find solutions on how to address high values, 
particularly for TVOCs in footwear factories. 
 
Note: Since we are following Greenhouse Gas protocol for Greenhouse gas estimation, the calculation of greenhouse gas was 
excluded from the scope of this pilot study.

Plastic shopping bags and single-use plastics aggravate the problem of plastic pollution significantly. By 
eliminating them from our stores and office environment, we have set a positive example for our consumers 
and colleagues and at the same time reduced our use of plastics by several hundred tons per year. 
In recent years we switched our shopping bags to FSC-certified paper bags.  
Our stores ordered 430 tons of consumer-facing polyethylene bags in 2019 and 400 tons in 2020. In 2021 our 
stores ordered 189 tons. Finally, in 2022 our stores ordered 99 tons of consumer-facing plastic bags. As of 
January 1st, 2023, we have replaced all polyethylene bags for consumer use with paper bags or durable 
multi-use bags for sale in our owned and operated PUMA stores. 
At the same time, we switched other plastic items in our retail stores, such as hangers and shoe fixtures, to 
recycled polymers or FSC-certified wood. We also started working on more environmentally friendly 
solutions for our B2B product packaging for apparel and accessories, which is also based on polyethylene 
bags. As a result of these efforts, we switched our transit packaging B2B plastic bags to 100% recycled 
content and also optimised the thickness to save on weight. Our labeling and packaging team is investing 
time and resources in exploring environmentally optimised packaging solutions. For example, we piloted 
transit bags made from paper in the USA. In 2023 we rolled out transit bags made from FSC-certified paper 
for selected products. 
According to our zero plastic target for primary product packaging, we also switched most B2C plastic 
primary packaging to paper. For the few remaining plastic items like hangtag strings, we worked on non-
plastic or recycled plastic alternatives. At our offices, we have challenged our catering partners and 
employees to avoid single-use plastics such as coffee cups, lids, stirring sticks, cutlery or straws. In 2021 
88% of our offices globally had already eliminated single-use plastic cups and cutlery. This figure increased 
slightly to 91% in 2022 and 92% in 2023. 
FSC certified packaging for apparel products  
On a product level we finished the pilot experiment of a compostable version of our most iconic sneaker, the 
PUMA SUEDE. The pilot included the use of a fully biodegradable outsole made from thermoplastic 
polyurethane (TPU). For more information on RE:SUEDE, please refer to the Circularity section of this

MICROFIBRES 
All types of fibres have a propensity to shed to some extent, and understanding the full impacts of their 
physical and toxicological presence is a growing area of research therefore we must not limit our focus to 
synthetic materials.  
Led by science, The Microfibre Consortium (TMC) seeks to understand both the drivers of fibre 
fragmentation and, through external sources of research, the impacts on human health and ecosystems, 
such that we can collectively take the right actions to mitigate negative impacts. PUMA joined The Microfibre 
Consortium (TMC) as one of the signatory members to understand and address the environmental concerns 
surrounding fibre fragments (microfibre) as generated from natural and synthetic clothing during 
manufacture and the consumer use phase in the industry.  
In 2023, we continued with microfibre shedding tests to measure microfibre release from our polyester 
products during washing. We conducted 12 tests on selected 100% polyester fabrics following the TMC test 
method to quantify fibre loss from fabrics that reflect that found in domestic laundering, during the initial 
washing cycle. Fibre release results are expressed as a percentage of mass. The tests results indicate that 
microfibre loss from PUMA's fabrics is lower than the average microfibre loss available on the Microfibre 
Data Portal. Specifically, PUMA's average 0.0579%, compared to the TMC database average of 0.0587%. For 
related definitions, please visit Static. 
We have received feedback from TMC regarding the shedding data, and we understand that analysing it is 
complex and ongoing. So far, there is not a clear trend showing which yarn or structure type sheds more 
among the signatories. TMC has requested more data entries, and we will continue to participate in and 
support this study as an industry. 
In October 2023, PUMA joined a field trip to King's College London with 40 other delegates. TMC teamed up 
with specialist test instrument manufacturer James Heal to hold the first public demonstration of the TMC 
Test Method for fibre fragmentation from fabric.   
PUMA remains committed to the TMC 2030 roadmap released in September 2021. PUMA has pledged to 
support this roadmap and its objectives, including increasing the understanding of fibre fragmentation 
through research, implementing mitigation strategies once they become available in the industry, and 
contributing to progress through active participation in task teams with a goal of global implementation.

‚Ä¢ Amount of waste sent to landfills 
‚Ä¢ Percentage of recycled polyester, cotton, leather, rubber and polyurethane 
We are aware that the linear business model currently applied in our industry is far from the ideal concept 
of a circular economy. The growing amount of textile waste sent to landfills is an emerging risk. Rethinking 
the way we produce and moving towards a more circular business model is one of the priorities of our 
Sustainability Strategy over the coming years. 
We begin our journey with product design. Building on our Circular Design training with Circular Economy, 
we rolled out an e-learning tool on circularity for all PUMA colleagues globally. Based on the PUMA identity 
and our material toolboxes we identified circular design approaches around the longevity and cyclability of 
our products. The e-learning covers our Circularity Policy, as well as our circular design guidelines. 
During 2023, our largest business units held circularity workshops in which the options for transitioning 
iconic PUMA products into more circular products were discussed. 
 
CIRCULARITY INNOVATION 
In 2021 we launched PUMA Circular Lab, our platform for speaking and learning about circularity together 
with our customers. The first project was the RE:SUEDE, an experiment for a biodegradable shoe, made 
with chrome-free Zeology Leather, hemp, cotton and a biodegradable TPE sole. It launched in 2022 with a 
first batch of 500 pairs. The shoes were worn for six months by participants and then sent back to PUMA. In 
December 2022 over 400 pairs of RE:SUEDEs were sent to an industrial composting facility in the 
Netherlands, where they were prepared for the composting trial that was completed in 2023. The 
composting results were made public so that anyone interested in compostable footwear can use our 
lessons learned. 
In apparel, we expanded our textile-to-textile recycling programme, which we renamed from RE:JERSEY to 
RE:FIBRE. The initiative enables the recycling of fabric waste, as well as worn or unsellable polyester items 
(for example unsellable polyester items due to expired licensing contracts) through an innovative chemical 
recycling process into new textile items. We continue to partner with several teams for this project: 
Manchester United, AC Milan, Olympique de Marseille and Borussia Dortmund as well as the Swiss Football 
Federation. We collect used polyester products at the clubs‚Äô fan shops and our own PUMA store in 
Herzogenaurach. These products are sorted, and ‚Äì where possible ‚Äì enter the recycling stream to make 
new polyester products.

RE:FIBRE activations with BVB, Manchester City and AC Milan  
During the Women‚Äôs Football World Cup in Australia, the Switzerland team played in jerseys made from 
fibre-to-fibre recycled polyester. For 2024 we plan a further and significant extension of the RE:FIBRE 
programme to cover the jerseys of all major football clubs and federations, scaling up the programme to 
over 1 million produced items.  
 
 
Swiss national women‚Äôs football RE:FIBRE jerseys  
In addition to our existing RE:FIBRE initiative on recycled polyester, we started looking into innovative 
processes of cotton recycling, such as using 100% (pre-consumer) recycled cotton in selected products and 
the opportunity to recycle cotton waste into viscose-like materials. 
 
 
RECYCLED MATERIALS USAGE 
We encourage all our suppliers to reuse and recycle the fabric waste they are creating for PUMA production, 
either through applications outside of our industry or ideally, by recycling offcuts into new polyester or 
cotton yarns. 
We have set circularity targets, for example, scaling up the use of recycled polyester and using recycled 
alternatives to leather, rubber and polyurethane (PU), the materials we use most frequently after cotton and 
polyester. Our material toolboxes include recycled material options for all these materials. In 2023, we also 


PUMA Annual Report 2023

started looking at the potential of using secondary raw materials from innovative footwear separation 
technologies. 
In 2023, we delivered a million pieces of our downtown collection, made with at least 20% recycled cotton. 
The percentage of recycled polyester increased for all product divisions from 14% in 2020 to almost 62% in 
2023. The percentage of recycled cotton for our apparel products increased from 0.6% in 2020 to 8.6% in 
2023, and for footwear, it increased from 0.5% to 1.6%.  
PRE AND POST-CONSUMER WASTE IN THE SUPPLY CHAIN 
Around 77% of pre-consumer waste was either reused or recycled by our core Tier 1 suppliers and around 
94% of waste was either reused or recycled by our core Tier 2 suppliers in 2023. Compared to 2022, we 
observed an increase of 20% in reused/recycled waste for core Tier 1 and an increase of around 4% for core 
Tier 2. This increase is mainly due to the adoption of better waste disposal practices by our suppliers to 
divert waste from landfills. For textile and fabric waste, 7.2% of waste was sent to incineration by core Tier 1 
factories while core Tier 2 factories sent only 1% of waste to incineration.

such as averaging the last 10/12 months or multiplying the estimated production by the average KPI (per production unit) 
from the 12 months of data spanning from November 2021 to October 2022. 
Except for Footwear production that still has fabric waste sent to landfills, 100% fabric waste from Apparel, 
Accessory, Textile, and Synthetic production was diverted from landfills. Compared to 2022, we observed an 
increase in reuse and recycle proportion and a decrease in incineration proportion while disposal in landfill 
percentage remains stable. This change was due to the adoption of better waste disposal practices and 
reflects a gradual shift towards a circular approach by our suppliers. 
In 2023, 95% of fabric waste resulting from PUMA production was diverted from landfill. This is evident as 
76% of total fabric waste was either reused or recycled and 19% was sent to incineration. Only 5% of  total 
fabric waste ended up in landfills. 
 
TAKE-BACK SCHEMES 
To demonstrate our responsibility as a producer and to secure options for more circular material flows in 
the future, we have set a target to join or offer take-back schemes in all our major markets by 2025.  
In 2023 we introduced a new take-back scheme in Switzerland, piloted take-back bins in selected stores in 
Argentina and China and expanded our existing take-back scheme in the USA into the category of apparel. 
These new expansions complement our existing take-back schemes in Australia, Hong Kong, the USA and 
the clubs taking part in the RE:FIBRE project. Our colleagues at PUMA North America continued to work 
with Soles for Souls and collected 4,348 kg of used shoes, an initiative where shoes can be donated for 
reuse in support of a charitable cause. Our colleagues in Australia were able to collect 3,900 kg of used 
products.

Since September 2019 PUMA customers in Hong Kong have been able to put their used sportswear to good 
use and support disadvantaged communities across the world, as we teamed up with the non-profit 
organisation, Crossroads Foundation. Hong Kong customers can donate used garments of all brands at 
PUMA recycling bins, which have been set up in four selected stores. During 2023, 1,442 kg of used products 
were collected. At our German headquarters we collected 385 kg of products through our take-back 
scheme, which means that in total we collected over 10 tons of products for recycling or donation with our 
take-back schemes globally for the first time. For 2024, we plan to expand our coverage of take-back 
schemes further, for example in India and Germany. 
 
SWAP SHOPS 
SWAP shops are a free and local exchange where people can pass on things they no longer want, in 
exchange for something they need. It helps people refresh their wardrobe without having to shop for 
something new. Products get a new chance to be worn again and it promotes sustainability in a fun way. In 
2023 the fourth PUMA SWAP Shop was held in Hong Kong to promote a ‚Äúrecycle and reuse‚Äù culture. It was a 
public event to swap clothes and accessories. More than 460 guests joined and more than 2,320 items were 
given away (more than four items per guest). 67 boxes of garments (1,013 kg) were donated to two NGOs: 
Crossroads and Redress. Another SWAP Shop took place for the second time at our Headquarters in 
Germany for our own employees. Over 400 items were swapped and the remaining ones were donated to 
our employees‚Äô charity organisation, Charity Cat. PUMA North America organised its first SWAP shop and 
had a very positive response from over 130 employees swapping more than 1,000 articles.

PRODUCT CARE GUIDELINES 
In 2023 we initiated the publication of care and repair guidelines for consumers to help keep their products 
in good condition for a longer time. We focus on the most common reasons why people end up throwing 
away their sportswear and offer easy tips to treat these problems. We promote natural ways to treat stains 
and odours as well as conscious washing and drying practices to reduce user-phase impact.  
 
UNSELLABLE PRODUCTS 
We are aware that due to contractual restrictions, a certain number of unsold products must be occasionally 
discarded, for example when a license contract with a partner club expires. We have a process in place to 
ensure that this happens to PUMA products only in exceptional circumstances. Our production forecasts are 
as accurate as possible to actively prevent high product inventories and their intrinsic management costs. 
Unsold seasonal products are placed through different channels until they are sold. Returned products that 
have not been worn are placed on sale again. Returned products with small defects but in good condition 
are donated and only returned products that are very worn or severely damaged need to be discarded. No 
new product should be destroyed without the explicit demand of an expiring licensing partner nor a new 
product shall be destroyed as a solution for inventory management. We have created a reporting structure 
to identify with accuracy the quantity and reasons for such cases. In 2023, the amount of disposed articles 
was equivalent to 0.25% of our total material consumption. These products were sent to a recycling facility 
(where available). In countries where such recycling facilities do not exist, the products were shredded.  
 
WASTE ROADMAP AND RISK ASSESSMENT  
In 2021 we developed a waste reduction roadmap and conducted a risk assessment. 
WASTE AT OUR OWN OPERATIONS 
At our own operations, the most significant fractions of waste are paper and cardboard (notably from outer 
carton boxes, shoe boxes and office paper usage), poly bags used for transport product packaging and 
household waste such as organic waste from our canteens. Since we do not operate any industrial 
manufacturing facilities (with one exception in Argentina), the amount of hazardous waste created in 
PUMA‚Äôs own operations is very low at 36 tons. The 36 tons originate from our factory in Argentina (26 tons) 
and the exchange of old lighting systems to LED at the PUMA headquarters (9 tons). All hazardous waste is 
handled strictly in line with hazardous waste regulations. 
During 2023, we reminded our PUMA subsidiaries to engage in waste separation and recycling.  
Consequently, we could increase the rate of recycled waste from 44% in 2019 to 64% in 2023. 
WASTE IN THE SUPPLY CHAIN 
For our supply chain, the waste data published in our report includes material waste, along with factory and 
office operational waste: cardboard, paper, plastic, light bulbs, etc. to ensure a comprehensive scope for the 
waste generated on production sites. We see plastics, chemicals, oil lubricant waste and e-waste as high 
risk. To prioritize our actions, we analysed waste data collected in 2020 and the Higg FEM waste 
management score of our core factories. 
Below are the key focus areas for the coming years. Some actions were taken in 2023 and are covered below. 
‚Ä¢ Raise awareness: As a part of Higg FEM training, we have provided training to 210 suppliers factories on 
how to improve their score in waste management. As a result of these trainings, the average Higg FEM 
score for the waste module increased from 45% in 2022 to 53% in 2023, which was higher than the 
industry median of 40% in 2023. The target for reducing the amount of production waste going to landfills 
was communicated to the suppliers during the supplier meetings. We also conducted one-to-one 
meetings with our core suppliers to review their waste KPIs. 


PUMA Annual Report 2023 
‚Üó Sustainability 
162 
‚Ä¢ Knowledge of impact: Some of our apparel suppliers have initiated the recycling of pre-consumer 
cutting waste back into the spinning process. In 2023, we completed a Life Cycle Assessment to compare 
virgin cotton fabric with 75/25 blend of virgin and recycled cotton from cotton waste. The details of this 
LCA study are provided in the Product section. In 2023, we mapped a waste governance for our top three 
sourcing countries, summarised their waste policy landscape and identified key stakeholders.  
‚Ä¢ Internal action: In last three years i.e., starting in 2021 we focused on better data collection on waste 
from supplier‚Äôs facilities, and we observed that factories have started reporting comprehensive data on 
waste.  
‚Ä¢ Collaboration and partnership: In 2022, we participated in a project named Closed Loop 2 Balance 
(CL2B) in Vietnam, for which the final report was published in 2023. The Global Fashion Agenda 
and Deutsche Gesellschaft f√ºr Internationale Zusammenarbeit (GIZ) launched The Circular 
Fashion Partnership: a cross-sectoral initiative to support the development of effective circular fashion 
systems in textile, garment and footwear manufacturing regions, by capturing and recycling post-
industrial fashion waste. This project is currently active in Bangladesh and Cambodia and is to 
be launched in Vietnam in 2024. We have had several internal discussions and communication with GFA 
and GIZ about this project in Vietnam. We will scale up our textile recycling innovation, RE:FIBRE, 
replacing recycled polyester with RE:FIBRE technology in all PUMA football Club and Federation replica 
jerseys from 2024 onwards. We also showed that we can successfully turn an experimental version of 
our classic SUEDE sneaker into compost under certain tailor-made industrial conditions, as we 
published the results of our two year-long RE:SUEDE experiment.  
 
WASTE GOVERNANCE 
In 2023, we conducted a waste governance mapping process for our top three sourcing countries, Vietnam, 
China and Bangladesh. We looked at the waste policy landscape and identified key stakeholders. Challenges 
and opportunities in waste management were also identified for each region. We found that the waste 
regulations are evolving with stringent requirements progressively. We also found that interesting projects 
are being undertaken in these countries on waste tracking, waste recycling/circularity etc.   
Vietnam - Waste regulation in Vietnam has been evolving since 2005, with stringent requirements being 
added progressively. Vietnam committed to address marine plastic waste, with a goal of eliminating plastic 
waste from both land and ocean-based sources by 2030. In addition, Vietnam has legal requirements for 
waste management, which includes the management of domestic solid waste, hazardous waste, and 
normal industrial solid waste. Specifically, enterprises are obliged to adopt resource- and energy-efficient 
solutions, use environmentally-friendly raw materials, fuels, and materials, apply cleaner production 
technologies and programmes, and implement measures to minimize waste generation (Environmental 
Protection Law, Chapter VI, Section 2, Article 72). 
Limited waste segregation at source, inadequate infrastructure for recycling, a lack of adequate data, 
access to financing, a lack of public awareness, and a lack of market for recyclables were identified as key 
challenges for waste management in Vietnam.  
The Global Fashion Agenda and Deutsche Gesellschaft f√ºr Internationale Zusammenarbeit (GIZ) have 
launched The Circular Fashion Partnership: a cross-sectoral initiative to support the development of 
effective circular fashion systems in textile, garment and footwear manufacturing regions, by capturing and 
recycling post-industrial fashion waste. This project will be launched in Vietnam in 2024. Through this 
project, we see opportunities to address the current challenges in collaboration with other brands, 
manufacturers, collectors, sorters and textile recyclers to segregate, digitally trace and recycle textile waste 
into the highest possible value output, ultimately being new products.

China introduced a regulation to promote the circular economy back in 2004. The country has a specific 
regulation to ban the import of waste, which involves penalties for violations such as the illegal dumping of 
waste. China also has a policy on textile waste recycling, which aims to achieve a 25% recycling rate for 
textiles waste by 2025 and 30% by 2030. It has also set specific targets to produce recycled fibres derived 
from 2 million tons of waste textiles by 2025 and 3 million tons by 2030. China provides fiscal incentives for 
suppliers under the Environmental Protection Tax Law in which tax on hazardous waste is determined 
based on the generation quantity and hence provides an opportunity for suppliers to save costs by adopting 
the 3R Principles (Reduce, Reuse Recycle). We see opportunities to engage with key local stakeholders to 
improve factories waste management. 
Bangladesh introduced specific regulation on the circular economy in 2022. The country has a goal to 
achieve recycling of plastic waste by 80% by 2030, cut single-use of plastic by 90% by 2026, reduce 
generation of plastic waste by 30% by 2030 and reduce virgin material consumption by 50% by 2030.  
PUMA suppliers' have developed cotton pre-consumer textile waste recycling. We increased the use of 
recycled cotton from 3.6% of total cotton volume in 2022 to 8.6% in 2023. 
The Circular Fashion Partnership has been active in Bangladesh since 2021. Key partners in this project are 
actively engaging with the Bangladeshi government to formalize the informal waste management sector. 
This includes introducing incentives and tax deductions to incentivize manufacturers to embrace recycling 
practices and establishing a comprehensive national policy for the sustainable management of post-
production fashion waste. Through this policy advocacy work, we see opportunities to further increase the 
use of recycled cotton in future. 
‚Üó CASE STUDY 
Zero waste to landfill  
Adhering to the three principles of "Reduction, Recycling, Detoxification", TST Group, is steadily 
moving towards the target of "Zero Landfill".‚ÄâTST has two facilities supplying to PUMA, one in China 
and the other one in Cambodia. TST has implemented processes for waste reduction such as energy 
recovery from sludge through Chip Mong INSEE Cement Corporation in Cambodia, using coal ash 
from boiler upcycling to produce bricks in Cambodia, reuse of fabric waste as mop and sending 
chemical drums back to chemical suppliers for refilling in both the China and Cambodia facilities. 
Through these initiatives along with strict classification and storage of waste, as well as cooperation 
with qualified third-party waste treatment companies, TST Group has achieved a 99% waste diversion 
rate of a total amount of 7,398 tons production waste generated annually from landfill.

The values for November and December 2023 were estimated by employing the Exponential Smoothing (ETS) algorithm in 
Microsoft Excel, utilizing data from January to October of 2023. This approach was chosen after comparing it to alternative 
methods, considering its performance against actual historical data, specifically in terms of deviation from the actual values 
in percentage terms. The ETS method displayed both higher accuracy and higher precision compared to other methods, 
such as averaging the last 10/12 months or multiplying the estimated production by the average KPI (per production unit) 
from the 12 months of data spanning from November 2021 to October 2022. 
 
Similar to water, even though we do not have any goal for absolute reduction in waste generation for our 
core suppliers, we continue to track them. It is also observed that only 0.5% of waste (material waste but 
also other factory wastes like boiler ash, sludge from wastewater treatment plants etc.) end up in landfills 
for apparel suppliers and 6.8% for footwear suppliers.  
We can see that there has been a 7% decrease in production waste for Tier 1 suppliers and 180% increase 
for Tier 2 suppliers from 2020. The high percentage increase in Tier 2 suppliers is mainly due to the 
improvement in waste data captured by the suppliers. Certain wastes such as residual ash from coal and 
biomass boilers that were not captured by the Tier 2 suppliers before are now being included. At the same 
time, the production volume has increased by 12% for textiles and 171% for synthetic leather. 76.3% of the 
production waste are reused or recycled, 18.8% are incinerated and 4.8% are sent to landfill. 
Regarding production waste sent to landfill, both core Tier 1 and Tier 2 suppliers have succeeded in reducing 
their landfill percentage compared to 2020 baseline. In 2023, Tier 1 and Tier 2 suppliers have achieved a 
reduction of 51% and 73% reduction respectively from the baseline and thus exceeded the PUMA goal of 50% 
reduction by 2025. This was achieved due to better waste management practices adopted by the suppliers 
and more accurate tracking and reporting of waste data.

The PUMA Environmental Profit and Loss Account (EP&L) attributes more than 50% of our environmental 
impact to material and raw material production. Against this background, we have decided to prioritize the 
large-scale use of certified or recycled raw materials. In our 10FOR25 strategy, we have set 100% targets for 
the raw materials of cotton, polyester, leather, and cardboard. 
In addition to measuring the use of recycled or certified materials, we also determine the percentage of all 
products made of such materials. As defined in our PUMA Sustainability Index, or S-Index, S-Index-
approved apparel or accessories products contain at least 50% certified or recycled materials by weight. For 
footwear, we currently measure S-Index conformance by including one or more main components* made 
from certified or recycled materials. 
In 2021 we rolled out an e-learning toolkit on our PUMA S-Index for the PUMA family. The training allows 
designers, developers, and product managers to understand which materials qualify as more sustainable, 
how the PUMA S-Index is calculated, and which certifications need to be in place to externally communicate 
on a product level.  
In 2023, 85% of our product by volume met our S-Index definition. We are on track to meet our goals of 90% 
for 2025.

PRODUCT LIFE CYCLE ASSESSMENT 
We continued the Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) studies of our product portfolios in 2023. The outcomes of an 
LCA act as a quantifiable measure of our efforts towards embedding sustainability in our products by 
exploring ways to make our product value chains safer, cleaner and more sustainable. It also encourages 
innovation in our products and processes so that we can meet increasing social and business expectations 
regarding sustainability and transparency. Sphera, a leading consulting organisation in the field of LCA, 
conducted LCA studies to consider all of the elements of the life cycle, from the overall manufacturing 
including supply of material and energy carriers through to the end of life, when analysing the 
environmental performance of the products. The LCAs were performed as per ISO 14040 and ISO 14044 
requirements. A third-party critical review panel was commissioned to peer review the work and ensure 
compliance with the mentioned standards. 
LCA OF TWO PRODUCTS 
We completed a screening LCA study for two of our top products, the PUMA POPCAT 20 sandals, and the 
PUMA Smash v2L shoes, to map the environmental footprint of these products across their entire value 
chains (cradle to grave), excluding the consumer use phase. This helped us to understand the hotspots in 
the value chain (the maximum impacts in terms of climate, energy and water), and to identify sustainable 
options in various phases to improve the product‚Äôs environmental footprint.

For the POPCAT20 sandals, the global warming potential (GWP) in kg CO2e was mainly influenced by raw 
materials which include polyester fabric, chemicals etc. (49.07%), manufacturing energy (40.37%) and End of 
Life (9.94%). Ethylene Vinyl Acetate (EVA) and PU Synthetic are the major contributing materials. 
For the SMASHv2L shoes, the global warming potential (GWP in kg CO2e) was mainly influenced by materials 
which include body material, parts and components (69.61%), manufacturing energy (21.38%), and end-of-
life (8.78%). Polyester fabric and rubber are the major contributing materials. 
Footwear usually does not require extensive cleaning during its lifetime, and hence the impact of the 
consumer use phase is negligible. Therefore, the GHG emissions of the use phase from both of the footwear 
is not considered. However, the end-of-life phase includes reuse, recycling, incineration, and landfilling 
based on European scenarios, which contributes to GWP impacts of 9.94% for the POPCAT20 sandals and 
8.78% for the SMASHv2L shoes.

For the POPCAT20 sandals, the total global warming potential is 1.61 kg CO2e. The total primary energy 
demand is 32.36 MJ with major contributions from ethylene vinyl acetate (EVA) (60.60%) and PU Synthetic 
(11.48%). The total blue water consumption is 31.02 kg with major contributions from the raw material PU 
Synthetic blend (51.85%) which contains 52% recycled polyester and 48% polyurethane. The remaining 
contribution comes from other materials, chemicals, electricity and fuel consumption.  
For the SMASHv2L shoes, the total global warming potential is 4.61 kg CO2e. The total primary energy 
demand is 90.38 MJ with major contributions from the polyester fabric (30.04%) and rubber (22.04%). The 
total blue water consumption is 41.33 kg with major contributions from PU-coated leather (33.41%). 
POPCAT 20 sandals have a significantly smaller (65%) carbon footprint than SMASH v2L shoes. One reason 
for this is the lower net weight of POPCAT 20, which is 60% lower. Looking at the carbon footprint of 
materials, in the case of POPCAT 20, 64.5% of climate impact comes from the Ethylene Vinyl Acetate (EVA) 
while for Smash V2L, the majority of the impact comes from polyester and rubber, which accounts for 65.4% 
of the carbon footprint of the raw material of the product. This indicates that low-carbon material such as 
EVA has also contributed to the lower carbon footprint of POPCAT 20. Looking at energy consumption during

production, POPCAT 20 consumed 52% less electricity than SMASH v2L. This can be attributed to the lower 
net weight and the simplicity of the POPCAT 20 product design.  
Though the SMASH v2L has a larger carbon footprint than the POPCAT 20, it is much smaller (4.61 kg CO2e) 
when compared to previously conducted LCAs of footwear products in 2021 i.e. the Future Rider Play on  
(9.49 kg CO2e) and Velocity Nitro (7.6 kg CO2e). Both the Future Rider Play on and Velocity Nitro have a lower 
net weight of 0.78 kg and 0.72 kg as compared to the SMASH v2L which has a net weight of 0.955 kg/pair. The 
SMASH v2L is made of recycled materials such as recycled polyester, recycled PU, and recycled rubber 
along with recycled packaging materials and the quantity of leather used is much lower, which explains the 
lower carbon footprint when compared to the Rider Play on and Velocity Nitro.  
The key takeaways from the LCA study are, to make future footwear products lighter, increase the usage of 
low-impact materials such as recycled polyester or recycled PU and reduce the use of high-impact 
materials such as virgin PU and virgin polyester. The supply chain for footwear products is complex and 
involves multiple stages such as raw material extraction, processing, finishing, assembly, distribution and 
end of life. The LCA study is used to understand the value chain environmental impacts of our products. 
PUMA intends to use the outcomes of the study to raise internal awareness and improve the product‚Äôs 
environmental footprint by increasing the use of more sustainable materials (recycled or biosynthetic), 
improving resource efficiency, optimizing energy use, promoting renewable energy in the value chain, and 
enhancing the circularity of our products. 
COMPARATIVE LCA VIRGIN POLYESTER VS. PET RECYCLED POLYESTER VS. RE:FIBRE POLYESTER 
PRODUCTS 
In 2023, PUMA engaged Sphera, Inc. to conduct a comparative Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) of three types of 
sports jerseys made from virgin polyester, PET recycled polyester and RE:FIBRE, in our Turkey supply chain. 
The RE:FIBRE process uses mainly polyester material from factory offcuts, faulty goods and 
used clothes. PET recycled polyester comes from PET plastic bottles. 
The LCAs were performed using the ‚Äúcradle to grave‚Äù approach. The objective was to quantify the 
environmental impacts associated with the production of these three types of jerseys using the LCA 
approach. The products studied were:  
 
The scope of this study includes raw material sourcing and extraction, transportation of raw materials to 
the manufacturing location, manufacturing of the jersey products, product distribution, product use phase 
and end of life (EoL) of product and packaging.

The LCA study indicates that per kg, the PET recycled polyester jersey has the smallest carbon footprint 
(13.19% lower as compared to virgin polyester jersey) among the three products compared in the study. 
Whereas, per kg, the RE:FIBRE polyester jersey has a 7.31% lower Global Warming Potential (GWP) impact 
when compared to the virgin polyester jersey. The RE:FIBRE polyester jersey has 57% chemically recycled 
fibre which has a higher GWP impact as compared to mechanically recycled fibre but a lower one than virgin 
recycled fibre.  
The total primary energy demand also exhibits a similar trend, due to same factor as the carbon 
footprint. The PET recycled polyester jersey and RE:FIBRE Polyester Jersey are 16.15% and 12.13% lower 
respectively per kg than the virgin polyester jersey.  
The LCA study also indicates that, the water consumption per kg of PET recycled polyester jersey and 
RE:FIBRE polyester jersey is 1.10% and 2.82% higher than per kg value of the virgin polyester jersey.  
Although textile-to-textile technology currently has a larger environmental footprint than mechanical 
recycling, through the RE:FIBRE programme, PUMA is keen to address the challenge of textile waste via a 
long-term solution for recycling. The technology also looks to diversify the fashion industry‚Äôs main source of 
recycled polyester in garments to make it less reliant on clear plastic bottles. We also believe that this 
technology has room to become more energy efficient in future. 
Managing waste has become a necessity, which is why PUMA is ramping up its investment into resource-
efficient manufacturing processes in a move to reduce textile waste. Textile waste build-up in landfills is an 
environmental risk. Rethinking the way we produce and moving towards a more circular business model is 
one of the main priorities of our Sustainability Strategy. 
To help make the technical process of RE:FIBRE more digestible for the everyday consumer who wants to 
know more, PUMA has created a RE:FIBRE process explainer video, which can be accessed here. 
The four-step process of RE:FIBRE: 
‚Ä¢ Collect and Sort: collecting and sorting textile waste and other previously wasteful materials. 
‚Ä¢ Shred and Mix: shredding and mixing the collected materials 
‚Ä¢ Dissolve, Filter and Polymerize: Dissolving the shredded polyester and removing dyes through a 
chemical recycling process. 
‚Ä¢ Melt, Spin, Knit and Sew: The melting makes the newly produced polymers ready to be spun and sewn 
into shape to create good as new RE:FIBRE fabric which can be recycled again and again.

COMPARATIVE LCA OF 3 TYPES OF COTTON FABRIC 
PUMA engaged Sphera to conduct a comparative Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) of one kilogramm of 100% 
virgin piece dyed cotton fabric, 75/25 virgin/undyed recycled piece dyed cotton fabric and 75/25 
virgin/coloured recycled piece dyed cotton fabric.  
Piece dyed fabric is fabric made of grey yarns which are dyed, and is different to yarn dyed fabric: a fabric 
that is knitted using dyed yarn.  
LCAs are performed using the ‚Äúcradle to gate‚Äù approach. Since this is the ‚Äúcradle to gate‚Äù approach, 
consumer use phase and fabric end-of-life impacts for the cotton fibre products were not considered in this 
LCA study.  
The main objective of the study is to quantify the environmental impacts associated with the production of 
these fabrics across various life cycle stages of the manufacturing process, including the supply of raw 
materials and energy carriers. The primary data considered for the study was collected from three PUMA 
suppliers stretched across two regions, Bangladesh (two factories) and Turkey (one factory). The data 
collected includes data for all the production processes such as collection and pre-processing, yarn 
spinning, knitting and inspection, pre-treatment, dyeing, compacting and drying. 
The LCA study indicates that for one kg of 75/25 virgin/undyed recycled piece dyed cotton fabric, the carbon 
footprint is 5.83% smaller compared to the 100% virgin piece dyed cotton fabric. This change was mainly 
influenced by the inclusion of 25% undyed recycled cotton material. For 1 kg of 75/25 virgin/coloured 
recycled piece dyed cotton fabric, the carbon footprint was smaller by 13% when compared to the 100% 
virgin piece dyed cotton fabric. This change was mainly influenced by the inclusion of 25% coloured recycled 
piece dyed cotton fabric. When comparing these three fabrics, the environmental impacts of 75/25 
virgin/coloured recycled piece dyed cotton fabric were found to be the lowest. This is due to the usage of 
25% recycled yarn which is recovered from a coloured fabric and hence requires fewer chemicals and less 
energy during the dyeing process.

Additionally, it was found that the most significant carbon footprint impact is related to the conventional 
dyeing of fabric followed by the impacts of cotton cultivation and yarn spinning. Primary energy demand is 
largely driven by the cultivation of cotton, followed by conventional dyeing of fabric. Water consumption is 
largely driven by cotton cultivation followed by conventional dyeing, compacting and drying processes.  
In the study, we also evaluated the environmental impacts of different types of dyeing technologies such as 
conventional and Pad-Steam dyeing processes for the three types of fabrics. The Pad-Steam process is a 
textile finishing technique used to apply chemicals or dyes to fabric. It is a combination of two steps: 
padding and steaming. This process is employed to achieve uniform coloration, improved fabric properties, 
and enhanced performance characteristics. This study was conducted at a factory located in Turkey that 
uses both technologies. Conventional dyeing for knitted products is typically a batch process in which the 
fabric is loaded along with water, chemical and dyestuffs and processed for a fixed number of hours based 
on the type of fabric. Whereas, Pad-Steam dyeing is a continuous dyeing process, in which the fabric is dyed 
by immersing the fabric in the dye solution for a few seconds, immediately pressed through a roller and 
then steamed. Pad-Steam dyeing is more resource-efficient as compared to conventional dyeing. This was 
further corroborated by our LCA study. Pad-Steam dyeing was found to have a smaller environmental 
footprint than conventional dyeing. It was observed that the Pad-Steam dyeing process has 81.9% less 
energy and 80.5% less water consumption as compared to the conventional dyeing process.  
It was found that Pad-Steam dyeing for 100% virgin piece dyed cotton fabric has a 34.8% smaller carbon 
footprint as compared to conventional dyeing. The corresponding figure for 75/25 virgin/undyed recycled 
piece dyed cotton fabric was 36.9% and 25.02% for 75/25 virgin/coloured recycled piece dyed cotton fabric. 
Similar trends were also observed for primary energy demand and water consumption.  
The LCA study clearly indicates that the inclusion of recycled cotton fabrics has a smaller environmental 
footprint and hence is to be promoted for future product development. However, there are currently 
technological limitations surrounding increasing recycled cotton to more than 25% in a cotton fabric mix. 
This calls for a focus on future innovation in this area. Furthermore, our suppliers could adopt better dyeing 
technologies such as the Pad-Steam dyeing process which has a smaller environmental footprint.

MATERIAL ORIGIN 
Mapping and assessing risk and impact practices in the lower tiers of the supply chain helps us to identify 
opportunities for improvement.  
 
COTTON 
In 2023, we sourced approximately 34,000 tons of cotton. To reach our 100% targets for certified or recycled 
cotton, we require our suppliers to only source cotton from farms that are licensed or certified as having 
good farming and human rights standards, or recycled cotton. 96% of the cotton used in PUMA products 
comes from the USA, Brazil, Australia, India, Bangladesh, Vietnam, Indonesia and Turkey.  
LEATHER 
In 2023, we sourced approximately 3,500 tons of bovine leather. We are working on improving the traceability 
of the leather we use by recording the traceability score of our leather manufacturers certified by the 
Leather Working Group. The leather used in PUMA footwear mainly comes from the USA (61%), Argentina 
(27%), Australia (6%) and Brazil (5%). We also monitor our LWG (Leather Working Group) medal-rated 
tanneries' traceability performance. Most suede tanneries work with agents and intermediaries besides 
direct tanneries to guarantee a stable sourcing supply. Suede is a byproduct of the full-grain leather 
business. This creates a challenge to full traceability. This explains why our suede leather LWG tanneries 
have a worse traceability performance than full-grain LWG tanneries. We aim to increase all of our LWG 
medal-rated tanneries‚Äô traceability performance over time.

Therefore, more than 87% of our apparel, 40% of our accessories and 93% of our footwear products are 
already classified in line with the definition in our PUMA Sustainability Index.  
Coverage and calculations are more complex for footwear because all of our shoes are made from several 
components. The main materials we use are polyester, polyurethane, rubber, leather and nylon. In line with 
our earlier targets, we have achieved 99.7% coverage of leather sourced from LWG-certified tanneries.  
In 2023, 99.2% of the cotton used came from certified or recycled sources, as did 85% of our polyester.  
We hardly used wool in 2023 (6,566 kg). Nevertheless, we see an increased number of factories certified in 
line with the Responsible Wool Standard (RWS). We organised a RWS training for our in-scope suppliers in 
June 2023, and the positive results were shown by the six RWS-certified factories in our supply chain. We 
aim to reach 100% certified wool in 2025.

BIODIVERSITY 
TARGET DESCRIPTION: 
‚Ä¢ Support the industry in setting a science-based target for biodiversity 
‚Ä¢ 100% cotton, leather and down procured from certified sources (shared target) 
‚Ä¢ Zero use of exotic skins and hides 
Relates to United Nations Sustainable Development Goals 14 and 15 
 
The world‚Äôs biodiversity experts agreed to conserve 30% of the world‚Äôs land and oceans by 2030. Biodiversity 
is also inextricably linked to climate change. 
Consequently, we have dedicated one of our 10FOR25 sustainability target areas to biodiversity. Most of 
PUMA‚Äôs biodiversity impact is based in the supply chain, particularly to the usage of agricultural raw 
materials. However, we also include biodiversity checks in our annual environmental data collection for our 
own offices, stores and warehouses around the globe. 
 
BIODIVERSITY POLICY  
As part of the Fashion Pact, we are committed to supporting the development of science-based targets 
related to biodiversity.  
In 2021 we published the PUMA biodiversity policy and animal welfare policy- signed off by our Board of 
Management- to create a framework for our approach to biodiversity and animal welfare. These policies are 
available for download on our website. 
This includes our commitments: 
‚Ä¢ as a supporting partner of the CanopyStyle initiative, to only source our viscose from Green Shirt-rated 
suppliers in order to protect endangered forests and species.  
‚Ä¢ to source the leather used in PUMA products solely from manufacturers who implement industry best 
practice standards of environmental management and traceability, such as the leather working group. 
‚Ä¢ to source all our paper and paper-based packaging from recycled sources and/or Forest Stewardship 
Council-certified sources. PUMA acted as a partner of Canopy‚Äôs Pack4Good initiative to collectively 
reduce any risk of sourcing from ancient and endangered forests by 2022 and promoting next-generation 
solutions. 
At PUMA we care for the welfare of animals. We do not use animal products which originate from animals 
that have been treated inhumanely. Therefore, we aim to implement high welfare and traceability standards 
and have published an Animal Welfare Policy. PUMA consults animal protection organisations on a regular 
basis to review our policies and actions. As a sign of our commitment to animal welfare, we joined the Fur 
Free Retailer programme and phased out the use of kangaroo leather in 2023.

BIODIVERSITY IN OUR OWN OPERATION 
We checked via our annual environmental reporting campaign and confirmed that none of our PUMA sites 
are located within a protected area. We have identified one site in South Africa, as being located next to a 
protected area, which holds a rare species of the plant, Renosterveld Finbos. This site is an office location, 
and is fenced off from the protected area, so any negative impact on these plants can be ruled out. 
There are green roofs which offer additional habitats for insects as well as wildflower meadows and 
beehives on our headquarters in Herzogenaurach, as well as on our (outsourced) German central logistics 
centre. 
 
BIODIVERSITY IN OUR SUPPLY CHAIN 
Many species, including plants, animals, bacteria and fungi are being threatened with extinction due to 
human activities such as deforestation, putting Earth‚Äôs biodiversity at risk. Apparel supply chains are 
directly linked to soil degradation, conversion of natural ecosystems and waterway pollution. Two-thirds of 
apparel shoppers say that limiting the impact on climate change is now more important to them now than 
before COVID-19 (McKinsey: Biodiversity ‚Äì The next frontier in sustainable fashion). 
PUMA is a signatory to the Fashion Pact, a global initiative of companies in the fashion and textile industry 
(ready-to-wear, sport, lifestyle and luxury), all committed to a common core of key environmental goals in 
three areas mitigating global warming, restoring biodiversity and protecting the oceans. 
Biodiversity loss and climate change are interdependent and mutually reinforcing. For example, protecting 
forests could help reduce greenhouse gas emissions. In turn, the rise of global temperatures increases the 
risk of species becoming extinct. In 2019 PUMA published its science-based emissions target (SBT) with the 
SBT Coalition and joined the Fashion Pact. In 2023 an updated and 1.5 degree aligned science-based 
emissions target was approved for Scope 1 and 2 by SBT Coalition.  
Please see the Climate section of this report to find out about our climate action and progress.

PUMA Annual Report 2023 
‚Üó Sustainability

To mitigate the risk of biodiversity loss due to the production process, we address environmental pollution 
risk through our targets and supplier programmes related to climate, chemicals, water and air. 
In 2021 we developed roadmaps for water and waste, which can be found in the Water and Air, and  
Circularity sections of this report. In 2022 we developed a biodiversity roadmap using the Fashion Pact 
Biodiversity Strategy Tool Navigator that is in line with SBTN recommendations. 
At cotton farming level, Regenerative Agriculture practices aim to reduce the impact of production on soils 
and promotes soil health by restoring the soil‚Äôs organic carbon. Through our partnership with Better Cotton, 
we support regenerative cotton farming practices. BCI farmers have to follow these two principles, among 
others: 
‚Ä¢ Care for the health of soil: This principle requires farmers to develop a Soil Management Plan. The plan 
should include practices that contribute to maintaining and enhancing soil structure and soil fertility, 
and continuously improving nutrient cycling.  
‚Ä¢ Enhance biodiversity and use land responsibly: This principle requires Better Cotton farmers to adopt a 
Biodiversity Management Plan to conserve biodiversity on and around their farm. This plan includes 
regenerative farming practices such as ensuring crop rotation, which helps with soil regeneration. 
BIODIVERSITY ROADMAP 
Scope: Cotton, Leather, Rubber, Paper, MMCF, Synthetics, Wool 
Below are some key focus areas for the coming years. Some measures were implemented in 2022 and 2023 
and are covered in this report. 
‚Ä¢ Raise awareness: We see the need to raise awareness internally and will be developing an e-learning on 
biodiversity for our staff. We also see the need to increase the awareness of our consumers. We aim to 
maintain transparency to keep a strong relationship with stakeholders while providing information about 
biodiversity actions. In 2022, PUMA sponsored the Biodiversity Landscape Analysis Report as an 
opportunity to foster collaboration and knowledge-sharing in biodiversity. Together with Textile 
Exchange, Conservation International and the Fashion Pact, the Biodiversity Landscape Analysis Report 
aims to provide a common reference point on the topic of biodiversity in the textile industry, and to offer 
concrete pathways for brands and retailers to deepen their engagement. The report, which was 
published in 2023 intends to help companies of all sizes and maturities to begin or continue their 
biodiversity journey.  
‚Ä¢ Knowledge of impact: We will explore traceability tools and conduct impact assessments, starting with 
leather and rubber. We collect material and packaging consumption data on an annual basis for the 
country of origin. For example, only a small percentage of the total leather used in PUMA products 
originates from South America, where deforestation is occurring at a rapid pace. Our EP&L identifies 
how the environmental impact is distributed along our value chain, for example, land use change per 
country, material type and tier level. The potential financial impact on land use was estimated to be 
approximately ‚Ç¨ 100 million in our 2023 EP&L. 
‚Ä¢ Internal action: We will define a KPI to be included in a supplier scorecard (environmental and chemical) 
and set biodiversity targets as well as traceability targets, starting with leather. We set goals to reach 
100% cotton, leather, viscose, paper packaging and down-procured from certified sources in 2025. Both 
cotton farming and cattle ranching require extensive land use and are known to reduce biodiversity, 
99.2% of cotton used in PUMA products is BCI or recycled cotton. 99.7% of the leather used in our foot-
wear is sourced from Leather Working Group (LWG) medal-rated tanneries. Leather traceability is a first 
step towards reducing deforestation. We monitor our LWG medal-rated tanneries' traceability 
performance and have joined the LWG Traceability working group. We partner with the NGO, Canopy, a 
Canadian non-profit organisation with the mission to protect the world‚Äôs forests, species and climate, 
and to help advance indigenous communities‚Äô rights. We aim to ensure that our sourcing of man-made 
cellulosic materials (such as viscose) as well as paper and cardboard, does not contribute to de-
forestation. 99.4% of our paper packaging is either recycled and/or FSC-certified. We commit to sourcing 


PUMA Annual Report 2023 
‚Üó Sustainability

100% of our viscose from suppliers committed to reducing the risk of sourcing from ancient and 
endangered forests. In 2023, 84% of viscose was sourced from Green Shirt-rated suppliers. We hardly 
used wool (6,566 kg in 2023), but we have initiated Responsible Wool Standards certification. We aim to 
reach 100% certified responsible wool by 2025. 
‚Ä¢ Collaboration and partnership: PUMA joined the Fashion Pact, a global coalition of companies in the 
fashion and textile industry that is committed to stopping global warming, restoring biodiversity and 
protecting the oceans. PUMA joined the Fashion Charter, and committed to sourcing 100% of priority 
materials as preferred materials by 2030 (material for which no natural ecosystems are converted or 
deforested). In 2021 we engaged with Canopy, who helped us develop our policy on forest protection. We 
also engaged with Canopy‚Äòs initiatives: CanopyStyle and Pack4good. Through these initiatives, we started 
investigating the next generation of raw materials with a focus on biobased materials, such as wheat 
straw, as a partial substitute for paper in our shopping paper bags. 
BIODIVERSITY RISK ASSESSMENT  
In 2023, we conducted a biodiversity risk assessment for our key raw materials such as cotton, polyester 
and leather. For cotton and polyester, we used the Materials Impact Explorer tool provided by Textile 
Exchange.  For leather, we used the Biodiversity Risk and Impact Dashboard of Fashion Pact. PUMA is 
currently taking steps to mitigate biodiversity risks and address environmental pollution risks through our 
targets and supplier programmes related to the climate, chemicals, water and air.  
We evaluated the environmental risk of rubber using the EiQ platform from Elevate. EiQ is a data-driven 
supply chain Environmental, Social, and Governance (ESG) due diligence platform used by businesses to 
enhance ESG risk management. The environmental risk encompasses water use, non-GHG air pollutants, 
terrestrial ecosystem use, soil pollutants, solid waste and water pollutants. We also mapped our sourcing of 
these materials by country. 
For cotton and polyester, we mapped our material consumption by country of origin using the Materials 
Impact Explorer tool to evaluate the potential impact on biodiversity in terms of changes in the state of 
nature (quality or quantity) which may result in changes to the capacity of nature to sustain social and 
economic functions. We also evaluated the risk of dependency in terms of environmental assets and 
ecosystem services that an organisation relies on to function. The dependency risk rating for recycled cotton 
and recycled polyester is not applicable as per the tool used. The outcome of the assessment is 
summarised below. The risk profile of a few countries from which PUMA is sourcing cotton and polyester 
is not available in the tool. However, such countries represent less than 5% of our sourcing volume for 
cotton and 13% for polyester.   
As a next step, we will look at a collaborative approach and join programmes with third-party initiatives to 
understand governance challenges. 
Cotton: In 2023, we sourced 63% of cotton from the USA, followed by Brazil (15%) and Australia (8%). These 
three countries have high a risk rating for potential impact. 4% of cotton is sourced from India which a very 
high-risk country.  
In terms of dependency risk, the USA, Brazil and Australia are categorised as high-risk countries, whereas 
India is categorised as a very high-risk country.  
We have required our suppliers to source only cotton grown in farms that are licensed as having good 
farming and human rights standards or recycled cotton from factories that are either Global Recycled 
Standard (GRS) or Recycled Claim Standard (RCS) certified in 2025.  
PUMA is taking steps to mitigate the biodiversity risks associated with the cotton sourcing. These include 
the adoption of BCI cotton, increased usage of recycled cotton, focusing on innovation to increase the share 
of recycled cotton in our products, conducting Life Cycle Assessment of products and materials to evaluate 


PUMA Annual Report 2023 
‚Üó Sustainability 
181 
environmental impact in different lifecycle stages and engaging with textile exchange to stay informed on 
industry best practices.  
We collect material consumption data on an annual basis along with the country of origin and require our 
suppliers to keep all the supportive documentation at disposal. We have also established an on-going due 
diligence programme with our partner laboratory in Germany where we regularly test samples of cotton 
finished garments before shipment. This further strengthens traceability and control across our supply 
chain, from the raw material to the finished products. 
Through our partnership with Better Cotton, we support regenerative cotton farming practices. Better 
Cotton Soil Health principles require farmers to develop a Soil Management Plan. The plan should include 
practices that contribute to maintaining and enhancing soil structure and soil fertility, and continuously 
improving nutrient cycling.  
Better Cotton Biodiversity principles require Better Cotton farmers to adopt a Biodiversity Management 
Plan to conserve biodiversity on and around their farms. This Plan includes regenerative farming practices 
such as ensuring crop rotation, which helps with soil regeneration. Biodiversity loss and climate change are 
interdependent and mutually reinforcing. Protecting forests, for example, could help reduce greenhouse gas 
emissions. 
Through our partnership with Better Cotton, we also support cotton farmer producers for climate-friendly 
practices, Better Cotton has set the goal of reducing greenhouse gas emissions by 50% per ton of Better 
Cotton lint produced by the end of the decade.  
In 2023, the share of BCI cotton was 90% and recycled cotton made up 8.6% of all cotton sourced by PUMA. 
Polyester: We sourced 79% of our polyester from China in 2023, followed by Taiwan 9.2% and Vietnam 
7.4%. We sourced both virgin polyester and recycled polyester from China, whereas we sourced only 
recycled polyester from Taiwan and Vietnam. China has a very high-risk rating in terms of the potential 
impact of virgin polyester. Recycled polyester is rated as medium risk irrespective of country of origin by the 
Textile Exchange tool. 
In terms of risk related to dependency, China, Turkey, South Korea, Japan and Indonesia are rated as very 
high-risk countries for virgin polyester whereas the USA and Germany are considered as high-risk 
countries. However, apart from China, we source a negligible volume (around 1%) from high, and very high-
risk countries. 
We have required our suppliers to source only polyester-certified to Bluesign/ Oekotex, or recycled polyester 
from factories that are either Global Recycled Standard (GRS) or Recycled Claim Standard (RCS) certified in 
2025.  PUMA has joined the Textile Exchange polyester challenge, since our 2025 goal of 75% recycled 
polyester is aligned with this challenge. While most of our recycled polyester to date has been made 
from PET bottles, PUMA launched the innovative RE:FIBRE programme, and can repurpose collected textile 
waste and other used materials to create new textiles. We engaged our core fabric manufacturing plants in 
energy efficiency programmes and are helping them to transition to 25% renewable energy processing in 
2025. We monitor and report chemical discharges, and work to eliminate pollutant chemicals.  
In 2023, we sourced a bio-based, high-performance polyester fibre known as Sorona, which constitutes 
0.11% of our total polyester consumption. Sorona contains over 20% bio-based carbon, which helps reduce 
the environmental impact without sacrificing quality and performance. Sorona is produced using a 
fermentation process which utilizes corn sugar as the main ingredient.  
Leather: The Fashion Pact Dashboard allows us to assess overall risk in terms of biodiversity loss and land 
use area. However, biodiversity risk specific to leather usage by a brand or company cannot be evaluated by 
using this dashboard. We plan to explore a more specific tool for leather in future.  


PUMA Annual Report 2023 
‚Üó Sustainability 
182 
In 2023, we sourced 61% of our leather from the USA, followed by Argentina (27%), Australia (6%) and Brazil 
(5%). The risk assessment indicates that the USA has a risk rating of very high for land use impact and high 
risk for biodiversity loss, while Argentina has a very high-risk rating for land use impact and a medium risk 
rating for biodiversity loss. Australia has a medium-risk rating for both impact categories while Brazil has 
very high-risk rating for both impact areas.  
PUMA is taking several steps to mitigate the biodiversity risks associated with leather sourcing. These 
include sourcing leather from LWG-rated tanneries, setting goals for sourcing deforestation-free leather, 
and focusing on innovation in the development of recycled and other bio-based alternatives. We engage with 
Fashion Pact, Textile Exchange and the Leather Working Group to remain updated about industry best 
practices.  
We have committed to sourcing all the bovine leather used in our products from verified deforestation-free 
supply chains by 2030 or earlier launched by global non-profits Textile Exchange and the Leather Working 
Group. The initiative aims to create equitable, transparent, and deforestation-free leather supply chains. The 
cross-sector initiative is aimed at galvanizing brands into action to end the deforestation and conversion of 
natural ecosystems linked to leather sourcing. In doing so, it looks to protect wildlife habitats and 
biodiversity, preserve carbon stocks to mitigate climate change, and protect human rights. 
Close to 100% of the leather that PUMA currently sources comes from Leather Working Group-certified 
tanneries. This means that the leather used in PUMA products comes from manufacturers who are working 
to implement industry best practices of environmental management and traceability. PUMA currently 
monitors its LWG medal-rated tanneries‚Äô upstream traceability performance. 
However, around 76% of the leather used at PUMA is suede, a byproduct of the full-grain leather business. 
The challenge faced currently by PUMA and others in the industry is that most suede tanneries work with 
agents and intermediaries alongside direct tanneries, to guarantee a stable supply which creates a 
challenge to have full traceability at the cattle ranch level. 
Our innovation team has worked to address the technological limitations of a shoe designed for composting 
and launched the RE:SUEDE experiment. In 2022, 500 participants were asked to wear their RE:SUEDEs for 
six months before returning them to PUMA for the next stage of the experiment. A total of 412 pairs of worn 
RE:SUEDEs were returned to PUMA and sent to our industrial composting partner Valor Composting ‚Äì a 
family business that takes a different approach to waste. We discovered that it is possible to turn the 
RE:SUEDE into Grade A compost under specific industrial conditions provided by Ortessa. RE:SUEDE is 
mainly made up of zeolite-tanned suede leather, hemp fibres, biodegradable TPE and organic cotton. The 
zeolite tanning process is an innovative approach to in tanning chemicals, which use mineral zeolite and is 
free from toxic substances such as chrome, heavy metal and aldehyde. We will continue to innovate with our 
partners to determine the infrastructure and technologies needed to make the process viable for a 
commercial version of the RE:SUEDE, including a take-back scheme, in 2024. 
Synthetic Rubber: We sourced, 74% of our synthetic rubber from China, followed by Vietnam 14% and South 
Korea 4%. China and South Korea are high-risk countries, while the risk profile for synthetic rubber from 
Vietnam is not available on the EiQ platform. High risks are Greenhouse Gas emissions, water use and solid 
waste. 
We have not yet mapped the manufacturing plants supplying synthetic rubber to our outsole manufacturers.  
As part of our 10FOR25, we work on developing recycled materials as alternatives to rubber. In 2023, 5% of 
synthetic rubber was recycled.  We engage our strategic outsole suppliers in Higg FEM (environmental 
performance tool measurement which includes energy use and greenhouse gas emissions, water use, 
wastewater, emissions to air and waste management) and work with them to eliminate pollutant chemicals. 


PUMA Annual Report 2023 
‚Üó Sustainability 
183 
Natural Rubber: In 2023, we sourced 29% of natural rubber from Vietnam, followed by Brazil 25%, 
Pakistan 13%, and Thailand 5%. Vietnam is categorised as an extreme risk country, while risk profiles for 
natural rubber from Brazil, Pakistan and Thailand are not available on the EiQ platform. The main high risks 
are water use and impact on ecosystem. In 2023, only 2% of the rubber used in our products was natural 
rubber. We aim in future to only source FSC certified rubber. FSC certification include adopting standards to 
maintain, conserve, and/or restore the ecosystem and environmental values of managed forests and avoid, 
repair, or mitigate negative environmental impacts.

ENVIRONMENTAL KEY PERFORMANCE DATA  
–ì 
The PUMA Environmental Profit and Loss Account, or EP&L, calculates the environmental impact of 
PUMA's activities in financial terms across six categories from raw material production to the PUMA store. 
While the EP&L is not a precise measurement tool, it helps to show the categories and stages of the value 
chain in which the impact is greatest and therefore gives a good indication of where we should focus our 
efforts. 
The EP&L methodology, was developed in 2011 by PWC and Truecost, and later refined by Kering with the 
help of PWC. It mainly relies on material input and spending data. 
Over the last years, we have added primary data for our Tier 1 and Tier 2 suppliers and developed specific 
EP&L emission factors for major materials used, such as Better Cotton. 
However, we are still in the process of fully aligning our EP&L methodology for Tiers 3 and 4 with internal 
and external standards. As a result, the table below differs from our Scope 3 emission calculation in the 
Climate section and also results in a high water value for Tier 3 due to some wet processing for leather and 
polyester being attributed to Tier 3. 
We will continue to work on the alignment of methodologies to strengthen the EP&L as a valuable risk 
assessment and information tool.

‚Üó G.37 EP&L TREND 2020 ‚Äì 2023 
 
From our EP&L results, we can conclude that the production (48%) and processing of raw materials (28%) is 
responsible for the vast majority of the environmental impact from a process point of view, while 
greenhouse gas emissions (33%), water pollution (22%) and land use (21%) are responsible for over half of 
all environmental impact measured by the EP&L in terms of impact categories. 
This confirms our strategy of transitioning to the use of low-impact materials at scale, while focusing on the 
reduction of greenhouse gas emissions across our supply chain.  
The EP&L trend over the last years shows that the EP&L value is growing slower than sales. This means 
that while the overall impact was growing, we were able to reduce the EP&L value relative to sales. In 2023, 
we achieved an absolute reduction.

PRODUCT/MATERIAL-RELATED E-KPIS 
We have been measuring the average environmental key performance indicators (E-KPIs) from Textile and 
Leather manufacturing (Tier 2) and Apparel and Footwear manufacturing (Tier 1) since 2017. 
In 2023, the Greenhouse Gas emissions KPIs reduced across the product divisions, both Tier 1 and Tier 2, 
except for the footwear division, where it almost remained stable (increase by 0.2%) as compared to 2020. 
CO2 emissions per piece of garment reduced by 23.2%; per square metre of leather produced, CO2 emissions 
have reduced by 40.7% and per ton of textile produced, CO2 emissions reduced by 9.2%. This was mainly 
achieved due to various climate actions initiated as described in the report. The participation of core 
suppliers in cleaner production and renewable energy programmes, installation of rooftop solar projects, 
switching from coal to biomass, and the purchase of RECs are the main contributor for these reductions 
achieved in Greenhouse Gas emissions.  
In 2023, water consumption per pair/square metre reduced for footwear by 21.5% and 4.9% for textile as 
compared to the baseline of 2020 mainly due to the implementation of water efficiency measures including 
water recycling plants by a few textile mills towards the end of 2022.  
However, the water KPI increased for apparel by 9.4%, and for leather by 11.7%. For apparel, production 
reduced by 15% as compared to 2020 (which is 33% reduction from 2022). Most of the apparel factories use 
water for domestic purposes and hence water consumption depends on the number of workers. In 2023, the 
market environment and increased inventory levels resulted in a need for more cautious procurement from

our suppliers, so the number of workers in core apparel factories decreased by 9% and production fell by 
15% resulting in higher water consumption per piece of apparel as compared to 2020. 
Out of five leather factories, two were new core factories and have not participated in resource efficiency 
programmes. One of the tanneries in China has relatively high water consumption as they process raw hide 
in-house, whereas other leather tanneries process wet blue leather (tanned leather, but not dried, dyed nor 
finished). Also, one tannery in Vietnam started tracking and reporting rainwater usage in 2023.    
In 2023, production waste to landfills decreased by 87.4% for apparel and by 64.7% for the footwear division 
as compared to the 2020 baseline. This is mainly due to the adoption of better waste disposal practices by 
our suppliers and being able to achieve diversion from landfill. We also observed that factories were able to 
track and report waste data more accurately.

For tables on E-KPI results, the values for November and December 2023 were estimated by employing the Exponential 
Smoothing (ETS) algorithm in Microsoft Excel, utilizing data from January to October of 2023. This approach was chosen after 
comparing it to alternative methods, considering its performance against actual historical data, specifically in terms of deviation 
from the actual values in percentage terms. The ETS method displayed both higher accuracy and higher precision compared to 
other methods, such as averaging the last 10/12 months or multiplying the estimated production by the average KPI (per 
production unit) from the 12 months of data spanning from November 2021 to October 2022.

REPORTING IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE EU 
TAXONOMY REGULATION 
TAXONOMY OBJECTIVES 
The Taxonomy Regulation (EU) 2020/852 (in the following ‚Äúthe Taxonomy‚Äù) entered into force on 22 June 2020. 
The purpose of this regulation is to provide a definition of what constitutes a sustainable economic activity 
and to redirect capital flows into companies that are aligning their business models towards such sustainable 
economic activities. To achieve this goal, companies must report on the proportion of ‚Äúenvironmentally 
sustainable‚Äù revenues, investments (capital expenditure) and operating expenses.  
The focus of the Taxonomy lies on 6 environmental objectives: 
‚Ä¢ Climate change mitigation 
‚Ä¢ Climate change adaptation 
‚Ä¢ Sustainability and protection of water and marine resources 
‚Ä¢ Pollution prevention and control 
‚Ä¢ Protection and restoration of biodiversity and ecosystems 
‚Ä¢ Transition to a circular economy 
The Taxonomy has identified eligible economic activities that substantially contribute to each of these 
environmental objectives. Linked to these eligible activities are technical screening criteria as well as do no 
significant harm criteria and minimum safeguards that define whether the activity is considered sustainable 
or not (aligned).  
Delegated Regulation (EU) 2021/2178 as of July 6, 2021 on the climate objectives (climate change mitigation 
(Annex I) and climate change adaptation (Annex II)) (‚Äúthe Climate Delegated Act‚Äù), was published in the 
Official Journal on December 9, 2021 and entered into force on January 1, 2022 ((EU) 2021/2139). Further 
delegated acts for the remaining objectives were published in 2023, namely EU 2022/1214 (Complementary 
Climate DA), EU 2023/2485 (amending EU 2021/2139), EU 2023/2486 (targets three to six), C(2023)3850 
(Amended Climate DA) and C(2023)3851 Environmental DA (targets three to six). 
 
DISCLOSURE REQUIREMENTS FOR NON-FINANCIAL UNDERTAKINGS 
According to Article 2 of the Climate Delegated Act and Article 8 of the Taxonomy any undertaking subject to 
the Non-Financial Reporting Directive (NFRD) must provide information on ‚Äúenvironmentally sustainable‚Äù 
revenues, investments (capital expenditure) and operating expenses (OpEx).  
According to Article 10 of the Climate Delegated Act undertakings must disclose the proportion of 
Taxonomy-eligible and Taxonomy non-eligible economic activities in their total turnover, capital expenditure 
and operational expenditure. The eligibility of an activity implies that an activity is included in the Climate 
Delegated Act. Whether an activity is Taxonomy-eligible or not says nothing about the sustainability of that 
activity. Being Taxonomy-eligible is merely an indication that a certain activity makes a substantial 
contribution to one of the six environmental objectives of the Taxonomy. From January 1, 2023, the 
disclosure must also include information on taxonomy alignment, meaning only activities that are included 
in the ‚Äúenvironmentally sustainable share‚Äù of the three performance indicators. An economic activity is 
environmentally sustainable if it: 
‚Ä¢ makes a significant contribution to the achievement of one or more environmental goals (significant 
contribution, SC) 


PUMA Annual Report 2023 
‚Üó Sustainability 
189 
‚Ä¢ does not result in significant harm to one of more of the environmental objectives (do no significant 
harm, DNSH) 
‚Ä¢ is carried out in compliance with a defined minimum level of protection (minimum safeguards, MS) and 
complies with technical screening criteria (TSC) of Annex I and Annex II. 
 
TAXONOMY-ELIGIBILITY OF PUMA‚ÄôS ECONOMIC ACTIVITIES IN RESPECT TO THE 
ENVIRONMENTAL OBJECTIVES OF THE EU TAXONOMY 
The technical screening criteria in Annex I and Annex II of Delegated Regulation (EU) 2021/2139 of June 4, 
2021 for the first two environmental objectives, namely climate change mitigation and climate change 
adaptation, do not list any business activities that are linked to the production and sale of footwear, apparel 
and accessories. This means that PUMA‚Äôs business activities so far do not qualify as contributing 
substantially to climate change mitigation or climate change adaptation.  
Further technical screening criteria were published as Annexes I, III and IV of Delegated Regulation (EU) 
2023/2486 (supplementing EU 2020/852) of June 27, 2023, for the remaining environmental objectives, 
namely sustainable use and protection of water and marine resources, pollution prevention and control as 
well as restoration of biodiversity and ecosystems. Likewise, these do not list any business activities that are 
linked to the production and sale of footwear, apparel and accessories. 
For the remaining environmental objective published as Annex II, the transition to a circular economy, 
activities related to apparel are listed, but are limited to sales generated by services such as repair, 
remanufacturing or refurbishment, preparation for reuse, sale of second-hand goods, or product as a 
service business models, none of which are not part of PUMA current revenue generating activities. 
As mentioned in the Circularity section of this report, PUMA and its partners are piloting fibre to fibre 
recycling technology and take-back systems. However, those activities have not generated any significant 
Taxonomy-eligible or aligned sales under the definition of Annex II and had a project status in 2023.  
Therefore, PUMA‚Äôs business activities in this regard are not considered Taxonomy-eligible (so far). Since 
PUMA does not have any economic activities related to nuclear power or power generation from gas, PUMA 
will not report the related standard forms from the Delegated Act (EU 2022/1214). 
 
ELIGIBLE CAPITAL EXPENDITURE 
PUMA understands that the Taxonomy and the Climate Delegated Act as well as the Environmental 
Delegated Act including its Annexes nonetheless requires non-financial undertakings with non-Taxonomy 
eligible economic activities to report on the part of the capital expenditure related to the purchase of output 
from Taxonomy-aligned economic activities and individual measures enabling target activities to become 
low-carbon or to lead to greenhouse gas reductions.  
In this regard PUMA reviewed so-called cross-cutting activities that are not directly related to PUMA‚Äôs 
primary business activity and are not revenue-generating for PUMA but still are of relevance to support 
PUMA‚Äôs sustainability efforts. Taxonomy-eligible capital expenditure could be identified with regard to 
‚ÄúTransport‚Äù and ‚ÄúReal Estate Activities‚Äù. 
The key figures are determined based on Delegated Regulations (EU) 2020/852, 2021/2139 and 2021/2178 as 
well as 2023/2385 and 2023/2086 in conjunction with the accounting policies to be applied to the 
consolidated financial statements. To avoid double counting, expenditure has been allocated to only one 
economic activity. 
 
 


PUMA Annual Report 2023

In 2023 PUMA made investments in several buildings, including: 
‚Ä¢ A new solar PV station in Germany (planned completion in 2024) 
‚Ä¢ New charging stations in Germany 
‚Ä¢ Office space in Argentina 
The technical screening criteria of Annexes I and II define a taxonomy-aligned investment in buildings only 
for those buildings that are ranked among the top 15% of their regional building stock in terms of Primary 
Energy Demand (PED). 
Since there is no precise definition of this 15%, for example in terms of area covered or primary energy 
demand per m
2, and as the rental of buildings is not material to PUMA‚Äôs business performance in terms of 
CO2 emissions, we have decided to report the Taxonomy-aligned investment in buildings for 2023 as zero. 
This does not mean that PUMA is not investing in lowering CO2 emissions from its own entities. As described 
in the Climate section of this report, our Scope 1 and 2 emissions have been reduced by 85% compared to 
our baseline in 2017, mainly through green electricity tariffs or renewable energy attribute certificates. 
In 2023 PUMA also invested in charging stations for electric cars, which do fall under the taxonomy 
alignment criteria for climate mitigation. The total investment in these charging stations was 241 TEUR 
(2022: 79 TEUR). 
Furthermore, PUMA started to invest in additional solar PV capacity at its headquarters in Germany. The 
investment in 2023 came to 262 TEUR (no investment in 2022). 
As part of PUMA‚Äôs 10FOR25 sustainability targets, PUMA is transitioning its car fleet to more sustainable 
transport vehicles. Therefore, in 2023 PUMA invested in the lease of 92 low or zero emission vehicles (2022: 
64 vehicles). 
Unlike buildings, the technical screening criteria for CO2 emissions for taxonomy alignments are clearly 
defined as below 50 g CO2/km. 
We can confirm that 92 cars added to our car fleet are Taxonomy-aligned with the technical screening 
criteria based on their CO2 emission footprint, equalling an investment of over 2,000 TEUR (2022: 1,521 TEUR) 
Considering the do-no-significant harm criteria of tires for passenger cars, not all those cars can be 
considered as fully Taxonomy-aligned, as many of the standard tires used for our new electric cars from 
Tesla, Volkswagen, Hyundai, Mercedes and BMW do not fulfil the criteria for noise emissions. As a result  
the reported  Taxonomy-aligned investment in vehicles for the year 2023 is 408 TEUR (2022: 372 TEUR). 
The total capital expenditure (IAS 16, 38 and IFRS 16) of the PUMA Group amounts to 599,874 TEUR for the 
year 2023 (2022: 669,382 TEUR). The eligible capital expenditure related to ‚ÄúTransport‚Äù amounts to 7,930 
TEUR (2022: 5,427 TEUR) and the amount related to‚ÄúReal Estate Activities /Other‚Äù is 336,500 TEUR 
(2022:376,996 TEUR). The Taxonomy-aligned capital expenditure from investment in solar PV, low or zero 
emission cars and charging stations for electric cars was 910 TEUR (2022: 372 TEUR). 
 
ELIGIBLE OPERATIONAL EXPENDITURE 
PUMA understands that the Taxonomy and the Disclosure Delegated Regulation (EU 21/2178) nonetheless 
asks non-financial undertakings with non- Taxonomy eligible activities to report on the part of the 
operational expenditure related to the purchase of output from Taxonomy-aligned economic activities and 
individual measures enabling the target activities to become low-carbon or to lead to greenhouse gas 
reductions.  


PUMA Annual Report 2023 
‚Üó Sustainability 
191 
Due to the nature of our business model, which is the design, development, marketing and sale of footwear, 
apparel and accessories, the eligible operational expenditure is not material in the context of the  
environmental objectives of the Taxonomy, therefore  the numerator of our taxonomy-eligible operational 
expenditure is zero. 
For the denominator, Article 2, Section 1.1.3.1. of Annex 1 the Climate Delegated Act asks for reporting on the 
total operational expenditure derived from the categories ‚Äúresearch and development, building renovation 
measures, short-term lease, maintenance and repair and any other direct expenditures related to the day-
to-day servicing of assets of property, plant and equipment by the undertaking or third party to whom 
activities are outsourced that are necessary to ensure the continued and effective functioning of such 
asset.‚Äù The total operational expenditure from these categories amounts to 113.4 TEUR (2022: 103.6 TEUR) 
for the 2023 financial year. 
 
OUTLOOK 
At PUMA, we will continue the transition of our car fleet to low or zero emission vehicles in those countries 
where the charging infrastructure can support running an electric car fleet. We also plan to continue 
investing in te renewable energy capacity of the buildings we own. In addition, we will explore the activities 
listed under ‚ÄúTransition to a circular economy‚Äù to assess their technical and financial viability over the next 
years.

INDEX FOR COMBINED NON-FINANCIAL REPORT 
AND GRI CONTENT 
This report constitutes a separate combined non-financial report in accordance with Sections 289b to 289e 
and 315b, 315c in conjunction with Sections 289c to 289e of the German Commercial Code (HGB). This 
consolidated combined non-financial report consists of the "Sustainability" and "Culture" subsections in the 
"Our People"section as well as ‚ÄúCompliance Management System‚Äù and ‚ÄúCorporate Social Responsibility‚Äù in 
the chapter ‚ÄúCorporate Governance Statement in accordance with Section 289f and Section 315d HGB‚Äù. The 
reporting period covered is from January 1, 2023 to December 31, 2023. No restatements of information have 
been made in this report. We have provided separate reports for PUMA SE and the PUMA Group within the 
‚ÄúOur People‚Äù section only. Separate reporting of other sustainability data would not add any meaningful new 
information or value and would require significant additional resources, so we have omitted it here. 
Information about PUMA‚Äôs business model is set out in the Financial section of this Annual Report. We have 
not identified any most significant non-financial performance indicators according to Article ¬ß 289c, section 
3, number 5 of the German Commercial Code (HGB). PUMA engaged KPMG AG Wirtschaftspr√ºfungs-
gesellschaft to perform a ‚Äúlimited assurance‚Äù audit of the combined sustainability report with a focus on 
accordance with the German CSR Implementation Act (CSR-RUG). 
Since 2003 PUMA‚Äôs sustainability reports are based on the guidelines of the Global Reporting Initiative (GRI), 
which developed detailed and widely recognised standards on sustainability reporting. PUMA SE has 
prepared this report with reference to the GRI Standards GRI 1: Foundation 2021. This option enables us to 
report on the impacts related to our economic, environmental, social and governance performance. It 
includes topics that are material to PUMA‚Äôs business and our key stakeholders, and that constitute our 
sustainability targets. These targets have been systematically developed in accordance with the feedback 
from PUMA‚Äôs stakeholders.

TAX

 GRI 207: Tax 2019 
207-1 Approach to tax 
‚ÄúWE PAY OUR FAIR SHARE‚Äù is the 
core principle the PUMA Group is 
taking into consideration for its global 
tax strategy. In this regard, PUMA 
fully commits to act in accordance 
with all international tax regulations 
and to fulfill any tax obligations 
arising from its business activities.  
All information regarding PUMA‚Äôs tax 
approach can be found in the tax 
strategy 
(https://about.puma.com/en/investor-
relations/corporate-governance, see 
Tax Strategy) 
  
 
  
As it is a general principle for PUMA 
to follow tax rules and to pay 
applicable taxes, taxes as such are 
not a material issue within the 
sustainability approach. 
Consequently, PUMA does not report 
in detail on the GRI Standard in this 
regard.

KPMG ASSURANCE STATEMENT 
To the PUMA SE, Herzogenaurach 
We have performed a limited assurance engagement on the combined separate non-financial group report 
of PUMA SE, Herzogenaurach (hereinafter: ‚Äúcompany‚Äù), which was combined with the non-financial report 
of the parent company for the period from January 1 to December 31, 2023 (hereinafter the ‚Äúconsolidated 
non-financial report‚Äù). This consolidated non-financial report consists of the chapter ‚ÄúSustainability‚Äù, the 
section ‚ÄúCulture‚Äù in the chapter ‚ÄúOur People‚Äù and the sections ‚ÄúCompliance Management System‚Äù and 
‚ÄúCorporate Social Responsibility‚Äù in the chapter ‚ÄúCorporate Governance Statement in accordance with 
Section 289f and Section 315d HGB‚Äù of the Annual Report 2023 of PUMA SE, Herzogenaurach. 
Not subject of our assurance engagement was the material audit of the external sources of documentation, 
interviews, case studies, expert opinions, the Environmental Profit & Loss figures as well as checking the 
content of links to internet pages mentioned in the non-financial report (see Annex 1 to the assurance 
report). 
Responsibilities of Management 
Management of PUMA SE, Herzogenaurach, is responsible for the preparation of the consolidated non-
financial report in accordance with Sections 315c in conjunction with 289c to 289e HGB and Article 8 of 
REGULATION (EU) 2020/852 OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT AND OF THE COUNCIL of June 18, 2020 on 
establishing a framework to facilitate sustainable investment and amending Regulation (EU) 2019/2088 
(hereinafter the ‚ÄúEU Taxonomy Regulation‚Äù) and the Delegated Acts adopted thereunder, as well as for 
making their own interpretation of the wording and terms contained in the EU Taxonomy Regulation and the 
delegated acts adopted thereunder as set out in section ‚ÄúReporting in accordance with the EU taxonomy 
regulation‚Äù of the consolidated non-financial report. 
This responsibility of the legal representatives of the company includes the selection and application of 
appropriate non-financial reporting methods and making assumptions and estimates about individual non-
financial disclosures of the group that are reasonable in the circumstances. Furthermore, management is 
responsible for such internal control as they consider necessary to enable the preparation of a consolidated 
non-financial report that is free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud (manipulation of the 
non-financial group report) or error. 
The EU Taxonomy Regulation and the Delegated Acts issued thereunder contain wording and terms that are 
still subject to considerable interpretation uncertainties and for which clarifications have not yet been 
published in every case. Therefore, management has disclosed their interpretation of the EU Taxonomy 
Regulation and the Delegated Acts adopted thereunder in section ‚ÄúReporting in accordance with the EU 
taxonomy regulation‚Äù of the consolidated non-financial report. They are responsible for the defensibility of 
this interpretation. Due to the immanent risk that indeterminate legal terms may be interpreted differently, 
the legal conformity of the interpretation is subject to uncertainties. 
Independence and Quality Assurance of the Assurance Practitioner 
We have complied with the independence and quality assurance requirements set out in the national legal 
provisions and professional pronouncements, in particular the Professional Code for German Public 
Auditors and Chartered Accountants (in Germany) and the IDW Standard on Quality Management 1: 
Requirements for Quality Management in Audit Firms (IDW QMS 1 (09.2022)).

Responsibility of the Assurance Practitioner 
Our responsibility is to express a conclusion with limited assurance on the consolidated non-financial report 
based on our assurance engagement. 
We conducted our assurance engagement in accordance with International Standard on Assurance 
Engagements (ISAE) 3000 (Revised): ‚ÄúAssurance Engagements other than Audits or Reviews of Historical 
Financial Information‚Äù issued by the IAASB. This standard requires that we plan and perform the assurance 
engagement to obtain limited assurance about whether any matters have come to our attention that cause 
us to believe that the company‚Äôs consolidated non-financial report, other than the external sources of 
documentation or expert opinions mentioned in the non-financial report, is not prepared, in all material 
respects, in accordance with Sections 315c in conjunction with 289c to 289e HGB and the EU Taxonomy 
Regulation and the Delegated Acts issued thereunder as well as the interpretation by management 
disclosed in section ‚ÄúReporting in accordance with the EU taxonomy regulation‚Äù of the consolidated non-
financial report. 
In a limited assurance engagement, the procedures performed are less extensive than in a reasonable 
assurance engagement, and accordingly, a substantially lower level of assurance is obtained. The selection 
of the assurance procedures is subject to the professional judgment of the assurance practitioner. 
In the course of our assurance engagement we have, among other things, performed the following 
assurance procedures and other activities: 
‚Ä¢ Gain an understanding of the structure of the Group‚Äôs sustainability organisation and stakeholder 
engagement. 
‚Ä¢ Inquiries of management and relevant employees involved in the preparation of the consolidated non-
financial report about the preparation process, about the internal control system related to this process, 
and about disclosures in the non-financial report. 
‚Ä¢ A risk analysis, including media research, to identify relevant information on PUMA SE‚Äôs sustainability 
performance in the reporting period. 
‚Ä¢ Identification of likely risks of material misstatement in the consolidated non-financial report. 
‚Ä¢ Analytical procedures on selected disclosures in the consolidated non-financial report. 
‚Ä¢ Inquiries of management and relevant employees that are responsible for determining disclosures about 
concepts, due diligence processes, results and risks, performing internal control procedures and 
consolidating disclosures in the preparation of the consolidated non-financial report. 
‚Ä¢ Inspection of selected internal and external documents. 
‚Ä¢ Analytical procedures for the evaluation of data and of the trends of quantitative disclosures as reported 
at Group level by all sites. 
‚Ä¢ Evaluation of local data collection, validation and reporting processes as well as the reliability of 
reported data based on a sample taken at nine suppliers (remote site visits) and two offices (on-site and 
remote site visits). 
‚Ä¢ Assessment of the overall presentation of the disclosures. 
‚Ä¢ Inquiries of Group level personnel in order to understand the processes for identifying relevant economic 
activities according to the EU Taxonomy Regulation. 
‚Ä¢ Evaluation of the process for the identification of taxonomy-eligible and taxonomy-aligned economic 
activities and the corresponding disclosures in the consolidated non-financial report. 
In determining the disclosures in accordance with Article 8 of the EU Taxonomy Regulation, management is 
required to interpret undefined legal terms. Due to the immanent risk that undefined legal terms may be 
interpreted differently, the legal conformity of their interpretation and, accordingly, our assurance 
engagement thereon are subject to uncertainties.

OVERVIEW 2023 
‚îå  
In 2023, we celebrated PUMA‚Äôs 75th anniversary with events around the world which highlighted our proud 
history with our employees and our brand ambassadors. PUMA‚Äôs founder Rudolf Dassler had the vision of 
making products that would provide athletes with the agility and speed of a puma and through this vision, 
PUMA has left a firm mark on sports and culture since 1948. 
Even though we faced many global uncertainties during the year, PUMA was able to sustain its strong brand 
momentum as we launched significant new products and initiatives. 
In Teamsport, the Women's World Cup in Australia and New Zealand was an important moment to 
emphasize our commitment to women‚Äôs football and to demonstrate our leading product offer for women: 
PUMA is the only sports brand to offer all boots in women‚Äôs specific fits. On pitch, PUMA supplied more than 
100 players and the fact that more than 90% of them chose our women‚Äôs fit shows that there is a real 
demand for these products.  
We introduced new versions of the successful boots ULTRA and FUTURE and redesigned the KING without 
kangaroo leather. Instead, PUMA uses K-BETTER, a completely new, vegan material for the upper which 
contains at least 20% recycled material. K-BETTER has proven to outperform the previous versions of the 
KING in testing for touch, comfort, and durability. The performance characteristics of K-BETTER were so 
convincing that PUMA committed to stop producing football boots with kangaroo leather altogether in 2023 
as the first company in the industry. 
In club football, PUMA team Manchester City won the treble for the first time in its history: the UEFA 
Champions League, the Premier League and the FA CUP, showcasing that it‚Äôs currently the best football 
team in the world. Manchester City was also the first team in PUMA‚Äôs history to win the Treble. 
Many PUMA teams were among the best in their respective countries: In Germany, Borussia Dortmund was 
a close runner up in the Bundesliga, in France, RC Lens and Olympique de Marseille finished second and 
third in Ligue 1, in Sweden, Malm√∂ FF won the Allsvenskan and in the Netherlands, PSV Eindhoven once 
again won the KNVB Cup. Elsewhere, the young talents of PUMA team Uruguay became world champions at 
the FIFA U-20 World Cup in Argentina. 
To extend our global reach in football, we signed agreements with South American football federation 
CONMEBOL and the African football federation CAF. As part of these agreements, PUMA will become very 
visible during the tournaments organised by these federations, for example by supplying the official match 
ball, equipping referees and officials and also conducting exciting marketing campaigns which will engage 
with football fans on these continents. 
On the players‚Äô side, PUMA welcomed some of the most inspirational talents of their generation as brand 
ambassadors in 2023 such as Kai Havertz, the Arsenal and Germany midfielder, Jack Grealish, the 
Manchester City and England playmaker, and Xavi Simons, the RB Leipzig and Netherlands midfielder.  
In track and field, the World Athletics Championships in Budapest were an immense success for us, as 
PUMA-sponsored athletes won 22 medals, including six gold medals, twice the medal count achieved in 
Eugene in 2022. PUMA athletes also won 17 medals at the European Indoor Championships in Istanbul. 
Armand ‚ÄúMondo‚Äù Duplantis once again set a new pole vault world record of 6 meters 23. For his outstanding 
performances, Mondo was named Male Athlete of the Year 2023 ‚Äì the third time he received this award in 
four years‚Äô time.  At the World Para Athletics Championships in Paris, PUMA athletes took 13 medals, with 
Cuban sprinter Omara Durand adding to her status as one of the most successful para-athletes of her 
generation with three gold medals.

‚Üó Combined Management Report

We built on our impressive portfolio of brand ambassadors by welcoming Marcell Jacobs, the current 
Olympic 100 m Champion, and Julien Alfred, the current NCAA 100m Champion to the PUMA Family. 
In our Running category, we continued to focus on establishing our NITRO‚Ñ¢ foam technology in the market. 
With our supercritical NITRO‚Ñ¢ foam, PUMA has one of the best foams in the industry and we are fully 
determined to become a sought-after brand in road running. We continue to see a strong growth trajectory 
in our third year after the launch of our first NITRO‚Ñ¢ running shoes and further underlined our credibility 
with signings of new running ambassadors: European 5,000 m Champion Konstanze Klosterhalfen, 
marathon legend Edna Kiplagat and European marathon Champion Aleksandra Lisowska. 
In basketball, we introduced the third signature shoe for PUMA Hoops ambassador LaMelo Ball, the MB.03, 
following the tremendous success of his first signature products. The MB.03 launched in several colours, 
including a version inspired by the popular cartoon series Dexter‚Äôs Laboratory.  
PUMA teamed up with NBA rookie and the 3rd NBA Draft Pick Scoot Henderson to present the new All-Pro 
NITRO‚Ñ¢, PUMA‚Äôs newest basketball silhouette, which features our NITRO‚Ñ¢ foam technology. Later in the year, 
Scoot became the youngest player ever to receive his own signature shoe, the Scoot Zeros. Breanna Stewart, 
our WNBA ambassador, introduced several versions of her signature shoe Stewie 2 throughout the year. 
Our athletes also achieved tremendous success on court, as Breanna Stewart became the most valuable 
player for the WNBA for the second time and Dennis Schr√∂der became the MVP of the tournament at the 
Basketball World Championships in Southeast Asia, when he led Germany to its first title. 
After the strong success of PUMA in basketball over the past years, we decided to broaden our reach and 
further strengthen our connection to the younger consumers. Partnering with NXTPRO gives PUMA access 
to one of the top 3 Amateur Basketball circuits with 15,000 players. 
In golf, we introduced the AEROJET family of clubs, which feature a raised skirt, symmetrical shaping and 
streamlined edges. Designed to achieve new levels of speed not believed to be possible until now, the 
AEROJET was named best driver for distance by Golf Monthly.  
To underscore our credibility in this sport, PUMA ambassador Rickie Fowler captured his sixth PGA Tour 
victory at the Rocket Mortgage Classic in Detroit, while Patricia Isabel Schmidt secured her maiden 
European Tour win at the Belgian Ladies Open. 
PUMA further added to its dominant position in motorsport by signing a landmark agreement with Formula 
1 to become the sport‚Äôs official licensing partner and exclusive trackside retailer. While PUMA will equip F1 
officials and our subsidiary stichd will operate the fan retail stores during race weekends, we will also 
produce exciting collections for the growing number of F1 fans around the world.  
The PUMA x F1 collections will be designed by A$AP Rocky, whom PUMA presented as the creative director 
for F1 in a game changing announcement. As one of the biggest cultural influencers of his day, A$AP has the 
vision and the talent to really provide a new perspective on this category. The first successful capsule 
collection was launched during the Las Vegas Grand Prix with many more products to come in 2024 and 
beyond. The extension of PUMA‚Äôs long-term partnership with Ferrari and a new contract with Williams 
Racing further increased our dominance in motorsport. 
In Sportstyle, global superstar Rihanna returned to PUMA in 2023 and the first joint product of the FENTY x 
PUMA collection, the Avanti, created a huge buzz and sold out on PUMA.com immediately. At the end of the 
year, she followed up on the Avanti with the launch of the Creeper Phatty, a remake of the plateau style she 
pioneered during her first collaboration with PUMA, which was named ‚ÄúShoe of the Year‚Äù by Footwear News 
in 2016.  


PUMA Annual Report 2023 
‚Üó Combined Management Report 
212 
PUMA‚Äôs Sportstyle offering also benefited from our strong take on the terrace trend. We reintroduced our 
classics Palermo and Super Team to the market and saw strong demand for the first drops. To mark 50 
years of hip-hop, PUMA took a journey through time with the iconic Suede, and we created several versions 
which showed how hip-hop evolved and left its unmistakable impact on culture. On time with the ongoing 
skate trend in the market, we also launched the all-new Suede XL at the end of the year. 
With styles such as the CA Pro, Slipstream and Doublecourt, we continued to have the right proposition for 
the ongoing demand for white court shoes, with our RS-X and the Velophasis we further built on our 
Progressive Running offer and with our Mayze we continued to excite our female consumers. 
Our Sportstyle offer was complemented by several successful Select collaborations with partners such as 
Noah, Palomo Spain and Rhuigi.  
‚îî 
In financial year 2023, PUMA found itself in an increasingly difficult geopolitical and macroeconomic 
environment. The conflict in the Middle East, the war in Ukraine, persistent inflation and risks of recession 
had a negative impact on the consumer sentiment and led to volatile retail demand. For this reason, the 
Management saw 2023 as a transitional year in which PUMA focused entirely on the factors that could be 
directly influenced. The main focus was on operational flexibility, the normalisation of inventories and 
ongoing cost discipline. The purpose of this was to overcome the short-term challenges without 
compromising the medium and long-term success of PUMA. In this respect, sales growth and increasing 
market shares took priority over short-term profitability optimisation. 
Despite the difficult market environment, PUMA was able to further increase its sales and set a new sales 
record in financial year 2023, based on continued strong brand momentum, exciting product launches, 
strong partnerships in all areas of the value chain and a focus on flexibility in operating activities. Currency-
adjusted sales increased by 6.6%. Due to strong negative currency effects this corresponds to an increase in 
sales in the reporting currency, the euro, of 1.6% from ‚Ç¨ 8,465 million in the previous year to ‚Ç¨ 8,602 million 
in 2023. The positive sales development was achieved despite the significant devaluation of the Argentine 
peso and was therefore largely in line with the outlook of currency-adjusted sales growth in the high single-
digit percentage range. 
Unfavourable currency effects, industry-wide sales promotion measures and fluctuating sourcing prices 
and freight costs had a negative impact on the gross profit margin in 2023. These negative effects were more 
than offset by price adjustments and a favourable regional and distribution channel mix. Overall, this led to 
an improvement in the gross profit margin from 46.1% in the previous year to 46.3% in 2023. The net 
expenditure of other operating income and expenses increased by a total of 3.3% in financial year 2023 to 
‚Ç¨ 3,403 million (from ‚Ç¨ 3,296 million in the previous year). The increase was mainly due to higher sales-
related distribution and other variable costs, the strong growth in our direct-to-consumer sales and higher 
marketing investments. This development was partially offset by operational leverage in other cost areas 
and favourable exchange rate effects. Due to the continued cost control, the cost ratio increased only from 
38.9% in the previous year to 39.6% in 2023. 
Despite the sales growth and the improvement in the gross profit margin, the slight increase in the cost 
ratio during the past financial year led to a slight decline in operating result (EBIT) of 3.0% to ‚Ç¨ 621.6 million 
(from ‚Ç¨ 640.6 million in the previous year). Despite the significant devaluation of the Argentine peso, 
operating result was therefore well within the ‚Ç¨ 590 million to ‚Ç¨ 670 million range. However, the EBIT 
margin fell from 7.6% in the previous year to 7.2% in 2023. The devaluation of the Argentine peso had a 
particularly negative effect on the financial result. Because of this, consolidated net income amounted to 
‚Ç¨ 304.9 million compared to ‚Ç¨ 353.5 million in the previous year. This corresponds to a decrease of 13.7%. 
Earnings per share therefore decreased from ‚Ç¨ 2.36 in the previous year to ‚Ç¨ 2.03. 


PUMA Annual Report 2023 
‚Üó Combined Management Report 
213 
The positive net income enables the Management Board and the Supervisory Board of PUMA SE to propose 
the distribution of a dividend of ‚Ç¨ 0.82 per share for the financial year 2023 at the Annual General Meeting on 
22 May 2024. This corresponds to a payout ratio of 40.3% of consolidated net income according to IFRS. The 
higher payout ratio results from the strong improvement in free cash flow and reflects the underlying 
positive operating business development. In general, PUMA's dividend policy continues to provide for a 
payout of 25% to 35% of consolidated net income. In the previous year, a dividend of ‚Ç¨ 0.82 per share was 
paid out (payout ratio for previous year: 34.7%).  
The PUMA share had a negative performance in financial year 2023. Based on the share price at the end of 
the previous year, the PUMA share started 2023 at a price of ‚Ç¨ 56.70. In the following twelve months, the 
price of the PUMA share ranged between ‚Ç¨ 67.22 (February 2023) and ‚Ç¨ 44.36 (May 2023). At the end of 2023, 
the price of the PUMA share was ‚Ç¨ 50.52, which represents a decline of 10.8% compared to the previous

TARGETS AND STRATEGY 
PUMA started 2023 by sharpening its strategic priorities. 
‚Üó G.01 STRATEGIC PRIORITIES 
 
Our strategic framework consists of a triangle: Elevate the Brand, Increase Product Excellence, and 
Improve Distribution Quality. Within this context, we placed a special emphasis on implementing this 
strategic framework in the US and China ‚Äì two key countries where our current market shares are 
significantly too low. The strategic framework triangle is based on our three foundational pillars of focusing 
on people first, evolving sustainability and digitalizing PUMA‚Äôs infrastructure. 
‚îå  
By elevating the brand, we want to anchor PUMA more deeply in the hearts and minds of customers, to 
become more consumer centric and to focus our investments on fewer Tier 1 ambassadors with a bigger 
reach. Finally, we will also improve our focus and engage with consumers with fewer, bigger and better 
brand and product campaigns going forward. 
With our rich history of having served athletes since 1948, our PUMA brand has some of the best logos in the 
whole industry and a huge archive of the most iconic sport moments, athletes, and products in history. This 
unmatchable DNA gives our product designers and marketeers a unique opportunity to tell our brand and 
product stories with the authenticity and credibility of a true sports brand. 
We continuously focus on enhancing our product excellence and we put innovation and quality at the heart 
of our designs. All PUMA products will have 100% sports DNA. While we celebrate the sports roots of our 
shoes on the Sportstyle side, we push for new innovations on the performance side to make our athletes 
even faster. We keep on leveraging our NITRO‚Ñ¢ foam technology in our key running styles Deviate, Velocity 
and ForeverRun and are continuously evolving to improve the cushioning, responsiveness and weight of our 
shoes. We are also continuously evolving our three strong football footwear franchises FUTURE, ULTRA and 


PUMA Annual Report 2023 
‚Üó Combined Management Report 
216 
KING, which is reflected in our ongoing market share gains in this highly competitive market. Finally, we 
also introduced the All-Pro, which we believe is one of the best basketball shoes in the industry and we will 
continue to evolve our All-Pro proposition going forward.  
PUMA is continuously improving the quality of its distribution in wholesale. Our retail partners are our key 
priority as we believe that the consumers enjoy a multi-branded retail environment to make the best 
product choices. To cater to the requirements of our retail partners and to build long-term partnerships 
with them, we provide our retail partners with the best and fastest service in the industry. PUMA continues 
to pursue its direct-to-consumer business as a complementary offering in its distribution strategy to realize 
the roles which our retail partners cannot fulfil, namely brand storytelling.  
‚îî 
In the United States, we see significant opportunities to enhance our market share in the world‚Äôs biggest 
sports market. To achieve this, we need to position ourselves as a credible performance brand. Our 
initiatives in basketball, motorsport and even football - as our new partner CONMEBOL will host the next 
Copa America in the US ‚Äì will all contribute to this target. With our roster of athletes including LaMelo Ball, 
Scoot Henderson, and Breanna Stewart in basketball and Christian Pulisic in football, we have the right 
brand ambassadors in place to connect with our target audiences in a credible manner. Furthermore, we‚Äôre 
also focussing on creating more US-first products, improving our distribution quality in the US and 
strengthening our local US organisation. 
Next to the United States, we see significant opportunities to enhance our market shares in China, the 
world‚Äôs most dynamic sports market. PUMA also has a clear strategy in place when it comes to our rebound 
in the Chinese market. We want to position PUMA as a global sports brand in China, leverage our local-for-
local resources both in terms of design and sourcing to deliver the right product to the Chinese consumer, 
improve our distribution quality in this digital-first market and strengthen our local China organisation.  
Putting our people first is an important part of our corporate strategy. PUMA‚Äôs working culture is 
characterised by diversity, inclusion, and equality, as our employees have many different nationalities and 
backgrounds. We believe this diversity to be one of our key strengths and we were thrilled to be named a 
global Top Employer in 2023. Our commitment to equality was rewarded when an independent agency 
certified that we had closed the adjusted pay gap between women and men among our employees in 
Germany. We will continue to work hard to provide our employees with an inspiring place to work which 
reflects our values. 
The aim of our FOREVER.BETTER. sustainability strategy is to fully integrate sustainability into all our core 
business functions. By 2025, we want to make nine out of ten products with materials such as certified 
cotton and viscose or recycled polyester. We also want to become more circular. 
With our RE:SUEDE project, we showed in 2023 how we can successfully turn an experimental version of our 
classic Suede sneaker into compost under certain tailor-made industrial conditions. Going forward, we will 
continue to innovate with our partners to determine the infrastructure and technologies needed to make the 
process viable for a commercial version of the RE:SUEDE, including a takeback scheme. 
To reach younger audiences with our sustainability strategy, we started our ‚ÄúVoices of a RE:GENERATION‚Äù 
initiative. The Voices, who are GEN-Z activists and environmentalists, regularly join PUMA to give our senior 
management feedback on how we can further strengthen our sustainability strategy. The voices also visited 
the factories of our partners in Asia and Turkey and helped us communicate with younger audiences 
throughout the year. We believe that new ways of communication like this and transparency are essential for 
the journey towards a more sustainable world. 
To operate efficiently and to keep up with our growth momentum, we constantly improve our infrastructure 
and processes. This includes investments in our IT systems, distribution centres and offices around the world.

PRODUCT DEVELOPMENT AND DESIGN 
Enhancing the excellence of our products is one of PUMA‚Äôs strategic priorities. In order to accomplish this, 
we will focus on five key measures: authentic sports DNA across all our products, design and innovation 
excellence, focus on clear must-win priorities, creating product franchises as a brand, and a global-local 
(‚Äúglocal‚Äù) product creation approach. 
‚îå  
As a sports company, PUMA has 75 years of history and sports authenticity, created by writing history 
alongside the world‚Äôs fastest athletes. All PUMA products will have 100% sports DNA. While we celebrate 
the sport roots of our products and rich archive on the non-performance side, we push for new innovations 
on the performance side.  
‚îî 
In addition to the clear sports DNA of our products, we also place a special emphasis on design and 
innovation across all our categories. We have a strong pipeline of innovations across all our performance 
categories both on the footwear and apparel side. We have the clear ambition to make the fastest products 
for the fastest athletes and our innovative technologies such as NITRO‚Ñ¢ will ensure that we live up to this 
ambition.  
‚îå  
Also on the design side, PUMA has a rich history of firsts and bests. We built on our legacy in 2023 by 
relaunching the Avanti with global icon Rihanna, a style which is based on the sneaker through which PUMA 
revolutionised the category in the 1990s. The Avanti is a perfect example of how we leverage our rich archive 
of iconic silhouettes while ensuring cutting-edge and on-trend design in the here and now.  
To sharpen our focus, we decided to implement fewer, bigger and better product stories and we defined four 
clear must-win priorities that we will focus on: classics, sports culture, our NITRO‚Ñ¢ technology and 
creating the best product offer for women.   
Classics are one of PUMA‚Äôs biggest asset, given our rich history and our vast archive, which continues to 
inspire our designers today. PUMA was already an established brand when football transformed to terrace, 
skate became streetwear and when fashion embraced low profile styles. This means that PUMA has 
genuine credibility to respond to the return of such trends. 
Through its archive and history, PUMA will continue to incubate new trends, such as low profile, and 
capitalise on existing trends such as the prevalent terrace and skate trends.  
For PUMA, sports culture is about more than the game, as the influence of sport can be felt long after the 
final whistle or the chequered flag. In Football, the terrace trend first started in the football stadiums of the 
1980s and made its way into fashion and streetwear.  
Basketball also has a direct impact on culture and streetwear, for example when the players make strong 
fashion statements on their way into the venue of the game, or when celebrities show of their style as they 
sit courtside.  
Few players embody this spirit and cultural influence like our ambassador LaMelo Ball, with whom we will 
continue to work on his range of signature shoes which blend performance and style.

In Motorsport, some of the biggest names in sports, film and music regularly attend Formula 1 races and 
can be seen in the pits on race weekends. By hosting races across the planet and popular documentaries 
featuring the sport, F1‚Äôs global viewership has skyrocketed in recent years and the audience has become 
more female and diverse, further increasing its influence on culture. With our strong legacy and authenticity 
in motorsport, we‚Äôre well positioned to capitalise on this growing cultural influence and create relevant F1-
inspired streetwear. We already showcased this approach when we released a bespoke capsule collection 
with A$AP Rocky, our creative director for the PUMA X F1 partnership, during the Las Vegas Grand Prix. 
NITRO‚Ñ¢, one of the best foam technologies in the industry, is at the core of our successful return to 
performance running and we will continue to invest significant resources into these performance products. 
PUMA has a long-term vision for the running category, with a pipeline of innovations going beyond the next 
four or five years.  
NITRO‚Ñ¢ foam maximizes responsiveness and cushioning while being extremely lightweight, and while it 
was created as part of our performance running line up, it is also used in other categories, for example in 
basketball.  
PUMA has set up state of the art testing facilities in Germany and the US for our elite athletes, called 
NITRO‚Ñ¢ LAB, which can gather full-body insights to develop bespoke and customised products, so they can 
perform at their best. 
NITRO‚Ñ¢ is used in our award-winning running styles Deviate, Velocity and the latest addition ForeverRun. 
With these three styles, we have a clear product proposition for our consumers. 
Women have been a priority for PUMA for many years, and we are doubling down on our commitment to 
make the best products for her, whether it is female-specific fits for our footwear or other products 
specifically catering to the needs of women.  
We take her serious throughout our performance categories, for example in football, where following two 
years of research, PUMA is the only sports brand to offer all football boots in fits that are specifically 
developed for female feet, with a lower volume in the midfoot and a smaller instep compared to unisex 
sizes. More than 90% of PUMA‚Äôs professional female players choose their boots in women‚Äôs specific fits, 
which shows the real demand for such products.  
‚îî 
While PUMA is not afraid to combine performance and non-performance, our goal is not to be a fashion 
brand but make sports on trend. 
We will continue to create products for her and communicate to our female consumers through campaigns 
with our global ambassadors such as Rihanna and Dua Lipa, and Pamela Reif. 
Another clear area of product excellence is to create franchises as brands with well-defined consumer 
benefits such as Deviate, Velocity and ForeverRun in running, FUTURE, ULTRA, and KING in football as well 
as All-Pro and MB in basketball. In non-performance categories, we also see the opportunity to establish 
strong product franchises such as Suede, and Palermo on the Classics side or RS-X and Mostro on the 
Progressive side. Going forward, we will continue to focus on these key products and ensure a long-term 
strategy across all our categories. 
We have set up local creation centres in major markets such as the US, Europe, China, India, or Japan so 
they can design the products that best resonate with local consumers and we are active in regionally 
relevant sports such as cricket, handball, rugby, or netball. We believe that this glocal approach to product 
creation combining global Business Units and local creation centres ensures the perfect balance of global 
reach and consistency and local relevance of our products.

Research and product development at PUMA mainly comprise the areas of innovation (new technologies), 
product design and model and collection development. The research and product development activities 
range from the analysis of scientific studies and customer surveys through the generation of creative ideas 
to the implementation of innovations in commercial products. The activities in research and product 
development are directly linked to sourcing activities. 
As of 31 December 2023, a total of 1,406 people were employed in research and development/ product 
management (previous year: 1,307). In 2023, research and development/ product management expenses 
totalled ‚Ç¨ 171.5 million (previous year: ‚Ç¨ 153.1 million), of which ‚Ç¨ 89.0 million (previous year: ‚Ç¨ 82.2 million) 
related to research and development.

SOURCING 
 
THE SOURCING ORGANISATION 
PUMA Group‚Äôs sourcing functions, referred to as PUMA Group Sourcing (PGS), manages all sourcing related 
activities for PUMA and Cobra, including supplier selection, product development, price negotiation and 
production control. These activities are centrally managed by PUMA International Trading GmbH (PIT), the 
group‚Äôs global trading entity, with its head office in the Corporate headquarters in Herzogenaurach 
(Germany). In addition, PIT is responsible for procurement and supply into the PUMA distribution channels 
worldwide. PIT receives volume forecasts from PUMA subsidiaries and licensees worldwide, translates 
these forecasts into production plans which are subsequently distributed to the third-party vendors. The 
PUMA subsidiaries confirm their forecasts into purchase orders to PIT, which in turn consolidates these 
requirements and purchases from the vendors. There is a clear buy/sell relationship between the sales-
subsidiaries and PIT and between PIT and the vendors, for added transparency. 
The centralisation of the sourcing and procurement functions supported by a cloud-based purchase order 
management and payment platform has enabled the digitalisation of the supply chain creating 
transparency, operational efficiency and reducing complexity. For example, container fill rates are 
optimised, foreign currency risks are managed by PIT directly via a centralised currency hedging policy, and 
all payments to vendors are automated and paper free.  
To meet the needs of our customers in terms of service, quality, social and environmental sustainability, we 
focus on six core strategic pillars: partnership, product quality, growth management, margins, acquisition 
costs and sustainability. The integration of PUMA's sustainability function into the sourcing organisation 
ensures that industry standards, including social, environmental, chemical safety, as well as product 
compliance are closely integrated with all our sourcing activities. 
Another key aspect in our sourcing setup since 2016 has been the PUMA Forever Better Vendor Financing 
Program. The program allows suppliers to be paid earlier. The International Finance Corporation (IFC), 
banking group BNP Paribas, HSBC and Standard Chartered offer attractive financing terms to our suppliers, 
allowing them to maintain their own lines of credit. 
In 2023, no sourcing countries experienced material COVID restrictions. The lifting of restrictions enabled 
full normalisation of the supply chain to pre-pandemic levels. 
High inflation, fluctuating raw material cost and freight cost impacted the company's operations. In view of 
the global macroeconomic situation, which has led to a change in customers' ordering behavior and 
increased inventory levels resulted in a need for more cautious procurement from our suppliers. Hence, we 
actively adjusted sourcing activities respectively and continued to provide transparency to our sourcing 
partners so they can adjust their capacities accordingly. Despite these challenges, we remained committed 
to delivering value to our stakeholders and implemented strategies to mitigate the adverse effects of the 
prevailing market conditions. Together with sustained demand for PUMA products in 2023 this led to a 
further normalisation of PUMA inventory levels, in line with expectations. 
Our supplier partners form an integral part of the PUMA business. To recognise our suppliers, we organised 
a Supplier Summit in June 2023 at PUMA Headquarters in Herzogenaurach, bringing them together across 
all divisions for the first time in over six years. During the Summit, we shared recent and upcoming 
business developments and expressed gratitude for their partnership with PUMA.

THE SOURCING MARKETS  
During the financial year 2023, PIT purchased from 158 independent suppliers (previous year: 141) in 29 
countries worldwide. The strategic cooperation with long-term partners continues to be one of our key 
competitive advantages and was crucial in navigating through ongoing supply chain challenges of 2023.  
Asia is the strongest sourcing region overall with 95% of the total volume, followed by the Americas with 3% 
and EMEA with 2% (thereof Europe with 1% and Africa with 1%). 
As a result, the six most important sourcing countries (94% of the total volume) are all located in the Asian 
continent. China is the biggest production country in 2023 with a total of 32%. While the absolute volumes in 
China for apparel have decreased, it was further strengthened as a strategic origin for footwear in 2023. 
Vietnam ‚Äì a key development and sourcing hub for all three divisions ‚Äì is the second biggest production 
country with 30%. Cambodia is in third place at 13%, Bangladesh, which focusses on apparel, is in fourth 
place at 12%. Indonesia, with an initial focus on footwear production and increasing volumes for apparel, 
produces 4% of the total volume and is in fifth place. India ‚Äì only serving the local market - is in sixth place 
at 3%. In the growth market of India, we see ourselves in a good competitive position due to local sourcing 
and are therefore also able to limit the impact of the government's protectionist measures on our business. 
Rising wage costs, fluctuating material prices, macroeconomic developments and evolving sustainability 
regulations, have continued to influence sourcing markets in 2023. Such impacts need to be considered in 
allocating the production to ensure a secure, sustainable, and competitive sourcing of products. In this 
regard sourcing continues to extend its local supply chain initiatives for markets such as China, India, Latin 
America, T√ºrkye and others. Our sourcing activities resumed with business travel to key sourcing markets 
in order to visit our existing partners but also evaluate new vendors and opportunities in sourcing countries 
such as Indonesia.

TALENT RECRUITMENT AND DEVELOPMENT 
‚îå  
Our PUMA family is the key to our success. Our human resources strategy forms the basis of our unique 
working environment and corporate culture. These help us to attract the best talent worldwide and secure 
the future success of the company. The three core elements of this strategy are "People First", sustainable 
human resources practices and digitalisation. 
People First means understanding employees' needs, values, and potential and putting them at the centre 
of our decision making. It helps us create an inclusive culture that respects diversity, promotes health and 
well-being, and encourages personal and professional growth. 
Sustainable people practises create a workplace culture that prioritises employee health and happiness, 
diversity, and inclusivity, and offers ample opportunities for career growth. Our sustainable people practices 
are central to building a resilient organisation. By thinking ahead and equipping our employees with the 
future skills and leadership qualities necessary, we ensure the long-term success of PUMA. 
Digital tools in Human Resources improve the work experience of our employees and help us stay 
competitive and agile in a fast-changing business landscape. By using digital technology, we are improving 
efficiency, data-driven decision-making, and candidate and employee experiences. We deploy easy-to-use 
digital tools that enhance collaboration and productivity and offer digital literacy programmes to ensure all 
employees are equipped to thrive in a digital environment.  
‚îî 
To attract external applicants, we use digital platforms and social media in addition to our careers website 
in order to pursue proactive recruitment strategies that are tailored to our specific target groups. Having a 
range of on-site and online initiatives at universities both in Germany and abroad creates opportunities to 
approach potential employees and identify suitable candidates. Our extensive networks and applicant pools 
enable us to fill vacancies quickly. In a competitive labour market, it's essential for us not only to present 
ourselves as an attractive employer, but to be viewed as such by our current and potential employees. 
PUMA's attractiveness is evidenced by its top rankings as an employer and numerous awards. We are very 
proud that 24 of our PUMA subsidiaries across the regions (Europe, APAC, LATAM and North America) won a 
coveted Top Employer award in the year under review in recognition of our outstanding corporate culture 
and working environment. We can therefore continue to call ourselves a "Global Top Employer". We were 
also named one of the "World's Best Employers" by Forbes and a "Leader in Diversity" by the Financial 
Times, and awarded the "Great Place to Work" seal in numerous countries. 
‚îå  
In 2023 we continued to work on simplifying, accelerating and harmonising our business processes 
worldwide, and intensified the digitalisation of our processes. We have been using the "Workday" software 
solution for a wide range of HR workflows since 2017. This gives our employees and managers the processes 
and tools they need to make everyday human resources management efficient. Furthermore, easy-to-use 
dashboards provide managers with important information and data-driven insights that are essential to 
their planning work and managerial duties. Analysing our centralised, globally available data provides a 
solid foundation for making strategic decisions and delivers measurable results. Our objective is to use this 
digitalised infrastructure to increase operational efficiency and continuously improve our HR practices 
throughout the employee life cycle at PUMA. This in turn facilitates PUMA's overarching goal of optimising 
workflows and employees' experiences. It also gives us the means to deal more effectively with the 
dynamics of demanding labour markets. 
We empower our employees to shape their own career paths proactively and independently, promoting their 
professional development both within Germany and internationally. This is how we succeed in inspiring their 
loyalty to the company in the long term. As part of our talent management initiative, we use Workday not 
only to assess performance and set targets, but also to make systematic and forward-looking succession 
plans for key positions. We identify talent within the company during annual performance reviews and global 


PUMA Annual Report 2023

talent conferences, and foster their development through tailored development plans. This approach to 
talent management opens up attractive career and development opportunities for our employees. As in the 
previous financial year, this year we were again able to fill the majority of key positions worldwide via 
internal promotions or horizontal moves, which confirms that our talent management and employee 
development strategy is solid. 
The ongoing personal and professional development of our employees is crucial to ensuring that our team 
has the skills they need to guarantee us continuous growth and market competence, particularly in times of 
great uncertainty and change. Workday helps us to avoid skills shortages and maintain a clear overview of 
the existing competencies in our team. In 2023 we examined this issue more closely, delving deeper in 
particular into the competencies that we will need in the future. The insights we gained from this deep dive 
are essential for us in terms of strategic human resources planning. They form the basis for our 
recruitment activities and for the development of new training programmes. 
The range of training that we provide includes a number of online and offline training courses and 
workshops, which are either standardised or tailored to individual needs. With "LinkedIn Learning" and "Good 
Habitz", there are now over 23,000 different training courses available for our employees. They also have a 
wide range of learning categories to choose from for self-directed personal and professional development. 
Like last year, we focused particularly on the topics of mental well-being, resilience and mindfulness this 
year, providing our employees with a wide range of services to best support them in dealing with the 
increased mental strain that can often arise in this politically and economically difficult environment.  
We have a proactive strategy for engaging learners. This includes putting on entertaining activities about 
various topics, gamification and internal learning competitions, not to mention the quarterly Top Learner 
Award for the most active learners worldwide. Thanks to this approach, PUMA was nominated for the 
"eLearning Journal" Award 2024 in the "Learner Engagement" category. We further expanded the Digital 
Agile Coach programmes that we offer to various target groups.   
We have a global Busuu licence that provides access to 13 languages. This enables all our employees, 
including retail staff, to learn new languages online in a flexible way that meets their needs. They are 
supported by live lessons with qualified trainers. Learning is undertaken both via an app and in direct 
contact with others. There is a particular focus on English, but Busuu also facilitates the learning of other 
languages for personal or professional purposes. 
With a range of dual-study programmes and apprenticeships, as well as study-related internships, we offer 
adequate entry-level and development opportunities for talented individuals at all levels.  
We offer our managers numerous training and development opportunities. All managers worldwide 
complete our internal global leadership training programme, consisting of the ILP (International Leadership 
Programme) and ILP¬≤ seminar series. The programme ensures a uniform understanding of leadership at 
PUMA and promotes development among participants over the longer term. It offers intensive training and 
coaching, including interactive learning, role play simulations, and best practice learning, as well as joint 
projects. The key topics include coaching, mindful leadership, and agile working methods. The PUMA 
Leadership Expedition training programme aims to empower our managers to lead effectively in the VUCA 
world (VUCA is an acronym for volatile, uncertain, complex, and ambivalent). The programme is completely 
virtual, easily accessible, and designed as a self-directed and tailor-made learning format. It includes self-
selected virtual training sessions with a trainer, regular communication with other international 
participants in smaller working groups, and coached sessions, as well as individual learning sprints and 
check-ins with the trainers. This innovative training programme received the eLearning AWARD 2023 in the 
"Agile Learning" category. 
Our training from employee to manager is intended to prepare employees who are taking on a management 
position for the first time specifically for their new role. In addition to the training module, the programme 
also offers individual coaching.

Our "Speed Up" and "Speed Up¬≤" development programmes are aimed at employees across different levels 
of the organisation. These programmes help to fully prepare employees for the next stage of their career, 
covering interdisciplinary projects and deployments, targeted training, mentoring, coaching and job 
rotations. They are designed to actively promote selected top talent. Another essential aspect of these 
programmes is increasing the visibility of participants through to the highest level of management, 
promoting multi-disciplinary cooperation and developing a strong professional network. 
Feedback from our employees is of the utmost importance to us. Our listening strategy comprises various 
methods of receiving feedback and aims to capture and understand the opinions and needs of our workforce. 
To gather their views and suggestions, we prepare questionnaires, regular short surveys, focus groups, 
interviews and mood analyses, often using systems such as Amber and Workday. The resulting feedback 
affirms our commitment to continuing and further developing the initiatives that have been launched. 
Since 2009 we have been conducting regular global employee surveys to obtain feedback from our staff on a 
variety of topics and to measure their engagement. A total of 15,339 employees took part in the global survey 
we carried out in 2023 and took the opportunity to tell us what they think about their workplace and their 
day-to-day work. This equates to a participation rate of 85% (2021: 86%). We saw an increase in positive 
ratings in two categories. Four categories remained at their already high level and seven categories saw a 
slight decline of 1% compared to the previous survey. We compare our survey results with various sets of 
market data, including high-performance data that we surpass or are equal to in up to four categories. 
High-performing companies are those that outperform the market in financial terms and regularly achieve 
excellent employee survey results. This positive feedback encourages us to continue and strengthen the 
measures we have already introduced. The survey results were communicated at global, local and 
departmental level, and follow-up measures were defined. 
WORKS COUNCIL 
Our trust-based, constructive collaboration with the Works Councils is an important part of our corporate 
culture. In 2023, the European Works Council of PUMA SE represented employees from 14 European 
countries and had 18 members. The German Works Council of PUMA SE consisted of 17 members and 
represented the employees of the PUMA Group in Germany. A designated member of the Works Council in 
Germany represents the interests of employees with disabilities. 
COMPENSATION 
We at PUMA offer our employees a targeted and competitive compensation system, which consists of 
several components. In addition to a fixed base salary, the PUMA bonus system, profit-sharing programmes, 
and various social benefits form part of an attractive and performance-based compensation system. In 
addition, we offer our employees comprehensive services in the areas of further development, employee 
motivation, health management, and well-being. We also offer long-term incentive programmes for the 
senior management level that honour the sustainable development and performance of the business. The 
bonus system is transparent and globally standardised. Incentives are exclusively linked to company goals.  
‚îî 
MANAGEMENT SYSTEM 
We use a variety of indicators to manage our performance in relation to our top corporate goals. We have 
defined growth and profitability as key targets within finance-related areas. Our focus therefore is on 
improving our sales and operating result (EBIT). These are the most significant financial performance 
indicators. Moreover, we aim to minimise working capital and improve free cash flow. Our Group's Planning 
and Management System has been designed to provide a variety of instruments in order to assess current 
business developments and derive future strategy and investment decisions. This involves the continuous 
monitoring of key financial indicators within the PUMA Group and a monthly comparison with budget 
targets. Any deviations from the targets are analysed in detail and appropriate countermeasures are taken 
in the event such deviations have a negative impact.

Changes in sales are also influenced by currency exchange effects. This is why we also state any changes 
in sales in euros, the reporting currency, adjusted for currency exchange effects in order to provide 
information that is relevant to the decision-making process when assessing the revenue position. Currency-
adjusted sales are used for comparison purposes and are based on the values that would arise if the foreign 
currencies included in the consolidated financial statements were not converted at the average rates for the 
previous year, but were instead translated at the corresponding average rates for the current year. In the 
case of countries that are in a hyperinflationary environment, the previous year's amounts are not converted 
at the reporting date rates of the previous year, but at those of the current reporting year. As a result, 
currency-adjusted figures are not to be regarded as a substitute or as superior financial indicators, but 
should instead always be regarded as additional information. 
We use the indicator free cash flow in order to determine the change in cash and cash equivalents after 
deducting all expenses incurred to maintain or expand the organic business of the PUMA Group. Free cash 
flow is calculated from the cash flow from operating activities and investment activities. We also use the 
indicator free cash flow before acquisitions, which goes beyond free cash flow and includes an adjustment 
for incoming and outgoing payments that are associated with shareholdings. 
We use the indicator working capital in order to assess the financial position. Working capital is essentially 
the difference between current assets ‚Äì including in particular inventories and trade receivables ‚Äì and 
current liabilities. Cash and cash equivalents, the positive and negative market values of derivative financial 
instruments and current finance and lease liabilities are not included in working capital. 
Besides the above mentioned significant indicators, sustainability and creating stakeholder value is an 
important aspect of PUMA‚Äôs overall business performance. Acting in a responsible manner and continuously 
improving PUMAs impacts on the environment and people are not only expected by our employees, 
consumers and investors but also supports our financial performance. Since many years, and in line with 
our current 10FOR25 sustainability strategy, we use several indicators to assess PUMA‚Äôs performance 
against environmental and social criteria. Those indicators relate to climate action, human rights (including 
occupational health and safety) as well as circularity and are part of the performance bonus of our 
leadership team globally. Since a large portion of PUMAs impact on the environment and people is created 
in our supply chain, we also include supply chain specific sustainability performance indicators in our 
annual reporting. For further details, please refer to the sustainability section of this report and our 
corporate website. 
The calculation of the financial control parameters that PUMA uses is defined as follows: 
The recognition of sales is based on the provisions of IFRS 15 Revenue from contracts with customers. 
PUMA's gross profit is calculated as sales minus cost of sales. Cost of sales mainly comprise the carrying 
amounts of inventory that were recognised as expenses during the reporting period. The gross profit margin 
is calculated as gross profit divided by sales.  
PUMA's operating result (EBIT) is the sum of sales and royalty and commission income, minus cost of sales 
and other operating income and expenses (OPEX). EBIT is defined as operating result, less depreciation and 
amortisation, provisions and impairment loss, before interest (= financial result) and before taxes. The 
financial result includes interest income and interest expenses, currency conversion differences and the 
effects from the net position of monetary items in connection with hyperinflation accounting. The EBIT 
margin is calculated as EBIT divided by sales. 
PUMA's working capital is calculated based on the sum of current assets less the sum of current liabilities. 
In addition, cash and cash equivalents and positive and negative market values of derivative financial 
instruments are deducted. The market values of derivative financial instruments are recognised in the 
balance sheet in the items Other Current Assets and Other Current Liabilities not attributable to working 
capital. Current financial and lease liabilities are also not part of working capital.

‚Üó Combined Management Report 
227 
We also use the EBITDA indicator, which represents the operating result before interest (= financial result), 
taxes and depreciation and amortisation, to assess the results of operations. EBITDA is calculated based on 
the operating result (EBIT) adding depreciation and amortisation, which may also contain any incurred im-
pairment expenses relating to non-current assets. The EBITDA margin is calculated as EBITDA divided by 
sales. 
 
INFORMATION REGARDING THE NON-FINANCIAL REPORT 
In accordance with Sections 289b and 315b of the German Commercial Code (Handelsgesetzbuch ‚Äì HGB), 
we are required to make a non-financial declaration for PUMA SE and the PUMA Group within the combined 
management report or present a non-financial report external to the combined management report, in 
which we report on environmental, social and other non-financial aspects. PUMA has been publishing 
sustainability reports since 2003 under the provisions of the Global Reporting Initiative (GRI) and since 2010 
has published financial data and key sustainability indicators in a single report. In this context, we report the 
information required under Sections 289b and 315b of the HGB in the sustainability chapter of our annual 
report. The non-financial report for the financial year 2023 is published together with the combined 
management report and can be accessed at the following location on our website:

ECONOMIC REPORT 
GENERAL ECONOMIC CONDITIONS 
 
GLOBAL ECONOMY 
According to the winter forecast of the Kiel Institute for the World Economy (Kiel Institut f√ºr Weltwirtschaft ‚Äì 
IfW Kiel) dated 13 December 2023, the global economy held up better than expected in view of the inflation 
shock and the massive tightening of monetary policy in 2023, even if economic expansion was only 
moderate. Industrial production and world trade remained without momentum until the end of the year. The 
experts at IfW Kiel expect global gross domestic product (GDP) to have risen by a total of 3.1% for the past 
financial year 2023. Major differences in economic momentum were recorded both in the advanced 
economies and in the emerging markets. With regard to China, IfW Kiel experts note that, by historical 
comparison, the pace of expansion is still low and that China has largely lost its role as the engine of global 
economic expansion. In addition, accelerated inflation in Argentina and Turkey had a negative impact on 
economic development.  
SPORTING GOODS INDUSTRY 
The sporting goods industry was faced with various challenges in 2023, which contributed to a difficult 
market environment. This was mainly due to the sharp rise in inflation, which led to a corresponding 
negative impact on consumer spending. In addition, excess inventory and sales-promoting measures were 
unfavourable to industry development. 
Major sporting events in 2023, such as the Athletics World Championships in Hungary and the FIFA Women's 
World Cup in Australia and New Zealand, had a positive effect on the sporting goods industry. To our 
knowledge, sporting activity and the pursuit of an increasingly healthy and sustainable lifestyle continued to 
gain in importance for an ever-increasing proportion of the world's population, following the COVID-19 
pandemic. Among other things, this resulted in the increased popularity of athletic footwear and 
leisure/athletic apparel as an integral part of everyday fashion ("athleisure").

SALES DEVELOPMENT 
 
ILLUSTRATION OF SALES DEVELOPMENT IN 2023 COMPARED TO THE OUTLOOK 
In its combined management report for 2022, PUMA forecast a currency-adjusted increase in sales in the 
high single-digit percentage range for financial year 2023. Sales development was affected by the significant 
devaluation of the Argentine peso and the associated translation effects at the closing rate, which had an 
extraordinary impact in the fourth quarter and on the full-year 2023. Due to the extent and timing of these 
currency effects, we were unable to fully compensate for the overall negative impact at the end of the year. 
Nevertheless, sales development was largely in line with the outlook. More details on sales development in 
the financial year 2023 are provided below. 
SALES 
PUMA's sales in the reporting currency, the euro, increased by 1.6% to ‚Ç¨ 8,601.7 million in the financial year 
2023 (previous year: ‚Ç¨ 8,465.1 million). Currency-adjusted sales increased by 6.6%. This allowed PUMA to 
achieve record sales of ‚Ç¨ 8.6 billion in 2023, the year of the 75th anniversary of the company, despite the 
difficult market environment. 
 
‚Üó G.05 SALES (‚Ç¨ million)  
 
In the footwear division, sales increased in the reporting currency, the euro, by 6.1% to ‚Ç¨ 4,583.4 million. 
Currency-adjusted sales increased by 12.4%. The footwear division continued to be the growth driver and the 
strongest growth was achieved in the Sportstyle, Teamsport and Basketball categories. The share of the 
footwear division in total sales rose from 51.0% in the previous year to 53.3% in 2023. 
Sales in the apparel division fell by 4.6% to ‚Ç¨ 2,763.0 million in the reporting currency, the euro. Adjusted for 
currency effects, sales fell only slightly by 0.3%. Higher sales in the categories Teamsport and Running & 
Training were compared to lower sales in the Sportstyle and Motorsport categories. The share of the 
apparel division decreased to 32.1% of Group sales (previous year: 34.2%). 
The accessories division reported an increase in sales in the reporting currency, the euro, of 0.3% to 
‚Ç¨ 1,255.3 million. This corresponds to a currency-adjusted sales growth of 3.1%. The growth in the 
Teamsport category was partly offset by slightly lower sales with Cobra golf clubs. In 2023, the share of the 
accessories division decreased to 14.6% of Group sales from 14.8% in the previous year.

OWN RETAIL ACTIVITIES 
PUMA's own retail activities include direct sales to our consumers ("Direct-to-consumer business"). This 
includes selling to our customers in PUMA's own retail stores, the so-called "Full Price Stores" and 
"Factory Outlets". Our e-commerce business on our own online platforms and on the platforms of online 
retailers, which we refer to as "marketplaces", is also part of the direct sales to our consumers. Our own 
retail businesses ensure regional availability of PUMA products and the presentation of the PUMA brand in 
an environment suitable to our brand positioning.  
PUMA's direct-to-consumer sales increased by 17.5% currency-adjusted to ‚Ç¨ 2,133.0 million in the financial 
year 2023. This corresponds to a share of 24.8% of total sales (previous year: 23.1%). Adjusted for currency 
effects, sales in PUMA's own full-price stores and factory outlets increased by 18.8% in 2023. In the e-
commerce business, sales increased by 15.0% in 2023, adjusted for currency effects. The continued strong 
sales growth in our DTC business was due to continued brand desirability, the opening of own retail stores 
and their increase in productivity.

LICENSING BUSINESS 
PUMA grants licenses to independent partners for various product divisions, such as watches, glasses, 
safety shoes, workwear and gaming accessories. In addition to design, development and manufacture, these 
companies are also responsible for product distribution. Income from license agreements also includes 
some distribution licenses for different markets. PUMA's royalty and commission income increased by 
14.0% to ‚Ç¨ 38.5 million in the financial year 2023 (previous year: ‚Ç¨ 33.8 million). The main reason for the 
increase was the granting of new licences in the golf and accessories segment. 
REGIONAL DEVELOPMENT 
In the following explanation of the regional development of sales, the sales are allocated to the customers' 
actual region ("customer site"). It is divided into three geographical regions (EMEA, Americas and 
Asia/Pacific).  
PUMA's sales in the reporting currency, the euro, increased by 1.6% in the financial year 2023. This 
corresponds to a currency-adjusted sales increase of 6.6% compared to the previous year. This currency-
adjusted growth resulted in particular from good sales performance in the EMEA and Asia/Pacific regions, 
which both achieved double-digit growth rates. In contrast, the Americas region recorded a slight decrease 
in sales. 
In the EMEA region, sales in the reporting currency, the euro, rose by 9.8% to ‚Ç¨ 3,418.4 million. Adjusted for 
currency effects, this corresponds to an increase in sales of 13.4%. Almost all countries in the region, with 
the exception of Great Britain and Sweden, contributed to this development with sales growth. Particularly 
strong growth came from Germany, Spain, Italy and Turkey. In terms of Group sales, the EMEA region's 
share rose from 36.8% in the previous year to 39.7% in 2023. 
With regard to product divisions, sales from footwear recorded a currency-adjusted increase of 21.7%. 
Currency-adjusted sales of apparel increased by 8.2%. Currency-adjusted sales of accessories rose by 2.5%.

In the Americas region, sales in the reporting currency, the euro, decreased by 8.0% to ‚Ç¨ 3,389.9 million. The 
decline in sales in the reporting currency was impacted by negative exchange rate effects due to the strong 
devaluation of the Argentine peso against the euro. Currency-adjusted sales decreased by 2.4%. The 
currency-adjusted sales decline was mainly due to a difficult macroeconomic environment, high inventory 
levels in the trade and PUMA's relative dependence on the off-price wholesale business in the USA. The 
Americas region's share of Group sales decreased from 43.5% in the previous year to 39.4% in 2023. 
In terms of product divisions, both footwear (+1.5% currency-adjusted) and accessories (+4.8% currency-
adjusted) recorded sales growth compared to the previous year. In contrast, currency-adjusted sales in the 
apparel division fell by 13.3%.

In the Asia/Pacific region, sales in the reporting currency, the euro, rose by 7.7% to ‚Ç¨ 1,793.4 million. Adjusted

among others, recorded double-digit sales growth, sales declined in South Korea and Australia. The share of 
the Asia/Pacific region in Group sales increased from 19.7% in the previous year to 20.8% in 2023. 
In terms of product divisions, both footwear (+22.6% currency-adjusted) and apparel (+5.9% currency-

ILLUSTRATION OF EARNINGS DEVELOPMENT IN 2023 COMPARED TO THE OUTLOOK 
In the outlook in the combined management report for 2022, PUMA forecast an operating result (EBIT) in the 
range between ‚Ç¨ 590 million and ‚Ç¨ 670 million for the financial year 2023 (2022: ‚Ç¨ 641 million). Thanks to 
continued strong brand momentum, exciting product launches, strong partnerships along the value chain, 
and supported by our operational flexibility, PUMA was able to fully achieve its forecast for operating result 
for the full-year 2023, despite the significant devaluation of the Argentine peso. 
More details on earnings development in the financial year under review are provided below. 
GROSS PROFIT MARGIN  
PUMA's gross profit in the financial year 2023 increased by 2.1% from ‚Ç¨ 3,902.7 million to ‚Ç¨ 3,986.6 million. 
The gross profit margin improved by 20 basis points from 46.1% to 46.3%. The increase was due to price 
adjustments, a more favourable regional and distribution channel mix, and positive currency effects. In 
contrast, a discount-intensive market environment with higher sales-promoting measures, fluctuating 
sourcing prices due to raw materials and fluctuating freight costs had a negative effect. 
The gross profit margin in the footwear division improved from 44.9% in the previous year to 45.4% in 2023. 
The gross profit margin for apparel increased from 47.3% to 47.8%. In contrast, the gross profit margin for 
accessories fell from 47.4% to 46.6%.

OTHER OPERATING INCOME AND EXPENSES 
The net expense of other operating income and expenses (OPEX) increased by 3.3% in financial year 2023 to 
‚Ç¨ 3,403.5 million (from ‚Ç¨ 3,295.9 million in the previous year). The increase is due to sales-related 
distribution and other variable costs, the strong growth in our DTC sales channel and higher marketing 
investments. This development was partially offset by operational leverage in other cost areas and 
favourable exchange rate effects. The cost ratio increased from 38.9% in the previous year to 39.6% in 2023. 
‚Üó G.12 OPERATING EXPENSES (as a % of sales) 
 
Within selling expenses, marketing/retail expenses increased by 4.1% to ‚Ç¨ 1,643.2 million, while the cost 
ratio was 19.1% of sales in 2023, compared with a cost ratio of 18.6% in the previous year. Other selling 
expenses, which mainly include sales-related costs and costs for warehousing and logistics, increased by 
5.2% to ‚Ç¨ 1,155.8 million. The cost ratio of other selling expenses decreased to 13.4% of sales in 2023 
compared to a cost ratio of 13.0% in the previous year. 
Research and development/product management expenses increased by 12.0% to ‚Ç¨ 171.5 million compared 
to the previous year and the cost ratio rose slightly to 2.0%. Other operating income amounted to 
‚Ç¨ 17.8 million in the past financial year and essentially includes income from the sale of fixed assets and 
income from the disposal of finance leases. General and administrative expenses fell by 3.2% to 
‚Ç¨ 450.9 million in 2023. The cost ratio of general and administrative expenses improved to 5.2% of sales in 
2023. Depreciation and amortisation is included in the relevant costs and total ‚Ç¨ 351.7 million (previous year: 
‚Ç¨ 332.8 million). In addition, the respective costs include impairment expenses totalling ‚Ç¨ 5.7 million and 
corresponding reversals of impairment losses in the amount of ‚Ç¨ 11.9 million.

RESULT BEFORE INTEREST, TAXES, DEPRECIATION AND AMORTISATION (EBITDA) 
The result before interest (= financial result), taxes, depreciation and amortisation (including impairment 
losses and reversals of impairment losses) (EBITDA) decreased by 3.2% to ‚Ç¨ 967.1 million in financial year 
2023 (from ‚Ç¨ 999.3 million in the previous year). The EBITDA margin decreased from 11.8% in the previous 
year to 11.2% in 2023. 
OPERATING RESULT (EBIT) 
In the 2023 financial year, operating result decreased by 3.0% to ‚Ç¨ 621.6 million (from ‚Ç¨ 640.6 million in the 
previous year). Despite higher sales and an improved gross profit margin, the slightly stronger increase in 
other operating income and expenses in comparison with sales led to this decline. The EBIT margin 
decreased from 7.6% in the previous year to 7.2% in 2023. 
‚Üó G.13 OPERATING RESULT 
 
 
FINANCIAL RESULT 
The financial result in 2023 decreased from a total of ‚Ç¨ -88.9 million in the previous year to ‚Ç¨ -143.3 million. 
This development is mainly due to the sharp increase in expenses from currency conversion differences 
totalling ‚Ç¨ -69.4 million in 2023, compared to just ‚Ç¨ - 2.2 million in the previous year, and also includes 
valuation losses in connection with the devaluation of the Argentine peso. The increase in interest expenses 
in 2023 to a total of ‚Ç¨ -100.8 million (previous year: ‚Ç¨ - 54.4 million) also contributed significantly to this 
development. In contrast, interest income increased to a total of ‚Ç¨ 37.8 million in 2023 (previous year: 
‚Ç¨ 32.3 million) and expenses from hyperinflation effects fell to ‚Ç¨ - 23.7 million (previous year:  
‚Ç¨ - 27.8 million). The remaining other financial income and expenses, which in particular include interest 
components in connection with forward exchange contracts ("swap points"), improved to ‚Ç¨ 12.8 million 
compared to ‚Ç¨ - 36.8 million in the previous year. 
EARNINGS BEFORE TAXES (EBT) 
In the financial year 2023, PUMA generated earnings before taxes of ‚Ç¨ 478.3 million. This corresponds to a 
decrease of 13.3% compared to the previous year (‚Ç¨ 551.7 million). Tax expenses decreased to ‚Ç¨ 117.8 million, 
compared to ‚Ç¨ 127.4 million in the previous year. Accordingly, the tax rate rose from 23.1% to 24.6% in 2023.

NET EARNINGS ATTRIBUTABLE TO NON-CONTROLLING INTERESTS  
Net earnings attributable to non-controlling interests relate to companies in the North American market, in 
each of which the same shareholder holds a minority stake. The earnings attributable to these interests 
decreased by 21.4% to ‚Ç¨ 55.7 million in the financial year 2023 (previous year: ‚Ç¨ 70.9 million). The companies 
affected are PUMA United North America LLC, PUMA United Aviation North America LLC, PUMA United 
Canada ULC and Janed Canada LLC. The business purpose of these companies is mainly the sale of socks, 
bodywear, accessories and children's apparel in the North American market. 
CONSOLIDATED NET INCOME 
Consolidated net income decreased by 13.7% in financial year 2023 to ‚Ç¨ 304.9 million (from ‚Ç¨ 353.5 million). 
Despite higher sales and an improved gross profit margin, the slightly stronger increase in other operating 
income and expenses compared to sales and the declining financial result led to this development.  
Earnings per share and diluted earnings per share decreased from ‚Ç¨ 2.36 in the previous year to ‚Ç¨ 2.03 in 
the financial year 2023, in line with the development of the consolidated net income.  
 
DEVELOPMENT OF THE SEGMENTS 
Internal management of the PUMA Group is carried out across seven segments (Europe, EEMEA, North 
America, Latin America, Greater China, Asia/Pacific (excluding Greater China) and stichd), based on the 
registered office of the respective subsidiaries. The differences from the presented regional development of 
sales are essentially down to the separated "stichd" segment and India and Southeast Asia, which are 
allocated to the EEMEA segment. 
The operating segments developed in line with the trends already discussed. Exceptions were the EEMEA 
segment, which showed double-digit growth rates due to the comparatively strong growth of sales and 
operating result in several countries and especially in Turkey. In the North America segment, the difficult 
macroeconomic environment, high inventory levels in the trade and the relative dependence on wholesale 
business in the off-price segment led to a decline in sales and operating result. In the Latin America 
segment, operating result was only at the previous year's level, despite double-digit sales growth in Mexico, 
Chile and Brazil. This was mainly due to the negative currency exchange effects resulting from the sharp 
devaluation of the Argentine peso, which had a strong impact on profitability in the Latin America segment. 
In the Greater China segment, double-digit sales growth and a significant improvement in operating result 
were achieved due to the continued recovery and re-opening of the market. The stichd segment recorded a 
decline in operating result due to start-up costs in the Formula 1 business and due to expenses in 
connection with the implementation of SAP in 2023.

DIVIDENDS 
The positive net income enables the Management Board and the Supervisory Board of PUMA SE to propose 
the distribution of a dividend of ‚Ç¨ 0.82 per share for the financial year 2023 at the Annual General Meeting on 
22 May 2024. This corresponds to a payout ratio of 40.3% of consolidated net income. The higher payout ratio 
results from the strong improvement in free cash flow and reflects the underlying positive operating 
business development. In general, PUMA's dividend policy continues to provide for a payout of 25% to 35% of 
consolidated net income. The payment of the dividend is to take place in the days after the Annual General 
Meeting at which the decision is made on the payout. In the previous year, a dividend of ‚Ç¨ 0.82 per share was 
paid out (payout ratio for previous year: 34.7%).

EQUITY RATIO  
PUMA has a very solid capital base. As of the balance sheet date, the equity of the PUMA Group increased by 
1.7%, from ‚Ç¨ 2,538.8 million in the previous year to ‚Ç¨ 2,582.3 million as of 31 December 2023. Although the 
positive consolidated income contributed to the increase in Group equity, there was a negative impact of  
‚Ç¨ - 85.9 million from the other comprehensive income that is directly recorded in equity, mainly due to 
negative currency conversion differences. The balance sheet total decreased slightly by 2.0% as at the 
balance sheet date, to ‚Ç¨ 6,640.4 million (from ‚Ç¨ 6,772.7 million in the previous year). Overall, this resulted in 
an increase in the equity ratio of 1.4 percentage points from 37.5% in the previous year to 38.9% as at  
31 December 2023.  
‚Üó G.15 BALANCE SHEET TOTAL/EQUITY RATIO 
 
 
WORKING CAPITAL  
As of the balance sheet date, working capital increased by 8.3% from ‚Ç¨ 1,086.8 million in the previous year to 
‚Ç¨ 1,177.3 million as of 31 December 2023. In relation to sales in the respective financial year, this corresponds 
to an increase in the working capital ratio from 12.8% in the previous year to 13.7% at the end of 2023. This 
development was mainly attributable to the decline of trade payables due to the adjusted sourcing volumes 
in 2023 and the decrease in other current liabilities and provisions included in working capital. In addition, 
higher trade receivables and higher other current assets attributable to working capital contributed to the 
increase. In contrast, the reduction in inventories had the opposite effect. 
On the assets side, inventories fell by 19.6% as at the balance sheet date, to ‚Ç¨ 1,804.4 million (from 
‚Ç¨ 2,245.1 million). This development shows that our previous measures to reduce inventories to an 
appropriate level were successful. Trade receivables increased due to longer customary payment terms by 
5.0% to ‚Ç¨ 1,118.4 million (from ‚Ç¨ 1,064.9 million) as at the balance sheet date. Other current assets, which are 
attributable to working capital rose by 26.8% to ‚Ç¨ 385.6 million (from ‚Ç¨ 304.1 million), primarily due to higher 
advance payments and tax refund claims.  
On the liabilities side, trade payables decreased by 13.6% to ‚Ç¨ 1,499.8 million (from ‚Ç¨ 1,734.9 million) due to 
the adjusted sourcing volumes. The other current liabilities and provisions, which are contained in working 
capital and include, among other things, customer bonus and warranty provisions, decreased by 20.3% to 
‚Ç¨ 631.3 million (from ‚Ç¨ 792.3 million).

OTHER ASSETS AND OTHER LIABILITIES 
Other current assets outside of working capital include, in particular, the positive market value of derivative 
financial instruments and current receivables from leases. Overall, other current assets outside of working 
capital decreased to ‚Ç¨ 69.8 million, compared to ‚Ç¨ 123.3 million in the previous year.  
Right-of-use assets fell slightly by 2.1% to ‚Ç¨ 1,087.7 million (from ‚Ç¨ 1,111.3 million in the previous year). The 
decline was due to the ongoing depreciation of right-of-use assets and the effects of subleasing. In contrast, 
the additions to right-of-use assets in 2023 were mainly related to newly opened retail stores and extensions 
or contract amendments to existing retail stores as well as the opening of new warehouses or the expansion 
of existing warehouses. The right-of-use assets referred to own retail stores totalling ‚Ç¨ 464.2 million 
(previous year: ‚Ç¨ 430.9 million), warehouses and offices totalling ‚Ç¨ 557.7 million (previous year: 
‚Ç¨ 613.1 million) and other lease items, mainly technical equipment and machines and motor vehicles, 
totalling ‚Ç¨ 65.7 million as of 31 December 2023 (previous year: ‚Ç¨ 67.3 million). The associated current and 
non-current leasing liabilities remained virtually unchanged overall. 
Other non-current assets, which mainly comprise intangible assets and property, plant and equipment, 
increased by 13.7% to ‚Ç¨ 1,325.6 million (from ‚Ç¨ 1,166.0 million) in the past financial year. The increase is 
linked to the expansion of investment activities in 2023, following lower investments in non-current assets in 
previous years. In addition, the acquisition of investment property totaling ‚Ç¨ 21.1 million contributed to the 
increase. 
As at 31 December 2023, current borrowings include the current proportion of promissory note loans in the 
amount of ‚Ç¨ 125.0 million (previous year: ‚Ç¨ 60.0 million) and short-term bank liabilities amounting to 
‚Ç¨ 20.9 million (previous year: ‚Ç¨ 15.9 million). 
Other current liabilities, which exclusively include the negative market value of derivative financial 
instruments, increased from ‚Ç¨ 39.7 million to ‚Ç¨ 47.7 million compared to the previous year.  
Non-current borrowings include promissory note loans totalling ‚Ç¨ 426.1 million (previous year: 
‚Ç¨ 251.5 million). 
Pension provisions remained almost unchanged at ‚Ç¨ 22.5 million (previous year: ‚Ç¨ 22.4 million).

NET CASH FROM OPERATING ACTIVITIES 
Gross cash flow increased by 4.9% to ‚Ç¨ 964.1 million in financial year 2023 (from ‚Ç¨ 918.9 million in the 
previous year). This development was due to the increase in non-cash adjustments relating to the financial 
result and other non-cash expenses and income by 32.3% to ‚Ç¨ 485.7 million. In contrast, earnings before 
taxes decreased by 13.3% to ‚Ç¨ 478.3 million.

‚Üó G.17 GROSS CASH FLOW (‚Ç¨ million) 
 
 
As a result of the smaller increase in working capital compared to the previous year, there was a lower cash 
outflow from the change in net working capital* of ‚Ç¨ - 129.2 million in financial year 2023, compared to a 
cash outflow of ‚Ç¨ - 343.3 million in the previous year. The cash outflow from payments for income taxes 
increased from ‚Ç¨ - 157.4 million in the previous year to ‚Ç¨ - 181.3 million in financial year 2023. On balance, 
due to the improvement in gross cash flow and the lower cash outflows in connection with working capital, 
there was a significant improvement in cash inflow from operating activities, which rose by 56.3% to 
‚Ç¨ 653.6 million (from ‚Ç¨ 418.3 million). 
NET CASH USED IN INVESTING ACTIVITIES 
In the financial year 2023, cash outflow from investment activities increased from a total of ‚Ç¨ 240.8 million to 
‚Ç¨ 284.6 million. The investments in fixed assets included in this figure increased from ‚Ç¨ 263.6 million in the 
previous year to ‚Ç¨ 300.4 million in 2023 in line with our investment planning. The increase mainly related to 
investments in our own retail stores, in our logistics infrastructure and in investment properties. In addition, 
investments in the modernisation of the IT infrastructure continued to be made. The increase in capital 
expenditures relates in particular to the North America and Latin America segments and the central area, 
which is not allocated to the business segments.

FREE CASH FLOW BEFORE ACQUISITIONS 
The free cash flow before acquisitions is the balance of the cash inflows and outflows from operating and 
investing activities. In addition, an adjustment is made for incoming and outgoing payments that relate to 
the purchase or sale of shareholdings, where applicable. No acquisitions or disposals of investments were 
made in 2022 and 2023. 
Free cash flow before acquisitions improved from ‚Ç¨ 177.5 million in the previous year to ‚Ç¨ 369.0 million in the

NET CASH USED IN FINANCING ACTIVITIES 
The net cash used in financing activities decreased overall from a cash outflow of ‚Ç¨ 476.4 million in the 
previous year to a cash outflow of ‚Ç¨ 277.1 million in 2023. The decline in cash outflow was mainly due to 
increased proceeds from taking on financial borrowings.  
A dividend payment of ‚Ç¨ 122.8 million was distributed to the shareholders of PUMA SE for the financial year 
2022. In the previous year, the dividend payment was ‚Ç¨ 107.7 million. The net cash used in financing activities 
also included payouts to non-controlling interests totalling ‚Ç¨ 92.4 million in 2023 (previous year: 
‚Ç¨ 73.3 million). Cash inflows from borrowings amounted to ‚Ç¨ 299.6 million, compared with cash inflows of 
‚Ç¨ 17.9 million in the previous year. In the financial year 2023, payments made for the repayment of financial 
borrowings totalled ‚Ç¨ 59.1 million (previous year: ‚Ç¨ 69.5 million). The cash outflows for the repayment of 
leasing liabilities and related interest expenses included in the cash outflow from financing activities 
increased from a total of ‚Ç¨ 228.7 million in the previous year to ‚Ç¨ 254.8 million in 2023. 
As of 31 December 2023, PUMA had cash and cash equivalents of ‚Ç¨ 552.9 million, an increase of 19.4% 
compared with the previous year (‚Ç¨ 463.1 million). The PUMA Group also had credit lines totalling 
‚Ç¨ 1,552.8 million as of 31 December 2023 (previous year: ‚Ç¨ 1,271.0 million). Unutilised credit lines amounted 
to ‚Ç¨ 986.1 million as at the balance sheet date, compared to ‚Ç¨ 943.7 million in the previous year.

STATEMENT REGARDING THE BUSINESS DEVELOPMENT AND THE OVERALL 
SITUATION OF THE GROUP  
In financial year 2023, we were confronted with an increasingly difficult geopolitical and macroeconomic 
market environment. The conflict in the Middle East, the war in Ukraine, persistent inflation and risks of 
recession had a negative impact on the consumer sentiment and led to volatile retail demand. We therefore 
considered 2023 to be a transitional year. In 2023, we continued to focus on overcoming the short-term 
challenges without compromising the medium and long-term success of PUMA. Accordingly, we prioritised 
sales growth and increasing market share over short-term profitability optimisation. Despite the difficult 
market environment, we were able to further increase PUMA's sales based on our operating flexibility. In 
the past financial year, we were also able to fully achieve our target in terms of operating result.  
Our focus on the PUMA family is an important cornerstone of our corporate strategy. We want to offer our 
employees an attractive working environment and diversity plays an important role in our corporate culture. 
In 2023, PUMA received multiple awards for this successful strategy, including the "Top Employer Award" for 
24 PUMA subsidiaries in the Europe, Asia/Pacific and Latin and North America regions. We can therefore 
continue to call ourselves a "Global Top Employer". We were also named one of the "World's Best 
Employers" by Forbes and a "Leader in Diversity" by the Financial Times, and awarded the "Great Place to 
Work" seal in numerous countries. We were able to further optimise our processes by upgrading the 
logistics centres in our main markets, and by expanding existing warehouses and opening new ones. We 
also invested in improving our IT infrastructure, product development and ERP systems. 
We were able to achieve currency-adjusted sales growth of 6.6% in the financial year 2023. Sales 
development was affected by the significant devaluation of the Argentine peso, which had an extraordinary 
impact in the fourth quarter and on the full-year 2023. Due to the extent and timing of these currency 
effects, we were unable to fully compensate for all of the negative impacts at the end of the year. 
Nevertheless, sales development was mainly in the high single-digit percentage range, in line with the 
outlook for currency-adjusted sales growth. In addition to sales growth, the gross profit margin improved. 
However, these positive effects were offset by the slightly stronger increase in other operating income and 
expenses compared to sales. 
Operating result (EBIT) of ‚Ç¨ 621.6 million in the past financial year was in line with our forecast of a range 
between ‚Ç¨ 590 million and ‚Ç¨ 670 million. Despite the significant devaluation of the Argentine peso, we have 
therefore fully achieved our target in terms of operating result in the past financial year. The devaluation of 
the Argentine peso had a particularly negative effect on the financial result. Because of this, consolidated 
net income amounted to ‚Ç¨ 304.9 million compared to ‚Ç¨ 353.5 million in the previous year. This corresponds 
to a decrease of 13.7%. Earnings per share therefore decreased from ‚Ç¨ 2.36 in the previous year to ‚Ç¨ 2.03. 
Under the given circumstances of a challenging macroeconomic environment worldwide and the 
exceptional devaluation of the Argentine peso, we are very satisfied with the achievement of objectives in 
financial year 2023. We believe that, despite the exceptional devaluation of the Argentine peso, the business 
development of PUMA in 2023 reflects strong underlying operational development and strict cost discipline.  
With regard to the consolidated balance sheet, we believe that PUMA continues to have a very solid capital 
base. As of the balance sheet date, the PUMA Group's equity amounted to nearly ‚Ç¨ 2.6 billion and the equity 
ratio was 38.9%.  
Our measures to right-size inventories to an appropriate level contributed to limiting the increase in our 
working capital in 2023. This is also reflected in the improvement in the cash flow from operating activities 
and free cash flow. Our cash and cash equivalents amounted to ‚Ç¨ 552.9 million as of the balance sheet date. 
In addition, the PUMA Group has unutilised credit lines totalling ‚Ç¨ 986.1 million at its disposal. 
Consequently, the net assets, financial position and results of operations of the PUMA Group is overall very 
solid at the time the combined management report was prepared. This enables the Management Board and 
the Supervisory Board to propose to the Annual General Meeting on 22 May 2024 a dividend of ‚Ç¨ 0.82 per 
share for the financial year 2023. This corresponds to a payout ratio of 40.3% in relation to the consolidated 


PUMA Annual Report 2023 
‚Üó Combined Management Report

net income according to IFRS. The higher payout ratio results from the strong improvement in free cash 
flow and reflects the underlying positive operating business development. In general, PUMA's dividend 
policy continues to provide for a payout of 25% to 35% of consolidated net income.

In the financial year 2023, sales increased by a total of 8.0% to ‚Ç¨ 1,243.7 million. The increase resulted both 
from higher revenues from product sales and from higher commission income in the context of licence 
management. Revenues from PUMA SE product sales rose by 15.8% to ‚Ç¨ 589.4 million (previous year: 
‚Ç¨ 508.9 million). Royalty and commission income included in sales increased by 1.7% to ‚Ç¨ 599.3 million 


PUMA Annual Report 2023 
‚Üó Combined Management Report 
248 
(previous year: ‚Ç¨ 589.1 million). Other sales, which mainly consisted of recharges of costs to affiliated 
companies, totalled ‚Ç¨ 55.0 million in 2023 (previous year: ‚Ç¨ 53.9 million).  
Other operating income amounted to ‚Ç¨ 83.7 million in 2023 (previous year: ‚Ç¨ 84.0 million) and includes, in 
particular, realised and unrealised gains from currency conversion related to the measurement of 
receivables and liabilities in foreign currencies at the balance sheet date. 
The total expenditure from material expenses, personnel expenses, depreciation and other operating 
expenses increased by 12.8% to ‚Ç¨ 1,455.2 million compared to the previous year (previous year: a total of 
‚Ç¨ 1,289.7 million). The increase in material expenses compared to the previous year was mainly due to the 
increase in sales. The disproportionate growth in material expenses in comparison with sales resulted from 
intra-group sales of goods to PUMA Benelux, which were carried out without a surcharge. Personnel 
expenses increased due to a higher number of employees. Other operating expenses increased compared 
with the previous year, mainly due to increased administrative, marketing and sales expenses.  
The financial result increased, compared to the previous year, by 36.6% to ‚Ç¨ 258.8 million. The increase was 
mainly due to higher profit transfer from affiliated companies. The interest result and the income from 
dividends from investments in affiliated companies fell slightly. In addition, the investment in Borussia 
Dortmund GmbH & Co. KGaA (BVB), Dortmund, was written down in the financial year due to an impairment 
of ‚Ç¨ 0.5 million, which is expected to be permanent.  
The increase in sales was offset by the increase in expenses, which is why earnings before income taxes 
fell by 3.5% to ‚Ç¨ 131.0 million in 2023 (from ‚Ç¨ 135.8 million in the previous year). Taxes on income amounted 
to ‚Ç¨ 21.2 million (previous year: ‚Ç¨ 18.8 million). Accordingly, PUMA SE's net income under the German 
Commercial Code (German GAAP, HGB) decreased by 6.2% to ‚Ç¨ 109.8 million in the financial year 2023 
(previous year: ‚Ç¨ 117.0 million).

Overall, fixed assets increased by 49.9% to ‚Ç¨ 1,648.9 million in 2023. The increase is mainly the result of the 
increase in shareholdings in the amount of ‚Ç¨ 521.9 million due to capital contributions to PUMA Sprint 
GmbH, Germany, as well as further investments in IT. 
The decline in inventories of current assets by 25.6% to ‚Ç¨ 85.7 million was mainly due to more conservative 
purchasing behaviour, especially at the end of the year. The consolidation of inventories for Central Europe, 
including Benelux, and the associated improvement in the management of purchases and sales supported 
the positive development of inventories. Receivables and other assets decreased by a total of 42.2% 
compared with the previous year to ‚Ç¨ 680.9 million. In particular, lower receivables from affiliated 
companies contributed to this development, which resulted in particular from the capital contribution. Cash 
and cash equivalents increased by 71.8% to ‚Ç¨ 165.8 million compared to the previous year, due to the cash 
inflow from financing and investing activities. 
On the liabilities side, equity fell slightly by 0.9% to ‚Ç¨ 925.8 million in 2023. In combination with the increase 
of the balance sheet total due to higher liabilities, this led to a decline in the equity ratio, which was 35.5% 
as at the balance sheet date of 31 December 2023 compared to 37.1% in the previous year. 
Provisions decreased by 12.8% compared to the previous year to ‚Ç¨ 123.7 million. This development was 
mainly due to lower provisions for outstanding invoices. Liabilities increased from ‚Ç¨ 1,438.9 million in the 
previous year to ‚Ç¨ 1,555.0 million as of 31 December 2023. This increase primarily resulted from the 
increased liabilities to banks due to the taking out of a promissory note loan and, in contrast, lower 
liabilities to affiliated companies.

In financial year 2023, cash outflow from operating activities amounted to ‚Ç¨ 92.6 million, compared to a 
cash inflow of ‚Ç¨ 4.9 million in the previous year. This development is mainly due to the decrease of 
receivables from affiliated companies. In contrast, the reduction in inventories had a positive effect. 
The cash inflow from investing activities in 2023 is mainly due to the reduction in cash pool and loan 
receivables from affiliated companies. These are offset by cash outflows from investments in fixed assets. 
Cash flow from financing activities showed a total cash inflow of ‚Ç¨ 95.6 million in 2023 (previous year: 
‚Ç¨ 134.0 million). The cash inflow primarily resulted from the taking out of promissory note loans. In contrast, 
reduced liabilities to affiliated companies and the payment of dividends to PUMA SE shareholders for 
financial year 2022 in the amount of ‚Ç¨ 122.8 million led to a cash outflow. 
 
OUTLOOK 
In PUMA SE's financial statements under German Commercial Code (German GAAP, HGB), we expect an 
increase in sales in the mid single-digit percentage range for the financial year 2024. Assuming dividends 
from investments in affiliated companies at the previous year's level, we expect earnings before tax for the 
financial year 2024 to be at the previous year's level.

AUTHORISED CAPITAL 
By resolution of the Annual General Meeting on 5 May 2021, the Management Board is authorised, with 
approval of the Supervisory Board, to increase the share capital of the Company by up to EUR 30,000,000.00 
by issuing, once or several times, new no par-value bearer shares against contributions in cash and/or kind

The shareholders shall generally be entitled to pre-emption rights. However, the Management Board shall 
be authorised with approval of the Supervisory Board, to partially or completely exclude pre-emption rights 
‚Ä¢ to avoid peak amounts; 
‚Ä¢ in case of capital increases against contributions in cash if the pro-rated amount of the share capital 
attributable to the new shares for which pre-emption rights have been excluded does not exceed 10% of 
the share capital and the issue price of the newly created shares is not significantly lower than the 
relevant exchange price for already listed shares of the same class, Section 186 (3) sentence 4 of the 
German Stock Corporation Act (Aktiengesetz, AktG). The 10% limit of the share capital shall apply at the

Authorised Capital 2021 excluding shareholders‚Äô pre-emption rights directly or respectively applying 
Section 186 (3) sentence 4 AktG or (ii) which are or can be issued to service option and convertible bonds 
applying Section 186 (3) sentence 4 AktG while excluding shareholders‚Äô pre-emption rights during the 
term of the Authorised Capital 2021, shall be counted towards said limit of 10%; 
‚Ä¢ in case of capital increases against contributions in cash insofar as it is required to grant pre-emption 
rights regarding the Company‚Äôs shares to holders of option or convertible bonds which have been or will 
be issued by the Company or its direct or indirect subsidiaries to such an extent to which they would be 
entitled after exercising option or conversion rights or fulfilling the conversion obligation as a 
shareholder; 
‚Ä¢ in case of capital increases against contributions in kind for carrying out mergers or for the direct or 
indirect acquisition of companies, participation in companies or parts of companies or other assets 
including intellectual property rights and receivables against the Company or any companies controlled

issue of option or convertible bonds during the term of this authorisation while excluding pre-emption 
rights. The Management Board shall be entitled, with approval of the Supervisory Board, to determine the 
remaining terms of the rights associated with the new shares as well as the conditions of the issuance of 
shares. The Supervisory Board is entitled to adjust the respective version of the Company‚Äôs Articles of

RISK AND OPPORTUNITY REPORT 
PUMA is continuously exposed to opportunities and risks in the competitive, fast-paced and international 
sport and lifestyle industry. The risk strategy is therefore to take business risks in a calculated manner in 
order to implement the corporate strategy with all its opportunities. For this purpose, effective risk and 
opportunity management is required so that opportunities can be recognised and utilised, and risks can be 
identified and managed at an early stage. We define risks as potential future developments or events that 
may lead to a negative deviation from targets for the company (see the "Risk Management System" section). 
Similarly, opportunities are potential future developments or events that may result in a positive deviation 
from targets. 
 
RISK MANAGEMENT SYSTEM 
PUMA takes a conscious and controlled approach to risks in order to achieve the company's goals. The aim 
of the risk management system is to identify and manage at an early-stage material risks or risks that could 
even jeopardise the company's existence and thus support the achievement of the company's objectives. In 
addition, compliance with the related laws, regulations and standards must be ensured, as well as 
transparency in relation to the risk situation from the perspective of partners such as customers, suppliers 
and investors. Therefore, PUMA has established an appropriate and effective risk management organisation 
which is able to identify risks at an early stage and manage them in accordance with the corporate strategy 
and promote risk awareness within the PUMA Group to facilitate risk-based decisions. As part of the 
organisation, risks are looked at Group-wide, unless explicitly stated to the contrary. As in the previous year, 
PUMA's risk management system is based on a comprehensive, interactive, and management-oriented 
approach to risk that is integrated into the company's organisation and is based on the globally recognised 
COSO standard (Committee of Sponsoring Organisations of the Treadway Commission). Opportunity 
management is not part of the risk management system and is the responsibility of operational 
management teams in the respective regions, markets, and departments (see the "Opportunities" section). 
The Management Board of PUMA SE bears overall responsibility for the risk management system in 
accordance with Section 91(3) AktG. The Management Board regularly updates the Audit Committee of the 
Supervisory Board of PUMA SE. In addition, pursuant to Section 107(4), the Audit Committee has a direct 
right to information from the operational management departments. The Risk Management Committee, 
which consists of the PUMA SE Management Board and selected managers, is responsible for the design, 
review, and adaptation of the risk management system. For the operational coordination of the risk 
management process and support of the risk officers, the risk management function of the Group Internal 
Audit, Risk Management & Internal Control department has been assigned to prepare the regular risk 
reporting to the Risk Management Committee. The responsibilities, tasks and processes of the risk 
management system are defined in PUMA‚Äôs enterprise risk guidelines. The structure and design of the risk 
management system are as follows: 
 
 


PUMA Annual Report 2023 
‚Üó Combined Management Report 
256 
‚Üó G.19 RISK MANAGEMENT SYSTEM 
 
 
 
 
The risk owners are mainly the managers of the functional areas and the managing directors of the 
subsidiaries. Risks are identified company-wide by performing a bottom-up analysis within the risk owner's 
area of responsibility. These risks are regularly reported to the risk management function and/or the local 
monitoring bodies in structured interviews that take place every six months or during the year using 
established internal reporting channels. As a part of the risk culture at PUMA, general information for risk 
management as well as training materials are made available for all employees. 
The risks are evaluated and assessed in terms of probability of occurrence and extent of damage using 
quantitative criteria with the help of a systematic methodology. The quantitative criteria are represented in 
the form of risk classification ranges on a four-level scale: Low, Medium, Significant and High. While the 
risk assessment of the probability of occurrence is measured as a percentage rate, the extent of damage is 
based on the planned operating result for the upcoming financial year. We follow a net risk approach, 
addressing the risks that remain after existing control measures have been implemented. The resulting risk 
assessments are presented as an aggregated risk group ("overall risk situation"). Thus, for the materiality 
assessment, the quantified risks are combined from their extent of damage and probability of occurrence 
and are classified in a comprehensive risk matrix regarding their significance level (‚ÄúLow‚Äù, ‚ÄúModerate‚Äù, 
‚ÄúMaterial‚Äù and ‚ÄúCritical‚Äù) for internal monitoring and to assess their viability (see graphic G.21). 
For example, a risk can be allocated within the most critical range, which may also include risks that could 
even jeopardise the company's existence, in the case that its assessment reflects a combination of highest 
bandwidth for extent of damage (‚ÄúHigh > ‚Ç¨ 50 million‚Äù) and probability (‚ÄúHigh > 50%‚Äù). The overview of the 
risk groups is presented in table T.7, summarised in the order of their relative importance and their change 
during the year.

‚Üó G.20 RISK MATRIX 
 
 
Regular risk identification and assessment is carried out by the risk management function every six months 
with all major functional areas. The risks recorded and assessed are also reviewed with a top-down 
approach by the Risk Management Committee. This ensures that adequate consideration is given to 
interdependencies and the overall risk situation. 
The risk owners are responsible for the operational management of identified risks. Risks can be managed 
by avoiding, reducing, diversifying, or transferring the risk to achieve the targeted and acceptable residual 
risk. Within the reporting process, material risks or those which could even jeopardise the company‚Äôs 
existence are coordinated with and managed by the Risk Management Committee or the Management 
Board, considering the risk-bearing capacity, which is also based on the planned operating result. 
The methodology and structure of the risk management system are continuously monitored in terms of 
their appropriateness and effectiveness and adapted or improved when required. This is carried out on the 
one hand by the Internal Audit department, as an independent audit body within the PUMA Group, and on 
the other hand through the utilisation of the results of the auditor of PUMA SE, which assesses the early 
risk identification system annually for its fundamental suitability to be able to identify risks that endanger 
the company‚Äôs existence at an early stage.

RISKS 
The following explanations of risk groups are presented based on their relative importance from the Group 
perspective for the financial year 2023. 
MACROECONOMIC DEVELOPMENTS 
As an internationally operating enterprise, PUMA is exposed to challenges and uncertainties that affect the 
global economy and the associated risks may have an impact on our sales and sourcing markets. For 
example, macroeconomic risks because of economic recessions, changes in interest rates, or inflation and 
cost pressures, might have an impact on consumer behavior, production costs, sales, and profit margins. 
Likewise, global events such as political changes, social developments, geopolitical tensions, and natural 
disasters can disrupt supply chain activities or affect consumer sentiment, are also reflected in legal and 
macroeconomic conditions. 
In 2023, the macroeconomic and geopolitical environment remain challenging. The recent conflict in Middle 
East, the war in Ukraine, persistent inflation, and the risks of recession weights on consumer sentiment, 
resulting in volatile demand in the retail sector. The pattern of China‚Äôs economic recovery after COVID-19 
remains uncertain and competition with both local and global brands remains high.  
Overall, we manage these challenges by having close alignment and communication with regions and key 
markets to follow up and deal with critical developments affecting PUMA business environment (e.g., price 
increases, supply chain interruptions, geopolitical tensions) and develop alternative scenarios to analyse 
possible occurrence of events. Moreover, the Management Board is regularly updated about country and 
macroeconomic developments and defines action plans to quickly adapt to changing economic conditions. 
BUSINESS PARTNERS 
As an enterprise with global operations, managing sourcing and supply chain related risks is of key 
importance for PUMA. Most of our PUMA products are produced in Asia in countries like China, Vietnam, 
Cambodia, Bangladesh, Indonesia and India. In addition to the challenges, production in these countries 
continues to be associated with significant risks for us. These risks arise, for example, from changes in 
sourcing, wage and logistic costs, supply bottlenecks for raw materials or components, and quality issues, 
as well as from the possibility of overdependence on individual suppliers. Sourcing and the supply chain 
must also react to risks, such as changes in duties and tariffs as well as trade restrictions and government 
requirements. The transport of products to the distribution countries is also exposed to the risk of delays 
and failures by warehouse and logistics service providers due to extraordinary events and/or human or 
system error. 
To mitigate business partners related risks, we have implemented a functional framework for sourcing and 
supply chain processes. Our sourcing portfolio is regularly reviewed and adjusted to avoid creating a 
dependence on individual suppliers and sourcing markets. Generally, long-term master framework 
agreements are concerted to secure the required production capacities for the future. Regular 
communication with PUMA entities allows us to anticipate any price increase and strengthen our forecast 
activities. A quality control process and the direct and partnership-like collaboration with suppliers should 
permanently secure the quality and availability of our products. Moreover, we continuously analyse political, 
economic, and legal framework conditions and have further enhanced our close cooperation with our 
logistics partners to be able to react to changes in the supply chain early on and to continuously strengthen 
the supply chain. The collaboration with warehouse and logistics service providers is accordingly secured by 
selection processes, consistent contractual terms, and permanent monitoring of relevant indicators. 
In 2023 global sourcing markets normalised because of the end of COVID-related restrictions: However, 
there are continued supply chain and sourcing challenges regarding rising costs and the potential threat of 
a larger recession that could still cause disruptions and delays in the operations. To diminish these 
challenges, we have further intensified the cooperation with our suppliers and logistics partners to be able 
to act flexibly and base our actions around finding the right solutions.

CURRENCY RISKS 
As a group that operates internationally, PUMA is exposed to transactional foreign currency risks. The 
currency risks exist to the extent that the exchange rates of currencies in which purchase and sales 
transactions as well as lending transactions and receivables are carried out fluctuate against the functional 
currency of the PUMA Group - the euro. 
PUMA's biggest sourcing market is Asia, where most payments are settled in US dollars (USD), while sales 
of the PUMA Group are mostly invoiced in other currencies. PUMA manages currency risk in accordance 
with internal guidelines. Material risks are hedged, in accordance with the Group directive, up to a hedging 
ratio of 95% of the estimated foreign currency risks from expected purchase and sales transactions over the 
next 12 to 15 months. Forward exchange contracts and currency options, usually with a term of around 12 
months from the reporting date, are used to hedge the foreign currency risk. For significant risks that are 
subject to large hedging costs, high hedging ratios can only be achieved over shorter terms. 
To hedge signed or pending contracts against currency risk, PUMA only concludes currency forward 
contracts and currency options on customary market terms with reputable international financial 
institutions. As of the end of 2023, the net requirements for the 2024 planning period were adequately 
hedged against currency effects, if possible. 
Foreign exchange risks may also arise from intra-group loans granted for financing purposes. Currency 
swaps and currency forward transactions are used to hedge currency risks when converting intra-group 
loans denominated in foreign currencies into the functional currencies of the group companies (EUR). 
In addition, as an international group with its own presence in a large number of countries, PUMA is also 
exposed to translation risks. These arise in the course of consolidation when individual financial statements 
of foreign subsidiaries that do not prepare their accounts in euros are translated into the PUMA Group's 
functional currency, the euro. 
In countries with high interest and inflation rates, both transaction risks and translation risks can arise to a 
considerable extent. PUMA does not hedge these risks, as the hedging costs in high-interest countries - 
insofar as hedging is possible at all - in some cases significantly exceed the benefits of hedging. The 
negative effects of currency and inflation are generally compensated for by adjusting the prices of products 
in the respective market. 
In order to disclose market risks, IFRS 7 requires sensitivity analysis that show the effects of hypothetical 
changes in relevant risk variables on earnings and equity. The periodic effects are determined by relating 
the hypothetical changes caused by the risk variables to the balance of the financial instruments held as of 
the balance sheet date. The underlying assumption is that the balance as of the balance sheet date is 
representative for the entire year. 
Currency risks as defined by IFRS 7 arise on account of financial instruments that are denominated in a 
currency which differs from the functional currency and are monetary in nature. Differences resulting from 
the conversion of the individual financial statements to the group currency are not taken into account. All 
non-functional currencies in which the Group employs financial instruments are generally considered to be 
relevant risk variables. 
The currency sensitivity analysis is based on the net balance sheet risk denominated in foreign currencies. 
This also includes intra-company monetary assets and liabilities. Outstanding currency derivatives are also 
reassessed as part of the sensitivity analysis. It is assumed that all other influencing factors, including 
interest rates and raw material prices, remain constant. The effects of the forecasted operating cash flows 
are also ignored. 


PUMA Annual Report 2023 
‚Üó Combined Management Report 
260 
Currency forward contracts, used to hedge against payment fluctuations caused by exchange rates, are part 
of an effective cash-flow hedging relationship pursuant to IAS 39. Changes in the exchange rate of the 
currencies underlying these contracts have an effect on the hedge reserve in equity and on the fair value of 
these hedging contracts. 
PANDEMIC 
PUMA first identified the COVID-19 pandemic as a new risk in the financial year 2020 and accordingly estab-
lished the risk category "Pandemic‚Äù. Risks related to a pandemic event such as supply chain disruptions, 
economic and financial strains, lockdowns, retail store closings, cancellations of sport events or social 
restrictions could lead to severe business disruptions, reduced consumption, loss of sales, or liquidity 
shortfalls. For financial year 2023, the negative impacts of the pandemic have diminished as countries and 
regions ended pandemic-related restrictions and economic and life activities are normalising. In principle, 
uncertainties arise in relation to new variants that could lead to possible lockdowns or restrictions. 
To mitigate pandemic-related risks, different strategic approaches have been established to ensure and 
prioritise the health and safety of our employees and customers, as well as continuous monitoring of the 
situation and possible restrictions. There is continuous monitoring of the latest economic events and close 
alignment with our regions and key markets to manage critical developments and adapt to market 
conditions. Close cooperation with partners and suppliers is essential to implement and monitor 
contingency strategies. In addition to Direct-to-Consumer business, the e-commerce business and PUMA 
App are an essential part of our distribution structure. 
PRODUCT & MARKET ENVIRONMENT 
The sport and lifestyle markets are defined by intense competition, constant innovation, and changing 
consumer preferences. PUMA faces the challenge of continuously innovating and differentiating its product 
offering to capture consumer interest and gain and edge over its competitors. Product and market 
environment risks could arise from a non-anticipated or late response to consumer demand within the fast-
moving lifestyle and sports markets. Constant changes in consumer lifestyle/sports trends and long product 
lifecycles bear the risk of creating products that are not relevant to our consumers, launching them at the 
wrong time, launching them with the wrong marketing campaign or placing them in the wrong distribution 
channels. As a result, these risks could lead to a loss in market share, sales shortfalls, and lower brand 
attractiveness. Media reports about PUMA also play a key role in brand image. For example, reports about 
the infringement of laws or internal/external requirements, product recalls and exposure on social media 
as well as reports about workforce diversity and tolerance can cause significant damage to brand image and 
ultimately result in the loss of sales and profit. 
To mitigate these risks, we conduct market research and systemic monitoring of market environment for 
early recognition and taking advantage of relevant consumer trends. Targeted investments in product design 
and product development are to ensure that the characteristic PUMA design of the entire product range is 
consistent with the overall brand strategy ("Forever Faster"), thereby creating a unique level of brand 
recognition. Accordingly, we have set the guiding principle that "We want to become the fastest sports brand 
in the world" to underline the company's long-term direction and strategy. The "Forever Faster" brand 
promise does not just stand for PUMA's product range as a sports and lifestyle company, but also applies to 
all company processes. Brand image is particularly strengthened through cooperation with brand 
ambassadors who embody the core of the brand and PUMA's brand values ("brave," "confident," 
"determined" and "joyful") and have a large potential for influencing PUMA's target group. We additionally 
counter this risk through careful press, social media, and public relations work as well as by monitoring the 
press and social media environment. 
PROJECTS 
The strategic program portfolio of PUMA contains important and critical projects to ensure that the flow of 
goods and information is sufficiently supported by modern warehouse, logistics and IT infrastructure. These 
include, for example, the implementation of IT systems to enhance operations, such as centralised systems 


PUMA Annual Report 2023 
‚Üó Combined Management Report 
261 
or e-commerce platforms and systems in the warehouse and supply chain. Risk associated with projects 
include ineffective change management, lack of resources, high costs, exceeding budget, overrun time 
frames, non-acceptance of users due to weak communication, increase vulnerability to potential data 
breaches and disruption to business processes. 
To manage project-related risks effectively, PUMA has established group and regional project teams as well 
as policies to manage the roll-out of new and existing projects that have a significant impact on the core 
value chain. In addition, as part of project management practices, continuous alignment with stakeholders 
and steering meetings to monitor, provide support and guidance on strategic projects are implemented to 
ensure its execution is in line with pre-defined objectives and milestones such as time frames and budgets.  
INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY  
The ongoing digitalisation of business environments brings new challenges to PUMA in the field of 
information technology which ‚Äì in case of incidents - may have an impact on our operations, data security 
and privacy, as well as overall performance. Key business procedures and processes such as supply chain 
management, e-commerce, and financial reporting depend on digital services, infrastructure, and their 
unimpaired availability. Interruptions of service availability can disrupt essential processes and cause 
operational problems. Moreover, information security is of outmost importance for PUMA, the risk of a data 
breach might lead to financial loss, brand damage, legal claims, and loss of customer trust. 
To mitigate these risks, we continuously carry out technical and organisational measures. Key business 
procedures, processes and infrastructure on information technology and security are established based on 
best -practice frameworks, regularly updated and controlled. These processes are subject to internal and 
external audits to ensure their reliability and the appropriateness of control mechanisms. Appropriate 
procedures and guidelines related to IT-incident response are in place and updated accordingly. Moreover, 
PUMA has an Information Security Committee which consistently updates the Management Board on the 
latest status and developments. In addition, trainings and information campaigns are conducted regularly to 
increase awareness and knowledge on information security related issues. 
DISTRIBUTION STRUCTURE 
PUMA relies on different distribution channels including the Wholesale business with our retail partners 
and the Direct-to-Consumer (DTC) business with our PUMA-owned and operated (O&O) retail stores and e-
commerce platforms. This diversified distribution mix enables PUMA to reduce its dependency on individual 
distribution channels and/or retail partners.  
The wholesale business represents the largest share of sales overall and is characterised by strong 
partnerships with all our retail partners. The company‚Äôs DTC business has a complementary role and is 
intended to ensure a better and more comprehensive presentation of PUMA products in a controlled brand 
environment, direct interaction with our end consumers and a higher gross profit margin. 
In the wholesale business, growing retailers, including those offering their own brands, and direct 
competitors pose the risk of intensified competition for market shares, price pressures or reduced profit 
margins. Consumer purchase behavior is also changing, focusing more on e-commerce and a combination 
of stationary and digital trade. This requires continuous adjustment of the distribution structure. 
Distribution through our O&O retail stores and e-commerce platforms is, however, also associated with 
various risks including the required investments in expansion and infrastructure, setting up and 
refurbishing stores, higher fixed costs, and leases with long-term lease obligations. This can have an 
adverse impact on profitability in the event of a business decline.  
To avoid risks, we carry out permanent monitoring of distribution channels and regular reporting by 
Controlling and the dedicated functions. We maintain strong collaborations with all our retail partners in line 
with our wholesale-focused strategy. The company's reporting and controlling system allows us to detect 
negative trends early on, and to take the countermeasures required to manage individual stores and overall 


PUMA Annual Report 2023 
‚Üó Combined Management Report 
262 
to monitor the evolution of the distribution landscape. A detailed location and profitability analysis is carried 
out in our DTC business before making any investment decision. In e-commerce, global activities are 
harmonised and investments in IT systems are carried out to further improve the shopping experience for our 
consumers and to drive conversion. This includes the continued global roll-out of the PUMA Shopping App. 
SUSTAINABILITY 
Sustainability topics are highly important for PUMA specially in sourcing as well as along the entire value 
chain. Natural resources crises and the resulting increase in customer requirements regarding 
sustainability have led to a stronger ecological focus in our product range, both at our own locations and 
along the production and supply chain. A more efficient use of resources, reduction in greenhouse gas 
emissions and compliance with environmental standards as well as the increased use of environmentally 
preferred materials and environmentally friendly chemicals in production are crucial parts of our 
sustainability strategy. The risk of not implementing an effective sustainability approach to our products and 
along the supply chain could lead to serious brand damage, loss of customer loyalty, supply chain 
disruptions, increased costs, and non-compliance with environmental regulations. 
PUMA‚Äôs efforts towards managing sustainability risks and efficient use of resources are reflected in the 
comprehensive ‚ÄúForever Better‚Äù strategy which defines 10 target areas to improve sustainability 
performance: Human Rights, Climate Action, Circularity, Products, Water and Air, Biodiversity, Plastics and 
the Oceans, Chemicals, Health & Safety as well as Fair Income. For each of these target areas, which are 
aligned to the UN Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), there are measurable targets and KPI‚Äôs which are 
regularly monitored and reported to Board Members, Supervisory Board, and stakeholders. Additionally, 
risk assessments and audits are performed to ensure our suppliers follow environmental standards. 
PUMA‚Äôs efforts to engage with stakeholder dialog through different events like ‚ÄúConference of the People‚Äù 
or "Voices of a RE:GENERATION" allowed to discuss sustainability topics with generation Z representatives, 
industry peers, experts and activists. 
PUMA's sustainability report (the Non-financial Report) for the financial year 2023 is published together 
with the combined management report and can be accessed at the following page on our website: 
https://about.PUMA.com/en/investor-relations/financial-reports. 
MONITORING OF WORKING CONDITIONS 
An important aspect of corporate responsibility is maintaining and monitoring good working conditions and 
compliance with human rights in PUMA‚Äôs own operations and throughout the supply chain to ensure that 
employee‚Äôs rights and well-being are protected. This risk considers the event of human rights violation or 
social and environmental non-compliance (e.g., child labor, excessive overtime, forced labor, sexual 
harassment, gender-based violence, unsafe work environment, fair income) in PUMA‚Äôs own business and its 
supply chain.  
To mitigate these risks, PUMA has implemented clear policies that are aligned with all relevant legislation 
on sustainability like the German Supply Chain Act, United Nations‚Äô (UN) Declaration of Human Rights, the 
UN Guiding Principles (UNGPs) on Business and Human Rights, the International Labor Organisation‚Äôs Core 
Labor Conventions, and the ten principles of the UN Global Compact (UNGC). Regular audits and human 
rights/environmental risk assessments are conducted at the corporate and the supply chain level to 
evaluate compliance with applicable standards. Stakeholder dialogue with NGOs and partnerships with 
organisations (e.g., Fair Labor Association) enable transparent communication channels to address 
concerns and share best practices regarding human rights and environmental standards.

LEGAL 
As an internationally operating group, PUMA is exposed to various legal risks. These risks could arise from 
Intellectual Property (IP) infringements that involve using a trademark, patent or copyright without proper 
authorisation and resulting in legal disputes, brand damage or loss of exclusivity rights. Contractual risks or 
risks that a third party could assert claims and litigations for infringements of its trademark rights are also 
considered. Counterfeit products are often of inferior quality and may not meet safety standards which can 
undermine the PUMA‚Äôs brand reputation, reduce consumer trust and lead to legal disputes. 
The continuous monitoring of contractual obligations and the integration of internal and external legal 
experts in contractual matters should ensure that any legal risks reduced to the minimum. The legal team 
is responsible for protecting our intellectual property in order to act against brand piracy. This not only 
ensures that we have a strong global portfolio of property rights, such as trademarks, designs and patents, 
but also works closely with customs, police and other authorities and provides input to legislators regarding 
the implementation of effective measures to protect intellectual property. 
COMPLIANCE  
As an international group, PUMA is exposed to compliance risks resulting from the potential non-adherence 
to corporate governance rules, legal and regulatory requirements, or industry standards. These risks 
include fraud, conflict of interest, money laundering, antitrust law, corruption as well as deliberate 
misrepresentations in financial reporting which may lead to significant penalties, legal consequences, 
reputational damage, and disruption to business operations.  
PUMA has implemented various tools to manage such risks. This includes a functioning compliance 
management system, the internal control system, group controlling and the internal audit departments to 
prevent, detect and sanction compliance-related topics at an early stage. Through the compliance 
management system, clear roles and responsibilities are assigned to group and local compliance functions. 
To ensure PUMA employees comply with PUMA ‚Äòs values there are ongoing trainings, communication and 
awareness campaigns for policies and procedures. PUMA employees also have access to a whistleblowing 
system for reporting illegal or unethical behavior. 
TAX  
As a global company PUMA is exposed to a complex tax environment in which main challenges arise from 
cross-border transactions involving intercompany transfer of goods, services, and intellectual property. To 
minimise tax exposure, it is essential to optimise tax planning activities and ensure compliance with local 
and international laws and reporting requirements. In addition to compliance with national tax regulations 
to which the individual group companies are subject, there are increasing risks related to intra-group 
transfer pricing, which must be applied for various internal business transactions in accordance with the 
arm's length principle between related parties. Different countries have implemented laws and guidelines 
for international taxes in alignment with the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development 
(OECD) recommendations to standardise requirements for transfer-pricing documentation and update 
global tax policy.  
In order to manage tax-related risks in an effective manner, PUMA established a solid tax governance 
framework. An adequate tax organisation with internal and external tax experts to comply with the relevant 
tax regulations and to be able to react to changes in the constantly changing tax environment. For the 
group-internal transfer pricing, corresponding documentation and policies are in place and aligned with 
international and national requirements and standards. There are guidelines and specifications for 
determining transfer prices for intra-group transactions that are common for foreign companies, which 
comply with the applicable internal procedural rules and are binding for employees who act on behalf of the 
group. By means of internal tax reporting, external and internal tax experts can control and monitor tax 
developments at PUMA on an ongoing basis. Training and awareness activities are performed on a regular 
basis to ensure relevant stakeholders are informed about current tax developments and acquire further 
expertise for tax treatment activities. Both, the Management Board, and the Supervisory Board, are 


PUMA Annual Report 2023 
‚Üó Combined Management Report 
264 
regularly informed about ongoing tax developments at PUMA to identify and avoid tax-related risks as early 
as possible. 
PERSONNEL DEPARTMENT 
The creative potential, commitment and performance of PUMA employees are essential factors for 
achieving our strategic and financial targets. Personnel-related risks involve the management of workforce, 
talent acquisition and retention, employee engagement and compliance with employment laws. Any 
shortfall in staffing may lead to inadequate performance of tasks and have a negative impact on operational 
efficiency. In addition, there is still strong global competition for highly qualified personnel. Therefore, loss 
of key personnel and difficulties in identifying, attracting, and retaining key talent could lead to loss of know-
how and decrease business performance. Likewise, non-compliance to health and safety laws and 
regulations could lead to accidents, penalties, employee dissatisfaction, business interruptions and 
reputational damage at Group level. 
Through our human resources strategy, we seek to encourage independent thinking and action, which are 
key in an open corporate culture with flat hierarchies on a long-term and sustainable basis. To achieve this 
goal, a control process is in place to detect and assess human-resource risks. PUMA pays particular 
attention to talent management, identifying key positions and talent, ensuring this talent is trained and 
positioned optimally, and succession planning. We have also instituted additional national and global 
regulations and guidelines to ensure compliance with legal provisions and safeguard the health and safety 
of our employees. Moreover, employee surveys are conducted to obtain feedback and measure employee 
engagement (e.g., ‚ÄúGreat Place to Work‚Äù, ‚ÄúDiversity Leader‚Äù). During 2023, PUMA received several awards 
which recognised the ongoing efforts to create a diverse, inclusive, and equal workforce (e.g., ‚ÄúTop 
Employer‚Äù). We will continue to make targeted investments in the human resource needs of functions or 
regions to meet the future requirements of our corporate strategy.  
LIQUIDITY AND INTEREST RATE RISKS 
PUMA continually analyses short-term capital requirements by rolling cash flow planning at the level of the 
individual companies in coordination with the central Treasury department. In order to ensure the 
company's solvency, financial flexibility and a strategic liquidity buffer, PUMA maintains, for example, a 
liquidity reserve in the form of cash and confirmed credit facilities. In this respect, as of December 31, 2023, 
the PUMA Group had unused credit lines totaling ‚Ç¨ 896.1 million.  
Medium and long-term funding requirements that cannot be directly covered by net cash from operating 
activities are financed by taking out medium and long-term loans. For this purpose, various promissory note 
loans were issued in several tranches with fixed and variable coupons and different remaining terms. The 
utilised promissory note loans amount to a total of ‚Ç¨ 551.5 million as of December 31, 2023 and have a 
remaining term of between one and five years.  
Changes in market interest rates around the world have an impact on future interest payments for variable 
interest liabilities. As PUMA only has a limited amount of variable interest-bearing liabilities, interest rate 
hedging instruments are used to a limited extent. 
DEFAULT RISKS 
Due to its business activities, PUMA is exposed to default risk on trade receivables. These risks consider 
delayed payments and losses of accounts receivables (e.g., default of a customer) as well as default risks 
from counterparty's other contractual financial obligations (e.g., bank deposits, derivative financial 
instruments). This could lead to bad debt expenses and reduced liquidity and could have a negative impact 
on cash flow and profitability, as trade receivables are one of the most significant financial assets. 


PUMA Annual Report 2023 
‚Üó Combined Management Report 
265 
The default risk is managed by continuously monitoring outstanding receivables and recognising 
impairment losses, where appropriate. The default risk is limited, if possible, by credit insurance. The 
maximum default risk is reflected by the carrying amounts of the financial assets recognised in the balance 
sheet. In addition, default risks also arise to a lesser extent from other contractual financial obligations of 
the counterparty, such as bank balances and derivative financial instruments.

OPPORTUNITIES 
Opportunities should be identified by PUMA at an early stage, assessed and - where possible - materialised. 
The operational management teams in the markets and departments are responsible for opportunity 
management. In course of the budget- and mid-term process, the identified opportunities are incorporated 
into PUMA‚Äôs overall planning approach. PUMA has identified and defined multiple key opportunity 
categories for the current planning period and beyond. 
PUMA is operating in an external environment that is characterised by increasing geo-political risks, 
continued macro-economic headwinds, a muted consumer sentiment and a strong volatility in foreign 
exchange rates. In addition, the speed of recovery in the important U.S. and Chinese markets remains 
uncertain. In response, PUMA will continue to focus on managing short-term challenges without 
compromising the mid- and long-term momentum of the brand, always prioritising sales growth and 
market share gains over short-term profitability. Therefore, PUMA will continue to focus on being the best 
partner to its wholesale accounts and end consumer, providing them with the best possible service. 
Within our corporate strategy, we have defined the following six strategic priorities which offer significant 
opportunities: elevate the brand, enhance product excellence, improve distribution quality, focus on people 
first, digitalise our infrastructure and evolve sustainability. Within this overarching framework, we‚Äôre 
currently placing a special focus on brand elevation, winning in the important U.S. market, and accelerating 
our rebound in China. PUMA will continue to invest into the brand and sees significant opportunities to 
increase market shares in all key markets. Supported by new landmark partnerships with brand 
ambassadors such as Rihanna and A$AP Rocky, our lifestyle products continue to enjoy strong relevance 
and demand across all age groups and regions. We have also made great progress in performance in recent 
years and have significantly improved our market position across football, running, fitness, basketball, golf, 
and motorsport. PUMA's product range is being continuously optimised and further developed across all 
categories with a special emphasis on innovation and franchise management. In 2024, multiple 
international sport events such as the UEFA Euro Cup in Germany, the Olympic & Paralympic Games in 
Paris, and the Copa America in the U.S. will give us a platform to underline our performance credibility and 
to increase brand heat and visibility. The major global interest in these events and sports in general will 
further support the growth of the sporting goods industry. We are also seeing a continued trend toward a 
healthier lifestyle, greater sports participation, and more casual clothing, which opens corresponding 
opportunities for our industry. Meaningful marketing campaigns supported by relevant brand ambassadors 
in all major markets are essential to anchor PUMA deeply in the hearts and minds of our consumers and 
create brand relevancy and loyalty. To further elevate the brand and strengthen our consumer connection, 
PUMA will also launch a big brand campaign in 2024.  
In terms of distribution, PUMA will continue to focus on the wholesale channel. The strong partnerships 
with our wholesale accounts offer opportunities for future market share gains and business growth. 
However, we also see significant opportunities in our Direct-to-Consumer (DTC) business with a special 
emphasis on PUMA‚Äôs e-commerce channels. Since 2022, we‚Äôre rolling out a dedicated PUMA shopping app 
which is showing strong results and significantly better KPIs compared to our traditional puma.com e-
commerce channels. The PUMA shopping app will be expanded to other markets in the coming years and 
will open further opportunities regarding customer loyalty and sales growth. New store formats and 
improvements to the overall shopping experience in our own retail stores can and should also lead to 
additional business opportunities. In China, we introduced a new store format that was developed by a local 
agency to fit the needs of the Chinese consumers and that is showing strong results. In terms of 
distribution, ensuring delivery excellence through new, state-of-the art multi-channel distribution centers 
in key markets also continues to support business development. 
In information technology, improved communication with wholesale accounts and consumers via digital 
channels also offers opportunities ‚Äì e.g., through the increased use of 3D technology. In addition, new or 
more efficient processes supported by digital technology may add value or result in cost optimisation. The 
digitalisation of key business processes such as product design will continue to be advanced in order to 
increase efficiency and effectiveness.

With end consumers paying more attention to sustainability, there is an opportunity to improve 
sustainability-related communication and sell more sustainable products. PUMA‚Äôs strategic approach for 
sustainability is centered around creating maximum possible impact within the supply chain and final 
customer. Numerous initiatives are ongoing and aligned with the UN Sustainable Development Goals. For 
example, in 2023 PUMA reached another milestone: 7 out of 10 products were produced from better 
materials such as recycled polyester. PUMA started the "Voices of a RE:GENERATION" initiative which aims 
to have constant communication with GEN-Z activists and environmentalists and give feedback to our senior 
management on how PUMA can further strengthen its sustainability initiatives and communicate its 
sustainability efforts to young audiences. All these initiatives will help us to evolve sustainability within 
PUMA and leverage corresponding business opportunities. 
 
OVERALL ASSESSMENT OF THE RISK AND OPPORTUNITY SITUATION 
The assessment of the overall risk and opportunity situation of the Group and PUMA SE is the result of a 
consolidated view of the risk and opportunity categories described above for the financial year 2023. 
Following the description in our 2023 combined management report, our assessment of PUMA's overall risk 
situation this year is predominantly influenced by the macroeconomic environment and volatile retail 
demand specially in key markets, as described above, and is focused on the major challenges these pose. 
The Management Board is currently not aware of any material risks that, either individually, on an 
aggregated basis or in combination with other risks, could jeopardise the continued existence of the Group 
and PUMA SE. 
However, we cannot exclude the possibility that in the future influencing factors, of which we are currently 
unaware or which we currently do not consider to be material, could have a negative impact on the 
continued existence of the Group or PUMA SE or individual consolidated companies. Also due to the 
extremely solid balance sheet and the positive business outlook, the Management Board does not see any 
significant threat to the continued existence of the PUMA Group and PUMA SE. 
 
MAIN FEATURES OF THE INTERNAL CONTROL AND RISK MANAGEMENT SYSTEM AS IT 
RELATES TO THE GROUP'S ACCOUNTING PROCESS 
The Management Board of PUMA SE is responsible for the preparation and accuracy of the annual financial 
statements, the consolidated financial statements and the combined management report of PUMA SE. The 
consolidated financial statements were prepared in accordance with the International Financial Reporting 
Standards that apply in the EU, the requirements of the German Commercial Code (HGB), the German Stock 
Corporation Act (AktG) and the German SE Implementation Act (SEAG). Certain disclosures and amounts 
are based on current estimates by the Management Board and the management. 
The Management Board is responsible for maintaining and regularly monitoring a suitable internal control 
and risk management system covering the consolidated financial statements and the disclosures in the 
combined management report. This control and risk management system is designed to ensure the 
compliance and reliability of the internal and external accounting records, the presentation and accuracy of 
the consolidated financial statements, and the combined management report and the disclosures contained 
therein. It is based on a series of process-integrated monitoring steps and encompasses the measures 
necessary to accomplish these, such as internal instructions, organisational and authorisation guidelines, 
the relevant company guidelines and handbooks, a clear separation of functions within the Group and the 
dual-control principle. The adequacy and operating effectiveness of these measures are regularly reviewed 
by the Group Internal Audit, Risk Management & Internal Control Department. 
For monthly financial reporting and consolidation, PUMA has a group-wide reporting and controlling system 
that makes it possible to regularly and quickly detect deviations from projected figures and accounting 
irregularities and, where necessary, to take countermeasures. 


PUMA Annual Report 2023 
‚Üó Combined Management Report 
269 
By means of established internal reporting channels, the risk management system can regularly identify 
events that could affect the Group's economic performance and its accounting process so that it can analyse 
and evaluate the resulting risks and take the necessary actions to counter them. 
In preparing the consolidated financial statements and the combined management report, it is sometimes 
necessary to make assumptions and estimates based on the information available at the time the financial 
statements and management report are prepared that affect the amount, presentation and explanation of 
recognised assets and liabilities, income and expenses, contingent liabilities, and other reportable 
information. 
The Audit Committee of the Supervisory Board meets on a regular basis with the independent statutory 
auditors, the Management Board and the Group Internal Audit, Risk Management & Internal Control 
Department to discuss the results of the internal audits and statutory audits with reference to the internal 
control and risk management system as it relates to the accounting process. At the annual meeting on the 
financial statements, the auditor reports to the Supervisory Board (including the Audit Committee) on the 
results of the audit of the annual and consolidated financial statements. 
 
INTERNAL CONTROL SYSTEM 
PUMA's internal control system applies to all employees throughout the Group as it incorporates the 
principles, procedures and measures established by PUMA Group management. All essential business 
processes that support the organisational implementation of management decisions must be taken into 
account. 
Within the PUMA Group, the methodology of the internal control system is based on the COSO Framework, 
which describes internal management and monitoring considerations for key processes within the company. 
Its purpose is to support the objectives of ensuring proper financial reporting, improving the efficiency and 
effectiveness of the processes and maintaining compliance with legal framework conditions.  
The PUMA control framework is applied uniformly to the entire Group. The requirement here is to manage 
the significant risks through appropriate control activities. The objective is to continuously improve the 
internal control system and to identify specific risks and potential for improvement in the control 
environment at process level in order to define appropriate recommendations for action and to 
systematically track their timely implementation. Independent monitoring bodies such as the Supervisory 
Board and the Audit Committee help ensure that the control environment remains up-to-date. The 
Management Board of PUMA SE bears overall responsibility for the internal control system. The 
Management Board regularly updates the Audit Committee of the Supervisory Board of PUMA SE. The 
internal control function of the Group Internal Audit, Risk Management & Internal Control Department has 
been tasked with preparing regular reports for the Management Board in order to help coordinate the 
internal control system from an operational perspective. The responsibilities, tasks and processes of the 
internal control system are defined in guidelines.  
With regard to the PUMA control framework, the following five core components must be kept in mind: 
control environment, risk assessment, control activities, information and communication, and monitoring 
activities.

‚Üó G.21 INTERNAL CONTROL SYSTEM 
 
 
 
 
          
 
 
The internal control system is based on the control environment established within the PUMA Group, in that 
it lays out principles for employee and management behavior within the company. The standards practiced 
are underpinned by internally formalised procedures and by clear guidelines on giving instructions and 
authorisations to do so. Together with external regulations, these internal standards form a control 
environment that applies to all employees of the PUMA Group, supported by the relevant management and 
the process manager in the entities. 
As described in the previous section headed "Risk Management," the PUMA Group is also subject to a large 
number of risks that may potentially impact on company goals. Risk identification and assessment is 
carried out every six months in order to manage material risks at Group level. Using the resulting risk 
portfolio, the objective of the internal control system is to ensure that the compensating control measures 
fully correspond to the risk assessment/evaluation. In addition, the internal control system's risk 
assessment also includes a large number of more detailed risks in day-to-day operations ‚Äì for example, 
operational activities in accordance with compliance regulations. 
Control activities serve to counteract the identified business risks. In order to ensure that the control 
framework is continuously up-to-date and to monitor its application in business processes, an annual 
"Internal Control Self-Assessment" (ICSA) is completed by the key business units of the PUMA Group. The 
internal control function ensures that the key business units - at parent and subsidiary company level - are 
included in the ICSA. The managers of these business units evaluate the specified control objectives of the 
PUMA Group in relation to their business area. When doing so, the existing control framework is assessed 
based on internal and external guidelines and best-practice standards. Based on the responses, a level of 
implementation of the controls is determined, which undergoes independent verification by the Internal 
Control function and is then communicated to the Management Board using established reporting channels. 
The results of the ICSA are also reported to the Audit Committee and the statutory auditors and are used by 
the internal audit function of the Group Internal Audit, Risk Management & Internal Control Department in 
risk-oriented audit planning. 
The purpose of informing and communicating potential business risks and control activities is to help make 
sound business decisions, with the information required to do so being accessible within an appropriate and 
timely framework. Established communication channels are continuously used in the PUMA Group to 
achieve this. The internal control function coordinates awareness training and regular coordination 
meetings in order to continuously guarantee, and also strengthen, its cooperation with the Management 
Board and other managers of business units.

PUMA Annual Report 2023 
‚Üó Combined Management Report

The use of a standardised software system as the basis for monitoring activities is intended to ensure the 
systematic and uniform implementation of ICSA across the entire company. The internal control function 
analyses the results of the ICSA and derives recommended actions, which are coordinated with the 
managers of the business units and the implementation status of which is reviewed and monitored 
continuously. 
‚îå  
The Management Board also monitors the effectiveness of the risk management and internal control 
system in a holistic manner. Accordingly, key aspects of the systems are reviewed on a quarterly basis as 
part of cyclical reporting. This is to ensure that material risks are managed with an appropriate level of 
transparency, that individual issues are discussed in an appropriate form and can be tracked, and that 
possible improvements to the systems are considered. Supported by an established control environment, 
the continuous system monitoring, and improvement reflects the PUMA Group's open risk culture. During 
the reporting period, PUMA SE was not aware of any relevant circumstances that cast doubt on the 
adequacy and effectiveness of the risk management and internal control systems nor that had not been 
rectified by the balance sheet date. Nevertheless, it is worth noting that even systems that have been 
characterised as appropriate and effective are subject to inherent limitations. As such, it is not possible to 
guarantee the complete prevention of any procedural violations and/or risks arising.

OUTLOOK REPORT 
GLOBAL ECONOMY 
In their winter forecast dated 13 December 2023, experts at the Kiel Institute for the World Economy (Kiel 
Institut f√ºr Weltwirtschaft ‚Äì IfW Kiel) expect global gross domestic product (GDP) to increase by 2.9% in 
2024, following growth of 3.1% in 2023. Meanwhile, inflation is rapidly on the decline, and central banks are 
expected to start cutting interest rates in the first half-year of 2024. However, there are currently no 
prospects of an economic upturn. A high level of uncertainty about the economic conditions is slowing 
things down in the advanced economies, and fiscal incentives are tapering out. In China, economic 
momentum remains subdued, in view of structural issues. According to experts at IfW Kiel, the risks to the 
economic forecast for 2024 are primarily financial and political in nature. Among other things, there is 
uncertainty about developments in China, where orderly consolidation in the property sector is still not 
guaranteed. In addition, geopolitical risks have stemmed from the increasingly prominent differences 
between China and the United States. Irrespective of this, the outcome of the upcoming presidential 
elections in the United States in November harbours considerable economic and political uncertainty. 
 
SPORTING GOODS INDUSTRY 
Unless the geopolitical environment has any significant negative impact on the overall economic 
environment, we expect growth in the sporting goods industry in 2024. We expect demand for sporting goods 
to increase in 2024 as the trend towards increased sports activities and healthier lifestyles continues and 
becomes even more significant following the COVID-19 pandemic. This applies equally to the increasing 
popularity of athletic footwear and leisure/athletic apparel as an integral part of everyday fashion 
("athleisure"). We also assume that major sporting events in the coming year, such as the Summer 
Olympics in Paris and the UEFA Euro 2024 men's football championship in Germany, will help to support 
growth in the sporting goods industry. 
 
OUTLOOK 2024  
We expect geopolitical and macroeconomic headwinds as well as currency volatility to persist in 2024. These 
conditions already led to muted consumer sentiment and volatile demand in 2023 and we expect these 
effects to continue in 2024, particularly in the first half of the year. 
In this continued challenging environment, we are fully focused on executing our strategic priorities: 
elevating the brand, increasing product excellence and improving our distribution quality - especially in the 
key markets US and China. For us, 2024 is not only the year of sport with major events such as the Olympic 
Games, Euro 2024 and the Copa America providing the perfect platform to showcase our strong product 
innovation and credibility as a performance brand. It is also the year in which PUMA will invest in a new 
global brand campaign to improve its positioning as the fastest sports brand in the world. 
Supported by the continued brand momentum and despite ongoing global geopolitical and macroeconomic 
challenges, PUMA expects to achieve mid-single-digit currency-adjusted sales growth and an operating 
result (EBIT) in the range of ‚Ç¨ 620 million to ‚Ç¨ 700 million for the financial year 2024 (2023: ‚Ç¨ 621.6 million). 
The outlook assumes that the future devaluation of the Argentine peso will be fully compensated by 
corresponding price increases in Argentina. 
 
 


PUMA Annual Report 2023 
‚Üó Combined Management Report 
273 
We expect net income (2023: ‚Ç¨ 304.9 million) to change in 2024 in line with the operating result.  
As in previous years, PUMA will continue to focus on managing short-term challenges without 
compromising the brand's medium- and long-term momentum. Our sales growth and market share gains 
will take priority over short-term profitability. The exciting product range for 2024 and the very good 
feedback from retail partners as well as consumers give us confidence for the medium- and long-term 
success and continued growth of PUMA. 
 
INVESTMENTS 
Investments in fixed assets of around ‚Ç¨ 300 million are planned for 2024. The majority of these investments 
will be in infrastructure in order to create the operating conditions required for the planned long-term 
growth. The investments mainly concern own distribution and logistics centers, investments in the 
expansion and modernisation of the Group's own retail stores and investments in IT infrastructure.  
 
FOUNDATION FOR LONG-TERM GROWTH  
The Management Board and the Supervisory Board have set long-term strategic priorities. Action plans are 
being implemented in a targeted and value-oriented manner. We believe that the corporate strategy 
"Forever Faster" provides the basis for mid- and long-term positive development.

NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL 
STATEMENTS 
1. GENERAL 
Under the PUMA and Cobra Golf brand names, PUMA SE and its subsidiaries are engaged in the 
development and sale of a broad range of sports and sports lifestyle products, including footwear, apparel 
and accessories. The company is a European stock corporation (Societas Europaea/SE) and parent company 
of the PUMA Group; its registered office is on PUMA WAY 1, 91074 Herzogenaurach, Germany. The competent 
registry court is in F√ºrth (Bavaria), the register number is HRB 13085. 
The consolidated financial statements of PUMA SE and its subsidiaries (hereinafter referred to in short as 
the "Group" or "PUMA") were prepared in accordance with the "International Financial Reporting Standards 
(IFRS)" accounting standards issued by the International Accounting Standards Board (IASB), as they are to 
be applied in the EU, and the supplementary accounting principles to be applied in accordance with Section 
315e(1) of the German Commercial Code (HGB). All of the IASB standards and interpretations, as they are to 
be applied in the EU, which are mandatory for financial years as of 1 January 2023, have been applied. 
The items contained in the financial statements of the individual Group companies are measured based on 
the currency that corresponds to the currency of the primary economic environment in which the Company 
operates. The consolidated financial statements are prepared in euros (EUR or ‚Ç¨). The presentation of 
amounts in millions of euros with one decimal place may lead to rounding differences since the calculation 
of individual items is based on figures presented in thousands. 
The cost of sales method is used for the consolidated income statement. 
The following new or amended standards and interpretations have been used for the first time in the 
current financial year:

PUMA Annual Report 2023 
‚Üó Consolidated Financial Statements 
 
283 
The amendments to the standards and interpretations described below, which were to be initially adopted 
as of 1 January 2023, did not materially affect the PUMA consolidated financial statements.  
The IFRS 17 standard regulates the accounting treatment of insurance contracts and replaces the previously 
valid transitional standard IFRS 4. The scope of application includes insurance contracts, reinsurance 
contracts and investment contracts with discretionary participation features. The amendment to IFRS 17 
postponed the date of first mandatory application of IFRS 17 to 1 January 2023. These amendments have no 
effect on the PUMA consolidated financial statements. 
The amendments to IAS 1 and IFRS Guideline Document 2 are intended to assist preparers in deciding which 
accounting policies they must disclose in the financial statements. This requires an enterprise to disclose 
essential information relating to accounting policies rather than just its significant accounting policies. This 
change has no material effect on the PUMA consolidated financial statements. 
The amendment to IAS 8 is intended to help distinguish between accounting policies and accounting-related 
estimates. The definition of a change in accounting estimates has been replaced by a definition of 
accounting estimates. According to the new definition, accounting-related estimates are "monetary 
amounts in financial statements that are subject to measurement uncertainty". This change has no effect on 
the PUMA consolidated financial statements. 
The amendment to IAS 12 narrows the scope of the "initial recognition exemption" under which no deferred 
tax assets or liabilities are to be recognised at the time of recognition of an asset or liability. If temporary 
differences of the same amount are simultaneously deductible and taxable in a single transaction, they are 
no longer covered by the exception, meaning that deferred tax assets and liabilities must be recognised. 
This change does not materially affect PUMA's net assets, financial position and results of operations. 
However, the amendment to IAS 12 leads to a change in the disclosures to be made in the notes to the 
consolidated financial statements. 
The amendment to IFRS 17 concerns companies that apply IFRS 17 and IFRS 9 simultaneously for the first 
time. The amendment allows an entity to present comparative information about a financial asset in such a 
way that the IFRS 9 rules on classification and measurement would have been previously applied to that 
financial asset. This change has no effect on the PUMA consolidated financial statements. 
The amendments to IAS 12 introduce a temporary exemption for deferred tax accounting in the framework of 
the implementation of the global minimum taxation ("OECD Pillar Two Scheme"). This should help to ensure 
the consistency of financial statements while facilitating implementation of the rules. Targeted disclosure 
requirements will also be introduced to help investors better understand the impact of the reform on the 
company, especially before the country-specific legislation implementing minimum taxation enters into 
force. This change has no material effect on the PUMA consolidated financial statements.

financing agreements expand the scope of future disclosures in the notes to the consolidated financial 
statements.

CURRENCY CONVERSION 
In general, monetary items in foreign currencies are converted in the individual financial statements of the 
Group companies at the exchange rate valid on the balance sheet date. Any resulting currency gains and 
losses are immediately recognised in the income statement. Non-monetary items are converted at 
historical acquisition and manufacturing cost. 
The assets and liabilities of foreign subsidiaries, whose functional currency is not the euro, have been 
converted to euros at the exchange rates valid on the balance sheet date. Expenses and income have been 
converted at the annual average exchange rates. Any differences resulting from the currency conversion of 
net assets relative to exchange rates that had changed in comparison with the previous year were adjusted 
directly in other comprehensive income.  
The significant conversion rates per euro are as follows:

Due to the application of accounting for hyperinflationary economies in Argentina, all items in the financial 
statements are converted at the exchange rate applicable on the reporting date. 
 
Argentina and T√ºrkiye are in a hyperinflation environment. In 2022, the subsidiaries whose functional 
currency is the Argentine peso or the Turkish lira applied the accounting for hyperinflationary economies in 
accordance with IAS 29 for the first time, with retroactive effect from 1 January 2022. The carrying amounts 
of non-monetary assets and liabilities, shareholders' equity and other comprehensive income are translated 
into the unit of measurement applicable at the balance sheet date and thus adjusted to reflect price 
changes. The financial statements are based on the concept of historical acquisition and/or production 
costs. The exchange rate as of 31 December 2023 was used for conversion into the reporting currency, the 
euro, for all items. 
Gains and losses on the net monetary position are included in the financial result. In the financial year 2023, 
the net profit from the monetary items amounted to ‚Ç¨ 7.7 million (previous year: ‚Ç¨ 0.9 million). The amount 
also includes interest income from invested liquid funds in accordance with IAS 29.28. 
The price index used for T√ºrkiye as of 31 December 2023 was 1,859.4 (31 December 2022: 1,128.5) and is based 
on the consumer price index. The general price index used for Argentina as of 31 December 2023 was 
3,500.4 (31 December 2022: 1,134.3).

ACCOUNTING AND VALUATION PRINCIPLES 
FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS 
Financial instruments are classified and recognised in accordance with IFRS 9. Acquisitions and disposals of 
financial assets, with the exception of trade receivables, are initially recognised on the settlement date and 
are recorded at fair value. 
For investments (equity instruments), IFRS 9 allows a measurement at fair value through other 
comprehensive income (FVOCI) under certain conditions. If these investments, however, are disposed of or 
adjusted in value, the gains and losses from these investments which were not realised up to this point are 
reclassified to retained earnings in accordance with IFRS 9. 
DERIVATIVE FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS/HEDGE ACCOUNTING 
In relation to the accounting of hedge relationships, PUMA made use of the option to continue applying the 
rules of IAS 39 for hedge accounting. 
Derivative financial instruments are recognised at fair value at the time a contract is entered into and 
thereafter. At the time a hedging instrument is concluded, PUMA classifies the derivatives either as hedges 
of a planned transaction and hedging variable interest flows from the promissory note loans (cash flow 
hedge accounting), or as hedges of the fair value of a recognised asset or liability (fair value hedge).  
At the time when the transaction is concluded, the hedging relationship between the hedging instrument 
and the underlying transaction as well as the purpose of risk management and the underlying strategy are 
documented. In addition, assessments as to whether the derivatives used in the hedge accounting 
compensate effectively for a change in the fair value or the cash flow of the underlying transaction are 
documented at the beginning of the hedging relationship and continuously thereafter.  
The Group designates the spot rate for forward transactions and the intrinsic value for options contracts. 
The interest component and/or fair value are excluded from the designation of the hedging instrument and 
are recorded in the financial result through profit or loss. 
The Group determines the existence of an economic relationship between the hedging instrument and the 
hedged underlying transaction on the basis of the key valuation parameters, such as the reference interest 
rate, the currency, the amount and the time of their respective cash flows (critical terms match method). 
The Group uses the cumulative dollar offset method to assess whether the derivative designated in each 
hedging relationship is expected to be prospectively effective and retroactively effective in relation to 
offsetting changes in the cash flows of the hedged underlying transaction. 
The main reason for ineffectiveness is the decline or loss of hedged transactions in these hedging 
relationships.  
Changes in the market value of derivatives that are intended and suitable for cash flow hedging and that 
prove to be effective are adjusted directly in other comprehensive income, taking into account deferred 
taxes. If there is no complete effectiveness, the ineffective part is recognised in the income statement. The 
amounts recognised in other comprehensive income are recognised in the income statement during the 
same period in which the hedged planned transaction affects the income statement. If, however, a hedged 
future transaction results in the recognition of a non-financial asset or a liability, gains or losses previously 
recorded in other comprehensive income are included in the initial measurement of the acquisition costs of 
the respective asset or liability.  
Changes in the market value of derivatives that qualify for and are designated as fair value hedges are 
recognised directly in the consolidated income statement, together with changes in the fair value of the 
underlying transaction attributable to the hedged risk. The changes in the market value of the derivatives 


PUMA Annual Report 2023 
‚Üó Consolidated Financial Statements 
293 
and the change in the underlying transaction attributable to the hedged risk are reported in the 
consolidated income statement under the item relating to the underlying transaction. 
The fair values of the derivative instruments used to secure planned transactions and for hedging the 
variable cash flows from the promissory note loans (cash flow hedge accounting) and to secure the fair 
value of a recognised asset or liability (fair value hedge) are shown under "Other current and non-current 
financial assets or liabilities". 
PUMA AS LESSEE 
The leases for which PUMA acts as a lessee are identified at the individual contract level. For these leases, 
PUMA recognises a right-of-use asset and a respective lease liability, with the exception of short-term 
leases (defined as leases with a term of no more than 12 months) and low-value lease agreements (with a 
value of less than ‚Ç¨ 5,000 at contract conclusion). In the case of a short-term lease or low-value lease, the 
Group recognises the lease payments on a straight-line basis over the term of the lease agreement as other 
operating expense. 
In addition, right-of-use assets are not recognised for intangible assets. PUMA has made use of the option 
and decided not to apply IFRS 16 with regard to leases for intangible assets. 
The lease liability at initial recognition is measured at the present value of the not yet paid lease payments 
at the beginning of the lease agreement. The present value is calculated using the incremental borrowing 
rate, as the interest rate implicit in the lease is usually not known.  
A number of lease agreements, particularly for real estate properties, contain extension and termination 
options. When determining agreement terms, all facts and circumstances are taken into account that offer a 
financial incentive to exercise the extension option or not to exercise the termination option. The changes in 
the term of a lease due to the exercise or non-exercise of such options are only taken into account for the 
agreement term if they are sufficiently certain. 
The lease liability is recognised as a separate line item on the consolidated balance sheet.  
The right-of-use assets comprise the respective lease liability as part of initial valuation. Lease instalments 
that are paid before or at the beginning of the lease are added. Lease incentives received from the lessor 
are deducted and initial direct costs are included. If dismantling obligations exist with regard to the leased 
assets, they are included in the valuation of the right-of-use assets. The subsequent valuation of the right-
of-use assets is at acquisition cost less accumulated depreciation and impairment losses. 
The right-of-use assets are generally depreciated over the term of the lease. If the useful life of the asset 
underlying the lease is shorter, this limits the depreciation period accordingly. Depreciation starts with the 
commencement of the lease. 
As part of the practical expedient, IFRS 16 permits dispensing with a separation between non-lease 
components and lease components. With regard to land and buildings, PUMA generally does not apply the 
practical expedient, meaning that the right-of-use assets relating to land and buildings only contain leasing 
components. With regard to other right-of-use assets (comprising technical equipment & machines and 
motor vehicles), the practical expedient is generally applied, the result of which is that the leasing 
components and non-leasing components are both recognised.  
The right-of-use assets are recognised as a separate line item in the consolidated balance sheet. 
The rights of use are subject to the impairment regulations pursuant to IAS 36. As a general rule, the right-
of-use assets are tested for impairment (impairment test) if there is any indication that the value of the 
asset could be impaired. The right-of-use assets, in particular in connection with the Group's own retail 
stores, are subjected to an impairment test if there are indicators or changes in planning assumptions that 


PUMA Annual Report 2023 
‚Üó Consolidated Financial Statements 
294 
suggest that the carrying amount of the assets may not be recoverable. To this end, a triggering event test 
of all retail stores, each of which is a separate cash-generating unit, is carried out after preparation of the 
annual budget planning or on an ad-hoc basis.  
For the purposes of the triggering event test, the recoverable amount of the respective retail stores is 
determined as a value in use using a simplified discounted cash flow method. The value in use is 
determined on the basis of the planned cash flows for the retail stores according to the budget, which is 
prepared on a bottom-up basis and approved by management. The forecast period is derived from the 
expected useful lives of the respective retail store and is reviewed annually. Following the bottom-up 
budget, revenue and cost developments are used as a basis for the remaining useful life, the growth rate of 
which is based on expected nominal retail growth. Growth rates in the single-digit percentage range are 
expected for all retail stores over the three-year detailed planning period. In calculating the value in use of 
retail transactions, cash flows in non-inflationary countries were measured at a weighted cost of capital 
rate of between 8.8% and 38.0% (previous year: between 8.2% and 25.3%) and the cash flows of retail 
transactions in the two high-inflation countries with a weighted cost of capital between 31.2% and 145.0% 
(previous year: between 20.0% and 62.7%). This was based on a risk-free interest rate on equivalent term 
structures of 3.1% (previous year: 2.3%) and a market risk premium of 7.0% (previous year: 7.3%) are used as 
a basis. 
If, in the triggering event test, the carrying amount of the retail store assets exceeds the simplified value in 
use, the recoverable amount of this cash-generating unit is calculated with the discounted cash flow 
method using the above cost of capital rates. This is based on the individual planning of cash flows for the 
retail store. If an impairment arises, the right of use is impaired first.  
If there are indications that retail stores for which impairment has been recorded in the past have been able 
to achieve a turnaround and that their rights of use are recoverable, the impairment is reversed up to a 
maximum of the amount of amortised costs.  
If there is an impairment loss or a reversal of an impairment loss, this is allocated to the central area in the 
segment reporting under IFRS 8. However, the impaired assets are reported in the relevant operating 
segments. 
PUMA AS LESSOR 
In financial year 2023, the accounting principles of IFRS 16 were applied for PUMA as a lessor for the first 
time. If PUMA acts as a lessor, it is determined at the beginning of the lease whether it is a finance lease or 
an operating lease. In order to classify the lease agreement, PUMA makes an overall assessment of 
whether the lease essentially transfers all the risks and benefits associated with ownership of the 
underlying asset. If this is the case, it is classified as a finance lease. If not, it is classed as an operating 
lease. Various indicators are taken into account as part of this assessment, such as whether the lease ratio 
comprises the majority of the economic useful life of the underlying asset. At our discretion, the leases in 
which PUMA acts as an intermediate lessor are in most cases finance leases, as subletting always covers 
most of the term of the main lease. If PUMA acts as an interim lessor, the shares in the main lease contract 
and the sub-lease contract are accounted for separately.   
In the case of finance leases, a net investment (receivable) equal to the discounted future rental payments 
to be received is recognised in the balance sheet and reported under other assets (without inclusion in 
working capital). The marginal debt interest rate is used to determine the discount, as the interest rate 
underlying the lease is generally unknown. Interest income from finance leases is reported in the cash flow 
from investing activities.  
If the lease is classified as operating leases, the lease payments are immediately recognised in profit or loss 
as rental income. 


PUMA Annual Report 2023 
‚Üó Consolidated Financial Statements

CASH AND CASH EQUIVALENTS 
Cash and cash equivalents include cash and bank balances. This also includes free cash and cash 
equivalents that are invested as a fixed-term deposit with a term of up to three months. The total amount of 
cash and cash equivalents is consistent with the cash and cash equivalents stated in the cash flow 
statement.  
Cash and cash equivalents are measured at amortised cost. They are subject to the impairment 
requirements in accordance with IFRS 9 "Financial Instruments". PUMA monitors the credit risk of these 
financial instruments taking into account the economic situation, external credit rating and/or premiums for 
credit default swaps (CDS) of other financial institutions. The credit risk from cash and cash equivalents is 
classified as immaterial, due to the relatively short terms and the investment-grade credit rating of the 
counterparty, which signals a low probability of default for the financial instruments. 
INVENTORIES 
The Group procures inventories primarily from third parties and these are reported as goods within 
inventories. To a small extent, footwear and golf clubs are produced in-house, which are reported as 
finished goods together with the goods within the inventories. 
Inventories are measured at acquisition or manufacturing cost or at the lower net realisable values derived 
from the selling price at the balance sheet date. The acquisition cost of merchandise is determined using an 
averaging method. Value adjustments are adequately recorded, depending on age, seasonality and 
realisable market prices. 
TRADE RECEIVABLES 
Trade receivables are initially measured at the transaction price and subsequently at amortised cost with 
deduction of value adjustments, in the form of a provision for risks. 
When determining the provision for risks for trade receivables, PUMA uniformly applies the simplified 
method in order to determine the expected credit losses over the remaining lifetime of the trade receivables 
(called "lifetime expected credit losses") in accordance with the provisions of IFRS 9 "Financial 
Instruments". For this, trade receivables are classified by geographic region into suitable groups with 
shared credit risk characteristics. The expected credit losses are calculated using a matrix that presents 
the age structure of the receivables and depicts a likelihood of loss for the individual maturity bands of the 
receivables on the basis of historic credit loss events and future-based factors. The percentage rates for the 
loss likelihoods are checked regularly to ensure they are up to date. If objective indications of a credit 
impairment are found regarding the trade receivables of a certain customer, a detailed analysis of this 
customer's specific credit risk is conducted and an individual provision for risks is established for the trade 
receivables with respect to this customer. If a credit insurance is in place, it is taken into account when 
determining the amount of the risk provision. 
The Group assumes that the default risk of a financial asset has increased significantly if it is more than 
30 days overdue. 
OTHER FINANCIAL ASSETS 
Other financial assets are classified based on the business model for control and the cash flows of the 
financial assets. In the Group, financial assets are generally held under a business model that provides for 
"holding" the asset until maturity, in order to collect the contractual cash flows. The second condition is that 
the terms and conditions of the financial asset result in cash flows at specified times, which exclusively 
represent repayments and interest payments on the outstanding nominal amount. 
The "trading" business model is used for financial assets in the form of derivatives without a hedging 
relationship. These are valued at fair value through profit or loss (FVPL). 


PUMA Annual Report 2023 
‚Üó Consolidated Financial Statements 
296 
Non-current financial assets include rental deposits and other assets. Non-interest-bearing non-current 
assets are discounted to present value if the resulting effect is significant. 
INVESTMENTS 
The investment recognised under non-current financial assets belongs to the category "measured at fair 
value through other comprehensive income" (FVOCI), since these investments are held over the long term 
for strategic reasons. 
All purchases and disposals of investments are recorded on the settlement date. Investments are initially 
recognised at fair value plus transaction costs. They are also recognised at fair value in subsequent periods. 
Unrealised gains and losses are recognised in other comprehensive income, taking into account deferred 
taxes. The gain or loss on disposal of investments is transferred to retained earnings.  
The category "measured at fair value through profit or loss" (FVPL) is not used with regard to investments. 
PROPERTY, PLANT AND EQUIPMENT 
Property, plant and equipment are measured at acquisition cost, net of accumulated depreciation. The 
depreciation period depends on the expected useful life of the respective item. The straight-line method of 
depreciation is applied. The useful life depends on the type of the assets involved. Buildings are subject to a 
useful life of between ten and fifty years, and a useful life of between three to ten years is assumed for 
movable assets. 
Repair and maintenance costs are recorded as an expense as of the date on which they were incurred. 
Substantial improvements and upgrades are capitalised to the extent that the criteria for capitalisation of an 
asset item apply. 
INVESTMENT PROPERTY 
In the financial year 2023, accounting for investment property was applied for the first time in accordance 
with IAS 40. These are accounted for in the same way as property, plant and equipment in accordance with 
the cost model, with their acquisition or production costs less scheduled depreciation and any necessary 
impairment losses. Depreciation is carried out on a straight-line basis and the useful lives are generally 
equivalent to those of property, plant and equipment used in-house. 
OTHER INTANGIBLE ASSETS (NOT INCLUDING GOODWILL) 
Acquired intangible assets largely consist of concessions, intellectual property rights and similar rights. 
These are measured at acquisition cost, net of accumulated amortisation. The useful life of intangible 
assets is between three and ten years. Scheduled depreciation is done on a straight-line basis.  
If the capitalisation requirements of IAS 38.57 "Intangible Assets" are met cumulatively, expenses in the 
development phase for internally generated intangible assets are capitalised at the time they arise. In 
subsequent periods, internally generated intangible assets and acquired intangible assets are measured at 
cost less accumulated amortisation and impairment losses. In the Group, internally generated intangible 
assets are generally depreciated on a straight-line basis over a useful life of 3 years. 
There are also trademark rights acquired for a fee in relation to Cobra Golf. Cobra Golf, founded in 1978, has 
a brand history spanning over 40 years in golf. The Cobra brand represents the core of the Golf business 
area and is continued through ongoing marketing investments by the PUMA Group in the Cobra brand. Due 
to the stability of the golf market and the continuation of the brand by PUMA, an indefinite useful life is 
assumed for the Cobra brand. 


PUMA Annual Report 2023 
‚Üó Consolidated Financial Statements 
297 
IMPAIRMENT OF ASSETS 
Intangible assets with an indefinite useful life are not amortised according to schedule but are subjected to 
an annual impairment test. Property, plant and equipment, right-of-use assets, and other intangible assets 
with finite useful lives are tested for impairment if there is any indication of impairment in the value of the 
asset concerned. In order to determine whether there is a requirement to record the impairment of an 
asset, the recoverable amount of the respective asset (the higher amount of the fair value less costs to sell 
and value in use) is compared with the carrying amount of the asset. If the recoverable amount is lower than 
the carrying amount, the difference is recorded as an impairment loss. The test for impairment is 
performed, if possible, at the level of the respective individual asset, otherwise at the level of the cash-
generating unit. Goodwill, on the other hand, is tested for impairment only at the level of a group of cash-
generating units. If it is determined within the scope of the impairment test that an asset needs to be 
impaired, then the goodwill, if any, of the group of cash-generating units is written down initially and, in a 
second step, the remaining amount is distributed proportionately over the remaining assets within the 
application scope of IAS 36. If the reason for the recorded impairment no longer applies, a reversal of 
impairment loss is recorded to the maximum amount of the amortised costs. There is no reversal of an 
impairment loss for goodwill. 
The recoverable amount is primarily calculated using the discounted cash flow method. For determining the 
fair value less costs to sell and value in use, the expected cash flows are based on corporate planning data. 
Expected cash flows are discounted using an interest rate in line with market conditions. As part of the fair 
value determination less cost to sell, no special synergies of cash-generating units are taken into account, 
and corporate planning data is adjusted to the assumptions of market participants, if required. Moreover, 
there is a difference between the fair value less costs to sell and the value in use because the costs to sell 
are also taken into account.  
Trademarks with an indefinite useful life are subjected to an impairment test based on the relief from 
royalty-method during the financial year or when the occasion arises. If there is evidence that the 
underlying Cobra business is insufficiently profitable, the trademark is not only valued individually using the 
relief from royalty-method, but the recoverable amount of the cash-generating units to which the trademark 
is attributable is determined.  
See chapter 11 for further details, in particular regarding the assumptions used for the calculation. 
BORROWINGS, OTHER FINANCIAL LIABILITIES AND OTHER LIABILITIES 
In general, these items are recognised at fair value, taking into account transaction costs, and subsequently 
recognised at amortised cost. Non-interest or low-interest-bearing liabilities with a term of at least one 
year are recognised at present value, taking into account an interest rate in line with market conditions, and 
are compounded until their maturity at their repayment amount.  
The "trading" business model is used for financial liabilities in the form of derivatives without a hedge 
relationship. These are valued at fair value through profit or loss (FVPL). 
Current borrowings also include those long-term loans that have a maximum residual term of up to one year. 
PUMA offers its suppliers a supplier financing programme. This is reverse factoring, the financing 
conditions of which are also linked to the achievement of sustainability targets by the suppliers in most 
cases. Participation in the programme is voluntary for the suppliers and helps them to already pre-finance 
the supplier invoices to PUMA from one of the partner banks against an interest discount significantly 
before the customary payment date. PUMA is not affected by the participation of the suppliers in the 
supplier financing programme (in particular no changes to the payment terms, no changes to the payment 
methods and/or no changes to the original contractual conditions). Accordingly, the liabilities are recognised 
in the balance sheet as trade payables, and cash outflows are allocated to the cash inflow from operating 
activities in the cash flow statement.  


PUMA Annual Report 2023 
‚Üó Consolidated Financial Statements 
298 
PROVISIONS FOR PENSIONS AND SIMILAR OBLIGATIONS 
In addition to defined benefit plans, some companies apply defined contribution plans, which do not result in 
any additional pension commitment other than the current contributions. The pension provision under 
defined benefit plans is generally calculated using the projected unit credit method. This method takes into 
account not only known pension benefits and pension rights accrued as of the reporting date, but also 
expected future salary and pension increases. The defined benefit obligation (DBO) is calculated by 
discounting expected future cash outflows at the rate of return on senior, fixed-rate corporate bonds. The 
currencies and maturity periods of the underlying corporate bonds are consistent with the currencies and 
maturity periods of the obligations to be satisfied. In some of the plans, the obligation is accompanied by a 
plan asset. In that case, the pension provision shown is reduced by the plan asset.  
Details regarding the assumed life expectancy, the mortality tables used and other assumptions are shown 
in chapter 15. 
OTHER PROVISIONS  
Provisions for the expected expenses from warranty obligations pursuant to the respective national sales 
contract laws are recognised at the time of sale of the relevant products, according to the best estimate in 
relation to the expenditure needed in order to fulfil the Group's obligation. 
Provisions are also made to account for onerous contracts. An onerous contract is assumed to exist where 
the unavoidable costs for fulfilling the contract exceed the economic benefit arising from this contract.  
MANAGEMENT INCENTIVE PROGRAMMES 
PUMA uses cash-settled share-based payments, share-based payments settled in cash or equities, and key 
performance indicator-based long-term incentive programmes. The share-based payments settled in cash 
or equities are accounted for in the same way as cash-settled share-based payments. 
Detailed information on the management incentive programmes is presented in Chapter 18. 
RECOGNITION OF SALES 
The Group recognises sales from the sale of sporting goods. The sales are measured at fair value of the 
consideration to which the Group expects to be entitled from the contract with customers, taking into 
account returns, discounts and rebates. Amounts collected on behalf of third parties (such as VAT) are not 
included in sales. The Group records sales at the time when PUMA fulfils its performance obligation to 
customers and has transferred the right of disposal over the product to customers. 
The Group sells footwear, apparel and accessories both to wholesalers and directly to customers through its 
own retail activities and online sales channels. Meanwhile, the sales-related warranty services cannot be 
purchased separately and do not lead to services that go beyond the assurance of the specifications at the 
time of the transfer of risk. Accordingly, the Group records warranties in the balance sheet in accordance 
with IAS 37 "Provisions, contingent liabilities and contingent assets". 
In the case of sales of products to wholesalers, the sales revenue is recorded at the date on which the right 
of disposal over the products is transferred to customers, in other words, when the products have been 
shipped to the specific location of the wholesaler (delivery). After delivery, the wholesaler bears the 
inventory risk and has full right of disposal over the manner and means of distribution and the selling price 
of the products. In the case of sales to end customers in the Group's own retail stores, the sales are 
recorded at the date when the right of disposal over the products is transferred to the end customer, in 
other words, the date on which the end customer buys the products in the retail store. The payment of the 
purchase price is due as soon as the customers purchase the products. In the case of sales of goods 
through our own online sales channels, sales are realised when the end customers have accepted the goods 
and the power of disposal over the goods has been passed to the end customer. The payment terms applied 
correspond to the standard industry payment terms for each country. 


PUMA Annual Report 2023 
‚Üó Consolidated Financial Statements 
299 
Under certain conditions and according to the contractual stipulations, customers have the option to 
exchange products or return them for a credit. The amount of the expected returns is estimated on the basis 
of past experience and is deducted from sales in the form of a liability based on refund obligations. The 
asset value of the right arising from the product return claim is recorded under inventories and leads to a 
corresponding reduction of cost of sales.  
ROYALTY AND COMMISSION INCOME 
The Group recognises license and commission income from the out-licensing of trademark rights to third 
parties in accordance with IFRS 15 Revenue from contracts with customers. Income from royalties is 
recognised in the income statement in accordance with the invoices to be submitted by the licensees. In 
certain cases, values must be estimated in order to permit accounting on an accrual basis. Commission 
income is invoiced if the underlying purchase transaction is classified as realised. 
ADVERTISING AND PROMOTIONAL EXPENSES 
Advertising expenses are recognised in the income statement at the time they are incurred. In general, 
promotional expenses stretching over several years are recognised as an expense over the contractual term 
on an accrual basis. Any expenditure surplus exceeding the economic benefit that results from this 
allocation of expenses after the balance sheet date is recognised in the financial statements in the form of 
an impairment of assets and, if necessary, a provision for anticipated losses. If promotional and advertising 
contracts provide for additional payments when predefined targets are achieved (e.g. medals, 
championships), which cannot be predicted exactly in terms of time and amount, they are recognised in full 
in profit or loss at the relevant date. 
FINANCIAL RESULT 
The financial result includes interest income from financial investments and interest expenses from loans, 
along with interest income and expenses in connection with derivative financial instruments. Financial 
results also include interest expenses from lease liabilities as well as discounted, non-current liabilities 
associated with acquisitions and those arising from the valuation of pension commitments, in addition to 
interest income from finance leases. 
Exchange rate effects that can be directly allocated to an underlying transaction are shown in the respective 
income statement item. 
INCOME TAXES 
Current income taxes are determined in accordance with the tax regulations of the respective countries 
where the individual Group companies conduct their operations. 
PUMA management regularly assesses individual tax issues to determine whether there is scope for 
interpretation in view of existing tax regulations. If appropriate, these issues are taken into account in 
income tax liabilities or deferred taxes. The income tax assessment is generally carried out at the level of 
the individual case, taking into account any possible interactions. Appropriate balance sheet provisions have 
been made for potential risks from uncertain tax positions, taking into account IFRIC 23. 
DEFERRED TAXES  
Deferred taxes resulting from temporary valuation differences between the IFRS and tax balance sheets of 
individual Group companies and from consolidation procedures, which are levied by the same taxation 
authority and can be netted, are charged to each taxable entity and recognised either as deferred tax assets 
or deferred tax liabilities.  
Deferred tax assets may also include claims for tax reductions that result from the expected utilisation of 
existing losses carried forward to subsequent years and which is likely to materialise. Deferred tax assets 
or liabilities may also result from accounting treatments that do not affect the income statement. 


PUMA Annual Report 2023 
‚Üó Consolidated Financial Statements

Deferred tax assets are recognised only to the extent that the respective tax advantage is likely to 
materialise. 
ESTIMATION UNCERTAINTY 
The preparation of the consolidated financial statements requires some assumptions and estimates that 
have an impact on the measurement and presentation of the recognised assets and liabilities, income and 
expenses, and contingent liabilities. The assumptions and estimates are based on premises, which in turn 
are based on currently available information. In individual cases, the actual values may deviate from the 
assumptions and estimates made. Consequently, future periods involve a risk of adjustment to the carrying 
amount of the assets and liabilities concerned. If the actual development differs from the expectation, the 
premises and, if necessary, the carrying amounts of the relevant assets and liabilities are adjusted with an 
effect on profit or loss.  
All assumptions and estimates are continuously reassessed. They are based on historical experiences and 
other factors, including expectations regarding future global and industry-related trends that appear 
reasonable under the current circumstances. Assumptions and estimates mainly relate to the valuation of 
goodwill and trademarks, inventories, liabilities from refund obligations, taxes and leases in which PUMA is 
the lessee. The most significant forward-looking assumptions and sources of estimation and uncertainty as 
of the reporting date concerning the above-mentioned items are discussed below. 
Goodwill and brands 
A review of the impairment of goodwill is based on the calculation of the value in use as a leading valuation 
concept. In order to calculate the value in use, the Group must estimate the future cash flows from those 
cash-generating units to which the goodwill is allocated. To this end, the data used were from the three-
year plan, which is based on forecasts of the overall economic development and the resulting industry-
specific consumer behaviour. Another key assumption concerns the determination of an appropriate 
interest rate for discounting the cash flow to present value (discounted cash flow method). The relief from 
royalty-method is used to value brands. See chapter 11 for further details, in particular regarding the 
assumptions used for the calculation. 
Inventories 
Inventories are measured at acquisition or manufacturing cost or at the lower net realisable values derived 
from the selling price at the balance sheet date. Value adjustments are adequately recorded, depending on 
age, seasonality and realisable market prices. Further details on the inventory valuation are provided in 
chapter 4. 
Liabilities from refund obligations 
The Group recognises sales from the sale of sporting goods. The sales are measured at fair value of the 
consideration to which the Group expects to be entitled from the contract with customers, taking into 
account returns, discounts and rebates. As customers have the opportunity to exchange goods under 
certain conditions and in accordance with the contractual agreements, the amount of expected return 
deliveries is estimated on the basis of experience. The accrual of sales takes place via the liability from 
refund obligations.  
Taxes 
Tax items are determined taking into account the various prevailing local tax laws and the relevant 
administrative opinions and, due to their complexity, may be subject to different interpretations by persons 
subject to tax on the one hand and the tax authorities on the other hand. Differing interpretations of tax laws 
may result in subsequent tax payments for past years; these are included based on the assessment of the 
management, using the most probable amount or the expected value for the individual case. 
The recognition of deferred taxes requires that estimates and assumptions be made concerning future tax 
planning strategies as well as expected dates of occurrence and the amount of future taxable income. The 
taxable income from the relevant corporate planning is derived for this assessment. It takes into account 


PUMA Annual Report 2023 
‚Üó Consolidated Financial Statements 
301 
the past financial position and the business development expected in the future. Deferred tax assets are 
recorded in the event of companies incurring a loss only if it is highly probable that future positive results 
will be achieved. See Chapter 8 for further information. 
PUMA as lessee 
The measurement of lease liabilities under leases in which PUMA is the lessee is based on assumptions for 
the discount rates used, the lease term and the determination of fixed lease payments. To determine the 
present value of future minimum lease payments, PUMA uses country- and currency-specific interest rates 
on borrowings with compatible terms. In addition to the basic lease period, the Group includes extension 
options in the determination of the lease term if management is sufficiently certain that such options will be 
exercised after taking into account all facts and circumstances. The fixed lease payments also include firmly 
agreed upon minimum amounts for agreements with a predominantly variable lease amount. 
DISCRETIONARY DECISIONS 
The preparation of the consolidated financial statements requires discretionary decisions relating to the 
application of accounting methods and the amounts of assets, liabilities, income and expenses reported. 
Information on the application of accounting policies that have the most material impact on the amounts 
recorded in the financial statements can be found in the following notes: 
Evaluation of the control of companies with non-controlling interests 
The determination as to whether the Group controls the companies with non-controlling interests is 
presented in chapter 28, Information on non-controlling interests. 
PUMA as lessee 
The accounting for leases in which PUMA is the lessee includes discretionary decisions, in particular in 
relation to the term of the lease agreements with regard to determining whether the exercise of extension 
options is sufficiently certain. 
Some real estate leases contain extension options that can only be exercised by PUMA and not by the lessor. 
If possible, the Group seeks to include extension options when concluding new leases in order to ensure 
operational flexibility. On the date of provision, the Group assesses whether it is sufficiently certain that the 
extension options will be exercised. The assessment is carried out individually for each contract and takes 
into account the amount of the company's own investments and the possibility of changing macroeconomic 
conditions in the future. If significant events or significant changes occur during the term of the contract 
that are within PUMA's control, it will be reassessed as to whether it is sufficiently certain that the extension 
option will be exercised. 
Significant discretionary decisions are made in the subsequent valuation of rights of use for retail stores in 
the context of assessing the existence of an impairment and determining the impairment requirement. 
Among other things, assumptions are made about the duration of the lease, the future economic 
development and profitability of the retail stores, and also the underlying interest rate.

NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED STATEMENT OF 
FINANCIAL POSITION 
3. CASH AND CASH EQUIVALENTS 
As of 31 December 2023, the Group has ‚Ç¨ 552.9 million (previous year: ‚Ç¨ 463.1 million) in cash and cash 
equivalents. This includes bank balances, including short-term financial investments with an original term 
of up to three months. The average effective interest rate of the financial investments was 1.1% (previous 
year: 1.7%) for countries without hyperinflation. In countries with hyperinflation, the average effective 
interest rate of financial investments was 40.9% (previous year: 33.4%). Due to currency exchange controls, 
transfer restrictions of ‚Ç¨ 45.6 million (previous year: ‚Ç¨ 93.3 million) were placed on the cash and cash 
equivalents reported.

The table shows the carrying amounts of the inventories net of value adjustments. Of the value adjustments 
in the amount of ‚Ç¨ 157.1 million (previous year: ‚Ç¨ 217.0 million) approx. 64.3% (previous year: approx. 67.5%) 
were recognised as an expense under cost of sales in financial year 2023. The volume of inventories 
recorded as an expense during the period mainly includes the cost of sales shown in the consolidated 
income statement. 
The inventory adjustments related to returns represents the historical acquisition or production costs of the 
inventories for which a return is expected.

With respect to the net carrying amounts of trade receivables, PUMA assumes that the debtors will satisfy 
their payment obligations or that, in the event of a default, the net carrying amount will be covered by 
existing credit insurance. There are no significant risk concentrations as the customer base is very broad 
and there are no correlations.

In order to better provide decision-relevant information, the data ‚Äì including the previous year's figures ‚Äì has been 
adjusted. 
As of 31 December 2023, tax losses carried forward amounted to a total of ‚Ç¨ 447.9 million (previous year: 
‚Ç¨ 360.7 million). Deferred tax assets were recognised for these items in the amount at which the associated 
tax advantages are likely to be realised in the form of future profits for income tax purposes. In financial 
year 2023, no deferred tax items were recognised for the losses carried forward in the amount of  


PUMA Annual Report 2023 
‚Üó Consolidated Financial Statements 
306 
‚Ç¨ 102.9 million (previous year: ‚Ç¨ 93.5 million), of which ‚Ç¨ 94.5 million (previous year: ‚Ç¨ 88.2 million) are 
vested. The remaining tax losses carried forward, for which no deferred tax items were recognised, in the 
amount of ‚Ç¨ 8.3 million (previous year: ‚Ç¨ 5.3 million) will expire within the next six years
1.
  
In addition, no deferred tax items were recognised for temporary differences in the amount of ‚Ç¨ 27.0 million 
(previous year: ‚Ç¨ 22.6 million) because they were not expected to be realised as of the balance sheet date. 
For Group companies that achieved a negative tax result in this or the previous financial year, a total of 
deferred tax assets in the amount of ‚Ç¨ 157.1 million were recognised after deduction of any deferred tax 
liabilities (previous year: ‚Ç¨ 70.0 million) as sufficiently positive tax results can be expected in the future on 
the basis of the relevant projections. 
No deferred taxes on retained profits at subsidiaries were recognised where these gains are to be 
reinvested on an ongoing basis and there is no intention to make a distribution in this respect. 
Deferred tax assets and liabilities are netted if they relate to a taxable entity and can in fact be netted. 
Accordingly, they are shown in the balance sheet as follows:

properties as of 31 December 2023 is ‚Ç¨ 23.3 million (previous year: ‚Ç¨ 0.0 million). This was determined by 
external, independent experts who have relevant professional qualifications and current experience with the 
location and type of properties to be valued. The fair value was determined on the basis of the market-
comparative approach, which reflects the most recent transaction prices for similar properties. 
The rental income generated by the Group from investment properties amounted to ‚Ç¨ 0.6 million in the 
financial year (previous year: ‚Ç¨ 0.0 million). Direct operating expenses for investment properties, which 
generated rental income in the financial year, amounted to ‚Ç¨ 0.0 million (previous year: ‚Ç¨ 0.0 million).

Variable lease payments are incurred in connection with the Group's own retail stores. These are based on 
the sales amount and are therefore dependent on the overall economic development. 
Total cash outflows from lease liabilities in 2023 amounted to ‚Ç¨ 254.8 million (previous year: ‚Ç¨ 228.7 million). 
Due to reduced earnings prospects based on updated financial planning and estimates as well as retail 
store closures, impairment expenses in the total amount of ‚Ç¨ 5.7 million were recorded for the right of use 
of assets in connection with PUMA's own retail stores in financial year 2023 (previous year: ‚Ç¨ 25.4 million). 
To determine the impairment, the recoverable amount was calculated for the individual retail stores. This 
amounted to ‚Ç¨ 65.3 million for impaired retail stores (previous year: ‚Ç¨ 111.4 million). In the financial year, 
impairment reversals in the amount of ‚Ç¨ 11.9 million (previous year: ‚Ç¨ 0.0 million) were recorded for retail 
stores. There were no impairment losses or impairment reversals in the other categories of right-of-use 
assets. 
In 2023, PUMA entered into lease agreements that had not yet commenced by year-end. As a result, no 
lease liabilities and corresponding right-of-use assets had been recognised as of 31 December 2023. Future 
lease payments in connection with these agreements amount to ‚Ç¨ 2.0 million (previous year: ‚Ç¨ 2.6 million) 
for the next year, ‚Ç¨ 28.2 million for years two to five (previous year: ‚Ç¨ 13.7 million) and ‚Ç¨ 48.5 million for the 
subsequent period (previous year: ‚Ç¨ 8.7 million). The lease terms for these are up to 15 years.

PUMA AS LESSOR 
PUMA rents out properties owned and leased as a lessor. From the lessor's point of view, these (sub)leases 
are classified as operating or finance leases. In the previous year, PUMA did not rent out any properties.  
The net investments from finance leases are shown as receivables in the balance sheet and are reduced by 
the repayment portion included in the lease payment. The interest portion included in the lease payment is 
reported as interest income in the financial result.

The item Other intangible assets includes advance payments in the amount of ‚Ç¨ 21.6 million (previous year: 
‚Ç¨ 5.6 million).  
The current amortisation of intangible assets in the amount of ‚Ç¨ 37.0 million (previous year: ‚Ç¨ 36.3 million) is 
included in the other operating expenses. Of this, ‚Ç¨ 11.5 million relate to sales and distribution expenses 
(previous year: ‚Ç¨ 7.7 million), ‚Ç¨ 0.1 million to expenses for product management/merchandising (previous 
year: ‚Ç¨ 0.1 million), ‚Ç¨ 0.0 to development expenses (previous year: ‚Ç¨ 1.9 million), and ‚Ç¨ 25.3 million to 
administrative and general expenses (previous year: ‚Ç¨ 26.5 million). 
INFORMATION ON PLANNING ASSUMPTIONS FOR IMPAIRMENT TESTS 
Goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite useful lives are not amortised according to schedule. 
Impairment tests with regard to goodwill were performed in the past financial year using the discounted 
cash flow method. The data from the three-year plan for the respective cash-generating unit or group of 
cash-generating units was used as a basis for this. Planning on the level of the cash-generating units was 
thereby derived from the PUMA Group's three-year plan. The following key assumptions have been made for 
the PUMA Group plans: 
Based on the basic assumptions regarding overall economic development, planning at Group level assumes 
that geopolitical tensions will not increase any further. Under these conditions, we expect our business to 
continue to grow profitably.  
Planned sales growth is based on the good future growth prospects in the sporting goods industry and on 
market share gains by PUMA. This is to be achieved, in particular, via the continued consistent 
implementation of the Forever Faster corporate strategy and the increase in PUMA's brand heat.  
The improvement in EBIT margin in the planning period is the result of a slight increase in gross profit 
margin due to, for example, a higher share of own retail sales as a result of above-average growth of the e-
commerce distribution channel. Furthermore, the slightly weaker percentage increase of other operating 


PUMA Annual Report 2023 
‚Üó Consolidated Financial Statements 
315 
income and expenses compared to sales growth is also expected to contribute to the improvement of the 
EBIT margin; for example, the operating requirements for planned sales growth over the coming years have 
essentially been met, meaning that economies of scale can be realised.  
The planning of investments and working capital is based on historical experience and is carried out in 
accordance with strategic objectives.  
The future tax payments are based on current tax rates in the respective country. 
For periods beyond the three-year plan, an annual growth rate is determined and used to forecast future 
cash flows beyond the three-year period. The assumed growth rate is based on long-term expectations of 
inflation rates and does not exceed the long-term average growth rates for the business area in which the 
respective cash-generating unit, or group of cash-generating units, operates. 
The recoverable amount for the respective cash-generating unit or group of cash-generating units was 
determined on the basis of the value-in-use. This did not result in impairment losses for any cash-
generating units. 
INTANGIBLE ASSETS WITH AN INDEFINITE USEFUL LIFE 
In connection with the Golf business unit (CPG ‚Äì Cobra PUMA Golf), the Cobra brand exists as an intangible 
asset with an indefinite useful life amounting to ‚Ç¨ 128.7 million (previous year: ‚Ç¨ 133.4 million). The carrying 
amount of the Cobra brand is significant in comparison to the overall carrying amount of the intangible 
assets with an indefinite useful life. It was assigned to the North America business segment, where the 
headquarters of Cobra PUMA Golf is located. The recoverable amount of the Cobra brand was determined 
using the relief from royalty-method (level 3 ‚Äì see explanation in chapter 14). A discount rate of 10.6% p.a. 
(previous year: 9.4% p.a.), a royalty rate of 6.0% (previous year: 8.0%) and a sustainable 2.0% growth rate 
(previous year: 2.0%) was used. Cobra or CPG's three-year plan shows average revenue growth in the high 
single-digit percentage range. The Management's key assumptions about improvement in the EBIT margin 
in Cobra's or CPG's three-year plan are essentially in line with the fundamental assumptions in the plans at 
Group level.  
A reduction of the royalty rate to approximately 5.4% or a reduction of the average planned sales revenues 
by approx. 10.3% would not result in any impairment requirement for the Cobra brand, and the recoverable 
amount would correspond to the carrying amount. 
If there is evidence that the underlying Cobra business is insufficiently profitable, the trademark is not only 
valued individually using the relief from royalty-method, but the recoverable amount of the cash-generating 
units to which the trademark is attributable is determined. In 2023, there were no indications of an 
impairment.

capital, taking into account a standard market capital structure (ratio of debt to equity) and including the 
most important listed competitors (peer group).  
In addition, a growth rate of 2.0% (previous year: 2.0%) is generally assumed. A growth rate of less than 
2.0% (previous year: less than 2.0%) was applied only in justified exceptional cases, where the long-term 
expectations on inflation rate for the country in which the cash-generating unit operates were lower than 
the assumed growth rate; this applies, in particular, to the UK, Japan and Taiwan. 
The cash-generating unit stichd includes goodwill of ‚Ç¨ 139.4 million (previous year: ‚Ç¨ 139.4 million), which is 
significant in comparison to the overall carrying amount of goodwill. The recoverable amount was 
determined by a value-in-use calculation with a discount rate of 10.2% p.a. (previous year: 9.4% p.a.) and a 
growth rate of 2.0% (previous year: 2.0%). Stichd's three-year plan shows sales growth in the low double-
digit percentage range. In the three-year plan for stichd, a lower improvement in the EBIT margin is 
expected compared to the Group, as the EBIT margin of stichd is already higher than for the Group as a 
whole.  
The cash-generating unit PUMA Japan includes goodwill of ‚Ç¨ 35.0 million (previous year: ‚Ç¨ 38.9 million), 
which is significant in comparison to the overall carrying amount of goodwill. The recoverable amount was 
determined by a value-in-use calculation with a discount rate of 10.5% p.a. (previous year: 9.4% p.a.) and a 
growth rate of 1.2% (previous year: 1.0%). PUMA Japan's three-year plan shows sales growth in the high 
single-digit percentage range. PUMA Japan's three-year plan shows that the company expects a strong 
improvement in the EBIT margin and a return to the historical profitability level of PUMA Japan.

Financial instruments that are measured at fair value in the balance sheet were determined using the 
following hierarchy: 
Level 1: Use of prices quoted on active markets for identical assets or liabilities. 
Level 2: Use of input factors that do not involve the quoted prices stated under level 1, but can be observed 
for the asset or liability either directly (i.e. as the price) or indirectly (i.e. derived from the price). 
Level 3: Use of factors for the valuation of the asset or liability that are based on non-observable market 
data. 
Reclassification between different levels of the fair value hierarchy are recorded at the end of the reporting 
period in which the change occurred. 
The fair value of the investments held for strategic reasons only refers to equity instruments of the category 
"fair value through OCI" (FVOCI) and is determined on the basis of level 1. The market values of the 
derivative assets and liabilities as well as the fair value of the promissory note loans were determined in 
accordance with level 2.

The fair values are determined on the basis of 
current market parameters, i.e., reference prices 
observable on the market, taking into account 
forward premiums and discounts. The discounted 
result of the comparison of the forward price on the 
reporting date with the forward price of the 
valuation date is included in the measurement.  
The fair values are also checked for the 
counterparty's non-performance risk. In doing this, 
PUMA calculates credit value adjustments (CVA) or 
debt value adjustments (DVA) on the basis of an 
up/down method, taking current market information 
into account, in particular the creditworthiness of 
the company's business partners. No material 
deviations were found, so that no adjustments were 
made to the fair value determined.

Cash and cash equivalents, trade receivables and other receivables have short maturities. Accordingly, as of 
the reporting date, the carrying amount approximates fair value. Receivables are stated at nominal value, 
taking into account deductions for default risk. 
The fair values of other financial assets correspond to their carrying amount, as the interest calculation 
occurs at the prevailing market interest rates on the balance sheet date. Other (current and non-current) 
financial assets include ‚Ç¨ 40.3 million (previous year: ‚Ç¨ 37.8 million) that were pledged as rental deposits at 
usual market rates.  
Trade payables have short residual maturities; their carrying amounts therefore approximate fair value. 
The remaining financial liabilities have short residual maturities; the recognised amounts therefore 
approximate fair value.

DISCLOSURES RELATING TO FINANCIAL RISKS 
The PUMA Group is exposed to the following risks from the use of financial instruments: 
‚Ä¢ Default risk 
‚Ä¢ Liquidity risk 
‚Ä¢ Market risk 
These risks and the principles of risk management are explained below. 
PRINCIPLES OF RISK MANAGEMENT 
The Management Board of PUMA SE is responsible for developing and monitoring risk management in the 
PUMA Group. To this end, the Management Board has set up a Risk Management Committee that is 
responsible for designing, reviewing and adapting the risk management system. The Risk Management 
Committee regularly reports to the Management Board on its work. 
The guidelines for the risk management system define the responsibilities, tasks and processes of the risk 
management system. The guidelines for the risk management system and the risk management system 
itself are reviewed regularly in order to be able to pick up on any changes in market conditions and PUMA's 
activities and incorporate them accordingly.  
The Audit Committee, on the one hand, monitors the Management Board's compliance with the guidelines 
and the Group risk management processes. On the other hand, the Audit Committee monitors the 
effectiveness of the risk management system with regard to the risks to which the PUMA Group is exposed. 
The Internal Audit department supports the Audit Committee in its monitoring tasks. To this end, regular 
audits and ad hoc audits are also carried out by the Internal Audit department. Their results are reported 
directly to the Audit Committee. 


PUMA Annual Report 2023 
‚Üó Consolidated Financial Statements

DEFAULT RISK 
Default risk is the risk of financial losses if a customer or party to a financial instrument fails to meet its 
contractual obligations. Default risk arises in principle from trade receivables and from other contractual 
financial obligations of the counterparty, such as bank deposits and derivative financial instruments. 
Without taking into account any existing credit insurance policies or other guarantees received, the 
maximum default risk is equal to the carrying amount of the financial assets. 
At the end of financial year 2023, there was no relevant concentration of default risk by customer type or 
region. Default risk is mainly influenced by individual customer characteristics. In accordance with our 
credit guidelines, new customers are checked for creditworthiness before we offer them our regular 
payment and delivery terms. In addition, we set specific receivables limits for each customer. In particular, 
the international credit insurance programme that PUMA has concluded for all major subsidiaries 
contributes to risk mitigation. The creditworthiness of our customers and the limits on receivables are 
monitored on an ongoing basis, which also includes requests for individual credit limits from credit 
insurance providers for all customers who have external accounts that exceed a certain value limit. The 
credit insurer's response to such credit limit requests always includes information on the creditworthiness. 
Customers with a credit rating that does not meet the minimum requirements set may, as a rule, only 
acquire products against advance payment. 
Further activities to reduce default risk include retention of title clauses, and also in individual cases the 
selective sale of trade receivables (without recourse) and the obtaining of bank guarantees or parent 
company guarantees for our customers. 
At the end of the financial year 2023, no individual customers accounted for more than 10% of trade 
receivables. 
The central Treasury department has a comprehensive overview of the banks involved in currency hedging 
instruments and the management of cash and cash equivalents. Business with banks is focused on core 
banks with the appropriate credit rating (currently a minimum rating of BBB+ or better), while maximum 
risk amounts are specified for banks that have also been engaged in addition to this. The counterparty risks 
resulting from this are reviewed at least once every six months.  
PUMA held derivative financial instruments with a positive market value of ‚Ç¨ 35.8 million in 2023 (previous 
year: ‚Ç¨ 118.3 million). The maximum default risk for an individual bank from such assets amounted to  
‚Ç¨ 7.5 million (previous year: ‚Ç¨ 24.8 million). 
In accordance with IFRS 7, the following table contains further information on the offsetting options for 
derivative financial assets and liabilities. Most agreements between financial institutions and PUMA include 
a mutual right to offsetting; the right to offsetting is only enforceable in the event of the default of a business 
partner. Therefore, the criteria for offsetting in the balance sheet are not met.

LIQUIDITY RISK 
Liquidity risk is the risk that the Group may not be able to meet its financial liabilities by delivering cash or 
other financial assets in accordance with the agreement. The objective of the Group in managing liquidity is 
to ensure that, as far as possible, sufficient cash and cash equivalents are always available in order to meet 
the payment obligations upon maturity, under both normal and strained conditions. 
PUMA aims to maintain the amount of cash, cash equivalents and fixed loan commitments at a level that 
covers the effects of an assumed worst-case scenario. This scenario is based on the events and financial 
impact of the COVID-19 crisis in Q2 2020, which must be covered accordingly. 
PUMA has confirmed credit lines amounting to a total of ‚Ç¨ 1,552.8 million (previous year: ‚Ç¨ 1,271.0 million), of 
which ‚Ç¨ 986.1 million had not been used as at 31 December 2023 (previous year: ‚Ç¨ 943.7 million). 
No financial liabilities were utilised from credit lines granted only until further notice. 
The effective interest rate of the financial liabilities ranged from 0.0% to 1.3% (previous year: 0.0% to 0.9%).

MARKET RISK 
Market risk is the risk that market prices, such as exchange rates, share prices or interest rates, may 
change, thereby affecting the income of the Group or the value of the financial instruments held. 
The aim of market risk management is to manage and control market risk within acceptable margins while 
optimising returns. 
To manage market risks, PUMA acquires and sells derivatives and also enters into financial liabilities. All 
transactions are carried out within the framework of the Group's risk management regulations. 
 


PUMA Annual Report 2023

CURRENCY RISK 
PUMA is exposed to transactional foreign currency risks such that the quoted currencies used for 
acquisition, disposal and credit transactions and for receivables do not match the functional currency of the 
Group companies.  
In financial year 2023, PUMA designated currency hedges in Cashflow Hedge Accounting in order to hedge 
the amount payable of purchases denominated in USD, and converted to euros, as well as for other currency 
risks resulting from internal resale to PUMA subsidiaries. 
Furthermore, currency swaps and forward exchange contracts are used to hedge foreign exchange risks 
when measuring intra-group loans denominated in foreign currencies. 
The estimated foreign currency risks are initially subjected to a quantitative materiality test, while 
simultaneously taking hedging costs into account. Material risks are then hedged, in accordance with the 
Group directive, up to a hedging ratio of up to 95% of the estimated foreign currency risks from expected 
acquisition and disposal transactions over the next 12 to 15 months. Forward exchange contracts and 
currency options, usually with a term of around 12 months from the reporting date, are used to hedge the 
foreign currency risk. For significant risks that are subject to large hedging costs, high hedging ratios can 
only be achieved over shorter terms. 
The summarised quantitative information about the Group's currency risk is as follows:

Currency sensitivity analysis 
In order to disclose market risks, IFRS 7 requires sensitivity analysis that show the effects of hypothetical 
changes in relevant risk variables on earnings and equity. The periodic effects are determined by relating 
the hypothetical changes caused by the risk variables to the balance of the financial instruments held as of 
the balance sheet date. The underlying assumption is that the balance as of the balance sheet date is 
representative for the entire year. 
Currency risks as defined by IFRS 7 arise on account of financial instruments that are denominated in a 
currency which differs from the functional currency and are monetary in nature. Differences resulting from 


PUMA Annual Report 2023 
‚Üó Consolidated Financial Statements 
330 
the conversion of the individual financial statements to the group currency are not taken into account. All 
non-functional currencies in which PUMA employs financial instruments are generally considered to be 
relevant risk variables. 
The currency sensitivity analysis is based on the net balance sheet risk denominated in foreign currencies. 
This also includes intra-company monetary assets and liabilities. Outstanding currency derivatives are also 
reassessed as part of the sensitivity analysis.  
The following table shows the increase or decrease of profit or loss or cash flow hedge reserve in equity in 
the event of a 10% appreciation or depreciation against the euro spot price. It is assumed that all other 
influencing factors, including interest rates and commodity prices, remain constant. The effects of the 
forecasted operating cash flows are also ignored.

INTEREST-RATE RISKS 
The interest rate risk in the PUMA Group is primarily attributable to variable-interest borrowings. Interest 
rate management is carried out centrally by the Treasury division on the basis of specified limits. Within this 
framework, the division manages and monitors interest rate risk through the use of interest rate 
derivatives. Transactions are only concluded with counterparties that are creditworthy. Derivatives financial 
instruments must not be used for speculative purposes, but only to hedge risks related to underlying 
transactions. 


PUMA Annual Report 2023 
‚Üó Consolidated Financial Statements 
331 
As of 31 December 2023, ‚Ç¨ 207.5 million (previous year: ‚Ç¨ 67.5 million) of the borrowings were subject to 
variable interest. 
Interest rate collars were also concluded at the same amount and with the same maturity to hedge the risk 
of interest rate changes for the variable interest-rate promissory note tranches in the amount of 
‚Ç¨ 150.0 million in May 2023. 
There is an economic relationship between the underlying and hedging transactions, since the terms of the 
interest-rate collars correspond to those of the floating-rate loans. This applies to the nominal amount, 
maturity, payment and interest adjustment dates. The underlying risk of interest rate collars is identical to 
that of the hedged risk components. A hedge ratio of 1:1 has therefore been established for the hedging 
relationship. 
The net risk position and the average hedged interest rate are as follows:

As there were no significant variable interest-bearing liabilities in the previous year and no interest hedging 
transactions were therefore used, the information for the previous year is not applicable. 
Interest sensitivity analysis 
The result in the Group depends on the development of the market interest rate level. A change in the 
interest rate level would have an impact on the Group's income and equity. The analysis carried out includes 
all interest-bearing financial instruments that are subject to interest rate risk. 
A change in the interest rate level of 100 basis points would have the following effects on profit or loss and

A small portion of the originally planned sourcing and sales volume in foreign currencies did not transpire, 
leading to an excess of hedging transactions. Hedge accounting was terminated for those sourcing and 
sales transactions that were no longer expected to transpire, and the fair value was transferred as a profit 
or loss from the cash flow hedge reserve to the income statement. As soon as any highly likely sourcing or 
sales transaction is no longer expected to transpire, an offsetting transaction is concluded. Across all 
currency pairs, an amount of ‚Ç¨ 5.5 million (previous year: ‚Ç¨ -14.8 million) was recognised in the income 
statement.

15. PENSION PROVISIONS 
Pension provisions result from employees' claims and, if applicable, their survivors, for benefits which are 
based on the statutory or contractual regulations applicable in the respective country in the event of 
invalidity, death or when a certain retirement age has been reached. Pension commitments in the PUMA 
Group include both benefit- and contribution-based pension commitments and include both obligations 
from current pensions and rights to pensions payable in the future. The pension entitlements are financed 
by both provisions and funds. 
The risks associated with the pension commitments mainly concern the usual risks of benefit-based 
pension plans in relation to possible changes in the discount rate and inflation trends, and recipient 
longevity. In order to limit the risks of changed capital market conditions and demographic developments, 
plans with the maximum obligations were agreed or insured for new hires a few years ago in Germany and 
Great Britain. The specific risk of obligations based on salary is low within the PUMA Group. The 
introduction of an annual cap for pensionable salary in the Great Britain plan in 2016 covers this risk for the 
highest obligations. The Great Britain plan is therefore classified as a non-salary obligation.

The main pension arrangements are described below: 
The general pension scheme of PUMA SE essentially provides for pension payments to a maximum amount 
of ‚Ç¨ 127.82 per month and per eligible employee. It was closed for new members beginning in 1996. In 
addition, PUMA SE provides individual commitments (fixed sums in different amounts) as well as 
contribution-based individual benefits (in part from salary conversion). The contribution-based individual 
benefits are insured plans. There are no statutory minimum funding requirements. The scope of obligation 
for domestic pension claims amounts to ‚Ç¨ 57.5 million at the end of 2023 (previous year: ‚Ç¨ 56.8 million) and 
thus comprises 53.6% of the total obligation. The fair value of the plan assets relative to domestic 
obligations amounts to ‚Ç¨ 50.4 million. The corresponding pension provision amounts to ‚Ç¨ 7.1 million. 
The defined benefit plan in Great Britain has not been available to new hires since 2006. This defined benefit 
plan includes salary and length of service-based commitments to provide old age, invalidity and surviving 
dependents' retirement benefits. In 2016, a growth cap of 1% p.a. was introduced on the pensionable salary. 
Partial capitalisation of the old-age pension is permitted. There are statutory minimum funding 
requirements. The obligations regarding pension claims under the defined benefit plan in the UK amount to 
‚Ç¨ 31.9 million at the end of 2023 (previous year: ‚Ç¨ 29.6 million) and thus account for 29.7% of the total 
obligation. The obligation is covered by assets amounting to ‚Ç¨ 29.7 million. The provision amounts to  
‚Ç¨ 2.2 million.

Plan assets still do not include the Group's own financial instruments or real estate used by Group 
companies.  
The plan assets are used exclusively to meet defined pension commitments. Legal requirements exist in 
some countries for the type and amount of financial resources that can be chosen; in other countries (for 
example Germany) the financing of pension commitments can be chosen freely. In Great Britain, a board of 
trustees made up of company representatives and employees is in charge of asset management. Its 
investment strategy is aimed at long-term profits and tolerable volatility. It was last revised in 2022 to 
reduce the risk profile. In 2023, the trustees continued to monitor the investment strategy.

The warranty provision is determined on the basis of the historical value of sales generated during the past six months. It is expected that the majority of these expenses 
will fall due within the first six months of the next financial year. Purchasing risks relate primarily to materials and moulds that are required for the manufacturing of 
shoes. 
Personnel provisions mainly relate to non-current variable compensation components. The risks arising from legal disputes relate to any form of legal dispute, including 
those relating to trademark and patent rights. The other provisions relate to other risks, in particular those associated with sourcing.  
Current provisions are expected to be paid out in the following year, non-current provisions are expected to be paid out in a period of up to ten years. There are no 
significant compounding effects. The recognition and valuation of provisions is based on past experience of similar transactions. All events until the preparation of the 
consolidated financial statements are taken into account here.

TREASURY STOCK 
The resolution adopted by the Annual General Meeting on 7 May 2020 authorised the Company to purchase 
treasury shares up to a value of 10% of the share capital until 6 May 2025. By resolution of the Annual 
General Meeting of 5 May 2021, the Supervisory Board was authorised to issue the acquired shares to the 
members of the Management Board of the Company, excluding the shareholders' subscription rights. By 
resolution of the Annual General Meeting of 11 May 2022, the Management Board was, moreover, authorised 
to issue the acquired shares, excluding the shareholders' subscription rights, as part of the Company's or 
its affiliated companies' share-based payments or employee share programmes to individuals currently or 
formerly in an employment relationship with the Company or one of its affiliated companies or to members 
of the management of one of the Company's affiliated companies. If purchased through the stock exchange, 
the purchase price per share must not exceed 10% or fall below 20% of the average closing price for the 
Company's shares with the same attributes in the XETRA trading system (or a comparable successor 
system) during the last three trading days prior to the date of purchase.  
The Company did not make use of the authorisation to purchase treasury stock during the reporting period.  
As of the balance sheet date, the Company holds a total of 980,096 PUMA shares in its own portfolio, which 
corresponds to 0.65% of the subscribed capital. 
 
AUTHORISED CAPITAL 
As of 31 December 2023, the Company's Articles of Association provide for authorised capital totalling  
‚Ç¨ 30,000,000.00:  
Pursuant to Section 4.2. of the Articles of Association, the Management Board is authorised, with the 
consent of the Supervisory Board, to increase the Company's share capital by 4 May 2026 by up to  
‚Ç¨ 30,000,000.00 (Authorised Capital 2021) by issuing new no-par value bearer shares against cash and/or 
non-cash contributions on one or more occasions. In the case of capital increases against contributions in 
cash, the new shares may be acquired by one or several banks, designated by the Management Board, 
subject to the obligation to offer them to the shareholders for subscription (indirect subscription right). The 
shareholders shall generally be entitled to subscription rights. However, the Management Board is 
authorised, with the consent of the Supervisory Board, to exclude shareholders' subscription rights in whole 
or in part in the cases specified in Section 4.2. of the Articles of Association.  
The Management Board of PUMA SE did not make use of the existing authorised capital in the current

By resolution of the Annual General Meeting of 11 May 2022, the Management Board was authorised until  
10 May 2027, with the consent of the Supervisory Board, through one or more issues, altogether or in parts 
and in various tranches at the same time, to issue bearer or registered convertible and/or option bonds, 
profit-sharing rights or participation bonds or a combination of these instruments with or without a term 
limitation in a total nominal amount of up to ‚Ç¨ 1,500,000,000.00.  
The share capital was conditionally increased by up to ‚Ç¨ 15,082,464.00 by issuing up to 15,082,464 new no-par 
value bearer shares (Conditional Capital 2022). The conditional capital increase shall only be implemented

The current programmes are described below: 
EXPLANATION OF "VIRTUAL SHARES", TERMED "MONETARY UNITS" (FULL TERM: MONETARY UNITS 
PLAN ‚Äì MUP) 
Monetary units were granted on an annual basis to members of the Management Board beginning in 2013 as 
part of a management incentive programme. Monetary units are based on the PUMA share performance. 
Each of these monetary units entitles the holder to a cash payment at the end of the term. The entitled cash 
payment compares the performance using the average virtual appreciation rights of the last thirty trading 
days before the start of the year of issue with the virtual appreciation rights of the last thirty trading days 
before the exercise date. The maximum increase in value (cap) is limited to 300% of the amount allocated. 
Monetary units are subject to a vesting period of three years. After that, there is an exercise period 
beginning 30 days after each quarterly publication date for a period of two years which can be freely used by 
participants for the purposes of execution. Virtual shares are reduced on a "pro rata" basis in the event of 
withdrawal during the vesting period. This programme will expire and be replaced by the Performance 
Share Plan. As a result, no more shares were issued from this programme in financial year 2023. 
 
EXPLANATION OF "VIRTUAL SHARES" (FULL TERM: PERFORMANCE SHARE PLAN ‚Äì PSP) 
Virtual shares were granted on an annual basis to members of the Management Board beginning in 2021 as 
part of a management incentive programme. The virtual shares are based on the PUMA share performance. 
Each of these virtual shares entitles the holder to a cash payment at the end of the term. However, the 
Supervisory Board reserves the right to make the payment in PUMA shares instead of cash. This cash 
payout is based on the PUMA closing prices for the last thirty trading days before the exercise date. The final 
number of virtual shares is between 50% and 150%, depending on the relative "Total Shareholder Returns" 
(TSR) compared to the MDAX index. The PUMA and MDAX index TSRs are calculated using the arithmetic 
means of each of the TSR values on the 30 trading days before the start and end of the performance period. 
The averages calculated in this way for PUMA and the MDAX index are then compared with each other. The 
difference in percentage points between the PUMA TSR and the MDAX index TSR is then calculated (= TSR 
outperformance in percentage points). The maximum increase in value (cap) is limited to 300% of the 
amount allocated. Virtual shares are subject to a vesting period of four years. They are generally paid out 
within the first quarter of the fifth year after their issue. Virtual shares are reduced on a "pro rata" basis in 
the event of withdrawal during the vesting period. For the programmes issued in the financial years 2021 
and 2022, the DAX acts as the basis for calculating virtual shares, while the MDAX index is used starting 
financial year 2023.

This commitment consisting of share-based remuneration transactions with cash compensation is recorded as personnel provisions and remeasured at fair value on 
every balance sheet date, provided it has not been exercised yet. The expenses are recorded pro rata over the vesting period. Based on the prorated average market price 
over the last thirty trading days in 2023 and taking into account the intra-year exercises in 2023, the provisions for these programmes amounted to ‚Ç¨ 4.4 million at the end 
of the financial year (previous year: ‚Ç¨ 5.8 million).

EXPLANATION OF THE "GAME CHANGER 2.0" PROGRAMME 
In 2018, the Long-Term Incentive Programme (LTIP) "Game Changer 2.0" was launched. Participants in this 
programme consist mainly of top executives reporting to the Management Board and individual key 
positions in the PUMA Group. The objective of this programme is to retain these employees in the Company 
on a long-term basis and to allow them to share in the medium-term success of the Company. 
The LTIP "Game Changer 2.0" consists of two plan parts, a Performance Cash Plan and a Performance 
Share Plan, each with a 50% share. The Performance Cash Plan gives a reward for the PUMA Group's 
financial performance, while the Performance Share Plan gives a reward for the performance of the 
PUMA SE share in the capital market.  
The performance period of the Performance Cash Plan is three years and is based on the average medium-
term targets of the PUMA Group in terms of EBIT, sales and cash flow or working capital as a percentage of 
sales. Payment is made in cash and is limited to a maximum of 200% of the granted proportionate target 
amount (cap). 
The Performance Share Plan uses virtual shares to manage the incentive. The term is up to five years. This 
is divided into a three-year performance period and a two-year exercise period in which the virtual shares 
are paid out in cash. A payout is only possible at the four exercise times (6, 12, 18 or 24 months after the end 
of the performance period). The average share price of the last 30 trading days before the exercise date 
determines the value of a virtual share. The payout is limited to a maximum of 300% of the granted prorated 
target amount (cap) and is only made if an exercise hurdle of +10% share-price appreciation is exceeded 
once during the performance period. 
 
EXPLANATION OF THE "GAME CHANGER 2.0 ‚Äì 2023" PROGRAMME 
In 2020, the global "Game Changer 2.0 ‚Äì 2023" programme, as outlined above, was launched. The 
Performance Cash Plan is based on the following targets: EBIT (70%), cash flow (15%) and sales (15%). As 
part of the Performance Share component, payment is limited to a maximum of 300% of the granted 
proportionate target amount (cap).  
In the reporting year, an amount of ‚Ç¨ 2.2 million (of which, ‚Ç¨ 0.8 million from the Performance Share Plan) 
was paid out to the participants. The payment was subject to the condition that the individual participants 
were in an unterminated employment relationship with a company in the PUMA Group as at 31 
December 2022. Furthermore, ‚Ç¨ -0.1 million was released for this programme in the year under review 
(previous year: release of ‚Ç¨ 0.2 million). This resulted in a provision for this programme at the end of the 
financial year of  
‚Ç¨ 0.5 million (previous year: ‚Ç¨ 2.8 million). The Performance Share Plan portion accounted for ‚Ç¨ 0.5 million 
(previous year: ‚Ç¨ 1.3 million). 
 
EXPLANATION OF THE "GAME CHANGER 2.0 ‚Äì 2024" PROGRAMME 
In 2021, the global "Game Changer 2.0 ‚Äì 2024" programme, as outlined above, was launched. The 
Performance Cash Plan is based on the following targets: EBIT (45%), working capital as a percentage of 
sales (15%), and sales (40%). As part of the Performance Share component, payment is limited to a 
maximum of 300% of the granted proportionate target amount (cap). An employment relationship until  
31 December 2023 is required. In the reporting year, ‚Ç¨ 0.2 million was released for this programme (previous 
year: ‚Ç¨ 0.0 million) and a proportionate amount of ‚Ç¨ 1.1 million (previous year: ‚Ç¨ 0.5 million) was set aside for 
this programme. This resulted in a provision for this programme at the end of the financial year of  
‚Ç¨ 3.4 million (previous year: ‚Ç¨ 2.5 million). The Performance Share Plan portion accounted for ‚Ç¨ 1.2 million 
(previous year: ‚Ç¨ 0.8 million).

EXPLANATION OF THE "GAME CHANGER 2.0 ‚Äì 2026" PROGRAMME 
In 2023, the global "Game Changer 2.0 ‚Äì 2026" programme, as outlined above, was launched. The 
Performance Cash Plan is based on the following targets: EBIT (70%), cash flow (15%) and sales (15%). As 
part of the Performance Share component, payment is limited to a maximum of 300% of the granted 
proportionate target amount (cap). An employment relationship until 31 December 2024 is required. In the 
reporting year, a prorated amount of ‚Ç¨ 1.8 million (previous year: ‚Ç¨ 0.0 million) was set aside for this 
programme. This resulted in a provision for this programme at the end of the financial year of ‚Ç¨ 1.8 million 
(previous year: ‚Ç¨ 0.0 million). The Performance Share Plan portion accounted for ‚Ç¨ 1.0 million (previous year: 
‚Ç¨ 0.0 million). 
 
EXPLANATION OF THE "ROAD 2 10B" PROGRAMME 
In 2022, the "Game Changer 2.0" programme was replaced by the long-term incentive programme (LTIP) 
"Road 2 10B". Participants in this programme consist of important professionals and managers within the 
PUMA Group. The objective of this programme is to retain these employees in the Company on a long-term 
basis and to allow them to share in the medium-term success of the Company.  
The LTIP "Road 2 10B" consists of two plan parts, a Performance Cash Plan and a Performance Share Plan, 
each with a 50% share. The Performance Cash Plan gives a reward for the PUMA Group's financial 
performance, while the Performance Share Plan gives a reward for the performance of the PUMA SE share 
in the capital market. 
The Performance Cash Plan is focused on the following targets: EBIT, sales and working capital as a 
percentage of sales based on the three-year plan set by the Management Board of PUMA SE. For 
participants in the programme with an employment relationship at Group level, the target achievement is 
based on the following Group targets: EBIT (45%), sales (40%), and working capital as a percentage of sales 
(15%). For participants in the programme with an employment relationship at the national or regional level, 
50% of the target achievement is based on achieving the Group targets. The remaining 50% is based on 
achieving the following targets at the national or regional level: EBIT (22.5%), sales (20%) and working 
capital as a percentage of sales (7.5%). Payment is limited to a maximum of 200% of the granted 
proportionate target amount (cap). 
The Performance Share Plan is based on the performance of the PUMA share price. The term is up to five 
years, divided into a three-year performance period and a subsequent two-year exercise period, in which 
the virtual shares are paid out in cash. A payout is only possible at the four exercise times (6, 12, 18 or 24 
months after the end of the performance period). The average share price of the last 30 trading days before 
the exercise date determines the payout value of a virtual share. The payout is limited to a maximum of 
300% of the granted prorated target amount (cap) and is only made if an exercise hurdle of +10% share-price 
appreciation is exceeded once during the performance period.  
In the reporting year, ‚Ç¨ 0.6 million was released for this programme (previous year: ‚Ç¨ 0.0 million) and a 
proportionate amount of ‚Ç¨ 0.8 million (previous year: ‚Ç¨ 4.7 million) was set aside for this programme. This 
resulted in a provision for this programme at the end of the financial year of ‚Ç¨ 6.0 million (previous year:  
‚Ç¨ 5.8 million). The Performance Share Plan portion accounted for ‚Ç¨ 0.4 (previous year: ‚Ç¨ 0.6 million).

INFORMATION ON THE EFFECTS OF GLOBAL MINIMUM TAXATION (PILLAR II) 
On 23 May 2023, the IASB published amendments to IAS 12, which require companies subject to global 
minimum taxation regulations to provide additional information on the impact of the global minimum 
taxation in their annual financial statements for financial years beginning on or after 1 January 2023.  
The PUMA Group falls within the scope of application of the global minimum taxation. The relevant 
legislation entered into force on 28 December 2023 in Germany, the country in which the parent company of 
the PUMA Group is based, and applies to financial years beginning after 31 December 2023. As the Minimum 
Tax Act ("MinStG") applies to the financial year of the PUMA Group beginning on 1 January 2024, but was not 
yet applicable to the financial year beginning on 1 January 2023, the PUMA Group has no associated ongoing 
tax risk in financial year 2023. Taking into account the fact that the PUMA Group will be affected by the 
minimum tax legislation, a preliminary valuation of the potential risk was carried out. 
The valuation of the potential risk of Pillar II taxes is based on the most recent country-related reports and 
financial statements available to the Group's business units. The Group has identified a potential risk of the 
suspension of Pillar II taxes on profits made in Hong Kong and the United Arab Emirates. The potential risk 
arises from the business units (mainly operating subsidiaries) in these countries, where the effective tax 
rate is likely to be less than 15%. 
If the MinStG had been applied for this financial year ending on 31 December 2023, the amount of the tax 
increase determined according to the MinStG would have totalled approx. ‚Ç¨ 12 million. However, the actual 
amounts of tax increases in the countries concerned in 2024 will depend on various factors.

The PUMA Group makes use of the exemption under IAS 12.88A for the recognition of deferred taxes that 
result from the introduction of global minimum taxation. 
 
23. EARNINGS PER SHARE 
The earnings per share are determined in accordance with IAS 33 by dividing the consolidated annual 
surplus (consolidated net earnings) attributable to the shareholders of the parent company by the weighted

ADDITIONAL INFORMATION 
24. SEGMENT REPORTING 
Segment reporting is based on geographical areas of responsibility in accordance with the PUMA internal 
reporting structure, with the exception of stichd. The geographical area of responsibility corresponds to the 
business segment. Sales, the operating result (EBIT) and other segment information are allocated to the 
corresponding geographical areas of responsibility according to the registered office of the respective Group 
company.  
The internal management reporting includes the following reporting segments: Europe, EEMEA (Eastern 
Europe, Middle East, Africa, India and Southeast Asia), North America, Latin America, Greater China, rest of 
Asia/Pacific (excluding Greater China and Southeast Asia) and stichd. These are reported as reportable 
business segments in accordance with the criteria of IFRS 8.  
The reconciliation includes information on assets, liabilities, expenses and income in connection with 
centralised functions that do not meet the definition of business segments in IFRS 8. Central expenses and 
income include in particular central sourcing, central treasury, central marketing, impairment losses on 
non-current assets and other global functions of the Company headquarters. 
The Company's main decision-maker is defined as the entire Management Board of PUMA SE.  
The external sales presented in the segment reporting includes sales from both the wholesale business and 
own retail activities (direct-to-consumer business). The percentage breakdown of sales by wholesale 
business and direct-to-consumer business at the segment level mainly aligns with the breakdown at the 
Group level (see chapter 19). Exceptions to this are the Greater China segment, where wholesale sales 
represent approximately 50%, and the stichd segment, which almost exclusively generates wholesale sales. 
The business relationships between the companies in the segments are essentially based on prices that are 
also agreed with third parties. With the exception of sales of goods by stichd amounting to ‚Ç¨ 37.1 million 
(previous year: ‚Ç¨ 38.3 million), there are no significant internal sales, which is why they are not included in 
the presentation.  
The operating result (EBIT) of the business segments is defined as gross profit less the attributable other 
operating expenses plus royalty and commission income and other operating income, but not considering 
the costs of the central departments and the central marketing expenses. 
The external sales, operating result (EBIT), inventories and trade receivables of the business segments are 
regularly reported to the main decision-maker. Amounts recognised by the Group from the intra-group 
profit elimination on inventories in connection with intra-group sales are not allocated to the business 
segments in the way that they are reported to the main decision-maker. Investments, depreciation and non-
current assets at the level of the business segments are not reported to the main decision-maker. 
Intangible assets are allocated to the business segments in the manner described in chapter 11. Liabilities, 
the financial result and income taxes are not allocated to the business segments and are therefore not 
reported to the main decision-maker at the business segment level. 
Non-current assets and depreciation comprise the carrying amounts and depreciation of property, plant and 
equipment, right-of-use assets and intangible assets during the past financial year. The investments 
comprise additions to property, plant and equipment and intangible assets.

25. NOTES TO THE CASH FLOW STATEMENT 
The cash flow statement was prepared in accordance with IAS 7 and is structured based on cash flows from 
operating, investing and financing activities. The indirect method is used to determine the cash 
outflow/inflow from operating activities. The gross cash flow, derived from earnings before income tax and 
adjusted for non-cash income and expense items, is determined within the cash flow from operating 
activities. Cash outflow/inflow from operating activities less investments in property, plant and equipment 
as well as intangible assets is referred to as free cash flow. 
The cash and cash equivalents reported in the cash flow statement include all cash and cash equivalents 
shown in the statement of financial position under the item "Cash and cash equivalents", i.e. cash on hand, 
checks and current bank balances including short-term financial investments. 
The following table shows the cash and non-cash changes in financial liabilities in accordance with IAS 7.44

by their nature cannot be predicted exactly in terms of their timing and amount. 
In addition, there are other financial obligations totalling ‚Ç¨ 246.5 million, of which, ‚Ç¨ 146.5 million relate to 
the years from 2025. These include service agreements of ‚Ç¨ 234.2 million as well as other obligations of  
‚Ç¨ 12.3 million. 
 
 
 


PUMA Annual Report 2023 
‚Üó Consolidated Financial Statements

CONTINGENT LIABILITIES 
Individual PUMA companies are involved in legal disputes arising from normal operating activities, e.g. 
relating to intellectual property rights and employee matters. If an outflow of resources from these legal 
disputes is classified as probable and the amount of the obligation can be reliably estimated, the risks 
arising from these legal disputes are included in the other provisions. However, if the probability of 
occurrence is classified as low, these legal disputes are recognised as contingent liabilities, which are 
estimated at ‚Ç¨ 0.8 million in this financial year (previous year: ‚Ç¨ 3.1 million).  Contingent liabilities also exist 
due to uncertainties in the appraisal of the facts by the tax and customs authorities in India. Based on 
external reports, the Management currently assumes that the receivables of Indian tax and customs 
authorities will not result in any cash outflow. Overall, the PUMA Management considers that the impact of 
the total of the contingent liabilities on the net assets, financial position and results of operations of the 
Company is immaterial. 
 
27. COMPENSATION OF THE MANAGEMENT BOARD AND SUPERVISORY BOARD 
Disclosures pursuant to Section 314(1) 6 HGB (German Commercial Code [Handelsgesetzbuch]) in 
conjunction with Section 315e HGB. 
COMPENSATION OF THE MEMBERS OF THE MANAGEMENT BOARD 
The total compensation of the members of the Management Board in financial year 2023 was ‚Ç¨ 10.3 million 
(previous year: ‚Ç¨ 11.9 million). 
The total remuneration of the Management Board includes the share-based remuneration granted for the 
financial year with a fair value of ‚Ç¨ 4.2 million (previous year: ‚Ç¨ 1.7 million) and 81,279 performance shares 
were issued (previous year: 16,457). The total remuneration for the previous year also includes the issue of 
30,968 virtual shares of the PUMA Monetary Unit Plan with a fair value of ‚Ç¨ 3.0 million. 
 
TOTAL COMPENSATION OF FORMER MEMBERS OF THE MANAGEMENT BOARD 
The total remuneration of former members of the Management Board and their surviving dependents 
amounted to ‚Ç¨ 2023 million in financial year 0.7 (previous year: ‚Ç¨ 0.7 million). 
In addition, there were defined benefit pension obligations to former members of the Management Board 
and their widows/widowers amounting to ‚Ç¨ 2.4 million (previous year: ‚Ç¨ 2.5 million) as well as defined 
contribution plans from deferred compensation of former members of the Management Board and 
Managing Directors amounting to ‚Ç¨ 47.2 million (previous year: ‚Ç¨ 17.3 million). Both items are recognised 
accordingly within pension provisions to the extent they were not offset against plan assets of an equal 
amount.  
 
COMPENSATION OF THE SUPERVISORY BOARD 
The compensation paid to the Supervisory Board comprised fixed compensation and additional 
compensation for committee activities, and amounted to a total of ‚Ç¨ 0.4 million (previous year:  
‚Ç¨ 0.2 million).

28. DISCLOSURES RELATED TO NON-CONTROLLING INTERESTS 
The summarised financial information about subsidiaries of the Group in which non-controlling interests 
exist is presented below. This financial information relates to all companies with non-controlling interests in 
which the identical non-controlling shareholder holds an interest. The figures represent the amounts before 
intercompany eliminations. 
Evaluation of the control of companies with non-controlling interests: 
The Group holds a 51% capital share in PUMA United North America LLC, PUMA United Canada ULC and 
Janed Canada LLC (inactive company). With these companies, there are profit-sharing arrangements in 
place which differ from the capital share for the benefit of the respective identical non-controlling 
shareholder. PUMA receives higher license fees in exchange.  
In addition, there is a shareholding in the capital and the result, amounting to 70%, in the company PUMA 
United Aviation North America LLC. 
The contractual agreements with these companies respectively provide PUMA with a majority of the voting 
rights at the shareholder meetings, and thus the right of disposal regarding these companies. PUMA is 
exposed to fluctuating returns from the sales-based license fees and from variable earnings. The Group 
also controls the key activities of these companies. The companies are accordingly included in the 
consolidated financial statements as subsidiaries with full consolidation with recognition of non-controlling 
interests. 
The non-controlling interests existing on the balance sheet date relate to PUMA United North America LLC, 
PUMA United Canada ULC, Janed Canada, LLC (inactive) and PUMA United Aviation North America LLC at  
‚Ç¨ 28.9 million (previous year: ‚Ç¨ 67.1 million).

29. RELATED PARTY RELATIONSHIPS 
In accordance with IAS 24, relationships to related companies and persons that control or are controlled by 
the PUMA Group must be reported. All natural persons and companies that can be controlled by PUMA, that 
can exercise relevant control over the PUMA Group or that are under the relevant control of another related 
party of the PUMA Group are considered to be related companies or persons within the meaning of IAS 24. 
As of 31 December 2023, there was one shareholding in PUMA SE that exceeded 20% of the voting rights. 
This is held by the Pinault family via several companies that the family controls (in order of proximity to the 
Pinault family: Financi√®re Pinault S.C.A., Art√©mis S.A.S. and Kering S.A.). The share of Kering S.A. in 
PUMA SE amounted to 1.47% of the share capital at 18 September 2023. Combined, the shareholdings of 
Art√©mis S.A.S. and Kering S.A. amounted to 29.99% of the share capital of PUMA SE at 18 September 2023. 
Since Art√©mis S.A.S. and Kering S.A. hold more than 20% of the voting rights in PUMA SE, they are 
presumed to have significant influence according to IAS 28.5 and IAS 28.6. They and all other companies 
directly or indirectly controlled by Financi√®re Pinault S.C.A. that are not included in the consolidated 
financial statements of PUMA SE are considered as related parties in the following.  
In addition, the disclosure obligation pursuant to IAS 24 extends to transactions with associated companies 
as well as transactions with other related companies and persons.  
Transactions with related companies and persons largely concern sales of goods and licensing agreements.

INDEPENDENT AUDITOR‚ÄôS REPORT 
For the Consolidated Financial Statements and Group Management Report we have issued an unqualified 
auditor‚Äôs report. The English language text below is a translation of the auditor‚Äôs report. The original 
German text shall prevail in the event of any discrepancies between the English translation and the 
German original. We do not accept any liability for the use of, or reliance on, the English translation or for 
any errors or misunderstandings that may derive from the translation. 
 
To PUMA SE, Herzogenaurach 
REPORT ON THE AUDIT OF THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND OF THE 
COMBINED MANAGEMENT REPORT 
OPINIONS 
We have audited the consolidated financial statements of PUMA SE, Herzogenaurach, and its subsidiaries 
(the Group), which comprise the consolidated statement of financial position as of December 31, 2023, the 
consolidated income statement, the consolidated statement of comprehensive income, the consolidated 
statement of changes in equity and the consolidated statement of cash flows for the financial year from 
January 1 to December 31, 2023, and notes to the consolidated financial statements, including a summary of 
significant accounting policies. In addition, we have audited the management report of the Company and the 
Group (combined management report) of PUMA SE for the financial year from January 1 to 
December 31, 2023. 
In accordance with German legal requirements, we have not audited the content of those components of the 
combined management report specified in the "Other Information" section of our auditor's report. 
The combined management report contains cross-references that are not provided for by law and which are 
marked as unaudited. In accordance with German legal requirements, we have not audited the cross-
references and the information to which the cross-references refer. 
In our opinion, on the basis of the knowledge obtained in the audit, 
‚Ä¢ the accompanying consolidated financial statements comply, in all material respects, with the IFRSs as 
adopted by the EU, and the additional requirements of German commercial law pursuant to Section 
315e (1) HGB [Handelsgesetzbuch: German Commercial Code] and, in compliance with these 
requirements, give a true and fair view of the assets, liabilities, and financial position of the Group as of 
December 31, 2023, and of its financial performance for the financial year from January 1 to 
December 31, 2023, and 
‚Ä¢ the accompanying combined management report as a whole provides an appropriate view of the Group's 
position. In all material respects, this combined management report is consistent with the consolidated 
financial statements, complies with German legal requirements and appropriately presents the 
opportunities and risks of future development. Our opinion on the combined management report does 
not cover the content of those components of the combined management report specified in the "Other 
Information" section of the auditor's report. The combined management report contains cross-
references that are not provided for by law and which are marked as unaudited. Our audit opinion does 
not extend to the cross-references and the information to which the cross-references refer. 
Pursuant to Section 322 (3) sentence 1 HGB, we declare that our audit has not led to any reservations 
relating to the legal compliance of the consolidated financial statements and of the combined management 
report. 


PUMA Annual Report 2023 
‚Üó Consolidated Financial Statements 
374 
BASIS FOR THE OPINIONS 
We conducted our audit of the consolidated financial statements and of the combined management report in 
accordance with Section 317 HGB and the EU Audit Regulation No 537/2014 (referred to subsequently as 
"EU Audit Regulation") and in compliance with German Generally Accepted Standards for Financial 
Statement Audits promulgated by the Institut der Wirtschaftspr√ºfer [Institute of Public Auditors in Germany] 
(IDW). Our responsibilities under those requirements and principles are further described in the "Auditor's 
Responsibilities for the Audit of the Consolidated Financial Statements and of the Combined Management 
Report" section of our auditor's report. We are independent of the group entities in accordance with the 
requirements of European law and German commercial and professional law, and we have fulfilled our 
other German professional responsibilities in accordance with these requirements. In addition, in 
accordance with Article 10 (2)(f) of the EU Audit Regulation, we declare that we have not provided non-audit 
services prohibited under Article 5 (1) of the EU Audit Regulation. We believe that the evidence we have 
obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinions on the consolidated financial 
statements and on the combined management report. 
 
KEY AUDIT MATTERS IN THE AUDIT OF THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 
Key audit matters are those matters that, in our professional judgment, were of most significance in our 
audit of the consolidated financial statements for the financial year from January 1 to December 31, 2023. 
These matters were addressed in the context of our audit of the consolidated financial statements as a 
whole, and in forming our opinion thereon, we do not provide a separate opinion on these matters. 
Revenue recognition cut-off for wholesale customers 
For information on the accounting policies applied, please refer to Sections 2 and 19 in the notes to the 
consolidated financial statements. 
THE FINANCIAL STATEMENT RISK 
The consolidated financial statements of PUMA SE for financial year 2023 report revenue of 
EUR 8,601.7 million. Revenue includes revenue of EUR 6,468.6 million from the sale of goods to wholesale 
customers. 
The Group recognizes revenue from the sale of goods to wholesale customers when it fulfils a performance 
obligation through the transfer of a promised asset to a customer. An asset is transferred when (or as) the 
customer obtains control of that asset. In accordance with the transfer of control, revenue from wholesale 
customers is recognized at a point in time in the amount to which the Group is entitled. 
The Management Board of PUMA SE has defined the criteria for the recognition of revenue at a point in time 
in a group-wide accounting policy and implemented processes for correct recognition and cut-off. 
In the final weeks prior to the reporting date, a range of transactions with wholesale customers take place 
with individual contractual agreements on the transfer of risk. In addition, there are internally defined and 
externally communicated revenue targets for the financial year, which represent a key benchmark for 
measuring corporate success. 
There is the risk for the consolidated financial statements that revenue in the reporting year is overstated 
due to it being recognized in the wrong period, meaning that it is not recorded on an accrual basis. 
 
 


PUMA Annual Report 2023 
‚Üó Consolidated Financial Statements 
375 
OUR AUDIT APPROACH 
In order to audit revenue recognition cut-off for wholesale customers, we assessed the design, setup and 
effectiveness of the internal controls relating to outgoing goods and the acceptance of goods and invoicing, 
in particular the determination and verification of the correct transfer of control. In addition, we reviewed 
the presentation of revenue recognition in the group-wide accounting policy to ensure compliance with 
IFRS 15. 
Furthermore, we assessed revenue recognition cut-off for wholesale customers by reconciling invoices with 
the related orders, underlying contracts and external delivery records. This was based on revenue 
recognized at the end of December 2023 and selected using a mathematical/statistical procedure. 
OUR OBSERVATIONS 
PUMA SE's approach to revenue recognition cut-off with wholesale customers is appropriate. 
Impairment testing of right-of-use assets for retail stores 
For information on the accounting policies applied, please refer to Sections 2 and 10 in the notes to the 
consolidated financial statements. 
THE FINANCIAL STATEMENT RISK 
As of December 31, 2023, right-of-use assets of EUR 1,087.7 million are recognized in the consolidated 
financial statements of PUMA SE. A significant portion of the right-of-use assets is attributable to retail 
stores (EUR 464.2 million). Right-of-use assets amount to 16.4% of total assets and thus have a material 
influence on the Company's net assets. 
Owing to the large number of leases and the resulting transactions, the Company has set up group-wide 
processes and controls for the measurement of leases. 
Right-of-use assets for retail stores are tested for impairment at the level of the individual retail stores as 
cash-generating units. The impairment test compares the carrying amount of the cash-generating unit with 
its recoverable amount. The Company determines the recoverable amount for the retail stores indicating 
potential impairment by using the discounted cash flow method. If the carrying amount exceeds the 
recoverable amount, an impairment loss is recognized for the right-of-use asset of the cash-generating 
unit. The recoverable amount is the higher of an asset's fair value less costs to sell and its value in use.  
Impairment testing of right-of-use assets for retail stores is complex and based on a range of assumptions 
that require judgment. Among others, these include the business and earnings performance of the retail 
store for the next year, the assumed growth rates, the applied discount rate and the use of extension 
options. The Company recognized impairment losses in the amount of EUR 5.7 million for right-of-use 
assets for retail stores during the financial year. 
In particular owing to the judgments for measuring right-of-use assets for retail stores, there is the risk for 
the consolidated financial statements that an impairment of right-of-use assets may not be identified. 
 
 


PUMA Annual Report 2023 
‚Üó Consolidated Financial Statements 
376 
OUR AUDIT APPROACH 
Using the information obtained during our audit, we assessed whether there were any indicators of 
impairment for right-of-use assets for retail stores. In doing so, we thoroughly examined the Company's 
approach to determining the need to recognize impairment losses and, based on the information obtained in 
the course of our audit, assessed whether there were any indications of impairment that had not been 
identified by the Company. 
With the involvement of our valuation specialists, for a sample of retail stores selected based on risk, we 
then assessed (among other things) the appropriateness of the Company's calculation method. For this 
purpose we discussed the expected business and earnings development for the retail stores selected in this 
sample and the assumed growth rates with those responsible for planning. Where accounting judgments 
were made for determining the lease term, we examined these judgments to determine whether the 
underlying assumptions were comprehensible in light of the prevailing market conditions and risks in the 
industry. 
We also assessed the accuracy of the Company's previous forecasts for the affected right-of-use assets by 
comparing the budgets from the previous financial year for the selected retail stores in the sample with the 
actual results, and we analyzed any deviations. Further, we compared the assumptions and data underlying 
the discount rates with our own assumptions and publicly available data. We also assessed whether the 
calculation method for the discount rate was appropriate. 
We verified the computational accuracy of the carrying amount of the right-of-use assets determined by 
PUMA SE for the retail stores included in the sample. 
In order to take forecast uncertainty into account, we examined the impact of potential changes in the 
discount rate, earnings performance and long-term growth rates on the value in use by calculating 
alternative scenarios for the selected sample and comparing these with the values stated by the Company 
(sensitivity analysis). 
OUR OBSERVATIONS 
The calculation method used for impairment testing of right-of-use assets for retail stores is appropriate 
and in line with the accounting policies to be applied. 
The Company's assumptions and data used for the measurement of the right-of-use assets for retail stores 
are appropriate. 
 
OTHER INFORMATION 
The Management Board and/or the Supervisory Board is responsible for the other information. The other 
information comprises the following components of the combined management report, whose content was 
not audited: 
‚Ä¢ the Company's and Group's separate combined non-financial report, which is referred to in the 
combined management report, and 
‚Ä¢ the combined corporate governance statement for the Company and Group, which is included in a 
separate section of the combined management report, and 
‚Ä¢ information extraneous to combined management reports and marked as unaudited. 
The other information also includes the annual report, which is expected to be made available to us after 
the date of this independent auditor's report. The other information does not include the consolidated 
financial statements, the combined management report information audited for content and our auditor's 
report thereon. 


PUMA Annual Report 2023 
‚Üó Consolidated Financial Statements 
377 
Our opinions on the consolidated financial statements and on the combined management report do not 
cover the other information, and consequently we do not express an opinion or any other form of assurance 
conclusion thereon. 
In connection with our audit, our responsibility is to read the other information and, in so doing, to consider 
whether the other information 
‚Ä¢ is materially inconsistent with the consolidated financial statements, with the combined management 
report information audited for content or our knowledge obtained in the audit, or 
‚Ä¢ otherwise appears to be materially misstated. 
 
RESPONSIBILITIES OF THE MANAGEMENT BOARD AND THE SUPERVISORY BOARD FOR THE 
CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND THE COMBINED MANAGEMENT REPORT 
The Management Board is responsible for the preparation of consolidated financial statements that comply, 
in all material respects, with IFRSs as adopted by the EU and the additional requirements of German 
commercial law pursuant to Section 315e (1) HGB and that the consolidated financial statements, in 
compliance with these requirements, give a true and fair view of the assets, liabilities, financial position, 
and financial performance of the Group. In addition, the Management Board is responsible for such internal 
control as it has determined necessary to enable the preparation of consolidated financial statements that 
are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud (i.e., fraudulent financial reporting and 
misappropriation of assets) or error. 
In preparing the consolidated financial statements, the Management Board is responsible for assessing the 
Group's ability to continue as a going concern. They also have the responsibility for disclosing, as applicable, 
matters related to going concern. In addition, they are responsible for financial reporting based on the going 
concern basis of accounting unless there is an intention to liquidate the Group or to cease operations, or 
there is no realistic alternative but to do so. 
Furthermore, the Management Board is responsible for the preparation of the combined management 
report that, as a whole, provides an appropriate view of the Group‚Äôs position and is, in all material respects, 
consistent with the consolidated financial statements, complies with German legal requirements, and 
appropriately presents the opportunities and risks of future development. In addition, the Management 
Board is responsible for such arrangements and measures (systems) as they have considered necessary to 
enable the preparation of a combined management report that is in accordance with the applicable German 
legal requirements, and to be able to provide sufficient appropriate evidence for the assertions in the 
combined management report. 
The Supervisory Board is responsible for overseeing the Group's financial reporting process for the 
preparation of the consolidated financial statements and of the combined management report. 
 
AUDITOR'S RESPONSIBILITIES FOR THE AUDIT OF THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND OF 
THE COMBINED MANAGEMENT REPORT 
Our objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated financial statements as a 
whole are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error, and whether the combined 
management report as a whole provides an appropriate view of the Group‚Äôs position and, in all material 
respects, is consistent with the consolidated financial statements and the knowledge obtained in the audit, 
complies with the German legal requirements and appropriately presents the opportunities and risks of 
future development, as well as to issue an auditor‚Äôs report that includes our opinions on the consolidated 
financial statements and on the combined management report. 


PUMA Annual Report 2023 
‚Üó Consolidated Financial Statements 
378 
Reasonable assurance is a high level of assurance, but is not a guarantee that an audit conducted in 
accordance with Section 317 HGB and the EU Audit Regulation and in compliance with German Generally 
Accepted Standards for Financial Statement Audits promulgated by the Institut der Wirtschaftspr√ºfer (IDW) 
will always detect a material misstatement. Misstatements can arise from fraud or error and are considered 
material if, individually or in the aggregate, they could reasonably be expected to influence the economic 
decisions of users taken on the basis of these consolidated financial statements and this combined 
management report. 
We exercise professional judgment and maintain professional skepticism throughout the audit. We also: 
‚Ä¢ Identify and assess the risks of material misstatement of the consolidated financial statements and of 
the combined management report, whether due to fraud or error, design and perform audit procedures 
responsive to those risks, and obtain audit evidence that is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis 
for our opinions. The risk of not detecting a material misstatement resulting from fraud is higher than 
the risk of not detecting a material misstatement resulting from error, as fraud may involve collusion, 
forgery, intentional omissions, misrepresentations, or the override of internal controls. 
‚Ä¢ Obtain an understanding of internal control relevant to the audit of the consolidated financial statements 
and of arrangements and measures (systems) relevant to the audit of the combined management report 
in order to design audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of 
expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of these systems. 
‚Ä¢ Evaluate the appropriateness of accounting policies used by the Management Board and the 
reasonableness of estimates made by the Management Board and related disclosures. 
‚Ä¢ Conclude on the appropriateness of the Management Board's use of the going concern basis of 
accounting and, based on the audit evidence obtained, whether a material uncertainty exists related to 
events or conditions that may cast significant doubt on the Group's ability to continue as a going concern. 
If we conclude that a material uncertainty exists, we are required to draw attention in the auditor's 
report to the related disclosures in the consolidated financial statements and in the combined 
management report or, if such disclosures are inadequate, to modify our respective opinions. Our 
conclusions are based on the audit evidence obtained up to the date of our auditor's report. However, 
future events or conditions may cause the Group to cease to be able to continue as a going concern. 
‚Ä¢ Evaluate the overall presentation, structure and content of the consolidated financial statements, 
including the disclosures, and whether the consolidated financial statements present the underlying 
transactions and events in a manner that the consolidated financial statements give a true and fair view 
of the assets, liabilities, financial position and financial performance of the Group in compliance with 
IFRSs as adopted by the EU and the additional requirements of German commercial law pursuant to 
Section 315e (1) HGB. 
‚Ä¢ Obtain sufficient appropriate audit evidence regarding the financial information of the entities or 
business activities within the Group to express opinions on the consolidated financial statements and on 
the combined management report. We are responsible for the direction, supervision and performance of 
the group audit. We remain solely responsible for our opinions. 
‚Ä¢ Evaluate the consistency of the combined management report with the consolidated financial 
statements, its conformity with [German] law, and the view of the Group's position it provides. 
‚Ä¢ Perform audit procedures on the prospective information presented by the Management Board in the 
combined management report. On the basis of sufficient appropriate audit evidence we evaluate, in 
particular, the significant assumptions used by the Management Board as a basis for the prospective 
information, and evaluate the proper derivation of the prospective information from these assumptions. 
We do not express a separate opinion on the prospective information and on the assumptions used as a 
basis. There is a substantial unavoidable risk that future events will differ materially from the 
prospective information. 
We communicate with those charged with governance regarding, among other matters, the planned scope 
and timing of the audit and significant audit findings, including any significant deficiencies in internal 
control that we identify during our audit. 


PUMA Annual Report 2023 
‚Üó Consolidated Financial Statements 
379 
We also provide those charged with governance with a statement that we have complied with the relevant 
independence requirements, and communicate with them all relationships and other matters that may 
reasonably be thought to bear on our independence, and where applicable, the actions taken or safeguards 
applied to eliminate independence threats. 
From the matters communicated with those charged with governance, we determine those matters that 
were of most significance in the audit of the consolidated financial statements of the current period and are 
therefore the key audit matters. We describe these matters in our auditor's report unless law or regulation 
precludes public disclosure about the matter. 
 
OTHER LEGAL AND REGULATORY REQUIREMENTS 
REPORT ON THE ASSURANCE ON THE ELECTRONIC RENDERING OF THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL 
STATEMENTS AND THE COMBINED MANAGEMENT REPORT PREPARED FOR PUBLICATION PURPOSES IN 
ACCORDANCE WITH SECTION 317 (3A) HGB 
We have performed assurance work in accordance with Section 317 (3a) HGB to obtain reasonable 
assurance about whether the rendering of the consolidated financial statements and the combined 
management report (hereinafter the "ESEF documents") contained in the electronic file ‚ÄûPUMA KA 2023.zip‚Äú 
(SHA256-Hashwert: 3d9c82efdcc3657b21661fc4c90debfbfafac65be5b3f152055611b47a544d9b) made available 
and prepared for publication purposes complies in all material respects with the requirements of 
Section 328 (1) HGB for the electronic reporting format ("ESEF format"). In accordance with German legal 
requirements, this assurance work extends only to the conversion of the information contained in the 
consolidated financial statements and the combined management report into the ESEF format and 
therefore relates neither to the information contained in these renderings nor to any other information 
contained in the file identified above. 
In our opinion, the rendering of the consolidated financial statements and the combined management 
report contained in the electronic file made available, identified above and prepared for publication 
purposes complies in all material respects with the requirements of Section 328 (1) HGB for the electronic 
reporting format. Beyond this assurance opinion and our audit opinion on the accompanying consolidated 
financial statements and the accompanying combined management report for the financial year from 
January 1 to December 31, 2023, contained in the "Report on the Audit of the Consolidated Financial 
Statements and the Combined Management Report" above, we do not express any assurance opinion on the 
information contained within these renderings or on the other information contained in the file identified 
above. 
We conducted our assurance work on the rendering of the consolidated financial statements and the 
combined management report contained in the file made available and identified above in accordance with 
Section 317 (3a) HGB and the IDW Assurance Standard: Assurance Work on the Electronic Rendering of 
Financial Statements and Management Reports Prepared for Publication Purposes in Accordance with 
Section 317 (3a) HGB (IDW AsS 410 (06.2022)). Our responsibility in accordance therewith is further described 
below. Our audit firm applies the IDW Standard on Quality Management 1: Requirements for Quality 
Management in Audit Firms (IDW QMS 1) (09.2022). 
Owing to the conversion process selected by the Company concerning the information in the notes in iXBRL 
format (block tagging), the consolidated financial statements converted into the ESEF format are not 
machine-readable in a fully meaningful respect. There is significant legal uncertainty regarding the legal 
conformity of the Management Board's interpretation that meaningful machine-readability of the structured 
information in the notes is not explicitly required by Commission Delegated Regulation (EU) 2019/815 for the

The Company's Management Board is responsible for the preparation of the ESEF documents including the 
electronic rendering of the consolidated financial statements and the combined management report in

accordance with Section 328 (1) sentence 4 item 1 HGB and for the tagging of the consolidated financial 
statements in accordance with Section 328 (1) sentence 4 item 2 HGB. 
In addition, the Company's Management Board is responsible for such internal control that they have 
considered necessary to enable the preparation of ESEF documents that are free from material intentional 
or unintentional non-compliance with the requirements of Section 328 (1) HGB for the electronic reporting 
format. 
The Supervisory Board is responsible for overseeing the process of preparing the ESEF documents as part 
of the financial reporting process. 
Our objective is to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the ESEF documents are free from material 
intentional or unintentional non-compliance with the requirements of Section 328 (1) HGB. We exercise 
professional judgment and maintain professional skepticism throughout the assurance work. We also: 
‚Ä¢ Identify and assess the risks of material intentional or unintentional non-compliance with the 
requirements of Section 328 (1) HGB, design and perform assurance procedures responsive to those 
risks, and obtain assurance evidence that is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our 
assurance opinion. 
‚Ä¢ Obtain an understanding of internal control relevant to the assurance on the ESEF documents in order to 
design assurance procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of 
expressing an assurance opinion on the effectiveness of these controls. 
‚Ä¢ Evaluate the technical validity of the ESEF documents, i.e. whether the file made available containing the 
ESEF documents meets the requirements of Commission Delegated Regulation (EU) 2019/815, as 
amended as of the reporting date, on the technical specification for this electronic file. 
‚Ä¢ Evaluate whether the ESEF documents provide an XHTML rendering with content equivalent to the 
audited consolidated financial statements and the audited combined management report. 
‚Ä¢ Evaluate whether the tagging of the ESEF documents with Inline XBRL technology (iXBRL) in accordance 
with the requirements of Articles 4 and 6 of the Commission Delegated Regulation (EU) 2019/815, as 
amended as of the reporting date, enables an appropriate and complete machine-readable XBRL copy of 
the XHTML rendering. 
 
FURTHER INFORMATION PURSUANT TO ARTICLE 10 OF THE EU AUDIT REGULATION 
We were elected as group auditor at the Annual General Meeting on May 24, 2023. We were engaged by the 
Supervisory Board on November 21, 2023. We have been the group auditor of PUMA SE without interruption 
since financial year 2022. 
We declare that the opinions expressed in this auditor's report are consistent with the additional report to 
the Audit Committee pursuant to Article 11 of the EU Audit Regulation (long-form audit report). 
 
OTHER MATTER ‚Äì USE OF THE AUDITOR'S REPORT 
Our auditor's report must always be read together with the audited consolidated financial statements and 
the audited combined management report as well as the examined ESEF documents. The consolidated 
financial statements and combined management report converted to the ESEF format ‚Äì including the 
versions to be entered in the German Company Register [Unternehmensregister] ‚Äì are merely electronic 
renderings of the audited consolidated financial statements and the audited combined management report 
and do not take their place. In particular, the ESEF report and our assurance opinion contained therein are 
to be used solely together with the examined ESEF documents made available in electronic form.

Arne Freundt, CEO: 
 
‚ÄúWith our second quarter operating performance, 
we fully delivered on our outlook for the quarter and 
are well on track to deliver on our outlook for the full 
year. I could not be prouder of our team and our 
strong retail partnerships, which were key to 
delivering this result in an environment of increased 
currency headwinds, stressed supply chains and 
macroeconomic and geopolitical challenges that are 
weighing on consumer sentiment around the world. 
With view to our strong orderbook for the second 
half of the year, we reiterate our sales growth 
outlook in the MSD range and are narrowing our full-
year EBIT outlook range to ‚Ç¨ 620 ‚Äì 670 million EBIT 
in light of these external factors. 
With our continued focus on a good sell-through and 
disciplined sell-in, we were able to improve our 
wholesale business in all regions, except EEMEA. 
With our strong order book for the second half of 
the year, we will see further improvement in our 
wholesale business in the coming quarters. The 
robust demand for the PUMA brand continues to be 
driven by our great product newness and innovation 
which we launched in the past months. There is 
more to come in the second half of the year.

On the performance side, ULTRA, PUMA‚Äôs fastest 
football boot, Deviate Nitro Elite 3, PUMA‚Äôs fastest 
running shoe, and MB.04, PUMA‚Äôs latest version of 
its bestseller signature shoe with LaMelo Ball will be 
the key newness and innovations for the second half 
of 2024. Together with our new design partner 
Salehe Bembury, we will continue to stir up the 
basketball market with new disruptive designs in the 
coming year.  
On the Sportstyle side, we are continuing to see 
strong sell-through with our family footwear retail 
partners, while we are making good progress in the 
transition of our Sportstyle Prime offer with Palermo, 
Suede XL and Easy Rider. We are very encouraged 
by the first launches of Speedcat in the elevated 
distribution channels globally and by the great 
feedback of our retail partners on our product line-
up. We are very confident about the future success 
of the low-profile silhouette and are happy to 
welcome Ros√©, the iconic K-Pop star, as great new 
ambassador for this emerging trend.  
We continue to focus our efforts on increasing the 
brand desirability for the long-term growth of the 
PUMA brand. With our first global brand campaign 
in ten years, we have done the first steps and 
improved our brand consideration with consumers. 
Delivering great innovation and newness are further 
pillars of that strategy. With the Euros, Copa 
America and now the Olympics, we have the perfect 
stage to create great brand visibility and credibility 
in our unmissable ‚Äúfireglow‚Äù shoe colourway and 
showcase the superiority of our Nitro foam 
technology which enhances the performance of elite 
and everyday athletes. We are very proud of the 
achievements of our athletes and are grateful to 
celebrate these amazing sporting events and iconic 
moments together with them.‚Äù

Interim Management Report 
 
 
GENERAL ECONOMIC CONDITIONS 
 
According to the summer forecast published by the 
Kiel Institute for the World Economy (ifw Kiel) on 13 
June 2024, the global economy has expanded at a 
moderate pace so far this year. The main reason for 
this was that production in the emerging economies 
- and particularly in China - grew much more 
strongly than before. In the advanced economies, 
on the other hand, economic expansion continued at 
a somewhat slower pace overall. 
 
 
BRAND AND STRATEGY UPDATE 
 
Making Progress in Brand Elevation 
With many important events such as the Olympic 
Games, UEFA Euro 2024 and CONMEBOL Copa 
America, 2024 is undoubtedly a year of sports. 
PUMA took this as an opportunity to launch our 
biggest-ever brand campaign to elevate the 
brand, one of the cornerstones of our strategy 
together with increasing product excellence and 
improving our distribution quality. 
 
The campaign ‚ÄúFOREVER. FASTER. - See The 
Game Like We Do‚Äù conveys the brand‚Äôs unique 
connection with speed and is communicated across 
the entire media mix, such as Social Media, TV, PR, 
Out Of Home Media and Points of Sale worldwide. 
Following the launch in April, from which we 
received very positive feedback, PUMA followed 
up with additional chapters of the campaign fully 
dedicated to Euro 2024, Copa America and our 
 
 
 
best-in-class athletes at these events such as 
Neymar Jr., Xavi Simons, Kai Havertz and Cody 
Gakpo.   
 
Great Performances by PUMA Athletes and 
Teams 
The great performance of our sponsored teams and 
athletes underscored our credibility as a sports 
brand across the world. At Euro 2024, our players 
and teams ensured fantastic visibility throughout 
the tournament, with PUMA-Teams Austria and 
Switzerland 
putting 
up 
some 
fantastic 
performances to progress to the knock-out stages. 
 
The success of our club teams also contributed to 
our brand visibility, as Manchester City secured 
the Premier League title for the fourth consecutive 
year, while Borussia Dortmund reached the final 
of the Champions League, Europe‚Äôs most coveted 
competition. 
With 
French 
defender 
Theo 
Hern√°ndez and US midfielder Weston McKenny, 
PUMA signed two young players at the top of their 
game to become brand ambassadors.  
 
In track and field, PUMA athletes broke three world 
records in the first half of 2024, underscoring the 
great performance of our spikes. Ukrainian high 
jumper Yaroslava Mahuchickh showed her 
incredible form ahead of the Olympic Games by 
breaking the 37-year-old high jump world record 
with a 2.10m jump. Pole vaulter Armand ‚ÄúMondo‚Äù  
 
 
 
Duplantis once again soared to new heights, 
breaking his own world record for the ninth time by 
raising the bar to 6.25m. In March, Devynne 
Charlton from the Bahamas set a new 60m hurdles 
world record. Our track and field athletes also shone 
at the European Athletics Championships in Rome, 
winning seven gold, ten silver and seven bronze 
medals. 
 
Supported 
by 
our 
award-winning 
NITROTM 
technology, our road running athletes also went 
from strength to strength this year. For the first time 
in decades, PUMA athletes reached the podium 
at international marathon majors, with Vivian 
Cheruiyot coming in third in Paris and Edna Kiplagat 
taking third position in Boston. 
 
At the Olympic Games in Paris, PUMA equips 17 
federations and more than 350 athletes across a 
range of different sports. Most recently, PUMA 
joined forces with the Athletic Federation of India as 
an Official Kit Partner. PUMA will also outfit seven 
federations at the Paralympic Games in Paris. 
 
Throughout this year of sports, PUMA enjoyed great 
visibility with the eye-catching ‚Äúfireglow‚Äù colours of 
our football boots and track and field spikes worn by 
our athletes. 
 
 


6 
 
 
 
To build on our strong portfolio of brand 
ambassadors on the entertainment side, we 
welcomed Ros√©, a member of one of the best-
selling girl groups of all time, South Korean musical 
quartet BLACKPINK. With a dedicated fanbase 
across the globe, the K-Pop idol will support classic 
franchises in PUMA‚Äôs Sportstyle category including 
the Palermo. 
 
Rebounding in China   
PUMA has focused on strengthening its credibility as 
a sports brand in China, for example by sponsoring 
the Diamond League event in Xiamen and by 
being among the top 10 brands at the Wuxi 
Marathon, one of the world‚Äôs largest running 
events. To capture the popularity of basketball in the 
country, PUMA took its NBA ambassador Scoot 
Henderson on a tour of China. 
 
The announcement of our collaboration with K-Pop 
star Ros√© also struck a chord with Chinese 
consumers, as it generated PUMA‚Äôs biggest social 
media stir in China over the past years. The Formula 
1 Grand Prix in China gave us the opportunity to 
showcase the best of the PUMA brand and the 
Formula 1 collection in a successful live event on 
Chinese e-commerce platform Tmall, which 
engaged millions of viewers. PUMA also leveraged 
its ambassadors from the world of music and 
entertainment to further build up brand momentum 
in Sportstyle. In 2024, PUMA signed singer-
songwriter Henry Lau and featured him in a 
successful dance campaign which created great 
engagement on social media. 
 
 
Henry Lau also helped PUMA promote locally 
designed apparel collections, which incorporated 
local fitting and design details and resonated well 
with consumers. Our Palermo and Speedcat 
sneakers became bestselling franchises, with the 
Speedcat immediately selling out at its initial launch. 
These and other measures resulted in PUMA 
continuing to build up momentum to rebound 
in China despite the difficult market environment. 
This was underscored by the results of the recent 
6/18 shopping holiday, where PUMA clearly 
exceeded last year‚Äôs results. 
 
Winning in the USA 
As official partners of CONMEBOL, the Copa 
America tournament in the US offered a great 
opportunity to position PUMA as a performance 
brand in the country and enjoy great visibility. We 
harnessed the appeal of our football brand 
ambassadors Neymar Jr. and Christian Pulisic, 
who hosted events ahead of the tournament to 
create excitement. 
 
In road running, our NITROTM technology propelled 
Fiona O‚ÄôKeeffe and Dakotah Lindwurm to first and 
third at the US Olympic Marathon Trials, 
underscoring our successful return to performance 
running. Our lightweight NITROFOAM‚Ñ¢, which 
offers exceptional rebound, also features in our 
basketball style All-Pro NITRO‚Ñ¢, which became 
the official shoe of leading amateur basketball circuit 
NXTPro Hoops. PUMA used the cultural appeal of 
motorsports to launch an exclusive collection with 
Ferrari for the Miami Grand Prix, which sold out 
immediately.
 
 
We drove brand heat through our strong 
partnerships with ambassadors from music and 
entertainment, especially PUMA‚Äôs power couple 
Rihanna and A$AP Rocky. Rihanna continues to 
make waves with the back-to-school editions of her 
sneakers Creeper and Avanti while A$AP Rocky 
teamed up with PUMA to present the Inhale 
sneaker, an immediate sell-out success. PUMA 
doubled down on its culture-first approach to 
basketball by signing trailblazing footwear designer 
Salehe Bembury, to reimagine the signature shoe 
category in basketball.  
 
In terms of organisation, we welcomed Tara McRae 
as Senior Vice President Marketing and Brand 
Strategy North America. She will lead all elements of 
the North American Marketing organisation to drive 
profitable growth and build brand equity. Tara had 
already worked at PUMA previously but spent the 
past four years as the Chief Marketing Officer & 
Digital Officer at Clark‚Äôs. 
 
To be closer to our most important entertainment 
and music ambassadors, we announced that we 
would open a creative space in Los Angeles that will 
design campaigns and products for the US market. 
To support future growth in the US market from an 
operational point of view, PUMA opened a new 
distribution centre in Arizona.

Ongoing Momentum in Performance 
The success of our athletes highlights the 
performance of our products and our design and 
development teams introduced exciting new 
innovations to the market in the first half of 2024.  
 
In football, the seventh generation of the FUTURE 
boot empowers our athletes, such as Neymar Jr., Kai 
Havertz and Julia Grosso to experience a new level 
of freedom of movement. PUMA also unveiled the 
sixth edition of its speed boot ULTRA with a new 
high-performance outsole design, which generated 
great sell through.  
 
The gripping performances of PUMA-Teams Austria 
and Switzerland led to a sell-out success of the 
jerseys, while the fan shirt campaign with German 
comparison platform Check24 generated fantastic 
visibility in the summer of sports. 
 
In Running, the third iteration of PUMA‚Äôs award-
winning running shoe Deviate NITROTM is 
engineered with even more NITROFOAM‚Ñ¢ to deliver 
supreme cushioning and responsiveness. Our 
innovations are also recognised by running experts 
around the world, as PUMA‚Äôs ultimate race-day 
running shoe FAST-R2 was awarded the prestigious 
Spanish CORREDOR award for the best new shoe of 
the year. 
 
 
 
 
 
Our running models will feature prominently in our 
new global partnership with HYROX, the world 
series of fitness racing. As part of the agreement, 
PUMA will develop a full range of innovative HYROX 
apparel and bespoke footwear models. 
 
In Baskeball, PUMA used the great momentum of 
the signature basketball shoes with NBA-star 
LaMelo Ball, to expand into a signature lifestyle 
series with him. The LaFranc√© sneaker gets its 
inspiration and name from LaMelo‚Äôs official lifestyle 
brand specialising in designer streetwear. PUMA 
introduced the latest signature shoe with WNBA 
star Breanna Stewart, the Stewie 3, which apart 
from its striking design incorporates the latest of 
PUMA‚Äôs performance technology. 
 
In Golf, Cobra launched a new driver series called 
DARKSPEED. It was designed by aerospace 
engineers and is built for extraordinary speed and 
distance.  
 
Building Up Traction with Sportstyle Newness 
PUMA presented significant product newness in its 
Sportstyle offering. Maximising the current terrace 
and skate trends, we launched new versions of our 
successful Palermo and Suede XL sneakers, which 
are continuing to resonate well with our consumers. 
The classic running style Easy Rider, with its 
sought-after T-toe style, was also brought back for 
a new generation, with great feedback from our 
accounts and customers. To raise awareness for 
PUMA‚Äôs other Classics franchises, we launched the 
communications platform ‚ÄúRewrite the Classics‚Äù.
 
 
 
PUMA also helped create the next trends, as we 
showed with the successful introduction of our low-
profile styles Mostro and Speedcat. We believe 
that given our amazing archive of low-profile 
sneakers, we can own and lead this emerging trend. 
By taking PUMA‚Äôs new styles to the catwalk and 
collaborating with A$AP Rocky, renowned fashion 
designer Kid Super and others for Paris Fashion 
Week, PUMA secured in-depth coverage from the 
most prestigious fashion magazines in the world. 
Sought-after collaborations with British rapper 
Skepta, who introduced the Skope Forever sneaker 
and the football-inspired ‚ÄúM√°s Tiempo‚Äù collection, 
and a collection with best-selling anime series One 
Piece, were a sell-out success. 
 
Making Strong Progress in Sustainability 
In the first half of 2024, PUMA achieved significant 
milestones in its sustainability journey. We scaled up 
our RE:FIBRE technology, which transforms textile 
waste into new materials, and made millions of our 
replica shirts for 35 clubs and all teams at Euro 2024 
with this recycled material.  
 
In footwear, we introduced a commercial version of 
our RE:SUEDE for sale, following a successful two-
year 
composting 
experiment. 
This 
project 
demonstrated that a special version of our classic 
Suede sneaker can be turned into compost under 
certain industrial conditions. 
 


8 
 
 
 
We are encouraged that these initiatives and others, 
which are part of PUMA‚Äôs FOREVER. BETTER. 
sustainability strategy, were recognised, when 
TIME Magazine listed PUMA on the ‚ÄúWorld‚Äôs Most 
Sustainable Companies‚Äù ranking as the only 
company in our industry. 
 
Organisational Changes 
In May, Harsh Saini and Roland Kr√ºger were 
elected as independent members of the PUMA‚Äôs 
Supervisory Board for a period of three years. 
Harsh Saini is a sustainability expert and has worked 
for brands such as the Body Shop, Nike and the Fung 
Group wheras Roland Kr√ºger is an expert in the field 
of retail management, marketing, and digitalisation. 
He currently serves as a member of the Board of 
Directors of Dyson Holdings.

Sales and Earnings Development 
 
SECOND QUARTER 2024 
 
Sales 
Sales grew by 2.1% (ca) to ‚Ç¨ 2,117.3 million, while 
currencies continued to be a headwind, negatively 
impacting sales in euro terms by approximately ‚Ç¨ 50 
million in Q2 2024 (-0.2% reported). 
Sales in the Americas region increased by 9.0% (ca) 
to ‚Ç¨ 887.5 million, with both the U.S. and LATAM 
contributing to the growth and showing a sequential 
improvement. The Asia/Pacific region recorded sales 
growth of 1.9% (ca) to ‚Ç¨ 411.9 million, driven by 
continued growth in Greater China and sequential 
improvement in the rest of APAC. In the EMEA 
region, sales decreased by 4.3% (ca) to ‚Ç¨ 817.9 
million due to a decline in EEMEA from a strong prior 
year quarter (EEMEA grew +111% ca in Q2 2023), 
while Europe returned to growth. 
PUMA's Wholesale business declined by 3.3% (ca) 
to ‚Ç¨ 1,529.6 million, due to the decline in EEMEA. In 
all other regions, the wholesale business improved 
quarter-on-quarter, driven by continued good sell-
through and improved inventory levels in the trade. 
Our Direct-to-Consumer (DTC) business grew by 
19.5% (ca) to ‚Ç¨ 587.7 million, supported by 
continued brand momentum and scaled back 
promotions. Sales in owned & operated retail stores 
increased 16.5% (ca) and e-commerce increased 
 
 
 
of 27.8% (Q2 2023: 24.3%), in line with 
expectations. 
Sales in Footwear were flat (ca) at ‚Ç¨ 1,097.0 million 
on the back of a strong prior year quarter (Q2 2023: 
+18.2% ca) with all Performance categories as well 
as Sportstyle Core performing very well. Sales in 
Apparel grew by 9.2% (ca) to ‚Ç¨ 705.6 million, while 
sales in Accessories declined by 4.7% (ca) to ‚Ç¨ 314.8 
million. 
 
Gross Profit Margin 
The gross profit margin improved by 200 basis 
points to 46.8% (Q2 2023: 44.8%). Significant 
headwinds from currencies were more than offset by 
a favourable product and distribution channel mix as 
well as tailwinds from sourcing and freight. 
 
Operating Expenses 
Operating expenses (OPEX) increased by 4.3% to  
‚Ç¨ 879.3 million (Q2 2023: ‚Ç¨ 843.4 million). The 
increase was primarily due to the continued growth 
of our DTC business and ramp-up costs of 
warehouse and digital infrastructure projects while 
all non-demand creating costs remained under 
strong 
control. 
In 
addition, 
currency-related 
 
 
 
headwinds weighed on the OPEX ratio, which 
increased by 180 basis points to 41.5% (Q2 2023: 
39.8%). 
 
Operating Result (EBIT)  
The operating result (EBIT) increased by 1.6% to  
‚Ç¨ 117.2 million (Q2 2023: ‚Ç¨ 115.3 million), despite 
negative currency effects on sales, gross profit 
margin and OPEX ratio. Consequently, the EBIT 
margin improved by 10 basis points to 5.5% (Q2 
2023: 5.4%). 
 
Financial Result 
The financial result decreased to ‚Ç¨ -42.6 million (Q2 
2023: ‚Ç¨ -23.0 million) due to higher currency related 
losses and a lower interest result. 
 
Net Income and Earnings per Share 
Consequently, net income decreased by 23.8% to  
‚Ç¨ 41.9 million (Q2 2023: ‚Ç¨ 55.0 million) and earnings 
per share amounted to ‚Ç¨ 0.28 (Q2 2023: ‚Ç¨ 0.37). 
The development of the operating result and net 
income is fully in line with our expectations that the 
second half of the year, particularly in the fourth 
quarter, will be stronger than the first half, and that 
net income will improve in line with the operating 
result outlook for FY 2024.

FIRST HALF-YEAR 2024 
 
Sales 
Sales increased by 1.3% (ca) to ‚Ç¨ 4,219.6 million. 
Currencies were a major headwind, negatively 
impacting sales in euro terms by approximately  
‚Ç¨ 150 million in H1 2024 (-2.1% reported). 
 
The Americas region led the growth with a sales 
increase of 5.1% (ca) to ‚Ç¨ 1,677.5 million, followed 
by the Asia/Pacific region with a sales increase of 
1.2% (ca) to ‚Ç¨ 868.5 million, while sales in the EMEA 
region declined by 2.2% (ca) to ‚Ç¨ 1,673.7 million. 
 
PUMA‚Äôs Wholesale business declined by 3.1% (ca) 
to ‚Ç¨ 3,137.7 million as a result of disciplined sell-in 
and focus on good sell-through in preparation for a 
stronger sell-in in H2 2024. Our Direct-to-Consumer 
(DTC) business increased by 16.7% (ca) to  
‚Ç¨ 1,081.9 million. Sales in owned & operated retail 
stores increased 16.0% (ca) and e-commerce 
increased 18.1% (ca). This resulted in an increased 
DTC share of 25.6% (H1 2023: 22.8%). 
 
Among product divisions, sales in Footwear 
increased by 1.6% (ca) to ‚Ç¨ 2,278.4 million and 
Apparel grew by 3.5% (ca) to ‚Ç¨ 1,313.7 million. 
Accessories decreased by 4.0% (ca) to ‚Ç¨ 627.5 
million. 
 
 
 
 
Gross Profit Margin 
The gross profit margin increased by 150 basis 
points to 47.2% (H1 2023: 45.7%). Major 
headwinds from currencies were more than offset by 
a favourable product and distribution channel mix as 
well as tailwinds from sourcing and freight. 
 
Operating Expenses 
Operating expenses (OPEX) increased by 1.9% to  
‚Ç¨ 1,724.6 million (H1 2023: ‚Ç¨ 1,691.7 million). The 
continued growth of our DTC business and ramp-up 
costs for infrastructure projects were the main 
drivers of this increase. As a result, the OPEX ratio 
was up 160 basis points to 40.9% (H1 2023: 
39.3%), also impacted by currency headwinds. 
 
Result before Interest, Taxes, Depreciation 
and Amortisation (EBITDA) 
The result before interest, taxes, depreciation and 
amortisation (EBITDA) decreased to ‚Ç¨ 445.8 million 
in the first half of 2024 (last year: ‚Ç¨ 455.6 million). 
 
 
 
 
 
Operating Result (EBIT) 
The operating result (EBIT) decreased by 5.1% to  
‚Ç¨ 276.2 million (H1 2023: ‚Ç¨ 290.9 million), mainly 
due to negative currency effects on sales, the gross 
profit margin and the OPEX ratio, which resulted in 
an EBIT margin of 6.5% (H1 2023: 6.8%). 
 
Financial Result 
The financial result decreased to ‚Ç¨ -69.4 million (H1 
2023: ‚Ç¨ -30.8 million) due to a lower interest result 
and higher currency related losses. 
 
Net Income and Earnings per Share 
Consequently, net income decreased by 25.0% to  
‚Ç¨ 129.3 million (H1 2023: ‚Ç¨ 172.3 million) and 
earnings per share amounted to ‚Ç¨ 0.86 (H1 2023:  
‚Ç¨ 1.15). 
The development of the operating result and net 
income is fully in line with our expectations that the 
second half of the year, particularly in the fourth 
quarter, will be stronger than the first half, and that 
net income will improve in line with the operating 
result outlook for FY 2024.

Net Assets and Financial Position 
 
 
 
Working Capital 
The working capital decreased by 2.9% to ‚Ç¨ 1,643.7 
million (30 June 2023: ‚Ç¨ 1,693.0 million). 
Inventories decreased by 8.6% to ‚Ç¨ 1,961.1 million 
(30 June 2023: ‚Ç¨ 2,145.9 million). The quarter-on-
quarter increase mainly reflects the stronger order 
book for the second half of the year. The Group's 
total inventory remains at a healthy level, while 
quality has further improved. Trade receivables 
increased by 3.4% to ‚Ç¨ 1,394.7 million (30 June

Outlook 2024 
 
 
 
Global Economy 
According to the summer forecast published by the 
Kiel Institute for the World Economy (ifw Kiel) on 13 
June 2024, the moderate global economic expansion 
is likely to continue this year. The experts at ifw Kiel 
expect an increase in global production of around 
3.2% for 2024 as a whole. There are risks with 
regard to a longer than previously expected 
restrictive monetary policy. Further risks for the 
global economy are primarily of a geopolitical nature 
and result not least from the uncertainties 
surrounding the US presidential election. 
 
Investments 
Investments in fixed assets of around ‚Ç¨ 300 million 
are planned for 2024. The majority of these 
investments will be in infrastructure in order to 
create the operating conditions required for the 
planned long-term growth. The investments mainly 
concern own distribution and logistics centers, 
investments in the expansion and modernisation of 
the company's own retail stores and investments in 
IT infrastructure. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
As in previous years, PUMA will continue to focus on 
managing 
short-term 
challenges 
without 
compromising the brand's medium- and long-term 
momentum. Our sales growth and market share 
gains will take priority over short-term profitability. 
The very positive feedback from our retail partners 
and consumers on our 2024/2025 product line-up 
and go-to-market strategies gives us confidence for 
the medium and long term success and continued 
growth of PUMA
Outlook 2024 
The first half of the year was characterised by a 
volatile environment with persistent currency 
headwinds, stressed supply chains and muted 
consumer sentiment globally. In this challenging 
environment, PUMA continued to make progress on 
its strategic initiatives of brand elevation, product 
excellence and distribution quality with special focus 
on the U.S. and China, and focused on strong sell-
through and the best possible service to its retail 
partners, brand ambassadors and consumers.
Based on the results of the first half year and 
supported by building brand momentum as well as 
by our strong orderbook for the second half of the 
year, PUMA reiterates its outlook for the financial 
year 2024 of mid-single-digit currency-adjusted 
sales growth. Taking into account the external 
factors of higher freight costs, changing duties and 
continued muted consumer sentiment, especially in 
China, we narrow our outlook for the operating 
result (EBIT) to a range of ‚Ç¨ 620 million to ‚Ç¨ 670 
million. We expect net income to change in 2024 in
 line with the operating result.

Explanatory Notes to the Condensed Interim Consolidated Financial Statements (IFRS) as of 30 June 2024 
 
 
 
GENERAL REMARKS 
 
Under the ‚ÄúPUMA‚Äù brand name, PUMA SE and its 
subsidiaries (the ‚ÄúPUMA group‚Äù) are engaged in the 
development and sales of a broad range of sport and 
sportlifestyle products including footwear, apparel 
and accessories. The company‚Äôs registered head 
office is in Herzogenaurach, Federal Republic of 
Germany; its responsible court of registration is at 
F√ºrth (Bavaria).  
 
 
ACCOUNTING STANDARDS 
 
The unaudited financial report of PUMA SE and its 
subsidiaries (which together form the PUMA group) 
was prepared according to IAS 34 ‚ÄúInterim Financial 
Reporting‚Äù and should be read in connection with 
the consolidated financial statements as of 31 
December 2023. The information contained in the 
consolidated financial statements as of 31 December 
2023, apply to the financial reports for 2024, unless 
changes have been explicitly referred to.  
 
In preparing the half-year financial report, the 
accounting policies applied and explained for the 
consolidated financial statements as of 31 December 
2023 were applied consistently with the following 
exception. 
 
 
 
 
PUMA is applying the provisions of IFRS 9 for phase 
3 hedge accounting for the first time as of 1 January 
2024. Previously, the option of continuing to apply 
IAS 39 for hedge accounting was exercised. For 
reasons of materiality, PUMA does not resatate 
comparative information for previous periods. 
Consequently, an adjustment was made to the 
opening balance sheet as of 1 January 2024. For 
existing cash flow hedge relationships, the hedging 
cost approach was applied retrospectively on a 
mandatory basis for options held as at the opening 
date and voluntarily for the components of forward 
exchange contracts excluded from the designation. 
This resulted in a correction of the opening balance 
sheet in a high single-digit million euro amount, 
whereby the amount was withdrawn from retained 
earnings and allocated to other comprehensive 
income. 
 
As under IAS 39, the PUMA Group now also 
generally designates the spot component of 
currency forwards and the intrinsic value of currency 
and interest rate options in a hedging relationship 
under IFRS 9. The effective cumulative changes in 
fair value resulting from the spot component or the 
intrinsic value are initially recognised directly in 
equity in the cash flow hedge reserve in other 
comprehensive income. 
 
 
 
 
 
When accounting for currency hedges as cash flow 
hedges, the fair values of the option contracts as 
well as the forward components and the currency 
basis spreads of the forward exchange contracts are 
excluded from designation in a hedging relationship. 
For these components excluded from designation, 
the hedging cost approach is applied mandatorily for 
options and voluntarily for currency forwards. 
 
When accounting for interest rate hedges as cash 
flow hedges, the fair values of the option 
transactions are excluded from designation in a 
hedging relationship. The hedging cost approach is 
mandatory for these components excluded from 
designation. 
 
The effective cumulative changes in market value of 
the non-designated components are recognised as 
hedging costs in other comprehensive income as a 
separate item. 
 
In general, the changes in market value of the 
components designated in hedging relationships for 
foreign currency hedges accumulated in other 
comprehensive 
income 
are 
included 
in 
the 
acquisition costs when hedged non-financial assets 
are initially recognised or, in other cases, are 
reclassified to sales in the same period as the 
 
 
 


22 
 
 
 
 
 
hedged item affects profit or loss. The adjustment 
of non-financial assets affects profit or loss in the 
same way and in the same periods as the affected 
non-financial items affect profit or loss. A 
corresponding disclosure is made both in the 
statement of comprehensive income and in the 
statement of changes in equity. In the case of 
interest rate hedges, the changes in market value 
accumulated in accumulated other equity are 
reclassified to interest expense. The components 
excluded from the designation are reclassified from 
other comprehensive income to the financial result. 
 
In the unusual case for the PUMA Group that 
derivative financial instruments are not designated 
as hedging instruments, they continue to be 
classified and measured at fair value through profit 
or loss. 
 
This financial report is partly based on assumptions 
and estimates which have an impact on the amounts 
and on the breakdown of the reported assets and 
liabilities as well as of the revenues and expenses. 
The actual values may, in some exceptional cases, 
differ from these assumptions and estimates at a 
later date. The corresponding changes if and when 
they occur will be considered as soon as the findings 
are revised. The main uncertainties of estimates and 
discretionary decisions are described in the 
consolidated financial statements as of 31 December 
2023. 
 
 
 
 
 
In this regard, in line with our sales strategy, the 
assumptions relating to the allocation of planned 
cash inflows in the measurement of right-of-use 
assets for retail stores were adjusted in the first half 
of 2024 based on better experience. In the first half 
of 2024, this led to the reversal of an impairment 
loss recognised in the past and last adjusted as of 
31 December 2023 in a very low 2-digit million euro 
amount. The reversal was recognised in other 
operating income and expenses. 
 
 
SEASONAL VARIANCE 
 
The Group's sales are seasonal and result in varying 
sales and resulting profits throughout the year. Sales 
and resulting profits tend to be highest in the first 
and third quarters of the financial year and inventory 
levels tend to be lowest. This is respectively due to 
the start of the spring/summer and autumn/winter 
collections.  
 
 
 
MANAGEMENT SYSTEM 
 
Changes in sales are also influenced by currency 
exchange effects. This is why we also state any 
changes in sales in euros, the reporting currency, 
adjusted for currency exchange effects in order to 
provide information that is relevant to the decision-
making process when assessing the revenue 
position. Currency-adjusted sales are used for 
comparison purposes and are based on the values 
that would arise if the foreign currencies included in 
the consolidated financial statements were not 
converted at the average rates for the previous year, 
but were instead translated at the corresponding 
average rates for the current year. In the case of 
countries 
that 
are 
in 
a 
hyperinflationary 
environment, the previous year's amounts are not 
converted at the reporting date rates of the previous 
year, but at those of the current reporting year. As 
a result, currency-adjusted figures are not to be 
regarded as a substitute or as superior financial 
indicators, but should instead always be regarded as 
additional information. 
 
 
 


23 
 
 
 
 
 
We use the indicator working capital in order to 
assess the financial position. Working capital is 
essentially the difference between current assets - 
including in particular inventories and trade 
receivables - and current liabilities. Cash and cash 
equivalents, lease receivables, the positive and 
negative market values of derivative financial 
instruments and current finance and lease liabilities 
are not included in working capital. 
 
Net current assets include working capital line 
items plus current assets and liabilities, which are 
not part of the working capital calculation. Current 
lease liabilities are not part of the net current assets.

EARNINGS PER SHARE 
 
Earnings per share are calculated in accordance with 
IAS 33 by dividing the result for the reporting period 
by the average number of shares outstanding. The 
average number of shares outstanding also includes 
vested shares not yet issued. Shares held in treasury 
stock reduce both the number of shares outstanding 
and the diluted number of shares. Outstanding stock 
options from the management incentive programme 
can generally lead to a dilution of earnings per 
share.

DIVIDEND 
 
The Annual General Meeting on 22 May 2024 
approved a dividend of ‚Ç¨ 0.82 per share for the 2023 
financial year. The total amount of the distribution is 
‚Ç¨ 122.8 million. The dividend was paid out to the 
shareholders in the days following the Annual 
General Meeting.  
 
 
SHAREHOLDERS‚Äò EQUITY 
 
Subscribed Capital 
The subscribed capital amounts to ‚Ç¨ 150,824,640.00 
on the balance sheet date in accordance with the 
articles 
of 
association 
and 
is 
divided 
into 
150,824,640 no-par value shares with voting rights. 
This corresponds to a proportionate amount of  
‚Ç¨ 1.00 per share. 
 
Treasury Stock 
The resolution adopted by the Annual General 
Meeting on 7 May 2020 (adjusted on 5 May 2021) 
authorised the company to purchase until 6 May 
2025 its own shares to a value of up to ten percent 
of the share capital.  
 
Based on the aforementioned authorisation, the 
Management Board of PUMA SE approved a share 
buyback programme on 29 February 2024. The first 
tranche provides for the buyback of treasury shares 
with a total purchase price of up to ‚Ç¨ 100 million and 
begins in March 2024 for the period until 6 May 
2025. 
 


24 
 
 
 
 
 
 
By resolution of the Annual General Meeting on 22 
May 2024, the existing authorisation was revoked 
and the company was again authorised to acquire 
treasury shares of up to ten percent of the share 
capital until 21 May 2029.  
 
In the period from March 2024 up to and including 
30 June 2024, PUMA SE acquired 700,413 shares in 
the first tranche at a total price of ‚Ç¨ 31,291,030.36 
(excluding acquisition costs) and an average 
purchase price of approximately ‚Ç¨ 44.68 per share. 
This corresponded to 0.46% of the subscribed 
capital. 
 
The company may use the repurchased shares for 
all purposes of the authorisation granted. However, 
PUMA SE intends to cancel the repurchased shares 
in the fourth quarter of 2024.

FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS 
 
The valuation methods of the fair values according 
to levels 1 to 3 are unchanged and can be found in 
the consolidated financial statements as of 31 
December 2023. 
 
Financial instruments that are measured at fair value 
in the balance sheet were determined using the 
following hierarchy: 
 
Level 1: Use of prices quoted on active markets for 
identical assets or liabilities. 
 
Level 2: Use of input factors that do not involve the 
quoted prices stated under Level 1, but can be 
observed for the asset or liability either directly (i.e., 
as price) or indirectly (i.e., derivation of prices). 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Level 3: Use of factors for the valuation of the asset 
or liability that are based on non-observable market 
data. 
 
The fair value of the investments held for strategic 
reasons only refers to equity instruments of the 
category ‚Äúfair value through OCI‚Äù (FVOCI) and is 
determined on the basis of level 1. The market 
values of derivative assets or liabilities were 
determined on the basis of level 2.

SEGMENT REPORTING 
 
Segment reporting is based on geographical areas 
of responsibility in accordance with the PUMA 
internal reporting structure, with the exception of 
stichd. The geographical area of responsibility 
corresponds to the business segment. Sales, the 
operating 
result 
(EBIT) 
and 
other 
segment 
information are allocated to the corresponding 
geographical areas of responsibility according to the 
registered office of the respective Group company. 
 
The internal management reporting includes the 
following reporting segments: Europe, EEMEA 
(Eastern Europe, Middle East, Africa, India, South 
East Asia, Australia and New Zealand), North 
America, Latin America, Greater China, Rest of 
Asia/Pacific (excluding Greater China, South East 
Asia, Australia and New Zealand) and stichd. These 
are reported as reportable business segments in 
accordance with the criteria of IFRS 8. 
 
The reconciliation includes information on assets, 
liabilities, expenses and income in connection with 
centralised functions that do not meet the definition 
of business segments in IFRS 8. Central expenses 
and income include in particular central sourcing 
(incl. hedging), central treasury, central marketing, 
impairment losses on non-current assets and other 
global functions of the Company headquarters. 
 
The Company‚Äôs main decision-maker is defined as 
the entire Management Board of PUMA SE. 
 
 
 
 
With the exception of stichd‚Äôs sales of products 
amounting to ‚Ç¨ 30.2 million (last year: ‚Ç¨ 20.7 
million), there are no significant internal sales 
between the business segments, which are 
therefore not included in the presentation. 
 
The operating result (EBIT) of the business 
segments is defined as gross profit less the 
attributable other operating expenses plus royalty 
and commission income and other operating 
income, but not considering the costs of the central 
departments and the central marketing expenses. 
 
Since PUMA is only active in one business field, the 
sporting goods industry, products are additionally 
allocated according to the footwear, apparel and 
accessories product divisions in accordance with the 
internal reporting structure.  
 
 
EVENTS AFTER THE BALANCE SHEET DATE 
 
There were no events after the balance sheet date 
which may have a material effect on the financial 
situation and earnings position as of 30 June 2024. 
 
 
 
Responsibility Statement 
 
‚ÄúTo the best of our knowledge, and in accordance 
with the applicable reporting principles for interim 
financial reporting, the interim consolidated financial 
statements give a true and fair view of the assets, 
liabilities, financial position and profit or loss of the 
group, and the interim management report of the 
group includes a fair review of the development and 
performance of the business and the position of the 
group, together with a description of the principal 
opportunities and risks associated with the expected 
development of the group for the remaining months 
of the financial year.‚Äù
