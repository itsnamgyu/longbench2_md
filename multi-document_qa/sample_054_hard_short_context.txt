Elon Musk says he will attend Trump rally at
Pennsylvania shooting site
Republican presidential nominee returns to scene of ﬁrst
assassination attempt in July as tech CEO reiterates support
Edward Helmore and agency
Fri 4 Oct 2024 12.31 EDT
Elon Musk plans to attend Donald Trump’s rally on Saturday at the site in Butler,
Pennsylvania, where the former president narrowly avoided assassination in July.
“I will be there to support!” the tech billionaire replied to a post by Trump on Musk’s
social media platform, X, saying he was returning to the Butler Farm show grounds.
Trump’s decision to hold the rally in the same open-air venue came after a series of
harsh reports into Secret Service security failures that allowed a gunman to open ﬁre
from a rooftop on the outskirts of the fairgrounds.
Thomas Matthew Crooks, 20, injured the former president,
killed rally attender Corey Comperatore and severely wounded two others as he got
oﬀ clear shots with an assault riﬂe before he was killed by federal snipers.
Trump and his campaign have indicated they will turn the rally into a triumphant
return for the former president, as well as a way to honor those who were killed or

injured.
Comperatore’s family will attend, along with those injured in the gunﬁre, Trump
and his campaign have said.
“What you’re going to see in Butler … tomorrow is the kind of strength and
leadership that we are desperate for back in that White House. I think it’s going to be
an emotional rally,
” Lara Trump told Fox News.
The Pittsburgh Gazette said crowd estimates for Saturday’s planned event ranged
from 15,000 to as high as 100,000. The Secret Service is expecting as many as
60,000 people.
“There is a pilgrimage sense at all the rallies, but this is going to be the one,” said Jen
Golbeck, a University of Maryland professor, told the newspaper. “There are
deﬁnitely people who feel like – and say to me – the hand of God has touched
Trump.
”
Trump said, “I had God on my side” in surviving the shooting and the
“providential” moment, which also produced one of the 2024 presidential
campaign’s – and any election in US history – most potent images, with Trump rising
from a Secret Service huddle, blood streaked across his face, raising his ﬁst and
shouting “Fight!”
Religious interpretations aside, the assassination attempt was the ﬁrst of two Trump
has now faced. Last month, 58-year-old Ryan Wesley Routh allegedly aspired to
shoot the former president on Trump’s golf course in West Palm Beach, Florida.
Trump has also faced ongoing death threats from Iran, which is also blamed for
hacking into his campaign.
Trump has accused the Biden administration of intentionally denying security
resources to help Kamala Harris, the US vice-president and his Democratic opponent
in the November election, by preventing him from addressing large crowds, a
signature of his political life.
“They couldn’t give me any help. And I’m so angry about it because what they’re
doing is interfering in the election,” he said in a Fox News interview.
Changes have been made to what he can do on the campaign trail and Trump
staﬀers are on edge, the Associated Press reported. There have been death threats
directed at his aides, and his team isn’t as able to quickly organize the mass rallies he
prefers.
Armed security oﬃcers stand guard at the campaign’s Florida
headquarters, and staﬀ have been told to remain vigilant and alert.
Events have been canceled and moved around because the Secret
Service lacked the resources to safely secure them. Even with the

I hope you appreciated this article. Before you move on, I wanted to ask if you
would consider supporting the Guardian’s journalism during one of the most
consequential news cycles of our lifetimes.
We have never been more passionate about exposing the multiplying threats to
our democracy and holding power to account in America. In the heat of a
tumultuous presidential race, there is an urgent need for free, trustworthy
journalism that foregrounds the stakes of November’s election for our country and
planet.
Yet, from Elon Musk to the Murdochs, a small number of billionaire owners have a
powerful hold on so much of the information that reaches the public about what’s
happening in the world. The Guardian is diﬀerent. We have no billionaire owner or
shareholders to consider. Our journalism is produced to serve the public interest –
not proﬁt motives.
And we avoid the trap that befalls much US media: the tendency, born of a desire
to please all sides, to engage in false equivalence in the name of neutrality. We
always strive to be fair. But sometimes that means calling out the lies of powerful
people and institutions – and making clear how misinformation and demagoguery
can damage democracy.
From threats to election integrity, to the spiraling climate crisis, to complex
foreign conﬂicts, our journalists contextualize, investigate and illuminate the
critical stories of our time. As a global news organization with a robust US
reporting staﬀ, we’re able to provide a fresh, outsider perspective – one so often
missing in the American media bubble.

use of glass barricades to protect Trump on stage, there are
concerns about holding additional rallies outdoors due to fears
about drones.
Trump also now travels with a larger security footprint, with new
traﬃc restrictions outside his Mar-a-Lago home in Florida, and a
line of dump trucks and big guns on display outside Trump Tower
in New York when he is staying there.
The Secret Service spokesperson, Anthony Guglielmi, said that
Trump “is receiving heightened levels of US Secret Service
protection” and that “our top priority is mitigating risks to ensure
his continued safety at all times.
”
Leslie Osche, Butler county commissioners chair, told Pittsburgh’s Action News 4
that oﬃcials were “conﬁdent” about security at Saturday’s event.
Musk has endorsedTrump for another term in the White House. On Friday, the tech
billionaire also retweeted a post calling Saturday’s event “HISTORIC!”

FAU/MAINSTREET USA POLL: HARRIS
GAINS MOMENTUM IN WAKE OF DNC
The 2024 presidential election is just a few months away
A new poll from the Florida Atlantic University Political Communication and Public Opinion Research
Lab ( PolCom Lab (https://www.faupolling.com/polls/) ) and Mainstreet Research USA reveals
significant shifts in the 2024 U.S. presidential race, underscoring deep gender and racial divides among
voters across the nation. Watch the video analysis of this report at  faupolling.com
(https://www.faupolling.com/about/).
U.S. Vice President Kamala Harris has taken the lead over former U.S. President Donald Trump
nationally, with 47% of voters supporting her compared to Trump’s 43%. Among likely voters, Harris
leads 49% to 45%. She has gained strong support among women, with 53% backing her, while 45% of

men favor her. Trump’s base remains predominantly male, with 47% support from men, compared to
41% from women.
Harris also holds substantial advantages among Black voters (73%), Hispanic voters (51%), and white
college-educated voters (57%). Trump, however, continues to command strong support among white
voters without a college degree, with 59% favoring him.
“Since her elevation to the top of the ticket, Vice President Harris has effectively appealed to women
voters, and the gender gap has become more pronounced,” said Luzmarina Garcia, Ph.D., assistant
professor of political science at FAU. “Harris has also reestablished the Democratic Party’s advantage
with minority voters.”
Trump’s Support Erodes Among Independents
Harris has also made significant inroads among Independent voters, now capturing 48% of their
support, compared to Trump’s 35%. This marks a notable shift from July when Independents were more
evenly split, with 45% backing Harris and 43% supporting Trump.
“Trump is losing support from Independents compared to July, which could be a result of the
Democratic Party convention and remains to be watched,” said Dukhong Kim, Ph.D., associate
professor of political science at FAU. “If this pattern persists, it will be difficult for Trump to maintain an
advantage in the election.”
Congressional Voting Preferences
The poll shows that 46% of respondents would vote for the Democratic Party candidate in their district,
compared to 44% for the Republican Party candidate.
“The generic ballot illustrates just how closely divided the nation continues to be,” said Kevin Wagner,
Ph.D., professor of political science and co-director of the PolCom Lab. “It suggests that the current
default is for close and tightly contested elections.”
Election Anxiety: Mixed Emotions Ahead of 2024
The poll reveals a stark emotional divide as the election approaches, with negative emotions slightly
outweighing positive ones by 44% to 41%. This emotional split becomes more pronounced when
viewed through the lens of voting intentions:
Harris supporters: 52% positive, 35% negative
Trump supporters: 34% positive, 49% negative
Undecided voters: 23% positive, 50% negative
Notably, 27% of Democrats reported feeling excited about the election, while 32% of Republicans
expressed fear.
“While Democrats seem energized by the Harris-Walz ticket, there’s a significant undercurrent of
anxiety across the electorate,” said Carol Bishop Mills, Ph.D., professor of communication and co-
director of the PolCom Lab. “These findings highlight the intense political polarization and uncertainty
surrounding this election.”
Perception of Candidates
On the political spectrum, Harris and Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz, representing the Democratic ticket,
are generally perceived as left-leaning. Harris is viewed as more strongly on the far left (37%),
compared to Walz (28%). However, Walz is seen as more moderate, with 18% of voters placing him in
the center, compared to fewer voters unsure of Harris’ position. On the Republican side, Trump and
Vance are viewed as right-leaning, with Trump categorized as far right by 37% of voters and Vance by

30%. Trump’s position is highly polarized, with voters seeing him as either far right or far left, while
Vance has a higher percentage of voters uncertain about his placement. These perceptions highlight
the ideological divide between the two tickets.
“Although both Trump and Harris are similarly seen as conservative and liberal, respectively, Tim Walz
is viewed by voters as a more moderate candidate,” Wagner said. “That may change, but it does give
the Democrats an opportunity to appeal to the center.”
Party Lines Define Satisfaction with U.S. Democracy
The survey found that 46% of Americans are satisfied with how democracy works in the U.S., while 38%
are dissatisfied. However, the gap widens along party lines: 64% of Democrats express satisfaction
compared to just 33% of Republicans.
Despite these differences, most Americans still believe in democratic principles. A strong 74% agree
that democracy is the best system of government. This view is more common among older voters (81%
of those 50 and up) and Democrats (85%) than younger voters (65% of those under 50) and Republicans
(65%).
“The partisan and age splits on America’s democratic quality are concerning,” Kim said. “A substantial
portion of voters (38%) are either very dissatisfied or somewhat dissatisfied, which could have negative
implications for the future of our democracy.”
Social Media Influence Grows Among Young Voters
A significant portion of respondents rely on cable news (35%) and national network TV (24%) for
political information. However, a notable shift in voter consumption patterns is emerging, with social
media and podcasts becoming increasingly popular, especially among younger voters (20% for ages
18-49 vs. 7% for those 50+).
“This trend underscores the growing impact of social media influencers on public opinion,” said
Robert E. Gutsche, Jr., Ph.D., associate professor in FAU’s School of Communication and Multimedia
Studies. “With younger voters relying more on social media, the campaigns will have to reach them
there.”
Methodology
The poll surveyed 929 registered U.S. voters from Aug. 23 to 25, using a combination of Interactive
Voice Response and online panel methods. Conducted in both English and Spanish, the survey applied
weights for gender, race, education and past vote. Party identification was self-reported. A likely voter
screen was applied based on respondents’ stated voting intentions. While a precise margin of error
cannot be calculated due to the mixed methodology, a comparable probability sample of this size
would have a margin of error of +/- 3.2 percentage points at the 95% confidence level. It's important to
note that polls represent a snapshot in time and may not predict future outcomes. For full

battleground states — a dramatic reversal from the big hole President Joe
Biden was in before he abandoned his candidacy just four weeks ago.
Just on Sunday, a new ABC News/Washington Post/Ipsos national poll showed
Harris ahead by 6 points among likely voters, 51 percent to 45 percent, while a
CBS News/YouGov poll gave Harris a 3-point lead.

Harris has also seized a small lead in enough swing states to give her an
Electoral College majority, a deeply worrying sign for Trump in the crucial last
months of the campaign. The vice president held advantages of at least 4 points
in four state polls from The New York Times and Siena College — Arizona,
Michigan, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin — that alone would hand Harris
enough electoral votes to win the presidency, even if she lost the other swing
states.
The former president is still well within striking distance, even after struggling
to regain his footing against a new opponent. According to the latest
FiveThirtyEight polling averages, Trump would only need to flip one of the
three “blue wall” states — Michigan, Pennsylvania or Wisconsin — in order to
win in November, as long as he takes all of the states where he is currently
ahead of Harris in polling averages.
But the timing of Harris’ ascendance is perhaps even more notable than its
magnitude and speed. She became a candidate on July 21, just eight days after
the assassination attempt against the former president and less than 72 hours
after Trump’s acceptance speech at the Republican convention in Milwaukee.
Republicans had rallied behind Trump after the shooting and his own
convention, and he appeared to be in a much stronger position than Biden, his
opponent at the time.

In a typical campaign, the summer is the most volatile time, with the party not
currently holding the White House receiving a polling bump following its
convention — which by tradition comes first. The president’s party then
responds with a corresponding surge that usually cancels out the earlier
change.
But in this case, it’s Harris who has had the wind at her back since the
Republican convention concluded last month. It’s far from a sure thing that
Harris will continue to rise through the end of August — though some
Republicans are preparing for the possibility that Harris will have a larger lead
on Labor Day than she does now — but adding a convention bump on top of
that could position Harris as a significant favorite in the race.
AD
That’s because, historically, voters’ preferences are typically all-but-solidified
at the conclusion of the conventions, and any changes in polling after the
conventions are typically modest. But this has been anything but the typical
campaign.
Here are five takeaways from the pre-convention polling:
Trump leads on issues but trails on personality.

How is Trump trailing Harris when voters trust him more on the economy, the
issue they say is most important to their vote? Because they don’t like or trust
him more broadly.
In the ABC News/Washington Post/Ipsos poll, Americans said they trust
Trump over Harris when it comes to dealing with the economy — which nearly
nine-in-10 respondents said was very important to their vote — 46 percent to
37 percent.
But it’s clear why Harris leads after looking at the candidates’ personal
attributes.
Poll respondents are split on Harris’ image: 45 percent view the vice president
favorably, while 44 percent view her unfavorably. For Trump, only 35 percent
have a favorable opinion of him. The majority, 57 percent, view him
unfavorably.
AD
Back in July, Trump held a 31-point lead over Biden on the question of which
candidate “is in good enough physical health to serve effectively as president.”
In the new poll, the 78-year-old Trump is at a 30-point deficit on the same
question.
Similarly, Harris, 59, leads Trump on which candidate “is honest and
trustworthy” (by 15 points), “has the mental sharpness it takes to serve
effectively as president” (by 9 points), “understands the problems of people like
you” (by 7 points) and “represents your personal values” (by 6 points).
The Sun Belt is up for grabs again.
The reasons for Harris’ competitiveness in the four Sun Belt swing states go
beyond just the topline numbers. She’s attracting voters a Democratic
candidate needs in younger, more diverse states.
In the ABC News/Washington Post/Ipsos poll, Harris leads among those under
age 40, 57 percent to 37 percent, even though Biden and Trump were neck-
and-neck with the under-40 set last month.

and more. In iOS or Android.
Harris is also outrunning Biden among Black (more on that below) and
Hispanic voters, who make up large segments of the electorates in Arizona,
Georgia, Nevada and North Carolina.
Even before the June debate, Biden’s decline was especially concentrated
among young and nonwhite voters, and many of those Sun Belt states looked
out of reach. A path to an Electoral College majority still existed if he ran the
table in the Rust Belt, but Harris’ recovery gives her a chance to win even if
Trump picks off one of those northern states.
Black voters have come back to Harris.
In the ABC News/Washington Post/Ipsos poll, Black Americans broke for
Harris, 83 percent to 11 percent — far more in line with recent precedent. Same
with the New York Times/Siena College Sun Belt-state polls, in which Harris
led, 84 percent to 11 percent, among Black likely voters.
And Suffolk University/USA Today polling of Black voters in Michigan and
Pennsylvania shows Trump pulling in only about 10 percent among Black
voters, about where he was in 2020.
There are still some polls that show historically high support for Trump, as a
Republican — like last week’s Fox News poll, which had the former president
capturing 26 percent of Black voters. But generally speaking, the trend points
to Harris, who is of both Black and South Asian ancestry, winning a more
comparable share of Black voters.
Harris is winning the “democracy” argument.
Biden grounded his campaign in the argument that democracy was at stake —
and threatened if Trump won the election.
Harris isn’t being as direct with her own messaging on the issue, but she’s still
building an advantage over Trump. More than three-in-four Americans, 77
percent, say protecting democracy is at least very important to their vote in the
ABC News/Washington Post/Ipsos poll, below only the economy and inflation
and tied with health care and crime on the list of issues presented.

AD
And Harris is more trusted on protecting democracy in the poll, 43 percent to
37 percent. Similarly, Sun Belt-state likely voters gave Harris an 8-point edge
when it comes to handling democracy, 52 percent to 44 percent, in the New
York Times/Siena College poll.
Yes, the convention bump actually matters.
While it’s perhaps not surprising that candidates see their poll numbers go up
during their party’s convention — a made-for-TV infomercial for them and
their policies — that doesn’t mean the conventions don’t matter.
To that point, Harris — who leads Trump by 1.4 percentage points in the
RealClearPolitics polling average and 2.6 points in the FiveThirtyEight average
— enters her convention in a significantly weaker position than Biden in 2020,
but a stronger position than Hillary Clinton in 2016.
Clinton actually trailed Trump by less than a point in the RealClearPolitics
average at the start of the 2016 Democratic convention because Trump was
enjoying his convention bounce (the conventions were on back-to-back weeks
in July 2016 because the Olympics, which were held in the Southern
Hemisphere, began later in the summer than usual).
Historically, a party gets about a 4-point bounce from its convention, according
to the book “The Timeline of Presidential Elections: How Campaigns Do (and
Do Not) Matter.” But these bounces don’t always cancel each other out — and,
most importantly, the party that sees the greatest improvement during the
conventions “maintains its gain in the final week’s polls,” according to the
authors, Robert S. Erikson and Christopher Wlezien.
“In other words, its poll numbers do not fade but instead stay constant post-
conventions to the final week,” they write.

Watch highlights from Trump-Harris clash
Former US President Donald Trump has said he will not take part in a second TV
debate ahead of November's presidential election.
While Vice-President Kamala Harris, the Democratic Party's candidate, accepted an
invitation to the CNN debate on 23 October, Republican nominee Trump told a rally it
was "too late" as voting has already started.
Harris's campaign team said that given the former president claimed to have won their
previous debate in Philadelphia earlier this month he should accept.
Snap polls taken after that encounter suggested a majority of viewers believed the
vice-president outperformed her challenger.

After the 10 September debate, Trump said there would be no further debates.
Speaking at a rally in Wilmington, North Carolina on Saturday, he claimed victory in
that earlier head-to-head and said "it's just too late" for another.
"Voting has already started," he said, accusing Harris of seeking another round of
sparring "because she's losing badly."

Watch key moments from Harris-Trump clash
In a statement on Saturday, Harris-Walz campaign chair Jen O'Malley Dillon said that
Americans "deserve another opportunity" to see Harris and Trump debate before the
November election.
"It would be unprecedented in modern history for there to just be one general election
debate," she said. "Debates offer a unique chance for voters to see the candidates side
by side and take stock of their competing visions for America."
On X, formerly Twitter, Harris said she had "gladly" accepted the debate invitation and
hoped Trump would also take part.
CNN had said the potential debate would follow the same format as the one it
broadcast in June between Trump and President Joe Biden.
Biden's faltering performance in that encounter led some Democrats to question
whether he should be the party's candidate for the election.
After weeks of uncertainty the president announced he would not seek re-election -
paving the way for Harris to become the nominee.

At the Trump rally, some voters told the BBC they hoped another debate would take
place.
"If you're not afraid, why not? They both did great [at the last debate]," said Trump
supporter Steve Castellano.
Adding that he thought the moderators were "a little biased" at the last debate, Mr
Castellano suggested some conditions for a possible rematch.

Ros Atkins on... Were the Trump-Harris debate moderators unfair?
"They should debate again at a network Trump chooses," he said. "What I would really
love is a good podcaster [to moderate]. I'd really love Joe Rogan to do it."
Harris holds a slight lead over Trump in national polling averages, and North Carolina
could be crucial for his hopes to return to the White House.
Since then, a majority of national polls suggest that Harris has made small gains with
voters.
Trump's campaign stop in North Carolina comes after the Republican candidate he
endorsed for governor, Mark Robinson, reportedly made controversial comments on a
porn website more than a decade ago.
Robinson characterised the CNN report, which alleged that he had referred to himself
as a "black Nazi" on an adult forum, as "salacious tabloid lies".
Robinson did not attend Saturday's rally and Trump did not mention it during his 60-
minute speech to supporters.
The two candidates exchanged swipes and barbs at the previous debate, with Trump
calling Harris a "radical left liberal" and a Marxist who was destroying America.
Harris, for her part, goaded Trump, belittled the size of his rally crowds and quoted his
Republican detractors.
CBS, the BBC's news partner in the US, has also invited both presidential candidates to
participate in an October debate in Arizona.

BBC
The first showdown between Kamala Harris and Donald Trump was closely watched
not only in the US but around the world.
The debate in Philadelphia featured some tense exchanges on foreign policy between
the two presidential candidates.
From Beijing to Budapest, here's how the debate went down, according to BBC foreign
correspondents.

Mentions of Putin noted by Kremlin
By Steve Rosenberg, Russia editor, Moscow
Kamala Harris told Donald Trump that President Putin is “a dictator who would eat
you for lunch.”
10/6/24, 7:30 AM
What the world thought of Harris-Trump debate
https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c9wj9qejrpwo
1/6


The expression "to eat someone for lunch" (or breakfast, or any other meal) doesn’t
exist in Russian. But one thing you will find in Moscow is the appetite for a US election
result that benefits Russia.
The Kremlin will have noted (with pleasure) that in the debate Trump sidestepped the
question about whether he wants Ukraine to win the war.
“I want the war to stop,” replied Trump.
By contrast, Harris spoke of Ukraine’s “righteous defence” and accused Vladimir Putin
of having “his eyes on the rest of Europe”.
Later the Kremlin claimed to have been irked by all mentions of Putin in the debate.
“Putin’s name is used as one of the instruments for the internal battle in the US,”
Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov told me.
"We don’t like this and hope they will keep our president’s name out of this.”
Last week Putin claimed he was backing Harris in the election and praised her
“infectious laugh.”
Later a Russian state TV anchor clarified that Putin had been “slightly ironic” in his
comments.
The presenter was dismissive of Harris’ political skills and suggested she would be
better off hosting a TV cooking show.
I wonder: would it feature “dictators” eating US presidential candidates “for lunch"…?
Who won the debate?
Fact-checking Harris and Trump
Concern in Kyiv over Trump comments
By Nick Beake, Europe correspondent, Kyiv
Donald Trump’s failure, when asked on the debate stage to say if he wanted Ukraine to
win the war, may not have surprised people here but it adds to their worry about what
a second Trump term would bring.
Trump has long boasted he could end in the conflict in 24 hours, a prospect many
Ukrainians assume would mean an incredibly bad deal with Kyiv forced to give up
huge swathes of the land Russia has seized over the past two and a half years.
In contrast, Ukrainians will have been reassured by Kamala Harris’s responses, with
no sign she would deviate from the current position of staunch American support.
She took credit for the role she’s already played, arguing she shared important
intelligence with President Zelensky in the days before the full-scale invasion.
She then claimed Trump’s position would have been fatal for Ukraine had he still been
in the White House. “If Donald Trump were president, Putin would be sitting in Kyiv
right now.”
Publicly, there has been a deafening silence from Ukraine’s current ministers and
senior military in reaction to the debate. The figurative US electoral battle is one they
need not weigh in to while they’re consumed by real fighting at home.

It’s President Zelensky himself who so far has gone furthest in articulating, albeit
somewhat euphemistically, what a Trump victory would mean for Ukrainians.
Speaking to the BBC in July, he said it would mean “hard work, but we are hard
workers”.
Abdul memes follow Trump Taliban remarks
By Lyse Doucet, chief international correspondent
America’s longest war ended in August 2021 when it scrambled to pull out the last of
its troops, and evacuate thousands of civilians, as the Taliban swept into Kabul with
surprising speed.
That debacle made it into the debate and, not surprisingly, the issues were dodged,
dismissed, distorted.
Harris veered away from the question “do you bear any responsibility in the way that
withdrawal played out?”.
As a correspondent who followed the chaotic pullout closely, I never heard that the
vice-president was in the room when decisions were taken in those final fateful weeks.
But she made it clear she agreed with President Biden’s decision to leave.
Trump boasted that he talked tough with “Abdul”, the “head of the Taliban” who is
“still the head of the Taliban.”
He seemed to be referring to Abdul Ghani Baradar, who signed the withdrawal deal
with the US. But he never headed the Taliban, and has been sidelined since the
Taliban takeover.
The mention immediately prompted a wave of internet memes featuring “Abdul” with
people named Abdul weighing in, and others asking “who is Abdul?”
Both contenders focused on the flawed deal with the Taliban. The truth is that the
Trump team negotiated this exit plan; the Biden team hastily enacted it.
Trump said the deal was good because “we were getting out”.
There were no good ways to go. But the departure turned into a disaster and all sides
are to blame.
Harris represents uncertainty for Beijing
By Laura Bicker, China correspondent, Beijing
Kamala Harris was an unknown quantity to leaders here and she still is, even after the
debate.
She has no track record on China and on the debate stage she simply repeated her line
that the US, not China, would win the competition for the 21st Century.
The vice-president represents something China does not like - uncertainty.
That is why President Xi recently used a visit by US officials to call for “stability”
between the two superpowers, perhaps a message to the current vice-president.

The prevailing view among Chinese academics is that she will not stray too far from
President Biden’s slow and steady diplomatic approach.
But on the debate stage she went on the attack and accused Donald Trump of “selling
American chips to China to help them improve and modernise their military”.
Donald Trump has made it clear he plans has to impose 60% tariffs on Chinese goods.
This will add to the tariffs he imposed as president which started a trade war in 2018.
China retaliated, and numerous studies suggest this caused economic pain for both
sides.
This is the last thing China wants right now as it is trying to manufacture and export
goods to rescue its economy.
For Chinese leaders, this debate will have done little to assuage beliefs that Trump
represents something else they don’t like - unpredictability.
But in truth, there is little hope here that US policy on China will change significantly,
no matter who sits in the White House.
Six highlights from Harris and Trump on stage
Undecided Americans impressed by Harris
White House race keenly watched in Middle
East
By Paul Adams, international correspondent, Jerusalem
The two candidates did not stray much from their previously stated positions last
night, even if Trump did add, with characteristic hyperbole, that Israel wouldn’t exist
in two years if his opponent becomes president.
Here in the Middle East, the race for the White House is being keenly watched.
With the war in Gaza raging and a ceasefire deal still elusive, some of Benjamin
Netanyahu’s critics suspect that Israel’s prime minister is deliberately stalling until
after the election, in the hope that Trump will be more sympathetic to Israel than
Harris.
There’s a whiff of history perhaps being about to repeat itself.
In 1980, Ronald Reagan’s campaign team was suspected of urging Iran not to release
American hostages held in Tehran until after he had beaten President Jimmy Carter,
saying Reagan would give Iran a better deal.
Could something similar be afoot now? Certainly Netanyahu’s opponents believe he is
now the chief obstacle to a ceasefire deal.
Harris has indicated that she might be tougher on Israel than Joe Biden, something
Trump has seized on, saying last night that the vice-president “hates Israel”.
Palestinians, deeply sceptical about Donald Trump but dismayed by the Biden
administration’s inability to stop the war in Gaza, are possibly inclined to see Harris as
the lesser of two evils.
They’ve long since abandoned any notion of the US as an honest broker in the Middle
East, but will have noticed that Harris, unlike Trump, says she’s committed to

Praise for Orban makes waves in Hungary
By Nick Thorpe, Central Europe correspondent, Budapest
Donald Trump showered praise on the Hungarian prime minister.
"Viktor Orban, one of the most respected men, they call him a strong man. He's a tough
person. Smart..."
Hungarian pro-government media picked up on the compliment. "Huge recognition!"
ran the headline in Magyar Nemzet.
But government-critical news portal 444 quoted Tim Walz, running mate of Harris.
"He [Trump] was asked to name one world leader who was with him, and he said
Orban. Dear God. That's all we need to know.’
Viktor Orban backed Trump for president in 2016 and is strongly backing him again in
November.
The two men met for the second time this year at Trump’s home in Florida on 12 July,
after Orban visited Kyiv, Moscow and Beijing in quick succession.
The Orban government is banking both on Trump’s victory and his ability to swiftly
end the war in Ukraine.
"Things are changing. If Trump comes back, there will be peace. It will be established
by him without the Europeans," Balazs Orban, Viktor Orban’s political director, told
the BBC in July.

Kamala Harris has challenged Donald Trump to a second debate before the United States presidential election, saying
she “will gladly accept” to go head-to-head again against the former president.
In a statement on Saturday, Harris’s campaign spokesperson Jen O’Malley said the US vice president had accepted
CNN’s invitation to a debate on October 23.

“We look forward to Vice President Harris again having the opportunity in the CNN debate to show her command of
the issues and why it’s time to turn the page on Donald Trump and charge a new way forward for America,” O’Malley
said.
More than 67 million people tuned in to the first Harris-Trump showdown on September 10, which saw the two candi‐
dates trade barbs on immigration, foreign policy, and other issues.
Most observers crowned Harris the winner of that debate, as she repeatedly appeared to rattle Trump over the course
of the evening.

Trump had posted on his Truth Social media platform earlier this month that, “THERE WILL BE NO THIRD
DEBATE!”
Trump echoed that at a campaign rally in North Carolina on Saturday, saying it was “too late” to hold another show‐
down with Harris.
“The problem with another debate is that it’s just too late, voting has already started,” he said, as reported by US news
outlets.
While election day is November 5, early voting began this week in some US states.
In 2020, the final presidential debate ahead of the election was on October 22. Four years earlier, when Trump went
up against Democrat Hillary Clinton, the third and final presidential debate was on October 19.
CNN has said the proposed October 23 debate would mirror the format of one held in June between Trump and
Democrat Joe Biden.
Biden’s poor performance in that debate spurred questions about his age and ability to serve another term, and weeks
later, he dropped out of the 2024 race.
“Both Vice President Harris and former President Trump received an invitation to participate in a CNN debate this fall
as we believe the American people would benefit from a second debate between the two candidates for President of the
United States,” CNN said in a statement.

“We look forward to receiving a response from both campaigns so the American public can hear more from these can‐
didates as they make their final decision.”
Close race
Most polls show Trump and Harris locked in a close fight in the run-up to the upcoming vote, particularly in battle‐
ground states that will be key to winning the White House.
According to a New York Times polling tracker, Harris on Saturday held a slim lead of 49 percent support nationally
compared with Trump’s 47 percent support.
It is not clear whether debates actually have an effect on presidential campaigns, with most experts saying the impact
is minimal.

Nevertheless, Elaine Kamarck and William A Galston, election experts at the Brookings Institution think tank in
Washington, DC, said the September Harris-Trump debate appeared “likely to put new wind in Harris’ sales”.
“Whether it will be enough to propel her to victory in the Electoral College remains to be seen. But her campaign and
supporters leave the debate with renewed energy and hope,” they wrote.
“By contrast, the Trump campaign must reckon with the likelihood that their candidate’s performance pleased his base
without rallying many new supporters to his side.”

Harris accepts invitation for 2nd presidential
debate, Trump says "it's just too late" for another
one
By Lucia Suarez Sang
Updated on: September 21, 2024 / 9:29 PM EDT / CBS News
Vice President Kamala Harris has accepted CNN's invitation for a possible
second debate and has challenged former President Donald Trump to join her.
Harris campaign chair Jen O'Malley Dillon said in a statement Saturday that the
Democratic nominee is "ready for another opportunity to share a stage with
Donald Trump" and accepted the network's invitation to a debate on Oct. 23.
"The American people deserve another opportunity to see Vice President
Kamala Harris and Donald Trump debate before they cast their ballots,"
O'Malley Dillon said.

In a separate statement posted on X, Harris called on Trump to join her on the
debate stage.
At a rally in Wilmington, North Carolina on Saturday, the former president
argued it was "too late" to have another presidential debate with 45 days left
until Election Day.
"The problem with another debate is that it's just too late, voting has already
started," Trump said, adding: "Now she wants to do a debate right before the
election with CNN because she's losing badly." 
The Harris campaign was quick to call for a second debate between the two
nominees shortly after their Sept. 10 meeting on ABC wrapped. Trump has
said he won't do another one after participating in a CNN debate against
President Biden in June.
"Donald Trump should have no problem agreeing to this debate," O'Malley
Dillon said. "It is the same format and setup as the CNN debate he attended

and said he won in June, when he praised CNN's moderators, rules, and
ratings."
CNN reported the debate would mirror the one between Trump and Biden and
it would also take place in Atlanta.
Mr. Biden's poor performance in the June debate led to weeks of calls for him
to drop out of the race. On July 23, the president stepped aside in his
reelection bid and endorsed Harris.
Meanwhile, the vice presidential contenders – Gov. Tim Walz and Sen. JD
Vance – are scheduled to participate in their own debate hosted by CBS News
on Oct. 1.
