Sanofi Delivers Solid Sales and Business EPS Growth at CER Amidst Successful 
Product Launches and Advancements in Immunology Pipeline 
Paris, February 1, 2024
Q4 2023 sales growth of 9.3% at CER and business EPS(1) increase of 8.2% at CER
• Specialty Care grew 13.7% driven by Dupixent and ALTUVIIIO launch performance, more than offsetting 
competition from generics of Aubagio in all key markets
• Vaccines sales increased strongly (up 21.1%) mainly as a result of the unprecedented uptake of Beyfortus, 
reaching €410 million in the second quarter of its launch  
• General Medicines decline moderated (down 2.4%), reflecting accelerated growth of core assets (up 6.3%), offset 
by lower sales of Lantus and non-core asset divestment
• CHC rose 8.5% due to Digestive Wellness and Physical and Mental Wellness which benefited from Qunol 
acquisition
Full-year 2023 delivered 5.3% sales growth and 5.4% business EPS growth at CER
• Sales reached €43,070 million driven by Dupixent (€10,715 million, +34.0%, adding €2.8bn at CER), Vaccines 
(up 8.3%) which benefited from strong launch performance of Beyfortus (€547 millions) and CHC (+6.3%)
• Business EPS(1) of €8.11 down 1.8% on a reported basis and up 5.4% at CER 
• IFRS EPS of €4.31 (down 35.6%) mainly reflecting an impairment loss of technology assets resulting from de-
prioritization of R&D programs and a charge related to the liability remeasurement of expected future royalty 
payments on U.S. Beyfortus sales, which mainly occurred in Q4
• Board held on January 31, proposes annual dividend of €3.76 an increase of 5.6%
R&D transformation and Key milestones in Q4
• Strong pipeline including record 12 blockbuster opportunities under clinical evaluation detailed at recent R&D Day
• Dupixent submitted for COPD (Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease) in the U.S., EU, and China
• Sarclisa delivered positive phase 3 results in 1L transplant-ineligible Multiple Myeloma (IMROZ)
Progress on Corporate Social Responsibility strategy in Q4
• Sanofi Global Health Unit announced three new investments through its Impact Fund to support healthcare start-
ups in Sub-Saharan Africa
• Sanofi at COP28: supporting the decarbonization of healthcare systems
Full-year 2024 business EPS guidance
• Sanofi expects 2024 business EPS(1) to remain roughly stable excluding the impact of an expected effective tax 
rate increase to 21% and decrease low single-digit(2) at CER including the higher expected tax rate, barring 
unforeseen major adverse events. Applying average January 2024 exchange rates, the currency impact on 2024 
business EPS is estimated between -3.5% to -4.5%. 
Paul Hudson, Sanofi Chief Executive Officer, commented:
“2023 marked a critical year on our journey to become a development-driven, tech-powered biopharma company 
committed to serving patients and accelerating growth. We have delivered another year of strong underlying 
performance of our core drivers in Specialty Care and Vaccines supported by the outstanding launch execution of 
Beyfortus, Altuviiio and Tzield. With scientific news flow at an all-time high, pipeline advances and 12 potential 
blockbusters in late-stage development including amlitelimab, frexalimab and tolebrutinib, our R&D transformation 
has reached an inflection point on the road to industry leadership in immunology. Looking forward, we remain 
committed to investing in R&D to fully unlock the value of our pipeline, powered by AI at scale, and continue to focus 
on our expected launch opportunities such as Dupixent in COPD. At the same time, we are taking steps to become a 
pure-play biopharma company with more than €10bn sales contribution from Pharma launches by 2030(4).”

In the U.S., fourth-quarter sales increased 10.1% to €4,876 million. The strong performance of 
Dupixent as well as the launches of Beyfortus and ALTUVIIIO were partially offset by the impact of generic 
competition on Aubagio and Mozobil as well as lower sales of influenza vaccines and Lantus.
In Europe, fourth-quarter sales were up 0.6% (to €2,651 million) driven by Dupixent, and the launch of 
Beyfortus, which were partially offset by the impact of generic competition on Aubagio and lower sales of 
Lantus and CHC.
In the Rest of World region, fourth-quarter sales increased 14.7% (to €3,392 million), mainly driven by 
Dupixent, General Medicines core assets, influenza Vaccines and CHC. Sales in China increased 19.2% to 
€644 million driven by Dupixent, Toujeo and Plavix.

In the fourth quarter, Dupixent (collaboration with Regeneron) sales increased 31.3% to €2,990 million. 
In the U.S., Dupixent sales of €2,299 million (up 28.2%) were driven by continued strong demand in the 
approved indications: atopic dermatitis (AD), asthma, chronic rhinosinusitis with nasal polyposis 
(CRSwNP), eosinophilic esophagitis and prurigo nodularis. Dupixent total prescriptions (TRx) increased 
30% (year-over-year) and new-to-brand prescriptions (NBRx) grew 24%. In Europe, fourth-quarter 
Dupixent® sales grew 32.5% to €329 million reflecting continued growth in AD, asthma and CRSwNP. In 
the Rest of World region, fourth-quarter sales reached €362 million, up 52.5%, driven mainly by sales in 
Japan and China. In 2023, Dupixent® sales reached €10,715 million, up 34.0%.
Aubagio sales decreased 74.0% in the fourth quarter to €121 million, reflecting competition from 
generics across all regions, including Europe where generics entered the market at the end of September 
2023.
Fourth-quarter sales of the Pompe Franchise (Nexviazyme/Nexviadyme + Myozyme/Lumizyme) 
were at €291 million (up 11.0%). Nexviazyme/Nexviadyme sales were €131 million, up +115.4% (of 
which €76 million in the U.S.) driven by the conversion of Myozyme/Lumizyme in the eligible Pompe 
population (late-onset disease) and by new patient accruals. Conversely, Myozyme/Lumizyme sales 
decreased 20.4% to €160 million reflecting the conversion to Nexviazyme/Nexviadyme. Nexviazyme®/
Nexviadyme sales now represent 45% of Global Pompe sales. 
Fourth-quarter Fabrazyme sales increased 9.2% to €242 million, mainly reflecting new patient accruals 
across all three geographic regions, partially offset by unfavorable shipment patterns in the Rest of the 
World region. 
                                                                                                                                           3                   


Cerezyme /Cerdelga sales were up 7.4% to €209 million, reflecting growth in high inflationary countries 
(Argentina and Turkey) in the Rest of World region.
Eloctate sales were €103 million in the fourth quarter, down 21.0%, reflecting the uptake of 
ALTUVIIIO.
ALTUVIIIO, a once-weekly first-in-class high-sustained factor VIII therapy for hemophilia A that offers 
significant bleed protection, was launched at the end of March 2023 in the U.S. and generated sales of 
€94 million in the fourth quarter. ALTUVIIIO was launched in Japan in the fourth quarter.
Fourth-quarter Alprolix sales were €142 million, up 6.4%, driven by the U.S., which largely offset lower 
sales to Sobi recorded in the Rest of World region.
Sarclisa sales were €103 million, up 30.2%, driven by strong growth in the U.S. and the Rest of the 
Word region. 
Fourth-quarter Jevtana sales decreased 5.7% to €77 million due to generic competition in Europe and 
lower sales in the U.S., reflecting increased competition. 
Cablivi sales decreased 3.2% to €58 million in the fourth quarter primarily reflecting lower sales in the 
U.S. 
Sales of Xenpozyme were €26 million in the fourth quarter driven by the U.S.

In the fourth quarter, core assets sales increased 6.3% (to €1,576 million), mainly driven by the 
performance of Plavix, Toujeo, Rezurock, and Praluent partially offset by lower sales of Mozobil due to 
generic competition, which started in the U.S. in July 2023. In 2023, core asset sales increased by 3.3% 
to €6,270 million.
Fourth-quarter Lovenox sales remained roughly stable (-0.3%) to €263 million, reflecting biosimilar 
competition as well as VBP (Value Base Procurement) impact in China, which was largely offset by growth 
in some other countries in the rest of the World Region. 
Fourth-quarter Toujeo sales increased 11.4% to €278 million driven by China where its market share 
now exceeds that of Lantus. In the U.S., sales decreased mainly due to a shift in channel mix, resulting in 
a lower average net price.
Plavix fourth quarter sales were up 13.1% to €254 million driven by China.
Praluent fourth-quarter sales were €118 million, up 26.0%, driven by Europe and the Rest of the Word 
region.
Sales of Rezurock were €86 million, up 44.4% in the fourth quarter driven by new patient adoption and 
improved patient adherence in the U.S.
In the fourth quarter, TZIELD sales were €10 million, reflecting the anticipated gradual ramp up in the 
U.S., which is supported by early patient identification programs. In 2023, consolidated sales of TZIELD 
were €25 million.
Mozobil sales were down 50.7% to €33 million in the fourth quarter, reflecting the entry of generic 
competition in the U.S. in July. Sanofi expects generic competition to enter the European market in 2024.
                                                                                                                                           4                   
2 Sanofi has prioritized core assets in its General Medicines portfolio with differentiated and/or established profiles that have significant opportunity for 
growth in key markets. 


Non-core assets 
In the fourth quarter, non-core assets sales decreased 11.6% to €1,252 million, mainly due to lower 
sales of Lantus and divestments (-4.2 ppt). In 2023, non-core-asset sales decreased by 16.5% to €5,524 
million.
Lantus sales were €277 million, down 24.9% in the fourth quarter. In the U.S., sales decreased 68.7% 
(to €34 million), reflecting lower net pricing as a result of a change in channel mix and a shelf-stock 
adjustment  in anticipation of the previously announced 2024 U.S. list price decrease.

In the fourth quarter, Vaccines sales increased 21.1% (to €1,986 million) driven by strong Beyfortus 
uptake partly offset by lower Influenza vaccines sales compared to last year and COVID-19 vaccines sales 
recorded in the fourth quarter of 2022. In 2023, Vaccines sales reached €7,474 million, up 8.3%.
Beyfortus sales reached €410 million in the fourth quarter, reflecting the progressive implementation of 
“All Infant Protection programs” in the U.S., France and Spain. In 2023, Beyfortus sales reached €547 
million.
Influenza vaccines sales decreased 4.0% to €741 million in the fourth quarter due to lower vaccination 
rates and increased competition in the U.S. Rest of the World region increased 80.7% as a result of 
favorable delivery phasing compared to fourth quarter of 2022. Full-year 2023 influenza sales decreased 
5.5% to €2,669 million.
Polio/Pertussis/Hib (PPH) vaccines sales increased 3.4% to €434 million driven by the favorable 
Pentacel CDC buying pattern in the U.S. and increased sales in Rest of the World region. In the U.S., 
Vaxelis became market leader in the three doses primary series market at the end of 2023. Vaxelis in-
market sales are not consolidated and the profits are shared equally between Sanofi and Merck & Co.
Meningitis, Travel and endemic vaccines sales increased 10.4% (to €242 million) reflecting favorable 
CDC buying pattern in the U.S. while the divestment of the Japanese Encephalitis vaccine in 2022 
impacted the Rest of the World Region. 
Booster vaccines sales decreased 1.4% in the fourth quarter to €139 million, reflecting lower sales in the 
Rest of the World region.
Biopharma business operating income
In the fourth quarter, business operating income (BOI) of Biopharma decreased 2.8% to €2,279 
million. At CER, Biopharma BOI was up 6.2% reflecting higher gross profit more than offsetting lower 
capital gains as compared to the fourth quarter of 2022 and litigation-related reserves. The ratio of BOI to 
net sales decreased 1.2 ppts to 23.5% (24.0% at CER). 
In 2023 business operating income of Biopharma decreased 2.1% to €11,247 million (up 4.8% at CER). 
The ratio of BOI to net sales decreased 0.7 ppts to 29.7% (30.3% at CER). 
R&D update at the end of the fourth quarter 2023
Regulatory update 
•
The supplemental Biologics License Application (sBLA) of Dupixent (dupilumab) in Chronic 
Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD) in the U.S. was completed in December 2023 and for China in 
2024, following its Marketing Authorization Application (MAA) submission in Europe. The submission 
was based on overwhelming positive results from an interim analysis of the Phase 3 replicate trial 
NOTUS, along with positive results from the previous Phase 3 trial BOREAS.
                                                                                                                                           5                   


The NOTUS trial, evaluating Dupixent compared to placebo in adults currently on maximal standard-
of-care triple inhaled therapy with uncontrolled COPD and evidence of type 2 inflammation, met its 
primary endpoint with overwhelming efficacy, showing significantly reduced exacerbations by 34% 
compared to placebo, confirming results from the landmark BOREAS pivotal trial. The results also 
proved that treatment with Dupixent led to rapid and significant improvements in lung function (by 
139 mL from baseline in FEV1) compared to placebo (by 57 mL from baseline in FEV1) by 12 weeks 
and were sustained at 52 weeks.
•
The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) accepted for review the sBLA of Kevzara for the 
treatment of Polyarticular Juvenile Idiopathic Arthritis, with a PDUFA date of June 10, 2024.
•
The National Medical Products Administration (NMPA) in China approved Beyfortus (nirsevimab) for 
the prevention of respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) lower respiratory tract infection (LRTI) in neonates 
and infants entering or during their first RSV season.
•
The European Medicines Agency’s (EMA) Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP) 
adopted a positive scientific opinion of Fexinidazole Winthrop as the first oral treatment of acute 
form of sleeping sickness (Trypanosoma brucei rhodesiense), a lethal form of this parasitic disease 
found in Eastern and Southern Africa, in adults and children six years of age or older and weighing at 
least 20 kg. 
Portfolio update
Phase 3:
•
The IMROZ trial evaluating the investigational use of Sarclisa (isatuximab) in combination with 
standard-of-care bortezomib, lenalidomide and dexamethasone (VRd) met its primary endpoint at a 
planned interim analysis for efficacy, demonstrating statistically significant improvement in 
progression-free survival compared with VRd alone in transplant-ineligible patients with newly 
diagnosed multiple myeloma. The data will be the basis for future regulatory submission.
Additionally, the European Myeloma Network-sponsored IsKia Phase 3 trial investigating Sarclisa in 
combination with carfilzomib, lenalidomide and dexamethasone (KRd) showed a statistically 
significant improvement in the rate of minimal residual disease negativity, compared with KRd alone, 
after autologous stem cell transplant consolidation in transplant-eligible patients with newly 
diagnosed multiple myeloma. The results were presented at the American Society of Hematology 
(ASH) 2023 annual meeting.

•
An Independent Data Monitoring Committee found that tusamitamab ravtansine as a monotherapy 
did not meet its dual primary endpoint of progression-free survival compared to docetaxel. Despite 
an improved overall survival trend, termination of the program was based on non-improvement in 
PFS at the final analysis. Tusamitamab ravtansine had a similar safety profile as previously presented 
with a lower incidence of various important clinical categories of adverse events versus docetaxel. 
Trial participants will have the option to stay on their current therapy if they are benefitting, as 
deemed by their provider, or to transition to an appropriate standard-of-care therapy. Sanofi will 
continue exploring the potential of tusamitamab-based antibody-drug conjugates and CEACAM5

In the fourth quarter, Consumer Healthcare (CHC) sales were up 8.5% to €1,215 million supported by 
growth in the Rest of World region and the U.S. which includes the acquisition of Qunol. The divestments 
of non-core products had a negative impact of -2.3 ppts, mainly reflected in the non-core/others category 
in the fourth quarter. In 2023, total CHC sales reached €5,180 million, up 6.3%. Excluding divestments 
and Qunol acquisition, CHC organic sales growth was 4.8% in the fourth quarter, and 6.6% in 2023. 
In the U.S., fourth quarter CHC sales increased by 10.1% to €341 million driven by the consolidation of 
Qunol sales this quarter in Physical and Mental Wellness category more than offsetting lower Allegra 
demand. 
In Europe, fourth quarter CHC sales decreased by 5.4% to €353 million mainly due to lower sales of 
Cough & Cold categories and Digestive Wellness as well as divestments of non-core products.
In Rest of World, fourth quarter CHC sales increased 17.1% to €521 million, driven by strong 
performance of the Digestive Wellness category.
CHC business operating income
In the fourth quarter, business operating income (BOI) of CHC increased 3.1% to €304 million. At 
CER, the BOI of CHC was up 22.7% mainly reflecting the consolidation of Qunol. The ratio of BOI to net 
sales increased 1.2 ppts to 25.0% (26.9% at CER) compared to the fourth quarter of 2022. 
In 2023, BOI of CHC decreased 5.5% to €1,438 million. At CER, BOI of CHC grew 4.7% mainly driven by 
higher sales which more than offset OPEX growth. The ratio of BOI to net sales decreased 1.6 ppts to 
27.8% (down 0.5 ppts to 28.9% at CER).

Access to healthcare
Sanofi Global Health Unit announces three new investments through its Impact Fund to 
support healthcare start-ups in Sub-Saharan Africa
The Sanofi Global Health Unit (GHU) Impact Fund completed three further investments in Q4.  
Viebeg Technologies is leveraging its proprietary data and artificial intelligence (AI) technology to make 
quality medical equipment more accessible and affordable to healthcare providers with a ‘one-stop-shop’ 
procurement platform, flexible payment terms, and a digital inventory management system to optimize 
stock and automate reorders. Viebeg currently operates in Rwanda, Democratic Republic of Congo, and 
Kenya, and plans to expand in additional countries. Sanofi’s investment will support Viebeg’s efforts to 
strengthen their pharmacy segment and to assess the opportunity to expand its product offering to drugs.
mPharma provides innovative services, such as vendor-managed inventory services, data analytics and 
primary care solutions for community pharmacies. mPharma currently operates in Ghana, Nigeria, Kenya, 
Uganda, Zambia and Rwanda. Sanofi investment in mPharma and in-house business expertise will 
support its expansion in countries including Togo, Benin, Tanzania and Uganda. 
The third new investment with Dawa Mkononi, a wholesaler utilizing a business-to-business e-
marketplace and last-mile delivery services, supports strengthening existing operations in Tanzania and 
expansion possibilities in Mozambique and Rwanda. 
EMA gives positive opinion to Fexinidazole Winthrop as first oral treatment of sleeping 
sickness (rhodesiense)
Sleeping sickness, or human African trypanosomiasis (HAT), is usually fatal without treatment, and is 
transmitted by the bite of infected tsetse flies, which are found in 36 African countries. In December 
2023, Sanofi, DNDi and the HAT-r-ACC consortium announced the CHMP (EMA) has adopted a positive 
scientific opinion of Fexinidazole Winthrop for the treatment in patients 6 years of age or older of both 
first-stage (haemo-lymphatic) and second-stage (meningo-encephalitic) Trypanosoma brucei (T.b.) 
rhodesiense sleeping sickness. A positive opinion of both stages of the more common form (T.b. 
gambiense, found in West and Central Africa) was adopted in 2018. 
This second positive opinion demonstrates Sanofi’s 23 year commitment to develop innovative therapies 
to fight sleeping sickness and paves the way for updated WHO guidelines on the treatment of the T.b. 
rhodesiense form of sleeping sickness. Once the guidelines are updated, Foundation S, Sanofi’s 
philanthropic organization will donate Fexinidazole Winthrop to the World Health Organization. 
Sanofi is committed to contribute to the elimination of sleeping sickness by 2030, supporting the WHO 
Neglected Tropical Diseases roadmap.

Sanofi at COP28: supporting the decarbonization of healthcare systems
Health was for the first time on the official agenda of the COP28 with a dedicated Health Day with 143 
countries signing a declaration on climate and health. Sanofi, with a delegation led by CEO Paul Hudson, 
held discussions with health ministers, healthcare actors and NGOs willing to engage in low-carbon and 
climate resilient healthcare systems. Sanofi showcased its commitments on climate change and health, 
going beyond its own operations and Foundation S stressed the importance of channeling philanthropic 
funds to help vulnerable populations adapt to climate change.
As a company committed to fight climate change and its impact on health, Sanofi has taken the lead of 
the Sustainable Markets Initiative (SMI) - Patient Care Pathways Working Group. In this context, Sanofi is 
working to decarbonize the delivery of healthcare that accounts for 45% of global healthcare systems 
emissions by: 
•
Re-thinking the delivery of care, creating healthcare systems that are low carbon, resilient and more 
equitable, and that detect disease early and provide access to high-quality therapies using the latest 
innovations. For example, by implementing an all-infant immunization policy, the emission of the 
current management of RSV infections in some countries could be reduced up to 68%.
•
Advancing transparency in how we collectively contribute to actioning real change that improves 
health outcomes. For example, by setting up a standardized, data-driven Life Cycle Assessment 
framework (LCA) to measure the environmental footprint of Sanofi’s products – from manufacturing 
and supply chain to the end-life of the product. 
                                                                                                                                           9                   


Sanofi’s strategy to contribute to the fight against climate change and its impact on people’s health is 
grounded in two focus areas:
•
Reducing the impact of its activities and products on the environment: between 2019 and 2023 we 
reduced our scope 1 and 2 carbon emissions by 38%, achieving top tier internationally recognized 
scores in the mitigation of climate change impact. Sanofi is implementing an action plan to arrive at 
net zero emissions by 2045.
•
Bringing innovative, science-based solutions to tackle new or existing diseases exacerbated by climate 
change, especially in heavily affected areas such as respiratory diseases, allergies, diabetes, 
cardiovascular disease, or infectious diseases. 
ESG ratings
Sanofi’s DJSI ranking improved with a score of 79/100
This achievement places Sanofi among the top-performing companies of the DJSI index and enables its 
inclusion in the DJSI World and DJSI Europe indexes. The improvement was driven both by a reduction of 
the negative score impact of a product-related controversy due to increased transparency on the issue 
and by performance increases in the Governance and Environmental dimensions.

Fourth-quarter and full-year 2023 financial results
Business Net Income3
In the fourth quarter of 2023, Sanofi generated net sales of €10,919 million, an increase of 1.8% (up 
9.3% at CER). Full-year 2023 net sales were €43,070 million, up 0.2% (up 5.3% at CER).
Fourth-quarter other revenues increased 75.4% (up 90.8% at CER) to €1,282 million, including higher 
VaxServe sales of non-Sanofi products of €711 million (up 82.8% at CER) as well as €411 million 
COVID-19 related revenues. In 2023, other revenues increased 41.1% (up 50.0% at CER) to €3,374 
million, including VaxServe sales of non-Sanofi products of €2,167 million (up 43.8% at CER) and 
COVID-19 vaccine related revenues (€505 million).
Fourth-quarter Gross Profit increased 5.8% (up 13.5% at CER) to €8,167 million. The gross margin ratio 
increased 2.8 ppts to 74.8% (74.8% at CER) compared with the same period of 2022. This increase 
mainly reflected an improvement of the Biopharma gross margin ratio (from 73.3% to 76.5%) due to 
favorable Specialty Care product mix, as well as the COVID-19 related revenues and was partially offset 
by the impact of generic competition on Aubagio and lower net pricing of Lantus in the U.S. CHC gross 
margin ratio decreased from 61.8% to 61.5% due to currency effect and was up 0.2 ppt at CER benefiting 
from Qunol consolidation. In 2023, the gross margin ratio increased 1.1 ppts to 74.8% (74.9% at CER) 
driven by Biopharma which benefited from COVID-19 vaccine related revenues. 
Research and Development (R&D) expenses increased 2.7% to €1,872 million in the fourth quarter. At 
CER, R&D expenses were up 6.6%, reflecting increased expenses in Vaccines. In 2023, R&D expenses

Fourth-quarter selling general and administrative expenses (SG&A) increased 1.2% to €2,931 
million. At CER, SG&A expenses were up 7.4%, reflecting increased commercial investments and launch 
costs in Specialty Care and Vaccines as well as higher CHC commercial expenses. In the fourth quarter, 
the ratio of SG&A to sales decreased 0.2 ppt to 26.8% compared to the prior year. In 2023, SG&A 
expenses increased 1.9% to €10,692 million (up 6.1% at CER) and the ratio of SG&A to sales was 0.4 
percentage point higher at 24.8% compared to 2022.
Fourth-quarter and full-year 2023 operating expenses were €4,803 million (up 1.8% and up 7.1% at 
CER) and €17,420 million (up 1.3% and 4.9% at CER), respectively.
Fourth-quarter other current operating income net of expenses was -€821 million compared to 
-€276 million in the fourth quarter of 2022. Other current operating income net of expenses included an 
expense of €889 million (compared to an expense of €659 million in the fourth quarter of 2022) 
corresponding to the share of profit to Regeneron from the monoclonal antibodies Alliance, the share of 
profit paid by Regeneron towards development costs and the reimbursement of commercialization-related 
expenses incurred by Regeneron. In the fourth quarter and full-year 2023, this line also included €149 
million and €651 million of capital gains related to portfolio streamlining, respectively, compared to €227 
million and €615 million in the same periods of 2022. In the fourth quarter, this line also included 
litigation-related reserves. Sanofi expects the amount of capital gains from portfolio streamlining to 
exceed €500 million in 2024. 
Fourth-quarter and full-year 2023 share of profit from associates was €47 million and €122 million, 
respectively, compared to €6 million and €88 million in the same periods of 2022 and included the share 
of U.S. profit related to Vaxelis. 
Fourth-quarter business operating income5 (BOI) decreased 5.2% to €2,583 million. At CER, BOI 
increased 5.3%. The ratio of BOI to net sales decreased 1.7 ppts to 23.7% (and down 0.9 ppts at CER). 
In 2023, business operating income was €12,670 million, down 2.8% (up 4.3% at CER). In 2023, the 
ratio of business operating income to net sales decreased 0.9 percentage points to 29.4% (30.1% at 
CER).
Net financial expenses were €49 million and €181 million in the fourth quarter and full-year 2023, 
respectively, compared to €28 million and €234 million in the same periods of 2022. 
Fourth-quarter 2023 effective tax rate decreased to 18.1% from 20.6% in the fourth quarter of 2022 
which led the full-year 2023 effective tax rate of 18.8% compared to 19.3% in 2022. Sanofi expects its 
effective tax rate to be around 21% in 2024.
Fourth-quarter business net income5 decreased 2.7% to €2,083 million and increased 8.2% at CER. 
The ratio of business net income to net sales decreased 0.9 ppts to 19.1% compared to the fourth quarter

Forward-Looking Statements
This press release contains forward-looking statements as defined in the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995, as amended. Forward-looking 
statements are statements that are not historical facts. These statements include projections and estimates and their underlying assumptions, 
statements regarding plans, business transformations, objectives, intentions and expectations with respect to future financial results, events, 
operations, services, product development and potential, and statements regarding future performance. Forward-looking statements are generally 
identified by the words “expects”, “anticipates”, “believes”, “intends”, “estimates”, “plans”, “potential”, “outlook”, “guidance” and similar expressions. 
Although Sanofi’s management believes that the expectations reflected in such forward-looking statements are reasonable, investors are cautioned that 
forward-looking information and statements are subject to various risks and uncertainties, many of which are difficult to predict and generally beyond 
the control of Sanofi, that could cause actual results and developments to differ materially from those expressed in, or implied or projected by, the 
forward-looking information and statements. These risks and uncertainties include among other things, the uncertainties inherent in research and 
development, future clinical data and analysis, including post marketing, decisions by regulatory authorities, such as the FDA or the EMA, regarding 
whether and when to approve any drug, device or biological application that may be filed for any such product candidates as well as their decisions 
regarding labelling and other matters that could affect the availability or commercial potential of such product candidates, the fact that product 
candidates if approved may not be commercially successful, the future approval and commercial success of therapeutic alternatives, Sanofi’s ability to 
benefit from external growth opportunities, to complete capital markets or other transactions and/or obtain regulatory clearances, risks associated with 
developing standalone businesses, risks associated with intellectual property and any related pending or future litigation and the ultimate outcome of 
such litigation,  trends in exchange rates and prevailing interest rates, volatile economic and capital market conditions, cost containment initiatives and 
subsequent changes thereto, and the impact that pandemics, political disruption or armed conflicts or other global crises may have on us, our 
customers, suppliers, vendors, and other business partners, and the financial condition of any one of them, as well as on our employees and on the 
global economy as a whole. The risks and uncertainties also include the uncertainties discussed or identified in the public filings with the SEC and the 
AMF made by Sanofi, including those listed under “Risk Factors” and “Cautionary Statement Regarding Forward-Looking Statements” in Sanofi’s annual 
report on Form 20-F for the year ended December 31, 2022. Other than as required by applicable law, Sanofi does not undertake any obligation to 
update or revise any forward-looking information or statements.

Appendix 9: Definitions of non-IFRS financial indicators
Company sales at constant exchange rates (CER)
When we refer to changes in our net sales “at constant exchange rates” (CER), this means that we exclude the effect of 
changes in exchange rates.
We eliminate the effect of exchange rates by recalculating net sales for the relevant period at the exchange rates used for 
the previous period.

Business net income
Sanofi publishes a key non-IFRS indicator. Business net income is defined as net income attributable to 
equity holders of Sanofi excluding:
•
amortization of intangible assets,
•
impairment of intangible assets, 
•
fair value remeasurement of contingent consideration related to business combinations or to 
disposals,
•
expenses arising from the impact of acquisitions on inventories
•
restructuring costs and similar items(1),
•
other gains and losses (including gains and losses on disposals of non-current assets(1)),
•
costs or provisions associated with litigation(1),
•
upfront payments and regulatory milestone payments recognized in the line item Other operating 
income and arising from transactions outside the scope of Sanofi's ordinary activities,
•
financial (income)/expense related to liabilities carried at amortized cost other than net 
indebtedness, 
•
tax effects related to the items listed above as well as effects of major tax disputes,
•
the share of profits/losses from investments accounted for using the equity method, except for 
joint ventures and associates with which Sanofi has a strategic alliance,
•
net income attributable to non-controlling interests related to the items listed above.
(1) Reported in the line items Restructuring costs and similar items and Gains and losses on disposals, and litigation, which are defined in 
Notes B.16. and B.17. to our consolidated financial statements.
Free cash flow 
Free cash flow is a non-IFRS financial indicator which is reviewed by our management, and which we 
believe provides useful information to measure the net cash generated from the Company’s operations 
that is available for strategic investments1 (net of divestments1), for debt repayment, and for capital 
return to shareholders. Free Cash Flow is determined from the Business Net Income adjusted for 
depreciation, amortization and impairment, share of profit/loss in associates and joint ventures net of 
dividends received, gains & losses on disposals, net change in provisions including pensions and other 
post-employment benefits, deferred taxes, share-based expense and other non-cash items. It comprises 
net changes in working capital, capital expenditures and other asset acquisitions2 net of disposal 
proceeds2, and payments related to restructuring and similar items. Free cash flow is not defined by IFRS 
and it is not a substitute measure for the IFRS aggregate net cash flows in operating activities.
1 Amount of the transaction above a cap of €500 million per transaction (inclusive of all payments related to the transaction).
2 Not exceeding a cap of €500 million per transaction (inclusive of all payments related to the transaction).
                                                                                                                                           23

• Vaccines sales -4.8% due to COVID-19 sales in 2023
• Opella (former Sanofi Consumer Healthcare) up 9.6%, driven by the Qunol acquisition
• Research and Development expenses grew 5.5%
• Selling, general and administrative expenses grew 4.9%, substantially less than sales growth
• Business EPS(1) of €1.73, down 0.6% reported and up 4.0% at CER
• IFRS EPS of €0.89, down 22.6% reported
Q2 pipeline progress

2024 business EPS guidance upgraded
• 2024 business EPS(1) to be stable at CER(2), an upgrade from a low single-digit percentage decrease

the average July 2024 exchange rates, the currency impact on 2024 business EPS is c.-5.5% to 
-6.5%.
Paul Hudson, Chief Executive Officer, commented:
“We are continuing our strong performance in 2024 and delivered broad-based, double-digit sales growth 
in the second quarter. We also made important progress in our pipeline of new medicines, including 
approvals for Dupixent in COPD, Kevzara in pediatric arthritis and ALTUVIIIO (EU) in hemophilia A. With 
the EU approval in COPD, Dupixent is the first-ever biologic medicine approved in this debilitating disease 
impacting hundreds of thousands of patients globally. As we accelerate our focused mid- and late-stage 
pipeline, we started a number of new phase 2 and phase 3 studies that will benefit patients in the future. 
We are well on track, delivering on our strategic priorities for Sanofi to become a development-driven, 
tech-powered biopharma company committed to serving patients and accelerating growth. Underpinned 
by accelerated delivery of Sanofi’s transformation, we upgrade our earnings per share guidance for 2024.”

Business operating income
In Q2 2024, business operating income (BOI) was €2,813 million and increased by 3.2%. At CER, BOI 
increased by 8.3%. The ratio of BOI to net sales decreased by 1.2pp to 26.2% (down by 0.5pp to 26.9% 
at CER). This development was mainly caused by lower other revenues as well as higher other operating 
expenses. In H1 2024, BOI was €5,656 million and decreased by 6.7%. At CER, BOI increased by 1.4%. 
The ratio of BOI to net sales decreased by 3.3pp to 26.7% (down by 1.9pp to 28.1% at CER).
Acquisitions and major collaborations
In May, Sanofi, Formation Bio and OpenAI announced a collaboration to accelerate AI-powered drug 
development and bring new medicines to patients more efficiently. The three teams will bring together 
data, software and tuned models to develop custom, purpose-built solutions across the drug development 
lifecycle. This represents a first collaboration of its kind within the pharma and life sciences industries. 
Sanofi will leverage this partnership to provide access to proprietary data to develop AI models as it 
continues on its path to becoming the first biopharma company powered by AI at scale.
Also in May, Sanofi and Novavax announced a co-exclusive licensing agreement to co-commercialize 
Novavax’s current stand-alone adjuvanted COVID-19 vaccine worldwide (except in countries with existing 
advance purchase agreements and in India, Japan, and South Korea where Novavax has existing 
partnership agreements). The licensing agreement also includes a sole license to Novavax’s adjuvanted 
COVID-19 vaccine for use in combination with Sanofi’s flu vaccines and a non-exclusive license to use the 
Matrix-M adjuvant in vaccine products. In addition, Sanofi took a minority equity investment in Novavax.

The commentary below emphasizes the recent quarterly performance unless stated otherwise.
US sales were €4,751 million and increased by 19.8%. Solid performance by Dupixent and Pharma 
launches was supported by a return to growth of Lantus and Toujeo. Negative sales impacts included 
Aubagio due to generic competition, Eloctate, and vaccines.

1 See Appendix 9 for definitions of financial indicators.


Europe sales were €2,402 million and decreased by 2.2%. Strong performance by Dupixent and Pharma 
launches was more than offset by lower sales of several medicines, including Aubagio due to generic 
competition, Lantus, Lovenox, and Myozyme and the absence of COVID-19 vaccine sales in 2024.
Rest of World sales were €3,592 million and increased by 8.3%. Very strong performance by Dupixent 
and Pharma launches and growth by Toujeo were slightly offset by lower sales of legacy medicines and 
vaccines. China sales were €765 million and decreased by 0.5%, mainly caused by Lantus, Lovenox, and 
Other medicines. With higher inflation, the contribution of Argentina to the total Sanofi sales growth rate 
was 1.3pp.
Biopharma
The Biopharma segment includes Pharma and Vaccines. In Q2 2024, sales were €9,439 million and 
increased by 10.3%, driven by continued strong performance of Dupixent and Pharma launches. The 
divestments of medicines/portfolio streamlining had a negative impact of 0.6pp. In H1 2024, sales were 
€18,378 million and increased by 8.3% driven by the same aforementioned factors.

Nexviazyme/Nexviadyme (Pompe disease) sales were €168 million and increased by 66.0%. Growth 
was high in Europe (112.0%) and in the Rest of World (172.7%) with slower growth in the US (31.3%) 
where a higher conversion rate from Myozyme/Lumizyme has been achieved in the eligible late-onset 
Pompe disease population. The Pompe franchise (Nexviazyme/Nexviadyme + Myozyme/Lumizyme) sales 
were €348 million and increased by 14.1%. Nexviazyme/Nexviadyme sales were 48% of the Pompe 
franchise.
ALTUVIIIO (hemophilia A) sales were €158 million, predominantly in the US where ALTUVIIIO growth 
was driven by patient switches of which an increasing majority came from medicines other than Eloctate. 
Sales also benefited from supply to the partner in Europe where the medicine obtained regulatory 
approval. The hemophilia A franchise (ALTUVIIIO + Eloctate) sales were €263 million and increased by 
77.7%. Franchise growth improved Sanofi’s market share in the factor as well as the overall hemophilia A 
market.
Sarclisa (multiple myeloma) sales were €121 million and increased by 36.2%, driven by strong growth in 
the US and the Rest of World, specifically Japan.

Rezurock (chronic graft-versus-host disease) sales were €114 million and increased by 52.7%, driven by 
improved patient adherence and new patients, primarily in the US and new launches in China and the UK.
Cablivi (acquired thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura) sales were €54 million, mainly in the US and in 
Europe, and decreased by 1.8% primarily due to a lower number of patients being diagnosed.
Xenpozyme (acid sphingomyelinase deficiency) sales were €37 million and increased by 85.0%, driven 
by more patients in the US and Europe.
Enjaymo (cold agglutinin disease) sales were €26 million and increased by 58.8%, mainly from the US 
and Japan.
Tzield (delay onset of type 1 diabetes) sales were €11 million, a sequential increase from Q1 2024 of 
c.10%. Growth was driven by a higher number of infusions supported by increased awareness and 
screening. Efforts to increase knowledge and updates to disease guidelines are expected to support long-
term growth.

Lantus sales were €398 million and increased by 21.0%. In the US, sales increased by 225.0% to €158 
million, reflecting a low base of comparison due to net-price adjustments in the comparable period as well 
as an increase in volume due to the unavailability of a competitor medicine. In China, sales continued to 
decrease due to patients shifting to Toujeo.
Toujeo sales were €313 million and increased by 11.0%, mainly driven by Europe and China. In Europe, 
Toujeo has a leading market share of basal insulin while in China, Toujeo recently surpassed the market 
share of Lantus. In the US, sales benefited from the unavailability of a competitor medicine.
Fabrazyme sales were €273 million and increased by 12.4%, driven by growth in the Rest of World 
where penetration rates are lower.
Lovenox sales were €256 million and decreased by 4.6%, reflecting the impact from volume-based 
procurement in China as well as biosimilar competition in the EU.
Plavix sales were €235 million and increased by 2.1%, underpinned by use in Rest of World.
Cerezyme sales were €193 million and increased by 19.3%, driven by growth in the Rest of World, 
including growth in patients. The Gaucher disease franchise (Cerezyme + Cerdelga) sales were €275

Myozyme/Lumizyme sales were €180 million and decreased by 11.5%, reflecting the conversion to 
Nexviazyme/Nexviadyme.
Alprolix sales were €141 million and increased by 3.7%, driven by the US, partly offset by Rest of World.
Thymoglobulin sales were €129 million and decreased by 0.7%, reflecting lower sales in China.
Praluent sales were €126 million and increased by 38.5%, underpinned by Europe the Rest of World.
Aubagio sales were €107 million and decreased by 49.5%, reflecting the loss of exclusivity starting in the 
US in March 2023 followed by Europe in September 2023. The negative global impact from generic 
competitors is anticipated to reduce during 2024 as the losses of exclusivity annualize.

Vaccines sales were €1,142 million and decreased by 4.8% impacted by the absence of COVID-19 sales 
in the quarter compared to €59 million in Q2 2023. In H1 2024, sales were broadly stable (+0.3%), 
driven by Beyfortus, offset by no COVID-19 sales compared to €226 million in H1 2023. Excluding the 
impact from the absence of COVID-19 sales, growth would have been 0.0% and 10.7% respectively.
Polio/Pertussis/Hib (PPH) vaccines sales, including Boosters, were €712 million and decreased by 
5.1% driven by unfavorable phasing in the Rest of World and the US, where Vaxelis became market 
leader in the three-dose primary series market. Vaxelis’ in-market sales are not consolidated by Sanofi 
but profits are shared equally between Sanofi and Merck & Co.
Meningitis, Travel and endemic vaccines sales were €296 million and increased by 0.3% reflecting 
higher travel vaccines sales in Europe offset by lower meningitis sales in the US.
Beyfortus sales were limited to €18 million, reflecting the global vaccine seasonality towards the second 
half-year. In collaboration with AstraZeneca, responsible for Beyfortus manufacturing, the regulatory 
applications for two additional filling lines have been submitted to health authorities to expand supply for 
the Northern Hemisphere 2024/2025 season. This is anticipated to augment capacity compared to the one 
line currently licensed.
Influenza vaccines sales reached €115 million, benefiting from higher public sales in Latin America.
Biopharma business operating income
Biopharma BOI was €2,566 million and increased by 5.6%. At CER, BOI increased by 10.2% reflecting 
lower other revenues and higher other operating expenses, but more than offset by a higher gross profit 
and slower growth in Research and Development (R&D) and Selling, general and administrative expenses 
(SG&A) expenses. The ratio of BOI to net sales decreased by 0.6pp to 27.2% (stable at 27.8% at CER). 
In H1 2024, BOI was €4,931 million and decreased by 5.5% (up by 1.7% at CER). The ratio of BOI to net 
sales decreased by 3.1pp to 26.8% (down by 1.8pp to 28.1% at CER).

Immunology
Dupixent (dupilumab)
•
The European Commission approved Dupixent in the European Union (EU) as an add-on 
maintenance treatment for adults with uncontrolled chronic obstructive pulmonary disease 
(COPD) characterized by raised blood eosinophils. Specifically, the approval covers patients 
already on a combination of an inhaled corticosteroid (ICS), a long-acting beta2-agonist (LABA) 
and a long-acting muscarinic antagonist (LAMA), or on a combination of a LABA and a LAMA if ICS 
is not appropriate. Dupixent is the first biologic medicine approved for COPD and the EU is the first 
jurisdiction in the world to approve it. Other reviews are underway, including in Japan and China.
•
The US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has extended by three months the prescription drug 
user fee act (PDUFA) date of its priority review of the supplemental biologics license application 
(sBLA) for Dupixent as an add-on maintenance treatment in certain adult patients with 
uncontrolled COPD. The revised PDUFA date is September 27, 2024. The FDA did not raise any 
concerns regarding the approvability of Dupixent for this indication.
•
The FDA accepted for priority review the sBLA for Dupixent as an add-on maintenance treatment 
for adolescents aged 12 to 17 years with inadequately controlled chronic rhinosinusitis with 
nasal polyposis (CRSwNP). The PDUFA date is September 15, 2024.
•
The European Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use accepted for review the regulatory 
submission for Dupixent in chronic spontaneous urticaria (CSU) in people aged 12 years and 
older whose disease is not adequately controlled with existing therapy, based on the results from 
the LIBERTY-CSU CUPID Study A and Study B (pivotal).
•
The New England Journal of Medicine published results from a positive phase 3 study of Dupixent 
in children aged one to 11 years with eosinophilic esophagitis (EoE). Data from the study were 
the basis for the FDA priority review and approval in the US earlier this year, as well as for the 
regulatory submission currently under review in EU for this age group.
Kevzara (sarilumab)
The FDA approved Kevzara for the treatment of patients weighing 63 kg or greater with active 
polyarticular juvenile idiopathic arthritis (pJIA), a form of arthritis that impacts multiple joints at a 
time. The approval in this patient population is supported by evidence from adequate and well-controlled 
studies and pharmacokinetic data from adults with rheumatoid arthritis as well as a pharmacokinetic, 
pharmacodynamic, dose finding and safety study in pediatric patients with pJIA.
amlitelimab (OX40L mAb)
•
The phase 2 study assessing efficacy and safety of subcutaneous injections of amlitelimab in 
patients aged 18 years and older with severe alopecia areata enrolled the first patients (clinical 
study identifier: NCT06444451).
•
The CONQUEST phase 2 study assessing efficacy and safety of subcutaneous injections of 
amlitelimab in patients aged 18 years and older with systemic sclerosis enrolled the first 
patients (clinical study identifier: NCT06195072).
6


rilzabrutinib (BTK inhibitor)
Encouraging results from a phase 2 study showed that treatment with oral rilzabrutinib at both high dose 
and low doses led to a numerical reduction in loss of asthma control events (the primary endpoint) and 
improvements in symptoms in adult patients with uncontrolled moderate-to-severe asthma. These 
results were presented at the American Thoracic Society 2024 International Conference, San Diego, US.
duvakitug (TL1A mAb)
The enrollment of the RELIEVE UCCD phase 2 study in ulcerative colitis or Crohn’s disease was 
accelerated with a top-line analysis now anticipated in H2 2024 (clinical study identifier: NCT05499130).
Rare diseases
ALTUVIIIO (efanesoctocog alfa)
•
The European Commission granted marketing authorization for Altuvoct (ALTUVIIIO in the EU) for 
the treatment and prevention of bleeds and perioperative prophylaxis in hemophilia A to Sanofi’s 
partner in the EU, Sobi. The EU also endorsed the retention of orphan designation, granting a ten-
year market exclusivity period.
•
The FDA updated the label for ALTUVIIIO to include full results from the XTEND-Kids phase 3 study 
showing that once-weekly dosing with ALTUVIIIO delivers highly effective bleed protection in 
children with hemophilia A. ALTUVIIIO was first approved in February 2023 for adults and 
children with hemophilia A for routine prophylaxis and on-demand treatment to control bleeding 
episodes as well as for perioperative management (surgery), and this label update builds on the 
interim XTEND-Kids data from 2023 to include full results.
fitusiran (RNAi targeting anti-thrombin)
Regulatory submissions for fitusiran for the treatment of hemophilia A or B in adults and adolescents 
with or without inhibitors have been completed in China, Brazil, and the US with a PDUFA date of March 
28, 2025. The FDA granted fitusiran breakthrough therapy designation for hemophilia B with inhibitors in 
December 2023.
New data were presented at the International Society on Thrombosis and Haemostasis congress in 
Bangkok, Thailand, and included information on surgical experience as well as long-term safety from the 
ATLAS phase 3 development program in adults and adolescents with hemophilia A or B, regardless of 
inhibitor status.
losmapimod (p38α/β MAPK inhibitor)
In May, Sanofi and Fulcrum Therapeutics entered into a license agreement for exclusive 
commercialization rights for losmapimod outside the US. Losmapimod is a selective p38α/β mitogen-
activated protein kinase (MAPK) small-molecule inhibitor in phase 3 for the treatment of 
facioscapulohumeral muscular dystrophy (FSHD). FSHD is a chronic and progressive genetic 
muscular disorder that is characterized by significant muscle cell death and fat infiltration into muscle 
tissue. Fulcrum expects top-line data from the REACH phase 3 study during H2 2024 followed by 
regulatory submissions (clinical study identifier: NCT05397470). Losmapimod has orphan drug 
designation in US, orphan designation in the EU, FDA fast track designation and FSHD is included on the 
list of rare diseases in China.
SAR447537 (AAT fusion protein)
In May, the acquisition of Inhibrx, Inc. closed and added SAR447537 (formerly INBRX-101) to Sanofi’s 
rare disease phase 2 pipeline (ELEVAATE, clinical study identifier: NCT05856331). SAR447537 is a human 
recombinant protein that holds the promise of allowing alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency (AATD) patients 
to achieve normalization of serum AAT levels with less frequent (monthly vs. weekly) dosing. AATD is an 
inherited rare disease characterized by low levels of AAT protein, predominantly affecting the lung with 
progressive deterioration of the tissue. SAR447537 may help to reduce inflammation and prevent further 
deterioration of lung function in affected individuals.
riliprubart (C1s inhibitor)
The development of riliprubart in cold agglutinin disease, a rare autoimmune disorder characterized by 
the premature destruction of red blood cells (hemolysis), will not advance to phase 3 due to prioritization 
of other projects. As of now, the data confirmed pharmacological activity and a well-tolerated safety 
profile as in other indications.
SAR442501 (FGFR3 Ab)
The upreACH phase 2 study of SAR442501 in pediatric patients with achondroplasia will remain ongoing 
but is not expected to advance further.

Neurology
frexalimab (CD40L mAb)
New phase 2 data showed significant reduction in plasma levels of neurofilament light chain (Nfl) after 
one year of treatment. Nfl is a biomarker of nerve cell damage that is typically elevated in people living 
with multiple sclerosis (MS). These data were presented at the 10th Congress of the European 
Academy of Neurology in Helsinki, Finland.
riliprubart (C1s inhibitor)
New phase 2 data from an ongoing study showed encouraging efficacy and safety for patients with 
chronic inflammatory demyelinating polyneuropathy (CIDP). In part A results at 24 weeks, 
riliprubart showed promising disease-controlling benefits, with the majority of study patients improving or 
remaining stable, including those who experienced failure or inadequate response to standard-of-care 
treatment (SOC-refractory), and those having residual disability despite treatment with SOC (IVIg-
treated). In part B, after approximately one year of treatment, riliprubart continued to show promising 
disease-controlling benefits across all enrolled cohorts. Additional results indicated that riliprubart may 
improve patient-reported fatigue and quality-of-life measurements as well as biomarkers associated with 
CIDP disease progression. These data were presented at the 2024 Peripheral Nerve Society Annual 
Meeting in Montreal, Canada.
Supported by the phase 2 data, two phase 3 studies, evaluating riliprubart in SOC-refractory CIDP 
(MOBILIZE, clinical study identifier: NCT06290128) and IVIg-treated CIDP (VITALIZE, clinical study 
identifier: NCT06290141) are currently recruiting patients.
Oncology
Sarclisa (isatuximab)
The FDA accepted for priority review the sBLA for Sarclisa in combination with bortezomib, lenalidomide 
and dexamethasone (VRd) for the treatment of patients with newly diagnosed (front-line, 1L) multiple 
myeloma (MM) who are transplant-ineligible (TI). If approved, Sarclisa would be the first anti-CD38 
medicine in combination with standard-of-care VRd in newly diagnosed patients ineligible for transplant, 
which would be the third indication in MM. The PDUFA date is September 27, 2024. Other regulatory 
submissions are currently under review in the EU, Japan, and China.
The potential new indication is supported by data presented at the American Society of Clinical Oncology 
2024 Annual Meeting in Chicago, US. The IMROZ phase 3 study demonstrated that Sarclisa in 
combination with VRd followed by Sarclisa-Rd significantly reduced the risk of disease progression or 
death by 40%, compared to VRd followed by Rd.
SAR443579 (trifunctional CD123 NK cell engager)
The first patient enrolled in the dose-expansion part of a phase 2 study of SAR443579 as a monotherapy 
for the treatment of blood cancers with high unmet needs, including relapsed or refractory acute 
myeloid leukemia (AML), B-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia and high-risk myelodysplasia (clinical

Opella sales were €1,306 million and increased by 9.6% with organic sales growth of 2.4%. Growth was 
enhanced by the acquisition of Qunol (c.7%) and industrial sales transferred from Biopharma in January 
2024 (c.2%) but tempered by divestments (c.2%) and Q1 phasing. In North America, growth benefited 
from Qunol and some Focus brands, such as Dulcolax while sales in Europe were lower due to a weak flu 
season and a high comparison for the key brand Doliprane. In H1 2024, sales increased by 9.2%, driven 
by Qunol (c.6%) and industrial sales (c.2%) and offset by divestments (c.2%). As a result, organic 
growth was 3.8%.
Opella business operating income
Opella BOI was €267 million and decreased by 15.5% mainly driven by increased SG&A in anticipation of 
the communicated Opella separation and a lower gross margin reflecting a greater Vitamins, Minerals and 
Supplements sales contribution following the Qunol integration and adverse mix. Furthermore, there were 
lower divestment gains relative to last year, which benefited from the significant portfolio transformation. 
At CER, BOI decreased by 9.8%. The ratio of BOI to net sales decreased by 5.4pp to 20.4% (down by 
4.6pp to 21.2% at CER). In H1 2024, BOI was €739 million and decreased by 13.1%. At CER, BOI 
decreased by 1.8%. The ratio of BOI to net sales decreased by 5.2pp to 26.1% (down by 3.2pp to 28.1% 
at CER).
In connection with the intent to separate Opella at the earliest in Q4 2024 announced on October 27, 
2023, Opella has prepared audited combined financial statements in accordance with IFRS. Please see 
Appendix 11 for more.

Sanofi’s Planet care strategy: concrete actions towards net zero emissions
For several years, Sanofi has been implementing its Planet care strategy, aiming for net zero greenhouse 
gas emissions across all scopes by 2045, with an intermediate carbon neutrality milestone in 2030. The 
company has already achieved a 43% decrease in scopes 1 and 2 emissions, targeting 55% by 2030, and 
a 10% reduction in scope 3 emissions, aiming for 30% by 2030.
For scopes 1 and 2, Sanofi is focusing on the following key decarbonization levers to reach its 2030 
targets:
•
Energy decarbonization: increasing renewable electricity share from 11% in 2019 to 85% in Q2 
2024 through solar panels, power purchase agreements (PPA), and guarantees of origin. In 
France, three PPAs have been signed with the Compagnie Nationale du Rhône, for a volume of 83 
GWh/year over a twenty-year period, covering 19% of Sanofi’s annual electricity needs in France. 
Sanofi also has a renewable electricity PPA in Mexico to supply energy to its three Mexican sites 
and is exploring PPA opportunities in other European countries and the US. Sanofi is also 
incorporating biomethane and biomass to reduce reliance on fossil fuels.
•
Energy reduction and efficiency: aiming to reduce energy consumption by 15% in existing facilities 
by 2025 compared to 2021.
•
Eco-fleet: converting Sanofi’s car fleet to an 80% eco-fleet (biofuel, hybrid and electric vehicles) 
by 2030.
•
Refrigerant gas: replacing existing refrigerant gases with lower global warming potential 
alternatives and improving leak prevention.
For scope 3, the majority of greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions come from raw materials and 
subcontracting, thus representing the primary target for the decarbonization efforts. Sanofi's eco-design 
program aims to integrate environmental criteria from product design. The company is seeking less 
carbon-intensive suppliers and considering the country of manufacture in supplier selection. For example, 
sourcing of a highly carbon-intensive raw material from China has been reduced from over 50% of the 
volume in 2019 to just 5% in 2024, with a shift to European suppliers. Additionally, Sanofi is 
implementing comprehensive measures to reduce emissions across multiple areas: addressing business 
travel and employee commuting through remote work and low-carbon travel options, shifting from air to 
sea freight for product transport, setting ambitious waste management goals, and focusing on energy 
use. 
Community-centric carbon offsetting
By 2045, the residual emissions will remain under 10% of the 2019 total emissions, in line with the 
Science Based Targets Initiative net zero commitment. Understanding that not all emissions can be 
immediately abated, Sanofi also created a community-focused carbon offsetting program. These 
initiatives not only compensate for residual emissions but also generate substantial environmental, social, 
and economic benefits in local communities.
Sanofi's carbon offsetting program has invested around €60 million in four strategic projects since 2019. 
These include the Sundari Mangrove Restoration project in India, which has restored 380 hectares of 
mangroves since 2022 with plans to rehabilitate an additional 3,750 hectares. In Kenya, 18,250 energy-
saving biomass cookstoves have been distributed. A new project in Mozambique aims to rehabilitate 
1,040 water handpumps, reducing the need to burn biomass for boiling water and providing clean water 
access to 312,000 people.
Business resilience to environmental changes
Sanofi is also actively working to strengthen its business resilience to environmental challenges which 
could impact its ability to support patients across the world. For instance, Sanofi has undertaken an end-
to-end internal study, in order to better identify the associations between environmental change impacts 
with its portfolio and pipeline of products. 
Among its conclusions, the study reported that 70% of Sanofi’s portfolio indications and 78% of the R&D 
pipeline indications are already targeting diseases impacted by at least one environmental hazard (air 
pollution, shift in seasonal patterns, chemical pollution, extreme temperatures, water pollution).
ESG ratings
Sanofi has been ranked among the world’s most sustainable companies of 2024 by TIME Magazine, 
ranking 7th overall and 1st in the pharma industry. This ranking is based on the recognition of the 
12


comprehensive ESG disclosures, the ambitious commitments, alignment with key international standards 
and initiatives and the performance across a large selection of ESG ratings.

Company sales at constant exchange rates (CER)
References to changes in net sales “at constant exchange rates” (CER) means that it excludes the effect 
of changes in exchange rates.
The effect of exchange rates are eliminated by recalculating net sales for the relevant period at the 
exchange rates used for the previous period.

Business net income
Sanofi publishes a key non-IFRS indicator. Business net income is defined as net income attributable to 
equity holders of Sanofi excluding:
•
amortization of intangible assets,
•
impairment of intangible assets, 
•
fair value remeasurement of contingent consideration related to business combinations or to 
disposals,
•
expenses arising from the impact of acquisitions on inventories
•
restructuring costs and similar items(1),
•
other gains and losses (including gains and losses on disposals of non-current assets(1)),
•
costs or provisions associated with litigation(1),
•
financial (income)/expense related to liabilities carried at amortized cost other than net 
indebtedness, 
•
tax effects related to the items listed above as well as effects of major tax disputes,
•
the share of profits/losses from investments accounted for using the equity method, except for 
joint ventures and associates with which Sanofi has a strategic alliance,
•
net income attributable to non-controlling interests related to the items listed above.
(1) Reported in the line items Restructuring costs and similar items and Gains and losses on disposals, and litigation, which are defined in 
Notes B.16. and B.17. to our consolidated financial statements.
Free cash flow 
Free cash flow is a non-IFRS financial indicator which is reviewed by management, and which 
management believes provides useful information to measure the net cash generated from Sanofi’s 
operations that is available for strategic investments1 (net of divestments1), for debt repayment, and for 
capital return to shareholders. Free cash flow is determined from the Business net income adjusted for 
depreciation, amortization and impairment, share of profit/loss in associates and joint ventures net of 
dividends received, gains and losses on disposals, net change in provisions including pensions and other 
post-employment benefits, deferred taxes, share-based expense and other non-cash items. It comprises 
net changes in working capital, capital expenditures and other asset acquisitions2 net of disposal 
proceeds2, and payments related to restructuring and similar items. Free cash flow is not defined by IFRS 
and it is not a substitute measure for the IFRS aggregate net cash flows in operating activities.
1 Amount of the transaction above a cap of €500 million per transaction (inclusive of all payments related to the transaction).
2 Not exceeding a cap of €500 million per transaction (inclusive of all payments related to the transaction).

Appendix 11:
Three-year historical and restated 
financial information of Opella
In connection with the intent to separate Opella (formerly Sanofi Consumer Healthcare) at the earliest in Q4 2024 announced on 
October 27, 2023, Opella (i) has prepared audited* combined financial statements in accordance with IFRS and (ii) presents 
restated alternative performance measures for 2021, 2022 and 2023, as set forth in Appendix 11, to reflect Opella's financial 
performance as if it had operated independently.
Because the combined historical financial statements do not reflect the target operating structure of the Group once separated 
from Sanofi, restated alternative performance measures have been prepared for 2021, 2022 and 2023, to account for the 
contractual agreements signed with Sanofi and for Opella’s targeted operating model (e.g., standalone cost base).

(a) This line item mainly comprises current account balances in respect of the combined group’s net cash positions in credit with Sanofi, which acts as the 
cash pooling entity under the terms of the centralized cash pooling agreement contracted with subsidiaries of the combined group (notes D.11. and 
D.27.).
(b) This amount comprises cash held by the dedicated entities of the combined group. Payments made by non-dedicated entities within the scope of the 
combined group before the Pre-Separation Carve-Out Transactions (note E) in settlement of transactions entered into by Opella activities are 
reflected in the net assets of the combined group as net contributions of Sanofi equity holders to the combined group (note A.2.4.).

(a) The combined entity was not constituted on the basis of a separate legal scope as of the ends of the reporting periods for which the combined 
financial statements are presented. Consequently, the total presented for combined equity represents the aggregate amount of equity as derived from 
Opella activities carried on within the scope of combination by Sanofi group dedicated and non-dedicated legal entities under common control, 
including the net contribution of Sanofi equity holders to the combined group (note A.2.4.).
(b) This line item mainly comprises current account balances in respect of the combined group’s net cash positions in debit with Sanofi, which acts as the 
cash pooling entity under the terms of the centralized cash pooling agreement contracted with subsidiaries of the combined group (note D.16.1.).

(a) This line item comprises revenue generated (i) from manufacturing services agreements under which Opella manufactures pharmaceutical products on 
behalf of Sanofi as customer and (ii) further to divestments of products historically owned by Opella, the rights for which have been transferred to third 
parties (notes A.2.3., B.15.2. and D.27.).
(b) Because the Opella group was not legally constituted during the three twelve-month periods ended December 31, 2023, 2022 and 2021, the number of 
shares outstanding cannot be determined. Consequently, no earnings per share figure is presented in the combined financial statements for any of the 
three periods presented.

(a) This line item corresponds to compensation plans based on shares of the Sanofi group awarded to employees of the combined group who were 
employed by the Sanofi group as of the date of preparation of the combined financial statements.
(b) The contribution of Sanofi equity holders to the combined group as recorded in combined equity (notes A.2.4. and D.14.) represents the corresponding 
entries arising from (i) related party transactions (note D.27.) pre-dating the Pre-Separation Carve-Out Transactions (note E.) and (ii) the recognition of 
tax loss carry-forwards generated by dedicated entities within the combined group that belong to a group tax election, including tax losses transferred 
to the lead company in the tax group (€49 million for the period) and by non-dedicated entities. In addition, the net assets of non-dedicated entities 
were deemed to have been distributed in cases where the Pre-Separation Carve-Out Transactions involved a change in operating model such that the 
distribution of Opella products in 16 countries is handled through a third-party intermediary (€9 million for the period).

B. Notes to the combined financial statements2
Introduction
As announced on 27 October 2023, Sanofi intends to proceed with the introduction of its Consumer Healthcare business (a 
separate operating segment of the Sanofi group) on the Euronext Paris regulated market (the “Transaction”). 
The creation of a standalone Consumer Healthcare business unit, bringing together all Opella activities carried on by the Sanofi 
group, was effected through successive waves of pre-separation legal reorganizations which began in the second half of 2021 
and had been completed in most countries as of the date of preparation of the combined financial statements for the year 
ended December 31, 2023. The only exceptions are (i) India, where the legal transfer will take place in the second half of 2024; (ii) 
hospital sales of Opella products in China, for which the transfer of the market authorizations from Sanofi to Opella will be 
finalized no later than 2028 after a transitional period required to complete the transfer plan agreed with Sanofi in the context of 
public tendering arrangements (note E.); and (iii) Brazil, where the transfer of manufacturing activities took place on July 1, 2024, 
thereby finalizing the Pre-Separation Carve-Out Transactions.
Historically housed within over 150 dedicated and non-dedicated Sanofi group entities, the combined group now comprises 
around 70 legal entities dedicated to the research, development, manufacture, promotion, distribution and commercialization of 
consumer healthcare products. With a presence in 45 countries, the combined group offers consumers (directly, or via local 
commercial partners) global coverage in the supply of such products; those products are manufactured mainly in France, the 
United States, Japan, Brazil and Hungary, and fall within three categories: "Seasonal Symptoms & Pain", "Wellness", and "Other".
The following sections describe the basis of preparation and accounting conventions (note A.2.) used to establish the combined 
financial statements of Opella, prepared in anticipation of the Transaction and presenting historical information of the combined 
group for the three 12-month accounting periods ended December 31, 2023, 2022 and 2021.
A/ Basis of preparation of the combined financial statements
A.1. General information
The combined financial statements may not be indicative of the future performances of the combined group, and do not 
necessarily reflect what the comprehensive income, financial position or cash flows of the group would have been if the 
combined group had operated as a standalone group presenting separate financial statements from those of Sanofi during all of 
the periods presented.
The combined financial statements, which were prepared on a going concern basis and in accordance with the historical cost 
convention, were signed off by the Chairwoman of Opella Healthcare France SAS on July 4, 2024.
The combined financial statements are presented in millions of euros unless otherwise indicated.
Scope of combination
The scope of combination reflects the activities of Opella, which constitutes a separate operating segment of the Sanofi group. 
It represents the ring-fenced grouping of those activities, as carried on within a common management structure that is 
objectively distinct from the other economic activities carried on within the Sanofi group.
The Opella activities, which have been gradually restructured into around 70 dedicated legal entities (the “Pre-Separation 
Carve-Out Transactions”), are controlled by the Sanofi group as of the date of the present combined financial statements. The 
final phase of the Pre-Separation Carve-Out Transactions calls for the equity interests held by Sanofi group subsidiaries in the 
newly-constituted Sanofi-owned dedicated entities to be legally transferred to Opella Healthcare France SAS (the “Company”, 
“the Opella group” or “the Group”), a société par actions simplifiée [simplified limited company] with its registered office at 157 
Avenue Charles de Gaulle, 92200 Neuilly-sur-Seine, France, thereby completing the creation of a standalone group consisting of 
the Company and its subsidiaries in preparation for the admission of the Company’s shares to listing on the Euronext Paris 
regulated market (the “Transaction”).
On completion of the Pre-Separation Carve-Out Transactions, assets and liabilities associated with Opella activities included in 
the scope of combination but not yet transferred will be deemed to have been contributed to Sanofi equity holders (note B.2.4.) 
as of the date of the Transaction. This applies specifically to (i) hospital sales of Opella products in China, due to be transferred 
no earlier than 2028 after a transitional period required to complete the transfer plan agreed with Sanofi in the context of public 
tendering arrangements and (ii) the newly-formed dedicated entity in Russia (note E.), the transfer of the equity interests in 
which will take effect on the date the requisite local clearances are obtained.
The Pre-Separation Carve-Out Transactions are presented in note E.
The scope of the combined group is presented in note F. 
The combined financial statements include all assets, liabilities, income, expenses and cash flows specifically attributable to the 
combined group, plus allocations of indirect costs and expenses related to the activities of the combined group and incurred by 
Sanofi (as described in notes A.2.3. and A.2.4.).
39


Transactions between entities belonging to the combined group (other than share-based transactions) have been eliminated, 
while transactions between the combined group and the Sanofi group have been presented as related party transactions.
A.2. Basis of preparation of the financial statements
A.2.1. First-time preparation of financial information under IFRS
The financial statements of Opella have been prepared in accordance with IFRS standards and interpretations as issued by the 
IASB, and as endorsed by the EU as of December 31, 2023. They present the combined financial position, combined results of 
operations and comprehensive income, changes in combined equity and combined cash flows, as extracted from the historical 
consolidated financial statements of the Sanofi group, and using the historical carrying amounts of assets and liabilities 
attributable to Opella activities as presented in the consolidated financial statements of the Sanofi group.
In preparing the combined financial information, management exercised significant judgment to determine certain accounting 
conventions used in the preparation of combined financial information.
Those significant judgments and conventions are described below.
The combined financial statements of the Opella cover the twelve-month periods ended December 31, 2021, December 31, 2022 
and December 31, 2023.
The accounting policies described below have been applied consistently for all periods presented, including in the opening 
financial position as of January 1, 2021.
A.2.2. Accounting policies applied in accordance with IFRS 1
The combined financial statements of the combined group as of December 31, 2023 are its first financial statements to have 
been prepared under IFRS. They were prepared in accordance with IFRS 1 (First-time Adoption of International Financial 
Reporting Standards). The Group has not previously prepared financial statements for this scope under IFRS or under any other 
generally accepted accounting principles.
The principal positions adopted by the Group for those financial statements were:
–
Assets and liabilities attributable to Opella activities were measured at their historical carrying amount as derived from 
the Sanofi financial statements, under the option permitted in paragraph D16(a) of IFRS 1.
–
Consequently, the assets and liabilities were measured on the basis of Sanofi’s date of transition to IFRS (January 1, 
2005) before adjustments made for the consolidation procedures of the Sanofi group, in particular adjustments 
arising from the application of IFRS 3 (Business Combinations) – such as fair value adjustments to identifiable assets 
and liabilities, and the recognition of goodwill – recorded by Sanofi as parent company.
–
Cumulative currency translation differences accounted for within combined reserves in the opening statement of 
financial position were deemed to be zero, under the option permitted in paragraph D12(a) of IFRS 1.
The combined financial statements were prepared without taking into account events after the reporting date of the Sanofi 
group financial statements for the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021. Events after the end of the reporting date of the 
Sanofi group financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2023 were taken into account in preparing the combined 
financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2023, in accordance with IAS 10 (Events After the Reporting Period).
A.2.3. Basis of preparation of the combined income statement
The combined income statement presents the historical income and expenses attributable to Opella activities as derived from 
the accounting records of the Sanofi group, plus income and expenses on transactions incurred by Sanofi on behalf of Opella 
and reported as related party transactions (note D.27.).
Past transaction flows that relate to the activities of the combined group, and constitute transactions for legal purposes 
recorded in the Sanofi financial statements, have been attributed directly to Opella activities in the combined financial 
statements.
In some specific circumstances, the combined income statement reflects certain principles of combination applied in the 
absence of past transaction flows, or where it was not possible to attribute transactions directly.
The principles of combination applied in the combined income statement in such circumstances are described below.
Revenue generated by Opella with the Sanofi group
Revenues of the combined group include sales of Opella products, classified within the line item Net sales in the combined 
income statement.
40


Revenues generated by transactions with Sanofi, classified in the line item Other revenues in the combined income statement, 
derive mainly from the following activities:
Intra-legal entity sales between Opella and the Sanofi group
Transactions carried out within a single legal entity between Opella industrial sites and Sanofi pharmaceutical sites do not 
constitute a transaction for legal purposes. However, such transactions have been separately identified and recorded as deemed 
transactions between the combined group and the Sanofi group in the combined income statement.
Such transactions are measured at the transfer price used by the Sanofi group for similar transactions as of the date of the 
transaction, in accordance with the currently applicable transfer pricing policy.
Manufacture of Sanofi products carried out by Opella on behalf of Sanofi as customer
Revenue from services involving the manufacture of Sanofi products by manufacturing sites within the combined group on 
behalf of Sanofi as customer are reflected within Other revenues in the combined income statement, as related party 
transactions. Transactions between entities in the combined group and Sanofi group entities are measured at the historical 
internal transfer price, in accordance with the internal transfer pricing policy applicable on the date of the transaction.
Distribution of Sanofi products by Opella to third-party customers of Sanofi
Where dedicated combined group entities provide distribution services relating to Sanofi pharmaceutical products, the revenue 
is reflected within Other revenues in the combined statement of comprehensive income as a related party transaction, and is 
measured at the historical price at which the relevant transactions were recorded in the books of the Sanofi group in accordance 
with the contractual arrangements applicable as of the date of the transaction.
Purchases from the Sanofi group of manufacturing services for Opella products
The cost of sales of Opella products reflects the historical cost of sales as recorded in the books of the Sanofi group. The 
purchase cost of Opella products manufactured by Sanofi and commercialized by Opella is the historical Sanofi group internal 
transfer price. In cases where the historical Sanofi transfer price is determined so as to give consideration for the roles of both 
manufacturer and intellectual property rights holder, the historical transfer price has been allocated such that the cost of goods 
sold reflects the distribution margin granted as consideration for the distribution activities carried out by Opella.
Other bought-in services necessary for the standalone operation of Opella
In order to reflect the total historical cost of Opella activities, Sanofi resources and infrastructure shared with Opella have been 
allocated based on the use made of them by Opella.
The principles used for such allocations were designed to reflect the nature of the underlying expenses, so as to ensure they 
were relevant and consistently applied for all periods presented. Consequently, allocation principles were determined for each 
function involved. For example, full time equivalent (FTE) allocated hours per Sanofi employee whose service benefits Opella 
activities was determined to be an appropriate basis for allocating the costs of the Sanofi group’s global support functions. 
Allocation formulae based on business activity or size, such as net sales, purchases, value added (for industrial sites) or total 
assets, were used for that purpose. 
Such allocations relate primarily to the following global support functions:
–
support functions such as legal affairs, finance, information systems, communications, human resources, and property 
rental/management (note A.2.4.); expenses related to customer relationship management, order processing, and 
procurement; and costs relating to Sanofi’s executive management (for example, the Executive Committee);
–
medical and regulatory activities, and promotional and commercial support such as business intelligence, market 
access, and analytical/predictive intelligence;
–
industrial support activities such as Health, Safety & Environment (HSE), global quality, and industrial excellence, along 
with costs incurred relating to REACH regulations and recognized in profit or loss for the period;
–
insurance and risk coverage programs including property and loss of profits, public liability, product liability, inventory 
and goods-in-transit cover, and environmental risks; and
–
centralized cash pooling, including netting arrangements and hedging of foreign exchange risk.
To the extent that they provide no benefit to Opella's activities, costs relating to the creation of the Opella standalone unit do 
not impact the statements of comprehensive income in the combined financial statements of Opella over all the periods 
presented.
Employee compensation and payroll-related charges
Personnel costs mainly represent the costs of transferred employees dedicated to Opella activities.
Those costs include:
–
salaries and bonuses (including social security charges) and other long-term post-employment benefits, as reflected in 
Sanofi’s payroll systems;
41


–
expenses related to equity-based compensation plans, determined (i) by reference to the existing equity-based plans 
awarded by the Sanofi group to employees belonging to Opella activities and deemed to be Opella group employees 
and (ii) on the basis of the historical fair values of those plans in the financial statements of the Sanofi group in 
accordance with IFRS 2 (Share-Based Payment), given that Opella is not constituted as a separate legal group; and
–
statutory and voluntary profit-sharing schemes for employees of the Opella group.
The payroll contribution for non-transferred Sanofi employees whose service benefits Opella activities is included within the total 
costs of central support functions incurred by the Sanofi group and allocated to Opella using the principles described in the 
previous section.
The combined financial statements include the current and non-current portions of employee-related liabilities for employees of 
the combined group. A net asset or liability position has been recognized in the combined statements of financial position for 
contributions in respect of Sanofi employees not transferred to the combined group (notes A.2.5. and D.27.).
Income taxes
Income tax expense comprises current and deferred taxes, determined as if the activities within the scope of combination 
constitute separate taxable entities.
The accounting principles applied to current and deferred taxes receivable and payable, and to deferred tax assets and liabilities, 
are described in the section on the basis of preparation of the statement of financial position (note A.2.4.).
Although the approach used to determine income tax expense (or gain) is appropriate for the purposes of preparing combined 
financial statements, it is a purely indicative measure of what the income tax expense (or gain) of the combined group would 
have been if it had been constituted of separate taxable entities.
A.2.4. Basis of preparation of the combined statement of financial position
The combined financial statements present assets and liabilities directly attributable to the combined group, plus assets and 
liabilities derived from related party transactions.
The principal conventions used for allocations in the combined statement of financial position are described below.
Goodwill
The goodwill reported in the combined financial statements results from the application of purchase accounting to assets and 
liabilities acquired in business combinations carried out by legal entities included within the scope of combination in accordance 
with IFRS 3 (Business Combinations) (note A.2.2.).
The goodwill carried in the statement of financial position relates to the acquisition on September 29, 2023 by Chattem Inc., a 
company included in the scope of combination, of QRIB Intermediate Holdings, LLC (notes D.1. and F.).
Right-of-use assets and lease liabilities
Leases attributed to Opella activities for which a right-of-use asset and lease liability are recognized comprise:
–
office space leases contracted by the Sanofi group with floor areas identified as dedicated exclusively to Opella 
activities and covered by a signed sub-lease on completion of the Pre-Separation Carve-Out Transactions (otes C.2. 
and E.), for which a right-of-use asset and lease liability are reported in the Opella combined financial statements for 
the portion attributable to Opella activities; and
–
leases relating to industrial buildings or storage centers contracted (i) by dedicated legal entities included in the scope 
of combination, for which the right-of-use asset and lease liability are recognized at their historical carrying amounts as 
recorded in the financial statements of the entity in question; and (ii) by Sanofi subsidiaries, for which the right-of-use 
asset and corresponding lease liability have been allocated proportionately to the portion attributable under the overall 
agreement entered into by Sanofi with the lessor and for which a separate lease agreement has been established on 
completion of the Pre-Separation Carve-Out Transactions (note E).
Minimum future lease payments under non-cancellable leases may change following the Pre-Separation Carve-Out Transactions 
(see note E.).
Accounts payable
Accounts payable (other than those involving related parties) are directly attributed to the combined group where the amounts 
payable relate to purchases of goods and services related to products falling within the scope of Opella activities.
Where it is not possible to attribute accounts payable directly on the basis described above, a historical liability has been 
allocated based on accounts payable as recognized in the Sanofi consolidated statement of financial position, using allocation 
formulae consistent with those used for the underlying expenditure or purchases of materials, taking account of the historical 
payment terms observed for total purchases over the period.
Combined equity, and financing of the combined group
42


As a combination of Sanofi activities under common control, Opella has no share capital for all of the periods presented. 
Combined equity represents the sum total of (i) net income attributable to Opella and (ii) net additional contributions from equity 
holders of the Sanofi group to Opella. The impacts of those contributions are recorded in equity, which reflects contributions 
and distributions (repayments) deemed to have been made between equity holders of Opella and equity holders of Sanofi.
Changes in combined equity arise from (i) comprehensive income for the period; (ii) dividends paid by legal entities within the 
scope of combination (note F.); (iii) the value of services obtained from employees under equity-based compensation plans (note 
D.22.); and (iv) net contributions from equity holders of the Sanofi group, reflecting cash flows from Opella activities carried on 
by Sanofi subsidiaries (note B.13.). 
Financing provided by Sanofi for Opella activities during all the periods presented is reflected in the combined financial position 
of Opella (i) as net contributions from equity holders of Sanofi, where such activities are carried on by Sanofi subsidiaries and (ii) 
by current financial assets and liabilities vis-à-vis Sanofi, where such activities are housed within dedicated subsidiaries included 
in the scope of combination that are parties to Sanofi’s cash pooling agreement.
The ultimate creation of the parent entity of the Opella group on completion of the Pre-Separation Carve-Out Transactions may 
alter the financing structure of Opella activities as reflected in the combined financial statements. The combined financial 
statements presented below were prepared without anticipating the effects of the legal reorganization, which will take place in 
2024.
Long-term debt
Long-term bank borrowings and debt instruments are presented in the combined statement of financial position where they 
were either (i) contracted directly by entities carrying on dedicated Opella activities or (ii) represented a component of 
contributions to the newly-formed entities created as a result of the Pre-Separation Carve-Out Transactions.
Because the bulk of financing is provided by the Sanofi group, long-term debt mainly comprises loans and borrowings 
contracted with the Sanofi group (notes D.16 and D.27.).
Short-term debt, cash and cash equivalents
Bank borrowings and debt instruments are initially measured at fair value of the consideration received, net of directly 
attributable transaction costs.
Cash and cash equivalents as shown in the statement of financial position and statement of cash flows comprise cash, plus liquid 
short-term investments that are readily convertible into cash and are subject to an insignificant risk of changes in value in the 
event of movements in interest rates and are held by legal entities included in the Opella group.
With the exception of legal entities dedicated to Opella activities (note F.), cash flows derived from Opella activities housed 
within non-dedicated legal entities included in the scope of combination are treated as equity transactions with equity holders 
of the Sanofi group, the effects of which are recorded within combined equity.
Legal entities that exclusively carry on Opella activities (note F.) are included in the Sanofi group cash pooling agreement. 
Consequently, the related year-end balances are included in Other financial assets (in the case of debit balances) or Other 
financial liabilities (in the case of credit balances) in the Opella combined statement of financial position.
Current and deferred income tax assets and liabilities
Current and deferred income tax expenses, and tax receivables and liabilities, have been determined in accordance with the 
principles described above for the preparation of the combined income statement (note A.2.3.).
Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized where temporary differences arise between the carrying amount and taxable 
base of assets and liabilities reflected in the Opella combined financial statements, in accordance with the principles specified in 
IAS 12 (note B.21.).
Deferred tax assets arising from temporary differences between carrying amounts and tax bases, or from tax losses available for 
carry-forward, are recognized if their recovery is regarded as probable.
In the absence of an offset clause, no deferred tax assets have been recognized in the statement of financial position in respect 
of tax losses which have generated tax savings that were transferred to Sanofi as parent entity under group tax agreements. 
Transfers of tax savings are reflected in equity as contributions or distributions vis-à-vis the equity holders of Sanofi for each 
period presented.
Tax receivables and liabilities generated by Opella activities of non-dedicated entities that are not required to submit separate 
tax returns have been recognized in the combined financial statements in the periods during which they were generated, and 
are deemed to have been distributed or transferred to the taxable entities of the Sanofi group in line with the tax payment 
schedule applying to each entity.
Tax payments made by dedicated legal entities or deemed to have been made by non-dedicated legal entities in the scope of 
combination are presented in the statement of cash flows in the same way as the underlying transaction.
Tax receivables and tax liabilities determined for non-dedicated legal entities and for dedicated legal entities belonging to a 
group tax election are presented within the line items Other non-current assets, Other current assets, Other non-current 
liabilities and Other current liabilities in the Opella combined statement of financial position.
43


The impacts of deferred taxes on the Opella combined statement of financial position are presented in note D.13.
The basis of preparation described above enables the financial information to reflect the assets and liabilities of Opella, the 
results of its operations, and the costs of the support functions that would be necessary for it to operate independently. 
However, because Opella did not operate as a standalone entity during the periods presented, the financial information may not 
be representative of the future performance of the business, and may not necessarily reflect what the results of operations, 
financial position or cash flows would have been if Opella had been a standalone entity operating separately from the Sanofi 
group during the periods presented.
A.2.5. Related party transactions
Transactions with (i) entities over which Sanofi exercises control or significant influence and (ii) joint ventures, which are 
customarily accounted for as intragroup transactions and eliminated as part of the consolidation procedures applied for the 
purposes of preparing the Sanofi consolidated financial statements, have been treated as related party transactions where they 
are not intragroup transactions within the Opella group. Such transactions are reported as related party transactions in the 
Opella combined financial statements, in accordance with IAS 24 (Related Party Disclosures) (note D.27.).
Transactions between related parties (the combined group and Sanofi) comprise the following types of transaction:
–
sales of services in the form of the distribution of pharmaceutical products on behalf of Sanofi as customer;
–
sales of services in the form of the manufacture of pharmaceutical products for Sanofi as customer;
–
purchases of services in the form of the manufacture by Sanofi of products from the Opella portfolio;
–
purchases of other general and administrative services necessary for carrying on Opella activities, mainly comprising 
(i) the costs of Sanofi personnel engaged on Opella activities but who are not intended to be transferred and (ii) the 
costs of using shared resources. 
In addition to short-term current accounts with Sanofi (note A.2.4.), the combined statement of financial position includes the 
following positions with related parties:
Accounts receivable and other current receivables with related parties (notes D.11 and D.27.)
–
Accounts receivable resulting from commercial transactions entered into with Sanofi group companies, representing 
the last two months of sales in line with historical payment terms applied within the Sanofi group; and
–
Other current receivables resulting from services provided by the combined group to the Sanofi group, estimated on 
the basis of internal payment terms applied within the Sanofi group.
Accounts payable and other current liabilities with related parties (notes D.16.1 and D.27.)
–
Accounts payable, representing liabilities arising on Opella products supplied by Sanofi manufacturing facilities, and 
reflecting internal payment terms applied within the Sanofi group;
–
Liabilities related to shared central services and other liabilities, after taking account of internal payment terms applied 
within the Sanofi group; and
–
Other liabilities relating to (i) personnel costs and social security charges incurred by Sanofi on behalf of the combined 
group in respect of employees not intended to be transferred (note D.21.), and (ii) income taxes of entities that were not 
separate legal entities as of the end of the reporting period.
As specified in the section on combined equity (note A.2.4.), payments in respect of related party transactions are ultimately 
reflected in cash flows from financing activities within the statement of cash flows, and recognized within the equity of the 
combined group as net contributions from equity holders of Sanofi to the combined group.
A.2.6. Impact of climate change
In preparing the combined financial statements, the impact of climate change on the current valuation of assets and liabilities 
has been taken into account. The combined group does not consider there to be any material impact on judgments relating to 
financial information or estimates as a result of climate change, and consequently the valuation of assets and liabilities has not 
been materially affected by climate risks during all three periods presented. The impact of climate change on growth rates and 
cash flow projections used in connection with impairment testing of goodwill and license agreements (note D.5.) was specifically 
considered.
44


C/Non-IFRS Alternative Performance Measures (APMs)
C.1. Definitions of non-IFRS APMs
In addition to IFRS performance measures like Operating income (EBIT), Opella also uses several alternative, non-IFRS 
performance measures to monitor and evaluate its operating and financial performance. Adjusted Gross Profit, Adjusted EBIT 
(and Adjusted EBIT Margin), Adjusted EBITDA, and Free Cash Flow are alternative performance measures within the meaning of 
AMF position statement 2015-12.
Opella believes that these non-IFRS alternative performance measures provide useful and relevant information regarding its 
performance and improve its ability to assess its financial position. While similar measures are widely used in the industry in which 
it operates, the financial measures Opella uses may not be comparable to other similarly titled measures used by the Sanofi 
Group (such as Net Debt or Free Cash Flow) or by other companies, nor are they intended to be regarded as substitutes for 
measures of financial performance or financial position as prepared in accordance with IFRS. 
C.1.1. Adjusted Gross Profit
Adjusted Gross Profit, which is reviewed by management and which Opella regards as providing useful information to measure 
its operational performance, is determined by making the following adjustments to Gross profit : 
•
eliminating amortization and impairment losses charged against intangible assets (other than software and other rights 
of an industrial or operational nature) and recognized in Cost of sales; 
•
eliminating amounts recognized in Cost of sales arising from the effects of restructuring programs, including (i) costs 
associated with collective employee separation plans, (ii) compensation paid to third parties for early termination of 
contracts or commitments entered into as a result of transformation and reorganization decisions, (iii) accelerated 
depreciation associated with the closure of sites (including leased sites), and (iv) losses on asset divestments resulting 
from such decisions; and
•
eliminating expenses recognized in Cost of sales arising from the remeasurement of assets acquired in a business 
combination (IFRS 3) or from acquisitions of groups of assets that do not constitute a business within the meaning of 
paragraph 2(b) of IFRS 3. 
C.1.2. Adjusted EBIT (and adjusted EBIT margin)
Opella reports segment operating results on the basis of Adjusted EBIT.
Adjusted EBIT, used internally by management to measure the operational performance of each operating segment and to 
allocate resources, is determined by making the following adjustments to Operating income (EBIT) as reported under IFRS:
•
eliminating amortization and impairment losses charged against intangible assets (other than software and other rights of 
an industrial or operational nature);
•
eliminating fair value adjustments to contingent consideration related to (i) business combinations (IFRS 3) or (ii) business 
divestitures;
•
eliminating expenses arising from the remeasurement of assets acquired in a business combination (IFRS  3), or from 
acquisitions of groups of assets that do not constitute a business within the meaning of paragraph 2(b) of IFRS 3;
•
eliminating the effects of restructuring programs, including (i) costs associated with collective employee separation plans, 
(ii) compensation paid to third parties for early termination of contracts or commitments entered into as a result of 
transformation or reorganization decisions, (iii) accelerated depreciation associated with the closure of sites (including 
leased sites), and (iv) losses on asset divestments resulting from such decisions;
•
eliminating the costs of the separation of the Sanofi group's activities, including marginal and non-recurring costs 
associated with the separation of the combined group's activities from those of the Sanofi group to enable full standalone 
operation of the combined group and the eventual exit from the transitional service agreements entered into with Sanofi;
•
eliminating other gains and losses, litigation, and other items regarded as being of an unusual nature or amount;
•
adding back the share of profits/losses from investments accounted for using the equity method, to the extent that this 
relates to joint ventures and associates with which the combined group has a strategic alliance; and
•
deducting the share attributable to non-controlling interests.
"Adjusted EBIT margin" is the ratio of Adjusted EBIT to net sales.
45


C.1.3. Adjusted EBITDA
Adjusted EBITDA is an alternative, non-IFRS financial measure monitored by management, which is considered by Opella to 
provide useful information for measuring its operational performance.
Adjusted EBITDA is calculated by adding the following items back to Adjusted EBIT: depreciation, amortization and impairment 
of (i) property, plant and equipment (including rights of use relating to leased assets) and (ii) software and other rights of an 
industrial or operational nature.
C.1.4. Free Cash Flow
Free Cash Flow is an alternative, non-IFRS financial measure monitored by management, which is considered by Opella to 
provide useful information for measuring the net cash generated by its operations and available for (i) strategic M&A activity, (ii) 
repayment of debt and (iii) returning capital to equity holders.
Free cash flow is determined by reference to the closest IFRS measure, Net cash provided by/(used in) operating activities, as 
presented in the combined financial statements. That figure is adjusted for the amounts reported for "Acquisitions of property, 
plant and equipment and intangible assets", "Acquisitions of equity interests and other non-current assets", and "Proceeds from 
disposals of property, plant and equipment, intangible assets and other non-current assets, net of tax"; for cash flows related to 
significant litigation and other items regarded as unusual due to their nature or amount (including the impact of exchange rates 
on intragroup financing transactions), while excluding strategic investments (net of divestments).

*Due to practical considerations, Free Cash Flow has not been restated for the year ended December 31, 2021.
The historical organization of Opella's activities differs from the target organizational structure on implementation of the 
Reorganization. To give investors a better understanding of the contractual and organizational implications of the 
implementation of Opella’s new business model resulting from the Reorganization, Opella is voluntarily providing financial 
information restated as though the Reorganization had been implemented as of January 1, 2021, for the following indicators: 
restated Net Sales, restated Other Revenues, restated Adjusted Gross Profit, restated Adjusted EBIT, restated Adjusted EBIT 
margin, restated Adjusted EBITDA and Free Cash Flow.
This restated financial information is unaudited, and relies on certain assumptions and estimates regarded as reasonable by 
management.
The restatements primarily consist of the following:
•
“Scope restatements”: for the following items, revenues and costs as recognized in the combined financial statements 
have been replaced by revenues and costs reflecting Opella's new business model:
•
Opella products in China, for which the transfer of the market authorizations from Sanofi to Opella will be finalized 
no later than 2028, at the end of a transitional period required to complete the transfer plan agreed with Sanofi in 
the context of public tendering arrangements. The restatement reflects (i) the loss of the associated net sales, 
and (ii) the share of Other revenues generated as a result of Opella supplying Sanofi with the active ingredients 
required for the manufacture of those products; 
•
prescription products in Japan distributed by the Sanofi group. The restatement reflects the loss of Other 
revenues associated with those products as consideration for (i) the royalties that Opella will receive from the 
Sanofi group as holder of the intellectual property rights, and (ii) other revenues generated as a result of some of 
the production being provided by the manufacturing capability of Opella; and
•
the Russian legal entity, historically part of the consumer healthcare business within Sanofi, which will not be 
transferred (due to legal constraints) by the date of Opella’s initial public offering. The relevant activity in that 
48


country will be conducted via a distribution agreement with effect from the Separation date (see Section 17.1, 
"Agreements entered into between Sanofi and Opella for completion of the Separation"), until such time as the 
transfer can be completed. The restatement reflects the impact of the loss of distribution profits, which will be 
retained by Sanofi under the new business model.
•
“Functional Autonomy Organization (FAO)”: the restatement involves cancelling some of Sanofi's central costs invoiced 
to Opella, and applying retrospectively the effects of implementing the target organizational structure expected to be 
in effect from the Separation date. The additional costs relative to the historical financial statements mainly relate to 
the setting up of (i) the IT function and (ii) other functions (in particular Insurance, Science, Finance and Real Estate 
Facility Management). These additional costs include but are not limited to:
•
personnel costs calculated on the basis of the number of full-time equivalents (FTEs) required per function and of 
applicable market salaries; and
•
costs related to the Forward Transitional Services Agreements, which govern the provision of services between 
Opella and Sanofi and will take effect from the Separation date in order to ensure continuity of functions not yet 
carried out by Opella (such as [certain back office and distribution services]).
•
“Sanofi agreements”: the restatement involves applying retrospectively the supply prices set out in the following 
agreements entered into between Opella and Sanofi, which will come into force from the Separation date:
•
Forward MSA: covers non-consumer healthcare products manufactured by Opella for supply to Sanofi. This 
restatement involves retroactively applying the sales prices as agreed at the effective date in those agreements 
to historical business volumes.
•
Reverse MSA: covers consumer healthcare products manufactured by Sanofi for supply to Opella. This 
restatement involves retroactively applying the purchase prices as agreed at the effective date of these 
agreements to historical business volumes.
•
"Other": the restatement involves cancelling the other revenues and costs associated with certain products not 
intended for the consumer healthcare sector, which Opella has decided to discontinue in the first half of 2025.
Notwithstanding this restatement, Opella expects to continue benefiting from services and from some synergies for as long as 
Sanofi remains the controlling shareholder of Opella.
End.
