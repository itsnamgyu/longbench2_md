Middle East Misery
when i read “hell from the 
Heavens” [July 31], I could not help but
remember the Lebanese poet Kahlil
Gibran’s cry “Fear God, oh History, and
afflict me no more.” As a Lebanese-Ameri-
can I remember the heavy hand of histo-
ry that has dealt Lebanon one blow after
another since 1943. Even geography was
not sympathetic, sandwiching the Land
of Cedars between two enemies, Syria and
Israel. The international community will
be doing well to station 
deterring forces between
Lebanon and Israel. But
also sending international
observers to the border be-
tween Syria and Lebanon
and stopping arms smug-
gling from Syria and Iran
into Lebanon should be 
implemented.
Kameel Kosta
Sicklerville, N.J. 
in “hell from the
Heavens,” Hassan Nasral-
lah, the leader of Hezbollah, is quoted as
having said, “All of northern occupied
Palestine is within range. Its ports, its
bases, its factories, and everything locat-
ed there.” This reveals two important
points. First, occupied Palestine, in his
mind, does not refer to Gaza and the West
Bank but to all of Israel. Second, it shows
Hezbollah’s ability and willingness to
strike wherever it wants within Israel. It
is clear from these statements that Nas-
rallah seeks nothing less than the com-
plete destruction of the State of Israel.
Richard Simons
Framingham, Mass.
it has been noted and quoted by
Palestinians and Lebanese that Hezbol-
lah and Hamas are for the people.
Meeting the basic needs of the populace
gives them a forum for their insidious
agendas and brainwashing. Herein lies
the solution: The leaders of Lebanon
must be committed to the betterment
of all people, but especially the poor.
This is where democracy will live or die.
An illiterate, poverty-stricken people
will be easily swayed by whatever doc-
trine, if they are fed and clothed. How
is there so much poverty and illiteracy
where there are billions of dollars in
oil? Corrupt leadership will be the un-
doing of currently friendly countries
like Egypt and Saudi Arabia if they do
not become “for the people.”
Mike Hester
Fort Collins, Colo.
hezbollah, hamas, and the pales-
tine Liberation Organization have
clearly achieved their goal: They are
seen as legitimate organizations will-
ing to fight for their objectives. I re-
member being a teary-eyed third grad-
er, hearing about a Jewish man in a
wheelchair tossed over the side of a
ship by a pro-plo group. The world un-
derstood then that such people have no
right to have their opinion voiced, let
alone listened to. We now allow them
credibility by placing them on the front
covers of magazines.

Learning Curve
i was more than dis-
appointed with “17 and All
Burned Out” [August 7],
featuring an interview with
Yale graduate Alexandra
Robbins about her new
book, The Overachievers.
Being a junior in high
school, I admit that I
dread the frustrating, tiring, and stress-
ful evil known as the college application
process, but I think the number of
“pressured” high schoolers was exag-
gerated. Students are stressed about the
college process, but only a few go the
extra mile and give it their full atten-
tion. The subtler message in the inter-
view was that being an overachiever is
bad; that overachievers don’t care about
learning, only grade scores. Everyone
knows that colleges don’t want a sole-
ly book-smart student. Many of us bal-
ance busy schedules ranging from ten-
nis to the school newspaper outside
academic life. It’s expected that high
school will be hectic. Overachievers are
often not given enough credit. Genuine
overachievers who love learning and be-
come accomplished are not as numer-
ous as implied.
Maggie Liu
Dover, Del.
the “trickle-down problem” men-
tioned in your interview with author
Alexandra Robbins about “driven stu-
dents” does not begin with the top stu-
dents’ impact on others. It begins with
state requirements, with colleges that
look at numbers, not people, and with
standards that are interested more in
statistics than in imagination and vi-
sion. Our education system is no longer
intent upon fashioning minds that can
think but rather minds that can assim-
ilate. So instead of creativity and imag-

ination, which Einstein
said was more important
than intelligence, we are
fostering the ability to re-
peat what others have
said, rather than having
an original idea or argu-
ing the merits of what
others have said. This fits
in well with the philoso-
phy of our current polit-
ical regime, or perhaps
our political system is a

Davina Rubin
Napa, Calif.
Family Matters
we at georgetown university’s  
Institute for Reproductive Health agree
with your article “Contraceptive Confu-
sion” [August 7] and its point that the
most important factor in using con-
traception effectively is finding an op-
tion that will be used correctly and con-
sistently. The article outlines most of
the options available but did not de-
scribe an option that is ideal for many
women—natural family planning. The
institute has recently developed two of
these methods, the Standard Days
Method and the TwoDay Method. The
Standard Days Method is a simple, nat-
ural option based on sophisticated
computer modeling of reproductive
physiology data that uses a visual tool
called CycleBeads. These color-coded
beads help a woman keep track of her
cycle, know which days she can get
pregnant, and monitor the length of
her menstrual cycle. The TwoDay
Method relies on the presence or ab-
sence of cervical secretions but does
not require the analysis and charting
of older natural methods. 
Victoria Jennings, Ph.D.
Director

Washington, D.C.
“contraceptive confusion” cer-
tainly encompassed a large realm of
contraceptives for women. Male part-
ners, however, should also share in 
the responsibility. Many years ago 
in my professional healthcare work, 
I wrote to several pharmaceutical 
chief executive officers asking why 
they weren’t producing a birth-
control medication for men. Not one
replied. My conclusion was that they
saw no need. Women were captive pa-
tients. Why should women have all the 
responsibility?
Phyllis Leslie
Bothell, Wash.
Pulpit Politics
in washington whispers [“yo,
Evangelicals! Nobody Gets a Pass,” Au-
gust 14–21], we were told that Grover
Norquist, head of Americans for Tax Re-
form, is worried that evangelical Chris-
tians don’t have a succession plan for re-
placing their aging leaders. If a tax
reform leader is fretting over who will fill
our radio and tv pulpits, then how much
more evidence do we need that Christian
voters have indeed been duped and used
for a money-based agenda?
Daniel Davis
Los Lunas, N.M.
Oil Pricing Perils
mortimer b. zuckerman had it
perfect in his editorial regarding how to
wean America from foreign oil, until he
implored raising gas taxes to European
levels [“Getting Serious About Oil,” Au-
gust 7]. Not a good idea since European
economic growth is at a standstill, and
its onerous energy taxes are only one
reason. Doing likewise in America will
be an economic anchor. Aside from this
suggestion, the rest of his column, es-
pecially easing the restraints on do-

Letters
mestic drilling and expanding nuclear
power, made perfect sense.
Tony Siciliano
Framingham, Mass.
i agree with zuckerman that
Americans need to change their ways
about oil consumption, but both federal
and state governments have to take a
more aggressive approach to financing
mass transit. Several months ago, Am-
trak was denied funding and had to shut
down service in its northeast corridor be-
tween New York and Washington, D.C.,
for a short period of time. I live 35 miles
from Philadelphia and had no direct
transit or rail service to that city. It can
take two hours or more to drive there on
the busy Schuylkill Expressway. The gov-
ernment and politicians should stop the
bureaucratic bumbling and move to
more mass transit now.
Debra A. Kassel
Pottstown, Pa.
long ago we should have ac-
cepted President Jimmy Carter’s sug-
gestion to levy a customs duty on im-
ported oil. It would have done wonders
to eliminate windfall profits to foreign
producers, to keep the wholesale prices
low, and to lower our shameful national
debt. We will all be paying even more se-
verely if current pricing policies are not
corrected soon. It is time that this es-
sential commodity be taken out of the
hands of market speculators who keep
bidding up our cost of energy unneces-
sarily. We must adopt a more sensible
practice of having representatives of
both exporting and importing countries
negotiate acceptable prices that we can
all live with, before economies collapse.
Paul L. Liberty
President
Liberty Petroleum Corp. 
Las Vegas
the united states imports a 
small percentage of oil from the Middle
East. Its biggest foreign supplier is Cana-
da, followed closely by Mexico. The Unit-
ed States has a free-trade agreement
with both of these countries and neither
of them nurtures terrorists. The price of
oil is dependent today on the production
costs more than on supply and demand.
Gas, even with the heavy production
costs, is a bargain. A 1-liter bottle of
water requires no manufacturing but
costs almost twice as much as a liter of
gasoline. Nobody complains about the
price of the water.

ERICH HARTMANN—MAGNUM

U.S.NEWS & WORLD REPORT • WWW.USNEWS.COM • AUGUST 28, 2006
y summer vacation.” What joy those
words once brought. Just a few
decades ago it all seemed so simple,
inspiring schoolchildren to lovingly
pen odes to the sun-soaked holidays,
to fishing poles and camping tents, to
beach houses and boardwalks, to
honest-to-God family time. With
Gershwin’s words “Summertime and the living is easy”
crackling through the radio, Mom and Dad piled the
kids into the back of the station wagon for at least two
weeks away from the worries of daily life. Eight cylin-
ders of American power in 1960 would propel you to
Cape Cod, the Adirondacks, the Ozarks, the Grand
Tetons, or Yellowstone for the average price of 31
cents per gallon of gas. As a special treat the family
might take a once-in-a-lifetime vacation onboard the
most luxurious form of travel around, the airplane.
If it were only so easy today. Leave the suntan lo-
tion and other liquids at home. Strip off the jackets,
the belts, and the shoes while standing in a two-
hour line as National Guard troops with automatic
weapons stand at the ready and government work-
ers in latex gloves give pat-downs and rifle through
belongings. Take the car instead? Not with the price
of gas hovering at $3 a gallon nationwide. It’s hard
enough to get to work, let alone buy enough gas to
take a vacation from it. And then you’re just putting
money into the pockets of oil sheiks who may wish
harm on you and your family. This is not just misty-
eyed nostalgia. Escapism today seems to have . . . es-
caped. You won’t find it on tv—not in the world of
round-the-clock news, the war in Iraq, the war in
the Middle East, the confessions of crazed killers—
or maybe just attention-seeking wackos.
It’s not all bad out there. The economy’s good,
everybody’s got jobs, and Best Buy is stocked with
every gadget you could ever want. But maybe all
these technological advances that have brought the
world closer together have had the effect of making
it a little too cramped as well. BlackBerrys and cell-
phones are great—but so is getting away from it all.
And, this summer, more than most, feels like one to
get away from. l

Animal House in 
the West Wing
He loves to cuss, gets a jolly
when a mountain biker
wipes out trying to keep up
with him, and now we’re
learning that the first frat
boy loves flatulence jokes. A
top insider let that slip
when explaining why Presi-
dent Bush is paranoid around
women, always worried
about his behavior. But he’s
still a funny, earthy guy
who, for example, can’t get
enough of fart jokes. He’s
also known to cut a few for
laughs, especially when
greeting new young aides,
but forget about getting 
people to gas about that.
Spy Mom’s Sale:
Discount Tights
She might be the most fa-
mous ex-spy in America, but
Valerie Plame is still a mom
stuck with mommy duties.
Like taking her daughter to
ballet and trying to sell off
the cute dancing ensemble
that doesn’t fit anymore. We
know because her ad
showed up on the DC Urban
Moms site last week offer-
ing a complete outfit in “soft
lemon yellow” from the ex-
clusive “Ballet Petite” school
in her neighborhood. It in-
cludes a size 5/6 Repetto
bodysuit, matching chiffon
yellow tie-shirt, kids size 12
pink ballet shoes, and white
leotards. “All in excellent
condition! If bought sepa-
rately, would easily cost
$75; selling for $45.” Natu-
rally, when we contacted her
she was a bit cautious, hav-
ing just sued the veep and
others for blowing her cover
in the Iraq weapons case.
She did, however, stay on
focus. “I guess my only com-
ment is: Do you want to buy
the Ballet Petite outfit or
know someone who does?”
she E-mails. “My 6-year-old
daughter has outgrown it.”

D
on’t laugh, but a loaner training kayak in the
pool of the House of Representatives gym
made the difference in President Bush’s House
victory for a pork-busting line-item veto.
“That’s spot on,” says Colorado Rep. Mark Udall,
who helped talk 34 other Democrats into backing the
measure 247 to 172. It now faces Senate action. Say out-
door enthusiasts Udall and former Rep. Rob Portman, now
Bush’s budget director: It was their passion for kayaking
and Portman’s loaner to the gym that led to their friend-
ship and eventual pairing to seek passage of the line-
item veto. “It’s an icebreaker,” Republican Portman says
of kayaking, “something you can talk about.”
And more. Both say that practicing together in the
House pool built a trust uncommon in politics. “You can
develop relationships through that,” says Portman, a for-
mer Ohio lawmaker. “I trust Mark, he trusts me, because
we’ve gotten to know each other through the outdoors,”
adds Portman, who’s kayaked thousands of miles since
he built his first boat out of fiberglass in college. “It’s a
shared experience of what it takes to stay calm, not over-
reacting,” says Udall, who says: “It applies in the human
world, too.” If only Portman could find a kayaking sena-
tor to help there. Ironically, the duo has never really pad-
dled anywhere together. “We talk about it a lot,” says
Portman. “That’s more fun than going on the trip.”

® is one pill* for my
high blood pressure...
and for my 
high cholesterol.”
The leading branded medicines† for high blood pressure,
Norvasc
® (amlodipine besylate), and high cholesterol,
Lipitor
® (atorvastatin calcium) combined in one pill.
IMPORTANT INFORMATION: Caduet is a pre-
scription drug that combines 2 medicines, Norvasc and
Lipitor. Norvasc is used to treat high blood pressure
(hypertension), chest pain (angina), or blocked arteries
of the heart (coronary artery disease); Lipitor is used
along with diet and exercise to lower high cholesterol.It
is also used to lower the risk of heart attack and stroke in
people with multiple risk factors for heart disease – such
as family history, high blood pressure, age, low HDL-C,
or smoking.
Caduet is not for everyone. It is not for those with liver
problems.And it is not for women who are nursing, are
pregnant,or may become pregnant.If you take Caduet,tell
your doctor if you feel any new muscle pain or weakness.
This could be a sign of rare but serious muscle side effects.
T
ell your doctor about all of the medicines you take.This
may help avoid serious drug interactions. Your doctor
should do blood tests to check your liver function before
and during treatment and may adjust your dose. If you
have any heart problems, be sure to tell your doctor.The
most common side effects are edema, headache, and
dizziness.They tend to be mild and often go away.
Caduet is one of many options for treating high blood
pressure and high cholesterol, in addition to diet and
exercise,that you or your doctor can consider.
Ask your doctor if Caduet is right
for you. Caduet is one pill with proven 
benefits. It lowers high blood pressure and 
high cholesterol along with diet and 
exercise. One pill that does two things.

CADUET® (amlodipine besylate /atorvastatin calcium) Tablets
Brief Summary: for full prescribing information, see package insert.
INDICATIONS AND USAGE: CADUET (amlodipine and atorvastatin) is indicated in patients for whom treatment with 
both amlodipine and atorvastatin is appropriate. Amlodipine: 1. Hypertension: Amlodipine is indicated for the 
treatment of hypertension. It may be used alone or in combination with other antihypertensive agents; 2. Coronary 
Artery Disease (CAD) Chronic Stable Angina: Amlodipine is indicated for the treatment of chronic stable angina.
Amlodipine may be used alone or in combination with other antianginal or antihypertensive agents; Vasospastic 
Angina (Prinzmetal’s or Variant Angina): Amlodipine is indicated for the treatment of conﬁrmed or suspected 
vasospastic angina. Amlodipine may be used as monotherapy or in combination with other antianginal drugs.
Angiographically Documented CAD: In patients with recently documented CAD by angiography and without heart 
failure or an ejection fraction <40%, amlodipine is indicated to reduce the risk of hospitalization due to angina and 
to reduce the risk of a coronary revascularization procedure. AND Atorvastatin: 1. Prevention of Cardiovascular 
Disease: In adult patients without clinically evident coronary heart disease,but with multiple risk factors for coronary 
heart disease such as age, smoking, hypertension, low HDL-C, or a family history of early coronary heart disease,
atorvastatin is indicated to:
-Reduce the risk of myocardial infarction
-Reduce the risk of stroke
-Reduce the risk for revascularization procedures and angina
In patients with type 2 diabetes, and without clinically evident coronary heart disease, but with multiple risk factors 
for coronary heart disease such as retinopathy, albuminuria, smoking, or hypertension, LIPITOR is indicated to:
-Reduce the risk of myocardial infarction
-Reduce the risk of stroke;
2. Heterozygous Familial and Nonfamilial Hypercholesterolemia: Atorvastatin is indicated as an adjunct to diet to 
reduce elevated total-C, LDL-C, apo B, and TG levels and to increase HDL-C in patients with primary 
hypercholesterolemia (heterozygous familial and nonfamilial) and mixed dyslipidemia (Fredrickson Types IIa and 
IIb); 3. Elevated Serum TG Levels: Atorvastatin is indicated as an adjunct to diet for the treatment of patients with 
elevated serum TG levels (Fredrickson Type IV); 4. Primary Dysbetalipoproteinemia: Atorvastatin is indicated for the 
treatment of patients with primary dysbetalipoproteinemia (Fredrickson Type III) who do not respond adequately to 
diet; 5. Homozygous Familial Hypercholesterolemia: Atorvastatin is indicated to reduce total-C and LDL-C in 
patients with homozygous familial hypercholesterolemia as an adjunct to other lipid-lowering treatments (e.g., LDL 
apheresis) or if such treatments are unavailable; 6. Pediatric Patients: Atorvastatin is indicated as an adjunct to 
diet to reduce total-C, LDL-C, and apo B levels in boys and postmenarchal girls, 10 to 17 years of age, with 
heterozygous familial hypercholesterolemia if after an adequate trial of diet therapy the following ﬁndings are present:
a. LDL-C remains  190 mg/dL or
b. LDL-C remains  160 mg/dL and:
· there is a positive family history of premature cardiovascular disease or
· two or more other CVD risk factors are present in the pediatric patients.
Therapy with lipid-altering agents should be a component of multiple-risk-factor intervention in individuals 
at increased risk for atherosclerotic vascular disease due to hypercholesterolemia. Lipid-altering agents should 
be used, in addition to a diet restricted in saturated fat and cholesterol, only when the response to diet and 
other nonpharmacological measures has been inadequate (see National Cholesterol Education Program (NCEP) 
Guidelines, summarized in Table 1).

a CHD, coronary heart disease. b Some authorities recommend use of LDL-lowering drugs in this category if an 
LDL-C level of < 100 mg/dL cannot be achieved by therapeutic lifestyle changes. Others prefer use of drugs that 
primarily modify triglycerides and HDL-C, e.g., nicotinic acid or ﬁbrate. Clinical judgment also may call for deferring 
drug therapy in this subcategory. c Almost all people with 0-1 risk factor have 10-year risk <10%; thus, 10-year risk 
assessment in people with 0-1 risk factor is not necessary.
After the LDL-C goal has been achieved, if the TG is still  200 mg/dL, non-HDL-C (total-C minus HDL-C) becomes a 
secondary target of therapy. Non-HDL-C goals are set 30 mg/dL higher than LDL-C goals for each risk category. Prior 
to initiating therapy with atorvastatin, secondary causes for hypercholesterolemia (e.g., poorly controlled diabetes 
mellitus, hypothyroidism, nephrotic syndrome, dysproteinemias, obstructive liver disease, other drug therapy, and 
alcoholism) should be excluded, and a lipid proﬁle performed to measure total-C, LDL-C, HDL-C, and TG. For patients 
with TG <400 mg/dL (<4.5 mmol/L), LDL-C can be estimated using the following equation: LDL-C = total-C - (0.20 
x [TG] + HDL-C). For TG levels >400 mg/dL (>4.5 mmol/L), this equation is less accurate and LDL-C concentrations 
should be determined by ultracentrifugation. The antidyslipidemic component of CADUET has not been studied in 
conditions where the major lipoprotein abnormality is elevation of chylomicrons (Fredrickson Types I and V). The 
NCEP classiﬁcation of cholesterol levels in pediatric patients with a familial history of hypercholesterolemia or 
premature cardiovascular disease is summarized below:

CONTRAINDICATIONS: CADUET contains atorvastatin and is therefore contraindicated in patients with active liver 
disease or unexplained persistent elevations of serum transaminases. CADUET is contraindicated in patients with 
known hypersensitivity to any component of this medication. Pregnancy and Lactation: Atherosclerosis is a chronic 
process and discontinuation of lipid-lowering drugs during pregnancy should have little impact on the outcome of 
long-term therapy of primary hypercholesterolemia. Cholesterol and other products of cholesterol biosynthesis are 
essential components for fetal development (including synthesis of steroids and cell membranes). Since HMG-
CoA reductase inhibitors decrease cholesterol synthesis and possibly the synthesis of other biologically active 
substances derived from cholesterol, they may cause fetal harm when administered to pregnant women. Therefore,
HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors are contraindicated during pregnancy and in nursing mothers. CADUET, WHICH 
INCLUDES ATORVASTATIN, SHOULD BE ADMINISTERED TO WOMEN OF CHILDBEARING AGE ONLY WHEN SUCH 
PATIENTS ARE HIGHLY UNLIKELY TO CONCEIVE AND HAVE BEEN INFORMED OF THE POTENTIAL HAZARDS. If the 
patient becomes pregnant while taking this drug, therapy should be discontinued and the patient apprised of the 
potential hazard to the fetus.
WARNINGS: Increased Angina and/or Myocardial Infarction: Rarely, patients, particularly those with severe 
obstructive coronary artery disease, have developed documented increased frequency, duration and/or severity 
of angina or acute myocardial infarction on starting calcium channel blocker therapy or at the time of dosage 
increase. The mechanism of this effect has not been elucidated. Liver Dysfunction: HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors,
like some other lipid-lowering therapies, have been associated with biochemical abnormalities of liver function.
Persistent elevations (>3 times the upper limit of normal [ULN] occurring on 2 or more occasions) in serum 
transaminases occurred in 0.7% of patients who received atorvastatin in clinical trials. The incidence of 
these abnormalities was 0.2%, 0.2%, 0.6%, and 2.3% for 10, 20, 40, and 80 mg, respectively. In clinical trials 
in patients taking atorvastatin the following has been observed. One patient in clinical trials developed jaundice.
Increases in liver function tests (LFT) in other patients were not associated with jaundice or other clinical signs or 
symptoms. Upon dose reduction, drug interruption, or discontinuation, transaminase levels returned to or near 
pretreatment levels without sequelae. Eighteen of 30 patients, with persistent LFT elevations continued treatment 
with a reduced dose of atorvastatin. It is recommended that liver function tests be performed prior to and at 12 
weeks following both the initiation of therapy and any elevation of dose, and periodically (e.g., semiannually) 
thereafter. Liver enzyme changes generally occur in the ﬁrst 3 months of treatment with atorvastatin. Patients who 
develop increased transaminase levels should be monitored until the abnormalities resolve. Should an increase 
in ALT or AST of >3 times ULN persist, reduction of dose or withdrawal of CADUET is recommended. CADUET 
should be used with caution in patients who consume substantial quantities of alcohol and/or have a history 
of liver disease. Active liver disease or unexplained persistent transaminase elevations are contraindications to 
the use of CADUET (see CONTRAINDICATIONS). Skeletal Muscle: Rare cases of rhabdomyolysis with acute 
renal failure secondary to myoglobinuria have been reported with the atorvastatin component of CADUET 
and with other drugs in the HMG-CoA reductase inhibitor class. Uncomplicated myalgia has been reported in 
atorvastatin-treated patients (see ADVERSE REACTIONS). Myopathy, deﬁned as muscle aches or muscle weakness 
in conjunction with increases in creatine phosphokinase (CPK) values >10 times ULN, should be considered in any 
patient with diffuse myalgias, muscle tenderness or weakness, and/or marked elevation of CPK. Patients should 
be advised to report promptly unexplained muscle pain, tenderness or weakness, particularly if accompanied by
malaise or fever. CADUET therapy should be discontinued if markedly elevated CPK levels occur or myopathy is 
diagnosed or suspected. The risk of myopathy during treatment with drugs in the HMG-CoA reductase inhibitor 
class is increased with concurrent administration of cyclosporine, ﬁbric acid derivatives, erythromycin, niacin, or 
azole antifungals. Physicians considering combined therapy with CADUET and ﬁbric acid derivatives, erythromycin,
immunosuppressive drugs, azole antifungals, or lipid-lowering doses of niacin should carefully weigh the potential 
beneﬁts and risks and should carefully monitor patients for any signs or symptoms of muscle pain, tenderness,
or weakness, particularly during the initial months of therapy and during any periods of upward dosage titration 
of either drug. Periodic creatine phosphokinase (CPK) determinations may be considered in such situations, but 
there is no assurance that such monitoring will prevent the occurrence of severe myopathy. In patients taking 
CADUET, therapy should be temporarily withheld or discontinued in any patient with an acute, serious condition 
suggestive of a myopathy or having a risk factor predisposing to the development of renal failure secondary to 
rhabdomyolysis (e.g., severe acute infection, hypotension, major surgery, trauma, severe metabolic, endocrine 
and electrolyte disorders, and uncontrolled seizures).
PRECAUTIONS: General: Since the vasodilation induced by the amlodipine component of CADUET is gradual in 
onset, acute hypotension has rarely been reported after oral administration of amlodipine. Nonetheless, caution 
should be exercised when administering CADUET as with any other peripheral vasodilator particularly in patients with 
severe aortic stenosis. Before instituting therapy with CADUET, an attempt should be made to control 
hypercholesterolemia with appropriate diet, exercise, and weight reduction in obese patients, and to treat other 
underlying medical problems (see INDICATIONS AND USAGE). Use in Patients with Congestive Heart Failure: In
general, calcium channel blockers should be used with caution in patients with heart failure. The amlodipine 
component of CADUET (5-10 mg per day) has been studied in a placebo-controlled trial of 1153 patients with NYHA 
Class III or IV heart failure on stable doses of ACE inhibitor, digoxin, and diuretics. Follow-up was at least 6 months,
with a mean of about 14 months.There was no overall adverse effect on survival or cardiac morbidity (as deﬁned by
life-threatening arrhythmia, acute myocardial infarction, or hospitalization for worsened heart failure). Amlodipine 
has been compared to placebo in four 8-12 week studies of patients with NYHA class II/III heart failure, involving a 
total of 697 patients. In these studies, there was no evidence of worsened heart failure based on measures of 
exercise tolerance, NYHA classiﬁcation, symptoms, or LVEF. Beta-Blocker Withdrawal: The amlodipine component of 
CADUET is not a beta-blocker and therefore gives no protection against the dangers of abrupt beta-blocker 
withdrawal; any such withdrawal should be by gradual reduction of the dose of beta-blocker. Endocrine Function:
HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors, such as the atorvastatin component of CADUET interfere with cholesterol synthesis 
and theoretically might blunt adrenal and/or gonadal steroid production. Clinical studies have shown that 
atorvastatin does not reduce basal plasma cortisol concentration or impair adrenal reserve.The effects of HMG-CoA 
reductase inhibitors on male fertility have not been studied in adequate numbers of patients. The effects, if any, on 
the pituitary-gonadal axis in premenopausal women are unknown. Caution should be exercised if an HMG-CoA 
reductase inhibitor is administered concomitantly with drugs that may decrease the levels or activity of endogenous 
steroid hormones, such as ketoconazole, spironolactone, and cimetidine. CNS Toxicity: Studies with atorvastatin: 
Brain hemorrhage was seen in a female dog treated with atorvastatin calcium for 3 months at a dose equivalent to 
120 mg atorvastatin/kg/day. Brain hemorrhage and optic nerve vacuolation were seen in another female dog that 
was sacriﬁced in moribund condition after 11 weeks of escalating doses of atorvastatin calcium equivalent to up to 
280 mg atorvastatin/kg/day.The 120 mg/kg dose of atorvastatin resulted in a systemic exposure approximately 16 
times the human plasma area-under-the-curve (AUC, 0-24 hours) based on the maximum human dose of 80 mg/
day. A single tonic convulsion was seen in each of 2 male dogs (one treated with atorvastatin calcium at a dose 
equivalent to 10 mg atorvastatin/kg/day and one at a dose equivalent to 120 mg atorvastatin/kg/day) in a 2-year 
study. No CNS lesions have been observed in mice after chronic treatment for up to 2 years at doses of atorvastatin 
calcium equivalent to up to 400 mg atorvastatin/kg/day or in rats at doses equivalent to up to 100 mg atorvastatin/
kg/day. These doses were 6 to 11 times (mouse) and 8 to 16 times (rat) the human AUC (0-24) based on the 
maximum recommended human dose of 80 mg atorvastatin/day.CNS vascular lesions,characterized by perivascular 
hemorrhages, edema, and mononuclear cell inﬁltration of perivascular spaces, have been observed in dogs treated 
with other members of the HMG-CoA reductase class. A chemically similar drug in this class produced optic nerve 
degeneration (Wallerian degeneration of retinogeniculate ﬁbers) in clinically normal dogs in a dose-dependent 
fashion at a dose that produced plasma drug levels about 30 times higher than the mean drug level in humans 
taking the highest recommended dose. Information for Patients: Due to the risk of myopathy with drugs of the 
HMG-CoA reductase class, to which the atorvastatin component of CADUET belongs, patients should be advised to 
report promptly unexplained muscle pain, tenderness, or weakness, particularly if accompanied by malaise or fever.
Drug Interactions: Data from a drug-drug interaction study involving 10 mg of amlodipine and 80 mg of atorvastatin 
in healthy subjects indicate that the pharmacokinetics of amlodipine are not altered when the drugs are 
coadministered. The effect of amlodipine on the pharmacokinetics of atorvastatin showed no effect on the Cmax: 
91% (90% conﬁdence interval: 80 to 103%), but the AUC of atorvastatin increased by 18% (90% conﬁdence 
interval: 109 to 127%) in the presence of amlodipine. No drug interaction studies have been conducted with 
CADUET and other drugs, although studies have been conducted in the individual amlodipine and atorvastatin 
components, as described below: Studies with Amlodipine: In vitro data in human plasma indicate that amlodipine 
has no effect on the protein binding of drugs tested (digoxin, phenytoin, warfarin, and indomethacin). Cimetidine: 
Co-administration of amlodipine with cimetidine did not alter the pharmacokinetics of amlodipine. Maalox® 
(antacid): Co-administration of the antacid Maalox with a single dose of amlodipine had no signiﬁcant effect on the 
pharmacokinetics of amlodipine. Sildenaﬁl: A single 100 mg dose of sildenaﬁl (Viagra®) in subjects with essential 
hypertension had no effect on the pharmacokinetic parameters of amlodipine.When amlodipine and sildenaﬁl were 
used in combination, each agent independently exerted its own blood pressure lowering effect. Digoxin: Co-
administration of amlodipine with digoxin did not change serum digoxin levels or digoxin renal clearance in normal 
volunteers. Ethanol (alcohol): Single and multiple 10 mg doses of amlodipine had no signiﬁcant effect on the 
pharmacokinetics of ethanol. Warfarin: Co-administration of amlodipine with warfarin did not change the warfarin 
prothrombin response time. In clinical trials, amlodipine has been safely administered with thiazide diuretics,
beta-blockers, angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, long-acting nitrates, sublingual nitroglycerin, digoxin,
warfarin,non-steroidal anti-inﬂammatory drugs,antibiotics,and oral hypoglycemic drugs.Studies with Atorvastatin:
The risk of myopathy during treatment with drugs of the HMG-CoA reductase class is increased with concurrent 
administration of cyclosporine, ﬁbric acid derivatives, niacin (nicotinic acid), erythromycin, or azole antifungals (see 
WARNINGS, Skeletal Muscle).Antacid: When atorvastatin and Maalox TC suspension were coadministered, plasma 
concentrations of atorvastatin decreased approximately 35%. However, LDL-C reduction was not altered.Antipyrine: 
Because atorvastatin does not affect the pharmacokinetics of antipyrine, interactions with other drugs metabolized 
via the same cytochrome isozymes are not expected. Colestipol: Plasma concentrations of atorvastatin decreased 
approximately 25% when colestipol and atorvastatin were coadministered. However, LDL-C reduction was greater 
when atorvastatin and colestipol were coadministered than when either drug was given alone. Cimetidine: 
Atorvastatin plasma concentrations and LDL-C reduction were not altered by coadministration of cimetidine. Digoxin: 
When multiple doses of atorvastatin and digoxin were coadministered, steady-state plasma digoxin concentrations 
increased by approximately 20%.Patients taking digoxin should be monitored appropriately. Erythromycin: In healthy 
individuals, plasma concentrations of atorvastatin increased approximately 40% with coadministration of 
atorvastatin and erythromycin, a known inhibitor of cytochrome P450 3A4 (see WARNINGS, Skeletal Muscle).Oral
Contraceptives: Coadministration of atorvastatin and an oral contraceptive increased AUC values for norethindrone 
and ethinyl estradiol by approximately 30% and 20%.These increases should be considered when selecting an oral 
contraceptive for a woman taking CADUET. Warfarin: Atorvastatin had no clinically signiﬁcant effect on prothrombin 
time when administered to patients receiving chronic warfarin treatment. Drug/Laboratory Test Interactions: None
known. Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, Impairment of Fertility: Studies with amlodipine: Rats and mice treated 
with amlodipine maleate in the diet for up to two years, at concentrations calculated to provide daily dosage levels 
of 0.5, 1.25, and 2.5 mg amlodipine/kg/day, showed no evidence of a carcinogenic effect of the drug. For the 
mouse, the highest dose was, on a mg/m2 basis, similar to the maximum recommended human dose of 10 mg 
amlodipine/day*.For the rat,the highest dose level was,on a mg/m2 basis,about twice the maximum recommended 
human dose*. Mutagenicity studies conducted with amlodipine maleate revealed no drug related effects at either 
the gene or chromosome levels. There was no effect on the fertility of rats treated orally with amlodipine maleate 
(males for 64 days and females for 14 days prior to mating) at doses up to 10 mg amlodipine/kg/day (8 times* 
the maximum recommended human dose of 10 mg/day on a mg/m2 basis). Studies with atorvastatin: In a 2-year 
carcinogenicity study with atorvastatin calcium in rats at dose levels equivalent to 10, 30, and 100 mg atorvastatin/
kg/day, 2 rare tumors were found in muscle in high-dose females: in one, there was a rhabdomyosarcoma and, in 
another, there was a ﬁbrosarcoma. This dose represents a plasma AUC (0-24) value of approximately 16 times the 
mean human plasma drug exposure after an 80 mg oral dose. A 2-year carcinogenicity study in mice given 
atorvastatin calcium at dose levels equivalent to 100,200,and 400 mg atorvastatin/kg/day resulted in a signiﬁcant 
increase in liver adenomas in high-dose males and liver carcinomas in high-dose females. These ﬁndings occurred 
at plasma AUC (0-24) values of approximately 6 times the mean human plasma drug exposure after an 80 mg oral 


dose. In vitro, atorvastatin was not mutagenic or clastogenic in the following tests with and without metabolic 
activation: the Ames test with Salmonella typhimurium and Escherichia coli, the HGPRT forward mutation assay in 
Chinese hamster lung cells, and the chromosomal aberration assay in Chinese hamster lung cells.Atorvastatin was 
negative in the in vivo mouse micronucleus test. There were no effects on fertility when rats were given atorvastatin 
calcium at doses equivalent to up to 175 mg atorvastatin/kg/day (15 times the human exposure). There was 
aplasia and aspermia in the epididymides of 2 of 10 rats treated with atorvastatin calcium at a dose equivalent to 
100 mg atorvastatin/kg/day for 3 months (16 times the human AUC at the 80 mg dose); testis weights were 
signiﬁcantly lower at 30 and 100 mg/kg/day and epididymal weight was lower at 100 mg/kg/day. Male rats given 
the equivalent of 100 mg atorvastatin/kg/day for 11 weeks prior to mating had decreased sperm motility, spermatid 
head concentration, and increased abnormal sperm.Atorvastatin caused no adverse effects on semen parameters,
or reproductive organ histopathology in dogs given doses of atorvastatin calcium equivalent to 10, 40, or 120 mg 
atorvastatin/kg/day for two years. Pregnancy: Pregnancy Category X (see CONTRAINDICATIONS): Safety in 
pregnant women has not been established with CADUET. CADUET should be administered to women of child-bearing 
potential only when such patients are highly unlikely to conceive and have been informed of the potential hazards.
If the woman becomes pregnant while taking CADUET, it should be discontinued and the patient advised again as 
to the potential hazards to the fetus. Studies with amlodipine: No evidence of teratogenicity or other embryo/fetal 
toxicity was found when pregnant rats and rabbits were treated orally with amlodipine maleate at doses up to 10 mg 
amlodipine/kg/day (respectively 8 times* and 23 times* the maximum recommended human dose of 10 mg/day 
on a mg/m2 basis) during their respective periods of major organogenesis. However, litter size was signiﬁcantly 
decreased (by about 50%) and the number of intrauterine deaths was signiﬁcantly increased (about 5-fold) in rats 
receiving amlodipine maleate at 10 mg amlodipine/kg/day for 14 days before mating and throughout mating and 
gestation.Amlodipine maleate has been shown to prolong both the gestation period and the duration of labor in rats 
at this dose. There are no adequate and well-controlled studies in pregnant women. Studies with atorvastatin:
Atorvastatin crosses the rat placenta and reaches a level in fetal liver equivalent to that of maternal plasma.
Atorvastatin was not teratogenic in rats at doses of atorvastatin calcium equivalent to up to 300 mg atorvastatin/
kg/day or in rabbits at doses of atorvastatin calcium equivalent to up to 100 mg atorvastatin/kg/day. These doses 
resulted in multiples of about 30 times (rat) or 20 times (rabbit) the human exposure based on surface area (mg/
m2). In a study in rats given atorvastatin calcium at doses equivalent to 20, 100, or 225 mg atorvastatin/kg/day,
from gestation day 7 through to lactation day 21 (weaning), there was decreased pup survival at birth, neonate,
weaning, and maturity for pups of mothers dosed with 225 mg/kg/day. Body weight was decreased on days 4 and 
21 for pups of mothers dosed at 100 mg/kg/day; pup body weight was decreased at birth and at days 4, 21, and 
91 at 225 mg/kg/day. Pup development was delayed (rotorod performance at 100 mg/kg/day and acoustic startle 
at 225 mg/kg/day; pinnae detachment and eye opening at 225 mg/kg/day). These doses of atorvastatin 
correspond to 6 times (100 mg/kg) and 22 times (225 mg/kg) the human AUC at 80 mg/day. Rare reports of 
congenital anomalies have been received following intrauterine exposure to HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors. There 
has been one report of severe congenital bony deformity, tracheo-esophageal ﬁstula, and anal atresia (VATER 
association) in a baby born to a woman who took lovastatin with dextroamphetamine sulfate during the ﬁrst 
trimester of pregnancy. Labor and Delivery: No studies have been conducted in pregnant women on the effect of 
CADUET, amlodipine or atorvastatin on the mother or the fetus during labor or delivery, or on the duration of labor or 
delivery. Amlodipine has been shown to prolong the duration of labor in rats. Nursing Mothers: It is not known 
whether the amlodipine component of CADUET is excreted in human milk. Nursing rat pups taking atorvastatin had 
plasma and liver drug levels of 50% and 40%, respectively, of that in their mother’s milk. Because of the potential 
for adverse reactions in nursing infants, women taking CADUET should not breast-feed (see CONTRAINDICATIONS).
Pediatric Use: There have been no studies conducted to determine the safety or effectiveness of CADUET in 
pediatric populations. Studies with amlodipine: The effect of amlodipine on blood pressure in patients less than 6 
years of age is not known. Studies with atorvastatin: Safety and effectiveness in patients 10-17 years of age with 
heterozygous familial hypercholesterolemia have been evaluated in controlled clinical trials of 6 months duration in 
adolescent boys and postmenarchal girls. Patients treated with atorvastatin had an adverse experience proﬁle 
generally similar to that of patients treated with placebo, the most common adverse experiences observed in both 
groups, regardless of causality assessment, were infections. Doses greater than 20 mg have not been studied in 
this patient population. In this limited controlled study, there was no detectable effect on growth or sexual 
maturation in boys or on menstrual cycle length in girls. See ADVERSE REACTIONS, Pediatric Patients. Adolescent 
females should be counseled on appropriate contraceptive methods while on atorvastatin therapy (see 
CONTRAINDICATIONS and PRECAUTIONS, Pregnancy). Atorvastatin has not been studied in controlled clinical 
trials involving pre-pubertal patients or patients younger than 10 years of age. Clinical efﬁcacy with doses of 
atorvastatin up to 80 mg/day for 1 year have been evaluated in an uncontrolled study of patients with homozygous 
FH including 8 pediatric patients. Geriatric Use: There have been no studies conducted to determine the safety or 
effectiveness of CADUET in geriatric populations. In studies with amlodipine: Clinical studies of amlodipine did not 
include sufﬁcient numbers of subjects aged 65 and over to determine whether they respond differently from younger 
subjects. Other reported clinical experience has not identiﬁed differences in responses between the elderly and 
younger patients. In general, dose selection of the amlodipine component of CADUET for an elderly patient should 
be cautious, usually starting at the low end of the dosing range, reﬂecting the greater frequency of decreased 
hepatic,renal,or cardiac function,and of concomitant disease or other drug therapy.Elderly patients have decreased 
clearance of amlodipine with a resulting increase of AUC of approximately 40-60%, and a lower initial dose may be 
required. In studies with atorvastatin: The safety and efﬁcacy of atorvastatin (10-80 mg) in the geriatric population 
(65 years of age) was evaluated in the ACCESS study. In this 54-week open-label trial 1,958 patients initiated 
therapy with atorvastatin calcium 10 mg. Of these, 835 were elderly (65 years) and 1,123 were non-elderly. The 
mean change in LDL-C from baseline after 6 weeks of treatment with atorvastatin calcium 10 mg was –38.2% in the 
elderly patients versus –34.6% in the non-elderly group.The rates of discontinuation in patients on atorvastatin due 
to adverse events were similar between the two age groups.There were no differences in clinically relevant laboratory 
abnormalities between the age groups. ADVERSE REACTIONS: CADUET: CADUET (amlodipine besylate/atorvastatin 
calcium) has been evaluated for safety in 1092 patients in double-blind placebo controlled studies treated for co-
morbid hypertension and dyslipidemia. In general, treatment with CADUET was well tolerated. For the most part,
adverse experiences have been mild or moderate in severity. In clinical trials with CADUET, no adverse experiences 
peculiar to this combination have been observed. Adverse experiences are similar in terms of nature, severity, and 
frequency to those reported previously with amlodipine and atorvastatin. The following information is based on the 
clinical experience with amlodipine and atorvastatin. The Amlodipine Component of CADUET: Amlodipine has been 
evaluated for safety in more than 11,000 patients in U.S. and foreign clinical trials. In general, treatment with 
amlodipine was well tolerated at doses up to 10 mg daily. Most adverse reactions reported during therapy with 
amlodipine were of mild or moderate severity. In controlled clinical trials directly comparing amlodipine (N=1730) 
in doses up to 10 mg to placebo (N=1250), discontinuation of amlodipine due to adverse reactions was required in 
only about 1.5% of patients and was not signiﬁcantly different from placebo (about 1%).The most common side effects 
are headache and edema. The incidence (%) of side effects which occurred in a dose related manner are as follows:

The following events occurred in 1% but >0.1% of patients treated with amlodipine in controlled clinical trials or 
under conditions of open trials or marketing experience where a causal relationship is uncertain; they are listed 
to alert the physician to a possible relationship: Cardiovascular: arrhythmia (including ventricular tachycardia 
and atrial ﬁbrillation), bradycardia, chest pain, hypotension, peripheral ischemia, syncope, tachycardia, postural 
dizziness, postural hypotension, vasculitis. Central and Peripheral Nervous System: hypoesthesia, neuropathy 
peripheral, paresthesia, tremor, vertigo. Gastrointestinal: anorexia, constipation, dyspepsia,** dysphagia,
diarrhea, ﬂatulence, pancreatitis, vomiting, gingival hyperplasia. General: allergic reaction, asthenia,** back pain,
hot ﬂushes, malaise, pain, rigors, weight gain, weight decrease. Musculoskeletal System: arthralgia, arthrosis,
muscle cramps,** myalgia. Psychiatric: sexual dysfunction (male** and female), insomnia, nervousness,
depression, abnormal dreams, anxiety, depersonalization. Respiratory System: dyspnea,** epistaxis. Skin and 
Appendages: angioedema, erythema multiforme, pruritus,** rash,** rash erythematous, rash maculopapular.
Special Senses: abnormal vision, conjunctivitis, diplopia, eye pain, tinnitus. Urinary System: micturition frequency,
micturition disorder, nocturia. Autonomic Nervous System: dry mouth, sweating increased. Metabolic and 
Nutritional: hyperglycemia, thirst. Hemopoietic: leukopenia, purpura, thrombocytopenia. The following events 
occurred in 0.1% of patients treated with amlodipine in controlled clinical trials or under conditions of open 
trials or marketing experience: cardiac failure, pulse irregularity, extrasystoles, skin discoloration, urticaria, skin 
dryness, alopecia, dermatitis, muscle weakness, twitching, ataxia, hypertonia, migraine, cold and clammy skin,
apathy, agitation, amnesia, gastritis, increased appetite, loose stools, coughing, rhinitis, dysuria, polyuria, parosmia,
taste perversion, abnormal visual accommodation, and xerophthalmia. Other reactions occurred sporadically and 
cannot be distinguished from medications or concurrent disease states such as myocardial infarction and angina.
Amlodipine therapy has not been associated with clinically signiﬁcant changes in routine laboratory tests. No 
clinically relevant changes were noted in serum potassium, serum glucose, total triglycerides, total cholesterol, HDL 
cholesterol, uric acid, blood urea nitrogen, or creatinine. In the CAMELOT and PREVENT studies the adverse event 
proﬁle was similar to that reported previously (see above), with the most common adverse event being peripheral 
edema. The following postmarketing event has been reported infrequently with amlodipine treatment where a causal 
relationship is uncertain: gynecomastia. In postmarketing experience, jaundice and hepatic enzyme elevations 
(mostly consistent with cholestasis or hepatitis) in some cases severe enough to require hospitalization have been 
reported in association with use of amlodipine.Amlodipine has been used safely in patients with chronic obstructive 
pulmonary disease, well-compensated congestive heart failure, peripheral vascular disease, diabetes mellitus, and 
abnormal lipid proﬁles. The Atorvastatin Component of CADUET: Atorvastatin is generally well-tolerated. Adverse 
reactions have usually been mild and transient. In controlled clinical studies of 2502 patients, <2% of patients were 
discontinued due to adverse experiences attributable to atorvastatin calcium. The most frequent adverse events 
thought to be related to atorvastatin calcium were constipation, ﬂatulence, dyspepsia, and abdominal pain. Clinical
Adverse Experiences: Adverse experiences reported in <2% of patients in placebo-controlled clinical studies of 
atorvastatin, regardless of causality assessment, are shown in Table 3.

Anglo-Scandinavian Cardiac Outcomes Trial (ASCOT): In ASCOT involving 10,305 participants treated with 
atorvastatin 10 mg daily (n=5,168) or placebo (n=5,137), the safety and tolerability proﬁle of the group treated 
with atorvastatin was comparable to that of the group treated with placebo during a median of 3.3 years of follow-
up. Collaborative Atorvastatin Diabetes Study (CARDS): In CARDS involving 2838 subjects with type 2 diabetes 
treated with LIPITOR 10 mg daily (n=1428) or placebo (n=1410), there was no difference in the overall frequency 
of adverse events or serious adverse events between the treatment groups during a median follow-up of 3.9 years.
No cases of rhabdomyolysis were reported. The following adverse events were reported, regardless of causality 
assessment, in patients treated with atorvastatin in clinical trials. The events in italics occurred in 2% of patients 
and the events in plain type occurred in <2% of patients. Body as a Whole: Chest pain, face edema, fever, neck

Lymphatic System: Ecchymosis, anemia, lymphadenopathy, thrombocytopenia, petechia. Postintroduction Reports 
with Atorvastatin: Adverse events associated with atorvastatin therapy reported since market introduction, that 
are not listed above, regardless of causality assessment, include the following: anaphylaxis, angioneurotic edema,
bullous rashes (including erythema multiforme, Stevens-Johnson syndrome, and toxic epidermal necrolysis),
rhabdomyolysis, and fatigue. Pediatric Patients (ages 10-17 years): In a 26-week controlled study in boys and 
postmenarchal girls (n=140), the safety and tolerability proﬁle of atorvastatin 10 to 20 mg daily was generally 
similar to that of placebo (see PRECAUTIONS, Pediatric Use).
OVERDOSAGE: There is no information on overdosage with CADUET in humans. Information on Amlodipine: Single
oral doses of amlodipine maleate equivalent to 40 mg amlodipine/kg and 100 mg amlodipine/kg in mice and rats,
respectively, caused deaths. Single oral amlodipine maleate doses equivalent to 4 or more mg amlodipine/kg in 
dogs (11 or more times the maximum recommended clinical dose on a mg/m2 basis) caused a marked peripheral 
vasodilation and hypotension.Overdosage might be expected to cause excessive peripheral vasodilation with marked 
hypotension and possibly a reﬂex tachycardia. In humans, experience with intentional overdosage of amlodipine is 
limited. Reports of intentional overdosage include a patient who ingested 250 mg and was asymptomatic and 
was not hospitalized; another (120 mg) was hospitalized, underwent gastric lavage and remained normotensive; 
the third (105 mg) was hospitalized and had hypotension (90/50 mmHg) which normalized following plasma 
expansion. A patient who took 70 mg amlodipine and an unknown quantity of benzodiazepine in a suicide attempt 
developed shock which was refractory to treatment and died the following day with abnormally high benzodiazepine 
plasma concentration. A case of accidental drug overdose has been documented in a 19-month-old male who 
ingested 30 mg amlodipine (about 2 mg/kg). During the emergency room presentation, vital signs were stable with 
no evidence of hypotension, but a heart rate of 180 bpm. Ipecac was administered 3.5 hours after ingestion and 
on subsequent observation (overnight) no sequelae were noted. If massive overdose should occur, active cardiac 
and respiratory monitoring should be instituted. Frequent blood pressure measurements are essential. Should 
hypotension occur, cardiovascular support including elevation of the extremities and the judicious administration 
of ﬂuids should be initiated. If hypotension remains unresponsive to these conservative measures, administration 
of vasopressors (such as phenylephrine) should be considered with attention to circulating volume and urine 
output. Intravenous calcium gluconate may help to reverse the effects of calcium entry blockade. As amlodipine is 
highly protein bound, hemodialysis is not likely to be of beneﬁt. Information on Atorvastatin: There is no speciﬁc 
treatment for atorvastatin overdosage. In the event of an overdose, the patient should be treated symptomatically,
and supportive measures instituted as required. Due to extensive drug binding to plasma proteins, hemodialysis is 
not expected to signiﬁcantly enhance atorvastatin clearance.
*Based on patient weight of 50 kg.
**These events occurred in less than 1% in placebo-controlled trials, but the incidence of these side effects was 
between 1% and 2% in all multiple dose studies.

One Victory Path
for Joe Lieberman
He lost his primary to
Democrat Ned Lamont, but
Washington’s buzzing about
how Sen. Joe Lieberman can
win as an independent. The
secret: Bush and Jewish vot-
ers. The Bush angle: White
House officials believe that
30 percent to 40 percent of
Constitution State gop-ers
will back Joe because he’s
stuck with Bush on the war
and also since the adminis-
tration isn’t backing the 
Republican in the race. 
The Jewish angle: Some
Jewish leaders are miffed
that many Democrats 
angry with Bush aban-
doned Lieberman, a 
devout Jew who’s a huge
supporter of Israel.
More Ben Bradlee
Than Hemingway
It’s obvious sometimes that
President Bush has, well,
trouble with words. And
that makes him a tough edi-
tor, says his former speech-
writer. Mike Gerson reveals
that the prez is “actually a
good, aggressive editor” who
demands active speech and
little back and forth.
Speeches, says Gerson,
“have to go from one point
forward.” Bush also likes his
big speeches prepared early.
“He wants an early outline,”
says Gerson. “He wants to
give it some thought.” And
practice. Bush likes to read
and reread teleprompter
speeches “just for how
things sound in the ear.” l
“First it was Jews, then it 
was Koreans, and now it’s 
Arabs; very few black people
own these stores.”
Andrew Young, former United Nations ambassador and civil
rights leader, speaking on why Wal-Mart should displace
neighborhood stores, comments he subsequently apologized for
“It took a lot of pages to write 
that bill.”
President Bush, signing the pension reform bill into law
“If you strip away their power, all
you’ve got is a bunch of fat old
men with white hair who look like
Newt Gingrich and Baby Huey.”
Nancy Cunningham, estranged wife of ex-Rep. Duke Cunningham,
convicted in the lobbyist affair, decrying the GOP leadership
“For me, there were zero
expectations coming in. For  
Katie, it’s about 1,000.”

S
enate Democrats are
planning to use the up-
coming anniversaries of
the 9/11 attacks and Hurri-
cane Katrina to argue that
President Bush and the gop
Congress have not done
enough to protect Americans
from terrorism and other
threats. On August 24, Senate
Minority Leader Harry Reid
plans to appear in New Or-
leans to decry the federal gov-
ernment’s response to Katri-
na, and soon after Labor Day
the Democrats will stage
events charging Republicans
with leaving the country vul-
nerable to terrorist attacks by,
among other things, not im-
plementing many recommen-
dations of the 9/11 commis-
sion. The White House,
however, has its own plans.
Bush will visit the Gulf region
next week to make his post-Katrina case, and he is expected to
use the 9/11 anniversary to recommit himself to fighting ter-
rorists and, linked to that, the war in Iraq. 
Lieberman: Friends in Unexpected Places
V
ets for Freedom, a new group whose members saw duty
in Iraq and Afghanistan, believes it has helped put inde-
pendent Connecticut Senate candidate Sen. Joe Lieberman
back in the lead after his primary loss to Ned Lamont over
the war issue. The group ran an ad in the Hartford Courant.
Headlined “Thank you Senator Lieberman,” it featured an
Iraq war vet praising the senator for standing by the troops.
After it ran, vets phoned and E-mailed pledges of support,
and about that time Lieberman took a big lead over Lamont
in state polls. Now the group will most likely focus on other
races where support for the war is an issue. “We think
there’s a resonance for this message nationally,” said Vets
spokesman Dan Senor, a former White House aide.
Terror Plot Foiled, Bush Bump Fizzles
W
hite House strategists are disappointed that the arrest
of alleged terrorist plotters in the United Kingdom
hasn’t increased President Bush’s job-approval ratings very
much. The expectation was that Bush might benefit from
It’s Hardball
Season, 
So Nothing 
Is Sacred
the arrests as evidence that his tough approach to fighting
terrorism, in cooperation with U.S. allies, was paying off.
But while those polled see Bush as a strong leader in fight-
ing terrorism, they have not raised his overall job perfor-
mance rating. “We need a sustained period of good news to
boost the numbers,” says a key Republican strategist.
Big Surprise: Iraqis in a Foul Mood
T
he unrelenting violence and chaos of Iraq have taken their
toll on the people there, according to a new study of Iraqi
public opinion. Based on surveys in 2004 and 2006, it found
increased feelings of powerlessness, insecurity, pessimism,
and a striking level of distrust of U.S. intentions among all
three of Iraq’s major ethnic and religious groups. The most re-
cent survey, done in April, asked for “the three main reasons
for the U.S. invasion of Iraq.” Less than 2 percent chose “to
bring democracy to Iraq” as their first choice. “To control Iraqi
oil” was picked by 76 percent, followed by “to build military
bases” (41 percent) and “to help Israel” (32 percent). The good
news: The surveys found a rise in support for secular politics.
The project was sponsored by the National Science Founda-
tion and conducted by three professors in Michigan. l

A Suspect Suspect
in JonBenet’s Killing
T
he haunting images of
the child beauty queen
stoked a seemingly insa-
tiable tabloid interest in
who strangled 6-year-old
JonBenet Ramsey in Boulder,
Colo., a decade ago. For a
while, speculation centered
on the little girl’s parents,
John and Patsy Ramsey,
who denied involvement
and insisted an intruder was
responsible (Patsy Ramsey
died of cancer in June). No
one was ever charged in the
case, and some experts said
the investigation was han-
dled so incompetently that
no one ever would be.
All that changed—or did
it?—when John Mark Karr,
41, a former American
schoolteacher, was arrested
for the crime in Bangkok.
Karr admitted he was with
JonBenet when she died but
said her death was an acci-
dent; a Thai official claimed
Karr said the murder oc-
curred during a kidnap at-
tempt that went awry. By
week’s end, though, legal ex-
perts were questioning as-
pects of Karr’s story and
wondering aloud whether
he really had anything to do
with the crime. Boulder
County District Attorney
Mary Lacy warned against a
“rush to judgment.” 
Terror Jitters Over
Cellphones
T
errorists? Scam artists?
Innocent victims of pro-
filing? It was hard to know
what to make of the recent
arrests in the Midwest. Two
Arab men in Marietta, Ohio,
and three in Caro, Mich., were
initially charged with sup-
porting terrorism, after they
were found to have pur-
chased hundreds of cell-
phones. County prosecutors
in Michigan dropped the ter-
rorism charges last week,
though federal prosecutors
in Bay City, Mich., have
charged the three men there
with fraud. The two nabbed
in Ohio still face charges of
lying to police. The fbi had
warned police to watch for
large purchases of prepaid
cellphones, which authori-
ties worry could be resold to
fund terrorists. Additionally,
the two men arrested in
Ohio were found with
airline passenger lists and

week transferring the cross,
part of a war memorial, to

Philip Paulson, an atheist
and Vietnam veteran, con-
tends the cross illegally pro-
motes Christianity. But in a
ballot measure in July last
year, voters overwhelmingly
backed protecting the cross
by donating it to the federal
government, which has been
less strict about religious
displays than California.
Courts have consistently

Keystone State
Immigration Spat
H
ispanic activists in 
Hazleton, Pa., struck back
at city leaders who recently
passed one of the nation’s
toughest local immigration
laws. Joined by the Ameri-
can Civil Liberties Union,
the activists sued the
31,000-person town 80
miles northwest of Philadel-
phia, arguing that the ordi-
nance is discriminatory and
unworkable; only the feder-
al government, they say, has
the constitutional power to
regulate immigration. In
July, Hazleton’s City Coun-
cil voted to make English
the official language, reject
business permits for compa-
nies that employ illegal im-
migrants, and fine landlords
for renting to them. As Con-
gress struggles with immi-
gration reform, cities are
taking immigration into
their own hands. Since 
Hazleton’s ordinance was
approved, cities like Valley
Park, Mo., and Escondido,
Calif., have passed similar
laws. As for Hazleton,
Mayor Louis Barletta says
he’ll fight the activists 
in court.

banning them altogether—
the latest casualty not in the
war on terror but in the bat-
tle of the (childhood) bulge. 
A new state law bans the
fry (as well as whole milk,
candy bars, and soda pop),
so schools want to develop
an alternative. Chefs for the
Mesa, Ariz., public schools
spent the summer devising
low-fat substitutes includ-
ing potato wedges and
sticks that are baked, not
fried. The state’s law does
not extend to high schools,
where cafeterias still have
the freedom to fry. l

Tallying Up Another
Month of Mayhem
I
raq’s numbingly high level
of violence continued un-
abated last week, spreading
out well beyond the capital
to several key Iraqi cities.
Car bombings in Baghdad
killed dozens despite a larg-
er presence of U.S. and Iraqi
security forces, while groups
of armed men clashed with
Iraqi forces in the northern
city of Mosul as well as the
Shiite strongholds of Kar-
bala and Basra in the south.
Some 3,500 Iraqis died in
sectarian or political vio-
lence throughout the coun-
try in the month of July, ac-
cording to Deputy Health
Minister Adel Muhsin.
Around half the month’s toll
occurred outside Baghdad.
But even as sectarian vio-
lence continued to spark
concerns that Iraq is on a
course toward civil war,
there were unsettling re-
minders that the Sunni-led
insurgency remains as
strong as ever. While deaths
of U.S. troops declined
slightly last month, injuries
were notably higher. And
insurgents planted a record
number of roadside bombs
last month, according to a
U.S. military tally first re-
gents could find themselves
with more room to operate.
The Land of the
Opium Poppies
T
he good news is that one
part of Afghanistan’s econo-
my is booming. The bad
news: It’s the opium busi-
ness, which, by United Na-
tions estimates, accounts for
more than half the nation’s
ported by the New York
Times. Some 2,625 bombs
exploded or were discovered
before they could detonate
in July, up from 1,454 in
January. More than two
thirds were directed at U.S.
troops. This spike has led to
a deeper concern: As the

forts. Afghanistan last year

The opium trade is a matter
of economic survival for
many Afghan farmers and a
lucrative source of money for
the Taliban, warlords, and
smugglers. The Afghan gov-
ernment is promising a new
phase for its war on drugs,
but officials worry that in-
creasing poppy eradication
programs—especially in the
absence of economic alterna-
tives—will add fuel to the al-
ready deadly insurgency.
Countdown to an
Iran Showdown 
W
ith the Lebanon conflict
winding down, look for
the crisis spotlight to shift to
Iran, which is facing a U.N.
Security Council deadline of
August 31 to halt its uranium
enrichment activities, a key
part of a suspected nuclear
weapons program. Iranian
President Mahmoud Ah-
madinejad, who has repeat-
edly vowed to resist that de-
mand, has promised to give
Tehran’s formal response on
August 22 to a European
offer of economic incentives
if Tehran curtails its nuclear
program. Unless Iran caves
by the end of the month, the
Bush administration plans to
quickly seek imposition of
U.N. sanctions on Iran.
New Money for
India’s Health 
R
elations between the gov-
ernment of India and the
World Bank have been quite
frigid recently. The reason:
More than a year ago, the
bank’s president, Paul Wolfo-
witz, put a hold on nearly
$800 million in new loans for
health projects in India after
bank investigators uncovered
widespread fraud in a pro-
gram aimed at reducing mor-
tality and disease in women
and children. Now, it appears
that relations are starting to
thaw. Bank and Indian offi-
cials have hammered out pro-
curement reforms that they
believe will protect against
future fraud in health proj-
ects. As a result, the bank’s
executive board is expected to
approve funding for the
health projects this week.
Wolfowitz and bank investi-
gators have signed off on the
new plan. “We have agreed to
a new procurement plan,’’
says one senior bank official,
“that will safeguard the
bank’s money.’’ The bank,
based in Washington, is the
largest and most influential
antipoverty institution oper-
ating in developing countries.
In 2005, India borrowed
nearly $3 billion, making it
the bank’s largest customer
that year.

aybe it was the in-
fluence of his wife,
Laura, a former li-
brarian, or his moth-
er, Barbara, a long-
time promoter of
literacy. Or perhaps
he was just eager to dispel his
image as an intellectual light-
weight. But President Bush now
wants it known that he is a man of
letters. In fact, Bush has entered a
book-reading competition with
Karl Rove, his political adviser.
White House aides say the presi-
dent has read 60 books so far this
year (while the brainy Rove, to
Bush’s competitive delight, has
racked up only 50). The comman-
der in chief delved into three vol-
umes in August alone—two on
Abraham Lincoln and, more sur-
prising for a man of unambiguous
convictions, The Stranger, Albert
Camus’s existential tale of murder
and alienation (story, Page 38).
Bush’s critics aren’t buying. A
man who so regularly mangles
the English language and seems
to disdain complexity couldn’t
possibly be so cerebral, they
argue. But portraying Bush as a
voracious reader is part of an on-
going White House campaign to
restore what a senior adviser calls
“gravitas” to the Bush persona.
He certainly needs something.
Only about 34 percent of Ameri-
cans approve of his job perfor-
mance—and 58 percent say Bush
“seems in over his head,” according to
Democratic pollster Stan Greenberg. If
nothing changes, the president could be
a major liability for Republicans in No-
vember’s congressional elections.
Changing these perceptions won’t be
easy. “A president’s image is pretty much
set after a few years in office, and it will
be very difficult [for Bush] to quickly re-
verse that image with the public,” says
political historian Julian Zelizer of
Boston University. “It’s a cynical age and
a cynical country, and it’s a savvy public.”

of setbacks,

But the White House is giving it a try.
Last week provided a glimpse of Bush’s
new “gravitas campaign”—and illustrat-
ed why his presidency has been hum-
bled—if not in spirit, then in Bush’s
grudging acknowledgment of his current
limitations. The latest blow came when
a federal judge in Detroit declared
Bush’s warrantless eavesdropping pro-
gram unconstitutional (box, Page 38).
More broadly, Bush has been forced to
come to terms with reluctant allies
abroad, continuing bad news from Iraq
and Afghanistan, a protracted crisis in
Lebanon, looming showdowns with Iran
and North Korea, and, at home, a balky
Congress and a disapproving electorate.
Stepping up. So Bush is changing the
way he does business. He returned to
Washington from an August vacation at
his Texas ranch after only 10 days, in
contrast to the five weeks he spent in
Crawford a year ago. His public pace
seemed especially frenetic—featuring
high-profile meetings to discuss the Iraq
war on Monday, sessions to discuss
homeland security Tuesday, a visit to 
a motorcycle plant in Pennsylvania

A HUMBLED


President Bush will go right to the
heart of the issue. He’ll ask you
the difficult question, the one
question you didn’t come up with
an answer for.”
As an example of the president’s
behind-the-scenes engagement,
White House aides cite Bush’s role
in protecting a massive system of
reefs in the northwestern Hawai-
ian Islands from overfishing and
pollution two months ago. Bush,
whose interest was initially piqued
because he is a recreational fish-
erman, closely followed the poli-
cymaking process in the executive
branch until he was satisfied that
he knew exactly why and how the
vast undersea tract should be pro-
tected. He even sat in the White
House family theater with his wife
and watched a film, Voyage to
Kure, by Jean-Michel Cousteau,
son of famed undersea explorer
Jacques Cousteau, showing the
natural wonders of the reef. He
told aides he wanted to “get it done
big” and “get it done right.”
But rather than submit the issue
to Congress, he asked advisers, in-
cluding environmental counselor
James Connaughton, if he could
use his authority under the An-
tiquities Act to unilaterally protect
the area by declaring it a nation-
al monument. Told this would be
legal and that there was a consen-
sus among interested parties, in-
cluding state officials, he moved
ahead. On June 15, Bush created
the 140,000-square-mile North-
western Hawaiian Islands Marine
National Monument by executive
proclamation.
That kind of single-minded ac-
tion comes naturally to Bush. It
was the approach he took, to con-
siderable international alarm,
during his first term when he launched
the invasion of Iraq and declared that he
would stop terrorists by waging preven-
tive wars if he deemed them necessary. 
Yet Bush tells friends that while he
needs to work harder to lift his popular-
ity and change his what-me-worry
image, he won’t swerve from his path.
“On the international level, the job is
pretty clear—working to help democra-
cy in Iraq, Lebanon, and the Palestinian
area,” says White House Press Secretary
Tony Snow, and at the same fighting a
brutal global terrorist movement. On the
SHOWCASE. President Bush visited the

Wednesday, signing a new pension se-
curity bill Thursday, and meeting with
senior economic advisers at Camp David
Friday. Pointedly, Bush didn’t hold his
meetings in the West Wing but traveled
around the Washington area—to the
Pentagon, the State Department, a new
National Counterterrorism Center in
suburban Virginia, and Camp David—all
to project a sense of vigor and activism.
Bush also brought in outside special-
ists on Iraq to get a wider range of views.
The private session was calculated to
show that the president isn’t isolated
from the wider world, that he listens to
those who disagree with him, and that
he isn’t detached from the policy process.
“The president is very engaged in
most policy issues,” says White House
Deputy Chief of Staff Joel Kaplan, the
main coordinator of policy development
for Bush. “He’s an extremely aggressive
questioner.” Kaplan told U.S. News:
“We have policy time reserved on the
president’s calendar basically every day
that he is in town . . . . If you’re on the
hook for policy time, you know you’d

strengthen the economy.
Republican strategists say Bush also

America’s security than the Democrats. 
Despite all their problems, including
the perception that, as an adviser to a
previous gop president says, “the Amer-
ican people are tuning him out,” Bush
and his aides don’t seem distressed.
“This is never a White House that gets
down,” Snow told U.S. News. “It’s not a
place where people sit around whining
and griping.” That’s because Bush sets
an infectiously upbeat tone, Snow says.
“He’s not a legacy guy,” the press secre-
tary adds. “It’s not, ‘I’ve got to get this bill
passed because it’s important to my lega-
cy.’ He takes a longer view of things. He
thinks in terms of the long-term chal-
lenges the nation faces.”
But as his ongoing gravitas campaign
shows, Bush also has come to the prac-
tical conclusion that polls do matter and
that unless he pulls himself out of the
cellar, he might well be facing a hostile
Congress controlled by Democrats after
the November 7 election. “It’s an unset-
tling time for people,” says a gop strate-
gist who informally advises the White
House. Despite the president’s commit-
ment to a “longer view,” what he does
over the next 11 weeks could make or
break his presidency. And it’s clear that,
finally, George W. Bush realizes it. l

F
ederal District Judge
Anna Diggs Taylor’s
ruling last week in a
case challenging the Bush
administration’s secret do-
mestic surveillance pro-
gram seemed unequivocal.
“There are no hereditary
kings in America and no
powers not created by the
Constitution,” she wrote in
the first decision to directly
address the program’s legal-
ity. The National Security
Agency’s warrantless phone
eavesdropping, she said, 
violates U.S. citizens’ priva-
cy and free-speech rights
and illegally bypasses re-
view by a special court set
up to monitor domestic spy-
ing. She ordered it stopped.
While it appeared a
stinging rebuke of Presi-
dent Bush’s broad asser-
tions of executive authority,
the battle over spying is far
from over. The administra-
tion obtained a stay to keep
the nsa operation running
pending a September 7
hearing and plans to appeal
the decision to the Sixth
Circuit or the U.S. Supreme
Court. More challenges to
the program are wending
their way through the
courts. When Congress re-
turns, members will again
hash over a proposed gop
bill that would essentially
legalize the surveillance
program as is.
Reasoning. Both sides
were quick to put their own
spin on the ruling. Admin-
istration officials defended
their efforts as legal and
“very important for the se-
curity of our country,” said
Attorney General Alberto
Gonzales. Some scholars
questioned Taylor’s reason-
ing, but Anthony Romero of
the American Civil Liberties
Union, the lead plantiff,
hailed her decision as “a
nail in the coffin” on Bush’s
use of executive power. 
Taylor’s ruling gives fresh
ammunition to Democrats
opposed to an administra-
tion-friendly bill proposed
by Senate Judiciary Com-
mittee Chairman Arlen
Specter that would, in ef-
fect, stamp “approved” on
the nsa program. The
handful of court cases chal-
lenging the surveillance in-
cludes one scheduled for ar-
gument September 5 in
New York. And 17 cases
against phone companies
believed to have cooperated
with the nsa were recently
consolidated and are pend-
ing in a San Francisco
court. –Liz Halloran

N
esquehoning, pa.—Here in
the rolling hills of eastern Penn-
sylvania, Republican Sen. Rick
Santorum seems so relaxed that
you might forget that he’s in the fight of
his life. It’s a curious persona for a con-
servative firebrand, a man known for
wearing his religion on his sleeve. That in-
your-face style is one of the key reasons
Santorum is running behind his Demo-
cratic opponent, state Treasurer Bob
Casey Jr., in this battleground swing state.
It also might explain why, out here on the
stump, Santorum is instead calmly fo-
cusing on the incumbent’s advantage: the
ability to bring home the bacon. During a
chat with firefighters, Santorum notes
that in his 12 years as a senator, he’s
brought back more than $3 million to this
region alone for road and other projects. 
”When I get a bee in my bonnet for the
people of my state, I pound away hard,”
he says. But this time around, even that
sort of Washington clout could be a dou-
ble-edged sword, thanks to
the flagging popularity of
Republicans and the presi-
dent. George Bush’s disap-
proval rating in Pennsylva-
nia is 59 percent, according
to a recent poll—and over
the years, this incumbent senator has
been with him more often than not. Can
Rick Santorum overcome all that?
Nasty. That’s the key question in what’s
shaping up as the Senate’s marquee
race—a race that may cost $45 million to
$50 million or more before it’s over.
Given Santorum’s history and persona,
most veteran observers are expecting a
hard-fought, nasty battle. And the stakes
couldn’t be much higher: The Democrats
need to pick up six seats to gain control
of the U.S. Senate. 
A few months ago, it looked like Casey,
the son of the late Pennsylvania Gov.
Robert Casey, was a sure winner; a Quin-
nipiac poll in June showed him with a 52-
to-34 percent lead over Santorum. But
a poll released last week showed that
Casey’s lead had been cut to just 6 points.
Political experts believe that Santorum is
gaining thanks to a run of effective tele-
vision and radio advertising, in which he
appears calm and collected,
not strident. But Santorum,
they argue, has more work to
do on softening his image to
have a shot at winning. His
voting record is one of the
most conservative in the Sen-
ate, and he has strong views against abor-
tion, embryonic stem cell research, and
gay marriage. 
In contrast, Casey is a soft-spoken,
laid-back moderate Democrat, plugged
into the state political scene in Harris-
burg. Like Santorum, he is an an-
tiabortion Roman Catholic who oppos-
es gun control and pulling troops out of
Iraq. But Casey aims to differentiate
himself by arguing that he will not walk
in lock step with Bush. Casey is against
privatizing Social Security and tax cuts
for the wealthy, while he supports
deficit reduction and decisive action
against global warming. “People want
to go in a new direction,” says Casey,
campaigning at Guy’s Hardware in
Manns Choice, a small town in the
southern part of the state. “Senator
Santorum’s record has been a 98 per-
cent voting record with the president.” 
But like most incumbents, Santorum
has the fundraising advantage; he’s
raised about $17 million thus far, com-
pared with $11 million for Casey. That’s
allowed Santorum to spend more on ads,
which could be crucial. Three of 10 vot-
ers say they don’t know Casey well
enough to form an opinion, according to
a recent poll. His previous posts as state
treasurer and state auditor general are
relatively low-profile jobs that have done
little to define him. “We have a long way
to go between now and Election Day to
get our message out,” admits Casey. 
Political experts say the race will be
decided in the famously fickle Philadel-
phia suburbs. So expect Santorum to be
running hard and aggressively. Casey,
too. It’s likely to be a bare-knuckle finale,
says Jerry Shuster, professor of political
communications at the University of
Pittsburgh. “They will be painting each
other with a broader brush,” he says.
“And it will be a black brush.” l

R
ep. Ed Markey, a Massachusetts
Democrat, was back on familiar
ground last week, holding a press
conference outside Washington’s Ronald
Reagan National Airport. Since 9/11,
Markey has repeatedly introduced leg-
islation requiring the Department of
Homeland Security to screen all cargo
placed on U.S. passenger planes for ex-
plosives. Now he’s urging dhs to take
cargo off altogether. “If it isn’t scanned,”
Markey said, “It should be banned.” 
The thwarting of the alleged British-
based plot to blow up United States-bound
airliners with liquid explosives has re-
newed attention on what critics say are
troublingly familiar—but still unad-
dressed—security loopholes. Markey and
some security experts say the aviation in-
dustry, which spent more than $38 mil-
lion on lobbying in 2004 and 2005, and
portions of the business community have
helped squash efforts to plug important
gaps. Aviation officials argue that deploy-
ing expensive but flawed technology could
significantly disrupt air travel or even
bankrupt airlines. “Nobody cares more
about security than we do,” says James
May of the Air Transport Association, or
ata, the airlines’ trade group. But finding
a balance between security and commerce
is a daunting assignment. 
“Disastrous.” Take air cargo. Airlines
carry 6 billion pounds of commercial
cargo each year, earning them $4 billion.
When Markey introduced his legislation
in May 2005, it prompted letters from 
the ata and the National Association of
Manufacturers, which called the measure
“disastrous.” Airlines and shippers say re-
liable technology for screen-
ing cargo doesn’t yet exist.
Markey says a government
report indicates up to 60
percent of that cargo can be
broken down and run
through X-ray machines
used on checked baggage.
The 9/11 Commission’s rec-
ommendation that airliners
be equipped with a blast-
proof container for suspi-
cious cargo just isn’t practi-
cal, aviation officials say;
the containers weigh more
than 300 pounds. 
The threat from shoul-
der-fired 
missiles 
has
proved equally vexing; the
weapons can be bought 
on the black market for
$5,000. Two years ago dhs
gave two firms $45 million
to adapt military technolo-
gy that throws the missiles
off course for use by the
country’s 6,800 commercial
planes. A recent dhsreport
said one of the companies
could install up to 1,000
missile-jamming devices for $1 million per
aircraft, with an additional operational
cost of $365 per flight. Congress has so far
balked at the tab; the devices don’t yet
meetdhsreliability standards either. But
Democratic Rep. Steve Israel says they’re
“good enough” to be on Air Force One. 
dhs also faces turbulence on a pro-
posed requirement that airlines transmit
the names of passengers on U.S.–bound
flights to American security officials an
hour before takeoff. Aviation officials say
that might put a crimp in potential last-
minute business. So dhs said last week
they would allow airlines to tweak the
data up to 15 minutes before takeoff. l

eirut—They waited a few hours
to see if the cease-fire would
hold. When it did, thousands of
refugees from the fighting in
south Lebanon came pouring down the
bombed-out coastal highway looking for
their homes. Many found rubble instead.
Thirty-four days of airstrikes, artillery
barrages, and brutal house-to-house
fighting between Hezbollah and the Is-
raeli military left much of the south in
ruins. In rural farming villages, livestock
lay dead and rotting in streets cratered
by precision-guided bombs. Many
homes and shops are now mounds of
broken concrete and twisted rebar. 
The residents of south Lebanon—
mostly poor Shiite Muslims—defied the
Israeli military’s orders not to drive
south of the strategic Litani River to re-
turn to their homes. They arrived to
greetings 
from 
polite
young men with hand-
held 
radios, 
neatly
trimmed beards, and clip-
boards inquiring about
what they needed to sur-
vive during the rebuilding.
Hezbollah’s fighters re-
laxed only a few minutes
to congratulate each other
on what they call “the Di-
vine Victory” and to use
cellphones to check on
family and comrades be-
fore completely switching
gears to run a massive hu-
manitarian operation de-
signed to assist their constituency and
head off the inevitable complaints that
they had brought this destruction down
upon their own people.
Less than 12 hours after the cease-fire
silenced the guns, Hezbollah leader Has-
san Nasrallah took to the
airwaves both as the most
successful Arab military
hero of the modern era and
as an old-style political
ward boss bearing pork-
barrel projects. He prom-
ised to pay the rent of all
the displaced and offered to
rebuild and furnish any de-
stroyed homes—and, by the
next day, he had deployed
more than 1,000 civil engi-
neers and experts around
the country to start cata-
loging the damage. 
Hezbollah has long pro-
vided social services, including operat-
ing schools and hospitals, for Lebanon’s
poor Shiites. The reconstruction effort
had been planned from the onset of
fighting, says one Hezbollah official
working in Beirut. Unwilling to speak for

attribution, he was coordinat-
ing the massive effort to care
for the hundreds of thousands
of internally displaced persons
in Beirut alone and preparing
for the aftermath even before
the cease-fire took hold. “Many
of these people are mad they
lost their homes,” he acknowl-
edges. “We have been told by
the highest authorities in the
organization: ‘People are going
to be mad at us; do whatever it
takes to help them.’ ” So we
take their abuse and com-
plaints and do whatever we
can to assist them.”
“Celebration.” These concerns
were justified. Hezbollah might
be the most popular movement
among Lebanon’s Shiite Mus-
lim community, but people also
know that it was Nasrallah’s
“Party of God” that started the
war by crossing the border into
Israel, kidnapping two Israeli
soldiers and killing three 
others. For every Hezbollah
commander like Hussein Ru-
mati—who claimed, “It is a cel-
ebration; even with the de-
struction of all of the villages in
the south, it was worth it”—
there is someone returning to a
destroyed home or business.
“Damn Hezbollah, damn
Nasrallah,” yelled one older
Shiite woman in a head scarf as
she surveyed the destruction of
her family’s grocery store in
Saddiqine, just 3 miles from the
Israeli border. Her neighbors
and family quickly quieted her
by pointing out the presence of
a western journalist, but none
disagreed. In the tiny hamlet, a
few hundred yards from the re-
mains of her store, Hezbollah
volunteers were operating
heavy machinery to locate bod-
ies trapped under a collapsed
house. A Hezbollah escort
barred a journalist from con-
ducting interviews in English,
apparently concerned people
might express criticism of Hezbollah if
he couldn’t understand the conversation.
Residents are returning to their towns
and villages expecting Hezbollah to take
the lead in rebuilding. “[Nasrallah] said
he would [rebuild] in his first speech of
the war, so it’s an issue of credibility,”
says Jamil Mroue, editor-in-chief and
publisher of Beirut’s Daily Star news-
paper. “And when the guns fell silent, he
delivered. But he also has to end any dis-
cussions emanating from the destruction
of south Lebanon over who caused this
disaster. This is going to create tensions
he needs to dampen down.”
But by circumventing the central gov-
ernment even as it attempts to exert mil-
itary control over south Lebanon for the
first time since 1969, Hezbollah has re-
inforced the perception that Beirut can-
not govern the entire nation. And many
Lebanese scoff at the idea that U.N. Res-
olution 1701, which produced the cease-
fire, will succeed in ending Hezbollah’s
state within a state. “It’s too early to ad-
dress this state question because there is
no Lebanese state for Hezbollah to op-
erate their own state within,” says
Mroue. “At best, 1701 offers a kind of op-
portunity for the state to develop.” 
WAR ZONE. A girl looks over her damaged room. Below, Hezbollah members unearth

This central weakness of the Lebanese
government stems from its religious di-
visions and a political system that allo-
cates power between Sunni, Christian,
Druze, and Shiite communities. The
members of each religious group rely 
on their political leaders for jobs and 
patronage. So instead of governing,
Lebanese politics tends to resemble
Mafia families divvying up political and
economic spoils and distribut-
ing them among those most
loyal. Each group also tends to
look outside of Lebanon for sup-
port: Christians to Europe and
America, the Sunnis to Saudi
Arabia and the Gulf states, and
the Shiites to Iran. And this can
further weaken the country as
some groups pursue agendas
more in line with external pa-
trons than Lebanon’s needs, as
Hezbollah is often accused of
doing for Iran and Syria.
Tough neighborhood. One pow-
erful Lebanese banker, the kind
of man who does not allow his
name to appear in print, says
that Lebanon’s place as the
most westernized and liberal
Arab country stems from this
central weakness but also
leaves the country vulnerable to
exploitation by internal and ex-
ternal powers. “So as the rest of
the region goes, so goes
Lebanon,” he says. “No peace
with Iran, no peace in Israel-
Palestine, then you will see no
peace here.”
Furthermore, it would take a
far more powerful central gov-
ernment than now seems pos-
sible to step up to the immedi-
ate challenges: deploying the
Lebanese Army to the southern
border, dealing with billions of
dollars in reconstruction, and
possibly facing down a Hezbol-
lah that currently wields more
regional political and military
power than the central govern-
ment in Beirut. 
There are signs that, if any-
thing, the historic religious 
fissures are widening. Take 
the reconstruction effort, for 
instance. “The parliament is 
already dividing up the recon-
struction money to suit them-
selves,” says Patrick Haenni, a
Lebanon analyst for the Inter-
national Crisis Group. “[Speak-
er Nabi] Berri is saying that all
the aid has to be spent through
the Council of the South, which he con-
trols. The [Sunni] Hariri Foundation
says the government is too weak to deal
with on this, so they should administer
it themselves. The Maronite [Chris-
tians] are trying to go their own way 
as well. And Hezbollah just says, ‘What
government? Where is the govern-
ment? We’ll do it ourselves’—with
Iran’s money.” l

erusalem—The bumper stickers
read: “We will win.” This was Prime
Minister Ehud Olmert’s closing ex-
hortation in his would-be Churchil-
lian speech at the start of the Lebanon
war. But as the furious, 34-day “Opera-
tion Change of Direction” came to an
abrupt halt under a United Nations
cease-fire, those blue-and-white stickers
all but disappeared. 
While Israel had given much better
than it had gotten in southern Leba-
non, the grim conclusion
here was that the super-
power of the Middle East
had been stymied by a 
few thousand well-armed,
well-trained guerrillas of
Hezbollah. Suddenly, Is-
raelis’ confidence, which
shot up after the success-
ful withdrawal from Gaza
a year ago and stayed 
up even through former
Prime 
Minister 
Ariel
Sharon’s incapacitation,
was gone. Suddenly, it was
overtaken by recrimina-
tions over the handling of
the war and anxiety over
the country’s future in this
unfriendly, volatile region. 
The new, postwar slo-
gans, not yet on bumper
stickers but already on the headlines of
editorials, are “Olmert must go,” and De-
fense Minister Amir “Peretz must go,”
and Israel Defense Forces commander
Dan “Halutz must go.” What was seen
here as nothing less than a “war of sur-
vival” has come to a deeply disillusioning
end for Israel, so much so that the polit-
ical and military leadership has lost the
public’s faith. One respected poll found
Israelis disapproving of Olmert’s war
leadership by a 2-to-1 margin; just a week
earlier, he’d won a 3-to-1 endorsement. 
The government seems in no immedi-
ate danger of falling, but that could
change rapidly, especially if the rising call
for a blue-ribbon inquiry of the war proves
irresistible. But Olmert’s political survival
is already threatened by an investigation
into his alleged financial windfall from
the sale of his family’s Jerusalem apart-
ment. If he comes out of that looking bad,
he could have a hard time staying in of-
fice. Halutz, meanwhile, is fighting to hold
on to his job following the discovery that
he sold off a $28,000 stock portfolio a few
hours after Hezbollah killed and kid-
napped Israeli soldiers, which set the 
war in motion. 
Harsh reality. It is diffi-
cult to imagine that there
would have been such a
domestic outcry over
Olmert’s and Halutz’s fi-
nancial dealings if the war
had ended well. Instead,
after starting with great
patriotic conviction, it
slammed into the harsh
reality of Lebanon. Israeli
leaders vowed at the out-
set to rid Israel of the
threat of Hezbollah’s
guerrilla army, then gave
glowing updates of the
campaign’s progress, but
after a couple of weeks, it
dawned on Israelis that
Hezbollah wasn’t going
away. The terrorists fired

as many as 250 rockets a day at northern
Israel, killing 39 people, injuring some
5,000, and forcing the region’s 1 million-
plus residents to either flee south or hide
in bomb shelters for the duration. The
Army and Air Force found that Hezbol-
lah had too many rockets, fortified
bunkers, land mines, and antitank mis-
siles to take out quickly. 
Worse, reserve soldiers returning
home are telling shocking tales of Army
disorganization and confusion that en-
cumbered them at the front. “We weren’t
even given equipment to adjust the sights
on all of our weapons, which is the most
basic thing you need to be ready for bat-
tle,” said “Moshe,” 34, a reserve
sniper with a paratroopers unit.
Because Hezbollah’s antitank mis-
siles proved so lethally destructive,
the Army was reluctant to send out
supply vehicles to the troops, so
Moshe and his comrades were re-
duced to stealing food and water
from the houses of the abandoned
village where they made camp.
“We got conflicting orders from
day to day,” he recalled. “It was a
mess from top to bottom.”
The cease-fire—which somehow
withstood the killing of 11 Hezbol-
lah guerrillas by Israeli troops in
the first two days—left Israel in a
far weaker position than Olmert
had led the country to anticipate.
“Israel has chalked up impressive
achievements that are unparal-
leled, perhaps even unprecedent-
ed,” he declared in the thick of the
war. “We can say with certainty
that the face of the Middle East
has already been changed.” He
pledged repeatedly not to call off
the fighting until Hezbollah was
disarmed and displaced in south-
ern Lebanon by a large, “robust”
multinational fighting force.
The cease-fire, however, found
Hezbollah still well armed in south-
ern Lebanon, with nobody prepared to
take away its Iranian-issued weapons. The
Lebanese Army, which includes a large
proportion of pro-Hezbollah Shiite troops,
moved into the south alongside a decid-
edly unrobust United Nations peace-
keepers mission—leaving the potential for
more trouble along the border. The cease-
fire also left Israel still waiting for the re-
turn of Ehud Goldwasser and Eldad
Regev, the two kidnapped soldiers whose
unconditional release was first among
Olmert’s original war goals. Realistical-
ly, Israel will only get them back the old-
fashioned way—by freeing hundreds of
Lebanese prisoners in return. 
Nation & World
H
aifa, israel—Sgt. Josh Bran-
non didn’t mind the 70-plus
pounds of equipment he
lugged across the rough terrain of
south Lebanon even as his Israeli re-
connaissance unit came under fire
from Hezbollah. Nor was the tall,
27-year-old former athlete troubled
when he ran out of water during the
mission. And he could deal with
sleeping only an hour a day while
taking cover on the bathroom floor
of a Lebanese home.
What makes Brannon and
many other Israeli soldiers
angry is a sense that the war
ended prematurely. “We were
disappointed with the end re-
sult,” says Brannon, his voice
heavy with exhaustion two
days after crossing back into
Israel. “The war was suddenly
over, but the two soldiers were
still captured, and Hezbollah
was still armed.”
After the cease-fire took ef-
fect, his company commander
held a meeting to discuss the
problems the soldiers faced so
they could be better prepared
for the next round—if need be.
“It turned into a shouting
match,” says Brannon, a Califor-
nia native who volunteered for
the Israeli Army 21/2 years ago.
There was a long list of com-
plaints. The soldiers, reservists
between the ages of 23 and 40,
arrived highly motivated for
what they regarded as an exis-
tentialwar, only to find the
Army didn’t supply them with
basic equipment. “I was going to
take my own backpack in,” says
Brannon. Private donors provided
equipment, including scopes for guns.
Tough enemy. The enemy was an-
other surprise. Hezbollah fighters
were well trained, well equipped,
and well motivated. “This was not
like the [Palestinian] territories,
where you drive into Nablus in 30
minutes, surround a house, take a
wanted guy, and drive back,” he says.
Hezbollah fighters attacked with 
antitank missiles. They hit soldiers
during rescue operations. They used
guerrilla warfare tactics, which, in
the six years since Israel’s withdraw-
al from Lebanon, Israeli soldiers had
either forgotten or not learned.
Israeli security experts point to
shortcomings in Israeli leadership
and military intelligence. “The lead-
ership reacted from the gut—it went
into the war without thinking,” says
Eitan Barak, a military affairs ex-
pert at the Hebrew University of
Jerusalem. Another factor, he says,
was Israeli arrogance regarding air
power. “Israelis thought: ‘I de-
stroyed the whole Syrian air force
without losing a single plane, I fly
freely over Lebanon, I flew over
[Syrian President Bashar] Assad’s
palace, and no one does anything.’ ” 
Brannon, who was hospitalized
for severe dehydration and exhaus-
tion, is bitter. “After five days in the
bush and constantly thinking about
my family, there are times when a
cease-fire sounds good,” he says.
“But if we would have known the
conditions of the cease-fire—then
we would have preferred to stay in
the bush.” –Orly Halpern
Grumbling in the Ranks
Soldiers trudge
back to Israel.


This wasn’t the first time Israel tried
to crush Hezbollah militarily and failed;
that came in 1982 and ended 18 years
later when Israeli troops finally quit
Lebanon. Yet, Israel’s leaders convinced
themselves and the public that what
couldn’t be accomplished in 18 years
could be achieved now in a matter of
weeks. They set the bar for victory so
high that all Hezbollah had to do to
“win” was survive. They cre-
ated such heady expecta-
tions in the public that the
war’s inconclusive outcome
was bound to be an awful
disillusionment.
Return of the right? Among
the casualties is Israel’s lat-
est political path, which Sharon opened
with the Gaza disengagement and
Olmert hoped to complete with his “con-
solidation plan” for the West Bank. The
path is one of unilateral withdrawal from
Arab territories, with security ensured
by Israeli military deterrence. It went
bad first in Gaza, where fierce fighting
was overshadowed by the war in the
north, then went worse on the Lebanese
border, whose relative quiet during the
six years since the Israeli pullout had
served as a model for this latest road to
peace, or at least peace and quiet.
“The concept of unilateral withdraw-
al has collapsed, and I don’t think I’m ex-
pressing the sentiment only of my party
colleagues but of nearly everyone in this
chamber,” right-wing Likud leader
Binyamin Netanyahu told the Knesset.
Indeed, several cabinet ministers and
Knesset members from Olmert’s Kadi-
ma (Forward) party are now coming out
publicly against the West Bank consol-
idation plan. The war has brought for-
mer Prime Minister Netanyahu and the
political right back in from the cold. 
Yet if the war has discredited the con-
sensus around unilateral withdrawal, it
wasn’t exactly an advertisement for the
old consensus around the virtues of mil-
itary force. Then again, with enemies like
Hezbollah, Hamas, Syria, and Iran, Is-
raelis don’t find peace negotiations very
promising, either. They have the sense
that every course they’ve tried has
failed—not because of Israel but because
of the Arabs—and now they don’t know
where else to go. “I saw that all the other
ways didn’t work, so I believed that uni-
lateral withdrawal would bring peace,
but I was wrong. Now I see that no mat-
ter how much land we give them, they
will always want to destroy us,” said
Meirav Lev, serving dinner
on the patio of her family’s
home in pastoral Kiryat
Tivon, which took many
rocket attacks. Lev, 36, an
attorney, sat out the war
with her three children in
her parents’ house further
south, while her husband, Yaron, was
called to reserve duty, though not—
“thank God,” she said—in Lebanon. 
“I hoped that my children would not
have to go to the Army when they grow
up. But so many soldiers were killed in
this war that now I think I should have
another baby,” said Lev. “I’m sorry to say
it, but our country is always going to
have to live by the sword.” l

crats try to nationalize the election as a referendum on an
unpopular president and war, Republicans try to localize
it, bragging about their achievements for voters while de-
claring independence from the White House. 
The plans are obvious, but tricky to execute—especially
in a state as notoriously independent as Missouri. Two years
ago, George W. Bush beat John Kerry statewide by 7 points,
and there’s a Republican governor and two gop senators.
Yet now Bush’s approval rating sits at 40 percent, and the
gop governor is only a hair more popular. Then there’s this:
Fifty-four percent of the Missourians say the war in Iraq
was a mistake; 77 percent of the state’s self-described 
independent voters say the country is headed in the wrong
direction. Not exactly a Re-
publican-incumbent-friend-
ly environment. 
Jim Talent knows it. He’s
not only distancing himself
from the president; he dis-
owns Washington entirely. 
“I have been frustrated with
the establishments of both
parties,” he told me, making
the case that “the adminis-
tration has made mistakes”
in a whole variety of areas—
from the prosecution of the
war to farm policy. “There’s
no question that people want
change in Washington. I be-
lieve in change.” That is a nu-
anced argument coming from
a gop senator—leading inevi-
tably to the judge-me-by-my-
record-and-not-by-my-party
argument. “This election will
be about two people,” says
Talent. “And the voters will make judgments about . . . 
who speaks to them.” 
Democrat McCaskill, meantime, sounds like President
Bush is her statewide opponent. She’s linking Talent to
Bush with Krazy Glue, never missing an opportunity to say
something like “The White House ought to just take a room
in Missouri, they’re here so often helping Jim Talent.” Or
“He’s [Talent] been in lockstep with this administration.”
Message: He’s the guy with Bush. 
Reverse play. The Democratic plan to tether the gop
candidate to Bush could work. But there’s one more com-
ponent that holds the key: voter turnout. The Democrats’
calculation is that their voters are the ones truly motivat-
ed—because of anti-Bush sentiment, antiwar sentiment, or
just general malaise. In Missouri, Democrats also hope that
two ballot initiatives—for funding for embryonic stem cell
research and raising the minimum wage—will bring their
voters out. And McCaskill is taking a page from the gop
playbook, campaigning in rural parts of the state. 
But will the Democratic intensity be able to trump 
Republican skill at turning out voters? For years, the gop
has been fine-tuning its Karl Rovian technology of “micro-
targeting”—the ability to find would-be gop voters, regis-
ter them, and get them to the polls. Former Democratic
leader Dick Gephardt—who was at the receiving end of their
efforts when the gop took control of the House in 1994—
says the Democrats are playing catch-up. “A voter who’s 
not going to vote doesn’t make a difference,” he told me.
“The genius of the Republi-
cans is that they know
you’ve got to figure out who
you can actually get to come
out and vote. That’s what
we’re beginning to do.” 
When Gephardt and com-
pany lost control of the
House, he says, they didn’t
see it coming. “I thought we
were going to lose some seats,
but I had no idea it would be
52 seats,” recalls the former
Missouri congressman. This
time, it’s the Democrats on
the attack—only the Republi-
cans see it coming. “They’re
more aware of the danger,”
Gephardt says. “But I don’t
see any evidence that they’re
going to be able to do any-
thing about it.”

might say: Show me. l

By Alex Markels
J
iany Massad isn’t quite ready to
throw in the towel on his fledg-
ling career as a Miami real-es-
tate tycoon. But if the local
housing market continues to
head south, the 30-year-old
real-estate broker is already making al-
ternate plans. “I might restart my old
business,” he says of a home decorating
company that specialized in high-end
window treatments. “At least it’s real-
estate-related.”
With home sales down by nearly a
third in Florida last quarter, thousands
of those who hoped to cash in on the
real-estate gold rush are now facing the
cold reality of working in one of the
country’s most cyclical businesses.
“Everyone’s getting out,” Massad says of
colleagues who have already traded in
their real-estate licenses for jobs in the
jewelry trade and Internet sales. 
Until recently, the housing industry
was the biggest engine of job growth in
the country, accounting for more than a
third of all new jobs added to the econ-
omy since the boom began earlier in the
decade. Housing-related employment
now accounts for about 1 in every 10
jobs, a record, according to Moody’s
Economy.com. “We’re more dependent
on housing than at any time in the last
30 years,” says chief economist Mark
Zandi, “which could be a problem if the
downturn becomes more pronounced.”
Price slide. The latest housing indus-
try numbers suggest that’s exactly
what’s happening. Both existing-home
sales and housing starts slowed sharply
last month, especially in formerly hot
areas like Florida and California. Mean-
while, more than two dozen metro areas
reported outright price declines. In
Boston, nearly half of all homes on the
market had been reduced in price at
least once, and more than a third have
been marked down in San Diego and
Phoenix, according to figures from
ZipRealty.com.
Housing economists say the depth of
the real-estate slump in markets around
the country will depend, in part, on the
local employment picture. “If job growth
remains strong, that means people are
going to keep moving in and buying
Money & Business
HOUSING SLUMP
THREATENS JOBS 
The economy’s growth has never before been so
driven by real estate. Now that engine is sputtering


houses,” says housing ana-
lyst John Tuccillo.
Trouble is, many areas
that have enjoyed the
biggest run-ups in real-es-
tate values have also seen
corresponding increases in
housing-related jobs, leav-
ing them especially vulner-
able. That could create a vi-
cious cycle as job losses in
the housing sector begin to
undermine the overall econ-
omy, leading to an even
deeper downturn in hous-
ing. “There’s somewhat of a
time lag here, but everyone’s
eventually going to feel it,”
says Jay Butler, director of
the Arizona Real Estate
Center near Phoenix, where
housing-related commerce
accounts for about a third of
the local economy. 
In Florida, where in some
coastal areas housing now
accounts for as many as 1 in
5 jobs, the number of real-
estate agents alone has in-
creased by more than 40
percent since 2001, to
305,000. Brokers’ ranks
have also surged in California, to more
than half a million—about one for every
home the California Association of Re-
altors expects to be sold this year. “The
numbers just don’t add up,” says Vince
Malta, car’s president, who predicts a
coming shakeout as less experienced
agents find they can’t earn enough to
stay in the business.
Tightening. That process is already un-
derway in other housing-related jobs,
such as mortgage lending, title services,
and appraisals. With the refinancing
boom played out and mortgage appli-
cations near a four-year low, lenders like
Washington Mutual have recently laid
off thousands of workers, while some
smaller operations have shut down
completely. “It was quick, easy money,
but then rates go up and it’s over,” says
mortgage trainer Christopher Cruise,
who recently visited one mortgage lend-
ing operation in Rockville, Md., that let
all 71 of its loan officers go. “At the peak,
all you needed was a voice and a tele-
phone, and you were pretty much guar-
anteed six figures. But now you’ve got 
to suck it up, and some folks would
rather just go lay on the beach and 
wait around for the next refi boom.”
That’s certainly not the case with
workers at Bruce Williams Homes in
Bradenton, Fla., which recently down-
sized its ranks by 25 workers, about a
quarter of the total staff. “We helped find
jobs for everyone we let go,” construc-
tion vice president Tom McTigue says of
the workers he steered into jobs with
other builders. “It’s not like everything
has suddenly come to a grinding halt.”
At least so far, the downturn has
forced more of a belt tightening than a
full-blown bust at his company. “We’ve
cleaned out our backlog, and we’re still
building,” he says, “just not like we were
a year ago.” 
Others note that with commercial con-
struction still booming in places like San
Diego, workers with transferable skills
are having little trouble finding work.
“We’ve had a big slowdown in condo de-
velopment but a huge increase in hotel
construction,” notes University of San
Diego economist Alan Gin. “So far, the
two are canceling each other out, but it’s
hard to say how long that will last.”
For his part, Massad is trying to ad-
just his clientele, too. The founder of 
FloridaRealtyFinder.com had specialized
in helping investors buy preconstruction
condos. But with investors all but van-
ished from the Miami condo market, he
has recently taken to walking his neigh-
borhood to drum up residential sales. “A
lot of other agents don’t want to work that
hard,” he says. “But in six or nine months,
they’ll be out of business, and that’ll just
be less competition for me.” l
Here are the metropolitan areas in
which the housing industry accounts
for the greatest share of total jobs.

W
hen Lauren Minardo goes
shopping, she steers clear of
stores like American Eagle
Outfitters and Abercrombie &
Fitch. With tank tops, novelty shirts, and
distressed denim, such teen retail
chains hold little appeal for the
27-year-old marketing associate
in New York. “When I was 17, it
didn’t faze me to walk down the
street with ripped jeans,” says
Minardo, who now sports a more
polished look, dressing business
casual for workdays and in more
classy outfits at night. “But you
need to be a bit more dignified
when you’re 27.” 
That sentiment hasn’t been
lost on teen retailers, who are
now looking to grow up with
their customers. Spinoffs aimed
at 20-somethings are crowding
the mall, with more to come.
Among them: American Eagle,
which will open Martin+Osa this
fall, and One Thousand Steps,
from Pacific Sunwear, which
opened its doors earlier this year.
These come hard on the heels of
similar concepts, such as Jim-
my’Z, from teen chain Aero-
postale, Abercrombie & Fitch’s
Ruehl No. 925, and Ralph Lau-
ren’s Rugby chain.
Malled out. For retailers, the
spinoffs offer a way to diversify
and maintain a healthy bottom
line. Says Dana Telsey, founder of
the Telsey Advisory Group and a
retail analyst: “2006 is absolute-
ly the year for new concepts. Part
of this is the search for growth.”
Telsey estimates that around 400
malls and 800 strip centers can
support robust growth. Many teen
retailers have already saturated
these locations, leaving little op-
portunity for growth with existing
stores. For example, Abercrombie
& Fitch last week reported flat sec-
ond-quarter, same-store sales
overall, compared with a year ear-
lier, but heady growth for the
Ruehl brand.
Anaheim, Calif.-based Pacific
Sunwear, best known for its
surfer- and skater-inspired apparel, aims
to grow its retail space by 10 percent a
year. “Already having 1,100 stores,” says
ceo Seth Johnson, “it means that you
have to have new businesses in the
pipeline.” To that end, the chain this year
launched One Thousand Steps, a high-
end shoe store. It is aimed at a customer
who has graduated from college or is
starting a first job. 
Demographic changes are driving the
interest in selling to 20-somethings.
Straddling generations X and Y, those
ages 20 to 34 are one of the population’s
fastest-growing segments. The
group now makes up a little over
20 percent of the total population
and is expected to grow almost 9
percent to nearly 66 million
members by 2020. More impor-
tant to retailers, the age group ac-
counts for 27 percent of total ap-
parel sales and 35 percent of
spending in specialty stores. 
Twenty-somethings are willing
to spend. They were weaned not
only on long periods of prosper-
ity but on a culture that celebrat-
ed consumerism. Shows like
mtv’s My Super Sweet Sixteen
and tlc’s Trading Spaces have
only encouraged the mentality to
spend, spend, and spend. “They
are the ones who grew up con-
stantly buying new outfits,” says
Tim Bess, a market analyst for
the Doneger Group, a fashion
consultancy. “They want to look
good and are out shopping every
week to find a new outfit to go out
for the weekend.”
That’s one reason Hot Topic
founder Orv Madden launched
Metropark, a high-end chain
aimed at such shoppers. “There
was no one out there really
young and hip and who picked
up where the teen stores left off,”
says Madden, who left Hot Topic
in 2001 after expanding the
chain nationwide. Metropark of-
fers customers a selection of the
latest and trendiest brands like
Gwen Stefani’s Harajuku Lovers
line. Metropark’s merchandise is
high end, with items like jeans
from premium denim company
Rock & Republic retailing for up-
wards of $200. But Madden
doesn’t worry that the steep price
tag will drive customers away.
“This is a generation that wants
to feel young and think young,”
he says. “And fashion is a huge
part of that.” l

Perched above a department store in downtown
Philadelphia’s Wanamaker building, food service
giant Aramark’s innovation center could be mistaken
for a dot-com-office relic. The entrance has a model
of its Starbucks-like “Java City” coffee carts. Rolling
cubicle walls have dry-erase boards on one side for
impromptu meetings, and modern cafeteria chairs
are scattered about. Center stage is the test kitchen,
with glass walls so desk employees can watch chefs
bake ciabatta rolls or whip up new salad dressings.
But rather than being a testament to excess, the

FROM TOP: MATTHEW HOLLERBUSH FOR USN&WR;
MICHAEL FICETO—THE HEARST CORP. 
center is actually Aramark’s means of
combating post-bubble corporate cost-
cutting. Many companies across the
country have slashed dining programs,
among other employee benefits. Four
years ago, companies spent about $747 a
day per operation for food service. Now
that has plummeted to $306 a day, says
Tom Newcomb, owner of consulting firm
Corporate Dining. The number of com-
panies that subsidize employee meals has
been slashed in half. Executives looking
to cut fat have shifted costs to caterers
like Aramark and its main competitors,
Sodexho and Compass Group.
A decade ago, about 70 percent
of companies paid such caterers
a fixed fee. Now, 70 percent
leave the whole dining opera-
tion—and any profit or loss—to
the caterers.
Good vibes. Deciding whether
to have an employee eating
plan—and what kind of plan—
is something every company
must figure out. A business’s
approach to dining can be “a
proxy for understanding how
a company manages its people,”
says Peter Cappelli, director of
the Center for Human Re-
sources at the Wharton School
of the University of Pennsylva-
nia. Ad agency Mullen’s remote
location in Wenham, Mass.,
made an on-site eatery practi-
cally a necessity (Page 59). The
firm decided to offer gourmet
meals at reduced prices. Agency execu-
tives believe that the investment pays off
because it helps make for a positive
workplace vibe, which translates into
more creative advertisements. 
Clients willing to invest in their cafete-
rias are the ones that Aramark now plans
to go after in an effort to turn around its
flagging business services division. The
company declines to bid on an increasing
number of pitches with too-low budgets,
says Ira Cohn, president of business serv-
ices. Earlier this month, longtime ceo
Joseph Neubauer announced he will take
the firm private with a group of private-
equity partners, giving management more
control over operations. 
Aramark argues that to be at their
best, companies should shell out for a
top-notch cafeteria. Setting up an up-
scale cafeteria for 5,000 employees may
cost as much as $5 million, estimates
Michael Pantano, a principal at Culinary
Advisors. But Aramark surveys show
the upside of a welcoming eatery.
Without the need to trek outside the of-
fice for lunch, employees spend less
time away from their desks. And they
are more likely to remain loyal to their
employer. Google’s free, lavish eateries
(Page 60) are one perk that
helps the search leader snag 
the best workers and keep
them close to their desks, says
John Dickman, Google’s glob-
al food services manager.
Aramark’s 53,000-square-
foot innovation center, which opened last
June, is at the heart of the company’s
strategy overhaul. So far 800 visitors
have taken tours, a key tool for persuad-
ing clients to choose Aramark over the
lowest-cost caterers, says Chris Malone,
senior vice president of marketing. Just
two blocks from Aramark’s main head-
quarters, the center is where the com-
pany is testing out a new eatery design
and menu. Workers are eating out more
than employers realize, Aramark has
found. That is not surprising, consider-
ing that company cafeterias have grow-
ing competition from ready-
to-eat grocery store meals and
quick, casual restaurants like
Quizno’s. Even if a company
gives away lunch, some em-
ployees will always choose to go
outside for a midday break, says
Pantano. That makes a first-
rate cafeteria more of an im-
perative for companies looking
to boost productivity. 
So Aramark aims to bring
workers back to corporate din-
ing rooms by creating cafeteria
and menu designs to appeal to
everyone from young call-
center workers to glass-office
executives. The eateries have
upscale fixtures and a more
modern look, to compete with a
restaurant atmosphere. And be-
cause food and diet trends have
become as fickle as fashion, the
innovation center’s 24 chefs
constantly experiment with new
menu items. As Americans eat
out more overall, worker tastes
have gotten more sophisticated,
58
The Hearst cafeteria, with a large organic
salad bar, aims for world-class cuisine. 
Aramark’s cafeteria concept: A chef can whip up
special orders or dish out prepared entrees. 


The communications company Hearst
designed its brand-new corporate head-
quarters in midtown Manhattan to fos-
ter a more coherent culture. By Septem-
ber, many of the company’s magazine
staffs, previously scattered at 12 sites,
will have moved into the historic 46-
story building on West 57th Street. It will
be the first time Hearst has had one
main corporate cafeteria. 
“We look at the headquarters as home,
and the cafe is part of the urban living
room,” says Brian Schwagerl, Hearst’s
vice president for real estate and facili-
ties planning. “The dining facility is re-
ally one that encourages people to share
ideas, like at a kitchen table at home.”
But there’s nothing down home about
the glass-and-steel cafeteria, which is tai-
lored for New York tastes. The escalator
leading to the third-floor lobby moves
through a waterfall. Light pours into the
Because advertising firm Mullen sits on
a sprawling 50-acre property in the
Boston suburbs, having a company cafe-
teria was a no-brainer. Founder Jim
Mullen decided to start the cafeteria in
the late 1980s, a few years after he moved
the company to a historical manor house
in Wenham, Mass. The premises were re-
plete with deer and wild turkey but no
takeout joints for a quick bite.
Mullen tapped Liz Walkowicz, a Culi-
nary Institute of America grad and
Boston caterer, to fill the agency’s then
60 bellies. Now, with 420 employees in
the building, Walkowicz still starts mix-
ing her buttery muffin batter at 5:30 a.m.
“It’s a dream job,” she says. Every day she
buys fresh organic meats and produce.
She even imports cheeses and chocolate
from Europe. And she sends all the bills
directly to accounting.
The cafe is “like an extension of the
culture,” says David Swaebe, a Mullen
spokesman. The agency, which is owned
by Interpublic Group, generally gives its
employees lots of freedom to work.
“Everyone is empowered to create things
that are special, whether an ad campaign
or an entree, and let their creative spir-
it go wild.” 
The cafeteria serves as a gallery dis-
playing the agency’s best ads. Employees
pay on an honor system, putting money
or an iou slip for the discounted meals
eatery, set between an art gallery and a
theater, from high glass windows. Hearst
employees produce magazines such as
Cosmopolitan, Esquire, and Town &
Country, and, Schwagerl says, “they ex-
pect not only a colorful and delicious eat-
ing experience but for it to bring excite-
ment and fun to everyday work life.”
The cafe, which will accommodate
2,000, is said to feature the largest or-
ganic salad bar in Manhattan, as well as
two sushi chefs. Architect Norman Fos-
ter designed the trapezoidal food trays,
the cafe uses china and paper products
(no plastic), and many dishes use meat
from the Hearst ranch in California.
All are moves intended to promote the
company’s brand image. “It’s more like
a world-class restaurant,” says Schwa-

under $7, employees don’t have to worry
about paying world-class prices. 
says Pantano. “People know more about
food now than they did 20 years ago,” he
says. “Sushi is the new pizza.”
Aramark cafeterias rely heavily on sea-
sonal ingredients and spicier recipes.
The hub of Aramark’s new concept is a
display case similar to a prepared-foods
section of an upscale grocery store. It
gets workers through the line quickly,
while helping customize meals. The case
is stocked with things like mini turkey
and salsa sandwiches, bok choy noodle
salad, and individual ingredients like
grilled salmon and roasted peppers. Em-
ployees can quickly order up a slice of
pizza or an entree. Chefs behind the
counter mix up salads or make sand-
wiches to order. The new cafeterias will
still have grill stations, but lukewarm
food in steam trays is no more.
The company is also testing out delivery
of meals to cubicles, ways for employees to
order online from outside restaurants as
well as the in-house kitchen, and kiosks
where employees can get health informa-
tion about the menu. 
Aramark plans to introduce different
versions of its new cafeteria design to 18
companies over the next year. Despite
the higher costs of its new food service,
Aramark is betting that businesses will
bite. And this fall Aramark will open up
its own updated company eatery at its
Philadelphia tower headquarters.

in an old wine box. The three daily en-
trees each cost about $3.50, and soup is
about $1.50. The Mullen agency’s coun-
try setting forces employees to mingle
during work hours, and the cafeteria is
the place to do it. “It’s really quite a party
out there,” says Walkowicz. Every other
Thursday a Mullen team sponsors a cafe-
teria happy hour. 
Employees like the eatery so much
that one Mullen accountant defected
from his desk job to work in the kitchen.
“He can always go back to accounting,”
Walkowicz says. 
Competition for talent is fierce in Silicon
Valley’s high-tech industry. But Google re-
mains the gold standard for employee
perks, with food at the core from the start.
“We wanted to take away all the basic
needs of Googlers,” says Nate Keller, one
of three executive chefs at Google’s Moun-
tain View, Calif., headquar-
ters. The company plies 
its employees with free
breakfast, lunch, din-
ner, and snacks.
Founders Sergey
Brin and Larry Page
held a cook-off to hire
executive chef Charlie
Ayers when the compa-
ny reached 30 employees
in 1999. Now Google has
about 7,900 employees. When
Ayers left last year to start his own restau-
rant, Keller took over as an executive chef.
Global food services manager John Dick-
man is charged with expanding the com-
pany’s dining services from five cafeterias
to 15 by the end of the year, more than
doubling the cooking staff. 
The main dining cafeteria is a sprawl-
ing room of floor-to-ceiling glass, long
communal tables, and a stage for com-
pany presentations. Some tables are set
up for the “dine with a stranger program”
to encourage people from different de-
partments to mix. It inspires Google’s
trademark creativity.
Brin and Page often
chat with employees
over food when they
are in town. 
But it’s the cuisine,
which rivals that of Califor-
nia’s best eateries, that really is
outstanding. While Keller has to stay with-
in a cost-per-person budget, he’s otherwise
given free rein. Google’s cafe is so popular
in Silicon Valley that chefs prepare about
11/2 times the amount of food needed to
feed workers just to accommodate guests
who wangle employee invitations. Chefs
buy meat and produce daily from organ-
ic farmers and local sellers. Ethnic cuisine
caters to the company’s international staff.
A panini sandwich press, bountiful salad
bar, and dessert stations make choosing
what to eat at Google almost as challeng-
ing as programming a new application. l
Regulation for Fun and Profit
Can securities regulations actually make busi-
nesses more efficient? After examining the last
big regulatory push before the Sarbanes-Oxley
corporate reform law—the 1964 amendments
to the fdr-era securities acts—three professors
from mit, Stanford, and Northwestern say yes.
Their paper, Mandated Disclosure, Stock Returns,
and the 1964 Securities Acts Amendments, which
appeared in the Quarterly Journal of Econom-
ics, studies the performance of companies in
the 34 months between the legislation’s pro-
posal and its implementation. As businesses
began meeting stricter disclosure require-
ments, their stock climbed 11.5 percent to 22.1
percent more than that of businesses unaffect-
ed by the law, making as much as $6.2 billion
for shareholders. Those firms also enjoyed
higher income and sales growth. “We’re not ar-
guing that all regulation is good by any means,”
says Stanford’s Paul Oyer, a coauthor. But
sometimes the market does seem to like it. 
Mood Disorders
That nasty commute doesn’t just make work-
ers testy—it may also affect their performance.
In Walking in the Door: Sources and Consequences
of Employee Mood on Work Performance, profes-
sors at the University of Pennsylvania’s Whar-
ton School and Ohio State’s Fisher College of
Business examine the effect of mood on the
work habits of employees in an insurance com-
pany call center. No surprise, snarky cus-
tomers lowered the number of calls handled
per hour. But it was the employees’ moods
when they arrived at work—good or bad—that
affected performance most consistently: Un-
happy workers took 15 percent fewer calls than
the average. Mood matters, says coauthor
Nancy Rothbard of Wharton: “Ignoring it
doesn’t mean it’s going to go away.”
Blinded by the Limelight
The higher the rank, the harder they may be
to work with. A study by researchers at the
University of Michigan and the University of
Haifa finds that the closer a company is
ranked to the top of the Fortune 500, the less
willing it may be to cooperate with its rivals—
even if it means less profit. The paper, Ranks
and Rivals: A Theory of Competition, appearing in
the Personality and Social Psychology Bul-
letin, includes an experiment with a group of
undergrads who were asked to play the role of
a ceo considering a joint venture with a com-
petitor. They could join forces and increase
their profits—and their rival’s—by 6 percent
or go it alone and boost profits 5 percent, with
the competition’s going up 1 percent. Of the
“ceos” ranked Nos. 3 and 4, only 39 percent
were willing to participate in the joint ven-
ture, while nearly 80 percent of lower-ranked
chiefs were willing to cooperate. “People be-
come blinded by their own specific rank,” says
coauthor Stephen Garcia of Michigan.

the democratization of access to information. Whether
you’re sitting in a Harvard law library or a row house in
Dublin or a grass hut in Africa, as long as you could ac-
cess the Internet, you had access to the same information
as everyone else.
And Web 2.0? 
Web 2.0 is really the democratization of participation.
When you think about the blogs and the wikis and the My-
Spaces, what’s really happening is now everyone has a
voice. Your currency in the 2.0 world is only based on the
strength and credibility of your writing or your argument.
We’ve gone from where it used to be “If you build it, they
will come.” Now it’s “If they build it, they will come.” I’m
actually more excited about 2.0 than I was about 1.0.
MySpace, in particular, has become the poster child of
Web 2.0. With more than 100 million registered users, it’s an
advertiser’s dream. But Lycos had more than 90 million
users, too, and it faded away. Is traffic a good proxy
for value? 
You can never predict the future for any of these
companies. Google wasn’t the first search en-
gine; it was more like the 10th. What people are
doing in the 2.0 world is similar to what many did
in the 1.0 world—build audience and not
worry about the revenue. 
That sounds like the bubble all
over again. 
I think we’ve got to look at 2.0
from 2004 to 2015, just like
we looked at 1.0 from 1995
to 2005. It’s natural to want
to say, “Boy, nobody’s real-
ly making money in 2.0.”
But somebody’s going to
harness the collective en-
ergy of tens of millions of
people creating content
on the Internet. Someone’s
going to organize it, create
communities, create com-
merce, and eventually create
advertising dollars around it. Is
it going to happen in ’06? No. Is
it going to happen over the next
10 years? Absolutely. l

A
s venture-capital funding surges back toward its
dot-com-era heights—$6.35 billion went into start-
ups last quarter, many of them new Internet com-
panies—investors are wondering if history is about
to repeat itself. Dan Nova, a venture veteran who cofounded
search pioneer Lycos in 1995—and who went on to finance
Internet stalwarts Ask Jeeves, MapQuest, and Quote.com—
insists that E-business has never gone out of style. Now a
general partner at Highland Capital Partners in Lexington,
Mass., Nova talked with Senior Editor Justin Ewers.
The bust scared most investors away from the Web. You
stayed put. Why?
We’re still in the early days of the evolution of the 
Internet. People tend to forget that it’s really only 10 or
11 years old. The collapse was a funny thing. What 
collapsed? Not the businesses themselves. Amazon
continues to grow. More and more people buy
online now than they ever have. More people
search. More people are doing commerce.
More companies are advertising on the In-
ternet. Year after year, there’s been steady
growth.
What lessons did you draw from the bust? 
There are always limits. But the public markets are
not the public markets of ’96, ’97, ’98. They
are at a more rational state, where
they’re only accepting companies that
have sustainable business models.
You talk a lot about Web 1.0, the In-
ternet boom in the late ’90s, and the
next wave, Web 2.0. What’s the 
difference?
When you look at 1.0, it was really
“Somebody’s going to
harness the collective
energy of tens of
millions of people
creating content on 
the Internet.”

I
t’s a busy summer afternoon at the
Ralph Lauren Center for Cancer Care
and Prevention in Harlem. The breast
clinic is in full swing as a surgeon 
and a medical assistant go back and forth
between exam rooms, performing biop-
sies, delivering test results, and checking
in on patients after treatment. Maud
Colas is hot on their heels. “You need to
go back to Washington Heights and get
your original films,” Colas says to
one patient. “Can you do that this
week?” To another, awaiting the
results of a breast biopsy in three
days, Colas says: “You call me if
there’s any worrying, ok?” One
woman has just finished her
eighth go-round of chemothera-
py, and Colas, she says, helped
her apply for Medicaid and fi-
nancial assistance to cover trans-
portation expenses to the clinic.
The two also prayed together. “I
come right to you and let you deal with my
problems,” she says to Colas. Both laugh.
Colas is a patient navigator. Her job at
the center—which sees all kinds of can-
cer patients but particularly those facing
a diagnosis of breast, cervical, prostate,
or colon cancer—is to help patients get
treatment. Traversing the thickets of
healthcare, especially when dealing with
a serious illness like cancer, is difficult
for everyone. It’s even more so for the
poor and nonwhite, says surgeon Harold
Freeman, president and medical direc-
tor of the center, who pioneered the pa-
tient navigator program at nearby
Harlem Hospital more than 15 years ago.
The navigators aren’t medical profes-
sionals but people who speak the same
language and are familiar with the pa-
tients’ communities and cultures. They
come from backgrounds ranging from
insurance to social work and teaching,
and step in when a screening test reveals
a suspicious finding. Their main role:
knocking down barriers to fol-
low-up tests and treatment.
“You have to make sure that
whatever the doctor recom-
mends at that point, the patient
gets,” says Freeman. That in-
cludes helping the patient with
child care, prescription drug
coverage, and getting to ap-
pointments—not to mention
providing a shoulder to cry on.

found that the navigator program at
Harlem Hospital boosted the number of
women who were diagnosed when their
breast cancer was in its early, treatable
stage from 6 percent to 41 percent, and
the five-year survival rate from 39 percent
to 70 percent. Last year, Congress ap-
proved funding to implement similar pilot
projects, while the Centers for Medicare
& Medicaid Services is currently sup-
porting navigators at six facilities across
the country. The National
Cancer Institute is passing
out $25 million in grants to
eight healthcare institutions
for navigators, targeting un-
derserved groups such as
low-income patients in Chi-
cago and American Indians
in Portland, Ore. “We can help coordinate
care, so that if the patient has to take a day
off from work, we can get as many ap-
pointments as possible in that day,” says
Karen Freund, who is overseeing one of
the grant recipient programs, at Boston
University Medical Center. 
The program, Freeman says, was born
out of frustration. Here he was at Harlem
Hospital in 1967, armed with the best can-
cer-fighting tools in the world. But by the
time he saw many patients, their cancer
had progressed beyond reach. “For too
many of the people whom I had a respon-
sibility to treat,” says Freeman, “I didn’t
have an answer for them.” He looked to the
neighborhood for clues. Something about
being black and poor was making people
die too soon, and its influence began long
before cancer cells began to multiply. 
Inspiration. Freeman knew he had to do
something. His parents had taught him
to look out for the underdog, and his
Catholic education also provided him
with a sense of responsibility toward the
less fortunate. He says he’s also inspired
by his name: A slave ancestor who
bought his own freedom called himself
Freeman. “I figure if that guy could do
that, I have no excuses,” he says. 
First Freeman set up breast-cancer
screening programs. But that still didn’t
do the trick. “You’d give people the test,
but somehow they couldn’t get to the next
phase.” In 1988, Freeman took his quest
nationwide as president of the American
Cancer Society. He pored over studies
and statistics and held hearings. His find-
ings? Many of the barriers were a direct
result of poverty. But it’s not just inad-
equate health coverage. Even those with
insurance might not have, say, the job
flexibility to make it to all the medical ap-
pointments a cancer diagnosis demands.
Needy patients may also lack knowledge
about the importance of quick follow-up
of a suspicious screening result.
Freeman imagined him-
self adrift on the sea in a
small boat, trying to reach
shore but wary of dangerous
rocks in his path. A naviga-
tor in the boat with him
knew where the hazards
were and was able to guide
him safely to land. “That’s
the metaphor that drove me
to the word ‘navigator,’ ” he
says. “There are rocks in the
lives of most people, but es-
pecially the poor.”
That doesn’t mean that
race is irrelevant. A 1995 nci
study, for example, found
that even stripping out vari-
ables like income, education,
and 
insurance, 
African-
Americans were still 20 per-
cent more likely to die as a re-
sult of colon cancer than
whites; there are similar
trends in other cancers.
Theories about the discrep-
ancies range from bias, un-
conscious or otherwise; in-
timidation by the largely white medical
establishment; or a sense of fatalism that
leads to unhealthful habits like smoking.
That’s why the navigators are outside the
medical establishment and are often from
the same community as the patients. “It
makes a huge difference for these people
just to have someone to talk to, someone
who isn’t part of the usual clinical setting,”
says Angelina Esparza, director of sur-
vivorship at the American Cancer Society,
which has launched naviga-
tors at 60 treatment facilities.
Freeman says the concept
might be adapted to other
chronic diseases like dia-
betes or mental illness. He
and his colleagues are hop-
ing to eventually use naviga-
tors to enroll more nonwhites into clin-
ical trials for cancer drugs. That’s
important not only to ensure that study
populations are representative of the
overall population but also because trial
participants often get better care and ac-
cess to potentially lifesaving treatments. 
Though he has been on the national
stage most of his career—he’s also cur-
rently senior adviser to the director of the
nci—Freeman still focuses on his pa-
tients in Harlem. “These are not statistics
for him,” says Harold Varmus, president
of Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer
Center (a founding partner of the Ralph
Lauren Center) and former director of
the National Institutes of Health. “He has
really lived this issue his entire career.” l

It’s not just kids who are ter-

A New Worry for
Cancer Patients
Two studies just out in the
Journal of Clinical Oncology
found that two breast cancer
treatments—radiation of the
left breast and the drug Her-
ceptin, which reduces the risk
of recurrence in certain
women—pose a danger to the
heart. Of 173 women who
took Herceptin for at least a
year, 28 percent showed
signs of heart failure. Still,
says study director Francisco
Esteva, an oncologist at M. D.
Anderson Cancer Center, the
benefits outweigh the haz-
ards for most women, in
whom heart symptoms could
be treated with drugs.
In the second study,
radiation to the
left breast was
linked to a high-
er risk of car-
diovascular dis-
ease and heart
attack—though
not of death. 
–Katherine Hobson
Better to Watch
Your Waistline
Body mass index, which cor-
relates weight with height,
is considered an indicator of
heart attack risk. But a new
paper in Lancet ana-
lyzing studies
going back 40
years finds
little tie be-
tween a high
bmi and
heart prob-
lems. Perhaps
reflecting the
crudeness of the
measure, most of the studies
showed that low-bmi pa-
tients had higher rates of
heart events, while over-
weight people had lower
rates. bmi has merit in
judging other risks, such as
diabetes, says Robert Eckel,
a noted obesity researcher at
the University of Colorado
School of Medicine. For
heart problems, he says, ex-
cess abdominal fat—a waist
size of 40 inches or more for
men, 35 inches for women—
may be a better warning
sign, “and it’s certainly easi-
er to understand.” –A.C.

T
he bird flu found in two wild swans in
Michigan during routine spot testing is
not the killer virus that has felled at least
140 people worldwide, federal officials were
quick to say last week. But the discovery of a
nonlethal variant of the H5N1 virus prompted
the feds to expand their wild-bird surveillance
from 39 states to all 50 by early September,
when millions of birds migrate south after
mingling all summer with their brethren from
Europe and Asia, where the deadly H5N1 bug
is endemic. U.S. poultry flocks haven’t had a
lethal outbreak of any bird flu since 2004.
Nonetheless, Mexico and South Korea last
week banned imports of American chicken.
If the virulent H5N1 does show up in the
United States, says Ron DeHaven, adminis-
trator of the U.S. Department of Agricul-
ture’s Animal and Plant Health Inspection
Service, “one of the most important mes-
sages we’re going to have to get out is that
the arrival of this particular virus does not
signal the beginning of a pandemic” that
could kill millions. That would require that
the flu virus mutate into a form that spreads
easily among humans. –Nancy Shute

M
aybe today’s parents had to
slog 10 miles in the snow to
get to school. But getting into
an elite college? Next to their
children’s chances, theirs was
a motorized snowmobile ride in the park.
In 1976, the University of Pennsylvania
received about 6,200 applications and ac-
cepted nearly 60 percent. Today’s high
schoolers face an uphill race: Penn re-
ceived 20,490 applications for the class of
2010. It accepted only 17 percent of them.
Today’s students can “make no pre-
sumptions,” says Lee Stetson, the school’s
dean of admissions. “The harsh reality is
that 80 percent of the students are ap-
plying to 20 percent of the colleges, and
that’s making it much more selective than
it maybe even needs to be,” he says.
Odds-on favorites. With
record numbers of young
people graduating from
high school and sending
out record numbers of
college applications, ad-
mission to America’s top
universities has never
been more competitive.
Yet teens needn’t fear
they’ll be denied higher
education, experts say: 84
percent of the nation’s
2,500 four-year colleges
accept 1 out of 2 candi-
dates, reports the Nation-
al Association for College
Admission Counseling.
Thanks to growth in pub-
lic universities and com-
munity colleges, the num-
ber of seats in classrooms
has just about kept pace
with demand. So anyone
who wants a college edu-
cation can get one.
The single most obvious reason for the
low acceptance rates at the top schools
is pure demographics. Sixty years ago,
a tidal wave of gis returned home from
World War ii with apparently one thing
on their minds. Twenty, even 40 years
later, their children produced a baby
boom of their own. This year, about 3.1
million members of that “echo boom”
graduated from high school, and that
wave is only beginning to crest. Each
year until 2009, the number of high
school graduates will keep growing by
about 60,000—the equivalent of 25
Penn freshman classes.
Yet the sheer growth in numbers is
just one factor in the higher rejection
rates. Another key reason is that the last
time this country gave birth to so many
teenagers, fewer of them wanted to go
to college. During the 1970s, only about
50 percent of recent high school grad-
uates enrolled in college. This time
around, about two thirds are pursuing
degrees. “A college degree seems to be
the minimum you’re going to need to
make your way up in society,” says
Charles Deacon, Georgetown’s under-
graduate admissions dean.
Multiple choice. Each of these college
wannabes also is filing many more ap-
plications than his or her parents once
did. The number of students applying to
three or more colleges has grown by 10
percentage points to 70 percent in the
past six years, the Higher Education Re-
search Institute reports.
The change is partly due to new tech-
nology that makes it possible, theoreti-
cally, to apply to as many as
299 colleges with the push
of a button. The Common
Application means that in-
stead of laboriously typing
different essays for each
school, students today can
hit many of their dream
schools in one shot. Think
that’s absurd? Meet 18-year-old Clair
“Baskin Robbins” Briggs of Silver Spring,
Md. She got her nickname last fall—“I ap-
plied to 31 colleges,” she explains, “and
they have 31 flavors.” 
It will only get easier to apply to more
colleges. The 1975 experiment by 15 pri-
vate schools to accept the same applica-
tion form and essays now enables quick
electronic transfer of transcripts and
teacher recommendations. Students like
the way the Common App makes it easy
for them to apply to schools they might
not have previously thought of. Admis-
sions officials like getting more applica-
tions, which allows them to select a more
diverse and high-powered student body.
Students are also applying to more

schools because they know
more; colleges have spent
the past 30 years perfecting
recruitment techniques. In
the 1920s, Harvard Presi-
dent Charles Eliot realized
he couldn’t enroll the best
students in the country if he
stuck with the usual crop of
boarding school grads, so he started the
first national recruitment drive. The idea
really caught on in the 1970s and ’80s
when a national mood of egalitarianism
inspired colleges to search for applicants
outside of their traditional narrow racial
and socioeconomic lines.
There were more pragmatic, some
might say cynical, motives as well. Before
the baby boom echo, there was a baby
bust. Between 1979 and 1993, the num-
ber of 18-year-olds declined
by 28 percent nationally and
by 40 percent in the college
hotbeds of New England
and the mid-Atlantic, says
Thomas Parker, Amherst
College’s dean of admis-
sions. “People started to say,
‘Wow, we can’t just sit here
in Cambridge or Williamstown or Am-
herst and expect people to come knock-
ing on our doors,’ ” Parker says. Wanting
fresh faces and needing to fill classroom
seats as well as university coffers, colleges
sent alumni on cross-country tours, spent
millions on brochure mailings, and fund-
ed scholarships, classes, majors, and fa-
cilities like state-of-the-art gyms to lure
more students.
Though the demographics turned in
their favor a decade ago, schools have
continued to recruit. After all, stronger
student bodies make a school look more
prestigious, inspiring alumni to donate
more. Even public schools have entered
the competition, offering incentives like
merit aid and specialized honors pro-
grams based on liberal arts models to try
to keep smart locals in their home state
and lure talented students away from
private schools. “The state universities
look pretty good,” says Georgetown’s
Deacon. “They are in their own way com-
peting, reversing the brain drain. There
is competition for top students beyond
simply the top 25 universities.”
Extra prep. This may be the sweetest
lesson of all: They want you just as badly
as you want them. 
One way for the colleges to win you
over is to play hard to get. According to
Deacon, schools that make applying the
easiest tend to be the ones with the steep-
est declines in admission rates. Mean-
while, those that do not send out 10,000
glossy fliers and do not accept the one-
click Common Application (Georgetown
does not) have seen admission rates re-
main stable. “It’s a marketing technique,”
says Deacon. “The tougher you are to get
into, the more it might seem you’re a bet-
ter school.” Knowing this can be the
smart applicant’s boon: The colleges that
show the most interest may not be the
ones that are the most interested.
Another marketing factor is a school’s
“yield,” or the proportion of students ad-
mitted in the spring who end up at-
tending in the fall. Like people, schools
want to be wanted. So they show the
most love to the students they think will
love them back. When she first started
applying, Clair Briggs had barely heard
of many of her 31 choices. But she did
know about some, like Claremont
McKenna College in California, an early
favorite. It must have shown. In the end,
her interest in Claremont turned into
Claremont’s interest in her. She will at-
tend in the fall. l

T
he University of La Verne sits on
26 acres of suburbia between the
city of Los Angeles and the moun-
tains. The college has just over
1,600 students, most of whom live in
three drab and boxy-looking dormito-
ries. A decade ago, one was exclusively
male, one female, and one coed. But
faced with a surge in women students
(who made up 65 percent of the student
body last year, up from 58 percent a
decade ago), the school had to convert
two thirds of the male facility for
women’s use. “Everyone knows guys are
scarce on this campus,” says Nick Solis,
a sophomore, who adds that the women
in his coed dorm have taken to using the
men’s room out of convenience.
Bathroom space is only one of the is-
sues that the spike in female enrollment
has forced La Verne to address. Admin-
istrators are searching for males to serve
as resident assistants, fill spots in stu-
dent government, and join student or-
ganizations. Put simply, the school needs
to lure, hook, and land more males.
These days, admissions officers around
the country are contemplating how to do
exactly that: find more qualified students
with the Y chromosome. And it’s not easy.
Females graduate from high school at a
slightly higher rate than
men. They are more likely to
forgo the workforce and
seek a college education, and
they are more likely to suc-
ceed once there: Just 33 per-
cent of men finish their 
degrees in four years, com-
pared with 40 percent of
women. All of which helps explain why
the percentage of women in higher edu-
cation has been steadily growing. From
rough parity in 1980, women made up 57
percent of the 16.6 million American 
college-goers in 2002, and the Depart-
ment of Education expects that percent-
age to increase at least through 2014.
That’s an affirmative. The root of the
gender imbalance can be found in the
early grades. “There’s no need to talk
about affirmative action for boys in uni-
versity admissions because by then it’s
too late,” says Tom Mortenson, an Iowa-
based education researcher who has
been watching the gender gap grow for
more than a decade. “We have to go way
back down the pipeline to find answers
and solutions.” Indeed, beginning in
those formative early years, girls watch
less television, play fewer sports, and are
far less likely to have behavioral prob-
lems. They are more likely
to participate in drama, art,
and music classes and far
less likely to be placed in
special education. Across
the board, girls study more,
score better, and graduate
in greater numbers. So

to colleges, many girls are better qual-
ified and more well-rounded than their
male peers. 
At first blush, the increase in college-
going females seems like good news, es-
pecially since a generation ago women
were barred from some of the country’s
best schools. It seems hard to believe
that many universities, including Boston
College, Johns Hopkins, the University
of Virginia, Brown, Dartmouth, Notre
Dame, and Harvard, weren’t fully coed-
ucational until the 1970s. But while
women have made dramatic progress,
men have not kept pace. In 2004, at 
two schools in the City University of 
New York system, for example, men
made up less than 30 per-
cent of the student body.
In colleges, and particu-
larly at small liberal arts
schools, females outnum-
ber males in both applications and en-
rollment. The shifting demographics
have produced many unexpected results:
Admissions officers are turning away
qualified female applicants in the inter-
ests of creating classes with gender par-
ity; schools are finding that female-dom-
inated campuses are less attractive for
both female and male applicants; and al-
ready researchers are pon-
dering the long-term impli-
cations of a shortage of suit-
ably educated peers for
women to marry. 
What the increase in fe-
males means for applicants
is tough to gauge, partly be-
cause admissions officers
are often loath to discuss the specifics of
their selection process, and they are
extra sensitive when it comes to issues of
preferential treatment for one group of
students at the expense of another.
While the Supreme Court did weigh in
on the question of affirmative action for
minority students—endorsing the use of
race as one of many elements in admis-
sions—it has not considered gender tar-
geting in admissions. 
That targeting, in practice, can come
down to something as simple as expect-
ed field of study. Women hoping to study
engineering might find themselves at an
advantage while others may not. Says
one admissions officer from a small mid-
western liberal arts college:
“God help the female Eng-
lish majors who apply to
this school.” 
Testosterone counts. Quali-
fied men, on the other hand,
can be so desired that col-
lege counselors have begun
advising some to “empha-
size their maleness.” Steven Goodman,
an independent college counselor for 18
years, now tells his male students to sub-
mit pictures or trumpet their sports ac-
tivities. “I also tell them to write about
themselves in great detail on their es-
says, which is something that female ap-
plicants are traditionally known for,” he
says. “Anything to catch an admissions
officer’s eye.”
But the applicants who need to worry
most about catching eyes are the girls.
As selective colleges try to maintain
some semblance of gender parity, it’s
more difficult for women to make the
cut, and that’s no secret to high school-
ers or their counselors. “We try to tell our

students that it’s . . . the re-
sult of women doing so well
in the past few decades. But
that’s not what a high school
senior wants to hear,” says
Kelly Oberle, a college coun-
selor at the Immaculate
Heart Academy, an all-girls
school in New Jersey. 
The extent to which gender affects ad-
missions depends on the school and the
year’s applicants. At the Ivies, for exam-
ple, the number of qualified male and fe-
male applicants each year is roughly the
same, and so is the acceptance rate for
each of the sexes. Yet the little-discussed
reality at many other selective schools is
that maintaining gender parity on cam-
pus is coming at the cost of turning away
more female applicants. Northwestern
University, for example, is 53 percent fe-
male, a rate essentially unchanged since
1997 when the acceptance rates for men
and women were both about 30 percent.
Last year, however, while the acceptance
rate for male students was 31 percent,
the acceptance rate for female students
was 28 percent. And in 2004, the num-
bers were even more dramatic: Only 26
percent of the female applicants got ac-
ceptance letters, compared with 34 per-
cent of males. Northwestern maintains
that it does not officially consider gen-
der in its criteria for admission; the gen-
der balance, it says, is de-
termined strictly by the
quality of the applicant
pool. “There is no pressure
placed on admissions staff
to maintain any ratio based
on sex, and our decisions
are made without regard to
gender,” says Keith Todd,
director of undergraduate admissions.
Northwestern is far from unique in
having rough parity but skewed accep-
tance rates. In 2004, for example, males
had a better shot than females at get-
ting in at William and Mary (43 percent
vs. 31 percent), Boston College (37 per-
cent vs. 29 percent), Pomona (24 
percent vs. 17 percent), and Tufts (30
percent vs. 25 percent). Females, mean-
while, had an easier time getting in at
tech schools. mit favored women in 
its admissions rate by 16 percentage
points, Carnegie Mellon University by
13 points, and California Institute of
Technology by 12 points.
It’s tough to fault colleges for trying
to maintain parity. The university ex-
perience, after all, is only partially
about academics, and anecdotal evi-
dence suggests that once a campus
reaches a ratio of, say, 60-40 women to
men, both females and males are less
likely to apply. “Frankly, students 
care about the dating scene on campus,
and no one wants to be
outnumbered,” says Bari
Norman, a former admis-
sions counselor at Bar-
nard College who now runs
mycollegecounselor.com.
That’s the reason that
some traditionally male-
dominated schools are rel-
ishing the influx of women.
Lafayette College in East-
on, Pa., has a strong engi-
neering program, a disci-
pline in which women have
been historically underrep-
resented. The all-male
school went coed in 1970
and has tried to attract
women ever since. Now,
Lafayette is nearing gender
parity, says Barry McCarty,
head of enrollment serv-
ices. “Applying students are
looking for a balanced en-
vironment, and the closer
we get to 50-50, the more
applications we receive.” 
Girls only? As it becomes more difficult
for women to gain admittance into
many schools, some foresee a renais-
sance in unisex education. “Gender 
equity is steady work,” says Judith
Shapiro, president of Barnard College,
founded as the sister institution of Co-
lumbia University. “Just because women
are more represented in higher ed today
doesn’t mean that their lot has improved
forever,” she says, pointing to the con-
tinuing wage gap between lifetime earn-
ings of men and women.
Often lost in the debate is the fact that
the gender ratio in higher education has
undergone major shifts before. Between
1900 and 1930, men and women were
equally represented in higher education,
largely because of teaching programs
that were dominated by women. (Indeed,
in 1926, women made up 59 percent of
the students at the University of La
Verne.) That parity ended abruptly after
World War ii, when the gi Bill dis-
proportionately benefited
males returning from mili-
tary service.
As the pendulum swings
back, Ana Liza Zell, the ad-
missions director at La Verne, says
schools may have to change the way
they think about themselves. “We ad-
vertise a coeducational experience,” she
says. “How much does the gender ratio
have to shift before it ceases to be that
product?” That is one of the questions
admissions officers and students will be
grappling with for years to come. l

ollege applications are your op-
portunity to tell your story—and
it’s your job to make sure that
story stands out. Sure, it can help
to have medaled in the Olympics or pub-
lished a novel (although not a plagiarized
one). But you don’t need a mind-blow-
ing accomplishment to get colleges to
notice your fabulousness. You just need
to prove you have made valuable contri-
butions inside the classroom and out—
and will continue to do so if accepted.
Why your transcript rules. A big part 
of your story is grades. So while your
transcript may seem to you like a list 
of A’s, B’s, and C’s (and you hope not too
many D’s), to people like Jess Lord, dean
of admission and financial aid at
Haverford College, it’s the way 
to find out who you are. “It’s
not just grades but increased
rigor of classes and growth
in a certain area,” he
notes. Just how impor-
tant is it? “On a scale
from 1 to 10, the tran-
script is a 10,” says
Jim Miller, Brown
University’s dean of
admissions.
Colleges look to see
that you’ve pushed
yourself. “If they’re not
planning to be science
majors but stuck with it 
at a high level, even if they’re
not getting the best
grade, that’s im-
pressive,” adds
Liz Woyczynski,
Case Western Re-
serve’s director of un-
dergraduate admission. 
All teacher recs are not the same. Rec-
ommendations provide context for those
choices and grades, so selecting your rec-
ommenders carefully is critical. Find
teachers who understand your learning
style and know what you can handle 
academically. In larger schools, where
teachers are loaded down with rec-
ommendations, make a “brag
sheet,” suggests Eliot Ap-
plestein, an independent
college counselor. This is
an opportunity to jog your teachers’
memories about the way you tutored
that classmate in chemistry or that kick-
butt presentation on Sri Lanka you gave
in social studies. But check with your
teachers first—they may prefer to write
the letter without your input.
Filling in the blanks. At this point, ad-
missions committees are deep into your
story, and they think they have a sense of
who you are—but maybe they’re off a bit.
Take a look at your own transcript
to see what kind of information
admissions officers might infer
from it. Is there a semester where
your grades plummeted? An ap
class you should have taken but
didn’t? Do you have a lot of ab-
sences? These things may raise red flags,
even if they happened for understand-
able reasons: a problem in the family, a
spat with a teacher, a scheduling conflict.
Guidance counselors should be aware of
these issues and explain them in their
recommendation letters to schools, but
you can’t always count on that. “If there’s
more to say, throw in an extra piece of
paper. Students should never feel like we
don’t want that information,” says Lord.
But usually a short paragraph will do.
Extracurricular.
Another big chunk of
your tale comes from
the activity section of
the application, on
which you list each of
your commitments,
along with how many
hours a week you
spend on them and positions held. The
common applications give you only
seven slots for “passions”—the
buzzword du jour for activities
that you’ve embraced, body
and soul. Only in rare situa-
tions should that be a prob-
lem. “If kids say they’ve
done 10 million things, col-
leges are going to think
they’re padding their ré-
sumé,” Applestein says. 
Community service res-
onates particularly well with
colleges. It’s not so much what
you do, though, but how passion-
ate you are about it. Letters from
adults associated with your activities
can give colleges a better sense of
what kind of effort you put out.
The politician whose campaign
you slaved for, the adviser for
your environmental club, your
boss at the rape crisis center—
these are people who can bring
your information to life.
Ace the essay. Up until now,
you’ve let lists and adults 
tell your story. With the essay
comes your chance to speak
for yourself. Sarah McGin-
ty, author of The Col-
lege Application
Essay,
says,
“Put a lot of
time into think-

as what you accomplish.
At Bryant University, we do more than educate you to perform
academically and professionally. We prepare you for life.

Hi, I’m David Oreck. It’s common knowledge that household dust carries
germs, pollen, dander, mold spores, bacteria – things you don’t want your 
family breathing in. That’s why I’ve created the 8-lb. Oreck XL Ultra. It’s the

traps 99.9% of all harmful allergens down to 0.3 microns. That’s 1/250th the
width of a human hair. (Bacteria measures
0.4 to 10 microns. Mold spores are 10 to
100 microns.) There’s never a cloud of dust
in your face, or foul odor with my XL

ing and chewing before you start writing.
Make a list of what your application al-
ready says about you. If you did well on
the sats, your scores show that. If you
know big words, your English grades
show that. If you’ve played soccer for
years, your coach’s letter will say that.
Augment what’s in the folder.”
Narrowing in on the right topic can
drive a kid bonkers, but McGinty says
there’s no reason to think
you can’t do this well: “If
you ask the average high
school student to pick a
scene from The Great
Gatsby and show how
that illustrates Gatsby’s
character, it’s easy for
them. Writing your essay
is no different, except you
don’t have to read a novel. You look
through your life and illuminate a mo-
ment.” McGinty suggests finding a time
your opinion changed. That kind of sit-
uation lends itself to explaining how you
think. Essays can be effective even when
they pinpoint something that might
seem insignificant in the grand scheme.
Bev Taylor, a New York-based independ-
ent counselor known as the Ivy Coach,
worked with a young woman who dis-
carded several failed ideas before writ-
ing about her lucky rubber-band ball and
how it connected her to her family and
friends. Her admissions letter from
Williams College included a rubber
band for her collection. One of Ap-
plestein’s students with average
grades and scores wrote his essay
about the day a classmate wrote a
derogatory statement about their Chi-
nese teacher on the blackboard while the
teacher was out of the room. “He got up
and told them how stupid that was and
erased it. He alienated himself from
some of his classmates, but it showed he
stood for something,” Applestein says.
“I was amazed at some of the schools
[he was accepted by], but this is the
kind of person schools want.”
The business of professional essay
editing—and, disturbingly, essay-buy-
ing—has grown tremendously in the
past few years. That’s why Emory
College Dean of Admission
Daniel Walls says, “The
voice should be of a 17- or
18-year-old student, not 
a 40-year-old parent.”
Michael Mills, the associ-
ate provost for univer-
sity enrollment at
Northwestern
University, says
that for all of the
scores. This practice will probably be-
come more common.
Interview. You can’t overestimate the
power of face time with an admissions
officer or another representative. “What
I look for is what they have to say about
what they do,” says Lord. “It’s great to see
someone get excited.”
The interview can be a good chance to
explain any blips in your record, and it
can prove you’re the kind of person
they’d want other students to strike up
a conversation with in the dining hall.
It’s also a chance to share bits about
yourself that didn’t fit anywhere else in
the application, like your hobby of read-
ing Russian literature. Taylor, who tells
her teens to train for the interviews by
answering her list of questions into a
tape recorder, instructs them to bring
an activity sheet (“I don’t like to call
them résumés when you’re 17”) to help
break the ice.
No college is expecting everyone to be
an extrovert, but if you clam up in front
of adults or can’t articulate your inter-
ests, the interview might not be such a
good idea, Taylor advises. “Some kids I
tell, ‘Don’t ask for it—don’t answer the
phone,’ ” she says. “One kid, I referred to
him as the blob. He just sat there. He
ended up doing very well, but he could
not interview.”
That avoidance approach could back-
fire, though, even if interviews are op-
tional. “A student from the suburbs of
Philly, we’d be upset if they don’t do it,”
explains Lord, whose Haverford campus
is outside Philadelphia. “If a student
from California can’t come, our inter-
pretation of that is different.” The same
can be true of alumni interviews or local
receptions—if you’re not making that ef-
fort, you can appear unenthusiastic
about the school.
Say it as if you mean it. It may seem
small, but that slip-up could keep you
from getting in. Every year, for instance,
Emory has a handful of applicants who
write that they’re excited about the
school of engineering, Walls says. The
problem? Emory doesn’t have one. “This
is a student who hasn’t
done the research
we expect. The
feeling is this stu-
dent has other schools
in mind,” he explains. Laura
Miller, college counselor at the
North Shore Hebrew Academy on
Long Island, asked the Univer-
sity of Pennsylvania admissions
office why a student who got into

complaints people may have about the
new writing portion of the sat, it allows
them to see an unedited sample of stu-
dents’ work. “Everyone has to stand and
deliver,” he says. This year, admissions
officers checked the writing section in a
few cases in which there was a discon-
nect between the essay and grades and

Yale didn’t make the cut at Penn’s school
of engineering. “In the short essay on
why do you want to go to Penn, he didn’t
mention engineering in his answer,” she
was told.
Do your homework. Your application is
your story up to year 18, and colleges
would like to see that you’ve planned the
next chapters with them, so do your re-
search. Tracy Brooks, associate direc-
tor of admissions at the College of
Wooster, checks if prospective students
know about the school’s senior inde-
pendent study project. “It matters,” she
says. Obviously, finding a school that’s a
good fit for you is in your best interest.
When you dig, you may realize that the
college with the dorm where everyone
speaks Esperanto and grows medicinal
herbs is the only place you can imagine
yourself. Or, you may stumble across the
work of a trailblazing classics professor
you’d love to study with. When explain-
ing to a school why you want to go, you
can say it as if you mean it when you have
reasons beyond liking the color of the
bumper sticker.
And that’s the way to a happy ending
in the Book of You. l

T
empted to throw up your hands in
confusion over the multiplicity of
colleges to choose from? Feel like
throwing darts at a wall papered
with all those brochures stuffing your
mailbox? In that case, you already know
that narrowing your wish list to a mere
handful of target, reach, and safety
schools is tough. But wait. Did someone
say a mere handful? 
Yes. Despite anecdotes of anxious stu-
dents applying to 20 schools or more, a
recent survey of 600 high-achieving high
school seniors conducted by the research
and marketing firm Lipman Hearne
found that the average number of col-
leges they applied to was just under four. 
Narrowing your list can
yield benefits that go be-
yond saving on application
fees. Although some stu-
dents think they’re raising
their odds by applying to a
dozen schools, they may
shortchange themselves by
diluting their efforts rather
than getting to know—and making their
interest known to—a smaller number of
schools.
So forget the darts. Get the facts, then
break down the process step by step.
STEP 1: Don’t get bogged down
in where you “should” apply.
Rather than searching for a
place that meets your pre-
conceived notions about
college, reframe what you’re
looking for as “one of many
good matches,” advises

Michael Popkin, a family therapist and
author who runs the website active
parenting.com. “There are many colleges
that [students] will be happy at and will
prepare them for a successful life.” 
Those schools aren’t necessarily the
most prestigious or the ones all your
friends are looking at. Although his fa-
ther encouraged him to apply to his alma
mater, Dartmouth, one student from a
public high school in central Pennsylva-
nia decided the Ivy League wasn’t for
him; he preferred a lower-pressure aca-
demic environment. Another public high
school student, from New York, felt so
strongly about supporting American
troops that he applied only to schools
that offered rotc.
STEP 2: Know thyself. For the majority of
high school students, even familiar-
sounding names (Big Ten, Ivy League,
Mom’s alma mater) “are just names
they’ve heard or pictures they’ve seen,”
says Mike Riera, head of Redwood Day
School in Oakland, Calif., and the author
of Staying Connected to Your Teenager.
By contrast, they do know about them-
selves. Students who take “a few hours
to think, talk, and write about” the
places, activities, and settings they enjoy,
the learning styles that suit them 
best, and the subjects that
motivate them begin to 
develop what Riera calls 
“an internal map” of what
they’re looking for.
The challenge, then, is to
find schools that value those
strengths. 
Maybe 
your
learning style is better suit-
ed to a work co-op program than sitting
in a lecture hall. Perhaps you need a
school that lets you explore different
areas before you commit to a major, or
your long-term goal is to work in gov-
ernment and you want a school with
strong political science and economics.
As to school size, Riera suggests think-
ing about whether you like to know most
of the students you’ll see or whether you
like being surrounded by lots of faces you
may meet or may never get to know.
As you explore your interests, you may
discover that what you originally thought
you were looking for isn’t what you want-
ed after all.
STEP 3: Identify a place to live. Think about
where you live now, where you’ve trav-
eled, and areas of the country you’ve en-
joyed—or did not. Do you want the urban
energy of a city or a small-town atmos-
phere? Is climate a factor? 
Are there outdoor activi-
ties you long to pursue? A
hiking and mountaineering
enthusiast from Connecti-
cut, for instance, applied to
schools in Colorado to be
close to western national
parks. A New York student
limited her applications to
schools with access to riding stables.
Another aspect to explore: How close-
ly do you wish to replicate the charac-
teristics of your high school? Did you
thrive at that very large—or very small—
school? Is it time for a change, or do you
want more of the same? 
Distance from home matters to some
students more than others. “Why go
across the country when there are fab-
ulous schools in close driving distance?”
Joy Silberg and her husband, Richard,
of Baltimore asked their three daugh-
ters. All three ended up in a different
type of school in a different area, one
in a southern town (the University of
Virginia, in Charlottesville), another in
New York City (Barnard), and the third
in the Pennsylvania countryside (Frank-
lin and Marshall).
STEP 4: Information, please. Getting facts
about colleges is probably easier now

than ever before. But brochures or virtual
tours are not a substitute for a campus
visit. Indeed, visiting the college campus
was the most commonly cited factor in
determining where the students in the
Lipman Hearne survey applied. (Seven-
ty-four percent mentioned it; factors such
as talking with a student at the school,
a brochure, friends, and Mom’s advice
were mentioned by 52 to 59 percent.
Dads were close behind at 49 percent.) 
The reason that “college visits can be
real helpful for discovering what’s com-
fortable,” says Popkin, is that “until you
put feet on the ground, you won’t neces-
sarily know.” Riera similarly recalls
many students who returned from a col-
lege visit and said, “ ‘I know I want to go
to that college’—because the comfort
level is there. It feels familiar, what they
had actually described as wanting.” Even
preliminary visits before applying can
help crystallize types of schools by size,
location, or departmental strengths. “If
the school resonates with you, there’s
probably a decent shot that you will res-
onate with the school as well.”
STEP 5: Be realistic while maintaining per-
spective. Look at your high school profile
from the point of view of a college ad-
missions officer, suggests Holly Thomp-
son, a former college admissions officer
and high school college guidance coun-
selor who is now a high school teacher in
Palo Alto, Calif. For the most selective
schools, especially, she says, “it is use-
ful to step back and say: ‘Well, there are
22,000 applicants,’ and rather than let-
ting that paralyze you, view it with a cool
eye and evaluate more objectively.”
Just as important to achieving a real-
istic perspective is putting the admis-
sions process into a larger context—your
life. Shortly after her own son was born,
Thompson says, she remembers reading
the “great recommendations” for a young
man applying to Stanford, where she
then worked, and asking herself, “What
more could a parent want for a son in
terms of his qualities?” But the applicant
“didn’t have all the pieces pulled togeth-
er” that the college was looking for, and
it rejected him.
The lesson? Colleges apply “a very nar-
row test, with a very specific set of cri-
teria,” she says. Rather than letting the
list of colleges to which you apply define
you, define for yourself who you are, and
let the list follow from that. l

Dear Computer: Help Me Pick a School


Maui is famous for its breathtaking tropical scenery, near
perfect weather, and a diverse mix of friendly people. Visitors
come from around the world to bask in idyllic surroundings
and explore landscapes of incomparable beauty and variety.
Scientists flock to Maui and the other islands of Hawai‘i to
study unique ecosystems and natural phenomena found
nowhere else. Who could imagine a better place to learn, find
inspiration and enjoy an incomparable college experience?
Combining an ideal location with a track record of aca-
demic excellence and innovation, Maui Community College
(MCC) offers a well-rounded education, both inside and out-
side the classroom. Whether you are an undergraduate
student living on Maui, Moloka‘i or Lana‘i; a U.S. mainland
student seeking a multicultural educational experience; or an
international student with the desire to study abroad, MCC
offers liberal arts transfer curricula to baccalaureate degrees.
The college also offers certificates and associate degrees in
accounting, business careers, culinary arts, dental assisting,
hospitality industry, sustainable technology and a range of
other excellent academic options in an island setting. It is the
only community college in the University of Hawai‘i (UH) 
system to offer a four-year degree, the Bachelor of Applied
Science in Applied Business and Information Technology. In
addition, the University of Hawai‘i Center, Maui delivers an
array of bachelor’s and master’s degree programs and profes-
sional certificates from UH system campuses at Manoa, West
Oa‘hu and Hilo. 
Chancellor Sakamoto asserts, “With the combination of
the baccalaureate-degree granting University of Hawai‘i Center
and Maui Community College, we are the
University of Hawai‘i on Maui.”  Moreover,
longstanding relationships with employers
throughout Maui County facilitate coopera-
tive education and internships at Maui’s
premier resorts, with the County of Maui and
in the high-tech community. As an example,
a partnership between the MCC Electronics and Computer
Engineering Technology program and the UC Santa Cruz Center
for Adaptive Optics provides MCC students with internships at
the Maui Research and Technology Center (MRTC). Interns are
placed at the Maui High Performance Computing Center, Pacific
Disaster Center and a growing number of other high-tech projects
at the MRTC and the astronomical observation assets atop
Haleakala, one of the world’s best celestial viewing sites.
The college is committed to studying and applying environ-
mentally and institutionally sustainable strategies. The Sustainable
Living Institute of Maui (SLIM), located on MCC’s campus, works
with Maui’s largest landowner, Maui Land & Pineapple Co., and
with EARTH University in Costa Rica and the Royal Institute of
Technology in Stockholm, Sweden, to study and promote sus-
tainable agriculture, social equity and heritage, and other related
issues. A Leadership in Environment and Energy Design (LEED),
400-bed student housing project is currently scheduled for
completion in summer 2007. Some units may be available in
spring next year. Furthermore, the present Student Center is
being renovated to become a wellness and fitness center.
With a significant campus makeover since 2000, the college
hosted the World Hula Congress, the National Marine Educators
Association and the Islands of the World IX Conference over
the past year. The latest “Islands…” summer conference
brought world renowned scholars of the International Small
Islands Studies Association to the campus to discuss economic,
ecological and social issues affecting small islands.
“While working to preserve the best of what we have,”
says Sakamoto, “MCC students are also embracing responsi-
bility and the technologies of the future. Maui Community
College students are people who want to make a difference 
in the world.”

o you hover low to the ground,
micromanaging your college-
bound kid’s every move? Or, in
contrast to so-called helicopter
parents, do you assume your kids need
so little oversight you become what ed-
ucator Michael Popkin calls a satellite
parent? Then again, you might think
your chosen distance is just right—even
if your kids wildly disagree.
To identify an air zone both you and
your kids can share, take the following
quiz. It beats a chopper crash—or getting
lost in space.
1
MEET THE PARENTS 
(COLLEGE-PREP VERSION) 
Your high schooler and the guidance coun-
selor set a meeting to discuss college pos-
sibilities. You’re invited, too. You:
A. Assume this means you’re welcome
to attend every meeting, then wonder
why the guidance counselor isn’t ec-
static when you announce where we’re
applying, even as you hand over a pro-
fessionally assembled press kit for
your kid. 
B. Blow off the appointment. “If you’re
mature enough to go to college, you’re
mature enough to make decisions
without me.”
C. R.S.V.P. and listen like a fly on the
wall. Voice opinions in moder-
ation: The focus should be your
child, not you.
ANSWER: “We’re applying” (A) sets off
an automatic “you’re flying too low for
comfort” signal. But being totally
hands off (B) risks shutting the door at
a time your child needs to know you’re
available. To find a balance (C), Judy
Hingle, director of professional devel-
opment at the National Association for
College Admission Counseling, sug-
gests imagining you’re looking for a
job, and your family is advising you. “A
light bulb should go on,” she says.
2
WELCOME TO REALITY 
(NOT THE TV VERSION)
Your high schooler has identified schools
whose programs fit her interests and whose
admissions profiles match hers. You look at
her list and:
A. Hit the roof. “Don’t tell me you’re
not good enough for an Ivy!” you fume.
B. Shrug. “All those school brochures
look the same to me.”
C. Are impressed by a list that shows
thoughtful self-evaluation, with a
range of schools based on interests and
academic record.
ANSWER: Helicopter parents may fly
low to the ground, but their expecta-
tions can be overly high (A), while
satellites distance themselves (B) from
the application process. A realistic par-
ent looks objectively (C) at the stu-
dent’s academic record—including
what it might look like through the
lens of each school. 
3
THE COLLEGE OF WHOSE
DREAMS?
Time to visit campuses. Your role is to:
A. Plan the itinerary, cramming in as
many schools as possible. At each cam-
pus, inundate the student guide with
questions you just know your son
won’t think to ask.
B. Beg off the trip; it would mean miss-
ing your weekend golf game.
C. Offer to go, but don’t insist if he
prefers doing it himself. If you do go,
allow your son to tell you what he
thinks before sharing your thoughts.
ANSWER: You’ll get no extra credit for
monopolizing the tour guide (A) but
will probably succeed in embarrassing
your child. Still, visiting campuses as a
family can be fun. So rather than ex-
cuse yourself (B), why not add a golf
match to the mix? However you
arrange the trip, let your kids do the
talking (C), says Hingle. 
4
COACHING 101
(TEST-PREP VERSION)
It’s junior year, the start of SAT/ACT sea-
son. Though it’s still early in the year, you:
A. Worry. True, your child has taken
test-prep courses since middle school,
but is that enough? 
B. Tune out. It’s just another test.
C. Talk to your child about schools he’s
considering and the tests
they require. Use that

as a guide to discuss whether he needs
help preparing.
ANSWER: For middle schoolers and high
school sophomores, pursuing interests
is a better use of time than sat review
courses (A). But ignoring the tests (B)
may not be realistic, given that most
colleges require or recommend the
sat or act. Nonetheless, think
about review courses (C) “only
once you know what areas
you need to strengthen,” says
Holly Thompson, a former
college admissions officer.
5
ADVICE WITHOUT
CONSENT: LET ME
ASSAY YOUR ESSAY!
Application deadlines loom.
Your daughter has completed
the essay. Your job is to:
A. Rewrite it completely, ac-
cording to what you think the col-
lege wants to hear.
B. Say, “Finally!”
C. Offer congratulations—and ask if
she’d like you to proofread.
ANSWER: Proofreading (C) is a fine idea.
So is breathing a sigh of relief (B). On
the opposite extreme (A), “admissions
officers can spot an essay written by a
hired gun” from tone as well as con-
tent, says Katy Rinehart, who spent 14
years as an admissions officer at
Hampshire College. 
6
IF THE DEADLINES DON’T KILL
YOU, WILL THE REJECTIONS?
It’s April: Two target schools said yes and
two reach schools said no, while your
child’s No. 1 choice offered a place on the
wait list. Your reaction:
A. The school screwed up! You place
calls to everyone on the wait-list school
staff you can think of to lobby on your
child’s behalf.
B. “Get used to rejection, kid. This is
life.”
C. Help your child recognize that even
though she may feel disappointed, she
still has options, and life does go on.
ANSWER: The impulse to protect our
children from pain (A) may be under-
standable, says Rinehart, but “I don’t
know of a single admissions decision
that has been changed because of an
angry parent call.” What parents can
do is present a model of how to handle
disappointment: not with hard-knocks
cynicism (B) but with a measured
overview (C) of what happened and
what comes next. Negative decisions
may seem arbitrary, says Rinehart,
“but your kid will be in much better
shape” if you help him see he “can still
go off and have a good experience.”
7
DOLLARS AND CENTS OR 
THE MONEY MIND MELD
And now comes news of each school’s fi-
nancial package—or lack thereof. You
start crunching the numbers and declare:
A. “If we’re paying, we choose the
school—not your first choice but ours.”
B. “Which school’s cheapest? We have
our beach house to keep up!”
C. “Let’s look at the numbers together,
so we can talk about the pros and cons
of each.”
ANSWER: “When seniors get to April
and say their parents won’t pay a
school’s tuition,” says Thompson, “I
think: Why didn’t they have this con-
versation last fall?” Discussions should
include budget parameters (B); who’s
paying (A); availability of scholarships
or financial aid; and how location
(near vs. far) affects costs. That will
make college part of an ongoing con-
versation that teaches your child about
financial planning, family decision
making, and fiscal responsibility (C).
8
IT DEPENDS ON HOW YOU
DEFINE GOODBYE
Your child is in his new dorm room; it’s
time for you to:
A. Move into your new house, minutes
from campus. 
B. Turn your son’s room into your den.
C. Do the math: College semesters are
shorter than those of most high
schools; add up Thanksgiving, win-
ter, spring, and summer breaks, plus
long weekends, and you’ll have lots of
chances to be together.
ANSWER: Separation anxiety is un-
derstandable, but if you’re not
able to tolerate time and dis-
tance apart (A), how can you
teach your kids to do so? Yet
transitions take time, and an
abrupt makeover of your
child’s room (B) sends the
message he really can’t come
home again. A middle
ground means understanding
that dropping kids off at col-
lege is not the same as drop-
ping out of each other’s lives (C).
9
ASK NOT FOR WHOM 
THE CELLPHONE RINGS
Your daughter’s being away at college
hasn’t made such a difference. Espe-
cially since:
A. You’re her personal alarm clock,
calling to wake her for class. And E-
mail makes it easier than ever to edit
her papers!
B. “I didn’t see her that much when she
lived here, either.”
C. We stay in touch via E-mail and cell-
phone, at least once a week.
ANSWER: Daily calls and E-mails don’t
necessarily constitute helicopter par-
enting; frequency of checking in de-
pends on family closeness and commu-
nication style (C). But when calls and
E-mails cross the line into micro-
managing (A), you risk creating a
codependency. Disconnecting alto-
gether (B) may save cellphone bills,
but you lose something more impor-
tant: your relationship.
10
TO BUTT IN OR NOT TO
BUTT IN
My son sounded so blue on the phone.
Maybe I should:
A. Head to his college to fix the prob-
lem. Should we think about transfer-
ring to another school?
B. Remind him he’s the one who want-
ed to leave home.
C. Wait and see; give him time to find
his way before barging in.
ANSWER: “When your kid has a problem
in college,” says Mike Riera, author of
Staying Connected to Your Teenager,
“90 percent of the time the right re-
sponse is ‘I’m not sure what the answer
is, but you’re resourceful, and I think
you’ll work it out.’ ” (C) That doesn’t
mean you should ignore his mood (B)
any more than you should try a quick-fix
transfer (A). “Growing pains of first se-
mester almost certainly pass,” Riera ad-
vises. But listen up for the 10 percent
chance that something is amiss. l

de Havenon’s senti-
ments about a gap
year, which some edu-
cators have long rec-
ommended. Harvard
Admissions Dean Wil-
liam Fitzsimmons, for
example, says taking
time off helps students
refocus and recharge
for the rigors of col-
lege—and also fosters
their emotional and in-
tellectual maturity.
New experiences. Parents often worry
that students will “lose their edge” if
they delay school, Fitzsimmons says, or
that the siren song of the real world will
lure them away from higher education.
If anything, the opposite may be true.

dam de Havenon was a bright
student in high school, but that
wasn’t obvious on his transcript.
Just one of 12 colleges accepted
him, and as his freshman year at Colby
approached, he says, “my parents real-
ized I wasn’t really going to take advan-
tage of the money they were going to
spend. When they brought up the idea
of a year off, I jumped for it.” 
Instead of heading to campus that fall,
de Havenon split a 12-month hiatus be-
tween teaching in rural Kenya and work-
ing in Australia, including a stint as a
park ranger. “By the end of that year,” he
says, “my attitude toward going to col-
lege had changed 180 degrees.”

The Credibility in
Your Gap Year
AFTER HIGH SCHOOL, BEFORE COLLEGE
SCOTT GOLDSMITH—AURORA FOR USN&WR
Tiana Wong restored murals

there’s no guarantee that every student
can take one. But many colleges will
grant incoming students a deferral if
they have a good reason and a plan for
what they’ll do. Harvard goes a step fur-
ther; it raises the option in its accep-
tance letters and, in some cases, insists
on it. Academics-oriented Tiana Wong
of Lexington, Mass., never considered
postponing college until Harvard of-
fered her that choice or nothing. At the
last minute, she found a position in
Boston helping with urban restoration
for the service program City Year. “I’m
so lucky this is the opportunity I de-
cided to take,” she says.
What students do depends on their
interests and their budget (box). The
most valuable thing many students may
do with their time off is hone skills in
a foreign language, Gilpin says. 
Purpose. Educational consultants such
as Gilpin and Gail Reardon of Boston-
based Taking Off can help families plan
a gap year. Their fees, often about
$2,000, exclude the costs of organized
programs, which can run as high as a
year’s tuition at a private college if the
gap year involves academics or foreign
travel. But the year doesn’t have to cost
anything at all. 
Some who have done it claim that
taking a gap year helped them reapply
to a college that previously turned them
down. But Rae Nelson, coauthor of The
Gap-Year Advantage (St. Martin’s Grif-
fin), cautions, “Most professionals
don’t recommend doing [a gap year]
just to position yourself and improve
your résumé. There has to be a greater
sense of purpose.” l

ou’ve got sat questions: How important is the essay
section? What’s the deal with those incorrect test
scores the College Board reported? When should 
I start studying? Fortunately, we have answers—
and they’re not multiple choice. 
Given the recent flap over the College Board’s incorrect scor-
ing of some 4,600 SAT exams, how worried should
I be? Nearly 1.5 million students took the
sat last year, so odds are your score will
be fine. But since the cause of the
glitch has not been clearly identified,
the College Board’s promise of bet-
ter quality control isn’t all that re-
assuring. “There’s more oversight
in the food we feed our pets than in
the oversight we give our tests,”
says Robert Schaeffer, public edu-
cation director of the nonprofit
group FairTest. That said, unless
your scores differ wildly from
your psat, there’s little reason
to panic. If you still want
to make sure your
score is accurate, the
College Board will re-
score your multiple-choice
answers by hand for $50.
For $24 you can request
your answers along with the
questions and the correct
answers to your test (details
at collegeboard.com).
Do I need a prep course? What
are the benefits of group ses-
sions versus tutoring? Unless
you’re extremely self-disciplined or a rare soul who enjoys
standardized tests, a little outside motivation may help. One-
on-one tutoring is the crème de la crème of prep, but group
sessions can be effective, too. To figure out what’s best for you,
take a practice test and check average scores at your colleges
of choice. “If your score is too low, your test prep should match
your parents’ wallet and your learning style,” says Schaeffer of
FairTest. High-scoring students aiming to fine-tune skills may
find private sessions more valuable, while students in the low
to middle ranges can make significant strides even in a group.
How early should I begin preparing? Starting the night before
the exam won’t get you very far, but weekly practice tests in
your freshman year aren’t necessary either. For most students,
the summer before junior year is the optimal time to begin
practicing for the psat. “The new sat has more content, and

so simply more familiarity, more practice, is going to make stu-
dents feel more comfortable,” says Ned Johnson, president of
PrepMatters, a Maryland-based test prep firm. “Just so long
as kids don’t burn out and so long as it doesn’t compromise
their academics.”
What about this new essay section? Are colleges taking it serious-
ly yet? The scoring system for the writing section is somewhat
inconsistent and subjective, so most colleges are looking more
closely at the verbal and math scores. Nevertheless, in case
your prospective college takes the essay section into consid-
eration, you should prepare. The best bet for a high score?
Have a strong and focused point of view. Tell a story. Most im-
portant, the text doesn’t have to read like Proust. “Students
can have spelling errors and miss a few commas
and still have a great score,” says Drew
Deutsch, vice president of the Princeton Re-
view. “Graders only spend about two minutes
looking at each essay, so the essay
writing skills that your English
teacher is looking at are dif-
ferent than the essay writ-
ing skills on the sat.”
Any special foods I should
eat or avoid on test day?
You’re facing four hours
of multiple-choice ques-
tions, so leave the Froot
Loops on the shelf and
avoid a midtest sugar
crash. The ideal break-
fast will stabilize your
blood sugar and
give you enough
fuel for the dura-
tion, says nu-
trition 
ex-
pert Joy Bauer. Look for a mix
of slow-release carbs and low-fat
proteins, like eggs with whole-grain
toast or peanut butter on a whole-wheat eng-
lish muffin. This isn’t the morning to overdose on caffeine.
Bring a bottle of water to the test, along with high-energy
snacks like nuts, string cheese, or a granola bar.
What strategies should I remember going into the test? Forget about
memorizing vocabulary flashcards that morning. When you
put pencil to paper, relax and pace yourself according to your
ability. Remember, wrong answers are penalized, so unless
you’ve been racking up top scores on practice tests, it’s prob-
ably wise to skip the last and toughest questions in each sec-
tion. “It’s really a test of mental stamina as much as a test of
knowledge,” says Maryland high schooler Josh Lieberman,
who focused his way to an 800 math, 800 verbal, and 730 writ-
ing score on the sat in his junior year this spring.
The College Board’s recent report of an expected 5-point drop in av-
erage math and verbal scores has universities worried. What gives?
Scores have dropped slightly, but the reality is the new sat
is just more grueling. The good news is the slide in scores is
minor, amounting to one or two more missed questions. And
every student faces the same increased degree of difficulty. “In-
dividual students shouldn’t worry,” says Deutsch, “because
if one student’s score went down, so did another’s.” l

International accreditation. You’ll be hiring a graduate who integrates the Jesuit philosophy of 
excellence into all they do, who shows concern for the individual and makes the world a better

AACSB accreditation — standards that require a commitment to continuous improvement and 
high performance. 
Less than one-third of U.S. business schools and less than 10 percent of business schools worldwide

have plenty of time to apply elsewhere. 
The real dilemma is applying to one
school early decision, which is binding:
If accepted, you agree to enroll. The pros:
The number of applicants is typically
small, so you have a good chance of get-
ting noticed. Plus, applying early decision
sends a strong message to a college that
you are serious about attending it above
all others. “That’s hard to measure, but it
counts with admissions officers,” says
Sally Rubenstone, senior college coun-
selor at Collegeconfidential.com.
Money matters. Early decision, though,
raises tough questions. Is the college the
best fit for you? Make sure you’ve looked
at enough schools to be certain. “Deci-
sions are made in haste,” says Zola
Dincin Schneider, director of the College
Advisory Service in Chevy Chase, Md.
“There’s a lot of parental pressure, and
most students at this age don’t have a
good grasp of who they are yet.”
Do you have the qualifications? These
are as rigorous as for regular admission.
Take a good look at grades and sat scores
to be sure you’re a viable candidate.
Is money an issue? You can’t be con-
cerned about finding the cheapest school
or the most competitive scholarship pro-
gram. Most colleges contend that early
decision doesn’t affect the amount of aid
you’re offered; the trouble is you have no
bargaining power. If your main criteri-
on is going to be money, you will prob-
ably need offers from multiple schools. 
Finally, is this college your best shot
at getting in early decision? What if your
second choice is less selective but you’d
be just as happy there? Maybe that’s
where your application should go.
There can be a happy ending. Take

Nonrestrictive plans
REGULAR DECISION. You submit an
application, typically by early Janu-
ary, and receive a decision in early
April. You can apply to other col-
leges and wait until May 1 to accept.
ROLLING ADMISSION. Applications
reviewed when received. Decisions
made throughout admission cycle. 
EARLY ACTION. You apply early, usu-
ally by November 1, and hear back
between mid-December and Febru-
ary. You don’t have to accept.
Restrictive plans
EARLY DECISION I. You commit to a
first-choice institution. If you get in
and the financial aid package is sat-
isfactory, you are required to enroll.
Colleges ask that you have only one
early decision application pending
at a time. If admitted early decision,
you must withdraw any other appli-
cations. Application deadline: Usu-
ally November 1. Notification: mid-
to-late December. In general, an
enrollment deposit is due two to
three weeks after acceptance.
EARLY DECISION II. Some colleges
have two rounds of early decision.
Second-round deadlines are 
in January, with mid-February 
notification.
SINGLE-CHOICE EARLY ACTION. A few
ultraselect colleges restrict early-ac-
tion applicants to a single choice.
The expectation is that you do not
apply early elsewhere until after
you hear back (confusing exception:

Bad Habits
Pregaming. Gathering to drink alcohol
before making a party pilgrimage to
drink more alcohol. Also known as
“priming.”
Beer pong. A game in which two teams
toss Ping-Pong balls into cups of
beer. Land a ball, and your opponent
must drain the cup. The drunkest
team loses!
Edward 40-hands. The act of taping a
40-ounce bottle of beer to each hand
and then attempting to consume both.
Fake. Falsified driver’s license that says
you’re 21.
Walk of shame. The morning journey
made by those too inebriated or wanton
to have made it home the night before.
Sex and Sexuality
Gender neutral. A person, place, or thing
that is genderless. College bathrooms,
for example, are sometimes open to all.
LGBTQ. Umbrella term for lesbian, gay,
bisexual, transgender, and queer stu-
dent groups and their allies.
Heteroflexible. Someone flexible in sexu-
al preferences.
Facebook stalker. One who shameless-
ly searches for potential lovers on
Facebook, then strategically uses info
on their profiles
to meet and se-
duce them.
Libe date. The ar-
chaic yet still 
vibrant tradition
of going to the 
library for a 
study date.
Sexile. If your
roommate’s getting
busy, you’d better
get busy finding
somewhere else to
sleep. Or be doomed
to a night of hallway
roaming.
Academic ABCs
First-year seminar. A course designed to
help students adjust to college.
“Response paper” or “reading notes.”
Short assignment to prove you’ve done
reading for a class. Sources say drop a
few character names, pretend to be
angry or passionate about some issue,
and you’ve got yourself a check plus.
Though, of course, you should do 
the reading!
WID. A course in, say, science or history
that teaches you how to “write in the
discipline”—i.e., tailor your papers to
the subject matter.
TA or TF. Grad student teaching assis-
tant or fellow who leads “sections” that
meet apart from lectures or grades pa-
pers while your professor relaxes and
thanks heaven for tenure.
Coasting. A class so straightforward
(aka a “blow-off class”), you can put
your mind and discipline on cruise
control and still get a good grade.
Rocks for jocks. Allegedly easy geology
class that jocks take to get a no-sweat
science credit. Warning: It can actually
be hard!
Victory lap. When four years just
aren’t enough to earn a diploma,
some go for the five-year plan.

By Robert J. Morse and Samuel Flanigan
C
ertainly, the college experience consists of a host of
intangibles that cannot be reduced to mere numbers.
But for prospective students and their families, the
U.S. News rankings provide an excellent starting
point because they offer the opportunity to judge the rela-
tive quality of institutions based on widely accepted indi-
cators of excellence. You can compare different schools’
numbers at a glance on the rankings tables, and looking at
unfamiliar schools that are ranked near schools you know
can be a good way to broaden your search. 
Combined with college visits, input from counselors, 
interviews, and your own judgment,
the rankings can be a powerful tool 
in your quest to choose the right col-
lege for you. 
The U.S. News rankings system rests
on two pillars. It relies on quantitative
measures that education experts have
proposed as reliable indicators of aca-
demic quality, and it’s based on our non-
partisan view of what matters in edu-
cation. The statistical indicators include
input measures that reflect a school’s
student body, its faculty, and its finan-
cial resources, along with outcome
measures that signal how well the insti-
tution does its job of educating students.
Fifteen factors. Schools are first cate-
gorized by mission and, in some cases,
by region. Next, we gather data from
each college for up to 15 indicators of
academic excellence, including peer as-
sessment among academics; gradua-
tion and retention (average six-year
graduation and freshman retention
rates); faculty resources (percentage of
classes with fewer than 20 students
and with 50 or more students, average
faculty salaries, proportion of profes-
sors with the highest terminal degree
in their fields, student-faculty ratio,
proportion of faculty who are full
time); student selectivity (entering
class standardized test scores, accept-
ance rates, high school class standing);
financial resources per student; aver-
age alumni giving rate; and graduation
rate performance (which measures the
difference between a school’s six-year
graduation rate for the class that en-
tered in 1999 and the predicted rate for
that class after controlling for spend-
ing and student aptitude). 
Each factor is assigned a weight that
reflects our judgment about how much
a measure matters. Finally, the colleges
in each category are ranked against
their peers, based on their composite
weighted scores. Most of the data come from the colleges—
and U.S. News makes a great effort to ensure accuracy. This
year, 94 percent of schools returned statistical surveys to
U.S. News. We obtained missing data from sources such
as the American Association of University Professors, the
National Collegiate Athletic Association, the Council for Aid
to Education, and the U.S. Department of Education’s Na-
tional Center for Education Statistics. Data that did not
come from this year’s survey are footnoted. Estimates may
be used when schools failed to report particular data points.
A more detailed explanation of our methodology and other
information on the rankings can found on the Web at 
www.usnews.com/collegerankings. l

What are National 
Universities? 
To rank colleges and uni-
versities, U.S. News first as-
signs schools to a group of
their peers, based on cate-
gories developed by the
Carnegie Foundation for
the Advancement of Teach-
ing in 2000. Those in the
National Universities
group are the 248 Ameri-
can universities (162 public
and 86 private) that offer a
wide range of undergradu-
ate majors as well as mas-
ter’s and doctoral degrees;
some emphasize research.
A list of the top 50 public
universities is on Page 115.
In each category, data on
up to 15 indicators of aca-
demic quality are gathered
from each school and tabu-
lated. Schools are ranked
within categories by their
total weighted score. (Spe-
cialty schools and those
with enrollments below
200 are not ranked.) More
information on the 1,400-
plus colleges we survey is
available at our website
and in our America’s Best
Colleges guidebook.

So who has the power to change that?
CHEVRON is a registered trademark of Chevron Corporation.

©2006 Chevron Corporation. All rights reserved.
Because of surging economies in the developing world and
continued growth among the industrialized nations, global
energy use is climbing. As a result, supplies are tight. Prices
are rising. And energy users are calling for viable alternatives.
The good news is we’ve got a huge source of alternative energy
all around us. It’s called conservation, and it’s the lowest cost
new source of energy we have at hand. A reduction of just 5%
of global energy use would save us the equivalent of over 
10 million barrels of oil a day. Clearly, saving energy is like
finding it. So how do we do it?
Incorporating energy efficient technology into new construction
could reduce consumption by 40%. Governments and
businesses must reduce their own energy use and promote
conservation to their citizens and employees. Further improvements
in fuel efficiency will play a crucial role, too. And the average
person wields incredible power when it comes to conserving
energy, from driving slower to switching to more efficient
home appliances.
Of course, not only does using less energy mean there’s more
fuel to go around, it also means fewer greenhouse gas emissions.
The fact is, if everyone began conserving today, we’d see
results immediately.  We’ve taken some of the steps needed to
get started but we need your help to get the rest of the way.
Conservation Facts:
If everyone reduced their driving 
speed from 65 to 55mph,we’d save
three million gallons of gas a day.
•
Replacing one incandescent
lightbulb with a compact fluorescent
lamp would save 500 pounds of coal 
and over a 1/2 ton of CO2 emissions.
•
If just one in 10 homes used 
ENERGY STAR
®– qualified appliances,
the environmental benefit would 
be like planting 1.7million new 
acres of trees. 
Americans spend over one million dollars
on energy every minute.
Chevron Steps Taken:
Saving our own energy:
- Since 1992, Chevron has improved energy
efficiency by 24%
- We use cogeneration technology at our
refineries to produce additional electricity
from otherwise wasted energy
Saving other people’s energy:
Chevron Energy Solutions is a separate, proven
business dedicated to energy efficiency.
Success stories include:
- Improvements that will lower the Northern CA
postal service’s electricity spending by 46%
- Helping the U.S. government save taxpayers
$151 million while reducing greenhouse gas
emissions by an expected 1.5 million tons

Looking for a school where you can start learning about
business? U.S. News surveyed deans and senior faculty at
undergraduate business programs accredited by the Associ-
ation to Advance Collegiate Schools of Business. Partici-
pants were asked to rate the quality of programs they are 
familiar with on a scale of 1 (marginal) to 5 (distinguished).
The rankings are based solely on this peer survey; 45 per-
cent of those surveyed responded. Deans and faculty were
also asked to nominate the best programs in specialty areas;
the five schools receiving the most mentions in each appear.
Note: Peer assessment survey conducted by Synovate.
To be ranked in a specialty, a school must have either
a program or course offerings in that subject area.

Think your future lies in engineering? On this page, you’ll
find the U.S. News rankings of undergraduate programs ac-
credited by the Accreditation Board for Engineering and
Technology. The rankings are based solely on a peer survey of
deans and senior faculty that asked them to rate each pro-
gram they are familiar with on a scale from 1 (marginal) to 5
(distinguished). Students who prefer a program focused on
undergraduates can use the first list below of top programs at
schools whose terminal degree is the bachelor’s or master’s.
Beneath that is the list of programs at schools that award doc-
torates, which often means a wider range of offerings at the
undergraduate level. Forty-nine percent of those surveyed re-
turned ratings for the first group; 61 percent did so in the
doctorate group. If you are interested in a particular specialty,
such as mechanical engineering, usnews.com offers lists of
the schools receiving the most mentions in each category.

U.S.NEWS & WORLD REPORT • WWW.USNEWS.COM • AUGUST 28, 2006
W
ar, it is said, is a series of ca-
tastrophes that, sooner or later, result in
victory. But the war between Israel and
Hezbollah has resulted not in victory but
in a disturbingly unquiet peace.
First, there’s the question about whether the United
Nations will put some muscle where its mouth is and in-
sist on disarming Hezbollah. President Bush has de-
clared victory, but that is way premature. It doesn’t fit
with Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice’s statement
that the disarmament of Hezbollah should be achieved
“voluntarily.” Dream on! Sheik Hassan Nasrallah, the
boss of Hezbollah (and Iran’s puppet), has already said
he won’t disarm. To no one’s surprise, the Lebanese 
defense minister vows not to order his Army to confis-
cate Hezbollah’s rockets, mainly because his Army
couldn’t defeat the New York City Police Department.
As for the U.N., its record in Somalia, Bosnia, and
Lebanon offers little cause 
for hope. So nobody will do it,
and Israel, which might, is
withdrawing on the basis of a
document widely seen as a
fraud even before the ink 
on it dries. The bottom line:
Lebanon may well be Hez-
bollah’s for the taking. What
that would mean, of course,
is the prospect of more rockets and missiles raining 
on Israeli civilians.
Ugly people. The world’s information media seem either
incapable of or unwilling to apprehend what’s now going
on around the globe. Al Manar, Hezbollah’s tv station,
has always been devoted to hate. Al Jazeera, the other
Arab cable network, likes to proclaim its integrity but
demonstrates nothing of the kind. These two propagan-
da channels have inflamed the Arab masses with anti-
Israel, anti-American propaganda. The American media,
of course, have presented the war in a more balanced fash-
ion—but the “balance” of on-the-one-hand, on-the-other
reporting is bogus. Truth simply doesn’t always reside
in the middle. If that sounds odd, try this: The Japan-
ese, on the one hand, were wrong to bomb Pearl Harbor,
while the Americans, on the other, were wrong to bomb
Hiroshima and Nagasaki. Such “balance,” in the Middle
East, ignores some rather important facts: 
a. that if Hezbollah laid down its arms, there would
be no war, while if Israel laid down its arms, there would
be no Israel; 
b. that this was not a war waged by Israel against in-
nocent Lebanon but a war against Hezbollah; 
c. that it was not a fight to occupy but merely to 
protect Israel’s right to exist within recognized, le-
gitimate borders. 
Context, context. That’s precisely what’s missing in the
media’s “balanced” reporting of the conflict. Television
is especially problematic. The images we see on our screens
may be factually accurate, but many represent a profound
untruth, leaving viewers with a plethora of images of a shat-
tered Lebanon and a surging Israeli military. A number of
American reporters acknowledged that Hezbollah over-
seers determined what they filmed. Repeated—and some-
times doctored—photographs of several damaged build-
ings were intended to confer on Beirut the epic status of
a Dresden in World War ii.
The “balanced” media are also somehow incapable of
pointing out the fact that it was then Israeli Prime Min-
ister Ehud Barak who ended the Israeli presence in
Lebanon in 2000, only to have Hezbollah begin frenetic
preparations for an offensive war—missiles are not, after
all, defensive weapons. Or that
since Ariel Sharon ordered 
the unilateral withdrawal from
Gaza last year, Israel hasn’t ex-
perienced a single day of peace.
The media must begin to rec-
ognize the fact that its familiar
formulas for integrity just don’t
work in this new world that is
anything but brave. 
The final question is how civilized countries should
deal with terrorists who hide among women and chil-
dren. A country under attack must defend its citizens.
Period. But when such a country does respond, the
media focus on the death toll among the innocents with-
out reflecting what caused the need for military reprisal
in the first place.
How can the civilized world establish and enforce the
principle that civilians are never to be used as human
shields? We must have a process for irrefutable inter-
national condemnation of terrorists who employ such
measures. Failing to do so would mean the terrorists win
either on the field of war or in the field of public opin-
ion—while the defenders lose either on the field of war
or in the field of international opinion—a lose-lose for
the civilized world. 
The notion of disproportion must be between the side
that cares about civilian deaths and the side that rev-
els in them. We must support those who endanger them-
selves to protect innocent civilians and condemn those
who endanger civilians to protect themselves.
Fighting terrorism certainly gives life to the sage old
adage, “Never get into a fight with ugly people—because
they have nothing to lose.” l
A Question of Balance
In war, on-the-one-hand, 
on-the-other reporting is bogus.
That’s especially so in the war
against terrorists, who just don’t
care about civilian casualties.
