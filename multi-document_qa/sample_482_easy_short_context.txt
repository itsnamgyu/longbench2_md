FINANCIAL HIGHLIGHTS FOR THE SIX MONTHS ENDED SEPTEMBER 30, 2023
• 
Revenue was RMB458,946 million (US$62,904 million), an increase of 11% year-over-year.
• 
Income from operations was RMB76,074 million (US$10,427 million), an increase of 52% 
year-over-year. Excluding the reversal of share-based compensation expense of RMB6,901 
million (US$946 million) as discussed in “Six Months Ended September Other Financial 
Results” below, income from operations would have increased by 38% year-over-year, 
primarily contributed by revenue growth and increase in operating efficiency. Adjusted 
EBITDA, a non-GAAP measurement, increased 20% year-over-year to RMB101,289 
million (US$13,883 million). Adjusted EBITA, a non-GAAP measurement, increased 25% 
year-over-year to RMB88,216 million (US$12,091 million).
• 
Net income attributable to ordinary shareholders was RMB62,038 million (US$8,503 
million). Net income was RMB59,696 million (US$8,182 million), compared to net loss of 
RMB2,169 million in the same period of 2022, primarily attributable to a decrease in a net 
fair value loss of our equity investments in publicly-traded companies and an increase in 
income from operations. We excluded net gains or losses arising from the changes in fair 
value of our investments from our non-GAAP measurements. Non-GAAP net income was 
RMB85,110 million (US$11,665 million), an increase of 33% year-over-year.
• 
Diluted earnings per ADS was RMB24.08 (US$3.30) and diluted earnings per share was 
RMB3.01 (US$0.41 or HK$3.28). Non-GAAP diluted earnings per ADS was RMB33.00

HK$4.50), both of which increased by 34% year-over-year.
• 
Net cash provided by operating activities was RMB94,537 million (US$12,957 million). 
Free cash flow was RMB84,309 million (US$11,556 million), an increase of 46% compared 
to RMB57,882 million in the same period of 2022. The year-over-year increase reflected an 
increase in profitability and a decrease in capital expenditure.
Reconciliations of GAAP measures to non-GAAP measures presented above are included at the 
end of this Interim Report.

Segment revenue
•

compared to RMB21,732 million for the same period of 2022. The increase in revenue 
was primarily due to strong combined order growth of AIDC’s retail businesses 
driven by the solid performance of all major retail platforms, the revenue contribution 
from AliExpress’ Choice, a new model launched in early 2023, and improvements 
in monetization. Certain of our international businesses generate revenue in local 
currencies while our reporting currency is Renminbi, AIDC’s revenue is affected by 
exchange rate fluctuations.

to be profitable during the period, mainly due to improvements in monetization and operating 
efficiency. Lazada reduced loss mainly due to improvement in monetization.

the six months ended September 30, 2023, an increase of 3% compared to RMB51,391 
million for the same period of 2022. Year-over-year revenue growth was mainly driven by 
Alibaba-consolidated businesses. Revenue excluding Alibaba-consolidated businesses slightly

stockpiling behavior compared to the same period of last year.

compared to RMB19,024 million, or 5% of revenue, for the same period of 2022. Without the 
effect of share-based compensation expense, general and administrative expenses as a percentage 
of revenue would have remained stable at 4% for the six months ended September 30, 2023 
compared to the same period of 2022.
Share-based compensation expense – Total share-based compensation expense included in the 
cost and expense items above for the six months ended September 30, 2023 was RMB5,201 million 
(US$713 million), compared to RMB14,512 million for the same period of 2022.

Share-based compensation expense related to Alibaba Group share-based awards decreased in the 
six months ended September 30, 2023 compared to the same period of 2022. This decrease was 
primarily due to the general decrease in the average fair market value of the awards granted.
Share-based compensation expense related to Ant Group reflected a reversal of share-based 
compensation expense of RMB6,901 million (US$946 million) recorded in the six months ended 
September 30, 2023. This is the result of a mark-to-market adjustment during the period relating to 
Ant Group share-based awards granted to our employees because of a decrease in the value of Ant 
Group.
We expect that our share-based compensation expense will continue to be affected by changes in 
the fair value of the underlying awards and the quantity of awards we grant in the future.
Amortization of intangible assets – Amortization of intangible assets for the six months ended 
September 30, 2023 was RMB4,910 million (US$673 million), a decrease of 10% from RMB5,480 
million for the same period of 2022.
Impairment of goodwill – Impairment of goodwill of RMB2,031 million (US$278 million) was 
recorded in the six months ended September 30, 2023 because the carrying value of a reporting 
unit within All others segment exceeded its fair value.
Income from operations and operating margin
Income from operations for the six months ended September 30, 2023 was RMB76,074 million 
(US$10,427 million), or 17% of revenue, an increase of 52% compared to RMB50,080 million, or 
12% of revenue, for the same period of 2022, primarily contributed by revenue growth, increase in 
operating efficiency and the reversal of share-based compensation expense of RMB6,901 million 
(US$946 million) related to the mark-to-market adjustment during the period relating to Ant Group 
share-based awards granted to our employees. We excluded share-based compensation expense 
from our non-GAAP measurements. Excluding the reversal of share-based compensation expense, 
our income from operations would have increased by 38% year-over-year, from RMB50,080 
million in the six months ended September 30, 2022 to RMB69,173 million (US$9,481 million) in 
the six months ended September 30, 2023.
Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITA
Adjusted EBITDA increased 20% year-over-year to RMB101,289 million (US$13,883 million) for 
the six months ended September 30, 2023, compared to RMB84,425 million for the same period 
of 2022. Adjusted EBITA increased 25% year-over-year to RMB88,216 million (US$12,091 
million) for the six months ended September 30, 2023, compared to RMB70,583 million for the 
same period of 2022. The year-over-year increase in adjusted EBITA was primarily contributed 
by revenue growth and improved operating efficiency. A reconciliation of net income (loss) to 
adjusted EBITDA and adjusted EBITA is included at the end of this Interim Report.


12
Adjusted EBITA by segment
Adjusted EBITA by segment as well as a reconciliation of income from operations to adjusted 
EBITA are set forth in the section entitled “Six Months Ended September Segment Results” above.
Interest and investment income, net
Interest and investment income, net for the six months ended September 30, 2023 was a loss 
of RMB762 million (US$104 million), compared to a loss of RMB37,083 million for the same 
period of 2022, primarily due to the decrease in net fair value loss of our equity investments in 
publicly-traded companies during the six months ended September 30, 2023, compared to the same 
period of 2022. The fair value of these investments is determined based on the available market 
price on each measurement date. The extent of the overall decrease in market prices of our equity 
investments in publicly-traded companies during the six months ended September 30, 2023, is less 
than that of 2022.
The above-mentioned gains and losses were excluded from our non-GAAP net income.
Other income, net
Other income, net for the six months ended September 30, 2023 was RMB2,755 million (US$377 
million), compared to RMB3,053 million for the same period of 2022.
Income tax expenses
Income tax expenses for the six months ended September 30, 2023 were RMB11,819 million 
(US$1,620 million), compared to RMB7,971 million for the same period of 2022.
Excluding share-based compensation expense, revaluation and disposal gains/losses of investments, 
impairment of investments, as well as the deferred tax effects on basis differences arising from 
our equity method investees, our effective tax rate would have been 18% for the six months ended 
September 30, 2023.


13
Share of results of equity method investees
Share of results of equity method investees for the six months ended September 30, 2023 was a 
loss of RMB2,914 million (US$399 million), compared to a loss of RMB7,616 million for the same 
period of 2022. The following table sets forth a breakdown of share of results of equity method 
investees for the periods indicated.

“Others” mainly include basis differences arising from equity method investees, share-based compensation 
expense related to share-based awards granted to employees of our equity method investees, as well as gain or 
loss arising from the deemed disposal of the equity method investees.
We record our share of results of all equity method investees one quarter in arrears. The 
year-over-year decrease in share of profit of Ant Group which reflected the share of a RMB7.07 
billion fine on Ant Group imposed by PRC regulators announced in July 2023. The decrease in 
share of net losses of other equity method investees was mainly due to the overall improvement in 
financial performance of certain of our equity method investees.
During the six months ended September 30, 2023, Ant Group repurchased approximately 7% 
equity interest from its existing shareholders and the shares repurchased were allocated to the 
employee incentive plans of Ant Group. The number of shares held by us in Ant Group remains 
unchanged from legal perspective, our equity interest in Ant Group on a fully diluted basis remains 
unchanged at 33%.
For U.S. GAAP accounting purposes, we will take into consideration a proportionate share of 
equity interest held by the employee incentive plans of Ant Group to account for our share of 
results from our investment in Ant Group, subject to dilution as the equity interest under the 
employee incentive plans of Ant Group is transferred out.
Net income (loss) and Non-GAAP net income
Our net income for the six months ended September 30, 2023 was RMB59,696 million 
(US$8,182 million), compared to net loss of RMB2,169 million for the same period of 2022, 
which was primarily attributable to a decrease in net fair value loss of our equity investments in 
publicly-traded companies and an increase in income from operations.


14
Excluding share-based compensation expense, revaluation and disposal gains/losses of investments, 
impairment of investments and certain other items, non-GAAP net income for the six months 
ended September 30, 2023 was RMB85,110 million (US$11,665 million), an increase of 33% 
compared to RMB64,072 million for the same period of 2022. A reconciliation of net income (loss) 
to non-GAAP net income is included at the end of this Interim Report.
Net income attributable to ordinary shareholders
Net income attributable to ordinary shareholders for the six months ended September 30, 2023 was 
RMB62,038 million (US$8,503 million), an increase of 2748% compared to RMB2,178 million for 
the same period of 2022, which was primarily attributable to a decrease in net fair value loss of our 
equity investments in publicly-traded companies and an increase in income from operations.
Diluted earnings per ADS/share and non-GAAP diluted earnings per ADS/share
Diluted earnings per ADS for the six months ended September 30, 2023 was RMB24.08 (US$3.30) 
compared to RMB0.82 during the same period in 2022. Excluding share-based compensation 
expense, revaluation and disposal gains/losses of investments, impairment of investments and 
certain other items, non-GAAP diluted earnings per ADS for the six months ended September 30, 
2023 was RMB33.00 (US$4.52), an increase of 34% compared to RMB24.64 for the same period 
of 2022.
Diluted earnings per share for the six months ended September 30, 2023 was RMB3.01 (US$0.41 
or HK$3.28), an increase of 2849% compared to RMB0.10 for the same period of 2022. Excluding 
share-based compensation expense, revaluation and disposal gains/losses of investments, 
impairment of investments and certain other items, non-GAAP diluted earnings per share for the 
six months ended September 30, 2023 was RMB4.13 (US$0.57 or HK$4.50), an increase of 34%, 
compared to RMB3.08 for the same period of 2022.
A reconciliation of diluted earnings per ADS/share to non-GAAP diluted earnings per ADS/share 
is included at the end of this Interim Report. Each ADS represents eight ordinary shares.
Cash and cash equivalents, short-term investments and other treasury investments
As of September 30, 2023, cash and cash equivalents, short-term investments and other treasury 
investments included in equity securities and other investments on the consolidated balance 
sheets, were RMB624,501 million (US$85,595 million), compared to RMB560,314 million as of 
March 31, 2023. Other treasury investments mainly comprise of investments in fixed deposits and 
certificates of deposits with original maturities over one year for treasury purposes. The increase 
in cash and cash equivalents, short-term investments and other treasury investments during the six 
months ended September 30, 2023 was primarily due to free cash flow generated from operations 
of RMB84,309 million (US$11,556 million), effect of exchange rate changes of RMB14,247 
million (US$1,953 million) mainly due to the appreciation of the U.S. dollar against Renminbi, and 
net cash provided by investment and acquisition activities of RMB4,789 million (US$656 million), 
partly offset by cash used in repurchase of ordinary shares of RMB34,025 million (US$4,664 
million) and repayment of unsecured senior notes of US$700 million.


15
Net cash provided by operating activities and free cash flow
For the six months ended September 30, 2023, net cash provided by operating activities was

the same period of 2022. Free cash flow, a non-GAAP measurement of liquidity for the six months 
ended September 30, 2023, was RMB84,309 million (US$11,556 million), an increase of 46% 
compared to RMB57,882 million for the same period of 2022. The year-over-year increase was 
primarily due to an increase in profitability and a decrease in capital expenditure. A reconciliation 
of net cash provided by operating activities to free cash flow is included at the end of this Interim 
Report.
Net cash used in investing activities
For the six months ended September 30, 2023, net cash used in investing activities of RMB11,166

(US$1,655 million) and (iii) cash outflow of RMB5,483 million (US$752 million) for investment 
and acquisition activities. These cash outflows were partially offset by a decrease in short-term

(US$1,408 million) from disposal of investments.
Net cash used in financing activities

NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES
To supplement our consolidated financial statements, which are prepared and presented in 
accordance with GAAP, we use the following non-GAAP financial measures: for our consolidated 
results, adjusted EBITDA (including adjusted EBITDA margin), adjusted EBITA (including 
adjusted EBITA margin), non-GAAP net income, non-GAAP diluted earnings per share/ADS and 
free cash flow. For more information on these non-GAAP financial measures, please refer to the 
table captioned “Reconciliations of Non-GAAP Measures to the Nearest Comparable U.S. GAAP 
Measures” in this Interim Report.


17
We believe that adjusted EBITDA, adjusted EBITA, non-GAAP net income and non-GAAP diluted 
earnings per share/ADS help identify underlying trends in our business that could otherwise be 
distorted by the effect of certain income or expenses that we include in income from operations, 
net income and diluted earnings per share/ADS. We believe that these non-GAAP measures 
provide useful information about our core operating results, enhance the overall understanding 
of our past performance and future prospects and allow for greater visibility with respect to key 
metrics used by our management in its financial and operational decision-making. We present three 
different income measures, namely adjusted EBITDA, adjusted EBITA and non-GAAP net income 
in order to provide more information and greater transparency to investors about our operating 
results.
We consider free cash flow to be a liquidity measure that provides useful information to 
management and investors about the amount of cash generated by our business that can be used 
for strategic corporate transactions, including investing in our new business initiatives, making 
strategic investments and acquisitions and strengthening our balance sheet.
Adjusted EBITDA, adjusted EBITA, non-GAAP net income, non-GAAP diluted earnings per 
share/ADS and free cash flow should not be considered in isolation or construed as an alternative 
to income from operations, net income, diluted earnings per share/ADS, cash flows or any other 
measure of performance or as an indicator of our operating performance. These non-GAAP 
financial measures presented here do not have standardized meanings prescribed by U.S. GAAP 
and may not be comparable to similarly titled measures presented by other companies. Other 
companies may calculate similarly titled measures differently, limiting their usefulness as 
comparative measures to our data.
Adjusted EBITDA represents net income before (i) interest and investment income, net, interest 
expense, other income, net, income tax expenses and share of results of equity method investees, 
(ii) certain non-cash expenses, consisting of share-based compensation expense, amortization of 
intangible assets, depreciation and impairment of property and equipment, and operating lease 
cost relating to land use rights, impairment of goodwill, as well as equity-settled donation expense 
which we do not believe are reflective of our core operating performance during the periods 
presented.
Adjusted EBITA represents net income before (i) interest and investment income, net, interest 
expense, other income, net, income tax expenses and share of results of equity method investees, 
(ii) certain non-cash expenses, consisting of share-based compensation expense, amortization of 
intangible assets, impairment of goodwill and equity-settled donation expense which we do not 
believe are reflective of our core operating performance during the periods presented.
Non-GAAP net income represents net income before share-based compensation expense, 
amortization of intangible assets, impairment of goodwill and investments, gain or loss on deemed 
disposals/disposals/revaluation of investments, equity-settled donation expense and others, as 
adjusted for the tax effects.
Non-GAAP diluted earnings per share represents non-GAAP net income attributable to ordinary 
shareholders divided by the weighted average number of outstanding ordinary shares for computing 
non-GAAP diluted earnings per share on a diluted basis. Non-GAAP diluted earnings per ADS 
represents non-GAAP diluted earnings per share after adjusting for the ordinary share-to-ADS 
ratio.


18
Free cash flow represents net cash provided by operating activities as presented in our 
consolidated cash flow statement less purchases of property and equipment (excluding acquisition 
of land use rights and construction in progress relating to office campuses) and intangible assets 
(excluding those acquired through acquisitions), as well as adjustments to exclude from net 
cash provided by operating activities the buyer protection fund deposits from merchants on our 
marketplaces. We deduct certain items of cash flows from investing activities in order to provide 
greater transparency into cash flow from our revenue-generating business operations. We exclude 
“acquisition of land use rights and construction in progress relating to office campuses” because 
the office campuses are used by us for corporate and administrative purposes and are not directly 
related to our revenue-generating business operations. We also exclude buyer protection fund 
deposits from merchants on our marketplaces because these deposits are restricted for the purpose 
of compensating buyers for claims against merchants.
The table captioned “Reconciliations of Non-GAAP Measures to the Nearest Comparable U.S. 
GAAP Measures” in this Interim Report have more details on the non-GAAP financial measures 
that are most directly comparable to GAAP financial measures and the related reconciliations 
between these financial measures.

deconsolidates the entity upon the loss of control. Under U.S. GAAP, control generally exists 
when the Company obtains a controlling financial interest over an entity, whereby the usual 
condition is ownership of over 50% of the voting shares. Under IFRS, de facto control exists 
when the Company has the practical ability to direct the relevant activities of the entity, even 
if the Company owns less than 50% of the voting shares.
The Company recognizes noncontrolling interests to reflect the portion of equity of a 
subsidiary that is not attributable to the Company. Under U.S. GAAP, noncontrolling interests 
are measured at fair value and full goodwill in relation to the acquiree is recognized in a 
business combination. Under IFRS, the Company can elect, on a transaction-by-transaction 
basis, to measure noncontrolling interests at the noncontrolling interests’ proportionate share 
of the acquiree’s net identifiable assets and partial goodwill is recognized to reflect the 
controlling interests only.
The Company recognizes an impairment loss when the Company determines that the carrying 
value of goodwill is not recoverable. Under U.S. GAAP, the impairment loss is measured by 
comparing the carrying value of the reporting unit, including goodwill, with its fair value. 
Under IFRS, the carrying value is compared with the recoverable amount, which is the higher 
of fair value less costs of disposal and value in use.
(ii) Equity securities without readily determinable fair value
Under U.S. GAAP, the Company can elect, on an instrument-by-instrument basis, to 
apply the measurement alternative to record the investments in equity securities without 
readily determinable fair values at cost, less impairment, with subsequent adjustments for 
observable price changes recognized in the consolidated income statements. Under IFRS, 
these investments are measured at fair value with changes in fair value recognized in the 
consolidated income statements.
(iii) Equity method investments
The Company generally applies the equity method to account for equity investments over 
which it has significant influence. Under U.S. GAAP, significant influence is presumed to 
exist for an investment in limited partnership or unincorporated entity, unless the investment 
is so minor that the Company has virtually no influence over the entity’s operating and 
financial policies. Under IFRS, significant influence is presumed to exist for an investment of 
over 20% of the voting rights of an entity.
The Company records its share of the post-acquisition results of its equity method investees 
and adjusts for the basis differences that exist between the carrying values of the equity 
method investments and the Company’s proportionate share of the carrying value of the 
investee’s net assets. Adjustments are made to the financial statements of the equity method 
investees prepared under U.S. GAAP in order to conform to the Company’s accounting 
policies under IFRS and to reflect the basis differences of the equity method investments 
under IFRS, if different from those under U.S. GAAP.

ALIBABA GROUP HOLDING LIMITED
RECONCILIATIONS BETWEEN U.S. GAAP AND INTERNATIONAL FINANCIAL 
REPORTING STANDARDS (CONTINUED)
(iv) Share-based awards
The employees of the Company hold share-based awards relating to an equity method 
investee of the Company that were granted and will be settled by related parties or economic 
interest holders of the Company. Under U.S. GAAP, the cost related to these awards is 
recognized over the requisite service period, with subsequent changes in fair value of these 
awards recognized in the consolidated income statements. Under IFRS, these awards are not 
considered as share based payments of the Company and the cost relating to these awards is 
not recognized.
The Company accounts for income tax effects of share-based awards that ordinarily give 
rise to tax deduction. Under U.S. GAAP, deferred taxes for these awards are measured based 
on share-based compensation expenses recognized in the consolidated financial statements. 
Under IFRS, deferred taxes for these awards are measured based on future tax deduction 
estimated at the end of each reporting period.
(v) 
Operating leases
Under U.S. GAAP, the amortization of right-of-use assets and the interest expense related 
to lease liabilities are recorded together as lease expense and recognized in the consolidated 
income statements on a straight-line basis. Under IFRS, the right-of-use assets are amortized 
on a straight-line basis while the interest expense related to lease liabilities are recognized in 
the consolidated income statements using effective interest method.
(vi) Redeemable noncontrolling interests
Equity interests issued by certain subsidiaries of the Company are redeemable. Under U.S. 
GAAP, redeemable equity interests are classified as mezzanine equity if the redemption is 
outside the Company’s control and as noncontrolling interests if equity interests issued by 
finite-lived subsidiaries are mandatorily redeemable only upon liquidation. Under IFRS, these 
redeemable equity interests are generally classified as financial liabilities.
(vii) Hyperinflation
Under U.S. GAAP, when the Company determines that a subsidiary is operating in a highly 
inflationary economy, the financial statements of this subsidiary are remeasured prospectively 
as if its functional currency was the functional currency of its immediate parent company. 
Under IFRS, the financial statements of the subsidiary operating in a highly inflationary 
economy are restated in terms of the measuring unit current at the end of the reporting period.

FINANCIAL HIGHLIGHTS FOR THE SIX MONTHS ENDED SEPTEMBER 30, 2021
• 
Revenue was RMB406,430 million (US$63,077 million), an increase of 32% year-over-
year. Excluding the consolidation of Sun Art, our revenue would have grown 19% year-over-
year to RMB367,744 million (US$57,073 million). Aggregate revenue of our international 
commerce retail and international commerce wholesale was RMB30,294 million (US$4,701 
million), an increase of 41% year-over-year. Our cloud computing revenue was RMB36,058 
million (US$5,596 million), an increase of 31% year-over-year.
• 
Income from operations was RMB45,853 million (US$7,116 million), a decrease of 5% 
year-over-year. Adjusted EBITDA, a non-GAAP measurement, decreased 15% year-
over-year to RMB83,468 million (US$12,954 million). Adjusted EBITA, a non-GAAP 
measurement, decreased 19% year-over-year to RMB69,764 million (US$10,827 million). 
The year-over-year decreases were primarily due to our increased investments in key 
strategic areas that have exhibited robust growth in operations, as well as our support to 
merchants. These investments in key strategic areas within our commerce segment, such as 
Taobao Deals, Local Consumer Services, Community Marketplaces and Lazada, increased by 
RMB21,325 million year-over-year.
• 
Net income attributable to ordinary shareholders was RMB50,508 million (US$7,839 
million), and net income was RMB46,212 million (US$7,172 million). Non-GAAP net 
income was RMB71,965 million (US$11,169 million), a decrease of 17% year-over-year.
• 
Diluted earnings per ADS was RMB18.44 (US$2.86) and diluted earnings per share was 
RMB2.30 (US$0.36 or HK$2.76). Non-GAAP diluted earnings per ADS was RMB27.84 
(US$4.32) and non-GAAP diluted earnings per share was RMB3.48 (US$0.54 or 
HK$4.18), both of which decreased by 15% year-over-year.
• 
Net cash provided by operating activities was RMB69,433 million (US$10,776 million). 
Non-GAAP free cash flow was RMB42,922 million (US$6,661 million), a decrease 
compared to RMB77,110 million in the same period of 2020. The year-over-year decrease 
was mainly due to a decrease in profit as a result of our increased investments in key 
strategic areas, as well as the partial settlement in the amount of RMB9,114 million 
(US$1,414 million) of the RMB18,228 million fine levied earlier this year by China’s State 
Administration for Market Regulation pursuant to China’s Anti-monopoly Law (the “Anti-
monopoly Fine”).
Reconciliations of GAAP measures to non-GAAP measures presented above are included at the 
end of this Interim Report.

(2) 
The year-over-year decrease was primarily due to our increased investments in key strategic areas, such as 
Taobao Deals, Local Consumer Services, Community Marketplaces and Lazada, that have exhibited robust 
growth in operations, as well as our support to merchants, partly offset by the decrease in share-based 
compensation expense related to Ant Group share-based awards granted to our employees (see “Cost and 
Expenses – Share-based Compensation Expense” below). We excluded share-based compensation expense from 
our non-GAAP measurements.
(3) 
The year-over-year decreases were primarily due to our increased investments in key strategic areas and our 
support to merchants as mentioned above.
(4) 
The year-over-year decreases were primarily due to net losses arising from changes in market prices of our 
equity investments in publicly-traded companies for the six months ended September 30, 2021, compared to 
net gains in the same period of 2020, as well as our increased investments in key strategic areas and support to 
merchants as mentioned above, partly offset by the decrease in share-based compensation expense related to Ant 
Group share-based awards granted to our employees.

commerce adjusted EBITA before key strategic investments, we expanded the list of key strategic investment 
areas that we break out in order to present the progress of these areas. Comparative figures are presented in 
the same manner accordingly. “Commerce adjusted EBITA before key strategic investments” was previously 
referred to as “Marketplace-based core commerce adjusted EBITA”. A reconciliation of adjusted EBITA for

OPERATIONAL AND FINANCIAL RESULTS
Revenue
Revenue for the six months ended September 30, 2021 was RMB406,430 million (US$63,077 
million), an increase of 32% compared to RMB308,810 million in the same period of 2020. The 
increase was mainly driven by the revenue growth of our China commerce retail business, which 
includes the consolidation of Sun Art starting in October 2020, and the revenue growth of cloud 
computing business. Excluding the consolidation of Sun Art, our revenue would have grown 19% 
year-over-year to RMB367,744 million (US$57,073 million).

Cost of revenue – Cost of revenue for the six months ended September 30, 2021 was RMB253,847 
million (US$39,396 million), or 63% of revenue, compared to RMB174,483 million, or 56% of 
revenue, for the same period of 2020. Without the effect of share-based compensation expense, 
cost of revenue as a percentage of revenue would have increased from 54% for the six months 
ended September 30, 2020 to 62% for the six months ended September 30, 2021. The increase 
was primarily attributable to the higher proportion of our direct sales businesses, mainly from the 
consolidation of Sun Art, which resulted in increased cost of inventory.
Product development expenses – Product development expenses for the six months ended 
September 30, 2021 were RMB28,816 million (US$4,472 million), or 7% of revenue, compared to 
RMB30,327 million, or 10% of revenue, for the same period of 2020. Without the effect of share-
based compensation expense, product development expenses as a percentage of revenue would 
have remained stable at 5% for the six months ended September 30, 2021 and for the same period 
last year.
Sales and marketing expenses – Sales and marketing expenses for the six months ended 
September 30, 2021 were RMB55,893 million (US$8,675 million), or 14% of revenue, compared to 
RMB31,023 million, or 10% of revenue, for the same period of 2020. Without the effect of share-
based compensation expense, sales and marketing expenses as a percentage of revenue would have 
increased from 9% for the six months ended September 30, 2020 to 13% for the six months ended 
September 30, 2021. The increase was primarily due to an increase in marketing and promotional 
spending for user acquisition and engagement for our mobile commerce apps, such as Taobao, 
Taobao Deals, Lazada and Ele.me.
General and administrative expenses – General and administrative expenses for the six months 
ended September 30, 2021 were RMB16,042 million (US$2,490 million), or 4% of revenue, 
compared to RMB18,798 million, or 6% of revenue, for the same period of 2020. Without the 
effect of share-based compensation expense, general and administrative expenses as a percentage 
of revenue would have decreased from 4% for the six months ended September 30, 2020 to 3% for 
the six months ended September 30, 2021.
Share-based compensation expense – Total share-based compensation expense included in the 
cost and expense items above for the six months ended September 30, 2021 was RMB17,932 
million (US$2,783 million), a decrease of 45% compared to RMB32,409 million for the same 
period of 2020. Share-based compensation expense as a percentage of revenue decreased to 5% for 
the six months ended September 30, 2021, as compared to 10% in the same period of 2020.

(2) 
This represents Ant Group share-based awards granted to our employees, which is subject to mark-to-market 
accounting treatment.
(3) 
This represents share-based awards of our subsidiaries.
Share-based compensation expense related to Alibaba Group share-based awards for the six months 
ended September 30, 2021 was comparable to that in the same period of 2020.
Share-based compensation expense related to Ant Group share-based awards decreased 
significantly for the six months ended September 30, 2021 compared to the same period of 2020, 
mainly due to the recognition of an increase in the value of these awards in the same period of 
2020.
We expect that our share-based compensation expense will continue to be affected by changes in 
the fair value of the underlying awards and the quantity of awards we grant in the future.
Amortization of intangible assets – Amortization of intangible assets for the six months ended 
September 30, 2021 was RMB5,979 million (US$928 million), an increase of 2% from RMB5,840 
million for the same period of 2020.
Income from operations and operating margin
Income from operations for the six months ended September 30, 2021 was RMB45,853 million 
(US$7,116 million), or 11% of revenue, a decrease of 5% compared to RMB48,339 million, or 
16% of revenue, for the same period of 2020, primarily due to our increased investments in key 
strategic areas, such as Taobao Deals, Local Consumer Services, Community Marketplaces and 
Lazada, that have exhibited robust growth in operations, as well as our support to merchants, partly 
offset by the decrease in share-based compensation expense related to Ant Group share-based 
awards granted to our employees.

Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITA
Adjusted EBITDA decreased 15% year-over-year to RMB83,468 million (US$12,954 million) for 
the six months ended September 30, 2021, compared to RMB98,564 million for the same period of 
2020. Adjusted EBITA decreased 19% year-over-year to RMB69,764 million (US$10,827 million) 
for the six months ended September 30, 2021, compared to RMB86,588 million for the same 
period of 2020. The year-over-year decreases were primarily due to our increased investments in 
key strategic areas, such as Taobao Deals, Local Consumer Services, Community Marketplaces 
and Lazada, that have exhibited robust growth in operations, as well as our support to merchants. 
A reconciliation of net income to adjusted EBITDA and adjusted EBITA is included at the end of 
this Interim Report.
Adjusted EBITA and adjusted EBITA margin by segments
Adjusted EBITA and adjusted EBITA margin by segments are set forth in the table below. See

Beginning on April 1, 2021, we reclassified the results of our DingTalk business, which was previously reported 
under the innovation initiatives and others segment, to the cloud computing segment. This reclassification 
conforms to the way that we manage and monitor segment performance and reflects the integration of DingTalk 
with Alibaba Cloud to further facilitate the digital transformation of our enterprise customers. Comparative 
figures were reclassified to conform to this presentation.
Commerce segment – Adjusted EBITA decreased by 19% to RMB78,861 million (US$12,239 
million) for the six months ended September 30, 2021, compared to RMB97,195 million for 
the same period of 2020, primarily due to increase in our increased investments in key strategic 
areas, such as Taobao Deals, Local Consumer Services, Community Marketplaces and Lazada, 
to strengthen consumer experience, enhance loyalty, penetrate into less-developed areas in China 
and further expand our presence internationally. Commerce adjusted EBITA before key strategic 
investments was RMB111,756 million (US$17,344 million), an increase of 3% compared to 
RMB108,765 million in the same period of 2020. The slower year-over-year growth rate of 
commerce adjusted EBITA before key strategic investments was primarily due to the increased 
spending on user acquisition and engagement on our marketplaces as well as our support to 
merchants.
Adjusted EBITA margin decreased from 37% for the six months ended September 30, 2020 to 22% 
for the six months ended September 30, 2021, primarily due to the consolidation of Sun Art and 
our increased investments in key strategic areas.


12
Starting from the quarter ended March 31, 2021, for purposes of presenting our commerce adjusted 
EBITA before key strategic investments, we expanded the list of key strategic investment areas 
that we break out in order to present the progress of these areas. Comparative figures are presented 
in the same manner accordingly. A reconciliation of adjusted EBITA for commerce to commerce 
adjusted EBITA before key strategic investments is included at the end of this Interim Report.
We expect that our commerce adjusted EBITA margin will continue to be affected by the pace of 
our investment in key strategic areas and growth initiatives, as well as the growth of our direct 
sales businesses.
Cloud computing segment – Adjusted EBITA for the six months ended September 30, 2021 was a 
profit of RMB736 million (US$114 million), compared to a loss of RMB1,688 million for the same 
period of 2020. Adjusted EBITA margin improved to 2% for the six months ended September 30, 
2021 from negative 6% for the same period of 2020, primarily attributable to the realization of 
economies of scale.
Beginning on April 1, 2021, we reclassified the results of our DingTalk business, which was 
previously reported under the innovation initiatives and others segment, to the cloud computing 
segment. This reclassification conforms to the way that we manage and monitor segment 
performance and reflects the integration of DingTalk with Alibaba Cloud to further facilitate 
the digital transformation of our enterprise customers. Comparative figures were reclassified 
to conform to this presentation. Because DingTalk remains in the investment phase, the 
reclassification of DingTalk’s financials resulted in lowering of cloud computing profitability and 
did not materially add to revenue.
Digital media and entertainment segment – Adjusted EBITA for the six months ended September 
30, 2021 was a loss of RMB1,350 million (US$209 million), compared to a loss of RMB2,031 
million for the same period of 2020. Adjusted EBITA margin improved to negative 8% for the six 
months ended September 30, 2021 from negative 13% for the same period of 2020, primarily due 
to improved quality of content that resulted in reduced losses of Youku.
Innovation initiatives and others segment – Adjusted EBITA for the six months ended 
September 30, 2021 was a loss of RMB5,030 million (US$781 million), compared to a loss of 
RMB3,896 million for the same period of 2020, primarily due to our investments in technology 
and innovation.
Interest and investment income, net
Interest and investment income, net for the six months ended September 30, 2021 was RMB2,645 
million (US$410 million), compared to RMB32,647 million for the same period of 2020, primarily 
due to net losses arising from changes in market prices of our equity investments in publicly-traded 
companies for the six months ended September 30, 2021, compared to net gains in the same period 
of 2020.
The above-mentioned gains were excluded from our non-GAAP net income.
Other income, net
Other income, net for the six months ended September 30, 2021 was RMB3,820 million (US$593 
million), compared to RMB2,641 million for the same period of 2020, primarily due to the increase 
in net exchange gain.


13
Income tax expenses
Income tax expenses for the six months ended September 30, 2021 were RMB15,183 million 
(US$2,356 million), compared to RMB13,035 million for the same period of 2020. For the six 
months ended September 30, 2020, tax expenses were reduced by approximately RMB6.1 billion 
because during that period certain subsidiaries were officially notified that they were approved 
of the Key Software Enterprise status for calendar year 2019, which entitled them to a reduced 
tax rate of 10%. These subsidiaries did not obtain the Key Software Enterprise status for calendar 
year 2020, and therefore no such adjustment of tax expenses was made in the six months ended 
September 30, 2021.
Excluding share-based compensation expense, revaluation and disposal gains/losses of investments, 
impairment of investments, as well as the deferred tax effects on basis differences arising from our 
share of results of equity method investees, our effective tax rate would have been 21% for the six 
months ended September 30, 2021.
Share of results of equity method investees
Share of results of equity method investees for the six months ended September 30, 2021 was 
RMB11,611 million (US$1,802 million), compared to RMB4,593 million for the same period of 
2020. Share of results of equity method investees for the six months ended September 30, 2021 
and the comparative period consisted of the following:

“Others” mainly include amortization of intangible assets of equity method investees, share-based compensation 
expense related to share-based awards granted to employees of our equity method investees, as well as gain or 
loss arising from the dilution of our investment in equity method investees.
We record our share of results of all equity method investees one quarter in arrears. The year-over-
year increase in share of profit of Ant Group was mainly due to an increase in net gains arising 
from fair value changes in the investments held by Ant Group. The increase in share of results of 
other equity method investees was mainly due to a general improvement in financial performance 
of our equity method investees.


14
Net income and Non-GAAP net income
Our net income for the six months ended September 30, 2021 was RMB46,212 million (US$7,172 
million), a decrease of 37% compared to RMB72,961 million for the same period of 2020. The 
year-over-year decrease was primarily due to net losses arising from changes in market prices of 
our equity investments in publicly-traded companies for the six months ended September 30, 2021, 
compared to net gains in the same period of 2020, as well as our increased investments in key 
strategic areas and support to merchants, partly offset by the decrease in share-based compensation 
expense related to Ant Group share-based awards granted to our employees.
Excluding share-based compensation expense, revaluation and disposal gains/losses of investments, 
impairment of investments and certain other items, non-GAAP net income for the six months ended 
September 30, 2021 was RMB71,965 million (US$11,169 million), a decrease of 17% compared to 
RMB86,562 million for the same period of 2020. A reconciliation of net income to non-GAAP net 
income is included at the end of this Interim Report.
Net income attributable to ordinary shareholders
Net income attributable to ordinary shareholders for the six months ended September 30, 2021 
was RMB50,508 million (US$7,839 million), a decrease of 34% compared to RMB76,360 million 
for the same period of 2020. The year-over-year decrease was primarily due to net losses arising 
from changes in market prices of our equity investments in publicly-traded companies for the six 
months ended September 30, 2021, compared to the same period of 2020, as well as our increased 
investments in key strategic areas and support to merchants, partly offset by the decrease in share-
based compensation expense related to Ant Group share-based awards granted to our employees.
Diluted earnings per ADS/share and non-GAAP diluted earnings per ADS/share
Diluted earnings per ADS for the six months ended September 30, 2021 was RMB18.44 (US$2.86) 
on a weighted average of 21,916 million diluted shares outstanding during the period, a decrease of 
34% compared to RMB27.83 on a weighted average of 21,943 million diluted shares outstanding 
during the same period in 2020. Excluding share-based compensation expense, revaluation and 
disposal gains/losses of investments, impairment of investments and certain other items, non-
GAAP diluted earnings per ADS for the six months ended September 30, 2021 was RMB27.84 
(US$4.32), a decrease of 15% compared to RMB32.79 for the same period of 2020.
Diluted earnings per share for the six months ended September 30, 2021 was RMB2.30 (US$0.36 
or HK$2.76), a decrease of 34% compared to RMB3.48 for the same period of 2020. Excluding 
share-based compensation expense, revaluation and disposal gains/losses of investments, 
impairment of investments and certain other items, non-GAAP diluted earnings per share for the 
six months ended September 30, 2021 was RMB3.48 (US$0.54 or HK$4.18), a decrease of 15%, 
compared to RMB4.10 for the same period of 2020.
A reconciliation of diluted earnings per ADS/share to non-GAAP diluted earnings per ADS/share 
is included at the end of this Interim Report. Each ADS represents eight ordinary shares.


15
Cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments
As of September 30, 2021, cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments were RMB443,428 
million (US$68,819 million), compared to RMB473,638 million as of March 31, 2021. The 
decrease in cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments during the six months ended 
September 30, 2021 was primarily due to cash used in repurchase of ordinary shares of RMB40,308 
million (US$6,256 million) and investment and acquisition activities of RMB35,136 million 
(US$5,453 million), partly offset by free cash flow generated from operations of RMB42,922 
million (US$6,661 million).
Cash flow from operating activities and free cash flow
Net cash provided by operating activities for the six months ended September 30, 2021 was 
RMB69,433 million (US$10,776 million), a decrease of 33% compared to RMB104,395 million 
for the same period of 2020. Free cash flow, a non-GAAP measurement of liquidity, for the six 
months ended September 30, 2021 decreased by 44% to RMB42,922 million (US$6,661 million), 
from RMB77,110 million for the same period of 2020. The year-over-year decreases were mainly 
due to a decrease in profit as a result of our increased investments in key strategic areas, as well as 
the partial settlement in the amount of RMB9,114 million (US$1,414 million) of the RMB18,228 
million Anti-monopoly Fine. A reconciliation of net cash provided by operating activities to free 
cash flow is included at the end of this Interim Report.
Net cash used in investing activities
For the six months ended September 30, 2021, net cash used in investing activities of RMB77,548 
million (US$12,035 million) primarily reflected (i) cash outflow of RMB35,136 million (US$5,453 
million) for investment and acquisition activities, (ii) capital expenditures of RMB28,456 million 
(US$4,417 million), which included cash outflow for acquisition of land use rights and construction 
in progress relating to office campuses of RMB4,882 million (US$758 million), as well as (iii) 
an increase in short-term investments by RMB19,864 million (US$3,083 million). These cash 
outflows were partly offset by cash inflow of RMB6,296 million (US$977 million) from disposal 
of investments.
Employees
As of September 30, 2021, we had a total of 258,578 employees, compared to 251,462 as of March 
31, 2021.

NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES
To supplement our consolidated financial statements, which are prepared and presented in 
accordance with GAAP, we use the following non-GAAP financial measures: for our consolidated 
results, adjusted EBITDA (including adjusted EBITDA margin), adjusted EBITA (including 
adjusted EBITA margin), commerce adjusted EBITA before key strategic investments, non-GAAP 
net income, non-GAAP diluted earnings per share/ADS and free cash flow. For more information 
on these non-GAAP financial measures, please refer to the section entitled “Information by 
Segments” and the table captioned “Reconciliations of Non-GAAP Measures to the Nearest 
Comparable U.S. GAAP Measures” in this Interim Report.


17
We believe that adjusted EBITDA, adjusted EBITA, commerce adjusted EBITA before key 
strategic investments, non-GAAP net income and non-GAAP diluted earnings per share/ADS help 
identify underlying trends in our business that could otherwise be distorted by the effect of certain 
income or expenses that we include in income from operations, net income and diluted earnings per 
share/ADS. We believe that these non-GAAP measures provide useful information about our core 
operating results, enhance the overall understanding of our past performance and future prospects 
and allow for greater visibility with respect to key metrics used by our management in its financial 
and operational decision-making. We present three different income measures, namely adjusted 
EBITDA, adjusted EBITA and non-GAAP net income, as well as one measure that provides 
supplemental information on our core commerce segment, namely commerce adjusted EBITA 
before key strategic investments, in order to provide more information and greater transparency to 
investors about our operating results.
We consider free cash flow to be a liquidity measure that provides useful information to 
management and investors about the amount of cash generated by our business that can be used 
for strategic corporate transactions, including investing in our new business initiatives, making 
strategic investments and acquisitions and strengthening our balance sheet.
Adjusted EBITDA, adjusted EBITA, commerce adjusted EBITA before key strategic investments, 
non-GAAP net income, non-GAAP diluted earnings per share/ADS and free cash flow should 
not be considered in isolation or construed as an alternative to income from operations, adjusted 
EBITA for commerce, net income, diluted earnings per share/ADS, cash flows or any other 
measure of performance or as an indicator of our operating performance. These non-GAAP 
financial measures presented here do not have standardized meanings prescribed by U.S. GAAP 
and may not be comparable to similarly titled measures presented by other companies. Other 
companies may calculate similarly titled measures differently, limiting their usefulness as 
comparative measures to our data.
Adjusted EBITDA represents net income before (i) interest and investment income, net, interest 
expense, other income, net, income tax expenses and share of results of equity method investees, 
(ii) certain non-cash expenses, consisting of share-based compensation expense, amortization of 
intangible assets, depreciation of property and equipment and operating lease cost relating to land 
use rights, which we do not believe are reflective of our core operating performance during the 
periods presented.
Adjusted EBITA represents net income before (i) interest and investment income, net, interest 
expense, other income, net, income tax expenses and share of results of equity method investees, 
(ii) certain non-cash expenses, consisting of share-based compensation expense and amortization of 
intangible assets, which we do not believe are reflective of our core operating performance during 
the periods presented.
Commerce adjusted EBITA before key strategic investments represents adjusted EBITA for 
commerce excluding the effects of (i) New Retail businesses (primarily Community Marketplaces, 
Freshippo, Tmall Supermarket, Sun Art and Taoxianda), (ii) Local Consumer Services, (iii) Taobao 
Deals, (iv) Lazada, (v) Cainiao Network, and others. Commerce adjusted EBITA before key 
strategic investments reflects the performance of our most established businesses, namely, those 
of our China retail marketplaces and wholesale marketplaces. By excluding certain businesses that 
are in the earlier stages of their development and with business approaches that continue to evolve, 
commerce adjusted EBITA before key strategic investments enables investors to clearly evaluate 
the performance of our most established businesses on a like-for-like basis.


18
Non-GAAP net income represents net income before share-based compensation expense, 
amortization of intangible assets, impairment of investments, gain or loss on deemed disposals/
disposals/revaluation of investments and others, as adjusted for the tax effects on non-GAAP 
adjustments.
Non-GAAP diluted earnings per share represents non-GAAP net income attributable to ordinary 
shareholders divided by the weighted average number of shares outstanding during the periods on 
a diluted basis. Non-GAAP diluted earnings per ADS represents non-GAAP diluted earnings per 
share after adjustment to the ordinary share-to-ADS ratio.
Free cash flow represents net cash provided by operating activities as presented in our 
consolidated cash flow statement less purchases of property and equipment (excluding acquisition 
of land use rights and construction in progress relating to office campuses) and intangible assets, 
as well as adjustments to exclude from net cash provided by operating activities the consumer 
protection fund deposits from merchants on our marketplaces. We deduct certain items of cash 
flows from investing activities in order to provide greater transparency into cash flow from 
our revenue-generating business operations. We exclude “acquisition of land use rights and 
construction in progress relating to office campuses” because the office campuses are used by us 
for corporate and administrative purposes and are not directly related to our revenue-generating 
business operations. We also exclude consumer protection fund deposits from merchants on our 
marketplaces because these deposits are restricted for the purpose of compensating consumers for 
claims against merchants.
The section entitled “Information by Segments” and the table captioned “Reconciliations of Non-
GAAP Measures to the Nearest Comparable U.S. GAAP Measures” in this Interim Report have 
more details on the non-GAAP financial measures that are most directly comparable to GAAP 
financial measures and the related reconciliations between these financial measures.

ALIBABA GROUP HOLDING LIMITED
阿里巴巴集團控股有限公司
INTERIM REPORT
FOR THE SIX MONTHS ENDED SEPTEMBER 30, 2022
EXPLANATORY NOTES
Alibaba Group Holding Limited (“Alibaba,” “we,” “our,” or “us”) prepared this interim report 
for the first six months of its fiscal year ending March 31, 2023 (the “Interim Report”) pursuant 
to Rule 13.48(1) of the Hong Kong Listing Rules. As an issuer listed on the Hong Kong Stock 
Exchange under Chapter 19C of the Hong Kong Listing Rules, we are exempted from the contents 
requirements in respect of interim reports under Appendix 16 of the Hong Kong Listing Rules.
For more information about our business and related risks, please refer to our annual report for the 
fiscal year ended March 31, 2022 (the “Annual Report”) published on the website of the Hong 
Kong Stock Exchange on July 26, 2022. Please note that the information contained in the Annual 
Report is up to date as of the date of the Annual Report, and we do not undertake any obligation to 
update the Annual Report, except as required under applicable law.
Capitalized terms used but not defined herein shall have the meanings ascribed to them in the 
Annual Report.
This Interim Report contains translations of certain Renminbi (“RMB”) amounts into U.S. dollars 
(“US$”) and Hong Kong dollars (“HK$”) for the convenience of the reader. Unless otherwise 
stated, all translations of RMB into US$ were made at RMB7.1135 to US$1.00, the exchange rate 
on September 30, 2022 as set forth in the H.10 statistical release of the Federal Reserve Board, 
and all translations of RMB into HK$ were made at RMB0.90444 to HK$1.00, the middle rate on 
September 30, 2022 as published by the People’s Bank of China. The percentages stated in this 
Interim Report are calculated based on the RMB amounts and there may be minor differences due 
to rounding.

FINANCIAL HIGHLIGHTS FOR THE SIX MONTHS ENDED SEPTEMBER 30, 2022
• 
Revenue was RMB412,731 million (US$58,021 million), an increase of 2% year-over-year.
• 
Income from operations was RMB50,080 million (US$7,040 million), an increase of 9% 
year-over-year. The year-over-year increase was primarily attributable to the decrease in 
share-based compensation expense and the increase in adjusted EBITA. We exclude share-
based compensation expense from our non-GAAP measurements. Adjusted EBITDA, a 
non-GAAP measurement, increased 1% year-over-year to RMB84,425 million (US$11,868 
million). Adjusted EBITA, a non-GAAP measurement, increased 1% year-over-year to 
RMB70,583 million (US$9,922 million). The year-over-year increases in adjusted EBITDA 
and adjusted EBITA were primarily due to the narrowed adjusted EBITA loss of Local 
consumer services, partly offset by the decrease in China commerce adjusted EBITA.
• 
Net income attributable to ordinary shareholders was RMB2,178 million (US$306 
million), and net loss was RMB2,169 million (US$305 million), compared to net income of 
RMB46,212 million in the same period of 2021, primarily attributable to an increase in net 
losses arising from the decrease in market prices of our equity investments in publicly-traded 
companies and a decrease in share of results of equity method investees. We excluded net 
gains or losses arising from the changes in fair value of our investments from our non-GAAP 
measurements. Non-GAAP net income was RMB64,072 million (US$9,007 million), a 
decrease of 11% year-over-year.
• 
Diluted earnings per ADS was RMB0.82 (US$0.12) and diluted earnings per share was 
RMB0.10 (US$0.01 or HK$0.11). Non-GAAP diluted earnings per ADS was RMB24.64 
(US$3.46) and non-GAAP diluted earnings per share was RMB3.08 (US$0.43 or 
HK$3.41), both of which decreased by 11% year-over-year.
• 
Net cash provided by operating activities was RMB80,981 million (US$11,384 million). 
Free cash flow was RMB57,882 million (US$8,137 million), an increase of 35% compared 
to RMB42,922 million in the same period of 2021, during which we made a partial payment 
in the amount of RMB9,114 million of the RMB18,228 million anti-monopoly fine. The 
year-over-year increase also reflected dividend received from Ant Group of RMB3,945 
million (US$555 million) in the six months ended September 30, 2022.
Reconciliations of GAAP measures to non-GAAP measures presented above are included at the 
end of this Interim Report.

(2) 
The year-over-year increase was primarily due to the decrease in share-based compensation expense and the 
increase in adjusted EBITA.
(3) 
The year-over-year increases were primarily due to the narrowed adjusted EBITA loss of Local consumer 
services driven by Ele.me’s improved unit economics per order, partly offset by the decrease in China 
commerce adjusted EBITA. The decrease in China commerce adjusted EBITA was primarily due to the decrease 
in customer management revenue, partly offset by Taobao Deals’ and Taocaicai’s reduced losses as a result of 
improved operating efficiency.
(4) 
The year-over-year changes were primarily attributable to an increase in net losses arising from the decrease in 
market prices of our equity investments in publicly-traded companies and a decrease in share of results of equity 
method investee. We excluded net gains or losses arising from the changes in fair value of our investments from 
our non-GAAP measurements.
(5) 
Each ADS represents eight ordinary shares.
(6) 
The year-over-year percentages as stated are calculated based on the exact amount and there may be minor 
differences from the year-over-year percentages calculated based on the RMB amounts after rounding.

Starting from the quarter ended December 31, 2021, our chief operating decision maker (“CODM”) started to review information under a new reporting structure, 
and segment reporting has been updated to conform to this change, which also provides greater transparency in our business progress and financial performance. Our 
updated segments comprise:
• 
China commerce, which mainly includes our China commerce retail businesses such as Taobao, Tmall, Taobao Deals, Taocaicai, Freshippo, Tmall Supermarket, 
Sun Art, Tmall Global and Alibaba Health, as well as wholesale business including 1688.com;
• 
International commerce, which mainly includes our international commerce retail and wholesale businesses such as Lazada, AliExpress, Trendyol, Daraz and 
Alibaba.com;
• 
Local consumer services, which mainly includes location-based services, such as Ele.me, Taoxianda, Amap (previously reported under the Innovation initiatives 
and others segment) and Fliggy;
• 
Cainiao, which mainly includes our domestic and international one-stop-shop logistics services and supply chain management solutions;
• 
Cloud, which is comprised of Alibaba Cloud and DingTalk;
• 
Digital media and entertainment, which is comprised of Youku, Quark, Alibaba Pictures, and other content and distribution platforms, as well as our online games 
business; and
• 
Innovation initiatives and others, which includes businesses such as DAMO Academy, Tmall Genie and others.
Comparative figures were reclassified to conform to this presentation.
(1) 
Unallocated expenses primarily relate to corporate administrative costs and other miscellaneous items that are not allocated to individual segments. The 
equity-settled donation expense was related to the allotment of shares to a charitable trust, which is presented as an unallocated item in the segment information 
because our management does not consider this as part of the segment operating performance measure.
(2) 
For a more intuitive presentation, widening of loss in YoY% is shown in terms of negative growth rate, and narrowing of loss in YoY% is shown in terms of 
positive growth rate.

China Commerce
(i) 
Segment revenue
• 
China Commerce Retail Business
Revenue from our China commerce retail business for the six months ended September 
30, 2022 was RMB268,199 million (US$37,703 million), a decrease of 1% compared 
to RMB272,051 million for the same period of 2021. Customer management revenue 
declined 8% year-over-year, primarily due to mid-single-digit decline of online physical 
goods GMV generated on Taobao and Tmall, excluding unpaid orders year-over-year, 
and increased order cancellation due to the impacts from COVID-19 resurgence and 
restrictions that resulted in supply chain and logistics disruptions, as well as on-going 
competition.
Direct sales and others revenue under China commerce retail business for the six 
months ended September 30, 2022 was RMB129,439 million (US$18,196 million), 
achieving year-over-year growth of 7% compared to RMB120,523 million for the same 
period of 2021. The increase was primarily due to the revenue growth contributed by 
our Freshippo and Alibaba Health’s direct sales businesses.
• 
China Commerce Wholesale Business
Revenue from our China commerce wholesale business for the six months ended 
September 30, 2022 was RMB9,167 million (US$1,289 million), an increase of 13% 
compared to RMB8,098 million for the same period of 2021. The increase was primarily 
due to an increase in revenue from value-added services to wholesale buyers and paying 
members.
(ii) Segment adjusted EBITA
China commerce adjusted EBITA decreased by 5% to RMB87,554 million (US$12,308 
million) for the six months ended September 30, 2022, compared to RMB92,176 million for 
the same period of 2021, primarily due to the decrease in customer management revenue, 
partly offset by Taobao Deals’ and Taocaicai’s reduced losses as a result of improved 
operating efficiency, which also led to the decrease in adjusted EBITA margin from 33% 
for the six months ended September 30, 2021 to 32% for the six months ended September 
30, 2022. During the six months ended September 30, 2022, Taobao Deals significantly 
narrowed losses year-over-year, driven by optimized spending in user acquisition. Taocaicai 
significantly narrowed losses year-over-year, driven by optimized pricing strategy, enhanced 
sourcing capability and lowered operation and fulfillment costs.


8
International Commerce
(i) 
Segment revenue
• 
International Commerce Retail Business
Revenue from our International commerce retail business for the six months ended 
September 30, 2022 was RMB21,262 million (US$2,989 million), remained stable 
year-over-year compared to RMB21,175 million for the same period of 2021. Revenue 
contributed by Trendyol increased as a result of the strong order growth from its 
e-commerce business and optimization of subsidies offered that were contra revenue of 
Trendyol, and revenue contributed by Lazada increased mainly due to active increase in 
monetization initiatives that resulted in higher monetization rate. These increases were 
partly offset by the decrease in revenue contributed by AliExpress due to declining 
orders as a result of change in the European Union’s VAT rules, depreciation of Euro 
against U.S. dollar, as well as ongoing supply chain and logistics disruptions due to the 
Russia-Ukraine conflict.
• 
International Commerce Wholesale Business
Revenue from our International commerce wholesale business for the six months ended 
September 30, 2022 was RMB9,936 million (US$1,397 million), an increase of 9% 
compared to RMB9,119 million for the same period of 2021. The increase was primarily 
due to an increase in revenue generated by cross-border related value-added services.
(ii) Segment adjusted EBITA
International commerce adjusted EBITA was a loss of RMB2,527 million (US$355 million) 
for the six months ended September 30, 2022, compared to a loss of RMB3,511 million in the 
same period of 2021. The decrease in loss year-over-year was primarily due to the reduced 
losses from Lazada. Reduced losses from Lazada was a result of continued improvement 
in monetization rate by offering more value-added services as well as enhancing operating 
efficiency.
Local Consumer Services
(i) 
Segment revenue
Revenue from Local consumer services, which includes “To-Home” and “To-Destination” 
businesses such as Ele.me, Amap and Fliggy, was RMB23,705 million (US$3,332 million) 
for the six months ended September 30, 2022, an increase of 13% compared to RMB20,905 
million for the same period of 2021, primarily due to higher average order value and more 
efficient use of subsidies that were contra revenue of Ele.me, as well as strong growth of 
Amap orders.


9
(ii) Segment adjusted EBITA
Local consumer services adjusted EBITA was a loss of RMB6,537 million (US$919 million) 
for the six months ended September 30, 2022, compared to a loss of RMB11,305 million 
in the same period of 2021, primarily due to the continued narrowing of losses from our 
“To-Home” and “To-Destination” businesses. Narrowing of loss from our “To-Home” 
business was driven by Ele.me’s improved unit economics per order, which was due to 
increased average order value year-over-year, reduced delivery cost per order and optimized 
user acquisition spending. Narrowing of loss from our “To-Destination” business was 
driven by the strong order growth of Amap business, as well as optimized spending in user 
acquisition.
Cainiao
(i) 
Segment revenue
Revenue from Cainiao Network’s logistics services, which represents revenue from its 
domestic and international one-stop-shop logistics services and supply chain management 
solutions, after elimination of inter-company transactions, was RMB25,509 million 
(US$3,586 million) for the six months ended September 30, 2022, an increase of 19% 
compared to RMB21,447 million for the same period of 2021, primarily contributed by the 
increase in revenue from domestic consumer logistics services as a result of service model 
upgrade since late 2021 where Cainiao takes on more responsibilities throughout the logistics 
process to better serve customers and enhance customer experience, and partly offset by 
the decrease in revenue from international logistics services. The decrease in revenue from 
international logistics services was primarily due to the decrease in international orders from 
AliExpress, partly offset by the increase in international fulfillment solution services.
Total revenue generated by Cainiao, before inter-segment elimination, which includes revenue 
from services provided to other Alibaba businesses, was RMB35,574 million (US$5,001 
million), an increase of 16% compared to RMB30,757 million in the same period of 2021. 
This increase also reflected the growth of fulfillment solutions and value-added services 
provided to our China commerce retail businesses, such as Tmall, Taobao and Taobao Deals.
(ii) Segment adjusted EBITA
Cainiao adjusted EBITA was a loss of RMB60 million (US$8 million) for the six months 
ended September 30, 2022, compared to a loss of RMB461 million in the same period of 
2021.
Cloud
(i) 
Segment revenue
Revenue from our Cloud segment, which comprises Alibaba Cloud and DingTalk, after 
inter-segment elimination, was RMB38,442 million (US$5,404 million) for the six months 
ended September 30, 2022, an increase of 7% compared to RMB36,058 million for the same 
period of 2021. Year-over-year revenue growth of our Cloud segment reflected the strong 
revenue growth from non-Internet industries driven by financial services, public services 
and telecommunication industries, partly offset by a decline in revenue from customers in 


10
the Internet industry mainly driven by declining revenue from the top Internet customer that 
has gradually stopped using our overseas cloud services for its international business due 
to non-product related requirements and online education customers, as well as softening 
demand from other customers in China’s Internet industry.
Total revenue from our Cloud segment, before inter-segment elimination, which includes 
revenue from services provided to other Alibaba businesses, was RMB50,698 million 
(US$7,127 million), an increase of 5% compared to RMB48,448 million in the same period 
of 2021.
(ii) Segment adjusted EBITA
Cloud adjusted EBITA was RMB681 million (US$96 million) for the six months ended 
September 30, 2022, compared to RMB736 million for the same period of 2021.
Digital Media and Entertainment
(i) 
Segment revenue
Revenue from our Digital media and entertainment segment for the six months ended 
September 30, 2022 was RMB15,623 million (US$2,196 million), a decrease of 3% compared 
to RMB16,154 million for the same period of 2021, primarily due to the decrease in online 
games business revenue.
(ii) Segment adjusted EBITA
Adjusted EBITA for the six months ended September 30, 2022 was a loss of RMB747 million 
(US$105 million), compared to a loss of RMB1,350 million for the same period of 2021, 
primarily due to narrowing loss of Youku.
Innovation initiatives and others
(i) 
Segment revenue
Revenue from Innovation initiatives and others for the six months ended September 30, 2022 
was RMB888 million (US$125 million), a decrease of 38% compared to RMB1,423 million 
for the same period of 2021.
(ii) Segment adjusted EBITA
Adjusted EBITA for the six months ended September 30, 2022 was a loss of RMB3,842 
million (US$540 million), compared to a loss of RMB3,068 million for the same period of 
2021, primarily due to our investments in technology and innovation.

This represents Alibaba Group share-based awards granted to our employees.
(2) 
This represents Ant Group share-based awards granted to our employees, which is subject to mark-to-market 
accounting treatment.
(3) 
This represents share-based awards of our subsidiaries.
Share-based compensation expense related to Alibaba Group share-based awards decreased in 
the six months ended September 30, 2022 compared to the same period of 2021. This decrease is 
primarily due to the general decrease in the average fair market value of the awards granted.
We expect that our share-based compensation expense will continue to be affected by changes in 
the fair value of the underlying awards and the quantity of awards we grant in the future.
Amortization of intangible assets – Amortization of intangible assets for the six months ended 
September 30, 2022 was RMB5,480 million (US$770 million), a decrease of 8% from RMB5,979 
million for the same period of 2021.
Income from operations and operating margin
Income from operations for the six months ended September 30, 2022 was RMB50,080 million 
(US$7,040 million), or 12% of revenue, an increase of 9% compared to RMB45,853 million, 
or 11% of revenue, for the same period of 2021, primarily due to the decrease in share-based 
compensation expense and the increase in adjusted EBITA.

Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITA
Adjusted EBITDA increased 1% year-over-year to RMB84,425 million (US$11,868 million) for 
the six months ended September 30, 2022, compared to RMB83,468 million for the same period of 
2021. Adjusted EBITA increased 1% year-over-year to RMB70,583 million (US$9,922 million) for 
the six months ended September 30, 2022, compared to RMB69,764 million for the same period of 
2021. The year-over-year increase in adjusted EBITA was primarily due to the narrowed adjusted 
EBITA loss of Local consumer services driven by Ele.me’s improved unit economics per order, 
partly offset by the decrease in China commerce adjusted EBITA. The decrease in China commerce 
adjusted EBITA was primarily due to the decrease in customer management revenue, partly offset 
by Taobao Deals’ and Taocaicai’s reduced losses as a result of improved operating efficiency. A 
reconciliation of net income (loss) to adjusted EBITDA and adjusted EBITA is included at the end 
of this Interim Report.
Adjusted EBITA and Adjusted EBITA margin by segments
Adjusted EBITA and adjusted EBITA margin by segments as well as a reconciliation of income 
from operations to adjusted EBITA are set forth in the section entitles “Information by Segments” 
above.
Interest and investment income, net
Interest and investment income, net for the six months ended September 30, 2022 was a loss of 
RMB37,083 million (US$5,213 million), compared to a gain of RMB2,645 million for the same 
period of 2021, primarily due to the increase in net losses arising from the decrease in market 
prices of our equity investments in publicly-traded companies for the six months ended September 
30, 2022.
The above-mentioned investment related gains/losses were excluded from our non-GAAP net 
income.
Other income, net
Other income, net for the six months ended September 30, 2022 was RMB3,053 million (US$429 
million), compared to RMB3,820 million for the same period of 2021, primarily due to the net 
exchange loss for the six months ended September 30, 2022, compared to the net exchange gain 
for the same period of 2021.
Income tax expenses
Income tax expenses for the six months ended September 30, 2022 were RMB7,971 million 
(US$1,120 million), compared to RMB15,183 million for the same period of 2021.
Excluding share-based compensation expense, revaluation and disposal gains/losses of investments, 
impairment of investments, as well as deferred tax effects on basis differences arising from our 
equity method investees, our effective tax rate would have been 19% for the six months ended 
September 30, 2022.


15
Share of results of equity method investees
Share of results of equity method investees for the six months ended September 30, 2022 was a 
loss of RMB7,616 million (US$1,071 million), compared to a profit of RMB11,611 million for 
the same period of 2021. Share of results of equity method investees for the six months ended 
September 30, 2022 and the comparative period consisted of the following:

“Others” mainly include amortization of intangible assets of equity method investees, share-based compensation

loss arising from the dilution of our investments in equity method investees.
We record our share of results of all equity method investees one quarter in arrears. The 
year-over-year decrease in share of profit of Ant Group was due to the decrease in Ant Group’s 
operating profit and the net decrease in fair values of investments held by Ant Group. In addition, 
we recorded an impairment loss of RMB7,189 million (US$1,011 million) in the six months ended 
September 30, 2022 with respect to certain equity method investees as a result of severe and 
prolonged decline in fair values of certain equity method investees against their respective carrying 
value.


16
Net income (loss) and Non-GAAP net income
Our net loss for the six months ended September 30, 2022 was RMB2,169 million (US$305 
million), compared to net income of RMB46,212 million for the same period of 2021. The decrease 
was primarily attributable to the increase in net losses arising from the decrease in market prices 
of our equity investments in publicly-traded companies and a decrease in share of results of equity 
method investees.
Excluding share-based compensation expense, revaluation and disposal gains/losses of investments, 
impairment of investments and certain other items, non-GAAP net income for the six months 
ended September 30, 2022 was RMB64,072 million (US$9,007 million), a decrease of 11% 
compared to RMB71,965 million for the same period of 2021. A reconciliation of net income (loss) 
to non-GAAP net income is included at the end of this Interim Report.
Net income attributable to ordinary shareholders
Net income attributable to ordinary shareholders for the six months ended September 30, 2022 was 
RMB2,178 million (US$306 million), a decrease of 96% compared to RMB50,508 million for the 
same period of 2021, which was primarily attributable to the increase in net losses arising from the 
decrease in market prices of our equity investments in publicly-traded companies and a decrease in 
share of results of equity method investees.
Diluted earnings per ADS/share and non-GAAP diluted earnings per ADS/share
Diluted earnings per ADS for the six months ended September 30, 2022 was RMB0.82 (US$0.12) 
on a weighted average of 21,329 million diluted shares outstanding during the period, a decrease of 
96% compared to RMB18.44 on a weighted average of 21,916 million diluted shares outstanding 
during the same period in 2021. Excluding share-based compensation expense, revaluation 
and disposal gains/losses of investments, impairment of investments and certain other items, 
non-GAAP diluted earnings per ADS for the six months ended September 30, 2022 was RMB24.64 
(US$3.46), a decrease of 11% compared to RMB27.84 for the same period of 2021.
Diluted earnings per share for the six months ended September 30, 2022 was RMB0.10 (US$0.01 
or HK$0.11), a decrease of 96% compared to RMB2.30 for the same period of 2021. Excluding 
share-based compensation expense, revaluation and disposal gains/losses of investments, 
impairment of investments and certain other items, non-GAAP diluted earnings per share for the 
six months ended September 30, 2022 was RMB3.08 (US$0.43 or HK$3.41), a decrease of 11%, 
compared to RMB3.48 for the same period of 2021.
A reconciliation of diluted earnings per ADS/share to non-GAAP diluted earnings per ADS/share 
is included at the end of this Interim Report. Each ADS represents eight ordinary shares.

Cash and cash equivalents, short-term investments and other treasury investments
As of September 30, 2022, cash and cash equivalents, short-term investments and other treasury 
investments included in equity securities and other investments on the consolidated balance sheets, 
were RMB484,877 million (US$68,163 million), compared to RMB446,412 million as of March 31, 
2022. Other treasury investments consist of fixed deposits with original maturities over one year. 
The increase in cash and cash equivalents, short-term investments and other treasury investments 
during the six months ended September 30, 2022 was primarily due to free cash flow generated 
from operations of RMB57,882 million (US$8,137 million) and effect of exchange rate changes of 
RMB19,588 million (US$2,754 million) mainly due to the appreciation of the U.S. dollar against 
Renminbi, partly offset by cash used in repurchase of ordinary shares of RMB37,680 million 
(US$5,297 million) and net cash used in investment and acquisition activities of RMB4,208 million 
(US$592 million).
Net cash from operating activities and free cash flow
Net cash provided by operating activities for the six months ended September 30, 2022 was 
RMB80,981 million (US$11,384 million), an increase of 17% compared to RMB69,433 million for 
the same period of 2021. Free cash flow, a non-GAAP measurement of liquidity, for the six months 
ended September 30, 2022 increased by 35% to RMB57,882 million (US$8,137 million), from 
RMB42,922 million for the same period of 2021, during which we made a partial payment in the 
amount of RMB9,114 million of the RMB18,228 million anti-monopoly fine. The year-over-year 
increase also reflected dividend received from Ant Group of RMB3,945 million (US$555 million) 
in the six months ended September 30, 2022. A reconciliation of net cash provided by operating 
activities to free cash flow is included at the end of this Interim Report.
Net cash used in investing activities
For the six months ended September 30, 2022, net cash used in investing activities of RMB35,755 
million (US$5,026 million) primarily reflected (i) capital expenditures of RMB23,955 million 
(US$3,368 million), (ii) cash outflow of RMB10,586 million (US$1,488 million) for investment 
and acquisition activities, as well as (iii) an increase in other treasury investments by RMB8,000 
million (US$1,125 million). These cash outflows were partly offset by cash inflow of RMB6,378 
million (US$896 million) from disposal of investments.
Net cash used in financing activities
For the six months ended September 30, 2022, net cash used in financing activities of RMB32,492 
million (US$4,568 million) primarily reflected cash used in repurchase of ordinary shares of 
RMB37,680 million (US$5,297 million).
Employees
As of September 30, 2022, we had a total of 243,903 employees, compared to 254,941 as of March

NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES
To supplement our consolidated financial statements, which are prepared and presented in 
accordance with GAAP, we use the following non-GAAP financial measures: for our consolidated 
results, adjusted EBITDA (including adjusted EBITDA margin), adjusted EBITA (including 
adjusted EBITA margin), non-GAAP net income, non-GAAP diluted earnings per share/ADS and 
free cash flow. For more information on these non-GAAP financial measures, please refer to the 
section entitled “Information by Segments” and the table captioned “Reconciliations of Non-GAAP 
Measures to the Nearest Comparable U.S. GAAP Measures” in this Interim Report.


19
We believe that adjusted EBITDA, adjusted EBITA, non-GAAP net income and non-GAAP diluted 
earnings per share/ADS help identify underlying trends in our business that could otherwise be 
distorted by the effect of certain income or expenses that we include in income from operations, 
net income and diluted earnings per share/ADS. We believe that these non-GAAP measures 
provide useful information about our core operating results, enhance the overall understanding 
of our past performance and future prospects and allow for greater visibility with respect to key 
metrics used by our management in its financial and operational decision-making. We present three 
different income measures, namely adjusted EBITDA, adjusted EBITA and non-GAAP net income 
in order to provide more information and greater transparency to investors about our operating 
results.
We consider free cash flow to be a liquidity measure that provides useful information to 
management and investors about the amount of cash generated by our business that can be used 
for strategic corporate transactions, including investing in our new business initiatives, making 
strategic investments and acquisitions and strengthening our balance sheet.
Adjusted EBITDA, adjusted EBITA, non-GAAP net income, non-GAAP diluted earnings per 
share/ADS and free cash flow should not be considered in isolation or construed as an alternative 
to income from operations, net income, diluted earnings per share/ADS, cash flows or any other 
measure of performance or as an indicator of our operating performance. These non-GAAP 
financial measures presented here do not have standardized meanings prescribed by U.S. GAAP 
and may not be comparable to similarly titled measures presented by other companies. Other 
companies may calculate similarly titled measures differently, limiting their usefulness as 
comparative measures to our data.
Adjusted EBITDA represents net income before (i) interest and investment income, net, interest 
expense, other income, net, income tax expenses and share of results of equity method investees, 
(ii) certain non-cash expenses, consisting of share-based compensation expense, amortization of 
intangible assets and, depreciation and impairment of property and equipment, operating lease cost 
relating to land use rights, as well as equity-settled donation expense, which we do not believe are 
reflective of our core operating performance during the periods presented.
Adjusted EBITA represents net income before (i) interest and investment income, net, interest 
expense, other income, net, income tax expenses and share of results of equity method investees, 
(ii) certain non-cash expenses, consisting of share-based compensation expense and amortization of 
intangible assets, as well as equity-settled donation expense, which we do not believe are reflective 
of our core operating performance during the periods presented.


20
Non-GAAP net income represents net income before share-based compensation expense, 
amortization of intangible assets, impairment of investments, gain or loss on deemed disposals/
disposals/revaluation of investments, equity-settled donation expense and others, as adjusted for 
the tax effects.
Non-GAAP diluted earnings per share represents non-GAAP net income attributable to ordinary 
shareholders divided by the weighted average number of shares for computing non-GAAP 
diluted earnings per share, on a diluted basis. Non-GAAP diluted earnings per ADS represents 
non-GAAP diluted earnings per share after adjusting for the ordinary share-to-ADS ratio.
Free cash flow represents net cash provided by operating activities as presented in our 
consolidated cash flow statement less purchases of property and equipment (excluding acquisition 
of land use rights and construction in progress relating to office campuses) and intangible assets 
(excluding those acquired through acquisitions), as well as adjustments to exclude from net cash 
provided by operating activities the consumer protection fund deposits from merchants on our 
marketplaces. We deduct certain items of cash flows from investing activities in order to provide 
greater transparency into cash flow from our revenue-generating business operations. We exclude 
“acquisition of land use rights and construction in progress relating to office campuses” because 
the office campuses are used by us for corporate and administrative purposes and are not directly 
related to our revenue-generating business operations. We also exclude consumer protection fund 
deposits from merchants on our marketplaces because these deposits are restricted for the purpose 
of compensating consumers for claims against merchants.
The section entitled “Information by Segments” and the table captioned “Reconciliations of 
Non-GAAP Measures to the Nearest Comparable U.S. GAAP Measures” in this Interim Report 
have more details on the non-GAAP financial measures that are most directly comparable to GAAP 
financial measures and the related reconciliations between these financial measures.
