AbbVie Completes Acquisition of Cerevel Therapeutics
Cerevel's clinical-stage assets complement AbbVie's emerging neuroscience pipeline and leading on-market brands in psychiatry, migraine and Parkinson's disease
Emraclidine, a potential best-in-class, next-generation antipsychotic, is in trials designed to be registration enabling for schizophrenia
Cerevel is a strong strategic fit for AbbVie and has potential to meaningfully impact revenue into the next decade
AbbVie reaffirms previously issued 2024 full-year adjusted diluted EPS guidance range of $10.71-$10.91; reaffirms previously issued third-quarter adjusted diluted
EPS guidance range of $2.92-$2.96
NORTH CHICAGO, Ill., Aug. 1, 2024 /PRNewswire/ -- AbbVie (NYSE: ABBV) today announced that it has completed its acquisition of Cerevel Therapeutics (NASDAQ:
CERE). With the completion of the acquisition, Cerevel is now part of AbbVie.
"AbbVie's acquisition of Cerevel strengthens our foundation in neuroscience and positions us to deliver sustainable long-term performance into the next decade and
beyond," said Robert A. Michael, chief executive officer, AbbVie. "Our new Cerevel colleagues share our commitment to deliver meaningful change for patients living with
neurological and psychiatric conditions. We are excited to welcome the talented Cerevel team to AbbVie."
There are multiple programs in Cerevel's pipeline across several neurological and psychiatric conditions such as schizophrenia, Parkinson's disease and mood disorders,
where there continues to be significant unmet need for patients. Cerevel's pipeline is highly complementary to AbbVie's existing neuroscience portfolio and the completion
of the acquisition is an important step forward to delivering new and better tolerated therapies.
Emraclidine, a potential best-in-class, next-generation antipsychotic, is a positive allosteric modulator (PAM) of the muscarinic M4 receptor that is being studied for the
treatment of schizophrenia – a disease that affects approximately 24 million people worldwide.1 In a Phase 1b study, emraclidine has shown promising efficacy and safety
and is currently completing two Phase 2 trials that were designed to be registration enabling.
Tavapadon, a first-in-class dopamine D1/D5 selective partial agonist for the management of Parkinson's disease, is currently in Phase 3 studies and has potential for both
monotherapy and adjunctive treatment. Tavapadon's efficacy and safety-tolerability profile could enable its utility in early Parkinson's disease, becoming a near-term
complementary asset to AbbVie's existing symptomatic therapies for advanced Parkinson's disease. Recently, tavapadon met the primary endpoint in a pivotal Phase 3 study
and data from additional Phase 3 trials of tavapadon are expected later this year.
CVL-354, currently in Phase 1, is a potential best-in-class kappa opioid receptor (KOR) antagonist that has the potential to provide significantly improved efficacy and
tolerability compared to existing treatments for major depressive disorder (MDD). Darigabat, currently in Phase 2, is an alpha 2/3/5 selective GABAA receptor PAM for
treatment-resistant epilepsy and panic disorder.
For additional background on the acquisition, please read the announcement press release here and view AbbVie's investor presentation here.
Financial Terms
AbbVie has acquired all outstanding Cerevel common stock for $45.00 per share. It is expected that Cerevel's common stock will cease to trade on the NASDAQ stock
exchange prior to market open on August 1, 2024. This acquisition is expected to be accretive to adjusted diluted earnings per share (EPS) beginning in 2030.
Full-Year 2024 Outlook


AbbVie is reaffirming its previously issued 2024 full-year adjusted diluted EPS guidance range of $10.71-$10.91. This guidance includes a $0.19 per share dilutive impact
related to the completed Cerevel acquisition. AbbVie's 2024 adjusted diluted EPS guidance includes an unfavorable impact of $0.60 per share related to acquired IPR&D
and milestones expense incurred year-to-date through the second quarter. The company's 2024 adjusted diluted EPS guidance excludes any impact from acquired IPR&D
and milestones that may be incurred beyond the second quarter of 2024, as both cannot be reliably forecasted.
AbbVie is reaffirming its previously issued 2024 third-quarter adjusted diluted EPS guidance range of $2.92-$2.96. AbbVie's 2024 third-quarter adjusted
diluted EPS guidance excludes any impact from acquired IPR&D and milestones that may be incurred in the quarter, as both cannot be reliably forecasted.

Recent Events
AbbVie announced that its board of directors unanimously selected Robert A. Michael, AbbVie's current president and chief operating officer, to succeed Richard A.
Gonzalez as the company's chief executive officer (CEO). Mr. Gonzalez, who has served as CEO since AbbVie's formation in 2013, will retire from the role of CEO
and become executive chairman of the board of directors, effective July 1, 2024. Additionally, the board has appointed Mr. Michael as a member of the board of
directors effective July 1, 2024.
AbbVie announced that it completed its acquisition of ImmunoGen. This transaction added ImmunoGen's flagship antibody-drug conjugate (ADC), Elahere
(mirvetuximab soravtansine-gynx), for folate receptor-alpha (FRα)-positive platinum-resistant ovarian cancer (PROC), to AbbVie's portfolio. Late-stage development
programs for Elahere provide opportunity to expand into additional patient populations. The transaction also included a pipeline of ADCs that further build on
AbbVie's existing oncology pipeline of novel targeted therapies and next-generation immuno-oncology assets, which have the potential to create new treatment
possibilities across multiple solid tumors and hematologic malignancies.
AbbVie announced that the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) granted full approval for Elahere for the treatment of FRα-positive, platinum-resistant
epithelial ovarian, fallopian tube or primary peritoneal adult cancer patients treated with up to three prior therapies. The full approval of Elahere was based on the
confirmatory MIRASOL Phase 3 trial in which data showed that Elahere treatment resulted in an overall survival (OS) benefit and reduced the risk of cancer
progression by 35%.
AbbVie announced that the FDA granted Priority Review of the supplemental Biologics License Application (sBLA) for Epkinly (epcoritamab), for the treatment of
adult relapsed or refractory (R/R) follicular lymphoma (FL) after two or more lines of therapy. If approved, Epkinly will be the only subcutaneous bispecific antibody
to treat adults with R/R FL after two lines of prior therapy, marking its second indication following FDA and European Medicines Agency (EMA) approval of R/R
third-line diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) treatment. The FDA had previously granted this investigational indication Breakthrough Therapy Designation
(BTD). The sBLA is supported by data from the Phase 1/2 EPCORE NHL-1 clinical trial. Epkinly is being co-developed by AbbVie and Genmab.
AbbVie announced positive top-line results from the Phase 3 SELECT-GCA study, showing Rinvoq (upadacitinib, 15 mg, once daily) in combination with a 26-week
steroid taper regimen achieved its primary endpoint of sustained remission from week 12 through week 52 in adults with giant cell arteritis (GCA). In this study, 46
percent of patients receiving Rinvoq in combination with a 26-week steroid taper regimen achieved sustained remission compared to 29 percent of patients receiving
placebo in combination with a 52-week steroid taper regimen. Rinvoq's safety profile in GCA was generally consistent with that in approved indications, and no new
safety signals were identified.
AbbVie announced positive topline results from the Phase 3b/4 LEVEL UP study, that evaluated the efficacy and safety of Rinvoq (15 mg, once daily starting dose
and dose-adjusted based on clinical response) versus Dupixent (dupilumab) in adults and adolescents with moderate to severe atopic dermatitis (AD) who had
inadequate response to systemic therapy or when use of those therapies was inadvisable. Rinvoq demonstrated superiority versus Dupixent in the primary endpoint of
simultaneous achievement of near complete skin clearance (Eczema Area and Severity Index 90) and no to little itch (Worst Pruritus Numerical Rating Scale of 0 or
1) at Week 16. Rinvoq also showed superiority versus Dupixent for all ranked secondary endpoints, including the rapid onset of achieving near complete skin
clearance and no to little itch. The safety profile of Rinvoq was consistent with the profile in previous AD studies with no new safety signals identified during the 16-
week period.


At the Congress of European Crohn's and Colitis Organisation (ECCO), AbbVie presented 17 abstracts, including nine oral presentations and eight posters, from a
range of studies across its inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) portfolio. Oral presentations included new post-hoc analysis of clinical and endoscopic outcomes from
the Phase 3 SEQUENCE trial comparing Skyrizi (risankizumab) versus Stelara (ustekinumab) in patients with moderate to severe Crohn's disease (CD), results from
the Phase 3 COMMAND study of Skyrizi as a maintenance therapy in adult patients with moderately to severely active ulcerative colitis (UC), and long-term safety
results from the Phase 3 U-ENDURE trial of Rinvoq in adult patients with moderately to severely active CD. Skyrizi is part of a collaboration between Boehringer
Ingelheim and AbbVie, with AbbVie leading development and commercialization globally.
At the 2024 American Academy of Dermatology (AAD) Annual Meeting, AbbVie presented 29 abstracts including three late-breaking presentations. The presented
data across AbbVie and Allergan Aesthetics' extensive portfolios reinforce the companies' ongoing commitment to developing transformative medical dermatology
and aesthetic treatments to advance and redefine the standard of care for patients.
Allergan Aesthetics announced the FDA approval of Juvederm Voluma XC for injection in the temple region to improve moderate to severe temple hollowing in
adults over the age of 21. Juvederm Voluma XC is the first and only hyaluronic acid (HA) dermal filler to receive FDA approval for the improvement of moderate to
severe temple hollowing with results lasting up to 13 months with optimal treatment.
At the American Academy of Neurology (AAN) Annual Meeting, AbbVie announced an interim analysis of an ongoing 156-week extension study that supports the
long-term safety, tolerability and efficacy of Qulipta (atogepant) to prevent chronic and episodic migraine. The overall long-term safety results were consistent with
the known safety profile of Qulipta in chronic and episodic migraine, and no new safety signals were identified. These results also support improvements in key
efficacy outcomes, including reduction in monthly acute medication use days.
AbbVie and Landos Biopharma announced a definitive agreement under which AbbVie will acquire Landos, a clinical stage biopharmaceutical company focused on
the development of novel, oral therapeutics for patients with autoimmune diseases. Landos' lead investigational asset is NX-13, a first-in-class, oral NLRX1 agonist
in Phase 2 for the treatment of UC.
AbbVie and OSE Immunotherapeutics, a clinical-stage immunotherapy company, announced a strategic partnership to develop OSE-230, a monoclonal antibody
designed to resolve chronic and severe inflammation, currently in the pre-clinical development stage.
AbbVie and Tentarix Biotherapeutics announced a multi-year collaboration focused on the discovery and development of conditionally-active, multi-specific biologic
candidates in oncology and immunology. The collaboration will leverage AbbVie's therapeutic area expertise and Tentarix's Tentacles platform.
Full-Year 2024 Outlook
AbbVie is raising its adjusted diluted EPS guidance for the full year 2024 from $10.97 - $11.17 to $11.13 - $11.33, which includes an unfavorable impact of $0.08 per share
related to acquired IPR&D and milestones expense incurred during the first quarter 2024. The company's 2024 adjusted diluted EPS guidance excludes any impact from
acquired IPR&D and milestones that may be incurred beyond the first quarter of 2024, as both cannot be reliably forecasted.

Recent Events


As previously announced, Robert A. Michael assumed the role of chief executive officer (CEO) and has joined AbbVie's Board of Directors, effective July 1, 2024.
Mr. Michael succeeds Richard A. Gonzalez, who served as CEO since the company's inception in 2013. Mr. Gonzalez has become executive chairman of the board of
directors.
 
AbbVie announced the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved Skyrizi (risankizumab) for adults with moderately to severely active ulcerative colitis
(UC). AbbVie also announced that the European Medicines Agency's (EMA) Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP) adopted a positive opinion
recommending the approval of Skyrizi for the treatment of adults with moderately to severely active UC who have had an inadequate response, lost response, or were
intolerant to either conventional or biologic therapy. The FDA approval and positive CHMP opinion are based on results from two pivotal Phase 3 trials, INSPIRE
and COMMAND, that evaluated the efficacy and safety of Skyrizi in adults with moderately to severely active UC. Skyrizi is part of a collaboration between
Boehringer Ingelheim and AbbVie, with AbbVie leading development and commercialization globally.
 
AbbVie announced that it submitted applications for a new indication to the FDA and EMA for Rinvoq (upadacitinib) for the treatment of adult patients with giant
cell arteritis (GCA). The regulatory submissions are supported by results from the SELECT-GCA Phase 3 study evaluating the safety and efficacy of Rinvoq in
patients with GCA.
 
At the 2024 Digestive Disease Week (DDW) Annual Meeting, AbbVie presented 15 abstracts, including three oral presentations, reinforcing AbbVie's commitment to
advancing the standards of care in inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD). Highlights included data from the SEQUENCE head-to-head trial comparing Skyrizi versus
Stelara (ustekinumab) in Crohn's disease (CD), as well as presentations that included efficacy and safety data evaluating clinical, endoscopic, and histologic outcomes
from both the INSPIRE Phase 3 induction study and the COMMAND Phase 3 maintenance study of Skyrizi as a therapy for adults with moderately to severely active
UC.
 
AbbVie announced that it completed its acquisition of Landos Biopharma. The transaction adds the first-in-class investigational asset, ABBV-113 (NX-13), to
AbbVie's pipeline, which has the potential to offer a novel approach to the treatment of UC and CD.
 
AbbVie and FutureGen Biopharmaceutical announced a license agreement to develop FG-M701, a next generation anti-TL1A antibody for the treatment of IBD,
currently in preclinical development. FG-M701 is uniquely engineered with potential best-in-class functional characteristics compared to first-generation anti-TL1A
antibodies, with the goal to drive greater efficacy and less frequent dosing as a therapy for IBD.
 
AbbVie announced the acquisition of Celsius Therapeutics, a privately held biotechnology company pioneering new therapies for patients with inflammatory disease.
Celsius' lead investigational asset is CEL383, a potential first-in-class anti-TREM1 antibody for the treatment of IBD that has completed a Phase 1 clinical study.
 
AbbVie announced the FDA approved Epkinly (epcoritamab) to treat patients with relapsed or refractory (r/r) follicular lymphoma (FL) after two or more lines of
prior therapy. AbbVie also announced that the EMA's CHMP adopted a positive opinion for Tepkinly (epcoritamab) for the treatment of adults with r/r FL. The FDA
approval and positive CHMP opinion are based on results from the Phase 1/2 EPCORE NHL-1 clinical trial, which evaluated the safety and efficacy of
Epkinly/Tepkinly in adult patients with r/r FL. Epkinly/Tepkinly is being co-developed by AbbVie and Genmab.
 
AbbVie announced positive topline results from the Phase 2 PICCOLO trial evaluating Elahere (mirvetuximab soravtansine) monotherapy in heavily pre-treated
patients with folate receptor-alpha (FRα) positive, platinum-sensitive ovarian cancer (PSOC). The trial met its primary endpoint with an objective response rate
(ORR) of 51.9% and demonstrated a median duration of response (DOR), a key secondary endpoint, of 8.25 months. The safety profile of Elahere was consistent
with findings from previous studies, and no new safety concerns were identified. Full data from the PICCOLO study will be presented at a future medical meeting.
 
AbbVie announced the start of the Phase 3 CERVINO clinical trial which will evaluate the efficacy, safety, and tolerability of ABBV-383 monotherapy compared
with standard available therapies (SATs) in patients with r/r multiple myeloma (MM) who have received at least two lines of prior therapy. The start of the CERVINO
trial marks an important step forward in AbbVie's continued commitment to advance new oncology treatments and elevate the standard of care for blood cancer


patients.
At the American Society of Clinical Oncology (ASCO) Annual Meeting, AbbVie showcased its solid tumor pipeline with new data from its innovative antibody-drug
conjugate (ADC) platform. Highlights included new safety and efficacy data from a Phase 1 study of ABBV-400, a next-generation, potential best-in-class c-Met
directed ADC, in patients with metastatic colorectal cancer (CRC); data from a first-in-human study of ABBV-706, a potential best-in-class SEZ6 directed ADC, in
small cell lung cancer (SCLC), high-grade central nervous system (CNS) tumors and high-grade neuroendocrine neoplasms (NENs); data from the primary analysis
of the Phase 2 LUMINOSITY trial evaluating Telisotuzumab vedotin (Teliso-V), a potential first-in-class c-Met directed ADC, in advanced non-small cell lung
cancer (NSCLC); and data from the Phase 3 MIRASOL trial of Elahere in patients with platinum-resistant ovarian cancer (PROC) and high FRα expression.
AbbVie announced it received a Complete Response Letter (CRL) from the FDA for the New Drug Application (NDA) for ABBV-951 (foscarbidopa/foslevodopa)
for the treatment of motor fluctuations in adults with advanced Parkinson's disease (PD). In its letter, the FDA cited observations that were identified during
inspection of a third-party manufacturer listed in the NDA. The CRL did not identify any issues related to the safety, efficacy or labeling of ABBV-951, including the
device, and does not request that AbbVie conduct additional efficacy or safety trials related to the drug or device-related testing. AbbVie continues to work with the
FDA to bring ABBV-951 to patients in the U.S. as quickly as possible.
AbbVie and Gilgamesh Pharmaceuticals announced a collaboration and option-to-license agreement to develop next-generation therapies for psychiatric disorders.
These next-generation therapies known as neuroplastogens target mechanisms that have shown potential to provide significant clinical benefits and are designed to
minimize the challenging effects seen with first-generation compounds. This collaboration will leverage AbbVie's expertise in psychiatry and Gilgamesh's innovative
research platform to discover novel neuroplastogens.
Full-Year 2024 Outlook
AbbVie is raising its adjusted diluted EPS guidance for the full year 2024 from $10.61 - $10.81 to $10.71 - $10.91, which includes an unfavorable impact of $0.60 per
share related to acquired IPR&D and milestones expense incurred year-to-date through the second quarter 2024. The company's 2024 adjusted diluted EPS guidance
excludes any impact from acquired IPR&D and milestones that may be incurred beyond the second quarter of 2024, as both cannot be reliably forecasted.
About AbbVie
AbbVie's mission is to discover and deliver innovative medicines that solve serious health issues today and address the medical challenges of tomorrow. We strive to have a
remarkable impact on people's lives across several key therapeutic areas: immunology, oncology, neuroscience and eye care - and products and services across our Allergan

Conference Call
AbbVie will host an investor conference call today at 8:00 a.m. Central Time to discuss our second-quarter performance. The call will be webcast through AbbVie's
Investor Relations website at investors.abbvie.com. An archived edition of the call will be available after 11:00 a.m. Central Time.
Non-GAAP Financial Results
Financial results for 2024 and 2023 are presented on both a reported and a non-GAAP basis. Reported results were prepared in accordance with GAAP and include all
revenue and expenses recognized during the period. Non-GAAP results adjust for certain non-cash items and for factors that are unusual or unpredictable, and exclude
those costs, expenses, and other specified items presented in the reconciliation tables later in this release. AbbVie's management believes non-GAAP financial measures
provide useful information to investors regarding AbbVie's results of operations and assist management, analysts, and investors in evaluating the performance of the


business. Non-GAAP financial measures should be considered in addition to, and not as a substitute for, measures of financial performance prepared in accordance with
GAAP.
