Riliprubart one-year results from phase 2 study underpin the potential as a first-in-class 
treatment in chronic inflammatory demyelinating polyneuropathy 
• 
First phase 2 study to evaluate three separate participant cohorts, including those who 
had failed or had an inadequate response to standard-of-care (SOC) treatment and 
those who had not received treatment 
• 
Riliprubart showed efficacy and safety across all enrolled cohorts, and a rapid and 
durable reduction of key biomarkers, including those associated with the classical 
complement pathway and nerve damage

Two global CIDP phase 3 studies started recruiting  
  
Paris, June 25, 2024. Sanofi’s complement C1s inhibitor, riliprubart, showed encouraging 
efficacy and safety for participants with chronic inflammatory demyelinating polyneuropathy 
(CIDP) in the latest interim analysis from an ongoing phase 2 study. In part A results at 24 
weeks, riliprubart showed promising disease-controlling benefits, with improvement or 
stabledisease in participants who switched from SOC to riliprubart, and improvement for 
participants who experienced failure or inadequate response to SOC treatment. In part B, 
riliprubart continued to show promising sustained benefit up to 48 weeks across all enrolled 
cohorts. Additional results showed that riliprubart improved participant-reported fatigue and 
quality-of-life measurements as well as biomarkers associated with CIDP disease progression. 
These data were presented at the 2024 Peripheral Nerve Society (PNS) Annual Meeting in 
Montreal, Canada.

all, demonstrating a significant unmet need for this community. These phase 2 data for 
riliprubart are encouraging, as they suggest that riliprubart’s unique mechanism of action 
reduces the overactive, damaging complement pathways that may drive disease progression.” 
Erik Wallström, MD, PhD 
Global Head of Neurology Development, Sanofi 
“CIDP is a debilitating disease, often with challenging comorbidities, and nearly a third of 
patients experience failure to or do not adequately respond to available therapies. Our 
riliprubart CIDP study is the only evaluating a broad spectrum of participants, including those 
who experienced failure of standard-of-care therapy, as well as the first study to investigate 
neurofilament light chain levels as a key biomarker of CIDP progression. These results bring us 
hope that riliprubart may reduce disability and underlying nerve damage, further validating our 
ongoing CIDP phase 3 studies.” 
In the phase 2 study, participants with CIDP were divided into three cohorts: participants living 
with CIDP receiving and dependent on the current SoC treatment (SOC-treated), participants 
living with CIDP who experienced an inadequate response or failure to respond to at least one 
line of treatment (SOC-refractory) and participants who had not received a SOC treatment in 
the previous 6 months (SOC-naïve). Participants were initially treated with riliprubart for 24 
weeks (part A), followed by an optional treatment extension for an additional year of 
treatment (part B). 
Results from part A and B showed: 
• 
For SOC-treated participants, 87% (42/48) improved or remained stable after switching 
from their previous SOC treatment to riliprubart after 24 weeks, including 52% (25/48) 
who experienced improvement above and beyond their previous therapy.  At least 72% 
(29/40) remained relapse-free after approximately one year of riliprubart treatment. 
• 
For SOC-refractory participants, 89% (16/18) improved or remained stable with 
riliprubart after 24 weeks, with 50% (9/18) showing improvement. 89% (8/9) 
sustained their response after approximately one year of riliprubart treatment. 
• 
For SOC-naïve participants, 92% (11/12) improved or remained stable with riliprubart 
after 24 weeks, and at least 71% (5/7) sustained their response after approximately 
one year of riliprubart treatment. 
• 
Riliprubart improved participant-reported fatigue and quality-of-life outcomes across all 
cohorts up to 48 weeks of treatment. The outcomes included reductions in the Rasch-
built Fatigue Severity Scale and improvements in the EuroQoL Visual Analogue Scale, a 
health-related quality of life assessment. 
• 
Riliprubart also reduced neurofilament light chain (NfL) levels by 35% across all three 
cohorts up to 48 weeks of treatment, indicating that riliprubart may reduce disease 
activity and the underlying nerve damage.

Internal 
Riliprubart had a manageable safety profile throughout the study. Treatment-emergent 
adverse events (TEAEs) occurred in 64.6% (31/48) and 88.9% (16/18) of SOC-treated and 
SOC-refractory participants, respectively. Two deaths were reported in participants with 
significant medical comorbidities aside from CIDP. The most common adverse events across all 
cohorts (≥12%) were headache, nasopharyngitis, and COVID-19. 
Sanofi has initiated two global phase 3 studies evaluating the safety and efficacy of riliprubart 
in adults with CIDP who experienced failure or had an inadequate response to a SOC treatment 
(MOBILIZE, NCT06290128) and in adults with CIDP receiving maintenance treatment with 
intravenous immunoglobulin (VITALIZE, NCT06290141). 
CIDP is a rare neurological condition that causes progressive weakness and sensory 
impairment in the arms and legs. CIDP occurs when the body’s immune system attacks the 
myelin sheaths around nerve cells in the peripheral nervous system. Timely diagnosis and 
treatment of CIDP is important because it allows for appropriate treatment, which is essential 
to preventing long-term disability. However, despite available therapies, many individuals are 
left with residual symptoms, including weakness, numbness, and fatigue that can lead to long-
term morbidity and diminished quality-of-life. Approximately 30% of people with CIDP do not 
respond to standard therapies. In people with CIDP who do respond, about 70% of the 
response is considered incomplete. Less than one-third of participants with CIDP remain in 
remission without continued therapy. 
About the phase 2 study 
The phase 2 study is a global, multicenter, open-label study evaluating riliprubart in 
participants with chronic inflammatory demyelinating polyneuropathy (CIDP) across three 
cohorts: participants who are receiving and dependent on a SOC treatment  (SOC-treated), 
participants who experienced failure or had an inadequate response to a SOC treatment (SOC-
refractory) and participants who had not received a SOC treatment in the previous 6 months 
(SOC-naïve). Participants undergo 24 weeks of treatment (part A), followed by an optional 
treatment extension for 52 weeks (part B). In part A, the primary endpoint for the SOC-
treated group is the percentage of participants who relapse after withdrawal of SOC and during 
the riliprubart treatment period. For the SOC-refractory and SOC-naïve groups, the part A 
primary endpoint is the percentage of participants responding during the riliprubart treatment 
period. In part B, the primary endpoint across all groups is the long-term safety and 
tolerability of riliprubart. Secondary endpoints include additional efficacy, safety, and 
tolerability measures. SOC treatment is immunoglobulins or corticosteroids.

Tolebrutinib meets primary endpoint in HERCULES phase 
3 study, the first and only to show reduction in disability 
accumulation in non-relapsing secondary progressive 
multiple sclerosis  
 
• 
In the HERCULES study, tolebrutinib met the primary endpoint in delaying time to onset 
of confirmed disability progression in people with nrSPMS, a population for which there 
are currently no approved therapies and significant unmet medical need 
• 
The GEMINI 1 and 2 studies evaluating tolebrutinib in people with relapsing MS (RMS) 
did not show significance in the primary endpoint of reducing annualized relapse rate 
over Aubagio (teriflunomide). Analysis of the key secondary endpoint of pooled 6-
month confirmed disability worsening (CDW) data showed a considerable delay in time 
to onset 
• 
Phase 3 study results will form the basis for future discussions with global regulatory 
authorities 
• 
Study results will be presented at the ECTRIMS medical meeting, September 20 
 
Paris, September 2, 2024. Positive results from the HERCULES phase 3 study showed that 
tolebrutinib, Sanofi’s oral brain-penetrant BTK inhibitor, met the primary endpoint of 
improvement over placebo in delaying time to onset of confirmed disability progression (CDP) 
in people with non-relapsing secondary progressive MS (nrSPMS). In the HERCULES study, 
nrSPMS was defined at baseline as having a SPMS diagnosis with an expanded disability status 
scale (EDSS) score between 3.0 and 6.5, no clinical relapses for the previous 24 months and 
documented evidence of disability accumulation in the previous 12 months. Preliminary 
analysis of liver safety was consistent with previous tolebrutinib studies. 
 
Results from the GEMINI 1 and 2 phase 3 studies evaluating tolebrutinib did not meet the 
primary endpoint of reducing annualized relapse rate (ARR), compared to teriflunomide, in 
people with relapsing forms of multiple sclerosis. However, analysis of the key secondary 
endpoint of pooled 6-month CDW data showed a considerable delay in time to onset, which 
supports the CDP data observed in HERCULES. 
 
Houman Ashrafian, MD, PhD 
Head of Research & Development, Sanofi 
“Tolebrutinib represents an unprecedented breakthrough as a potential first-in-disease treatment 
option with clinically meaningful benefit in disability accumulation. Addressing disability 
accumulation, thought to be driven by smoldering neuroinflammation, remains the greatest unmet 
medical need in people with non-relapsing secondary progressive MS today.” 
 
The PERSEUS phase 3 study in primary progressive MS, evaluating time to onset of CDP, is 
currently ongoing with study results anticipated in 2025. 
 
Study results for HERCULES and GEMINI 1 and 2 will be presented at the upcoming European 
Committee for Treatment and Research in Multiple Sclerosis (ECTRIMS) medical meeting in 
Copenhagen, Denmark, September 20, 2024. Tolebrutinib is currently under clinical 
investigation, and its safety and efficacy have not been evaluated by any regulatory authority. 
 
Multiple sclerosis is a chronic, immune-mediated, neurodegenerative disease that results in 
accumulation of irreversible disabilities over time. The physical and cognitive disability 
impairments translate into gradual deterioration of health status and lower quality of life, 
impacting patients’ care and life expectancy. 


2/3 
 
 
Disability accumulation remains the significant unmet medical need in MS. To date, the 
primary target of current therapies has been peripheral B and T cells, while innate immunity, 
which is believed to drive disability accumulation, remains largely unaddressed by current 
therapies. Currently approved or medicines being tested for MS mainly target the adaptive 
immune system and/or do not act directly within the central nervous system (CNS) to drive 
clinical benefit. 
 
RMS refers to people with MS who experience episodes of new or worsening symptoms (known 
as relapses) followed by periods of partial or complete recovery. nrSPMS refers to people with 
MS who have stopped experiencing confirmed relapses but continue to experience 
accumulation of disability, experienced as symptoms such as fatigue, cognition impairment, 
balance and gait impairment, loss of bowel and/or bladder function, sexual disfunction, 
amongst others.  
 
Tolebrutinib's mechanism of action modulates both B lymphocytes and activated microglia in 
the CNS, which is understood to address the underlying mechanisms of disability accumulation 
in MS linked to smoldering neuroinflammation in the brain and spinal cord. 
 
About GEMINI 1 & 2 
GEMINI 1 (clinical study identifier: NCT04410978) and GEMINI 2 (NCT04410991) were 
randomized, double-blind phase 3 clinical studies evaluating the efficacy and safety of 
tolebrutinib compared to teriflunomide in participants with relapsing forms of MS. Participants 
were randomized in both studies (1:1) to receive either tolebrutinib and placebo daily or 14mg 
teriflunomide and placebo. 
 
The primary endpoint for both studies was the annualized relapse rate for up to approximately 
36 months defined as the number of confirmed adjudicated protocol defined relapses. 
Secondary endpoints included time to onset of confirmed disability worsening (CDW), 
confirmed over at least 6 months, defined as an increase of ≥1.5 points from the baseline 
expanded disability status scale (EDSS) score when the baseline score is 0, an increase of 
≥1.0 point from the baseline EDSS score when the baseline score is 0.5 to ≤5.5 or an increase 
of ≥0.5 point from the baseline EDSS score when the baseline score was >5.5 in addition to 
the total number of new and/or enlarging T2 hyperintense lesions as detected by MRI from 
baseline through the end of study, the total number of Gd-enhancing T1 hyperintense lesions 
as detected by MRI from baseline through the end of study and the safety and tolerability of 
tolebrutinib. 
 
About HERCULES 
HERCULES (NCT04411641) was a randomized, double-blind phase 3 clinical study evaluating 
the efficacy and safety of tolebrutinib in participants with non-relapsing secondary progressive 
MS compared to placebo. nrSPMS was defined at baseline as having a SPMS diagnosis with an 
EDSS between 3.0 and 6.5, no clinical relapses for the previous 24 months and documented 
evidence of disability accumulation in the previous 12 months. Participants were randomized (1:1) 
to receive either an oral daily dose of tolebrutinib or matching placebo for up to approximately 
48 months. 
 
The primary endpoint was 6-month CDP defined as the increase of ≥1.0 point from the 
baseline EDSS score when the baseline score is ≤5.0, or the increase of ≥0.5 point when the 
baseline EDSS score was >5.0. Secondary endpoints included 3-month change in 9 hole peg 
test and T25-FW test, time to onset of 3-month CDP as assessed by EDSS score, total number 
of new or enlarging T2 hyperintense lesions as detected by MRI, change in cognitive function 
at the EOS compared to baseline as assessed by the Symbol Digit Modalities Test and by the 
California Verbal Learning Test as well as the safety and tolerability of tolebrutinib. 
 
About tolebrutinib 
Tolebrutinib is an investigational, oral, brain-penetrant, and bioactive Bruton’s tyrosine kinase 
(BTK) inhibitor that achieves CSF concentrations predicted to modulate B lymphocytes and

Sarclisa induction treatment demonstrated significantly 
improved progression-free survival in patients with newly 
diagnosed multiple myeloma eligible for transplant 
 
• 
Sarclisa (isatuximab) in combination with standard-of-care lenalidomide, bortezomib, 
and dexamethasone (RVd) during 18-week induction treatment followed by transplant 
resulted in a statistically significant and clinically meaningful improvement in 
progression-free survival compared to RVd induction therapy, regardless of 
maintenance therapy assignment, in the investigational use for transplant-eligible newly 
diagnosed multiple myeloma (NDMM) 
• 
GMMG-HD7 is one of six phase 3 studies to report positive results for Sarclisa in 
multiple myeloma (MM), which includes four positive readouts of a Sarclisa-based 
quadruplet in the frontline setting 
• 
Results reinforce the potential of Sarclisa as a backbone therapy when added to the 
current standard-of-care in various MM patient populations 
 
Paris, August 8, 2024. New results from the two-part, double-randomized, German-speaking 
Myeloma Multicenter Group (GMMG)-HD7 phase 3 study show that Sarclisa (isatuximab) in 
combination with lenalidomide, bortezomib, and dexamethasone (RVd) during induction therapy 
in transplant-eligible, newly diagnosed multiple myeloma (NDMM) significantly prolonged 
progression-free survival (PFS) from first randomization, resulting in a statistically significant 
and clinically meaningful reduction in disease progression or death, compared to RVd induction 
regardless of the maintenance regimen. Full results will be submitted for presentation at a 
forthcoming medical meeting. 
 
Hartmut Goldschmidt, MD 
President of GMMG, Professor of Medicine at the Heidelberg University Hospital (UKHD), 
Germany and principal investigator of the study 
“Successful induction therapy is one of the most critical components to reduce the relapse or 
recurrence risk in patients with newly diagnosed multiple myeloma. While we observed this 
investigational combination showed improved minimal residual disease negativity rates in the 
bone marrow, indicating potentially deeper responses after induction, further follow-up was 
needed to better understand how this translated to long-term outcomes. These data provide 
evidence that the Isa-RVd regimen potentially improves progression-free survival in the frontline, 
transplant-eligible population and supports the potential of this quadruplet to become a new 
standard-of-care induction regimen in this treatment setting.”  
 
GMMG-HD7 is one of six phase 3 studies to report positive results for Sarclisa in patients with 
multiple myeloma, which includes four positive readouts of a Sarclisa-based quadruplet in the 
frontline setting. The most recent included results from the IMROZ phase 3 study evaluating the 
investigational use of Sarclisa with VRd versus VRd for patients with transplant-ineligible NDMM, 
demonstrating a statistically significant and clinically meaningful improvement in PFS and a 
higher proportion of patients with minimal residual disease (MRD) negativity. 
 
Dietmar Berger, MD, PhD  
Chief Medical Officer and Global Head of Development at Sanofi 
“The GMMG-HD7 study was designed to better understand the distinct effect of targeting CD38 
with Sarclisa in induction versus maintenance treatment of transplant-eligible patients. These 
data build upon our belief that Sarclisa has the potential to be a best-in-class CD38 therapy that 
could improve long-term outcomes versus the standard-of-care for certain patients. We look 
forward to the full data presentation and continuing our mission of helping make a meaningful 
difference for people living with multiple myeloma.” 
 


2/4 
 
 
 
In December 2021, Sanofi and GMMG shared the results from part one, which met the primary 
endpoint of MRD negativity after induction therapy and before transplant in NDMM patients. The 
GMMG-initiated study is being conducted in close collaboration with Sanofi based on jointly 
defined research. Sanofi provided financial support to GMMG for this study. The use of Sarclisa 
in combination with RVd is investigational and has not been evaluated by any regulatory 
authority. 
 
While considered a rare disease, MM is the second most common hematologic malignancy,1 with 
more than 180,000 new diagnoses of MM worldwide yearly.2 Despite available treatments, MM 
remains an incurable malignancy in most patients with an estimated 61% five-year survival rate 
for newly diagnosed patients.3 Since MM does not have a cure, most patients will relapse. 
Relapsed MM is the term for when the cancer returns after treatment or a period of remission. 
Refractory MM refers to when the cancer does not respond or no longer responds to therapy. 
 
About the GMMG-HD7 study 
GMMG-HD7 is a pivotal randomized, open-label, multicenter, 2-part phase 3 study evaluating 
Sarclisa in combination with RVd versus RVd induction followed by post-transplant re-
randomization to Sarclisa plus lenalidomide versus lenalidomide maintenance in transplant-
eligible NDMM patients. The study enrolled 662 patients with transplant-eligible NDMM across 
67 sites in Germany. In the first part of the study, all participants were equally randomized to 
receive three 42-day cycles of RVd in both arms of the study, while Sarclisa was added to only 
one study arm. In the second part of the study, patients were re-randomized post-transplant to 
receive Sarclisa plus lenalidomide or lenalidomide alone as maintenance therapy. During the 
study, Sarclisa was administered through an intravenous infusion at a dose of 10 mg/kg once 
weekly for the first four weeks of cycle one, then every other week for the rest of the induction 
period. 
 
MRD negativity was assessed by next-generation flow cytometry (sensitivity of 1x10-5) after 
induction. In the latest readout of the study, PFS for both Sarclisa plus RVd as an induction 
therapy, regardless of maintenance treatment, and Sarclisa plus lenalidomide as a maintenance 
regimen were measured from first randomization. 
 
GMMG-HD7 protocol defined the primary endpoints of MRD negativity after induction treatment 
for the first part of the study, and PFS following the second randomization after transplant for 
part two of the study, in which Sarclisa was added to lenalidomide maintenance, with the latter 
primary endpoint anticipated to be available at a later date. The key secondary endpoint for the 
first part of the study was PFS from first randomization. Additional secondary endpoints included 
rates of complete response after induction, and intensification, overall survival, and safety. 
 
About Sarclisa 
Sarclisa (isatuximab) is a monoclonal antibody that binds to a specific epitope on the CD38 
receptor on MM cells, inducing distinct antitumor activity. It is designed to work through multiple 
mechanisms 
of 
action 
including 
programmed 
tumor 
cell 
death 
(apoptosis) 
and 
immunomodulatory activity. CD38 is highly and uniformly expressed on the surface of MM cells, 
making it a target for antibody-based therapeutics such as Sarclisa. 
 
Based on the ICARIA-MM phase 3 study, Sarclisa is approved in more than 50 countries, 
including the US and the EU, in combination with pomalidomide and dexamethasone for the 
treatment of patients with relapsed refractory MM (RRMM) who have received ≥2 prior therapies, 
including lenalidomide and a proteasome inhibitor and who progressed on last therapy. Based 
on the IKEMA phase 3 study, Sarclisa is also approved in 50 countries in combination with 
carfilzomib and dexamethasone, including in the US for the treatment of patients with RRMM 
who have received 1–3 prior lines of therapy and in the EU for patients with MM who have 
received at least one prior therapy. In the US, the non-proprietary name for Sarclisa is 
isatuximab-irfc, with irfc as the suffix designated in accordance with nonproprietary naming of 
biological products guidance for industry issued by the US Food and Drug Administration. 
 
Sarclisa continues to be evaluated in multiple ongoing phase 3 clinical studies in combination 
with current standard treatments across the MM treatment continuum. It is also under 


3/4 
 
 
 
investigation for the treatment of other hematologic malignancies, and its safety and efficacy 
have not been evaluated by any regulatory authority outside of its approved indication. 
 
Sanofi is committed to pursuing the advancement of Sarclisa through several investigational 
studies across the MM treatment continuum. Various patient-centric clinical development 
programs aim to bring Sarclisa to more patients, intercept the disease earlier in the treatment 
journey, and explore potential new combinations including assessing subcutaneous 
administration via a proprietary on body device system. The safety and efficacy of Sarclisa has 
not been evaluated by any regulatory authority outside of its approved indications and methods 
of delivery. 
 
In striving to become the number one immunoscience company globally, there is a commitment 
to advancing oncology innovation. The pipeline is being reshaped and prioritized, leveraging 
expertise in immunoscience to drive progress. Efforts are centered on select hematologic 
malignancies and solid tumors with critical unmet needs, including multiple myeloma, acute 
myeloid leukemia, certain types of lymphomas, as well as gastrointestinal and lung cancers.

Media Update 
 
 
Frexalimab new phase 2 data showed reduction of key 
biomarker of nerve cell damage in relapsing MS  
 
* 
Frexalimab high-dose arm observed a 41% reduction in plasma neurofilament light 
chain (NfL) levels, a biomarker of nerve cell damage, after 48 weeks of treatment 
* 
Data support potential as a first-in-class, high-efficacy, and disease-modifying treatment 
for people with relapsing MS 
* 
Phase 3 studies of frexalimab in relapsing MS and non-relapsing secondary progressive 
MS (nrSPMS) are underway 
 
Paris, June 28, 2024. Sanofi’s CD40L monoclonal antibody, frexalimab, reduced a key 
biomarker associated with multiple sclerosis nerve cell damage in patients with relapsing MS, 
supporting the rationale for this novel mechanism in MS phase 3 studies aiming to delay disability 
progression. New phase 2 results showed significant reduction in plasma levels of neurofilament 
light chain (NfL) after one year of treatment, a biomarker of nerve cell damage that is typically 
elevated in people living with MS. These data were presented at the 10th Congress of the 
European Academy of Neurology (EAN) in Helsinki, Finland. 
 
Patrick Vermersch, MD, PhD 
University of Lille, CHU Lille, France 
“As our science and diagnostic tools have evolved, so has our understanding of multiple sclerosis. 
We now know that NfL levels may be related to both acute inflammatory damage and chronic 
diffuse neuronal loss leading to disability progression, strengthening its position as a key biomarker 
of nerve cell damage in people with multiple sclerosis. These data presented at EAN suggest that 
CD40L inhibition may reduce nerve cell damage in people with multiple sclerosis and reinforce the 
potential of frexalimab to slow or halt disease progression for people living with this disease.” 
 
Erik Wallström, MD, PhD 
Global Head of Neurology Development, Sanofi 
“People with multiple sclerosis need new high-efficacy treatment options that target disability 
progression, which remains an unmet need. These results, alongside the previously reported 
phase 2 efficacy and safety results, further show that frexalimab’s novel mechanism of action has 
the potential to deliver meaningful improvements for people living with this chronic and 
debilitating disease.”  
 
Ninety-seven percent (125/129) of the study participants from the initial 12-week double-blind 
period entered the open-label extension (OLE) of the phase 2 study, and 87% (112/129) 
remained in the study by the 48-week cut-off. During the OLE, treatment groups consisted of 
participants with relapsing MS receiving either high-dose frexalimab regimens (frexalimab-high), 
low-dose frexalimab regimens (frexalimab-low), or placebo-matched groups that switched to 
matching high or low doses of frexalimab at week 12 (placebo-low/frexalimab-low and placebo-
high/frexalimab-high). Plasma NfL samples were collected and analyzed from all four groups at 
baseline, week 12, week 24, and week 48. 
 
NfL biomarker results from the phase 2 study showed: 
• 
Plasma NfL levels (geometric mean pg/ml [SD]) were similar across all study groups at 
baseline and were reduced across all four treatment groups by week 48. 
• 
Participants receiving high-dose frexalimab experienced a 41% reduction in plasma NfL 
levels from baseline (11.5 [1.9]) to week 48 (6.8 [2.0]), the greatest NfL level reduction 
across the four treatment groups.  
• 
Participants receiving low-dose frexalimab experienced a 35% reduction in plasma NfL 
levels from baseline (12.4 [1.9]) to week 48 (8.1 [1.7]). 


2/3 
 
• 
Participants in the placebo-high group who switched to high-dose frexalimab at week 12 
experienced a 24% reduction in plasma NfL levels from baseline (12.6 [2.1]) to week 48 
(9.6 [1.7]) and by 39% from week 12 when switched from placebo to high-dose 
frexalimab. 
• 
Participants in the placebo-low group who switched to low-dose frexalimab at week 12 
experienced a 33% reduction in plasma NfL levels from baseline (11.8 [1.9]) to week 48 
(7.8 [2.1]) and by 39% from week 12 when switched from placebo to low-dose 
frexalimab. 
 
In February 2024, 12-week double-blind study period results were published in The New England 
Journal of Medicine, and at AAN in April 2024, 48-week open-label extension efficacy and safety 
data were featured in an oral presentation. 
 
Sanofi has initiated global phase 3 studies of frexalimab in relapsing MS (NCT06141473) and 
non-relapsing secondary progressive MS (NCT06141486), which have begun enrolling 
participants. 
 
About the phase 2 study 
The phase 2 study was a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study evaluating 
frexalimab in participants with relapsing MS. Participants were randomized (4:4:1:1) to receive 
either high dose (frexalimab 1200 mg intravenously every four weeks, with an initial 1800 mg 
loading dose) or low dose (frexalimab 300 mg subcutaneously every two weeks, with an initial 
600 mg loading dose) frexalimab or matching placebo for 12 weeks (part A). The primary 
endpoint was the reduction in the number of new Gd+ T1 MRI brain lesions at week 12. 
Secondary endpoints included additional MRI-based efficacy measures as well as the safety, 
tolerability, and pharmacokinetics of frexalimab. After week 12, participants receiving placebo 
switched to respective frexalimab arms and entered the open-label part B, which is currently 
ongoing. 
 
About frexalimab 
Frexalimab (SAR441344) is a potentially first-in-class second-generation CD40L antibody that 
blocks the costimulatory CD40/CD40L pathway which is important for activation and function of 
adaptive (T and B cells) and innate (macrophages/microglia and dendritic cells) immunity. 
Through this unique upstream mechanism of action, frexalimab has the potential to address both 
acute and chronic neuroinflammation in MS, without causing lymphocyte depletion. Frexalimab 
has significant indications under development, such as phase 2 studies in systemic lupus 
erythematosus and Type 1 diabetes, and its safety and efficacy have not been reviewed by any 
regulatory authority. Sanofi is developing frexalimab under an exclusive license from ImmuNext 
Inc. For more information on frexalimab clinical studies, please visit www.ClinicalTrials.gov.

ISTH: Sanofi advances leadership in hemophilia with new 
data for ALTUVIIIO and fitusiran  
 
• 
Seven oral presentations across the hemophilia portfolio reinforce Sanofi’s commitment 
to bring potential first- and best-in-class treatments to the rare blood disorders 
community 
• 
Interim results from the long-term XTEND-ed phase 3 study demonstrate once-weekly 
ALTUVIIIO continues to provide highly effective bleed protection 
• 
New ATLAS phase 3 study data reinforce the potential of fitusiran to provide prophylaxis 
for people with hemophilia A or B, with or without inhibitors 
• 
New Drug Application for fitusiran accepted for review by the US Food and Drug 
Administration, with a PDUFA date of March 28, 2025 
 
Paris, June 21, 2024. Sanofi will present new data from its hemophilia portfolio at the 32nd 
Congress of the International Society on Thrombosis and Haemostasis (ISTH), taking place June 
22-26, 2024, in Bangkok, Thailand. Notable presentations on ALTUVIIIO [Antihemophilic Factor 
(Recombinant), Fc-VWF-XTEN Fusion Protein] include long-term interim phase 3 data on the 
efficacy and safety of the treatment in adults and children with severe hemophilia A. Abstracts 
on fitusiran include information on surgical experience as well as long-term safety data from the 
ATLAS phase 3 clinical development program in adults and adolescents with hemophilia A or B, 
regardless of inhibitor status. 
 
Dietmar Berger 
Chief Medical Officer, Global Head of Development  
“Our presence at this year’s congress demonstrates our continued commitment to delivering 
innovative first- and best-in-class solutions to the hemophilia community. Hemophilia is a 
lifelong condition that significantly impacts people living with the disease—from risk of bleeds 
and poor joint health to increased risks during surgery. These data reinforce why it’s critical to 
have treatment options, like ALTUVIIIO and fitusiran, that deliver effective outcomes in multiple 
scenarios and that can be used throughout a person’s life. We look forward to working in 
partnership with regulatory agencies to keep bringing novel options to those living with 
hemophilia.” 
 
ALTUVIIIO 
Interim analyses of XTEND-ed, a long-term extension phase 3 study, showed that in adult and 
pediatric populations, the use of ALTUVIIIO continued to provide highly effective bleed 
prevention leading to improvement or maintenance of joint health over a two-year period, and 
a safety profile consistent with that reported in the initial studies. The following abstracts will be 
presented at the meeting: 
• 
“First Interim Analysis of Clinical Outcomes in Adults and Adolescents With 
Severe Hemophilia A Receiving Efanesoctocog Alfa Prophylaxis in XTEND-ed, a 
Phase 3 Long-term Extension Study”: In previously treated patients (≥12 years old) 
who had the completed the XTEND-1 (Arm A/B) trial, the mean annualized bleed rate 
(ABR) with ALTUVIIIO was 0.72 (standard deviation [SD])=1.26) for arm A and 0.42 
(SD=0.89) for arm B. No factor VIII inhibitors were detected (abstract OC50.1). 
• 
“Interim Analysis of Joint Outcomes in Adult and Adolescent Patients with 
Severe Hemophilia A Receiving Efanesoctocog Alfa During the Phase 3 XTEND-
ed Long-Term Extension Study”: In patients who continued to receive once weekly 
ALTUVIIIO (50 IU/kg) in XTEND-ed, joint health had improved or been maintained in 
adults and adolescents over a two-year period, as measured by Hemophilia Joint Health 
Score total score, total joint score, and subdomain scores (abstract OC01.4). 
• 
“Long-term Outcomes With Efanesoctocog Alfa Prophylaxis for Previously 


2/4 
 
Treated Children With Severe Hemophilia A, an Interim Analysis of the Phase 3 
XTEND-ed Study": No factor VIII inhibitors were detected. The mean ABR was 0.70 
(SD=1.27), a rate similar to the mean ABR observed in XTEND-Kids (abstract OC50.2). 
 
Additional data being presented at ISTH show that across clinical studies, ALTUVIIIO 
demonstrated effective bleed protection when used for perioperative management in participants 
with severe hemophilia A: 
• 
“Perioperative Management with Efanesoctocog Alfa in Adults, Adolescents, and 
Children with Severe Hemophilia A in the Phase 3 XTEND Clinical Program”: In 
41 patients from the XTEND-1, XTEND-Kids, and XTEND-ed studies who underwent 49 
major surgeries, hemostasis was maintained in all surgeries and hemostatic response 
with ALTUVIIIO was rated as excellent in most surgeries (43/49) (abstract OC14.1). 
 
Fitusiran 
Additional analyses will be presented at ISTH that support the potential of fitusiran as a first-in-
class treatment offering consistent bleed protection for patients with hemophilia A or B, 
regardless of inhibitor status. 
  
Novel results on the perioperative management of hemophilia using fitusiran prophylaxis in the 
ATLAS clinical development program demonstrated that major surgeries can be safely performed 
in patients on fitusiran:  
• 
“Surgical experience in people with hemophilia A or B with and without 
inhibitors receiving fitusiran”: 60 major surgeries, including 24 in people with 
hemophilia with inhibitors, were conducted in the fitusiran clinical development program 
at the time of this analysis. Major surgeries were safely and effectively conducted with 
fitusiran prophylaxis following bleed management guidelines, irrespective of the patient’s 
inhibitor status (abstract OC14.2). 
 
Additional data presented at ISTH support the favorable safety profile for fitusiran and 
demonstrate that fitusiran prophylaxis under an antithrombin-based dosing regimen (AT-DR) 
successfully mitigated the risk of thrombotic events (TEs) and reduced the incidence of elevated 
liver enzymes and gallbladder inflammation or gallstones.  
 
The following abstracts will be presented at ISTH: 
• 
“Incidence of thrombotic events in the fitusiran clinical development program”: 
Fitusiran prophylaxis under an AT-DR led to a marked reduction in TEs with substantially 
greater exposure on the AT-DR (abstract OC40.2).  
• 
“Hepatobiliary events in the fitusiran clinical development program with the 
revised AT-based dose regimen”: Fitusiran prophylaxis under an AT-DR led to 
reductions in liver transaminase elevations and cholecystitis/cholelithiasis events. Liver 
transaminase 
elevations 
were 
infrequent 
and 
transient, 
and 
events 
of 
cholecystitis/cholelithiasis resolved without clinical complications with no fitusiran dose 
interruptions or discontinuations (abstract OC40.3). 
 
These presentations reinforce pivotal data that were presented earlier this year from the phase 
3 open-label extension study (ATLAS-OLE) of fitusiran prophylaxis showing that maintaining AT 
activity levels between 15-35% resulted in clinically meaningful bleed control and a substantially 
improved benefit risk profile in people with hemophilia A or B, with or without inhibitors. 
  
Regulatory submissions for fitusiran for the treatment of hemophilia A or B in adults and 
adolescents with or without inhibitors have been completed in China, Brazil and the US with a 
US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) target action date of March 28, 2025. The FDA also 
granted fitusiran Breakthrough Therapy Designation for hemophilia B with inhibitors in December 
2023. 
 
About ALTUVIIIO 


3/4 
 
ALTUVIIIO [Antihemophilic Factor (Recombinant), Fc-VWF-XTEN Fusion Protein] is a first-in-
class high-sustained factor VIII therapy that is designed to extend protection from bleeds with 
once-weekly prophylactic dosing for adults and children with hemophilia A. In adults and 
adolescents, ALTUVIIIO has a 3- to 4-fold longer half-life relative to standard and extended half-
life factor VIII products, providing high-sustained factor activity levels within normal to near-
normal range, allowing for once-weekly administration. ALTUVIIIO is the first factor VIII therapy 
that has been shown to break through the von Willebrand factor ceiling, which imposes a half-
life limitation on other factor VIII therapies. ALTUVIIIO builds on the innovative Fc fusion 
technology by adding a region of von Willebrand factor and XTEN polypeptides to extend its time 
in circulation. 
 
ALTUVIIIO is currently approved and marketed in the US, Taiwan, and Japan. On June 17, 2024, 
it was approved by the European Commission for the treatment and prevention of bleeds and 
perioperative prophylaxis in hemophilia A under the name Altuvoct. 
 
ALTUVIIIO is the first factor VIII therapy to receive Breakthrough Therapy Designation by the 
FDA in May 2022, Fast Track Designation in February 2021, and Orphan Drug Designation in 
2017. The European Commission granted Orphan designation in June 2019. 
 
About the XTEND-ed study 
XTEND-ed (NCT04644575) is a phase 3 multicenter, open-label three-arm study of the long-
term efficacy and safety of once-weekly ALTUVIIIO (50 IU/kg) in previously treated patients 
with severe hemophilia A. The study enrolled participants with severe hemophilia A from previous 
phase 3 studies, including adult and adolescent patients (≥12 years old) who completed the 
XTEND-1 study (NCT04161495) and children (<12 years old) who completed the XTEND-Kids 
study (NCT04759131) (arm A), newly initiated patients (arm B, China only), and newly initiated 
patients with planned major surgery (arm C). Participants received ALTUVIIIO prophylaxis for a 
total of 100 exposure days, cumulative from the initial study (52 weeks) and this study.

About fitusiran 
Fitusiran is currently under clinical investigation, and its safety and efficacy have not been 
evaluated by any regulatory authority. Fitusiran is a potential first-in-class, antithrombin-
lowering therapy for the prophylactic treatment of people with hemophilia A or B, with or without 
inhibitors. It is an investigational small volume, subcutaneously administered small interference 
RNA (siRNA) therapeutic that aims to prevent bleeds and rebalance hemostasis by lowering 
antithrombin, a protein that inhibits blood clotting, to promote thrombin generation. Fitusiran 
utilizes Alnylam Pharmaceutical Inc.’s ESC-GalNAc conjugate technology, which enables 
subcutaneous dosing with increased potency and durability. Fitusiran has the potential to enable 
prophylaxis for people around the world living with hemophilia A or B with or without inhibitors 
by virtue of its low overall treatment burden, with as few as six small-volume subcutaneous 
injections per year that do not require refrigeration.  
 
About the ATLAS clinical development program 


4/4 
 
The efficacy and safety of fitusiran are being investigated in the ATLAS clinical development 
program. The program includes the completed phase 3 studies ATLAS-INH (NCT03417102), 
ATLAS-A/B (NCT03417245), or ATLAS-PPX (NCT03549871) and the ongoing ATLAS-OLE 
(NCT03754790) study, a single-arm, phase 3, open-label study evaluating the safety and 
efficacy of fitusiran with a revised AT-DR, which was designed to maintain an antithrombin target 
range of 15%-35%. This study includes lower doses and less-frequent dosing than earlier 
studies. ATLAS-NEO (NCT05662319) is an additional phase 3 study currently recruiting 
participants to assess the frequency of treated bleeding episodes with fitusiran under the AT-DR 
in male adult and adolescent (≥12 years old) participants with hemophilia A or B, with or without 
inhibitory antibodies to factor VIII or IX, who have switched from their prior standard-of-care 
treatment.
