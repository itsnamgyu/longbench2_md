# Question

Regarding the comparison between these two articles, which of the following is correct?

# Choices

- A: Both AndroidArena and B-moca have designed two types of tasks: single app tasks and multi app tasks. AndroidArena also includes tasks that restrict the use of a specific app.
- B: The testing method designed by B-moca is universal for text models, multimodal models, and video models, while Android Arena uses Deep-Q learning to train agents, which can be easily extended to multimodal models, although this article does not cover this aspect.
- C: AndroidArena's test standards focus on operation sequences, while B-moca focuses on execution results on the simulator. Specifically, the Task Reward of AndroidArena calculates the LCS between the standard answer and the model operation sequence, and adds them up weighted.
- D: Both AndroidArena and B-moca need to use real Android machines for testing.
