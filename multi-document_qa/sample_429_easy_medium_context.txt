IMF Executive Board Concludes 2024 Article IV Consultation 
with the People’s Republic of China 
FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE 
Washington, DC – August 2, 2024: The Executive Board of the International Monetary Fund 
(IMF) concluded the Article IV consultation1 with the People’s Republic of China on July 19, 
2024. 
China’s economy has remained resilient despite the continued weakness in the property 
sector, with GDP growing by 5.2 percent in 2023, and 5 percent y/y in the first half of 2024. 
Growth has been primarily driven by strong public investment and the post-COVID recovery in 
private consumption, with net exports also providing a boost more recently. However, inflation 
has been low in recent quarters amid continued economic slack.  
Looking ahead, growth is projected to be broadly in line with the government’s target in 2024, 
and inflation is expected to pick up gradually as the output gap closes and the impact of lower 
commodity prices wanes. Over the medium term, growth is projected to gradually decline to 
about 3.3 percent in 2029 amid headwinds from weak productivity and an aging population. 
Uncertainty surrounding the outlook is high. Deeper-than-expected contraction in the property 
sector, combined with high debt levels, could result in sustained disinflationary pressures and 
adverse macro-financial feedback loops. External risks include greater-than-expected 
weakening of external demand, and an escalation of fragmentation pressures. On the upside, 
decisive policy action to facilitate adjustment in the property sector or market-oriented 
structural reforms could boost confidence and lead to a better-than-expected economic 
outcomes.  
Executive Board Assessment2 
Executive Directors welcomed China’s resilient growth and the post-pandemic recovery in 
private consumption. Nonetheless, Directors emphasized downside risks from the ongoing 
adjustment in the property market and the drag from local government debt. In that context, 
they concurred that macroeconomic policies should support domestic demand in the short 
term. Directors also noted that a balanced policy approach and pro-market structural reforms 
would be necessary to foster high-quality, green growth in the medium term. 
Directors welcomed the authorities’ ongoing efforts to facilitate the property sector adjustment 
and boost homebuyers’ confidence. They generally underscored the need for a 
comprehensive policy package to facilitate a more efficient and less costly transition for the 
sector. In that respect, Directors called for the timely exit of nonviable property developers and 
greater house price flexibility. Most Directors also saw scope in the deployment of central 
 
1 Under Article IV of the IMF's Articles of Agreement, the IMF holds bilateral discussions with members, 
usually every year. A staff team visits the country, collects economic and financial information, and 
discusses with officials the country's economic developments and policies. On return to headquarters, 
the staff prepares a report, which forms the basis for discussion by the Executive Board. 
2 At the conclusion of the discussion, the Managing Director, as Chair of the Board, summarizes the 
views of Executive Directors, and this summary is transmitted to the country's authorities. An explanation 
of any qualifiers used in summing up can be found here:

government financing to protect homebuyers of unfinished housing, while some noted the 
associated fiscal costs and the moral hazard implications. 
Directors agreed that a neutral structural fiscal stance in 2024 would help restore consumer 
confidence and support domestic demand while mitigating downside risks. The positive effects 
would be stronger with a reorientation of expenditure away from investment and toward 
households through an expanded social protection system, including greater transfers to 
vulnerable segments, and a more progressive tax regime. A gradual decline in the structural 
fiscal deficit can begin in 2025, with a pace dependent on the strength of the recovery, 
inflation developments, and property market outlook. 
Directors emphasized that stabilizing public debt will require sustained fiscal consolidation in 
the longer term, achieved through a reduction of off-budget investment and wide-ranging tax 
and social security reforms. They highlighted the need for fiscal framework reforms, including 
improving monitoring of local government finances, reducing their structural 
expenditure-revenue gaps, and establishing subnational fiscal rules. Directors noted that 
reducing the debt stock of local government financing vehicles would require greater use of 
insolvency tools.  
Directors welcomed the People’s Bank of China’s monetary policy response and encouraged 
additional monetary easing via interest rates to boost domestic demand and further mitigate 
deflation risks. Greater exchange rate flexibility would also help absorb external shocks.  
Directors positively noted the significant changes to China’s financial regulatory and 
supervisory architecture to enhance risk mitigation. They observed that financial stability risks 
remain elevated and called for reducing asset quality risks by phasing out forbearance 
measures and strictly applying prudential policies. They underscored the importance of 
reforms to tackle legacy vulnerabilities in the financial system, including the need to devise a 
comprehensive strategy to strengthen small and medium banks, upgrade crisis management 
and bank resolution frameworks, and enhance systemic risk oversight. Continuing to 
strengthen the AML/CFT framework is also important. 
Directors emphasized the need for greener and more balanced growth. They underscored the 
importance of continued efforts to rebalance demand toward consumption together with 
reforms that boost the potential of the service sector as a growth driver, including by reducing 
regulatory barriers. Other key reform priorities include implementing SOE reforms, gradually 
increasing the retirement age, and strengthening labor market policies. Directors welcomed 
China’s decarbonization efforts and its success in deploying renewable energy. They urged 
accelerating power sector reforms, including reforms to the emission trading system.  
Directors positively noted that China is a key player in addressing global challenges and 
welcomed its constructive role in supporting sovereign debt restructuring in low-income and 
vulnerable countries and tackling the global climate crisis. They also emphasized China’s 
important role in strengthening the multilateral trading system in close collaboration with 
international partners. In that context, Directors generally agreed that scaling back China’s 
industrial policies, which should only be used in the presence of well-defined market failures, 
and improving transparency around government support could help reduce domestic resource 
misallocation, lessen fragmentation pressures, and mitigate international spillovers.  
Directors agreed that addressing remaining data gaps would help enhance data transparency 
and strengthen policy making.

PEOPLE’S REPUBLIC OF CHINA 
STAFF REPORT FOR THE 2024 ARTICLE IV CONSULTATION 
KEY ISSUES 
Context. After four decades of high growth and remarkable socioeconomic achievements, 
China’s growth has decelerated in recent years, reflecting the pandemic, a large but needed 
property market correction, and structural headwinds such as weakening productivity and 
labor force growth. The transition to lower growth is consistent with the authorities’ goal to 
pursue high-quality growth and reduce the imbalances and vulnerabilities that have 
emerged, most notably with the significant build-up of debt. The authorities have taken 
incremental policy steps to achieve these objectives, but a comprehensive and balanced 
policy approach is needed to manage the challenges facing the economy.  
Outlook. GDP growth is expected to remain resilient at 5 percent in 2024 despite the 
continued property sector adjustment, supported by strong public investment and the 
ongoing recovery in private consumption. Inflation has been low in recent quarters amid 
considerable economic slack and is expected to pick up gradually as the output gap closes 
and the impact of lower commodity prices wanes. Growth is expected to slow in the medium 
term amid declining productivity growth and aging. 
Risks. Risks are tilted to the downside. The key domestic risk is a deeper- or longer-than-
expected contraction in the property sector, which, combined with high debt levels, could 
result in a sustained period of disinflationary pressures, adverse macro-financial feedback 
loops, and risks of deflation. External risks include greater-than-expected weakening of 
external demand, and an escalation of fragmentation pressures. 
Near-term policies to support domestic demand and mitigate risks. The immediate 
priorities are to facilitate a more efficient and less costly property sector adjustment and to 
provide adequate macroeconomic policy support amid continued slack and elevated 
downside risks.  
• 
Property sector: The ongoing correction is welcome and needed to reduce the sector to 
a sustainable size after significant overbuilding and accumulation of excess leverage by 
property developers. The policy priority should now be the timely resolution of unviable 
developers and the deployment of central government (CG) financing to accelerate 
completion of unfinished, presold housing, which would help restore homebuyer 
confidence. Greater housing price flexibility, especially in the primary market, would also 
support housing demand and the clearing of the inventory overhang.  
• 
Macro and financial policies: Fiscal policy should accommodate one-off CG fiscal 
support for the real estate sector to complete unfinished housing and protect 
homebuyers, which implies an expansion of the primary deficit in 2024 and 2025. Aside

from such support, a neutral structural fiscal stance in 2024 and a gradual decline in the structural 
deficit in 2025 would balance the tradeoffs between supporting domestic demand, reducing 
deflation risks, and containing government debt which remains elevated. Additional monetary 
easing via interest rates would support domestic demand, while allowing for greater exchange rate 
flexibility would help absorb external shocks and reduce disinflationary pressures and deflation risks. 
Financial sector policies should aim to mitigate financial stability risks and preserve financial 
institutions’ capacity for credit intermediation. 
Structural policies: Tackling the debt overhang, preventing the build-up of new risks, and fostering 
high-quality and sustainable growth requires comprehensive structural reforms, including to 
economic frameworks: 
• 
Fiscal:  Sustained general government (GG) fiscal consolidation over the medium term will help 
stabilize debt, while restructuring the debt of unsustainable local government financing vehicles 
(LGFV) through greater use of insolvency frameworks will reduce LG fiscal strains. GG fiscal 
consolidation should be based on a reduction of off-budget investment of LGs, together with 
tax and social security reforms. Fiscal framework reforms will be essential to sustain the needed 
consolidation. Priorities include public financial management reforms to strengthen CG 
monitoring of LG finances, increased transfers from the CG to LGs to close LG financing gaps, 
and the establishment and enforcement of fiscal rules to ensure fiscal discipline among LGs.  
• 
Financial: Financial stability risks remain elevated amid significant credit risks from property 
sector and LGFV debt, declining bank profitability, and heightened vulnerability of small banks. 
Reform priorities include strengthening the crisis management and bank resolution frameworks, 
adopting a comprehensive strategy to address weak banks, and enhancing systemic risk 
oversight. 
• 
Structural: Achieving high-quality, sustainable growth will require reforms that address both 
demand imbalances (specifically to increase reliance on consumption) and supply-side 
distortions. The service sector can become a driver of growth and a creator of jobs if measures 
that promote a rebalancing of demand towards consumption, such as structurally boosting the 
social safety net, are combined with reforms that reduce entry barriers and other regulatory 
restrictions. Other priorities include steps to (i) ensure competitive neutrality between state- and 
privately-owned firms; (ii) reduce regulatory uncertainty; (iii) strengthen human capital; (iv) 
improve job matching and labor mobility across sectors and regions; and (v) increase the 
retirement age to slow the decline in the labor force. 
• 
Industrial policies (IP) and trade distortions: China should scale back its extensive use of IP to 
reduce domestic resource misallocation and mitigate international spillovers. This, together with 
greater transparency around such policies and avoidance of trade and investment restrictions, 
would reinforce China’s efforts to strengthen the WTO and the multilateral trading system. 
• 
Climate:  China has made rapid progress towards meeting its climate goals thanks to concerted 
policy effort. Expanding the coverage of the emissions trading scheme (ETS) would help achieve 
emissions goals more efficiently while auctioning permits would raise revenue to compensate 
for adverse distributional effects.

CONTEXT 
1.      
China’s economic development over the 
past few decades has been remarkable. Since the 
1990s, China registered impressive growth, 
facilitated by market-oriented reforms, trade 
liberalization, and greater integration into global 
supply chains. By tapping its potential, the Chinese 
economy has outperformed peers, becoming the 
second largest economy in the world. High growth 
has translated into impressive gains on various 
social metrics, including the eradication of extreme 
poverty.  
2.      
These achievements have been accompanied by imbalances and rising vulnerabilities, 
and headwinds to growth have emerged. Persistently high household saving rates have facilitated 
rapid capital accumulation but have also enabled 
an overreliance on investment as opposed to 
consumption. The focus on ambitious growth 
targets, with LGs competing to promote priority 
sectors, has contributed to rising capital 
misallocation and low returns to capital. Excessive 
investment in infrastructure and housing in the 
2010s has resulted in elevated debt of property 
developers and LGs and the build-up of 
vulnerabilities. The ongoing housing market 
correction is needed to bring the sector back to a 
sustainable size, but it is weighing on economic activity and LGs finances, given their heavy reliance 
on property as a source of revenue, while also worsening asset quality of banks and increasing 
macrofinancial risks. The focus on industrial policies has contributed to rising resource misallocation 
and raised concerns from trading partners about international spillovers. Rising geo-economic 
fragmentation pressures, and China’s already high global market shares in some exports, suggest 
that external demand for manufacturing goods could face constraints, further limiting growth.  
3.      
Recognizing the need to contain these vulnerabilities and to foster new sources of 
growth, the broader goal of achieving high-quality growth has been guiding economic policy. 
In the past decade, the authorities have stepped up support for innovation and for green and high-
tech sectors, upgraded financial sector regulations, and improved universal health care. The 2024 
Government Work Report (GWR), which lays out the authorities’ policy priorities and targets for the 
year, signals increased coordination between fiscal, monetary, financial, and other policy instruments 
(industrial and environmental policies) with an aim to unleash “new productive forces”. It also

recognizes financial risks from the property sector and LG debt and envisages the ramping up of 
social and affordable housing investment and strengthening of control over LG fiscal operations.  
4.      
However, the accompanying economic policy changes have been incremental, and a 
more comprehensive and balanced policy approach would help in putting China on a path of 
high-quality and more sustainable growth. The aggregate household saving ratio remains high as 
upgrades to the social safety net have been modest, and leverage is still increasing in many sectors 
amid the authorities’ continued focus on supply-side policies, including boosting investment in 
green and high-tech sectors. While these sectors have expanded rapidly, headwinds to growth 
remain, including from the ongoing property sector correction. The incremental approach to tackle 
property sector and LG debt overhang has kept financial stresses localized and limited their macro-
financial spillovers, but not resolved underlying asset quality problems, entrenched weak confidence, 
and left the related risks of deflation unaddressed. In recent Article IV consultations, staff has thus 
advised for comprehensive efforts for a faster resolution of property market stresses and reforms to 
rebalance demand and strengthen market forces in key areas (see Annex IV).  
RECENT DEVELOPMENTS 
5.      
China’s economy has remained resilient despite the property market correction. Real 
GDP grew by 5.2 percent in 2023, meeting the government’s growth target, and edged up further to 
5.3 percent y/y in 2024Q1. Private investment has been broadly flat, with the contraction in 
residential investment offset by strength in manufacturing investment. Growth was supported by 
public consumption and investment, which contributed significantly to domestic demand growth in 
2023 and 2024Q1. Private consumption rebounded following the reopening, growing faster than 
GDP at 9 percent in 2023 and contributing 3.2 percentage points to GDP growth. The household 
savings rate has declined post reopening but remains above pre-pandemic levels amid weak 
consumer confidence. Net exports contributed significantly to growth in 2024Q1, reversing the 
modest drag in 2023. Monthly activity data suggest solid industrial production in April and May, 
though retail sales indicate relatively subdued domestic demand for goods and services.

The property sector remains a significant drag on economic activity. Despite recent 
policies to support the sector (see ¶25 for details), 
housing starts, sales, and residential investment 
have continued to decline sharply, with the latter 
contracting by about 10 percent y/y in the first five 
months of 2024, following a cumulative decline of 
about 25 percent in 2022-23. Completion rates for 
unfinished presold housing have risen moderately, 
in part due to policy support through the “Bao Jiao 
Lou” initiative, which is on track to achieve the 
targeted completion of 3.5 million units, with 86 
percent of these units already delivered as of end-
2023. Even so, the inventory pending completion remains high as of end-2023, amounting to eight 
times the 2023 annual completion rate, undermining homebuyer confidence. Concerns over delays 
in new housing delivery, coupled with limited price reductions in primary markets (urban city prices 
are only 5 percent below their peak on average) has shifted housing demand from the primary to 
the secondary market. The steep decline in primary sales has resulted in several large developers 
defaulting, with distress spreading to previously stable developers. About 50 percent of developers 
are now grappling with solvency and viability concerns, while an additional 15 percent or so are 
facing liquidity problems.1  
 
 
7.      
Persistent disinflationary pressures have emerged amid continued economic slack and 
lower food and commodity prices. After being in negative territory from October 2023 to January 
2024, headline CPI inflation rose to 0.3 percent (y/y) in May. Core inflation, while consistently 
positive, was also low at 0.6 percent in May 2024. As of May 2024, producer prices had declined for

20 consecutive months, driven largely by falling global commodity prices but also slack in some 
sectors. The GDP deflator fell by -1.0 percent in 2024Q1, following a decline of -0.6 percent in 2023, 
with weakness in nominal GDP growth constraining corporate profits and debt servicing capacity.  
 
 
8.      
While declining, economic slack remains significant. Staff estimates of the output gap 
suggest a narrowing from about -2.8 percent in 2022 to -1.2 percent in 2024, and industrial capacity 
utilization is low, at around 74 percent in 2024Q1, compared to pre-pandemic average of 76.6 
percent. While the unemployment rate declined modestly from 5.6 percent in late 2022 to 5.0 
percent in May 2024, other labor market indicators suggest broad-based slack, including PMI 
employment indices that are low by historical standards. Wage growth remains subdued and data 
from some private sector surveys and online recruitment platforms suggest declining salaries for 
new hires.   
9.      
External position was stable despite weak capital flows.  
• 
The current account surplus declined from 2.5 percent of GDP in 2022 to 1.4 percent of GDP in 
2023, and 1.0 percent of GDP in 2024Q1, driven by a widening of the services deficit as China’s 
outbound tourism recovered and a decline in the goods trade surplus as goods exports fell. The 
latter reflected the unwinding of the COVID-related export boom, weak global demand, and 
lower export prices. Imports evolved in line with domestic demand.2 While goods trade 
recovered in 2024Q1, exports and imports remain below the 2023Q1 peaks. The external 
position in 2023 is assessed as broadly in line with the level implied by medium-term 
fundamentals and desirable policies (Annex I).  
 
2 In recent years, the trade surplus measured in the BoP has been smaller than the trade surplus measured using 
customs data. The recording of imports and exports related to global production arrangements (e.g., factoryless 
manufacturing) may largely explain this divergence (see Annex VII).

Capital outflow pressures have eased since 2023Q4. Nonresident net equity and bond inflows 
were close to record lows in 2023, with the largest outflows seen mid-year. Despite a rebound in 
portfolio flows in 2023Q4, cumulative portfolio outflows in China since early 2022 are in stark 
contrast with developments in other EMs, likely reflecting negative perceptions about growth 
prospects, policy uncertainty, and geopolitical risks. Monetary policy divergence with advanced 
economies also contributed. Inward FDI was at the lowest on record in 2023 and remained 
anemic in 2024Q1 (0.2 percent of GDP in both periods), while outward FDI remained stable at 1 
percent of GDP. The stability in outward FDI masks ongoing geographical diversification of 
Chinese FDI, with higher flows to geopolitically aligned countries, and a shift away of investment 
from larger economies, consistent with the emergence of “connector” countries (see SIP).   
• 
Notwithstanding depreciation pressures, the  
exchange rate has been largely stable against 
the US dollar since mid-2023.  Since July 2023 
the authorities set the daily RMB fixing at a 
level significantly stronger than market 
consensus (with the exchange rate hovering 
close to the weak end of the 2 percent trading 
band around the fixing for prolonged 
periods). The authorities tightened offshore 
liquidity, and lowered reserve requirements 
on foreign currency deposits, which 
supported the RMB/USD rate. As of May, the REER depreciated by around 2.6 percent compared 
to the 2023 average, faster than the NEER (around 0.1 percent appreciation) due to low inflation 
in China relative to trading partners.  
• 
FX reserves remain adequate. International reserves increased in 2023 by US$110 billion, largely 
due to favorable valuation effects. At US$3.2 trillion as of May 2024, China’s FX reserves level is 
assessed to be adequate (Annex I).

10.      The authorities further eased monetary policy amid low inflation. The PBC cut the 
required reserve ratio (RRR) by 50 basis points in February 2024, infusing approximately 1 trillion 
yuan (around 0.35 percent of M2) in long-term liquidity into the market. The cumulative reduction in 
reference interest rates between early 2023 and March 2024 has been modest, at 20, 20 and 35 basis 
points for 7-day reverse repurchase operation rate, 1-year and 5-year loan prime rates, respectively. 
Additional easing was implemented through quantity-based instruments, including structural credit 
policy tools.  
11.      Despite monetary policy easing, financial conditions have tightened modestly since 
2023Q3. 
• 
Overall conditions: While nominal interest rates and corporate bond yields have declined, real 
rates remain high, driven by declining inflation. Bond and equity financing have slowed amid the 
extended declines in equity prices since 2021, 
with the acute stress in equity markets in early 
2024 triggering policy interventions, including 
direct purchases by state-linked financial 
institutions and increased scrutiny of trading 
and short-selling activities.3 Property 
developers continue to face funding challenges 
across all funding sources. External financial 
conditions have also tightened with higher 
interest rates in major AEs.  
• 
Credit: Total Social Financing (TSF) growth decelarated to historic low levels, from 9.8 percent in

11.4 percent in 2023H1, largely on account of  declining property-related loans, which was 
partially offset by a significant increase in inclusive loans (+21 percent y/y) and industrial credit 
(+24 percent y/y), including to strategic manufacturing sectors.  
12.      Financial sector vulnerabilities remain elevated, given credit risks and bank 
profitability pressures.  
• 
The banking system is adequately capitalized in the aggregate but is facing intensifying 
profitability and asset quality pressures. Asset yields have declined by 80 bps since 2020 amid 
ongoing monetary policy easing, the repricing of mortgage interest rates and accelerated 
mortgage pre-payments. However, funding costs have only declined by 20 bps as households 
and corporates shifted savings from demand deposits into higher-yielding long-term deposits. 
While the headline NPL ratio continues to drift lower amid the extended use of forbearance 
measures, property sector NPLs have increased (from an estimated 5 percent in 2022 to 6 
percent in 2023) and personal consumption loans are also showing early signs of worsening 
asset quality.  
• 
Small and medium-sized commercial and rural banks are the weak link in the large banking 
system. China has close to 4000 such banks, collectively accounting for 25 percent of total 
banking system assets. These banks have seen the largest decline in profitability, and they have 
higher NPL ratios and lower provisions and capital buffers than other banks, in part reflecting 
higher share of risk exposures to property developers and inclusive sectors (Figure 7, panel 4). 
Furthermore, the number of small and rural banks is disproportionately high relative to the size 
of the local economy in poorer and fiscally weaker regions, leading to fierce competition, poor 
governance, and challenges to proper supervisory oversight. The latest push to consolidate 
smaller institutions started in 2023 (building on earlier efforts to recapitalize small banks), when 
several mergers and acquisitions took place.

• 
Risks from nonbank financial institutions (NBFIs) are concentrated in the asset management sector. 
The asset management reforms in 2018 have 
helped reduce risky practices in this subsector. 
Nevertheless, the sector is subject to material 
credit risks, including from property-related 
and LGFV sectors, and liquidity risks in its 
asset management products. While still small 
in aggregate, credit from nonbank financial 
institutions is increasing gradually. Lending 
between banks and NBFIs is also rising, 
pointing to risks from rising 
interconnectedness in the financial system.  
• 
Corporate and household leverage remains high: Corporate debt is relatively high in China, at 
about 122 percent of GDP, with vulnerabilities primarily concentrated among property 
developers. Corporate profitability beyond the property sector has also declined in recent years, 
which combined with the rapid growth of bank lending to small enterprises, could add to credit 
risks going forward. Household balance sheets remain largely healthy given high household 
savings, while household leverage has stabilized at around 60 percent of GDP since the 
pandemic, after a period of rapid increase in the past decade. 
13.      The fiscal stance in 2023 was neutral as fiscal easing by the CG offset tightening by 
LGs. A decline in on- and off-budget LG spending, in part due to fiscal strains from lower property-
related revenue and financing, was offset by extended tax relief to support the recovery and a 
package of CG-funded investment in natural disaster reconstruction and resilience introduced in 
2023Q4. Expectations of stronger backing of LG financing vehicles (LGFV) debt by the government 
have reduced LGFV spreads since mid-2023, but administrative borrowing constraints appear to 
have been tightened, with net bond financing turning negative in 2023Q4, forcing LGFVs to rely 
more on bank loans.

14.      The 2024 budget also implies a broadly neutral fiscal stance, with a continued focus on 
supply-side measures. Despite additional expenditure financed with a newly announced RMB 1 
trillion ultra-long CG special bond, the augmented cyclically-adjusted primary deficit is projected to 
increase only by 0.2 percent because of lower-than-expected general budget expenditure. The 
authorities provided forward guidance that such special bonds will continue to be issued in coming 
years. The budget continues to prioritize supply-side measures, such as financing strategic 
investments and tax relief for innovation and manufacturing.  
15.      Trade restrictions continue to proliferate globally amid heightened trade tensions 
between China and its trading partners. This includes restrictions by trading partners placed on 
China’s imports of high-tech goods, higher tariffs announced on certain Chinese exports to the US, 
and countervailing duties on electric vehicles announced by the EU following an investigation into 
state-support. Ongoing WTO investigations into China’s shipbuilding practices, public procurement 
of medical devices, and state-support which affects competition in other countries may result in 
further trade measures. China imposed restrictions on exports of gallium and germanium in August 
2023, followed by restrictions in December 2023 on exports of graphite as well an export ban on 
certain processing technology for rare earths. Production and processing of these minerals are 
highly concentrated in China.4  
OUTLOOK AND RISKS 
16.      Growth is expected at 5 percent in 2024, supported by strong public investment and a 
continued recovery in private consumption, before slowing in the medium-term amid long-
standing headwinds. In the baseline, real estate investment is projected to contract further in 2024 
amid continuing financial stress among property developers, though macro-financial spillovers are 
expected to remain contained.  
• 
In 2024, growth in private consumption is projected to remain strong as the household savings 
rate is expected to continue 
normalizing towards pre-pandemic 
levels. Public investment is projected to 
remain strong, contributing 
significantly to growth, while private 
investment is expected to remain weak 
amid continued drag from real estate 
investment. Net exports are expected 
to result in a small positive 
contribution to growth in 2024, 
reversing the modest drag in 2023.  
 
4 According to the IEA, China accounts for roughly 60 percent of global rare earth mining production, whereas its 
share of refining for rare earth elements is nearly 90 percent.

• 
In 2025, real GDP growth is projected to slow to 4.5 percent despite an assumed stabilization in 
residential investment at a lower level, reflecting weaker growth in private consumption 
following two years of a reopening rebound, lower contribution from net exports, and a small 
drag from fiscal policy. 
• 
Economic slack will still be present. Overall, the negative output gap is closing gradually and is 
projected at -1.2 percent in 2024 and -0.5 percent in 2025.  
• 
Headline inflation is projected at 0.7 percent on average for 2024, with somewhat less drag from 
food prices than in 2023, and a moderate increase in energy prices. Core inflation is projected to 
remain subdued due to continued slack, rising gradually to 0.9 percent in 2024 and to 1.5 
percent in 2025.  
• 
The current account surplus is projected to remain broadly stable at around 1.5 percent of GDP 
in 2024-25, as a recovery in export volumes and terms-of-trade is expected to be offset by a 
gradual increase of outbound travel to pre-pandemic levels.  
• 
Over the medium term, growth is expected to gradually decelerate to 3.3 percent in 2029 due to 
downward pressures from the declining labor force and slower productivity growth.  The current 
account surplus is projected to narrow further over the medium term, largely reflecting rising 
social spending pressures as the population ages. Additionally, the exports-to-GDP ratio is 
expected to decline in the baseline. 
17.      Risks to growth and inflation are tilted to the downside.  
• 
Downside domestic risks to growth and inflation. The property market correction remains a 
significant risk to the outlook. The decline in residential investment could be longer- or larger-
than expected, given uncertainty about the extent of inventory overhang or the underlying value 
of the housing stock. Prolonged weakness in the property sector could also trigger renewed LG 
financing strains and result in unintended fiscal tightening, while policies that delay the property 
sector adjustment could add to fiscal costs. Furthermore, weaker-than-expected domestic 
demand amid high debt levels could result in prolonged downward price pressures and 
increased risks of adverse macro-financial feedback loops, including through some weak small- 
and medium-size banks. The need to repair balance sheets could spread beyond the property 
sector and LGFVs, impacting households and corporates as the real burden of debt increases, 
thereby reinforcing aggregate demand weakness and downward price pressures. Staff estimates 
suggest that negative shocks that widen the output gap and lower inflation expectations could 
substantially increase the probability of future deflation (see Box 1) and that a period of 
prolonged deflation could reduce the level of GDP by 5.4 percent relative to the baseline over 5 
years, with significant international spillovers (see Box 2). 
• 
Downside external risks: Deepening geoeconomic fragmentation and the associated decline in 
external demand and capital flows are the key downside external risks, which could be 


PEOPLE’S REPUBLIC OF CHINA 
INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND 15 
exacerbated by increased political uncertainty (e.g., from elections in major economies). The 
impact of deepening geoeconomic fragmentation could be large, especially if accompanied with 
global asset repricing, triggering an economic slowdown in China and compounding the 
domestic risks discussed above. 
• 
Upside risks.  Decisive policy action to facilitate adjustment in the property sector or market-
oriented structural reforms would boost consumer and business confidence and lead to a faster-
than-expected rebound in private demand and a rise in core inflation, reducing risks of deflation. 
Authorities’ Views 
18.      The authorities are optimistic about the near-term growth outlook and were confident 
that the government’s annual growth target of around 5 percent will be achieved. They noted 
that the recently announced macroeconomic policies will further boost domestic demand. 
Specifically, the consumer goods trade-in program would support private consumption, and the 
equipment upgrade program would improve firms’ productivity and raise investment. They noted 
that overall housing demand has stabilized, as lower sales of new houses have been offset by higher 
sales in the second-hand housing market. Furthermore, the new property sector support measures 
are expected to restore consumer confidence and stabilize real estate investment. They 
acknowledged a temporary weakness in aggregate demand, due to the property market contraction 
but continued strong industrial production. With the anticipated strengthening of domestic demand, 
the authorities expect the overall price level to gradually rise.  
19.      The authorities noted that their projection of medium-term growth was higher at 
about 5-6 percent. They agreed that population aging is a major headwind to medium-term 
growth but argued that higher quality of human capital, as reflected in increased years of education, 
would compensate for the declining size of the labor force. They also emphasized scientific and 
technological innovation, particularly in emerging sectors, which together with deepening structural 
reforms and strong domestic competition, would continue to boost productivity.  
20.      The authorities place greater emphasis on external rather than domestic risks to the 
outlook. They remain concerned about the highly uncertain external environment and risks from the 
insufficient global economic recovery, tight global financial conditions, and elevated geopolitical 
risks. They were particularly concerned about the growing fragmentation pressures and the impact 
on the global economy. Although they agreed domestic factors, including weaker-than-expected 
domestic demand, could weigh on the outlook, they saw limited downside risks amid a continued 
recovery and supportive macroeconomic policies and the property sector measures. The authorities 
viewed the risk of deflation in China as low.  
21.      The authorities agreed with staff's external sector assessment. They viewed China's 
external position as broadly in line with fundamentals and saw no need for a significant adjustment 
in the CA surplus or the exchange rate level. They expect the current account to remain broadly 
stable as the continued recovery of exports, including of high value added sectors such as 


PEOPLE’S REPUBLIC OF CHINA 
16 
INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND 
telecommunication and information technology, matches the recovery of imports. They viewed 
monetary policy tightening in developed economies as a major factor behind recent capital flow 
dynamics in China. They expect capital flows to normalize as the external environment improves and 
China’s economy recovers. 
SUPPORTING DOMESTIC DEMAND AMID THE 
PROPERTY MARKET ADJUSTMENT  
The ongoing property market adjustment, while needed, remains an important risk to the economic 
outlook. A two-pronged policy approach is needed to facilitate a more efficient and less costly 
transition for the property sector while mitigating the risk of a deeper-than-needed adjustment. First, 
accelerating the resolution of insolvent developers and deploying CG resources to tackle the still large 
stock of unfinished, presold housing would restore homebuyer confidence. Other steps to reduce the 
housing inventory overhang, such as greater price flexibility and the expansion of social housing, would 
also help. Second, macroeconomic policies should support domestic demand while the economy 
remains below potential, which will also mitigate the adverse feedback loop between property sector 
adjustment, economic activity, and debt overhang among developers and LGs, thereby mitigating risks 
of deflation and unintended LG fiscal tightening. 
A.   Policies to Facilitate the Adjustment in the Property Sector  
22.      The housing market correction, now in its fourth year, is necessary and should 
continue. The property sector experienced a significant expansion in the 2010s and was a key 
contributor to GDP growth. However, the rapid growth of the sector, which was accompanied by a 
buildup of leverage among property developers, was unsustainable. A significant correction in the 
housing market began in 2021, with real estate investment and sales declining sharply and some 
large and heavily indebted developers facing insolvency. This correction is vital for guiding the 
sector onto a leaner and more sustainable trajectory, with estimates indicating that fundamental 
demand for housing will decline by 35 to 55 percent over the next 10 years compared to the 2012-
2021 average (see 2023 SIP). 


PEOPLE’S REPUBLIC OF CHINA 
INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND 17 
  
   
23.      The authorities have stepped up efforts to steer the property market transition, aiming 
to support homebuyer demand and developer finances. They have expanded the scope of the 
affordable housing and urban redevelopment programs, including by providing RMB 500 billion of 
funding through the PBC’s Pledged Supplementary Lending (PSL), with an aim to potentially absorb 
part of the inventory overhang and support construction activity. To address financing constraints 
facing unfinished projects, the authorities have set up a cross-agency coordination mechanism to 
facilitate bank financing for a “whitelist” of approved projects. As of May 2024, loans worth 935 bn 
yuan (0.8 percent of GDP) have been approved under this mechanism. Other measures include lifting 
most home purchase restrictions (HPR), easing prudential requirements for home loans, lowering 
mortgage rates, and facilitating the refinancing of existing mortgages. In May 2024, the authorities 
announced a package of policies to intensify efforts to resolve property market distress. These 
include expanding an existing PBC facility to RMB 300 billion to support local SOEs acquiring 
completed housing and converting them to affordable housing, permitting local governments to 
reacquire land from developers, abolishing a nation-wide policy floor for mortgage interest rates, 
and reducing the minimum downpayment ratio for mortgage loans. Forbearance measures for 
distressed property developers have been extended until end-2024 and guidance to limit price 
adjustments continues.  
24.      Despite policy efforts, high uncertainty 
persists around the outlook for the sector, with 
certain government policies possibly delaying 
the transition and increasing future costs. Some 
government policies can play an important role in 
the sector’s transition. Buying existing inventories 
at appropriate prices for affordable housing 
schemes can help reduce the inventory overhang. 
The ‘whitelist’, with safeguards to ensure robust 
project viability evaluation, can partially tackle the

pre-sold unfinished housing stock. However, a clear strategy to address the large stock of pre-sold 
housing in commercially unviable projects by distressed developers is still lacking. Furthermore, 
measures to boost homebuyer’s demand are likely to be ineffective amid low homebuyer confidence 
and limited price adjustment, which causes uncertainty about future prices and has discouraged 
households from purchasing property. In addition, forbearance has allowed non-viable developers to 
remain in the market, slowing progress to complete the substantial inventory of pre-sold housing, 
and thus further eroding homebuyers’ trust in developers’ ability to deliver new homes. 
Consequently, weakened housing demand and concerns over credit losses that have increased 
banks’ reluctance to lend are causing cash flow challenges for developers, affecting even robust, 
state-supported developers, and deepening distress. 
25.      A comprehensive policy package, supplemented by one-off CG fiscal resources, could 
facilitate a more efficient and less costly transition while protecting against downside risks. A 
well-articulated and communicated policy package would include the following measures: 
• 
Utilizing CG fiscal resources to protect homebuyers of pre-sold unfinished houses. Concerns of 
significant losses to homebuyers of unfinished pre-sold housing are a key constraint holding 
back the resolution of insolvent developers. To mitigate homebuyer losses and enable the 
resolution of nonviable developers, fiscal resources should be deployed. For commercially 
unviable5 projects of developers involved in insolvency procedures, CG resources could be used 
to complete and deliver the pre-sold unfinished projects or offer compensation to homebuyers, 
whichever is less costly. The CG may also consider converting some unviable projects into social 
housing and integrate it into the affordable housing project. If completion of commercially 
viable projects is hindered by insufficient financing due to pervasive risk aversion, CG resources 
could offer risk-sharing capital or guarantees, with strict safeguards to ensure eventual 
repayment. While data gaps make it difficult to precisely estimate potential costs which are 
subject to considerable uncertainty, staff calculations suggest that implementing such a scheme 
could entail fiscal costs of around 5½ percent of GDP over 4 years.6 To mitigate moral hazard 
and avoid the perception of a bail out of developers, CG support should be provided as a one-
time measure, assets should be acquired at a sufficiently low cost, and support should be 
targeted to homes that are pre-sold before a certain cut-off date and that cannot be completed 
using market financing.   
 
5 Projects that are commercially unviable are those for which completion is not economically justified based on cost-
benefit analysis. 
6 The 5½ percent of GDP estimate is based on median estimates of total completion costs of both viable and 
nonviable projects that require government intervention. Unfinished housing should ideally be completed using 
market-based financing. Financing facilitated by the “whitelist” could help fund part of these projects which are 
commercially viable. A nation-wide plan should be developed, including total cost estimates and management 
procedures for incomplete projects, while coordination between the CG and LGs would be needed to develop 
implementation strategies reflecting regional heterogeneity. See Box 1 in the 2022 China Staff Report for further 
details on the estimation methodology.  


PEOPLE’S REPUBLIC OF CHINA 
INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND 19 
• 
Accelerating the resolution of insolvent developers. The scheme to resolve unfinished pre-sold 
projects should be accompanied by timely resolution or liquidation of insolvent developers. This 
can be achieved in a market-driven manner, utilizing corporate restructuring and insolvency 
frameworks, and by phasing out of forbearance. This would also expedite the adjustment of the 
housing market and restore confidence in the ability of surviving developers to deliver housing. 
Meanwhile, enhancing the crisis management and resolution framework will be crucial to contain 
negative spillovers (¶45 and 46). 
• 
Expediting the recovery of housing demand including by allowing for greater price flexibility and 
improving financial conditions for solvent developers. Government-backstopped completion 
guarantees for new housing projects and strict escrow rules can help restore confidence 
regarding solvent property developers’ ability to deliver homes, thus invigorating demand and 
improving developer finances. These guarantees should be based on conservative underwriting 
practices and subject to strict governance standards. Greater price flexibility, for example, 
through the elimination of price guidance in the primary market, while monitoring and 
mitigating potential macrofinancial spillovers, can further stimulate demand and help restore 
equilibrium. The three government-led projects—affordable housing, urban village renovation, 
and emergency infrastructure—aiming to bolster real estate investment, affordability, and quality 
of housing, would also help meet demand for shelter while providing alternative revenue 
streams for developers. Deeper reforms to developers’ pre-sale financing model, which played a 
significant role in the buildup of vulnerabilities, should be a key medium-term priority. 
Authorities’ Views 
26.      The authorities believe that the existing policies are sufficient to generate a positive 
momentum in the property market. They noted that the three projects are steadily advancing and 
highlighted that the recently announced policy package has strong support and is subject to high 
standard and has already strengthened homebuyer confidence. They consider resolving unfinished 
presold housing and tackling the inventory overhang as the key priorities, and viewed the 
coordination mechanism for real estate financing (the ‘white list’) as the key measure for addressing 
the remaining issues with housing delivery. They emphasized that projects not included in the ‘white 
list’ will also be supported by commercial banks in accordance with market principles and the rule of 
law. These projects may be resolved through the judicial insolvency process, and homebuyers’ rights 
will be adequately protected. The authorities also noted that there is no centralized guidance on 
price adjustments in the primary market, though local governments may have used administrative 
measures to limit price adjustments. The authorities expect several key factors to support housing 
demand in the medium term, including continued urbanization and project demand for housing 
upgrades. 
 


PEOPLE’S REPUBLIC OF CHINA 
20 
INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND 
B.   Macro Policies to Support Domestic Demand 
27.      Fiscal policy in the near-term should focus on providing one-off CG financial support 
for the real estate sector and avoiding a local government fiscal cliff. 
• 
Property sector support: Despite high and rising debt levels, one-off CG financial support for the 
real estate sector is warranted. While such a targeted package would increase short-term debt 
levels relative to the baseline, it will mitigate the risk of a larger and more protracted contraction 
in real estate investment and will help to rebuild confidence and boost consumption, thereby 
increasing growth and fiscal revenues in the medium term. The recommended CG fiscal support 
package would entail a mix of above the line spending (to compensate buyers or finish pre-sold 
housing), as well as 
below-the-line 
liquidity support for 
solvent developers (in 
the form of risk-
sharing capital and 
guarantees), totaling 
about 5½ percent of 
GDP spread over 4 
years (given the large 
number of projects 
spread across various regions that require time to finish).7  
• 
Fiscal policy stance: The significant recommended property sector support would imply an 
expansion of the cyclically adjusted primary deficit in 2024 and 2025 (text table). Stripping out 
the impact of the one-off property sector package, a neutral structural fiscal stance in 2024 
would balance the tradeoffs between 
supporting domestic demand, defusing 
deflation risks, and containing unfavorable 
debt dynamics. In addition, maintaining a 
neutral structural fiscal stance by the general 
government in 2024 will necessitate CG on-
budget expansion to counteract potential LG 
tightening driven by financing constraints at 
the local level (including LGFVs), especially in 
provinces more affected by the real estate 
 
7 The proposed package comprises about 3.8 percent of GDP in above-the-line spending, 1.3 percent of GDP in 
below-the-line support (which increases CG debt), and 0.6 percent of GDP in guarantees (which do not immediately 
affect debt).

contraction. The structural deficit should start declining gradually in 2025, with a pace 
dependent on the strength of the recovery, inflation developments, and property market 
outlook. Within this fiscal envelope, structural measures could support growth by reorienting 
expenditure away from less productive investment and towards support for households. Such 
fiscal re-composition could boost GDP by 0.5 percent and inflation by nearly 0.1 percentage 
points in the near term for an unchanged structural primary deficit (text chart). Ensuring debt 
sustainability in the medium term will require sustained general government (GG) fiscal 
consolidation beyond 2025 as well as restructuring the stock of unsustainable LGFV debt (see 
¶39 and ¶41 for details).  
28.      Additional monetary easing via interest rates would support domestic demand and 
inflation. The monetary policy easing so far in 2024, including the cuts to the RRR and the 5-year 
LPR, is welcome. Given subdued inflation and economic slack, there is scope to further loosen 
monetary policy using interest rates, which would help support private investment and consumption, 
ease debt servicing burdens, and guard against risks of entrenching low inflation expectations. 
Phasing out deposit and lending rate guidance policies would improve transmission and create more 
space for monetary easing by mitigating the impact of looser policy on bank profitability.  
29.      Greater exchange rate flexibility would help absorb external shocks and lower 
deflation risks. The stability of the RMB/USD exchange rate since mid-2023, despite the large 
interest rate differential, has constrained a key transmission channel of monetary policy. Limiting 
exchange rate movements for extended periods of time risks rendering the exchange rate the de-
facto nominal anchor and limiting the effectiveness of monetary policy. Greater exchange rate 
flexibility, including by letting the daily fixing move with market expectations, would help counter 
disinflationary pressures, facilitate adjustments to external shocks, and relieve potential pressure on 
capital flow measures (CFMs). Capital flow measures (CFMs) should not be used to substitute for 
warranted macroeconomic adjustment and greater exchange rate flexibility. 
30.      In the near-term, financial sector policies should mitigate future risks to financial 
stability. To contain asset quality risks, the authorities should remove forbearance and strictly 
enforce prudential policies, which would incentivize debt restructuring. To ensure that these 
measures do not unduly impede banks’ lending capacity, they should be complemented by 
regulators preemptively engaging with financial institutions to identify vulnerabilities and prepare for 
any adverse impact. In equity markets, authorities should phase-out the emergency measures such 
as direct purchases and other trading restrictions that impede market functioning and efficient price 
discovery. More broadly, regulatory changes should be carefully sequenced and clearly 
communicated to improve transparency and policy predictability.  
31.      Adopting a comprehensive strategy to strengthen weak banks is critical for 
maintaining economic and financial stability. Addressing risks at small and medium banks is a key 
policy priority given the potential macro-financial spillovers to the local economy, and the 


PEOPLE’S REPUBLIC OF CHINA 
22 
INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND 
authorities are planning to facilitate further consolidation of rural banks. Banks facing difficulties in 
meeting prudential requirements should be required to submit credible restoration plans under 
heightened supervision and corrective actions. Recapitalization efforts should prioritize build-up of 
common equity and the use of public funds for recapitalization should be a last resort and only 
come after burden sharing by existing investors. Non-viable banks should be resolved in a timely 
manner, with stakeholders sharing losses in line with the established hierarchy of claims. 
Consolidation among viable banks should be accompanied by adequate loss recognition and 
recapitalization, in conjunction with other needed financial sector reforms (see section below and 
Box 3). 
32.      If significant downside risks to growth and inflation materialize, more accommodative 
macro policies and early financial sector intervention will be essential. Expansionary fiscal policy 
and more aggressive monetary easing would be warranted to cushion the impact on activity. Fiscal 
policy should focus on expediting funding for unfinished housing and support for households. To 
prevent contagion to the financial system and negative macro-financial feedback loops, systemwide 
liquidity support should be provided, and contingency plans should be implemented, including for 
handling troubled financial institutions. In such a scenario, greater exchange rate flexibility could 
boost net exports and counter deflationary pressures. In the event of large capital outflows that pose 
significant risks to macroeconomic and financial stability, including if markets turn disorderly, 
temporary foreign exchange intervention or tightening of outflow CFMs could be considered as a 
part of a broader policy package.  
Authorities‘ Views 
33.      The authorities view the fiscal stance as proactive in 2024 and the stance in 2025 will 
be determined in a coordinated manner based on the economic situation. They emphasized the 
role of the new one trillion ultra-long CG special bond, which will finance strategic projects, including 
an equipment upgrade program for firms. They expect to continue implementing structural tax and 
fee reduction policies, with a focus on supporting technological innovation and manufacturing 
development. Public investment is still seen as a key driver of economic development. Fiscal support 
for the real estate sector is mainly targeted to affordable housing, and additional spending for 
completing pre-sold housing is not currently planned. The authorities assess the decline in LG net 
land sale revenue to have had a minor impact on LG expenditure, given increased CG transfers. 
34.      The authorities consider the monetary policy stance as broadly appropriate and noted 
plans for further implementing prudent monetary policy through interest rates and quantity-
based tools. They attribute the currently high real interest rates to low inflation and expect these 
rates to gradually decline as inflation recovers. They plan to continue implementing prudent 
monetary policy to support economic growth, including by potentially reducing the reserve 
requirement ratio and interest rates, and by providing liquidity to strategic sectors. 


PEOPLE’S REPUBLIC OF CHINA 
INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND 23 
35.      The authorities reiterated their commitment to a market-determined exchange rate 
but emphasized the need to avoid excessive volatility and unidirectional pressures. The 
authorities stressed that the RMB has fluctuated in both directions in recent years, and market 
participants are better prepared to cope with exchange rate risks. They, however, argued that 
excessive fluctuations could lead to one-sided expectations, and saw the need to manage 
expectations through the use of macro-prudential tools such as a reduction in FX reserve 
requirement (RR) ratio from 9 to 4 percent as well as the re-introduction of the 20 percent reserve 
requirement on marginal forward transactions in September 2022. They also stressed that a stable 
RMB will help other emerging economies and support global financial stability.  
36.      The authorities viewed near-term risks in the banking sector and financial markets as 
largely contained. While noting continued headwinds to bank profitability, they considered asset 
quality risks to be contained, including those from the property sector and inclusive loans. They 
agreed that a broader strategy to address vulnerability in small and medium banks is essential while 
emphasizing that the number of high-risk institutions remains low, with concentration in a few 
regions. Risks in the nonbank financial sectors and financial markets are viewed as contained when 
being assessed in isolation. The authorities viewed the stock market plunge in early 2024 as mainly 
driven by investors’ irrationality rather than deteriorating fundamental values. 
BUILDING RESILIENCE BY UPGRADING POLICY 
FRAMEWORKS  
Years of high investment, driven in part by ambitious growth targets, have raised leverage, 
vulnerabilities, and risks, notably among property developers and LGs. Tackling these issues and 
preventing further build-up of risks requires a comprehensive policy effort, including reforms to 
institutional and policy frameworks. Fiscal consolidation to stabilize general government debt is a 
priority and should be accompanied by measures to reduce vertical fiscal imbalances, restructure 
unsustainable LGFV debt, improve fiscal monitoring, and establish subnational fiscal rules. Improving 
the monetary policy framework along with steps to prepare the financial system for potential spillovers 
from property sector and LGFV debt restructuring will also be essential.  
A.   Reforms to the Fiscal Framework to Ensure Debt Sustainability 
37.      China faces daunting fiscal challenges, especially for LGs. Large fiscal deficits since the 
Global Financial Crisis have led to a significant and rapid buildup of GG debt. LG debt, including both 
official and off-budget, accounts for most of that build up, owing to large public investment to meet 
ambitious growth targets, as well as underfunded social spending mandates. Reduced land sale 
revenues have further exacerbated pre-existing local fiscal gaps. Since the pandemic, however, the 
CG has stepped in and raised more financing to increase on-budget transfers to LGs.  


PEOPLE’S REPUBLIC OF CHINA 
24 
INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND 
 
  
38.      The authorities’ recent measures have reduced short-term LG financing pressures, but 
a comprehensive policy strategy is needed to ensure GG debt sustainability. LGs have been 
allowed to issue debt (within their debt quota) to refinance LGFV debt and clear arrears with 
corporates, whereas banks have also been encouraged to restructure troubled LGFV debt. Tighter 
controls of future LGFV borrowing and LG finances, including LG public-private partnerships, are also 
being enforced. The CG has imposed temporary restrictions on public investment by highly indebted 
provinces and established a National Financial Operation Monitoring Center to internally monitor 
official LG finances. While these measures have eased immediate LG financing pressures, LGFV debt 
remains unsustainable. 
39.      Significant fiscal consolidation, based on 
a reduction of off-budget investment and wide-
ranging tax and social security reforms, will be 
needed to stabilize general government debt. In 
the baseline, the GG debt-to-GDP ratio is projected 
to continue increasing rapidly in the medium-term, 
as growing pension spending offsets reductions in 
off-budget investment. While China still has some 
fiscal space and can finance GG debt at favorable 
rates due to ample domestic savings, sovereign risk 
is assessed to be high over the medium and long 
term (Appendix III), as further increases in government debt ratios will be progressively more difficult 
to manage. This underscores the need for fiscal policy to stabilize GG debt in about 10 years, which 
would require an average annual reduction in the (augmented) GG cyclically adjusted primary 
balance of about 0.7 percentage points from 2025 to 2035. Even so, the (augmented) GG debt would 
stabilize only at about 150-155 percent of GDP (chart panel 2 and Appendix III). Fiscal consolidation 
should be based on reductions of off-budget investment, wide-ranging tax reforms (IMF 2024a), and 
a gradual increase in the retirement age (text table).

40.      Sustained consolidation will require framework reforms to strengthen fiscal discipline 
and transparency, while ensuring continued provision of local services.  
• 
Implementing public financial management reforms: The focus should be on increasing 
transparency around off-budget debt (including with a national audit and adopting international 
reporting principles), strengthening CG monitoring of LG debt, and phasing out provinces’ 
growth targets, which encourage excessive debt-financed investment.  
• 
Reducing vertical imbalances: The CG should reduce the share of expenditure under joint CG-LG 
responsibility and increase the share of revenue allocated to LGs to be commensurate with LG 
expenditure mandates, thus reducing existing vertical fiscal imbalances. Transfers to LGs could 
automatically respond to local economic conditions, further attenuating the need for LGs to 
resort to off-budget financing (IMF 2021).  
• 
Establishing and monitoring subnational fiscal rules: Limiting the flow of new debt will require 
strict controls over LG spending and borrowing (including through LGFVs) going forward. 
Various mechanisms have been used internationally to enforce local fiscal discipline, ranging

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND 
from market mechanisms to strict bans on LG borrowing. China’s current system of discretionary 
debt quotas for LGs and insufficient monitoring of off-budget borrowing has not prevented a 
rapid rise in debt. This system could be replaced with fiscal rules that establish LG borrowing or 
debt service caps as a transparent function of fiscal sustainability indicators. Effective 
enforcement mechanisms, managed by the CG, would be needed to incentivize compliance and 
enhance the credibility of the rules (see Box 4).  
41.      Restructuring the stock of unsustainable LGFV debt through greater use of insolvency 
frameworks is needed to improve LG balance sheets, reduce fiscal strains, and avoid risks of 
even larger costs down the line. Reductions in debt via insolvency appear to be the most effective 
way to repair balance sheets. The use of insolvency frameworks would allow for burden sharing with 
the private sector and facilitate LGFV asset sales. This would increase fiscal space at the (augmented) 
general government level to absorb aging-related costs and implement much-needed upgrades for 
social safety nets. Requiring investors to absorb related losses and add new capital would also 
reduce moral hazard, supporting efforts to control the flow of debt in the future. By contrast, large-
scale refinancing of LGFVs by LGs is likely to endanger the sustainability of official LG debt in some 
regions and could lead to unintended fiscal tightening, with only temporary benefits for financial 
stability. The extent of burden sharing by the CG could be made conditional on LGs implementing 
the fiscal framework reforms discussed above and adhering to fiscal consolidation plans. To avoid 
unintended fiscal tightening and guard against financial stability risks, LGFV insolvencies would have 
to be accompanied by urgent upgrades to the financial safety net and crisis management 
frameworks (see ¶45), as well as deployment of insolvency tools suited for timely LGFV restructuring 
(e.g., hybrid restructuring and out-of-court workouts, see ¶46). Deepening markets for distressed 
assets could also facilitate market-based restructuring of LGFVs. 
Authorities’ Views 
42.      The authorities emphasized that their measures to contain debt risks in 2023 have 
successfully eased LGFV financing costs, reduced LG arrears, and supported the 
transformation of LGFVs. The authorities’ debt reduction plan focuses on gradually eliminating the 
stock of hidden debt and strictly preventing new flows, while accepting a moderate increase in 
official debt. They will classify the debt that LGFVs have raised illegally for LGs as LG hidden debt, 
and allow LGs to refinance a fraction of that debt with LG official bonds, within the LG debt quota. 
LGFV operating debt will instead be dealt with in consultation with financial institutions, in 
accordance with market-oriented and rule-of-law principles. However, the authorities reiterated that 
the Debt Sustainability Assessment should only cover official debt. Regarding the possibility of 
introducing subnational fiscal rules, they noted that LG debt quotas already take into account LG 
fiscal sustainability indicators and investment needs. They expect that gradual delays in the 
retirement age will be implemented in a stable and orderly manner, and respect existing differences 
across population groups. 


PEOPLE’S REPUBLIC OF CHINA 
INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND 27 
B.   Building a Resilient Financial System to Deal with Legacy Problems 
43.      Financial stability risks remain elevated, and at around the same level as at the time of 
the 2023 Consultation, amid significant debt overhang. Continued stress in the property sector 
and the potential need for significant house price adjustments remain key credit risks. Refinancing 
support from the fiscal authorities and financial institutions has helped alleviate LGFV’s short-term 
refinancing risks, but their debt stock is large, and their lack of debt-servicing capacity remains 
unaddressed. In addition, corporate incomes and debt servicing capacity, especially for smaller firms, 
may suffer if deflation risks materialize. These factors point to high credit risks to the financial system 
in the future, at a time when profitability pressures limit financial institutions’ ability to build buffers. 
Vulnerabilities are most acute among small and rural banks, especially in fiscally weaker regions. 
Pockets of vulnerabilities also exist among non-banks, most notably institutions with large exposures 
to the property and LGFV sectors. Interconnectedness between banks and non-banks raises risks of 
transmission of shocks across sectors.  
44.      The authorities have implemented significant changes to the financial regulatory and 
supervisory architecture to support their elevated focus on risk mitigation. The emphasis on 
tackling vulnerabilities around the property sector, local government debt, and smaller financial 
institutions is welcome. The consolidation of supervisory responsibilities and the continued upgrades 
to financial regulations will enhance financial oversight and financial stability in the medium term. To 
ensure the efficacy of the new regulatory architecture, centralized decision-making should be backed 
by rigorous technical analysis and adequate human resources, with prudential policies strengthened 
and strictly enforced.  
45.      However, the crisis management and bank resolution frameworks remain significantly 
underdeveloped. Key reforms and further upgrades are urgently needed to smoothly absorb the 
potential costs of dealing with legacy problems like LGFV and property developer exposures, to 
ensure efficacy of the new financial regulatory and supervisory architecture, and to enhance financial 
stability in the medium term. These include:8  
• 
Upgrading the crisis management framework: The priority is to upgrade the authorities’ crisis 
preparedness and response capacity, backed by the enhancement and adoption of the Financial 
Stability Law, a significant strengthening of the financial safety net, and work on recovery and 
resolution planning.  
• 
Strengthening the bank resolution framework: This will require a clearly identified bank resolution 
authority with strong operational autonomy, standardized procedures, and adequate resources 
 
8 The ongoing Financial Sector Assessment Program (FSAP), expected to be completed later this year, will explore 
these reform priorities in more detail. For progress with respect to recommendations from the 2017 FSAP, see Annex 
V. 


PEOPLE’S REPUBLIC OF CHINA 
28 
INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND 
and operational capabilities. The resolution framework should have clear objectives, well-
specified resolution triggers and strong safeguards for the use of public funding.  
• 
Upgrading systemic risk oversight. The key priority is to enhance surveillance in and across banks, 
non-bank financial intermediaries, and financial markets, by addressing data gaps, upgrading the 
risk monitoring toolkit, and strengthening inter-agency coordination.  
46.      The authorities have strengthened the insolvency regime in recent years, but 
additional improvements will be needed to ensure timely recovery for creditors while 
ensuring fair and orderly resolutions. The specialized judicial and administrative architecture for 
corporate bankruptcy has improved remarkably in the last decade, facilitating a rapid increase in 
informal restructuring and liquidations, albeit largely for private firms (and since the property 
downturn, largely for non-property private firms). Improved frameworks are needed to tackle 
increased debt repayment difficulties among smaller firms and household entrepreneurs. Key 
priorities in this area should include:  
• 
Modernization of the Enterprise Bankruptcy Law, in particular to improve the effectiveness of 
reorganization and better facilitate hybrid restructuring techniques, which can help speed up 
insolvency proceedings and lead to higher recoveries for creditors. In addition, a special 
insolvency process for small businesses should be established.  
• 
Introduction of a nationwide legal framework for personal insolvency, with features designed for 
individual entrepreneurs, to help facilitate the orderly resolution of financial stress of insolvent 
individuals.  
47.      China should continue strengthening the effectiveness of the Anti-Money 
Laundering/Countering the Financing of Terrorism (AML/CFT) framework. The focus on risk-
based supervision of the banking sector should continue, and the authorities should step up efforts 
to ensure that AML/CFT supervisors are adequately involved in fit and proper decision-making to 
prevent criminals from owning and controlling financial institutions. Given the prominence of digital 
payment platforms in China, the authorities should continue efforts to ensure robust supervision of 
the sector and conduct inspections to verify the effective remediation of recently identified AML/CFT 
systems and control deficiencies. While some progress has been made to update the legal 
framework for beneficial ownership, concrete steps are needed to fully operationalize an effective 
beneficial ownership system, so that competent authorities and institutions have timely access to the 
needed information. Continued efforts are required to establish general legal requirements to 
implement targeted financial sanctions (TFS) and to prohibit legal persons and entities from making 
funds available to designated entities, and the amendments to the AML law should be promptly 
finalized. Efforts to prevent and detect illegal cross-border payment and remittance activities should 
continue, and while the use of crypto assets is prohibited in China, ongoing efforts to monitor and 
investigate its illicit cross-border use is required. 


PEOPLE’S REPUBLIC OF CHINA 
INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND 29 
Authorities’ Views 
48.      The authorities considered financial stability risks to have declined since the last 
Consultation due to reduced risks after the recent property market measures and improved 
local government finances. They considered the recently announced property market measures to 
be effective in providing strong support for the housing market and boosting homebuyer 
confidence. As such, they deemed the risk to the financial system from the property sector to be 
manageable, and the prospects of further house price declines as limited. The authorities also 
argued that the refinancing of high-risk LGFV debt has mitigated the credit risk arising from LGFVs 
as illustrated by a decline in their funding costs. Risks at the small and medium banks have reduced 
given the improvement in the property and LGFV sectors. 
49.      The authorities broadly agreed with staff about the need to contain systemic financial 
risk and improve the crisis management and bank resolution frameworks. They emphasized 
that risk prevention and control are the key priorities as highlighted in the CFWC. They noted that 
the introduction of the Financial Stability Law will help strengthen the legal framework and 
institutional arrangements to prevent and resolve systemic financial risks, including strengthening 
coordination mechanisms among relevant agencies and improving the market-oriented and legal 
resolution mechanism. Tackling illegal financial activities and emerging risks from new technology 
will also be a priority. 
C.   Improving the Monetary Policy Framework 
50.      The PBC has made some progress in improving the monetary policy framework. The 
authorities have stepped up liquidity management operations in recent years to address volatility in 
core interbank funding rates. Most notably, the PBC has signaled its support for allowing aggregate 
credit growth to slow as demand from the property and LGFV sectors wanes relative to past years.  
51.      However, the authorities have been employing multiple tools aimed at achieving 
various, sometime inconsistent, policy objectives. The PBC pursues multiple objectives including 
price stability, exchange rate stability, financial stability, strong growth, and industry support. 
Furthermore, it continues to use a combination of interest-rate and quantity-based tools to conduct 
monetary policy. In this context, setting and communicating the monetary policy stance can be 
challenging, with the interest rate and quantity-based instruments potentially being inconsistent 
with each other, and at times pulling in opposite directions. For example, during the current easing 
cycle, banks’ pursuit of credit growth targets appears to have led to deposit competition at banks, 
resulting in an asymmetric impact of policy rate cuts on deposit and lending rates. This has further 
narrowed banks’ net interest margins, thereby weakening lending ability and weakening financial 
stability.  


PEOPLE’S REPUBLIC OF CHINA 
30 
INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND 
52.      Framework reforms can increase monetary policy space, improve transmission, and 
allow for more effective countercyclical monetary policy. The PBC should predominantly use 
interest rate-based tools, gradually phasing out the use of quantity and sector-specific policies. Such 
a framework would facilitate clear communication of the monetary policy stance. Furthermore, it 
would improve the efficacy of monetary policy and its ability to manage the business cycle as 
interest rate-based tools have stronger transmission to investment and consumption, and they avoid 
the pitfalls of credit misallocation that is associated with quantity-based tools (see 2022 SIP). 
Additionally, phasing out deposit and lending rate guidance, removing credit growth targets, further 
lowering the cost of mortgage refinancing, and a more flexible exchange rate regime could further 
strengthen the effectiveness of monetary transmission. Implementing these changes would not only 
simplify China’s monetary policy framework but also enhance its responsiveness to economic 
fluctuations. 
Authorities’ Views 
53.      The authorities consider monetary policy to be generally effective, with all tools used 
in a coordinated and effective manner. They highlighted the merit of using both quantity- and 
price-based tools, enabling monetary policy to adjust flexibly to changes in economic and financial 
conditions. On interest rate policy, the authorities noted plans to continue to advance market-based 
reforms, improve the transmission of market-based interest rates, and refine the loan market quoted 
interest rates (LPR) mechanism. On structural credit policies, institutions are guided to meet the 
financing needs of the real economy, with incentive mechanisms guiding commercial banks to carry 
out market-oriented decisions and assume risks when issuing loans.   
REIGNITING GROWTH, ENSURING SUSTAINABILITY 
Structural reforms should address headwinds to growth from slowing productivity and demographic 
changes, and reduce underlying imbalances. A key priority is to reduce high household savings and 
rebalance the economy towards consumption by strengthening the social safety net. Scaling back 
distortive supply-side policies, including industrial policy measures to support specific manufacturing 
sectors, would also support rebalancing and more efficient resource allocation, while mitigating the risk 
of generating overcapacity amid weak domestic demand, including resulting from the property sector 
correction. This, together with other important reforms, would also support the transition to green and 
sustainable growth in line with China’s climate commitments. 
A.   Boosting Medium-Term Growth and Rebalancing the Sources of Growth 
54.      After decades of overperformance, growth in China is expected to slow significantly. 
Since the 1990s, exceptionally high investment enabled the growth of the manufacturing sector, with 
rising output in part absorbed by external demand as China opened up to international trade. High 
investment in infrastructure and residential real estate supported growth in the 2010s. However, the 


PEOPLE’S REPUBLIC OF CHINA 
INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND 31 
projected decline in fundamental demand for new housing (IMF, 2023) and declining productivity of 
infrastructure investment limit the role of these sectors in sustaining growth going forward. 
Moreover, as China has become the second largest economy in the world, it will be harder for the 
manufacturing sector to rely primarily on external demand, particularly in an environment of 
intensifying fragmentation pressures.  
55.      The authorities aim to counter headwinds to growth by promoting “new productive 
forces.” The 2024 GWR appropriately highlights the need to raise productivity growth, including 
through pro-market reforms and improvements to the business environment. However, the focus 
remains on supply-side policies, notably industrial policies to support manufacturing broadly and 
emerging sectors such as electric vehicles (EVs), green technologies, and semiconductors. While 
these sectors can support growth, they are unlikely to replace the drag from the property sector (see 
Box 5). A more balanced policy approach, which moves away from excessive investment and puts 
greater focus on consumption, is needed. Undertaking comprehensive pro-market structural reforms 
to boost falling productivity growth and mitigate the drag from a declining labor force would 
promote sustainable growth.  
A Services-Led Growth Model 
56.      The service sector is an underexploited growth driver. While the share of services in 
China’s value-added has increased significantly in recent years, at about 50 percent it is well below 
the advanced economy average of about 75 percent, suggesting significant scope for expansion. 
Firm level data indicates that allocative efficiency is, on average, lower in the service sector and has 
deteriorated in recent years, highlighting the scope for significant productivity gains if pro-market 
reforms are implemented. Furthermore, as many market-based service subsectors have productivity 
levels and growth rates that are comparable to manufacturing subsectors, the reallocation of 
resources to services has contributed positively to aggregate productivity over the last 20 years, and 
can continue doing so in the future.

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND 
57.      Reforms that promote a rebalancing of demand towards consumption and the 
opening-up of the service sector can promote sustainable growth and create jobs. Given its 
high labor intensity, expansion of the service sector can help reduce unemployment, especially youth 
unemployment as young workers are disproportionately employed in some service subsectors such 
as IT and education. Furthermore, as the service sector is less emissions-intensive, expanding 
services would also help China reach its climate goals. Key reform priorities include:  
• 
Rebalancing the economy and strengthening demand for services: With economic development, 
the service sector will continue to grow. However, improving social safety nets and a more 
progressive tax system would reduce the need for precautionary savings, thereby strengthening 
domestic demand, including for services. Additional increases in the coverage and generosity of 
unemployment and medical benefits would further boost consumption. In this context, the 
increase in old age benefits by 19 percent for rural and non-working urban residents introduced 
this year is a welcome step, though only represents an increase in transfers of about 0.02 percent 
of GDP. Accelerating Hukou reforms, as indicated in the 2024 Government Work Report, and 
unification of the social security system, would additionally help raise consumption among 
lower-income groups.   
• 
Improving service sector productivity: Services trade in China remains constrained compared to 
OECD countries, with many sectors facing restrictions on domestic and foreign entry and 
significant regulatory hurdles. Reforms that lighten regulatory requirements, further reduce local 
protectionism, and allow greater firm entry and competition in the services sector, including 
reduced trade and foreign entry restrictions, can boost productivity and support growth.

Scaling Back Industrial Policies 
58.      Excessive use of industrial policies comes with significant economic costs and risks. 
China has a long history of state intervention and 
provides wide-ranging support to “priority” 
sectors, including policies such as preferential 
access to credit, direct subsidies, research funding, 
collaboration with state entities, innovation tax 
breaks, and incentives for strategic manufacturing, 
science and technology firms. Extensive use of 
such policies can have several undesirable side 
effects, notably resource misallocation, less 
productive investment, and increased asset quality 
risks in the financial sector given the reliance on 
debt. Recently, these policies, including via strong 
directed credit growth to manufacturing, have contributed to steady growth in China’s industrial 
production and reduced capacity utilization amid weak domestic demand and the property sector 
correction. Externally, the combination of continued distortive supply-side support and limited policy 
efforts to boost domestic demand raises concerns in trading partners about international spillovers 
from potential overcapacity and excessive reliance on exports to drive growth (see section below).  
59.      Scaling back industrial policies, combined with other complementary reforms, would 
benefit China through more efficient resource allocation. Industrial policies should be used only 
in the presence of well-defined market failures, and to be effective should be well-targeted, time-
bound, cost-effective, and transparent.9 Policies to rebalance the economy towards consumption 
and services can reduce potential demand-supply mismatch in manufacturing. Furthermore, 
fostering greater firm entry and exit by strengthening insolvency frameworks would not only 
improve business dynamism (Cerdeiro and Ruane, 2022, Armour and Cumming, 2008), but can also 
facilitate the market-based resolution of unviable firms and help curb overcapacity in some sectors.10 
Other Reform Priorities 
60.      Other structural reforms can also help boost productivity growth and mitigate the 
negative economic effects from aging. Key priorities include:  
• 
Implementing SOE reforms: Empirical estimates suggest that private firms are about 3-4 percent 
more productive than SOEs (see SIP, IMF, 2020). Eliminating SOE cost advantages and

preferential access to credit, and improving transparency and SOE governance, would foster 
competitive neutrality between SOEs and privately-owned enterprises, and help close the 
productivity gap between them.  
• 
Improving regulatory certainty: Elevated policy uncertainty and regulatory crackdowns have 
impinged upon private investment, including FDI (see SIP). Providing greater regulatory certainty 
can help improve business confidence and the investment climate. 
• 
Promoting R&D and innovation: There is significant scope to enhance the effectiveness of the 
innovation policy toolkit (see Box 6). Model based analysis and international experience suggests 
scope for scaling back the degree of sectoral targeting of innovation policies, and relying more 
on direct tools (e.g., public spending on fundamental research, R&D tax credits) rather than 
indirect tools (e.g., credit allocations, subsidizing production or demand). 
• 
Seizing the opportunities from Artificial Intelligence (AI): China is at the forefront of emerging 
economies in terms of AI preparedness, with well-developed digital infrastructure providing a 
head start. Establishing a robust AI regulatory framework, strengthening economic ties with 
other innovative countries, and upgrading the social protection system to cushion labor 
displacement (IMF 2024b) can help China exploit the opportunities from AI while mitigating risks. 
• 
Implementing pension reforms: Gradually increasing the retirement age to 65 for both men and 
women (from 60 and 50-55, respectively) would help slow the decline in the labor force (IMF, 
2021) and could support rebalancing towards consumption via lower savings rates.  
• 
Strengthening labor market policies: Policies should increase the responsiveness of the education 
system to skills demand and boost human capital. Job search-and-matching assistance, 
retraining programs, and expanded employment services, including for recent graduates, could 
help tackle weakness in the labor market, especially for the youth. Accelerating Hukou reform 
would allow greater labor mobility and increase labor market flexibility. 
Authorities’ Views 
61.      The authorities highlighted the growing share of the service sector in the economy and 
the significant increase in the contribution of consumption to GDP growth in 2023. They 
concurred that consumption and services would continue to contribute positively to future economic 
growth. They emphasized the equipment upgrade and consumer goods trade-in program as 
measures that will effectively boost consumption of electronic equipment, new electric vehicles, and 
household appliances. They noted that many barriers to entry in the service sector have been lifted 
and that private owned companies dominate in many service subsectors. They reported rapid 
increase in service sector trade over the past decade, indicating substantial progress in opening the 
service sector to global competition. 


PEOPLE’S REPUBLIC OF CHINA 
INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND 35 
62.      The authorities emphasized their commitment to boosting productivity, with a focus 
on priority and future-oriented sectors. They emphasized plans to support six future-oriented 
sectors as a way of elevating China’s innovation capacity (manufacturing, information, materials, 
energy, space, and health). They reported active implementation of the Anti-Monopoly Law and 
introduction of the Regulations on Fair Competition Review to assist with enforcement of fair market 
competition, removing local protectionism and accelerating the construction of a unified national 
market. They emphasized equal treatment of all enterprises irrespective of ownership. They 
highlighted ongoing improvements in SOE governance and implementation of climate policies by 
SOEs. They also stressed their commitment to continue pursuing policies to support upskilling, 
facilitate reemployment, and improve job search and matching of new graduates. 
B.   Fostering the Transition to a Green and Sustainable Economy 
63.      China has made welcome progress towards meeting its climate goals, including 
through concerted policy effort. China is on track to peak carbon emissions before 2030, with 
renewable energy developments playing a key role in containing emissions growth, and climate 
targets being developed at all levels of government, including SOEs. China is now the biggest 
deployer of renewable energy in the world, accounting for over half of all new renewable capacity 
worldwide (IEA 2023), and has consistently surpassed its renewable capacity targets in recent Five-
year plans. Given the success in renewables deployment, the authorities have appropriately moved 
towards greater focus on electricity consumption targets. However, there are concerns about China’s 
continued construction of new coal power plants, which aim to maintain grid stability, allow better 
integration of renewables, and also seek to ensure energy security. 
64.      China’s emission trading system (ETS) is a key pillar of its climate policy, and further 
reforms can help achieve emissions goals more efficiently while limiting adverse distributional 
effects. China’s intensity-based ETS (IB-ETS) is currently the single largest climate policy instrument 
in the world. However, the current ETS has important limitations that could be addressed through 
reforms (see SIP).  
• 
Coverage: China’s ETS only applies to the 
power sector, covering 44 percent of emissions. 
Plans to extend the IB-ETS to industrial firms, 
which would extend coverage to 80 percent of 
emissions, should be implemented as soon as 
possible. Such reforms would help China reach 
its climate goals with lower overall cost, and 
with smaller increases in electricity prices. 
• 
Raise revenues: The current intensity-based ETS

instead it could be used to raise fiscal revenue. Modelling results suggest that partial auctioning 
of permits could cumulatively raise up to 3.3 percent of GDP in revenues through 2035, which 
can be used to provide transfers to low-income households, reversing the regressivity of climate 
mitigation policy.   
• 
Transition to a quantity-based ETS (QB-ETS): The current ETS prioritizes efficiency improvements 
of existing fossil fuel power plants, which can be more expensive than incentivizing the reduction 
of the overall quantity of emissions. Starting with increasing the share of auctioned permits and 
tightening benchmarks, China should consider eventually transitioning to a quantity-based ETS 
over the medium term, which would include a cap on total economy-wide emissions. Such a 
system would provide incentives to limit both the emissions intensity and the quantity of 
electricity produced by fossil fuel power plants, thereby maximizing social welfare (see SIP, 
Goulder and others, 2022). 
• 
Other energy and power sector reforms: While ensuring energy security, China should balance 
new coal plant permitting—which is meant to manage the variability of electricity demand and 
clean power supply—by increasing retirements of older, less efficient coal power plants. Greater 
transparency about the costs and benefits of new coal-fired power plants, and how these align 
with China’s climate goals, should also be provided. Further accelerating ongoing power sector 
reforms, including moving to a unified national power market, more market-based pricing of 
electricity, greater use of the ultra-high-voltage transmission grid, and expanding energy storage 
solutions, would all support China’s green transition. China should also begin implementation of 
its plan to control methane emissions, and targets to reduce methane emissions should be set. 
Authorities’ Views 
65.      The authorities reported progress with the carbon market and power sector reforms. 
They noted progress in the functioning of the existing ETS, with an increase in trading volume and 
the price of carbon. They reiterated plans to extend the existing intensity-based ETS to the industrial 
sector in the near future. They are exploring the introduction of partial auctioning in accordance with 
existing regulations and acknowledged the merit of introducing a cap on total carbon emissions. 
They emphasized that recently built and permitted coal power plants meet the highest efficiency 
standards, and that old coal power plants are for emergency use only. They argued that new coal 
power plants are needed to ensure energy security, given the current inability to reliably meet 
demand through renewables alone, due to the intermittency problem. They argued that ongoing 
reforms and improvements in the power grid system will allow for better integration of renewables 
and significantly reduce reliance on coal. They noted positive progress with the construction of the 
China Certified Emission Reduction Trading System (CCER), a voluntary carbon market to 
supplement the ETS. National rules for the Administration of Voluntary Greenhouse Gas Emission 
Reduction Trading (Trial) were issued in October 2023, with methodologies for quantifying net 
emission reductions from afforestation, mangrove restoration, grid-connected offshore wind power,

STEPPING UP MULTILATERAL COOPERATION ON 
TRADE, CLIMATE AND DEBT  
China’s constructive role and growing leadership in global debt issues and in promoting the green 
transition are welcome and should continue. Fragmentation pressures are on the rise, fueled by an 
increase in the use of industrial policies globally, and will likely impose significant economic costs. 
Greater international cooperation and transparency will be key to managing fragmentation challenges. 
A. China’s Growing Leadership in Global Climate and Debt Issues 
66.      Meeting the Paris Agreement objectives 
will require greater ambition and continued 
leadership from major global economies, 
including China. If global emissions are not cut by 
25-50 percent below 2019 levels by 2030, this will 
likely put the goal of limiting global warming to 
1.5-20C beyond reach. Given its role as the largest 
emitter, the pace of China’s emissions reductions is 
both crucial in setting standards for other large 
emerging economies as well as pivotal in reaching 
the global emissions peak. The gap between 
current mitigation pledges and the emissions 
reductions needed to limit warming to 1.5-2.00C can be closed equitably, adhering to the principle of 
common but differentiated responsibilities, with manageable costs for China and the global 
economy (Black and others, 2022). China’s continued leadership in supplying the renewable energy 
market and deploying renewable energy technologies worldwide is welcome. While China can help 
achieve the global climate transition at a lower cost, measures to support green technologies should 
minimize trade distortions and avoid measures that discriminate against foreign producers.  
67.      As a major creditor country, China is playing an important and constructive role in 
supporting debt restructuring in low-income and vulnerable countries. China’s critical support 
and partnership in recent and ongoing debt restructurings, including its leadership as co-chair of 
several Official Creditor Committees under the G20 Common Framework is welcome. China is also an 
active participant at the Global Sovereign Debt Roundtable (GSDR), helping advance the mutual 
understanding of key stakeholders on issues relating to the sovereign debt restructuring 
architecture. Continuing progress on the Common Framework and through the GSDR would help 
ensure effective, predictable, and timely debt resolution processes for vulnerable countries.

Authorities’ Views 
68.      The authorities acknowledged China’s important role in the global joint efforts and 
cooperation to address climate change and in supporting debt restructuring in low-income 
and vulnerable countries. The authorities emphasized that the global response to climate change 
should follow the principle of “common but differentiated responsibilities” and expressed 
determination to make continued efforts towards achieving their carbon peak goal before 2030. On 
supporting debt restructuring in low-income and vulnerable countries, they underscored the need for 
continued collaboration across key stakeholders and noted the importance of fair burden sharing. 
B. Containing Geoeconomic Fragmentation Risks 
69.      Geoeconomic fragmentation pressures 
continue to rise globally, with potentially large 
economic costs. Discriminatory policy 
interventions, ranging from domestic industrial 
subsidies11 to direct trade restrictions, are 
becoming more frequent among G20 economies. 
While some interventions may be justified based 
on market failures or national security concerns, 
their proliferation risks triggering retaliatory 
responses by trading partners, fragmenting supply 
chains, and reversing the economic gains from 
globalization and trade seen in the last few decades. Recent data for China, the European Union, and 
the United States shows that, on average, there is a 73.8 percent probability that instituting a subsidy 
for a given product by one major economy is met with a subsidy for the same product by another 
major economy within one year.12 If fragmentation pressures continue to build, a significant de-
risking scenario where countries “friend-shore” or “reshore” production can materialize, which will 
have significant global costs, with China particularly impacted (see APD REO).  
70.      China’s use of industrial policies and state interventions is pervasive and lacks 
transparency. China uses various tools to provide support to priority sectors (¶58), and recent high-
level policy announcements suggest that these trends are set to continue, including plans to boost 
self-reliance in science and technology, and upgrade industrial supply chains.13 Lack of transparency 
 
11 Throughout this report, the term subsidies is used as an economic concept (IMF, OECD, World Bank and WTO, 
2022), which may differ from legal interpretations based on WTO law and that can be used in the WTO dispute 
settlement system.

of Chinese IP adds additional challenges, making it difficult to assess their size, impact, and 
effectiveness.14  
71.      Industrial policy actions of China, as well as other major economies, are leading to 
significant international spillovers, while fragmentation pressures are impacting economic 
decisions. Empirical evidence suggests that China’s IP can have significant effects on trade flows, 
including through input-output linkages. Exports of sectors that directly receive support from 
subsidies expand over time, as do exports of downstream sectors, relative to sectors that do not 
receive such support. Domestic subsidies are also associated with lower imports, including for 
downstream sectors, suggesting import substitution effects from China’s IP (see Box 7). 
Geoeconomic fragmentation pressures and rising geopolitical risks are also impacting trade and FDI 
flows in and out of China (see SIP).  
 
 
72.      Scaling back China’s IP and improving transparency with respect to government 
support would help potentially diffuse fragmentation pressures, while also containing 
domestic distortionary effects. IP should be pursued cautiously and only in cases where there are 
well-defined market failures, and should minimize trade and investment distortions. Extensive use 
risks generating negative spillovers for trading partners, in addition to domestic resource 
misallocation. 15 Furthermore, improving transparency around China’s state support, including from 
LGs, is essential to better assess the costs and benefits of the policies and potential international 
spillovers. Export and technology restrictions on critical minerals risk disrupting key supply chains 
needed for a green transition.  
 
14 DiPippo and others, 2022 point out that unlike other economies, China does not publish detailed budgetary 
expenditures, estimates of fiscal expenditures by type, and amounts allocated to subsidy programs, including those 
notified to the World Trade Organization.

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND 
73.      In the face of these pressures, China should continue its efforts to strengthen the 
multilateral system, especially the WTO. China has a key leadership role at the WTO and, in this 
regard, its work to advance plurilateral initiatives, including the successful conclusion of the joint 
statement initiative on services domestic regulation at MC-13, is welcome. At the same time, China’s 
support for the multilateral trading system could be bolstered by ensuring compliance with WTO 
notification obligations and demonstrating its commitment to open trade through its own domestic 
policies. This includes further opening up domestic markets, particularly in the areas of investment 
and services, and deepening state-owned enterprise reform. China also continues to take steps to 
increase trade integration, including through its application to the Comprehensive and Progressive 
Agreement for Trans-Pacific Partnership (CPTPP). Adopting the high-standard provisions of the 
CPTPP can facilitate China’s economic and trade integration. 
Authorities’ Views 
74.      Against the backdrop of a challenging global environment and growing risks of 
fragmentation, the authorities expressed their support for the WTO and the multilateral 
trading system. They remain concerned about rising protectionism and its impacts on global trade 
and stressed their commitment to globalization. They reiterated that export controls on certain 
critical minerals are in line with the practices of other WTO members and were imposed to safeguard 
national security, noting also that exports of these items have generally remained stable since the 
measures were introduced. On industrial policy, they disagreed with the notion that subsidies are 
contributing to the competitiveness of Chinese industries, and attributed their success to their 
innovativeness and strong manufacturing synergies. In their view, overcapacity as a concept is not 
applicable to a global setting that is organized according to comparative advantage and market 
principles of supply and demand. They see China as having developed a comparative advantage, 
particularly in the green sector, which will be critical for facilitating the green transition globally. The 
authorities emphasized the importance of WTO reform, noting that restoring an effective WTO 
dispute settlement system is a priority. The authorities reiterated their goal, as stated in this year’s 
Government Work Report, of seeking to deepen multilateral, bilateral and regional economic 
cooperation and negotiate and sign high-standard free trade agreements with more countries and 
regions. They propose to do so through advancing negotiations on several ongoing FTAs and 
through continued efforts to accede to the CPTPP and DEPA. 
IMPROVING ECONOMIC DATA 
75.      While broadly adequate for surveillance, data provided to the Fund has some 
shortcomings. Significant data gaps remain in key areas (see Annex VI). Long-standing data gaps 
include quarterly GDP by expenditure component (nominal, real, and seasonally adjusted); general 
government data with a breakdown of expenditure by economic type (current and capital 
expenditure); and data on off-budget entities (including LGFVs) that meet the statistical criteria for 
inclusion within the perimeter of the general government. China's balance of payments data does 


PEOPLE’S REPUBLIC OF CHINA 
INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND 41 
not provide the institutional sector breakdown for the financial account, or the breakdown for 
investment income as required by the sixth edition of the Balance of Payments Manual. China’s 
support for the Review of Data Provision to the Fund for Surveillance Purposes that includes 
provision of foreign exchange intervention (FXI) data is welcome (IMF, 2024). Greater transparency 
on FXI would facilitate multilateral surveillance through more comprehensive monitoring of the 
international monetary system. Enhanced data sharing and standardization of data on critical 
minerals are also needed, especially to support a better understanding of the effect of trade policies 
on green investment. 
Authorities’ Views 
76.      The authorities reiterated their commitment to improve data quality but raised 
significant concerns about the new Data Adequacy Assessment (DAA) framework. They 
disagreed with the rating for national accounts, arguing that adequate data is provided for 
production-side GDP, which is the appropriate primary approach for measuring economic activity in 
China. They also indicated that the coverage of CPI and PPI is adequate. The authorities disagreed 
with the GFS ratings, noting that they abide by the Budget Law—debt not included in the budget is 
not considered government debt and the GG budget is compiled according to the functional 
classification of expenditure. They also argued that delays in publication of LG budget data are due 
to the needed approval of the local people’s congress. However, they committed to continue 
upgrading GFS data adequacy, including through collaboration with the Fund. For external sector 
statistics, they will consider steps to disseminate breakdowns for investment income and institutional 
sectors. 
STAFF APPRAISAL 
77.      China’s economy is projected to grow in line with the authorities’ target in 2024, 
before slowing in the medium term. The resilient growth in 2024 reflects strong public investment 
and continued recovery in private consumption, which will offset the ongoing drag from declining 
residential investment. Economic slack will decrease further, with inflation picking up gradually. 
Without structural reforms, growth is projected to decelerate materially in the medium term because 
of population aging and slower productivity growth. The external position in 2023 is assessed to be 
broadly in line with the level implied by medium-term fundamentals and desirable policies. 
78.      Risks to growth and inflation are tilted to the downside. The property market correction 
could be longer- or larger-than-expected and could trigger renewed LG financing strains and 
unintended fiscal tightening. The weaker-than-expected domestic demand amid high debt levels 
could also result in prolonged downward price pressures and increased risks of adverse macro-
financial feedback loops. On the external front, deepening geoeconomic fragmentation remains a 
key risk. Upside risks include decisive policy actions to address the property sector distress and 
market-oriented structural reforms.  


PEOPLE’S REPUBLIC OF CHINA 
42 
INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND 
79.      A comprehensive CG-coordinated policy package to facilitate a more efficient and less 
costly transition of the property sector is a priority. The package should accelerate the resolution 
of insolvent developers and deploy one-off CG financing to protect buyers of pre-sold but yet 
unfinished housing, which would raise consumer confidence and boost near-term economic 
prospects. Greater housing price flexibility, especially in the primary market, while monitoring and 
mitigating potential macro-financial spillovers, would also support housing demand and the clearing 
of the inventory overhang.  
80.      Near-term macroeconomic policies should support domestic demand amid economic 
slack and elevated downside risks. A neutral structural fiscal stance in 2024 would balance the 
tradeoffs between supporting domestic demand, defusing deflation risks, and containing 
unfavorable debt dynamics. The structural fiscal deficit should start declining gradually in 2025, with 
a pace dependent on the strength of the recovery, inflation developments, and the property market 
outlook. Additional monetary easing via interest rates would support demand and lift inflation, while 
greater exchange rate flexibility would help absorb external shocks and mitigate deflation risks.  
81.      Public debt sustainability will require significant consolidation in the medium term, 
supported by framework reforms and restructuring of unsustainable LGFV debt. Sustained 
fiscal consolidation, achieved through a reduction of off-budget investment and wide-ranging tax 
and social security reforms, is needed to stabilize public debt over the longer term. Fiscal 
consolidation should be supported by fiscal framework reforms, including improving fiscal 
monitoring of LG finances, reducing vertical fiscal imbalances, and establishing and enforcing LG 
fiscal rules to ensure fiscal discipline also at the local level. Restructuring the debt of unsustainable 
LGFVs through greater use of insolvency frameworks will also help reduce LG fiscal strains. 
82.      Financial sector policies should mitigate asset quality risks and safeguard macro-
financial stability. Financial stability risks remain elevated as continued stress in the property sector 
and weak debt servicing capacity of LGFVs point to high credit risks, at a time when profitability 
pressures limit financial institutions’ ability to build buffers. To contain asset quality risks, the 
authorities should remove forbearance and strictly enforce prudential policies, while also 
preemptively identifying vulnerabilities and preparing for any adverse impact that unduly impedes 
banks’ lending capacity. A comprehensive strategy to strengthen weak small and medium banks is 
also needed to maintain financial stability. Strengthening the crisis management and bank resolution 
frameworks and upgrading and enhancing systemic risk oversight will be essential to tackle legacy 
vulnerabilities and prevent the build-up of new risks.  
83.      Broad-based structural reforms should promote economic rebalancing and high-
quality growth. The service sector has the potential to drive growth and create jobs if measures 
that promote a rebalancing of demand towards consumption, such as boosting the social safety net 
and improving the progressivity of the tax system, are combined with reforms that reduce entry and 
regulatory barriers in service sectors. Scaling back industrial policies which favor manufacturing 


PEOPLE’S REPUBLIC OF CHINA 
INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND 43 
sectors can also help reduce domestic resource misallocation, while also mitigating asset quality 
risks. Other key reform priorities include implementing SOE reforms, gradually increasing the 
retirement age, and strengthening labor market policies.  
84.      Further reforms would help China meet its emissions reduction goals more efficiently. 
China has made welcome progress towards meeting its climate targets. Expanding the coverage of 
the emissions trading scheme beyond the power sector can help deliver the same reduction in 
emissions at a lower overall cost and smaller increases in electricity prices, while auctioning permits 
would raise revenue to compensate for adverse distributional effects.  
85.      Reducing fragmentation pressures will require a global push to strengthen the 
multilateral trading system as well as policy effort by major economies, including China. 
Industrial policies and trade restrictions by China and other major economies are leading to 
significant international spillovers. In addition to containing domestic distortionary effects, scaling 
back China’s industrial policies and improving transparency with respect to government support 
could potentially help defuse fragmentation pressures. China should also continue its efforts to 
strengthen the rules-based multilateral trading system, especially through reforms of the WTO.  
86.      China’s growing leadership in addressing global challenges is welcome. As a major 
creditor country, China plays an important and constructive role in supporting debt restructuring in 
vulnerable countries. Continued progress on the Common Framework and through the GSDR would 
help ensure effective, predictable, and timely debt resolution processes. Meeting the Paris 
Agreement objectives will require global cooperation, including to support much needed renewables 
and green investments. China’s continued efforts in this area remains vital. 
87.      China should address remaining data gaps. While broadly adequate for surveillance, data 
provided to the Fund has some shortcomings. Addressing significant data gaps in key areas would 
further enhance transparency and support policy making. 
88.      It is proposed that the next Article IV consultation with China take place on the 
standard 12-month cycle.

Box 1. Inflation at Risk1 
This Box examines China’s deflation risks with a novel deflation vulnerability index (DVI). Analysis suggests that 
risks under the baseline are limited, but negative shocks could substantially increase the tail risk of deflation.  
To assess deflation risks, a deflation vulnerability index has been developed. The index is based on five 
categories of variables that can predict downside risks to 
inflation, including commodity prices, output gaps, financial 
asset prices, exchange rates, and inflation expectations, 
similar to IMF (2003). The information content of these 
variables is summarized into a single variable—the deflation 
vulnerability index—using principal component analysis. 
The calculated DVI, which shows persistent negative values 
in recent years, suggests that China is currently 
experiencing its longest recorded period of deflationary 
pressure. This was initially driven by falling asset prices at 
the start of the property market downturn in late 2021, and 
increasingly by negative output gaps in 2022 and 2023 (see 
text chart and SIP). 
Regression analysis implies significant downside risks to 
future inflation in China. A negative shock to the DVI is 
associated with about 1.1 percentage points lower core 
inflation at the 10th percentile of the inflation distribution. 
This is substantially larger than the -0.6 percentage point 
impact at the 50th percentile. A more negative estimated 
impact at the 10th percentile than at the median of the 
distribution indicates larger downside risks from negative 
shocks. Further analysis indicates that negative output gaps 
and weak inflation expectations are the key components of 
DVI that drive the downside risk of core inflation below zero 
(i.e., deflation) in China. 
The probability of deflation in China is estimated at 
around 7 percent in the baseline but could be as large 
as 27 (54) percent 9 months after a one (two) standard 
deviation negative shock to DVI. Policy makers should 
guard against deflation risks getting entrenched. This would 
require addressing stress in the property market and 
reviving domestic demand. PBoC should maintain 
accommodative monetary policy and strengthen deflation 
risk monitoring, focusing on downside risks and the role of 
inflation expectations.

Box 2. Downside Scenario of Prolonged Deflation, Fragmentation and Spillovers1 
A downside scenario of prolonged deflation would lower growth and worsen debt dynamics in China. This 
could generate significant global spillovers, adding to deflationary pressures.  
A negative domestic demand shock amid high debt levels could trigger a period of sustained 
deflation in China, with large economic costs. Core 
inflation is on a downward trend with a sizeable risk of 
deflation if negative shocks materialize (Box 1). 
Following a 2 standard deviation shock to China’s 
deflation vulnerability index, core inflation could fall as 
low as -0.1 percent. In a downside scenario of 
prolonged deflation, where -0.1 percent core inflation 
persists for 5 years, cumulative real GDP in 2029 is 
projected to be about 5.4 percent lower, and debt-to-
GDP about 11.7 percentage points higher, than in the 
baseline.2 In the absence of a policy response, 
deflation would weigh on growth through weak 
consumer and investor confidence, subdued inflation 
expectations and deleveraging. Continued focus on supply-side measures, including provision of subsidies 
(Ruta and Rotunno, 2024) and investment incentives in priority manufacturing sectors, amid weak domestic 
demand could further add to deflationary pressures.   
Additional trade restrictions from some trading partners could further exacerbate domestic 
deflationary pressures. Fragmentation is already materializing, changing China’s export markets (Gopinath, 
2024). Fragmentation pressures could also be intensified if household savings further increase, including due 
to a longer-than-expected property contraction, resulting in higher current account surpluses in China. If 
geoeconomic fragmentation deepens, China’s ability to export to some major trading partners would be 
reduced, exacerbating domestic deflationary pressures, particularly in sectors targeted by trade restrictions.  
 In a downside scenario of sustained deflation in China, spillovers would include lower inflation and 
growth in trading partners.  Lower growth in China 
could contribute to lower growth in partner countries, 
especially ASEAN countries where model estimates 
suggest a 0.2 percentage point decline in growth for 
every percentage point decline in Chinese growth 
(IMF, 2023).  Deflation in China would also reduce 
inflation in trading partners. At the current juncture, 
this would support disinflation efforts in countries 
fighting high inflation and would reduce the burden 
on monetary policy. Estimates suggest that for every 
percentage point decline in Chinese export price 
inflation, Asia’s import prices fall by about 0.6 
percentage points 10 months after the shock.

2 The downside scenario is calibrated using the relationship between quarterly real GDP growth rate and core inflation 
from Japan (1980Q1-2023Q4). Such a calibration suggests a 0.5 percentage points cumulative decline on annual real GDP 
growth following a 1 percentage point reduction in core inflation, which is used to project cumulative 5-year impact on 
real GDP in China. Lower inflation is assumed to gradually lower the nominal interest rate, while primary balances are 
kept fixed.

Box 3. Can Consolidation Help Address Vulnerabilities in Small and Medium-sized Banks?1 
Well-designed and targeted consolidation that is accompanied by balance sheet cleanup and adequate 
recapitalization could help address vulnerabilities in small and medium-sized banks (SMBs). Indeed 
consolidation should take place as part of a broader strategy to address weakness in SMBs (¶31) and accelerate 
financial sector reforms to improve the financial system’s resilience (see section above). 
SMBs are a key pillar of the Chinese banking system, with nearly 4000 institutions holding 25 percent 
of total system assets. Over the last decade, the number of SMBs remained largely unchanged, in contrast 
to continued consolidation in other countries. Bank presence is particularly high in poorer regions (see ¶12), 
partly reflecting previous efforts in deepening financial 
inclusion. As most SMBs operate within their region, 
this has created fierce competition for lending and 
deposits from a limited clientele. SME banks also face 
competition from larger banks and NBFIs, further 
eroding their pricing power, which induces excessive 
risk-taking behavior and concentrated risk exposures. 
Risk management and governance are weak and the 
large number of SMBs imposes on already constrained 
regulatory and supervisory capacity. As a result, SMBs 
have significantly weaker fundamentals than larger 
banks, and their vulnerabilities could have significant 
negative macro-financial impact on the local/regional 
economy.  
After some regional bank failures in 2020, the authorities stepped up efforts to address SMBs 
vulnerabilities. These include recapitalization, heightened supervision and selected mergers including 
several cases in 2023., The authorities are considering broader consolidation for SMBs.  
Well-designed and targeted, consolidation among SMBs could improve performance and reduce 
financial stability risks. Consolidation among smaller institutions can potentially help unlock synergies and 
economies of scale that supports profitability, capital accretion and system resiliencey.2 Given SMBs’ low 
pricing power, consolidation would not give rise to local monopolies and their overall small size prevents the 
emergence of too-big-to-fail problems. Moreover, consolidation can improve risk management and 
governance by centralizing resources, in turn alleviating regulatory burden.  
The authorities should prioritize balance sheet clean-up, recapitalization, and resolution of unviable 
banks to minimize restructuring costs. Simply merging weak banks into a larger weak bank, or relying on 
stronger banks to absorb the weak institution, should be avoided. Adequate bad debt disposal reduces the 
initial recapitalization need while minimizing the future credit costs for the merged entity. Sufficient 
recapitalization helps lower the funding costs for the merged entities and provides capacity for growth. The 
consolidation should aim to generate synergy and unviable banks should be liquidated with proper 
safeguards to protect depositor interest, which would lower the total restructuring costs. Encouraging 
market-based voluntary M&A could also help to alleviate constraint on public resources. For instance, the 
consolidation in the US banking system after the Global Financial Crisis was primarily driven by voluntary 
M&A while resolution of over 500 banks contributed a quarter of the consolidation by 2015. Lastly, installing 
strong governance and management structures at the merged entity would ensure sustainable resilience 
going forward.

Box 4. International Experience with Subnational Fiscal Rules1 
International experience suggests that well designed and strictly enforced subnational fiscal rules can play an 
important role in controlling LG fiscal risks in China. 
Sustained fiscal consolidation in China will require strict controls over LG finances. Much of the build-
up in GG debt since the GFC has been driven by LG debt accumulation. Furthermore, fiscal deficits remain 
large at the LG level and better control of LG borrowing will be essential to ensure fiscal sustainability. 
Various rules-based constraints for sub-national governments have been used by advanced and 
emerging market economies to control fiscal risks. Subnational fiscal rules are numerical constraints that 
apply to fiscal aggregates such as debt and budget balance. Compared to direct administrative controls, 
rules-based constraints have the benefit of being objective and transparent (Ter-Minassian and Craig, 1997), 
and easy to communicate and monitor. Rules defined ex-ante, often in primary or secondary legislation, can 
promote accountability by providing a benchmark for ex post performance assessment, and can also have a 
signaling effect on financial markets. Most OECD countries use one or more rules-based constraint (OECD 
2021), though the design of rules can differ considerably across countries: 
• 
Borrowing constraints are typically applied in the form of limits on the stock of debt and/or annual 
debt service payments, generally expressed as 
a share of subnational government revenues. 
Constraints may also be imposed on the 
purpose of borrowing, with many OECD 
countries (e.g., Canada, Denmark, France, 
Germany, Luxembourg, New Zealand, UK) 
limiting subnational borrowing for investment 
purposes only. Several countries do not 
provide CG guarantees for LG borrowing in 
order to foster market discipline.  
• 
Budget balance rules often target current 
balance, leaving room for borrowing for capital expenditure (golden rule). Countries, such as Austria, 
Belgium, and Netherlands, include subnational extrabudgetary funds within the ambit of budget balance 
rules.  
• 
Expenditure limits are relatively less common, used mostly to constrain specific items (e.g., personnel 
expenditure in Brazil and Türkiye), though they can also apply at the aggregate level (Spain) or on 
operating/current expenditure (Mexico). 
To be effective, fiscal rules need to be accompanied by enforcement and oversight mechanisms, and 
robust public financial management systems at the subnational level. Enforcement mechanisms range 
from financial penalties (e.g., reduced access to central funds), to institutional and individual sanctions, and 
include obligations to undertake corrective measures. Compliance with rules is generally centrally 
monitored, typically by the ministry of finance, while some countries have independent fiscal institutions. 
Fiscal transparency is critical in facilitating enforcement. Ability to develop a transparent budget process 
(including a broad coverage of fiscal activity), and comprehensive accounting and reporting systems are 
critical for rules to function effectively.

Box 5. Green Manufacturing as a Potential Driver of Growth1 
As the real estate sector contracts, the electric vehicles and renewable energy sectors have been prioritized as 
potential engines of growth. However, analysis suggests that these sectors alone are unlikely to fully replace 
the expected drag from the property sector. 
The property sector has been an important driver of China’s growth over the last decade and is now 
transitioning to a new equilibrium. The property sector was the single most important driver of China’s 
growth over the past decade, contributing, on average, around 1.3 percentage points to GDP growth 
between 2010 and 2020. However, the property market has been a drag on growth in recent years as the 
sector transitions to a more sustainable and leaner size. 
The green manufacturing sectors, such as new energy vehicles and renewable energy, are considered 
the priority sectors to serve as the new engines of growth. Investment in these sectors has been growing 
rapidly in recent years and the Box considers a scenario of continued ramp up through 2030. 
• 
The share of new energy vehicles in total auto production has increased significantly from 6 percent in 
2020 to 37 percent in 2023. We assume total vehicle production to reach 26 million units by 2030, 
marginally higher than 2023, with 60 percent new energy vehicles, in line with the authorities’ target 
penetration rate. 
• 
Installed capacity of wind and solar increased from 3.1 percent of total generating capacity in 2010 to 36 
percent in 2023. The 2030 target of 1200 GW of wind and solar capacity set out in the 14th Five Year 
Plan is likely to be achieved by the end of 2024. It is assumed that a total of 1800 GW of wind and solar 
capacity will be installed by 2030, making up about 45 percent of total generation capacity. 
Despite the rapid expansion in the green manufacturing sectors, the analysis in this box suggests that 
it is not enough to fully offset the drag from the property sector contraction in the medium term. IMF 
(2023) projects almost flat real estate investment between 2026 and 2030 as the sector completes its 
transition to a smaller size. Compared to the 
high growth of the sector in the 2010s, this 
implies a drag to growth of about -1.3 
percentage points per year. The auto sector is 
unlikely to provide a significant boost to growth 
going forward, as fixed investment in new 
energy vehicles production has already 
expanded significantly, and any further 
expansion is likely to be offset by declines in 
internal combustion vehicles. On the other hand, 
continued rapid growth in the renewable energy 
sector is likely to provide a key positive offset to 
growth as the sector continues to experience 
rapid investment in transition to greener 
electricity generation, together with accelerated grid upgrades and energy storage facilities. However, on 
net, these sectors are projected to offset only about half the drag from the property sector in the medium 
term.

Box 6. Fiscal Policies for Innovation1 
This Box examines the performance of innovation policies in China and provides recommendations to enhance 
their effectiveness based on international experience and model analysis. 
Promoting innovation and high-quality growth are 
central goals of fiscal and industrial policies in 
China. Total research and development (R&D) 
spending has tripled over the past two decades, 
reaching more than 2 percent of GDP by 2021, on par 
with advanced economies. This surge has been fueled 
by a combination of direct incentives to innovation, 
including public R&D and increasingly generous tax 
deductions for firm R&D, as well as more indirect 
instruments such as financing support for innovative 
firms (e.g., via government guided funds), coordination 
of innovation supply chains by public-private consortia, 
and broader production and demand subsidies for 
certain sectors.   
Targeting of specific sectors is a key feature of innovation policy in China. For example, corporate 
income tax rates are substantially lower for high-tech sectors, particularly software and integrated circuits, 
which have also been favored by credit allocation (Xu 2022, World Bank 2023). Innovation inputs have also 
been heavily skewed towards those sectors, with electric and electronic components (which include batteries 
and semiconductors) at the top. Relative to the distribution in China, US innovation has been proportionally 
more tilted towards consumer-oriented sectors like health and entertainment.  
 
 
There is significant scope to enhance the effectiveness of the innovation policy toolkit. Despite the 
government’s efforts to promote innovation, total factor productivity growth has significantly fallen over the 
last decade (SIP 2022), and citations of Chinese patents are on average lower than those of other 
countries—a sign of lower-quality innovation. Analysis based on the April 2024 Fiscal Monitor (IMF 2024c) 
suggests the following recommendations:  
• 
The degree of sectoral targeting should be scaled down. Targeting can have benefits—innovation in some 
sectors (e.g., semiconductors) generate positive productivity and knowledge spillovers to other sectors 
(Liu and Ma 2023), whereas sectors like green energy or electric vehicles help to decarbonize the 
economy. But targeting is also prone to policy mistakes and high fiscal costs. Model analysis (Garcia-

• 
Macia and Sollaci, forthcoming) suggests that the current degree of targeting in China is excessive: the 
optimal distribution of innovation support across sectors would only be a third as concentrated (and 
even less so if the potential for misallocation of support is considered).2.   
• 
Direct fiscal support is preferable to indirect instruments. Based on international evidence, public 
spending on fundamental research and R&D tax credits and grants for firm R&D tend to be more cost-
effective and well-targeted than credit allocation (which can encourage excess leverage), favoring SOEs 
(which tend to be less productive), or subsidizing production and demand (which rewards established 
rather than innovative firms). 
• 
Adequate design and implementation are critical. In terms of design features, grants are most effective 
when directed at earlier stages of the innovation lifecycle, while R&D tax incentives must be made easily 
accessible across firms. Public R&D should focus on fundamental research that is less likely to be carried 
out by firms. In general, effective government support to innovation requires upgrading the public 
sector’s technical capacity, avoiding duplication of efforts (e.g., by LGs), recalibrating programs as 
conditions change, promoting transparency, and acting in line with open and competitive markets.

Box 7. How do China’s Subsidies Affect its Trade Flows?1 
China has used subsidy policies intensively in recent years. Evidence suggests that these policies have 
significant international spillovers, promoting China’s exports and reducing China’s imports, both directly and 
indirectly through input-output linkages. 
As governments intensify their use of industrial policies, the deployment of subsidies increased 
sharply (IMF, OECD, World Bank and WTO, 2022). Data from the Global Trade Alert (GTA) show a marked 
increase in subsidy utilization over the past decade across multiple countries. While information on the 
monetary value of subsidies is missing, the database collects credible policy changes that have occurred 
since 2009.2 China has implemented around 5400 subsidy policies from 2009 to 2022, two thirds of the 
measures adopted by all G20 advanced economies combined.  
 
 
China’s use of subsidies varies across industries, with upstream industries receiving more support. 
Automotive, computing, chemicals, industrial equipment and metals are among the top receivers of 
subsidies. Furthermore, most of these industries are relatively upstream in the supply chain—7 out of the 10 
top receivers of subsidies have an upstream index above average.3  
Empirical evidence suggests that China’s subsidies can create significant trade spillovers, including 
through supply chain linkages. The empirical analysis (conducted at the product and industry levels) 
investigates how China's subsidies affect exports and imports, both directly and through supply chain 
linkages.4  
• 
Direct spillovers: The estimates indicate that after the introduction of a subsidy, China’s exports of 
subsidized products are 1 percent higher than those of non-subsidized products. Imports of subsidized 
products are lower, indicating some domestic substitution.5  
• 
Spillovers through supply chains: Supply chain linkages tend to amplify these impacts. Using aggregated 
data at the industry level and input-output tables to capture linkages, the results highlight a positive 
effect of subsidies given to upstream industries on exports of downstream industries. As an example, 
consider the case of subsidies provided to the steel industry, which is the main suppliers of inputs to the 
automotive industry (10 percent of its total costs). The empirical results imply that increasing subsidies 
to steel by the number observed over 2015-2022 is associated with a 3.5 percent increase in exports of 
autos from China. This effect is consistent with upstream industries expanding supply and lowering their 
prices following the deployment of subsidies, hence permitting industries downstream to become more 
competitive in export markets. Results from imports regressions point to a negative effect of upstream 
subsidies, suggesting that downstream industries also expand domestically and can substitute for

when provided to upstream industries.  
 –––––––––––––––––––– 
1 Prepared by Lorenzo Rotunno and Michele Ruta. 
2 The GTA retrieves information on subsidies and other policies from official documents or reports and articles with a 
clear link to official documents (from firms and governments). While the definition of subsidies adopted in the GTA is 
consistent with an economic concept of subsidies (IMF, OECD, World Bank and WTO, 2022), it may differ from legal 
interpretations based on WTO law and that can be used in the WTO dispute settlement system. 
3 The upstreamness index (Antras et al., 2012) measures the average position of an industry’s output in the value chain. It 
equals the dollar amount by which output of all industries increases as a result of one extra dollar of value added in a 
given industry. Higher values indicate that the industry is more upstream in the value chain.  
4 The empirical analysis builds on a companion paper (Rotunno and Ruta, 2024) that examines trade effects by country 
groupings. Results for G20 emerging markets are further discussed in WEO (2024). 
5 These average direct effects mask important heterogeneity across industries. The positive export effect and the negative 
import effects are most pronounced in the machinery industry, while in other industries like metals subsidies tend to 
decrease both exports and imports. Additional analysis unpacking the impact on trade values into price and quantity 
effects suggests that China’s subsidies have depressed export prices of metal, furniture and auto products, while they are 
associated with higher export prices and quantities in other industries including electrical equipment such as batteries. 
These results are discussed in an accompanying working paper (Rotunno and Ruta, forthcoming).

Figure 2. China: Fiscal—Continued Fiscal Support Amid Rising Debt 
Large fiscal deficits are set to continue into 2024… 
 
…with weak expected tax revenue… 
 
…and public sector demand expanding faster than GDP. 
 
 
 
The fiscal stance is projected as broadly neutral in 2024. 
 
 
Debt keeps rising at a rapid pace, with a growing share of 
official debt. 
 
 
 
Local government revenues shrink further, driven by the 
collapse in land sale revenue.

Figure 3. China: Monetary—Accommodative Policy Stance Amidst Weak Inflation 
Subdued headline inflation largely reflects transitory food 
pressures, while momentum in core inflation has also 
declined. 
 
Producer prices remain in deflationary territory. 
 
  
 
 
The PBC has cut the RRR and the 5-year LPR, which is 
linked to mortgages, to support market liquidity and 
growth… 
 
…and credit policies continue to be accommodative, for 
instance driving still-rapid MSE lending growth. 
 
 
 
 
Money market rates rose at the end of 2023 as banks 
sought to absorb heavy government bond issuance… 
 
…prompting the PBC to step up liquidity injections

Figure 4. China: Credit—Government and Corporate Borrowing Drives Credit Growth 
Total social financing growth continued to slow down, 
driven by slower bank lending, while government 
borrowing provided support. 
 
Despite recent slowing, corporate lending remains the 
dominant driver of bank credit growth… 
 
 
 
 
 
 
…in large part due to continued rapid policy-driven growth 
in lending to MSEs 
 
Household credit continues to remain subdued amid low 
consumer confidence and the property sector downturn 
 
 
 
The negative GDP deflator in 2023 and 2024Q1 has 
pushed debt to GDP well past the COVID-era peak. 
 
 
The government is expected to continue to contribute the 
bulk of new debt growth going forward.

Longer term government bond yields have declined 
sharply amid continuing monetary policy easing and 
rising concerns of deflation risks.  
 
Both central and local government bond issuance 
increased strongly in Q4 amid stronger policy support 
 
 
 
Corporate net issuance recovered somewhat on lower 
funding costs, though issuance by private corporates 
remains limited. 
 
Chinese equities stabilized after significant pressures in 
early 2024 that were followed by state-led interventions.

Note: The color coding is based on the change in each indicator relative to the previous year. Color coding: red if the changes go in the opposite 
direction of rebalancing; yellow if some progress was observed; and green if there was substantial progress in rebalancing. For indicators that are 
ratios, changes are measured in simple differences and are considered substantial if larger than 0.5 percentage points. For indicators that are 
indices and for the credit indicators, changes are measured in annual percent change and are considered substantial if larger than 5 percent. See 
Zhang, L. (2016), "Rebalancing in China—Progress and Prospects,” IMF Working Paper No. 16/183 for the framework.

Appendix I. External Sector Assessment 
Overall Assessment: The external position in 2023 is assessed to be broadly in line with the level implied by medium-term 
fundamentals and desirable policies. The CA surplus declined to 1.4 percent of GDP in 2023 as exports declined on the back of both 
weakness in global demand as well as the unwinding of the COVID-19-related export boom. Rising services imports due to a 
normalization of outbound tourism also contributed to the lower CA surplus. Over the medium term, the CA surplus is projected to 
narrow further and gradually converge to the CA norm, mostly reflecting rising social spending pressures as population ages.  
 
Potential Policy Responses: Policies to ensure that the external position remains broadly in line with fundamentals include (1) 
accelerating market-based structural reforms—a further opening up of domestic markets, ensuring competitive neutrality between 
state-owned and private firms, scaling back wasteful and distorting industrial policies, and increasing reliance on market forces to 
improve resource allocation—to boost potential growth; (2) shifting fiscal policy support toward strengthening social protection to 
reduce high household savings and rebalance toward private consumption; and (3) gradually increasing exchange rate flexibility to 
help the economy better absorb external shocks.

Trajectory  
Background. The NIIP reached 16.5 percent of GDP in 2023, from 13.6 percent in 2022 and significantly below the peak 
of 30.4 percent in 2008. The increase largely reflects the CA surplus. 
Assessment. The NIIP-to-GDP ratio is expected to remain positive and increase modestly over the medium term in line 
with the narrowing CA surplus. Increasing portfolio investment, on the back of China’s gradual financial opening, is 
expected to diversify its foreign assets and liabilities further. The NIIP is not a major source of risk, as assets remain 
high—reflecting large foreign reserves ($3.4 trillion as of the end of 2023, 19.5 percent of GDP)—and liabilities are mostly 
related to FDI.

Current  
Account  
Background. Following the increase since 2019, the CA surplus declined to 1.4 percent of GDP in 2023 as domestic 
saving declined to its pre-pandemic level. The lower CA surplus reflects lower goods and services balances. After a post-
reopening increase in trade in 2023Q1, exports declined amid weak global demand and the unwinding of the COVID-19-
related surge in goods exports. Imports evolved in line with domestic demand, sequentially weakening in 2023Q2–Q3 
and partially rebounding in 2023Q4. Taken together, the trade balance declined to 3.3 percent of GDP (from 3.7 percent 
of GDP in 2022) as exports weakened more than imports. The 2023 services deficit increased to 1.2 percent of GDP (from 
0.5 percent of GDP in 2022) as outbound tourism partially recovered. Over the medium term, domestic saving is 
expected to decline faster than investment, due to rapid population aging and the associated rising social spending 
pressures further reducing the CA surplus. 
Assessment. Based on the adjusted results of the EBA CA model, the IMF staff CA gap ranges from –0.7 to 0.5 percent of 
GDP with a midpoint of –0.1 percent. As the travel balance continues to recover to pre-COVID-19 levels, an adjustor of –
0.4 percent is applied to the CA. EBA-identified policy gaps are estimated at –0.6 percent of GDP, driven by relatively 
favorable credit conditions (–0.3 percent of GDP) and looser fiscal policy than in other countries (–0.2 percent of GDP).

Exchange  
Rate  
Background. In 2023, the REER depreciated by 8.2 percent from the 2022 average, faster than the NEER depreciation (3.4 
percent) reflecting lower inflation in China. The REER depreciation more than reversed the appreciation of 5 percent in 
2020–21, which followed a depreciation of 7 percent during 2015–19. As of April 2024, the REER had depreciated by 2.7 
percent relative to the 2023 average. 
Assessment. The IMF staff CA gap implies a REER gap of 0.7 percent. The EBA REER index regression estimates the REER 
gap in 2023 to be 5.1 percent, and the EBA REER level regression estimates the REER gap to be 3.4 percent. Consistent 
with the IMF staff CA gap, the IMF staff assesses the REER to be in the range of –3.6 to 5.0 percent with a midpoint of 0.7 
percent (with an estimated elasticity of 0.14 applied). 
Capital and  
Financial  
Background. The 2023 financial account (excluding net errors and omissions) reached –1.2 percent of GDP (–1.4 percent 
of GDP in 2022) as capital outflow pressures reemerged in 2023H2, while inward FDI reached a historically low level (0.2 


PEOPLE’S REPUBLIC OF CHINA

Accounts:

and Policy  
Measures  
percent of GDP) and portfolio investment remained subdued (0.1 percent of GDP). Net errors and omissions declined in 
absolute terms to –0.2 percent of GDP in 2023 (from the 2015–20 average of –1.4 percent of GDP). The authorities raised 
the cross-border financing macroprudential adjustment parameter for financial institutions and enterprises from 1.25 to 
1.5 (relaxation of an inflow CFM measure) in July 2023. The authorities cut FX reserve requirements from 6 to 4 percent in 
September. As of the end of May 2024, the total Qualified Domestic Institutional Investor quota stood at $167.8 billion.1 
Assessment. Substantial net outflow pressures resurfaced with the divergence of China’s monetary policy from that in 
advanced economies, expectations for weakening economic prospects as well as market-perceived geopolitical risk and 
economic policy uncertainty. Over the medium term, further capital account opening is likely to create substantially 
larger two-way gross flows. The sequencing of capital account opening consistent with exchange rate flexibility should 
carefully consider domestic financial stability, while addressing the faster pace of private sector accumulation of foreign 
assets with respect to nonresident accumulation of Chinese assets. CFMs should not be used to actively manage the 
capital flow cycle or substitute for warranted macroeconomic adjustment and exchange rate flexibility. Over the medium 
term, China should gradually phase out CFM measures in a sequence consistent with greater exchange rate flexibility and 
accompanying reforms.  
FX 
Interventio
n  
and 
Reserves  
Level  
Background. FX reserves increased (by about $110 billion) and reached $3.3 trillion as of the end of 2023. In the last 
quarter of 2023, a partial recovery in capital flows, including FDI, and favorable valuation effects contributed to an 
increase in FX reserves that more than offset losses in the first three quarters of the year. 
Assessment. The end-of-2023 reserve assets, including gold, at $3.4 trillion—69 percent of the IMF’s standard composite 
metric at the end of 2023 (68 percent in 2022) and 112 percent of the metric adjusted for capital controls (110 percent in 
2022)—are assessed to be adequate. Temporary FX intervention could be considered in the event of large capital 
outflows that pose significant risks to macroeconomic and financial stability, including if markets turn disorderly.

Appendix III. Sovereign Risk and Debt Sustainability Assessment  
The Sovereign Risk and Debt Sustainability Assessment (SRDSA) assesses sovereign risk and 
government debt under staff’s estimated general government “augmented” definition. “Augmented” 
debt and associated gross financing needs are high and on an upward trajectory. A gradual fiscal 
adjustment over 2025-2035 is needed to stabilize debt by 2035.  
1.      
Staff assess sovereign risk based on the “augmented” debt definition. Augmented debt 
includes both official and off-budget debt: 
Official debt includes central government debt and “on-budget” local government debt identified by 
the authorities.1  
Off-budget debt adds other types of local government borrowing, including Staff estimates of debt 
from LGFVs, government-guided funds, and special construction funds, whose activities are 
considered quasi-fiscal. The augmented deficit is the flow counterpart of augmented debt. 
Augmented data are staff’s best estimate of general government data. Data limitations mean some 
nongovernment activity is likely included, and some LGFV and funds may have substantial revenues. 
It is also possible that some general government activity takes place outside of staff’s augmented 
definition (e.g., public-private partnerships). 
2.      
Under the baseline scenario debt continues to rise over the medium and long term. 
Augmented debt rises to about 165 percent of GDP in 2033 from 117 percent of GDP in 2023.2 The 
main driver are large primary deficits that are projected to decline only slowly over time, as the 
reduction in off-budget investment is partly offset by rising pension spending due to aging.3 Positive 
growth-interest differentials (owing to a financial system that channels ample domestic savings to 
finance GG debt at favorable rates) help contain the debt rise but are projected to slowly reverse in 
the long term as potential growth falls. The recommended consolidation path between 2025-2035 
(an average structural primary balance tightening of 0.7 percent of GDP every year) stabilizes the 
debt-to-GDP ratio by 2035. Risks such as faster accumulation of general government debt or lower-
than-projected potential growth would call for a more ambitious long-term consolidation path. In 
the baseline, gross financing needs hover around 30 percent of GDP but would slightly increase in 
 
1In 2014, 2/3 of existing LGFV debt was explicitly recognized as a government liability following a government audit. 
2 The baseline is surrounded by large uncertainty. Bolder policies to restructure the real estate sector would add to 
government debt in the short term (see text figure), while LGFV debt restructuring could reduce augmented debt, 
with the size of the reduction depending on the degree of burden sharing with the private sector and potential 
macro-fiscal and financial spillovers requiring further stabilization measures (see 2023 SIP).   
3 The baseline assumes continued a small amount of reductions in the LGFV debt NPV through bank maturity 
extensions, interest rate reductions, and refinancing with official LG debt, in line with recent years. LGFV debt 
refinancing with official debt does not change augmented debt. Additional pension spending due to aging is 
estimated using UN population projections (medium fertility scenario) and assuming unchanged policies. 


PEOPLE’S REPUBLIC OF CHINA 
76 
INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND 
the medium and long term in the absence of fiscal consolidation.4 In addition to increased pension 
spending due to aging incorporated in the baseline, investment needs to reach the 2060 climate 
goal could substantially increase the pace of debt accumulation if they were financed with 
government borrowing. However, China plans to rely on additional financing instruments such as 
expanding the coverage of the Emissions Trading System (ETS). A prolonged period of deflation 
would further raise the debt-to-GDP ratio (Box 2). Increased health spending due to aging (not 
included in the baseline) would have minor effects. 
3.      
Several factors mitigate risks associated with China’s high augmented debt level and 
large financing requirements. Most of China’s debt (about 95 percent of the total) is held by 
domestic residents and only a small portion is denominated in foreign currency, while the capital 
account is not fully open. The general government’s positive net financial worth (estimated at 7 
percent of GDP in 2019 by Lam and Moreno-Badia, 2023) further mitigates risks. The availability of 
liquid assets (government deposits in the banking system are a third of GDP), and the ability of 
domestic financial institutions to provide financing (the largely state-dominated commercial banking 
system claims on the government are only a quarter of the banking system’s assets) offsets risks too. 
However, LGFV debt has shorter maturities (about 3 years on average compared with 7 years for 
official debt), is exposed to higher liquidity risks, and depends more on financing from nonbank 
financial institutions. 
 
4 The SRDSA assumes maturing debt is rolled over and asset-based financing declines gradually.

Comments
Staff's assessment of the overall risk of sovereign stress is moderate, 
with downside risks. While the mechanical signal suggests medium- 
and long-term risks are high, fiscal consolidation to stabilize debt is 
feasible, and the partially closed capital account mitigates risks. 
Moreover, large government assets could be used to meet financing 
needs, with the government financial net worth estimated to be 
positive and include sizeable cash deposits (Lam and Moreno-Badia, 
2023).
No
DSA Summary Assessment
Commentary: China has a moderate overall risk of sovereign stress. Debt is expected to rise over the medium and long 
term, but it can be stabilized with a gradual fiscal adjustment over 2025-2035. Medium-term liquidity risks as analyzed by 
the GFN Financeability Module are high. However, China's partially closed capital account and the government's ample 
financial assets mitigate liquidity risks. To contain debt risks, China should seek to reduce public investment and close its 
structural revenue gap through comprehensive tax reform.
Source: Fund staff.
Note: The risk of sovereign stress is a broader concept than debt sustainability. Unsustainable debt can only be resolved 
through exceptional measures (such as debt restructuring). In contrast, a sovereign can face stress without its debt necessarily 
being unsustainable, and there can be various measures—that do not involve a debt restructuring—to remedy such a 
situation, such as fiscal adjustment and new financing.
1/ The near-term assessment is not applicable in cases where there is a disbursing IMF arrangement. In surveillance-only cases 
or in cases with precautionary IMF arrangements, the near-term assessment is performed but not published.
2/ A debt sustainability assessment is optional for surveillance-only cases and mandatory in cases where there is a Fund 
arrangement. The mechanical signal of the debt sustainability assessment is deleted before publication. In surveillance-only 
cases or cases with IMF arrangements with normal access, the qualifier indicating probability of sustainable debt ("with high 
probability" or "but not with high probability") is deleted before publication.
Staff's assessment of the medium term risk of sovereign stress is 
high. The mechanical medium-term signals for the fan chart and GFN 
indicate "high" risk, largely driven by the non-stabilization of debt 
and annual gross financing needs that hover around 30 percent of 
GDP.
Long-term risks are high given the effect of aging on pension and 
health spending, as well as large climate mitigation investment 
needs, and declining potential growth prospects. Staff estimates 
that annual pension spending will increase by about 9 percent of 
GDP from 2023 to 2052.

(about 3 years on average compared with 7 years for official debt), is exposed to higher liquidity risks, and depends 
more on financing from non-bank financial institutions.

Commentary: The custom baseline assumes constant values for primary deficits, interest, and growth for the LT projection 
period (2030-2053), while charts in the main text are based on Staff's time-varying projections. Under the historical 10-year 
average scenario in which real GDP growth is at 6 percent, debt-to-GDP grows significantly less than in the baseline, as the 
baseline incorporates declining growth in the absence of comprehensive structural reforms (IMF, 2022).

Total Public Debt-to-GDP Ratio
Commentary: The demographics health module shows a slightly steeper trajectory of public debt-to-GDP ratio when 
taking into account the effect of China's aging population on health expenditures over the long term. The increase in debt-
to-GDP ratio is largest under the scenario with both demographics and excess cost of health (ECG), though the 
differences across the different scenarios are overall very small.

GFN-to-GDP Ratio
Total Public Debt-to-GDP Ratio
Commentary: China's investment needs to meet its net neutrality target in 2060 are sizeable, estimated at around 5 
percent of GDP (Chateau, Chen, Jaumotte, Zhunussova, 2022). If these climate investments were funded with the same 
instruments that are used to finance the general govenment deficit, then debt could reach close to 250 percent of GDP by 
2050. This indicates that other options, such as ETS reforms (to move closer to an optimal carbon pricing tool), as well as 
improved standards and regulations, and private sector investment would be preferable from the perspective of public 
debt-to-GDP.

Appendix IV. Implementation of Past Fund Advice  
1.      
The take up of past Fund advice has been mixed. The fiscal and monetary policy stance 
since the last Article IV has been directionally consistent with staff advice. Some progress has also 
been made in property sector and structural policies, though significant challenges remain. 
2.      
The authorities have implemented various measures to steer the property market 
transition, with varied results. Policies aimed to stimulate housing demand and increase financing 
available to real estate developers have had limited success. More recently, the authorities have 
scaled up financing for social and affordable housing, including allowing local SOEs to acquire 
completed housing for conversion to affordable housing, and set up a cross-agency coordination 
mechanism to facilitate bank financing (whitelist). Key staff recommendations regarding accelerating 
the exit of insolvent developers, providing CG funding to complete pre-sold unfinished housing, and 
removing impediments to price adjustments have seen limited progress. 
3.      
The staff-assessed neutral fiscal stance in 2023 and in the 2024 budget are appropriate, 
though tackling underlying fiscal challenges will require further policy effort. While the near-
term fiscal stance has been in line with staff advice, little progress has been made in reorienting 
expenditures away from investment and towards households. The government’s intention to tackle 
LG debt vulnerabilities is also in line with staff advice, though a comprehensive plan to implement 
the needed medium-term consolidation and resolve the large stock of LG debt remains missing. 
4.      
The PBC has loosened monetary policy, consistent with staff advice. However, there 
remains scope to rely more on interest-rate based policy tools rather than quantity-based tools. 
Allowing for more exchange rate flexibility and continuing to deepen the market-oriented reform of 
interest rates can also help enhance transmission and increase monetary policy space. 
5.      
Tackling financial sector vulnerabilities is appropriately a key focus of the authorities. 
The latest round of consolidation of small banks is consistent with staff advice and should continue, 
though faster progress is needed to strengthen and strictly apply prudential rules. Significant 
changes to the financial regulatory architecture, if well implemented, can support the elevated focus 
on financial vulnerabilities. Bridging gaps in risk resolution frameworks and financial safety nets 
remain key areas where reform momentum is needed. 
6.      
Some progress has been made on structural policies, notably on climate mitigation, 
though the deep reforms needed to boost productivity remain elusive. The authorities have 
extended Hukou reforms, marginally improved social safety nets, and have plans to expand the 
scope of the ETS, all consistent with staff advice. However, progress remains limited in other key 
areas, including on implementing SOE reforms, scaling back industrial policies, and advancing 
pension reforms.

Since March 2023, under the leadership of the Central Financial Commission (CFC), 
financial regulators have established a number of joint working mechanisms to 
address major cross-sectoral and cross-regional issues; they have also improved 
policy coordination and information sharing. 
Mechanisms for information sharing among members of the domestic 
financial safety net. Measures by the People’s Bank of China (PBC): (1) The PBC 
is using information sharing mechanisms to enable better access to banks’ offsite 
regulatory data, including key indicators for banking operations and financial 
operations; data on the quality of credit loans and assets; and key regulatory 
indicators. (2) The PBC regularly shares its central bank ratings with the National 
Administration of Financial Regulation (NFRA). (3) Any issues with deposit insurance 
discovered during onsite inspections or risk testing are quickly reported to the 
NFRA. The NAFR has improved its coordination and information sharing with other 
institutions. It regularly shares data from the banking and insurance industries with 
the PBC, National Bureau of Statistics (NBS), China Security Regulatory Commission 
(CSRC), Ministry of Commerce (MoC) and other authorities, to support shared 
efforts to maintain the security and stability of the financial system. It continues to 
develop and improve national and local coordination on monitoring and warning 
systems for illegal financing, and sharing of leads on the risk of illegal financing. 
Measures by the CSRC: (1) Signed memoranda of cooperation on data sharing with 
the PBC and the State Administration of Foreign Exchange (SAFE); and improved 
information sharing among financial regulators. It is obtaining relevant data on bank 
and insurance company balance sheets, P&Ls, OTC stock pledges, and asset 
management products. (2) In compliance with the Rules for the Accounting of Assets 
and Liabilities for Securities Industry Financial Institutions and its sub-regulations, the 
CSRC shares balance sheet data for securities companies, providing it to relevant 
regulators on an annual and quarterly basis. (3) The CSRC is exploring all 
possibilities for joint action on the monitoring of cross-exchange, cross-market and

cross border transactions and risks. The CSRC coordinates with the PBC and 
departments/institutions within the CSRC system to encourage the pooling of data 
on investor assets and transactions, which was previously distributed across various 
CSRC functions, into a unified big data pool. This includes data on cross-border 
transactions, asset management products, derivatives, etc. 
The PBC has worked to improve information sharing with international 
members of the Global Financial Safety Net (GFSN). The PBC continues to 
support the collection of financial stability data by the IMF. We submit key 
indicators to the IMF on a quarterly basis and agree to data disclosures on the IMF 
website. The PBC actively supports the NFRA's reporting of data since 2022Q4 using 
the new template required by the IMF. Data has been provided up to Q3, 2023. The 
NFRA is engaging and working with overseas financial regulators, building systems 
for collaboration that are multi-level, multi-channel, and span multiple fields. (1) 
The NFRA regularly chairs joint conferences with key regulators of G-SIBs as part of 
the PBC-led working group on managing cross-border financial crises. It engages as 
a regulator with the regulatory institutions of many other countries, and maintains 
open channels of communication. (2) Expanding the current geographical reach of 
regulatory MoUs, and expanding the scope of regulatory collaboration. As of the 
end of April 2024, the NFRA has signed 126 agreements on regulatory cooperation 
with financial regulators in 87 countries and regions, including 55 Belt and Road 
participating countries. For example, the NFRA has signed new regulatory MoUs 
with the monetary authorities of Saudi Arabia and Azerbaijan; it has updated its 
MoU with the UK's Prudential Regulation Authority, adding insurance regulation 
into the scope of the MoU; signed an MoU on cooperation on the insurance 
industry with the Swiss Financial Market Supervisory Authority (FINMA); and 
renewed our MoU with the central bank of Hungary. These MoUs specify how the 
parties will handle information exchange, onsite inspections, crisis management, 
data protection, regulator meetings, etc. (3) Regular bilateral regulator conferences. 
The NFRA has established arrangements for conferences with regulators in Japan, 
South Korea, Singapore, UK, Luxembourg, USA, and the EU. It holds regular 
meetings with these regulators on the status of branch offices in each others’ 
territories; areas of regulatory concern; new regulatory decisions; and to share 
experience. Going forward, as the need arises, we will explore appropriate formats 
for bilateral discussions on regulatory strategy with key national regulators, and 
reaffirming the ongoing, regular exchanges we have with the US banking and 
insurance regulators. We will be expanding our relationship with regulators in key 
nations and in neighboring countries and regions, and exploring formal 
arrangements for regulatory communications with more overseas regulators. (4) 
Organizing and participating in joint conferences. The NFRA organizes an annual 
joint conference on the regulation of China's largest four G-SIBs, to which we invite 
representatives of relevant global regulators. These conferences touch on the 
current status of these Chinese banks, new regulations in various countries (regions), 
and specific issues in the regulation of individual banks. The NFRA, in its capacity as 
the home regulator of Chinese banks and insurance companies, also attends joint 
conferences organized by overseas financial regulators on the regulation of foreign 
entities. It also keeps up to date with the business of foreign banks and insurance 
companies with branches in China. And it discusses recovery and resolution plans 
for banks and insurers within the framework of a crisis management group (CMG) 
when necessary. (5) Day-to-day communication with overseas regulators. The NFRA 
communicates with overseas regulators on issues such as the qualification checks

for senior managers, information requests, and sharing regulatory experience. 
Channels include phone conferences, emails, and video conference. CSRC and 
international organizations: improved exchanges of information and sharing of 
financial data. (1) The CSRC has responded to the Financial Stability Board (FSB) 
climate change survey questionnaires, providing data on the size of funds under 
management to the non-bank sector expert group. It engaged in a mutual 
exchange of data with the Hong Kong Securities and Futures Commission (HKSFC); 
and it regularly exchanged information on the MSCI China A 50 Connect Index 
Futures, and OTC derivatives of stocks on the A-share market. (2) Better regulatory 
collaboration. The CSRC is actively expanding cross-border regulation and 
enforcement cooperation with securities and futures regulators in other countries, 
and is an active participant in international financial regulation. As of the end of 
April 2024, it has signed MoUs on bilateral regulatory cooperation and established 
mechanisms for regulatory collaboration with securities/futures regulators in 67 
countries and regions. The agreement with the HKSFC includes regular high-level 
meetings for consultation over policy on market regulation and major areas of 
cooperation. These meetings expand and extend the depth and breadth of the 
regulatory collaboration between the two regions, and make our regulatory and law 
enforcement collaboration more effective. As a full member of the International 
Organization of Securities Commissions (IOSCO), the CSRC also faithfully fulfills its 
duty to cooperate in cross-border law enforcement under the multilateral MoU, 
working with its partners to crack down on cross-border securities crime.

(1) The Chinese government's departmental budget management systems 
effectively support and safeguard the work of financial regulators. The PBC, 
NFRA, and CSRC operate the departmental budget management system, ensuring 
that public expenditures are properly budgeted and disbursed. The drafting, review, 
approval, and oversight of budgets, as well as their administration and amendment, 
are carried out in compliance with the Law of the People's Republic of China on 
Budgets. Budget records show that regulator budgets have maintained positive 
growth over the past few years. For example, the NFRA's budget for 2024, as 
approved by the Ministry of Finance at the start of the year, was CNY 967 million 
higher than in 2017, reflecting an average growth of 2.12% per year. Monetary 
policy operations are not included in the budget, and are financed on an as-needed 
basis, so budget restrictions will not affect monetary policy operations. 
(2) A new round of institutional reforms is improving the structure of financial 
regulatory bodies and their relative weights. Following the Reform Plan for Party 
and State Institutions and institutional reform plans approved by the State Council, 
the NFRA was created out of the previous China Banking and Insurance Regulatory 
Commission (CBIRC); the CBIRC and CSRC changed from operational units of the 
State Council to institutions of the State Council. The NFRA was given enhanced 
regulatory powers over financial operations beyond securities; and the CSRC given 
more powers over capital markets. Budget calculations were updated, and more 
fiscal resources were provided to ensure that duties could be properly executed. 
(3) Actively increases the resources and capacity for front-line regulators, 
improving the allocation of regulatory resources. As part of the institutional

reforms, the NFRA has increased regulatory capacity at the front line, improving the 
allocation of regulatory resources, improving the efficiency of resource use, and 
reinforcing the foundations of regulatory operations. Personnel are required to have 
more practical experience, with programmed transfers of officers to front line 
operations to gain experience, including risk resolution operations and onsite 
inspections. Training programs have been enhanced. From 2018 to 2024, the NFRA 
carried out 597 training programs. 220 were in-person training, whereas 277 were 
online. The CSRC continues to refine its allocation of regulatory resources, and to 
update the duties of regulators, to ensure practical implementation of regulatory 
operations. For example, the number of personnel employed by the CSRC grew 
from 2,903 in 2017 to 3,749 in 2023, an increase of 29%. Moving forward, the CSRC 
will continue to improve its allocation of resources and regulatory capacity, based 
on the needs of regulating the Chinese capital markets, to ensure that it achieves 
the objectives of improving regulation, preventing risk, and supporting high-quality 
growth in the capital markets.

The NFRA continues to increase the granularity in its reporting requirements, 
and to raise the required levels of data quality. (1) For off-site surveillance, 
reporting requirements have been increased on commercial banks for online 
lending, derivatives services, real estate financing, resolution of non-performing 
loans, credit cards, and local government debt and wealth management products at 
commercial banks. Improvements have also been made in the accounting of on-
balance sheet and off-balance sheet investments and provisions. (2) Using the off-
site surveillance system, the newly-developed regulatory platform, and other tools, 
the NFRA is collecting all regulatory data and improving data collation, with a focus 
on the quality of bank loan and investment assets, provisions, and capitalization. (3) 
The NFRA has created a regulator data system for corporate governance, which 
collects regulatory information on banks, including their shareholders and holdings, 
related-party transactions, and corporate governance practices. This system is 
making regulation smarter and more data-based. Using the system, the NFRA can 
conduct governance assessments, understand the operations of banks’ 
shareholders, directors, supervisory boards, and management; the actions and 
fulfillment of duties by directors, supervisors and senior management; their 
management of shareholders and related-party transactions; etc. When problems 
have been discovered, it can follow up and monitor the remedies. (4) The NFRA has 
developed reporting requirements for special credit risks, such as creditors' 
committees, and requires banks to provide regular reports on them. It has increased 
the reporting frequency for some data, requiring banks to make some quarterly 
reports on a monthly basis. (5) The NFRA has developed a dedicated reporting form 
for on-balance sheet and off-balance sheet investments by local commercial banks, 
with increased granularity in the reporting, and monitoring carried out on a regular 
basis, collecting data on and monitoring asset quality and provisioning for 
investment projects. (6) The NFRA regularly carries out risk identification exercises 
for trust companies, including two-way "look-through" analyses of their trust 
services, to determine the real level of risk. Off-site surveillance of trust companies 
focuses on the compliance of trust products, "look-through," and risk monitoring. In 
trust services, It requires that parties, sources of funds, and uses of funds are legible 
and properly understood. (7) The NFRA encourages financial infrastructure 
companies to use the National Bank Wealth Management Product Registration 
System, to develop a big data database on wealth management. It makes constant 
use of data on wealth management products for dynamic risk monitoring, with a 
regulatory analysis of wealth management services carried out every month. In early 
2023, the then CBIRC created monthly/quarterly monitoring systems for insurance 
asset management products. The NFRA continues to closely monitor the

(8) The NFRA researches and sets additional data reporting templates for small rural 
banks to collect data on credit loans, interbank operations, investments, etc., outside 
the bank's region of registration, both on-balance sheet and off-balance sheet, to 
enhance regulatory analyses. 
The CBIRC should 
strengthen its forward-
looking comprehensive 
risk analysis to identify 
vulnerabilities, question 
banks, and encourage 
intervention before the 
fact.   
Medium 
priority  
The NFRA continues to make its regulation more forward-looking and 
effective, and has put in place risk warning systems. (1) Bank ratings are 
forward-looking. Applying the updated Measures for Regulatory Ratings of 
Commercial Banks, regulators engage in an ongoing, comprehensive, in-depth data 
collection process on internal and public information related to bank ratings. Data 
collected include (but are not limited to): off-site regulatory information, on-site 
inspection reports and data, operational and management documentation for 
banks, auditor's reports, complaints and reports of illegal conduct, and other 
significant internal and external information. This data fully reflects the status of 
corporate governance, risk management, and operations at banks. Having collated 
and analyzed all of this information, regulators consider bank risk, growth, areas of 
concentration, etc., and develop a rating and form a judgment of the bank's future 
condition. (2) Stress testing. Stress tests are an important forward-looking 
regulatory instrument. Regulators require that commercial banks conduct regular 
stress tests, and make full use of stress tests in their internal risk management and 
capital planning, in compliance with Guidance on Stress Tests for Commercial Banks 
(Yin Jian Fa [2014] No. 49). Regulators also see stress tests as a highly important part 
of commercial banks’ capital planning, and require banks to make stress tests a key 
part of their internal capital adequacy assessment processes. Banks should reference 
the outcomes of stress tests when determining their internal capital adequacy 
targets. The coverage of stress tests should include all of the main risks in a bank's 
major areas of business, and tests should fully consider the implications of 
economic cycles for capital adequacy. The then CBIRC issued Interim Measures on 
the Supervisory Rating of Insurance Asset Management Companies in January 2021, 
and conducted yearly ratings of insurance asset management companies. The rating 
process requires insurance asset management companies to establish risk indicator 
systems that satisfy their trustors’ risk appetites and risk tolerance. The ratings 
assess the development and use of said systems and apply stress tests to predict 
levels of risk in these companies’ asset management. (3) Developing early warning 
systems for banking risks. The Regulation on Early Warning Systems for Bank Risk 
(Trial) was issued, establishing mechanisms for risk alarms and responses. Regulator 
personnel are encouraged to accept and respond to early warnings. In the light of 
the overall assessed risk, regulators should take targeted, differentiated measures 
for early intervention. The NFRA updated the REASS risk alert system for banks, 
putting the risk alert process completely online. The risk indicators were updated, 
with broader sources of information, enabling alerts with range of levels and types. 
(4) Updating bank risk analyses and controls. In December 2023, the NFRA 
amended Measures for Operational Risk Controls at Banks and Insurers, updating the 
regulatory rules for the operational risk controls by banks and insurers. It made 
specific requirements for improvements in operational risk control. The amended 
Measures will go into effect on July 1, 2024. (5) Updated bank early warning 
systems. The NFRA, working with the PBC, is developing a guidance to regulate 
early interventions of bank risk. This work will continue as scheduled in the 
legislative plan. (6) Specific measures for different classes of institution. (i)

Annual bank ratings for commercial banks. If a bank’s governance deteriorates, or it 
has multiple risk issues, then its rating will be reduced. The consequences of bank 
ratings have been expanded, with banks informed of negative ratings more quickly, 
and reminders to rectify problems. Improved use of risk early warning systems, with 
timely analysis of warning signals and appropriate responses. (ii) Improved risk 
monitoring and early warning systems for urban commercial banks and private 
banks. Five new aspects were added to expand the scope of typical risks monitored: 
expansion risk, concentration risk, cost of debt, asset deterioration, interest rate risk. 
This has enabled better overall assessments and warnings, and made our risk 
management more forward-looking, better targeted, and more effective. Improved 
analysis and monitoring of liquidity risk at municipal commercial bank and private 
banks improving day-to-day analysis and response to warnings. (iii) The NFRA 
constantly tracks the operations and risk levels in small and medium-sized rural 
banks, running monthly data analyses. Where necessary, it issues risk alerts at 
meetings, in published reports, risk warnings, or through window guidance. It may 
also carry out targeted risk elimination, focusing on large loans, remote transactions, 
and credit risk; it may require the development of risk-specific risk response plans. 
For small rural banks it has a system of risk warning indicators, and monitors for risk 
warnings in these institutions on an ongoing basis, including liquidity and liability 
stability, growth of on-balance sheet and off-balance sheet operations, loan mix, 
credit risk, and key operations. (iv) We carry out risk surveys on trust companies on 
a quarterly basis, track risk trends in the trust industry, and send risk notices and risk 
alerts as necessary. (v) Issued Notice on the System for the Rectification of Problems 
Discovered by Regulators in Early Intervention in Non-bank Risks, as part of our 
efforts on early intervention in non-bank risks, to promote compliance and stable

Banks consider their own risk appetite, risk control capacity, and business strategy 
to meet the reasonable funding needs of companies with advanced technologies, 
competitive products, and strong market demand. In May 2024, the NFRA issued 
Guiding Opinions on the Implementation of Five Major Policy Directions in the 
Banking and Insurance Industries. It requires differentiated regulation and dynamic 
assessment of the market and social and governance risks, which should be 
incorporated into operational processes and into comprehensive risk management 
systems, with differentiated regulatory approaches. This will effectively satisfy the 
demand for finance during the low-carbon transition of high energy and high

In April 2024, the PBC instructed Shanghai Clearing House (SCH) and the China 
Foreign Exchange Trade System (CFETS) to launch general repo clearing 
services for the interbank bond market; it charged SCH with developing and 
updating regulatory arrangements and discounting formulas for collateral 
repos. Qualification of collateral bonds: The SCH developed strict controls for the 
approval of collateral bonds. Initially, qualification was restricted to financial bonds 
and interbank deposits issued by development banks, policy banks, and selected 
commercial banks; and debt financing instruments issued by high quality non-
financial corporations. Discounting formulas: The SCH applies the prudential 
principle to the calculation and setting of discount rates. It also reflects 
macroeconomic policy in settings such as collateral discount rates, participant 
discount rates, and countercyclical adjustment factors. Collateral discount rates and 
participant discount rates are discount factors applied to collateral assets and 
clearing house members, respectively. They are calculated by SCH based on the risk 
control policies of the central counterparty clearing house, and reflect factors such 
as price volatility in collateral bonds, and the credit ratings and likelihood of default 
of repo transaction participants. These discount rates reflect the macroeconomic 
policies of the PBC Headquarter, based on current policy and its comprehensive 
view of the markets, and offer a lever for preventing and resolving leveraging risk, 
and mitigating pro-cyclical effects in the money markets.

In March 2024, the NFRA issued Measures for Regulatory Ratings of Personal 
Insurance Companies. This instrument creates a comprehensive risk evaluation 
system with six dimensions: corporate governance, business operations, use of 
capital, management of assets and liabilities, solvency, and other. Different 
regulatory regimes apply to insurers depending on their rating. This has improved 
the ability of the NFRA to identify risks among personal insurance companies and to 
issue alerts, supporting the regulatory objectives of differentiated regulation for

Use of data and/or estimates different from official statistics in the Article IV consultation. The fiscal data used in the Article IV consultation 
supplements the official GFS statistics with Staff estimates for deficits and debt for a broader definition of general government which includes data on off-
budget entities (including LGFVs). Staff's augmented defintion of the general government better reflects the fiscal stance and the government’s role in the 
economy.
Other data gaps. Data on aggregate economically active population is published, but only at an annual frequency and with long lags.
Changes since the last Article IV consultation. The National Bureau of Statistics had suspended the publication of survey unemployment by age group

The data provided to the Fund has serious shortcomings that significantly hamper surveillance.
Rationale for staff assessment. The data provided to the Fund has some shortcomings but is broadly adequate for surveillance.  Efforts at 
strengthening the statistical system and enhancing data transparency led to China’s subscription to the Special Data Dissemination Standard (SDDS) in 
October 2015. Nevertheless, China’s statistics continue to have significant gaps. The main areas of concern relate to national accounts data and 
government finance statistics. For national accounts, lack of quarterly GDP by expenditure component (nominal, real, and seasonally adjusted) is a key 
shortcoming, as reflected in the choice of the team to lower sectoral rating for national accounts to "C". China does not publish CPI weights and PPI 
weights, either on the website of the statistical office nor on the IMF CPI database. This makes it difficult to analyze the source of consumer price inflation 
by products, by regions etc. For fiscal data, long-standing data gaps include general government data with a breakdown of expenditure by economic 
type (current and capital expenditure) and data on off-budget entities (including LGFVs) that meet the statistical criteria for inclusion within the perimeter 
of the general government. While external sector data is broadly adequate, lack of institutional sector breakdown for the financial account and the type 
of investment income (e.g., FDI income, portfolio investment income, and other investment income) for the primary income account hampers analysis of 
financial and income flows.

Appendix VII. Difference in Goods Trade Balance Between BOP 
and Customs Data 
 
In recent years, China has recorded smaller trade surpluses in the balance of payments (BOP) statistics 
than those in based on Customs data. The divergence seems to be mainly caused by the different 
methodologies used to record exports and imports of goods in BOP and Customs. The former records 
imports and exports when ownership of the goods is transferred between residents and nonresidents 
while the latter records them when the goods physically cross the border. This Appendix discusses 
potential underlying reasons for the BOP-Customs gap and clarifies that the recording of imports and 
exports related to global production arrangements (e.g., factoryless manufacturing) may largely explain 
the widening divergence between the two indicators based on the information provided by the 
authorities.  
1.      
China’s BOP goods trade surpluses in 
recent years show a widening divergence from 
those recorded by Customs—with the gap over 
one percent of GDP in 2023. Since 2019, the 
Customs-based trade surpluses have been 
persistently above the BOP-based surpluses, with 
the gap widening significantly over time. In 2023, 
China’s BOP goods trade surplus was USD 594 
billion while Customs recorded a surplus of USD 
823 billion, a difference of USD 229 billion or 1.3 
percent of GDP.1 
2.      
The divergence seems to be mainly caused by the difference in methodologies to 
record imports and exports of goods in BOP and Customs. In BOP, imports and exports of goods 
are recorded when ownership of the goods is transferred between residents and nonresidents 
regardless of the location of the goods. Customs records imports and exports of goods when the 
goods physically cross the border of China regardless of ownership of the goods.2 The 
methodological difference is particularly relevant in the recording of imports and exports related to 
global production arrangements (e.g., factoryless manufacturing) where nonresident enterprises 
(e.g., multinational enterprises) outsource part of production to contractors in China. 
3.      
Exports and imports arising from factoryless manufacturing seem to have been 
reducing China’s overall goods trade surplus in BOP. When a Chinese contractor sells produced 
goods to the nonresident enterprise that outsourced the production, exports of goods are recorded 
in BOP even if the goods remain in China (e.g., in warehouses). If the nonresident enterprise 
 
1 The difference slightly increased to 1.4 percent of GDP in the first quarter of 2024.

Position Manual (BPM6). 


PEOPLE’S REPUBLIC OF CHINA 
102 INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND 
subsequently sells the goods in China, imports of goods are recorded in BOP. Given that the Chinese 
contractors’ ex-factory price for the nonresident enterprise (China’s exports) is normally lower than 
the nonresident enterprises’ wholesale price for Chinese distributors (China’s imports),3 these 
transactions result in a deficit in the goods trade balance in BOP. Customs does not record exports 
or imports for these transactions because the goods never cross the border. So, these transactions 
do not reduce the trade surplus recorded by Customs while they do in BOP (see text Table 1,  ‘Sold 
in China’).

4.      
BOP imports kept increasing relative to 
Customs imports in recent years and surpassed 
them for the first time in 2023 (chart). The upward 
trend in this ratio is supported by China’s growing 
domestic market and rising goods produced by 
factoryless manufacturing. In the past, Customs has 
recorded higher imports than BOP because Customs’ 
imports include costs for transport and insurance 
while BOP imports of goods do not (they are 
recorded in services account).4  
 
3 The price difference comes from margins for and costs incurred by the nonresident enterprise (e.g., planning, 
management, patent, and marketing). The Chinese BOP compilers’ pilot survey to several contractors producing 
electronics found that the difference could be around 30 to 50 percent. The difference varies significantly depending 
on types of goods and types of outsourcing arrangements. 
4 Manufacturing services by Chinese contractors on goods owned by nonresidents (e.g., assembly of airplanes, 
electronic products, and clothing owned by nonresidents) also cause the divergence. Fees for manufacturing services 
that do not involve a change of ownership of the goods owned by nonresidents are recorded as services trade (not 
goods trade) in BOP while the full values of the goods are recorded as imports and exports of goods by Customs. 
There are also other cases where BOP and Customs record goods trade data differently (e.g., warehousing and 
logistics services, merchanting, and different timing of recording). 


PEOPLE’S REPUBLIC OF CHINA 
INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND 103 
For example, in China, imports recorded in BOP were lower by more than 10 percent, compared with 
imports recorded by Customs in 2010.  
5.      
Exports of goods produced by factoryless manufacturing also result in a lower trade 
surplus recorded in BOP than in Customs. For example, in cases where the nonresident enterprise 
sells the goods produced by factoryless manufacturing to a third country, the ex-factory/wholesale 
price difference make exports recorded in BOP lower than those recorded by Customs as the former 
is recorded at ex-factory price while the latter is recorded at declaration price, which in most cases 
would be the wholesale price (see Table 1, ‘Sold abroad’). Indeed, the BOP-Customs exports ratio has 
been persistently below 100 percent since 2010. The recent decline in the BOP-Customs exports 
ratio is also in line with an increase in exports from bonded zones where many manufacturers 
operate under tax-advantaged arrangements (USD 196 billion in 2020 to USD 313 billion in 2023—
60 percent increase while the overall exports increased by 27 percent during the same period). 
6.      
The ratio of BOP imports to Customs imports has increased by 12 percent points since 
2010,5 while no clear long-term trend is observable in the ratio of BOP exports to Customs 
exports data. The ratios on the export side have been volatile, and the ratio in 2023 remained 
higher than that in 2010. Chinese BOP compilers who have access to data sources (data on individual 
transactions) are also of the view that the increasing imports of goods produced by factoryless 
manufacturing have been the main driver for the divergence in goods trade data between BOP and 
Customs data. 
7.      
In order to capture exports and imports of goods that do not physically cross the 
border comprehensively, the Chinese BOP compilers switched the data sources from Customs 
data to direct reporting of financial records by large enterprises in 2022. According to the 
Chinese BOP compilers, more than 13,000 large enterprises directly report goods trade data, which 
account for about 70 percent of the total goods trade. The compilers use cross-border receipts and 
payments on goods trade obtained from the International Transactions Reporting System (reports 
from banks on international payments and receipts) for the rest of the enterprises. The new data 
sources help Chinese BOP compilers produce BOP trade data in line with the BPM6 (based on the 
change of ownership principle rather than physical movements of goods, as well as based on actual 
transaction prices rather than declared prices at Customs). The compilers are of the view that the 
switch of the data sources also contributed to narrowing net errors and omissions by correctly 
recording goods trade based on the transaction price in BOP.   
 
5 Twelve percent of imports in 2023 is USD 310 billion—1.7 percent of GDP. Without the increase in BOP imports 
relative to Customs imports, BOP would have recorded a higher trade surplus than Customs in 2023.  


PEOPLE’S REPUBLIC OF CHINA 
104 INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND 
8.      
The divergence in BOP and customs 
goods trade data are common across countries 
while China’s divergence seems to be boosted 
by (i) the high level of implementation of the 
change of ownership principle, (ii) its status as a 
major outsourcing destination, and (iii) its 
growing domestic market to import goods 
produced from outsourcing. Generally, countries 
rely on customs data with adjustments for specific 
transactions (e.g., goods for processing) to compile 
trade data for BOP according to the change of 
ownership principle. However, the adjustments are 
often challenging given compilers need to identify additional information which may not be 
available from customs.6 So, some countries are not fully implementing the change of ownership 
principle in BOP,7 while China started using new data sources to enhance the alignment with the 
change of ownership principle. Further, expanding and deepening global manufacturing 
arrangements have been making the application of the principle more challenging as they involve 
many layers of imports and exports (e.g., materials and parts) with various resident and nonresident 
enterprises.  
 
6 For example, even if the data for the adjustments can be collected from surveys to enterprises, the data have to be 
linked to corresponding customs data to make the adjustments, which is often challenging. 
7 For example, the United States records goods sent or received from abroad for processing without change of 
ownership as trade in goods in BOP.

Exchange Rate Arrangement: 
The de jure exchange rate arrangement is “managed floating” with a view to keeping the RMB 
exchange rate stable at an adaptive and equilibrium level based on market supply and demand with 
reference to a basket of currencies to preserve the stability of the Chinese economy and financial 
markets. The floating band of the RMB’s trading prices is 2 percent against the U.S. dollar in the 
interbank foreign exchange market: on each business day, the trading prices of the RMB against the 
U.S. dollar in the market may fluctuate within a band of ±2 percent around the midrate released that

day by China’s Foreign Exchange Trading System (CFETS). China’s de facto exchange rate regime is 
classified as a “crawl-like” arrangement as the CNY CFETS index remained within a sloping band of 
±1 percent since July 2023 with one realignment in November 2023. The People’s Bank of China 
(PBC) indicated that the RMB’s floating range would be changed in an orderly manner, based on the 
developments of the foreign exchange market and economic and financial situation. Within the 
trading band, banks may determine their RMB exchange rates to the U.S. dollar with their clients 
without any limit on the spread, based on market supply and demand (PBC No. 2014/188). On 
August 11, 2015, the PBC decided to further increase the flexibility of the RMB-to-USD exchange 
rate midrate quoting mechanism, thereby enhancing the market determination of RMB exchange 
rates, and giving market supply and demand an even greater role in exchange rate formation. 
 
The CFETS publishes its exchange rate index (composed of 24 currencies since January 1, 2017, 
previously, 13 currencies), and other RMB indices based on the Bank for International Settlements 
(BIS) currency basket and the SDR currency basket. 
 
China accepted the obligations of Article VIII, Sections 2(a), 3, and 4 of the IMF’s Articles of 
Agreement and maintains an exchange system free of multiple currency practices and restrictions on 
payments and transfers for current international transactions. However, China has notified measures 
to the Fund, pursuant to procedures under the Executive Board Decision No. 144 (52/51), which 
apply to measures imposed solely for national or international security reasons. 
 
While exchange controls continue to apply to most capital transactions, the use of renminbi in 
international transactions has expanded over time. On October 1, 2016, the RMB was determined to 
be a freely usable currency and was included in the SDR basket as a fifth currency, along with the 
U.S. dollar, the euro, Japanese yen, and the British pound.

STAFF REPORT FOR THE 2024 ARTICLE IV CONSULTATION—
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION 
This statement provides an update on developments that have taken place since the staff 
report was issued to the Executive Board. The thrust of the staff appraisal remains 
unchanged.  
1.
Data. Real GDP growth slowed from 5.3 percent y/y in Q1 to 4.7 percent in Q2,
primarily reflecting weaker consumption. While a decline in economic momentum was
expected in Q2, the slowdown was somewhat sharper than expected. Inflation also remained
low, with headline inflation declining from 0.3 percent (y/y) in May to 0.2 percent in June
amid continued weakness in food prices. Core inflation remained unchanged in June at 0.6
percent (y/y). Growth of total social financing (TSF) slowed from 8.4 percent in May to 8.1
percent in June, while real estate investment and house prices continued to decline.
2.
Monetary policy operations. The People’s Bank of China (PBC) has announced
additional tools for its monetary operations toolkit. To better manage interbank liquidity, the
PBC announced temporary overnight repo and reverse-repo operations at 20 basis points
below and 50 basis points above the 7-day reverse repo rate, respectively. While operational
details remain limited, the PBC also announced plans to borrow government bonds from
selected primary dealers. Their stated aim is to maintain stable operations in the bond
market. As discussed in the staff report (¶52), the PBC should transition towards a
predominantly interest rate-based monetary policy framework, with a clear, effective, and
transparent operational framework that aligns market conditions with its announced policy
stance.

Statement by Zhengxin Zhang, Executive Director for  
the People’s Republic of China 
July 19, 2024 
 
Our authorities would like to thank the IMF staff and management for their 
constructive policy dialogue during the China 2024 Article IV Consultation. We 
appreciate the staff for their professionalism and hard work, and value their 
comprehensive and well-focused analyses. In this year, Chinese production has 
grown steadily; demand has continued to recover; employment and prices have 
overall been stable; the international balance of payments is balanced; 
transformation and upgrading continue; and the economy continues to recover with 
positive signs. Going forward, China will continue to promote high-quality 
development, accelerate the development of new quality productive forces, foster 
and strengthen the new momentum of economic development, consolidate and 
strengthen the momentum of economic recovery, and continue to promote effective 
qualitative improvement and reasonable quantitative growth of the economy. 
I. Recent developments and medium-term forecast of China’s economy 
We welcome staff’s assessment that China’s economy has remained 
resilient and the upward revisions to China’s economic growth forecasts for 
2024 and 2025. China’s economic performance is broadly stable, with recovery 
across major economic indicators. There was a positive start to the year, and the 
economy grew by 5.0 percent in the first half of 2024. Domestic demand contributed 
86.1 percent of the growth, of which 60.5 percent was from consumption. 
Consumption continues to serve as both a booster and a stabilizer for economic 
growth. 
In the first half of this year, total retail sales of consumer goods grew by 3.7 
percent year-on-year; total value added of industrial enterprises grew by 6.0 percent 
year-on-year; and fixed asset investment grew by 3.9 percent year-on-year, 
particularly manufacturing investment maintained high-speed growth at 9.5 percent 
year-on-year. Prices remained generally stable. The consumer price index (CPI) 


 
2 
increased by 0.1 percent year-on-year, with core CPI rising by 0.7 percent year-on-
year. Going forward, the CPI is expected to continue its mildly recovering trend. The 
month-on-month producer price index (PPI) growth recovered to positive territory, 
while on a year-on-year basis, the contraction is narrowing, which reflects an 
improvement in supply and demand balance of industrial products domestically. In 
RMB terms, total imports and exports of goods grew by 6.1 percent year-on-year, 
with 6.9 percent growth in exports and 5.2 percent growth in imports. The trade of 
goods for half a year exceeded RMB 21 trillion for the first time. On foreign 
investment, during the first five months of the year, 21,764 new foreign-invested 
companies were established, an increase of 17.4 percent year-on-year. Actual 
utilization of foreign capital in the high-tech manufacturing sector increased by 2.7 
percentage points year-on-year. Overall, China’s economy remains stable with a 
positive outlook, and upside factors outweigh downside factors. We are confident in 
our ability to achieve our growth forecast of about 5 percent for the whole year. 
Therefore, compared to the statement in the Staff Report that “while declining, 
economic slack remains significant”, our authorities’ assessment of the recent 
Chinese economic developments is more positive. 
On China’s economic growth outlook. Currently, the complexity and 
severity of the external environment are on the rise, effective domestic demand is 
still insufficient, and there is still a need to bolster our internal momentum for 
economic development. But overall, the positive fundamentals of China’s 
economy have not changed and our structural reforms have already produced 
many positive developments. First, consumption has become an important driver 
of the economic recovery and there is still potential for further growth. The 
advantages of China’s ultra-large market scale continue to accumulate and take 
effect. Second, the low-carbon transition is advancing quickly and China’s green 
economy is growing stronger by the day. China is a leader in every link in the chain 
of renewable electricity generation, transmission, and storage. Third, the 
manufacturing sector has achieved significant advances. Corporates’ R&D 
capability continues to grow and new quality productive forces are being quickly 
fostered. In new energy vehicles, high-speed rail, shipbuilding, aerospace, consumer 
electronics, and other areas, China is currently among the top globally in terms of 


 
3 
value-added and competitiveness. And many of the industry leaders are privately-
owned companies. The rapid rise of China’s new industries reflects global trends in 
technology revolution and green growth. They are providing added momentum to 
China’s economic growth and creating a broader space for cooperation with 
corporates all around the world. These strengths have made China the most 
comprehensive, stable, and reliable link in many global supply chains. Looking to 
the future, China’s economy will retain great resilience and potential, and its high-
quality talent dividend will continue to deliver value. The long-term upside factors 
and drivers will have a sustained impact, and China’s capacity to implement 
macroeconomic policy will steadily increase. 
Considering these factors, our projections for China’s growth in 2025 and 
in the medium term are more positive than staff’s view. China still has ample  
macroeconomic policy space and has the capacity to support sustainable economic 
growth. For the foreseeable future, China will remain an important engine of global 
economic growth. While expanding domestic demand, China will continue to 
promote a high level of openness internationally. We will maintain stable and 
smoothly-flowing supply chains, and increase liberalization and facilitation for trade 
and investment. We will lead and promote healthy globalization and inject positive 
momentum into global economic growth. To this end, we recommend that staff 
conduct a full analysis of the upside factors in China’s economic growth to make a 
reasonable judgment of the medium-term growth path for China’s economy. This 
will also help to reinforce confidence in global economic growth. 
II. Policy Issues 
1. Monetary policy. We are glad to see staff’s assessment that China’s 
monetary policy in 2024 “is welcome.” In recent years, the Loan Prime Rate (LPR) 
reforms have made significant impact and the market-based adjustment mechanism 
for deposit interest rates has been effective. As a result, monetary policy 
transmission has become more efficient and the average financing cost has made a 
sustained decline. There is now a generally smooth transmission from the central 
bank’s policy rate to market benchmark rates and finally to specific market rates. 
Supply and demand for foreign exchange are generally balanced, the current account 
surplus is stable, foreign exchange reserves are sufficient, the RMB exchange rates 


 
4 
fluctuate in both directions, and expectations are stabilizing, with the RMB exchange 
rate remaining basically stable at an adaptive and equilibrium level. In its monetary 
policy practices, China has already implemented the recommendations made 
in the Staff Report for “additional monetary easing via interest rates, better 
monetary policy transmission, and greater exchange rate flexibility.” It is 
consistent with the policy orientation recommended in the report. 
Since the start of 2024, China’s macroeconomic policy has been focused 
on stability while attempting to make progress, and the sound monetary policy 
will be flexible, appropriate, targeted, and effective. First, liquidity is kept at a 
reasonable and adequate level. We have reduced the reserve requirement ratio 
(RRR) by 0.5 percentage point, which released over RMB 1 trillion in medium- to 
long-term liquidity. Financial institutions have been guided on providing credit loans 
in a more balanced manner and supporting the economy with stable and sustainable 
financing. Second, effort was made to steadily reduce the overall financing costs. 
The interest rates for central bank lending and rediscounts for agriculture and small 
business loans were cut by 0.25 percentage point. The LPR for loans of 5 years or 
longer was guided downwards by 0.25 percentage point. We also continued to 
promote liberalization of deposit interest rates. Third, the credit structure has 
improved. We established a central bank lending facility of RMB 500 billion to 
support technology innovations and upgrades, expanded the eligibility for small- and 
micro-loans for financial inclusion, and expanded the access to the carbon emission 
reduction facility (CERF). Fourth, a series of supportive policies to ensure 
delivery of housing units was introduced. These include the establishment of a 
central bank lending facility of RMB 300 billion for affordable housing projects, a 
reduction in the minimum downpayment ratio for residential mortgages at national 
level, the elimination of the minimum policy rate for residential mortgage rates at 
national level, and a 0.25 percentage point reduction in the rates of housing provident 
fund loans of all maturities. 
Looking to the future, China will strengthen the implementation of 
existing monetary policies. First, we will maintain liquidity at a reasonable and 
adequate level, guide towards a reasonable credit expansion and balanced supply of 
credit, and ensure that aggregate financing to the real economy (AFRE) and money 


 
5 
supply are commensurate with expectations of future economic growth and price 
levels. Second, we will promote a mild recovery of inflation and maintain prices at 
a reasonable level. Third, we will improve the market-oriented interest rate 
formation and transmission mechanism, expand the monetary policy toolbox, and 
let the central bank’s policy rate play the guiding role. We will also unleash the 
potential of LPR reforms and the market-based adjustment mechanism for deposit 
interest rates. These changes will help steadily reduce corporates’ and households’ 
financing costs. At the same time, as the economy recovers, we shall also monitor 
any changes in long-term yield. Fourth, we will ensure a smooth transmission 
mechanism for monetary policy and increase the efficiency of fund usage. Fifth, we 
will maintain the RMB exchange rate stable at an adaptive and equilibrium level, by 
adopting comprehensive measures, correcting deviations, and stabilizing 
expectations. We are committed to correcting procyclical behaviors, preventing one-
sided market expectation and its self-reinforcement, and resolutely avoiding the risk 
of overshooting. 
2. Fiscal policy. We thank staff for their recommendations on fiscal policy. 
However, we hold a different view on issues such as the “augmented” fiscal concept, 
the fiscal stance, and local government debt. 
On the fiscal stance, based on the “augmented” fiscal concept, the Staff Report 
noted that “the fiscal stance in 2023 was neutral” and “the 2024 budget also implies 
a broadly neutral fiscal stance.” But in reality, China has implemented a proactive 
fiscal policy during 2024, with policy measures reasonably strengthened and 
their efficiency improved. First, we have strengthened the fiscal policy adjustment. 
The 2024 budget deficit is set at 3 percent of GDP, i.e., RMB 4.06 trillion, which is 
RMB 180 billion higher than the 2023 budget. We plan to issue a total of RMB 3.9 
trillion of new local government special bonds (RMB 100 billion higher than last 
year) and RMB 1 trillion of ultra-long special treasury bonds. Most of the proceeds 
from the RMB 1 trillion additional government bonds issued in 2023 Q4 will be used 
this year. And we continue to implement our policy of reducing taxes and 
administrative fees in a more targeted and effective way. In January-May 2024, 
general budgetary revenue reached RMB 9.7 trillion, down 2.8 percent year-on-year. 
Last year, the collection of postponed tax payments from micro-, small- and 


 
6 
medium-sized enterprises (MSME) inflated fiscal revenue, and tax cuts announced 
last year took effect this year; when these special factors are discounted, comparable 
tax revenues have increased by 2 percent year-on-year. General budgetary 
expenditure for January-May stood at RMB 10.8 trillion, up 3.4 percent year-on-
year. Second, we have been strengthening fiscal support for major national strategies 
and basic livelihood. The implementation of our structural policy to reduce taxes and 
administrative fees continues. We are providing key support to the development of 
the high-tech and manufacturing sectors, stimulating large-scale updating of 
equipment and trade-in of consumer products, and expanding consumption in key 
sectors. Third, we are improving the coordination of fiscal policy with monetary 
policy, employment policy, etc., enhancing the consistency in macroeconomic 
policies, and improving the synergy of the policy mix. In 2025, our initial 
consideration is that China’s fiscal policy will maintain its positive stance. We 
will keep stability, continuity, and sustainability in our fiscal policy, and continue to 
send clear signals about stable and high-quality growth to stimulate vitality in the 
whole economy and boost momentum for economic growth. 
On local government debt, as of end-2023, the outstanding amount of 
official local government debt is RMB 40.74 trillion, which is within the limit of 
RMB 42.17 trillion approved by the National People’s Congress (NPC). Together 
with the RMB 30.03 trillion central government debt, the total outstanding 
government debt is RMB 70.77 trillion, equivalent to 56.1 percent of the 2023 GDP. 
This level of debt is lower than other major market economies and emerging market 
economies. 
There are two important features in China’s local government debt. First, 
it is generally used for investment in infrastructure, so the debt is mostly backed by 
physical assets and has positive externalities for the local economy. This feature 
fundamentally differs from other countries where government debt is used to finance 
current expenditures. Second, most local government debt is concentrated in 
provinces with strong fundamentals and growth momentum, which have the capacity 
to absorb the debt. For these reasons, the risk from local government debt in 
China is generally under control. In 2023, China launched a new policy of 
“effectively preventing and mitigating risks from local government debt, through the 


 
7 
development and implementation of a package to resolve debt issues.” Within the 
approved debt limit, a certain amount of government bonds would be refinanced, 
helping local governments, particularly those in high-risk regions, to resolve implicit 
debt and clear overdue payments to enterprises. This will help ease the pressure from 
concentrated debt repayment and reduce the interest burden. The guiding principle 
for local government debt is that “provincial governments assume overall 
responsibility, whereas municipal and county governments shall make every effort 
to resolve debt issues.” Every locality should contribute its own efforts and use all 
available resources to develop plans to address their debt issues and to gradually 
decide the specific action items. State-owned enterprises, including local 
government financing vehicles (LGFV), are market entities with responsibility for 
their own operations, risks, and balance sheets. On the question of resolving risks 
from LGFVs, China maintains the principle of separation between the government 
and enterprises. A process of categorization and differentiated resolution must be 
taken - if an LGFV has illegally raised financing on behalf of a local government, 
the debt is treated for resolution purposes as an implicit government debt, while if 
an LGFV has raised debt for operational purposes, we guide financial institutions to 
negotiate with the LGFV following market-based, rule-of-law principles, to resolve 
the debt risks by offering loan extensions, replacement, or refinancing. Through 
these differentiated paths, the risks from the stock of debt can be resolved. 
Revenue from land sales. The Staff Report comments on the impact of land 
sale revenue on local governments finances, saying, “reduced land sale revenues 
have further exacerbated pre-existing local fiscal gaps.” We recognize that the fall 
in land revenue may create stress for local government finances given it has been a 
major component of local government fund budgets. However, it must be stressed 
that land sale revenue is a gross revenue - as this revenue is reduced, there will also 
be a reduction in fiscal outlays on the associated costs, such as relocation 
compensation. For this reason, the fall in net revenue from land sales will only 
have a very minor impact on local government budgets. In 2023, the decline in 
national land sale revenue narrowed for 10 percentage points compared with 2022. 
In Q1 this year, national land sale revenue is RMB 814.7 billion, down 6.7 percent 
year-on-year. This fall was 20.3 percentage points smaller than last year’s huge drop. 


 
8 
We expect land sale revenue to further recover and stabilize in the upcoming 
future. On local government fiscal operations, in recent years, transfers from central 
government have reasonably increased. In 2024, transfers will total RMB 10.2 
trillion, representing a 4.1 percent increase in comparable payments when excluding 
one-off factors. This increase would cover the fiscal gap experienced by local 
governments from the fall in land sale revenue and can lend powerful support for 
local socio-economic development. The Chinese government is currently 
implementing three major housing projects: construction of affordable housing, 
redevelopment of “urban village,” and the development of dual-use infrastructure 
for regular use and for contingency. It is also speeding up the formation of a new 
development model for the real estate sector. These will make an important 
contribution to the high-quality economic development. At the same time, China is 
encouraging local governments to foster and develop new quality productive forces, 
making use of local resources, existing industrial base, and R&D capacity. Local 
governments are encouraged to actively foster new drivers for economic growth and 
to gradually reduce their reliance on land sale revenue. 
3. Preventing and Mitigating Financial Risks. Since the last consultation, 
there has been a reduction in China’s financial stability risks, which can be 
attributed to a number of actions targeting at the real estate market over the 
past few years and an improvement in the fiscal situation of local governments. 
The People’s Bank of China (PBC) and other financial regulators continue to prevent 
and resolve financial risks in key sectors such as real estate and local government 
debt. Reform and risk reduction in small and medium financial institutions is also 
gathering pace, and high-risk institutions are being effectively resolved. At the same 
time, the supply-side structural reforms of the financial sector are deepening, with a 
comprehensive enhancement of financial regulation, which takes concrete measures 
to enhance its effectiveness. At present, China’s overall financial risk is under 
control. Financial institutions are broadly running on a sound basis, financial 
markets are generally operating smoothly, frameworks safeguarding financial 
stability are working effectively, and the legal systems for the financial sector are 
being improved.

We thank the Fund for its focus and recommendations on China’s real 
estate market, and for its acknowledgement of the authorities’ policies on 
supporting housing demand and financing for developers, as well as guiding the 
transformation of the real estate markets. Many of the recommendations of 
staff are consistent with the policies already adopted. In recent years, the Chinese 
government has taken many actions to respond to the adjustment in the real estate 
sector. These include ensuring the delivery of housing units, so that pre-sold units 
will be completed and delivered, thus protecting the rights of home buyers, and 
creating a “whitelist” of in-construction projects eligible for government-supported 
financing to support real estate developers. Beginning in mid-May this year, China 
has further updated its real estate policies, and positive changes have already 
emerged in the real estate market. We expect that going forward, the real estate 
sector’s drag on the economy will continue to dissipate. In terms of demand, in 
January-May, the year-on-year fall in building starts for private residential housing 
was smaller than last year. Since June, there has been an upturn in activity in new 
housing and second-hand housing in some key metropolitan markets. In terms of 
supply, the credit crunch for developers has been eased. The year-on-year 
downward trend in the total floor area of both new starts and project completions 
have been flattening out for the past several months. Inventory reduction measures 
are starting to take effect, and the total unsold floor area has been falling for the past 
three months. It should be noted that any policy response takes time to have an effect. 
The real estate market is still undergoing an adjustment. China is actively 
implementing the policies already announced and will continue to study into new 
policies for reducing inventory and stabilizing the market. The execution of these 
policies will promote the stable and healthy growth of the real estate market. 
The Staff Report suggests that the “continued stress in the property 
sector” is a source of credit risk. However, in reality, the spillover from the 
adjustment in the Chinese real estate market to the financial system remains 
generally under control. Real estate loans make up 23 percent of outstanding bank 
loans, of which 80 percent are personal mortgages. China has always imposed highly 
prudent personal mortgage policies. On one hand, the downpayment for self-
occupied residential mortgages, which averaged at around 35 percent, could provide 


 
10 
a thick buffer. On the other hand, the regulators have imposed on banks a limit on 
the ratio of loans to the real estate sector and personal mortgages. For most banks, 
real estate loans make up less than 20 percent of their assets, which effectively 
controls the concentration risk. The credit quality of personal mortgage loans is 
closely connected to borrowers’ employment and income, and it is relatively 
unaffected by the volatility in housing prices. The non-performing loan ratio has 
long been kept at a low level of 0.5 percent. Real estate development loans are 
backed by pledged assets in the form of the land and the project under construction; 
there are also strict risk management requirements. Only a small number of 
developers or projects have encountered financial difficulties, and the overall impact 
remains under control. 
The Chinese real estate market has experienced a 20-year boom and is 
now undergoing a major transition as it seeks a new equilibrium. Currently, 
the overall housing demand has already stabilized, medium-term demand is 
well-supported, and there remains a strong foundation for long-term growth. 
After more than 20 years of high-speed growth, the demand for housing from 
Chinese residents has basically been satisfied in aggregated terms; however, there is 
still considerable space for improvements in the housing mix. As of 2023, China’s 
urbanization rate stands at 66.16 percent. This is still some distance from a mature 
level of urbanization of about 75 percent. There is a large population of new urban 
residents, meaning demand will be powerfully buoyed by the need for affordable 
housing, redevelopment of “urban village,” and infrastructure development. The 
desire of existing residents to upgrade their living conditions will also create a 
significant demand for redevelopment. As the decline in new home sales has been 
effectively set off by an increase in second-hand home sales, the overall demand for 
residential housing has been stabilized. As the macroeconomy and residents’ outlook 
improve, real estate developers’ ability to obtain financing will improve, and the 
stabilization of the real estate market will be further reinforced. Given the above, 
we recommend that staff fully consider these factors when making projections 
for housing demand in China to arrive at a reasonable judgment. 
On ensuring the delivery of pre-sold housing units, China continues to 
address the issues on a city-by-city basis through assigning responsibilities to 


 
11 
local governments, real estate developers, and financial institutions, so as to 
ensure that units are delivered and the legitimate interests of the home buyers 
are guaranteed. First, we are determined to ensure the delivery of pre-sold 
residential housing units and to prevent and mitigate risks of unfinished projects. 
Applying market-based and rule-of-law principles, we are categorizing and dealing 
with each instance of housing projects that have been sold but not yet delivered to 
their buyers. We are pushing for the completion and delivery of these units to fully 
ensure the rights and interests of the home buyers. Second, we are making full use 
of coordination mechanisms for urban real estate financing, helping project 
developers meet their reasonable financing needs. Municipal governments are 
encouraging projects that have been whitelisted to complete construction wherever 
possible, and commercial banks have been encouraged to provide financing to 
whitelisted projects wherever possible. Third, we are promoting the reduction of 
housing inventory. Municipal governments may organize local state-owned 
enterprises to purchase some inventory at reasonable prices as affordable housing in 
a demand-driven way. Fourth, we are ensuring the proper disposal or revitalization 
of existing land inventory. Land inventory that has not yet been developed, or on 
which construction remains unfinished, can be repurchased by local governments 
and resold on the market, or the developer may continue to develop it. These will 
help the developers reduce their own distress and debt, helping to ensure that land 
resources are used efficiently. Staff recommend that the authorities “deploy one-
off CG (Central Government) financing” to the real estate sector. We believe 
that we should continue to apply market-based and rule-of-law principles in 
completing and delivering these units, and at the same time safeguard the 
proper rights and interests of the home buyers. It would be inappropriate for 
the central government to directly provide fiscal support, as it could lead to 
expectation of future government bail-out and therefore moral hazards. 
4. Opening up the economy, international cooperation, and industrial 
policy. In recent years, China has actively promoted opening-up. We have 
established the new system for an economy with a higher level of openness, and 
continued to develop a business environment that is market-based, law-governed, 
and international. Additionally, China is comprehensively and deeply involved in 


 
12 
the reform of the World Trade Organization (WTO). It also firmly supports the 
stability of global supply chains, expands our partnerships with the Belt and Road 
countries, and resolutely opposes unilateralism and protectionism. Since 2023, 
China and the USA have established two working groups: the Economic Working 
Group and the Financial Working Group. China and the EU have also established a 
financial working group. These working groups are already operational and are 
advancing policy dialogues between China and the USA and the EU on issues of 
macroeconomics, monetary policy, and financial stability. China will continue to 
actively work through bilateral, regional, and multilateral channels, including the 
Fund, to cooperate with all partners. 
China is actively benchmarking against international trade rules, 
deepening domestic reforms in relevant sectors, and progressively increasing 
institutional openness in terms of regulations, administration, and standards. 
On external cooperations, we are proactively implementing high international 
standards and expanding our free trade zones. China currently has entered into 22 
free trade agreements with 29 countries and regions, covering one-third of our 
international trade. We are actively advancing negotiations on the ASEAN-China 
Free Trade Agreement (ACFTA) 3.0, our entry into the Comprehensive and 
Progressive Agreement for Trans-Pacific Partnership (CPTPP), and the Digital 
Economy Partnership Agreement (DEPA). Domestically, China is actively 
benchmarking international trade regulations and carrying out pilot projects for 
reforms in relevant fields. China is actively benchmarking against strict international 
standards such as the CPTPP and DEPA rules, and advancing corresponding reforms 
domestically, achieving positive results. 
The Staff Report suggested that “geoeconomic fragmentation pressures 
and rising geopolitical risks are also impacting trade and FDI flows in and out 
of China.” In 2023, actual utilization of foreign capital in China totaled USD 
163.25 billion. Despite some volatility, the figure is still high for the recent years. 
Many factors have contributed to the volatility: global cross-border investment has 
been low for several years, and increasing international competition has meant that 
flows of investment have become more scattered. Geopolitical factors as mentioned 
in the Staff Report are also interfering with normal decisions on cross-border 


 
13 
investment. It must be noted that investment by foreign companies is a market 
decision, and short-term volatility is a normal phenomenon, both in global aggregate 
terms and in terms of individual economies. Fundamentally, the trend of economic 
recovery and long-term growth in China has not changed. As new quality 
productive forces develop and a series of policies to stabilize the economy, 
promote growth, and attract foreign investment take effect, the environment 
for foreign investment in China will become only better. 
In August last year, the State Council issued Opinions on Further Optimizing 
the Environment for Foreign Investment and Increasing Efforts to Attract Foreign 
Investment, detailing 24 measures in six areas such as national treatment for foreign 
enterprises, protection of intellectual property rights, facilitation for business 
operations, and supportive tax policies. These measures will further improve the 
investment environment for foreign businesses and boost our efforts to attract 
foreign investment. China is now working to quickly implement all of these policy 
measures. In this Q1, we carried out a review on the implementation of the new 
policies through a questionnaire survey and roundtable to understand the feedback 
from foreign enterprises. For more than 60 percent of policy measures, 
implementation is complete or significant progress has been made. Over 90 percent 
of the responding foreign enterprises gave a positive assessment. In terms of 
movement of people, since 2023, China has introduced more than 20 new policies, 
facilitating foreign nationals to come to China to visit, work, and live. 
On industrial policy, China fully respects the decisive role of markets in 
resource allocation and has minimized direct government intervention in 
microeconomic activities. Subsidy policies are an example. Since its entry into the 
WTO, China has strictly complied with the WTO rules on subsidies. We are 
constantly improving our laws and regulations about the market economy and 
actively fulfilling our duty to report information on subsidy policies and to be 
transparent. China strictly complies with all commitments made to the WTO by 
ensuring that the level and form of subsidies implemented complies with WTO rules. 
China’s new emerging sectors are quickly growing, both because of our 
unique comparative advantages and the global trend of high-tech and green 
development. China is taking active actions to mitigate climate change, and we are 


 
14 
committed to our “dual carbon” targets. We are actively fostering green industries, 
including green energy, to help drive the green transformation of the economy. 
China has a vast market of more than 1.4 billion in population, comprehensive 
industrial systems, and rich reserves of human resources. Our consumers are happy 
to accept new technologies, giving corporates the perfect stage to innovate and 
iterate new products. Against this backdrop, the economies of scale enabling 
corporates to spread out the cost of innovation and the capacity to support different 
technologies and business models competing against each other are two of the major 
competitive advantages that China’s new emerging industries possess. 
The rise of new emerging industries illustrates the major and decisive role 
of companies in the innovation process. Companies are on the cutting edge of the 
market economy and are the most sensitive to changes in customer demand. As such, 
their impetus to innovate is the most pressing. To take new energy vehicles as an 
example: China’s new energy vehicle manufacturers recognized the opportunity for 
electric vehicles and invested heavily. China also proactively built out the 
infrastructure needed for electric vehicles, and in this way fostered the market and 
nurtured  economies of scale, and through a market process developed competitive 
electric car manufacturers. Multinational companies also compete and collaborate 
with local companies on a level playing field and have been an important force in 
the development of the industry. Tesla came to China precisely because China has 
the supply chain and infrastructure, and a market environment that allows for fair 
competition. The growth and competitiveness of China’s new energy vehicle 
industry is a result of market competition, not subsidies; and there is no 
overcapacity. Exports represent a much smaller proportion of China’s new energy 
vehicle production than some other major car manufacturing nations. In 2023, just 
12.5 percent of Chinese electric vehicles were exported. 
To take the semiconductor sector as another example: the semiconductor 
sector is a highly globalized industry, and for decades, China’s companies 
maintained a mutually beneficial relationship with partners in the semiconductor 
sector in other countries. A dense interlinkage between the upstream and 
downstream, from which all parties benefited, formed over the years. This was the 
natural result of the resource allocation and market processes. But for some years, 


 
15 
the USA has stretched the concept of national security and abused its export control 
systems to impose a cordon around China, restricting China from the global 
semiconductor market. It has artificially fragmented global semiconductor supply 
chains, forcing China to develop its own semiconductor industry. With the benefit 
of China’s huge market, the Chinese semiconductor industry has achieved 
significant growth already, and is contributing to China’s trade surplus. The 
exploration of cutting-edge technologies should not be a zero-sum game, but a 
process of shared growth. Attempts to decouple or taking a “small yard, high fence” 
approach will only increase the cost of operations, create geoeconomic 
fragmentation, and stir up greater opposition. China is committed to eliminating 
unreasonable regulations that limit market access and fair competition. We 
hope that the Fund, after thorough consultations with the WTO, will objectively 
analyze the different backgrounds that inform the industrial policy of each 
country, and will continue to be an active supporter of multilateralism and a 
facilitator of multilateral cooperation. 
5. Climate change. China has made a serious commitment to achieve carbon 
neutrality and has created a policy system around the peak carbon emission and 
carbon neutrality targets, as well as developed a strategy for controlling greenhouse 
gas emissions over the medium- to long-term. The national emissions trading system 
(ETS) was launched in July 2021, and is now operating smoothly. Two compliance 
periods (2019-2020 and 2021-2022) have successfully concluded, in alignment with 
expectations. Currently, the ETS represents 5.1 billion tons of annual CO2 emissions 
and includes 2,257 key emitters. It is the largest carbon trading system in the world 
by amount of greenhouse gas emissions. In 2024, the allowance price in the ETS has 
been steadily trending upwards. China also continued to develop our systems for 
combating climate change with the release in 2023 of Action Plan for the Control of 
Methane Emissions and its supporting regulations. We also issued Administrative 
Measures for the Trading of Voluntary Reductions in Greenhouse Gas Emissions 
(Trial), which provides a framework for trading and other activities around voluntary 
emissions cuts. In January 2024, we launched the national registration and trading 
systems for voluntary emissions cuts.  


 
16 
China is also making major efforts to develop non-fossil and renewable 
energy technologies, and our green/low-carbon energy transition is picking up 
pace. China is the world leader in wind, solar, hydro, and nuclear generation capacity, 
and renewable energy now represents more than 50 percent of China’s total installed 
capacity. Between 2013 and 2023, the ratio of non-fossil fuel energy consumption, 
including wind power, solar, hydroelectricity, nuclear, and biomass power, rose 
from 10.2 percent to 17.9 percent. Electric vehicles, lithium-ion batteries, and 
photovoltaics manufactured by Chinese companies have satisfied China’s domestic 
demand, and are expanding the supply on the international market, making a 
contribution to the global response to climate change. 
China continues to enhance the financial sector’s support for green/low-
carbon development, making substantial progress in developing green finance. 
China already has a multi-layered green finance market focused on green loans and 
green bonds. We are also actively working towards compatibility between Chinese 
and international standards, so that domestic and global instruments and services in 
green finance are compatible and interoperable. This will facilitate cross-border 
investment by both domestic and international investors. As of the end of Q1 2024, 
China has the world’s highest total green loans, at about RMB 33.8 trillion, up 35.1 
percent from the previous year. China’s outstanding green bonds have surpassed 
RMB 1.98 trillion, putting China in second position globally. In 2021, the PBC 
launched the carbon emission reduction facility (CERF), a structured policy 
instrument offering financial incentives to financial institutions for extending loans 
to the sectors that are more aggressive in reducing emissions. As of the end of March 
2024, CERFs are backing over RMB 770 billion in emission reduction loans, making 
it a highly successful initiative. The Chinese authorities are expanding the list of 
financial institutions that have access to the CERF scheme, and now 13 foreign 
financial institutions are included in the CERF. This represents an expansion and 
internationalization of the scheme and ensures that financial institutions are equally 
receiving national treatment. 
Staff recognized the progress made by China in the implementation of 
our climate goals and China’s role as a global leader in the supply of renewable 
energy and deployment of renewable energy technologies. We welcome this 


 
17 
understanding. We welcome the incisive analysis by staff on climate issues and 
encourage staff to continue to offer policy recommendations within the multilateral 
consensus of the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change, the Paris 
Agreement, and WTO rules. China is willing to accept the principle of common but 
differentiated responsibilities, and to continue to play an active and constructive role 
in multilateral and bilateral climate discussions and cooperative actions. We will 
contribute our wisdom and our strength to the construction of a global system of 
climate governance that is fair, rational, and cooperative. 
Additionally, China has always fully complied with our agreements and 
commitments to the Fund on data disclosure and provision. Even so, China will 
continue to expand our data collection, and improve data quality and transparency, 
to better support the needs of policymaking. During the First Deputy Managing 
Director Gopinath’s visit to China in November 2023, an MoU on statistical 
cooperation was signed between the Fund and China’s National Bureau of Statistics 
(NBS). This agreement is now in steady operation. This July, a seminar was co-
organized by the Fund and the Ministry of Finance of China to exchange views on 
the “augmented” fiscal concept, laying the ground for building common 
understanding between the two sides. On January 10 of this year, the Executive 
Board discussed the Staff Report for the 2023 Article IV Consultation with China, 
in which the youth employment data was one of the concerns. In our written 
statement, we pointed out at the time that the volatility in these data has always been 
too great, and data quality low. The NBS had therefore suspended the publication of 
these data and took action to improve the statistical methodology, and we were 
expecting the resumption in due course. Shortly after the Executive Board discussion, 
publication of the data resumed on January 17. These examples demonstrate that 
China is determined to improve on data issues. 
Finally, we would like to thank once again Ms. Gopinath, First Deputy 
Managing Director; Mr. Srinivasan, Director of the Asia and Pacific Department 
(APD); Mr. Helbling, Deputy Director of APD; Ms. Jain-Chandra, Mission Chief; 
Mr. Klein, Deputy Mission Chief; and all of the China team for their diligent work 
and professionalism during the 2024 Article IV Consultation. We also thank the

Managing Director Kristalina Georgieva for her consistent support for the 
cooperation between the IMF and the Chinese authorities.

IMF Executive Board Concludes 2024 Article IV Consultation 
with Indonesia 
FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE 
Washington, DC – August 7, 2024: On July 22, the Executive Board of the International 
Monetary Fund (IMF) concluded the 2024 Article IV consultation1 with Indonesia and the 2024 
Financial System Stability Assessment. 
Indonesia’s prudent fiscal, monetary, and financial policy frameworks have provided the 
foundations for macro-stability and social gains. Decisive policy actions facilitated a robust 
recovery from consecutive global shocks since 2020. Indonesia’s growth remains strong 
despite external headwinds, inflation is low and well-contained, the financial sector is resilient, 
and policies are generally prudent and geared towards preserving buffers. 
The outlook remains positive despite a challenging global context. Growth would reach 
5.0 and 5.1 percent in 2024 and 2025 respectively, with dynamic domestic demand offsetting 
the drag from softer commodity prices. Inflation is projected to converge to the mid-point of the 
target range over time. Real exports would expand at a slower pace while import growth would 
recover in line with domestic demand, leading to moderate current account deficits in 2024-25. 
The balance of payments surplus will continue to strengthen over time, reflecting a pickup of 
FDI and portfolio inflows, supporting a further buildup of reserve buffers. 
Risks are broadly balanced. Commodity price volatility (e.g., from geopolitical shocks), a 
slowdown in Indonesia’s key trading partners, or spillovers from high-for-longer policy rates in 
advanced economies (AEs) are important external downside risks. On the domestic side, a 
weakening of long-standing sound macro-fiscal frameworks could hamper policy credibility. 
On the upside, stronger-than-anticipated growth in trading partners, or an 
earlier-than-expected monetary policy easing could strengthen growth; deeper-than-envisaged 
structural reforms could raise growth over the medium term. 
Executive Board Assessment2 
Executive Directors welcomed Indonesia’s strong economic performance, substantial buffers, 
and track record of prudent policies. They concurred that risks are broadly balanced in the 
near term, while noting significant uncertainties from tighter global financial conditions, 
geopolitical tensions, and commodity price volatility. 
Directors welcomed the authorities’ commitment to fiscal discipline. They considered that 
slightly narrower deficits in 2024 and 2025 would support growth while preserving fiscal space 
to help respond to downside risks. They saw scope for strengthening the fiscal framework to

team visits the country, collects economic and financial information, and discusses with officials the country's economic developments 
and policies. On return to headquarters, the staff prepares a report, which forms the basis for discussion by the Executive Board.

and this summary is transmitted to the country's authorities. An explanation of any qualifiers used in summings up can be found here:

allow more countercyclical policies within the budget cap. Directors supported efforts to 
strengthen revenue mobilization and streamline energy subsidies to create room for 
development spending needs within the fiscal rule.  
Directors welcomed the reduction of inflation to the target range and agreed that the monetary 
policy stance should remain data dependent, with a flexible exchange rate acting as a shock 
absorber. They concurred that foreign exchange market interventions should be judiciously 
deployed under certain shocks and circumstances, mindful of preserving reserve buffers. A 
few Directors encouraged the authorities to provide foreign exchange intervention data. 
Directors supported efforts to deepen financial markets and strengthen the effectiveness of 
monetary policy transmission. 
Directors welcomed the 2024 FSAP’s assessment that the financial system is broadly resilient 
and well-capitalized. They encouraged continued progress in strengthening financial sector 
supervisory and regulatory frameworks, the financial safety net, and crisis management, as 
well as close monitoring of pockets of potential vulnerabilities. Directors welcomed efforts to 
enhance the macroprudential policy framework and saw merit in clarifying the primacy of 
financial system resilience as the objective of macroprudential policy. They encouraged a 
gradual tightening of the macroprudential stance as the credit gap closes. Further 
strengthening the AML/CFT framework remains important. 
Directors welcomed the authorities’ goal of reaching high-income status by 2045. They noted 
that achieving this in an inclusive manner will require ambitious structural reforms, including 
on governance and anti-corruption, leveling up learning outcomes, logistics and infrastructure, 
fostering trade openness, and enhancing social protection. Directors agreed that transitioning 
away from non-tariff trade measures would be critical to support inclusive growth and global 
economic integration, while industrial policies should target market failures, minimizing trade 
and investment distortions.  
Directors welcomed the authorities’ commitments to achieve net-zero emissions by 2060 and 
the steps taken to limit greenhouse gas emissions and deforestation. A plan for off-grid power 
generation, energy subsidy reforms and carbon pricing, and phasing out related non-tariff 
measures would be key to achieving climate goals.

INDONESIA 
STAFF REPORT FOR THE 2024 ARTICLE IV CONSULTATION 
 
KEY ISSUES 
Outlook and Risks. Indonesia’s growth remains strong despite external headwinds. 
Inflation is firmly in the target range and the financial sector is resilient. The authorities 
have been pursuing an ambitious growth agenda to reach high-income status by 2045. 
This comprises public spending, institutional reforms, and Industrial Policy (IP). Risks are 
broadly balanced. Key downside risks include persistent commodity price volatility (e.g., 
from geopolitical shocks), an abrupt slowdown in Indonesia’s key trading partners, or 
adverse spillovers from tighter-for-longer global financial conditions. On the domestic 
side, a weakening of long-standing sound macro-fiscal frameworks could hamper policy 
credibility. On the upside, stronger-than-anticipated growth in trading partners or faster 
disinflation in AEs could prop up growth while deep structural reforms would raise growth 
over the medium term.  
Main Policy Recommendations 
• 
Indonesia’s longstanding fiscal prudence should be preserved. A slightly narrower 
deficit would support both growth and a more balanced policy mix. The fiscal rule’s 
budget cap of 3 percent of GDP has served Indonesia well. An enhanced 
medium-term fiscal framework (MTFF), with well-defined operational targets, would 
help ensure that fiscal policy can act counter-cyclically within the fiscal rule more 
systematically. Prioritizing revenue mobilization—through ambitious reforms 
encompassing tax administration and policy—would strengthen fiscal space to 
significantly boost needed development spending while still meeting the fiscal rule. 
Closely monitoring fiscal risks and avoiding the buildup of contingent liabilities will 
also be key. 
• 
The monetary policy stance is appropriate. The policy rate is above neutral; with 
financial risks contained, accommodative macroprudential policy has supported credit 
growth while liquidity remains comfortable. Monetary policy should remain 
data-driven, based on the evolution of domestic conditions, and the exchange rate 
serving as a shock absorber. Foreign Exchange Intervention (FXI) would be 
appropriate under certain shocks and circumstances, particularly when shocks trigger

spikes in market premia given shallow FX markets, though its use will need to be mindful of 
preserving reserve buffers. Market development and policy effectiveness would be bolstered by 
greater price discovery and an increasingly market-determined interest rate term structure.  
• 
Further financial sector reform would protect resilience and enable sound financial market 
deepening. Clarifying that financial system resilience takes priority amongst objectives as the 
macroprudential toolkit is calibrated would enhance communication and effectiveness. Bolstering 
financial sector regulation and supervision, the financial safety net, crisis management, and 
systemic liquidity and resolution frameworks are key aspects of the agenda. Developing the credit 
infrastructure to foster sound financial access—including of digital financial services—and 
continuing to address remaining gaps in the Anti-Money Laundering and Combating Financing of 
Terrorism (AML/CFT) framework would also be important. 
• 
Bridging structural gaps will be needed to achieve higher and inclusive potential growth 
and reach high income status, as envisaged in the country’s national development 
strategy—the Golden Vision 2045. Horizontal structural reforms, including strengthening 
governance and anti-corruption, leveling up education and skills, enhancing health and social 
protection, investing in logistics and infrastructure, fostering openness, and bolstering the 
business environment will be essential to boost broad-based growth. Carefully designing IP to 
target market failures and avoid trade and investment distortions should help strengthen its 
benefits and reduce costs, helping prevent risks of hindering potential growth. Transitioning away 
from non-tariff barriers will also be critical to sustain strong and inclusive growth while 
supporting global economic integration.

CONTEXT: BALANCING GROWTH AND STABILITY 
1.      
Indonesia’s longstanding strong economic performance owes much to its prudent 
macroeconomic policies, yet more is needed to sustainably lift inclusive growth. The country 
has enjoyed over two decades of high growth and macroeconomic stability while making steady 
progress in poverty reduction and increasing social and economic inclusion. Prudent fiscal, monetary, 
and financial policy frameworks provided the foundation for such sustained gains. Decisive policy 
actions facilitated a robust recovery from consecutive global shocks since 2020, while policy pivots 
since then have underlined commitments to sound frameworks and to rebuilding and sustaining 
buffers. The economy ranks among the twenty largest in the world, thanks to support from steady 
growth, natural resources, a strategic geographical location, and a large young population. Yet 
income per capita is relatively low, underscoring the importance of closing remaining human, 
physical, and institutional capital gaps to strengthen medium-term growth. 
 
 
 
2.      
Indonesia’s ambition is to achieve high-income status by 2045. The country’s national 
development strategy—the Golden Vision 2045—aims to transform Indonesia into a high-income 
country by the centennial of its Independence. The aspiration is to increase value added by moving 
through the value chain from raw commodities, build a skilled population ready for the digital age, 
and accelerate infrastructure development and institutional reform to support balanced, green, and 
equitable growth. A new administration headed by President-elect Prabowo Subianto, set to take 
power in October 2024 for a five-year term, has pledged to continue this agenda. Achieving this 
vision will require broad and sustained structural reforms,1 while safeguarding hard-earned gains on 
macroeconomic stability.

RECENT DEVELOPMENTS: RESILIENT GROWTH AND 
PRUDENT POLICIES AMID GLOBAL UNCERTAINTIES  
Growth has proven resilient and inflation is within the central bank’s target range. Policies have 
remained generally prudent and geared towards preserving buffers, in line with past Fund 
recommendations. 
3.      
Economic growth was strong in 2023 despite external headwinds. Real GDP growth 
reached 5.0 percent, led by resilient private consumption and investment. Net exports lost 
momentum driven by falling commodity prices and trading partner demand. Economic activity 
indicators were robust in 2024Q1 as spending toward the February Presidential election and 
Ramadan fostered domestic demand (Figure 1). Growth was broad-based, with the mining, 
transportation, communication, and accommodation and food services sectors performing above 
historical average; however, agricultural production weakened due to El Niño droughts. 
 
 
 
4.      
Economic indicators point to the persistence of some slack. The output gap is estimated 
to have been -0.3 percent of potential GDP in 2023, albeit with high uncertainty on the size and 
speed at which it is closing. Capacity utilization is yet to pick up firmly to pre-pandemic levels 
(73.9 percent in 2023 vs. 75.6 percent in 2019, Figures 1-2). Unemployment stood at 5.3 percent by 
end-2023, nearing the pre-pandemic rate (5.2 percent in late 2019). However, other measures of 
labor market conditions suggest some persistent, albeit declining, slack: the share of workers in 
full-time or formal employment is lower than pre-pandemic, the rate of under-employed workers 
remains higher and core inflation, while having inched up slightly (to 1.9 percent yoy in May and 
June, relative to 1.8 percent in April) remains below the mid-point of the inflation target range. 
Vulnerable employment has steadily increased since 2015.2 Real and nominal wages have continued 
to recover, and most wages now exceed their 2019 levels.  
 
2 The vulnerable employment estimate by the International Labor Organization (ILO) refers to the sum of 
(i) own-account workers (i.e., without employees) and (ii) contributing family workers (i.e., unpaid family workers).

Inflation is well within its target band. Appropriately tightening monetary policy settings, 
alongside administrative measures3 helped bring inflation down from its 2022 surge. December 2023 
core and headline inflation were at 1.7 percent and 2.8 percent respectively, within Bank Indonesia’s 
(BI) target band (3±1 percent). Inflation indicators remain within the updated 2024 target range 
(2.5±1 percent),4 with readings of 2.5 percent and 1.9 percent of headline and core inflation in June, 
respectively. Recent pressures stemmed from volatile components—food, beverages, and tobacco—
including due to El Niño shock, though volatile food inflation softened in May-June. Inflation 
expectations remain well-anchored. 
 
 
 
 
3 The government stabilizes food prices by coordinating with ministries, the state logistics agency (BULOG), BI and 
trade associations. This involves: (i) monitoring of food prices, (ii) signed and monitored agreements on ceiling prices 
for key foodstuffs; (iii) improvement and subsidy support of ports and ship routes to relieve bottlenecks.  
4 BI’s target range is defined periodically under a Cooperation Agreement between BI and the Ministry of Finance. 
This establishes targets for a specific period, consistent with a gradually lower inflation target over time.

Indonesia's external position in 2023 was broadly in line with the level implied by 
medium-term fundamentals and desirable policies (Annex I). The current account (CA) balance 
moved from a surplus of 1 percent of GDP in 2022 
to a narrow deficit (0.1 percent of GDP) in 2023, 
led by a broad-based decline in commodity prices 
(particularly affecting coal, palm oil, and 
mining-related exports). This was partially offset 
by lower import values of oil, gas, and raw 
materials. The services account improved slightly, 
as foreign tourist arrivals nearly doubled relative 
to 2022. Following net outflows in 2022, portfolio 
investment flows initiated a recovery towards 
end-2023,5 which more than offset a decline in 
net FDI inflows, leading to a surplus in the capital 
and financial account in 2023 (0.7 percent of GDP), and to an overall balance of payments (BoP) 
surplus. However, portfolio outflows reemerged in early-2024, reflecting the heightened volatility in 
global financial markets. 
 
 
 
7.      
Foreign reserves remain adequate. Gross International Reserves (GIR) rose from 
US$137 billion in 2022 to US$146 billion (10.7 percent of GDP) in 2023 and are at 123 percent of the 
Assessing Reserve Adequacy (ARA) metric. Through 2023 and in early 2024, the rupiah has faced 
episodes of high volatility, largely in reaction to market uncertainties about the future path of U.S. 
monetary policy (including given increasingly compressed interest rate differentials with the U.S. 
throughout the yield curve) and the rising tensions in the Middle East. BI has responded with a mix of 
tools; these have included policy rate hikes of 25 bps in both October 2023 and April 2024 (with the 
stated objective of pre-emptively taming inflation passthrough), and foreign exchange intervention 
(FXI) in the spot and derivatives markets to address heightened exchange rate (ER) volatility.6 The 
issuance of new BI short-term securities (in local and foreign currency) since Fall 2023 has sought to

dampen pressures by deepening the market and attracting foreign investors. The authorities also 
made changes to the existing export repatriation requirements for commodity producers.7 Net 
international reserves (NIR) strengthened by US$4.8 billion year-on-year in 2023, even as BI’s short 
positions on FX derivatives nearly doubled through to a still moderate US$14.3 billion by end-year.8 
Indonesia’s de facto ER arrangement is classified as floating.

Overall financial conditions remain accommodative. Standard indicators point to an 
accommodative financial stance amid a still open credit gap (Figure 7). Bank lending interest rates 
and equity prices were broadly unchanged since 2023, while house prices declined in real terms. 
Sovereign and corporate spreads gradually narrowed. Private sector credit by banks expanded by 
10.4 percent y/y in 2023, and by 13.1 percent y/y in April 2024. This reflected a broad-based increase 
across types of loans, and borrowers. The authorities phased out the last remaining 
pandemic-forbearance measures end-March 2024.9 
ROBUST OUTLOOK AMID BALANCED RISKS 
The baseline forecasts entail a broadly positive outlook with balanced risks; medium-term prospects are 
solid but could be further strengthened by tackling structural priorities. 
9.      
Growth is projected to remain high, and inflation well-anchored. Real GDP growth in 
2024 is projected at 5.0 percent, supported by an increase in public consumption and investment 
growth offsetting the continued drag on net exports due to external headwinds (including lower 
commodity prices and weaker trading partner growth); the output gap would remain negative, and 
fully close by 2026. Growth would pick up slightly to 5.1 percent in 2025, on the back of a fiscal 
 
7 Government Regulation No.36 of 2023 (effective 1 August 2023), mandates that  natural resource exports proceeds 
valued more than US$250,000 or the equivalent (fob) be repatriated and at least 30 percent (net of the exporter’s FX 
obligations) of the repatriated funds be retained within the Indonesian financial system for at least three months; 
there are no currency conversion requirements; exporters may use the repatriated funds for FX swap transaction with 
banks or as a collateral to get IDR loans from banks if there are needs for rupiah for their domestic business activities; 
there are no limitations on how the exporter could use such IDR loans.

expansion. Headline inflation would stabilize around the midpoint of its updated target range. Real 
exports would expand at a slower pace while import growth would recover (in line with domestic 
demand), leading to moderate CA deficits in 2024-25. Overall, the BoP surplus would continue to 
increase gradually, reflecting a pickup in FDI and portfolio inflows, and supporting a further buildup 
of reserve buffers (Tables 1-10). 
10.      Near-term risks to the outlook appear broadly balanced (Annex II). They imply 
two-sided risks both to growth (Annex IV) and inflation. 
• 
Downside risks include persistent commodity price volatility due to supply and/or demand 
disruptions (e.g., linked to conflicts or trade restrictions) or an abrupt global slowdown or 
recession in Indonesia’s key trading partners (China, the U.S.). Slower-than-envisaged AE 
disinflation momentum resulting in higher-for-longer global interest rates, or a systemic financial 
instability episode (causing spikes in interest rates, risk premia, and asset repricing) could trigger 
capital outflows and disorderly market conditions. On the domestic side, a weakening of 
long-standing sound macro-fiscal frameworks could hamper policy credibility.  
• 
Upside risks include stronger-than-anticipated growth in China and other trading partners or 
faster-than-expected disinflation in AEs leading to more frontloaded policy rate cuts by central 
banks, which would reinforce the growth momentum.10 A faster and/or deeper implementation 
of needed horizontal structural reforms could also strengthen growth (see Section E and 
Structural Reform SIP). 
11.      Medium term growth prospects remain strong relative to regional peers, though 
contained by prevailing structural gaps. Medium-term growth is estimated at about 5 percent, 
driven by strong private consumption and investment (supported by contained inflation and the 
authorities’ Golden Vision that foresees strong public investment in connectiveness, in particular). 
Lifting medium term growth beyond this, in a sustainable and durable way, would require a broad-
based expansion across sectors (Section E), and a comprehensive structural reform strategy that 
increases productivity growth, bolsters production factors (i.e., infrastructure and a skilled workforce), 
tackles institutional weaknesses (including on governance and corruption), and continues 
strengthening global trade and financial integration. Such reforms would also reduce or overcome 
pandemic-related scarring,11 and enhance resilience against structural global risks—such as those 
linked to the global energy transition and climate change,12 the deepening of geoeconomic 
fragmentation (GEF) and the deployment of AI-based technologies. 
Authorities’ Views 
12.      The authorities broadly shared staff’s views on the overall outlook and assessment of 
risks. In the near term, they consider growth could be stronger under the baseline, expecting a range 
 
10 See, for example, the World Economic Outlook WEO of January and April 2024.  
11 See 2023 Article IV Consultation, IMF Country Report No. 23/221.

green transition (see the World Bank’s Indonesia Country Climate and Development Report, CCDR). 


INDONESIA 
INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND 11 
between 4.7-5.5 percent in 2024 and 4.8-5.6 percent in 2025.13 This would be driven by domestic 
consumption and investment. The output gap is still open and expected to close by end-2025. Over 
the medium term, they expect growth to gradually rise further towards the objective of 6-7 percent 
as a result of their transformation strategy under the 2045 Golden Indonesia Vision. Inflation remains 
well-anchored, reflecting BI’s pro-stability monetary policy and the government’s prudent fiscal 
stance, administered prices and supply policies, including coordinated efforts between central and 
local governments. The authorities remain vigilant of the risks posed by the future path of U.S. 
Federal Funds rate, and global geopolitical tensions that could have potential spillovers on the 
domestic economy, especially on the exchange rate, inflation and economic growth. The authorities, 
however, have reservations about domestic policy actions being a downside risk. They have 
consistently applied a sound macroeconomic framework and remain committed to doing so, thereby 
maintaining policy credibility. 
POLICIES: SAFE TRANSIT TO THE GOLDEN VISION 
Preserving a sound and prudent macro-fiscal framework in the near and medium term will be critical 
for Indonesia to achieve its long-term ambition. Development spending priorities for 2025 and beyond 
should be anchored by an ambitious revenue mobilization reform and accommodated well within the 
guardrails set by Indonesia’s longstanding fiscal rule. The monetary policy stance is appropriate and 
should remain data-driven, based on the evolution of domestic conditions, with the exchange rate 
serving as a shock absorber. While Indonesia has ample policy space, this should be carefully managed 
to preserve buffers in a global shock-prone environment; use of FXI would be appropriate under certain 
shocks and conditions. Bridging structural gaps will be key to achieve higher and inclusive potential 
growth and reach high income status.  
A.   Fiscal Policy: Lifting Potential Growth while Protecting Credibility 
13.      Following a decisive post-pandemic consolidation, Indonesia’s fiscal position further 
strengthened in 2023, while remaining growth friendly. In line with the country’s post-pandemic 
fiscal consolidation path, the overall deficit narrowed from 2.4 percent of GDP in 2022 to 
1.61 percent of GDP in 2023, anchored by the first primary surplus (0.5 percent of GDP) in about a 
decade. The outturn was below the original budget and the fiscal rule deficit cap (2.9 and 3 percent 
of GDP, respectively). Revenue overperformance more than offset a slight spending overrun.14 Total 
spending was moderately above budget (0.2 percent of GDP), including from higher capital spending 
and transfers to subnational governments (SNGs). Social assistance stabilized at 0.8 percent of GDP, 
 
13 This incorporates overlapping ranges for the Ministry of Finance (5.0-5.3 percent in 2024 and 5.1-5.5 percent in 
2025) and Bank Indonesia (4.7-5.5 percent in 2024 and 4.8-5.6 percent in 2025). 
14 As of end-2023, tax revenues from trade and manufacturing were about 50 percent of total tax revenues, while the 
contribution of mining activities was around 11 percent. 


INDONESIA

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND 
and the energy subsidy bill fell slightly 
relative to 2022. The public debt-to-GDP 
ratio continued its decline, reaching 
39.6 percent of GDP by end-year—
comfortably within the fiscal rule’s 
public debt ceiling (60 percent of GDP). 
14.      The fiscal stance is projected 
to become expansionary in 2024. 
Following three years of consolidation, 
the 2024 deficit would expand to 
2.3 percent of GDP, still within the fiscal 
rule guardrail.15 The resulting fiscal 
impulse (estimated at 0.8 percentage 
points of GDP) implies an expansionary 
fiscal stance. A slightly narrower deficit 
would continue to support growth and 
protect the vulnerable while also helping 
preserve fiscal space to respond to downside risks. Given staff’s projected revenues, containing 
spending to around budgeted levels for 2024 would be consistent with a somewhat less 
expansionary stance; efforts to enhance the targeting of energy subsidies would not only help 
achieve the recommended stance, while enhancing price incentives in the use of energy and protect 
vulnerable groups. 
15.      The fiscal stance would remain moderately expansionary in 2025, gradually 
consolidating thereafter—and support a stable debt-to-GDP ratio over the medium-term. The 
draft 2025 Government Work Plan16 underpinning the 2025 Budget proposes a deficit of 
2.45-2.8 percent of GDP, which could come close to the 3 percent ceiling. Staff projects a deficit of 
2.6 percent of GDP, implying a moderately expansionary fiscal impulse (0.3 percentage points of 
GDP). A slightly narrower fiscal stance would be more appropriate as the output gap closes and 
given the need to preserve fiscal space in a shock-prone global environment. The 2025 deficit is 
expected to accommodate key campaign pledges by the elected administration, which would be 
partially offset by revenue mobilization and spending reallocation. Revenue mobilization efforts 
could rely on the implementation of measures (including those identified by Fund technical 
assistance) that would bring yields in the near and medium term (text table). This could be 
complemented with some spending reallocation, including from streamlined and better targeted 
energy subsidies. The authorities envisage the deficit to narrow from 2026 onwards to maintain 
public debt stable at under 40 percent of GDP. They expect a broadened tax base thanks to 
improved compliance enforcement to deliver revenue gains; further outlining concrete tax measures 
to anchor a strengthened revenue path would be important. Ongoing consideration to gradually roll 
 
15 Given that revenues tend to overperform, staff projects higher revenues in 2024 relative to the budget. The higher 
revenues, in turn, are expected to accommodate higher spending than budgeted. 
16 This is based on the “Policy Settings” for the 2025 Budget published on May 20, 2024. The final measures 
recommended will be defined based on this document.

in new emerging priority spending—including the “Nutritious Meal for Kids” program—and ensuring 
it is well-targeted and effective is welcome, as this approach would foster effectiveness while helping 
preserve fiscal prudence. As the authorities focus on lifting potential growth, fiscal policy should aim 
to provide structural support; relying on pro-cyclical support for this purpose could lead to 
overheating in the economy and pose a burden for monetary and external policies. 
16.      Fiscal and debt risks remain contained. The Sovereign Risk and Debt Sustainability 
Framework (SRDSF) points to an overall “low” risk of sovereign stress (Annex III); staff assess 
Indonesia to have some fiscal space. Aside from a 
generally prudent deficit path, public debt 
sustainability is supported by a favorable interest 
rate-growth differential, highlighting the 
importance of preserving Indonesia’s good 
standing in global financial markets. Beyond 
broad fiscal prudence, strong domestic revenue 
mobilization efforts would help limit the debt 
service-to-tax ratio over the medium term. Budget 
financing is largely domestic, with external loans 
and FX-denominated government securities 
meeting about a quarter of the public gross 
financing needs (GFNs), which are moderate at around 5 percent of GDP. The share of local currency 
public debt held by domestic entities (excluding BI) was at 67 percent as of end-January; this limits 
rollover risks, but exposes banks and Non-Bank Financial Institutions (NBFIs) to sovereign debt 
repricing shocks, although banks appear broadly resilient (¶27). Public-Private Partnerships (PPPs), as 
well as below-the-line operations with state-owned enterprises are expected to rise, including to 
finance infrastructure (e.g., the construction of the new capital city, Nusantara). Preventing the 
buildup of actual and contingent liabilities related to these operations will be key to keep fiscal risks 
at bay.17 
17.      Indonesia’s current fiscal rules are well-suited to support its ambition, especially if 
complemented with further fiscal structural reforms to open further fiscal space. The rules 
provide an appropriate, well-understood and credible framework, which can help accommodate 
evolving spending priorities; however, evidence on the cyclicality of Indonesia’s fiscal policy is mixed 
(Annex VI). The deficit rule provides a sound guardrail, which should be complemented with an 
enhanced Medium-Term Fiscal Framework (MTFF), articulated with the annual budget and long-term 
fiscal plans, supporting a well-calibrated medium-term objective (MTO) set up on a (multi-year) 
rolling basis to help support more systematic counter-cyclical policymaking that is also compliant 
with the rule. Further rationalization of current spending—including energy subsidies—and measures 
to prioritize domestic revenue mobilization would release substantial fiscal space to support the 
evolving development needs within the rule, particularly given Indonesia’s low tax-to-GDP ratio 
 
17 The government reported US$22 billion (1.6 percent of GDP) in outstanding public guarantees on infrastructure 
programs, including US$6.5 billion in guarantees for PPPs as of 2023Q3 (BI, Feb 2024). This compares to outstanding 
guarantees of US$23 billion including PPPs for US$6.4 billion as of 2022Q3 (BI, Feb 2023). The actual stock of PPPs is 
estimated at US$22 billion (1.3 percent of GDP).

(below). While the debt cap (60 percent of GDP) is also broadly appropriate and Indonesia’s 
debt-to-GDP ratio is low, its debt-service is high (at about 2 percent of GDP), and the share relative 
to public revenues is higher than peers (Figure 5). Bringing the fiscal deficit close to its ceiling on a 
protracted basis could erode fiscal space through rising debt service payments; this highlights the 
importance of securing upfront tax revenue mobilization.  
18.      A comprehensive medium-term fiscal structural strategy would be critical to help 
achieve Indonesia’s ambition, both to secure fiscal resources to boost spending while keeping a 
sound macro-fiscal stance, and to deploy them in an effective, transparent, and targeted manner. 
• 
Revenue Mobilization. Indonesia’s tax-to-GDP ratio has been persistently low and lags that of 
EM peers. The elected administration has pledged to raise total revenue by 10 ppts from 
13 percent of GDP, although detailed measures and timelines are yet to be specified. Proposals 
include establishing a new National Revenue 
Agency (NRA) and improving collection 
processes through digitalization.18 Plans to 
establish NRA should be carefully designed, 
as such restructuring may prove costly; 
achieving net gains in tax collections will 
require tackling the fundamental tax 
administration gaps. International experience 
shows that enhancing key aspects of revenue 
administration—including compliance risk 
management (CRM), the use of third-party 
data, digitalization, broadening taxpayer 
bases, and securing appropriate staffing—would be important (Annex VII). Revenue efforts 
should also encompass an ambitious tax policy reform; besides fully implementing the 2021 
Tax Harmonization Law, it would be critical to update the Medium-Term Revenue Strategy 
(MTRS)—including by further strengthening direct and indirect taxes, and minimizing leakages 
from tax incentives.19 Revisiting existing tax expenditures (currently estimated at 1.7 percent of 
GDP) and ensuring that tax holidays and incentives remain limited will be critical to prevent the 
erosion of the tax base and secure improved tax revenues over the medium term.20 
 
18 The authorities plan to expand the tax base by strengthening compliance and improving tax administration. They 
are also assessing a range of tax policy measures based on their distributional and economic impact. 
19 The IMF previously advised on a MTRS which has been partially implemented; more recent technical assistance is 
providing further options. See Appendix V of the 2022 AIV Staff Report (Country Report No. 2022/084) and 
Appendix IV of the 2020 AIV Staff Report (Country Report No. 2021/046). 
20 Tax expenditures are linked mostly to VAT (by tax type), households (by beneficiary), and the processing industry 
(by sector) (MoF Tax Expenditure Report 2022). The mining sector accounts for only 1 percent of total tax incentives 
on average, while the processing sector (including downstreaming activities) accounts for 24 percent of total 
incentives on average (~0.4 percent of GDP annually).

Expenditure policy. Efforts to help achieve the 
Golden Vision could include broadening the 
coverage and adequacy of social protection 
programs (which are low compared to peers); 
and moving from commodity- to 
people-based assistance (see 2023 Article IV 
Consultation). Boosting the quality of health 
and education spending and addressing 
infrastructure gaps are also important 
(section E). An energy subsidy reform, 
including via a more automatic alignment of 
retail fuel prices with international prices, 
would open space to attend these needs.21 Stated plans by the elected administration to 
enhance efficiency via better targeting of subsidies are welcome.

Fiscal and Debt Risk Management. Given the gradually rising portfolio of PPP and public 
guarantees to support infrastructure development, fiscal risk management should be enhanced 
in line with recent Fund TA advice. In the short-term, PPPs may create relief in terms of 
government budget outlays but have long-term fiscal implications and can affect fiscal and debt 
sustainability. Enhancing the currently fragmented process to evaluate PPPs and issue fiscal 
guarantees by providing the MOF a stronger ‘gatekeeping’ role is needed. Continuing to 
strengthen the fiscal accounts to ensure they provide a comprehensive view of fiscal activities of 
the general government (GG) activities and of implicit liabilities will be key to keep fiscal risks at 
bay.22, 23 
• 
Decentralization. Indonesia’s fiscal decentralization has steadily gained momentum, with 
important mandates devolved to SNGs since 2000. Recent 2022 legislation seeks to strengthen 
SNG taxation and spending outcomes, minimize vertical and horizontal fiscal imbalances, and 
optimize public service delivery. PFM weaknesses remain, including execution gaps (e.g., SNGs 
often carry forward unspent resources from inter-governmental transfers). SNG tax bases are 
narrow, and limit the scope to raise local revenues. Tackling these gaps will be critical for SNG’s 
to support the achievement of Indonesia’s goals soundly and effectively.

19.      The authorities underscored that fiscal policy would remain prudent in the near term. 
They broadly shared staff’s baseline assessment on the fiscal stance in 2024-25. They indicated that 
they have flexibility for adjustment, thanks to built-in automatic spending adjustment mechanisms 
that can be used to release fiscal space, as well as budget contingencies deployed if near-term 
downside risks materialize. The preliminary underpinnings for the draft 2025 budget prioritize capital 
expenditure to support durable growth. Potential new spending priorities—including the “Nutritious 
Meal for Kids” program—would be decided by the new administration but the authorities expect 
these to be rolled out gradually and accommodated well within the 3 percent deficit limit via 
expenditure reprioritization—this may include enhancements in the targeting of energy subsidies. 
They agreed that strengthening tax revenues is crucial for bolstering fiscal space and are analyzing a 
menu of tax measures based on their economic and distributional impact, as well as enhancements 
to the revenue administration. They considered that their financing and debt management strategy 
has served them well, while noting that it remains flexible, including to opportunistically tap into 
cheaper foreign financing. 
20.      The authorities remained committed to preserving fiscal policy credibility over the 
medium term. They saw the 3 percent deficit ceiling as an important policy anchor that has 
contributed to macro-stability. They saw merit in complementing the rule with an enhanced 
 
22 Investments to SOEs in the form of equity injections to accelerate infrastructure development should be recorded 
as below-the-line financing. Transfers to SOEs to cover losses, however, should be classified above the line as capital 
transfers if the receiving SOE is a market entity, or as capital grants if it is a government unit (i.e., non-market SOE) 
under the Government Finance Statistics Manual (GFSM) 2014, and reflected in the deficit and debt levels. 
23 If a statutory body or SOE is determined to be a non-market unit then it needs to be consolidated it as part of the 
GG (as an extrabudgetary unit) according to the GFSM 2014.

medium-term fiscal framework. They broadly concurred with staff’s assessment of fiscal risks and 
debt sustainability and agreed that boosting fiscal revenues will be key to accommodate 
development spending within the guardrails of the fiscal rule. The authorities argued that tax 
incentives provide important support to the development of higher value-added activity under the 
growth agenda. They agreed that developing a credible roadmap for identifying and addressing tax 
administration gaps should be a priority for the new administration. They remained committed to 
keeping fiscal risks contained through enhanced management, including in the context of PPPs and 
below-the-line equity injections to compensate SOEs for quasi-fiscal operations. 
B.   Monetary Policy: Securing Price Stability 
21.      The monetary policy (MP) stance remains broadly adequate. Bank Indonesia (BI) hiked 
the policy rate by 25 bps in April 2024 to 6.25 percent—following a 25 bps off-cycle hike in October 
2023. The two rate hikes were intended to fend-off possible imported inflation pressures from rupiah 
depreciation in the context of geopolitical tensions (including in the Middle East) and heightened 
external monetary policy uncertainty, including from higher-for-longer policies in AEs contributing to 
increasingly narrow interest rate differentials and the global US dollar appreciation. The real policy 
rate is above its estimated neutral level of 1-2 percent. With financial risks contained, 
macroprudential policy (MPPs) has been kept accommodative to support credit growth, and liquidity 
remains comfortable. The authorities have noted that their policy path would remain cautious given 
external risks. Given persistent uncertainties, the MP path should remain data-driven and supported 
by a flexible ER serving as a shock absorber. With inflation further softening in May and June, and 
absent significant shocks that raise inflationary pressures, gradually easing the monetary policy 
stance would seem appropriate. A tighter-than-baseline monetary policy path may be warranted if 
upside inflation risks begin to materialize, including because of a more expansionary fiscal policy 
stance than currently expected. If inflation falls faster than envisaged—e.g., due to a larger or more 
protracted than estimated output gap—a faster pace of interest cuts may be warranted. Continued 
clear communication of the outlook for monetary policy and the overall policy mix will help markets 
navigate uncertainties and would further anchor inflation expectations. 
 
 
 
22.      The ER should continue to play its role as a shock absorber. With Indonesia’s inflation 
expectations well-anchored and low FX balance sheet mismatches, the shallow FX markets remain 


INDONESIA 
18 
INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND 
the most relevant friction under the Fund’s Integrated Policy Framework, IPF (2023 Article IV 
Consultation, and Section D and Annex X below). Continued ER flexibility would help deepen 
domestic markets (¶23). FXI is a warranted component of the policy response under certain shocks 
and circumstances. BI indicated its decision to use FXI in the spot and derivatives markets in the 
external stress episodes of October 2023 and April 2024. These episodes took place in the context of 
rising UIP premia. While FXI data is not public, significant movements of the ER during both 
episodes, along with monetary policy rate hikes, point to the authorities pursuing multiple channels 
of adjustment. Indonesia’s reserves are within the ARA range, and while NIR has declined somewhat 
since end-2023, BI has appropriately unwound FX derivatives following strain episodes. Exploiting 
risk-on episodes to further replenish reserve buffers is welcome. The 2023 change to the export 
repatriation regulation is assessed as a Capital Flow Measure (CFM) under the Fund’s Institutional 
View on the liberalization and management of capital flows. The macroeconomic impact has been 
modest (at around ½ percent of GDP in GIR); data thus far point to exporters holding marginally 
more than strictly required, likely reflecting the convenience of new instruments with attractive 
returns and fiscal incentives. Staff recommends that the authorities gradually phase out this measure, 
with due regard to market conditions. 
 
 
 
 
 
23.      BI’s efforts to foster market development and enhance reserve buffers could be 
bolstered to enhance policy effectiveness. In 2023, BI introduced a short-term local currency 
instrument (SRBI) and mirroring FX-denominated open market instruments to facilitate money 
market development and attract capital flows into the short-end of the curve. The outstanding stock 
of the SRBI—which BI utilizes to pursue its “pro-market” open market operation strategy to affect 
yields (Figure 6)—stands at about IDR 558 trillion (US$34 billion), of which some 73 percent was held 
domestically, as of end-May 2024.24, 25 The outstanding stock of SRBI has grown significantly larger 
than the stock of T-Bills (about IDR 17 trillion).26 The domestic money, government securities, and FX 
 
24 BI phased out in September 2023 its “Operation Twist”, which involved selling short-term and purchasing long-term 
government bonds, with tenors of five years and above. This was explicitly designed to raise yields in the front sector 
of the curve to make it more attractive to non-resident investors. The SRBI is intended to influence government bond 
yields at the short-end in a market-based manner. 
25 The outstanding stock of the new FX instruments is moderate. 
26 The ratio of SRBI to T-Bills is large when compared to similar ratios for regional peers where both the central bank 
and government issue at the short end of the curve, though the stock of T-Bills has been declining since 2018. 


INDONESIA 
INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND 19 
markets still present some segmentation, calling for BI’s relatively frequent and broad presence. 
Further developing markets while preserving stability will require allowing for strengthened price 
discovery and an increasingly market-determined term structure of rupiah interest rates. While any 
FXI use will need to balance multiple considerations, an important benefit of a restrained approach 
to FXI would be to further raise incentives for private sector hedging and FX market deepening. 
 
 
 
 
24.      Clarifying BI’s role in crisis situations would continue to safeguard MP independence 
and predictability. BI has phased out its pandemic-era primary market purchases of government 
securities. The framework for future such purchases has been clearly restricted by the Financial Sector 
Omnibus Law (FSOL) to crisis episodes. Looking forward, ensuring that implementing regulations are 
in line with international best practices to maintain central bank independence and price stability 
would be key. Safeguards include ensuring any such purchases are made voluntarily at the initiative 
of the central bank.27 With part of the stock of pandemic bonds starting to fall due, careful 
management would help avoid market disruptions as it unwinds. 
Authorities’ Views 
25.      The authorities view the monetary policy stance as broadly neutral. It maintained 
inflation and Rupiah exchange rate stability. They underscored that, in line with BI’s Policy Mix 
framework, the monetary policy stance is not determined only by the policy rate, but also by the 
policy settings to maintain adequate liquidity—including MPP. In conjunction with BI's policy stance, 
the monetary liquidity conditions are loose as reflected in ample liquidity, thus supporting conducive 
lending rates and accelerating intermediation in various sectors. The MPP stance, in the context of a 
negative credit gap and contained financial risks, has supported intermediation to high-priority 
sectors. The authorities intend to maintain the data-driven approach in monetary policy to guard 
Rupiah stability. BI is pursuing a pro-market strategy for deepening of liquidity in both rupiah and FX 
markets, further portfolio inflows, and strengthen policy transmission effectiveness. This strategy 
includes the introduction of the SRBI, and is aligned with the Blueprint for Money Market 
Development (BPPU) 2025. The authorities view the FSOL as building adequate safeguards to limit

Principles for Emerging Markets and Developing Economies during COVID-19 and Beyond,” IMF, October 2021.

primary market purchases by BI to handling financial system instability caused by crisis conditions. 
The implementing regulations will be prepared under the principle of 3T (targeted, temporary, and 
transparent) to further ensure central bank independence. Regarding the maturing bonds purchased 
during the pandemic, the authorities will ensure that the unwinding process is conducted in a 
gradual and orderly manner to avoid market disruptions.  
26.      The authorities disagreed with the classification of the export repatriation regulation 
as an outflow capital flow measure (CFM). The regulation change is not aimed at managing 
cyclical capital flows, but at addressing structural issues by ensuring the earnings from Indonesia’s 
natural resource exports are available as part of the FX liquidity in the banking system to support the 
country’s economic resilience, economic growth and welfare. The regulation has been designed to 
avoid disruptions to exporters’ activities, as it applies to FX earnings net of FX obligations. The 
authorities have also introduced several financial instruments, alongside fiscal incentives, to make 
repatriating funds attractive. They view the repatriation requirement as instrumental in shifting 
exporters’ perspectives and incentives to place the FX export proceeds onshore, thereby contributing 
to the deepening of the domestic financial market. They have underlined that the measure will be 
periodically assessed and refined as needed.  
C.   Financial Sector Policies: Preserving Stability and Supporting Growth 
27.      The financial system is broadly resilient; systemic risk is assessed as moderate and 
broadly unchanged from last year (2024 FSAP). Banks dominate the financial system, are 
profitable, and their capital buffers and liquidity coverage ratios remain well above regulatory 
minima. Credit growth has recovered to pre-pandemic rates. A tightened “bank-sovereign nexus”—
due to holdings of sovereign bonds and SOE lending—poses risks, but banks appear resilient. There 
has been progress in implementing the 2017 FSAP recommendations (Table 12). The financial system 
is broadly resilient to solvency risks from contagion and to system-wide liquidity stress. The 
authorities should expand data coverage of key interlinkages to enhance monitoring as the financial 
system develops. These include banks’ cross-border exposures, institution-level NBFI-bank 
exposures, and bank-NFC linkages. 
• 
Banking sector. Overall resilience rests on strong capital and liquidity buffers; though there are 
pockets of vulnerability for small banks in adverse scenarios. Liquidity Coverage Ratios (LCRs) 
should be made mandatory for all banks, and FX risk monitoring further enhanced. 
Non-Performing Loans (NPLs) are low at 2.3 percent of total loans (April 2024); further 
strengthening guidance and supervision should help ensure NPLs are recognized on a timely and 
full basis, including following the phasing out of the pandemic forbearance, which will also help 
contain the risks of zombification (Annex VIII).  
• 
NFCs. NFCs appear resilient and overall vulnerability indicators have strengthened (Annex VIII). 
Weaknesses remain in sectors hard-hit by the pandemic and amongst smaller publicly listed 
firms. The persistence of unproductive and unviable (zombie) firms, however, may delay a 
necessary creative destruction and negatively affect the prospects for long-term productivity 
growth. Although the share of listed zombie firms seems to have declined recently, it remains 


INDONESIA 
INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND 21 
above pre-pandemic levels, while also standing somewhat above other regional peers. More 
generally, NFCs’ external debt exposures have fallen from 16.8 in 2015Q3 to 8.5 percent of GDP 
at end-2023—a notable improvement relative to peers. The authorities’ prudential FX and 
liquidity policies have helped contain FX exposures, which are closely monitored.28 Expanding 
granular data coverage of large firms (listed and non-listed) as well as small and medium 
enterprises (SMEs) will support monitoring and risk assessment.  
• 
Households. Household leverage is low, with debt-to-GDP at 16.3 percent (2023Q3). About 
30 percent of bank lending is to households, about 2 percent of which are NPLs. Given the 
sector’s ongoing expansion—including via mortgages—further strengthening the monitoring of 
loans to households by expanding indicators (e.g., LTV and DSTI for origination and outstanding 
stocks of household debt) and assessing risks across the income distribution would support the 
identification of emerging vulnerabilities. 
• 
NBFIs. The sector is small (about 24 percent of the financial system’s assets in 2023), with limited 
interconnectedness. However, risks are rising for the insurance sector due to inadequate 
premium management and risk transfer practices. As the NBFI sector and its interconnections 
could grow rapidly with financial deepening efforts, it would be prudent to develop a framework 
to understand and reduce future systemic risks. 
28.      Recent financial sector reform has entailed substantial progress; some areas could be 
further strengthened. Enhancing independence of the financial supervisor (OJK) and the resolution 
authority and deposit insurer (LPS), and providing clarity on OJK’s primary supervisory objectives is 
important. Further enhancing supervisory effectiveness, for example by continuing to improve the 
risk assessment methodology, better integrating certain supervisory activities, and intensifying 
scrutiny in assessing corporate governance and risk management practices, would be welcome. 
Bolstering the financial safety net, crisis management, and systemic liquidity frameworks is needed; 
the resolution framework should be further aligned with the Financial Stability Board’s (FSB) Key 
Attributes. 
29.      BI actively relies on a broadly defined MPP toolkit, which could be shifted to a more 
neutral stance as the credit gap closes. BI’s toolkit reflects a three-pronged strategy for MPP: 
financial system resilience, balanced and sustainable intermediation, and financial inclusion. 
Clarifying that financial system resilience is prioritized as BI calibrates the broad toolkit, including 
whenever the three objectives may compete with each other, would be important. Separating the 
elements of the current toolkit which do not have financial resilience as their main focus (e.g., into a 
sustainable and balanced-growth toolkit), would strengthen effectiveness and foster clear 
 
28 There are prudential regulations that limit banks’ net open FX positions and corporates are subject to a minimum 
hedging requirement of 25 percent that applies to their short-term net foreign currency liabilities with a maturity up 
to 3 months and between 3-6 months, and a minimum FX liquidity ratio of 70 percent that applies to their liquid 
foreign currency assets as share of short-term foreign currency liabilities (with maturities less than three months). The 
hedging and liquidity requirements on non-financial corporates have been assessed as both capital flow management 
measures as well as macroprudential policy measures (i.e., CFM/MPMs) under the Fund’s Institutional View. The 
authorities have advised that this measure is not a CFM, and moreover, that the classification of this measure as an 
MPM does not correspond to the definitions within their own MPP toolkit.  


INDONESIA 
22 
INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND 
communication. BI’s current accommodative MPP stance is intended to foster sustainable credit and 
economic growth in the context of contained financial risks, and help counterbalance a monetary 
policy rate setting geared towards safeguarding rupiah stability. Looking forward, with potential 
downside macro-financial risks on the horizon (Annex IV), gradually shifting MPPs towards a more 
neutral stance as the credit gap closes would help contain the build-up of risks, further supporting 
the banking system’s strong capital and liquidity positions. This, alongside the recommended 
narrower-than-projected fiscal deficits and gradual reductions to the monetary policy rate, would 
support an appropriate rebalancing of the overall policy mix.  
30.      Financial digitalization has grown fast since the pandemic, assisted by the authorities’ 
development efforts. BI established the Indonesia Payment System Blueprint (BSPI) 2025 to support 
the digitalization agenda, which includes the introduction of standardized QR codes (QRIS) in 2019 
and modernized real-time payment system (BI-FAST) in 2021. The expansion of financial 
digitalization has been broad (e-money, mobile banking, fintech P2P lending and digital investment), 
albeit from a small scale. Continued efforts to narrow digitalization and financial literacy gaps would 
support P2P lending growth (Annex IX). OJK should continue strengthening the regulatory and 
supervisory approach to new financing models to ensure business resilience and consumer/investor 
protection. The authorities should develop adequate cooperation arrangements for the regulation 
and supervision of information technology-based financial services, consistent with the FSOL. 
31.      The authorities should continue addressing the outstanding gaps in their Anti-Money 
Laundering/Combating the Financing of Terrorism (AML/CFT) framework. The 2023 Mutual 
Evaluation Report by the Financial Action Task Force (FATF) of Indonesia’s AML/CFT regime found 
the legal framework is strong and broadly effective. Key areas for further progress include improving 
risk-based supervision for non-financial sectors, imposing effective and dissuasive sanctions in all 
sectors, and applying targeted financial sanctions for terrorist financing-related activities. It will also 
be important to ensure that accurate information on ultimate beneficial owners of legal persons is 
available to law enforcement.  
Authorities’ Views 
32.      The authorities agreed with staff that systemic risks are well contained. They continue to 
carefully monitor risks to the banking sector and undertake regular stress tests. As per regulations, 
banks continue timely and complete reporting each month of their financial positions, including 
NPLs, which has helped ensure asset quality is accurately reflected as the forbearance measures were 
removed. The authorities agreed with staff that the risks from cross-sectoral and cross-border 
exposures are contained, and agreed that BI’s and OJK’s ongoing collaborative efforts to strengthen 
the monitoring of such interlinkages will ensure resilience as the financial system further develops. 
OJK has taken steps to resolve risk management practices in the insurance sector. The authorities 
underlined the importance of continuing to strengthen the AML/CFT regime. They also stressed their 
efforts in enhancing financial literacy and inclusion, including by closing the digital divide and 
enhancing the regulatory and supervisory framework. 
33.      The authorities emphasized that safeguarding financial stability is the ultimate 
objective of macroprudential policy (MPP). They noted that BI’s three-pronged MPP strategies 


INDONESIA 
INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND 23 
complement each other in maintaining financial stability as outlined by Warjiyo and Juhro (2019), 
namely through: (i) the balanced intermediation strategy, which addresses procyclicality that reflects 
time varying and countercyclical dimensions; (ii) the financial resilience strategy, which mitigates 
systemic risks associated cross sectional dimension that is associated with interconnectedness, 
potential spillovers and contagion, as well as common risk factors within the financial system; and (iii) 
the financial inclusion strategy, which supports financial stability by diversifying economic 
participation of broader economic segments, thereby reducing concentration risk and strengthening 
financial system structure. 
34.      The authorities see this framework as particularly relevant in the domestic context. This 
is evidenced by its support of the financial sector’s stability during the pandemic, aligning more 
closely with the broader context of emerging markets than the narrower definition provided by the 
IMF. Furthermore, these policy strategies are mandated by the FSOL, which represents a milestone in 
financial sector reform initiated consensually by financial sector authorities. The robust framework 
embodies important lessons learned from concerted efforts during the pandemic to strengthen 
financial stability and mitigate future financial crisis. 
D.   Policies to Manage Near- and Medium-Term Risks 
Indonesia will need to navigate a more shock-prone world. Potential adverse shocks, including those 
emanating from the two largest economies—China and the U.S.—could have significant spillovers 
through trade, commodity prices, and financial markets. Identifying the appropriate policy mix to 
address emerging shocks would depend on the specific nature of the shock, the economy’s structural 
characteristics and frictions, and the need to preserve buffers. 
35.      Indonesia has strong fiscal and financial buffers—as well as robust policy frameworks— 
to respond to adverse shocks. If downside risks materialize, the available fiscal space can be used in 
a targeted way to preserve priority development spending, including to support the vulnerable. 
Inflation is well-anchored and financial sector risks contained, leaving scope for monetary policy to 
balance risks to inflation, output, and financial 
stability. In the context of an integrated policy 
framework (IPF), appropriately adjusting the 
standard macroeconomic policy settings and 
allowing the ER to play a shock absorbing role 
will be key (Annex II). 
36.      The assessment of Indonesia’s key 
frictions remains unchanged from that in 
2023—centering on the persistence of 
shallow FX markets.29 These may warrant the 
use of FXI in response to shocks triggered by 
 
29 Indonesia does not appear to face significant frictions related to unhedged FX balance sheet exposures and has 
well anchored inflation expectations (see 2023 Article IV, Appendix V). 
 


INDONESIA 
24 
INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND 
sudden changes in investor risk appetite that could lead to capital outflows and large ER 
depreciation, exemplified by a sharp increase in the country’s uncovered interest parity (UIP) 
premium. UIP premia have risen in Indonesia through 2023 and early 2024, reflecting the impact of 
global uncertainties in the domestic market.  
37.      A model-based analysis is used to help gauge the appropriate policy mix that could 
help Indonesia tackle possible downside scenarios (Annex X). The analysis focuses on a subset of 
risks—adverse growth shocks in China or policy shocks in the U.S., which may impact Indonesia 
through worsening terms of trade (including lower prices for Indonesia’s commodity exports), and 
potentially trigger risk-off shocks. The appropriate policy response will need to be calibrated to the 
nature and duration of the shock, supported by enhanced communication, with FXI appropriate in 
the context of risk-off episodes. While inflation expectations are well-anchored and currency 
mismatches on private sector balance sheets contained, FXI may also be warranted in the face of 
large shocks that trigger severe depreciation, which if not moderated, could set off non-linear 
responses for inflation and threaten financial stability.30 
38.      The use of fiscal and reserve buffers will need to keep future needs in mind. Preserving 
buffers and keeping some powder dry will be particularly important in a world where GEF is likely to 
lead to a prolonged period of more frequent and volatile external shocks, including to capital flows 
and commodity prices.  
Authorities’ Views 
39.      The authorities agreed with staff’s assessment on the need for carefully designed 
policy responses in the face of external volatility. They also underscored Indonesia’s well-
established track record of prudently navigating shocks and strong policy buffers. BI’s policy mix, 
combined with fiscal efforts if needed, has the necessary instruments to address external stress while 
protecting domestic stability. The authorities appreciate staff’s continuing engagement on the IPF. 
Alongside the conditions described in staff’s simulations, they view FXI as also warranted based on 
early pressures on the FX market given substantial uncertainties faced by policymakers in 
determining the nature and duration of the shocks in real time, and the risks of non-linearities that 
could affect expectations. Integrating MPPs as an important part of the toolkit to sustain optimal 
intermediation while safeguarding financial stability, should be considered in staff’s analysis as well.  
E.   Achieving High Income: A Structural Reform Program 
40.      Achieving the Golden Vision and reaching the high-income status by 2045 will require 
growing high, for long. Estimates suggest that reaching this goal will require an annual nominal 
GNI growth rate of 8 to 9 percent, roughly equivalent to 6-7 percent real annual growth (assuming 
annual inflation around 2 percent), sustained over two decades (see text chart for details). 
 
30 For example, Caselli and Roitman (2019) find that the rate of exchange rate passthrough becomes non-linear when 
the exchange rate depreciates by more than 24 percent in a sample of EMs. 


INDONESIA 
INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND 25 
41.      Comprehensive horizontal structural 
reforms are essential to bridge important gaps 
and help meet Indonesia’s ambitions for strong 
and broadly shared growth (see Structural 
Reform SIP). 
• 
Strong and sustained growth episodes have 
typically been accompanied by broad 
improvements in structural areas. Historical 
evidence indicates that prolonged 
high-growth and fast income convergence 
episodes were underpinned by: (i) sound and 
robust structural initial conditions, and (ii) improvement in horizontal structural areas along the 
convergence process. Analysis reveals Indonesia’s structural gaps in areas such as governance, 
infrastructure, human capital, labor resilience, export complexity, and economic openness, 
compared to both its current peers and where these historical success growth cases started (SIP 
and Box 1). 
• 
Horizontal structural reform can have a positive, significant effect on output. Regression 
analysis provides further evidence that packaging reforms yields better output outcomes, human 
development aspects are key to boost growth (for EMs and AEs), and a major “first-generation” 
structural reform package31 could raise output levels by around 1.5-2 percent after two years, 
relative to baseline (i.e., would help to bring annual growth up to around 6 percent from the 
current 5 percent). These results point to key reform priorities and a possible sequencing of 
structural reforms in Indonesia (Box 1, Table). 
42.      Facilitating private sector activity will be essential to lifting potential output growth. 
Supporting Indonesia’s attractiveness to FDI would help mitigate GEF risks: securing transparent, 
simple, and predictable investment and business frameworks could build resilience against reshoring 
pressures and attract new investment flows. In addition, there is a critical role for the domestic 
private sector to support inclusive, broad-based growth. More agile and productive NFCs could 
further contribute to raising growth. In addition, micro, small, and medium enterprises (MSMEs) are 
estimated to contribute over 60 percent of Indonesia’s GDP, and absorb 97 percent of Indonesia’s 
workforce; boosting their performance and productivity is essential to achieve the Golden Vision (see 
SIP on MSMEs).  
• 
Indonesian firms face operational constraints. There is room to enhance business, labor 
market, as well as credit market regulations and credit infrastructure that currently hamper 
private sector activity and competitiveness. Indonesia’s MSMEs are confronted with infrastructure 
deficits, and face credit barriers32 (especially younger firms) which impacts their performance. 
 
31 This would include reforms on external sector regulation, governance, and business regulation reforms, to which 
human development reforms are added.  
32 For instance, only 76 percent of small firms have a checking or saving account, in contrast to 91 percent of large 
firms that have one (see SIP on MSMEs). 
 


INDONESIA 
26 
INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND 
Trade barriers, particularly non-tariff measures (NTMs), impose a burden on Indonesian 
businesses and discourage FDI (Annex XI). 33  
• 
The reform agenda should lift these barriers to ensure the private sector can help boost 
growth sustainably. Bolstering logistics performance and infrastructure should be a key aspect 
of the reform agenda,34 There is a need to foster greater economic openness, improving the 
regulatory frameworks (such as on product market regulation and trade facilitation), and 
lowering NTMs. Improving insolvency frameworks would contribute decisively to stimulating 
private investment from healthy firms, therefore lifting productivity and potential growth in 
Indonesia (Annex VIII). Continuing to strengthen governance (through an improvement of the 
rule of law, such as enhancing contract enforcement and the protection of property rights) and 
anti-corruption frameworks (including institutional effectiveness of the anti-corruption agency, 
the judiciary, and the asset declaration system) would support accountability and business 
certainty. 
43.      Indonesia’s growth acceleration strategy rests on enhancing the value-added down the 
chain from raw commodities through Industrial Policy (IP). IP was first deployed on nickel ore—
where Indonesia has a commanding global market share. The strategy was supported, inter alia, by 
fiscal incentives and NTMs, and has helped increase exports of refined nickel and FDI into the 
e-battery/e-vehicle value chain. The authorities plan on extending the strategy to a further range of 
commodities.35,36 Given Indonesia’s diversified economic structure, expanding IP to other 
commodities and relying only on a group of sectors to drive real GDP growth to 6-7 percent could 
prove challenging. Further risks stem from global uncertainty and the challenges of mitigating 
potential IP related distortions. Simulations suggest that reaching a real GDP growth rate of 
7 percent in the next five years will require leading sectors to grow consistently well above their 
five-year moving average growth, while the rest of the economy would need to continue growing at 
some 5 percent in real terms throughout the period.37 Durably lifting growth will require a significant 
and sustained broad-based expansion of the economy, supported by comprehensive horizontal 
reforms. These reforms would have important complementarities with IP (to creating a competitive 
 
33 NTMs comprise a broad set of measures, including import and export restrictions, import licensing, and local 
content requirements. NTMs add up to an average tariff equivalent that is relatively higher than peers in the region; 
also trade facilitation in Indonesia is below OECD country median (see World Bank, Indonesia Economic Prospects, 
2022). 
34 This could help reduce resource misallocation towards productive firms, particularly MSMEs; see Hsieh and Klenow 
(2009). 
35 See 2023 Article IV. Aside from restrictions on exports of nickel ore, barriers were extended to other commodities 
(e.g., bauxite and copper) in mid-2023. There is no evidence that this extension has attracted FDI, given Indonesia’s 
relatively more limited position as a global producer/exporter, and as key producing/exporting firms were granted 
exemptions on such restrictions. 
36 The authorities have discussed up to 21 commodities in total, although specific plans (and toolkits) are yet to be 
detailed. Aside from metals, commodities include crude palm oil and fisheries. 
37 Anchoring higher long-term growth on specific technology-dependent value chains will also need to contend with 
emerging new technologies and competitors, and with risks of commodity stock depletion.

business environment that is critical for IP success, and improving human capital, which will be 
needed to upgrade value added and attract FDI). 
 
 
 
44.      As IP is deployed, it will be important to use careful design to minimize risks to growth. 
While IP can be beneficial if targeting well-identified market failures in a time-bound and 
cost-effective way, it also comes with potentially high fiscal costs, as well as risks of rent-seeking and 
resource misallocation that can best be mitigated with strong governance frameworks. These 
trade-offs should be carefully assessed, also to protect competition and innovation, and avoid 
distortions and adverse cross-border spillovers. Transitioning away from the use of NTMs will be 
critical to supporting global economic integration, and avoid limiting growth opportunities for firms 
and reducing the private sector’s nimbleness, which could ultimately hamper both trade and 
growth.38  
45.      The recently published Comprehensive Investment and Policy Plan (CIPP) for on-grid 
power generation is an important step in the right direction, and further reforms will support 
the green transition. The overall national climate mitigation strategy is appropriately focused on 
forestry and land use (FOLU), where abatement costs are low (see 2023 Article IV Consultation). 
Strong enforcement and monitoring will be critical to ensuring that the mitigation efforts in FOLU are 
credible, given risks of illegal deforestation and enforcement gaps. At the same time, off-grid power 
generation is heavily reliant on coal and is currently under expansion to meet the IP deployment 
needs in remote locations. While the power generation transition may take time and entail some 
costs, complementing the CIPP with a plan to transition off-grid power generation under the Just 
Energy Transition Partnership (JETP)—as the authorities intend to do by the end of the year—would 
help set a path to meet Indonesia’s climate goals. An energy subsidy reform, carbon pricing39 and 
gradually phasing out related NTMs would be key to achieving Indonesia’s Nationally Determined 
Contribution (NDC) to reduce GHG emissions in 2030 by 32 percent, and the goal of achieving Net 
 
38 Cali, M. et al, 2024, “Trade Policy and Exporters' Resilience: Evidence from Indonesia” show that Indonesian firms 
facing NTMs may be unable to respond to (or benefit from) external shocks that require flexibly adjusting imported 
inputs.

Zero emissions by 2060. These would be best accompanied with measures to support those most 
vulnerable during the transition and efforts to boost generation and access to renewable energy. 
Box 1. Structural Reforms 
• 
A granular benchmarking exercise shows that Indonesia has significant structural gaps to bridge 
vis-à-vis peers (see SIP). Indonesia is relatively less open to trade and has the least sophisticated exports 
within ASEAN, consistent with lower labor productivity and human capital. To foster converge, it would 
be important to further strengthen governance and anti-corruption frameworks, as well as the legal 
system to support accountability and business certainty. The quality of Indonesia’s infrastructure and 
logistics should be enhanced. Finally, bridging structural gaps towards these peers will require enhancing 
education and health, reducing labor vulnerability, informality, and gender gaps, and leveling up living 
conditions in a broadly shared way.1

Authorities’ Views 
46.      To achieve their 2045 Golden Indonesia Vision, the authorities are implementing 
transformational reforms to enhance social protection, improve productivity, and foster new 
sources of growth. The first stage of their long-term development plan targets strengthening 
transformational foundations for an inclusive and sustainable economy and focuses on increasing 
the quality of education, health and social protection, and infrastructure. This would be achieved 
through measures covering human capital (e.g., longer compulsory education, wider delivery of 
secondary education, nutrition programs to reduce stunting) and investment (e.g., the new Capital, 
new sea and air hubs, stronger digital infrastructure, and energy transition infrastructure). The 
authorities also aim to implement a governance transformation, including strengthening the 
regulatory framework and enhancements in the business climate. 
47.      The authorities see their IP strategy as consistent with the needed insertion of 
Indonesia into the global value chains (GVCs). They expect industrial performance and economic 
competitiveness to benefit from their IP, initially focused on the mining sector, but to be extended to 
other commodities, including agricultural products. They underscored the strong results achieved 
from the implementation of IP on nickel ore, which has delivered strong FDI for the construction of 
smelters; this will be expanded to copper by end-2024. They see IP as needed to make the most of 
their rich natural resources, enable the increase in value-addition in their economy and attract 
investment flows, especially in the face of geopolitical fragmentation trends which create an uneven 
playing field as significant distortions are imposed by the largest economies. 
Box 1. Structural Reforms (Concluded) 
• 
Structural reforms can have an important effect on output and be mutually reinforcing. 
Cross-country analysis (following Budina et al., 2022) focusing on EMs and AEs, suggests that reforms in 
governance, external sector regulation, credit market regulation, and human development (health, 
education) all have a positive, significant effect on output; the effect is stronger if reforms are 
implemented simultaneously; and mutually reinforcing packages have significant effects, independently of 
whether countries have already implemented strong reforms in the past or not. 
• 
Results help guide a possible sequencing of structural reforms in Indonesia (see Text Table 1). 
Reforms in the areas with wider gaps should be prioritized and introduced in tandem, to provide a 
self-reinforcing boost to growth. Among these, governance and anti-corruption are foundational, and 
could be combined in a first set of reforms in the near term with business regulation efforts to make it 
easier for firms to operate and expand, and external sector reforms supporting competitiveness—which 
should all support FDI as well. Some reforms (e.g., education, social services, infrastructure) may require 
structural (as opposed to cyclical) public spending and should be supported by upfront efforts to expand 
the fiscal space, particularly via revenue mobilization (increase the VAT rate and excises, in a first wave of 
tax reforms, for example). Reforms in other areas, such as credit market regulation reforms, can deliver 
stronger output effects if preceded by the first set of reforms.2 
____________________________ 
2 The comprehensive Job Creation Omnibus Law, enacted during the pandemic with the objective of improving the investment 
climate and generate new job opportunities, was a first step in that direction. The improvement in the IMD World Competitiveness 
ranking in 2024, relative to the previous year (in particular in the areas of government and business efficiency) might reflect this. 
Going forward, more is needed to finalize implementation regulations and streamline regulations further, improve business 
certainty, ease trade and logistics processes, level up learning outcomes, and enhance social protection.

48.      The authorities are committed to achieving Net-Zero Emission by 2060 or sooner, 
which has been incorporated in the National Long-Term Development Plan for 2024-2025. In 
coordination with international partners, the authorities expect to release the 2024 CIPP— which 
should showcase different transition pathways for the off-grid power plant network—around 
end-2024.40 Their overall green transition strategy focuses on five areas, namely the development of 
sustainable energy and the green industry, sustainable land restoration, waste management, and 
preservation of the coastal and marine environment. Discussions are ongoing on a possible carbon 
tax on carbon-intensive activities, expanding the emission trading system and carbon exchange 
market, the use of local content requirements on renewables, and enhancing the targeting of energy 
subsidies.41,42 These measures are expected to be addressed by the incoming administration starting 
end-2024.

STAFF APPRAISAL 
49.      Indonesia’s growth remains strong despite external headwinds, and the output gap is 
expected to fully close in 2026. Policies have been broadly prudent in the post-pandemic period. 
The fiscal deficit has stayed well within the fiscal rule limit, anchoring a declining public debt. 
Monetary policy has appropriately focused on bringing down inflation into the target range. The 
2023 external position was broadly in line with the level implied by medium-term fundamentals and 
desirable policies (Annex I), and the financial sector is resilient. The authorities have been pursuing an 
ambitious growth agenda to reach high-income status by 2045, comprising public spending, 
institutional reforms, and Industrial Policy (IP). Risks to the near-term outlook are broadly balanced. 
50.      While broadly prudent, the near-term fiscal deficit could be narrowed slightly to 
support the policy mix. The fiscal position is projected to become expansionary in 2024 and 2025, 
amid a negative (albeit gradually closing) output gap. This can be managed given well-contained 
inflation and relatively low public debt; yet, slightly narrower deficits would continue to support 
growth while allowing for a more balanced policy mix, and preserving policy space to respond to 
downside risks in a shock-prone global environment.  
51.      Indonesia’s longstanding fiscal prudence should be preserved to protect fiscal space 
and credibility. The fiscal rule—the 3 percent of GDP deficit cap—remains well-suited to support the 
Golden Vision, especially if complemented with an enhanced medium-term fiscal framework (MTFF) 
that ensures more systematic counter-cyclical fiscal policy within the cap. The authorities’ ambitious 
high-level revenue mobilization goals are welcome; a forceful tax reform, keeping tax incentives 
well-contained, and bolstering revenue administration would be essential to this end. Prioritizing 
high-quality spending and gradually reducing energy subsidies would help support Indonesia’s 
development goals, while staying within the cap. With fiscal operations by SOEs, PPPs and public 
guarantees gradually on the rise, closely monitoring fiscal risks and avoiding the buildup of 
1. Develop regulation to strengthen the development of credit 
scores; establish an oversight framework for the Credit Reporting 
Systems 
5. Expand (direct) access to the fast payment system (BI-FAST) 
and build on the National Standard for Payment Open API 
(SNAP) to develop a comprehensive approach to open 
banking/finance
2. Reforms to enhance capital market development (e.g., repo 
market, development of interest rate and forex derivatives).
6. Foster the presence of institutional investors in the domestic 
market
3. Strengthen regulatory approach to alternative financing 
models (DFS)
7. Enhance financial literacy and reduce the digitalization gap 
across Indonesian provinces
4. Introduce a regulatory green taxonomy and update reporting 
requirements for firms and financial institutions
8. Explore ways to scale and utilize the domestic banking system 
to mobilize climate finance.
G. Labor market 
1. Enhance the hiring and firing regulation, assess the extent to 
which wage determination encourages informality. 
2. Tackle labor informality and duality, while ensuring the 
protection of workers.

contingent liabilities should help preserve Indonesia’s long-standing track record of prudent policies 
and debt sustainability. 
52.      The monetary policy stance remains broadly adequate and should remain data 
dependent. Absent significant shocks that raise inflationary pressures, a gradual reduction of the 
policy rate would be appropriate. Given persistent uncertainties, the monetary policy path should 
remain data driven and ready to act if inflation surprises on either side, with well-communicated 
moves. With the overarching framework for crisis resolution well established in the FSOL, aligning the 
implementing regulations for future primary market purchases of government bonds by BI to 
international best practices will further safeguard central bank independence. Careful management 
should allow the unwinding of pandemic bonds as they fall due, while helping avoid market 
disruptions.  
53.      The macroprudential framework could be refined further. Continuing financial sector 
reform would protect resilience and support financial deepening. Clarifying that safeguarding 
financial system resilience is prioritized as BI calibrates the broad toolkit, and explicitly distinguishing 
the tools for financial system resilience would enhance effectiveness and communication. Gradually 
shifting the macroprudential stance towards a more neutral stance as the credit gap closes would be 
appropriate. Recent financial sector reform has entailed substantial progress; yet some areas could 
be further strengthened, as found in the 2024 FSAP. Key elements of further financial sector reforms 
include bolstering the financial safety net, crisis management, resolution, and systemic liquidity 
frameworks, and developing the credit infrastructure to foster sound access and addressing 
remaining gaps in the Anti-Money Laundering/Combating the Financing of Terrorism (AML/CFT) 
framework.  
54.      In line with the Integrated Policy Framework (IPF), the exchange rate should continue 
to play its shock absorbing role. Foreign exchange intervention (FXI) would be an appropriate 
response under certain shocks and conditions, particularly when shocks trigger spikes in market 
premia in the context of shallow FX markets. Preserving buffers will be particularly important for 
future eventual urgencies in a shock-prone global environment. Judicious use of FXI and an 
emphasis on ER flexibility as a shock absorber would also support greater market development. 
55.      Reaching high-income status by 2045 will require bridging gaps in key areas via 
horizontal structural reforms to lift potential growth in an inclusive manner. To this end, 
strengthening governance and anti-corruption, leveling up learning outcomes, investing in logistics 
and infrastructure, reducing restrictions to trade, and enhancing social protection will be key to 
support a more attractive business environment and secure a base capable of absorbing and 
supporting stronger economic activity and generate new job opportunities—so output can be lifted 
sustainably, and growth gains can be evenly shared. 
56.      Transitioning away from the use of Non-tariff Measures (NTMs) and carefully 
designing Industrial Policy (IP) to minimize trade and investment distortions would support 
potential growth. Plans to expand IP to new sectors should be preceded by cost-benefit analyses, 
and if implemented, accompanied by regular reassessments of trade-offs. Sound IP design must 
target well-identified market failures, be time-bound and cost-effective, and anchored by strong

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND 33 
governance; it should avoid hindering competition and innovation and minimize adverse 
cross-border spillovers. Transitioning away from the use of non-tariff measures will be critical to 
sustain strong and inclusive growth while supporting global economic integration. 
57.      Further reforms would support the green transition. The recently published 
Comprehensive Investment and Policy Plan (CIPP) for on-grid power generation is an important step 
in the right direction. The national climate mitigation strategy is appropriately focused on forestry 
and land use (FOLU), where abatement costs are low. Finalizing plans to transition coal-based 
off-grid power generation under the Just Energy Transition Partnership (JETP) would help set a path 
to meet Indonesia’s climate goals. An energy subsidy reform, carbon pricing and gradually phasing 
out related NTMs would support achieving Indonesia’s Nationally Determined Contribution (NDC) by 
2030, and the goal of achieving Net Zero emissions by 2060. 
58.      It is recommended that the next Article IV consultation take place on a standard 
12-month cycle.

52 
INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND 
Table 11. Indonesia: Implementation of Past Fund Advice 
Policies 
2023 Article IV Consultation Recommendations 
Actions Since 2023 Article IV Consultation 
Fiscal Policy 
Maintaining a broadly neutral fiscal stance below the 3 
percent deficit ceiling. 
 
Concrete medium-term fiscal framework, including revenue 
mobilization, energy subsidy reform, expanded social 
protection, and greater transparency.  
The overall deficit narrowed to 1.7 percent of GDP in 
2023. 
 
The authorities have stated plans to enhance 
efficiency in energy subsidy via better targeting. 
Monetary 
Policy 
BI should maintain a tightening bias in its monetary policy 
stance and act decisively if inflation surprises on the 
upside. 
 
 
 
The exchange rate should continue to play its role as a 
shock absorber. 
BI hiked the policy rate by 25 bps in October 2023, to 
6 percent, and further to 6.25 percent in April 2024 to 
stabilize the currency given external economic 
uncertainty and possible imported inflation pressures 
and has stayed on hold since then. 
 
The rupiah depreciated against the US dollar by an 
average of 2.6 percent in 2023. Indonesia’s de facto 
exchange rate regime is classified as floating. The 
external position in 2023 was broadly in line with the 
level implied by medium-term fundamentals and 
desirable policies. 
Financial Sector 
Policies 
Keeping the macroprudential policy stance broadly 
unchanged, with the aim of moving toward a more neutral 
stance in 2024 as the credit gap narrows. 
 
Regulatory forbearance measures and incentives should be 
tightened, including the expiration of the relaxation of loan 
classification rules. 
 
Continued strengthening of the regulatory and institutional 
framework will be important. 
BI has kept its macroprudential policies (MPPs) loose 
to avoid a drag on growth. 
 
 
Regulatory forbearance measures were discontinued 
in March 2024 as envisaged. 
 
The authorities have largely implemented the 2017 
FSAP Recommendations 
Structural 
Policies and 
Climate Change 
The authorities should consider domestic policies that 
achieve their objectives of increasing value added in 
production, while phasing out export restrictions and not 
extending the restrictions to other commodities. 
 
 
 
Broader reforms would be needed to reach net zero, 
including the gradual reduction of energy subsidies and 
carbon pricing. 
 
 
 
Broad-based structural reforms, with priorities on reducing 
labor market restrictions, improving the investment 
climate, human capital development, infrastructure 
investment, and financial deepening. 
For 2024, the authorities allocated increased spending 
budgets in the education, social protection, 
infrastructure, and health areas, which are considered 
key to support growth, which is a step in the right 
direction. Existing restrictions have been maintained, 
with extensions to some new commodities.  
 
The authorities published a Comprehensive 
Investment and Policy Plan (CIPP) including the phase 
out of the on-grid coal-fired power plants, under the 
JETP. A plan to transition off-grid power generation is 
also needed.  
 
 
The incoming Prabowo administration has yet to 
detail its agenda. 
 
 


INDONESIA 
INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND 53 
Table 12. Indonesia: Status of Key 2017 FSAP Recommendations1 
Key Recommendations 
Authorities’ Actions  
Institutional and Legal Arrangements 
Revise OJK Law to give primacy to objective of 
safeguarding stability, BI Law to include a financial 
stability and macroprudential policy mandate 
focused on systemic risk of the financial system, with 
access to data; and LPS Law to focus objectives on 
the maintenance of financial stability, continuity of 
critical functions, protection of insured deposits, and 
minimization of resolution costs. 
Partially implemented. There has been structural reform in the Indonesian financial sector through the 
issuance of an Omnibus law (FSOL) on 12 January 2023 which revises 17 laws related to the financial sector, 
including OJK Law, BI Law, and LPS Law. The Law 4/2023 aims to strengthen institutional authorities and 
governance in the financial sector, which includes BI, OJK, LPS, and MoF. Furthermore, the Law focuses on the 
objectives, duties, and authority of the three institutions (BI, OJK and LPS) to bolster financial system stability, 
while still prioritizing their independence.  
 
The FSOL included the objective of the OJK on financial stability (“actively maintain financial system stability”) 
but has not established the hierarchy of the OJK multiple objectives, giving primacy to the objective of 
safeguarding stability. 
Amend the Insurance Law to specify policyholder 
protection as principal objective of OJK. 
Partially implemented. Article 4 letter c of the OJK Law stipulates the purpose of OJK, that all activities in 
the financial services sector should be able to provide protection of the consumers and public interest. 
Furthermore, in article 1 number 15 of the OJK Law stipulates that the scope of consumers includes policy 
holders in Insurance. Thus, the OJK Law has stated that the protection of policyholders in insurance is one of 
OJK's objectives. 
Strengthen legal protection of supervisors and 
officials of all agencies involved in financial oversight 
and crisis management in line with global standards. 
Pending. In addition to being regulated under Article 45 of BI Law and Article 48 of PPKSK Law (Law Number 
9 of 2016), the legal protection of supervisors and officials of all agencies (MoF, BI, OJK, LPS) has been further 
strengthened by Article 27 section 2 of Law Number 2 Year 2020 (Government Regulation in Lieu of Law No. 
1 Year 2020 on State Financial Policy and Financial System Stability for Handling COVID-19 Pandemic and/or 
Encounter the Threat to National Economy and/or Stability of Financial Systems). The law provides legal 
protection to KSSK members, secretariat and members of Secretariat, as well as officials or employees of 
MOF, BI, OJK, LPS who carry out their functions in good faith and according to prevailing laws and 
regulations. 
 
In 2023, the FSOL introduced legal protection for OJK and its staff against lawsuits arising from actions or 
omissions made in good faith. However, the OJK Law does not explicitly provide for the supervisor and their 
staff to be adequately protected against the costs of defending their actions or omissions. 
Financial Sector Oversight 
Introduce a foreign currency liquidity coverage ratio.  
Pending. Indonesia has complied with the Basel standards by supervising banks' foreign exchange liquidity 
position using an additional monitoring tool based on the significance of such foreign exchange to the 
bank's financial position. OJK has been imposing LCR based on significant currencies as a monitoring tool as 
stipulated in regulation No.42/POJK.03/2015 concerning Liquidity Coverage Ratio Requirement for 
Commercial Banks. Article 51 and its elucidation of such regulation requires banks to monitor LCR based on 
significant currencies. 
Strengthen BI’s capacity for systemic risk analysis 
and macroprudential stress tests, and OJK’s capacity 
for regulatory stress tests; OJK should do bottom-up 
stress tests for D-SIBs regularly. 
Implemented. BI and OJK have been implementing Joint Stress Test (JST) regularly once a year since 2017. BI 
is responsible for designing macroeconomic scenarios, namely baseline, adverse I (for severe), and adverse II 
(for moderate), based on potential medium-term global and domestic economic risks, and performing Top-
Down Stress Test (TDST) and Granular Stress Test (GST) by using those scenarios. Meanwhile, OJK is 
responsible for coordinating Bottom-Up Stress Test (BUST) for systemic banks (D-SIB) and other large banks. 
The results of TDST, GST and BUST are compared and discussed to generate a final report that will be 
reported to the Board Meeting of BI and OJK. 
Reduce OJK’s silo structure, including by revising the 
OJK Law to remove the responsibilities of individual 
Commissioners for the supervision of specific 
sectors. 
Partially implemented. Currently several steps have been taken to reduce silo structures at the OJK, 
including implementing the RKPT forum for cross-sectoral supervision. Further, OJK has issued and 
implemented various integrated regulation as joint commitment from OJK to develop and strengthen 
integrated supervision of financial service sector. 
The FSOL introduced the requirement that the OJK Charmain leads and conducts systemic assessment of the 
integrated supervision of financial conglomerates.  
While there has been some progress in reducing OJK’s silo structure, further efforts are required to fully 
implement this recommendation. FSAP 2024 has not conducted a comprehensive review of its 
implementation. 
Governance of Financial Conglomerates (FCs) 
Strengthen the banking supervisory approach and 
continue enhancing supervisory practices for 
financial conglomerates (FCs). 
Partially implemented. OJK's Committee of Integrated Supervision (RKPT) decided on February 5, 2021 that 
14 FCs meet the definition criteria according to OJK Regulation No.45/POJK.03/2020 on FCs (POJK 45). The 
FCs, through its Lead Entities, have also prepared and submitted their Corporate Charters to OJK as 
stipulated in Article 5 of POJK 45. 
2017 FSAP noted that the OJK has identified 49 FCs in Indonesia at that time, and as mentioned above, the 
OJK has identified only 14 FCs under the new regulation.  
 FSAP 2024 has not conducted a full review of this recommendation's implementation (this area was 
reviewed only from consolidated supervision perspective). 


INDONESIA

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND 
Table 12. Indonesia: Status of Key 2017 FSAP Recommendations (Continued) 
Key Recommendations 
Authorities’ Actions 
Strengthen corporate governance practices within 
the financial system, including the boards of 
commissioners' (BoC) oversight roles  and 
responsibilities. 
Partially implemented. OJK has stipulated regulations No.55/POJK.03/2016 and 17/POJK.03/2023on Good 
Corporate Governance for Commercial Banks and No. 18/POJK.03/2016 on the Implementation of Risk 
Management for Commercial Banks. The regulations require BoC to conduct active.  
oversight over the bank's activities and to provide advice to the board of directors to improve corporate 
governance and risk management practice.  
FSAP 2024 has not conducted a full review of this recommendation's implementation. For banking 
supervision, FSAP 2024 recommended that the OJK should continue playing a proactive role in strengthening 
the BoC’s role and responsibilities. 
Introduce legal provisions for licensed non-
operating financial holding companies. 
Implemented. OJK established its Regulation Number 45/POJK.03/2020 concerning FCs that defines FC as 
Financial group of company which has combining assets equal to or larger than IDR100,000,000,000,000 (one 
hundred trillion Rupiah) and consists of more than 1 (one) type of business activities. The regulation requires 
the FC to appoint or establish a financial company to be the holder of the financial conglomeration. The type 
of businesses that can be included in financial conglomerates are banks, insurance, multi-finance companies, 
and securities. 
In addition, the discussion of financial sector reform has also included the strengthening of OJK function in 
supervising financial holding companies, including the appointment of financial entity or establishment of 
new entity as the controller of the FC. 
FSOL introduced requirements for licensing of financial holding company (it requires the controlling party of 
financial conglomerates to form financial holding company) and mandated the OJK to issue regulations 
regarding financial conglomerates, including the licensing of financial holding company, the fit and proper 
test of the board members of the financial holding company, and other necessary prudential aspects within 
two years after the promulgation of the law (by January 2025). The implementation of these FSOL 
requirements remains a high priority. FSAP 2024 has not conducted a full review of this recommendation's 
implementation. 
Crisis Management and Resolution, and Safety Nets
Revise the PPKSK Law to clarify the role of the KSSK 
as solely a coordination body; limit the involvement 
of the President to approving public funding. 
Partially Implemented. Law No. 4 of 2023 regulates the role of KSSK as a coordination body as reflected in 
the duties and powers of KSSK. KSSK is in charge of coordinating in handling the problem of Systemically 
Important Banks and coordinating the steps to be taken by the members of the Financial System Stability 
Committee to support the implementation of the problems handling of Systemically Important Banks by the 
Indonesia Deposit Insurance Corporation.  
Under the constitution, it is the President who can declare a crisis or state of emergency situation as it was 
last done during the COVID-19 pandemic (Art. 12 of the 1945 Constitution). In addition, he can declare a 
system wide Bank Restructuring Program. 
Adjust the emergency liquidity assistance (ELA) 
framework to ensure it is effective. 
Implemented. In response to the COVID-19 pandemic, the Government enacted Law No. 2 of 2020 
concerning State Financial Policy and Financial System Stability for Handling COVID-19 Pandemic, which 
included enhancement of BI’s mandate and power in crisis conditions. As a follow up, BI amended its crisis 
management and resolution framework, particularly regarding BI crisis management protocol and provision 
of PLJP/PLJPS. 
Amend the relevant laws to ensure that resolution 
powers can be exercised over FCs. 
Pending. Resolution power over FCs is amongst the topics to be discussed and considered in the 
amendment of LPS Law under the discussion of financial sector reform. 
Develop resolution options and implementation 
guidelines for banks, and resolvability assessment 
and resolution planning frameworks for D-SIBs. 
Implemented. Indonesian authorities have regulated the recovery plan under the Law Number 9 of 2016 
concerning Prevention and Mitigation of Financial System Crisis, which was complemented by issuance of 
OJK Regulation (POJK) No. 14/POJK.03/2017 concerning Recovery Plan for Systemic Banks require 
Domestically Systemic Important Bank to have recovery plan. 
On the resolution plan, the Indonesia Deposit Insurance Corporation (IDIC) promulgated IDIC Regulation 
Number 1/2021 on Resolution Plan in March 2021. Under the regulation, DSIBs and selected non-DSIBs must 
prepare resolution plan starting in 2022. The regulation also stipulates the resolvability assessment 
requirement. 
Financial Integrity
Integrate key money laundering or terrorist 
financing (ML/TF) risks in the priorities and 
operations of relevant agencies. 
Implemented. OJK has implemented FATFs’ recommendations regarding risk-based AML/CFT, which were 
adopted as the National Committee of Prevention and Eradication of the Criminal Act of Money Laundering 
(NCC)s’ commitment as stipulated in the National Strategy. This includes risk-based regulation and 
supervision, and cooperation with related institutions/ministries in the context of information exchange on 
money laundering offenses. Financial institutions and supervisors have been equipped with National Risk 
Assessment (NRA) and Sectoral Risk Assessment (SRA) guidelines for the financial services sector as compiled 
by OJK. 
Finalize and implement risk-based AML/CFT 
supervisory tools. 
Implemented. In accordance with the FATF Recommendation, OJK has carried out AML/CFT risk-based 
supervision. Based on the results of the MER FATF 2023, OJK is considered to have a good understanding of 
ML/TF risks through the establishment of effective regulations and the implementation of effective 
risk-based AML/CFT supervision.

Key Recommendations 
Authorities’ Actions  
Financial Deepening and Inclusion 
Develop an integrated roadmap for promoting 
financial deepening and inclusion. 
Implemented. Financial Deepening. The National Financial Market Development and Deepening Strategy 
(SN-PPPK) has been reviewed and revi sed in light of the pandemic and changing global and domestic 
economic and financial market conditions. The financial market deepening is a part of Pillar II "Development 
of the Financial Services Ecosystem" in The OJK Financial Services Sector Master Plan 2021-2025.  
In line with the SN-PPPK, OJK and all members of FK-PPPK undertake financial market deepening initiatives. 
OJK supports the development of the primary and secondary bond and Sukuk market infrastructure. In 
November 2020, the Indonesian Stock Exchange launched an electronic trading platform phase 2 (Alternative 
Market Operator System). In addition, in 2019, KPEI as CCP in the stock exchange market also developed a 
third-party Repo system to support Repo transactions in the market in the absence of standardized services 
to support the implementation of Repo transactions in accordance with existing regulations. 
Financial Inclusion. The Government of Indonesia issued Presidential Regulation No. 114 of 2020 on National 
Strategy for Financial Inclusion (SNKI) that has provided an impetus to accelerate Indonesia's financial 
inclusion. BI has developed a new approach to enhance financial inclusion focusing on integrating economic 
activities and financial inclusion. 
Enhance bond yield curve by consolidating debt 
issuance and improving secondary markets. 
Implemented. IDX has launched IGBF (Indonesia Government Bond Futures) products to improve the 
secondary market as derivative instruments. As of November 2020, IGBF offered two new series available for 
market players via the Indonesia Stock Exchange Platform. However, the participation of market players and 
the demand for the above instruments still need to be further improved. 
Regarding consolidating debt issuance to enhance the government bond yield curve, the government is 
actively undertaking prudent portfolio management such as issuing benchmark series in the primary market 
to maintain the bond yield curve. The government also conducts debt switching transactions to smooth out 
the maturity profile and reduce non-liquid series in the secondary market. A private placement is also 
available as an option to increase the volume of specific series to create a more active secondary market. 
In terms of debt switch in 2021, the government has conducted an auction to buy back bonds in the 
domestic market on June 17, 2021, which obtained bids amount submitted by bidders of IDR 11.5 trillion 
with the nominal won by the government amounting to IDR 4.98 trillion. The second auction was held on 
September 23, 2021. The nominal bids submitted by bidders was IDR 11.24 trillion, while the nominal amount 
won by the government was IDR 7.07 trillion. 
In the global market, the government announced the successful completion of its inaugural Tender 
Offer/Liability Management (LM) Exercise launched on eight series of Notes (the Old Bonds) on September 
20, 2021. The LM Exercise was well-received by global investors, and the total amount of tender instructions 
received across all series of Notes reached USD 2.68 Bio. However, the government decided to repurchase a 
total nominal amount of USD 1.16 bio as part of our general cash management program and a broader plan 
to manage our external liabilities.  
To enhance trading activity, the government, in cooperation with Indonesia Stock Exchange, has been 
developing an electronic trading platform for government bonds to provide more transparency on price 
discovery under the over-the-counter market. Currently, the Government and IDX have introduced the 
system and continue to improve infrastructure with the cooperation of government bond primary dealers. It 
is expected that the program will be launched formally in the first quarter of 2022. 
Further strengthen the enforcement of credit and 
risk management regulations. 
Partially implemented. OJK has issued a number of regulations to strengthen banks' credit and risk 
management practices. 
OJK is in the process of issuing an updated regulation on Risk-Weighted Assets for Credit Risk and Market 
Risk which will be implemented by 2023 in line with the target agreed by the Basel Committee on Banking 
Supervision. 
Revise the insurance supervisory framework (three 
strikes-approach) to allow prompt actions. 
Implemented. FSAP recommendation has been implemented through issuance of OJK Regulation Number 
17/POJK.05/2017 concerning the imposition of administrative sanctions in the form of revocation of business 
license without prior imposition of other administrative sanctions in cases where there is a drastic 
deterioration of financial conditions, shareholders are not cooperative and no way of solving the problems 
that endanger the interests of policyholders, the insured, or the participants.

Annex I. External Sector Assessment 
Overall Assessment: The external position in 2023 was broadly in line with the level implied by medium-term fundamentals and 
desirable policies. In the medium term, exchange rate flexibility and structural policies are expected to contain the CA deficit. 
Although external financing needs appear sustainable, Indonesia’s reliance on foreign portfolio investment exposes the economy 
to sharp swings in market sentiment and risk premia, and to fluctuations in global financial conditions. 
Potential Policy Responses: Maintaining external balance will require structural reforms to enhance productivity and facilitate 
post-COVID-19 sectoral adjustments. Reforms should include (i) higher infrastructure investment, higher social spending to foster 
human capital development and strengthen the social safety net, (ii) a reduction of restrictions on inward FDI and external trade, 
including by moving away from non-tariff barriers, (as discussed in the 2023 Article IV consultation), and (iii) promotion of greater 
labor market flexibility. Flexibility of the exchange rate should continue to support external stability with the ongoing structural 
transformation of the Indonesian economy. 
Foreign Asset 
and Liability 
Position and 
Trajectory 
Background. Indonesia’s NIIP remained unchanged at –19.0 percent of GDP at the end of 2023, reflecting an 
increase of 1.1 percentage points in gross external assets and liabilities, respectively to 35.3 and 54.3 percent of 
GDP. The increase in gross external assets was supported by higher FDI abroad, portfolio investment, and 
reserve assets. In turn, the increase in gross external liabilities reflected fully the increase in FDI inflows. 
Indonesia’s gross external debt remained moderate at 29.8 percent of GDP at end-2023, declining marginally 
from 30.1 percent of GDP in 2022. External rollover risks in the short-term are contained as reflected in the 
large share of long-term debt. 
Assessment. The level and composition of the NIIP and gross external debt indicate that Indonesia’s external 
position is sustainable and subject to limited rollover risk. But the relatively high dependence on foreign 
portfolio investment (20.1 percent of GDP in 2023) makes Indonesia highly vulnerable to swings in global 
financial market sentiment. The NIIP as a percent of GDP is projected to stabilize at current levels in the 
medium term, as robust nominal GDP growth offsets the projected small CA deficits. 
2023 (% GDP)

Current Account 
Background. The CA balance posted a small deficit of 0.1 percent of GDP in 2023, after two consecutive years 
of surpluses (1.0 percent in 2022). The deficit in 2023 was primarily driven by the non-oil and gas trade 
balance, reflecting weaker growth in major trading partners, and a broad-based decline in commodity prices. 
The resilience in domestic demand translated into a smaller decline in imports relative to exports. On the 
savings-investment side, higher government revenue was broadly offset by lower private savings and higher 
private investment. The CA deficit is expected to widen moderately in 2024 due to lower commodity prices, 
while robust domestic demand will support import growth. The CA deficit is expected to remain close to the 
norm throughout the projection horizon. 
Assessment. Staff estimates a CA gap of 0.8 percent of GDP for 2023, consistent with an estimated cyclically 
adjusted CA deficit of −0.3 percent of GDP, a staff assessed norm of −0.8 percent of GDP, and an adjustor of 
0.3 percentage points for demographics.1 Considering the uncertainty in the estimation of the norm, the CA 
gap for 2023 is in the range of 0.3 to 1.3 percent of GDP. EBA-identified policy gaps are estimated at 1.7 
percent of GDP, driven by a tighter fiscal stance than in other countries (1.3) and underspending on healthcare 
(0.6).

Real Exchange 
Rate 
Background. The average REER depreciated by 3.7 percent in 2023 compared to the average level in 2022 (or 
3.2 percent relative to the pre-COVID 2016-19 average). The depreciation materialized on the back of the rapid 
tightening in global monetary policy and high volatility in global financial markets. The rupiah managed to 
recover some of the losses against major currencies toward the end of 2023, as a result of easier global 
financial conditions, and BI’s policy responses (including a one-off interest rate hike). As of end-April 2024, the 
REER was 2.4 percent below its 2023 average. 
Assessment. The staff CA gap estimate of 0.8 percent of GDP implies a REER gap of –5.0 percent (applying an 
estimated elasticity of 0.16). The REER index and level models point to REER gaps of 0.8 percent and –

15.9 percent, respectively. Consistent with the staff CA gap, staff assesses the REER gap in the range of –7.9 to 
–2.1 percent, with a midpoint of –5.0 percent. 
Capital and 
Financial 
Accounts: Flows 
and Policy 
Measures 
Background. Net capital and financial flows returned to positive territory in 2023 (0.7 percent of GDP), after 
negative net flows of -0.7 percent of GDP in 2022. The recovery in financial inflows was driven by portfolio 
investment, particularly concentrated in the last quarter of 2023, reflecting the introduction of several open 
market instruments by BI to attract capital flows to support international reserves. Net FDI inflows continued to 
decline, to 1.1 percent of GDP in 2023 (1.4 percent in 2022 and 1.5 percent in 2021). The share of nonresident 
holdings of rupiah-denominated government bonds ticked up by 0.6 percentage points to 14.9 percent in 
2023, but remain considerably below the 39 percent share in 2019.  
Assessment. The recovery in portfolio investment flows in 2023 helped support the small negative CA deficit in 
2023. Continued strong policies, focused on safeguarding the fiscal position, advancing financial deepening, 
and easing broad-based structural reforms that promote an enabling business environment should help 
sustain capital inflows in the medium term, particularly in periods of high market volatility. 
FX Intervention 
and Reserves 
Level 
Background. Since mid-2013, Indonesia has had a more flexible exchange rate policy framework. Official 
foreign reserves increased to US$146 billion in 2023, from US$137 billion in 2022, reflecting the increase in 
deposits abroad and the withdrawal of government’s foreign loans during the year, which more than offset the 
decline in securities from FX intervention.  
Assessment. The current level of reserves (10.7 percent of GDP, 123 percent of the IMF’s reserve adequacy 
metric, and 6.1 months of prospective imports) should provide a sufficient buffer against external shocks. 
Predetermined drains also seem manageable, although they have increased related to short positions on 
financial derivatives. In line with the IPF, the use of FXI remains appropriate under certain shocks and 
circumstances, particularly when shocks trigger spikes in market premia given shallow FX markets, while 
remaining mindful of preserving reserve buffers. 
1 Indonesia is among a few countries with low life expectancy at prime age and demographic indicators are adjusted to account for 
this. As a result, the model-estimated CA norm is adjusted by subtracting 0.3 percentage points.

Annex II. Risk Assessment Matrix1 
 
1 The Risk Assessment Matrix (RAM) shows events that could materially alter the baseline path (the scenario most 
likely to materialize in the view of IMF staff). The relative likelihood is the staff’s subjective assessment of the risks 
surrounding the baseline (“low” is meant to indicate a probability below 10 percent, “medium” a probability between 
10 and 30 percent, and “high” a probability between 30 and 50 percent). The RAM reflects staff views on the source 
of risks and overall level of concern as of the time of discussions with the authorities. Nonmutually exclusive risks 
may interact and materialize jointly. 
Source of Risks 
Likelihood 
Expected Impact 
Policy Recommendation 
Global 
Conjunctural. Intensification of 
regional conflicts. Escalation or 
spread of the conflict in Gaza and 
Israel, Russia’s war in Ukraine, 
and/or other regional conflicts or 
terrorism disrupt trade (e.g., 
energy, food, tourism, supply 
chains), remittances, FDI and 
financial flows, payment systems, 
and increase refugee flows. 
High 
 
 
Medium. Commodity prices, 
financial flows, and supply chains 
would be the key transmission 
channels. For commodities, a 
deterioration in the terms of trade 
would lead to lower growth and 
worsen the external balance. A 
sharp increase in energy or food 
prices may strain the fiscal position 
to the extent these prices remain 
subject to administrative measures; 
price adjustments would impact 
inflation. Supply chain disruptions 
could affect production and trade, 
and raise inflation. Capital outflows 
could tighten financial conditions 
and create exchange rate volatility. 
Use monetary policy to stabilize inflation. If 
fiscal space is available, well-targeted and 
temporary support measures could be 
considered to protect the vulnerable, but 
should be calibrated to protect fiscal space 
and limit further pressure on inflation. The 
exchange rate should remain flexible and 
market determined. FXI could be used to 
address disorderly market conditions or the 
impact of shocks under frictions (e.g., a sharp 
pickup in the UIP premium in shallow 
financial markets) while preserving strong 
buffers. 
Conjunctural. Commodity price 
volatility. A succession of supply 
disruptions (e.g., due to conflicts, 
export restrictions, and OPEC+ 
decisions) and demand 
fluctuations causes recurrent 
commodity price volatility, 
external and fiscal pressures in 
EMDEs, cross-border spillovers, 
and social and economic 
instability.  
High 
 
 
Medium. Impact will depend on 
whether (and which) commodity 
prices rise or decline, given 
Indonesia’s net commodity exporter 
status on various key commodities. 
A rise in the price of oil, of which 
Indonesia is a net importer, and/or 
a decline in price of commodities 
for which Indonesia is a net 
exporter (e.g., nickel, crude palm oil) 
would lead to lower growth and 
worsen the external balance. A 
sharp increase in energy prices 
would reverse the moderation in 
inflation. 
Use available policy space (fiscal and 
monetary policy) countercyclically to stabilize 
output and inflation. Seek to make progress 
on reforming energy subsidies. The exchange 
rate should remain flexible and determined 
by market forces.  
Structural. Deepening 
geo-economic fragmentation. 
Broader conflicts, inward-
oriented policies, and weakened 
international cooperation result 
in a less efficient configuration of 
trade and FDI, supply disruptions, 
protectionism, policy uncertainty, 
technological and payments 
system fragmentation, rising 
shipping and input costs, 
financial stability, a fracturing of 
international monetary system, 
and lower growth. 
High 
Medium/High. A weaker global 
economy would reduce export 
demand and capital flows, including 
FDI. Higher uncertainty could weigh 
on investment and capital flows. 
Supply chain disruptions could push 
up inflation. In the long-term, lower 
productivity gains from the transfer 
of knowledge and technology 
embedded in trade and investments 
from frontier economies could 
hinder the pace of economic 
convergence. 
Carefully use policy space (fiscal and 
monetary policy) to stabilize inflation and 
output, calibrating the response to a long-
lasting shock (or protracted series of shocks) 
to maintain margin for maneuver. Accelerate 
horizontal structural reforms to support the 
transition to an economy that is more 
productive, greener, open and integrated to 
be more resilient to global geo-economic 
fragmentation.

Policy Recommendation 
Conjunctural. Abrupt global 
slowdown. Global and 
idiosyncratic risk factors cause a 
synchronized sharp growth 
downturn, with recessions in 
some countries, adverse 
spillovers through trade and 
financial channels, and market 
fragmentation triggering sudden 
stops in EMDEs. 
 
• 
China: Sharper-than-
expected contraction in the 
property sector weighs on 
private demand, further 
amplifies local government 
fiscal strains, and results in 
disinflationary pressures and 
adverse macro-financial 
feedback loops. 
• 
Europe: Intensifying fallout 
from Russia’s war in Ukraine, 
supply disruptions, tight 
financial conditions, and real

exacerbate economic 
downturn. 
• 
U.S.: Amid tight labor 
markets, inflation remains 
elevated, prompting the Fed 
to keep rates higher for 
longer and resulting in more 
abrupt financial, housing, and 
commercial real estate 
market correction. 
Medium 
Medium/High. Lower GDP growth, 
due to weaker investment, export 
demand and commodity prices; 
robust domestic demand may offer 
some offset depending on the size 
of the shock. The shock could 
trigger a weakening or reversal in 
capital flows, leading to currency 
volatility and tighter domestic credit 
conditions; possible impact on 
vulnerable sectors of the 
population. 
Use available fiscal space countercyclically to 
provide targeted support, while allowing the 
exchange rate to act as a shock absorber. FXI 
could be used to address disorderly market 
conditions or the impact of shocks under 
frictions (e.g., a sharp pickup in the UIP 
premium in shallow financial markets) while 
preserving strong buffers. 
Conjunctural. Monetary policy 
miscalibration. Amid high 
economic uncertainty, major 
central banks loosen policy 
stance prematurely, hindering 
disinflation, or keep it tight for 
longer than warranted, causing 
abrupt adjustments in financial 
markets and weakening the 
credibility of central banks. 
Medium 
Medium. Reduced interest rate 
differentials vis-à-vis the U.S. and 
major financial centers could lead to 
capital outflows and put downward 
pressure on the Rupiah, which may 
be amplified by disruptive market 
conditions.  
Ensure monetary policy settings remain in 
line with inflation target objectives. Allow the 
exchange rate to act as a shock absorber. FXI 
could be used to address disorderly market 
conditions (e.g., a sharp pickup in the UIP 
premium) while keeping strong buffers. 
Conjunctural. Systemic 
financial instability. High 
interest rates and risk premia and 
asset repricing amid economic 
slowdowns and political 
uncertainty (e.g., from elections) 
trigger market dislocations, with 
cross-border spillovers and an 
adverse macro-financial feedback 
loop affecting weak banks and 
NBFIs. 
Medium 
Medium. Direct transmission of 
instability to the domestic financial 
sector is likely to be contained 
amidst strong bank balance sheets 
and limited interlinkages. However, 
risk-off sentiment in global financial 
markets would tighten external 
financing conditions. Impact on 
economic activity in major trading 
partners and/or on commodity 
prices, if significant, could worsen 
the external balance, and could 
create exchange rate volatility. 
Monitor spillovers to the domestic financial 
sector and stand ready to intervene if severe 
strains begin to emerge. With inflation within 
BI’s target range, monetary policy could be 
eased to limit the impact on output—which 
will be enabled further if monetary policy 
begins to normalize in major economies. 
Allow the exchange rate to act as a shock 
absorber. FXI could be used to address 
disorderly market conditions or the impact of

Expected Impact 
Policy Recommendation 
Structural. Disorderly energy 
transition. A disorderly shift to 
net-zero emissions (e.g., owing to 
shortages in critical metals) and 
climate policy uncertainty cause 
supply disruptions, stranded 
assets, market volatility, and 
subdued investment and growth. 
Medium 
Medium. Impact will depend on 
nature of transition, due to 
Indonesia’s position as a major 
producer/exporter of fossil fuels 
(e.g., coal) and critical minerals. An 
unanticipated acceleration in the 
pace of transition could raise credit 
and market risks, and generate 
stranded assets, weighing on 
financial sector balance sheets 
given exposures to carbon-intensive 
firms. However, a sharp increase in 
prices of critical minerals of which 
Indonesia is a major producer (e.g., 
nickel) could boost export values 
and corporate profits, providing a 
buffer, at least temporarily.  
Continue enhancing domestic transition plan, 
including to manage and decommission coal-
fired power plants to reduce risks of stranded 
assets. Strengthen climate risk assessment for 
the financial sector, monitoring of transition 
risk exposures, as well as disclosure and 
availability of data. Deploy broad horizontal 
structural reforms to support diversification, 
value-addition, and green growth. 
Structural. Extreme climate 
events. Extreme climate events 
driven by rising temperatures 
cause loss of human lives, severe 
damage to infrastructure, supply 
disruptions, low growth, and 
financial stability. 
Medium 
Low. Disruptions to economic 
activity are likely to be localized; 
becoming macro-critical only if they 
were to hit major production and/or 
population centers (including 
Jakarta) or in case of repeated 
events or compounding events 
(multiple shocks occurring 
simultaneously). 
Prioritize targeted support to affected 
households and businesses, and 
reconstruction. Preemptively monitor 
financial sector risks that have geographical 
and/or sector concentrations that may be 
impaired in key areas particularly vulnerable 
to climate shocks (e.g., fisheries, or mining 
complexes in vulnerable locations). Continue 
disaster risk management preparedness, in 
line with already adopted disaster risk 
financing and insurance strategy in 2018, 
adaptive social protection roadmap in 2023, 
and current operationalization of the national 
“Pooling Fund Bencana – PFB” to manage 
disaster related financing needs.  
Domestic 
Conjunctural. Acceleration of 
domestic demand. Rising 
domestic economic confidence, 
which could arise, inter alia, from 
a more rapid and/or deeper than 
expected implementation of 
horizontal structural reforms. 
Medium 
Medium. Stronger private sector 
investment as economic prospects 
improve, contributing to a 
faster-than-projected closing of the 
output gap; the recovery in bank 
credit accelerates. 
Fiscal and monetary policies should remain 
broadly neutral with a tightening bias; a tight 
monetary policy stance could be warranted if 
inflation picks up. MPPs should be tightened 
if credit growth accelerates, closing the credit 
gap earlier.

Annex III. Public and External Debt Sustainability Analysis1 
Public Debt Sustainability 
1.      Indonesia’s public sector debt remains low. General government debt reached 
39.6 percent of GDP in 2023 from 30.6 percent in 2019, owing to the exceptional fiscal measures 
deployed in 2020-22 to fight the pandemic, during which the fiscal rule was temporarily suspended. 
Public debt is projected to gradually decline to around 38.3 percent of GDP over the medium-term, 
mainly driven by a negative cumulative interest rate-growth differential. Gross financing needs are 
expected to remain moderate, at about 5 percent of GDP over the medium-term. Debt coverage is 
adequate, and realism tools suggest projections of key debt drivers are within norms. 
2.      The SRDSA suggests an overall low risk of sovereign stress. Medium-term risks are 
assessed as low (in line with the mechanical signal from the SRDSF). The Debt Fan chart Module 
indicates an adequate balance of risks around the projected debt baseline. For the GFN 
Financeability Module, a combination of low GFNs and an initial high bank exposure to the 
government, result in moderate risks under a macro-fiscal and debt holder shock. Mitigating 
factors include a declining share of foreign holdings of local-currency debt, and relatively large 
cash buffers. Taken together, the aggregate MTI produces a mechanical “low” signal (Figure 1). 
External Debt Sustainability 
3.      Indonesia’s external debt has been on a downward path after a temporary increase 
during the pandemic. External debt stood at 30.1 percent of GDP in 2022, down from 34.9 percent 
of GDP at the end of 2021. Indonesia’s external debt declined across all sectors, with the general 
government accounting for more than half of that decline, standing at 14.1 percent of GDP. 
External debt fell further to 29.8 percent of GDP by end-2023 (Figure 1 and Table 1), driven mainly 
by a decline in debt of other nonbanking sectors. 
4.      External debt is projected to continue to gradually decline to 26 percent of GDP in the 
medium term. In the baseline scenario, strong projected growth in nominal GDP more than offsets 
rising external financing needs as the current account widens somewhat, leading to a small decline 
in external debt as a share of GDP.  
5.      External debt sustainability is robust to interest rate, current account and growth 
shocks, but is sensitive to exchange rate shocks (Figure 2). A widening of the current account 
from projected levels would cause external debt to rise moderately (a one-standard deviation 
shock would increase external debt to 29 percent of GDP by 2029). Exchange rate depreciation 
would have the largest impact—a 30 percent depreciation in 2024 would raise external debt to 
41 percent of GDP in 2025, and it would decline only slightly at the end of the forecasting horizon.

Note: The risk of sovereign stress is a broader concept than debt sustainability. Unsustainable debt can only be resolved through 
exceptional measures (such as debt restructuring). In contrast, a sovereign can face stress without its debt necessarily being 
unsustainable, and there can be various measures—that do not involve a debt restructuring—to remedy such a situation, such as 
fiscal adjustment and new financing.
1/ The near-term assessment is not applicable in cases where there is a disbursing IMF arrangement. In surveillance-only cases or

arrangement. The mechanical signal of the debt sustainability assessment is deleted before publication. In surveillance-only cases

near and medium-term modules.
There are long-term risks from climate change adaptation needs. 
Adaptation costs are estimated at about 0.8 percent of GDP per year 
over the long-term. Fiscal reforms to create fiscal space to finance 
adaptation needs are critical over the longer run.

Medium-term risks are assessed as "low" (in line with the aggregate

DSA summary assessment
Commentary: Indonesia is at a "low" overall risk of sovereign stress and debt is sustainable. Most indicators have started to 
normalize as the recovery from the COVID-19 shock has proceeded. Public debt is expected to gradually decline over the 
medium-term, driven mostly by a favorable interest-growth differential. Debt coverage is adequate, and realism tools sugget 
projections of key debt drivers are within norms. Medium-term solvency and liquidity risks are manageable. Over the longer 
run, reforms should continue to tackle risks from climate change.

Extended Projection
Commentary: Public debt is expected to decrease gradually from 39.6 percent of GDP in 2023 to 38.4 percent of GDP over the 
medium-term, mostly due to a favorable interest-growth differential. Gross financing needs are expected to remain manageable at 
around 5 percent of GDP over the medium-term.

Commentary: Realism analysis does not point to major concerns. Forecast errors show some signs of past optimism in the 
underlying debt creating flows, but this is largely influenced by unexpectd outcomes during the COVID years. The projected 
3-year fiscal adjustment and 3-year debt reduction are well within norms, and the real GDP growth path is in line with the 
assumed fiscal adjustment and potential growth.

Low
Commentary: The Debt Fanchart Module indicates an adequate balance of risks around the projected debt baseline. For the GFN Financeability Module, 
a combination of low GFNs and an initial high bank exposure to the government, result in moderate risks under a macro-fiscal and debt holder shock. 
Mitigating factors include a declining share of foreign holdings of local-currency debt, and relatively large cash buffers. Taken together, the MTI 
produces a mechanical "low" signal.

Commentary: The adaptation cost estimates are taken from Aligishiev, Bellon and Massetti (2022) and ESCAP (2019), and 
focus on two types of adaptation investments: strengthening physical assets and investing in coastal protection. In the case of 
Indonesia, these amount to about 0.8 percent of GDP per year over the long-term. Fiscal reforms to create fiscal space to 
finance adaptation needs will be critical over the longer run for Indonesia.

Annex IV. Growth at Risk1 
The Growth at Risk (GaR) framework is used to assess the impact of macro-financial conditions on the 
probability distribution of future real GDP growth for Indonesia. Indonesia’s near-term growth is most 
vulnerable to financial conditions. Downside risks have declined, but a severe slowdown event in China 
could jeopardize the outlook.  
1.      
We apply the Growth at Risk (GaR) framework to Indonesia.2 GaR analysis quantifies the 
impact of macro-financial conditions on the probability distribution of future real GDP growth. A 
large set of variables is aggregated into three 
main regressors—called partitions, using 
principal component analysis. Quarterly data 
coverage runs from q1:1990-q4:2023. For this 
exercise, variables under the financial conditions 
partition include various measures of domestic 
and external financial market returns, bond 
spreads, the real long-term interest rate, the VIX, 
the exchange rate and foreign reserves. 
Macro-financial vulnerabilities include credit 
conditions, debt metrics, house price growth, the 
current account balance, and bank indicators 
(liquid-assets, capital adequacy, and 
equity-to-assets ratio). Other factors include trading-partner growth, commodity prices, and 
consumer confidence. Despite some recent accommodation, financial conditions have tightened 
since 2015, while macro-financial vulnerabilities have recently started to creep up from a low base. 
2.      
Indonesia’s near-term growth is most vulnerable to financial conditions. Tighter 
financial conditions weaken growth 4-quarters ahead especially if initial growth is weak, but the 
impact is not statistically significant over a two-year horizon. Looser macro-financial conditions 
support activity, but only if initial growth is at average (4-quarters) or relatively strong (8-quarters 
ahead).

specification used here is similar to the one used for the 2024 FSAP.

3.      
While downside risks to growth have declined, a severe slowdown event in China 
could jeopardize the outlook. In q4:2022, the post-pandemic recovery indicated a 5 percent 
chance of real GDP contracting by at least 
1.5 percent in the following year. A year later, this 
risk declined as the improvement in 
macro-financial vulnerabilities and the 
improvement in financial conditions more than 
offset the weakening of external factors. However, 
simulations also reveal Indonesia’s sensitivity to 
China’s growth—with a 5 percent probability that 
growth falls to -2.7 percent over the next year in 
the event of a severe downturn (two-standard 
deviations growth shock) in China's economy.

Annex V. Exposures to Geo-Economic Fragmentation (GEF) Risks1 
Geoeconomic fragmentation (GEF) poses risks to Indonesia through several channels—including 
disruptions to commodity markets, reduced capital flows and trade, and weaker global demand and 
knowledge diffusion. Fragmentation in commodities markets—while potentially improving 
terms-of-trade in some scenarios—could lead to more price volatility and lower access to supplies and 
export markets. Indonesia faces similar profiles of vulnerabilities to FDI fragmentation as other major 
EM and regional peers. However, data so far point to ongoing FDI inflows from major sources. 
Domestic efforts on structural reforms that enhance Indonesia’s attractiveness as a production base, 
along with the maintenance of policy buffers, will enhance resilience against GEF. 
1.      
GEF poses risks for Indonesia through several channels. These include commodity market 
disruptions, and reduced capital flows and trade (Aiyar and others, 2023). Long-term reductions of 
global activity, and lower technological development and diffusion would also add headwinds to 
Indonesia’s pursuit of faster potential growth. 
2.      
Fragmentation of key commodities markets could prove disruptive given Indonesia’s 
economic structure (IMF, 2023b). As a major commodity exporter, geopolitical supply disruptions 
may improve Indonesia’s terms of trade, but trigger adverse price movements if GEF reduce market 
access. As a commodity importer, risks are clear: given supply concentration, geopolitical shocks 
may lead to import price spikes. Prices would be more volatile, reflecting lower capacity in smaller 
fragmented markets to absorb shocks (e.g., a bad harvest). Finally, commodities fragmentation could 
pose challenges to Indonesia’s pursuit of placing itself in strategic value chains, for instance, if it 
raises hurdles to accessing key minerals from geopolitically distant economies. 
3.      
Like its peers, Indonesia faces vulnerabilities to FDI fragmentation. FDI plays an 
important role in connecting EMs to global value chains, and as a conduit for the transfer of 
productivity-enhancing technologies. GEF-induced FDI relocation would then pose challenges to 
growth. A recently developed IMF country-level multi-dimensional index of vulnerability is used to 
assess re-shoring risks to existing FDI stocks, finding risk levels for Indonesia comparable to other 
EM and regional peers, based on three dimensions (IMF, 2023a): 
• 
Geopolitical. This captures the idea that reshoring risk rises with the share of investments 
sourced from more geopolitically distant economies. Indonesia’s measure of risk in this 
dimension is above the median for all countries, which is typical of EMs in Asia and the G20. The 
relatively elevated risk reflects looser geopolitical ties to the major FDI sources (AEs).  
• 
Market Power. This can help offset geopolitical risk, if a country’s dominant position in many 
markets makes it difficult to find alternate places to relocate production. Indonesia’s position in 
several industries (e.g., mining) offers some protection, as per its below-median score. However,

INDONESIA 
76 
INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND 
Indonesia is a relatively small player in most industries in which it hosts FDI, leaving it vulnerable 
if reshoring pressures were to arise.  
• 
Strategic. Indonesia—like most G20 economies—hosts a variety of investments in strategic 
sectors which may be targeted by reshoring policies of the source economy, increasing 
Indonesia’s vulnerability. 
4.      
While trade and investment reallocation has risen globally, recent investment flows do 
not point to shifts away from Indonesia. Amid heightened tensions between China and some AEs, 
a comparison of recent announcements for inward greenfield FDI points to continuing flows from 
both source groups thus far. Further, reallocated trade and investment could create opportunities 
for both closely aligned economies, and for some non-aligned economies which could emerge as 
connector countries, serving as a conduit for trade between opposing blocs (Gopinath and others, 
2024). Unlike some regional and EM peers (e.g., Vietnam, Mexico), signs of Indonesia playing such a 
connector role are not yet apparent. 
 
 
 
 
5.      
GEF may leave the economy worse off. IMF analysis suggests that while non-aligned 
economies that remain open to all may suffer the least from fragmentation, the reduction in 
long-term external demand due to an overall smaller global economy may outweigh any gains from 
trade and investment diversion (IMF, 2023c). Further, non-alignment vis-à-vis blocs may lead to 
policy uncertainty regarding future alignment, thereby potentially deterring FDI. 
6.      
Multilateral and domestic efforts are needed to reduce GEF risks and build resilience. 
Multilateral efforts are key to dampen geopolitical tensions and set guardrails against GEF 
disruptions. Domestically, horizontal structural reforms that make Indonesia a more attractive 
destination for investment and production—including through transparent, simple, and predictable 
frameworks—would not only build resilience against reshoring pressures but help attract investment 
flows. These could include, inter alia, upgrading the competition framework, bolstering logistics 
performance and infrastructure, fostering economic openness, and strengthening governance 
(see Section E). In a more shock-prone world, maintaining policy buffers will be critical for resilience.

Annex VI. Fiscal Framework1 
The current fiscal rule has served Indonesia well as a pillar of macroeconomic stability. While there 
may be some room for enhancements, it should not come at the expense of the framework’s credibility, 
simplicity, and enforceability. Reforms to improve flexibility within the rule, coupled with stronger 
domestic revenue mobilization and public financial management would go a long way in supporting 
the needed pro-growth spending, while preserving fiscal prudence and sustainability.  
1.      
Indonesia’s current fiscal rule has served 
well as a pillar of macroeconomic stability. Since 
1967, Indonesia has had a fiscal rule in place, 
composed of a deficit ceiling of 3 percent of GDP, 
and since 2004 a debt ceiling of 60 percent of GDP, 
both covering the consolidated central and local 
government (charts). This approach to designing a 
fiscal rule is broadly aligned with international 
practice (Lledó and others, 2017; IMF 2018).2 Deficits 
have been well-within the ceiling, except when 
these rules were temporary lifted via a presidential 
decree during the pandemic (chart). 
 
 
 
2.      
Regularly evaluating the adequacy of fiscal rules is generally a good practice. This is 
reasonable, especially after large shocks such as the pandemic; but should be guided by a clear 
cost-benefit analysis, to preserve fiscal credibility and discipline (IMF 2009). In addition, the rules 
should not be viewed as operational targets (these should be set up through annual and 
medium-term budgeting), rather they constitute guardrails beyond which macro-fiscal sustainability 
could be put at risk. Given this purpose, it is not optimal to task fiscal rules with the specific 
 
1 Prepared by Amr Hosny (FAD).  
2 Recent surveys on fiscal rules suggest that about 70 countries worldwide had a fiscal framework with an explicit cap 
on public debt. About 80 percent of those countries also have additional operational rules on the expenditure or 
budget balance (IMF 2018; Eyraud and others 2018).

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND 79 
objective of enabling growth, which is best addressed through structural reforms and adequate 
fiscal policy design (e.g., see below on reforms on revenue and spending composition). 
3.      
Fiscal rules should balance simplicity, enforceability and flexibility. These three 
principles are difficult to achieve simultaneously (Eyraud and others 2018). The current fiscal rule is 
an asset to Indonesia, and largely achieves these three main principles. It is simple, complied with, 
and has a demonstrated degree of needed flexibility. 
• 
Simplicity. The rule is inspired by the simplicity embedded in the first generation of fiscal rules, 
which appeared before the global financial crisis (GFC), including the Maastricht criteria 
developed in Europe in the early 1990’s. It is easy to understand and verifiable. 
• 
Enforceability. The rule is enforceable by legislation, and a legacy of hard-won fiscal prudence 
and pragmatism. This is implemented through prudent medium-term fiscal frameworks and 
annual budgets, and in case of any envisaged higher deficits, then revised budgets are required 
with parliamentary approval and continued adherence to the deficit ceiling. Other country 
experiences, especially in the so-called second-generation fiscal rules post-GFC, include 
introducing independent fiscal councils to monitor compliance. 
• 
Flexibility. Finally, the temporary suspension of the deficit rule during the pandemic in 2020-22, 
and the fact that the deficit ceiling was restored a year earlier than planned, show that 
Indonesia’s current system has some built-in flexibility which has not presented a binding 
constraint in the past. Other countries attempted to increase flexibility by including rules 
adjusting for the business cycle, like structural balance rules meant to provide more policy room 
during cyclical downturns. However, experience suggests these are more difficult to operate and 
implement (Eyraud and others 2018), and may increase complexities (Schaechter and others 
2012) that affect the rules’ simplicity. 
4.      
Escape clauses and embedded corrective mechanisms can provide additional flexibility 
within a fiscal rule in dealing with rare events. According to IMF (2009) and Schaechter and 
others (2012), a well-designed escape clause should include: (i) a limited range of factors (e.g., 
severe recession or exogenous shocks) that allow such escape clauses to be triggered in legislation, 
with clear definitions of such events and whether it can be invoked based on a forecast or must 
await an actual event; (ii) how long the fiscal rule should be suspended for when the escape clause is 
triggered; and (iii) specification on the path back to the rule and treatment of accumulated 
deviations.3 In case of (near) breaches, some countries require corrective mechanisms, for example 
invoking automatic freezes on aggregate or certain spending items (IMF 2017). It is important to 
note, however, that while escape clauses may provide some flexibility, they may also jeopardize the 
rules framework’s simplicity and enforceability features and unduly complicate fiscal policy design 
(Eyraud and others 2018).

5.      
The evidence on the cyclicality of Indonesia’s fiscal policy is mixed. Over the past 
decade, fiscal policy in Indonesia was, at different points in time, both pro-cyclical and 
counter-cyclical, with respect to the business cycle.4 Fiscal policy tended to be pro-cyclical with 
respect to commodity prices—for instance, government expenditure exhibited strong correlations 
(0.5-0.7) with commodity prices over the past decade. 
 
 
 
6.      
An illustrative scenario of sustained deficits would put debt on an upward trend. An 
illustrative exercise, assuming higher spending leading to sustained fiscal deficits of around 
3 percent of GDP over the next 5 years would put public debt on an upward—albeit gradual—trend, 
reaching 41 percent of GDP by 2029, all else (macro and financing assumptions) equal. While this is 
below the formal 60 percent of GDP debt ceiling, it carries significant risks of potential breaches of 
the 3 percent deficit ceiling, along with risks to fiscal space, investor sentiment and thereby cost of 
new market financing. A worsening of financing terms could erode fiscal space further, given 
Indonesia’s already high debt service-to-revenue ratio; this puts a premium on prioritizing domestic 
revenue mobilization to finance needed development spending while continuing to treat the deficit 
cap as a ceiling—rather than a target. 
 
 
 
 
4 Some studies argue that one should look at the cyclicality of public spending, because tax receipts are endogenous 
with respect to the business cycle, and expenditure better reflects discretionary fiscal policy (Bova and others 2014; 
Ilzethki and Vegh 2008; Frankel and others 2013; Kaminsky and others 2004; Dabla-Norris and others 2010). 
However, we have not seen evidence of procyclicality between real spending and the output gap for 2010-19. 


INDONESIA 
INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND 81 
7.      
Complementary reforms would further enhance fiscal space. Targeted revenue and 
public financial management (PFM) measures would help the country achieve its objectives without 
hampering macro-fiscal sustainability. 
• 
Domestic revenue mobilization can 
enhance fiscal space, especially as Indonesia 
is at the low end of revenue collection 
compared to peers (chart). Adding 
1-3 points to the tax-to-GDP ratio over time, 
through tax policy and administration 
measures in line with earlier capacity 
development work by the Fund (see 
Appendix V of the 2022 AIV and Appendix IV 
of the 2020 AIV), would provide room for 
expanding pro-growth spending while 
maintaining the current rule and avoiding 
risks. 
• 
PFM and spending reforms. Enhanced macro-policy planning, including by strengthening the 
medium-term fiscal and budgetary frameworks (MTFF and MTBF, respectively) would help set 
sustainable targets within the guardrails of the fiscal rule and to serve as forward guidance to 
annual budgets. An MTFF underpinned by a well-calibrated MTO set up on a (multi-year) rolling 
basis could also help support more systematic counter-cyclical policymaking.5 Spending policy 
reforms could provide for higher quality of spending (e.g., allocation and efficiency of spending 
as in the WB’s 2017 PEFA and the Fund’s 2019 PIMA), energy subsidy reform (as discussed in 
2020 AIV SIP), and improved execution of decentralized spending by local governments. 
• 
Coverage. Limitations in institutional coverage in the rule may open loopholes that circumvent 
and undermine the credibility of fiscal rules (IMF 2009). Successful fiscal rules generally have a 
broad institutional and economic coverage (Eyraud and others 2018), as this permits a 
transparent and comprehensive view of fiscal activities, also allowing to better gauge policy 
tradeoffs. Fiscal activities, such as off-budget operations by SOEs, while not part of the current 
institutional coverage of Indonesia’s consolidated general government (and thus the coverage 
of fiscal rules), should be monitored to avoid build-up of fiscal risks in line with recent Fund TA. 
Ongoing capacity development by the Fund on improving the classification and reporting of 
Government Finance Statistics (GFS) along the GFS Manual 2014 would also be helpful. 
 
 
 
5 As illustration, the MTO could be defined in terms of an anchor—such as the overall or structural balance—set for 
the end of the medium term. This could then be complemented with expenditure ceilings defined over a rolling 
multi-year window: the expenditure ceilings would be such that implied structural balances are consistent with 
projected cyclical stance (output gaps) over the medium term.

Annex VII. Determinants of Effective Tax Administrations: The 
International Experience1 
The elected administration has pledged to raise the total revenue by 10 ppts from 13 percent of GDP, 
including by establishing a new National Revenue Agency (NRA) and enhancing revenue collection 
processes. A survey of the literature suggests that raising revenue collection would also require 
sustained revenue administration reforms and modernization. Key factors to effective revenue 
administrations include compliance risk management, use of third-party data, digitalization, 
appropriate staffing, and broader taxpayer bases. 
1.      
The elected administration has pledged 
to raise Indonesia’s revenue-to-GDP ratio. To 
this end, proposals focus on establishing a new 
National Revenue Agency (NRA) and enhancing 
revenue collection processes. The focus on 
domestic revenue mobilization is welcome. 
Revenue-to-GDP ratio in Indonesia is lower than 
peers, and raising it–as pledged–by 10 ppts from 
around 13 percent of GDP is an ambitious goal; 
achieving it—even partially—would provide 
significant resources to support Indonesia’s 
priority spending needs while preserving prudent 
macro-fiscal settings. 
2.      
Indonesia’s tax administration is 
currently housed as a General Directory within 
the Ministry of Finance. The Directorate General 
of Taxes (DGT) of the MOF focuses mainly on tax 
collections, similar to peers. Administrations can 
be classified as follows: 
• 
By Institutional Arrangement. Per the 
International Survey on Revenue 
Administration (ISORA)2, tax institutional arrangements are typically grouped into 
(1) directorate(s) within the Ministry of Finance or its equivalent, or (2) semi-autonomous 
 
1 Prepared by Amr Hosny (FAD).  
2 ISORA is a joint survey by the IMF, IOTA, OECD, ADB and CIAT. The survey gathers data on collections, institutional 
structure, budget and human resources, segmentation, taxpayer registration, filing and payment, services and 
education, collection and enforcement, inspection, audit and investigations, and dispute resolutions. ISORA database 
is available online here; it covers 155 countries representing around 90 percent of world GDP.

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND 
bodies3 with or without a management board. Semi-autonomous bodies are generally 
established to provide increased autonomy in human resources and budgeting matters, and to 
afford some level of insulation from political interference.  
• 
By Responsibility Area. There are two basic types of tax administration in terms of main 
responsibility: (1) those in which tax and customs administrations are separate organizational 
entities and (2) those in which tax and customs administrations are co-managed in the same 
organization (Crandall 2010, OECD 2019, ADB 2020, Crandall et al 2021, ADB 2022).  
• 
Indonesia’s arrangement. Indonesia’s DGT is a single directory within the Ministry of Finance, 
covering only tax administration. This is similar to the majority of arrangements worldwide 
(40 percent) and in ASEAN (above 50 percent). The ADB (2020) provides similar evidence where 
the semi-autonomous structure is more common in Africa and South America than in Asia. In 
terms of organizational design, most countries have a hybrid form largely based on functional 
(e.g. audit, returns and payments, collection, taxpayer services) and taxpayer segment (e.g. large 
taxpayers office) design criteria (Kidd 2010, WB 2010). 
3.      
Independent revenue systems should not be viewed as a panacea and a diagnostic is 
advised to determine what features may be most beneficial to achieve the expected benefits. 
Kidd and Crandall (2006) and Crandall (2010) argue that establishing independent revenue 
authorities should not be viewed as a panacea and advise countries to consider strategies for reform 
based on international best practice. Before considering any institutional model, revenue 
administrations should clearly identify and articulate their key deficiencies and assess the extent to 
which each model might resolve these. Political commitment is, in any case, vital in sustaining an 
effective revenue administration. Moreover, an independent agency model alone need not lead to 
improved effectiveness and/or taxpayer compliance, and its establishment must be coupled with a 
serious commitment to and plan for reform. In a comparative study of international country 
experiences of integration of revenue administrations, WB (2010) notes the inability to provide 
systematic or quantifiable cost-benefit analysis of revenue system integration. This can be due to the 
difficulty in disentangling cost and/or benefits from integration versus other modernization efforts, 
as well as macroeconomic and structural factors.  
4.      
Modernizing tax and customs administrations–even if integrated–is a long-term 
process. The rationale for merging tax and customs administrations is the expected administrative 
synergy and economies of scale of combining operational functions to improve revenue collection 
and services (Crandall 2010, WB 2010). That said, the WB (2010) also highlights the importance of 
understanding that institution building within an integrated revenue authority is a long-term goal 
and requires persistent effort even after the integration is largely accomplished. Kidd and Crandall 
 
3 Varying degrees of autonomy are possible; hence “semi-autonomy” reflects a range within the autonomy spectrum 
(Crandall et al 2021, Crandall 2010). Semi-autonomous bodies also include Revenue Authorities (RA). RAs refers to a 
governance model for revenue administration where traditional ministry of finance departments (tax and customs 
administrations) are established as a separate organization with a degree of autonomy from government 
(Kidd and Crandall 2006, Crandall 2010). 


INDONESIA 
INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND 85 
(2006) further argue that modernization of revenue administrations is ultimately the result of 
improvements in organizational structures, systems, and processes. A move to implement a new 
governance model for the revenue administration can thus only be, at best, a first step. Along similar 
lines, Adan et al (2023) report empirical evidence that while tax administration reforms may lead to 
some initial gains, it could take time for the full results to be realized.  
5.      
Indonesia could strengthen its revenue administration efficiency further. The 
assessment may be based on the “cost of collection” as a proxy measure of a tax administration’s 
efficiency, following OECD (2019). This indicator 
is computed as the annual operating 
expenditures of a tax administration as a share 
of total net revenues collected. The ratio 
compares inputs (administrative costs) to 
outputs (revenues), although there are caveats 
(i.e., other factors that can influence the ratio 
such as tax policy or macroeconomic changes, 
differences in tax structures, and/or in range of 
functions and revenues administered). In 
Indonesia, this ratio was about 1.2 percent in 
2017, somewhat higher than the ASEAN and EM 
averages, and higher than for advanced markets 
(AMs). 
6.      
The practices and characteristics of tax administration agencies matter significantly for 
tax performance; key factors include rigorous compliance risk management, use of 
third-party data, digitalization, autonomy, and appropriate staffing. The operational strength of 
the agency generally comprises compliance risk management (CRM) practices, the use of third-party 
data (TPD), degree of digitalization of services, service orientation, public accountability, and 
autonomy. Chang et al (2020) and Adan et al (2023) find empirical evidence that such factors are 
tightly associated with tax collections. Regardless of the institutional arrangement in place, the 
literature has identified several factors that are ultimately key to an effective revenue administration. 
Lessons include:  
• 
Good practice stipulates that revenue 
administrations have adequate autonomy 
over their decisions. Revenue bodies 
should have adequate autonomy, 
particularly in designing their organization, 
devising plans and objectives, managing 
budgets, and dealing with important human 
resource management matters (ADB 2020). 
Stronger autonomy can reduce 
management impediments while 
 
 


INDONESIA 
86 
INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND 
maintaining accountability and transparency (Crandall 2010). The ISORA 2018 survey indicates 
that Indonesia’s DGT does not independently design its own structure, operating budget, and 
capital budget. The DGT, however, does have autonomy to set its performance standards (for 
example on processing tax returns and refunds, collection, audits, and resolving disputes). The 
DGT also prepares and publishes an annual report, as in most countries. While this set-up is 
slightly more common in ASEAN countries, most other countries (including by all income levels) 
report having relatively more authority on such decisions. This is noticeably the case for 
countries with semi-autonomous structures (ADB 2020).  
• 
Digitalization of tax administration services is especially relevant. For instance, Nose and 
Mengistu (2023) find a strong empirical association between digital tax administration 
operations and improved revenue collection 
outcomes. They also find that realization of 
revenue gains is heavily contingent on 
accompanying policies, legislative and 
administrative reforms, and the availability 
of adequate digital connectivity and capable 
tax administration staff. In Indonesia, 
according to the ISORA 2018 survey, the 
share of tax returns filed online (a proxy for 
digitalization) is quite high, performing 
notably better than peers. The ADB (2020) 
reports similar evidence with a focus on 
Asian countries. 
• 
Amongst sound practices of tax administration, CRM and the use of TPD are particularly 
important. To enhance tax collection, tax administration reform efforts should prioritize: 
(i) strengthening CRM including by adopting 
automated risk profiling and electronic 
audits; and (ii) utilizing TPD by adopting 
computer systems for processing the data 
and prefilling returns (Chang et al 2020). 
Indonesia, as several peers, has a formal 
CRM approach, covering return filing, 
payment processing, collection 
enforcement, verification/audit and taxpayer 
services. The DGT does not publish key risk 
areas or results of addressing them publicly, 
as in several peers. The ADB (2020) reports 
similar evidence with a focus on Asian 
countries. 
 
 


INDONESIA 
INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND 87 
• 
Adequately staffing tax administration agencies is important. For instance, Chang et al 
(2020) find empirical evidence that increased staffing of a tax agency is associated with 
improved revenue performance up to a threshold of 0.25 percent of the labor force. 
• 
The above factors are highly correlated (Chang et al 2020 and Adan et al 2023). This aligns 
with advice to countries that tax administrative reform benefits derive from the strategic 
integration of multiple components, rather 
the implementation of individual measures. 
For example, it is the effective operation of 
an office or program for large taxpayers that 
matters, rather than the establishment of 
such an office or program (Chang et al 
2020). Data from ISORA suggests that most 
countries (around 85 percent) have a Large 
Taxpayer Office (LTO), defined based on 
variables such as annual sales, income, 
assets, taxes paid and/or type of economic 
activity. LTOs typically contribute a large 
share to overall tax revenues. In Indonesia, 
this share is estimated at around 30 percent, lower than peers. 
7.      
Broadening the taxpayer base is also 
important in economies with relatively high 
labor and output informality. The number of 
active taxpayers (in relation to the labor force or 
total population) also matters for tax collection, 
especially in economies with relatively high 
labor and output informality such as 
Indonesia’s.4 For example, the share of 
registered and active taxpayers of personal 
income taxes (PIT) to total population in 
Indonesia is around 10 percent. This is relatively 
lower than the shares in ASEAN and EMs of 
around 15 and 17 percent, respectively.

Annex VIII. Non-Financial Corporate Sector Vulnerabilities1 
Indonesia’s nonfinancial corporates (NFCs) have remained relatively resilient during the 
post-pandemic period, with improving financial risk indicators and profitability metrics. However, 
pockets of vulnerability remain in some sectors, while being more predominant in smaller 
publicly-listed firms. In addition, the number of firms with high leverage and limited cash buffers has 
been increasing, suggesting that firms may have less flexibility to smooth shocks going forward. The 
persistence of unproductive and unviable (zombie) firms, if unaddressed, may lower overall 
productivity, investment, and employment in the economy. 
1.      
The NFC sector in Indonesia has weathered the post-pandemic period relatively well, 
with financial risk indicators generally improving. Analysis from a large sample of listed firms in 
Indonesia shows that NFCs, on average, have managed to decrease leverage and increase interest 
coverage ratios (ICR) since the pandemic, while also improving profitability indicators (see the 2024 
Indonesia FSAP for details).2 Debt owed by firms with an ICR below one—an indicator of financial 
distress that measures the ability of a company to service its debt with internal cash flows—has also 
improved (Figure 1).3 These trends support the resilience of the corporate sector going forward. 
2.      
The improvement in firms’ balance 
sheets has, however, been heterogenous 
across sectors and firm sizes. Sectors hardest 
hit by the pandemic, particularly firms 
operating in consumer discretionary, 
industrials, information technology, and 
materials, show a considerable number of firms 
with ICRs below one (2024 Indonesia FSAP). 
Debt owed by firms with low coverage ratios 
seems concentrated in smaller firms, who are 
typically more financially vulnerable and credit 
constrained. While several corporates should be 
able to withstand the materialization of adverse 
economic and financial shocks, the profitability 
of smaller firms could decline significantly 
under stress conditions (2024 FSAP). 
3.      
Some prevailing NFC vulnerabilities 
require, however, close monitoring. Despite 
improvements in ICRs since the pandemic, the debt share of firms with high leverage and low liquid 
assets has trended upwards, standing at 26 percent in 2022, up from 21 percent before the

pandemic (Figure 1).4 The increase in the number of vulnerable firms has been noticeable among 
firms in the non-tradable sector and that produce durable goods, including communication services, 
consumer discretionary, and information technology. Recent studies have found that highly 
leveraged firms with limited liquid assets typically invest less, are less profitable, face higher 
financing costs, and are at a higher risk of entering financial distress (Fahlenbrach et al. 2021, 
Albuquerque 2024). In an adverse scenario, these high-debt firms with limited cash buffers could 
potentially face more difficulties in accessing external funding to finance their investment spending.  
4.      
The persistence of unproductive and unviable (zombie) firms may delay a necessary 
creative destruction and negatively affect the prospects for long-term productivity growth. 
The share of zombie firms rose since the GFC, from a trough of 6.2 percent of all listed firms in 2013 
to 10.8 percent in 2022 (Figure 2).5 This compares with 9.5 percent in 2019, just before the pandemic 
hit. The share in 2022 is similar when considering the debt owed by zombie firms, although the 
latter has declined recently. The persistence and increase of zombie firms during the pandemic may 
reflect, to some extent, the unprecedented policy support and easy financing conditions during the 
pandemic. Although policy support, including forbearance measures, seemed to have been critical in 
mitigating the pandemic shock, they may have helped unviable firms stay afloat, delaying a 
necessary restructuring of firms that were already unviable and unprofitable before the pandemic. 
While zombification of the Indonesian corporate sector remains at moderate levels, it stands at 
higher levels relative to several regional peers. In addition, evidence suggests that the presence of 
zombie firms creates congestion effects on healthy firms competing with zombie firms, leading to 
lower overall productivity, investment, and employment in the economy (Caballero et al., 2008, 
McGowan et al., 2018, Acharya et al., 2019, Banerjee and Hofmann, 2022, Albuquerque and Iyer, 
2023, Albuquerque and Mao 2023). Moreover, there is heterogeneity across sectors; zombification is 
assessed to be more prevalent in durable goods industries, such as materials, industrials, and 
consumer discretionary (Figure 2). Within these sectors, debt owed by zombie firms in construction 
is particularly high at 33 percent of all the debt in the sector at the end of 2022. These sectors are 
typically more subject to large swings in demand and were also hardest hit by the pandemic. 
5.      
International evidence shows that the negative spillovers from zombification can be 
mitigated by limiting lenders’ incentives to engage in zombie lending practices and by 
improving insolvency frameworks. The experience in Japan in the early-90s showed that 
low-capitalized banks faced incentives to continue lending to zombie firms to prevent them from 
defaulting, as this would lead these banks to breach regulatory capital requirements (Caballero et al. 
2008). More recent evidence on the relationship between low-capitalized banks and zombie lending 
dates back to the post-GFC period in some European countries (Acharya et al. 2019). The overall 
finding is that strengthening the banking sector and tightening supervision seemed to have helped 
 
4 Firms with high leverage and low liquid assets in each year fall in the top quartile of the debt-to-asset distribution 
and in the bottom quartile of the net liquid asset ratio. The latter is computed as current assets net of current 
liabilities over total assets; it measures how much liquidity firms can immediately use to mitigate shocks. 
5 The definition of zombie firms follows Albuquerque and Iyer (2023), who resort to three balance sheet indicators 
that aim at capturing firms that are most likely in financial distress and are persistently unprofitable: (i) ICR below 
one, (ii) leverage ratio above the median firm in the same industry, and (iii) negative real sales growth. These 
indicators need to persist for at least two consecutive years to minimize misclassification from cyclical fluctuations.

tackled zombification in these areas. On this front, the 2024 Indonesia FSAP stresses that banks are 
highly capitalized and resilient, which should limit the negative spillovers from zombification in 
Indonesia. International evidence, however, also shows that strong banks may, however, not be 
enough to mitigating zombie lending if insolvency frameworks are not well-prepared to deal with 
the restructuring or insolvency of firms (Andrews and Petroulakis 2019, Becker and Ivashina 2022, 
Albuquerque et al. 2023). This strand of research underlines that resolving financially distressed firms 
quickly and at a low-cost can mitigate zombie lending incentives. Using a recent indicator 
developed by Araujo et al. (2022)—measuring countries' preparedness to handle a large-scale 
restructuring of corporates—we find that Indonesia ranks considerably lower in crisis preparedness 
relative to regional peers.6 By limiting zombie lending incentives, improving insolvency frameworks 
may therefore yield considerable benefits for economic growth and productivity in Indonesia.

The overall financial performance of Indonesia’s listed NFCs is relatively weaker than 
in ASEAN peers. Regression analysis that controls for time-varying sectoral shocks indicates that 
listed Indonesian NFCs tend, on average, to 
underperform their ASEAN peers on several 
balance sheet metrics.7 Firms in Indonesia 
invest less, both in tangible and intangible 
assets, have weaker employment growth, 
and exhibit more signs of financial distress, 
as indicated by a lower ICR, higher 
probability of default (in 24 months), higher 
leverage, and also a higher cost of debt 
(Figure 3). On the latter, the estimates 
indicate that the average firm in Indonesia 
has a cost of debt of around 0.4 standard 
deviations above the ASEAN firm. While 
there may be several firm-specific reasons 
behind the relative financial performance of 
Indonesian firms, these results underscore 
the need to continue implementing 
structural reforms that promote an 
enabling business environment and create 
the conditions for healthy firms in 
Indonesia to prosper.

Annex IX. Financial Digitalization1 
Digital financial services (DFS) have grown rapidly in Indonesia, supported by authorities’ initiatives to 
enhance financial inclusion. A comparative analysis with peers suggests that there is still room for 
improvement. Analysis on the inter-regional difference and catch-up in Person-to-Person (P2P) 
lending activities indicates that reducing the digitalization and financial literacy gap is crucial to 
enhance DFS and financial inclusion. Efforts to strengthen regulation and supervision framework to 
address potential risks and enhance resilience in the DFS sector should continue, while also fostering 
innovation. 
1.      
Indonesia has made significant strides in the digitalization of its financial sector 
(Figure 1). The value of e-money transactions increased over 30 percent per year since 2019, 
reducing the dominance of cash-based payments in the economy. The value and volume of digital 
banking transactions have also grown fast, especially for mobile banking. Fintech P2P lending and 
digital investment (e.g., robo-advisor) have expanded rapidly, though the scale is still relatively small.

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND 95 
2.      
This swift transformation has been enabled by authorities’ initiatives. Bank Indonesia 
(BI) established the Indonesia Payment System Blueprint (BSPI) 2025 to support a rapidly growing 
economic and financial digitalization. This includes 
the introduction of standardized QR codes (QRIS) 
to enhance interoperability in 2019. Since 
inception, QRIS transactions volume and value 
have exponentially increased. Additionally, as part 
of BSPI 2025, BI initiated operation of BI-FAST, a 
modernized real-time payment system, in 
December 2021. BI-FAST offers faster, safer, scaled 
24/7 fund transfer services, compared to existing 
infrastructure such as Real Time Gross Settlement 
(RTGS) and National Clearing System (SKNBI). 
SNAP, the payment API standard, also helps 
adopting innovative financial services. OJK, the financial supervisor, is rolling out initiatives such as 
the Digital Financial Innovation Road Map and Action Plan 2020-2024 and 2020-2025 Indonesian 
Banking Development Roadmap, to develop a comprehensive digital financial ecosystem.  
3.      
However, Indonesia’s DFS has scope to deepen further (Figure 2). Indonesia’s digital 
payment transactions value, compared to its economy size, is below the G20 average and lags those 
of Philippines, Thailand, and Vietnam among ASEAN-6 countries. The penetration rate seems lower 
than in G20 peers, reflecting relatively low digital readiness. Likewise, mobile banking penetration 
significantly lags behind G20 and ASEAN-6 countries. While Indonesia appears to lead digital 
lending for business, its size is still small, relative to its economy size. 
4.      
Indonesia’s regional disparities pose 
barriers to advancing DFS. The inter-regional 
difference in outstanding values of P2P lending in 
percent of Gross Regional Domestic Product (GRDP) 
has widened significantly: the outstanding value of 
P2P in the bottom five provinces rose on average by 
0.04 percentage points of GRDP in the last three 
years, while the top five provinces increased by 
0.32 percentage points. Addressing structural 
barriers for DFS expansion in provinces with low 
activities is warranted.

5.      
To assess the determinants of DFS (and P2P2 in particular) across Indonesian 
provinces, we employ a cross-provincial empirical analysis. The empirical equation is:  
             𝑷𝑷𝑷𝑷𝑷𝑷𝒊𝒊,𝟐𝟐𝟐𝟐𝟐𝟐𝟐𝟐−𝑷𝑷𝑷𝑷𝑷𝑷𝒊𝒊,𝟐𝟐𝟐𝟐𝟐𝟐𝟐𝟐= 𝒂𝒂+ 𝒃𝒃𝟏𝟏𝑭𝑭𝑭𝑭𝑭𝑭𝑭𝑭𝑭𝑭𝑭𝑭𝑭𝑭𝑭𝑭𝑭𝑭𝑭𝑭𝑭𝑭𝑭𝑭𝑭𝑭𝑭𝑭𝑭𝑭𝑭𝑭𝒚𝒚𝒊𝒊,𝟐𝟐𝟐𝟐𝟐𝟐𝟐𝟐+ 𝒃𝒃𝟐𝟐𝑭𝑭𝑭𝑭𝑭𝑭𝑭𝑭𝑭𝑭𝑭𝑭𝑭𝑭𝑭𝑭𝑭𝑭𝑭𝑭𝑭𝑭𝑭𝑭𝑭𝑭𝑭𝑭𝑭𝑭𝑭𝑭𝑭𝑭𝒏𝒏𝒊𝒊,𝟐𝟐𝟐𝟐𝟐𝟐𝟐𝟐+

where P2P is the outstanding value of P2P lending in percent of GRDP for the year of 2023 or 2020, 
Financial Literacy and Financial Inclusion are given by the corresponding index surveyed by OJK in 
2019, Digitalization represents the degree of digitalization in 2020, and GRDP per capita controls for 
income level; i is the indicator representing each of the 34 provinces. All values are in logarithms, 
except for the P2P-to-GRDP ratio. 
6.      
Digitalization data is from the East Ventures’ Digitalization Competitiveness Index 
(DCI) but needs to be adjusted for financial literacy and inclusion. DCI measures the relative 
distance between provinces in terms of the readiness for digitalization. Specifically, it is an index

consisting of three sub-indexes reflecting three aspects: input, output, and support.3 Financial 
inclusion is embedded in the support aspect, while financial literacy is likely to be highly correlated 
with the output aspect. That is, financial literacy and inclusion are both components of DCI as well as 
individual explanatory variables in the main regression, warranting adjustment: the adjusted 
digitalization indicator for the main regression is the residual of an auxiliary equation, which is 
orthogonal to both financial literacy and inclusion,  
𝑫𝑫𝑫𝑫𝑰𝑰𝒊𝒊,𝟐𝟐𝟐𝟐𝟐𝟐𝟐𝟐= 𝒄𝒄+ 𝒅𝒅𝟏𝟏𝑭𝑭𝑭𝑭𝑭𝑭𝑭𝑭𝑭𝑭𝑭𝑭𝑭𝑭𝑭𝑭𝑭𝑭𝑭𝑭𝑭𝑭𝑭𝑭𝑭𝑭𝑭𝑭𝑭𝑭𝑭𝑭𝒚𝒚𝒊𝒊,𝟐𝟐𝟐𝟐𝟐𝟐𝟐𝟐+ 𝒅𝒅𝟐𝟐𝑭𝑭𝑭𝑭𝑭𝑭𝑭𝑭𝑭𝑭𝑭𝑭𝑭𝑭𝑭𝑭𝑭𝑭𝑭𝑭𝑭𝑭𝑭𝑭𝑭𝑭𝑭𝑭𝑭𝑭𝑭𝑭𝑭𝑭𝒏𝒏𝒊𝒊,𝟐𝟐𝟐𝟐𝟐𝟐𝟐𝟐+ 𝒖𝒖𝒊𝒊 
while Financial Literacy and Financial Inclusion can now be used unadjusted in the main equation. 
7.      
The result suggests financial literacy and digitalization have played a significant role in 
DFS growth. As expected, the degree of digitalization has a positive impact on the growth of P2P 
lending. The estimation suggests that 
one-standard-deviation increase in 
digitalization is associated with the 
0.06-percentage point increase in the 
P2P-to-GRDP ratio. Financial literacy also 
supports adaptation of new financial services. 
Financial inclusion’s impact turns out to be 
insignificant to the P2P lending expansion, 
suggesting that the P2P lending growth did 
not matter for the larger demand. The 
negative coefficient of regional income per 
capita suggests less demand for alternative 
lending in high-income regions. 
8.      
The result calls for examining the 
possible existence of club convergence 
dynamics across provinces, as well as the 
determinants of club membership. This 
would imply that different types of provinces 
have a different level of convergence point. 
Classical beta-convergence testing4 for all 
provinces indicates that inter-regional gaps in 
P2P lending activities generally widen over 
time, with a statistically significant, positive 
 
3 The sub-index for input reflects human resources and expenditure for ICT, and ICT utilization, while the one for 
output measures of digital economy activities, including DFS. The support sub-index is based on the information on 
infrastructure, financial inclusion, local government regulation and capacity. 
4 A model for the test is based on the literature (e.g., Sala-i-Martin, 1996) such that P2Pi,2023 – P2Pi,2020 =𝛼𝛼+ 
βP2Pi,2020+γXi+ei, where P2P and X are the P2P-to-GRDP ratio and the determinants included in the regression for 
P2P lending growth. A (statistically significant) negative coefficient on the initial level (β<0) suggests a (conditional) 
convergence. Unconditional convergence test can be done by dropping the control variables (X).

coefficient on the initial level of P2P lending. Given the inter-regional disparity of digital and human 
capital and their pivotal role evidenced earlier, this finding is not unexpected. However, it remains 
conceivable that regions with similar levels of capital could converge in P2P lending activities. 
Understanding whether this is the case—and if so, which determinants determine clustered 
convergence—can offer policy implications on how to help regions in “low” clubs advance to a club 
with a higher-level P2P lending, resulting in enhanced financial access and strengthened financial 
inclusion.  
9.      
To test for club convergence, we follow Philip and Sul (2007, 2009, hereafter PS) and 
Schnurbus et al. (2017, see Technical Annex). The PS approach identifies four convergence clubs. 
Group A constitutes 14 provinces, including most Java Island provinces. Club B, C and D include 10, 
3 and 7 provinces respectively. The upper panel of Figure 3 shows the group average of P2P lending 
in percent of GRDP. As of December 2023, group A stands at the highest level of 0.35 percent with a 
significant distance to the second group B at 0.18 percent, followed by group C and D at merely 
0.11 percent and 0.07 percent respectively. Each group appears to converge to a group-specific 
level, while the convergence rate is larger in group B and D than group A and C (Figure 3 lower 
panel). 
 
10.      A logit/probit analysis for 
the determinants of the club 
membership confirms the findings 
in the cross-provincial empirical 
analysis for the determinants of 
P2P lending growth. Provinces with 
higher financial literacy turn out 
more likely to be in a group with a 
higher convergence point. The 
degree of digitalization in a province 
is also positively associated with the 
chance to belong in group A. 
However, financial inclusion remains 
statistically insignificant. Again, the

11.      Findings suggest that reducing digitalization and financial literacy gaps is crucial for 
fostering DFS. Indonesia’s internet penetration improved rapidly from 47.7 percent of population 
(above 5 years old) in 2019 to 66.5 percent in 2022, 
but this was led by an acceleration in provinces 
with already high penetration rate, possibly 
accentuating divergences. The lowest 
province-level penetration rate rose from 
21.7 percent to 26.3 percent during the same 
period, while the highest rate increased from 
64.9 percent to 74.3 percent, resulting in a 
widening of the provincial gap between highest 
and lowest by 6.6 percentage points. Financial

of subnational financial literacy rose only by 2.6 for 2019-22, while the highest increased by 8.1). 
Thus, reducing inter-regional gaps is warranted to clearing constraints to DFS. 
12.      Efforts to strengthen regulation and supervision framework to address potential risks 
and enhance resilience in DFS should also continue. 2024 FSAP findings indicate a rapid market 
expansion of P2P lending quickly outpaced regulation, leading to the increasing need for policies 
preventing fraud and other misconduct; OJK’s new guidelines for fintech lending—promoting 
transparency and sustainability and ensuring the protection of consumer interests—are welcome. 
Authorities should also strengthen cooperation for regulation and supervision, given the presence of 
large technology conglomerates and cross-cutting services.

13.      To test the club convergence, we use the approach suggested by Philip and Sul (2007, 
2009, hereafter PS) and Schnurbus et al. (2017).  
• 
Log t convergence test. The PS model uses a log t regression model for convergence test, 
assuming a factor model decomposing a panel data yit as 
𝐥𝐥𝐥𝐥𝐥𝐥𝒚𝒚𝒊𝒊𝒊𝒊= 𝒈𝒈𝒊𝒊𝒊𝒊+ 𝒂𝒂𝒊𝒊𝒊𝒊 
where yit is the P2P-to-GRDP ratio of province i at time t5. git represents systematic components, 
including permanent common components, and ait represents transitory components. To separate 
common from idiosyncratic components in this panel, the PS model suggests transforming the 
factor model to 
𝐥𝐥𝐥𝐥𝐥𝐥𝒚𝒚𝒊𝒊𝒊𝒊= ቀ
𝒈𝒈𝒊𝒊𝒊𝒊+𝒂𝒂𝒊𝒊𝒊𝒊
𝛍𝛍𝒕𝒕
ቁ𝛍𝛍𝒕𝒕= 𝛅𝛅𝒊𝒊𝒊𝒊𝛍𝛍𝒕𝒕,                                for all i and t, 
where 𝝁𝝁𝒕𝒕 is a single common component, and 𝜹𝜹𝒊𝒊𝒊𝒊 is a time-varying idiosyncratic element, 
governing the deviation from the common path among the whole panel units. This transformation 
allows to estimate the relative transition path (hit),

𝑵𝑵𝜹𝜹𝒊𝒊𝒊𝒊 . 
If convergence holds, hit converges to unity. Then, a quadratic distance measure for transition 
differential (Ht) can be applied as 
𝑯𝑯𝒕𝒕= 𝑵𝑵−𝟏𝟏∑

𝑵𝑵

5 Note that in the log-transformation unity was added, i.e. yit = P2Pit + 1, to prevent log yit from being negative for the 
ease of calculation of relative transition path (hit).

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND 101 
In case of full convergence, Ht converges to zero as t→∞. Under club convergence, Ht typically 
converges to a positive constant. Finally, the convergence can be tested, by estimating the log t 
regression model suggested by PS (2007): 
𝒍𝒍𝒍𝒍𝒍𝒍
𝑯𝑯𝟏𝟏
𝑯𝑯𝒕𝒕−𝟐𝟐𝐥𝐥𝐥𝐥𝐥𝐥(𝐥𝐥𝐥𝐥𝐥𝐥𝒕𝒕) = 𝒂𝒂+ 𝛃𝛃𝐥𝐥𝐥𝐥𝐥𝐥𝒕𝒕+ 𝒖𝒖𝒕𝒕  
where β can be tested with the null hypothesis of convergence that δit = δ and α ≥ 0 such that 
β=2α.6 Alternative hypothesis, implying non-convergence, is either δit ≠ δ or α < 0. In 
implementing the test, we use HP-filtered trend of log yit, as suggested by PS (2007). 
• 
Clustering algorithm. PS (2007) proposes an algorithm to identify the convergence clubs with the 
following steps: 
i. 
Order provinces in the panel decreasingly according to the last observation. 
ii. 
Choose a core group Gk of k provinces and compute test statistics tk = t(Gk) based on the log 
t regression result. Choose group size k to maximize the test statistic tk subject to min tk 
> -1.65. Where the minimum test statistic is not met with k = 2, drop the first province and 
proceed to maximize tk. 
iii. 
Add a province not in the core group Gk at a time to the core group and run the log t test. 
Include that province in the club candidate group if the test statistic is greater than the 
critical value c = 0, which is set conservatively given small T.  
iv. 
Form a new group of the remaining provinces that are not sieved by step iii. Perform the log 
t test for this group. If the test statistic is greater than -1.65, the algorithm ends with 
two convergence group. Otherwise, repeat steps i-iii until the algorithm ends. The algorithm 
can end with provinces not included in any convergence club if the remaining provinces are 
divergent. 
• 
Club merging. Schnurbus et al. (2017) suggests merging clubs iteratively by fulfilling the 
convergence test jointly with adjacent two clubs until convergence does not hold in a joint test. 
 
 
 
6 PS (2007) defines a relative convergence as lim
𝑡𝑡→∞𝛿𝛿𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖= 𝛿𝛿, for all i, and shows that the log t regression model can be 
applied for the one-sided convergence test with null hypothesis of α ≥ 0, assuming that for all i, δ𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖= δ𝑖𝑖+ σ𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖ξ𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖, where  
σ𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖=

Annex X. Managing Adverse Shocks: An IPF Application1 
As Indonesia pursues its ambitious growth agenda, it will need to navigate a more shock-prone and 
challenging external environment. This annex explores, through the lens of the IMF’s Integrated Policy 
Framework (IPF) and using hypothetical scenarios, the appropriate policy responses to a sharp and 
prolonged slowdown in China, and to U.S. monetary and fiscal policy shocks. The hypothetical 
slowdown in China manifests as a negative shock to external demand—with commodities being an 
important channel. FXI may be an appropriate component of the policy response (along with monetary 
and fiscal policies) only if the shock triggers a risk-off episode. FXI may also be a warranted element of 
the policy response to spillovers from U.S. policy shocks if such shocks were to trigger a risk-off 
sentiment. However, the exchange rate will need to play a large role as a shock absorber. In addition, 
with substantial uncertainty regarding the nature, magnitude, and duration of such shocks, 
policymakers will need to be judicious in the use of both FX reserve and fiscal buffers. Preserving 
buffers will be particularly important in a world where geoeconomic fragmentation is likely to lead to a 
prolonged period of more frequent and volatile external shocks. 
1.      
China’s importance for the global economy—and for Indonesia—has risen sharply in 
the past decades. Along with regional peers, Indonesia’s economy has become increasingly linked 
to China through its central position in global and regional value chains. China’s importance as an 
export market for Indonesia has risen (including for Indonesia’s commodities), and China’s demand 
absorbed about 3 percent of Indonesian value added in 2022. Chinese investments flows—including 
FDI—have also risen in prominence. 
2.      
An analysis of policy responses to spillovers from China is motivated by the country’s 
systemic role in the global economy, and the current period of heightened risks. China’s 
medium-term growth rate is projected to moderate with narrowing scope for catch-up growth and 
other structural constraints, including an ageing population. Besides the ongoing structural 
slowdown projected in the baseline, China’s growth also faces downside risks, including from 
potentially a longer- or deeper-than-expected contraction in the property sector and rising 
geo-economic fragmentation. Given China’s systemic relevance in the global economy, shocks 
originating from the country can have large impacts on global commodity prices and on growth in 
other economies—including Indonesia (IMF, 2024a). Like several Asian currencies, the IDR-USD 
exchange rate increasingly co-moves with the CNY-USD, with shocks from CNY depreciations 
spilling over to regional peers through competitive pressures (IMF, 2024b). 
3.      
At the same time, the U.S. remains the key driver of the global financial cycle, with 
domestic policy developments implying major spillovers for Indonesia and other EMs. Over 
the past decade, several stress periods when the rupiah depreciated sharply against the US dollar 
were associated with shifts in U.S. policy stances, including the Taper Tantrum and the EM stress 
period of 2018. Since the beginning of the Fed’s latest monetary policy tightening cycle, market 
uncertainty about its policy path, along with declining interest rate differentials vis-à-vis the U.S., has

INDONESIA 
104 INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND 
put periodic downward pressure on the rupiah and triggered interventions by BI. Alongside U.S. 
monetary policy, U.S. fiscal policy stance can also be a source for spillovers to EMs. Expansionary U.S. 
fiscal policy, by contributing to higher core inflation (as has been the case since 2021), can trigger 
spillovers by inducing greater monetary policy tightening. Recent IMF analysis suggests sharp 
increases in U.S. Treasury yields lead to surges in government bond yields and exchange rate 
turbulence in EMDEs (IMF, 2024c). Though the response of Indonesia’s sovereign yields to the 
2022-23 surge in the corresponding U.S. yields was relatively muted, recent IMF analysis suggests a 
1 percentage-point increase in the U.S. 10-year Treasury yield is associated with, on average, about a 
100-bps increase in EM 10-year government bond yields over several quarters. In addition, increases 
in U.S. fiscal policy uncertainty—such as during episodes in which the debt ceiling is debated, are 
associated with higher sovereign spreads in EMs. With heightened uncertainty regarding the path of 
U.S. monetary and fiscal policies, a sharp shock could trigger adverse spillovers for Indonesia. 
 
 
 
4.      
We assess policy options to address shocks emanating from the U.S. and China 
through the lens of the IMF’s Integrated Policy Framework (IPF). For open economies with 
flexible exchange rates, the IPF provides a comprehensive basis to assess the joint use of monetary 
policy, FXI, fiscal, macroprudential, and capital flow measures to address shocks. While exchange 
rate flexibility retains an essential stabilizing role under the IPF, under certain conditions, FXI may be 
an appropriate element of an overall policy response. 
5.      
FXI may be warranted if country and shock characteristics satisfy one or more of three 
use cases. First, large capital outflows may trigger sharp and inefficient rise in market premia (e.g., 
UIP premia) in countries with shallow FX markets. FXI can help to contain large UIP deviations, and 
thereby avoid excessive tightening of financial conditions. Second, large exchange rate 
depreciations may trigger stress in economies where corporate sectors have large currency 
mismatches. The use of FXI to limit exchange rate depreciation can contain financial instability. Third, 
in economies where large depreciations could de-anchor inflation expectations, containing such 
depreciations through FXI could support price stability. 
6.      
For Indonesia, shallow FX markets appear to be the key IPF friction. Inflation 
expectations are well-anchored to BI’s target band since adoption of an inflation targeting 
framework in 2005. Corporates’ external FX debt has moderated over the past decade, from about 


INDONESIA 
INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND 105 
16.8 percent in 2015 to about 8.5 percent in 2023, with BI’s prudential hedging and liquidity 
requirements helping to contain FX risks. However, FX markets in Indonesia are shallow compared to 
international peers, despite some recent progress in market deepening. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Model-Based Analysis 
7.      
We use a micro-founded New Keynesian two-economy model to evaluate policy 
options in response to major external shocks, including the role of FXI. The model is a 
linearized version of the Adrian and others (2021) IPF model with potentially shallow FX markets, 
extended to include a supply side, commodities, and a fiscal sector.2  
8.      
We consider several hypothetical scenarios centered on two sources of shocks, with 
scenario variations highlighting key distinctions relevant for the policy mix. 
• 
A hypothetical slowdown in the representative foreign economy. The scenario is intended to 
explore in a stylized setting the impact from a slowdown in China, which may have significant 
 
2 See Indonesia 2023 Article Staff Report, Annex V (Country Report No. 2023/221) for a description of the model. 


INDONESIA 
106 INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND 
real sector implications with possible financial spillovers. Given significant uncertainties 
regarding the nature of such a shock, several variants are considered. In an acute shock scenario, 
a sharper than expected slowdown in the foreign economy is followed by a swift recovery. The 
slowdown in the foreign economy triggers a risk-off sentiment towards EMs and commodities 
exporters, tightening financial conditions. However, the appropriate policy mix in the absence of 
a risk-off shock, as well as to a persistent slowdown in the foreign economy (with and without an 
associated risk-off shock), are also considered.3 
• 
Fiscal and monetary policy shocks in the representative foreign economy. In this stylized 
scenario—intended to explore mainly financial spillovers from the US—policy uncertainty 
increases, with looser-than-expected fiscal policy contributing to higher inflation (but also 
higher demand for imports), and to sharper-than-expected monetary policy tightening. The 
foreign economy’s bond yields rise, which transmits to higher borrowing costs for EMs. These 
combined with higher policy uncertainty in the foreign economy triggers a risk-off shock for 
Indonesia.  
Slowdown in the Foreign Economy 
9.      
An acute slowdown in a representative foreign economy accompanied by a risk-off 
shock is considered. Concretely, the representative foreign economy experiences a demand-driven 
slowdown, with output 8 quarters after the beginning of the shock about 2 percent lower than 
baseline. Commodity prices fall, bottoming out after a 16 percent decline. The slowdown raises 
market concerns about spillovers to other emerging markets and commodity exporters, triggering a 
risk-off reaction modeled as about a 250-bps increase in the UIP premium.4 The shock leads to a 
sharp fall in output below trend, in part due to the fall in commodities exports. The real exchange 
rate depreciates, contributing to a persistent rise in inflation (which would rise by about 0.7 percent 
without monetary policy tightening).5 Three potential policy responses are compared: Monetary 
policy only; monetary policy and FXI; and monetary and FXI complemented by targeted fiscal 
transfers to households (Figure 1).  
• 
Monetary policy only. The central bank hikes the policy rate by 1.2 percent, which reduces the 
inflation peak by half, mainly through higher borrowing costs compressing domestic demand. 
The deviation of output from trend at its trough widens to -1.3 percent after 8 quarters. The 
compression of domestic demand, along with real exchange rate depreciation, reduces imports 
 
3 In the hypothetical acute scenario, the deviation in the foreign economy’s output from baseline after 2 years is 
about 2 percent, similar to the downside scenario in the 2023 Article IV Staff Report for China (Country Report No. 
2024/038). In the stylized persistent shock scenario, the downward level-shift in the foreign economy’s output could 
reflect a combination of worsening structural headwinds relative to the baseline projections, or a 
sharper-than-expected realization of China-OECD decoupling, along the lines of the downside risk scenario analysis 
in IMF (2023b). 
4 For illustrative purposes, similar to levels during the 2018 EM stress period.  
5 In this scenario, the risk-off shock is assumed to trigger a significant exchange rate depreciation, the inflationary 
impact of which offsets the impact of the output shock. This effect could be softened if inflation expectations remain 
well-anchored. 


INDONESIA 
INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND 107 
of non-commodities. While commodities exports largely recover with the foreign economy, the 
real exchange rate depreciation helps boost non-commodities exports, and rising 
non-commodities net exports help return output to trend over time.  
• 
Monetary policy and FXI. The central bank uses FXI—about 2 percent of GDP—along with 
monetary policy. FXI helps to reduce the rise in the UIP premium, and hence limits the exchange 
rate depreciation. The resulting lower inflationary pressures allow the central bank to achieve a 
similar path for core inflation with less monetary policy tightening. Shallower monetary policy 
tightening leads to less domestic demand compression and a smaller fall of output relative to 
trend. The overall output path is more favorable compared to the monetary policy only scenario, 
as stronger domestic demand offsets the somewhat weaker external rebalancing, i.e., a smaller 
rise in net exports. However, the significant use of FXI reduces buffers against future shocks. 
• 
Monetary policy, FXI, and fiscal stimulus. In addition to the interventions above, the authorities 
provide about 0.5 percent of GDP worth of transfers to households during the trough of the 
shock. The transfers further improve the path of output, by supporting domestic demand, and 
could also help reduce inequality. Monetary policy needs to be somewhat tighter than in the 
case without fiscal stimulus to achieve a similar path for core inflation. 
• 
The policy option comprising monetary policy, fiscal stimulus and FXI—along with exchange rate 
flexibility, appears to best balance needed external adjustment with maintaining price stability 
and limiting the hit to domestic demand. FXI, by reducing the inefficient rise in UIP premia from 
the non-fundamental risk-off shock, helps to limit inflationary pressures and potentially 
disruptive tightening of financial conditions, and thereby improves the trade-off for monetary 
policy between price and output stabilization. 
10.      The appropriateness of FXI depends on financial market reactions to the foreign 
economy growth shock. To illustrate, we consider a scenario where the representative foreign 
economy experiences the same shocks—with similar impacts on commodity prices, but financial 
markets remain sanguine about spillovers for Indonesia (Figure 2). In this scenario, financial 
conditions do not tighten excessively, and with less exchange rate depreciation, inflationary 
pressures are moderate. Three policy options are presented: monetary policy only; monetary policy 
combined with fiscal stimulus; and monetary policy combined with FXI. If the starting point for 
inflation is well-within the target band, the central bank may be able to support domestic demand 
and reduce the deviation of output from trend by cutting the policy rate while keeping inflation 
contained. Combining such a monetary policy response with fiscal transfers could further help 
support domestic activity and protect vulnerable households. In comparison, the use of FXI would 
not materially change the deviation of output from trend. Rather, FXI would lead to a relatively 
higher exchange rate, and thereby mainly allow households to maintain imports financed through 
greater external borrowing. The use of FXI would not be warranted in this case. 
11.      A second case looks into a persistent slowdown in a representative major economy. 
Concretely, the representative foreign economy experiences a sharp slowdown in growth, but does 
not quickly bounce back to the pre-shock path. For Indonesia, while the exact path of the economy 


INDONESIA 
108 INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND 
will depend on policy choices (discussed below), the shock tends to lead to a sharp fall of output 
below trend, in part due to the fall in net exports of commodities, which remains persistently lower 
due to the drop in foreign demand. Absent countervailing policy interventions, the shock pushes the 
real exchange rate towards a persistently more depreciated level. Similar to the acute shock, whether 
FXI is a warranted component of the policy mix depends on whether the slowdown in the foreign 
economy is accompanied by a non-fundamental risk-off shock. 
• 
In case of an accompanying risk-off shock, FXI may be appropriate (Figure 3). As in the acute 
shock, FXI can help to contain a rise in the UIP premium and excessive tightening of financing 
conditions. Such an intervention—modeled as an about 2 percent of GDP immediately after the 
shock—also allows the central bank to impose a shallower MP tightening and achieve a better 
balance between domestic demand and price stability. However, exchange rate depreciation 
after the initial FXI plays an important role in allowing the economy to adjust to the persistent 
nature of the shock, supporting the recovery of output by boosting net exports of 
non-commodities.  
• 
Absent the risk-off shock, the use of FXI is likely to delay the necessary adjustment (Figure 4). In 
this case, FXI mainly serves to prop up the exchange rate, facilitating more imports financed by 
higher external borrowing. The boost to domestic demand is offset by lower net exports, leaving 
the deviation of output from trend broadly unchanged. In this case, FXI would not be warranted. 
• 
Similar to FXI, any use of fiscal stimulus will need to be well-targeted, time-bound, and avoid 
hindering the optimal rebalancing of economic activity. Since a persistent adverse shock reflects 
lower permanent incomes, it would be optimal for households to reduce consumption relative 
to the pre-shock baseline. While targeted fiscal support to vulnerable households and firms may 
help contain excessive scars in some cases, such interventions should be time-bound and well-
targeted to facilitate needed adjustment and protect fiscal space. 
Fiscal and Monetary Policy Shocks in the Foreign Economy 
12.      Hypothetical fiscal and monetary policy shocks in a representative major economy. 
Amidst higher policy uncertainty, fiscal expenditures surprise on the upside in the representative 
foreign economy, raising output by about 0.5 percent relative to baseline. Expansionary fiscal policy, 
combined with supply side shocks, leads to a spike in inflation, which rises by about 1.1 percent 
even as the foreign central bank tightens monetary policy by 0.6 percent. The expansionary fiscal 
policy and heightened uncertainty is assumed to cause a persistent rise in the foreign economy’s 
bond yields, which transmits to higher EM borrowing costs of a similar magnitude (i.e., about 100 
bps) and persistence. In addition, the shocks trigger a risk-off period, modeled as a further rise in 
Indonesia’s UIP premium, as investors retrench from EM exposures amidst policy shocks and higher 
policy uncertainty. While the expansionary foreign fiscal policy, along with depreciation pressures on 
the Rupiah, boosts net exports, core inflation also rises above the central banks’ target. Several 
policy options are considered (Figure 5). 


INDONESIA 
INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND 109 
• 
Monetary policy only. The central bank raises the policy rate by about 1.8 percent, which keeps 
the peak in inflation at about 0.5 percent. Even with the monetary policy tightening, the 
cumulative impact of the external shocks lead to an abrupt 8 percent decline in the real 
exchange rate, which then gradually recovers. Domestic demand falls below trend by about 
1 percent at its trough due to tighter credit conditions. However, the fall of output below trend 
is marginal, as higher net exports—reflecting higher foreign demand and further facilitated by 
the exchange rate depreciation—largely offsets the decline in domestic demand.  
• 
Monetary policy and fiscal stimulus. In addition to tightening monetary policy to tackle inflation, 
the authorities use fiscal stimulus in the form of targeted transfers over eight quarters to 
households. The fiscal intervention has a cumulative cost of about 0.5 percent of GDP. The boost 
to domestic demand reduces the deviation of output from trend during the period of 
intervention, without significantly changing the dynamics of inflation or trade.  
• 
Monetary policy and FXI. The central bank uses FXI—about 2 percent of GDP—to reduce the 
excessive rise in UIP premium, which also reduces the exchange rate depreciation. The 
associated reduction in inflationary pressures allows the central bank to achieve a similar path 
for core inflation with less monetary policy tightening. Output actually rises above trend, as 
lower borrowing costs (and a less depreciated exchange rate) helps to significantly reduce the 
decline in domestic demand. There is an overall pivot away from external demand relative to the 
other two options, with net exports of both commodities and non-commodities declining.  
• 
The third option—using FXI in the face of large non-fundamental and speculative shocks 
alongside monetary policy, appear to achieve internal and external balance most prudently. 
Adding fiscal stimulus to the mix would only marginally improve upon the moderate domestic 
demand shortfall achieved with the combined FXI and monetary policy tightening. It may 
instead be prudent to preserve fiscal buffers. At the same time, the use of FXI will need to be 
judicious: a fundamental rise in borrowing costs should be accommodated through exchange 
rate flexibility, for example if the rising costs reflect a persistent shift in major economies’ 
financing needs.  
Concluding Remarks 
13.      Policymakers will need act under substantial uncertainty and keep future needs in 
mind. In practice, policymakers are likely to face real-time uncertainty distinguishing between the 
real and financial shocks, particularly as such shocks are often correlated. In addition, the duration of 
a shock will likely only be revealed over time. As such, policymakers may need to intervene before a 
comprehensive assessment of the nature of the shock is feasible. However, interventions should be 
temporary and targeted to short-term distortions to prices and quantities that may emerge in the 
context of shallow markets, and will need to keep in mind the available reserves, the cost of 
rebuilding reserves, and the need to maintain sufficient buffers against future shocks.

Annex XI. Trade Policy 
1.      
Indonesia has a trade policy regime characterized by moderate import tariffs. Its 
average Most-Favored Nation tariffs amount to 8 percent in 2022 (WTO data). Duties on 
international trade accounted for around 3 percent of total tax revenue in 2020 according to the 
WTO Trade Policy Review (2.6 percent from import tariffs, 0.4 percent from export duties). Tariffs are, 
however, relatively high compared to regional peers. 
2.      
Indonesia has relatively high non-tariff measures (NTMs) on trade, and trade on 
services is highly restricted. This includes export restrictions on minerals and local content 
requirements linked to import tariff exemptions, 
domestic tax reductions, market access and 
government procurement. In aggregate, 
Indonesia’s NTMs are above global average 
(see MATR database, Estefania-Flores et al., 
2022), whilst Services Trade Restrictiveness is 
among the highest within countries. 
3.      
Strengthening Indonesia’s economic 
openness would be key to boosting 
Indonesia’s attractiveness. In particular, this 
would support attracting investment and FDI. 
This calls for gradually phasing out restrictive 
trade policies, including to support the objective of increasing business certainty and improving 
Indonesia’s attractiveness to foreign investors. Historical evidence suggests that countries that 
experienced episodes of strong and sustained growth also witnessed an increase in economic 
openness.

Use of data and/or estimates different from official statistics in the Article IV consultation. For nominal and real effective exchange rate (NEER and REER) 
data staff uses Fund calculated data instead of authorities' as the methodology used is consistent for all member countries.
Other data gaps. Labor data frequency and timeliness could be strengthened. While the granularity of the data is sufficient, the data is published only twice a 
year. Quarterly or monthly data would allow for an enhanced monitoring of economic conditions (including the output gap) as well as of the impact of structural 
reforms and long-term scarring of the pandemic across industries. 
Changes since the last Article IV consultation. The inflation expectation survey has been resumed, but remains for internal use of Bank Indonesia. CPI has been 
rebased to 2022=100, and was first released in early February 2024.
Corrective actions and capacity development priorities. Authorities are working on improving the quality of their statistics, including, for example, to reduce 
the gap between National Accounts and BoP data, as well as on strengthening the fiscal accounts (GFS). Further work could expand on their efforts on external 
sector statistics.
The data provided to the Fund has some shortcomings that somewhat hamper surveillance.
The data provided to the Fund has serious shortcomings that significantly hamper surveillance.
Rationale for staff assessment. Data provision is broadly adequate for surveillance. However, some shortcomings remain on the areas of national accounts, 
external and fiscal statistics. Staff assessment reflects the absence of a breakdown of investment data in national accounts between public and private. It also 
reflects the absence of seasonally adjusted quarterly national accounts, the need for an updated base year (currently 2010) and the remaining (albeit declining) 
inconsistencies between the national accounts and BOP trade data. There is also a presence of small negative net errors and omissions in BOP (averaging -0.1 
percnet of GDP in the last 5 years) that suggests a possible under-coverage in the amount of imports in the current account, or the accumulation of assets in the 
financial account. 
Note: When the questionnaire does not include a question on a specific dimension of data quality for a sector, the corresponding cell is blank.
1/ The overall data adequacy assessment is based on staff's assessment of the adequacy of the country’s data for conducting analysis and formulating policy advice, and takes into consideration country-

Statement by Ms. Yati Kurniati, Executive Director for Indonesia, 
Mr. Irfan Hendrayadi, Senior Advisor to Executive Director  
July 22, 2024 
On behalf of the Indonesian authorities, we extend our sincere appreciation to the staff for the productive policy 
discussions during the Article IV and FSAP missions. The assessments and recommendations presented in the 
reports offer invaluable insights. The authorities deeply value the engagement with cross-agency representatives 
and look forward to further strengthening these collaborations going forward. 
Outlook 
Recent economic performance has demonstrated resilience amid global uncertainties. The momentum of 
economic growth remained robust, staying above 5%, with an indication of improvement as reflected in the Q1 
2024 economic growth rate of 5.11% year-on-year, which is higher compared to 5.04% in Q4 2023. This growth 
was driven by robust household consumption, significantly benefiting from the general election and substantial 
investment in infrastructure projects. In the first half of 2024, exports have shown signs of improvement, albeit 
limited due to continued lower commodity prices. 
The BoP remained relatively strong, with a manageable current account deficit of 0.1% GDP in 2023 and 
0.6% of GDP in Q1 2024. In 2024, the trade balance continued in surplus, primarily due to non-oil and gas exports, 
which helped maintain external resilience. The capital and financial account experienced fluctuations due to global 
financial market uncertainties, resulting in periods of capital outflows in Q1 2024. However, recent developments 
indicate that the current account deficit will remain low, supported by a continuing trade balance surplus, with 
capital and financial transactions recording surpluses. BoP performance in 2024 is expected to remain healthy, 
underscored by a low and manageable current account deficit in the 0.1%-0.9% of GDP range, as well as a capital 
and financial account surplus. Foreign reserves remain well above the international adequacy standard. 
Inflation was maintained within the target range of 2.5%±1%, with the CPI inflation recorded at 2.51% year-
on-year in June 2024. This stability was achieved through effective monetary policy measures and coordination 
between Bank Indonesia (BI) and the government to manage inflationary pressures, particularly in volatile food 
prices, which has been in a downward trend from its peak of 10.3% in March 2024 to 5.96% in June 2024. Core 
inflation remained low at 1.90%, and administered prices inflation was contained at 1.68%. 
The authorities are more optimistic about growth compared to the staff's projections. They believe that a range 
of 4.7-5.5% in 2024 and 4.8-5.6% in 2025 is attainable, driven mainly by domestic demand. Solid growth in 
private consumption is expected in line with maintained public purchasing power and strong consumer confidence. 
Investment is projected to increase, particularly in building and non-building investment, given the ongoing 
government infrastructure projects and improving private investment. Improvement in exports is also expected in 
line with increasing global demand. Furthermore, they highlight the significant impact of digitalization and the 
increasing adoption of digital payments, which have driven economic activities and supported robust household 
consumption and investment. 
There is optimism that medium-term growth will rise to 6-7%, driven by economic transformation through 
ambitious structural reforms aimed at achieving the 2045 Golden Indonesia Vision. This includes comprehensive 
efforts to enhance human capital, continue developing infrastructure, and improve the business and investment 
climate. Ongoing national strategic projects are expected to drive productivity and economic growth. Notable 
achievements include the enactment of the Omnibus Law, which has streamlined regulations and improved the 
business climate. There is a strong commitment to continuous reform, with plans for further enhancements in tax 
administration, infrastructure development, digitalization, and better integration into global value chains. 
The authorities are confident that there is minimal downside risk from domestic policy actions, considering 
their consistent and strong track record in implementing a sound macroeconomic framework and maintaining 


2 
 
policy credibility. The new administration, which will take office in October 2024, is also committed to continuing 
structural reform agendas, ensuring the momentum towards sustainable economic growth and the realization of the 
2045 vision. The commitment to structural reforms has also been strengthened by the OECD Accession Roadmap 
that was received in May 2024. 
Fiscal Policy 
Indonesia's fiscal policy is characterized by prudence, discipline, and a conservative approach in achieving 
strong, sustainable, and inclusive growth. The authorities believe that strong adherence to fiscal rules, backed by 
Law 17/2003, will ensure continued fiscal discipline, which has contributed to the country’s macroeconomic 
stability and performance. Indonesia has been among the few countries whose fiscal position shows significant 
improvement in the aftermath of the pandemic. The fiscal deficit returned to below the 3% level in 2022, a year 
earlier than initially planned. The fiscal position in 2023 continued to strengthen, with a surplus in the primary 
balance and a much narrower fiscal deficit at 1.6% of GDP. In 2024, with continued moderation in commodity 
prices, the fiscal deficit may widen but remain within the statutory threshold. Fiscal policy has been focused not 
only on tackling cyclical challenges but also on addressing structural challenges. In the last decade, the government 
has prioritized developing infrastructure, investing in human capital, and continuing institutional reform to enhance 
long-term potential growth. 
Fiscal policy conservatism, prudent and effective financing strategies, as well as automatic adjustment 
mechanisms, have provided adequate fiscal space in response to recent uncertainties and adverse 
shocks without compromising fiscal sustainability. New spending priorities by the incoming government, such as 
the “Nutritious Meal for Kids” program, have also been accommodated in the 2025 Macroeconomic and Fiscal 
Framework document. The 2025 fiscal deficit target of 2.3%-2.8% of GDP, outlined in the document, has 
incorporated this new program. 
A range of tax measures has been implemented to broaden the tax base and enhance compliance. These 
measures are part of a broader strategy to increase fiscal space and support development spending. Boosting fiscal 
revenues is crucial for maintaining fiscal sustainability and accommodating development spending within the fiscal 
rule's guardrails. Efforts to enhance revenue administration include modernizing tax collection processes and 
improving taxpayer services. A comprehensive approach to tax reform, which includes both policy and 
administrative improvements, is expected to yield more substantial revenue gains. Continued fiscal reforms under 
the new administration are anticipated to further strengthen fiscal position. 
Monetary Policy 
BI's policy mix aims to maintain macroeconomic stability and support sustainable economic growth. This 
mix has proven effective in bringing inflation to its target range, maintaining Rupiah stability, ensuring financial 
system stability, and supporting economic recovery. BI will continue utilizing and calibrating the policy mix to 
respond to evolving economic conditions and global uncertainties, ensuring that the economy remains resilient and 
adaptive. The authorities intend to maintain a data-driven approach in monetary policy to safeguard stability. 
The exchange rate policy is geared towards ensuring Rupiah stability and economic resilience. The policy 
aims to stabilize the Rupiah according to its fundamental value, ensuring market mechanisms function effectively, 
especially during periods of pressure. This is supported by foreign reserves that are well above standard sufficiency 
and ARA metrics. BI believes their exchange rate policy provides sufficient flexibility to respond to external 
shocks and maintain economic stability. However, BI cautions against suggestions to increase exchange rate 
flexibility in the current high-volatility conditions, as it could destabilize the economy and undermine investor 
confidence in the country's economic fundamentals and prospects. This approach also aligns with the staff 
assessment regarding the use of Foreign Exchange Intervention (FXI) to address sharp and inefficient rises in 
market premia. Additionally, it aligns with the assessment related to the Integrated Policy Framework (IPF) 


3 
 
application, where policy options comprising interest rate policy, monetary operation, and FXI result in an overall 
output path that is more optimal, particularly under the conditions faced by Indonesia. 
BI strengthens the pro-market monetary operations strategy to enhance monetary policy effectiveness. BI 
also reinforces the interest rate structure of the Rupiah money market to maintain attractive yields and portfolio 
inflows, thereby bolstering Rupiah stability. These include the optimization of BI Rupiah Securities (SRBI), BI 
Forex Securities (SVBI), and BI Forex Sukuk (SUVBI) to support financial market deepening and attract capital 
inflow. Strengthening competitive government bond (SBN) term-repo and FX swap transaction strategies continue 
to be carried out to maintain adequate liquidity in the banking industry. BI views its existing framework as robust 
and effective in supporting financial market deepening and encouraging capital inflow, hence enhancing monetary 
policy effectiveness. 
The Financial System Omnibus Law (FSOL), launched in 2023, strengthens the central bank’s mandate, 
independence, and accountability. The FSOL provides adequate safeguards for BI's primary market purchases, 
limiting them to crisis conditions to ensure financial system stability. Implementing regulations will adhere to the 
principles of being targeted, temporary, and transparent to further ensure central bank independence. Regarding 
the unwinding of maturing bonds purchased during the pandemic, the authorities ensure that the process follows 
existing regulations and is conducted in a gradual and orderly manner to avoid market disruptions. 
The export repatriation policy improves upon previous regulations, emphasizing stronger implementation 
and enhanced incentives. The regulation is designed to address structural issues by ensuring earnings from natural 
resource exports are available within the banking system to support economic resilience and growth. In this 
regard, the authorities disagree with the classification of the export repatriation regulation as an outflow capital 
flow measure (CFM). This policy is sensible and well-targeted, applied in a limited manner, specifically to 30% of 
FX earnings net of FX obligations for natural export proceeds valued more than USD250,000, thus minimizing 
disruptions to exporters’ activities. The expansion of financial instruments and increased fiscal incentives make 
repatriating funds more attractive, contributing to the deepening of the domestic financial market. The measure 
will be periodically assessed and refined as needed to maximize its effectiveness. 
Financial Sector Policies 
Financial sector policies focus on maintaining stability, promoting financial inclusion, and supporting 
economic growth through various reforms and regulatory measures. The current policy mix, which includes 
robust regulatory frameworks, digital financial services, and targeted initiatives to enhance financial inclusion, 
aligns well with Indonesia's economic context and development goals. The authorities greatly value positive results 
from the FSAP assessment on BCP, FMI assessments, and systemic liquidity management frameworks, as well as 
the commendatory report on the payment system (BI-RTGS). The authorities have achieved significant 
advancements in strengthening the regulatory and supervisory framework of the banking sector. In addition, the 
authorities exhibit a strong adherence to FMI international principles. These achievements underscore the 
country’s commitment as a G20/FSB member to leading by example in complying with international standards. 
There is also a commitment to continuous improvement and adaptation of financial sector policies in line with 
international standards and FSOL to ensure long-term stability and growth while addressing emerging challenges 
and opportunities. 
Welcoming the FSAP’s comprehensive assessment, the authorities highlighted the resilience of the financial 
system and the strength of financial policy frameworks. Systemic risks are well-contained through ongoing 
monitoring of the banking sector and regular stress tests. Monthly reporting of financial positions, including NPLs, 
ensures asset quality is accurately accounted for. Banks also maintain high loan-loss provisions to mitigate 
potential cliff effects in credit risk as forbearance measures were removed in March 2024. The sovereign-bank 
nexus increased during the pandemic but has decreased post-pandemic due to revived credit growth. Furthermore, 
the performance of Non-Financial Corporations (NFCs) is improving as indicated in the FSAP assessment which 


4 
 
shows median debt-to-equity ratios have decreased from 40 in 2020 to 30 in 2022, median return on assets have 
increased from 2.5 in 2020 to 3.5 in 2022 and median interest coverage ratios have increased from 2 in 2020 to 4 
in 2022. Collaborative efforts between BI and the Financial Services Authority (OJK) to strengthen monitoring of 
cross-sectoral and cross-border exposures will ensure resilience as the financial system develops. 
The ultimate objective of macroprudential policy is to address financial system stability. FSOL clarified and 
strengthened BI’s macroprudential mandate, which focuses on a three-pronged strategy: maintaining financial 
resilience, managing balanced and sustainable intermediation, and supporting financial inclusion, tailored to 
Indonesia’s needs. Balanced intermediation uses macroprudential policies as countercyclical tools to address 
systemic risks, ensuring stable credit growth and mitigating economic shocks. Maintaining financial resilience 
addresses risks from interconnectedness and contagion within the financial system. Supporting financial inclusion 
diversifies economic participation and reduces concentration risks by broadening access to financial services for 
underserved populations. These interlinked strategies enhance overall financial stability. Resilient banks manage 
procyclical tendencies better, providing stable access to financial services, which supports financial inclusion. In 
turn, financial inclusion contributes to bank resilience by diversifying customer bases and funding sources, 
especially during economic downturns. These strategies are aligned with domestic financial landscape and the 
context of emerging markets. 
The macroprudential framework is in line with the concept of macroprudential policy to manage systemic 
risks in the financial sector as referred to by the IMF and other countries. The framework is developed based on 
potential systemic risks from the perspective of an emerging economy, incorporating the country’s crisis 
experiences and lessons learned from the pandemic, particularly on the macro-financial linkage. It remains relevant 
as the macroprudential policy framework should be designed to address growing systemic risks in the country and 
best suit its institutional arrangement, which could further evolve and vary across countries while maintaining the 
ultimate objective of safeguarding financial stability. Nevertheless, authorities agreed to strengthen their public 
communication regarding the priority of the three-pronged strategy of the macroprudential policy framework, 
ensuring clear communication and understanding among stakeholders. 
On crisis management, authorities acknowledged international best practices but emphasized that crisis 
management and resolution frameworks should also consider country-specific circumstances, crisis 
experiences, and legal regime differences. They now focus on strengthening the implementation of the FSOL to 
ensure credibility in policy development and governance in exercising authorities’ mandates. 
Significant strides have been made in ensuring the stability of the banking sector, reflected in robust capital 
and liquidity resilience and well-managed credit risks. The banking sector remains well-capitalized, with a 
CAR of 26.14% and gross NPLs at 2.34% in May 2024, demonstrating resilience to economic shocks and the 
ability to support the broader economy. Meanwhile, bank liquidity remains adequate, as reflected by a high ratio of 
liquid assets to third-party funds at 25.78% in May 2024. Financial inclusion has been another key focus, with 
policies aimed at expanding access to financial services for underserved populations. Initiatives such as the 
expansion of digital banking and electronic payment systems have significantly increased financial inclusion. As of 
May 2024, the value of digital banking transactions grew by 10.82% year-on-year, and electronic money 
transactions increased by 35.24%. The promotion of the Quick Response Code Indonesian Standard (QRIS) has 
seen impressive growth of 213.31%, further supporting financial inclusion and economic activity. 
Efforts to improve the regulatory framework for NBFIs and fintech firms continue. The authorities agree 
with staff on the importance of these sectors in promoting financial inclusion and innovation, but a balanced 
regulatory approach is necessary to foster growth while ensuring stability. Recent measures to enhance the 
supervision and regulation of NBFIs and fintech firms aim to achieve this balance, promoting innovation while 
safeguarding the financial system. 


5 
 
Authorities have put in place a financial sector masterplan and roadmaps that emphasize the gradual 
approach to reform the financial sector. They believe the current pace of financial sector reforms is considered 
appropriate and aligns with the domestic macro-financial conditions given the need to balance stability with 
growth. Financial sector reforms implemented so far, including strengthening macroprudential regulations and 
promoting digital financial services, have already provided a solid foundation for stability and growth. The growth 
measures are designed to bolster resilience rather than conflict with the objective of financial stability. 
Consequently, a continued gradual approach to additional reforms will allow for a stable transition and avoid 
potential disruptions to the financial system. This preference also applies to recommendations for further 
consolidation in the banking sector. Furthermore, they aim to enhance the regulatory framework and promote good 
corporate governance and sound risk management practices across all banks. 
On financial integrity, Indonesia became a FATF member in October 2023. The FATF Task Force found that 
the legal framework is strong. The authorities are working to further enhance its effectiveness based on the mutual 
evaluation report and have established an action plan. 
Structural Reforms 
To accomplish the 2045 Golden Indonesia Vision, transformational reforms are being implemented to 
enhance social protection, improve productivity, and foster new sources of growth. The first stage of the long-
term development plan targets strengthening the foundations for an inclusive and sustainable economy. This 
includes improving the quality of education, health, social protection, and infrastructure. Key measures involve 
extending compulsory education, broadening secondary education delivery, implementing nutrition programs to 
reduce stunting, making new capital investments, developing new sea and air hubs, and bolstering digital and 
energy transition infrastructure. Governance transformation, including regulatory framework enhancement and 
business climate improvement, is also a priority. 
Efforts to streamline regulations and enhance the business climate through the Omnibus Law have reduced 
regulatory barriers, improved the investment environment, and boosted economic competitiveness. Key 
milestones include the Omnibus Law on Job Creation, the Harmonized Tax Regulations Law, the 
Intergovernmental Fiscal Transfer Law, and the FSOL. These integrated reforms aim to build stronger economic 
fundamentals and enhance long-term growth potential. Implementing the Job Creation Law, which expedites 
business licensing, accelerates National Strategic Projects, and applies risk-based business analysis to encourage 
FDI, will enhance economic capacity through increased efficiency and productivity. The positive impact of 
structural reforms is reflected in the country's improved ranking in the 2024 IMD World Competitiveness Ranking 
which demonstrates significant strides in economic performance, government efficiency, and business 
productivity. This improvement highlights the effectiveness of the ongoing policy measures and the commitment 
to enhancing the overall business environment, which has been instrumental in attracting foreign investments and 
boosting the nation's competitive edge on a global scale. The FSOL is a crucial step in establishing a deep, 
innovative, efficient, inclusive, trusted, and stable financial sector. 
A well-targeted Industrial Policy (IP), aimed at boosting participation in the global value chains (GVCs) has 
given positive results. IP is viewed as essential for maximizing the country's rich natural resources, not only for 
the current generation but also for future generations. This policy is also crucial for increasing value addition in the 
economy and attracting investment flows, especially amidst geopolitical fragmentation and market distortions. 
Ultimately, this policy will improve the balance of payments structure, strengthen the external position, and create 
a more resilient economy, calibrated over time according to market dynamics while prioritizing the benefits for 
achieving the national vision. 
Indonesia has committed to achieving Net-Zero Emission by 2060 or sooner, as incorporated in the National 
Long-Term Development Plan for 2024-2025. In coordination with international partners, the 2024 Climate 
Investment and Policy Plan (CIPP) is planned to be released, showcasing different transition pathways for the off-


6 
 
grid power plant network by the end of 2024. The overall green transition strategy focuses on sustainable energy 
development, green industry, sustainable land restoration, waste management, and coastal and marine environment 
preservation. Ongoing discussions include the potential implementation of a carbon tax, expanding the emission 
trading system and carbon exchange market, using local content requirements for renewables, and enhancing the 
targeting of energy subsidies, with these measures expected to be addressed by the incoming administration 
starting end-2024.
