- B: The dataset in DAIR-V2X is measured data and takes into account the time asynchrony caused by communication, while the dataset in V2X-Sim does not take this into account.
- C: Neither the DAIR-V2X nor the V2X-Sim datasets consider the problem of posture errors.
- D: DAIR-V2X is the first measured dataset that includes both V2V and V2Iã€‚
