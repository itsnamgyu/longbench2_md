# Question

Which of the following statements is incorrect?

# Choices

- A: Both papers(Learning to Communicate and Correct Pose Errors&Keypoints-Based Deep Feature Fusion for Cooperative Vehicle Detection of Autonomous Driving) compress the sent feature maps.
- B: The positioning and orientation errors added in the experiments in both papers(Learning to Communicate and Correct Pose Errors&Keypoints-Based Deep Feature Fusion for Cooperative Vehicle Detection of Autonomous Driving)  follow a normal distribution.
- C: FPV-RCNN calibrates positioning and orientation errors by aligning objects in the environment, while the other paper (Learning to Communicate and Correct Pose Errors) improves target detection through error prediction, consistency module, and attention mechanism.
- D: Both papers (Learning to Communicate and Correct Pose Errors&Keypoints-Based Deep Feature Fusion for Cooperative Vehicle Detection of Autonomous Driving)propose a new method to solve the pose error problem and alleviate the pressure on communication bandwidth.

# Answer

D
