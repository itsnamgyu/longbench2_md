SPECIAL ORDERS 
SPECIAL ORDER 
SPEECHES 
The Speaker’s policy with regard to special-order speeches announced on February 11, 
1994, as clarified and reiterated by subsequent Speakers, will continue to apply 
in the 118th Congress. 
The Chair may recognize Members for special-order speeches for up to 4 hours. 
Such speeches may not extend beyond the 4-hour limit without the permission of 
the Chair, which may be granted only with advance consultation between the leader-
ships and notification to the House. However, the Chair will not recognize for any 
special-order speeches beyond 10 o’clock in the evening. 
The 4-hour limitation will be divided between the majority and minority parties. 
Each party is entitled to reserve its first hour for respective leaderships or their 
designees. The second hour reserved to each party will be divided into two 30- 
minute periods. Recognition for one-hour periods and for 30-minute periods will alter-
nate initially and subsequently between the parties each day. The Chair wishes 
to clarify for Members that any 60- or 30-minute period that is not claimed at 
the appropriate time will be considered to have expired; this includes the first 60- 
minute period of the day. 
The allocation of time within each party’s 2-hour period (or shorter period if prorated 
to end by 10 p.m.) will be determined by a list submitted to the Chair by the 
respective leaderships. Members may not sign up with their leadership for any spe-
cial-order speeches earlier than one week prior to the special order. Additionally, 
Members must sign up with their leadership for any special-order speech at least 
one day prior to the special order. The Chair will not recognize a Member for more 
than one special-order speech per week, nor may a Member sign up for a second 
special-order speech in the same week. Additional guidelines may be established 
for such sign-ups by the respective leaderships. 
Pursuant to clause 2(a) of rule V, the television cameras will not pan the Chamber, 
but a ‘‘crawl’’ indicating the conduct of morning-hour debate or that the House has 
completed its legislative business and is proceeding with special-order speeches will 
appear on the screen. The Chair may announce other adaptations during this period. 
The continuation of this format for recognition by the Speaker is without prejudice 
to the Speaker’s ultimate power of recognition under clause 2 of rule XVII and 
includes the ability to withdraw recognition for longer special-order speeches should 
circumstances warrant.

Rule XV, clause 5:
‘‘5. (a) On the first Tuesday of a month, the Speaker shall direct the Clerk to call the bills and resolutions
on the Private Calendar after disposal of such business on the Speaker’s table as requires reference only. If
two or more Members, Delegates, or the Resident Commissioner object to the consideration of a bill or
resolution so called, it shall be recommitted to the committee that reported it. No other business shall be in
order before completion of the call of the Private Calendar on this day unless two-thirds of the Members
voting, a quorum being present, agree to a motion that the House dispense with the call.
‘‘(b)(1) On any day, after the disposal of such business on the Speaker’s table as requires reference only,
the Speaker may direct the Clerk to call any bill or resolution that has been on the Private Calendar for at
least seven days, but only on the second legislative day after the legislative day on which the Speaker or a
designee announces to the House an intention to do so. Preference shall be given to omnibus bills containing
the texts of bills or resolutions that have previously been objected to on a call of the Private Calendar. If two
or more Members, Delegates, or the Resident Commissioner object to the consideration of a bill or resolution
so called (other than an omnibus bill), it shall be recommitted to the committee that reported it. Two-thirds of
the Members voting, a quorum being present, may adopt a motion that the House dispense with the call on
this day.
‘‘(2) Omnibus bills shall be read for amendment by paragraph. No amendment shall be in order except to
strike or to reduce amounts of money or to provide limitations. An item or matter stricken from an omnibus
bill may not thereafter during the same session of Congress be included in an omnibus bill. Upon passage
such an omnibus bill shall be resolved into the several bills and resolutions of which it is composed. The
several bills and resolutions, with any amendments adopted by the House, shall be engrossed, when necessary,
and otherwise considered as passed severally by the House as distinct bills and resolutions.
‘‘(c) The Speaker may not entertain a reservation of the right to object to the consideration of a bill or
resolution under this clause. A bill or resolution considered under this clause shall be considered in the House
as in the Committee of the Whole. A motion to dispense with the call of the Private Calendar under this

‘‘(a)(1) A Member may present to the Clerk a motion in writing to discharge—
‘‘(A) a committee from consideration of a public bill or public resolution that has been referred to it for 30
legislative days; or
‘‘(B) the Committee on Rules from consideration of a resolution that has been referred to it for seven
legislative days and that proposes a special order of business for the consideration of a public bill or public
resolution that has been reported by a committee or has been referred to a committee for 30 legislative days. 
‘‘(2) Only one motion may be presented for a bill or resolution. A Member may not file a motion to
discharge the Committee on Rules from consideration of a resolution providing for the consideration of more
than one public bill or public resolution or admitting or effecting a nongermane amendment to a public bill or
public resolution. 
‘‘(b) A motion presented under paragraph (a) shall be placed in the custody of the Clerk, who shall arrange
a convenient place for the signatures of Members. A signature may be withdrawn by a Member in writing at
any time before a motion is entered on the Journal. The Clerk shall make the signatories a matter of public
record, causing the names of the Members who have signed a discharge motion during a week to be published
in a portion of the Congressional Record designated for that purpose on the last legislative day of the week
and making cumulative lists of such names available each day for public inspection in an appropriate office of
the House. The Clerk shall devise a means for making such lists available to offices of the House and to the
public in electronic form. When a majority of the total membership of the House shall have signed the motion,
it shall be entered on the Journal, published with the signatories thereto in the Record, and referred to the
Calendar of Motions to Discharge Committees. 
‘‘(c)(1) A motion to discharge that has been on the calendar for at least seven legislative days (except
during the last six days of a session of Congress) shall be privileged only at a time or place, designated by the
Speaker, in the legislative schedule within two legislative days after the day on which a Member whose
signature appears thereon announces to the House an intention to offer the motion. When such a motion is
called up, the House shall proceed to its consideration under this paragraph without intervening motion except
one motion to adjourn. Privileged motions to discharge shall have precedence in the order of their entry on the
Journal.
‘‘(2) When a motion to discharge is called up, the bill or resolution to which it relates shall be read by title
only. The motion is debatable for 20 minutes, one-half in favor of the motion and one-half in opposition
thereto. 
‘‘(d)(1) If a motion prevails to discharge the Committee on Rules from consideration of a resolution, the
House shall immediately consider the resolution, pending which the Speaker may entertain one motion that
the House adjourn but may not entertain any other dilatory motion until the resolution has been disposed of.
If the resolution is adopted, the House shall immediately proceed to its execution.
‘‘(2) If a motion prevails to discharge a committee from consideration of a public bill or public resolution, a
motion that the House proceed to the immediate consideration of such bill or resolution shall be privileged if
offered by a Member whose signature appeared on the motion to discharge. The motion to proceed is not
debatable. If the motion to proceed is adopted, the bill or resolution shall be considered immediately under the
general rules of the House. If unfinished before adjournment of the day on which it is called up, the bill or
resolution shall remain the unfinished business until it is disposed of. If the motion to proceed is rejected, the
bill or resolution shall be referred to the appropriate calendar, where it shall have the same status as if the
committee from which it was discharged had duly reported it to the House.
‘‘(e)(1) When a motion to discharge originated under this clause has once been acted on by the House, it
shall not be in order to entertain during the same session of Congress—
‘‘(A) a motion to discharge a committee from consideration of that bill or resolution or of any other bill or
resolution that, by relating in substance to or dealing with the same subject matter, is substantially the same;
or 
‘‘(B) a motion to discharge the Committee on Rules from consideration of a resolution providing a special
order of business for the consideration of that bill or resolution or of any other bill or resolution that, by
relating in substance to or dealing with the same subject matter, is substantially the same.

SPECIAL ORDERS 
HOUR OF 
MEETING 
On motion of Mr. LaMalfa, by unanimous consent, Ordered, That when the House ad-
journs Wednesday, Sept. 11, 2024, it adjourn to meet at 9 a.m. on Thursday, Sept. 
12, 2024. (Agreed to Sept. 11, 2024.) 
SPECIAL ORDER 
SPEECHES 
The Speaker’s policy with regard to special-order speeches announced on February 11, 
1994, as clarified and reiterated by subsequent Speakers, will continue to apply 
in the 118th Congress. 
The Chair may recognize Members for special-order speeches for up to 4 hours. 
Such speeches may not extend beyond the 4-hour limit without the permission of 
the Chair, which may be granted only with advance consultation between the leader-
ships and notification to the House. However, the Chair will not recognize for any 
special-order speeches beyond 10 o’clock in the evening. 
The 4-hour limitation will be divided between the majority and minority parties. 
Each party is entitled to reserve its first hour for respective leaderships or their 
designees. The second hour reserved to each party will be divided into two 30- 
minute periods. Recognition for one-hour periods and for 30-minute periods will alter-
nate initially and subsequently between the parties each day. The Chair wishes 
to clarify for Members that any 60- or 30-minute period that is not claimed at 
the appropriate time will be considered to have expired; this includes the first 60- 
minute period of the day. 
The allocation of time within each party’s 2-hour period (or shorter period if prorated 
to end by 10 p.m.) will be determined by a list submitted to the Chair by the 
respective leaderships. Members may not sign up with their leadership for any spe-
cial-order speeches earlier than one week prior to the special order. Additionally, 
Members must sign up with their leadership for any special-order speech at least 
one day prior to the special order. The Chair will not recognize a Member for more 
than one special-order speech per week, nor may a Member sign up for a second 
special-order speech in the same week. Additional guidelines may be established 
for such sign-ups by the respective leaderships. 
Pursuant to clause 2(a) of rule V, the television cameras will not pan the Chamber, 
but a ‘‘crawl’’ indicating the conduct of morning-hour debate or that the House has 
completed its legislative business and is proceeding with special-order speeches will 
appear on the screen. The Chair may announce other adaptations during this period. 
The continuation of this format for recognition by the Speaker is without prejudice 
to the Speaker’s ultimate power of recognition under clause 2 of rule XVII and 
includes the ability to withdraw recognition for longer special-order speeches should 
circumstances warrant. 
MORNING HOUR 
DEBATE 
That during the second session of the 118th Congress: (1) on legislative days of Monday 
or Tuesday when the House convenes pursuant to House Resolution 950, the House 
shall convene 2 hours earlier than the time otherwise established by the resolution 
for the purpose of conducting morning-hour debate; (2) on legislative days of Wednes-
day or Thursday when the House convenes pursuant to House Resolution 950, the 
House shall convene 2 hours earlier than the time otherwise established by the 
resolution for the purpose of conducting morning-hour debate; (3) when the House 
convenes pursuant to an order other than House Resolution 950, the House shall 
convene for the purpose of conducting morning-hour debate only as prescribed by 
such order; (4) the time for morning-hour debate shall be allocated equally between 
the parties and may not continue beyond 10 minutes before the hour appointed 
for the resumption of the session of the House; and (5) the form of proceeding 
for morning-hour debate shall be as follows: (a) the prayer by the Chaplain, the 
approval of the Journal and the Pledge of Allegiance to the flag shall be postponed 
until resumption of the session of the House; (b) initial and subsequent recognitions 
for debate shall alternate between the parties; (c) recognition shall be conferred 
by the Speaker only pursuant to lists submitted by the Majority Leader and by 
the Minority Leader; (d) no Member may address the House for longer than 5 min-
utes, except the Majority Leader, the Minority Leader, or the minority whip; (e) 
no legislative business shall be in order except the filing of privileged reports; and 
(f) following morning-hour debate, the Chair shall declare a recess pursuant to clause 
12(a) of rule I until the time appointed for the resumption of the session of the 
House; and (6) the Speaker may dispense with morning-hour debate upon receipt 
of a notification described in clause 12(c) of rule I, or upon a change in reconvening 
pursuant to clause 12(e) of rule I, and notify Members accordingly. (Agreed to Jan. 
9, 2024.) 
DAILY HOURS OF 
MEETING 
Pursuant to the provisions of H. Res. 950, and unless otherwise ordered, the hour of 
daily meeting of the House shall be 2 p.m. on Mondays; noon on Tuesdays (or
