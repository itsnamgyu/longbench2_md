ROADMAP TOWARDS ZERO 
SINGLE-USE PLASTICS 
2018-2030
INTRODUCTION 
Since the 1950s, the production of plastic has outpaced 
that of almost every other material due to its versatility and 
functionality. Most of these plastics are designed to be thrown 
away after being used only once (single-use) which results in 
single-use disposable plastics waste accumulation. Only nine 
per cent of the nine billion tonnes of plastic the world has 
ever produced has been recycled. Most ends up in landfills, 
dumps or in the open environment1. Single-use plastics2 are 
plastics that are commonly used for plastic packaging, carry 
bags and include items intended to be used only once before 
they are thrown away.
Malaysia is a global player in the plastic industry with currently 
about 1,300 plastic manufacturers. As of 2016, our exports 
amounted to RM30 billion which saw a 2.26 million metric 
tonnes of resin utilised to produce plastics. 
Environmental problems related to plastic waste have become a major problem in Malaysia where it has been 
ranked as 8th among the top ten countries with mismanaged plastic waste in the world. A study estimated 
that Malaysia had produced 0.94 million tons of mismanaged plastic wastes, of which 0.14 to 0.37 million tons 
may have been washed into the oceans3. 
Some studies have also highlighted the potential health effects of single-use plastics on human and animals. 
Besides that, the Asia Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) had estimated USD13 billion impact of marine 
plastic pollution to the Asia Pacific region4. 
More than 60 countries have introduced some measures to curb single-use plastics waste such as imposing 
bans and levies. Some countries have imposed direct ban on single-use plastics but according to a UNEP1 
report, the bans have not been effective to curtail plastic pollution. The report also highlights other countries 
have taken a phased approach and in some cases, complimented with economic instruments. For example, 
India is planning to phase-out single-use plastics by 2022. Taiwan and European Union plan to phase-out 
single-use plastics by 2030.
Plastic pollution is a global problem that needs to be addressed in a sustainable manner. Malaysia has always 
promoted sustainable development by balancing economic growth with environmental protection in line 
with the United Nation’s Sustainable Development Goals. Malaysia plans to address single-use plastics by 
encouraging the plastic industry to transition to eco-friendly products. This will ensure the industry thrives by 
adapting green technologies while the environment is safeguarded. As such, this Roadmap is prepared to be 
used as a guide towards zero single-use plastics in Malaysia in a holistic manner.

The vision of this Roadmap is to take a phased, evidence-based and holistic approach by involving all stakeholders 
in jointly addressing single-use plastics pollution in Malaysia. This Roadmap is envisaged to deploy actions that 
can deflect the current trajectory to a more sustainable pathway towards a cleaner and healthier environment 
by 2030. 
The Roadmap will be implemented from 2018 leading up to 2030 with an expectation that all relevant 
stakeholders will play their roles effectively to ensure the objectives of this roadmap are met.

Shared Responsibility
The responsibility to eliminate single-use plastics waste from the natural environment 
has to be shared by all the stakeholders including the government, industries, civil society 
and the consumers.
Sustainable Development 
This Roadmap will support the wider national agenda on sustainable development that 
includes the consideration of economic, technology, environment, development and 
social factors.
Precautionary Principle
Plastics, as reported have an impact on biodiversity, environment and human health and 
some of these impacts are still being studied. When an activity raises threats or harm 
to human health or the environment, precautionary measures should be taken even if 
some cause and effect relationships are not fully established scientifically.
Participatory
Planning and execution of the Roadmap will be carried out by engaging all the relevant 
stakeholders in an open and transparent manner.
Good Governance
Good governance with appropriate mechanisms including accountability and transparency 
is crucial for the implementation of the Roadmap.
THE PRINCIPLES

Living Document
This Roadmap will be updated from time to time taking into account advances in technology 
and real-time circumstances in accordance with national priorities. 


THE NEED FOR THIS ROADMAP 
At present, there is no uniform approach in Malaysia to address single-use plastics. This Roadmap aims to 
provide a policy direction to all stakeholders including State Governments in taking a unified and collective 
approach. While Malaysia continues to strive to be a fully developed nation, the economic advances should be 
balanced with the environmental protection to ensure sustainability and societal wellbeing.
This Roadmap will provide opportunities for the local industries to embrace new eco-friendly alternatives 
that could facilitate penetration to a wider global market as the world move towards adapting products and 
processes that can address plastic pollution.
The effectiveness of this roadmap will require a structured and coordinated effort from all players in the plastic 
value-chain working in a concerted effort to address single-use plastics pollution.

Lack of Awareness
The problem of plastic waste in Malaysia is driven by the habit of littering and 
unsustainable consumption habits. The implementation of this Roadmap will be 
complemented by an effective and target-based CEPA program. 
Low Recycling Rate
The recycling industry in Malaysia focuses on materials that can be easily collected 
and has high value. Due to this factor, only waste materials like transparent PET 
bottles are being recycled in mass volume. Other waste materials (i.e. food packaging, 
polystyrene products and straws) that do not have recycling value are almost never 
recycled due to lack of technology or business viability. Besides that, the local recyclers 
are challenged to ensure the sustainability and quality of raw materials.
Biodegradability and Cost of Current Alternative to Plastics
The current biodegradable alternatives are higher in price than plastics. This factor 
does not encourage businesses to embrace alternative products. This is further 
augmented with arguments and challenges on the biodegradability of alternatives. 
In this regard, the approach taken by this Roadmap to introduce bio bags in Phase 
II is to provide time for evidence-based studies and R&D on alternative products. 
Enforcement 
This Roadmap needs the cooperation of all stakeholders for its successful 
implementation. Nevertheless there may be situations where certain parties default 
the action calls of this Roadmap. Given the ubiquitous nature of single-use plastics and 
its huge usage, enforcement especially at local levels would pose some challenges. 
This can be mitigated through citizen action which will be nurtured by the CEPA 
program that will be deployed under this Roadmap.
Integrated Waste Management 
This Roadmap would need to be complimented by an integrated waste management 
approach such as organic waste composting facilities to ensure proper end-of-life 
treatment of some biodegradable alternatives. This integrated approach could act 
as a catalyst for waste to wealth interventions by creating downstream industries 
such as fertiliser, energy, and the animal feed industry.

FOREWORD


Foreword | 3 
PRIME MINISTER OF MALAYSIA
Green growth for a greener Malaysia
As Malaysia transforms into a high-income nation, the national 
development strategy must be in line with the megatrends of the 
world, especially climate change. As a signatory nation to the 
Conference of Parties (COP) to the United Nations Framework 
Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC), Malaysia has pledged 
to reduce its Greenhouse Gas (GHG) emission intensity of Gross 
Domestic Product (GDP) by up to 45% by 2030 relative to 2005 
levels. This consists of 35% on an unconditional basis and a further 10% is conditional 
upon receipt of climate finance, technology transfer and capacity building from developed 
countries.
The Green Technology Master Plan outlines the strategic plans for green technology 
development to create a low-carbon and resource efficient economy. This document sets 
out the immediate course for the country to embark on a green growth journey. It lays the 
foundation for the cultivation of mindset and behavioural change, to inculcate green lifestyle 
among the rakyat. This Master Plan is essential to facilitate the Transformasi Nasional 
2050, or TN50 which is an initiative to position Malaysia amongst the top countries in the 
world in economic development, citizen well-being and innovation by the year 2050.
Since independence, the Government had introduced various initiatives to plant the seed of 
sustainability in key economic sectors to mitigate the negative impact to the environment. 
Since the past five years, we have seen positive outcomes from some of the initiatives 
undertaken such as increased renewable mix in power generation, market penetration of 
resource efficient products, improvement in public modal share, better waste and water 
management. Moving forward, the Green Technology Master Plan will be the key reference 
outlining the focus of green technology development in Malaysia. This document anchors 
on outcome-approach to deliver high socio-economic and environmental impact.
The success of the Green Technology Master Plan draws upon effective cross-sectoral 
collaboration across various sectors to maximise its potential benefits. The conventional 
way of driving the green growth agenda shall be replaced by dynamic inter-ministerial 
cooperation, supported by active involvement of the private sector. Green growth is a 
shared agenda which belongs to every Malaysian, which shall benefit not only our 
generation, but more importantly, the many future generations to come.
Dato’ Sri Mohd Najib bin Tun Haji Abdul Razak

MINISTER OF ENERGY, GREEN TECHNOLOGY AND WATER 
Green Technology – The Preamble for Green Growth
Malaysia is blessed with abundant resources. The rapid development 
of the country since independence was mainly supported by the 
use of natural resources. Over the past six decades, Malaysia has 
evolved from a primary economy dependent on mining, rubber and 
oil palm plantation, to manufacturing-based secondary economy, 
morphing into a service-based tertiary economy. Natural resources 
have served the nation well as the growth engine. For the benefits 
of the existing, as well as the future generations, it is crucial for the country to embark on 
green growth.
To support this development strategy, green technology has been identified to catalyse 
sustainable economic growth. Green technology is cross-sectoral in nature, which presents 
a solution in balancing the needs for economic development and our responsibility 
towards the environment. The production and development of green technology offer 
the opportunity to stimulate economic activities in various sectors, creating jobs and 
attracting investment. Green technology also offers the capability of mitigating negative 
environmental impact resulting from economic activities. There is a growing global need 
to deal with dangers of climate change, in part through the implementation of green 
technology. Green technology application provides the solution to realise the country’s 
commitment to the world.
It is anticipated that by 2030, green businesses will contribute approximately 1.5% to the 
nation’s Gross Domestic Product (GDP) or equivalent to RM60 billion from RM7.9 billion 
in 2013. This projection is supported by Government’s commitment towards realising 
the green targets, proper execution of policies and monitoring mechanism to keep track 
of green business performance, increase of exports as well as cooperation from private 
sectors. This will also contribute to RM94.3 billion of total investment in green technology. 
Apart from that, the top 30 public listed companies which contributed about 15% of the 
national GDP had also committed to sustainability practice in their business operations.
The Green Technology Master Plan outlines the targets of respective key focus areas of 
green technology applications which can potentially generate the most observable socio-
economic and environmental impact. We hope this document is able to provide clearer 
picture on the Government’s commitment in creating conducive ecosystem for green 
technology development, shifting from technology adoption to technology production.
Datuk Seri Panglima Dr Maximus Johnity Ongkili


Foreword | 5 
SECRETARY GENERAL 
Ministry of Energy, Green Technology and Water
The Green Technology Master Plan provides actionable strategic 
directions to support the National Green Technology Policy. 
This document is the first of its kind which outlines the national 
concerted efforts in promoting green technology in key economic 
sectors to stimulate economic growth in the country. It aligns the 
existing green technology-related policies and action plans with the 
strategic direction of the 11th Malaysia Plan.
This Master Plan aims to provide the readers an overview of the Government's commitments 
in facilitating the development of green technology in the country. It sets out key focus 
areas where business opportunities could be further explored. The document is informative 
in nature. It provides the readers the general sectoral profile of each of the key focus areas, 
achievement, targets, existing initiatives which the Government and/or private sector are 
undertaking, as well as upcoming initiatives where the relevant Government entities are 
committed to fulfil their roles.
The Green Technology Master Plan also serves as a guidance to foster inter-ministerial 
collaboration to address grey areas where overlapping authorities are observed. It identifies 
five strategic thrusts, in line with the National Green Technology Policy where Government's 
intervention is essential to drive changes in order to create conducive ecosystems for 
the development of green technology. It recognises the strengths and weaknesses in the 
existing system, and provides action points for the relevant Government entities and/or 
private sector to act on. Most importantly, it explicitly spells out the programme ownership 
of various initiatives to instil responsibilities among the relevant entities.
Last but not least, I wish to take this opportunity to thank all the stakeholders who have 
contributed their ideas to develop this Master Plan. Moving forward, I hope we can work 
together to make this Master Plan a success.
Dato’ Seri Ir. Dr. Zaini bin Ujang

EXECUTIVE
SUMMARY


Executive Summary | 7 
The Green Technology Master Plan (GTMP) is fundamentally an outcome of the Eleventh 
Malaysia Plan (2016-2020) which has earmarked green growth as one of six game 
changers altering the trajectory of the nation’s growth.  The GTMP creates a framework 
which facilitates the mainstreaming of green technology into the planned developments of 
Malaysia while encompassing the four pillars set in the National Green Technology Policy 
(NGTP) i.e. energy, environment, economy and social.
  
This first edition of the GTMP focuses on six key sectors, namely Energy, Manufacturing, 
Transportation, Building, Waste and Water and attempts to harmonise the policy directions 
of each sector towards a common goal of sustainable utilisation of natural resources. 
The green technology goals established for each of these sectors will be progressively 
realised and fine-tuned in the policies and actions developed in every 5-year National 
Development Plan period.   
Since 2009, several initiatives have shown that green technology could be instrumental 
in decoupling economic growth from natural capital depletion. This is reflected in the 
contribution to GDP made by the adoption and use of green technology based practices, 
systems and products, as shown in Figure A.

Strategic Direction
The successful implementation of the GTMP will require strategic directions that are 
practicable and achievable. The strategic directions considered in the GTMP encompass 
several aspects which will need to work in tandem.
The first strategic direction is for the Government to lead the way in adopting green 
procurement criteria and to review all aspects of its operations for opportunities to adopt 
green technology-based practices, systems and products. Because the Government is a 
major consumer segment, this strategic intervention will resonate throughout the markets 
and catalyse the change in production and consumption patterns. The reshaping of 
demand and supply towards sustainably sourced products and services can be further 
reinforced by strategic fiscal and financial instruments.
The second aspect to the strategic direction looks at mainstreaming green technology into 
markets through targeted programmes that encourage informed purchasing decisions 
based on heightened environmental consciousness. This can be achieved through smart 
partnerships involving the Government, the manufacturers, and the retailers. Such visible 
and transparent action will be helpful in boosting market confidence in green technology-
based products and services.
 
The third aspect looks at nurturing research, development and commercialisation (R&D&C), 
which will move Malaysia from adoption and adaptation of non-domestic technologies to 
creation of its own original intellectual property.  It is imperative for Malaysia to move 
quickly in this area to catch up with the rapid pace of technology innovation around the 
globe.  A consortium of R&D&C entities, industries and consumer groups will be formed to 
share resources and capabilities to synergise this endeavour.
 
Finally, progress on the master plan will rely heavily on human capital that is capable of 
the diligent pursuit of innovation and excellence, and this is reflected in the prominence of 
human capital development in each of the key sectors.
Key Points from Key Sectors
Key initiatives that are underway and planned, as well as challenges flagged in each of the 
six sectors are briefly outlined in the GTMP
.  Each sector has its own unique challenges but 
there are also common cross-cutting challenges from which strategic areas of intervention 
have been identified. 
The GTMP is cognisant of the fact there is a need to balance the different goals of each 
sector without diluting the effort towards green growth.  However, it has been deemed 
prudent to focus on the need for technology adaptation and adoption as an immediate 
outcome.  A summary of the key points describing the embedding of green technology in 
each sector is as follows.


Executive Summary | 9 
Energy Sector
Efforts have been put into place by the Government to ensure the long-term sustainability 
of the energy sector through resource diversification, continuous investment in new 
infrastructure and state-of-the-art technology deployment. The main challenge highlighted 
was governance in the future energy economy which will be important in setting the tone 
for harnessing renewable energies and energy storage technologies.
 
A series of initiatives has also been put into place addressing efficiency in electricity 
generation and consumption.  Funding to buffer the transition to a more market-based 
approach in energy generation and supply has been provided along with funds for R&D&C. 
Recommendations include enhancing the energy planning framework to leverage on 
disruptive technologies such as the massive scale-up of distributed generation, microgrids, 
independent energy storage, the internet of things, and electric vehicles among others.
  
The targets for the Energy sector are summarised below:
Manufacturing Sector 
Malaysia’s manufacturing sector is dominated by the small and medium-sized enterprises 
(SMEs), making up 95% of the sector, with the remaining 5% comprised of the large 
enterprises. Initiatives have been put into place to green the industry, with measures 
promoting energy efficiency and adoption of ‘greener’ manufacturing processes that 
reduce water and raw material consumption while minimising air pollution, solid waste 
and wastewater generation. Challenges highlighted were pegged on the fact that 
the manufacturing sector covers a diverse range of industrial segments, each with its 
own unique environmental issues and circumstances requiring tailored solutions. 
Recommendations include scaling up towards a circular economy, where the industrial 
system would be more restorative or regenerative and improves resource performance 
and material savings.

Transport Sector 
Initiatives are being looked at to utilise green technology across the land, aviation and 
maritime transport sectors which will improve energy efficiency and reduce carbon 
emissions, as well as embed greener operations. An example is the Green Port Policy 
for the maritime transport sector. Plans are also underway to improve connectivity and 
infrastructure to make travel more efficient. Governance of the transport sector has 
been flagged as an issue requiring attention, as there is a lack of coordination in the 
regulation of the multiple transportation segments. Other issues include the affordability 
of new transportation technologies such as energy efficient vehicles (EEVs) and the poor 
market perception and confidence in these new technologies. Recommendations include 
improving market demand for public transportation as well as providing information on 
mobility choices to the public. 
The targets for the Transport sector are summarised below:
Building Sector 
The building sector has made great strides in realising the aspirations towards sustainable 
construction and green buildings. Projects and measures include green building ratings, 
industrialised building systems, green building designs, green construction materials, and 
green product directories. The Government has lead the way by implementing initiatives 
to realise a 5% reduction in energy consumption of ministry buildings in the federal capital 
by 2020 as well as the adoption of green building rating scheme.
 
The main challenges highlighted include the high cost of investments in green technology 
and materials, the absence of regulatory drivers on building energy codes which largely 
dictate a building’s energy intensity (BEI), inadequate sustainability performance standards 
for building materials, lack of research in sustainable building materials and the need 
for a more skilled work force in the construction industry. Recommendations include 
standardisation of rating and audit tools and nudging the construction industry towards 
a circular economy by enforcing reduction of waste generation at site and increasing the 
recycled material content in construction materials.
Table B: Targets in Transport Sector


Executive Summary | 11 
Waste Sector  
There are many regulatory measures and policy directions in place for managing waste 
with multiple goals to reduce waste generation per capita and to turn waste into a source of 
wealth through waste recovery for material extraction and conversion of waste to energy. 
The main challenge lies in poor public awareness which must be persistently addressed 
to change consumption behaviour and lifestyle habits that generate undesirable quantities 
of waste.  Complicating the matter are issues in the jurisdictional scope over treatment 
of the different types of wastes generated. Recommendations where green technology is 
concerned have focused on R&D&C, innovations for minimisation of generation and safer 
disposal technologies, resource recovery, and conversion of waste to energy and reusable 
materials.

Water Sector  
The Government has put into place several initiatives to address the whole water continuum 
from resource use to distribution, utilisation, recovery and treatment. Emphasis has been 
on shifting towards a closed water loop system, water efficient products and services, 
as well as intensification of R&D&C on water conservation, treatment, distribution and 
rainwater harvesting.
 
Some of the challenges highlighted include the lack of funding for R&D&C, slow shifting 
of the industry and consumers towards water efficient products and services, inadequate 
use of analytical tools and detection technologies to address issues related to inefficient 
network distribution and end-user consumption. Recommendations have focused on the 
adaptation and adoption of suitable technology to facilitate efficiency and optimisation 
of scarce water resources, improved and cheaper treatment options and migration to a 
closed water loop system.

Figure B: Key areas targeted for the mainstreaming of green technology
Key Interventions
Based on the challenges highlighted and recommendations to facilitate mainstreaming 
green technology in the six sectors, several key topical areas have been identified as 
shown in Figure B. These topical areas will serve as the take-off point for action plans to 
be formulated to structure enabling mechanisms and facilitate funding and or investments 
in addition to nurturing home-grown talent and fostering smart partnerships.  
The NGTP outlined five (5) strategic thrusts with the aim to: 
•	 Strengthen the institutional framework; 
•	 Provide a conducive environment for green technology development; 
•	 Intensify human capital development in green technology; 
•	 Intensify green technology research and innovations; and 
•	 Promotion and public awareness. 
In realising the action plans for each topical area, the GTMP will draw on these five thrusts, 
adapting them to suit the goal of mainstreaming green technology as shown in Figure C.

Some examples of enabling mechanisms to raise consumer awareness include:
•	 Pricing environmental externalities (consequences, costs and risks);
•	 Providing public access portals which present updated information and tools that allow 
consumers and producers to calculate the carbon footprint of products and lifestyle 
choices;
•	 Providing detailed information on labelling and certification; and
•	 Awards and reward schemes that raise the visibility of green technology in products 
and services. 
The Government will play a significant role by making a concerted effort to change the 
Government procurement culture. Programmes will also be introduced to help policy 
makers become familiarised with emerging innovation concepts to encourage inclusion of 
technology foresight in policy making.
Improved access to financial resources will be explored to encourage investment in 
sustainable solutions.  Ideally, public sector capital allocations will combine with private 
sector and community sourced (e.g. crowd sourcing and funding) financing to enlarge 
the funding pool.  Innovative investment instruments such exchange-traded funds (e.g. 
green sukuk and bonds) will also be considered. Entrepreneurship programmes, to bolster 
market creation and adaptation will also be looked at. 


Executive Summary | 15 
Human capital development will be done in partnership with industry. This would include 
exploring new delivery systems of learning and skills training, where engaging instructors 
and delivering materials can shift beyond classrooms and timetables, where learning 
becomes on-demand. 
The R&D&C direction will be forged through a network of experts and research 
consortiums ensuring green technology development and application meet the national 
aspiration to become a regional green technology hub. A strong and close relationship 
between the research and industry sectors is encouraged to facilitate technology transfer, 
translate research into viable commercial outcomes, facilitate intellectual property rights 
arrangements, and most importantly to fuel collaborations resulting in innovations.

INTRODUCTION

Introduction | 17 
1.1 The Green Technology Landscape
The history of green technology (GT) dates back to the pre-industrial revolution era in the 
seventeenth century when windmills were used to power looms and mills. The invention 
of fossil fuel powered engines displaced the use of green technology (GT) which was 
deemed inefficient. GT is an initiative which evolves around various methodologies and 
materials enhancement, from techniques for energy generation to the creation of non-
toxic cleaning products. Many scientific studies pertaining to GT had demonstrated the 
causal effect of greenhouse gases (GHG) to global warming and climate changes. This 
resulted in an ever increasing societal push for environmental friendly mechanisms to help 
reduce the impact of energy-intensive economic growth. 
The current research projects undertaken by industry groups are pursuing and exploring 
the alternatives for green energy sources and sustainable production. Governments and 
the World Energy Council (WEC) are playing key roles in developing and implementing 
wide-scale GT efforts, aiming to meet the needs of society through indefinite ways into 
the future without damaging or depleting the natural resources. In short, it is to meet 
the present needs without compromising the ability of the future generations to meet 
their own needs, as per Bruntland Report for the World Commission on Environment and 
Development (1992). Examples of GT supplies include but not limited to renewable energy 
(RE), green building, green purchasing, green chemistry, green nanotechnology, etc.
Economic growth, industrialisation and growing population in developing countries such 
as Malaysia, demands acceleration of energy generation to meet the consumption patterns 
while global environmental problems call for drastic cuts on fossil fuel use. GT applications 
are the most logical step forward and the Malaysian Government has a pivotal role to 
accelerate this by introducing and implementing breakthrough policies.  GT is the future of 
any economy due to rising energy costs and the threat of global warming. Businesses are 
recognising the benefits of using technology to reduce their carbon footprint and minimise 
waste, which has positive impacts on their businesses.
1.2 National Green Technology Policy (NGTP)
Malaysia has taken the initial step to embrace GT 
through the National Green Technology Policy 
(NGTP), which was unveiled by the Prime Minister 
on 24th July 2009. The Policy focuses on four pillars, 
namely Energy, Environment, Economy and Social. 
The NGTP has identified GT as a key driver to 
accelerate the national economy and promote 
sustainable development. Spearheaded by the 
Ministry of Energy, Green Technology and Water 
(KeTTHA), Malaysia has constantly introduced 
various programs and incentives to advocate the 
use of GT in key economic sectors in the country.

The GT policy aims to facilitate the growth of GT industry and enhance its contribution to 
national economy, to increase national capability and capacity for innovation and enhance 
Malaysia’s competitiveness in the global market as well as to conserve the environment 
and ensure sustainable development for future generation.
1.3 The Eleventh Malaysia Plan (2016 – 2020) 
The Eleventh Malaysia Plan (2016-2020) or RMK-11 has outlined inclusiveness and 
sustainability as the key pillars where the pursuit of green growth for sustainability and 
resilience will be a game changer, shifting from the old “grow first, clean up later” model. 
 
There will be fundamental shifts in the utilisation of natural resources and the environment 
for socio-economic development. In the next five years, the Government will focus 
on strengthening the enabling environment, promoting sustainable consumption and 
production, conserving natural resources, and strengthening resilience against climate 
change and natural disasters.
The RMK-11 has given due emphasis to GT via a dedicated chapter titled ‘Pursuing 
Green Growth for Sustainability and Resilience’. The three strategies outlined in the Plan 
to enable green growth include1: 
The targets related to green growth that have been outlined in the RMK-11 are shown in 
Figure 1.3.

Introduction | 19 
The Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) represent a universal call to act to end poverty, 
protect the planet and ensure that all people enjoy peace and prosperity. There are 17 
SDGs which were built on the successes of the Millennium Development Goals, including 
new areas such as climate change, economic inequality, innovation and sustainable 
consumption. The goals are interconnected – often the key to success on one will involve 
tackling issues more commonly associated with another. The SDGs work in the spirit of 
partnership and pragmatism to make the right choices now to improve life, in a sustainable 
way, for future generations. The SDGs provide clear guidelines and targets for all countries 
to adopt in accordance with their own priorities and the environmental challenges of the 
world at large. GT plays a vital role towards achieving the extensive goals and indicators 
of SDGs namely Goal 6 (clean water and sanitation), Goal 7 (affordable and clean energy), 
Goal 11 (sustainable cities and communities), Goal 12 (responsible consumption and 
production) and Goal 13 (climate action).
The path-breaking Paris Agreement adopted in December 2015 marked a dramatic turn 
in the global efforts to mitigate climate change. The establishment of a new framework 
combining Nationally Determined Contribution (NDC) with new multilateral mechanisms is 
aimed at ensuring transparency, accountability and promoting greater ambition over time.
Malaysia has pledged to reduce its GHG emissions intensity of GDP by 45% by 2030 
relative to the emissions intensity of GDP in 2005. This consists of 35% on an unconditional 
basis and a further 10% is conditional upon receipt of climate finance, technology transfer 
and capacity building from developed countries.
1.4 Shaping the Future of Green Technology in Malaysia
As GT gains acceptance and grows in popularity across all economic sectors, there remain 
challenges i.e market, technological, financial and regulatory to overcome. Many of these 
challenges are similar to those in other countries, while some are specific to Malaysia.
Figure 1.4: Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) related to Green Technology


20 | Green Technology Master Plan 
To address these challenges, more than 20 consultations were conducted with relevant 
stakeholders involving over 300 representatives from the Government, industry, non-
governmental organisations, and academia to understand the root causes of the issues 
and to identify areas where the Government could play a role to address them. The 
stakeholders had given their full support to the initiative by KeTTHA in drafting the Green 
Technology Master Plan (GTMP) by sharing their ideas and perspectives about the future 
of GT development in Malaysia. The stakeholders agreed that the future of GT in Malaysia 
would be affected by the following factors:
•	
Policy direction and synergies among stakeholders
Currently there are more than 20 policies related to GT and sustainability under 
different ministries and agencies. A serious thought for cohesive and synergised policy 
is crucial in driving the growth of GT. KeTTHA is playing the leading role supported 
by other ministries such as Ministry of Natural Resources and Environment (NRE) 
and Ministry of Science, Technology and Innovation (MOSTI). At present, the national 
GT agenda is being guided by the National Green Technology and Climate Change 
Council or Majlis Teknologi Hijau dan Perubahan Iklim (MTHPI) chaired by the Prime 
Minister of Malaysia.
•	
Economic instruments, infrastructure and facilities
Economic instruments are essential to create the market for GT. This includes 
both physical and non-physical economic instruments. Physical infrastructure 
support such as charging station, waste transfer station, rail tracks and others are 
deemed to be provided by the Government. Non-physical economic instruments 
cover incentives and subsidies such as Feed-in Tariff (FiT), Investment Tax 
Allowance (ITA), Pioneer Status, carbon trade, technology transfer and others. 
 
•	
Cost efficiency and energy prices
 
Currently, the relevant products and services are deemed affordable only to certain 
income group and those who are well-aware of the climate change and global warming 
issues. Other opportunity costs (including carbon cost) is not factored into the project 
economies. Future energy prices are greatly influenced by the global economic 
performance. The current rate of energy consumption for building operations, the 
associated GHG emissions, and the uncertainties in future prices of coal, natural gas 
and electricity can be a cause of concern for policy makers and industry players.
•	
Technology advancement and innovation
 
Technology advancement and innovation plays a crucial role in developing a 
knowledge and innovation based economy. Many countries are also focusing on the 
development of low carbon economy and intensifying their low carbon technology. 
However, Malaysia is still at the infancy stage. The Government of Malaysia strives 
to gradually establish a market-oriented system for technological innovation and 
commercialisation as well as proliferating basic and applied scientific research.


Introduction | 21 
•	
Awareness, education and employment
 
Public empowerment is seen as an important force to move towards green practices. 
Inculcating public empowerment in the society would enhance people’s responsibility 
where all parties would be involved in environment conservation. Emphasis will be 
placed on public consultation involving decision makers, industry leaders and the 
general public. Public consultations aim to engage everyone who is relevant in green 
practices on various platforms, resulting in the emergence of a green minded society.
1.5 Summary
The contribution of GT towards the economic growth, cleaner environment, and enhanced 
well-being is critical. Realising this, the Government of Malaysia aims to build a firm 
foundation towards low carbon growth to augment the dire reduction of GHG thereby not 
only fulfilling the 45% carbon intensity reduction pledge but going beyond to join hands 
with the global community to achieve SDGs. The GTMP is crafted to pave the way to 
achieve ambitious targets come 2020 and 2030. GTMP positions Malaysia at the forefront 
of the global movement in climate change mitigation, while fulfilling its needs to leapfrog 
and becoming a high income nation, driven by green growth.

2.1 Introduction 
Malaysia’s energy industry is a critical sector of growth for the entire economy and has 
accounted for nearly 20% of the country’s total gross domestic product in recent years. After 
gaining independence in 1957, Malaysia started its economic journey as an agriculture- 
and mining-based country but fast migrated to a middle‐income nation by virtue of its 
rapid industrialisation strategies. The pattern of thinking has been mostly supply-centric 
and least-cost without giving ample focus on environmental issues. Fossil-fuel resources 
either indigenous or imported have been conveniently used in large scale and there has 
been little emphasis on pushing for renewables and more sustainable options.  The 
country took a giant step in putting energy usage in the proper perspective by gazetting 
the National Energy Policy 1979 by promulgating a more secure, cost-effective use of 
resources, efficient utilisation of energy and minimisation of impact to the environment. 
In order to reduce reliance on fossil fuels and efficient use of natural resources, energy 
policies such as Four-Fuel Diversification Policy (1981) and Five-Fuel Diversification Policy 
(2001) were introduced to diversify and seek new alternatives in the energy sector.
Beside diversification in the energy supply chain, other countervailing measures include the 
introduction of energy efficiency (EE) and demand-side management (DSM). The benefits of 
energy efficiency and associated conservation initiatives starting with behavioural pattern 
are paramount to the nation’s economy and performance in tandem with the management 
of the environment. The impetus of Malaysian green energy started with the formulation 
of the National Green Technology Policy (NGTP) in 2009. This means the implementation 
wave/move by the Government to accelerate the development of RE generation for supply 
to the national electricity network. 
The energy sector has had a prominent effect to the environment in Malaysia similar to 
other developing countries around the world, where the energy sector was the largest 
contributor to Greenhouse Gas (GHG) emissions in 2011, amounting to 218.9 MtCO2eq, an 
increase of 31% since 2000. The energy industries contributed the highest amount of CO2 
emissions at 113.6 MtCO2 within the same year, followed by transport, manufacturing and 
other industries. Within the energy industries, fossil fuel-based public electricity recorded 
the highest CO2 emissions at 87.9 MtCO2eq (77%) in 2011. This chapter will focus on the 
electricity sector covering both demand and supply side.
The national Four-Fuel Diversification Policy was introduced to ensure that the nation 
pursue balance utilisation of oil, gas, hydro and coal. The objective of the policy is to 
prevent over-dependence on oil as the main energy resource especially for electricity 
generation. The aim was to ensure reliability and security of energy supply by focusing on 
four (4) primary energy sources namely oil, gas, hydro and coal in the energy mix. In line 
with the policy, utilisation of gas in electricity generation increased from 67.80% in 1995 
to 78.70% in 2000. On the other hand, the contribution of oil in generation mix declined 
from 11% in 1995 to 5.3% in 2000.


Energy | 25 
The Five-Fuel Diversification Policy elevated RE as the fifth fuel in energy supply mix. The 
policy identified RE sources from biomass, biogas, municipal waste, solar and mini-hydro 
as additional sources of fuel for electricity generation besides the conventional sources of 
oil, gas, hydro and coal. It also aimed to encourage efficient utilisation of energy resources 
as well as reducing over-dependence on conventional or fossil fuel. The enactment of 
RE Act 2001 and establishment of SEDA has catalysed the growth of RE in the fuel 
diversification.
2.1.1 Energy Balance
The growth of RE as an alternative energy source was further enhanced to support the 
continuous increase of energy demand complemented with nominal efforts on energy 
efficiency (EE) measures. During the Eleventh Malaysia Plan (RMK-11), energy security 
and RE would continue to be given focus while demand side management (DSM), a major 
paradigm shift incorporating EE and conservation measures, would be implemented to 
ensure sustainable management of energy resources. Efforts have also been undertaken to 
ensure the long-term sustainability of the energy sector through resources diversification, 
continuous investment in new infrastructure and technology enhancement. Domestic 
reserves were added to on-going investments, which enhanced energy security. In 
addition, the improvement in productivity and efficiency as well as the implementation of 
efficient resource utilisation measures were also undertaken. 
The National Energy Balance 2014 by the Energy Commission (ST) reported that the final 
energy consumption for 2014 recorded a positive growth of 1.2% although marginally 
4.6% lower year-on-year (YoY) from 2013. The primary energy supply recorded a 1.9% 
growth rate in 2014 which was comparatively 4.9% lower YoY. Except for the decline in 
crude oil prices (1.4% YoY in 2014 as compared to 2013), other types of energy forms 
anticipated higher total primary energy supply (TPES) for all types of energy except for 
crude oil. The TPES for crude oil declined by 1.4% YoY due to higher net export with 
production of crude oil increased by 3.4% YoY (from 28,576 ktoe in 2013 to 29,545 ktoe in 
2014. The production of coal in 2014 decreased by 7.1% YoY, which has led to a decrease 
in the export of coal by 65.0%. TPES from RE recorded an increase from 2013 to 2014 
with primary supply of solar registered at 63 ktoe compared to only 38 ktoe in 2013; TPES 
of biodiesel increased to 300 ktoe from 188 ktoe in 2013 while TPES of hydro had also 
recorded a positive increase by 13.0% from 2013 level to settle at 3,038 ktoe.
2.1.2 Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) 
The GT agenda resonates well within the purview of SDGs. There are several goals that 
could pivot energy agenda in SDG, namely Goal 7 (Affordable and Clean Energy), Goal 11 
(Sustainable Cities and Communities), Goal 12 (Responsible Consumption and Production) 
and Goal 13 (Climate Action). In all likelihood, the central theme revolves around better 
management of resources, optimum harnessing of technologies and behavioural change 
required in making the right choices for energy use.


26 | Green Technology Master Plan 
2.2 Current Landscape
2.2.1 Energy Supply
In the Tenth Malaysia Plan (2011-2015) or RMK-10 plan period, the security of energy 
supply was improved to meet the increased energy demand. Efforts were undertaken to 
ensure the long-term sustainability of the energy sector through resources diversification, 
continuous investment in new infrastructure and technology enhancement. Domestic 
reserves were added to on-going investments, which enhanced energy security. In 
addition, the improvement in productivity and efficiency as well as the implementation of 
efficient resource utilisation measures were also undertaken. 
However, electricity supply industry in Malaysia is still considered over-dependent on 
fossil fuel with approximately 90% of overall generation mix attributed to coal and natural 
gas. The inevitable gas price increase for power generation and efforts towards achieving 
market prices has caused a major shift in the generation mix while coal on the other hand, 
has been more economically attractive source as least cost option and for base load to 
ensure the electricity prices are affordable without compromising security aspects.
Over-dependence on fossil fuel could be seen in light of both gas-fired and coal-fired 
plants being run as base load plants, while RE plants especially large hydro stations are 
committed during peak load, thus being called peakers. But there are also conundrums: 
recognition of the inclusive and competing objectives especially energy security versus 
optimal economic costing in the formulation of installed capacity, as well as environmental 
concerns being added as another factor for consideration. More often than not, economic 
objectives outstrip the other two, as generation costs have been based on prevailing 
commercial contracts with the utilities and gas providers.
Such a scenario may continue to manifest in the future, unless, efforts are taken to 
enhance other options including the introduction of new resources. It is crucial to reduce 
dependence on coal in compliance with the GHG emission reduction pledge at the 
United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) 21st Conference 
of the Parties (COP21). In the medium term (2016-2020) and long-run (2021-2030), the 
Government is keen on more sustainable and green energy initiatives. Thus, stakeholders 
and regulators need to balance options and look for midpoints without losing sight of the 
energy imperatives particularly available volume of molecules (gas) and tonnage (coal) 
and economic thresholds that drive the merit order of dispatch for all participating power 
plants in the national grid.

2.2.2 Electricity Generation
2.2.2.1 Installed Capacity 
Malaysia’s total installed capacity as of the end of 2014 was 30,875.23 MW, an increase of 
3.86% YoY from 29,728.57 MW in 2013. Around 78% of the installed capacity is located 
in Peninsular Malaysia, 14% in Sarawak and 8% in Sabah. 
The generation from RE portion was close to 10% with the large hydro contributing at 
9.6% while the remaining were non-hydro renewables at 0.5%
2.2.2.2 Generation Mix 
Gross electricity generation in 2014 recorded a 
healthy figure of 143,826.58 GWh, an increase 
of 2.0% YoY as compared to 140,985.01 GWh in 
2013. The peak demand for Peninsular Malaysia 
was recorded at 16,901 MW, Sarawak at 2,306 
MW and Sabah Grid at 908 MW. The share of 
natural gas as energy input in power stations 
increased from 43.7% in 2013 to 43.8% in 2014. 
The oil share of fuel used for generation continued 
to decline and in 2014, oil accounted for only 
2.9% and this was mostly for pockets of power 
plants in Sabah and Sarawak and mostly for 
black start operation in Peninsular Malaysia. 
Such decoupling of oil from generation mix was 
clearly in line with the Government’s strategy in 
emphasising the use of non-oil indigenous energy 
sources in the power sector.

Sources (2014)

28 | Green Technology Master Plan 
For the medium-term, coal-fired power plants are expected to continue to be used but 
there could be opportunities to draw down their numbers. The challenge is to have a 
transition plan while waiting for existing power plant contracts to expire and new gas and 
RE plants to come on board.
For coal-fired power plants that are earmarked to come in the RMK-11 window, the 
Government has indicated that new advanced thermal power generation that are more 
environment-friendly is required to protect the environment. Utilities and manufacturers 
could see this as an opportunity to introduce and adopt cutting edge technology.
2.2.2.3 Herfindahl-Hirschman Index (HHI)
 
In managing the resources efficiently, the Herfindahl-Hirschman Index (HHI) has been 
adopted with a target to maintain below 0.5 by 2020 for electricity subsector. HHI 
exceeding 0.5 reflects over-dependence on certain fuel resource and HHI for 2014 is 0.45 
which indicates a healthy index. 
2.2.2.4 Renewable Energy (RE)
  
RE resources are diverse and they could come from large hydro, solar photovoltaic, 
biogas, biomass and small hydro. In the RMK-10, the Government targeted 985 MW from 
RE generation by 2015. The total approved capacity in year 2014 is 6,285.24 MW.

Energy | 29 
With the inclusion of large hydro under definition of RE, it remained as the largest capacity 
installed as reflected in Figure 2.3.
Besides large hydro, other RE sources (solar, biogas, biomass) showed good progress with 
the enforcement of the RE Act 2011 paving for the implementation of Feed-in-Tariff (FiT) 
mechanism in Malaysia in 2011. FiT allows electricity to be produced from RE resources 
that can be sold to power utilities at a fixed premium price for a specific duration. 
Gradual take-off of RE is ideal but with improved technologies and greater efficiency, 
a bigger take-off could be anticipated. RE is also attractive by virtue of its potential 
infinite quantum. RE is a practical rebalancing mechanism, able to offset huge swings 
of conventional (coal-fired and gas-fired) power plant costs, as each RE unit can be a 
modular set-up. 
The aspirational targets for installed RE capacity are set at 20% in 2020, 23% by 2025 and 
30% by 2030 as compared with 18.9% in 2016. However, it is conditional on the levelled 
cost in each RE source is close to conventional resources, with no new major coal-fired 
power plants established post 2020.
2.2.3 Energy Demand
2.2.3.1 Electricity Consumption
The total electricity consumption for Malaysia recorded a growth of 4.8% YoY from 
116,087.51 GWh in 2013 to 121,698 GWh in 2014. The share in electricity consumption 
was highest for the industrial sector at 44.2%, followed by the commercial sector at 33.0%, 
domestic sector at 21.2%, public lighting at 1.2% and 0.5% for mining and other sectors.

30 | Green Technology Master Plan 
The Government has shifted focus from increasing supply to meet the demand to reducing 
consumption by introducing EE and conservation measures. This makes provision for 
DSM to serve as a countervailing force to the traditional supply side framework or supply-
centric. DSM will be a very useful mechanism to trim away the demand spikes, which 
eventually helps in the reduction of CO2 and deferment of generation planting up. DSM is 
also part of a planned initiative under RMK-11 for sustainable production and consumption 
(SCP) under Focus Area B, Strategy B3. 
KeTTHA, ST and SEDA Malaysia have also carried out programmes and projects to 
implement EE and energy conservation. Among the programmes implemented include, EE 
measures for buildings, Sustainability Achieved via Energy Efficiency (SAVE) and Minimum 
Energy Performance Standard (MEPS) as well as equipment labelling programmes.
During RMK-10 period, energy efficient designs were incorporated in new Government 
buildings while some existing buildings were retrofitted to reduce energy consumption. 
Four Government buildings located in Putrajaya were retrofitted between 2011 to 2014 
and successfully reduced electricity use ranging from 4% to 19% monthly, with an 
equivalent of RM7,000 to RM130,000 in savings. Other measures promoted include, 
setting air-conditioner temperature at minimum of 24°C and reducing 5% of electricity bills 
for all Government buildings. The Uniform Building By-Law (UBBL), 1984 was also revised 
in 2012 to incorporate the Malaysian Standard: Code of Practice on Energy Efficiency 
and Renewable Energy for Non-Residential Buildings (MS1525). Currently, Selangor and 
Terengganu State Governments have incorporated MS1525 into their state UBBL. 
In 2011, the SAVE program was implemented to encourage utilisation of energy efficient 
equipment. A total of RM44.3 million was allocated for the program to offer rebates for 
any purchase of new energy efficient refrigerators and air conditioners for domestic use 
as well as chillers for industries. Total energy saved from this equipment for the period 
from 2011 to 2013 was 306.9 GWh. This has resulted in GHGs avoidance amounting to 
208.705 tCO2eq.

2.2.3.2 Electricity Intensity
In Malaysia, the energy intensity which is a measure of the energy efficiency of a nation's 
economy, is still high compared to other ASEAN countries. However, marginally lower 
growth rates have brought some indication that energy shall be decoupled from growth by 
end of this decade. This could hasten the country’s quest to be more energy efficient as 
EE offers an effective energy policy instrument to address the energy supply security issue 
as well as energy-related environmental issues in the country. It can lead the country to a 
sustainable energy path, as energy intensity is anticipated to reduce from a base of 1.5% 
in 2014 to 10% in 2025 and 15% in 2030.
At the regional level, ASEAN’s energy intensity is anticipated to improve over the period 
of 2013-2035 as its energy demand is expected to increase by only 2.7 times while the 
GDP grows by 3.7 times. On this score, Malaysia needs to reduce energy intensity by 20% 
in 2020 based on 2005 level, as part of ASEAN Plan of Action for Energy Cooperation 
(APAEC 2015-2025) Action Plans.
2.3 Issues and Challenges 
2.3.1 Governance
There are various stakeholders entrusted with multiple aspects of governance related to 
the energy sector, that at times give rise to overlapping roles, authorities, responsibilities 
and jurisdiction, creating a delicate and complex dynamic system in governing the energy 
sector. This has resulted in confusion and lack of holistic policies to the industry players 
and other stakeholders. Among the main issues are inconsistent policies, lack of clarity 
in demarcation of regulatory oversight as well as dual role of a single entity entrusted to 
govern, being the industrial player and the regulator at the same time. Strong and effective 
governance is required to bring stakeholders together, towards a complementary regime 
of multiple mandates to ensure that the energy sector is managed efficiently.
GT has a significant role to play here, where technology can help bridge the multiple 
mandates and policy directions. Industry players and the public require coherent signal 
from cohesive sector to harness full potential of GT. In this regard, the public require a 
one-stop-centre for information, and airing their suggestion and even grouses on issues 
related to GT. It is anticipated that as GT continue developing, there are bound to be 
opportunities to unlock further values along supply and retail chains as in the case of RE.


32 | Green Technology Master Plan 
2.3.2 Accelerating Sustainable Energy
 
The generation mix for the electricity subsector continues to rely heavily on fossil fuel 
recording as high as 92.6% and 92.4% in 2006 and 2011. The figure was only marginally 
reduced to 90.6% in 2013 but has continued hovering around 90% in the past few years. 
It is time to make a definitive position to reduce fossil fuel consumption especially coal. 
The coal-gas combo shall be reduced to manageable quantum (e.g. 80%-85% by 2030), 
by imposing a HHI of 0.5 on any fuel source and mandate steady stream of RE take-
off including large hydro power stations. But this vision needs to be complemented by 
high availability of base load plants, reliable RE performance, competitive RE pricing and 
DSM programme. Thus, a transition plan is needed for this to materialise. Similar calls for 
decarbonisation and eventually carbon-neutral activities are very much in synchronisation 
with GT milestones.
For RE, there is a huge gap between the target and the achievement, which is attributed to 
the hesitance of local banks in providing loans to RE players and the difficulty in securing 
feedstock for long-term agreement. In addition, the collection of RE Fund is limited as it 
is only based on 1.6% of electricity bill. The amount collected annually is about RM600 
million and the accumulated amount might not be sufficient to ensure continuous viability 
of RE to gain traction in the generation mix portfolio. On a regional collaborative spirit, the 
national activities shall be aligned with the ASEAN Member States in term of increasing 
RE and reducing energy intensity.
Paradoxically, low electricity tariff pose a hurdle to improvise/retrofit equipment/connection 
for greater energy efficiency. This is further compounded by fear of long-term investment 
returns for each measure taken. A quasi market situation still pivoting on fossil-fuel base 
load operation with subsidies might impede steps to go for RE. Thus, the Government 
shall be firm in completely eliminating any form of subsidy although social safety net 
should still be in place. Slow take-off on energy efficiency initiatives and DSM on grand 
scale may be attributed to lack of financing mechanism. 
In addition, lack of consistency in the initiatives to spur the sector towards energy efficiency 
and subsequently loss in momentum could be attributed to mixed signals coming from 
the industry. Lack of awareness, perhaps driven by the fear of long gestation period and 
long term for price/economic parity for EE/DSM retrofitted equipment, among the public 
and users has also impeded the implementation of more EE and DSM initiatives. Work to 
reduce energy intensity may take time, as the industry needs to send a strong message 
that there is a need to go for quality investment for industrial applications and gradually 
reducing massive or dirty load. A transitional plan and monitoring system should also be 
instituted.

2.4.1 Electricity Generation 
2.4.1.1 National Renewable Energy Efficiency Action Plan (NREPAP) and Feed-in-Tariff 
(FiT)
The NREPAP 2009 is intended to transform Malaysia into a nation that is: 
•	
Able to sustain its energy consumption through generation from RE sources;
•	
Independent of fuel imports;
•	
Able to develop green technologies; and 
•	
Able to conserve the environment. 
The NREPAP is also a national effort to mitigate GHG emissions originating from fossil fuel 
power generation in the long run. With strong efforts driven by the NREPAP
, the Renewable 
Energy Act 2011 and Feed-in Tariff (FiT) act as a catalyst for RE technology adoption. As 
a result, the RE installed capacity has increased to 18.4% in 2016, with a compounded 
annual growth rate (CAGR) of 13% from 2010. 
Higher projection of RE take-off could be dependent on higher FiT rates than the present 
1.6% surcharge on electricity bill but there could be huge opposition to impose higher 
percentages, which could nullify the objective of getting the Rakyat to embrace more RE.
2.4.1.2 Malaysia Biomass Industry Action Plan (MBIAP) 
The MBIAP aims to drive Small and Medium Enterprises (SMEs) towards high value-
added activities in the biomass industry. Part of the strategy of the MBIAP is to convert 
organic waste and landscape waste into a source of RE for large-scale biomass power 
plants. Small-scale biogas generation units could be set up to convert waste into biogas 
for power plants. As a result, it will reduce landfill waste; reduce the amount of methane 
released into the environment; and spur business opportunities for SMEs in the biogas 
industry. 
The MBIAP advocated that energy-intensive industries, such as cement and glove 
industries, to switch from fossil fuels to biomass as the source of electricity generation 
for their manufacturing plants. The benefits from undertaking the switching activities are 
carbon credits from GHG emission reduction and a better corporate social responsibility 
image supported by the Green Investment Tax Allowance (GITA). 
The low take-off has not augured well for the biomass subsector, as it needs a clear and 
distinct signal on the viability of using biomass as energy resource.
2.4.1.3 Malaysian Electricity Supply Industries Trust Account (MESITA)
MESITA plays a crucial role in the R&D of the electricity sector. MESITA was launched in 
July 1997 and is administered by the Ministry of Energy, Green Technology and Water 
(KeTTHA) with monetary contribution by the national utility company and independent 
power producers (IPPs) that are connected to the Peninsular Grid and has since funded 
various R&D projects and pilot projects in the electricity sector. 


Energy | 35 
The voluntary contribution is 1% of their electricity sale. The fund places high emphasis on 
EE projects as well as R&D and RE projects as illustrated in Table 2.2 below. 
2.4.1.4 Capacity Development and Training Programmes
SEDA is currently providing various professional training courses related to solar PV on 
topics such as:
•	
Grid-Connected Photovoltaic (GCPV) Systems Design Course;	
•	
GCPV for Non-Engineers;
•	
GCPV for Wireman and Chargeman;
•	
Continuous Development Programme (CDP) for Qualified Persons (QPs);
•	
Off-Grid Photovoltaic (OGPV) Systems Design Course;
•	
Solar PV Installation and Maintenance; and
•	
EE & Energy Management (EM) Training Programme.
	
As of end 2015, 2,190 participants have benefitted from SEDA’s training courses. These 
training courses, conducted by certified trainers are designed based on stakeholder 
engagements and feedback from the industry to address the labour gap faced by the RE 
industry. SEDA assesses its guidelines periodically and reviews its training courses every 
three years in order to ensure that these guidelines and training courses remain relevant 
to the industry.
The RE industry is expected to create about 15,300 jobs, comprising skilled and semi-
skilled jobs. From 2016 to 2020, the Government aims to provide training to 1,740 
personnel through SEDA’s various training courses. These trainings will create experts in 
the field of biomass, biogas, mini hydro and solar PV. The participants will be employees 
from the industry such as RE project developers, financial institutions and potential 
service providers. In addition, the private sector will be encouraged to conduct training 
and increase the number of RE experts. SEDA targets to roll out new training courses for 
other RE sources, such as biogas, biomass and mini hydro, to raise the competency level 
of human capital in the RE industry.

Notwithstanding the early successes by the authority, the training calendar and its 
comprehensiveness still have room for enhancement especially the inclusion of new RE 
sources. 
2.4.1.5 Incentive Based Regulations (IBR)
IBR was introduced in early 2014 for the electricity subsector as part of the modernisation 
of the electricity supply industry. It made way for a structured, transparent and informed 
way of tariff setting taking into cognisance the huge requirement for capital expenditure 
(CAPEX) and operational expenditure (OPEX) by the utilities. IBR ensures the utility 
companies, namely, Tenaga Nasional Berhad (TNB) and Sabah Electricity Sdn. Bhd. 
(SESB) to continuously enhance their efficiencies and increase transparency in providing 
electricity supply to customers in full compliance of the projected expenditures. In addition, 
Energy Commission (ST) continues to audit and review past performances as well as 
accommodate new requests from the utility companies. 
The check and balance focal areas clearly manifest especially by virtue of:
•	
Determination of financial performance and technical efficiency targets of the utility; 
and 
•	
Implementation of efficiency sharing mechanism to provide the utility a continuous 
and sustained incentive to pursue cost efficiencies in every regulatory period.
Through IBR, regulator also has a societal obligation to regulate service quality to ensure:
•	
Profits are not taken at expense of quality;
•	
All customers receive a reasonable quality of service (not only those where it is 
profitable); and
•	
Acceptable service levels are maintained.

2.4.1.6 Efficiency in Power Generation 
By end of 2020, the first generation of IPPs will retire in phases. To replace these plants and 
their generation capacity (7,626 MW), new tenders will be issued in stages. To ensure CO2 
mitigation, ST has included the minimum requirement of adopting the latest technologies, 
such as combined cycle gas turbines, ultra-supercritical (USC) and supercritical (SC) 
technologies coal power plants compared to older machine designs, SC and USC types 
are using less volume of coal to produce the same amount of energy.
However, the main issue is cost – utilities and IPPs have to construct costlier plants and 
may have to absorb the additional costs compared to cheaper conventional options. For 
operation-purpose, the new machines will naturally be dispatched first as base load plants 
in preference over the older designs and naturally some old plants might not even be used. 
Such under-utilisation of assets will result in higher than projected tariff to consumers and 
some might even miscontrue the higher tariff as a way utilities are trying to recover their 
ROI for such new novelties.
2.4.1.7 Large Scale Solar (LSS) Plants
To drive growth in RE power generation, LSS farms will be promoted. This will increase 
the overall RE mix in the country and complement the heavy dependence on fossil fuel in 
horizon years. The targets for LSS farms are elaborated as follows:
•	
LSS farm - By 2020, Malaysia will have an additional installed capacity of 1,200 MW 
of LSS farms, of which 200 MW will be in Sabah and 1,000 MW will be in Peninsular 
Malaysia. 
2.4.1.8 Hydro Power Generation Plants
Large hydro power generation plants will be promoted to drive growth in RE power 
generation to increase the overall RE mix and complement the heavy dependence on 
fossil fuel. The targets for large hydro powered generation plants are elaborated as follows:
•	
Large Hydro - By 2025, there will be an additional installed capacity of 1,943MW large 
hydro dam power plants in Malaysia i.e. in Kelantan (Nenggiri – 300MW), Pahang 
(Tekai – 168MW), Sabah (Upper Padas – 180MW) and Sarawak (Baleh – 1,295MW).
Following a major flood incident in December 2014, the development of hydro dams will 
also cater for flood mitigation measures, especially in the east coast of Malaysia.


38 | Green Technology Master Plan 
2.4.1.9 Net Energy Metering (NEM)
 
To complement the current FiT mechanism in encouraging the take-off of RE, a new 
instrument termed as NEM has been implemented. The objective of NEM is to promote 
and encourage more RE generation, by prioritising internal consumption before any excess 
electricity generated is fed to the grid. NEM is anticipated to encourage manufacturing 
facilities and the public to generate electricity without any restriction on their generation 
capacity. This will further assist the Government’s effort to increase the contribution of RE 
in the generation mix. NEM was launched in November 2016. The implementation agency 
for NEM is SEDA while the regulator is ST.
The introduction of NEM is to achieve the stipulated non-large-hydro RE targets. Unlike 
FiT, only excess electricity generated from the solar PV system will be sold to the grid. As 
a result, it will incentivise efficient electricity consumption since the return on investment 
for the facility is associated with electricity savings (amount of electricity sold to the grid). 
Under the NEM, the capacity limits for residential are 12 kW (single phase) and 72 kW 
(three phase), and 1 MW for non-residential (subject to terms and conditions).
In the existing plan, NEM will be applicable to solar PV rooftop installations power 
generation. It aims to achieve a cumulative solar capacity of 500 MW by 2020, starting 
with a 100 MW quota per year. NEM is open to all electricity consumers with the following 
target capacities: industry (45%), commercial (45%) and residential (10%). 
2.4.2 Demand Side Management (DSM)
Increasing demand for electricity supply has imminently created issues associated with 
management of consumption due to rapid expansion of economic activities and growing 
population. 
From 1990 to 2014, electricity consumption grew at an average growth rate of 8%, which 
is higher than the average growth rate of GDP of 6% in the same period. Such a scenario 
has forced energy policy planners and implementers to adopt best practices in managing 
EE in myriad ways. The objective is to inculcate behavioural changes in order to pursue 
viable retrofitting schemes and innovation that could lead to significant cost savings and 
thereby improving competitiveness of the energy industry. EE and associated conservation 
strategies shall also help to conserve the usage and exploitation of the nation’s limited 
natural resources while at the same time reduce the negative environmental impacts. 


Energy | 39 
2.4.2.1 Home Energy Report (HER)
The Home Energy Report (HER) is a pilot programme commenced by TNB in 2015, which 
has provided home energy reports to 200,000 consumers in the Klang Valley, 1,000 houses 
(800 in Malacca and 200 in Putrajaya) via mail, email or a web portal. The home energy 
reports has provided consumers with:
•	
Detailed information, including analysis of their energy consumption patterns with 
comparisons to similar houses in the neighbourhood; 
•	
Year-on-year tracking of energy consumption patterns, with monthly household 
efficiency rankings; and 
•	
Energy saving tips and EE measures. 
HER mirrors a similar programme in California to induce behavioural changes among 
consumers. The benchmarking analysis in the report increases awareness of energy 
usage and promotes EE measures among consumers. TNB is targeting to roll out HER to 
500,000 consumers via hardcopy reports and to all consumers nationwide via web portals 
in the near term. A total of 4 million smart meters will be installed by 2020 at an estimated 
cost of RM4 billion by the utility company. As a target, the nationwide implementation of 
smart grid technology will kick start post-2020. 
2.4.2.2 Efficient Management of Electrical Energy Regulations (EMEER, 2008)
Efficient 
Management 
of 
Electrical 
Energy 
Regulations 
2008 
was 
gazetted 
on 
15th 
December 
2008. Under this regulation, all installation that consume or generate 3 million kWh or more 
of electricity over a period of 6 months is required to engage an electrical energy manager 
who shall, among others, be responsible to analyse the total consumption of electrical 
energy. In addition, the electrical energy manager will also advise on the development and 
implementation of measures to ensure efficient management of electrical energy as well 
as to monitor the effectiveness of the measure taken.  
The regulations provide description on efficient management of installations for consumers 
and generators for both existing and new installations through the submission of 
information, records and documents to the regulator as prescribed. In order to assist each 
installation becoming energy efficient, the appointment of a Registered Electrical Energy 
Manager (REEM), having certain competency and experiences in energy management as 
certified by ST, has been made mandatory.
2.4.2.3 Minimum Energy Performance Standards (MEPS) and Energy Labelling
Minimum Energy Performance Standard (MEPS) initiative was introduced by ST through 
the enactment of Regulation 101A, 101B and 101C. This was an enhancement to the 
initially voluntary “Star” labelling programme, which was introduced to promote energy 
efficient domestic products. The certification by ST is for selected products, which are 
rated from 1-5 stars as per their EE feature.


40 | Green Technology Master Plan 
MEPS was gazetted in the Electricity Regulation (Amendments) 2013 and implemented by 
the ST on selected electrical appliances such as refrigerators, air-conditioners, televisions, 
fans as well as lighting. The regulation requires the said electrical appliances and lighting 
that enter the Malaysian market or are sold to consumers to meet the minimum energy 
performance standards as stipulated in the regulation.
In addition to this, a few more concurrent activities with different windows have been 
introduced:
•	
The Voluntary compliance with MS1525 (Code of Practice on EE and Use of RE for 
Non- Residential Buildings) made mandatory through its incorporation under the 
Uniform Building by Law (UBBL) to create awareness on and development of EE 
buildings; 
•	
Industrial EE for Malaysian Manufacturing Sector - A Global Environment Facility (GEF) 
and United Nation Industrial Development Organization (UNIDO) supported projects to 
promote use of MS ISO 50001: Energy Management System (EnMS) to build capacity 
of SME in managing energy usage and incorporates EnMS to the industrial facilities;
•	
Building Sector Energy Efficiency Project (BSEEP) - A GEF and United Nation 
Development Programme (UNDP) supported project and focused on EE for new and 
existing buildings; and 
•	
Retrofitting of Government Buildings.

2.4.2.4 National Energy Efficiency Action Plan (NEEAP)
The National Energy Efficiency Action Plan, which was approved by the Cabinet in 2015, 
is focused to tackle issues pertaining to energy supply by managing demand efficiently. It 
prescribes a path towards improving energy efficiency by pursuing the implementation of 
measures that are considered as practically do-able and replicable with measured targets. 
As energy demand must be managed, the focus will be on securing Malaysia's energy 
resources and ensure sustainable development for future generation by promulgating 
productive use of energy and minimising waste. However, NEEAP with a scoping period 
of 2016-2025 requires a dedicated budget for implementation. It requires commitment 
from all stakeholders and role-players in the industry, as overarching development in other 
parallel initiatives could pose a challenge for advocacy of NEEAP activities. 
2.4.2.5 Co-Generation
Co-generation or combined heat and power system has been practiced in some of the 
earliest installations of electrical generation. The result is an optimised use of fuel in 
generating energy (electrical and heat). Utility standby charges offered by utilities will be 
reviewed to encourage industries to produce electricity through co-generation. During 
the RMK-11 period, policy and regulations on future co-generation development will be 
comprehensively studied and formulated.
Co-generation is a thermodynamically efficient use of fuel. It is the simultaneous generation 
of electrical or mechanical power and useful thermal energy from a single source of primary 
energy.
In order to promote an uptake of co-generation, barriers such as the high top-up and 
standby rates need to be overcome. Key strategic measures ought to be taken to overcome 
the specific barriers identified covering the design of standby, top-up, load-connected and 
stand-by charges and revisiting the existing incentives and local manufacturers' capacity 
building.
Strategies and approaches used by other countries in promoting co-generation systems 
for their markets should be examined to explore the possible adoption with some changes 
that will suit our local market.
2.5 Way Forward 
Embedding the economy, environmental and social paradigm will be adopted to drive 
changes in the energy sector. Giving edge to smart and informed usage of energy guided 
by compelling advantages, the approach strives to be coherent, collective and inclusive, 
taking into the following considerations: 


42 | Green Technology Master Plan 
2.5.1 Electricity Generation
2.5.1.1 Energy Planning Framework
The following are initiatives in improving the energy planning framework:
•	
Striking a balance between energy security, economic affordability and environmental 
sustainability with minimal damage to the ecosystem;
•	
Consider environment-friendly framework in existing planning mode, which has been 
relying primarily on least cost all this while. A pro-environmental position could also 
prevent harmful environmental impacts such as emission of GHG and global warming 
effects;
•	
Some degree of flexibility is required. Obviously, such policy-making may have to 
be pursued taking into account of the needs to ensure balanced supply-demand 
scenario and drawing inspiration from new requirements such as green growth, 
greater efficiency and other inclusive vantage points in the economy. In many cases, 
all scenarios have to be considered beyond solely deterministic economic outcomes, 
and may entail social obligations; and
•	
A diverse generation mix emphasising on green technology approach and RE as well 
as comprehensive programmes on EE and DSM could lead to a new norm being 
adopted.
2.5.1.2 Planting Up Scenario
Revisit our planting up scenarios and consider sustainable approach management:
•	
New ways will have to be explored, to embed energy planning at the national and 
macro level and business operations at the micro level more sustainable, by exploring 
avenues to mitigate environmental risks in supply chains and to minimise carbon 
footprints;
•	
A general strategy should be based on drawing down use of gas (including Liquefied 
Natural Gas - LNG) and coal while stretching further large hydro and non-hydro RE. 
This could pave the way for conservation of indigenous resources such as natural 
gas and optimised use of imported resources such as coal. Nevertheless, regulators 
and utilities should be cautious in crafting this new scenario as there might still be a 
lack of viable and reliable alternatives to those fossil-fuel options in term of ensuring 
adequate generation quantum especially for base load purposes;
•	
In managing the resources efficiently, the Herfindahl-Hirschman Index (HHI) will 
be adopted with target to maintain below 0.5 in 2020 for electricity subsector. HHI 
exceeding 0.5 reflects over-dependence on certain fuel resource and HHI for 2014 is 
0.45 which indicates a healthy index;
•	
Institute a two-pronged approach via new initiatives: rebalancing and resizing supply 
(ensuring diversity) and demand (more EE and DSM initiatives) thresholds and revisiting 
on-going initiatives;
•	
Planning must readily advocate more components of EE. Boosting EE will help stretch 
energy resources and slow down the increase in carbon emissions. It will also create 
opportunities for businesses and consumers to invest. Setting efficiency standards for 
appliances and equipment, will encourage higher energy productivity;


Energy | 43 
•	
DSM should be on the overdrive as it is a viable option to manage energy profile by 
curtailing unnecessary energy utilisation by consumers, and thus help shave off high 
spikes of electricity demand. A comprehensive DSM master plan will pave the way 
towards a balanced management of the entire energy spectrum;
•	
Utilisation of RE sources including biomass, biogas, solar PV and mini hydro will 
be continued as alternative fuel sources for electricity generation. In addition, the 
potential of geothermal, wind and ocean energy will also be explored. RE capacity is 
expected to reach 2,080 MW by 2020, contributing to 7.8% of total installed capacity 
in Peninsular Malaysia and Sabah. RE needs to be enhanced and other avenues such 
as LSS need to be initiated; and
•	
Dual track grid-connected and off-grid/distributed generation should be pursued for 
RE to cater for various needs at grid-level and localised entities.
2.5.1.3 Exploration of Other RE Sources
Studies will be conducted to identify new RE sources to diversify the generation mix. 
In the RMK-11 plan period, focus will be given in exploring new RE sources, enhancing 
capacity of RE personnel and implementing NEM to further intensify the development 
of RE. Looking from strategic standpoint, the same agenda could still be pursued post-
2020. New RE sources such as wind, geothermal and ocean energy will be looked at. The 
national wind mapping will further enable a study on the feasibility of wind energy to be 
developed. Geothermal potential will also be further explored with the discovery of a 12 
km2 geothermal field in Apas Kiri, Sabah. Viability of ocean energy will be studied to take 
advantage of Malaysia’s geographical position of being surrounded by sea. 
2.5.1.4 Revisiting Co-Generation Policy
As of 2015, ST has issued 32 co-generation licences which had an overall capacity of 
1,065.7 MW. However, co-generation power plants remain a small component in the total 
capacity installed. The Government decided in the RMK-11 that policies and regulations 
on future co-generation development would be comprehensively studied and formulated 
due to market potential in co-generation. Co-generation or a combined heat and power 
system can generate substantial savings to end users through more efficient fuel use. 
In the study, sector specific issues will be plotted out in order to design the strategy 
in co-generation. Some of the issues, such as the utility standby charges offered, will 
be proposed for review to encourage industries to improve the attractiveness of co-
generation.
2.5.1.5 Long-Term Plan for Electricity Tariff Rate for Higher Renewable Mix
In addition to the current subsidies rationalisation, KeTTHA will take the lead to look 
into the long-term planning of electricity tariff rates, especially post-2020. This includes 
the incorporation of cost of emission in energy planning. As the country moves towards 
becoming a high-income nation by 2020, it is expected that the life style and affordability 
of the rakyat shall improve over time. The gradual reduction of subsidies and increase 
in green growth awareness will prepare for the shift towards greater GT adoption and 
willingness to pay for sustainable growth, especially in terms of higher renewable mix in 
power generation. 


44 | Green Technology Master Plan 
A continuous readiness assessment will be commenced to strategise the long-term 
plan. In parallel with this planning, the assessment on Malaysia’s energy elasticity will be 
commenced to support the formulation of the electricity rate. This is important to shift 
Malaysia from energy intensive growth to sustainable growth. In the long term, the aim 
is to achieve lower energy elasticity whereby there is a smaller percentage change in 
electricity consumption to achieve one percentage change in national GDP
. 
2.5.1.6 New Technologies
Prepare for dynamic renewal and disruptive technologies, as there are many things that 
are constantly changing and may require new ways of thinking. Strive for innovation via 
imagination i.e. floating solar PV plant; 
•	
New ways could come in the shape of circular economy and minimal change to 
ecosystems; and
•	
As it is foreseeable that energy planning may be exogenous in future, rigorous 
surveillance of global energy events and changes should be enforced and that may 
include disruptive technologies. An indigenous green technology offering could well 
insulate Malaysia from such risks and shocks.
2.5.1.7 Enhanced Cross Sectoral Collaboration in Research, Development and 
Commercialisation (R&D&C) To Develop Localised Technology
Leverage on the availability of relevant funds and grants under MOSTI, KeTTHA (MESITA 
fund), more cross-sectoral collaboration between KeTTHA, research institutes and other 
entities will be encouraged to develop localised technology. Some of the focus areas of 
the collaboration would be technology breakthrough to:
•	
Enable GT application via distributed generation, tailored to Malaysia’s context and 
environment;
•	
Enhance efficiency of electricity production; and
•	
Improve ease of application to address traditional constraints in terms of size and 
space needed for technology adoption.
Work closer and inculcate greater collaboration with stakeholders, private sector, civil 
society and public – celebrate EE, RE adherents and advocates such as solar mamas 
(those Sabahan housewives who learnt about solar PV on their own in India and brought 
back that knowledge home to propagate to others). We need new energy champions and 
icons.
2.5.2 Energy Efficiency
The Government plans to reinvigorate DSM and NEEAP
, the introduction of smart grid 
technology and also design communication strategy to its targeted audience to promote 
efficient use of electricity. 


Energy | 45 
2.5.2.1 Reinvigorating Demand Side Management (DSM) in Electricity Subsector and 
Harnessing Of Electricity in Thermal and Transport
DSM is a critical shift that enables balanced management of the entire energy spectrum. 
In 2016, the Economic Planning Unit (EPU) has initiated a preliminary study on DSM. 
The preliminary study determines the baseline of current DSM initiatives and the scope 
and boundary setting for an eventual comprehensive study. The eventual comprehensive 
study will be undertaken to develop a DSM Master Plan with broad horizon to efficiently 
manage energy demand in the economy especially in the transport, building (residential 
and commercial) as well as industrial sectors.
With DSM, the return on the utilisation of existing new electricity supply assets (load 
management) will be maximised. DSM will also play a role in slowing down the nation’s 
electricity demand growth rate, which will result in the deferment of the need to construct 
new power plants.
2.5.2.2 Energy Efficiency and Conservation (EE&C) Act
Enactment of a comprehensive EE&C Act. The DSM programmes could be accelerated 
when a comprehensive EE&C Act has been gazetted and duly enforced. With a 
comprehensive EE&C Act, the gap within the existing EE regulations (EMEER 2008 and 
MEPS) can be addressed properly and the coverage of the regulations can be widened 
to thermal energy as well. Thus, streamlining the efforts between the Government and 
industries.
2.5.2.3 Reinvigorating National Energy Efficiency Action Plan (NEEAP)
In order to maintain energy security and to sustain energy supply, the energy demand 
must be managed. Hence, the NEEAP was created for the period of 2016 to 2025 and was 
approved by the Cabinet on 6 January 2016, to drive the national agenda for the country 
to be efficient in energy consumption especially electricity usage. 


46 | Green Technology Master Plan 
Table 2.4: Key initiatives and programmes under NEEAP
The 10-year NEEAP aims to promote EE by ensuring the productive use of energy and 
minimising wastage. This will subsequently contribute to sustainable development and 
increased welfare and competitiveness. 
There are 10 specific EE programmes to be implemented in the next 10 years to drive the 
national EE agenda. These programmes are grouped under five key initiatives as follows:
 
•	
Initiative 1: Promotion of 5-star rated appliances;
•	
Initiative 2: MEPS;
•	
Initiative 3: Energy audits and energy management in buildings and industries;
•	
Initiative 4: Promotion of co-generation; and
•	
Initiative 5: Energy efficient building design
2.5.2.4 Smart Grid Technology
Smart grid is the digital technology that allows for two-way communication between the 
utility and its customers, and the sensing along the transmission lines is what makes 
the grid smart. Like the Internet, the smart grid will consist of controls, computers, 
automation, and new technologies and equipment working together, but in this case, these 
technologies will work with the electrical grid to respond digitally to changing electric 
demand. Smart grid technology is timely to prepare the country’s infrastructure for greater 
RE mix in the future, and also efficient management of electricity supply and consumption. 
This is because smart grids are not only suitably catered for the intermittency nature of RE, 
but it also increases the efficiency of the entire electrical delivery system.

KeTTHA is expected to undertake a study on smart grid technology in 2017. The 
outcome of the study will contribute to the strategic plan on smart grid technology in 
Malaysia. This includes the baseline assessment of the current grid system, as well as 
the required institutional and infrastructure upgrades, human capital development and 
also R&D&C on smart grids in Malaysia to realise the benefits of smart grid technology. 
Extensive public consultation, especially with the utility companies, power producers and 
technology providers, will commence to gather their inputs and concerns with regard to 
investment in smart grid technologies. A joint sector lead comprising of the private sector 
will be identified and established to drive the deployment and development of smart grid 
technology in Malaysia. This includes collaboration from utilities to micro-grid design, 
and implementation for remotely located demands. The objective is to empower greater 
contribution of off-grid or distributed generation in the country, and to pave the way for the 
structured phasing in of more GT equipment for consumers.
In the next five years, smart grid systems for the electricity industry will be implemented in 
phases, starting with the introduction of smart meters. Smart meters will provide information 
on consumers’ electricity consumption with real time pricing and assist consumers in 
managing their own electricity usage. This will in turn minimise electricity costs. As for 
the utility company, smart meters and smart grid allow for faster outage detection and 
isolation before they turn into large scale blackouts. These new technologies will also 
ensure faster restoration of services strategically after an emergency, e.g. to hospitals. As 
a result, there will be less disruption to customers.
2.5.2.5 Tailored Communication Strategy to All Target Audience
Closer collaboration between various Government agencies (i.e. KeTTHA, the Ministry of 
Education and the Ministry of Domestic Trade, Co-operatives and Consumerism) and the 
private sector will be enhanced in designing promotion and awareness programmes. The 
enhancement will focus on adopting language and logic that is easily understood by the 
respective target audience from all walks of life. For instance, businesses will be educated 
with the life cycle cost concepts instead of the lowest cost concepts. 
Yayasan Hijau (under KETTHA) has been entrusted to actively engage various groups and 
communication to promote and create awareness on green technology on continuous 
basis.

2.6 Targets
In summary, for Energy Sector, GTMP focuses on two (2) key subsectors - RE and EE. In 
both these subsectors, significant effort is needed to achieve the desired 2030 target of 
30% and 15% for RE and EE respectively. 
The key initiatives identified would enable the jump of 11.6% and 13.5% for RE and EE 
respectively. Continuing the momentum of current initiatives together with developing new 
ones would make these bold targets achievable.

3.1 Introduction 
The manufacturing sector is a major growth driver of Malaysia’s economy. In RMK-11, 
the manufacturing sector is expected to grow at 5.1% per annum, contributing 22.1% to 
GDP and 18.2% of the total employment by 2020. It contributed about RM232.9 billion or 
23% of GDP in 2014, making it the second largest contributor after the services sector. 
The GDP growth in 2014 at constant 2010 prices by five (5) main sectors are as shown in 
Figure 3.1.
The growth of the sector was contributed largely by the electrical and electronic (E&E) 
and chemical sub-sectors. The E&E sub-sector contributed an increase from RM44.2 
billion in 2011 to RM53.8 billion in 2015 via new applications for semi-conductors. The 
chemicals sub-sectors recorded an average growth of 3.4% per annum with an increase 
in value added from RM24.8 billion in 2011 to RM27.8 billion in 2015 due to growing 
demands from the automotive, E&E and pharmaceutical and construction industries. 
Anticipating the growth of the manufacturing sector, the country’s environmental concern 
in manufacturing needs to be mitigated via efficient use of energy and resources as well 
as minimising generation of waste. These mitigation measures form the core initiatives of 
the 'Green Manufacturing' concept. 
As depicted in Figure 3.2 on the electricity consumption pattern by different sectors of the 
economy, the Malaysian industrial sector consumes around 45% of electricity generated. 
Since the Tenth Malaysia Plan period starting in 2011, the Government has been 
intensifying efforts to reduce GHG emissions from the manufacturing sector, by promoting 
efficient use of energy, encouraging green processes and utilisation of green products and 
services. Despite these efforts, the industrial processes in the manufacturing sector have 
recorded a 46% increase in GHG emissions between 2000 and 2011 as reported in the 
Malaysia 2016 Biennial Update Report (BUR).

Manufacturing | 53 
A report on Green Manufacturing by the Boston Consulting Group in 2011 identifies 
transformation towards green manufacturing entails the executions of the following 
initiatives:
•	
Utilisation of green energy;
•	
Developing and production of green products; and
•	
Deployment of green processes in manufacturing activity.
It should be noted that Green Technology (GT) is the common denominator across all the 
three areas of green energy, green products and green processes. Manufacturers can 
adopt green technologies in their business strategy in two different ways – building a 
new green business, and using technology to “green” an existing one. Energy intensive 
manufacturing industries can embark on alternative technology that is more energy 
efficient such as cogeneration to help reduce their energy intensity. 
Companies adopting green manufacturing benefit through long term cost savings, brand 
enhancement with customers and higher investor interest. However, these benefits require 
a long-term commitment and making trade-offs against short term objectives. Therefore, 
successful implementation requires adoption of an integrated framework comprising of: 
•	
Planning for green as a core part of business strategy;
•	
Executing green initiatives across the value chain by shifting towards green energy, 
green products and green processes; and 
•	
Communicating and promoting green initiatives and their benefits to all stakeholders.

3.2 Current Landscape 
According to the 2011 Economic census, there were 645,136 SMEs, representing 97.3% 
of total business establishments. Out of these, 90.1% of SMEs are in the services sector, 
with 5.9% in manufacturing, 3% in construction and the rest in agriculture, mining, and 
quarrying. 
The manufacturing sector is dominated by SMEs representing 95% of all establishments 
while large enterprises constitute the remaining 5%. As of 2015, there are approximately 
3,400 green manufacturing SMEs in Malaysia. Collectively, the Government aspires to 
double the numbers of green manufacturing SMEs by 2030. 
With respect to green products, the paint and cement industries for instance have 
been certifying their products under SIRIM's Eco-label Scheme. Electrical appliances 
manufacturers have also introduced a range of energy efficient products that qualify 
for the energy star labelling from the Energy Commission. The National Water Services 
Commission (SPAN) has also come out with their own labels for water related equipment. 
Up to 2015, 73 eco-labels licenses were issued to companies producing green products.
Green manufacturing based on green energy utilisation is already widespread. More than 
1000 Energy Managers have been certified under the ASEAN Energy Management Scheme 
(AEMAS) in the last 5 years which also qualify them to register under the Registered 
Electrical Energy Manager Scheme administered by ST. 
Green process adoption in manufacturing is well underway but its widespread uptake is 
unsatisfactory. So far only 500 companies registered under FMM have been certified with 
the prestigious ISO 14001 environmental certifications.  
3.3 Issues and Challenges 
Overall the adoption of green manufacturing practices is still very low in the manufacturing 
sector. To aid implementation, manufacturers can focus on three areas:
Figure 3.3: Number of companies in the manufacturing sector, 2011


Manufacturing | 55 
•	
Green Energy
 
Green energy involves production of cleaner energy. Green energy includes both 
deploying of renewable energy sources and achieving higher energy efficiency in 
operations. 
•	
Green Products
 
Developing greener products with lower carbon footprint can often mean higher 
costs. However, by developing Green products with eco-labels that are sought 
by consumers, companies can derive additional volumes and price premiums. 
 
•	
Green Processes in Business Operations
 
Implementing green processes in operations entails efficient use of key resource, 
reduce waste generation, reducing carbon and water footprint. Green processes 
therefore improve operational efficiency and lower costs. 
A number of green manufacturing initiatives have been launched for the manufacturing 
sector as highlighted earlier. However, there is a need to further increase awareness to 
manufacturers in terms of the importance and benefits arising from the green initiatives. 
For example, increasing consumer concerns for sustainability and the depletion of natural 
resources such as oil are the top issues for the automotive industry. In comparison, water 
shortage, population growth and environmental pollution can be a top issue for the food 
production industry.
This means that manufacturing companies need to first understand the concerns of their 
respective industries and then develop specific green strategies to address them in their 
respective industries. 
Therefore, adoption of green manufacturing requires Malaysian manufacturers to embark 
on a transition from:
•	
Approaching green as limited, often isolated initiatives with narrow focus to a more 
holistic approach;
•	
Meeting regulatory compliance to developing eco-advantage; and
•	
Viewing initiatives as cost centres to assessing them as business opportunities.
To assist green manufacturing transformation, Malaysian manufacturers need assistance 
to address the following impediments:
•	
Manufacturers need to fully understand drivers and issues relevant to them and their 
industries, and what sustainability means to their business;
•	
Manufacturers face difficulties in modelling the business case – or even finding a 
compelling case – for sustainability; and
•	
Manufacturers need to adopt green initiatives into their core business and integrated 
as corporate strategy in order to realise its full benefits.


56 | Green Technology Master Plan 
3.4 Existing Initiatives 
Various initiatives have been implemented in the manufacturing sector to aid green 
manufacturing adoption. These initiatives can be classified based on the green 
manufacturing initiative classifications as follows: 
Green Energy 
•	
Efficient Management of Energy Efficiency Regulation 2008 (EMEER);
•	
Industrial Energy Efficiency for Malaysian Manufacturing Sector (IEEMS);
•	
Energy Audit Grant for Industrial sector (Energy Efficiency program under 11th 
Malaysia Plan);
•	
Energy Management Gold Standard (EMGS); and
•	
ASEAN Energy Management Scheme (AEMAS).
Green Products
•	
Environmental Declaration Scheme for Construction and Building Materials;
•	
Malaysia Energy Efficiency and Solar Thermal Application (MAEESTA) Project; and
•	
MyHIJAU SME & Entrepreneur Development Programme and other green certification 
schemes.
Green Processes
•	
ISO 14001 Certification
3.4.1 ISO 14001 Certification of Manufacturers
ISO 14001 is an international standard focused on environmental management system 
for organisations. It is designed to introduce environmental improvement on the entire 
organisation's operation and requires organisations to incorporate environmental issues 
into their corporate decision-making process. 
As such, ISO 14001 certified organisations' will benefit through improvement in 
environmental performance, minimisation of waste, conservation of energy and water, 
enhancement of corporate image, reduction in environmental risks and incidents and 
compliance to legislation. 
Companies with ISO 14001 certification are therefore, capable to reduce the negative 
impact of their activities on the environment via adherence to a prescribed environmental 
management system framework, which leads towards a sound environmental management.
 
A survey on ISO 14001 certified manufacturers registered with FMM in 2013 shows that 
manufacturers with certification were able to reduce the negative impact of their activities 
on the environment because of their strong environmental management ability. These 
manufacturing organisations are also capable of implementing environmental management 
accounting practices as part of their business operations. There are more than 500 ISO 
14001 certified companies involving SMEs and big enterprises that are registered with 
FMM up to 2017. 


Manufacturing | 57 
3.4.2 Efficient Management of Electrical Energy Regulations (EMEER) 2008 
The Government gazetted EMEER in 2008 to regulate big energy users. The main objective 
is to improve energy management practices particularly big manufacturers or industries 
whose total electrical consumption, equals to or exceeds 3,000,000 kWh as measured at 
one metering point or more over any period of six consecutive months. These industries 
need to appoint Electrical Energy Manager to monitor the energy consumption and 
prepare report to Energy Commission (ST) on the energy efficiency measures undertaken 
on periodic basis. 
Effective 2018 the management of EMEER 2008 will be made more effective via the 
integration of an energy database tracking and reporting system linking the Energy 
Commission, the Registered Electrical Manager and end user facility under a common 
reporting platform known as the Energy Management Information System (EMIS). With 
EMIS integration, the EC will have better control in enforcing EMEER 2008 across the 
regulated end-users. 
3.4.3 Industrial Energy Efficiency for Malaysian Manufacturing Sector (IEEMMS)
The recently concluded IEEMS project (2011-2017) was implemented by UNIDO and 
executed by the Ministry of International Trade and Industry (MITI) and SME Corporation 
Malaysia. 
The project has delivered its objective to promote energy efficiency improvements in the 
manufacturing sector, through the implementation of:
•	
National Energy Management Standard;
•	
Application of System Optimisation (SO) for large and SME industries in Malaysia 
based on the ISO 50001; 
•	
Enhancement of national EE regulatory framework; and 
•	
Widespread awareness of the benefits of EE amongst SMEs and larger industries, 
 
The project has benefitted more than 2,000 organisations in Malaysia from various 
industries through extensive capacity building and involvement of industries. It has also 
benefitted collective involvement of the industrial decision-makers (managers), engineers, 
vendors as well as the Government ministries and agencies, its related subsidiaries and 
private organisations.
The project has resulted in energy savings of 4,865 GWh and GHG reduction of 
approximately 3.4 million tCO2 derived from 69 companies. The annual cost reduction 
from energy saving was estimated at RM73.65 million.
3.4.4 Environmental Declaration Scheme for Construction and Building Materials
This SWITCH-Asia project (2012-2015) promoted sustainable consumption and production 
for the construction and 


58 | Green Technology Master Plan 
building materials. The project was led by SIRIM in collaboration with Carbon Trust UK, 
Federation of Malaysian Manufacturers (FMM), Malaysian Green Building Confederation 
(MGBC) and Building Materials Distributors Association of Malaysia (BMDAM).
Overall, the objective of the project is to drive continuous improvements in the sustainable 
production, manufacture and use of materials for the construction and building sector 
within Malaysia and its export markets. The key results of the project were:
•	
Increased adoption of international best practice and technology by businesses in the 
Malaysian construction industry;
•	
Support and encourage the procurement of sustainable products;
•	
Implementation of a certification and labelling scheme that meets the needs of the 
local and international business stakeholders; and
•	
Continued improvement in the environmental performance of construction and 
building materials produced in Malaysia.
3.4.5 Energy Audit Grant for Industrial sector (Energy Efficiency program under 11th 
Malaysia Plan) 
The energy audit program (2016-2018) provides conditional energy audit grant for large 
industrial players in Malaysia. It is jointly executed by KeTTHA and ST with the aim 
to manage and reduce energy consumption in large industries while MGTC has been 
appointed as implementing agency. All industries including those categorised under the 
Efficient Management of Electrical Energy Regulation (EMEER 2008) by ST, are eligible to 
apply.   
The objectives of the programme are:
1.	 To create awareness on the importance of implementing energy audits to understand 
how and where the energy is being used, to explore on how to manage it and identify 
the energy savings potential;
2.	 To provide financing assistance to the eligible applicants through grant, as a catalyst 
for the implementation of energy audit, so that current energy consumption pattern, 
baseline and energy savings potential can be identified;
3.	 To attract financial institutions to provide financing mechanism for energy efficiency 
projects through energy performance mechanism, to reduce financial burden to the 
applicants; and
4.	 To develop capacity building in energy services industry.
It is expected the project will catalyse industries to be more energy efficient in their 
operations
3.4.6 Energy Management Gold Standard (EMGS) 
The EMGS certification system certifies organisations' Energy Management System 
besides being in compliance with ISO 50001.


Manufacturing | 59 
The objective of this program is to encourage companies or organisations to practice 
energy management best practices by managing the energy consumption and ensure the 
energy is used in efficient and sustainable manner. 
The program is executed by MGTC which has been appointed by the ASEAN Centre for 
Energy (ACE) as certification body for Malaysia. 
3.4.7 MyHIJAU SME and Entrepreneur Development Programme
KeTTHA and MGTC to encourage the growth of local SMEs to adopt green practices 
and produce local green products and services. It supports the Government initiative 
and direction in the development of SMEs in accordance with the National SME Master 
Plan (2012-2020). This programme incorporates capacity-building, training and coaching 
to enable SMEs to obtain green label verification for their products, services and green 
practices in their operations.
The MyHjiau SME and Entrepreneur Development Programme partners with 14 prominent 
green certification or verification bodies in Malaysia. Among the partners are SIRIM Berhad, 
Energy Commission, National Water Services Commission, Malaysian Timber Certification 
Council, Green Building Index and Malaysian Palm Oil Berhad. The products and services 
accredited by these partners are eligible to register for MyHIJAU Mark. 
Moving forward the MyHIJAU SME & Entrepreneur Development Programme will focus 
towards green growth and sustainable activities. SMEs and entrepreneurs will be educated 
on the Government incentives available. Leveraging on collaboration with other entities 
such as the Malaysian Global Innovation and Creativity Centre (MAGIC) and Companies 
Commission of Malaysia, this programme will address the challenges faced by SMEs via:
•	
Business clinics and advisory sessions with industry leaders; 
•	
Baseline assessment activities to identify areas for improvement considering various 
elements, such as transport and logistics, energy efficiency, material use, life-cycle 
cost and business cost needs;
•	
Strategising actions plans and implementation plans for SMEs to balance adopting 
green practices and meeting their unique business goals; and
•	
Engaging big corporations to embark on greening supply chains and green procurement 
which in-turn will entice many thousands of SMEs to go green.

The programme is also complementing the Government Green Procurement (GGP) 
initiative. It builds the capacity of SMEs to supply green products and services to 
Government Ministries and agencies.
3.4.8 Training Related to Energy Management for Industrial Sector 
3.4.8.1 ASEAN Energy Manager Accreditation Scheme (AEMAS) training course
The AEMAS training course is one of the initiatives under human resource development 
programme to build capacity on energy management. This training course is recognised 
by Energy Commission to produce Registered Electrical Energy Managers (REEM). Energy 
managers are in demand due to the requirement of EMEER 2008 in which high electrical 
energy users need to engage energy managers to develop and monitor an EE management 
plan for the facility.
The AEMAS training aims to provide knowledge and skills to implement the Sustainable 
Energy Management System that complies to the requirements of ISO 50001 to all energy 
managers and produce certified energy managers.

3.4.8.2 Certified Professional in Measurement and Verification (CPMV)
CPMV is another training programme to certify practitioners on measurement and 
verification competency skill. Those practitioners are able to verify savings on energy 
efficiency programmes by the organisations.
3.5 Way Forward 
With increasing global focus on GT, manufacturers should aim for adoption of green 
manufacturing best practices and technologies. The critical need is to create widespread 
awareness and adoption of Green Manufacturing practices amongst key growth industries. 
Incentives, regulatory enforcements and strong political will are essential for success and 
would be developed according to the following priorities:
•	
Utilisation of green energy;
•	
Development and production of green products; and
•	
Deployment of green processes in manufacturing activity.
A life-cycle approach will integrate pre-production, production and disposal phases in the 
product life-cycle. To succeed in Green manufacturing, Malaysian manufacturers need 
assistance to address the following decision-making impediments:
•	
Lack of understanding on the environmental drivers and issues relevant to their 
industries, and what sustainability means to their business
•	
Difficulties in modelling the business case for sustainability; and
•	
Lack of awareness on on the implication of adopting green initiatives into their core 
business and integrating a corporate strategy in order to realise its full benefits.
Creating widespread awareness on green manufacturing also requires manufacturers to 
be made aware of the implementation framework which involve:
•	
Planning 
 
Green initiatives need to be factored into business strategy, future resource planning 
and budgeting exercises.
•	
Execution 
 
Based on robust planning in place and targets clearly defined and monitored, green 
initiatives need to be integrated across the value chain and as a part of core business 
as follows:
Green energy: Manufacturers with high energy consumption need to shift towards 
cleaner energy and plan for efficiency improvements. 


62 | Green Technology Master Plan 
	Green products: Manufacturers to conduct evaluation of products parameters based 
on:
	
-	
How green are the resources and energy being used;
	
-	
How green is the product during the lifecycle of its use; and
	
-	
How green is the manufacturing process.
	Green processes in business operations; Manufacturers need to gradually redesign 
business processes used in different parts of the value chain. This could include 
shifting to more sustainable manufacturing options, making changes towards reducing 
waste, increasing recycling, reusing resources and incentivising suppliers, channels, 
customers and employees to adopt a common path. 
A well formulated promotion campaign and advisory programmes on the implementation 
framework involving planning and execution of these initiatives will be necessary across 
the big enterprises and the SMEs in Malaysia. 
3.5.1 Future Drivers to Improve Energy Utilisation 
3.5.1.1 Enhanced Time of Use tariff (EToU)
By 2020, the EToU will be implemented to replace the Special Incentive Tariff (SIT). Under 
the SIT scheme, companies with higher electricity usage have benefitted from higher 
discounts. The total cumulative discounts given from 1997 to 2013 under the SIT were 
RM5.2 billion. The abolishment of the SIT will encourage electricity-intensive industries to 
implement EE measures and subsequently reduce their operational energy intensity.
A comprehensive awareness programme on the impacts of EToU will be launched to 
prepare the industry players in planning to mitigate these impacts, especially those who 
are particularly sensitive to energy costs. It encourages consumers to use electricity more 
efficiently by reducing their electricity consumption during peak hours and having more 
utilisation during off peak hours. The EToU programme will enable electricity consumers 
to better manage their electrical energy consumption and to explore a different approach 
in energy cost savings measures. 
The new EToU will have three-time zones, which are off-peak, mid-peak and peak. EToU is 
an option for low and medium voltage commercial users as well as high voltage industrial 
users. The scheme aims to improve efficiency in load management as well as minimising 
operational costs of business, ultimately reducing generation cost. In future, the EToU 
tariff will be extended to domestic users.
3.5.1.2 Information Sharing on Industry Energy-Use Benchmark 
Current energy users affected by the EMEER 2008, will soon be assisted in their reporting 
requirements with an Energy Management Information System (EMIS) currently being 
implemented under assistance by the UNDP GEF Building Sector Energy Efficiency 
Programme. The EMIS has the capability to generate data analytics that will be helpful for 
benchmarking by electricity users.


Manufacturing | 63 
Manufacturers will be able to compare their performance against the industry benchmark 
anonymously and this could provide an impetus to reduce energy consumption. 
3.5.1.3 Targeted Programmes to Advocate Green Industrial Processes
The existing MyHIJAU SME and Entrepreneur Development Programme will be further 
leveraged to include awareness and training on green manufacturing implementation 
framework and provide the readiness for manufacturers to embark on green initiatives. 
MyHIJAU SME and Entrepreneur Development Programme will also intensify effort to 
encourage more manufacturers to embark on ISO14001 certifications and compliance 
to global environmental management standard. Companies with ISO 14001 certification 
are able to produce continual reduction in the negative impact of their activities on the 
environment via adherence to a prescribed environmental management system framework.
3.5.1.4 Cogeneration
Cogeneration is a system of commercially available technologies that decrease total fuel 
consumption and related GHG emissions by generating both electricity and useful heat 
from the same fuel input. Cogeneration is often called combined heat and power (CHP), 
since most cogeneration systems are used to supply electricity and useful heat. 
However, the heat energy from electricity production can also be used for cooling and 
other non-heating purposes, so the term “cogeneration” is more inclusive. Cogeneration 
is a form of local or distributed generation as heat and power production take place at or 
near the point of consumption. For the same output of useful energy, cogeneration uses 
far less fuel than do traditional separate heat and power production, which means lower 
greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions as fossil fuel use is reduced. 
The typical method of separate centralised electricity generation and on-site heat 
generation has a combined efficiency of about 45% whereas cogeneration systems 
can reach efficiency levels of 80 percent. Therefore, with cogeneration installation, 
manufacturers may be able to reduce their energy intensity by as much as 40%. 
Up to 2017, there are approximately 1,070 MW of cogeneration plant installations scattered 
throughout the Peninsular Malaysia. These cogeneration plants are either gas, EFB/Diesel, 
industrial heat/waste and agriculture waste fired plants. Gas based cogeneration plants 
constitute the largest share with capacity of 900 MW and with installations scattered 
throughout the Peninsular Malaysia at location with easy access to natural gas supplies. 


64 | Green Technology Master Plan 
3.6 Targets
The Government aspire to achieve 17,000 of green manufacturing by 2030 and will 
continue to support the sector to embark on green manufacturing via multiple initiatives. 
This is to ensure manufacturers will be equipped with the right tool to meet their varying 
business requirements.  
Under the classifications of green manufacturing; manufacturers can now decide and 
prioritise their initiatives according to green energy, green products and green processes 
based on their level of business readiness.
Under this arrangement, manufacturers normally will embark the transformation to green 
manufacturing in phases. The first phase may involve green energy initiatives, followed by 
green products and finally a full migration involving green processes.

4.1 Introduction 
Transportation systems form the backbone of social growth and economic expansion of 
any country. They play a vital role in linking various regions and enabling fast and efficient 
movement of goods, services and people. One of the strategies outlined in RMK-11 is 
to encourage low carbon mobility through the utilisation of energy efficient vehicles and 
public transportation. To achieve this, it is vital that Malaysia aligns its policies, strategies 
and technologies to drive GT growth in the transport sector.
4.2 Current Landscape
Economic as well as population growth are the two major factors contributing towards the 
high rates of motorisation in Malaysia:
•	
The number of registered private motorcycles and cars has increased from 4.7 million 
in 1990 to 25.7 million in 2016;
•	
In 2016 there were 578,274 and 464,857 newly registered cars and motorcycles 
respectively; and 
•	
The number of vehicles is projected to reach 7 million in the Klang Valley (KV) by 2020.
 
Rapid urbanisation, accompanied by a rise in the number of vehicles on the road has 
contributed to the increase in energy consumption, carbon emissions as well as traffic 
congestion problem. Malaysia, as noted in the RMK-11 has put into place strategies that 
leverage on existing initiatives and makes room for the adoption of new approaches and 
measures in the transport sector. 
4.3 Issues and Challenges 
According to the National Energy Balance 2013, transport sector consumed the highest 
amount of energy at about 43.3% (about 22,357 ktoe) in 2013 compared to 37.0% 
(about 17,728 ktoe) in 1993. The increasing energy consumption has led to a staggering 
increase in carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions, as much as 184.9% over the last 40 years. 
Malaysia is ranked third after Indonesia and Philippines in terms of CO2 emission from the 
transport sector in ASEAN countries. In 2016, out of the total carbon emissions from the 
land transport sector, 71% originated from cars and 9% from motorcycles. Hence, fuel 
efficiency and carbon emission levels for individual vehicles will have a significant impact 
on the environment. In order to mitigate the transport sector's emission and to keep the 
sector environmentally friendly, the adoptions of a sustainable and green transportation 
system will have to be made a priority. 
A major challenge for the transport sector in Malaysia is governance. Various reform 
initiatives have been undertaken to streamline and strengthen the institutional structure 
and governance of the transport sector. These among others include the establishment of 
Land Public Transport Commission (Suruhanjaya Pengangkutan Awam Darat - SPAD) and 
Malaysian Aviation Commission in 2015. In addition, plans are underway to corporatise 
the Civil Aviation Department. Despite these various efforts, there are remaining gaps 
in the governance structure especially in addressing the energy consumption and GHG 
emission from the transport sector. In order to address the environmental impact of the 
transport sector, there is a need for a holistic approach from all stakeholders to ensure the 
sector becomes sustainable. 


Transport | 69 
4.4 Existing Initiatives
4.4.1 Transport Policies 
4.4.1.1 National Land Public Transport Master Plan (NLPTMP) 
The NLPTMP was launched by the Land Public Transport Commission (SPAD) in 2012. 
The NLPTMP provides a high level timeline to guide the transformation in the public 
transportation service up to the year 2020. The NLPTMP aims to improve the land public 
transportation system in relation to the increase in population, and the demand for 
accessibility, quality and safety of public transportation. It focuses on urban rail (i.e. MRT, 
LRT and Monorail), bus and other supporting infrastructure (i.e. Bus Rapid Transit, Park ‘n’ 
Ride bays, etc.), covering five (5) main focus areas of improvement:
•	
Connectivity;
•	
Accessibility and affordability;
•	
Service quality and convenience;
•	
Safety and security; and
•	
Environmental impact.
The five focus areas of improvement will be supported by:
•	
Continuous financial support by the Federal Government;
•	
Development of Regional Land Public Transport Master Plans (RLPTMPs);
•	
Improving reliability of land public transport sector; and
•	
Transit-Oriented Development (TOD) to improve accessibility and affordability.
Other supporting programmes being implemented under NLPTMP include:
•	
The Commuter Bus Improvement Plan (CBIP); and
•	
The stage bus services transformation programmes. 
In order to promote the private-to-public transport modal shift, improvements on the 
public transportation facilities are necessary. An additional 470 new buses were provided 
for Rapid KL, Rapid Kuantan, and Rapid Penang. This led to a significant increase in 
passenger ridership from 10.7 million in 2012 to 17.9 million in 2014.
As of 2013, public transport in the Greater KL/Klang Valley (GKL/KV) region accounted for 
only 20.8% of the total transport modal share. In the GKL/KV area, there are currently two 
(2) operating Light Rail Transit (LRT) lines, Mass Rapid Transit (MRT) line and Monorail, 
as well as a network of public and feeder bus routes. For the LRT, the Kelana Jaya Line 
and the Ampang Line have achieved 78.7 million and 60.2 million commuters respectively 
in the year 2013. This is equivalent to taking 109,660 passenger vehicles off the road, 
therefore achieving a net emission reduction of 214.93 ktCO2eq in 2013. Extension of 
the LRT lines from Kelana Jaya station and Sri Petaling station has also been completed 
with an integrated station at Putra Heights Terminal. For monorail, capacity expansion 
was done by upgrading of 2-coach to 4-coach trains. For KTM Komuter, the service was 
expanded in 2015 with the introduction of the Northern and Southern Sectors. Finally, the 
commencement of Sungai-Buloh-Kajang MRT in 2017 is expected to boost the integration 
and efficiency of urban public transport in the GKL/KV area. 
 


70 | Green Technology Master Plan 
The track length, number of stations and average ridership of the urban rail in GKL/KV 
area for the year 2016 are shown in Table 4.1. The modal shift from private to public land 
transportation (i.e. urban rail and bus) is targeted at 40% public transport modal share for 
GKL/KV areas and 20% for other cities by 2020. A long-term target of 40% for all urban 
areas is set by 2030. Annual ridership on urban rail public transportation (i.e. LRT, MRT, 
Monorail) is targeted to increase by 355% of 2013 levels in 2020, contributing to about 
977.5 ktCO2eq emission reduction.
4.4.1.2 Mega Public Transportation Infrastructure Projects
The Government has implemented several mega public transportation infrastructure 
projects, especially the urban rail system, to encourage modal shift from private to public 
transportation and to improve connectivity. Some of the key developments are listed in 
Table 4.2.

The LRT 3 project is set to begin operations in August 2020, covering 37 km with 26 
planned stations. The project design will incorporate rainwater harvesting technology, 
a noise reduction system, a better energy management system and natural ventilation 
system. The project expects to attain a daily ridership of 74,000. The LRT 3 project will 
connect Bandar Utama and Johan Setia (Klang) to extend connectivity to the Western 
Corridor of GKL/KV. A feeder bus system will be put in place to facilitate the First and 
Last Mile initiative that will cover 3 km from a station, with a maximum travel time of 30 
minutes. Furthermore, the High Speed Rail (HSR) project that connects Kuala Lumpur and 
Singapore is expected to provide an efficient alternative mode of transport for the public 
to travel between the two metropolis as well as the five other cities along the proposed 
route. 
For bus transportation, Go KL, a free bus service in the Kuala Lumpur Central Business 
District area was introduced to offer a viable and economical alternative for commuters 
to travel within the area. The existing bus network has been revamped, where current 
bus corridors were reorganised into smaller corridors based on the main trunk roads 
connecting Kuala Lumpur’s city centre. In addition, Performance Monitoring Hub System 
(PMHS) has been implemented to improve public transportation’s reliability, journey time, 
comfort, convenience, accessibility and connectivity by monitoring and tracking the public 
transport performances beginning with stage bus routes in the GKL/KV.
The automated approach allows SPAD to have real time information for measurement, 
planning, as well as to assist investigation and implementation of corrective and 
improvement actions. Besides that, the stage bus service transformation, myBAS, has 
been rolled out in several key cities in Malaysia, namely Seremban, Ipoh and Kangar. 
myBAS is designed to help in sustaining stage bus service to ensure connectivity and 
at the same time provide scheduled trips for local commuters across Malaysia to travel 
around. 
The effective modes of public transport such as the Sunway Bus Rapid Transit (BRT) 
system has also been implemented, as Transit Oriented Development (TOD) project 
involving public-private collaboration between the Government and Sunway Group. The 
elevated system combines the light rail transit system with the usage of dedicated bus 
lanes serving Bandar Sunway and Subang Jaya, and is aimed to provide a solution to ease 
the traffic congestion in the area. The alignment is from the intra-city rail station Setia Jaya 
to Kelana Jaya LRT Line Extension Station in USJ6, connecting seven stations with one 
Park-n-Ride facility with universal access features.

4.4.1.3 National Automotive Policy (NAP)
National Automotive Policy (NAP) was introduced in 2006 with the objective of transforming 
the domestic automotive industry and integrating it into the increasingly competitive 
regional and global industry network. The first revision of NAP was done in 2009 to 
enhance the capability and competitiveness of the automotive industry in Malaysia. The 
latest revision, NAP 2014 was made to address the need for carbon emission reduction 
and the promotion of Energy Efficient Vehicles (EEV) and to position Malaysia as ASEAN 
EEV hub by 2020. 
Under the NAP 2014, EEV is defined as vehicles that meet a set of define specifications in 
terms of carbon emission level (gram/kilometre - g/km) and fuel consumption (l/100km). 
EEV includes fuel-efficient vehicles, hybrid, electric vehicles (EV) and alternatively fuelled 
vehicles e.g. Compressed Natural Gas (CNG), Liquefied Petroleum Gas (LPG), biodiesel, 
ethanol, hydrogen and fuel cell.
In 2013, there were 16,944 units of hybrid vehicles (based on data from JPJ) on the road. 
The share of EEV by total industry volume has quadrupled from 8.1% (2014) to 32.6% 
(2015) and 42.8% (2016). It is targeted that 85% of vehicles produced in Malaysia will 
be EEVs by 2020.The targeted outcome for carbon emission reduction for EEVs is set at 
199.7 ktCO2eq by 20202.
4.4.1.4 National Biofuel Policy (NBP)
The NBP was introduced in 2006 to supplement part of the energy demand for transport 
sector using biodiesel as a source of alternative fuel. The main alternative fuel used in 
Malaysia is palm-based biodiesel, which is a blend of Palm Methyl Ester (PME) and 
petroleum diesel. PME is produced from the transesterification process of Crude Palm 
Oil (CPO) which has a 96% yield factor. Malaysia has implemented biodiesel blending 
programmes of 5% (B5) and 7% (B7) PME thus far.
NAP 2014 is viewed as an enabler to nurture the local automotive industry and it is 
formulated based on three (3) main directions:
 
•	
Investment;
•	
Technology and engineering; and 
•	
Market expansion.
NAP also emphasises on three (3) main strategies:
•	
Supply chain development; 
•	
Human capital development; and 
•	
Safety, security and environment.
2 Malaysia Biennial Update Report (BUR), 2016


Transport | 73 
In 2013, palm-based biodiesel displaced 230,000 tonnes of petroleum diesel, resulting 
in a carbon reduction of 719.7 ktCO2eq. The current biodiesel blending programme is 
the B7 which has been implemented since December 2014. In 2015, 382,000 tonnes of 
petroleum diesel in the transport sector was displaced by PME, contributing to about 
1,195.3 ktCO2eq. The total petroleum diesel displaced by PME from 2011-2015 for both 
B5 and B7 biodiesel blends is 965,982 tonnes. The upcoming target for the Government 
is to implement the B10 and B15. Nevertheless, based on the feedback from MPIC, it is 
expected that B7 programme will remain until 2030.
4.4.1.5 National Logistics and Trade Facilitation Master Plan 2015-2020
Apart from the public and private transportation, some improvements in the freight sector 
has also been set in place via the National Logistics and Trade Facilitation Master Plan 
2015-2020. Under this masterplan, five main strategic shifts have been recommended:
1.	
Strengthening the institutional and regulatory framework;
2.	
Enhancing trade facilitation mechanism;
3.	
Developing infrastructure and freight demand;
4.	
Strengthening technology and human capital; and
5.	
Internationalising logistic services.
Various action items and recommendations were proposed under each strategic shifts to 
improve the freight transport system in Malaysia including greening the logistic ecosystem 
under the strategic shifts 2, 3 and 4. Some of the proposed action items include creating 
integrated hub and spoke model to improve logistic efficiency, establishing national freight 
data program, promote efficient urban logistics, undertake R&D in supply chain innovation 
and etc. Under the strategic shift 4, it is recommended for the Government to provide 
green initiative support, including incentives to encourage adoption of green practices and 
green supply chain initiatives.
4.4.1.6 Cleaner Fuel and Improved Fuel Standard 
The existing fuel standard is EURO 4M for RON 97 petrol. EURO 4M standards for RON 
97 replaced EURO 2M standards to introduce fuel with lower sulphur content, in turn 
decreasing the sulphur dioxide output into the atmosphere. The EURO 4M standards also 
enable the fuel to be less prone to evaporation with better vapour pressure. In addition 
to lower sulphur content and less vaporisation of fuel, EURO 4M also introduces lower 
benzene content from 5% (EURO 2M) to 3.5%. The targeted timeline for the introduction 
of higher EURO standard fuel is as in Figure 4.1.

Improved fuel standard (EURO standard) will directly improve the emission level. The 
implementation however will need to be in phases for the vehicle engine specification to 
be in line with the new fuel standard.
Biodiesel offers as a cleaner option to diesel and thus its utilisation as means to reduce 
GHGs emission in the transport sector is timely.    
Compressed Natural Gas (CNG) is another form of alternative fuel available in the market. 
It is made by compressing natural gas (mainly methane, CH4) to less than 1% of the 
volume it occupies at standard atmospheric pressure. CNG has a higher fuel-to-energy 
conversion rate than basic petroleum diesel. The use of CNG by vehicles in Malaysia 
started in the late 1990s and was limited predominantly to taxis and a number of bus fleets 
in specific areas in Peninsular Malaysia. A total of 839 Natural Gas Vehicles (NGVs), which 
use CNG, have been registered from 2011 to 2015. 
However, the consumption of CNG in Malaysia has dropped from 2013 to 2015 based 
on the data from National Energy Balance. Nevertheless, RMK-11 has highlighted the 
encouragement of NGV as part of eco mobility.

4.4.1.7 Green Initiative Programmes by Public Transport Operators
In line with the Government’s aspiration to go green and reduce carbon emission, the 
public transport operators have conducted several green initiative programs. For example, 
Express Rail Link Sdn Bhd (ERL) has embarked on the Go Lo-CO2 program (a campaign to 
raise public awareness on reducing carbon emissions) which is estimated to save 44,800 
ktCO2eq each year when the commuters choose to travel by KLIA express. Meanwhile, 
MyRapid has launched the Bike N Ride programme, where travellers who cycle and wish 
to take their bikes with them are welcome to board the trains during off-peak hour, without 
any additional fare charges. However, the riders have to adhere to the guidelines provided 
to avoid discomfort to other commuters. 
4.4.1.8 Market and Technology Assessment
Malaysia Automotive Institute (MAI) collaborates with other institutions, local or foreign, 
to help industry stakeholders in market development. For technology development, MAI 
is in collaboration with Excellerate Australia (formerly known as AutoCRC) to conduct a 
research known as Market Intelligence and Technology Assessment 2030 (MITA2030). The 
research will cover the critical roles of vehicle technologies, policies, regulations, standards 
and energy market in the success of clean vehicle technology in ASEAN and Australian 
marketplaces. This collaboration involves, among others, a quantitative behavioural 
econometrics research on consumer preferences in mobility particularly towards EEV 
technology. 
The 
outcome 
of 
this 
study 
will 
provide 
stakeholder 
groups 
with 
recommendations 
on 
relevant 
econometric outcomes with respect to EEV technologies. These recommendations will 
address the perspectives of the Government, industry, consumer and fleet management 
to support Malaysia’s EEV strategic vision.
4.4.1.9 Human Capital Development
In support of mainstreaming green technology in the automotive sector, several initiatives 
have been put in place to enhance human capital development. On the industrial front, 
MAI has been active in organising technical talks as platform for engaging automotive 
industry players to keep them updated on the industry’s direction matters especially on 
EEVs including EV. Furthermore, MAI also functions as the Industry Lead Body (ILB) for the 
training and development of human capital in the automotive industry. MAI is collaborating 
with Department of Skills Development (DSD) to develop the National Occupational Skill 
Standard (NOSS). 
Several research centres in the local universities have also been working on the transport 
GT research, such as the Proton Future Lab (UTM), UM Power Energy Dedicated Advanced 
Centre (UMPEDAC, UM), Malaysia Institute of Transport (UiTM) and Research Centre for 
Applied Electromagnetics (UTHM).

4.4.2 Transport Technology
4.4.2.1 Energy Efficient Vehicle (EEV)
In the National Automotive Policy (NAP) 2014, Malaysian Government has set EEV as the 
way forward for the national automotive industry. According to NAP 2014, EEV definition is 
applicable to any vehicle that fits the set of specifications in terms of carbon emission level 
and fuel consumption, and encompasses fuel-efficient vehicles, hybrid electric vehicles, 
full electric vehicles, alternative fuel vehicles etc. 
Driven by the EEV initiative, local car manufacturers Proton and Perodua have EEV models, 
such as Ertiga and Axia respectively. R&D&I on EEV should be continued to allow local 
automotive industry to move up the value chain in transport GT while positioning Malaysia 
as the local EEV hub. 
4.4.2.2 Electric Vehicle (EV) Technology
KeTTHA and GreenTech Malaysia has initiated the electric mobility effort. Apart from 
electric bus, the Government also supported private initiative EV car-sharing programme 
known as Cohesive Mobility Solution (COMOS), to provide rentable EV at selected 
locations in Klang Valley area.
Figure 4.2: Energy Efficient Vehicles


Transport | 77 
For personal transport, there are several types of EVs available in the Malaysian market, 
ranging from Hybrid Electric Vehicle (HEV, which runs on both fossil fuel and battery, 
without external charging function, such as Toyota Prius and Honda Jazz), Plug-in Hybrid 
Electric Vehicle (PHEV, which runs on both fossil fuel and battery while allowing the battery 
to be charged externally, such as BMW 330e), Battery Electric Vehicle (BEV, which runs 
solely on battery, such as Nissan Leaf and Tesla Roadster) are also in the market.
In terms of electric motorbikes, local company Eclimo Sdn Bhd has been developing 
electric scooter that can cater local as well as regional markets. Moreover, Eclimo has 
been working with the Research Centre for Applied Electromagnetics (UTHM) and UM 
Power Energy Dedicated Advanced Centre (UMPEDAC, UM) to develop electric drive train 
for its electric scooter, as a move to localise the EV technology.
One of the key drivers for the proliferation of EV is the availability of charging facilities 
which is critical in alleviating EV drivers’ range anxiety. In this aspect, GreenTech Malaysia, 
through its ChargEV initiative, has been rolling out charging stations throughout Malaysia, 
particularly in the Klang Valley region, with a target of having 25,000 charging stations by 
2020. Nevertheless, the charging station technology is still based on foreign technology.
It is worth noting that EVs will mainly obtain its source of energy from the electrical power 
grid. Hence, to effectively reduce carbon emission via EVs, the mix of renewable energy in 
electricity generation needs to be increased accordingly.  
 
4.4.2.3 Biofuel
Even though the car manufacturing industry has moved toward producing EEVs, most of 
these vehicles are still dependent on fossil based fuel. To further reduce the environmental 
impact of vehicles on the road, the Government has embarked on the implementation of 
biofuel and higher fuel standards.
n tandem with the policies set under the National Biofuel Policy, Malaysia has implemented 
the biodiesel blending programme in the transport sector. In terms of technology, although 
research of second-generation biofuel from palm biomass and biogas has been ongoing 
since 2002, product development has been hindered by lack of investment. The second-
generation biofuel from palm biomass and biogas production process needs to be 
implemented.
4.4.2.4 Human Capital Development
One of the crucial elements for the advancement of transport technology is the development 
of human capital. Currently, there are a number of technical colleges which provide 
transport related skill development, such as Malaysia Railway Academy and RapidKL 
Rail Academy. Courses on transport usually focus on logistic and planning rather than 
technology development. Master of Engineering in Transportation (UTM) and Master in 
Railway Engineering (UTHM) are a few higher degree courses which are technical oriented.

4.5 Way Forward
4.5.1 Transport Policies
4.5.1.1 Implementation of the National Land Public Transport Master Plan (NLPTMP)
According to the NLPTMP
, it is targeted that modal share for public transport in urban 
areas will reach 40% by 2030. Five strategic objectives have been identified on this target, 
i.e., physically well connected, affordable and accessible to all, convenient and offer high 
service levels and quality, safe and secure, and better quality of life.
The implementation of the NLPTMP will be monitored and review mechanisms will be put 
into place to ensure land public systems adopt green technologies and practices, which 
include:
•	
Land public transport vehicles to comply with existing emissions standards set by the 
Department of Environment (DoE);
•	
New land public transport development will be required to undergo thorough 
environmental impact assessments; and
•	
Close collaboration between SPAD and other Government agencies to assess the 
reduction in carbon emissions for the public transportation sector. Subsequently, 
regional plans will be rolled-out to improve inter-connectivity and overall upgrade of 
the public transport infrastructure.
Several ongoing and future developments on the rail sector, include:
•	
RT 3 (Bandar Utama to Klang); 
•	
Gemas-Johor Baharu Double Tracking project;
•	
Mass Rapid Transit line 2 and 3;
•	
Subang SkyPark Terminal Extension Project;
•	
Klang Valley Double Tracking (KVDT);
•	
East Coast Rail Link (ECRL); and
•	
The Malaysia-Singapore Rapid Transit System (RTS) and the High Speed Rail (HSR). 
The timeline for policy implementation for land public transport is shown in Figure 4.3.


Transport | 79 
4.5.1.2 Strengthening the Governance Structure in Green Transportation
The existing governance framework in transportation will be reviewed and enhanced to 
entrust collaboration of Government agencies to advocate green transportation in the 
country. These collaborative agencies will establish the baseline of green transportation 
in Malaysia, including assessment of EE and emission data. The information will be used 
to facilitate policy planning among the relevant stakeholders. In addition, a mechanism 
will be established to align transportation planning at the local Government level to the 
strategic directions set by the federal Government. This will also support the development 
of green townships and green cities in Malaysia. 
Furthermore, attention should go beyond public and private transportation, and also include 
the freight transport, to provide a more holistic governance for the transport sector. The 
Government can enter into either compulsory or voluntary energy efficiency agreement 
with freight companies, and provide incentive to encourage green technology adoption 
among freight hauliers to improve their energy efficiency and sustainability. Apart from 
that, the Government can also provide additional support in the form of energy efficiency 
database that include information on best practices and tools for freight operators to 
estimate the potential gain for switching to more energy efficient mode of operation for 
their fleet.

4.5.1.3 Carbon Emission Standards in the Definition of Energy Efficient Vehicle (EEV)
The current classification of EEV is based on curb weight and fuel consumption. Gradually, 
the car manufacturing industry is shifting towards EEV, as reflected by the aggressive 
growth in percentage of EEV in total industry volume from 8% (2014) to 32.6% (2015) 
within one year. Based on the existing framework, the carbon emission standard is yet 
a criterion in the definition of EEV. As other countries move toward higher fuel standards 
with lower carbon emission regulations, this will impede the export potential of existing 
local EEV products. This is because the carbon emission of existing local EEV has yet to 
meet the international standards. Ironically, the narrow definition of EEV based on fuel 
consumption has largely improved the affordability on car purchase due to tax incentives, 
resulting in more cars on the road. Moving forward, MAI has outlined plans to enhance 
the classification of EEVs using carbon emission standards. The change in classification 
will seek to raise public awareness of the impact of carbon emissions on the environment. 
More importantly, the regulatory change will shift the industry towards manufacturing 
lower emission vehicles.
4.5.1.4 Public-Private Partnership in Mega Public Transport Projects 
Green development initiatives in other states and regions, such as Johor, Penang, Malacca, 
and the East Coast, are geared towards public-private partnership as well as collaboration 
between local authorities, state and federal Governments for initiatives as follows:
•	
2,000 electric buses are set to be on the road by the year 2030, and this initiative aims 
to reduce the environmental impact further;
•	
BRTs in other development corridors, such as Iskandar Malaysia, and other states i.e. 
Penang and Sabah; and
•	
Participation from private developers includes private-public engagement to provide 
targeted support, and facilitate industry growth and possibly demand for exports. 
Some local industry players have already initiated local GT development in the 
manufacturing of electric buses and monorail trains.
These initiatives seek to get more industry players involved in GT adoption and potentially, 
production. The public-private partnership initiatives will include the following:
1.	 Private sector’s involvement in the planning phase of the project criteria or agreement 
with private sector prior to collaboration;
2.	 Time-based incentives to encourage private involvement;
3.	 Economic and environmental impact assessment which will estimate GT development 
impact with the involvement of both public and private sectors; and
4.	 New development to take into consideration the ease of access to public transportation 
(e.g. BRT), which shows the concept of transit-oriented development.


Transport | 81 
4.5.1.5 Partnership with Overseas Entities
MAI has also collaborated with Excellerate Australia (formerly known as AutoCRC) 
through the Economic and Technical (ECOTECH) platform of Malaysia-Australia Free 
Trade Agreement (MAFTA). Through the projects in ‘Breakthrough Battery’ of ‘Vehicle 
Electrification Program’, MAI has developed Intellectual Property (IP) in the area of Lithium-
ion Battery (LiB) electrodes and electrolyte, LiB packaging and management system as 
well as LiB material production scale-up. These LiBs can be used for EVs, hybrids, energy 
storage, etc. The first locally manufactured LiBs are expected to roll out in 2018. 
4.5.1.6 Economic Instruments
A revised road tax mechanism has been put in place for hybrid and EVs which charges 
these vehicles at a lower rate. The Road Transport Department (JPJ) is currently working 
on enhancing the current  road tax system by incorporating a mechanism which considers 
the Green Engine, carbon emission rate, as well as engine performance and safety. 
Stakeholders will be engaged by JPJ to design this new road tax mechanism. 
The enhanced road tax system will be rolled out in phases based on vehicle type. This 
initiative seeks to drive the private transportation industry toward lower carbon emission 
vehicles such as EEVs. 
Additionally, MAI has initiated several studies to develop a Scrap Policy to take vehicles 
off the road in order to control carbon emissions from old vehicles which do not meet the 
road safety and EEV standards. Besides that, monetary incentives for vehicle end-of-life 
policy should be considered. To encourage the vehicle owners to comply with the vehicle 
end-of-life policy, cash/buy back incentives can be provided for the owners to trade-in 
their old vehicles for new EEVs. 
From the Government's procurement aspect, new initiatives will be discussed with Ministry 
of Finance and existing concessionaires on Government vehicles, as well as methods 
to incentivise the procurement of EV. One suggestion is to provide electric vehicle (bus) 
purchase subsidy similar to some other countries (such as China, India and Japan, which 
give subsidy up to USD81,600, USD 6,000 and USD 19,000 respectively) for the first 
2,000 electric buses including the ones that have been purchased before in line with the 
NKEA target. Furthermore, it also proposed for extension of existing EEV incentives for 
manufacturers, purchasers and service providers until 2030.
4.5.1.7 Labelling and Carbon Emission Tax Structure 
MITI/MAI is in the midst of conducting research on the suitability of introducing EEV 
Labeling and Carbon Emission Tax Structure in Malaysia. In EU countries, for instance, 
car manufacturers are required to provide a car’s fuel efficiency, CO2 emissions and other 
relevant information to consumers.This labelling practice helps consumers to choose cars 
that use less fuel and hence emit less CO2. Carbon Emission tax structures, meanwhile, 
aim to encourage consumers to use low emission models by imposing higher taxes on 
models that emit higher emissions.


82 | Green Technology Master Plan 
4.5.1.9 Ride Sharing and E-hailing
The rise of ride sharing and e-hailing services, such as Grab and Uber is seen as both 
disruptive and controversial to the public transport sector in Malaysia. These services 
have brought a new mode of efficient “public transport” which substantially changed the 
way urbanites commutes. At the same time, the lack of comprehensive regulations and 
governance has raised concerns on safety as well as dissatisfactions among other public 
transport providers, particularly the taxi. 
4.5.1.10 First Mile and Last Mile Connectivity 
Several public transport studies are being conducted to further improve the public transport 
system. A study on regional Land Public Transport Master Plan – Northern, Southern and 
Eastern is aimed to improve interconnectivity and overall upgrade of the transport demand 
and infrastructure. Green mobility is one of the main elements to be emphasised in this 
study.
With the recent amendments in the Land Public 
Transport Act 2010 and the Commercial Vehicles 
Licensing Board (CVLB) Act 1987, the e-hailing 
services have been accepted and are expected 
to transform the landscape of public transport in 
Malaysia. According to the report “Automotive 
Revolution 
– 
perspective 
towards 
2030” 
by 
McKinsey, it is expected that 1 out of 10 cars sold 
in 2030 will be potentially a shared vehicle, as ride 
sharing and e-hailing services are seen as the future 
trend in mobility. It is anticipated that the increase of 
ride sharing and e-hailing services could potentially 
increase transport efficiency and mitigate congestion 
issues. In the light of this, the Government should 
continue to play an active role in monitoring and 
encouraging the growth in this sector, to ensure 
that they can contribute towards achieving greener 
transportation system in Malaysia.
Figure 4.4: Grab and Uber - ride 
sharing services in Malaysia.
4.5.1.8 Continuation of the National Biofuel Policy (NBP)
To ensure a smooth implementation of the NBP
, proper consultation and deliberation with 
the stakeholders is necessary. For instance, the Association of Malaysian Hauliers (AMH) 
has expressed their concern on the introduction of B10 diesel in terms of higher costs 
as well as the lack of clear indication on the implementation date of the B10 programme. 
 
Action plans to promote the reliability and sustainability of biofuel for transport and 
industrial use will be implemented, which includes collaborations among Government 
bodies such as MPOB, MPIC, NRE, KeTTHA, MOT and MITI to:
•	
Enhance knowledge sharing among ministries; and
•	
Explore export markets for biodiesel.
This collaboration will provide a platform to resolve industry issues and promote awareness 
to increase acceptance of higher biodiesel blends in the industry.


Transport | 83 
4.5.2 Transport Technology
Green technology in transport poses huge economical and societal benefit that should be 
harnessed by planning ahead the R&D&C activities in the relevant areas. The subsequent 
section here outlines some key green technologies that Malaysia should look into to develop 
the transport sector. Figure 4.6 shows the project timeline for a greener transportation 
sector by 2030.
4.5.2.1 Energy Efficient Vehicle (EEV) Technology
As outlined in the NAP
, the effort towards encouraging the development of EEV should 
be continued. While waiting for the EV ecosystem to mature, technology on improving 
the efficiency of existing internal combustion engine (ICE) based vehicles should be 
developed.
Technology such as automated engine shut down, improved vehicle aerodynamics and 
reduced tyre rolling resistance, can provide improvemens in terms of energy usage of 
existing vehicles. For freight vehicles, additional efficiency improvement measures such as 
installation of maximum speed limiter and scrubber (on freight ships) will also be positive 
steps towards greener transportation.
Moving from gasoline and diesel vehicles to alternative fuel vehicles running on biodiesels 
and CNG can also be fast solutions in improving the energy efficiency of existing vehicles. 
Nevertheless, this requires significant effort in the development of relevant technology as 
well as the preparation of supporting infrastructures, particularly in terms of good coverage 
of refilling stations and service centres for biofuel and CNG vehicles. 
Given the current technological development, electrification of transportation is an inevitable 
trend. EVs offers zero tailpipe emissions and the highest energy efficiency amongst all 
other modes. NAP is focusing on local manufacturing and the local manufacturing requires 
technology acceptance to reach the mass market; hence reaching viable volume for local 
manufacturing operation.
4.5.2.2 Electric Vehicle (EV) Technology
Apart from that, SPAD has embarked on First Last Miles Study, which entails analysis 
and recommendation for GKL bus network and GKL urban rail station’s first last mile 
improvements towards higher public transport usage in GKL, commenced in May 2017 
and is projected to be completed by April 2018.This study aims to set long term priorities 
and plans on Greater KL First Last Mile (FLM) accessibility, connectivity and coverage 
through comprehensive pedestrian, cycling and bus network improvement measures. 
The focus in the next 5 years will be centred on the following strategic thrusts:
1.	 Strengthening the institutional framework in terms of policy implementation, as well as 
the existing governance structure in green transportation; and 
2.	 Creating market demand for and supply of GT in the public land transportation sector 
to develop the industry via market enablers, funded by public-private partnership.


84 | Green Technology Master Plan 
4.5.2.4 Internet of Vehicle
As part of the Internet of Things (IoT) development, Internet of Vehicle (IoV) is the future 
trend of transport system. IoV can be considered as a large scale distribution system 
where information is exchanged between vehicle, road, human and internet, to achieve 
better intelligent traffic management, 
4.5.2.3 Cycling Lane Infrastructure
To shift from motorised to cycling as an alternative transport mode for people, the 
Government is planning to build cycling or bikeways infrastructure especially in the cities. 
This initiative is in line with the Low Carbon Cities program spearheaded by KeTTHA 
and MGTC in promoting cycling as a healthy and green lifestyle leading to a healthy and 
cleaner environment.  
By having the infrastructure development, it will encourage people to use bicycle which 
will help to reduce traffic congestion and the need for parking areas as well as to reduce 
carbon foot print.
EV introduction via Completely Built Unit (CBU) importation and various application 
programs shall be pursued to increase the visibility and acceptance of the technology. To 
bridge the higher cost of ownership for private purchase or running relevant programs with 
EV, incentives such tax exemption, purchase subsidy, tax incentive or special program 
execution fund or grants should be introduced as a catalyst. The program however will 
have to show clear objectives and great impact on the implementation. As such, the 
program with high visibility such as e-hailing, electric taxis car sharing, low carbon mobility 
in campus or green township will be prioritised.
Concurrently, while the market is being primed, development of EV related technology 
can be embarked upon. To ride on this tide of EV development, it is crucial for Malaysia to 
embark on electric vehicle technology development. The core technologies in EV include 
electric motor design, power electronics converters, energy storage systems and battery 
charging technology.
Figure 4.5: ChargEV as National EV Charging Infrastructure 


Transport | 85 
vehicle control, and dynamic information services, towards the realisation of an intelligent 
transport system that is more efficient, safe and green. IoV will also be an enabling 
infrastructure to support the development of autonomous driving, to achieve better 
transportation efficiency.
The use of IoV concept in freight is also an important direction to improve the energy 
usage and efficiency in freight industry. With IoV, the activities and conditions of the freight 
fleet can be monitored in real time, and logistic planning can be improved to reduce travel 
time as well as unnecessary movements or “empty miles” in order to cut down GHG 
emissions and energy consumption.
4.5.2.5 Revolutionary Transportation System
Apart from transport technologies that have already demonstrated their feasibility, R&D&C 
of revolutionary transportation systems that are still at the early stage of their development 
are also important to Malaysia. 
Transportation systems such as the Advanced Transit Networks (ATN) provide alternative 
solution to a more environmentally sustainable transportation. 
ATN embraces various concepts namely personal rapid transit (PRT), group rapid transit 
(GRT) as well as dual mode systems which ensures green mobility whilst offering door-to-
door transit for small group or individuals through interconnecting public transit networks. 
Another revolutionary transportation idea is the Hyperloop system that allows high speed 
passenger and freight transportation on land via pod-like vehicle through low-pressure 
tube. 
4.5.2.6 Human Capital Development
In order to support the growth and development in the transport sector, it is crucial to 
ensure that due attention is given to the development of human capital in the related 
sectors. In particular, transport related syllabus should be integrated into the existing 
Technical and Vocational Education and Trainings (TVET) system as well as institutions 
of higher learnings. On the research front, existing research centres on transportation 
technology should be empowered to spur the development on research human capital. 
For example:
 
•	
SELFUEL (UKM) has been specialising in fuel cell technology development;
•	
Proton Future Lab (UTM);
•	
UMPEDAC (UM) has developed the technical expertise in motor drive, controller and 
energy management system; and
•	
USM and EMC (UTHM) has been working on electric motor designs.

90 | Green Technology Master Plan 
5.1 Introduction
Buildings consume 40% of the world’s energy generation, 12% of its water, and contribute 
40% of the waste sent to landfills. In Malaysia, residential and commercial buildings 
consume about 15% of total energy. Based on National Energy Balance 2014, the 
electricity consumption in Malaysia’s buildings is expected to rise due to:
•	
Rising trend of electricity consumption per capita in the building sector as GDP rises 
which drives the economic buying power of the population; 
•	
Projected increase in the building stock to cater to population growth and simultaneous 
growth in the services industry; and 
•	
Absence of mandatory building energy efficiency policies and supporting measures to 
enforce building energy efficiency. 
Meanwhile, the construction industry in Malaysia is likely to experience a growth rate 
of 10.3% per annum over the next 5 years up to 2020. The GDP contributed by the 
construction industry is expected to increase from 4% to 5.5% by 2020. The growth 
rate of commercial buildings is in the range of 3-6% depending on the building typology. 
The building/construction industry forecast beyond a 5-7 year period is difficult to obtain 
because it is highly dependent on the economic outlook of the country. 
A green building definition covers many aspects such as energy consumption, water 
consumption, waste generation, and hazard of materials among other issues. 
Consideration of the carbon footprint alone of a building is a complex undertaking that 
covers three distinct scope i.e. Embedded Carbon (construction material type of raw 
material, manufacturing process and logistics) and construction method (delivery of 
materials, construction process, waste), Operational Carbon (active design and passive 
design). A similar accounting for water consumption would follow along the same lines. 
Figure 5.1: GreenTech Malaysia's Green Energy Office (GEO) Building


Building | 91 
Currently, Malaysia does not have a single holistic approach led by a particular agency 
that brings together all the actors in the building and construction industry to establish and 
agree on green building goals for the future. Agreement on a future green building goal will 
consequently requires these actors to work together to develop the whole ecosystem that 
can deliver a green building.
This GTMP 2030 will attempt to partially mitigate the holistic framework that is missing 
by setting out aspirations for specific areas in which GT will be pursued to address the 
negative environmental impact of buildings without compromising GDP growth.
The discussion for GT in the building sector will primarily focus on the following areas:
•	
Green building design and operation;
•	
Sustainable construction practices; and
•	
Green building materials.
While some of the measures that are presented here may be administrative in scope, they 
serve as enablers for green technology innovation to take place. 
5.2 Current Landscape 
5.2.1 Green Building Design and Operation
5.2.1.1 Voluntary Building Energy Codes
Green building design was formally started in 2001 when the voluntary MS1525: Code of 
Practice for Energy Efficiency in non-Residential Buildings was introduced covering the 
design specifications of commercial buildings with conditioned floor space of more than 
4,000 m2: 
Another voluntary building energy code, MS2680 - Energy Efficiency and Use of Renewable 
Energy for Residential Buildings Code of Practice was issued in July 2017.
What is MS1525?
MS1525 provides recommended measures and prescribes 
energy performance standards for different elements of the 
building (e.g. maximum permissible rates for heat transfer 
through the building fabric; maximum lighting power densities). 
There have been two revisions of MS1525, i.e. 2007 (revision 1) 
and 2014 (revision 2). MS1525 is a voluntary instrument which 
has gained very little traction in the building industry.  Efforts 
to incorporate the building envelope energy performance 
requirements in the Uniform Building By Law has been 
stymied with only 3 states to date that have gazetted it, i.e 
Selangor (2012), Terengganu 2013(2013), and Penang (2016)


92 | Green Technology Master Plan 
5.2.1.2 Minimum Energy Performance Standards (MEPS) for Electrical Appliances
The Energy Commission ST has developed the MEPS for a range of electrical appliances 
and motors. The EC has also imposed the mandatory labelling of MEPS for appliances 
that are marketed in Malaysia. There are plans to rate additional appliances and electrical 
motors for MEPS labelling and to harmonise the Malaysian MEPS energy ratings with the 
future ASEAN-SHINE program for regionally-harmonised MEPS. 
5.2.1.3 Voluntary Green Building Rating Tools
The adoption of green building design is largely reflected in the number of buildings (new 
and retrofitted) that have been certified to green building rating tools such as MyCREST, 
GBI, and GreenRE, among others.
Malaysian Carbon Reduction and Environmental 
Sustainability Tool (MyCREST)
MyCREST, is a carbon rating tool used by the CIDB that 
takes into account a more holistic life-cycle view of the built 
environment. The Ministry of Works has set a target that all 
new buildings designed after 2016 with a developmental 
value of more than RM50 million must be MyCREST certified
Green Building Index (GBI)
The Green Building Index rating tool was established 
partially in response to encourage the adoption of the 
building energy specifications in MS1525. The GBI is the 
first green rating tool that has been customised to the 
Malaysian climate and legislative requirements. GBI is 
also recognised and associated with the Malaysian Green 
Building Confederation (MGBC) and the WGBC


Building | 93 
As of December 2016, there were about 370 private sector buildings certified to a green 
building rating tool, an increase of 95% compared to the 190 certified green buildings in 
2013. 
The total grid electricity savings by the 190 buildings to date is estimated to be 88,824 
MWh with expected savings of 1,262.4 GWh by 2020. This is equivalent to a potential 
emission reduction of 858.40 ktCO2eq as per Table 5.1.
Penarafan Hijau (PH)
The Environment and Energy Branch (CAST) under the Public Works Department 
(JKR) is responsible for developing, implementing and maintaining JKR’s PH

5.2.1.4 Government Lead by Example (GLBE)
The Government has taken the lead in green building initiatives with 54 Government 
buildings belonging to 25 Ministries in Putrajaya and Kuala Lumpur having embarked on a 
preliminary retrofitting exercise which resulted in a reduction of 14,758 MWh in electricity 
consumption, equivalent to an emission reduction of 10.94 ktCO2eq. 
5.2.1.5 Government Incentives and Funding
Aside from the Tax Incentives and Tax Allowances that has been provided by MIDA for 
investments in green technology and services since 2014, KeTTHA has also introduced 
the Energy Audit Conditional Grant (EACG) scheme initiated in the RMK-11. The grant is 
open to any existing commercial and industrial building with electrical energy consumption 
of more than or equal to 100,000 kWh per month.
MGTC was appointed as the Implementing Agency for the EACG for the industrial sector, 
whilst the commercial sector will be managed by SEDA. To further promote energy 
efficiency practices and to reduce greenhouse gases (GHG) emissions, KeTTHA has also 
taken efforts to retrofit Government buildings such as hospitals using the Audit Grants. 
The EACG intends to:
•	
Create awareness on the importance of energy auditing as a necessary start to energy 
efficiency and conservation; 
•	
Provide a fund for industries to conduct energy audits to establish their baseline 
consumption patterns and to identify opportunities for efficiency; and 
•	
Enhance capacity building in the field of energy auditing.
5.2.1.6 Green Building Proficiency 
There has been fairly intensive development of human capital in green building proficiency 
which is reflected in the variety and absolute number of training courses completed and 
the number of green building professionals that have been certified. Nearly 1,000 courses 
have been conducted in the last 5 years by Green Building Index (GBI), Buildings Sector 
Energy Efficiency Project (BSEEP), Malaysia Association of Energy Service Companies 
(MAESCO), Malaysian Green Technology Corporation (MGTC), Construction Industry 
Development Board CIDB, Real Estate And Housing Developers' Association Malaysia 
(REHDA), Sustainable Energy Development Authority (SEDA) and Suruhanjaya Tenaga 
(ST) among others. 
Figure 5.2: Green Energy Office Buildings  in Malaysia


Building | 95 
The GBI has further assessed the market needs for green building specialists and made 
a projection of the potential numbers of course participants in the future as listed in Table 
5.2.
To incentivise the take-up rate, GBI has actively lobbied MIDA to include the GBI Facilitators 
and Commissioning Specialist courses as a requirement for Income Tax Exemption (ITE). 
5.2.1.7 Other Contributing Activities
The recently concluded Building Sector Energy Efficiency Project (BSEEP) funded by 
JKR-UNDP-GEF explored the scenarios for achieving up to a 60% reduction in energy 
consumption in the commercial sector by 2040.  All scenarios would have required some 
form of mandatory policy intervention with 60% scenario requiring the most ambitious 
policies.  
The Energy Commission also actively promotes green building adoption by encouraging 
participation of Malaysian organisations in the ASEAN Energy Awards for Building 
Category. 
5.2.2 Sustainable Construction Practices
5.2.2.1 Industrial Building System
Throughout a building’s life-cycle, 15% of its GHG emissions occurs during the construction 
phase, while the remaining 85% is produced during building occupation.  To address 
the GHG emissions during the construction phase, the Government has championed the 
adoption of the Industrialised Building Systems (IBS) as a measure to improve sustainability 
in construction practices which will reduce carbon emission and waste generation. IBS 
refers to a construction method in which components are manufactured in a controlled 
environment (either off-site or on-site) and then assembled at-site. The 5 commonly used 
IBS types in Malaysia are:
•	
Precast concrete framing, panel and box systems;
•	
Prefabricated timber framing systems;

•	
Steel framework systems;
•	
Steel framing systems; and
•	
Blockwork systems.
The maximum IBS score is 100. A higher IBS score reflects a better reduction in site 
labour, lower wastage, better quality construction, neater and safer construction sites, 
faster project completion as well as lower total construction costs. The IBS system will 
therefore be important in reducing the amount of construction waste generated, of which 
little is being recycled at the present moment.
The strategy aims to first put in place the institutional framework that will drive the 
subsequent implementation plans for:
•	
Driving innovation in sustainable construction;
•	
Driving compliance to environmental sustainability ratings and requirements;
•	
Focusing on public projects to lead the charge on sustainable practices;
•	
Facilitating industry adoption of sustainable practices; and
•	
Reducing irresponsible waste management during construction.
The CITP targets to improve the adoption of IBS through mandating all public projects 
worth RM10 million and above to achieve a minimum IBS score of 70 in line with the 
Ministry of Finance’s (MOF) circular 1PPL 1/2013. In addition to that, 100% of private 
projects at RM10 million and above are targeted to achieve an IBS score of 50 by 2020 
(Table 5.3). 
The current adoption rate of IBS is only 24% of targeted public projects valued between 
RM10 million to RM50 million  which have achieved an IBS score of 70, while 14% of the 
targeted private projects valued at RM10 million and above have achieved an IBS score 
of 50. 
Currently a comprehensive strategy has been formulated in the Construction Industry 
Transformation Plan (CITP) to improve the adoption rate of IBS.

IBS contributed about RM123.3 million to the national GDP in 2013. If the targets are met, 
the GDP contributed by IBS is likely to increase to RM486.5 million by 2020 and up to RM1 
billion by 2030. 
5.2.3 Green Building Materials
5.2.3.1 Green Building Materials 
Green building materials can be characterised as materials that are environmentally 
friendly to manufacture and able to reduce energy consumption and environmental impact 
during the lifetime of its application in the building. In Malaysia, SIRIM Eco-Label has 
specific requirements that must be met in order for a material to achieve the Eco-Label 
certification. 
Some examples of green building materials that are now available in the market include:
•	
Cement which incorporate recycled materials such as fly ash;
•	
Interior building materials which utilise less hazardous materials and/or less raw 
materials for production such as high-pressure laminates, ceiling boards, partition 
boards, flooring, paneling, adhesive and sealants products; and
•	
Paints which use less volatile organic compounds (VOC) and hazardous chemicals 
and exterior wall paints which are designed to reduce interior building temperatures 
by about 5-10%.
In 2013, the revenues generated from green building materials were estimated at RM660.6 
million The highest contributor to the revenue of green building materials is cement 
(48.5%), followed by paints (24.6%) and interior building materials (10.6%). 
By 2020, the GDP contributed by the subsector is likely to increase to RM2.8 billion, should 
the growth rate of green building be maintained at 30%, similar to global growth rate for 
green building. This GDP figure is estimated to reach RM7.9 billion by 2030, should the 
country continue the efforts in the building sector.  
5.2.3.2 Green Product Directories
Currently, there are two product information sources available to encourage green building 
material procurement, i.e. the MyHijau Directory and GreenPages Malaysia. Products to 
be listed in these two directories are required to be eco-labeled certified by a recognised 
certification body, so that it will assist developers, contractors and consumers in making 
purchasing decisions which takes into consideration the impact of the products to the 
environment. 
Additionally, products that are labelled under the MyHijau directory are eligible for 
incentives under MIDA’s Green Investment Tax Allowance (GITA) introduced in 2014 to 
shift market preference towards green products and services. 


98 | Green Technology Master Plan 
5.3 Issues and Challenges 
In general, implementing sustainable practices in the building and construction sector 
requires significant amount of time and cost investment. The lack of a regulatory push factor 
and uncertainty in actual costs also contributes to the low interest from developers and 
contractors to invest in green building technology. The higher cost incurred for importation 
of the green materials and technology also hinders the shift towards sustainability. 
Specific obstacles and barriers are discussed in the following sections. 
5.3.1 Green Building Design and Operation
5.3.1.1 Implementation issues of MS1525 and MS2680 
Prior to 2012, Malaysia did not have a regulatory instrument to mandate building energy 
codes. This was only partially mitigated when several parts of the MS1525:2007 pertaining 
to building envelope thermal performance were incorporated into the Uniform Building By-
Laws (UBBL) of only 3 of 13 states in 2012 and 2016. The slow progress in UBBL adoption 
has stymied the implementation of the building energy code by the more than 154 local 
authorities. This poses significant carbon lock-in risk from buildings being constructed at 
the present moment. It is also poorly enforceable for retrofitting of existing buildings.
At the same time, the MS1525 code adopted in the UBBL only addresses buildings with 
a floor area more than 4000m2 supplied with central air-conditioning. This ignores roughly 
90% of the commercial building sector gross floor area. Meanwhile, the implementation 
of the MS2680 for residential homes is uncertain because it was only just introduced in 
July 2017.  There has been no assessment of how the voluntary MS2680 can be enforced 
for the design of new residential buildings or influence the retrofits of existing buildings. 
5.3.1.2 Slow uptake of Green Building Ratings
Green building certification has progressed mostly for new buildings with limited uptake by 
existing buildings. Owners of existing building are not sufficiently mandated or incentivised 
to initiate the retrofits that can help them achieve green building certification, despite the 
significant cost benefits in reduced electricity bills and maintenance costs accruing from 
energy efficiency.


Building | 99 
5.3.1.3 Financing Energy Efficiency Retrofits
As energy efficiency retrofits is a relatively new and small market, existing building owners 
and ESCOs find it difficult to access commercial financing for energy retrofit projects 
due to an insufficient credit and project history. Therefore, the Government has recently 
established an Energy Performance Contracting (EPC) Fund that will offer a RM200 million 
credit line and 1% interest rate subsidy.  The EPC Fund was financed by the KeTTHA and 
the BSEEP project which itself was funded by JKR-UNDP-GEF
.  However, the fund size is 
small compared to the potential EPC market size which conservatively is estimated to be 
at least RM500 million to RM1 billion a year.
5.3.1.4 Limited Government Lead By Example (GLBE) Roll-out  
While the Government has taken some lead in green building operations within the 
ministry buildings in Putrajaya, more still needs to be done with all other buildings under 
the Government's purview including the main State Government administrative buildings. 
The challenge would be to obtain accurate data quickly to conduct short-term, medium-
term, and long-term planning to reduce the Government's energy bill.
5.3.2 Sustainable Construction Practice
5.3.2.1 Low IBS Adoption Rates
The institutional framework to improve the adoption rate of Industrialised Building 
Systems (IBS) under the Construction Industry Transformation Programme has been 
developed but the implementation is very slow.  While some of the reasons are inherent in 
the establishment of a new framework, there are other obstacles including a relative lack 
of guided research and development, disconnected procurement practices, the narrow 
focus of the construction industry on certain aspects and the continued dependence on 
outdated methods and materials.
5.3.2.2 Uncontrolled Generation of Construction Waste  
The construction industry generates a significant amount of waste which is mostly disposed 
to landfills or illegal dumps.  This is a loss of opportunity to minimise the resource intensive 
nature of construction by firstly reducing the type and amount of waste generated and 
secondly to recycle the waste instead of disposing into landfills.  


100 | Green Technology Master Plan 
5.3.2.3 Lack of Research into New Construction Methods
There is also a lack of research into new construction practices, apart from the IBS, such 
as automated brick-laying methods which offer greater flexibility in design particularly for 
reducing site labor even further in the construction of low-rise to medium-rise buildings.
5.3.2.4 Lack of Integration between Construction Methods and Construction Material
While the IBS solution is commendable in its focus on the reduction of construction waste 
and site labor, it needs to be more strongly integrated with development of new green 
building materials that can deliver energy and environmental performance over the lifetime 
of the building. 
5.3.2.5 Slow Up-skilling
There is also an urgent need to up-skill the local construction workforce to keep pace 
with the modernisation and efficiency gains of the construction industry, and to make the 
industry attractive to the younger generation to reduce the dependence on foreign labor.
5.3.2.6 Lack of Quantified Data for Environmental Indicators
Quantified data on the reductions in CO2 emissions, water consumption and waste 
generation from 100% IBS adoption in Malaysia have yet to be determined. This will 
hamper the establishment of future goals towards 2030 and beyond as well as limit the 
options for achieving ambitious sustainability goals.
 
5.3.3 Green Building Materials  
The research and development of new green building materials in Malaysia is still in its 
infancy. While there are some products that have been showcased at the annual IGEM 
exhibition and there are a range of products certified to SIRIM’s Eco-Label, the variety and 
quality of innovations is still limited.  
The construction material industry lacks specific material standards that can guide 
investment in the development of new, environmentally friendly construction materials 
and products.  
The development of new construction materials which have a high content of recycled 
construction waste and demolition waste is also not apparent primarily due to regulatory 
barriers against the use of recycled materials in building construction. 


Building | 101 
5.4 Way Forward 
5.4.1 Green Building Design and Operation
5.4.1.1 Near Zero Energy Buildings (NZEB) Target and Regulations
It is imperative for Malaysia to accelerate policy and fiscal instruments which will drive 
building energy consumption to a level of near zero by 2040. The near zero definition itself 
is arbitrary and will require further analysis in the Malaysian climate context, to define 
a value for it. Based on existing technology, a building energy intensity (BEI) range of 
50 - 100 kWh/m2/year for near zero is achievable for centrally air-conditioned buildings. 
Observing the rate at which technology is innovating in the energy efficiency, renewable 
energy and energy storage space, it is entirely possible that the near zero aspiration could 
be upgraded to zero energy with integration of on-site renewable energy.
To achieve a Near Zero Energy Building scenario in 2040, the Government intends to 
draft an Energy Efficiency and Conservation Act (EECA) that regulates requirements for 
comprehensive building energy codes, building energy labelling and electrical appliance 
energy performance standards. The regulatory requirements are targeted to come into 
force in 2019/2020. Subsequently, intermediate BEI targets for 2030 and 2035 can then 
be established for the various building typologies in Malaysia.
The EECA will ensure that both the residential and commercial buildings are included 
within its scope. It will also ensure that the MS1525 and MS2680 undergo mandatory 
revisions to keep pace with the BEI targets that the Government intends to set.
5.4.1.2 Green Building Certification Incentives and Financing
 
The Government is targeting between 550 and 1,750 buildings to be certified to a green 
building rating tool by 2020 and 2030 respectively.

102 | Green Technology Master Plan 
In addition to the existing Investment Tax Allowance (ITA) and Income Tax Exemption 
(ITE), the Government will consider expanding the EACG scheme which started in RMK-
11 to encourage building energy retrofits.  These retrofits will contribute to the number 
of buildings that can be certified green as well as it will encourage building owners to 
take the first step of assessing their energy consumption and identifying energy efficiency 
opportunities.  
Depending on the market progress, the Government could also encourage the growth of 
the EPC market by enlarging the EPC Fund or encouraging the private sector financial 
institutions to establish similar fund schemes or Green Sukuk schemes. 
The Government is in the process of creating an annual Energy Efficiency Award which will 
indirectly stimulate more interest in green building ratings.  The EE Award will also serve as 
the springboard to the ASEAN Energy Awards.
5.4.1.3 Government Lead by Example
KeTTHA will continue to coordinate the efforts to achieve the projected 5% increase in the 
reduction of energy consumption in the Putrajaya federal Government buildings by 2020. 
KeTTHA also intends to implement building energy disclosure for the ministry buildings in 
Putrajaya which will provide added impetus and transparency to the Government’s efforts 
in energy efficiency. 
The Government plans to collate and analyze building asset data across all ministries 
in order to understand the energy consumption patterns of these buildings.  Once this 
information has been processed, the Government will be able to set energy efficiency 
targets for 2020, 2025 and 2030. 
5.4.2 Sustainable Construction Practice
The CIDB has developed the Construction Industry Transformation Programme (CITP) to 
change the way construction is being undertaken. It encourages industry players to adopt 
proper planning to reduce the impact of construction industries to the environment. 
The continuous implementation of the CITP is designed to:
•	
Improve the financial viability of IBS through various means; 
•	
Reduce the generation of on-site waste;
•	
Develop competencies via the Center of Excellence (CoE); and
•	
Develop Malaysia Standards for construction specifications that include green 
technology requirements.
5.4.2.1 Improving IBS Adoption Rates via Improved Procurement Practices
The public procurement approach will be changed to be less costly and more direct 
by separating IBS procurement from the main contract. This separation from the main 
contract will: 


Building | 103 
•	
Remove the burden of financial liquidity as payments will be managed by project 
owners and clients as they can directly procure the IBS components from the suppliers. 
This may generate competitiveness amongst IBS manufacturers and may eliminate 
any potential mark-up of prices via main contractors; and
•	
Reduce cost to the contractor and increase demand certainty for IBS suppliers; 
Other approaches also include recommending sustainability requirements within 
procurement processes for public buildings and infrastructure.
5.4.2.2 Improving the Financial Viability of IBS through Tax Incentives
The existing duty on IBS equipment in Malaysia is 40%, which is considerably higher than 
those of neighboring countries. The relatively small pool of IBS specialists operating in 
Malaysia has also led to requirements for upfront payment and long delivery lead times, 
making IBS materials much costlier which slows down the IBS adoption rate. Future 
Government initiatives to address this will include considerations of the following: 
•	
Tax/levers to improve economics for local IBS manufacturers;
•	
Tax holiday on IBS component plants;
•	
Higher plot ratio for IBS compliance; and 
•	
Revolving fund for IBS working capital.
The CIDB plans to undertake a cost-benefit analysis for the adoption of IBS and finalise 
tax incentive proposals. In addition, the CIDB will also engage stakeholders to facilitate 
changes in practices and regulations as well as provide input into the design of economic 
mechanisms to improve the financial viability of IBS machinery and equipment for the 
manufacturers and suppliers.
5.4.2.3 Other Support Measures for IBS Adoption
CIDB will publish IBS catalogues which are harmonised with IBS suppliers. 
•	
Ensuring IBS adoption in the private sector via inclusion in Development Order and 
implementing changes to the Uniform Building By-Laws (UBBL) requirements. 
•	
To incorporate IBS and modular coordination into the JKR Pre-Approved Plans (PAP) 
followed by a requirement for common public building construction and Government-
linked projects to use PAP unless exempted by the Director-General of Public Works.
5.4.2.4 Reducing and Recycling Construction Waste
Implementing a circular economy approach to construction waste will see direct benefits 
of reduced costs due to reductions in the utilisation of raw materials, reductions in disposal 
costs, cost gains from recycling and cost gains from incorporating waste materials into 
new construction materials.
Therefore, the CITP actions to achieve this objective of closing the loop on construction 
waste include:


104 | Green Technology Master Plan 
•	
Heightening enforcement against illegal dumping;
•	
Developing and distributing Site Waste Management Plans (SWMP) to industry 
players, including the concept of “Deconstruction” instead of “Demolition” so that 
parts of the building can be recycled for other purposes;
•	
Devising landfill taxation mechanisms as punitive approach to excessive waste 
generation;

 Research to identify and determine the baseline data for landfill taxation 
mechanisms is underway
•	
Encouraging building of construction-specific recycling centers;

 CIDB targets to achieve a minimum of 3 recycling centers by 2020
•	
Facilitating the procurement of recycling product/material or local C&D waste for 
recycling plants in priority areas.
5.4.2.5 Malaysian Standard for Construction Specifications
Under the CITP
, there are initiatives to introduce Malaysian Standards for construction 
specifications that will encompass quality, material standards, safety, environment, energy 
and methodology. 
The publication of the Malaysian Standards will serve as public reference and guideline 
for the industry to base practices on. It is foreseen that this will lead to efficient cost 
reductions and lower wastage. 
The Malaysian Standards will be aligned with the building energy codes that will be made 
as requirement in the proposed Energy Efficiency and Conservation Act (EECA) so that 
near-zero energy buildings can be achieved.
5.4.2.6 Developing competencies via Center of Excellence
Human capital development initiatives under the CoE of the CIDB include:
•	
Upskilling the local construction labor force to keep pace with modernisation of the 
construction industry and to reduce dependence on foreign labor
•	
Developing and promoting training programs on sustainability topics for the industry
•	
Partnering with leading local universities with the aim of becoming a hub for research on: 

sustainable practices in construction;

the integration with new green building materials;

development of quantified data for environmental indicators; and 
•	
Partnering global and local industry sustainability experts including sustainability 
advocates, academicians and industry players to develop training modules for 
members of the CoE
•	
To increase the number of planners rather than engineers (executors) only


Building | 105 
5.4.3 Green Building Materials
The CITP has put forward measures to raise the performance of local construction players 
to meet international standards. This includes the adoption of higher material standards 
and specifications.
5.4.3.1 Policy Framework to Enable Recycling of C&D Materials
Up until 2022, the CIDB will collaborate with key stakeholders to facilitate equipment 
procurement for construction and demolition (C&D) waste recycling in priority areas and 
work to amend policies that will allow the usage of recycled materials in construction. 
The private sector will be encouraged to work with the CIDB in setting up supportive 
policies that recommend or require the use of part-recycled construction materials for 
some portion of the construction of major projects. A sector lead will be identified to 
champion this transformation. Government facilitation will be in place to establish relevant 
studies to support policy development.
5.4.3.2 Research on Green Building Materials with Improved Thermal Properties
The CIDB will establish further research plans on energy efficient building materials as 
necessary after further consultation with the building material industry. These material 
standards that are to be developed must also be aligned with future revisions of the MS1525 
and MS2680 since the material specifications will contribute to the energy efficiency and 
environmental performance of the whole building.
 
5.4.4 Greening the Building Ecosystem
The entire ecosystem of the Building industry must be examined for GT opportunities. This 
pursuit must have a singular goal of reducing the carbon foot print of a building all the way 
from its inception to its construction through to its occupation. Not only must the design 
strive towards nZEB but the materials and electrical equipment must look to be the most 
sustainable that is available in the market while the construction methodologies become 
increasingly automated. 
Centre of Excellence (CoE) by CIDB
The CoE under CIDB will focus on the following key initiatives:
•	
Raising perception of sustainability;
•	
Promotion of best practices in sustainability; 
•	
Supporting the capability development in sustainability across the industry value 
chain; and
•	
Exit policies — Rationalise Government incentives on R&D to create a self-
sustaining industry.
•	
Advanced research in construction methods


106 | Green Technology Master Plan 
This holistic approach requires concrete policies which are progressive and ambitious 
to provide the market certainty necessary to embark on this course. In addition, the 
Government needs to bring the entire ecosystem of stakeholders together to explore, 
produce and coordinate agreed targets and timelines to achieve the nZEB and ZEB goals 
in the 2020-2030 period as conceptualised in Table 5.5.

6.1 Introduction
Waste generation is often linked to development and industrialisation, and its implication 
to people and the environment remains a global issue, particularly in developing countries. 
Population, rapid economic growth and changes in lifestyle have resulted in the complexity 
of the waste composition being generated and contributed to the ever-increasing waste 
generation per capita. These, together with inadequate infrastructure, limited budget in 
managing the waste and land scarcity has made waste management a priority area for the 
Malaysian Government.
The Eleventh Malaysia Plan (RMK-11) echoes this concern, with strategies being put in 
place to ensure efficient waste management through formulation of guidelines on resource 
use and increased measures for effective enforcement. The main strategy is to adopt a 
waste to wealth approach, where waste is no longer seen as something that is not wanted 
or needed, but as an economic asset. 
At present waste management is largely driven by the public sector, supported by 
a regulatory framework, which governs the generation, storage, collection, transfer 
and transport, treatment and disposal of waste. Waste generated in Malaysia can be 
categorised into 7 types namely: municipal solid waste (MSW), sewage1, mining waste, 
construction waste, scheduled and hazardous waste, agriculture waste and radioactive 
waste. MSW, compared to the other types of waste is the fastest and largest growing 
waste type in terms of the volume that is generated. The daily MSW generation in Malaysia 
has shown an increase from 18,180 tonnes (2005) to 33,130 tonnes (2012).
In 2016, the daily MSW generation reached 40,566 tonnes. This surpassed the projected 
waste generation of 30,000 tonnes by 2020, resulting in a revised estimation of projection 
of daily MSW to 49,670 tonnes. (Refer to Figure 6.1)

Figure 6.2 Statistics on Waste sector in Malaysia3 
Figure 6.3: Major sources of methane emissions in Malaysia as of 20114 
 
According to a survey conducted on Solid Waste Composition, Characteristics and 
Existing Practice of Solid Waste Recycling in Malaysia in 2013, 51% of waste generated 
comprised biodegradable waste, which included food waste, garden waste, wood and 
husk. 81% of the biodegradable waste disposed at landfills has since decomposed in an 
anaerobic condition producing large volumes of methane. 
Methane is a primary source of GHG emissions in the waste sector, contributing to 23% of 
the total GHG emissions in Malaysia, of which 90.9% were generated from landfills, 8.6% 
from palm oil mill effluent (POME) and just under 1% were generated from bio-effluent 
(Refer Figure 6.3). Despite being an important industry for the country, the processing of 
palm oil may result in huge environmental impact, if no proper control measures are taken. 
Scheduled and hazardous wastes, generated from industrial activities, form another 
category of waste that requires proper handling, treatment and disposal. While the industrial 
sector is a major contributor to national GDP
, the industrial processes produced direct or 
indirect by-products in solid, semi-solid or liquid form, or in the form of gas or vapor which 
is emitted, discharged or deposited in the environment in volume, composition or manner 
such as to cause pollution and is harmful to humans and the environment.

These wastes are regulated under the Environmental Quality Act 1974 (Act 127), the 
Environmental Quality (Scheduled Waste) Regulations 2005. 
Construction waste is also another aspect of concern, given that different types of wastes 
are generated from various types of construction activities, such as building works; road 
works and infrastructure development; as well as tunnelling. The sector is expected to 
expand by 10.3% per annum during the RMK-11 period mainly to fulfil the need in the 
housing/residential sector, which requires a rethink of how to capitalise on the waste that 
will be generated, and closing the waste life cycle loop. 
	
The RMK-11 is cognisant of the challenges and opportunities to help transform the 
sector from one that is problematic to one that can contribute to green growth. The idea 
is to intensify existing initiatives, put in place since the Ninth Malaysia Plan (2001-2005), 
such as recycling and recovery to improved management of landfills, through innovative 
approaches where waste can be diverted and recovered, and converting them to resource. 
Private sector support and partnership will be key to drive innovation and technology 
adoption.
This Chapter briefly discusses the scenario of waste management in Malaysia, taking into 
account issues and challenges in existing initiatives, with emphasis on mainstreaming 
green technology as a means to strengthen waste management measures and capitalise 
on opportunities to turn waste to wealth.
6.2 Current Landscape
6.2.1 Treatment and Disposal of MSW in Malaysia
MSW management falls under the purview of both the Federal and State Government. At 
the Federal level, the National Solid Waste Management Department (JPSPN) develops 
solid waste and public cleansing policies and strategies, action plans and formulate the 
necessary legislative measures to support management.  JPSPN is assisted by the Solid 
Waste Management and Public Cleansing Corporation (SW Corp). As of 2017, seven 
(7) states, including Kuala Lumpur, Putrajaya, Melaka, Perlis, Negeri Sembilan, Pahang, 
Kedah and Johor have adopted the Solid Waste and Public Cleansing Management Act 
2007 (Act 672). Under this Act, measures relating to solid waste management and public 
cleansing across all local authorities are standardised. JPSPN has the national oversight 
on MSW management in the above- mentioned seven (7) states. While in the other states, 
MSW management is subject to State Governments’ authorities. 
In the seven (7) aforementioned states, three concessionaires have been appointed in areas 
identified by JPSPN, to provide services in relation to waste collection, transportation and 
disposal services in Peninsular Malaysia. As of 2017, 95% of the collected waste are taken 
to disposal sites while the remaining 5% goes to waste treatment facilities.


114 | Green Technology Master Plan 
The Government has implemented policies and programmes to reduce waste generation 
and to divert waste from landfills. Multi-pronged approaches have been taken to address 
MSW management issues, including waste minimisation through the National Recycling 
Programme introduced in the year 2000 and the Waste Separation at Source Programme 
introduced on 1st September 2015. Both programmes were aimed at improving awareness 
on sustainable waste management and reduce waste generation, which is intended to 
address the problem of space at landfills and reduce the need to allocate area for landfill 
siting. 
6.2.1.1 Sanitary Landfills and Methane Recovery from Landfills
Various technologies are available to provide efficient MSW management. However, 
adopting technology that is technically feasible, reliable, economically viable, 
environmentally sound, and socially acceptable is a challenge in MSW management. 
Landfilling remains the most common MSW disposal method in Malaysia. As of 2016, 
there are 161 landfill sites in Malaysia. 14 of the sites are sanitary landfills and 147 are 
non-sanitary landfills. 
Landfilling MSW is an anaerobic process. It produces landfill gases that consist of carbon 
dioxide, methane, hydrogen sulfide, ammonia and other traces of gas. Besides producing 
GHGs, landfilling requires huge land space and releases unpleasant odour and leachate 
that requires treatment. Methane is known to be one of the high Global Warming Potential 
(GWP). Technology however, has helped to minimise the problem, enabling these gases to 
be harvested, treated, and applied for electrical generation or direct heating if not flared. 
Waste treatment and disposal, which includes sanitary landfills, contributed about 
RM81.07 million towards Malaysia’s GDP in 2012 and 2013. This figure is projected to 
increase to RM334.0 million and RM489.7 million in 2020 and 2030 respectively, should 
the volume of waste continue to increase with 95% of the counted waste being taken to 
disposal sites and the remaining 5% goes to waste treatment facilities5.

Waste-to-Energy (WtE) thermal plant offer a high technology solution in waste management, 
in that it reduces waste while producing electricity. Investment in WtE can bring great 
benefits to the environment. It reduces the waste volume by approximately 90% which 
leads to reducing the need for land area to site landfills. Studies have also shown that WtE 
plants produce more energy as compared to landfill gas projects.     
The Government’s existing initiatives on WtE thermal plants are now focusing on improving 
the project viability of WtE thermal plants in Malaysia. This strategy considers the maturity 
of technology, and also the availability of a sustainable funding mechanism, given that it 
can be expensive to develop and maintain.
A WtE thermal plant project in Kuala Lumpur is underway with the capacity to process 
1,000 tonnes of waste per day. It is expected that Malacca will follow suit as the existing 
landfill capacity in the state is likely to reach its maximum in 8 years, followed by Johor. 
The WtE thermal plant in Kuala Lumpur is expected to begin operations by 2020. Learning 
from previous experience on the negative perceptions to incineration technology, 
the Government has conducted communication programmes to improve the public’s 
awareness and acceptance towards the technology. Prior to the 2014, the WtE thermal 
plant in Kuala Lumpur, the Government launched public engagements since 2013 to help 
citizens understand the rationale for implementing the project and how it could impact 
stakeholders.
6.2.2 Waste and Resource Recovery
Resource recovery from waste, is referring to selective extraction of disposed materials for 
next use, to extract the maximum benefits from products which will help reduce or delay 
the consumption of natural resources and reduce the amount of waste generated.

As it is, with the currently recycling rate of MSW being around 17.5% (2016), a lot of 
valuable materials from the waste sent to landfill are yet to be recovered. It also provides 
an opportunity to create economic value for these materials while reducing environmental 
impact. Innovation and green technology adoption will be the key driver to steer waste 
management towards greater resource efficiency.
6.2.2.1 Methane Capture from Palm Oil Mill Effluent (POME)
Despite being an important industry for the country, the processing of palm oil may result 
in huge environmental impact, if no proper control measures are taken. Between 2016 
and 2020, the average annual production of palm oil in Malaysia is expected to reach 
15.4 million tonnes, producing about 100 million tonnes of residue by 2020.  Mitigation 
of environmental impacts of palm mill activities falls under the purview of the Department 
of Environment Malaysia (DOE). The Malaysian Palm Oil Board (MPOB) supports the 
DOE’s mandate by regulating the activities in the palm oil mills, especially through the 
implementation of registration and licensing. There are regular engagements between 
MPOB and NRE to provide GHG data for biogas captured from palm oil mill effluents 
(POME) under Performance Management and Delivery Unit of the Prime Minister’s 
Department’s (PEMANDU) Entry Point Project (EPP) on ‘Developing biogas facilities at 
palm oil mills’. In 2016, 92 palm oil mills are reported to be equipped with biogas capture 
facilities, showing an increase from 71 in 2013.
A Roundtable on Sustainable Palm Oil (RSPO) was established in 2004, supported by a 
certification process to ensure the credibility of palm oil sustainability claims. Currently, 
131 Malaysian companies are RSPO certified. 
Did you know? 
Common EU target for recycling of municipal waste by 2030 is 65% whereas packaging waste is 
75%. There is a binding landfill target to reduce landfill to maximum of 10% of municipal waste by 
2030

In 2011, 8.6% of methane emission originated from POME. In view of the amount of 
methane emission originating from POME, the Government aims to achieve the installation 
of biogas capture facilities in all palm oil mills by 2020. A reduction in emissions of 3,002 
ktCO2eq can be achieved from this initiative; and from this volume of biogas, approximately 
1.9 million MWh of electric power can be generated. 
6.3 Issues and Challenges
Main issues and challenges in waste management in Malaysia are described below:
6.3.1 Public Awareness
In general, there are low awareness among the people on the needs to reduce waste 
generation and dispose waste responsibly. The daily MSW generation in Malaysia was 
reported to increase exponentially. 38,000 tons MSW generated per day and growing at a 
rate off 0.5% per year with economic growth and population increase7.
Figure 6.6: Various categories of recycled materials
7 SWCorp, April 2017 & PEMANDU LAB, June 2015


118 | Green Technology Master Plan 
The 3R (Reduce, Reused and Recycle) campaign is taking place slowly at the rate of 
17.5% (2016) and is yet to make significant impact to overall waste reduction. Changing 
public behaviours and mind set in waste reduction and recycling takes time but efforts 
need to continue to finally bring change in the life styles of Malaysian.
Open dumping landfill is still being practiced in many areas, resulting in the creation of 
illegal dumpsites, raw leachate direct discharge and open burning which has affected 
the water quality of rivers and the air quality. The preference is largely a result of financial 
constraint and lack of knowledge and understanding on the environmental impact of open 
dumping. 
New sites for waste treatment and disposal facilities often received public protest. Not In 
My Back Yard (NIMBY) syndrome has been the way public responded to the proposal of 
waste treatment infrastructure such as landfill, incineration plant or transfer stations. This 
is mainly due to the nature of its dirty operation. Scarcity of land often creates conflict in 
land used for waste treatment and disposal facilities. 
In Malaysia, there is also strong public protest towards the usage of waste incinerator. The 
resistance is mainly driven by the experience on waste incinerators where limited public 
consultations were done; negative perceptions and fear of potential impact to health 
and environment from the toxic fumes of the incineration process and poor maintenance 
culture and monitoring system being track records on many facilities built in the country. 
Although there are some good track records from incineration operations in Malaysia, the 
lack of confidence in the authority and disasters created by such system elsewhere still 
lingers in the public mind.  
6.3.2 Limited Resources in Waste Management Implementation
Most of the landfills are equipped with minimal facilities. There is a high upfront cost 
to support the development of new sanitary landfills, upgrading non-sanitary landfills to 
sanitary landfills and safe closure of dumpsites or non-sanitary landfills. The Government 
had privatised MSW services but the high cost of investment has required the Government 
to share a major portion of the investments in the initial stage. This is done via Government’s 
investment for the development and maintenance of waste treatment and disposal 
facilities. 
Such investment is deemed necessary to reduce the impact of high cost recovery from 
the public, especially when the existing MSW services is funded partly through the 
assessment tax on the people in the form of tipping fees. The tipping fees in Malaysia is 
reported to be among the lowest in the world. This limits the attractiveness of the sector 
to new investment and technology exploration in the country.
6.3.3 Viability on High Technology Waste Treatment Plant 
Adopting technologies that are technically feasible, reliable, economically viable, 
environmentally sound, and socially acceptable pose additional challenges in MSW 
management for Malaysia. Recycling is preferable but takes time to implement and 
requires changes in behaviour of people at all levels. 


Waste | 119 
Waste handling by WtE is a good option to start with but it requires high capital and 
operating expenditure. It is estimated to be 300 times more expensive than the conventional 
landfilling method. The economic viability of WtE needs to be driven by the Government 
support on waste volume guarantees, increase in tipping fee and high electricity tariff. 
In many countries the WtE plant is Government owned or mostly operated by non-profit 
Government companies. However, there are also limited private WtE plants with moderate 
returns in operation. 
Malaysia has a lot to learn from its past experiences in implementing WtE plant. The first 
talk on WtE started back in 1998. In 2003, the first project was awarded to a Japanese 
company. However, the project was cancelled in 2007 due to public protest and cost 
concern. The Semenyih WtE plant, built and operated by a private company in 2009 was 
only able to operate partially due to some technical flaws. In 2012 Feed-in-Tariff for solid 
wastes WtE was introduced by SEDA. Learning from the past, strategies are refined and 
as the technology gets more matured several proposals on WtE are now on the way. 
6.3.4 Inter Agencies Coordination on Waste Management
Waste management is currently implemented independently according to types of waste 
categories by relevant agencies such as JPSPN, SWCorp and DOE as per their respective 
jurisdictions. This creates gaps in waste management from four (4) aspects:
•	
Jurisdiction: Electronic waste from industries is regulated under the Environmental 
Quality Act 1974 whereas electronic waste from households is currently not regulated 
and being dumped together with other household waste and finally disposed in 
landfills. 
•	
Data availability: JPSPN has the oversight of the implementation of MSW management 
in the 7 states which have adopted Act 672. However, the department does not have 
direct access to the information on the remaining states and Federal territories which 
had not adopted the Act. 
•	
Knowledge and competencies: The high turn-over in the relevant Government 
agencies had posed challenges in ensuring the officials are equipped with the required 
knowledge on waste management topics and technologies available in the country. 
Management of diverse types of waste necessitates comprehensive understanding of 
the sector from all aspects. 
•	
Governance (implementation and monitoring): Absence of review and monitoring 
mechanism which allows the federal Government to monitor the states’ implementation 
and policy planning on waste management. The existing governance and limitations 
on law enforcement lead to difficulties in aligning the standards of various landfills in 
states in Malaysia, including the existence of unsafe and illegal dumpsites in which 
methane emissions are not captured and leachate discharge untreated.

6.4.1 Waste Treatment and Disposal 
6.4.1.1 Policies Improvement and Technology Upgrading in Landfills Operation
In addressing issues arising from environmental impacts of landfills, the Government has 
since mandated that landfills built in Malaysia after 2004 to be of sanitary standard with 
features consisting of liners, leachate collection and treatment, gas harvesting and daily 
and final covers. Furthermore, to reduce methane emissions, landfills are now required to 
be equipped with methane capturing systems using semi aerobic systems.

On the current operating non-sanitary landfill, KPKT has been conducting scheduled site 
visits assessment to determine whether those facilities should be rationalised, upgraded 
or decommissioned.  Among the initiatives include:
•	
Upgrade existing dumpsites to sanitary landfills which incorporate treat leachate 
before it is discharged into the environment;
•	
Safe closure of dumpsites or non-sanitary landfills; and
•	
New land used on landfill land which has been safely closed (e.g. recreational park).
At present, JPSPN is also focusing on developing a new regional sanitary landfill and 
decommissioning low performing and unsafe landfills. The initiative will be supported by 
the development of new transfer stations to facilitate waste transportation from sources 
to landfill sites. The transfer stations also serve as an intermediate step to make waste 
collection system more efficient and cost effective. This can be achieved by collecting 
waste from different regions and transporting them to the appropriate disposal sites. There 
are currently four transfer stations in Malaysia and by 2018, three more will be constructed 
in phases. Applying green technology that is economically viable, environmentally sound 
and socially acceptable is vital in the development of the new landfill and transfer stations, 
especially in the area of waste collection and waste transport.
6.4.1.2 Introducing Policy on Food Waste Management 
Application of GT in waste reduction, separation and composting is very relevant in food 
waste management. Recognising food waste as the key component of MSW and its 
resulting amount of methane, the Government has developed the National Strategic Plan 
for Food Waste Management. The plan encourages:
•	
Diversion and minimisation of food waste from entering the landfill, such as processing 
food waste to produce compost and aquaculture feed;
•	
Proper treatment of food waste generated; and
•	
Effective recovery of landfill gases.
6.4.1.3 Introducing Market Enablers through EPP
EPP 9 on Developing an Efficient Solid Waste Management System under the Economic 
Transformation Programme (ETP) identified four initiatives that have great bearing on 
nurturing future clean and green technologies that can enhance:
•	
product design to facilitate the implementation of the Reduce, Reuse, Recycle (3R) 
programme;
•	
waste treatment capacity to reduce reliance on landfills; 
•	
waste collection and transportation such as automatic waste collection and the use

6.4.2 Waste and Resource Recovery in Palm Oil Sector
The Government has supported methane capture from POME through the following 
initiatives:
6.4.2.1 Mandating the Installation of Methane Capturing Facilities
DOE has been enforcing Environmental Quality Act 1974 and the Environmental Quality 
(Prescribed Premises) (Crude Palm Oil) Regulations 1977 to regulate POME final discharge 
standards nationwide. For emission control, DOE has been enforcing the Environmental 
Quality (Clean Air) Regulation 2014 which imposed a new limit of dust load concentration 
or particulate level for solid fuel boilers of 150mg/Nm3 as compared to 400mg/Nm3 
previously.  Palm oil mills are given 5-year grace period till 2019 to fully adhere to the 
regulatory requirement.  
Through MPOB, the Government mandated that new palm oil mills and mills which expand 
their capacity in 2014 to install methane capturing facilities. The technology has the 
potential to convert captured methane to electric power, which can be used in the mills or 
connected to the national grid. To ensure compliance with the mandate, the Government 
has implemented strict approval and monitoring of biogas trapping facilities in palm oil 
mills. The monitoring and reporting of biogas capture facilities and the regulations that 
govern by-product safety at palm oil mills are conducted through the collaboration of 
MPOB and NRE. 
6.4.2.2 Conducting Research to Expand the Use of Biogas as a By-Product of Palm Oil 
Mills
Addressing technological barriers, it requires greater investment and nurturing of research, 
development and innovation to minimise and where possible remove the harm of POME 
discharged to the environment. Currently, this research is funded by the MPOB.
Apart from co-firing biogas in existing mill for on-grid and off-grid electricity production, 
MPOB is also expanding the use of biogas as a by-product of palm oil mills by utilising the 
biogas as compressed natural gas for industrial and vehicle use.


Waste | 123 
6.4.2.3 Promotion and Commercialisation Biogas Capture for Palm Oil Mills
The MPOB National Key Economic Areas Working Group was established to monitor the 
promotion of biogas capture at all mills. Promotion activities include:
•	
Regular seminars and conferences by MPOB;
•	
Biogas capture technology facilitation for industry;
•	
On-site visits; and
•	
Roadshows.
Furthermore, a Technology Transfer Seminar is held annually to disseminate and educate 
the entire industry on potential new technology for industry adoption.
6.4.2.4 Implementing Grading and Certification Mechanism and Talent Development 
Initiatives
The grading and certification mechanisms currently offered by MPOB include the 
Malaysian Sustainable Palm Oil (MSPO) certification and Codes of Practice (CoP). MPOB 
has implemented several talent development initiatives, such as:
•	
Training courses (e.g. diploma in palm oil milling technology and management, courses 
on supervising and operating a lab for palm oil processing and courses on palm oil 
effluent treatment processes);
•	
Institute of Malaysian Plantation and Commodities (IMPAC);
•	
Graduate Student Assistantship (GSAS) Programme; and
•	
Yayasan MPOB scholarship.
MPOB develops its own talent through industry attachment programmes, overseas and 
local conferences and seminars, annual engagement with experts at the Programme 
Advisory Committee in April, higher education (PhD-MSc) programme sponsorship and 
overseas training.
6.4.2.5 Implementing Tax Allowance and Import Duties
According to the 2014 ETP Annual Report, the EPP 5 Key Performance Indicator (KPI) that 
aimed to progress the construction of two biogas plants to be connected to the grid or 
external users was achieved by 150%. The Government’s assistance in providing financial 
support had a large role to play in the success of the KPI, namely:
•	
Pioneer Status (PS) – exemption from income tax on 100% of statutory income for 10 
years;
•	
Investment Tax Allowance – 100% of qualifying capital expenditure incurred within a 
period of 5 years can be utilised against 100% of the statutory income for each year 
of the assessment;
•	
Import Duty;
•	
Sales Tax Exemption for local products; and
•	
Exemption of import duty and/ or sales tax.


124 | Green Technology Master Plan 
6.5 Way Forward
Moving forward in the next five years, the Government’s efforts should focus on shifting 
from waste management to resources efficiency. Priority in managing waste should be 
given to prevent the waste from being generated in the first place. The five steps of waste 
hierarchy should apply:
•	
Reduce; 
•	
Reuse;
•	
Recycling;
•	
Recovery, e.g. energy recovery; and
•	
Disposal, e.g. landfill.
Disposal of waste via landfill should be the last resort. More waste is leading to higher cost 
in waste management. Instead, waste should be reused and treated to recover energy 
and materials. Producers should take responsibility in their product design in reducing the 
content of hazardous substances in their product. 
6.5.1 Enhancing Policy  
6.5.1.1 Strengthening the Institutional Framework
The Government has set up a National committee on Sustainable Waste Management to 
increase coordination on the management of the 7 types of waste (i.e. solid, agriculture, 
construction, radioactive, mining, sewage and scheduled waste) based on a life-cycle 
approach. This committee should streamline the roles and responsibility of various 
agencies in formulating policies to manage all the 7 categories of waste to work towards 
waste reduction. 
This includes data collection with regards to waste generation, collection, treatment and 
disposal and organisation from various sources, such as domestic, industrial, commercial 
and institutions. This will address the data unavailability on different types of waste to 
enable evidence-based policy planning. The improvement on institutional framework 
is envisioned to demonstrate the Government’s commitment to improving waste 
management in the country to create more business opportunities for industry, such as 
WtE or the recycling of waste. Leveraging on the database of different types of waste, 
relevant Government bodies can facilitate GT growth in the waste sector by identifying 
and designing market enablers to create market demand. Also, it helps to assess the 
feasibility of the application of GT and its viability to clearly define the demand creation 
that is catered to existing markets.
6.5.1.2 Enhancing Coordination between Federal and State Governments
A review and monitoring mechanism will be developed to provide a platform for the 
federal Government to align the states’ implementation and policy planning on waste 
management with the federal Government’s strategic direction. The mechanism will be 
supported by a panel of cross-ministerial and Government bodies such as NRE, KeTTHA 
and KPKT, including private sector experts to provide consultancy and advisory services 
to the states and local authorities. 


Waste | 125 
The National Council for Local Government or Majlis Negara bagi Kerajaan Tempatan 
(MNKT), an annual forum led by the Local Government Department or Jabatan Kerajaan 
Tempatan (JKT) will be leveraged to achieve this objective.
6.5.1.3 Formulating Policy Paper on Waste Separation in Non-Household Areas
The Government will be advocating the separation of waste in the Industrial, Commercial 
and Institutional (ICI) sector, after the implementation of waste separation at source in the 
housing areas. By 2017, the policy paper for an awareness programme on separation of 
waste in commercial areas will be launched.
A detailed action plan on food waste minimisation at source will be developed. The plan 
should encourage technology adoption to compact and sort waste, use IOT to manage 
waste from households, track waste footprint, reward scheme e.g. for those with the 
smallest footprint based on specified criteria according to household composition and 
location with the target moving towards zero organic waste to landfill. The detailed action 
plan will include a clear project timeline, supported by data collected from the National 
Waste Management Steering Committee. This action plan is envisaged to spur GT 
development in treating food waste.
6.5.1.4 Strengthening Public-Private Collaboration in R&D&C
Collaboration between the public and private entities on waste-related R&D&C project 
will be strengthened to drive commercialisation. At present, there is limited information 
sharing on Government R&D projects among different ministries. 
A loose feedback loop between the researcher and the interviewee (often the private 
industry players) also limits opportunities for the private industry to contribute ideas to 
commercialise R&D projects. New criteria will be introduced in the assessment of R&D&C 
projects to encourage the involvement of private industry players in Government funded 
R&D&C projects, especially those related to solid waste technology. A central repository 
will be made available for ease of reference, supported by inter-ministry committee 
participation in the evaluation and monitoring of R&D&C projects.


126 | Green Technology Master Plan 
6.5.1.5 Developing Market Enablers through Funding Mechanism and Creating Market 
Demand
In addition to the Government’s commitment to developing a sustainable funding 
mechanism for GT, there will be a consistent review of the existing funding mechanism.
KPKT is considering implementing a “pay as you throw” scheme, where households and 
commercial areas are charged a rate depending on the amount of waste to be disposed. 
This serves as a method to encourage waste generators to produce less waste. Other 
methods will be explored further to assess feasibility for implementation in Malaysia.
The Government will consider designing schemes to create market demand in collaboration 
with relevant Government bodies based on the types of waste. A sector lead will also be 
appointed to create market demand for solid waste products.
6.5.1.6 Developing Competencies in The Public and Private Sector
Currently, officials in the Government bodies attend local and international conferences 
to keep abreast of waste management topics. In the private sector, most of the talent is 
trained through hands-on job experience.
Competencies are recognised through NOSSs developed by the Department of Skills 
Development (JPK), which is also referenced to facilitate training programmes. The 
Government will focus on capacity building in the public by:
•	
Implementing a knowledge sharing platform amongst different ministries, such as 
KeTTHA, MGTC, KPKT, NRE and the MPOB; and
•	
Exploring the standard procedures in job hand-over in the Government bodies.
6.5.1.7 Designing and Implementing Targeted Awareness Programs through Education 
 
Planned education programmes on waste management will be implemented in 
collaboration with the Ministry of Education (MoE). Programmes will be anchored on a 
practical approach to educate the public on the importance of waste management from 
a young age. 
Promotion and awareness programmes will be designed to target stakeholders from 
all walks of life, in collaboration with other Government bodies, such as the Ministry of 
Communication and Multimedia, and the private sector, including non-Governmental 
organisations. Key topics that will be included, i.e. waste reduction, separation of waste, 
technology application, service cost and charges imposed on services. More public 
engagement initiatives will be commenced to collect feedback and to educate the public 
with regards to waste management in Malaysia. 
 


Waste | 127 
Communication strategy will be developed to ensure that the implementation is 
delivered and tailored to its target audience to maximise its impact and effectiveness. 
The communication strategy will support the long-term planning of improving financial 
sustainability of waste projects in the country.
Programmes that emphasise practical education on the importance of solid waste diversion, 
such as composting programmes at school, will be implemented by the Government to 
inculcate green culture among the youth. The approach will focus on practical experience 
by the young generation on the benefits of treating food waste. 
6.5.1.8 Improving the Strategy on the Implementation of Waste-to-Energy 
 
In preparation for the future, the Government aims to develop one (1) WtE thermal plant 
in 2020 and three (3) plants by 2030. The Government will focus its efforts on designing 
targeted:
•	
Communication strategy backed by experts: The Government will endeavour to 
fine-tune its communication strategy towards raising private awareness of the benefits 
of WtE thermal plant. For example, international speakers will be engaged to share 
their experiences and knowledge on WtE thermal plant as an alternative means to 
dispose of waste
•	
Developing alternative funding methods: High investment cost and low tipping 
fees have posed great challenges in the financial feasibility of the WtE thermal plant 
project. The Government is developing alternative funding methods to improve the 
cost structure to implement WtE thermal plant, including reviewing the existing Feed-
in-Tariff mechanism for WtE. This is in line with the Government’s commitment to 
developing sustainable financing mechanisms for green growth, as stated in RMK-11.
6.5.1.9 Extended Producer Responsibility (EPR) in Facilitating Growth in Resource 
Recovery
The management of waste started with command and control regulation where waste 
generated at the ‘end-of-pipe’ needs to be managed either by incinerating or landfilling. 
As cost for incineration and landfilling increases, focus has shifted to pollution prevention 
where industries are to implement waste minimisation programmes and adoption of 
cleaner production. 
Today managing of waste is once again undergoing another evolution. Waste is no longer 
limited to ‘end-of-pipe’ by product but extended to products development. Industries 
are responsible to collect back goods they manufactured and ensure they are safely 
disposed through the extended producer responsibility (EPR) requirement. For instance, 
the electronic industries are required to collect back the electronic waste at the end of the 
product life, as part of EPR requirement. 


128 | Green Technology Master Plan 
In the field of waste management, EPR is a strategy designed to promote the integration 
of environmental costs associated with goods throughout their life cycles into the market 
price of the products8.
With this shift in environmental control happening globally, industries will have important 
roles to play in the overall waste management cycle. The authorities and private sectors as 
important players in waste management need to stay alert on changes that is happening 
around the world to be ahead of the challenges to come.
6.5.1.10 Moving Towards a Resource-Efficient Society: TN50 Green - Waste to Wealth 
Building a resource-efficient society becomes a pre-requisite to support the Government’s 
agenda in shifting from waste management to resource efficiency. Many instruments and 
measures are required to drive the agenda with the communities. Apart from recycling 
program, it is also important to continue the development of instruments which help to 
reduce the consumption of new resources and materials through advocacy and public 
awareness initiatives.
As a leading Ministry in promoting green technology agenda, KeTTHA has launched 
TN50 Green - Waste to Wealth to create green businesses of the future and income-
earning opportunities for the rakyat by transforming waste into new sources of wealth. The 
programme was launched under the National Blue Ocean Strategy (NBOS) which will be 
implemented nationwide. The programme is intended to achieve the followings:
•	
make recycling easy and convenient for people to increase recycling rates while 
creating income-earning opportunities;
•	
accelerate mass adoption of recycling and change mindset of people by making 
recycling activities fun and entertaining while getting youth involved from an early age; 
and
•	
stimulate corporate investment in nationwide Waste to Energy businesses through 
new Public Private Partnerships (PPPs) that will integrate Government incentives 
across the chain of waste to energy.

Water | 133 
7.1 Introduction 
Water is vital to human lives and fundamental to all development. Access to clean water 
has become a major concern as water is a necessity for all socio economic activities. 
Water underpins all socio economic activities and will have direct linkages with long term 
prospect of economic growth. With rapid economic growth and accelerated urbanisation, 
the demand for water also increases and huge pressure is placed on the supply of water. 
Green growth is a new paradigm to sustain economic growth by investing in eco systems 
and natural resources including water. In fact, water is one of the critical components 
of the visible structures of the economy. By linking green growth with water resource 
management, the country can sustain the long term economic growth prospect, support 
rapid urbanisation and drive agricultural and industrial development while improving the 
resilience to water related disasters as well as be prepared for water shortage and drought 
and improve sanitation.
Climate change will affect the natural ecosystem and people through water related issues. 
Water security, access to water supply for domestic and economic activities, pollution of 
water, floods, cyclones and droughts are among the myriad of issues currently faced. The 
Government needs to urgently and strategically address these to advertise the negative 
repercussions on social, environmental and economic development of the country. 
7.2 Current Landscape 
The predominant focus of the Malaysian Government in the water sector is to improve 
water efficiency and savings through integrated water management, monitoring of water 
usage, reducing losses and non-revenue water, and boosting overall water availability and 
reliability. The provision of quality and efficient water and sewerage services is essential in 
ensuring a high quality of life and facilitating economic development. The Government has 
started several initiatives that have been adopted such as applying water efficient system 
and appliances such as rainwater harvesting systems, smart monitoring and metering 
equipment, advanced leak detection equipment, non-revenue water control software, 
low-loss distribution equipment and storage equipment.
The existing water supply sector is heavily dependent on the country’s freshwater reserves 
and tapping on surface water (especially rivers and dams) from rainfall. However, rainfall 
is unevenly distributed throughout the country. This, accompanied by the supply driven 
management of water, and a growing population, put tremendous pressure on existing 
water resources. In recent years, the country has experienced the effects of unprecedented 
climate change such as drought and El Nino, which further increased the pressure on 
water resources. These issues have resulted in certain states in Malaysia reaching their 
practical limit of surface water resource.

Towards becoming a sustainable high income nation, the Government has recognised 
the need to be more efficient in its water management. Figure 7.1 illustrates the Review of 
the National Water Resources Study (2000-2050). To address the rising pressure on water 
resources, and improve water conservation and efficiency, the Government’s efforts have 
been focused on the following strategic areas:
•	
Integrated river basin management;
•	
Water treatment and distribution technology, especially on Non-Revenue Water (NRW) 
management;
•	
Water utilisation technology, i.e. the introduction of water efficient products; and
•	
Water harvesting technology, specifically on Rainwater Harvesting Systems (RHS).
7.3 Issues and Challenges 
Due to urbanisation and rapid economic development, the provision of quality water and 
sewerage services has become more challenging to the Government. Different issues and 
challenges are identified in the water supply industry and wastewater treatment industry: 
7.3.1 Water Supply Industry
7.3.1.1 Reliability of Water Supply
Since more than 90% of water supply in Malaysia is from rivers, optimisation of the yields 
from unregulated flows of rivers is crucial in water supply management. Some states have 
also faced deficit of unregulated river flows. Pollution of rivers, changing of rainfall patterns 
and rising sea levels have also impacted water sources. Besides that, development of new 
areas and expansion of economic activities have also increased the demand of water 
supply.
1Department of Irrigation and Drainage Malaysia, 2011


Water | 135 
7.3.1.2 Non-Revenue Water (NRW)
In 2015, NRW was recorded at 35.5% and the main factors contributed to the higher NRW 
were physical losses due to old network of pipes and poor workmanship by contractors 
especially in new development areas, commercial losses and also lack of knowledge and 
expertise in NRW.
7.3.1.3 Limited Coverage of Clean and Treated Water
Water supply coverage in the rural areas of Kelantan, Sabah and Sarawak is lower than the 
national average of 92.5%. For Sabah and Sarawak the scenario is due to their remoteness 
locations, low population density, difficult terrain and poor infrastructure access, which 
require high cost in providing water supply. Even though there is accessibility for water 
supply in Kelantan, the premises with connected services is low as there are other 
alternative sources, i.e groundwater to be used.
The water services industry is not self sustaining due to two (2) main issues which are high 
cost of operation and low tariff. This resulted in the industry not being sustainable.
7.3.2 Wastewater Treatment Industry
7.3.2.1 High Operational and Maintenance Cost
The service operators of sewage treatment plants are faced with high operational and 
maintenance costs while revenue from sewage tariffs are below the costs. Furthermore, 
higher costs are needed to upgrade the old sewage treatment plants.
7.3.2.2 Environmental Threats from Non-Connected Systems
The non-connected systems such as septic tank and pour flush systems mostly found 
in suburban and rural areas, discharge untreated effluent and sludge directly into water 
bodies.
7.4 Existing Initiatives 
There are a lot of KeTTHA initiatives which have been implemented by the key stakeholders 
in the Malaysian water sector such as Suruhanjaya Perkhidmatan Air Negara (SPAN), 
Department of Irrigation and Drainage (DID), Indah Water Konsortium (IWK) and Jabatan 
Perkhidmatan Pembetungan (JPP). Among others, the initiatives include:
•	
Integrated river basin management
•	
Water treatment and distribution

 Rationalisation of small STPs;

 Targeted promotion at local authorities to promote the use of reclaimed water;

 On-going R&D&C collaboration with local universities;
7.4.1 Integrated River Basin Management (IRBM)
Rivers are key source of water supply to the country. According to the Department of 
Irrigation and Drainage (DID), there are about 150 river systems in Peninsular Malaysia and 
50 river systems in Sabah and Sarawak. (Table 7.1)
Despite being endowed with an abundance of natural resources, water supply shortage 
is still experienced in certain states. Seasonal distribution of rainfall together with rapid 
economic growth, as well as urbanisation and migration in certain regions have rendered 
a higher ratio of population to the capacity of river basin which can support the demand 
for fresh water supply in some regions. Some of the challenges facing the country include:
•	
Flooding, especially flash flood in urban areas;
•	
River and water pollution;
•	
River sedimentation; and
•	
Presence of squatters within river reserves.

To manage the water resources in the country, the Government has introduced Integrated 
River Basin Management (IRBM), which is defined as the coordinated management of 
resources in natural environment (air, water, land, flora, fauna) based on river basin as a 
geographical unit, with the objective of balancing man's need with necessity of conserving 
resources to ensure their sustainability. 
There are 8 components under IRBM namely: Enforcement; Institution; Legislation; Public 
awareness; Preventive; Curative; Planning; and Finance. To support IRBM, One State 
One River Programme was introduced in 2002. The programme required each state to 
select, with the agreement of State Government one polluted river to be rehabilitated. The 
rehabilitation programme is to be carried out over a 10 to 15 years’ time frame with several 
short-term programmes. Key areas for GT application is as follows:

Several water operators are reported to be innovative in improving cost efficiency of water 
treatment at their plants. Amongst the initiatives is the use of energy efficient water pump, 
and by addressing the high non-revenue water (NRW). The Government has allocated a 
substantial amount of budget for the NRW Programme. NRW is critical to be addressed, 
especially in urban areas such as Kuala Lumpur as it reflects inefficiency in demand 
management. The National Water Resource Study forecasted the total water demand in 
Kuala Lumpur in 2015 is about 943 MLD, of which NRW constitutes about 270 MLD.
 
In line with the GT’s definition, decreasing wastage of treated water by reducing NRW 
helps to manage resources efficiently. Maintaining the quality of piping used in distribution 
channels and controlling leakage are among the areas where GT could play a role. 
Managing NRW helps to shift towards a closed loop system by preventing clean water 
from being wasted.
As of 2016, IRBM had covered a total area of 68,474km2 throughout Peninsular Malaysia. 
By 2020, an additional 46,257.63km2 areas will be covered, primarily in Penang, Kedah, 
Greater KL, Melaka, Johor, Pahang Terengganu, Sabah and Sarawak.

7.4.2.1 Non-Revenue Water (NRW) Action Plan and Reduction Program
Since 2008, SPAN has been managing NRW, and in 2011 had organised an NRW national 
workshop to raise awareness of the issue. Following the workshop, a Special Task Force 
was formed to provide expertise on NRW and monitor NRW implementation issues. A 
comprehensive Action Plan, a policy framework and a reduction programme to decrease 
NRW was developed.
The NRW initiatives put in place include:
•	
Implementing NRW as Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) imposed on all water 
distribution operators;
•	
All operators are required to submit a quarterly report on NRW volumes; 
•	
NRW controls are monitored on a quarterly basis; and
•	
NRW audits by SPAN are continuously carried out. 
The priority for the Government in the next three (3) years is for all water distribution 
operators to address to the physical and commercial losses in the Water Balance, and 
the development of Action Plans. To do so, the Government has finalised the NRW Action 
Plan in 2013, which focuses on improving the NRW policy framework in the country. The 
Action Plan3 comprises of eight strategies:
•	
Holistic NRW management;
•	
Management concept of “Preventive Compared to Reactive”;
•	
Sustainable funding;
•	
Effective mechanism for monitoring of NRW management;
•	
Development of effective organisation structure;
•	
Human capacity building in managing NRW;
•	
Improvement of Research, Development and Innovation in managing NRW; and
•	
Public Education and Awareness Programme on NRW management.
7.4.3 Water Utilisation	
RMK11 focuses on improving efficiency of the water services industry towards achieving 
long-term financial sustainability and continuous renewal of water as a resource. Aside 
from conservation efforts, water savings by the end-user is also being encouraged through 
water utilisation technology. Implementing water-efficient products is a way to reduce 
water wastage.

7.4.3.1 Water Efficient Products Labelling Scheme (WEPLS)
The Government has introduced WEPLS to enhance consumers’ awareness on the 
importance of reducing water consumption. In 2013, water efficient products contributed 
about RM111.1 million towards Malaysia’s GDP
. The enforcement of mandatory usage 
of water efficient product for sanitary ware will increase the GDP contribution to about 
RM464.3 million by 2020 and RM965.9 million by 20304. 
Products that can be registered under WEPLS are: 
•	
Water tap;
•	
Water closet;
•	
Urinal;
•	
Washing machine; and 
•	
Showerhead.
The existing initiatives in advocating water efficiency are primarily on institutional framework 
through WEPLS. The scheme was initiated by SPAN in Jan 2013 as voluntary programme 
but it will be mandatory by 2019 to register and label water-efficient products. The WEPLS 
label informs consumers of the product’s water efficiency rating, which helps to increase 
consumers’ understanding of the product and allows them to factor this information into 
their purchasing decisions. The Scheme aims to raise awareness of the availability of 
water-efficient products in Malaysia whilst encouraging suppliers to participate in the 
development of the water-efficient technology in Malaysia.
Products to be registered under WEPLS must be tested for their water efficiency according 
to the WEPLS Guidelines published by SPAN. The testing is carried out by independent 
testing laboratories that are recognised by SPAN, and accredited under the National 
Laboratory Accreditation Scheme. 
More about WEPLS:
•	
Registered products are given a WEPLS label displaying key information, e.g. star 
rating, water efficiency, registration number and product-specific information, 
including brand and model; and
•	
Products are rated according to their nominal flow rates. The higher the water efficiency 
grade, the more stars they are awarded. Ratings are between one to three stars, and 
products with an automated shut-off device receive an extra star.
 
7.4.4 Water Harvesting 
Water harvesting technology refers to the optimisation of available water resources, 
encompassing water collection, storage, treatment and harvesting techniques. The water 
resources include rainwater, surface water (such as runoffs), groundwater, treated effluent 
or grey water. 
Malaysia receives 1 trillion cubic metres of annual rainfall, of which 93% is not collected 
for resource optimisation, especially for non-potable use. Freshwater abstraction is only 
2% in the country. 
4 Economic Assessment on the Green Business Environment in Malaysia, PwC Consulting 
Services (M) Sdn Bhd (“PwC”), 2014.


140 | Green Technology Master Plan 
Capturing rainwater and using it for non-potable purposes strengthens the closed loop 
system by preventing wastage of clean water and maximising usage of resources. (Table 
7.2)
The Government has been active in encouraging the adoption of rainwater harvesting 
systems (RHSs) in Malaysia since 1998. In 1999, the Cabinet discussed and approved 
the RHS Guideline. The Rainwater Harvesting Guidebook was published in 2009. In 
2012, the Government amended the 1984 UBBL, which requires newly-built buildings 
with a roof area of 100 square meters and above to be equipped with RHSs. In 2013, 
RHS is estimated to contribute about RM5.6 million to Malaysia’s GDP
. Training course 
programme for RHSs in buildings was released in 2014. The Government aims to increase 
the freshwater abstraction rate to 10% by 2025 and 15% by 2030. This includes the target 
of implementing RHSs in 60% of towns nationwide by 2020. RHS’s GDP contribution is 
likely to increase to RM364.8 million (2020) and RM758.9 million (2030) if the UBBL on 
RHS is enforced on all new properties in Malaysia.
The Government has been implementing promotion and awareness programmes in 
the country on RHS specifically. Collaboration with the private sector is also fostered 
to strengthen the institutional framework for the industry. NAHRIM facilitated the 
establishment of the Malaysia Rainwater Harvesting Systems Association (PERSPAH).
7.4.4.1 Promotion and Awareness Programmes 
NAHRIM initiated six programmes to raise awareness among the public, private players 
and Non-Governmental Organisations (NGOs) on the benefits of installing RHSs. 
These include:
•	
Raising awareness at primary and secondary schools through collaboration with the 
NGO Treat Every Environment Special Sdn. Bhd. (TrEES);
•	
Hosting technical and academic site visits by the public and educational institutions 
at several RHS locations, such as Zoo Negara, the Selangor State Government Office, 
Paya Indah Wetlands and Incubator NAHRIM;

residential buildings, religious sites, public spaces, Government headquarters and 
traditional infrastructures; and
•	
Providing consultancy and technical advisory on RHS for the public, private players 
and Government agencies that are required to install or construct RHSs on their 
premises.
7.4.4.2 Collaboration with Industry Associations 
NAHRIM has been in active discussion with PERSPAH on several RHS issues, including the 
limited common standards and guidelines on design, materials, pumps, filtration systems, 
storage systems, tank sizing, and maintenance schedule and water quality. Action plans 
that have been developed through these discussions include:
•	
Promoting rainwater harvesting as a solution to water scarcity, which aims to increase 
the take up rate for RHSs and reduce water demand for treated water;
•	
Producing a comprehensive technical guideline on RHS, including design, materials, 
pumps, filtration systems, storage systems, tank sizing, maintenance scheduling and 
water quality; and
•	
Collaboration amongst several stakeholders, including the Government, private 
sector, the public and NGOs to enforce related laws and knowledge transfer of RHS 
technologies from Germany and Australia.
7.4.5 Wastewater Treatment 
7.4.5.1 Recycling Treated Effluent and Sludge	
	
	
	
	
 
In 2016, there are more than 9,700 sewage treatment plants in Malaysia. About 6,500 
consists of public Sewage Treatment Plants (STPs). Among the public sewage treatment 
plants, 90 STPs are identified as potential STPs capable of producing treated effluent and 
sludge.
Instead of releasing the treated effluent to the environment, treated effluent should be 
further treated as reclaimed water for non-potable application to reduce the pressure on 
existing potable water supply. Reclaimed water is recommended for application of non-
food related field i.e. non-food crop agriculture and non-food related industry application. 
It can be delivered to the end user via a closed loop system or by tankers. 


142 | Green Technology Master Plan 
Sludge from STPs can be recycled as biosolids which is recommended for application 
as fertiliser for non-food crop agriculture, energy production and raw materials for other 
green technology products.
Key success factors for this initiative include conducting various awareness and 
communication programs, setting up incentives and establishing the necessary policy 
and regulatory support. 
As of 2015, there were 3.4 million accounts for connected sewerage services with a 
handling capacity of 26.1 million population equivalent (PE). Seven states (7) registered 
more than the national average handling capacity, with the Federal Territory of Putrajaya 
achieving 100% coverage of connected sewerage services. The extensive coverage of 
sewage treatment in some states indicates the immense potential for treated effluent and 
sludge recycling program at regional or central treatment plants.
The Government is aiming to recycle one third of treated effluent by 2030. The use of 
recycled sludge as fertilisers for municipal landscape plants reduces CO2 emissions by 
3 MTCO2eq, compared to disposal at municipal landfill sites. By 2030, the Government 
targets to maximise the potential of sewage by increasing the recycling rate of sludge to 
100%. The sludge shall also be tapped for RE purposes to generate electricity for the 
usage at the sewage treatment plants. 
7.4.5.2 Technical Standards for the Recycling of Treated Effluent and Composting of 
Sludge
SPAN is developing the technical standards for the recycling of treated effluent and sludge. 
Inputs from the industries are retrieved to ensure that all technical aspects of treated 
effluent and sludge recycling are sound.
7.4.5.3 Targeted Promotion of Reclaimed Water and Biosolids
Promotion and awareness programs have been conducted to increase acceptance of 
reclaimed water and biosolids. Participation from various stakeholders have shown 
positive uptake on the utilisation of reclaimed water and biosolids. Some Malaysian local 
authorities have been using reclaimed water and biosolids for landscaping. In addition to 
that, the private sector has utilised reclaimed water at construction sites.
Did you know?
There are important nutrients such as sulphur, phosphorus, organic matters in sewage sludge 
which are valuable resources. In 2013, Denmark recycled 50 – 55% of sludge through exploiting 
the phosphorus in the ash from incinerating sludge as fertiliser or by spreading it on agricultural 
soil. Denmark aspires to recycle 80% of the phosphorus in the sludge by 2018.

7.4.5.4 On-Going Research, Development and Commercialisation (R&D&C) Collaboration 
with Local Universities
Various R&D projects have been initiated to improve both the quantity and quality of 
reclaimed water and biosolids. These include:
•	
Sewage sludge as a fertiliser for various crops;
•	
Sludge as soil amendment;
•	
Co-composting of sewage sludge;
•	
Effectiveness of sludge lagoons in Malaysia;
•	
Application of sewage sludge in forest rehabilitation and regeneration;
•	
Dewatering of waste sludge by two stage integrated technique;
•	
Sludge thickening and dewatering using natural local polymer; and
•	
Drying of sludge for building material application.
Among the R&D projects carried out, selective success outcomes have been identified as 
potential commercial products to targeted industries. 
7.5 Way Forward 
In its transition towards becoming a high income nation, the Government of Malaysia 
has adopted a demand driven approach to manage water resources in the country. The 
primary target of the Government is to ensure accessibility to clean water for 99% of the 
population by 2020. The following are the initiatives which will be prioritised in the coming 
years:
Water treatment and distribution  
•	
National NRW Reduction Program;
•	
Water Demand Management Master Plan;
Water utilisation 
•	
Formation of R&D&C fund among private players and strengthening of existing 
Government funded R&D&C mechanism on water sector;
•	
Educational-based promotion and awareness programme and enhancement of 
WEPLS;
•	
Long-term plan in matching water demand and supply at an effective water tariff 
rate;
Water harvesting 
•	
Implementation strategy for rainwater harvesting systems;
•	
Master Plan for urban cities with sustainable water and environment;
•

•	
Integrated Urban Water Cycle Planning and Management (IUWCM);
Wastewater treatment 
•	
National Sewerage Catchment Plan;
•	
Integrated Resource Recovery Centre;
Strengthening regulatory framework 
•	
Amendment of Act 655 & 654;
•	
Tariff setting mechanism (TSM);
•	
Water Services Restructuring;


144 | Green Technology Master Plan 
7.5.1 Water Treatment and Distribution 
The upcoming initiatives will be focused on strengthening the institutional framework via 
policy development:
7.5.1.1 National NRW Reduction Program
The Government has outlined National NRW Reduction Program for all NRW actions in the 
next three years (2017-2020), which consist of valuing short-term projects, quick wins and 
higher impact programmes. The Government is targeting to reduce national NRW levels to 
25% by 2025, and 15% by 2030.
7.5.1.2 Master Plan on Water Demand Management
The Government will develop a Master Plan on water demand management, which aims to 
provide tools to forecast water demand. Priority will be given to reduce the use of treated 
water for non-potable uses and revision of tariffs. In addition, promotional and educational 
programmes will be intensified to promote the efficient and prudent use of water in all 
related economic sectors, especially the agriculture sector, which comprises 68% of total 
water consumption in Malaysia but also contributes about 10% to Malaysian GDP
. 
Long-term plan on the following will also be developed:
•	
Increase efficient use of treated water for industrial purposes;
•	
Address the water demand in water-stressed states, especially in urban areas, and 
also improving the irrigation efficiency for the agriculture sector using an integrated 
water management approach;
•	
Improve awareness on the importance of conserving water as a resource; and
•	
Implement tariff setting mechanism that reflects the true cost of water, including the 
environmental costs.
Stakeholder engagement with the State Government will be initiated to understand the 
concerns and challenges in each state, in order to design specific strategies to monitor 
and encourage collaboration at state and local authority levels. Some of the initiatives for 
GT applications include:
•	
Increase usage of recycle water  for industrial & non-potable usage towards minimum 
discharge with the application of green technology; and
•	
The construction of wetlands to avoid direct discharge to water bodies.
7.5.2 Water Utilisation 
Given the challenges Malaysia face with water deficiency in some states, the Government 
has prioritised water-efficient products and encouraged a demand-driven market for these 
products. In particular, the Government has implemented the following initiatives:


Water | 145 
7.5.2.1 Strengthening Existing Research, Development and Commercialisation (R&D&C) 
Management Mechanism
The existing cross-ministerial mechanism in the management of the Government’s R&D&C 
fund, that is the Public Funds Investment Committee or Jawatankuasa Pengurusan Dana 
Awam (JKPDA), will be strengthened to facilitate public-private R&D projects on water 
security.
A working group consisting of NRE, MOSTI, the Ministry of Higher Education (MOHE), 
KeTTHA (including SPAN and the Sewerage Services Department), water operators and 
technology providers will be established. This serves as a platform to enable knowledge 
exchange on various R&D efforts currently undertaken by the Government among different 
ministries. 
At present, there are limited platforms for knowledge sharing on R&D efforts which are 
undertaken by different ministries. The establishment of a knowledge sharing mechanism 
is essential to facilitate the identification of opportunities for more collaboration and 
effective resource utilisation. 
Leveraging on the incentives in place for R&D, existing private players will be encouraged 
to establish an industry fund to finance R&D projects in the water sector. This will ensure 
that the projects are outcome-driven and targeted for commercialisation. In collaboration 
with State Governments, SPAN will encourage the water and sewerage operators to:
•	
Explore their readiness in contributing to the R&D&C fund;
•	
Understand their needs in terms of technological support;
•	
Identify and create enablers to encourage their participation;
•	
Determine clearly the objectives and the use of the fund;
7.5.2.2 Promotion and Awareness
A fact-based educational approach is under planning to improve the effectiveness of 
promotion and awareness programmes. SPAN plans to conduct a water consumption 
study in collaboration with KeTTHA at five academic institutions. These studies will 
analyse the use of water amongst students. Subsequently, educational programmes will 
be conducted to increase students’ awareness of the importance of saving water.
7.5.2.3 Enhancement of Water Efficient Product Labelling Scheme (WEPLS) 
The Government is developing a comprehensive strategic plan to enhance the effectiveness 
of the WEPLS and target promotional campaigns at suppliers and consumers. Apart from 
this, the Government is also planning to implement the WEPLS as mandatory legislation, 
which will be applied to both local and imported products by 2019.
7.5.2.4 Long-Term Plan in Matching Water Demand and Supply at an Effective Water Tariff 
Rate
The existing water tariff rate is unable to incentivise water savings at the consumers’ end. 
A long term plan in matching water demand and supply at an effective water tariff rate will 
be developed to prepare for the transition towards sustainable development. 


146 | Green Technology Master Plan 
The long term plan will consider the following aspects:
•	
Improved access to quality water supply and reduced supply interruption;
•	
Gradual increase in the water tariff rate based on water consumption and income 
growth rate, supported by incentives; and
•	
Strategic pilot projects will be studied and formulated to encourage water savings at 
targeted communities.
7.5.3 Water Harvesting 
7.5.3.1 Implementation Strategy for Rainwater Harvesting System
The Government’s strategy to further implement RHSs includes:
•	
Developing and upgrading RHS infrastructure to improve storm water management;
•	
Incorporate requirements for selected public institutions (such as schools, hospitals 
and military camps) to install RHSs as determined by the Government;
•	
Promoting harvested rainwater as an alternative source of water; and
•	
Enhancing stakeholder participation and awareness of RHSs, especially collaboration 
with MIDA to leverage on GITA to encourage existing buildings to adopt RHSs.
7.5.3.2 Master Plan for Urban Cities with Sustainable Water and Environment
Currently, NAHRIM has been entrusted by the National Water Resources Council and 
the Ministry of Federal Territories to conduct a study titled “Urban Conjunctive Water 
Resources for Kuala Lumpur Independent Water Supply”, which is a 2016 to 2018 Master 
Plan for urban cities with sustainable water and environment.
7.5.3.3 Public-Private Collaboration to create Market Enablers
Moving forward, NAHRIM will collaborate with PERSPAH and other Government bodies 
to support:
•	
Producing local products with more variety of RHSs;
•	
Setting relatively competitive prices for local products compared to imported products; 
•	
Providing tax exemption on R&D developments of local RHS products; and
•	
Offering attractive funds for the development of RHS technologies and products.
7.5.3.4 Integrated Urban Water Cycle Planning and Management (IUWCM)
Apart from rainwater, there is a need to explore the use of water harvesting technologies 
on other type of water resources, especially in water-stressed states which receive less 
rainfall but have high water demand. In particular, the State Government of water-stressed 
states such as Penang, Perlis, Kedah, Selangor and Melaka will need to take the lead in 
this exercise since the jurisdiction of water supply and distribution overlaps between the 
state and federal Government. 


Water | 147 
Mapping of water demand and supply (resources) will be commissioned to identify the 
most cost-effective alternative water resource option. Existing Government Research 
Institutes such as NAHRIM will be leveraged to embark on its existing research to improve 
efficiency in water management. Collaboration among various Government entities such 
as KeTTHA and NRE (Department of Irrigation and Drainage) will be strengthened to 
explore water harvesting and storage technology and also its application in urban areas 
facing water scarcity issues.
The Integrated Urban Water Management (IUWM) represents the managed hydrological 
cycles and systems of a Water Sensitive City. In short, IUWCM offers 'broader solutions' 
that satisfy the water-sensitive urban design and 'liveable cities and towns' objectives. 
IUWCM is one of the pioneer research projects conducted in Malaysia by NAHRIM with 
selected pilot study in the KL City. This project has been approved in RMK 11 with the 
implementation study’s duration of 3 years starting from 2017 till 2019. The Integrated 
Urban Water Cycle (IUWC) practices propose water conservation and efficient use of 
water.
It is believed that the IUWCM in the KL region can potentially provide at least 40% 
independence in relation to the existing treated water supply. Under this project, the 
KL region is demarcated into 10 zones, involving approximately 1.5 million people. This 
project will identify alternative water resources which are highly available to function as 
supplementary water supply. Subsequently, this will reduce the dependence on treated 
water supply for non-potable uses. As a result, the decentralised water supply will also 
reduce NRW in the system. 
To support IUWCM, the following initiatives are put in place:
•	
Promotion and awareness programme led by NRE and KeTTHA, as well as NAHRIM, 
The programme will focus on strengthening the implementation of GT in water related 
infrastructure and facility for water sustainable development and climate resilience;
•	
Human capital development via knowledge and technology transfer – a series 
of technical capability building, on job training on modelling and design, water 
management exposure and involvement in international or local conference, seminar, 
forum and workshop will be rolled out;
•	
R&D&C – Higher involvement of key players in the water and water supply industry to 
look into localised technologies, such as water treatment system (nano technology), 
filtration (membrane technology), modernised water treatment plant and decentralised 
treatment plant with GT application;
•	
Market enablers – IUWCM will be included in Government projects and premises 
through the Government green procurement;
Integrated with other types of technologies, the various sources of water can be optimised 
for its intended use. In other words, the value of various sources of water is optimised 
to address the water demand for different purposes. Consequently, the cost of treating 
water (which is also associated with the energy needs), will be reduced. Water resources 
are better conserved to ensure the sustainable supply of freshwater while minimising the 
impact to the environment.

7.5.4.1 National Sewerage Catchment Plan (NSCP)
The NSCP is being formulated by SPAN in accordance to the provisions in Suruhanjaya 
Perkhidmatan Air Negara Act 2006 (Act 654). This document will encompass sewerage 
planning policy and strategies that will cover the planning needs of the nation. This 
document will be used as a guide to prepare a sewerage development plan that is 
appropriate for the needs of the area, to determine the investment required for sewerage 
infrastructure that will consider the whole life cycle cost, to encourage resource recovery 
from point source up to by-products of sewage treatment and to facilitate inter agency 
coordination. The NSCP will also include strategic plans on the identification of catchment 
areas and the rationalisation of treatment plants. Last but not least, it is also to be used 
as a guide to promote participation amongst stakeholders in order to create awareness 
within the sewerage sector.
7.5.4.2 Receiving of Trade Effluent into Public STP 
Public sewage treatment plant is aiming to receive trade effluent from industry in view of 
reducing pollution at point source to the environment. It is not only intended to reduce the 
enforcement and monitoring cost from the Government but also to integrate treatment 
plants.

Water | 149 
Currently the stakeholders are in the middle of developing the necessary policy, legislation 
and guideline on trade effluent. A feasibility study and a pilot study on receiving trade 
effluent are also in the pipeline. 
7.5.4.3 Integrated Resources Recovery Center (IRRC)
All organic water in terms of liquid and solids will be treated in the IRRC to leverage on 
the facilities for the wastewater treatment plant and the digester. This will help to promote 
the production of reclaimed water and the generation of more gases for electricity or 
biomethane as fuel. Several locations have been identified as potential sites for future 
development of IRRC.
7.5.5 Strengthening Regulatory Framework
7.5.5.1 Amendment of Act 655 & 654
The Water Services Commission Act 2006 (Act 654) and Water Services Industry Act 2006 
(Act 655) came into effect in year 2008. In the past 9 years, SPAN noticed that there 
were various policy changes and unclear interpretation leading to weak implementation 
and enforcement activities. Therefore, SPAN proposed 51 amendments to Act 655 and 
4 amendments to Act 654 to address the limitations of existing provisions in order to 
improve effective implementation and enforcement of these acts.
7.5.5.2 Tariff Setting Mechanism (TSM)
Tariff setting mechanism (TSM) is a robust, fair and transparent tariff setting process to 
ensure full cost recovery of the water industry. It is conceptualised from the Regulatory 
Water Accounting (RWA) framework in promoting the transparency of financial information 
and performance of water operators where information on costs and performance levels 
will be disclosed to consumers who will then know what they are paying for and what they 
are getting in return. In the short and medium term, the increasing block tariff model is 
adopted under TSM, where moderate to heavy users will be charged at full supply costs. 
Whereas in the long term, tariff model for domestic and non-domestic should be based 
on Uniform Volumetric Charge, where users pay a flat rate for the cost of water services. 
In setting the base for the implementation of TSM, SPAN has conducted a few related 
studies on RWA and cost benchmarking for the water services industry. KeTTHA and SPAN 
plan to implement TSM in stages, starting off with a tariff structure harmonisation, followed 
by a gradual increase in tariff rate. Moving forward, SPAN will conduct stakeholders’ 
engagement to solicit feedback and to get buy-in prior to nationwide implementation.

are 
Essential to Pave the Way for Green 
Technology Development
To shift into GT development mode, 
the Government has outlined its plans 
in creating conducive ecosystems for 
GT growth. Five strategic thrusts were 
identified in the NGTP
, in line with RMK-
11. The GTMP outlines the key areas 
for improvement identified under each 
strategic thrust in the next five years. To 
complement the NGTP
, each strategic 
thrust will outline specific outcomes to 
be achieved, providing the fundamentals 
to establishing conducive ecosystems 
for GT development.
Efforts need to be intensified, especially 
to inculcate a green culture and lifestyle 
which creates the essential market 
demand for driving GT innovation and 
growth.  The aspiration is to transform 
Malaysia into a GT hub post-2020.

8.2 Strategic Thrust 1: Promotion and Awareness
8.2.1 Changing the Mindset of the Rakyat to Embark on a Green Lifestyle
Exposure to technological advancements and their benefits help the public understand 
the importance of GT, subsequently improving their receptiveness and willingness to 
adopt GT. 
At present, GT promotion and awareness programmes are executed via three key 
platforms:
•	
Website portals, roadshows, advertisement, social platforms and flyers;
•	
International Greentech & Eco Products Exhibitions & Conference Malaysia (IGEM); 
and
•	
Awareness programmes via education.
In recent years, there has been a shift to more innovative ways of promotion that leverage 
on information communication technology, demonstrated in the increasing use of social 
platforms and website portals.
8.2.2 Moving Forward
There will be increased public consultations and communications with four target 
audiences (Figure 8.2) which will be well-thought out and prioritised based on the desired 
outcomes that the respective agencies aim to achieve. 
The communication strategies employed will be focused on advocating a green lifestyle 
and the mode of communication will be differentiated according to the needs of the 
specific target audience.

Promotion and awareness in cultivating a green lifestyle will require cross-sectoral 
collaboration among KeTTHA, NRE, MOSTI, MOE, MOHE and other stakeholders. 
In addition, proactive engagement with the NGOs will also be fostered to increase the 
coverage of the promotional programmes on green lifestyle to civil society.
8.2.3 Preparing the Future Generation for Green Lifestyle 
8.2.3.1 Awareness Programmes via Education
To inculcate the green culture in local communities, it is important to start the awareness 
at a young age. This will equip the future generation with relevant GT knowledge, helping 
them to understand the benefits of GT to drive behavioural change. As a consequence, the 
larger community will be impacted through their interaction with the family and community. 
At present, promotion and awareness programmes for the younger generation is 
undertaken by:
•	
Yayasan Hijau Malaysia (YaHijau); and 
•	
Centre for Education, Training, and Research in Renewable Energy and Energy 
Efficiency (CETREE).

Strategic Thrusts | 157 
Figure 8.3: YaHijau’s two pronged approach4
8.2.3.2 Yayasan Hijau Malaysia (YaHijau)
YaHijau was launched in 2014 with the objective of promoting and educating the public, 
especially the youth, on the importance of GT and sustainable living. YaHijau adopts an 
integrated approach in its initiatives with both students and communities to transform the 
mindset towards GT.
YaHijau has conducted corporate social responsibility initiatives, activities and 
sponsorships that have been important in encouraging corporations, communities and the 
public in adopting green practices. Examples of these are through their YaHijau Carnival, 
Green Youth and Green Education programs.
8.2.3.3 Centre for Education, Training and Research in Renewable Energy and Energy 
Efficiency (CETREE)
The inception of CETREE in 2000 marked the Government's commitment in establishing 
a centre to provide education and training, especially in renewable energy and energy 
efficiency, for professionals, schools, tertiary institutions and the public in Malaysia.
Over the years, the role of CETREE has evolved, increasingly focusing on equipping 
students with GT knowledge which can be practically applied in their daily routine. The 
existing target audience of CETREE are primarily secondary school children throughout 
the country.
8.2.3.4 Cross Curriculum Education Modules
The shared objectives have brought YaHijau and CETREE together, in collaboration 
with Universiti Sains Malaysia and MOE to develop the GT Cross Curriculum Education 
Modules for secondary schools. The implementing agency of the project is CETREE, with 
the following objectives: 
•	
Training teachers in GT methodologies and implementation; and 
•	
Educating secondary school children on GT.
The project is also augmented with school competitions on GT at the state and national 
levels which create and sustain interest in GT. The Modules will be extended to primary 
schools, with a target roll out by 2020, benefitting 7,769 primary schools. Besides the six 
sectors in the GTMP
, the modules also cover agriculture and forestry to provide a holistic 
concept of GHG emissions.

8.2.4 Creating a multiplier effect, reaching out to larger communities
Further outreach which blends the youth activities into the community is achieved through 
the YaHijau Carnivals and eco-youth camps.  
Figure 8.4 shows the different types of green education modules, the topics they cover 
and how widespread their reach has been.
8.2.4.1 Moving Forward
The target audience of the GT programmes will encompass people from all walks of 
life, starting from a wider outreach to school communities followed by communities at 
grassroots level. 
Besides the existing initiatives, YaHijau proactively looks for other platforms to convey the 
green lifestyle message (Figure 8.5). It is exploring the possibility of inserting its initiatives 
into universities and the healthcare industry.

For rural areas, YaHijau awareness programmes will target indigenous communities, who 
depend on the environment for their livelihood. YaHijau’s campaigns will be designed to 
communicate the benefits that GT can bring to these remote communities in preserving 
the environment. 
CETREE will continue to collaborate with MOE to accumulate knowledge and increase 
awareness of Green Technology among school children.
8.3 Strategic Thrust 2: Market Enablers
8.3.1 Creating the market demand and supply for GT
Since the introduction of the NGTP
, the Government has initiated various programmes to 
facilitate industry growth in the GT domain. The key market enablers include:
•	
FiT;
•	
Eco-labelling mechanism;
•	
Tax incentives and duty exemptions; and 
•	
GTFS.
In the next 5 years, resources will be focused on the following market enablers, not only 
to stimulate GT adoption, but also to shift economic development towards green growth:
•	
Government Green Procurement (GGP);
•	
Green financing;
•	
Green incentives;
•	
Green cities; and 
•	
International collaboration.

Figure 8.5: Programmes under YaHijau’s exploration and planning6


160 | Green Technology Master Plan 
8.3.1.1 Government Green Procurement (GGP)
Government procurement in Malaysia is a significant socioeconomic catalyst as it 
represents about 13.2% of GDP and public expenditure is expected to grow. 
By assuming a leadership role in encouraging green purchasing, the Government will 
encourage businesses to realign their products and services to the new “green’ demands 
of the market.
Therefore, in the RMK-11 period, a target has been set for 20% of Government procurement 
to be green by 2020.  One of the benefits of the GGP is the anticipated cumulative savings 
of about RM390 million in electricity bills during this period with an associated reduction 
of 0.7 MtCO2eq. 
Currently, the number of green products and services which qualify for GGP is limited. 
The Government has mandated MGTC to strategise the direction of GGP programmes, 
assessing their implementation across ministries, undertaking lifecycle cost trainings and 
reporting on progress and impact. To prepare for GGP
, MGTC launched the MyHIJAU 
Programme with its two-pronged approach in 2012. 
The MyHIJAU Programme includes a labelling scheme (MyHIJAU Mark) and a long-term 
programme for industry (MyHIJAU SME & Entrepreneur Development Programme). While 
the MyHIJAU Mark facilitates green purchasing, the SME & Entrepreneur Development 
Programme focuses on a long-term shift of business operations towards sustainability.
8.3.1.2 MyHIJAU Mark
Rapid growth in GT globally has led to the proliferation of numerous labels for green and 
eco-products. To reduce confusion, The MyHIJAU Mark is the integrated mark that brings 
together various eco-labels and environmental certifications under one common mark for 
GGP reference and are compiled in a single reference i.e. the MyHIJAU Directory. 
Figure 8.6 shows the number of products, services and companies registered under the 
MyHijau Programme. Both local and foreign certification partners have collaborated in the 
programme.
Figure 8.6: Achievements of MyHijau Programme as of 20167
7 Malaysian Green Technology Corporation (MGTC), 2017


Strategic Thrusts | 161 
The MyHIJAU Mark is in line with the Government's shift to sustainable procurement 
practices which subsequently incentivises entrepreneurs and businesses to explore green 
growth opportunities. To achieve this, the MyHIJAU Mark plans to implement the following 
actions:
•	
Market research to study the readiness of suppliers and determine the availability of 
selected product groups in meeting these demands. The identified gaps would be 
addressed to formulate a more targeted approach in industry development; and
•	
An awareness campaign to create a strong user base will be rolled out to increase the 
public’s understanding on the significance of the MyHIJAU Mark and to familiarise 
them with the MyHIJAU Directory. 
To support the roll out of the GGP
, an online monitoring and tracking system will be 
developed to provide data to improve GGP policies as well as to provide market intelligence 
on emerging demand and supply gaps.
Figure 8.7 shows the number of products targeted to have the MyHijau Mark. Efforts need 
to be implemented to increase the number of registered products throughout the years to 
support the GGP initiative.
8.3.2 Funding GT project development 
8.3.2.1 Green Financing 
Financing is one of the biggest challenges facing GT development, not only in Malaysia 
but also in other countries. The Government, together with financial institutions, has 
collaborated to provide financing to both GT producers and users via the Green Technology 
Financing Scheme (GTFS). The GTFS was introduced in 2010, and is the key channel for 
the disbursement of green finance in Malaysia.
8.3.2.2 Green Technology Financing Scheme (GTFS)
The GTFS offers a 60% guarantee of the financing amount and a rebate of 2% on the 
interest rate charged by financial institutions with the aim to ease access to financing from 
private and commercial financial institutions. The GTFS is available until 31 December 
2017 or upon reaching a total financing amount of RM3.5 billion, whichever is earlier. 
Figure 8.8 shows the number of projects financed under GTFS as of December 2016. 
8.3.1.3 Encouraging business transactions via GGP

Figure 8.7: Number of products targeted by MyHIJAU Mark8


162 | Green Technology Master Plan 
These projects are projected to contribute positively to GHG emissions reductions, 
employment levels and investments opportunities.
As of December 2016, 576 projects have been certified by GTFS, and 272 of these have 
successfully received financing from financial institutions in Malaysia. Although projects 
have been GTFS certified, they face barriers in obtaining financing from private financial 
institutions and banks.
Some of the challenges faced in accessing green financing in Malaysia are as follows:
•	
The lack of knowledge about new technologies and the profitability of GT makes 
private investors apprehensive about financing GT projects;
•	
GT projects are unable to fulfil the same standards as conventional projects when 
applying for financing because of the nascent nature of the GT market;
•	
The GTFS’ financing limit of RM50 million per project discourages high capital projects 
that could yield larger benefits to the nation; and
•	
The GTFS may not be attractive to private investors as it only covers 60% of the green 
component cost of the project and does not cover the investor’s whole risk exposure.
To address some of its key challenges, the following are improvements made to the GTFS:
•	
Government guarantee will be granted on the overall cost of the green component 
compared to only 60%, provided the cost of green component exceeds 60% of the 
total cost of the project;
•	
The maximum financing facility under the GTFS has increased from RM50 million to 
RM100 million for GT producers; and 
•	
A different set of guidelines in the Credit Administration Rules to be adopted by 
financial institutions. The new assessment criteria for GTFS applications would 
consider factors such as collateral, due diligence and sectorial exposure specific to 
the green sector only.

Strategic Thrusts | 163 
8.3.3 Exploring Alternative GT Financing Ecosystem
8.3.3.1 Moving Forward
Now, the GT industry in Malaysia relies on conventional funding from banks and other 
financial institutions through Government assistance, such as the GTFS which is set to 
expire in 2017. 
As Malaysia moves towards the status of a high-income nation, the need to accommodate 
the accelerating demand for green financing is rising. MGTC projects that by 2030, the 
demand for green investment funds is likely to increase from RM6.7 billion in 2013 to 
RM76.2 billion. This will drive the need to consider innovative financing instruments to 
develop a self-reliant GT industry.
 
Some possible financing mechanisms are outlined below.
•	
A green energy special-purpose vehicle (SPV) that would allow companies to access 
soft interest rates and long grace periods for loan repayment;
•	
A green bank concept such as the Green Investment Bank (GIB) in the United Kingdom 
that has been used to finance GT ventures;
•	
Financing opportunities available through international organisations such as the 
Asian Development Bank (ADB), the Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank (AIIB), and 
the United Nations agencies;
•	
The capital market and community-driven crowd-funding platforms;
•	
GT innovators can set up infrastructure project companies to access the capital 
market through initial public offerings (IPOs); and
•	
Socially responsible Islamic Bonds such as Green Sukuk that finance sustainable 
projects.
In the long-run, for GT to become a sustainable component of the Malaysian economy, 
there must be an increased public willingness to pay for a better future. 
This will involve the revision of existing utility tariffs that provide subsidised energy, water 
and waste management to the rakyat. While there has been subtle pull back in energy 
tariffs, future revisions will need to be more substantive to reflect the actual cost and 
environmental cost of providing the utility services. The Government will review the best 
cost transition plan that will minimise hardship for the average person. It will certainly 
require concerted efforts to educate the public on these issues to gain acceptance.
8.3.4 GT Incentives
8.3.4.1 Green Incentives
Incentives are critical economic instruments to encourage GT adoption and development, 
especially when the environmental impact is an opportunity cost which is difficult to be 
quantified. At present, tax incentives are leveraged to cultivate investor interest in the GT 
sector while other non-tax incentives are yet to be explored and introduced to the market.


164 | Green Technology Master Plan 
Previous tax incentives under the Promotion of Investment Act (PIA), 1986 were largely 
related to RE and EE projects. These incentives expired on or before 31 December 2015. 
The incentives were aimed at supporting local industries and service providers to invest 
in RE and EE via: 
•	
Pioneer Status (PS);
•	
Investment Tax Allowance (ITA); and
•	
Tax & Stamp duty exemption for GBI certified property.
These tax incentives lacked an organised and systematic framework in assessing green 
incentive applications on both a technical and non-technical level. Furthermore, the 
absence of a legislative framework resulted in challenges in safeguarding the incentives 
and monitoring the results.
To address the challenges in green incentives, new tax incentives were announced in 
Budget 2014 and will be implemented until 2020. This is accompanied by an improved 
process of obtaining the incentive approval according to compliance with the MyHijau 
criterion. The revised green incentives (Figure 8.9) cover an extensive scope of GT activities 
in EE, RE, transportation, building, integrated waste management and supporting service 
activities.
The revised tax incentives supervised by MIDA and MGTC will be gazetted to safeguard 
their implementation and will follow a similar route to the Income Tax Act. This will outline a 
systematic process of reviewing and monitoring the application process to enable tracking 
of quantifiable results that can be used as a basis for refining the existing policy and its 
implementation process. 
8.3.4.2 Moving Forward
As GT is at the stage of market formation, the Government will undertake studies to assess 
the expansion of the new incentives framework to cover other types of business entities 
which are not registered under the Companies Act.  Tax relief for individual consumption 
of green products and services may also be considered although this may be limited to 
certain products of substantial value. 
Figure 8.9: New Tax Incentive Mechanisms (2016-2020)10
10 Malaysian Green Technology Corporation (MGTC), 2016 & Kementerian Tenaga, Teknologi Hijau 
dan Air (KeTTHA), 2016


Strategic Thrusts | 165 
As the market develops, the incentives framework can be further fine-tuned to promote 
investment in GT production. For instance, raising the requirement or tightening the criteria 
in the definition of GT for a product or service to be qualified for green incentives. 
While incentives are justified as a means to building up a nascent market, these benefits 
must be compared to the financial costs of maintaining the incentives. In the long run, 
green incentives are an unsustainable form of Government assistance. Gradually, an exit 
policy of such incentives will be developed to reduce the Government’s fiscal burden in 
financing sustainable economic growth. 
Further on, the Government will explore the feasibility of implementing a carbon tax or 
green tax and its effectiveness in embedding sustainability as a business norm in Malaysia. 
A green or carbon tax primarily taxes the consumption of products and services at a cost 
that reflects the negative environmental impact of the use of the product or services. This 
allows the Government to attach a quantifiable cost to carbon emissions and change 
energy consumption behaviours of households and industries.  A similar pricing can also 
be placed on water pollution and waste generation.
The RMK-11 already references the need for a taxation system that incorporates a carbon 
tax. However, the introduction of such a tax must be cautiously calibrated with the subsidy 
withdrawals that are mentioned in the earlier section. This will require a cost-benefit 
analysis and intensive public consultations with the relevant key stakeholders, to assist 
the Government in making an informed decision. 
A detailed long-term plan with a realistic timeline will only be developed when the feasibility 
of implementing a carbon tax or green tax is proven and public acceptance is gauged at 
a reasonable level. In respect of the latter, a persistent communication strategy which 
presents the issues transparently will be key in preparing the rakyat. 
8.3.5 Greening Cities for the Transition towards a Green Lifestyle
8.3.5.1 Green Cities
Malaysia’s urban population currently stands at 72.8% of the total population, growing 
at a rate of 2.5% per year. The absence of sustainable strategies, accompanied by 
rapid urbanisation would lead to severe environmental and health issues. To protect 
the ecosystem, there must be concentrated efforts to develop green cities. Green cities 
are communities that proactively incorporate sustainable technologies and adopt green 
practices to lower carbon emissions and improve quality of life for their populations.


166 | Green Technology Master Plan 
To spearhead the development of green cities, KeTTHA and MGTC launched the Low 
Carbon Cities Framework and Assessment System (LCCF) in 2011. LCCF is a national 
framework and assessment system to assist local municipalities and developers to 
achieve low carbon city status. 
The LCCF has two components:
1.	 Low Carbon Cities Framework: This framework identifies potential areas that can be 
targeted to reduce carbon emissions via a systematic review; and
2.	 Low Carbon Cities Assessment System: Carbon emissions are periodically assessed 
using a carbon calculator. 
The LCCF has already been put to the test with several pilot projects and local councils 
adopting the framework and commencing initial baseline studies. MGTC is targeting 52 
cities for implementation (Figure 8.10). 
The implementation of the LCCF leverages on existing legislations and policies under 
the KPKT. In its Housing Planning Guidelines, KPKT rolled out a circular in 2014 on 
Environmentally Sensitive Areas to ensure environmental conservation.

8.3.6 Introducing Roll-Out Plans Comprising Human Capital Development and Public-
Private Collaboration to Green the Cities
8.3.6.1 Moving forward
A major challenge in rolling out the LCCF is to ensure its compatibility with the unique 
requirements of each municipality. Local authorities have the best understanding of the 
needs of their municipalities and the gaps in achieving a green transformation. 
To enable local authorities to address the challenges they face, MGTC with the support 
of its key stakeholders, will deploy qualified and skilled personnel to assist in the 
implementation of the LCCF across all municipalities. 
At the same time, training programmes will be developed and implemented to enhance 
competencies of the personnel involved at the federal, state and municipal level.
To ensure the success of green cities and township planning, the coordination between 
MGTC and the Federal Department of Town and Country Planning Peninsular Malaysia 
(PLANMalaysia) will be strengthened. This is critical to ensure that the green cities agenda 
is cascaded appropriately from the federal level to the state and local authorities. 
Constant communication will be established among the relevant agencies and 
PLANMalaysia to foster the successful development of green cities. A systematic 
monitoring system will be designed and put in place to measure and report progress 
towards the LCCF themes. 
Feedback from the Local and State Governments will be assessed and reflected to 
the federal level for better policy coordination. Besides direct public efforts, MGTC will 
encourage private sector participation in the greening of cities by leveraging on existing 
policies and tax incentives such as GITA and GITE.
Ultimately, green cities are an important step towards creating a greener and more 
sustainable Malaysia, improving the quality of life for its residents as well as future 
generations. 
8.3.7 International Collaborations
International collaborations provide the opportunities for industry players to develop 
capability and obtain experience in doing GT related business in the region. This helps to 
prepare the industry players to export their products and services in the future. 
Malaysia is a member of the International Renewable Energy Agency (IRENA) and the 
Energy Working Group (EWG) under the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC). 
As part of the EWG under APEC, Malaysia works with other APEC members to:
•	
Strengthen energy security;
•	
Promote energy security;
•	
Develop cleaner energy sources; and
•	
Enhance trade and investment in all energy sources to promote economic prosperity.


168 | Green Technology Master Plan 
Malaysia has also hosted the ASEAN Ministers on Energy Meeting (AMEM). The 21st 
AMEM that was held in Langkawi in July 2003, called for intensified cooperation in the 
development and exploitation of the energy resource potentials in the ASEAN region, 
as well as in attracting private sector participation and investment in the ASEAN energy 
sector.
Malaysia has participated in various programmes under the purview of the ASEAN Centre 
for Energy (ACE). Apart from the energy efficiency and conservation programmes such 
as ASEAN Energy Management System (AEMAS) and clean coal technology, Malaysia is 
especially active in the ASEAN Power Grid programme. 
Since January 2016, Malaysia has successfully commissioned the export of 70MW of 
hydroelectricity power per day from Sarawak to West Kalimantan via a 275kV transmission 
line, the project was funded by the Asian Development Bank. 
Other projects currently under planning include: 
•	
Malacca-Sumatra interconnection via submarine cable; and
•	
Nunukan (East Kalimantan) – Sabah (Tawau) link.
8.3.7.1 Moving Forward
Malaysia has signed a MoU with the Government of Cambodia to establish a framework 
for cooperation in the field of GT between the two countries. The MoU seeks to promote 
the development of technologies, products, services, trade and market. The Government-
to-Government collaboration offers business opportunities for GT in various sectors, 
especially in renewable energy and energy efficiency, electric mobility, integrated waste 
management and the promotion of green buildings. 
ASEAN Power Grid
•	
A flagship energy connectivity programme to ensure regional energy security while promoting 
the efficient utilisation and sharing of resources
•	
The programme is undertaken by the Heads of ASEAN Power Utilities/ Authorities which 
also acts as the Specialised Energy Body
•	
The construction of the ASEAN Power Grid is first done on cross-border bilateral terms, then 
expanded to a sub-regional basis, and finally to a total integrated regional system
•	
Laos-Thailand-Malaysia-Singapore Power Integration Project (100 MW) is among the 
prioritised pilot projects
“One of the ASEAN Economic Community objectives is to integrate energy market in the 
framework of ASEAN Electricity Exchange and to enhance the implementation of ASEAN Power 
Grid, with the objective to achieve regional energy security from the availability to quality of 
energy supply, to optimise regional resources especially new and renewable energy, and to 
have accessible energy to all ASEAN people.” 
-Head of ASEAN Power Utilities / Authorities-


Strategic Thrusts | 169 
Recently, Malaysia has also signed three other MoUs of which the first is for multilateral 
power trading of up to 100 MW between Malaysia and Laos through Thailand. The MoU 
will pave the way for Malaysia to purchase hydro power from Laos through Thailand by 
2018. 
The second MoU was signed in October 2016 between Malaysia and Brunei to take 
necessary steps to encourage and promote technical cooperation in GT. 
The third MoU was signed in November 2016 between Malaysia and South Korea to 
collaborate in developing the soft landing/co-incubation programmes for vitalising the 
industry clusters of ICT, biotechnology and life sciences, advanced engineering and GT.
Other international collaborations which Malaysia will leverage on include:
•	
ASEAN + 3 (China, Japan, Korea): Mitigation Cooperation Programme – a programme 
funded by the Government of Korea through the Ministry of Knowledge Economy to 
cooperate on Clean Development Mechanism in energy, to help reduce GHG emission 
and promote sustainable development in the region through capacity building activities;
•	
ASEAN – European Union: ASEAN Standards Harmonisation Initiative for Energy 
Efficiency – a programme funded under the EU SWITCH-Asia affiliated programme to 
increase the market share of higher efficient air conditioners through harmonisation 
of test methods and energy efficiency standards, adoption of common MEPS and 
changing consumer purchasing attitudes;
•	
ASEAN – Germany: ASEAN Renewable Energy Support Programme to carry out 
activities of direct relevance to the development of RE sector in the ASEAN region;

8.4 Strategic Thrust 3: Human Capital Development
8.4.1 Enhancing national capabilities for innovation in GT development
Human capital development is a strategic thrust that aims to increase the national capability 
and capacity for innovation in GT development and enhance Malaysia’s competitiveness 
in the global arena. There have been consistent efforts in strengthening the competencies 
and skillsets through the introduction of sector-specific trainings and informal approaches 
such as industry dialogues.
In line with RMK-11, the Government’s efforts in human capital development will focus on 
3 key areas, covering the existing workforce in the public and private sector, and the future 
workforce in the education system, as shown in Figure 8.11.


170 | Green Technology Master Plan 
Figure 8.11: Key Areas in Human Capital Development12
8.4.1.1	 Capacity Building for The Public Sector
At present, public officials broaden their knowledge through attendance at topical 
seminars and conferences.  Opportunities for formal education to acquire specialist skills 
are subject to invitation and approval by budget availability and other factors.
To cope with the dynamic nature of GT and its technology advancement, a more structured 
approach to prepare public officials in their field will be established. This includes:
•	
A knowledge-sharing platform led by a coordinator supported by GT specialist 
agencies in various sectors.  The agencies will:

 keep track of seminars, conferences and other training opportunities available; 
and

 recommend the appropriate event to the relevant Government bodies
•	
All attendees will be required to prepare and circulate a short report on information 
gleaned from the event and propose suitable applications for Government bodies; and 
•	
Periodic newsletters on GT updates from respective Government bodies are to be 
made available to the public. These materials will be kept in a central depository for 
reference.
8.4.1.2	 Capacity Building for the Private Sector
Malaysia targets to have 40% of its workforce classified as highly-skilled workers to 
become a high-income nation. This target will be realised through local capacity building 
and attracting global talent, subsequently reducing dependency on foreign experts. 
Currently, 28% of the workforce are classified as highly-skilled and the RMK-11 targets to 
increase the proportion of highly-skilled worker to 35% by 2020.
12 Malaysian Green Technology Corporation (MGTC), 2016 


Strategic Thrusts | 171 
In addition to the various sector-specific trainings and accreditation, which both the 
Government and private sectors introduced to the market, the Government has been 
facilitating the process by appointing an Industry Lead Body (ILB) in the various industry 
sectors.
There are 22 ILBs in Malaysia representing various sectors established under the 
Department of Skills Standard (DSD) of the Ministry of Human Resource (MOHR).  
As the ILB for the GT sector, MGTC will align the Technical Vocational Education and Training 
(TVET) curriculum with industry requirements and develop the National Occupational Skill 
Standard (NOSS) relevant to the industry.
Approximately 2,000 NOSSs have been developed to date, of which 61 are recognised 
under the GT sector for reference by TVET institutions.  The scope of the NOSS developed 
under the GT sector covers Renewable Energy, Green Building, Water Treatment, Solid 
Wastes, Scheduled Wastes and Electric Vehicle. 
ILBs also identify existing skilled workers, define their competency level and certify them 
using a mechanism termed as Prior Experience Achievement or Pengiktirafan Pencapaian 
Terdahulu (PPT) which recognises the value of work experience in lieu of higher education 
qualifications.
Starting in 2016, the Government has, via DSD and the ILBs, developed incentive 
programmes such as sponsoring application fees for experienced skilled workers who 
are eligible to apply for PPT certification. These incentives include allowing for application 
fees to be paid from the Human Resources Development Fund (HRDF). 
In addition, a high-skilled person who has more than 10 years’ experience in the GT 
sectors is eligible to apply for country expert database registration or Daftar Pakar Industri 
Negara (DPIN) in categories that match the existing 61 GT NOSS. This facilitates the 
private sector in adopting NOSS as part of their employment strategy and move towards 
an industry-driven NOSS labour development model. 
What are NOSS?
•	
NOSS is an internationally recognised specification of competencies expected 
of a skilled worker for an occupational area, level and pathway. NOSSs can be 
developed by an ILB or any agency engaged by JPK. All NOSS is approved 
by JPK before they are submitted to MOHR for final review and approval 
•	
NOSS is reviewed every three years, where the match between skills standards 
and candidates in the defined positions will be checked and updated for accuracy. 
 
•	
NOSS is supported by Occupational Structures, which are produced from 
Occupational Analysis (OA). OA is the process of identifying the work scope of 
the occupational sub-area in terms of competencies. In other words, it is used to 
analyse skilled human resource competency requirements for industries.


172 | Green Technology Master Plan 
8.4.1.3 Moving Forward
The Government plans to develop nine NOSSs per year until 2020. The Government also 
plans to uplift the NOSSs on RE and biomass energy generation plant and landfill gas 
plant from Level 2 to 5 by 2016; and more NOSS on waste, transportation and green 
building sector NOSSs will be produced by 2017. 
By 2020, MGTC aims to identify the types of jobs and sectors that exist in Malaysia’s 
green technology space. With a better understanding of the landscape, the OA can be 
revised to suit the demand and supply of talent more efficiently. The process for the 
PTT certification will be improved to allow the ILB to identify skilled persons who have 
significant experience in GT projects conducted during the RMK-9, RMK-10 and RMK-11 
period with final approval of the certifications by MOHR, as shown in Table 8.2 below.

8.4.2 Greater Collaboration with Tertiary Institutions for Upskilling of Graduates
8.4.2.1	 Voluntary Programmes by Universities
Currently, certain university programs require the student to complete a short work stint in 
industry as a requirement to graduate. The intention is to provide a minimal level of work 
skills before graduates begin their careers.  However, the short period of 4-6 weeks and 
curriculum which is less than relevant to the industry means that the work experience 
rarely achieves its intent. 
Recognising this, selected universities have reached out to Government bodies such as 
MGTC, to obtain advice on the relevance of their syllabus to actual marketplace needs. 
The integration of the NOSS into tertiary institution syllabus will help align their curricula 
with the most updated requirements of workforce demand in the GT spectrum and allow 
a more enriching experience during the student’s outplacement in the industry. The result 
would be graduates who have high employability ratings. 
Apart from integrating NOSSs in the curricula, the ILBs can offer guidance at seminars 
or lectures to provide candidates with a different perspective on job requirements, and 
therefore increase the candidates’ awareness of the skills required for their desired careers. 
Further support is provided for collaboration between NOSS developers and educational 
institutions, such as private and polytechnic universities, with funding by the HRDF and 
Universiti Teknologi Malaysia (UTM). 
MGTC also plans to implement an industry-oriented national dual training system that 
combines workplace and institutional training. 
The Government hopes to develop human capacity in the GT sector by facilitating close 
collaboration between industries and the private-public sectors. This can be achieved by 
creating GT knowledge sharing through the implementation of a common platform which 
is continually updated. 
8.5 Strategic Thrust 4: R&D&C
8.5.1 A key stepping stone towards an innovative GT hub
Malaysia aspires to become a high income nation by 2020. One of the key drivers in 
this regard is the creation of a knowledge-based economy, where R&D&C plays a key 
role in spawning innovations which benefit the society. In 2012, the National Science and 
Research Council (NSRC) identified 9 National Research and Development Priority Areas 
(NRPAs), setting a common vision for the use of Science, Technology and Innovation (STI) 
towards advancing socio-economic development. GT is subsumed in all of the NRPAs, 
especially in energy security, the environment and climate change, water security as well 
as transport and urbanisation. The main aggregate measure of R&D expenditure is Gross 
Domestic Expenditure on R&D (GERD). 


174 | Green Technology Master Plan 
Malaysia’s GERD amounted to RM10.6 billion in 2012, equivalent to 1.1% of the nation’s 
GDP
. Public sector expenditure on R&D accounted for 36% of GERD in 2012 while the 
private sector funded the remaining 64%.

8.5.1.1	 R&D&C Projects
At the national level, publicly funded R&D&C projects are conducted by research 
universities and GRIs, which are funded by: 
•	
Research university block grants;
•	
Cess funds of GRIs; or 
•	
Competitive grants, including development expenditure funding offered by the JKPDA, 
MOHE and MOSTI. 
A secretariat - Jawatankuasa Pelaburan Dana Awam (JKPDA) - was established in 2012 
to drive the restructuring, streamlining and strengthening of public innovation funding 
mechanism for R&D&C. It operates under the Agensi Inovasi Malaysia (AIM) and is driven 
by a co-secretariat partnership between AIM and MOSTI. 
One of the objectives of AIM is to drive the country to achieve a minimum GERD of at 
least 2% for R&D&C while one of the JKPDA missions is to ensure R&D&C adherence to 
Malaysia’s growth priority areas and sectoral focus. However, there is very little coordination 
between JKPDA and KeTTHA in the GT sector to assess and approve projects due to 
KeTTHA’s absence from JKPDA’s subject matter panel.
This limits KeTTHA’s ability to influence and collate information on R&D&C projects related 
to GT in the six key sectors – Energy, Manufacturing, Transport, Building, Waste and 
Water. This limitation hampers KeTTHA’s role in setting policy directions and plans for 
GT development as well as KeTTHA’s ability to facilitate public-private partnerships both 
locally and across borders.
KeTTHA itself has R&D&C funding capabilities via the MESITA fund which it manages. The 
fund is contributed by IPPs and is allowed to be utilised to fund electricity related pilot 
projects and commercialisation projects. However, the fund’s approach to the provision of 
grants is reactive in nature with poorly defined focus areas for driving GT in the electricity 
sector. 
Meanwhile private sector R&D&C initiatives for GT, especially in the five other key GT 
sectors, need to be tracked and coordinated.

R&D&C. It operates under the Agensi Inovasi Malaysia (AIM) and is driven by a co-
secretariat partnership between AIM and MOSTI. 
One of the objectives of AIM is to drive the country to achieve a minimum GERD of at 
least 2% for R&D&C while one of the JKPDA missions is to ensure R&D&C adherence to 
Malaysia’s growth priority areas and sectoral focus. However, there is very little coordination 
between JKPDA and KeTTHA in the GT sector to assess and approve projects due to 
KeTTHA’s absence from JKPDA’s subject matter panel.
This limits KeTTHA’s ability to influence and collate information on R&D&C projects related 
to GT in the six key sectors – Energy, Manufacturing, Transportation, Building, Waste and 
Water. This limitation hampers KeTTHA’s role in setting policy directions and plans for 
GT development as well as KeTTHA’s ability to facilitate public-private partnerships both 
locally and across borders.
KeTTHA itself has R&D&C funding capabilities via the MESITA fund which it manages. The 
fund is contributed by IPPs and is allowed to be utilised to fund electricity related pilot 
projects and commercialisation projects. However, the fund’s approach to the provision of 
grants is reactive in nature with poorly defined focus areas for driving GT in the electricity 
sector. 
Meanwhile private sector R&D&C initiatives for GT, especially in the five other key GT 
sectors, need to be tracked and coordinated. 
8.5.1.3 Moving Forward
To further reduce duplication of resources, KeTTHA will seek to work with the JKPDA to 
influence the direction and funding of R&D&C initiatives towards GT development. As 
KeTTHA and its agencies have technical knowledge of GT, namely in the six key sectors 
of the GTMP
, KeTTHA would be able to provide valuable insights and inputs on the latest 
technological advancements.
Coordination with JKPDA and engagement with stakeholders would also allow for better 
definition of focus areas for the deployment of the MESITA fund and a more active 
solicitation of applications to the MESITA fund. 
The RMA and JKPDA could provide the platform to facilitate greater public-private 
partnerships by integrating private participation as assessment criteria in proposal 
assessment.
8.5.2 Encouraging more localised and demand driven R&D&C
Malaysia is targeting to be the GT hub in Southeast Asia and is planning to move from GT 
adoption to GT development post-2020. To achieve this, the Government will engage in 
industry facilitation and promotion of localised GT solutions instead of relying on direct 
adoption of GT solutions that may not always be suited to the climate conditions of 
Malaysia.


Strategic Thrusts | 177 
It is therefore important for KeTTHA to be represented on the JKPDA to ensure that 
resources for R&D&C projects will be channelled towards the development of GT solutions 
suited to the tropical conditions of Malaysia. 
The feedback loop of the evaluation and monitoring process enables effective information 
sharing that plays an important role in KeTTHA’s policy planning with regards to R&D&C 
on GT. 
8.6 Strategic Thrust 5: Institutional Framework
8.6.1 Strengthening governance to advance national green agenda for sustainable 
economic development
Malaysia is among the first countries in the Southeast Asian region to establish a dedicated 
Ministry to undertake policy advocacy on green technology. Having recognised the need 
to strengthen the institutional framework in the NGTP
, Malaysia has undertaken some 
initiatives to address 3 key areas in the governance of the country’s GT agenda, namely:
•	
Policy leadership;
•	
Policy planning; and
•	
Policy implementation.
8.6.1.1 Policy Leadership
In 2009, the Government of Malaysia established the Green Technology and Climate 
Change Council (MTHPI) to formulate policies and identify strategic issues in the NGTP 
development and climate change. This Council is chaired by the Prime Minister and the 
secretariats are NRE and KeTTHA. The MTHPI was entrusted. It also coordinates, monitors 
and evaluates the effectiveness of the NGTP and GT programmes and climate change at 
the national level. 
The MTHPI is supported by a Steering Committee and 8 Working Committees (WCs) in 
specific focus areas, involving both public and private stakeholders. Each WC comprises 
of members from various ministries and Government agencies, including private industry 
players to create synergies and spin-offs.
Figure 8.12: Eight working committees under MTHPI15
15 Kementerian Tenaga, Teknologi Hijau dan Air (KeTTHA), 2016


178 | Green Technology Master Plan 
The MTHPI institutionalises an inter-ministerial communication mechanism, recognising 
the cross-sectoral nature of the green agenda. This communication mechanism is critical 
to ensure the strategic direction of the green national agenda is a well-communicated 
decision, which is being set objectively based on consultative views. 
Moving forward, efforts will be focused on improving the effectiveness of the MTHPI and its 
working committees. Most of the existing terms of reference in the 8 working committees 
shall continue to be pursued by the respective Government bodies. 
The existing governance structure of the MTHPI, especially its working committees will be 
reviewed to identify and prioritise key areas which require urgent attention. 
The MTHPI will be leveraged to maximise the benefits of the inter-ministerial communication 
mechanism, to solve issues in GT development requiring collective efforts from all the key 
stakeholders. Key improvements to be made to the Working Committees are as follows:
•	
Regular meetings with clear agenda;
•	
Shared targets among various stakeholders and long-term planning supported by 
clear project timeline to deliver the GT targets in the six sectors;
•	
Proactive feedback loop to be formed between the WCs and Secretariat to the MTHPI 
to ensure that the WCs are aligned to national green agenda; and
•	
The Secretariat to the MTHPI to undertake analysis on the policy papers put forward by 
the WCs to facilitate policy planning instead of solely handling administrative matters.
8.6.2 Enhancing capacity and capability in policy planning
8.6.2.1	 Policy Planning
The cross-sectoral nature of GT poses challenges in aligning policy development and 
implementation. While most of the ministries have included the green agenda in their 
strategic policy development, nevertheless, KeTTHA is the mandated ministry in developing 
the NGTP and advancing the national green agenda. 
KeTTHA’s mandate to influence the GT agenda in other ministries needs to be better 
embedded in the MTHPI structure. Therefore, key improvements will be made in the 
following areas:
•	
Addressing inter-ministerial coordination issues to drive the green technology agenda.
•	
Adoption of structured framework in policy planning, starting with:
»
»
Value chain analysis for all key sectors;
»
»
Clear portfolio (e.g. GT sectoral focus, strategic thrusts);
»
»
Stakeholder engagement to understand sectors and technology updates; and
»
»
Systematic process in policy development, especially involving other agencies 
such as MiGHT.


Strategic Thrusts | 179 
The 8 WCs in MTHPI will be leveraged as the platform for GT policy development with the 
anchor ministries consulting with KeTTHA on the application of GT in greening the sectors 
under their respective purviews. 
Figure 8.13: Improved feedback loop in policy governance16

180 | Green Technology Master Plan 
8.6.3 Strengthened collaboration in policy planning and implementation 
8.6.3.1	 Policy Implementation
The implementing agency (IA) of a policy usually reports directly to the parent ministry. 
However, the reporting of GT developments from policy implementers that are under other 
ministries will also be reported in parallel to KeTTHA. This is critical to ensure access 
to data and information, which are crucial for KeTTHA to perform analyses for policy 
planning purposes. 
To enhance the effectiveness of policy implementation, the following improvements are 
need to be undertaken:
•	
Clear demarcation of roles and responsibilities as implementing agencies;
•	
Shared KPIs to be created to facilitate outcome-driven results of the WCs in MTHPI, 
including at the IA level; and 
•	
Updates on progress of policy implementation to be shared consistently on a regular 
basis by the WCs in the MTHPI to facilitate policy planning. 
In summary, the five strategic thrusts i.e. promotion and awareness, market enablers, 
human capital development, R&D&C and institutional framework have been identified to 
facilitate the growth of GT in Malaysia in its journey towards becoming a GT Hub post 
2020. These holistic strategies provide a platform for the implementation and monitoring 
of green initiatives that will expand Malaysia’s GT development and help achieve the 
country’s long term aim to shift from GT adoption to GT development.

9.1 Priority Setting
The key criteria in setting priorities for implementation are mainly driven by the relative 
contribution of each sector’s GT to economic growth and specific factors unique to the 
respective sectors.  
9.1.1 Contribution of GT to National Economic Growth
Figure 9.1 below demonstrates the economic contribution and projection for five (5) sectors 
by 2020 and 2030 under two scenarios; business as usual and meeting the green targets. 
Business as usual (BAU) - By 2020 GT adoption in the five sectors are  expected to 
contribute around GDP RM12.7 billion which is 0.7% of national GDP while  the green 
investment and green jobs are estimated at about RM18.7 billion and 76,470 jobs 
respectively. Towards 2030, if BAU continues , Green Technology is expected to contribute 
around GDP RM27.9 billion which is still 0.7% of national GDP and the green investment 
and green jobs are estimated at about RM45.17 billion and 104,060 jobs respectively.

Implementation Plan | 183 
Under the BAU scenario, the fastest growth is expected by the building sector, attributed 
to the strong growth in green building materials and EE for building. The growth is mainly 
driven by local market demand as green buildings seem to offer higher return values in 
terms of rental returns (additional RM0.50-RM2.25/sqft), occupancy rates, as well as lower 
building maintenance cost. 
The Energy sector ranked second under this scenario. The growth is likely to be driven by:
•	
Consistent local demand to establish RE power plant (non-solar) supported by FiT; 
and
•	
Export-oriented businesses (solar and energy efficient products).
Meeting the Green Targets by  2020 more exciting figures emerge as the GT contribution 
is estimated at around GDP RM22.4 billion which is 1.2% of national GDP while the 
green investment and green jobs are estimated at about RM36 billion and 144,590 jobs 
respectively. Towards 2030, Green Technology is expected to contribute nearly three times 
as much to the GDP  with an estimated value of RM60 billion, i.e. 1.5% of national GDP
. 
Green investment and green jobs will by then be  at about RM94.3 billion and 221,500 
jobs respectively. 
9.1.2 Growth Potential by Sector
The following sections highlight existing GT presence in key industrial sectors. 
9.1.2.1 Energy
The GDP contribution from GT is estimated to grow from RM5.0 billion in 2013 to about 
RM33.3 billion in 2030. However, the percentage of overall GDP of the energy sector 
is likely to shrink from 63% to 55%. This is mainly due to the diversification of green 
technology products and services in the country. The energy sector is estimated to grow at 
12% CAGR from 2013 to 2030, attracting at least RM35.2 billion of cumulative investment. 
The industry is likely to be driven by: 
•	
Realisation of 2,080MW of RE installed capacity in the country;
•	
Export of solar photovoltaic panels; and 
•	
Energy efficient products and appliances.
The economic potential of green energy could be higher should there be wider adoption 
of renewable technology in the system, wider adoption of co-generation, as well as the 
application of energy efficient equipment and processes by various industries. In addition, 
local industries could also tap on the growing renewable markets in the Southeast Asian 
region. It was estimated that the renewable capacity in this region is likely to rise from 43GW 
(2012) to 130GW (2035), which is 32.5 times higher than the Malaysian targets. The well-
established electrical sector in Malaysia could also leverage on its capability in supplying 
high-end electrical products and components to both domestic and international markets 
for the production of energy efficient electronic appliances.


184 | Green Technology Master Plan 
9.1.2.2 Transport
The fastest growth is expected by the transport sector, especially in the private transport 
subsector, mainly driven by:
•	
Appropriate pricing regime for car and fuel subsidies;
•	
Increase in the number of EEV manufacturers in the country;
•	
Improved technology used in hybrid cars and EVs which strengthen market confidence 
towards these products; 
•	
Presence of supporting infrastructure for EV such as a comprehensive network of 
charging stations; and
•	
The deployment of first miles and last miles solution such as car sharing or e-hailing 
services.
The transport sector is estimated to grow at 22% CAGR from 2013 to 2030, attracting 
at least RM14.5 billion of cumulative investment. The GDP contribution of the green 
transportation is estimated to increase from RM0.2 million in 2013 to RM5.4 billion by 
2030. At present, only Thailand and Malaysia have the capability to assemble hybrid 
vehicles in the region. This presents an excellent prospect for Malaysia to becoming a 
hybrid car leader in the automotive industry. 
9.1.2.3 Building
The building sector is likely to be the third fastest growing sector, whereby its GDP share 
is projected to increase from 13% (2013) to 20% (2030) with values of RM1.0 billion and 
RM11.8 billion  respectively. The industry is likely to be driven by: 
•	
Growth in private green buildings (both new and existing);
•	
Export-oriented businesses for green building materials; 
•	
Energy efficient building system (particularly heating, ventilation and air conditioning, 
as well as solar hot water system);
•	
IBS growing in tandem with the growth in the green building construction; and
•	
Strong local demand growth due to full enforcement of UBBL on energy efficient 
building system in Malaysia.
The building sector is estimated to grow at 16% CAGR, attracting at least RM13.8 billion 
of cumulative investment. 


Implementation Plan | 185 
9.1.2.4 Waste
Assuming that waste recycling rates increase and more waste goes into sanitary landfills 
instead of uncontrolled dumpsites, the GDP contribution of the waste sector will increase 
from RM1.6 billion (2013) to RM7.6 billion (2030). However, the percentage of overall 
GDP contribution of the waste sector is likely to shrink from 20% to 13%. This is mainly 
because the growth rate of other sectors are significantly higher than the waste sector 
and also assuming that the existing tipping fees remain unchanged. Nevertheless, the 
increase in waste generation per capita is likely to result in the increase of the absolute 
GDP contribution of the waste sector.
 
The waste sector is expected to grow at 10% CAGR from 2013 to 2030, attracting at least 
RM19.9 billion of cumulative investment. The economic potential of a green waste sector 
could be higher should there be wider adoption of GT through Waste-to-Energy (WtE), 
biogas capture from POME, and other facilities such as transfer station, materials recovery 
facilities to green the entire waste management process from collection and transfer to 
final disposal. 
9.1.2.5 Water
The GDP contribution of the water sector is estimated to increase from RM0.1 billion in 
2013 to RM1.9 billion (2030) which is a marginal increase from 2% to 3%. This assumes 
that:
•	
All the sanitary ware products are water efficient as all manufacturers have phased out 
conventional sanitary ware; 
•	
Regulations are also in place to hinder the import of non-water-efficient sanitary ware; 
and 
•	
All states are assumed to have gazetted and enforced the Rain Water Harvesting 
System to all types of landed properties. 
The water sector is expected to grow at 17% CAGR from 2013 to 2030, attracting at least 
RM2.9 billion of cumulative investment. The economic potential of a green water sector 
could be higher should there be wider adoption of GT through in the following areas, 
including:
•	
Integrated river basin management;
•	
Efficient water treatment and water distribution system;
•	
Water harvesting system (including ground water and storm water); and
•	
Wastewater treatment.

9.2 Implementation Framework
9.3 Governance Model
Figure 9.3 outlines the Governance Model proposed for the implementation of the GTMP 
towards its goals. For effective implementation, it is critical to structure the governance 
model to enable  a smooth operational roll-out, performance monitoring, accountability 
and funding access.
 
The governance structure of GTMP will leverage on the existing National Green Technology 
and Climate Change Council (MTHPI) a high-level platform to report the progress of the 
implementation plan. MTHPI which is chaired by the Prime Minister shall provide strategic 
directions and thought leadership towards achieving the green growth and sustainability 
agenda.
 
KeTTHA will be the lead ministry for the overall implementation of GTMP and MGTC, as 
the technical arm for KeTTHA, will assist to coordinate the implementation strategies. 
MGTC will facilitate and monitor the implementing agencies which are entrusted to 
execute the initiatives identified in the respective sectors and strategic thrusts. A GTMP 
Advisory Committee comprising experts and key players from all the six sectors will be 
established to provide advice, propose initiatives, review/assess strategies/programmes 
and provide technical expertise. 
 
The implementation framework for GTMP is demonstrated in Figure 9.2 below.

9.3.2 Programme Implementation
GTMP emphasises the effective implementation of strategies to solve immediate industry 
issues to enable market creation. Proper planning and a systematic approach needs to be 
done to ensure the smooth implementation of the key strategies. Table 9.2 summarises 
the proposed key initiatives as outlined in earlier chapters. The projects and programmes 
shall be implemented via a mix of Government funding, international funding or public 
private partnership.
The immediate action is to set up the Steering Committee chaired by KeTTHA and to 
establish the GTMP Advisory Committee. Members of the Steering Committee will be 
appointed from various ministries and key industry players. While for the GTMP Advisory 
Committee, MGTC will identify the main stakeholders from Government agencies and 
key industrial players of each sector. The GTMP Advisory Committee of each sector shall 
deliberate and formulate action plans to address industry issues. MGTC with the assistance 
from the Advisory Committee will prioritise and propose to KeTTHA the technology types 
as well as projects and programmes to be implemented.
 
Meanwhile, for the strategic thrusts, there are existing mechanisms which will require 
finetuning to enhance its effectiveness to facilitate GT growth and to deliver progressive 
improvement. A detailed action plan with shared KPIs will follow suit, accompanied with 
project milestone to enable KeTTHA to monitor the implementation of initiatives which 
have been identified in the respective strategic thrusts. Table 9.3 shows the key areas 
based on the five (5) strategic thrusts.

CONCLUSION


Conclusion | 195 
Conclusion
Malaysia’s shift towards a low-carbon economy is a strategic and bold move that will 
leverage on green technology as the enabler to undergo this transition. However, since 
green technology applies to all spheres of life, it is a complex challenge to embed it 
in a coordinated manner across all sectors in the economic plans of the country. The 
approach therefore must be multi-phased and increasingly expansive in sectoral coverage, 
underpinned by an increasingly deep grasp of the underlying carbon emissions data.
To this end, the GTMP has been developed as a strategic roadmap that informs the 
intentions for the future development of green technology strategies and programmes 
in Malaysia. In this first iteration, the GTMP has targeted six key sectors that are the 
primary contributors to carbon emissions in the country i.e. Energy Production and 
Supply, Buildings, Manufacturing, Transport, Waste Management and Water Supply. The 
initiatives that are described in these key areas, of which some are already underway, will 
be expanded as more data is amassed that can be interrogated for greater specificity in 
setting targets.
A significant lesson learnt in the development of the GTMP is that a sectoral target does not 
only produce a single isolated outcome within the sector but also has concurrent outcomes 
in other sectors. This high degree of interdependence makes it imperative for ministries to 
work together in producing targets which can be aggregated towards a national aspiration 
for a zero-carbon economy. As an interim measure, Malaysia established an intermediate 
goal of reducing GHG emission intensity of Gross Domestic Product (GDP) by up to 45% 
by 2030 relative to 2005 levels.
Future economic plans for the country will therefore be more wholistic and produce a more 
sustainable economy with shared goals and coordinated policy instruments. In addition, 
Malaysia will eventually need to graduate from a phase of technology adaptation and 
adoption towards greater home-grown innovations in green technology. This will require 
the persistent application of the five strategic thrusts that have been described in this 
GTMP
.
Decoupling economic growth from carbon emission has the added benefit of ensuring 
that Malaysia remains competitive as an investment destination as it keeps pace with 
other economies that are pursuing it aggressively. GTMP shall pave the way for Malaysia’s 
Transformasi Nasional 2050 (TN50) to be amongst the leading global economies. Many 
of the 17 Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) formulated by the United Nations can 
also be achieved through the GTMP
. Realistically, it will require an informed rakyat and 
committed stakeholders to work out the bold targets in the GTMP which will create a 
greener and more sustainable Malaysia for the future generation.
