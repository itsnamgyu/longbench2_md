# Question

These are two articles about grassland simulation. The first article is "Responsive Real Time Grass Rendering for General 3D Scenes", and the second article is "CWD Sim: Real Time Simulation on Grass Swaying with Controllable Wind Dynamics‚Äù. Which of the following statements regarding the differences in content between the two articles is incorrect?

# Choices

- A: In the first article, some unimportant leaves were removed to save performance, and the second article use LOD (detail level) algorithm for performance optimization.
- B: The second article emphasizes the undulation of the grass by using color changes in different bent states, while the first article does not use this method.
- C: The first article calculates leaf displacement using natural elements as coefficients, while the second article uses fluid simulation to calculate wind forces that bend the leaves.
- D: The first article can simulate wind in a certain direction or specific wind source, while the second article can simulate the effects of wind fields in multiple directions on grasslands and allow users to freely customize wind effects.

# Answer

A
