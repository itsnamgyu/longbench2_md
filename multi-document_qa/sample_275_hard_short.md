# Question

What are the differences between Jump Over ASLR and BunnyHop-Reload in inferring collisions in the BTB?

# Choices

- A: Jump Over ASLR infers collisions by measuring the execution time of the victim and spy process, while BunnyHop-Reload does so by measuring the execution time of a code block containing many NOP instructions.
- B: Jump Over ASLR infers collisions by measuring the execution time of the spy process, while BunnyHop-Reload does so by  executing some NOP instructions.
- C: Jump Over ASLR infers collisions by measuring the execution time of the jump instruction code block in the spy process, while BunnyHop-Reload does so by determining whether the target is prefetched into the cache.
- D: Jump Over ASLR infers collisions by measuring the execution time of the victim and spy process, while BunnyHop-Reload does so by measuring whether the target is prefetched into the cache.
