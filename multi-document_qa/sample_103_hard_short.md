# Question

When it comes to large-scale volumetric calcium imaging, which statement is true?

# Choices

- A: SRDTrans focus on handling both spatial redundancy, while the self-inspired model focuses exclusively on time-lapse temporal data.
- B: The SRDTrans model lacks dynamic training data, limiting its performance in low frame rate situations.
- C: SRDTrans utilizes a temporal sampling technique that is more computationally efficient.
- D: The self-inspired learning model requires fewer network parameters and can therefore generalize better than SRDTrans.

# Answer

B
