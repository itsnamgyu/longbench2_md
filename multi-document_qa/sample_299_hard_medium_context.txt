I, Peter Soros, as AUSTRAC’s accountable authority, present the 2022–23 annual performance 
statements for AUSTRAC as required under paragraph 39(1)(a) of the Public Governance,

Dear Attorney-General  
AUSTRAC ANNUAL REPORT 
I am pleased to present the annual report for the year ended 30 June 2023 on the operations of the 
Australian Transaction Reports and Analysis Centre (AUSTRAC), as is required by subsection 46(1) 
of the Public Governance, Performance and Accountability Act 2013. 
The report has been prepared pursuant to the requirements for annual reports approved by the Joint 
Committee of Public Accounts and Audit and as prescribed in the Public Governance, Performance 
and Accountability Rule 2014 (PGPA Rule). 
As the accountable authority for AUSTRAC, I certify the agency has prepared fraud and corruption risk 
assessments and a fraud and corruption control plan that comply with the requirements of section 10 
of the PGPA Rule, and the Commonwealth Fraud Control Policy. We have fraud prevention, detection, 
investigation, reporting and data collections procedures and processes in place that align with the 
requirements of the Commonwealth Fraud Control Framework 2017.
We have taken reasonable measures to minimise the incidence of fraud within the agency and to 
investigate and recover the proceeds of fraud against the agency.

Yours sincerely



Peter Soros
Acting Chief Executive Officer

CEO REVIEW
2022–23 AT AUSTRAC
Serving as Australia’s anti-money laundering 
and counter-terrorism financing (AML/CTF) 
regulator and financial intelligence unit 
(FIU), AUSTRAC performs a key role in the 
law enforcement and regulatory landscape. 
Together, our regulatory and intelligence 
functions harden frontline businesses against 
criminal activity, and enable the detection 
and disruption of serious crime. Access to 
AUSTRAC’s data and intelligence holdings 
assists over 5,000 users across government 
and international partners in their work to 
deter and disrupt criminal activity.
The end of 2022–23 marked an important 
milestone for AUSTRAC with the departure of 
the CEO, Nicole Rose PSM, after serving as the 
agency head for almost 6 years. The period of 
Ms Rose’s stewardship was a successful one 
for the agency—AUSTRAC pursued milestone 
civil penalties against the Commonwealth 
Bank, Westpac and Crown Casinos, increased 
awareness of the prevalence and harms of 
money laundering in Australia, and enhanced 
its standing as a regulator and FIU among 
industry, government and internationally. 
During this time, AUSTRAC also established 
itself as a leading workplace in terms of 
culture and employee experience. It has 
grown to an agency of over 500 people and 
now sees more than half of our SES roles 
held by women. The agency is well-placed 
to respond to future developments and 
challenges. On behalf of all of our staff, I’d 
like to thank Ms Rose for her dedication and 
leadership of the agency during this time.



In 2022–23 AUSTRAC continued to deliver 
positive outcomes in protecting the Australian 
community from serious and organised 
crime. We worked alongside domestic and 
international law enforcement, national 
security and other government agencies 
to provide actionable financial intelligence.
Earlier this year, our financial intelligence was 
crucial in securing the highest proceeds of 
crime restraint in the history of the Australian 
Federal Police—more than $150 million worth 
of goods, cash, cryptocurrency and property 
belonging to members of an international 
money laundering organisation. Our award-
winning public-private partnership, Fintel 
Alliance, continued to identify opportunities 
to protect the community from harm. This 
year, real-time collaboration between industry 
and government authorities, enabled by Fintel 
Alliance, led to locating a young girl abducted 
in the Northern Territory and the apprehension 
of some of Australia’s most wanted fugitives.
‘AUSTRAC pursued milestone 
civil penalties... increased 
awareness of the prevalence 
and harms of money 
laundering in Australia, and 
enhanced its standing as 
a regulator and FIU among 
industry, government 
and internationally.’


/  AUSTRAC ANNUAL REPORT 2022-23
Our strong collaboration extends to our 
regional and international partners. This year, 
AUSTRAC co-chaired the Financial Intelligence 
Consultative Group (FICG) meeting with 
Malaysia’s FIU in Singapore—the first in-
person meeting since 2019. Along with the 
AUSTRAC co-led Pacific Financial Intelligence 
Community, FICG remains a key vehicle for 
engagement and operational collaboration 
across the region, producing actionable 
intelligence that supports the disruption 
of serious financial crime. Work continues 
on initiatives to uplift capacity, improve 
information sharing and enable greater 
operational engagement across the Indo-
Pacific region, including the development and 
deployment of a regional Information Sharing 
Platform, a secure database and analytics 
platform, and posting an AUSTRAC employee 
to the Pacific in early 2024.
We continued to deploy regulatory actions to 
encourage businesses to meet their AML/CTF 
obligations to protect their business and the 
community from serious and organised crime. 
In addition to our usual risk-based approach 
to regulating reporting entities, AUSTRAC 
conducted several campaigns over 2022–23. 
These included looking into compliance 
reporting obligations and enrolment by pubs 
and clubs operating electronic gaming machines.
AUSTRAC continues to use insights drawn from 
our regulatory and intelligence functions to 
understand risks and vulnerabilities within the 
financial system. We publish guidance to arm 
our regulated population with the information 
they need to manage their money laundering 
and terrorism financing (ML/TF) risks and 
help defend themselves and the community 
against serious financial crime.
We recently improved our website to 
make it easier for businesses to find 
relevant information and guidance. We 
are continuing work on transforming our 
reporting systems, to make it easier for our 
regulated population to meet their reporting 
obligations and engage with AUSTRAC.
AUSTRAC also took action against entities 
in cases of alleged serious and systemic 
non-compliance with AML/CTF laws. This 
sends a strong message to all entities of the 
need for ongoing vigilance and assurance 
as to their AML/CTF compliance. During 
2022–23 AUSTRAC commenced civil penalty 
proceedings in the Federal Court against 
The Star Pty Limited, The Star Entertainment 
QLD Limited and SkyCity Adelaide Pty Ltd. 
We also agreed a joint penalty of $450 million 
over Crown’s breaches of the Anti-Money 
Laundering and Counter-Terrorism Financing 
Act 2006, which was ratified by the Federal 
Court in July 2023.


11  / 240
CEO REVIEW
We recognise it is crucial that AUSTRAC 
remain agile to respond to changes in our 
operating environment. Despite a high 
operational tempo, we remained committed 
to supporting our workforce, strengthening 
our organisational culture and embracing 
hybrid work in 2022–23. To remain effective, 
AUSTRAC will continually build on our data 
and technology capabilities, to ensure we 
are maturing data governance and our use 
of analytics. This will enable us to address 
emerging threats such as cybercrime and 
increasingly sophisticated ML/TF methods.
Preparation is underway for Australia’s next 
mutual evaluation in 2025 by the Financial 
Action Task Force (FATF), the global AML/CTF 
and counter-proliferation financing watchdog 
and standard-setter. FATF will assess Australia’s 
compliance with the global standards and 
the effectiveness of Australia’s AML/CTF 
regime. AUSTRAC understands the important 
role FATF plays in ensuring a strong global 
response to financial crime. We are working 
with the Attorney-General’s Department and 
others in the ecosystem to ensure Australia 
is well-positioned to perform strongly during 
the assessment.
Also to strengthen the effectiveness of 
Australia’s AML/CTF regime, the Attorney-
General announced public consultation 
on proposed reforms to Australia’s AML/CTF 
legislative framework in April 2023. The 
reforms aim to simplify and modernise 
the regime, and propose expanding the 
AML/CTF regime to a wider range of 
professions and services. The proposed 
reforms will have wide-ranging implications 
for AUSTRAC and present an opportunity to 
maximise the value of AML/CTF regulation 
and financial intelligence, to generate 
meaningful outcomes for the Australian 
community. AUSTRAC is working closely 
with the Attorney-General’s Department 
on the industry consultation and policy 
development process, to ensure the reforms 
can be effectively implemented.
The next few years herald a new and exciting 
chapter for our agency. I am proud to 
lead a resilient, collaborative and effective 
organisation, made up of staff who are engaged 
and committed to protecting Australia’s 
financial system from criminal exploitation.

ROLE AND FUNCTIONS 
 

AUSTRAC is a non-corporate Commonwealth 
entity in the Attorney-General’s portfolio. 
During 2022–23 AUSTRAC reported to the 
Hon Mark Dreyfus KC MP, Attorney-General.
As Australia’s anti-money laundering and 
counter-terrorism financing (AML/CTF) 
regulator and financial intelligence unit 
(FIU), AUSTRAC is responsible for detecting, 
deterring and disrupting criminal exploitation 
of the Australian financial system, to protect 
the Australian community from serious and 
organised crime.
AUSTRAC’s unique value is our dual, 
interconnected regulation and intelligence 
functions, and our collaboration with 
industry and government partners in working 
towards the vision of a financial system free 
from criminal abuse. AUSTRAC’s regulation 
hardens the financial sector against criminal 
exploitation, while our intelligence provides 
crucial information to national security and 
law enforcement partners.




Our purpose is underpinned by the objectives 
of the Anti-Money Laundering and Counter-
Terrorism Financing Act 2006 (AML/CTF Act), 
which include to:
•	
support cooperation and collaboration 
among reporting entities, AUSTRAC and 
other government agencies—particularly 
law enforcement agencies—to detect, 
deter and disrupt money laundering and 
terrorism financing (ML/TF) and other 
serious financial crimes
•	
provide relevant Australian government 
bodies and their international 
counterparts with the information they 
need to investigate and prosecute ML/TF 
offences and other serious crimes
•	
promote public confidence in the 
Australian financial system, through 
the enactment and implementation of 
controls and powers to detect, deter and 
disrupt ML/TF and other serious crimes
•	
fulfil Australia’s international obligations 
and address matters of international 
concern in combating ML/TF, while 
beneficially affecting Australia’s 
relations with foreign countries 
and international organisations.


15  / 240




AUSTRAC regulates more than 17,000 
individuals, businesses and organisations to 
ensure they have robust AML/CTF processes 
and systems in place and can effectively 
identify and mitigate ML/TF risks. AUSTRAC 
receives almost half a million reports each 
day from businesses such as banks and 
credit unions, lenders and stockbrokers, 
gambling and bullion service providers, 
remittance dealers and digital currency 
exchange providers.
Our intelligence analysts draw on the 
information in these reports, in combination 
with other information sources, to identify 
risks and threats to the Australian community. 
Our unique financial intelligence expertise 
enables us to develop targeted intelligence 
products to support law enforcement and 
national security agencies’ investigation 
and prosecution of serious criminal activity. 
We also make this information available 
to our key government partners, and use 
the insights generated to educate industry 
and help build the resilience of Australian 
businesses in detecting and mitigating 
criminal abuse of the financial system.
We continue to work in collaboration with 
our overseas counterparts, particularly with 
Five Eyes and Asia-Pacific partners, to enhance 
global financial intelligence and regulatory 
frameworks, and strengthen regional capacity 
to combat financial crime. 
OUR CAPABILITIES

As outlined in our 2022–26 corporate plan, 
AUSTRAC’s ability to achieve our purpose 
and undertake our key activities as Australia’s 
AML/CTF regulator and FIU is underpinned 
by our key capabilities. These comprise 
our regulatory, intelligence and enabling 
capabilities, such as our people, governance, 
data and analytics. These capabilities are 
structured into 3 divisions as shown in the 
organisation chart on page 20.

KEY 
CAPABILITIES


17  / 240
REGULATION 
AND REFORM
As Australia’s AML/CTF regulator, AUSTRAC 
regulates more than 17,000 individuals, 
businesses and organisations. We ensure 
they comply with their obligations under 
the Anti-Money Laundering and Counter-
Terrorism Financing Act 2006 (AML/CTF Act) 
and Financial Transaction Reports Act 1988. 
We do this to protect them, and the financial 
system, from criminal abuse. Reporting 
entities’ obligations include identifying, 
understanding and mitigating money 
laundering and terrorism financing (ML/TF) 
risks, and reporting financial transactions 
and suspicious activity to AUSTRAC.
Our regulatory approach involves education, 
supervision and enforcement. Our approach 
is risk-based, ensuring our resources are 
allocated to best manage ML/TF risks across 
the Australian financial system, and our 
interactions with regulated entities are 
aligned to their needs and circumstances.




Our regulatory activities also include:
•	
identifying new and emerging risks
•	
identifying and collecting data to 
generate regulatory insights
•	
using regulatory insights to assess 
industry vulnerabilities and threats 
to Australia’s financial sector
•	
influencing industry to improve risk 
identification and management
•	
educating entities on risks and 
compliance to assist them to comply
•	
undertaking active supervision to test 
business sectors’ performance
•	
taking a risk-based approach to how we 
handle non-compliant reporting entities
•	
taking enforcement action against 
reporting entities that is proportionate 
to the nature of and harm resulting from 
non-compliance with the AML/CTF Act.
KEY CAPABILITIES


/  AUSTRAC ANNUAL REPORT 2022-23




On 20 April 2023 the Attorney-General 
announced consultation on an extensive 
package of proposed legislative reforms to 
Australia’s AML/CTF regime. This includes 
seeking to extend the existing AML/CTF 
legislation to capture additional entities 
including lawyers, accountants, trust and 
company service providers, real estate 
agents and dealers in precious metals and 
stones. The reforms also aim to simplify 
and modernise the regime in line with 
international standards and best practice.
In 2025 the Financial Action Task Force 
(FATF) will commence a mutual evaluation 
of Australia’s implementation of the FATF 
recommendations and effectiveness of the 
country’s AML/CTF system. AUSTRAC is 
working closely with the Attorney-General’s 
Department and other portfolio agencies 
to prepare for the mutual evaluation and 
AML/CTF reform.
INTELLIGENCE

As Australia’s financial intelligence unit (FIU), 
AUSTRAC produces actionable financial 
intelligence and insights for partner agencies, 
by using information collected from the 
entities we regulate, and other data sources, 
specialised analytical tools and tradecraft. 
Our intelligence relates to the most significant 
threats against Australia’s national security, 
and crimes including ML/TF, sanctions 
evasion, drug trafficking, child exploitation, 
cybercrime, fraud and other forms of serious 
and organised crime.
Effective partnerships are critical in the 
provision of timely, accurate and actionable 
financial intelligence. We work seamlessly 
with Commonwealth, state and territory 
law enforcement, revenue, border and 
national security intelligence agencies, to 
protect Australia from those who might do 
us harm. This includes active participation 
with national and multi-jurisdictional law 
enforcement, security and revenue protection 
taskforces, and as a member of the National 
Intelligence Community (NIC). 
We work with industry primarily through 
Fintel Alliance (AUSTRAC’s public-private 
partnership), which has proven to be a world-
class example of the benefit of collaboration 
and information sharing between public and 
private partners. Harnessing the capabilities 
of Fintel Alliance members continues to 
improve our understanding of ML/TF risks, 
enrich AUSTRAC’s risk assessments, enhance 
the value of industry reporting and make 
valuable contributions to operational and law 
enforcement outcomes.


19  / 240
AUSTRAC’s intelligence capability is also 
deeply integrated with and enabled by our 
international partnerships. Working with 
international partners continues to realise 
strategic and operational value for AUSTRAC 
in understanding new and evolving threats 
quickly, and generating timely and actionable 
financial intelligence. This work is enabled by 
overseas-posted staff, international networks 
and our strong presence in regional and 
international forums, including FATF, the 
Global Coalition to Fight Financial Crime, 
Egmont Group of FIUs and Asia/Pacific Group 
on Money Laundering.
ENABLING 
CAPABILITIES
AUSTRAC’s trusted and innovative enabling 
capabilities underpin our ability to effectively 
and efficiently deliver on our purpose. 
Most significant are our people and data 
capabilities, which ensure our agility and 
performance as an organisation.
Our hybrid approach to workforce, with 
our mature technology services, ensures 
AUSTRAC remains adaptable, effective and 
contemporary. We recognise that our positive 
workforce culture and the commitment and 
resilience of our staff are central to our ability 
to deliver outcomes.
Managing and enhancing the value of the 
financial data we receive from industry and 
other partners is critical to achieving our mission. 
The complex and evolving threat environment 
requires us to search for new data sources and 
develop advanced tools to analyse and correlate 
high-volume information quickly.
We continue to invest in data science 
and advanced analytics to increase our 
understanding of compliance and risk 
across the financial sector. Greater use 
of technology enables AUSTRAC to 
provide accurate and actionable financial 
intelligence, generate insights and provide 
raw data to partners in near-real time.
We cooperate with other government agencies 
to share data and match data sets to effectively 
combat ML/TF, fraud and other financial 
crime. We share information and data with 
our Fintel Alliance partners and overseas FIUs, 
and are putting in place secure collaboration 
platforms to enhance how we work together. 
We recognise the importance of our role 
as custodians of this data on behalf of the 
Australian Government, and remain committed 
to ensuring data is stored, accessed and shared 
appropriately.
We continue to enhance agency capability and 
ensure our functions, processes and products 
remain fit-for-purpose and serve the current 
and future needs of the agency.

OVERVIEW OF 
PERFORMANCE 
FRAMEWORK


We measure our performance and demonstrate 
our achievements through 26 performance 
measures, mapped against 5 strategic pillars: 
Discover, Understand, Strengthen, Disrupt 
and Optimise. These collectively contribute 
to the realisation of our purpose:
To build resilience in the 
financial system, and use 
financial intelligence and 
regulation to disrupt money 
laundering, terrorism 
financing, and other serious 
and organised crime.

Regulator performance reporting requirements 
The Attorney-General issued a Ministerial Statement of Expectations (SOE) on 9 March 2023 
as a notice of strategic direction to AUSTRAC. The SOE, together with AUSTRAC’s answering 
Statement of Intent, can be found on our website.1  
In 2021, the Australian Government set out performance expectations for regulators, in which our 
regulatory performance is to be reported through existing performance reporting requirements 
instead of a standalone regulator performance framework self-assessment. AUSTRAC uses the 
following performance measures to report against the Government’s 3 principles of regulator 
best practice.

Analysis of performance
In 2022–23 we continued to refine our performance framework and reporting methodology, and 
made a number of changes to our performance measures and targets. Throughout these statements 
we provide analysis of the factors that contributed to the outcome that was achieved and any other 
relevant disclosures and limitations to explain the results. 

We successfully delivered outcomes across all 5 pillars and achieved 22 targets (85%), while 4 targets 
(15%) were not achieved. Our 2022–23 results are slightly lower than those in 2021–22 where 25 
(96%) out of 26 measures were achieved. Performance highlights include:
•	
85% of regulatory work undertaken was proactively identified and initiated by AUSTRAC 
(page 64).
•	
84% of reporting entity respondents indicated our sector-based risk assessments had a 
moderate (or higher) influence on their risk mitigation attitudes or behaviours (page 81).
•	
Of those reporting entities who submitted their compliance report (CR) to AUSTRAC, 
99.5% submitted their report before the due date. The CR enables AUSTRAC to identify and 
understand non-compliance within our regulated entities, and assist those who require 
capability uplift in compliance (page 62).
•	
62% of our referrals to selected intelligence taskforces informed disruption activities, supported 
strategic direction of investigations and provided insights for our partner agencies (page 36).
•	
100% of our externally funded international programs realised a capability uplift, with foreign 
financial intelligence unit program participants strengthening their understanding of money 
laundering and terrorism financing risks (page 78).
•	
92.7% of respondents rated the impact of AUSTRAC’s data available via our Analyst WorkBench 
as having an impact on their work (page 93).

AUSTRAC is an active member and contributor to national and state taskforces that focus on a range 
of matters including money laundering, terrorism financing, organised crime, child exploitation, 
drugs, fraud, corruption and tax evasion. When AUSTRAC detects transactions or patterns of 
behaviour in our data holdings that indicate criminal activity, we undertake analysis to develop an 
actionable intelligence product, such as an intelligence referral. We provide these referrals to our 
partners to inform their disruption activities. For the purpose of this measure outcome refers to a 
positive action taken by the stakeholder to progress their matter/purpose and may include, but is not 
limited to, pursuing an operational outcome, opening a new line of investigative inquiry or enabling 
a disruption option. 
This measure demonstrates that AUSTRAC’s financial intelligence (in this instance, referrals) provides 
value to selected taskforces by enabling them to undertake actions towards the disruption 
of crime and/or the protection of Australia. Intelligence is often about building a picture. It might 
take multiple referrals before an outcome is realised, and it is therefore unlikely that our referrals 
to outcomes ratio will reach 1:1 (i.e. 100%) and we have selected our target accordingly.

This is the first year we have used this measure, and we have limited our assessment of 
performance to the following selected taskforces to test our ability to accurately capture 
this information:  
•	
Counter Foreign Interference Taskforce (CFITF)3
•	
Joint Threat Finance Taskforce (JTFG)
•	
Money Laundering Taskforce (MLTF)
•	
Serious Financial Crime Taskforce (SFCT).
During 2022–23, AUSTRAC made a total of 220 referrals to the 4 taskforces in scope, of which 
137 had generated an outcome at 30 June 2023 (62%). More information on outcomes generated 
from these referrals is found in Table 2.

We sampled a selected subset of taskforces for this measure that provides an indicative 
representation of the value of our referrals, however we recognise limiting this measure 
to selected taskforces means we may not be capturing or demonstrating the full span 
of our work.
•	
This measure only considers outcomes generated from referrals made in the same 
reporting period (it does not consider outcomes generated by referrals made in 
previous reporting periods). Noting that it can take a significant amount of time for 
operational outcomes to eventuate from referrals, it may be unlikely that at a large 
number of referrals made in one reporting period will have an operational outcome 
in that same reporting period.

to have links to alleged members of a transnational criminal organisation through partial 
property ownership and joint control of its bank account. The report was shared with a law 
enforcement agency (LEA) who noted that it identified previously unknown information 
and links that related to a theme of operational interest. The LEA partner also stated: ‘This 
product corroborates current … intelligence and identifies strong new opportunities 
for targeting of persons of interest particularly in relation to unexplained wealth, money 
laundering, proceeds of crime and tax evasion. The transnational aspect of the movement 
of money… is also of significant interest.’

AUSTRAC analysis uncovered a new methodology used to purchase child sexual 
exploitation material via a publicly available app. The app allows customers to transfer funds 
via a linked Australian issued debit card, instantly, to other users registered with the app, but 
the identity of users is concealed under userIDs. Following AUSTRAC reporting, Queensland 
Police Service (QPS) and the Australian Centre to Counter Child Exploitation (ACCCE) 
initiated an investigation into this methodology and high-risk networks/individuals that are 
using the app to purchase and sell child sexual exploitation material.
•	
Fintel Alliance produced financial crime guides covering trade-based money laundering 
and child exploitation that were published on AUSTRAC’s website, as well as a threat alert 
on non-fungible tokens (NFT) that was sent to all Digital Currency Exchanges (DCEs) as well 
as key partners. Feedback has included partners referencing or promoting the products, 
including the Financial Action Taskforce (FATF) referencing points in their Money Laundering 
and Terrorist Financing Associated with Arts, Antiquities and other Cultural Objects report.

AUSTRAC analysed SMR data linked to tax practitioners over a 12 month period to identify 
any instances of suspicious financial activity reported by AUSTRAC’s regulated population. 
The report surfaced a number of individuals associated with structured cash withdrawals, 
cash deposits followed by outgoing international transfers, unusual gaming activity, and 
associations with known organised crime figures. The Tax Practitioners Board (TPB) observed 
that AUSTRAC’s report identified previously unknown information and links, and initiated 
further internal intelligence assessments. TPB also stated, ‘The product is an excellent 
start to expanding our understanding of the intelligence available to the Commonwealth 
on potential financial mischiefs, and assists us in drawing a more holistic picture for risk 
assessment purposes’.

AUSTRAC analysis of funds flows between Australia and Pacific Island Nations revealed 
the identity of an encrypted online persona. AUSTRAC produced a series of reports that 
identified instances of payments made to and from persons of interest and specific sectors 
of interest.

As Australia’s FIU, AUSTRAC embraces collaboration with prioritised foreign FIUs to respond to the 
global nature of the ML/TF risks and threats. We exchange information and intelligence with these 
foreign FIUs and leverage international experience to inform emerging trends and issues. Financial 
intelligence exchanges refer to incoming and outgoing requests and/or spontaneous disclosures 
of financial intelligence or information.

Analysis of results
During 2022–23, AUSTRAC published 10 downloadable guidance products with an average of 
691 downloads within 3 months of publication, and an average of 995 downloads for the whole 
financial year. This is a reduction from our 2021–22 results, and this performance target was 
not achieved. Our target for this measure was baselined on our 2021–22 results in which we 
developed products for a wider audience and therefore had a higher number of downloads. In 
2022–23, the majority of the products AUSTRAC published were developed for specific industry 
sectors, rather than being aimed broadly for the 17,000 reporting entities. Tailoring our products 
to maximise their impact in higher risk areas this year has resulted in a lower number 
of downloads overall due to the smaller, more targeted, external audience. Despite the lower 
than expected number of downloads, newly published web-based advice and guidance had 
an average of 2,140 unique views for 2022–23 as a whole.

AUSTRAC tailors guidance to stakeholder requirements to provide a clear interpretation of the 
AML/CTF Act and Rules and collaborates on current draft guidance and future guidance priorities 
with key industry associations. We often include guiding questions, note good and bad practices 
and use worked examples within our guidance to clarify reporting entity obligations. Our internal 
Advice and Guidance Working Group (AGWG) enables a cohesive AUSTRAC approach to the 
development of education and guidance. The AGWG includes representatives from across the 
organisation and identifies, prioritises and coordinates education and guidance development 
in line with AUSTRAC’s Advice and Guidance Content Model. 
Published downloadable guidance products during the period include sector-based risk assessments 
aimed at bullion dealers, the remittance sector and the superannuation sector (see measure 3.9.) as 
well as AML/CTF guidance for pubs and clubs (see measure 3.3.). For more information on web-based 
guidance materials see measure 2.3.
We continued to develop campaigns that leveraged the appropriate channels to inform and 
engage our target audiences. We also used our communication channels to support supervisory 
regulatory activities.8 AUSTRAC launched an enhanced website on 26 June 2023 which draws upon 
user experience best practice to provide improved access and visibility of guidance materials to 
AUSTRAC’s industry stakeholders. The improved structure and focus on accessibility helps reporting 
entities find relevant, clear and concise guidance and information. 
Previously, industry specific guidance was located deeper in the website menu structure and 
led users to a filtered search page, rather than providing tailored guidance, resources and news.

AUSTRAC delivered 23 interactive virtual workshops to approximately 600 newly enrolled/
registered reporting entities (with some attending multiple workshops) during 2022–23 as part of 
our reporting entity induction program. This program is designed for reporting entities who have 
recently enrolled or registered with AUSTRAC to improve their understanding of their AML/CTF 
obligations. The induction program consists of 3 workshops covering AML/CTF fundamentals, 
risk assessments and quality reporting. During 2022–23 AUSTRAC professionally recorded these 
workshops as part of a live webinar format to create efficiencies in resourcing and provide more 
consistent messaging to participants. 
AUSTRAC also released 4 e-learning modules this financial year ranging from introductory 
information on AML/CTF obligations to more complex issues such as enhanced customer due 
diligence and suspicious matter reporting . This completes our suite of 8 modules available for 
recently enrolled reporting entities complementing the induction program. These modules can 
be found on AUSTRAC’s website.9

Surveys issued as part of the workshops and e-learning modules were used to determine if a 
participant’s understanding of their AML/CTF obligations had improved10 based on a 6 point 
scale.11 Of the survey respondents, 72.5% reported a MODERATE or higher improvement in their 
understanding of AML/CTF obligations as a result. Respondent feedback for the workshops was 
largely positive, with participants praising the content and interactive nature of the webinars 
and indicating that they are a useful introduction to reporting obligations. When the e-learning 
modules were launched to all reporting entities, initial feedback was not as positive as anticipated. 
We believe this is largely due to users not realising they are designed for those new to AML/CTF. 
To manage user expectations, we have added more information on the landing page clarifying the 
intended audience.

In 2022–23, AUSTRAC employed our annual external agency performance survey  to obtain data 
for this measure. We surveyed 33 industry association participants representing our reporting 
entities, with multiple contacts identified at some associations. Overall, 9 responses were received. 
67% of respondents to the survey assessed the usefulness of AUSTRAC’s guidance materials to be 
MODERATELY useful or higher, compared to 100% in 2021–22. As our result is below our target of 72% 
or greater, we have assessed this measure as not achieved.

One respondent rated AUSTRAC’s guidance as ‘not at all useful’ and commented that more 
prescription in guidance was needed. We emphasise within our published guidance and to reporting 
entities that our guidance should be adopted on a risk basis. That is, it is up to reporting entities to 
apply guidance to their own unique circumstances as reasonably practicable and therefore guidance 
cannot be prescriptive for every designated service, industry or circumstance. AUSTRAC will continue 
to regularly consult and incorporate industry feedback to improve the utility of guidance.

ASSISTING CUSTOMERS WHO DON’T HAVE STANDARD FORMS 
OF IDENTIFICATION
AUSTRAC is committed to supporting financial inclusion and is working with financial institutions to 
balance due diligence with a flexible and compassionate approach to requirements for customers to 
provide identity documents to access their services. In December 2022, AUSTRAC published updated 
guidance on our website on ‘Assisting customers who don’t have standard forms of identification’ to 
help superannuation funds and banks to use a flexible approach to customer identification processes 
to support people from diverse backgrounds and in challenging circumstances access the financial 
services they need.
Under the AML/CTF Act, if a customer cannot produce standard identification documents, banks and 
other regulated businesses can use alternative ways to verify their customer’s identity. Our guidance 
assists our reporting entities to adopt a risk-based approach to customer identification for customers 
who they assess pose a lower ML/TF risk to ensure temporary or systemic barriers do not prevent  
community members from gaining access to financial services. The guidance update included 
additional examples of which customers may require a flexible approach, alternative identification 
options that are reliable and independent and examples of a flexible approach in action.  
AUSTRAC consulted with a broad range of industry groups, including the Australian Banking 
Association (ABA), the Australian Institute of Superannuation Trustees and many community 
organisations to update this guidance. From December 2022 to 30 June 2023, the guidance has 
received 15,128 unique page views, with user feedback largely positive. 82% of feedback survey 
responses identified that the guidance was useful. Feedback also noted that the inclusion of practical 
examples made the guidance particularly helpful. AUSTRAC will continue to identify opportunities 
to promote financial inclusion in accordance with legislative obligations.

Seventy-seven intelligence products were sampled and assessed by 2 reviewers – one reviewer from 
within the Intelligence Products team and one reviewer from the broader Intelligence division. Of the 
77 products assessed, 64 (83%) were assessed to have met at least 7 standards and 41 (53%) met all 8 
standards. We take products having met at least 7 standards as the minimum for compliance against 
this measure. The sample consisted of each type of our suite of intelligence products disseminated, 
ranging from more complex tactical intelligence reports to information reports which provide limited 
analysis and assessment. Sampled products were found to be mostly assessment-rich, clear, coherent, 
defensible and relevant. Areas for future improvement focus on balancing conciseness of intelligence 
products with sufficient detail to support assessments. 
In May 2023, AUSTRAC developed and implemented focused training sessions for analysts regarding 
the standards. We anticipate as analysts become more familiar with the criteria and application of best 
practice writing standards, we will see improvements in the quality of our intelligence products and 
impact for our stakeholders.

There may be subjective assessment and bias by the assessor. To alleviate this bias, 
2 reviewers were used to review each product in the sample to determine whether it met

AUSTRAC disseminates intelligence products to our domestic and international partners on a wide 
variety of topics. In 2022–23 AUSTRAC employed our annual external agency performance survey 
to assess the impact of these intelligence products and surveyed 80 partners, consisting of 39 
domestic and 41 international partners (72 partners; 30 domestic, 42 international in 2021–22). 
57 stakeholders completed the survey, consisting of 20 domestic and 37 international respondents 
(56 participants; 28 domestic, 28 international in 2021–22). 
71% of respondents reported AUSTRAC’s intelligence products had a MODERATE or higher level 
impact on their understanding of vulnerabilities in the financial system. This is a decrease on the result 
from 2021–22 (80%), however as noted in ‘AUSTRAC’s agency performance survey 2022–23’ section, 
there was a change in distribution methodology this year, impacting direct comparability of data 
between reporting periods. 27% of respondents provided a rating of neutral or lower, however did 
not provide qualitative feedback on what AUSTRAC would need to do differently for them to give a 
higher rating.

In 2022–23, AUSTRAC instituted a new centralised dissemination process for intelligence products. As 
part of this process, a feedback form is included alongside each product requesting feedback from the 
recipient. Feedback was recorded against 79 individual products (18%) and indicated that AUSTRAC’s 
products provided new and unique insights and assisted stakeholders with ongoing investigations,

The annual compliance report (CR) is an important tool for AUSTRAC to understand compliance 
trends across reporting entities. The CR consists of a questionnaire, exploring the entity’s 
compliance with AML/CTF obligations. It covers reporting entities’ business activities for the 
previous reporting period and is required under the AML/CTF Act.  Information provided through 
the CR is used to identify anomalies in responses, generate alerts where answers indicate non-
compliance and an overall risk rating is calculated for each submitted compliance report based on 
any anomalies identified. Not only does the data support compliance uplift for individual entities, 
it provides AUSTRAC with a strategic view of compliance across the regulated population. 
The 2022 Compliance Report (CR 2022) process commenced in January 2023 with lodgements 
from reporting entities received between January and March 2023. AUSTRAC communicates to 
reporting entities prior to, and during the compliance report period to encourage responses. 
To improve the accuracy of the data and strengthen AUSTRAC’s understanding of the reporting 
population, some questions in the CR 2022 were adjusted. For 2022, new questions were 
introduced asking reporting entities whether they provided designated services in 2022 and 
whether they plan to continue providing services. Industry specific questions were also included 
to ask DCE providers about their operating models, products and reporting volumes. Additional 
response options were provided in the questions asking about AUSTRAC feedback and guidance, 
which resulted in an increase in the number of entities responding to these questions.

In 2022–23, 71% of reporting entities completing the report indicated that they had strengthened 
their AML/CTF controls after AUSTRAC engagement, exceeding our target of 67% or greater and 
a small decrease on our result from 2021–22. We continue to focus on improving lodgement rates 
and determining the impact of AUSTRAC engagement as a part of future CR cycles.

We use a risk-based approach for responding to entities who have provided responses in the CR 
suggesting potential non-compliance with their obligations under the AML/CTF Act. We also use 
the results to target and tailor educative/outreach activities and supervisory campaigns,13 with one 
undertaken in 2022–23 targeting reporting entities who have not been lodging their CR but have 
an obligation to do so.


CR 2022 NON-LODGEMENT CAMPAIGN
While AUSTRAC’s regulated population is aware of and understands the requirement to lodge 
the CR on an annual basis, non-lodgement rates have remained largely static over the last 3 years 
(between 18 to 25%). From April to June 2023, AUSTRAC undertook a non-lodgement campaign to 
identify reporting entities who had a requirement to lodge the CR 2022 but did not do so. AUSTRAC 
issued warning letters to 267 reporting entities that did not lodge the CR 2022 and for whom it 
was a first time breach. The aim of the enforcement engagement is to create ‘general deterrence’ 
amongst AUSTRAC’s regulated population and to increase the number of CRs submitted during 
the lodgement period in subsequent years (evidenced by results in measure 3.2.).

As outlined in measure 3.1., AUSTRAC’s regulated reporting entities are required to submit a CR from 
1 January to 31 March each year with communications occurring with reporting entities prior to and 
throughout the CR period. Submitting timely CRs demonstrates reporting entities’ awareness and 
commitment to their AML/CTF obligations. The CR enables AUSTRAC to identify and understand non-
compliance within our regulated entities, and assist those who require capability uplift in compliance. 
Reporting entities who are required to submit a CR and fail to do so by the lodgement deadline of 
31 March may be subject to enforcement actions by AUSTRAC. Of the 7,820 reporting entities who 
completed the CR 2022, 7,780 (99.5%) submitted their report before the due date, an increase on our 
2021–22 results and exceeding our target.

During 2022, AUSTRAC undertook a CR serious non-compliance campaign to improve compliance 
rates. The campaign involved 3 phases conducted between April and September 2022. AUSTRAC 
engaged with approximately 300 reporting entities over the course of the campaign, of which 
approximately 44% were able to demonstrate that their responses were provided in error or otherwise 
not non-compliant. We also provided detailed advice and feedback to 168 reporting entities who 
were identified as being non-compliant or potentially non-compliant with their AML/CTF obligations. 
In the final phase of the campaign approximately 100 reporting entities were surveyed to assess the 
relevancy of the information provided. 59 reporting entities responded to this questionnaire with 34 
reporting entities (58%) indicating the feedback provided was relevant and they had updated their 
AML/CTF programs and procedures as a result.

AUSTRAC uses a variety of regulatory tools and powers tailored to the level of risk posed by the 
entities we regulate and their circumstances. These range from education and collaboration 
through to regulatory interventions and enforcement. 
During 2022–23, 85% of regulatory work conducted was proactively identified and initiated by 
AUSTRAC. The language of this measure was changed from 2021–22 to more accurately represent 
the intent of the measure – demonstrating the amount of regulatory work undertaken proactively 
based on instances of non-compliance identified by AUSTRAC, as opposed to regulatory work 
undertaken reactively following entities voluntarily disclosing instances of non-compliance.

For the purposes of this measure, regulatory work includes supervisory matters (including triage 
matters, reviewable registration decisions and supervision matters) and enforcement investigations. 
•	
Triage matters—potential or actual non-compliance identified and triaged by AUSTRAC
•	
Reviewable registration decisions—cancellation, suspension or refusal of registration, or 
registration with conditions imposed for remittance service providers and DCE providers, 
made by the AUSTRAC CEO
•	
Supervision matters—campaigns and assessments to determine compliance under the 
AML/CTF Act 
•	
Enforcement investigations—investigations into alleged contraventions of the AML/CTF Act. 
AUSTRAC’s regulatory operations use a targeting and prioritisation (TAP) model to support 
our risk-based approach to regulation.14 In 2022–23, the TAP model was enhanced to improve 
AUSTRAC’s understanding of compliance risk across the regulated population. It considers internal 
and external inputs, including an entity’s transaction and suspicious matter reporting, compliance 
history, information from partner agencies, their customers, and the threat environment in which 
the financial sector operates.

UN-ENROLLED PUBS AND CLUBS CAMPAIGN
From March 2023 to July 2023, AUSTRAC conducted a campaign involving 194 pubs and clubs 
licensed to operate electronic gaming machines (EGMs) by the Queensland Office of Liquor and 
Gaming Regulation (OLGR) which could not be linked to an AUSTRAC reporting entity enrolment. 
Of the 194 entities, there were 65 venues that were licensed to operate 16 or more EGMs. Entities 
that have less than 15 EGMs have limited AML/CTF obligations, such as the requirement  to lodge 
SMRs, whereas entities with 16 or more EGMS have additional AML/CTF obligations such as the 
requirement to have an AML/CTF program and to lodge annual compliance reports.
The aim of this campaign was to engage with these entities to confirm their enrolment status, 
delivery of designated services, and where required, enrol them with AUSTRAC. The scope was 
limited to enrolment and providing guidance materials, and did not include capability uplift of newly 
enrolled businesses. AUSTRAC worked with OLGR and industry representative bodies to maximise the 
effectiveness of the campaign and achieved an outcome rate of 78%, as follows:
•	
115 entities enrolled with AUSTRAC, including 54 entities with 16 or more EGM entitlements. 
•	
38 entities were not required to be enrolled despite holding an EGM entitlement. The reasons 
include: not commencing offering designated services, not having operational EGMs, or the 
entity no longer trading (for example it may have permanently closed during the COVID-19 
pandemic or suspended EGM entitlements). 
There are currently 41 entities that are not enrolled. Of these, 20 entities are currently working with 
AUSTRAC to enrol as they have not been able to enrol due to technical issues, or have expressed their 
willingness to enrol following some recent staff or ownership changes.

On 30 November 2022, AUSTRAC instituted civil penalty proceedings against The Star Pty 
Limited and The Star Entertainment Qld Limited. This action follows proactive AUSTRAC

•	
On 7 December 2022, AUSTRAC instituted civil penalty proceedings against SkyCity Adelaide 
Pty Ltd. This action follows proactive AUSTRAC compliance work within the casino sector which 
led to the investigation. Enforcement identified serious and systemic non-compliance by 
SkyCity with its AML/CTF obligations. The proceedings against the Star are currently before the 
Federal Court and have the potential for a civil penalty order to be made.
•	
The Crown Melbourne and Crown Perth civil penalty proceedings reached a key milestone in 
May 2023 when AUSTRAC entered a settlement agreement with Crown, with Crown admitting 
contraventions of the AML/CTF legislation. The matter was heard in the Federal Court of 
Australia on 10 and 11 July 2023 to determine penalty, with the Court ordering a civil penalty 
of $450 million to be paid over 2 years. The matter was previously proactively identified by 
AUSTRAC following compliance work in the casino sector.

In order to ensure the AML/CTF Rules and policy settings are appropriately tuned to both mitigate 
risks to the financial sector and minimise the regulatory burden on industry, AUSTRAC regularly 
engages with reporting entities and industry stakeholders. Examples of engagement throughout 
2022–23 are set out below:
Engagement on policy settings
•	
Collaborated with reporting entities on policy settings regarding the reforms to Part 4 of 
the AML/CTF Act (cross-border movement of monetary instruments) and its operation, 
modifications to reporting obligations and amendments sought to the modification. 
•	
Conducted bilateral meetings with the Australian Banking Association (ABA) in September 
2022 about the risks posed to banks by the Optus data breach. AUSTRAC proposed a workable 
solution for the banks to have access to the information they needed to manage and mitigate 
risks, which was presented to, and accepted by, government.

•	
Joined the Attorney-General’s Department (AGD) for a discussion with ABA policy officers on 19 
October 2022 about the impact of the changes to bearer negotiable instruments reporting on 
banks and the government’s upcoming reform agenda.
•	
Facilitated quarterly forum with ABA and the Australian Financial Markets Association to allow 
industry to discuss a range of regulatory and policy issues with AUSTRAC and AGD. 
•	
Coordinated whole of agency meetings with DCE industry associations. The meetings updated 
the industry representatives on AML/CTF policy, regulatory and intelligence developments and 
sought input to inform Australia’s engagement with the FATF Virtual Assets Contact Group.
•	
Presented at the Institute of Public Accountants’ inaugural Cryptocurrency Conference on 
30 August 2022 on the ML/TF risks of digital currencies and to raise awareness of AML/CTF 
regulation and international developments within the accountancy sector.
•	
Supported AGD in the development of a public consultation paper and their engagement 
with industry stakeholders. This includes participation in roundtables across the legal, financial 
technology, DCE, real estate, gambling, accounting, banking, precious metals and stones and 
remittance sectors.

Engagement on AML/CTF Rules
•	
AUSTRAC formally consulted on proposed amendments to the AML/CTF Rules, and held regular 
informal engagements with reporting entities and industry bodies about the current operation 
of the Act and Rules. Following the announcement by the Attorney-General in April 2023 
on proposed AML/CTF reforms, AUSTRAC will seek to only progress machinery or other 
necessary changes to the AML/CTF Rules during the reform process, to avoid the burden 
on stakeholders resulting from additional consultation on AML/CTF Rules changes. Industry 
has been informed and is supportive of this approach noting the current and ongoing 
consultations on the AML/CTF reforms.
As in measures 2.3 and 3.5, in 2022–23 AUSTRAC employed our annual external agency performance 
survey15 to seek feedback on industries’ perceptions of AUSTRAC collaboration. 67% of respondents 
assessed the usefulness of AUSTRAC’s guidance materials to be MODERATELY useful or higher, 
compared to 75% in 2021–22. As our result is below our target of 72% or greater, we have assessed 
this measure as not achieved.

resulting in the lower than desired result. It is also noted that some responses were related to 
guidance rather than Rules and policy development.

to build reporting entity trust including:
•	
providing guidance in multiple, accessible forms, through our products (in different languages 
where possible), workshops, e-learning and one-on-one engagement
•	
enhancing our website to provide greater accessibility and visibility of our products by industry

AUSTRAC through this measure, as demonstrated by the increasing targets we have set over the 
coming years in our 2023–27 corporate plan.

included Australian Institute of Superannuation Trustees (AIST) members and other staff from 
across the superannuation industry, government and community groups to discuss progress in 
addressing challenges Indigenous Australians experience with accessing and engaging with their 
superannuation. AUSTRAC’s presentation focused on how superannuation funds can use the updated 
guidance to develop flexible customer identification procedures to ensure that temporary or systemic 
barriers do not prevent community members from gaining access to financial services, including 
their superannuation savings. ASIC reported that AUSTRAC provided an invaluable contribution that 
enriched the discussions towards addressing the unique challenges faced by First Nations peoples 
in accessing and engaging with their superannuation.

The AUSTRAC CEO is authorised, where appropriate, to issue exemptions from, and make 
modifications to, the AML/CTF Act. These powers give AUSTRAC flexibility to promote proportionate, 
effective and efficient regulation consistent with the AML/CTF regime’s risk-based approach. 
During 2022–23, 186 exemptions and modifications were granted from 200 sought (93%), an 
increase on results from 2021–22 and exceeding our target of 75% or greater. AUSTRAC will only 
grant an exemption where the associated ML/TF risk is low, and the exemption is clearly required 
and appropriate in all circumstances. Exemptions can be made in one of 3 ways — through the 
AML/CTF Act, the AML/CTF Rules or an exemption instrument. For the purposes of this measure, 
we are focused on when an application is made to AUSTRAC to have exemptions from or 
modifications to provisions of the AML/CTF Act granted to a specific reporting entity. 
The following definitions apply:
•	
Exemption refers to a general exemption by Rule under section 247 of the AML/CTF Act, 
an exemption by the AUSTRAC CEO under section 248, or an exemption under chapter 
75 of the AML/CTF Rules. 
•	
Modification refers to a modification by the AUSTRAC CEO under section 248 of the 
AML/CTF Act.

receive and grant a significant number of exemption applications related to Part 11 of the AML/CTF 
Act (secrecy and access) and particularly section 123 (the tipping off offence).

•	
Using this measure over the past 2 years, we identified the measure assumes that each 
application for an exemption or modification reflects a legitimate issue with the AML/CTF 
Act, which is not always the case. There is no specific threshold for exemption or 
modification applications that should be granted. 
•	
Alongside this context, we assessed this measure as being more operational or supportive in 
nature, rather than directly contributing to AUSTRAC’s strategic purpose and impact. As such, 
we have retired this measure from our 2023–27 corporate plan, with effect from 2023–24.

/  AUSTRAC ANNUAL REPORT 2022-23
AUSTRAC collaborates with regional FIUs to share knowledge, tradecraft and information in order to 
improve their capability to detect, understand, and disrupt money laundering, terrorism financing and 
other serious crimes. In support of this objective, we deliver international development programs with 
foreign FIUs. 
During 2022–23, 3 externally funded international capability development programs were completed, 
with the funder—Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade (DFAT)—confirming that all programs 
served their purpose. See measure 3.8. for more information on specific program activities delivered 
during 2022–23. 

Programs completed during 2022–23 include:


KSP-AUSTRAC Program (Indonesia)
This program, funded by DFAT under the Prospera Program (a grant-funded partnership between 
DFAT and Indonesia’s Coordinating Ministry for the Economy) concluded on 31 December 2022. 
The objectives were to support Indonesia’s bid for FATF membership through enhancing Indonesia’s 
AML/CTF regime, and support enhanced bilateral engagement with Indonesia through the Executive 
Office of the President of the Republic of Indonesia (KSP 19). Both are strategic priorities for Australia. 
DFAT has confirmed the program met its 2 objectives. 


AUSTRAC Pacific Islands Partnership Program (APIPP)
The APIPP sought to uplift the capability of intelligence analysts within Pacific FIUs and promote 
greater regional collaboration in identifying and combating ML/TF risks in the South Pacific region. 
This work was complemented by another Pacific-focused program AUSTRAC delivered – ‘Project 
TAIPAN’. During 2022–23 APIPP focused on expanding and facilitating the work of the PFIC including 
by hosting Tradecraft Tuesday sessions, Virtual Asset Webinar Series and coordinating TAIPAN 
installations in Pacific FIUs. The work of APIPP has been well received in the Pacific and whole 
of government stakeholders. 
Following the success of the program, DFAT sponsored a new policy proposal (NPP) for AUSTRAC to 
deliver a significantly enhanced APIPP which began after initial funding concluded in March 2023.  
This new phase of the program is funded to 2025–26.

Project TAIPAN
Project TAIPAN involved the installation of a low cost, simple and secure database and analysis 
platform across 12 Pacific FIUs in 2022–23. TAIPAN makes it easy for FIUs to collect, analyse and 
exchange financial intelligence. It provides advanced data analytics, visual analytical tools and 
interactive dashboards to better detect criminal activity. The TAIPAN platform rollout complemented 
the training packages delivered under the APIPP.
The success of the Project TAIPAN has seen DFAT support a significant funding uplift in the program 
with TAIPAN Phase 2 rolling out from 2023 to 2025 (initial program funding concluded on 30 March 
2023). This consists of TAIPAN installation in Samoa, Kiribati, Marshall Islands, Palau, Tuvalu and PNG 
FIUs. Phase 2 has been rolled into the broader APIPP so there will be only one Pacific focused program 
moving forward.
The following ongoing programs were delivered during 2022–23, but were not due for completion 
in this period and have not been counted towards AUSTRAC’s performance against this measure:
•	
Mekong Program—strengthening the AML/CTF regimes of Mekong countries by uplifting the 
financial analytic capability of the Mekong FIUs through professional development and regional 
engagement.
•	
ASEAN Program—enhancing the ASEAN-Australia Strategic Partnership through the delivery 
of the Regional Financial Intelligence Analyst Course (RFIAC).
•	
Philippines Program—strengthening the AML/CTF regime of the Philippines and providing 
support to primary Philippines partner agencies – FIU, LEAs and Intelligence and Justice – to 
address grey listing action items, enhance justice responses, counter terrorism financing and 
violent extremism.  
Further context
•	
There is a continuing limitation of funder satisfaction being provided verbally and 
not against a specific methodology such as feedback surveys. We are able to see the 
demonstrated satisfaction of DFAT with AUSTRAC programs from continued provision 
of funding and ongoing work with AUSTRAC. 
•	
In reporting against this measure over the past 2 years, we determined that there is 
some duplication with measure 3.8. As such, as outlined in our 2023–27 corporate plan, 
this measure has been retired with effect from 2023-24. Results against this measure will

By enhancing partner capabilities in our region, AUSTRAC supports regional and international efforts 
to strengthen the global financial system. Following international development activities, we have 
seen evidence of capability uplift within our partners including increased knowledge of the role 
of FIUs, and improved ability to apply knowledge and skills to their analytical work and tradecraft. 
100% of the 35 externally funded international development program activities delivered during 
2022–23 realised a capability uplift. For more details of the objectives and outcomes of the overall 
programs, see measure 3.7.

A national risk assessment of proliferation financing in Australia was published in December 2022.20
The aim of these sector-based risk assessments was to assist reporting entities in the remittance, bullion 
and superannuation sectors to identify and disrupt ML/TF risks to Australia’s financial system, and 
report suspected crimes to AUSTRAC. AUSTRAC consulted with several relevant reporting entities in 
developing these risk assessments to collect information and insights specific to each sector. Surveys 
were issued in January 2023 to those reporting entities consulted, to understand the impact of the 
publications. Of the respondents:
•	
84% indicated the publications had a moderate (or higher) influence on their risk mitigation 
attitudes or behaviours
•	
88% indicated the publications had resulted in a moderate (or higher) level of understanding 
of ML/TF risks in their sector

BULLION SECTOR RISK ASSESSMENTS
AUSTRAC’s ML/TF risk assessment of Australia’s bullion sector was published in September 2022. 
The development of the risk assessment involved consultation and engagement with government 
partners as well as 15 bullion sector reporting entities. The primary threats facing the bullion sector 
are tax evasion, money laundering, fraud and scams.
Criminals may buy and sell bullion to launder money as it has a high intrinsic and stable value, can 
be converted and melted down into various forms and enables anonymity when transferring value. 
This makes it easy to conceal and move across domestic or international borders, and convert back 
to legitimate funds. The most significant factors exposing the bullion sector to ML/TF vulnerabilities 
include the sector’s high exposure to cash, the ability to store and move funds within the sector, dealers 
who also operate as bullion refiners (increasing their foreign jurisdiction risk and the risk associated with 
refining scrap precious metal), and the delivery channels used by bullion dealers, including face-to-face, 
online, phone and third party arrangements. AUSTRAC assesses the bullion sector faces a medium level 
of ML/TF vulnerability. AUSTRAC’s bullion sector risk assessment was well-received by industry and 
contributed to the strengthening of the sector, with 83% of industry survey respondents reporting that 
it had a moderate or higher influence on their risk mitigation attitudes or behaviours.

Fintel Alliance partners work together with AUSTRAC, sharing and analysing financial intelligence to 
investigate and disrupt criminal and terrorist activities. We have an established program targeting 
priority themes, such as crimes targeting vulnerable community members, professional money 
laundering, and threats to Australia’s domestic and international interests. Refer to the Fintel Alliance 
section of this report for more information on the Fintel Alliance work program. 
Information generated from suspicious matter reports (SMRs) is crucial in identifying potential illegal 
activity and assists AUSTRAC to detect and disrupt the flow of illegal funds through Australia’s financial 
system. Improving the quality, quantity and timeliness of SMRs provides us the best chance to detect, 
deter and disrupt criminal activity. 
OUR PERFORMANCE - STRENGTHEN


/  AUSTRAC ANNUAL REPORT 2022-23
During 2022–23, Fintel Alliance moved away from work targeting fraud against government support 
programs to applying lines of effort focused on crimes affecting our most vulnerable community 
members, and networked and complex financial crime. These areas are reflective of projects being 
undertaken by Fintel Alliance:
•	
detecting child exploitation material payments
•	
scam activity
•	
text fields being used as a method of criminal communication or abuse
•	
efforts to mitigate the money laundering risks posed by money mules. 

AUSTRAC received 8,433 SMRs relating to the Fintel Alliance work program during the reporting 
period, exceeding our target, initially selected from our internal baseline results in 2021–22 (5,348). 
The increase in scam and money mule activity within Australia is reflected in SMR submissions this 
financial year. Whilst this topic is not specific to current Fintel Alliance projects, we are seeing this 
activity intersecting across many ongoing projects

Strategic analysis reports refer to strategic insights or briefs that have been developed to provide 
key judgements on a specific topic or issue, to add value to our stakeholders’ understanding of the 
subject and its implications in the Australian context. This measure allows us to demonstrate the 
advantage of AUSTRAC’s unique role as an AML/CTF regulator and FIU where financial intelligence 
can be utilised to inform AML/CTF risk mitigation by our regulated entities. 
Fourteen strategic analysis reports were developed during 2022–23, of which 6 (43%) were sanitised 
and repurposed for sharing with selected reporting entities and/or Fintel Alliance members.
Examples of strategic analysis reports sanitised and repurposed include:
•	
Strategic Insights: Indicators of sanctions evasion strategies – developed in response to 
increased sanctions against Russia, to provide a range of reporting entities, including banks, 
remitters and DCEs, an overview of potential sanctions evasion strategies and indicators to 
consider within transaction monitoring programs.
•	
Strategic Insights: Impact of interest rate rises and inflation on illicit funds flow – follows a 
product developed in 2021–22, which considered the impact of high interest rates and inflation 
on criminal entities’ willingness to continue hoarding cash, and the potential re-entry points of 
previously hoarded cash back into the Australian financial system. This paper was disseminated 
to Fintel Alliance industry members, to alert them to the likely placement of hoarded cash 
should interest rates and inflation remain high (or increase).
•	
Key threats & vulnerabilities in the Australian casino sector – disseminated to all 13 
Australian casinos and state-based gambling regulators. This report provided contemporary 
insights into the key money laundering threats and vulnerabilities faced by the Australian casino 
sector. The report was targeted to make casinos aware of key concerns facing their sector at a 
national level, enabling consideration of these factors in their enterprise risk assessment processes.

As Australia’s AML/CTF regulator and FIU, AUSTRAC is funded through an industry contribution levy. 
The levy is an annual payment that some reporting entities must pay to cover AUSTRAC’s operating 
costs, including amortisation and the annual depreciation costs of assets that we use to undertake 
regulatory and intelligence activities. Under section 9(2)(a) of the Australian Transaction Reports 
and Analysis Centre Industry Contribution Act 2011, the Minister is required to make a ministerial 
determination to set the industry contribution levy for each financial year. 
For the purposes of this measure, the following definitions applied: 
•	
Levy collection process costs are the direct staff costs incurred in undertaking the updating and 
analysis of the model, ministerial consultation, industry consultation, insurance and collection of 
the levy and management of disputes in relation to the levy. 
•	
Direct costs are represented as a portion of full time employee (FTE).
•	
Levy collection process refers to the review process and allocation of time within AUSTRAC 
associated with processing and performing levy collection activities.
This is the first year we are using this measure to monitor the efficiency of the collection process. 
In 2022–23 the levy collection process cost 0.056% of the disbursed industry contribution levy, 
meeting our target of less than 0.1% annually. AUSTRAC is continually assessing ways to improve 
the efficiency of administering this activity and is working on automating the levy calculation 
model during 2023–24.

AUSTRAC contributes to the ATO’s recovery of revenue and liabilities in 2 ways:
1. 
Contributing to the outcomes achieved by the ATO-led SFCT through the provision 
of financial intelligence (see measure 1.1. for more information on SFCT).
2. 
The provision of high-volume transaction report data via Analyst Workbench (AWB) 
and directly into ATO systems, enabling the ATO to identify undeclared foreign-source 
income and serious non-compliance (see measure 4.4. for more information on AWB).
21	 ATO cases used AUSTRAC’s data/information to contribute to $105 million of liabilities raised in 2021–22.

AUSTRAC contributions to significant CACT outcomes in 2022–23
•	
AUSTRAC provided vital financial analysis for Operation Avarus-Midas to trace the movement 
of proceeds of crime and tainted property subject to restraint. AFP charged 9 members of an 
international money laundering organisation and restrained over $150 million in Australian real 
estate, as well as significant restraints of cryptocurrency, luxury watches, vehicles and jewellery. 
AFP acknowledged that AUSTRAC had been a key partner in this investigation with its specialist 
expertise and capabilities.24
•	
In October 2022, AFP laid charges against 2 offenders for their alleged involvement in a money 
laundering syndicate responsible for laundering $4.5 million in cash. AUSTRAC provided 
financial profiles, identification of a newly opened account and details of fraudulent bank 
accounts. International funds transfer reporting was also used to identify the source of funds for 
a property purchase. Cash, accounts and real property were restrained and both were charged 
with conspiring to deal in the proceeds of general crime. 
•	
A multi-state AFP operation resulted in the arrest of an alleged syndicate involved in the import 
and extraction of 700kg of cocaine imported into Australia. Nine people were arrested and it is 
alleged the syndicate purchased a remote Queensland property to set up a cocaine extraction 
laboratory. Over $1 million in cash, a luxury watch, and a vessel suspected to be an instrument 
of crime were seized. AUSTRAC contributed to this operation through network analysis, financial 
profiling and asset identification.

OUR PERFORMANCE - DISRUPT


/  AUSTRAC ANNUAL REPORT 2022-23
As at 30 June 2023, AWB supported 5,171 active external users across 39 partner agencies. Part 11 
of the AML/CTF Act dictates what AUSTRAC information can be accessed by partner agencies, and 
under what circumstances. The AUSTRAC CEO may authorise specified officials of a Commonwealth, 
state or territory agency to access AUSTRAC information via AWB. Access arrangements are set out in 
a memorandum of understanding (MOU) between AUSTRAC and partner agencies that specifies the 
legal, security and handling requirements of AUSTRAC information. 
During 2022–23, partner agency users’ accessed AUSTRAC data via AWB 10,043,569 times, where 
‘accessed’ is defined as a single search event in AWB, inclusive of filtering instances. The partner agencies 
with the highest AWB use based on number of query events were the Department of Home Affairs, AFP 
and ATO. During 2022–23, we have provided in-person and online AWB training and guidance materials 
to increase user understanding of AUSTRAC information and how to best access it through AWB.
To obtain data for this measure, we conducted a survey of AWB users to assess the impact of AWB 
data on their work as well as to understand their training needs. We received 430 responses, of which 
92.7% rated the impact of our data as having SOMEWHAT OF AN IMPACT (or higher), based on a 
7 point scale.26 This figure significantly exceeded our target of 60% or greater and is indicative of the 
high value data, tools and training made available to AUSTRAC partners.

Not reported prior to 2020–21

AUSTRAC closed the following 4 capability and transformation projects during 2022–23 and one 
in 2021–22.27
•	
Cross-border movements project—achieved 100% of its benefits on closure
•	
Alerting project—achieved 3 of its 7 (43%) benefits, and partially achieved a fourth on closure 
with the remaining benefits still to be realised 
•	
Sydney property project—achieved 3 out of 5 benefits (60%) on closure
•	
Content Management System (CMS)/CR 2022 Project—benefits are not realisable until 
January 2024 
•	
Identity and Access Management (iDAM) project (closed in 2021–22)—did not realise any 
of its benefits. 

This performance target was not achieved with only 20% of projects achieving all of their benefits as 
at 30 June 2023. This result is below our target and results from previous years.
A closed project will be considered to have realised its approved benefits only if all of the benefits 
are realised. Reasons for not realising benefits included that the benefit was not capable of being 
measured; a baseline measurement was not taken at the start of the project; the time for realising the 
benefit has not yet occurred; or the project was closed and work to realise the benefits will be done 
through operational activities. If any single benefit was not realised, then the project is considered not 
to have realised its approved benefits.
A lessons learned process was undertaken following the closure of each project. These processes 
identified issues associated with benefits ownership and monitoring once the projects had 
concluded. Through these processes, we have refined and implemented improvements to project 
governance, including clearer articulation of benefits at the beginning of projects. We expect to see 
an uplift in benefit realisation from 2023–24 onwards.

27	 The time period of 2 financial years was adopted noting the diverse nature and timeframes of projects, and that 
benefits may not be realised immediately upon closure of a project.

CROSS-BORDER MOVEMENTS
This project enabled AUSTRAC, from 17 June 2022, to accept cross-border movement reports using 
the newly developed cross-border movement of monetary instructions (CBM-MI) digital form 
available from the AUSTRAC website for the general public or through AUSTRAC Online for reporting 
entities. This new form was developed in response to the passage of the Phase 1.5 Amendment Bill 
(changing the AML/CTF Act) stipulating a single reporting requirement (as opposed to 3) which 
includes cash and bearer negotiable instruments. 
The new CBM-MI digital form can be accessed via personal devices such as mobile phones, tablets 
and PCs. All benefits initially identified were achieved:
•	
Updated business process that meets legislative changes as part of Phase 1.5 reforms. 
•	
Enhanced digital processes to enable people to complete CBM-MI forms electronically. 
•	
Updated intelligence systems to ingest new CBM-MI data.
•	
Decommission of legacy systems. 

CMS/CR 2022
The Content Management System (CMS) was developed to improve the capability and allow greater 
flexibility for business users to create the CR content each year. The CMS tool greatly reduces the 
reliance on technology resources and manual work in order to develop the CR.  
The CMS was deployed in December 2022 and used by the business team to create CR 2022, which 
went live on 1 January 2023.
The benefits, a reduced requirement of technology resources and providing business users with greater 
control over compliance report content, will be realised in January 2024 when CR 2023 is released.

SYDNEY PROPERTY
This project relocated AUSTRAC Sydney-based staff to a new safe, inclusive and modern physical 
office location and working space to undertake their activities in support of the agency’s purpose. In 
addition to the physical property component of this project, it also included a change management 
program supporting staff in adjusting to a new location (approximately 20km from the previous 
office) and to operate in a desk-sharing environment in support of AUSTRAC’s hybrid working model. 
5 benefits were identified, with the following 3 achieved upon closure of the project:
•	
AUSTRAC’s continued physical presence in Sydney 
•	
Maintain high morale and culture of AUSTRAC 
•	
Continued delivery of AUSTRAC services. 
The 2 outstanding benefits are:
•	
Greater opportunities for collaboration on joint-efforts in regulating the financial services 
sector and facilitate closer and more regular engagement with regulatory partners, such 
as ASIC and APRA.
•	
Enables greater operational engagement and collaboration with AUSTRAC’s law enforcement 
and national security partners.
While relevant benefit owners have provided qualitative evidence of the outstanding benefits of 
the new office location, being decreased travel time and improved ease of meeting with partners 
regularly and in person, AUSTRAC cannot demonstrate measurable achievement primarily due to 
a lack of baselining evidence captured prior to the move, resulting in difficulties for current benefit 
owners to quantify evidence post move. 



Further context
•	
The strict definition of this performance measure and the way project benefits are assessed 
and calculated has led to a poor performance against the target. This should not be taken to 
mean that the projects themselves were considered to have failed, or not met their overall 
purpose and objectives.
•	
As part of our annual review of performance measures, we assessed this measure as being 
more operational or supportive in nature, rather than directly contributing to AUSTRAC’s 
strategic purpose and impact. As such, we have retired this measure (as well as the Optimise 
pillar) from our 2023–27 corporate plan, with effect from 2023–24.

higher than the APS overall as well as other regulatory and similarly sized agencies . This strong result 
reflects our goal of ensuring that our staff have sufficient resources and support required to perform 
their roles effectively and contribute to AUSTRAC’s ability to protect the financial system.
During 2022–23 we continued to implement the 6 key areas of capability uplift identified 
in AUSTRAC’s Learning and Development Framework 2021–23:
•	
project and change management
•	
communication and writing skills
•	
stakeholder engagement and relationship management
•	
critical thinking and problem solving skills
•

To build these core skills, we have sourced and delivered custom training opportunities to our 
staff relating to these key areas. As our data volumes continue to increase, our investment in data 
governance and data management capabilities has become increasingly important. 
Other activities to support our staff included in person delivery of our OneAUSTRAC Leadership, 
stakeholder engagement and relationship management, and critical thinking and problem solving 
skillsets training programs. Three cohorts of APS6 and EL1 staff participated in the Emerging Leaders 
Program, with 73 staff attending. These training offerings have contributed positively to AUSTRAC’s 
ability to support staff in building and maintaining appropriate skills and capabilities needed to 
perform well. Refer to the Learning and Development section of this report for more information 
on our learning and development offerings. 
Further context
•	
Results are dependent on the willingness of AUSTRAC staff to complete the survey. 
All attempts were made to encourage participation.
•	
We are reliant on data captured and provided by a third party (APSC) for this measure, 
making it difficult for AUSTRAC to independently assure the reliability and verifiability of 
the data source and methodology. However, we consider this to be a low risk considering 
the maturity of the APS census and wide use across the APS.
•	
As part of our annual review of performance measures, we assessed this measure as being 
more operational or supportive in nature, rather than directly contributing to AUSTRAC’s 
strategic purpose and impact. As such, we have retired this measure (as well as the Optimise 
pillar) from our 2023–27 corporate plan, with effect from 2023–24. 

AUSTRAC’S agency performance survey 2022–23
This is the second year that AUSTRAC has conducted an annual external agency performance survey 
to assess performance against several performance measures and key activities in our 2022–26 
corporate plan. Five measures are assessed using this survey – 2.3, 2.5, 3.4, 3.5 and 4.3.  
AUSTRAC commissioned an external provider (JWS Research) to independently conduct both 
the 2021–22 and 2022–23 survey, analyse the data and report the results. The survey gauges the 
perceived performance and value of AUSTRAC through the eyes of our key stakeholders. The structure 
and survey questions remained similar to those used in 2021–22 with all questions using a 7 point 
scale that varied based on the metric (see Table 17). The results of each measure assessed were 
determined based on a single question in the survey specific to the respective measure.

Due to the differences between the participants who are surveyed depending which aspect of 
AUSTRAC’s operations we are assessing performance against, 2 separate surveys were conducted. 
To allow for open feedback, respondents were anonymised.


101  / 240
INDUSTRY ASSOCIATION SURVEY
For measures 2.3, 3.4 and 3.5, AUSTRAC surveyed 33 industry association participants representing 
AUSTRAC’s reporting entities, with multiple contacts identified at one association. AUSTRAC has 
several key industry associations with which it engages and those surveyed represent the overall 
reporting entity population.
Survey fieldwork began on 29 May and closed on 19 June 2023. Participants were emailed a unique, 
secure survey link to access the survey online. In this initial tranche of survey fieldwork, we received 
a small response rate resulting in a high margin of error for the results. To improve response rates, 
we re-opened this survey from 12 to 17 July 2023 and contacted all participants directly to request 
their completion of the survey. Overall, 9 responses were received. Although this is considered to 
be a sufficient sample size from which to draw a conclusion, due to the small overall sample size, 
there is a ± 27% margin of error at the 95% confidence interval. In other words, we can be 95% 
confident the real result for measures 2.3, 3.4 and 3.5 is within 27 percentage points of the reported 
result. However, we have assessed measures 2.3 and 3.4 to be not achieved as statistically they have 
not met the target. 
INTELLIGENCE PARTNER SURVEY
For measures 2.5 and 4.3, survey participants consisted of recipients of AUSTRAC’s intelligence 
products from our:
•	
domestic partners – Australian federal government departments or agencies, Australian 
law enforcement agencies, Australian state or territory departments or agencies and Fintel 
Alliance members.
•	
international partners – foreign FIUs with whom we have MOU for sharing intelligence and data. 
Survey fieldwork began on 30 May and closed on 21 June 2023. JWS Research disseminated the 
survey to domestic partners whilst our international partners were provided the survey through 
our secure international information exchange platform. Eighty partners were surveyed, consisting 
of 39 domestic and 41 international partners. 57 stakeholder participants (from 29 partners) 
completed the survey consisting of 20 domestic and 37 international respondents. 
There was a change in our survey distribution methodology between 2021–22 and 2022–23 for this 
survey. In 2021–22, a single survey link was provided to all participants. Where there were multiple 
responses from one partner agency, each response was given an equal weighting. The single 
survey link meant there was no information about how many partner agencies were represented, 
only the total number of respondents.
OUR PERFORMANCE - OPTIMISE


/  AUSTRAC ANNUAL REPORT 2022-23
In 2022–23, to align with our updated centralisation model for dissemination of our intelligence 
products, the survey was provided to a central contact within our partner agencies along with a 
request that they distribute this to other stakeholders within the agency who received intelligence 
products. Multiple responses from one partner agency were weighted to be counted once as part 
of the data. For example, this meant that responses from 7 people in one partner agency would 
carry the same weight in the final analysis as a single respondent from another partner agency. 
This weighted approach was assessed to be more appropriate and indicative of overall partner 
sentiment, and guards against disparities in partner approaches to completing surveys.
Once collected, data was de-identified and results were provided as an average of all responses 
(similar to 2021–22). This change in methodology has impacted comparability of data between 
reporting periods. This weighted approach will be used to assess performance moving forward.

ABOUT FINTEL 
ALLIANCE
Fintel Alliance is an AUSTRAC initiative, 
established in 2017 as a public-private 
partnership to increase the resilience of the 
financial sector to prevent exploitation by 
criminals, and support investigations into 
serious crime and national security matters.
Fintel Alliance brings together experts from 
financial institutions, state and Commonwealth 
law enforcement and intelligence agencies, 
and academic and research institutions. Each 
partner provides a unique perspective on 
the financial sector. Working together, Fintel 
Alliance develops shared intelligence and 
delivers innovative solutions to detect, disrupt 
and prevent money laundering and terrorism 
financing (ML/TF).
Fintel Alliance has strengthened AUSTRAC’s 
role as anti-money laundering and counter-
terrorism financing (AML/CTF) regulator and 
financial intelligence unit (FIU). By harnessing 
the resources and knowledge of industry, 
government and international partners, our 
collective ability to detect crime and share 
intelligence relevant to the financial sector 
has been enhanced.
FINTEL ALLIANCE 
OPERATIONS
Fintel Alliance enables government, law 
enforcement and industry partners to 
collectively focus on emerging crimes or 
complex crimes requiring a joint approach.
Fintel Alliance projects allow greater 
understanding of a crime type, identification 
and targeting of suspected offenders, and 
sharing learnings with a wider audience to assist 
in hardening the financial environment. At the 
closure of a project, an evaluation captures and 
shares learnings before the effort is transitioned 
into standard operational activity.


105  / 240
FINTEL ALLIANCE
Principal themes 
of operation
Fintel Alliance’s principal themes 
of operation are:
•	
crimes affecting our most vulnerable 
community members—protecting 
children, the elderly and people with 
disability
•	
exploitation of government revenues—
protecting Australia’s tax system and 
other government programs from abuse
•	
networked and complex financial 
crime—disrupting organised criminal 
enterprises that seek to exploit multiple 
businesses and industries
•	
nationally significant taskforces and 
campaigns—supporting national 
operations, including targeting Australia’s 
most wanted criminals, illicit drugs, 
transnational and serious organised 
crime, illegal firearms and support to 
other national efforts
•	
responding to regional and community 
harms—helping to address localised 
crime, regional programs and collaborate 
with regional partners
•	
technology and sophistication—
responding to the most complex 
money laundering typologies, through 
innovative approaches to data and 
information.
2022–23 
OPERATIONAL 
STRATEGY
The Fintel Alliance operational strategy outlines 
its key initiatives and strategic enablers, as well 
as how it will achieve desired outcomes and 
measure success.
Fintel Alliance activities are subject 
to oversight by the AUSTRAC CEO. Its 
governance is underpinned by a three-tiered 
structure consisting of the Fintel Alliance 
Executive Board, Management Committee 
and Operations Working Group.
Fintel Alliance places high priority on 
complex pieces of work that benefit from the 
partnership’s collective capabilities. Its work 
program aims for greater understanding of 
a crime type, identification and targeting of 
suspected offenders. Information sharing 
and collaboration occurs through methods 
including working groups, co-located 
operations hubs in Sydney and Melbourne, legal 
notices and suspicious matter reports (SMRs).


/  AUSTRAC ANNUAL REPORT 2022-23
This reporting period saw the Fintel Alliance 
Executive Board encourage Fintel Alliance 
partners to collaborate on financial crime 
problems with a broader range of partners 
in Australia and internationally. The Executive 
Board also steered Fintel Alliance partners 
towards addressing the following challenges:
•	
strengthening efforts to protect 
members of the community
•	
engaging with a wider range of partners
•	
combating threats to national security
•	
uniting international public-private 
partnership efforts to combat 
financial crime
•	
expanding the use of joint AUSTRAC 
and industry capabilities.

Suspicious matter 
reporting by theme 
of operation
Reflecting the changing environment and 
in response to the Fintel Alliance Executive 
Board challenges, Fintel Alliance redirected 
its response from targeting fraud against 
government support programs in 2021–22. 
In 2022-23 it applied focus on crimes affecting 
the community, addressing the evolving risk 
in technology and exploring networked and 
complex financial crime matters.
Over 2022–23 AUSTRAC received 8,433 SMRs 
relating to the Fintel Alliance work program—
a significant increase from 2021–22 (5,348). 
A matured focus on fraud from Fintel Alliance 
partners saw a reduction in the number 
of SMRs concerning the exploitation of 
government revenue. This quantitative drop 
was offset by an increase in the quality of 
reporting, with reports providing a greater 
picture of suspected offending.
This financial year, engaging with non-
traditional domestic and international partners 
was achieved through the following initiatives:
•	
introducing an environmental crime 
project examining the link between 
environmental crime and money 
laundering
•	
growing a virtual assets working group 
to enable greater sharing of insights, 
and better understand and respond 
to ML/TF and other serious crimes 
involving digital assets
•	
participating in an innovative, 
new, international public-private 
partnership known as Project Anton, 
aimed at improving awareness and 
understanding of the threat posed 
by the illegal wildlife trade.

/  AUSTRAC ANNUAL REPORT 2022-23
Addressing the challenges put forward by 
the Fintel Alliance Executive Board resulted in 
an increase in reporting on crimes affecting 
vulnerable members of the community, and 
networked and complex financial crime. These 
increases in SMRs fed directly into supporting 
national efforts to disrupt crime, including in 
the work of the Australian Centre to Counter 
Child Exploitation (ACCCE), protection of the 
National Disability Insurance Scheme (NDIS) 
and support of national and jurisdictional 
taskforces combating money laundering.
OPERATIONAL 
HIGHLIGHTS 
Strengthening efforts 
to protect the community
During 2022–23 significant strides were made 
in the advancement of projects designed 
to safeguard the community, aid in the 
apprehension of wanted fugitives and protect 
children from harm.
ABDUCTION OF A 5-YEAR-
OLD CHILD IN THE NORTHERN 
TERRITORY (NT)
In August 2022 Fintel Alliance was engaged 
after the abduction of a 5-year-old child in 
the NT, through the provision of real-time 
monitoring to law enforcement. Fintel Alliance 
identified operational opportunities, including 
identifying relevant purchases by a network 
of involved people. The ongoing assistance 
of Fintel Alliance led to a number of measures 
being used to apply pressure to the wider 
group, and the child safely being recovered 
by law enforcement.

Payment reference project
The payment reference project was established 
in November 2020 to target, detect and disrupt 
the use of text fields in financial payments 
as a method of criminal communication or 
domestic abuse. A focus of the project was 
payments sent to communicate or intimidate, 
rather than to transfer value or purchase goods 
and services.
As a result of the project, some financial 
services providers implemented new 
capabilities and internal controls to block and 
monitor activity in payment text fields, such 
as blocking abusive or offensive messages. 
Fintel Alliance intelligence sharing has been 
key to raising awareness of new online abuse 
avenues and protect vulnerable members of 
our community.


109  / 240
FINTEL ALLIANCE
This year, the project generated outcomes 
including:
•	
868 SMRs received by AUSTRAC relating 
to the use of the payment reference field
•	
145 AUSTRAC-generated intelligence 
reports for law enforcement partners
•	
5 persons of interest arrested and 
charged for criminal activity identified 
in payment text fields
•	
multiple law enforcement interventions 
to assist members of the public with 
mental health disorders, and welfare 
checks for victims whose safety was 
compromised. 
DOMESTIC VIOLENCE OFFENDER 
ARRESTED
AUSTRAC referred an incident to New South 
Wales (NSW) Police Force, who identified an 
individual as a high-risk domestic violence 
offender with outstanding arrest warrants. The 
messages contained in the payment reference 
field and identified by the financial institution 
were breaches of the perpetrator’s enforceable 
apprehended domestic violence order. Law 
enforcement leveraged Fintel Alliance to gain 
assistance from the financial institution in 
identifying the location of the individual, who 
in April 2023 was arrested and charged as a 
direct result of Fintel Alliance intervention. 
Protecting children from 
sexual exploitation
Child sexual exploitation is a form of child 
abuse where offenders and facilitators use their 
power, either physical, financial or emotional, 
over a child or young person to sexually or 
emotionally abuse them. The impact of child 
sexual exploitation is far reaching and the 
nature of offending requires a joint approach 
by government, industry and the wider 
international community to identify and stop 
this activity, and prosecute offenders.
In collaboration with the financial industry, 
AUSTRAC, the Australian Federal Police (AFP) 
and ACCCE identified over 800 Australia-based 
mules operating over 1,500 accounts across 
an array of Australian financial institutions 
that had been sending money from victims to 
offshore crime syndicates. This result was part 
of the AFP-led Operation Huntsman.


/  AUSTRAC ANNUAL REPORT 2022-23
LEVERAGING THE AUSTRAC-LED FINTEL ALLIANCE TO PROVIDE INSIGHTS, 
EDUCATION AND SUPPORT TO INDUSTRY AND MEMBERS OF THE PUBLIC
As part of Operation Huntsman, AUSTRAC and the ACCCE partnered to stop criminal networks, by 
targeting Australian money mules using their bank accounts to transfer the proceeds of child sexual 
extortion (‘sextortion’) scams from distressed victims to offshore criminal syndicates. 
Sextortion is a form of blackmail where someone threatens to share a nude, sexual image or video 
unless the victim surrenders to their demands, usually for financial gain. Teenagers have become 
primary targets of sextortion, which has led to an alarming rise in self-harm, usually within only 
a few hours of the victim being first contacted by an offender.
Financial institutions in Australia play a leading role in reducing the number of children becoming 
victims to sextortion scams. Targeted posters have been developed and are now displayed in customer-
facing areas of financial institutions. These are aimed at empowering frontline banking staff to identify 
and report sextortion victims and offenders to the ACCCE. Australian financial institutions have provided 
unprecedented support to manage the risk posed by hundreds of Australian money mules, operating 
thousands of bank accounts. Despite this, analysis conducted by AUSTRAC and the ACCCE shows 
sextortion continues. The posters will assist children and financial institutions in the critical first few hours 
of this crime. There is a QR code displayed on the posters that links to tailored resources that help victims 
understand they are not alone, and to assist in finding the support they need.

Apprehension of fugitives
Fintel Alliance partnered with the AFP to 
apprehend 7 of Australia’s most wanted 
fugitives, through the sharing and analysis of 
financial intelligence. Fugitives in Australia and 
overseas, who are the subject of arrest warrants 
for crimes including murder, manslaughter, child 
exploitation, drug trafficking, money laundering 
and serious fraud, have been arrested.
In July 2022 NSW Police Force, in conjunction 
with Fintel Alliance, undertook efforts to 
locate and arrest some of the state’s most 
wanted fugitives who presented a risk to the 
community. This was done using actionable 
intelligence during a dedicated ‘Week of 
Action’. The collective resources of partners 
were prioritised over 2 days to operationalise 
financial intelligence to locate, target and 
arrest offenders.
NSW POLICE FORCE QUOTE
‘Thank you for the 
opportunity to participate 
in the Week of Action. The 
entire concept of using 
financial intelligence that 
is available to police at 
short/live notice cannot 
be underestimated. The 
information that has been 
provided to police during 
the Week of Action has 
provided further investigative 
avenues. It has also raised the 
profile of several offenders 
and reiterated the need for 
them to be arrested. These 
include violent offenders 
as well as serious domestic 
violence offenders’.


/  AUSTRAC ANNUAL REPORT 2022-23
The following figures give insight into the value 
of the Week of Action and outcomes achieved 
by industry and government working together:
•	
13 high-risk community offenders 
were profiled

SUPPORTING THE AFP TO TRACK 
DOWN AN INTERNATIONAL 
FUGITIVE 
Leveraging Fintel Alliance in December 
2022, the AFP’s Fugitive Apprehension Strike 
Team (FAST) used Fintel Alliance’s capabilities 
to assist in locating a fugitive wanted on 
numerous historic child sex-related charges 
in the UK.
Financial intelligence provided by Fintel 
Alliance helped FAST establish the fugitive’s 
pattern of life and influenced the team’s 
operational decisions. 
With the support of Fintel Alliance, FAST 
located and arrested the fugitive, who was 
hiding in an area close to their home address. 
The fugitive is now subject to extradition to 
the UK.

Supporting the NDIS
The NDIS provides eligible Australians, who have a permanent or significant disability, with funding 
to assist them in their daily life. Administered by the National Disability Insurance Agency (NDIA), 
the scheme can be subject to abuse by criminals. As a preventative measure, Fintel Alliance, in 
collaboration with the NDIA, published a financial crime guide to help the financial services sector 
to identify, monitor and report suspected misuse against the NDIS.
During 2022–23, 355 SMRs identified suspected NDIS fraud and were referred to the NDIA for further 
investigation. Of these, 264 were accepted by NDIA for assessment, and 91 were linked to an existing 
fraud matter or investigation. From the 264 accepted referrals, 114 were assessed for further review 
and 10 were directed for compliance treatment. At the time of publication, the remaining 140 matters 
are progressing though NDIA’s triage phase or are subject to further analysis. 
These referrals led to an increase in the value of financial intelligence and preventing the misuse of 
funds intended to improve outcomes for those that need it most. SMR information has been used to 
investigate NDIS funds:
•	
fraudulently sent offshore
•	
laundered through the Australian financial system
•	
spent on gambling activity
•	
used to illegally purchase assets such as property and vehicles
•	
connected to criminal networks.
The NDIA requested financial information from AUSTRAC to support an investigation into suspected 
NDIS fraud. The information established a connection between the suspected offender and a newly-
established business, believed to have been created in response to previous NDIA intervention. This 
insight supported NDIA’s response and prevented further funds being paid to a fraudulent NDIS 
provider, and protected many vulnerable members of the community.

EXPANDING THE 
REACH OF FINTEL 
ALLIANCE
Fintel Alliance partners include major banks, 
remittance service providers and gambling 
operators, as well as law enforcement and 
security agencies from Australia and overseas. 
During 2022–23 Fintel Alliance worked with 
a wider range of partners on operations and 
projects to achieve greater outcomes for the 
Australian community. 
Environmental crime
Expanding on stopping  stopping illegal 
wildlife trafficking, Fintel Alliance commenced 
an environmental crime project in November 
2022 with the Department of Climate Change, 
Energy, the Environment and Water (DCCEEW) 
and Department of Agriculture, Fisheries and 
Forestry (DAFF).
ILLEGAL EXPORTATION 
OF TIMBER TO CHINA
In 2020 China imposed a ban on Australian 
timber. Fintel Alliance worked with DAFF 
to identify individuals and companies 
attempting to circumvent the ban by using 
transit countries in South-East Asia to move 
the timber to China. 
Through the sharing of information between 
agencies, Fintel Alliance was able to provide 
intelligence products that analysed SMRs and 
IFTIs to identify changes in methodology and 
behaviour prior to the ban and after the ban 
came into effect. This intelligence assisted 
DAFF and their partners in identifying timber in 
transiting containers likely destined for China. 
ILLEGAL EXPORTATION 
OF WASTE TYRES
In December 2020 Australia became one 
of the first countries to ban the export of 
unprocessed waste overseas. The ban included 
end-of-life bald tyres or tyres in pieces larger 
than 150mm. DCCEEW requested AUSTRAC 
information to explain trading relationships 
between businesses suspected of illegally 
exporting whole bald tyres. Financial analysis, 
with network analysis, of AUSTRAC holdings 
identified overseas companies purchasing end-
of-life tyres from Australia. The financial analysis 
also identified transportation and shipping 
companies used to ship the tyres overseas. 
Through the use of financial intelligence, 
Fintel Alliance was able to work with DCCEEW 
to disrupt the illegal exportation of waste 
and in turn, address the ongoing effects 
of environmental waste.

COMBATING THREATS 
TO NATIONAL 
SECURITY
The Fintel Alliance National Security Working 
Group is a trusted partnership between 
government, law enforcement and private 
industry that leverages financial intelligence, 
forensic accounting, criminal investigative 
skills, and national security knowledge. 
The working group focused on identifying 
terrorism financing risks and developing 
protocols to support the Joint Threat

analysis tools to identify national security 
and terrorism financing risks across all 
motivational spectrums.
UNITING 
INTERNATIONAL 
EFFORTS
Over the last 5 years, public-private partnerships 
have demonstrated the value of engaging law 
enforcement, government and key financial 
institutions in the fight against financial crime. 
Partnerships in Five Eyes countries have led 
the way in identifying opportunities to disrupt 
and deter crimes impacting the domestic and 
international community. 
PROJECT ANTON
Project Anton is an innovative, new, 
international public-private partnership aimed 
at improving awareness and understanding of 
the threat posed by the illegal wildlife trade, and 
targeting the laundering of proceeds from this 
crime both domestically and internationally. 
Project Anton is named after Anton Mzimba, 
Head of Security at the Timbavati Private 
Nature Reserve and a Global Conservation 
Technical Advisor, who was murdered for 
his brave commitment to protecting and 
conserving wildlife.
By following the money and generating 
actionable financial intelligence for law 
enforcement partners around the world, Project 
Anton is assisting in identifying, pursuing 
and prosecuting perpetrators—and broader 
networks—linked to illegal wildlife trade.
Project Anton is led by Scotiabank and 
supported by the Royal Foundation’s United 
for Wildlife network, FINTRAC (Canada’s FIU), 
AUSTRAC’s Fintel Alliance, the South African 
Anti-Money Laundering Integrated Task Force, 
UK FIU—National Crime Agency, Western Union, 
Environment and Climate Change Canada, 
Fisheries and Oceans Canada, Royal Canadian 
Mounted Police, Canada Border Services Agency, 
and Wildlife Justice Commission.
Fintel Alliance participated by engaging 
and contributing to FINTRAC’s operational 
alert on the illegal wildlife trade in Canada, 
and is continuing to support this project 
through sharing tactical and strategic-level 
financial intelligence.

PROJECT ANTON CONT.
Fintel Alliance continues to perform a 
leadership role in the project, providing 
insights and lessons learnt from our own 
award-winning illegal wildlife trafficking 
project, and identifying opportunities 
for a collective approach to progress the 
investigation of this crime type successfully. 


International engagement 
—round table update
Fintel Alliance seized the opportunity to 
establish a quarterly round table between Five 
Eyes FIUs. This financial year, the focus was:
•	
sharing learnings on disrupting terrorism 
financing and professional money 
laundering, fighting the illegal 
wildlife trade
•	
 combating child exploitation and 
human trafficking, and understanding 
how financial systems are misused to 
cause harm to vulnerable individuals. 
The quarterly round table resulted in sharing 
insights gained into current financial crime 
trends, increased understanding of new 
and emerging financial crime risks, and the 
strengthening of relationships regionally. The 
next year will see the round table continue 
to seek opportunities to collaborate across 
borders to fight criminal abuse of financial 
systems globally. 
International engagement 
—non-fungible tokens 
(NFTs) threat alert
As a result of the collaborative efforts of the 
virtual assets working group, Fintel Alliance 
released a threat alert on the financial 
crime risks of NFTs. The threat alert helps 
Fintel Alliance partners and digital currency 
exchange providers to understand NFTs, how 
criminals exploit their vulnerabilities and the 
associated risks, and financial crime indicators. 
In addition to Fintel Alliance partners and 
digital currency exchange providers, the threat 
alert was presented to the FATF Virtual Assets 
Contact Group and shared with international 
partners, including the Five Eyes Alliance, 
Eurasian Group on Combating Money 
Laundering and Financing of Terrorism, and 
the Asia/Pacific Group on Money Laundering.

EXPANDING THE USE 
OF JOINT AUSTRAC AND 
INDUSTRY CAPABILITIES
Fintel Alliance working groups provide 
partners with an opportunity to collaborate 
and share knowledge on trends, emerging 
issues and methodologies that are identified 
during the course of day-to-day operations. 
The information shared by the financial 
services, gambling and remittance sectors is 
critical in helping AUSTRAC and government

networks moving the proceeds of crime 
through Australian bank accounts.
Tax Crime and Evasion 
Working Group
The Fintel Alliance Tax Crime and Evasion 
Working Group has operated since July 
2020, and is jointly led by the Australia and 
New Zealand Banking Group Ltd, AUSTRAC, 
National Australia Bank and the Australian 
Taxation Office. The working group presents 
a forum for sharing information to identify, 
disrupt and prevent tax crime and evasion, 
with an additional focus on engaging with 
international partners. Over the past 12 
months, the key areas of focus have been 
tax refund fraud, virtual assets, professional 
enablers and property development. 
Operation of the working group has assisted in 
the development of industry and government 
knowledge and capacity to combat and 
disrupt tax crime, through the enhanced use 
and application of financial intelligence. In 
preparation for tax time 2023, a threat alert 
on tax refund fraud was shared with the 
financial sector to help with the identification 
of fraudulent claims. Financial intelligence 
has been embedded into investigations to 
identify and disrupt tax crime, and cultivated 
domestic and international partnerships 
to showcase best practices that enable a 
coordinated and collaborative response to 
combating tax crime and evasion. These 
efforts provide for a safer community for 
Australian financial services customers, 
and protection of government revenues.

Virtual Assets Working 
Group
The introduction of new and emerging 
financial services presents an opportunity for 
government agencies and the private sector 
to work in partnership to identify and mitigate 
risk. Recognising this opportunity, a Fintel 
Alliance Virtual Assets working group was 
established in 2022 to work with leading digital 
currency exchange providers. Following an 
initial 12-month proof-of-concept, the group 
expanded participation as other Fintel Alliance 
partners joined to share insights and learnings. 
The working group brings together experts 
from digital currency exchange providers, law 
enforcement and government agencies in the 
fight against ML/TF and other serious crime. 
In the first 18 months of operation, the Virtual 
Assets working group has delivered:
•	
capability and tradecraft uplift for 
partners, focused on understanding and 
responding to financial crime through 
virtual assets
•	
increases in the quantity and quality of 
reporting relating to suspicious activity 
involving virtual assets
•	
identification of new and emerging 
financial crime risks impacting digital 
currency exchange providers and the 
wider Australian community.
The working group involves two-way 
information sharing between industry and 
government, including new and emerging 
trends, methodologies and risks relating 
to financial crime. This year the focus of 
the working group was: disrupting ML/TF 
enabled by cryptocurrency; awareness and 
prevention of cryptocurrency-related scams; 
and combating child exploitation where virtual 
assets are part of the typology.
Casino Working Group 
Fintel Alliance presents an opportunity for 
Australian casinos, government and law 
enforcement agencies to work closely in the 
fight against financial crime impacting the 
community. Recognising this opportunity, 
the Fintel Alliance Casino Working Group was 
established in May 2023 to identify and respond 
to the money laundering risks within casinos.
The working group brings together financial 
crime leads from law enforcement, AUSTRAC 
and other government agencies, with 
representatives of all Australian casinos. 
Working groups are established as a forum 
for practitioners and investigators to share 
knowledge and learnings to target crime. 
Although early into its inception, AUSTRAC 
is eager to pursue this unique alliance and 
is confident the group will produce positive 
outcomes for the Australian public and 
gaming sector.

Child Sexual Exploitation 
Working Group
Child sexual exploitation is a heinous crime 
that extends across borders and adversely 
impacts victims and communities. Child sexual 
exploitation for financial gain involves a child 
being coerced or manipulated into engaging 
in forced sexual activity for financial benefit. 
It is crucial for law enforcement agencies, 
government agencies, financial institutions 
and not-for-profit organisations to work in 
partnership to disrupt payments for child 
sexual exploitation material, and stop the 
abuse of victims. In 2021 a working group was 
established to target, disrupt and deter this 
offending and consisted of trusted partners 
across government, industry, the Australian 
Institute of Criminology and the International 
Coalition for Missing and Exploited Children.
This partnership resulted in the development 
and release in 2022 of the Combating the 
sexual exploitation of children for financial 
gain financial crime guide.28 The guide assists 
government agencies and financial service 
providers, including remittance service 
providers and digital currency exchange 
providers, to understand and identify signs 
of the purchase of child sexual exploitation 
material, and when appropriate, to report 
suspicious financial activity. 
28	 austrac.gov.au/business/how-comply-guidance-and-resources/guidance-resources/combating-sexual-exploitation-
children-financial-gain
The financial crime guide provides a 
comprehensive picture of environmental and 
social factors, and financial indicators to help with 
the fight against child exploitation. It includes 
learnings and insights gained since the 2019 
release of the Combating the sexual exploitation 
of children for financial gain—Activity indicators 
report, and highlights the importance of working 
in partnership to combat child exploitation in 
Australia and overseas. 
Together the working group achieved:
•	
monthly collaboration forums, delivering 
presentations from domestic and 
international subject-matter experts
•	
participants’ expertise directly 
contributing to the development of 
financial indicators and drafting the 
content for the financial crime guide
•	
a 13.9% increase in child sexual 
exploitation suspicious matter reporting, 
compared to the same period last year
•

publication of infographic posters for 
Australian banking institutions to help 
fight the growing issue of sextortion.

Trade-based Money Laundering Working Group
International trade is an attractive avenue for criminals, as it presents risks and vulnerabilities that they 
can exploit. Criminals engaged in trade-based money laundering use the trade of goods and services 
to move illicit money into and out of Australia and around the world. Trade-based money laundering 
schemes vary in complexity and can be challenging to detect, as they can involve multiple parties 
and jurisdictions and misrepresent the prices, quantity or quality of imported or exported goods.
Fintel Alliance, in partnership with the Australian Border Force, developed a financial crime guide29 
released in October 2022 to assist government agencies and financial services providers to 
understand and identify trade-based money laundering. The guide was a culmination of the efforts 
and insights of the Trade-based Money Laundering Working Group that closed in June 2022.
•	
‘This guide on preventing trade-based money laundering is a timely contribution to countering 
the exploitation of the trade system as a means for financial crime. It will be beneficial in gaining 
an understanding of this activity for anyone in the trading community, and help government 
agencies in their efforts to identify, prevent and disrupt organised criminality through trade’. 
—Australian Border Force
•	
 ‘The guide definitely provides valuable insights on the TBML indicators and typologies, 
a comprehensive reference not only can be utilised for raising the awareness of frontline/
operations teams, also for the evaluation of the relevant controls to explore any enhancement 
opportunity’. —Feedback from a financial institution.

Dismantling criminal 
networks
Professional money laundering schemes 
vary in complexity and can be challenging to 
detect, as they can involve multiple parties and 
jurisdictions. Fintel Alliance partners recognise 
professional money laundering schemes as a 
serious risk and use the partnership to identify, 
target and disrupt this offending, to protect 
businesses, the community and the Australian 
economy. This involves working with law 
enforcement partners in money laundering 
or criminal asset confiscation investigations.
OPERATION AVARUS-MIDAS
In February 2023 the AFP’s Operation 
Avarus-Midas charged 9 members of an 
international money laundering organisation 
and restrained over $150 million in Australian 
real estate, as well as significant restraints of 
cryptocurrency, luxury watches, vehicles and 
jewellery. As part of the investigation, the AFP 
approached Fintel Alliance and worked with 
industry to increase the multilateral capability 
of financial intelligence using AUSTRAC’s 
expertise. The AFP identified criminal groups 
in Australia and offshore allegedly using 
a money laundering organisation to filter 
their proceeds of crime through legitimate 
financial and business structures, to hide their 
criminal activities from law enforcement. 
AUSTRAC will use these learnings as 
opportunity to explore money laundering risk 
indicators and improve detection processes.

PLANNING AND PERFORMANCE 
REPORTING
AUSTRAC’s corporate plan is the agency’s 
primary planning document and articulates 
our purpose, performance measures and 
risk management approaches in performing 
our function and enhancing our regulatory, 
intelligence and enabling capabilities.
Internally, the corporate plan is supplemented 
by branch business plans that outline the work 
and projects being delivered by branches, 
and risks being managed in support of 
branch performance. Branch plans provide 
AUSTRAC staff with a clear line of sight 
between their work and the broader agency 
strategic direction, operating environment, 
risks and performance measures outlined in 
the corporate plan. All of AUSTRAC’s branches 
had an endorsed plan in place throughout 
2022–23, with these plans considered living 
documents to evolve and be updated as 
internal and/or external factors shape the 
branch over the course of the year.
AUSTRAC’s internal reporting processes require 
branches to report against branch plans and 
corporate plan performance measures 3 times a 
year. This process ensures the GC and AUSTRAC’s 
accountable authority can monitor agency 
performance throughout the year and make 
resource and operational decisions accordingly.
RISK MANAGEMENT

AUSTRAC’s enterprise risk management 
framework is administered in line with the 
requirements of the Public Governance, 
Performance and Accountability Act 2013 
(PGPA Act) and the Commonwealth Risk 
Management Policy. The GC and ARC support 
the CEO’s oversight of risk management and the 
application of the framework across the agency.
During 2022–23 AUSTRAC further enhanced 
our framework to align with changes to the 
Commonwealth Risk Management Policy, 
ensuring it remains appropriate for our 
operating environment and embeds a positive 
risk management culture within the agency. 
Our approach to risk management includes 
identifying areas of emerging and strategic 
risk which, if realised, could affect our ability 
to achieve our purpose and objectives.
Deputy CEOs are accountable to the CEO for 
management of risk in the agency. Our risk 
management policy and risk management 
framework empower Deputy CEOs and 
the broader executive cohort to use their 
professional judgement and experience to 
make risk informed decisions. It also enables 
them to provide direction for applying risk 
management approaches across their divisions 
and branches, in line with the agency’s risk 
appetite and tolerance, and our governance 
and accountability arrangements. All staff in the 
agency actively contribute to risk management 
by identifying, assessing, controlling, 
communicating, monitoring and reporting risks 
in accordance with AUSTRAC’s risk management 
policy and risk management framework.


129  / 240
INTERNAL AUDIT

AUSTRAC’s internal audit function provides 
objective, independent assurance to the CEO 
regarding the efficiency and effectiveness 
of the agency’s financial and operational 
controls. It is designed to add value and 
improve AUSTRAC’s operational capability. 
The annual internal audit work plan takes into 
consideration agency-wide and organisational 
business unit risks, previous and proposed 
Australian National Audit Office (ANAO) 
coverage, previous internal audit coverage and 
environmental changes (actual or anticipated). 
The program is approved by the AUSTRAC CEO 
and is delivered using an external audit service 
provider. It seeks to ensure a systematic and 
disciplined approach is used to evaluate and 
improve the effectiveness of risk management, 
control and governance processes in response 
to operating environment changes and 
business risks. The ARC provides independent, 
objective assessments of the audits 
undertaken and actions taken by AUSTRAC 
in response to audit recommendations.
FRAUD CONTROL AND INTEGRITY

AUSTRAC is committed to meeting the high 
standard of ethics expected in performing our 
functions as Australia’s anti-money laundering 
and counter-terrorism financing regulator and 
specialist financial intelligence unit. We are 
dedicated to the continued improvement of 
our integrity framework to support an honest, 
professional and fair workforce that embodies 
the Australian Public Service (APS) Values and 
Code of Conduct.
AUSTRAC has continued to adopt 
improvements to mature our fraud and 
corruption detection and resilience. We 
are currently reviewing and enhancing our 
insider threat frameworks and policies. We 
also participate in regular Commonwealth 
Senior Officer Fraud Forum meetings and 
are involved in communities of practice 
which have helped share knowledge and 
grow relationships across the APS between 
integrity and fraud prevention officers.
AUSTRAC’s fraud prevention, detection, 
investigation, reporting and data collection 
procedures and processes align with the 
requirements of the Commonwealth Fraud 
Control Framework 2017.
In addition, our fraud and corruption control 
framework complies with the requirements 
of section 10 of the Public Governance, 
Performance and Accountability Rule 2014 
and the Commonwealth Fraud Control Policy.
MANAGEMENT AND ACCOUNTABILITY


/  AUSTRAC ANNUAL REPORT 2022-23
A fraud and corruption risk assessment 
was completed in 2023 to test ongoing 
effectiveness and suitability of AUSTRAC 
fraud and corruption control measures. This 
risk assessment found that the controls and 
mechanisms AUSTRAC has in place to manage 
fraud risks and corruption are adequate. 

SIGNIFICANT NON-COMPLIANCE 
ISSUES WITH FINANCE LAW
During 2022–23 AUSTRAC did not identify any 
significant issues relating to non-compliance 
with the finance law. In determining the 
significance of any issues, AUSTRAC took into 
account the guidance as outlined in Resource 
Management Guide 124—Notification of 
significant non-compliance with the finance 
law. As such, the accountable authority did 
not report to the responsible Minister any 
serious non-compliance as required by 
paragraph 19(1)(e) of the PGPA Act.

COMMONWEALTH CHILD SAFE 
FRAMEWORK
AUSTRAC is committed to upholding a culture 
that promotes and ensures the safety and 
wellbeing of children and young people. In 
supporting child safety, AUSTRAC complies with 
the Commonwealth Child Safe Framework31 
and upholds children’s rights. Our intelligence 
is invaluable to achieving law enforcement 
outcomes, including counter-child exploitation 
and counter-child abuse efforts.
AUSTRAC has a suite of sophisticated financial 
profiles and enhanced data capabilities 
to detect entities of interest, patterns of 
behaviour and transactions that may be 
indicative of these serious crimes. AUSTRAC 
continues to identify, and with partners:
•	
disrupt payments linked to child 
exploitation
•	
prevent and disrupt livestreamed 
child sexual abuse
•	
intercept material and offenders 
at the border
•	
identify possible offending within 
the community. 


131  / 240
Our Fintel Alliance works collaboratively with 
law enforcement and industry partners to 
proactively identify transactions that relate 
to child sexual exploitation. In December 
2022 we released a financial crime guide on 
combating sexual exploitation of children for 
financial gain. During 2022–23 AUSTRAC was 
involved in Operation Huntsman, an AUSTRAC 
and Australian Federal Police/Australian 
Centre to Counter Child Exploitation-
led operation targeting the sextortion of 
minors for financial gain. Refer to the Fintel 
Alliance section (page 103) of this report for 
more information on AUSTRAC’s efforts on 
protecting children from sexual exploitation.
In undertaking the agency’s work, AUSTRAC 
officers do not have any direct interaction 
with children; therefore, the overall risk is 
assessed as low.
AUSTRAC continues to conduct suitability 
assessments and at a minimum, Baseline 
security clearances, for all prospective staff. 
This includes criminal history checks through 
the National Police Checking Service. The 
aim of these checks is to prevent personnel 
assessed as unsuitable, due to security risks, 
being engaged by the agency. A security risk 
includes any identified actual or potential risk 
to children.
EXTERNAL SCRUTINY
MINISTERIAL AND 
PARLIAMENTARY OVERSIGHT
Throughout 2022–23 AUSTRAC was under the 
ministerial oversight of the Attorney-General. 
AUSTRAC’s transparency and accountability to 
Parliament includes responding to questions 
on notice and publishing information required 
by Senate orders. AUSTRAC appears before 
Parliamentary committees (including Senate 
Estimates) and provides submissions to 
Parliamentary inquiries as appropriate.
During 2022–23 AUSTRAC witnesses 
appeared before the Senate Legal and 
Constitutional Affairs Legislation Committee 
at Budget Estimates and Supplementary 
Estimates hearings.
There were no judicial decisions, decisions 
of administrative tribunals, or decisions by the 
Australian Information Commissioner that had 
a significant impact on AUSTRAC’s operations.
There were no reports on AUSTRAC’s 
operations given by the Auditor-General, 
a Parliamentary Committee, or the 
Commonwealth Ombudsman. There 
were no capability reviews of the agency.

AUSTRALIAN PUBLIC SERVICE 
(APS) NET ZERO 2030 EMISSIONS 
REPORTING
APS Net Zero 2030 is the Government’s 
policy for the APS to reduce its greenhouse 
gas emissions to net zero by 2030, and 
transparently report on its emissions. As 
part of this, non-corporate and corporate 
Commonwealth entities are required to report 
on their operational greenhouse gas emissions.
The Greenhouse Gas Emissions Inventory 
presents greenhouse gas emissions over 
the 2022–23 period. Results are presented 
on the basis of Carbon Dioxide Equivalent 
(CO2-e) emissions. Greenhouse gas 
emissions reporting has been developed 
with methodology that is consistent with the 
Whole-of-Australian Government approach as 
part of the APS Net Zero 2030 policy. Not all 
data sources were available at the time of the 
report and adjustments to baseline data may 
be required in future reports.

MANAGEMENT OF HUMAN RESOURCES
OUR PEOPLE 

In 2022–23 AUSTRAC continued to strategically 
build a workforce capable of achieving our 
plans and needs for the future. We embedded 
our hybrid work model to provide a resilient and 
flexible framework that includes both office-
based and home-based work. We continue 
to mature this model, closely aligning it to 
workplace safety requirements and providing 
guidance and strategies to ensure we make 
hybrid working sustainable, with positive 
outcomes for our people and the agency.
Our people strategy encapsulates our goals 
and aspirations across a set of people initiative 
areas. This provides a clear direction for 
future planning and decision making across 
the agency. We also implemented the new 
AUSTRAC leadership strategy, which provides 
a clear and consistent approach to leadership 
development in the agency, and identifies the 
pivotal qualities and behaviours required for 
effective leadership.
In addition, the AUSTRAC strategic workforce 
plan presents a 4-year vision for the agency’s 
workforce. The plan identifies key themes that 
are essential to future-proof our workforce, 
enhance our capabilities and strengthen our 
position as a forward-leaning, high-performing 
agency. We continued building capability and 
delivering outcomes from our operational 
workforce planning activities. These provide 
our leaders with workforce data insights and 
support evidence-based decision making.
OUR CULTURE

The agency’s culture is underpinned by our 
philosophy ‘One AUSTRAC’, which reinforces 
the belief that our employees are stronger 
together than as individuals. Our core values 
reflect our strengths, and our diverse range 
of backgrounds and broad mix of skills 
and experiences shape our unique and 
empowering workplace culture. This is 
reflected in our Australian Public Service 
(APS) Census results, which present high-
index results in wellbeing, innovation and 
engagement, with satisfaction and culture 
measures particularly impressive.
In 2022–23 we engaged with staff through 
focus groups, surveys and executive leadership 
forums to seek feedback on how our culture 
fits with our business and how we work 
together. Drawing on the findings of this 
work, we have reviewed and updated our 
One AUSTRAC culture statement to reflect 
the values and behaviours that we expect of 
each other, which will foster a positive and 
productive work environment. The culture 
statement centres around 4 pillars: that we are 
trusted, inclusive, collaborative and impactful.


/  AUSTRAC ANNUAL REPORT 2022-23
We have continued to invest in initiatives that 
help cultivate our culture and provide growth 
opportunities for our employees. Our mentor 
program continues to grow, providing a 
unique opportunity for mentors and mentees 
to develop their professional capabilities and 
gain insight across the agency. Our Diversity 
and Inclusion Program fosters a culture 
of inclusion and supports us in building a 
healthy organisation. Our staff-led AUSTRAC 
Pride Network, and Diversity and Inclusion 
Leadership Group, empower individuals to 
initiate change and work together to achieve 
our diversity and inclusion goals.
Diversity and inclusion
AUSTRAC’s Diversity and Inclusion Program 
2019–23 aims to position AUSTRAC as an 
employer of choice by attracting, supporting, 
advancing and celebrating employees across 
all diversity dimensions. It includes individual 
action plans for disability and access, Indigenous 
employment, gender equality, LGBTQIA+, 
culturally and linguistically diverse, and mature 
age employees.
The program is driven by the AUSTRAC 
Diversity and Inclusion Leadership Group, 
which is chaired by a Diversity Champion at 
the Senior Executive Service (SES) level. The 
group is supported by the agency’s human 
resources team and oversees the AUSTRAC 
Pride network.
The promotion and commitment to an 
inclusive and barrier-free workplace remained 
at the cornerstone of our program activities 
during 2022–23.
Activities undertaken during 2022–23 
included:
•	
building and maintaining relationships 
and networks with member 
organisations (Pride in Diversity, 
Australian Network on Disability and 
Diversity Council Australia) and partner 
agencies (primarily the National 
Intelligence Community and other 
Commonwealth regulatory agencies), 
to provide AUSTRAC employees with 
expanded resources, support and 
networking opportunities
•	
participating in 2 rounds of the Jawun 
Indigenous Secondment Program
•	
driving a supportive and enabling 
workplace culture by promoting 
AUSTRAC as a flexible employer in all

Public Service Act 1999 (Public Service Act), 
which provides an annual adjustment to 
salary and remuneration-based allowances.
In accordance with the APS-wide Public Sector 
Interim Workplace Relations Arrangements 
2022 released in October 2022, a 3% pay 
increase was paid to all non-SES employees 
on 29 March 2023, via a determination made 
under subsection 24(1) of the Public Service 
Act by the AUSTRAC CEO following agreement 
of the APS Commissioner.

/  AUSTRAC ANNUAL REPORT 2022-23
EXECUTIVE REMUNERATION
The terms and conditions of employment 
for AUSTRAC’s SES are established under 
subsection 24(1) of the Public Service Act, 
and outlined in the respective employee’s 
determination. The majority of employment 
conditions are similar to those set out in 
the AUSTRAC EA and comply with the APS 
Executive Remuneration Policy. The AUSTRAC 
SES remuneration policy ensures a consistent 
approach in determining SES remuneration.
As at 30 June 2023 there were 12 SES employee 
determinations in operation. Two further SES 
employees are substantive EL2s. The pay rate 
for the SES acting role is determined by the 
internal SES remuneration policy. SES base salary 
increases are generally in line with those that 
apply to non-SES employees. Accordingly, 
SES employees received a 3% pay increase 
on 21 October 2022.
No incentive payments were made to 
AUSTRAC SES employees during 2022–23.
EMPLOYMENT CONDITIONS
The terms and conditions of employment 
for AUSTRAC’s non-SES employees are 
governed by the AUSTRAC EA, but can be 
varied through a written individual flexibility 
arrangement (IFA).
The AUSTRAC IFA policy outlines the 
underlying principles whereby an IFA may 
be established, and sets out the approval 
process and governance of IFAs. AUSTRAC’s 
Governance Committee reviews IFAs 
annually to ensure they continue to support 
AUSTRAC’s operational requirements.
At 30 June 2023 there were 23 IFAs in effect. 
The majority of these related to remuneration 
arrangements.
No AUSTRAC employees were covered 
by common law contracts in 2022–23. 
Performance pay was also not applicable.
Learning and development
AUSTRAC supports our employees’ 
professional development and enhances 
our standing as an employer of choice, 
through comprehensive learning and 
development opportunities. To drive the 
strategic alignment of staff capability and 
organisational goals, AUSTRAC’s Learning 
and Development Framework 2021–23 
identifies essential capability requirements.

COMMON LEARNING REQUIREMENTS TO ENABLE OUR PEOPLE 
TO RESPOND TO FUTURE CHALLENGES
To enable AUSTRAC to respond to the challenges of the future, while continuing to achieve 
our purpose, the AUSTRAC Learning and Development Framework prioritises 6 ‘common’ areas of 
focus to guide the development of tailored, fit-for-purpose learning offerings across the agency.
Table 27: Priorities for common learning







What are our priorities for common learning? 
Focus
Why
Project and change 
management
Supporting our people through change and our managers 
to lead through change
Communication and writing 
skills
Building capability to communicate recommendations 
supported by a clear rationale
Stakeholder engagement and 
relationship management
Strengthening our relationships with partner agencies and 
regulated entities
Critical thinking and problem 
solving skills
Increasing critical thinking capability to make decisions and 
best respond to complex and often ambiguous information
Data literacy
Better understanding of complex data and communicating 
outcomes in a clear and convincing manner
Leadership and management 
development
Building managers skills to lead teams, while supporting 
their teams to learn and apply new skills

Over the last 3 years, we have sourced and delivered custom training opportunities to our staff in 
the areas of stakeholder engagement, writing skills, critical thinking and leadership development. 
Additional training in project and change management—particularly crucial given potential 
legislative reforms—will be delivered over the remainder of the 2023 calendar year.
Data literacy remains an outstanding critical skill. AUSTRAC is currently developing a framework 
of data principles and will prioritise data literacy training following its finalisation. 
We are currently reviewing critical skills needs and gaps across the agency, which will inform the 
AUSTRAC Learning and Development Framework 2024–26.

/  AUSTRAC ANNUAL REPORT 2022-23
Although the lifting of many COVID-19 
control measures allowed for the return of 
face-to-face learning, e-learning or blended 
learning solutions (such as webinars) 
continue to be a cost-effective method of 
delivering training to the largest cohort of 
staff possible. In addition, the availability of 
different learning mediums has helped ensure 
accessibility and flexibility for all, regardless 
of location or personal circumstances, such 
as working-from-home arrangements.
AUSTRAC supports staff professional 
development and capability uplift, through 
a substantial program of studies assistance 
and external training opportunities. These 
programs allow staff to work towards and 
attain Australian Qualifications Framework 
(AQF) recognised qualifications, or gain 
professional recognition or accreditation 
through external training providers in vital 
professional areas. Common areas include 
anti-money laundering and counter-terrorism 
financing certifications and other skill sets 
in demand at AUSTRAC, such as intelligence 
analysis and compliance. Throughout 2022–
23, AUSTRAC staff attended approximately 
185 external professional development 
offerings and 953 internally facilitated 
sessions. An additional 48 staff participated 
in AUSTRAC’s Studies Assistance program to 
commence, progress and/or complete an 
AQF recognised qualification.
Leadership and management capability 
enhancement is a crucial focus within 
AUSTRAC. Our Leadership Strategy 2022–25 
sets out the leadership qualities, capabilities 
and behaviours necessary for the agency 
to meet our critical leadership workforce 
needs, and articulates our expectations 
for our leaders. The strategy also promotes 
development opportunities, tools and 
resources to support leaders in the agency. 
The foundational Emerging Leaders program 
was introduced in 2023 and provided 
leadership development support for 73 
EL1 and high-performing APS6 staff.
We provide staff with opportunities for on-
the-job training through our annual in-house 
AUSTRAC Mentor Program. The latest intake 
saw a three-fold increase in applications, 
with the commencement of 23 partnerships, 
reflecting increased interest in this avenue 
of professional development. AUSTRAC 
also participates in the Women in Law 
Enforcement Strategy Mentoring program, 
with 2 EL2 staff mentees and 2 SES-level 
mentors participating in 2023.
Staff at AUSTRAC also have access to an array 
of professional development opportunities 
to enhance their effectiveness, retention and 
career pathways.

Work health and safety
AUSTRAC is committed to fostering a positive 
safety and wellbeing culture, and ensuring 
the health and safety of our employees, 
contractors, visitors, and anyone who may 
be affected by our operations. We ensure we 
comply with the Work Health and Safety Act 
2011 (WHS Act) and the Safety, Rehabilitation 
and Compensation Act 1988, through:
•	
prevention—providing and maintaining 
a healthy and safe working environment, 
and preventing work-related injury 
or illness, by adopting a proactive risk 
management approach to WHS as an 
integral part of overall business operations
•	
injury management—reducing the 
personal, organisational and financial 
costs of both compensable and non-
compensable injuries and illnesses, 
through active early intervention and 
return-to-work programs
•	
wellbeing initiatives—providing 
programs to enhance the physical and 
mental wellbeing of our employees, 
improve engagement and promote 
a culture of proactive wellness.
There were no notifiable WHS incidents 
reported to Comcare in 2022–23.
In 2022–23 AUSTRAC did not have any:
•	
WHS investigations by Comcare
•	
improvement notices issued by Health 
and Safety Representatives (section 90 
of the WHS Act)
•	
improvement notices issued by Comcare 
(section 191 of the WHS Act)
•	
non-disturbance notices issued by 
Comcare (section 198 of the WHS Act).
AUSTRAC’s Comcare premium rate for 
2022–23 was 0.13%, well below the overall 
scheme rate of 0.84%.
Disability reporting 
mechanism
Australia’s Disability Strategy 2021-2031 (the 
Strategy) is the overarching framework for 
inclusive policies, programs and infrastructure 
that will support people with disability to 
participate in all areas of Australian life. The 
Strategy sets out where practical changes 
will be made to improve the lives of people 
with disability in Australia. It acts to ensure the 
principles underpinning the United Nations 
Convention on the Rights of Persons with 
Disabilities are incorporated into Australia’s 
policies and programs that affect people with 
disability, their families and carers.
All levels of government have committed 
to deliver more comprehensive and visible 
reporting under the Strategy. A range of 
reports on progress of the Strategy’s actions 
and outcome areas will be published and 
available at www.disabilitygateway.gov.au/
ads. Disability reporting is included the APS 
Commission’s State of the Service reports and 
the APS Statistical Bulletin. These reports are 
available at www.apsc.gov.au.

the role within the reporting period. CEO remuneration is set by the Remuneration Tribunal—see Remuneration Tribunal 
(Remuneration and Allowances for Holders of Full-time Public Office) Determination 2021. Any discrepancy between the 
value in ‘Total remuneration’ or ‘Total’ and the sum of all benefits is due to rounding.

REPORT ON FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE
2022–23 Financial 
Performance 
A copy of AUSTRAC’s audited financial 
statements and the Auditor-General’s report 
are included on page 178.
Our financial statements have been prepared 
on an accrual basis in accordance with the 
Financial Reporting Rule and Australian 
Accounting Standards. As in previous years, 
the Statement of Comprehensive Income 
relates to items of revenue and expenses 
where we are directly responsible for their 
administration and management.
In 2022–23 we produced a net operating 
loss of $18.184 million, compared with a 
net operating loss of $10.623 million in 
2021–22. The net operating loss includes 
$17.344 million of depreciation and 
amortisation expenses.
Total revenue for 2022–23 was $95.626 
million: a $3.265 million increase over 
the previous year.
Our financial position as at 30 June 2023 is 
shown in the Statement of Financial Position. 
This takes into account movements in assets, 
liabilities and equity. Total equity has increased 
to $76.267 million (2021–22: $71.182 million). 
Events occurring after 
balance date
Following the commencement of civil penalty 
proceedings against Crown Melbourne and 
Crown Perth (Crown) in March 2022, the 
Federal Court of Australia imposed a $450 
million civil penalty over Crown’s breaches 
of the Anti-Money Laundering and Counter-
Terrorism Financing Act 2006 on 11 July 2023.  
The court agreed that the penalty will be 
paid over 2 years and also ordered Crown 
to pay AUSTRAC’s costs of $3.356 million. 
In accordance with Resource Management 
Guide 125—Commonwealth Entities Financial 
Statements Guide, the reimbursement of legal 
costs will first be applied against year-to-date 
legal expenses in 2023–24 that directly related 
to the Crown matter with the balance being 
recognised as other income (revenue).

INDEPENDENT AUDITOR’S REPORT 
To the Attorney-General of Australia

(a) comply  with  Australian  Accounting  Standards  –  Simplified  Disclosures  and  the  Public  Governance, 
Performance and Accountability (Financial Reporting) Rule 2015; and 
(b) present fairly the financial position of the Entity as at 30 June 2023 and its financial performance and cash 
flows for the year then ended. 
The financial statements of the Entity, which I have audited, comprise the following as at 30 June 2023 and for 
the year then ended:  
 
Statement by the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer;  
 
Statement of Comprehensive Income;  
 
Statement of Financial Position;  
 
Statement of Changes in Equity;  
 
Cash Flow Statement;  
 
Administered Schedule of Comprehensive Income;  
 
Administered Schedule of Assets and Liabilities;  
 
Administered Reconciliation Schedule;  
 
Administered Cash Flow Statement; and  
 
Notes  to  the  financial  statements,  comprising  a  summary  of  significant  accounting  policies  and  other 
explanatory information. 
 
Basis for opinion 
I  conducted  my  audit  in  accordance  with  the  Australian  National  Audit  Office  Auditing  Standards,  which 
incorporate the Australian Auditing Standards. My responsibilities under those standards are further described 
in the Auditor’s Responsibilities for the Audit of the Financial Statements section of my report. I am independent 
of the Entity in accordance with the relevant ethical requirements for financial statement audits conducted by 
the  Auditor‐General  and  his  delegates.  These  include  the  relevant  independence  requirements  of  the 
Accounting Professional and Ethical Standards Board’s APES 110 Code of Ethics for Professional Accountants 
(including Independence Standards) (the Code) to the extent that they are not in conflict with the Auditor‐
General Act 1997. I have also fulfilled my other responsibilities in accordance with the Code. I believe that the 
audit evidence I have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for my opinion. 
 
Accountable Authority’s responsibility for the financial statements 
As  the  Accountable  Authority  of  the  Entity,  the  Chief  Executive  Officer  is  responsible  under  the  Public 
Governance, Performance and Accountability Act 2013 (the Act) for the preparation and fair presentation of 
annual financial statements that comply with Australian Accounting Standards – Simplified Disclosures and the 
rules made under the Act. The Chief Executive Officer is also responsible for such internal control as the Chief 
Executive Officer determines is necessary to enable the preparation of financial statements that are free from 
material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error.  


/  AUSTRAC ANNUAL REPORT 2022-23
 
 
In preparing the financial statements, the Chief Executive Officer is responsible for assessing the ability of the 
Entity to continue as a going concern, taking into account whether the Entity’s operations will cease as a result 
of an administrative restructure or for any other reason. The Chief Executive Officer is also responsible for 
disclosing, as applicable, matters related to going concern and using the going concern basis of accounting, 
unless the assessment indicates that it is not appropriate. 
 
Auditor’s responsibilities for the audit of the financial statements  
My objective is to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements as a whole are free from 
material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error, and to issue an auditor’s report that includes my opinion. 
Reasonable assurance is a high level of assurance, but is not a guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance 
with the Australian National Audit Office Auditing Standards will always detect a material misstatement when it 
exists.  Misstatements  can  arise  from  fraud  or  error  and  are  considered  material  if,  individually  or  in  the 
aggregate, they could reasonably be expected to influence the economic decisions of users taken on the basis 
of the financial statements. 
As  part  of  an  audit  in  accordance  with  the  Australian  National Audit  Office  Auditing  Standards,  I  exercise 
professional judgement and maintain professional scepticism throughout the audit. I also:  
 identify and assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to fraud or 
error, design and perform audit procedures responsive to those risks, and obtain audit evidence that is 
sufficient  and  appropriate  to  provide  a  basis  for  my  opinion.  The  risk  of  not  detecting  a  material 
misstatement resulting from fraud is higher than for one resulting from error, as fraud may involve collusion, 
forgery, intentional omissions, misrepresentations, or the override of internal control;  
 obtain an understanding of internal control relevant to the audit in order to design audit procedures that are 
appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of 
the Entity’s internal control; 
 evaluate the appropriateness of accounting policies used and the reasonableness of accounting estimates 
and related disclosures made by the Accountable Authority;  
 conclude on the appropriateness of the Accountable Authority’s use of the going concern basis of accounting 
and,  based  on  the  audit  evidence  obtained,  whether  a  material  uncertainty  exists  related  to  events  or 
conditions that may cast significant doubt on the Entity’s ability to continue as a going concern. If I conclude 
that a material uncertainty exists, I am required to draw attention in my auditor’s report to the related 
disclosures in the financial statements or, if such disclosures are inadequate, to modify my opinion. My 
conclusions are based on the audit evidence obtained up to the date of my auditor’s report. However, future 
events or conditions may cause the Entity to cease to continue as a going concern; and  
 evaluate  the  overall  presentation,  structure  and  content  of  the  financial  statements,  including  the 
disclosures, and whether the financial statements represent the underlying transactions and events in a 
manner that achieves fair presentation.  
I communicate with the Accountable Authority regarding, among other matters, the planned scope and timing 
of the audit and significant audit findings, including any significant deficiencies in internal control that I identify 
during my audit.

Budget Variances Commentary
Statement of Comprehensive Income
The variance in Employee benefits is primarily driven by a 3% payrise and annual movement through the increment levels. This payrise has led to an 
increase in both salaries and employee liabilities.  
The variance in Suppliers is predominantly due to an increase in legal fees from new enforcement actions and lower than expected capitalisation in 
projects due to various projects delayed movement through delivery stages. These delays have resulted in projects remaining in their Research phase 
longer than anticipated. 
The variance in Depreciation and amortisation is similarly due to the reduced capitalisation of projects.
Revenue from contracts with customers is higher than budget due to agreed changes to the timing of specific activities covered by Memorandum of 
Understanding arrangements with other Federal Government Agencies.

STATEMENT OF FINANCIAL POSITION
as at 30 June 2023
1. Right-of-use assets are included in Buildings.
Budget Variances Commentary
Statement of Financial Position  
The variance in Trade and other receivables mainly relates to reduced retained appropriations receivable at year-end (unspent). 
The variances in both Intangibles and Property plant and equipment are due to a lower than budgeted capitalisation of costs as identified in 
the Statement of Comprehensive Income.    
The variance in Prepayments relates to a specific contract for software and related prepaid maintenance. 
Employee provisions have increased primarily as a result of changes in the parameters used for calculating the provision as well as a 3% 
payrise.

CASH FLOW STATEMENT 
for the period ended 30 June 2023
Budget Variances Commentary
Cash Flow Statement
Suppliers increased as a result of an increase in legal fees from new enforcement actions and lower than expected capitialisation in 
projects due to various project's delayed movement through delivery stages. 
The variance in Employees is primarily driven by 3% pay increase and associated leave as identified in the Statement of Comprehensive 
Income.
The Budget for Property plant and equipment includes budget for Intangibles. The combined variance in the Cash used for investing 
activities is due to under capitalisation of projects due to delays in stages of capitalisation as identified in the Statement of Comprehensive 
Income.

Taxation revenue – Other taxes.
Budget Variances Commentary
Schedule of Administered Comprehensive Income
The variance from budget for Waivers is a result of invoiced levies being waived as part of the normal levy process for disputes finalised up 
to 30 June 2023. The Impairment loss on financial instruments relates to levies collected reversing prior year unpaid that were deemed 
unrecoverable.
The variance from budget in Industry contribution levies is a result to changes in reported declared earnings or group structures for some 
reporting entities. The changes required a review and as a result there was a revision to the levies charged in prior periods. This resulted 
in a net increase in collected levies in 2022-23.

Administered Cash Transfers to and from the Official Public Account
Administered revenue collected by AUSTRAC is for use by the Government. 
Collections are transferred to the Official Public Account (OPA) maintained by the Department of Finance. Conversely, cash is drawn from 
the OPA to make payments under Parliamentary appropriation on behalf of Government. 
These transfers to and from the OPA are adjustments to the administered cash held by AUSTRAC on behalf of the Government and are 
reported as such in the schedule of administered cash flows.

REPORT ON FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE
OVERVIEW 
Objectives of AUSTRAC 
The Australian Transaction Reports and Analysis Centre (AUSTRAC) is a non-corporate Commonwealth 
entity, controlled by the Australian Government. 
AUSTRAC is Australia's financial intelligence unit and anti-money laundering and counter-terrorism 
financing (AML/CTF) regulator. AUSTRAC’s purpose is to build resilience in the financial system and use 
financial intelligence and regulation to disrupt money laundering, terrorism financing and other serious 
crime. 
AUSTRAC is structured to the following outcome: The protection of the financial system from criminal 
abuse through actionable intelligence, risk-based regulation, and collaboration with domestic and 
international partners.   
AUSTRAC activities contributing toward this outcome are classified as either departmental or 
administered. Departmental activities involve the use of assets, liabilities, income and expenses 
controlled or incurred by AUSTRAC in its own right. Administered activities involve the management or 
oversight by AUSTRAC, on behalf of the Government, of items controlled or incurred by the Government. 
Basis of Preparation of the Financial Statements 
The financial statements are required by section 42 of the Public Governance, Performance and 
Accountability Act 2013 (PGPA Act). 
The financial statements have been prepared in accordance with: 
a) Public Governance, Performance and Accountability (Financial Reporting) Rule 2015 (FRR); and 
b) Australian Accounting Standards and Interpretations – including simplified disclosures for Tier 2 
Entities under AASB 1060 issued by the Australian Accounting Standards Board (AASB) that apply 
for the reporting period. 
The financial statements have been prepared on an accrual basis and in accordance with the historical 
cost convention, except for certain assets and liabilities at fair value. Except where stated, no allowance 
is made for the effect of changing prices on the results or the financial position. The financial statements 
are presented in Australian dollars and values are rounded to the nearest thousand dollars unless 
otherwise specified. 
New Accounting Standards  
Adoption of New Australian Accounting Standard Requirements  
  
Two amending standards (AASB 2021-2 and AASB 2021-6) were adopted earlier than the application 
date as stated in the standard.  This amending standards have been adopted for the 2022-23 reporting 
period.  
 
The following amending standards were issued prior to the signing of the statement by the Accountable 
Authority and Chief Financial Officer, were applicable to the current reporting period and did not have a 
material effect on the entity’s financial statements:

Standard/ Interpretation 
Nature of change in accounting policy, transitional 
provisions, and adjustment to financial statements 
 
 
AASB 2021-2 Amendments to 
Australian Accounting Standards – 
Disclosure of Accounting Policies and 
Definition of Accounting Estimates 
(AASB 2021-2) 
AASB 2021-2 amends AASB 7, AASB 101,  AASB 108, 
AASB 134 and AASB Practice Statement 2. The amending 
standard requires the disclosure of material, rather than 
significant, accounting policies, and clarifies what is 
considered a change in accounting policy compared to a 
change in accounting estimate. 
 
 
AASB 2021-6 Amendments to 
Australian Accounting Standards - 
Disclosure of Accounting Policies: Tier 
2 and Other Australian Accounting 
Standards (AASB 2021-6) 
AASB 2021-6 amends the Tier 2 reporting requirements set 
out in AASB 1049, AASB 1054 and AASB 1060 to reflect 
the changes made by AASB 2021-2. 
 
 
The details of the changes in accounting policies and adjustments are disclosed below and in the 
relevant notes to the financial statements.  This amending standard is not expected to have a material 
impact on the entity's financial statements for the current reporting period or future reporting periods. 
Taxation 
AUSTRAC is exempt from all forms of taxation except Fringe Benefits Tax (FBT) and Goods and 
Services Tax (GST). 
Events after the reporting period  
Following the commencement of civil penalty proceedings against Crown Melbourne and Crown Perth 
(Crown) in March 2022, the Federal Court of Australia imposed a $450 million civil penalty over Crown’s 
breaches of the Anti-Money Laundering and Counter-Terrorism Financing Act 2006 (AML/CTF Act) on 11 
July 2023.   
The court has agreed that the penalty will be paid over two years and also ordered Crown to pay 
AUSTRAC’s costs of $3.356 million.   In accordance with Resource Management Guide 125: 
Commonwealth Entities Financial Statements Guide, the reimbursement of legal costs will first be 
applied against 2023-24 year‐to‐date legal expenses that directly related to the Crown matter with the 
balance being recognised as other income (revenue) in 2023-24. 
Reporting of Administered Activities 
Administered revenues, expenses, assets, liabilities and cash flows are disclosed in the schedule of 
administered items and related notes. 
Except where otherwise stated below, administered items are accounted for on the same basis and 
using the same policies as for departmental items, including the application of Australian Accounting 
Standards.

Accounting Policy
Short-term leases and leases of low-value assets
AUSTRAC has elected not to recognise right-of-use assets and lease liabilities for short-term leases of assets that 
have a lease term of 12 months or less and leases of  low-value assets (less than $10,000). AUSTRAC recognises 
the lease payments associated with these leases as an expense on a straight-line basis over the lease term.

Accounting Policy
AUSTRAC enters into various Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) contracts for service 
delivery arrangements with related parties, specifically other Federal Government Agencies. 
These agreements can last from 6 months to 4 years.
AUSTRAC’s recognition of this revenue is largely based on when the performance obligations 
and customer satisfaction is met. This can be at multiple recognition points throughout the 
contract period and will include:
- point in time recognition for some obligations such as training, seminars, on ground activities, 
licence services, asset acquisitions, and
- upon receipt of revenue when delivering management services on an ongoing basis to the 
customer.  For management purposes, this may result in revenue being recognised throughout 
the financial year, however all revenue received for delivering management services will be 
recognised in full in the financial year of receipt.
Where AUSTRAC has assessed the revenue under AASB 15, AUSTRAC will recognise the 
revenue upon completion of activities. For revenue assessed under AASB 1058, AUSTRAC will 
recognise the revenue in the year when the contribution is received.

Revenue from Government
Revenue from Government amounts appropriated for departmental appropriations for the period 
(adjusted for any formal additions and reductions) are recognised as revenue from Government 
when AUSTRAC gains control of the appropriation. Appropriations receivable are recognised at 
their nominal amounts.
Accounting Policy
Resources received free of charge
Resources received free of charge are recognised as revenue when, and only when, a fair value 
can be reliably determined and the services would have been purchased if they had not been 
donated. Use of these resources is recognised as an expense. Resources received free of 
charge are recorded as either revenue or gains depending on their nature.

Financial assets
Financial assets are classified as loans and receivables and are assessed for impairment at the end of each 
reporting period. The classification depends on the nature and purpose of the financial assets and is determined at 
the time of initial recognition. Financial assets are recognised and derecognised upon trade date and are assessed 
for impairment at the end of each reporting period. AASB 9 classification treatment has not materially changed the 
impairment of receivables.
Loans and Receivables
Where loans and receivables are not subject to concessional treatment, they are carried at amortised cost using the 
effective interest method.  Gains and losses due to impairment, derecognition and amortisation are recognised 
through the statement of comprehensive income. 
Financial assets were assessed for impairment in accordance with the impairment policy stated below. No indicators of 
impairment were identified as at 30 June 2023

Revaluations of non-financial assets
All revaluations are conducted in accordance with the revaluation policy stated below.  Revaluations were conducted this year on all asset classes. Revaluation increments as a 
result were: Leasehold improvements $0.025m, Property plant and equipment $0.378m, Fixtures and fittings $0.060m, Intangibles Nil, (Leasehold improvements 2022: Nil, 
Property plant and equipment 2022: Nil, Fixtures and fittings 2022:  Nil, Intangibles 2022: Nil).


/  AUSTRAC ANNUAL REPORT 2022-23
Accounting Policy 
Assets are recorded at cost of acquisition, except where stated below.  
The cost of acquisition includes the fair value of assets transferred in exchange and liabilities 
undertaken. Financial assets are initially measured at their fair value plus transaction costs where 
appropriate. 
Assets acquired at no cost, or for nominal consideration, are initially recognised as assets and income at 
their fair value at the date of acquisition, unless acquired as a consequence of restructuring of 
administrative arrangements. In the latter case, assets are initially recognised as contributions by owners 
at the amounts at which they were recognised in the transferor’s accounts immediately prior to the 
restructuring. 
Asset Recognition Threshold 
Purchases of property, plant and equipment are recognised initially at cost in the statement of financial 
position, except for purchases costing less than $2,000, which are expensed in the year of acquisition 
(other than where they form part of a group of similar items which are significant in total). 
The initial cost of an asset includes an estimate of the cost of dismantling and removing the item and 
restoring the site on which it is located. This is particularly relevant to ‘make good’ provisions in property 
leases taken up by AUSTRAC where there exists an obligation to restore the property back to its original 
condition. These costs are included in the value of leasehold improvements with a corresponding 
recognition of a provision for restoration obligation. 
Lease Right of Use (ROU) Assets 
Leased ROU assets are capitalised at the commencement date of the lease and comprise of the initial 
lease liability amount, initial direct costs incurred when entering into the lease less any lease incentives 
received. These assets are accounted for by Commonwealth lessees as separate asset classes to 
corresponding assets owned outright, but included in the same column as where the corresponding 
underlying assets would be presented if they were owned. 
On initial adoption of AASB 16 in 2020 AUSTRAC adjusted the ROU assets at the date of initial 
application by the amount of any provision for onerous leases recognised immediately before the date of 
initial application. Following initial application, an impairment review is undertaken for any ROU lease 
asset that shows indicators of impairment and an impairment loss is recognised against any ROU leased 
asset that is impaired. Lease ROU assets continue to be measured at cost after initial recognition in 
Commonwealth agency, GGS and Whole of Government financial statements. 
Revaluations 
Fair values for each class of asset are determined as shown below: 
Asset class 
Fair value measured at 
Leasehold improvements 
Current replacement cost, adjusted for obsolescence 
Property, plant and 
equipment 
Current replacement cost, adjusted for obsolescence 
 
Following initial recognition at cost, items of property, plant and equipment (excluding ROU assets) are 
carried at fair value (or an amount not materially different to fair value) less subsequent accumulated 
depreciation and accumulated impairment losses. Independent valuations are conducted with sufficient 
frequency to ensure that the carrying amounts of assets do not differ materially from the assets fair 
values as at the reporting date. The frequency of independent valuations is dependent upon the volatility 
of movements in market values for relevant assets.  AUSTRAC has assessed a three year update is 
appropriate to meet this requirement with the most recent independent valuation conducted during May 
2023 for a valuation date of 30 June 2023. 
Revaluation adjustments are made on a class basis. Any revaluation increment is credited to equity 
under the heading of asset revaluation reserve except to the extent that it reverses a previous 
revaluation decrement of the same asset that was previously recognised in the surplus/deficit. 
Revaluation decrements for a class of assets are recognised directly in the surplus/deficit except to the 
extent that they reverse a previous revaluation increment for that class. 


199  / 240
REPORT ON FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE
Any accumulated depreciation as at the revaluation date is eliminated against the gross carrying amount 
of the asset and the asset restated to the revalued amount. Depreciation is recalculated over the 
remaining estimated useful life of the asset on a straight line basis. 
Depreciation 
Depreciable property, plant and equipment assets are written-off to their estimated residual values over 
their estimated useful lives to AUSTRAC using, in all cases, the straight-line method of depreciation. 
Depreciation rates (useful lives), residual values and methods are reviewed at each reporting date and 
necessary adjustments are recognised in the current, or current and future reporting periods, as 
appropriate. 
Depreciation rates applying to each class of depreciable asset are based on the following useful lives: 
Asset class 
2023 
2022 
Leasehold improvements 
Lease term 
Lease term 
Property, plant and 
equipment 
3 to 10 years from date of purchase 
3 to 10 years from date of 
purchase 
 
The depreciation rates for ROU assets are based on the commencement date to the earlier of the end of 
the useful life of the ROU asset or the end of the lease term. 
Impairment 
All assets were assessed for indications of impairment as at 30 June 2023. Where indications of 
impairment exist, the recoverable amount of the asset is estimated and an impairment adjustment made 
if the recoverable amount is less than the carrying amount. 
The recoverable amount of an asset is the higher of its fair value less costs of disposal and its value in 
use. Value in use is the present value of the future cash flows expected to be derived from the asset. 
Where the future economic benefit of an asset is not primarily dependent on the asset’s ability to 
generate future cash flows, and the asset would be replaced if the entity were deprived of the asset, its 
value in use is taken to be its depreciated replacement cost. 
Derecognition 
An item of property, plant and equipment is derecognised upon disposal or when no further future 
economic benefits are expected from its use. 
Intangibles 
AUSTRAC's intangibles comprise purchased and internally developed software for internal use. These 
assets have been internally assessed for impairment as at 30 June 2023. 
Software is amortised on a straight line basis over its anticipated useful life. The useful lives of 
AUSTRAC’s software are 1 to 10 years (2021-22: 1 to 10 years). 
All software assets were assessed for indications of impairment as at 30 June 2023. 
Accounting Judgements and Estimates Fair Value Measurement  
AUSTRAC relies on the expert advice of internal staff to conduct asset materiality reviews of all non-
financial assets held at fair value as at reporting date and relies upon those outcomes to establish 
carrying amounts.  
An annual assessment is undertaken to determine whether the carrying amount of assets differs 
materially from the fair value. Comprehensive valuations are undertaken at least once every three years.  
The fair value of property, plant and equipment is determined using either the Market Approach or the 
Cost Approach. 
Any accumulated depreciation as at the revaluation date is eliminated against the gross carrying amount 
of the asset and the asset restated to the revalued amount. Depreciation is recalculated over the 
remaining estimated useful life of the asset on a straight line basis. 
Depreciation 
Depreciable property, plant and equipment assets are written-off to their estimated residual values over 
their estimated useful lives to AUSTRAC using, in all cases, the straight-line method of depreciation. 
Depreciation rates (useful lives), residual values and methods are reviewed at each reporting date and 
necessary adjustments are recognised in the current, or current and future reporting periods, as 
appropriate. 
Depreciation rates applying to each class of depreciable asset are based on the following useful lives: 
Asset class 
2023 
2022 
Leasehold improvements 
Lease term 
Lease term 
Property, plant and 
equipment 
3 to 10 years from date of purchase 
3 to 10 years from date of 
purchase 
 
The depreciation rates for ROU assets are based on the commencement date to the earlier of the end of 
the useful life of the ROU asset or the end of the lease term. 
Impairment 
All assets were assessed for indications of impairment as at 30 June 2023. Where indications of 
impairment exist, the recoverable amount of the asset is estimated and an impairment adjustment made 
if the recoverable amount is less than the carrying amount. 
The recoverable amount of an asset is the higher of its fair value less costs of disposal and its value in 
use. Value in use is the present value of the future cash flows expected to be derived from the asset. 
Where the future economic benefit of an asset is not primarily dependent on the asset’s ability to 
generate future cash flows, and the asset would be replaced if the entity were deprived of the asset, its 
value in use is taken to be its depreciated replacement cost. 
Derecognition 
An item of property, plant and equipment is derecognised upon disposal or when no further future 
economic benefits are expected from its use. 
Intangibles 
AUSTRAC's intangibles comprise purchased and internally developed software for internal use. These 
assets have been internally assessed for impairment as at 30 June 2023. 
Software is amortised on a straight line basis over its anticipated useful life. The useful lives of 
AUSTRAC’s software are 1 to 10 years (2021-22: 1 to 10 years). 
All software assets were assessed for indications of impairment as at 30 June 2023. 
Accounting Judgements and Estimates Fair Value Measurement

1. The contract liabilities are associated with various Memorandum of Understanding arrangements with 
other Federal Government Agencies for the delivery of specific activities. These agreements can last 
from 6 months to 4 years and are paid to AUSTRAC under section 74 of the PGPA Act.
Total cash outflow for leases for the year ended 30 June 2023 was $5.404 million, (2022 $5.189 million)
Accounting Policy
Leases
For all new contracts entered into, AUSTRAC considers whether the contract is, or contains a lease. 
A lease is defined as ‘a contract, or part of a contract, that conveys the right to use an asset (the 
underlying asset) for a period of time in exchange for consideration’. Once it has been determined 
that a contract is, or contains a lease, the lease liability is initially measured at the present value of 
the lease payments unpaid at the commencement date, discounted using the interest rate implicit in 
the lease, if that rate is readily determinable, or AUSTRAC’s incremental borrowing rate. Subsequent 
to initial measurement, the liability will be reduced for payments made and increased for interest. It is 
remeasured to reflect any reassessment or modification to the lease. When the lease liability is 
remeasured, the corresponding adjustment is reflected in the right-of-use asset or profit and loss 
depending on the nature of the reassessment or modification.

3.2 Net Cash Appropriation Arrangements
1. From 2010-11, the Government introduced net cash appropriation arrangements where revenue appropriations for
depreciation/amortisation expenses of non-corporate Commonwealth entities and selected corporate Commonwealth
entities were replaced with a separate capital budget provided through equity injections. Capital budgets are to be
appropriated in the period when cash payment for capital expenditure is required.
2. The inclusion of depreciation/amortisation expenses related to ROU leased assets and the lease liability principal
repayment amount reflects the impact of AASB 16 Leases, which does not directly reflect a change in appropriation
arrangements.

Total employee provisions

This section describes a range of employment and post employment benefits provided to our people and our relationships with other key 
people.
Accounting Policy
Liabilities for short-term employee benefits and termination benefits due within twelve months of the end of reporting period are 
measured at their nominal amounts.
The nominal amount is calculated with regard to the rates expected to be paid on settlement of the liability.
Other long-term employee benefits are measured as the net total of the present value of the defined benefit obligation at the end of 
the reporting period.
Leave
The liability for employee benefits includes provisions for annual leave and long service leave. No provision has been made for sick 
leave as all sick leave is non-vesting and the average sick leave taken in future years by employees of AUSTRAC is estimated to be 
less than the annual entitlement for sick leave.
The leave liabilities are calculated on the basis of employees’ remuneration at the estimated salary rates that will be applied at the 
time the leave is taken, including AUSTRAC’s employer superannuation contribution rates and other employee benefits to the extent 
that the leave is likely to be taken during service rather than paid out on termination. 
The liability for long service leave is the present value of employee entitlements based on the Australian Government shorthand 
method as per the FRR. In using this method, AUSTRAC has incorporated standard demographic assumptions and relevant 
parameters deemed applicable to AUSTRAC.
Separation and Redundancy
Provision is made for separation and redundancy benefit payments. The entity recognises a provision for termination when it has 
developed a detailed formal plan for the terminations and has informed those employees affected that it will carry out the terminations.
Superannuation
The majority of AUSTRAC's staff are members of the Commonwealth Superannuation Scheme (CSS), the Public Sector 
Superannuation Scheme (PSS) or the PSS accumulation plan (PSSap). A small number of staff are members of employee nominated 
superannuation funds, as allowed under AUSTRAC's enterprise agreement.
The CSS and PSS are defined benefit schemes for the Australian Government. The PSSap and other employee nominated 
superannuation funds are defined contribution schemes.
The liability for defined benefits is recognised in the financial statements of the Australian Government and is settled by the Australian 
Government in due course. This liability is reported by the Department of Finance administered schedules and notes.
AUSTRAC makes employer contributions to the employees' superannuation scheme at rates determined by an actuary to be sufficient 
to meet the current cost to the Government. AUSTRAC accounts for the contributions as if they were contributions to defined 
contribution plans.
The liability for superannuation recognised as at 30 June 2023 represents outstanding contributions for the final fortnight of the year.
Accounting Judgements and Estimates
The liability for long service leave has been determined by use of the shorthand model which was developed for entities with no more 
than 1,000 employees by the Department of Finance. Under the shorthand model, an entity specific discount factor is calculated 
based on the changing demographic mix of that entity. The discount factor takes into account the timing of the projected LSL 
payments, and represents the impact of increasing payments with the assumed level of salary growth, up to the time of payment. The 
value is then discounted to the present day using the bond rate published annually. AUSTRAC estimates this discount factor with
reference to published Wage Price Index data plus a promotional growth rate as recommended in the model. All other inputs are 
consistent with the recommendations of the shorthand model.

Minister. The Portfolio Minister's remuneration and other benefits are set by the Remuneration Tribunal and are not paid 
by AUSTRAC.
Key management personnel are those persons having authority and responsibility for planning, directing and controlling 
the activities of AUSTRAC, directly or indirectly. AUSTRAC has determined the key management personnel to be the 
Attorney General, the Chief Executive Officer and the three Deputy Chief Executive Officers. Key management 
personnel remuneration is reported in the table below:

4.3 Related Party Disclosures
Related party relationships:
Transactions with related parties:
The following transactions with related parties occurred during the financial year: 
●    No key management personnel (KMP) have entered into any related party transactions with AUSTRAC and there are no 
contracts involving key management personnel interests existing at year end.
The parent entity to AUSTRAC is the Australian Government. AUSTRAC is an Australian Government controlled entity. Related 
parties to AUSTRAC are other Australian Government entities and Key Management Personnel including the Portfolio Minister 
and Executive.
Given the breadth of Government activities, related parties may transact with the government sector in the same capacity as 
ordinary citizens. Such transactions include the payment or refund of taxes, receipt of a Medicare rebate or higher education 
loans. These transactions have not been separately disclosed in this note.
●     AUSTRAC transacts with other Australian Government controlled entities consistent with normal day-to-day business 
operations provided under normal terms and conditions, including the payment of workers compensation, insurance premiums, 
vetting and legal services.  These are not considered individually significant to warrant separate disclosure as related party 
transactions.
●    AUSTRAC transacts with other Australian Government controlled entities for the provision of fee based services to or on 
behalf of those entities. Such services are provided under normal terms and conditions and are not considered individually 
significant to warrant separate disclosure as related party transactions.

5. MANAGING UNCERTAINTIES
This section describes how AUSTRAC manages financial risks within its operating environment.
5.1 Contingent Assets and Liabilities
Quantifiable contingencies
Unquantifiable contingencies
There are no departmental or administered quantifiable contingencies as at 30 June 2023 (2022: Nil).
There are 1 departmental and 3 administered unquantifiable contingencies as at 30 June 2023 (2022: 1 departmental, Nil 
administered). The matters relates to civil penalty proceedings in the Federal Court against regulated entities. One of 
these matters, representing the 1 departmental item and 1 of the 3 administered items,  was finalised as at the date of this 
report with further information provided in the Overview under Post Balance Date Events. AUSTRAC does not consider 
the outcome of these matters to have a significant effect on its operations or financial position.
Accounting Policy
Contingent liabilities and contingent assets are not recognised in the Statement of Financial Position but are reported in 
this note. They may arise from uncertainty as to the existence of a liability or asset or represent an asset or liability in 
respect of which the amount cannot be reliably measured. Contingent assets are disclosed when settlement is probable 
but not virtually certain and contingent liabilities are disclosed when settlement is greater than remote.
Significant accounting judgements and estimates
No accounting assumptions or estimates relating to contingencies have been identified that have a significant risk of 
causing a material adjustment to carrying amounts of assets and liabilities within the next reporting period.

REPORT ON FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE
 
 
Accounting Policy 
Financial assets 
AUSTRAC classifies its financial assets at amortised cost. 
Financial assets are recognised when the entity becomes a party to the contract and, as a consequence, 
has a legal right to receive or a legal obligation to pay cash and derecognised when the contractual rights 
to the cash flows from the financial asset expire or are transferred upon trade date.  
Financial Assets at Amortised Cost 
Financial assets included in this category are held in order to collect the contractual cash flows and the 
cash flows are solely payments of principal and interest (SPPI) on the principal outstanding amount. 
Amortised cost is determined using the effective interest method. 
Effective Interest Method 
Income is recognised on an effective interest rate basis for financial assets that are recognised at 
amortised cost. 
Impairment of Financial Assets 
Financial assets are assessed for impairment at the end of each reporting period based on expected 
credit losses.  
The simplified approach for trade receivables is used. This approach always measures the loss 
allowance as the amount equal to the lifetime expected credit losses. 
A write-off constitutes a de-recognition event where the write-off directly reduces the gross carrying 
amount of the financial asset. 
Financial liabilities 
Financial liabilities are recognised and derecognised upon ‘trade date’. 
Financial Liabilities at Amortised Cost 
Financial liabilities are initially measured at fair value, net of transaction costs.  These liabilities are 
subsequently measured at amortised cost using the effective interest method, with interest expense 
recognised on an effective interest basis.  
Liabilities are recognised to the extent that the goods or services have been received (and irrespective of 
having been invoiced).

Fighting financial crime, together
13 September 2019

The Hon Peter Dutton MP
Minister for Home Affairs
Parliament House
CANBERRA  ACT  2600


Dear Minister
I am pleased to present the annual report for the year ended 30 June 2019 on the operations 
of the Australian Transaction Reports and Analysis Centre (AUSTRAC), as is required by subsection 
46(1) of the Public Governance, Performance and Accountability Act 2013.

The report has been prepared pursuant to the requirements for annual reports approved by 
the Joint Committee of Public Accounts and Audit and as prescribed in the Public Governance, 
Performance and Accountability Rule 2014.

As the accountable authority for AUSTRAC, I certify the agency has prepared fraud and corruption risk 
assessments and a fraud and corruption control plan that comply with the requirements of section 
10 of the Public Governance, Performance and Accountability Rule 2014, and the Commonwealth 
Fraud Control Policy. We have fraud prevention, detection, investigation, reporting and data collection 
procedures and processes in place that align with the requirements of the Commonwealth Fraud 
Control Framework 2017.  

We have taken reasonable measures to minimise the incidence of fraud within the agency 
and to investigate and recover the proceeds of fraud against the agency.

Yours sincerely





Nicole Rose PSM

/  AUSTRAC ANNUAL REPORT 2018-19
AUSTRAC is at the heart 
of the framework designed to 
protect Australia’s financial system, 
businesses and the wider community 
from criminal abuse.


01  / 150
NICOLE ROSE, CEO
Nicole Rose PSM commenced as the Chief 
Executive Officer (CEO) of AUSTRAC in 
November 2017.
As AUSTRAC CEO, Nicole leads Australia’s 
financial intelligence unit and anti-money 
laundering/counter-terrorism financing 
regulator. AUSTRAC builds resilience in 
the financial system and disrupts money 
laundering, terrorism financing and other 
serious crime.
Nicole has an extensive and diverse career 
in Australia’s law enforcement, criminal justice 
and intelligence agencies. Her expertise 
includes criminal justice policy and programs, 
legislative development, forensic intelligence 
and offender management.
Before joining AUSTRAC, Nicole was Deputy 
Secretary Criminal Justice Group in the 
Attorney-General’s Department. Prior to that 
she was Deputy CEO of the Australian Criminal 
Intelligence Commission, CEO of CrimTrac, 
and Director of the Office of the NSW Police 
Commissioner. Nicole also held senior roles 
in the NSW Premier’s Department, Ministry for 
Police, and Serious Offenders’ Review Council 
(NSW Department of Corrective Services).
Nicole was awarded a Public Service Medal 
in 2013, for her services to policing.

As CEO, Nicole served as AUSTRAC’s 
accountable authority for the duration 
of 2018-19. 
2018-19 AT AUSTRAC
Over the last 12 months, AUSTRAC has made 
significant strides in increasing operational 
efficiencies. As reported last year, AUSTRAC 
led enforcement action resulting in a $700 
million penalty against the Commonwealth 
Bank of Australia—representing the largest 
civil penalty in Australia’s corporate history. 
This, combined with the Royal Commission into 
Misconduct in the Banking, Superannuation and 
Financial Services Industry, has seen the number 
of self-disclosed reports by AUSTRAC’s regulated 
entities soar. 
In response to the increasing volume of reports, 
we are continually looking for new efficiencies 
and innovations to monitor compliance, identify 
and act on non-compliance, and generate 
actionable, meaningful intelligence for our 
partners and us. 
PARTNER OF CHOICE
AUSTRAC recognises that to be effective 
at protecting Australia from crime, we must 
be a partner of choice. We prioritise working 
with our domestic and international partners 
to detect, disrupt and prevent criminal 
exploitation of Australia’s financial sector. 
CEO REVIEW


/  AUSTRAC ANNUAL REPORT 2018-19
Our inclusion in the expanded National 
Intelligence Community and Home Affairs 
portfolio demonstrates the value of AUSTRAC’s 
intelligence to Australia’s national security 
priorities, including the following.
•	
Participation in many cross-agency task 
forces—for example, with the Australian 
Federal Police, Australian Border Force 
and Western Australian Police, AUSTRAC 
intelligence played a key role in tracking 
hundreds of bank transactions estimated 
to be worth $29.5 million. This resulted 
in 10 arrests made on money laundering 
and drug charges.
•	
Expansion of Fintel Alliance, AUSTRAC’s 
established public-private partnership. 
Over the 2018-19 period, Fintel Alliance 
continued to mature, expanding to 
25 private sector and government 
members. There were many operational 
highlights, including Fintel Alliance 
intelligence contributing to the arrest 
of over 100 persons of interest and the 
protection of over 170 victims of child 
exploitation. 
•	
To support our Government partners, 
we launched a new Financial Forensics tool 
for analysts, which allows our partners to 
undertake more complex analysis of larger 
data sets in a more timely way.
INTERNATIONAL ENGAGEMENT 
AND STRENGTHENING OUR REGION
Internationally, AUSTRAC works with 
intelligence partners to share insights, trends 
and data to disrupt transnational organised 
crime and terrorism threats. We also regularly 
engage with our valued neighbours, working 
together to strengthen the South-East Asian 
financial sector. 
Over 2018-19 we continued to collaborate with 
our international partners. Highlights include:
•	
hosting and chairing the 25th Egmont 
Plenary in Sydney, with over 400 
delegates from financial intelligence 
units from around the world
•	
chairing the fourth Counter-Terrorism 
Financing Summit held in Thailand
•	
hosting seven anti-money laundering/
counter-terrorism financing regulators 
as part of the International Supervisors 
forum in Melbourne
•	
delivering financial intelligence and 
regulatory training in Brunei, Cambodia, 
Indonesia, Malaysia, Papua New Guinea 
and the Philippines, to continue to harden 
our region against financial crime.

AUSTRAC’s international presence grew 
beyond Indonesia, Malaysia and the 
Philippines in 2018-19, with staff commencing 
deployments in China, the United Kingdom 
and the United States of America. Like 
our contributions to international forums, 
outposted staff are vital in forging new 


03  / 150
international partnerships. Through our 
relationships, we enhance information sharing 
and build financial regulation and intelligence 
capabilities across the region and globally, to 
protect Australia from transnational threats 
including organised crime and terrorism.

STREAMLINING COMPLIANCE 
AND INCREASING EFFICIENCY
In 2018-19, we worked at enhancing our 
relationship with more than 14,800 reporting 
entities. Throughout the year, we published a 
range of guidance papers designed to equip 
businesses with the knowledge to identify 
patterns of criminal behaviour and protect 
their business from criminal exploitation. 
This work complements AUSTRAC’s regulatory 
education and outreach activities, tailored 
to each industry sector. Since we began 
regulating the digital currency exchange (DCE) 
industry last year, we have made a special 
effort to inform DCEs of their obligations. 
AUSTRAC’s approach to regulation is one 
of collaboration. We are committed to 
enhancing our regulatory functions and 
providing tools and guidance that assist 
regulated entities to understand and meet 
their obligations. In 2018-19, this included:
•	
releasing our ‘Approach to regulation’ 
paper and a number of new informative 
resources to support the sector
•	
following feedback from a range of 
reporting entities, we designed and 
launched a new AUSTRAC website 
with improved language, navigation, 
and search function
•	
introducing a new regulatory triage 
process, reducing processing time 
frames in some cases from several 
months or years, down to hours.

THE YEAR AHEAD
In the evolving financial environment in 
which we operate, we continue to embrace 
innovation and technological advancements 
to optimise our capabilities and manage 
the exponential growth of the data 
we are required to ingest and analyse.
We are aiming to continue to increase 
enforcement and further streamline compliance.
As the Fintel Alliance continues to mature 
and expand, we will have increased opportunities 
to work more closely with our partners through 
collaborative sharing of information, intelligence, 
capability and technology.
We are also expanding our international 
connections, working with more international 
partners to better respond to offshore criminal 
activities impacting Australia.
I look forward to continuing to lead this 
dynamic agency to harness our capabilities 
and strengthen the financial system against 
serious and organised crime.

AGENCY OVERVIEW
04
Our vision: A financial 
system free from 
criminal abuse


05   / 150
ROLE AND FUNCTIONS
The Australian Transaction Reports and 
Analysis Centre (AUSTRAC) is Australia’s 
financial intelligence unit (FIU), with regulatory 
responsibility for anti-money laundering 
and counter-terrorism financing (AML/CTF).
We use financial intelligence and regulation to:
•	
	
prevent criminal abuse 
of the financial sector
•	
	
generate and share intelligence 
and insights to mitigate risk in the 
financial system
•	
	
help our government and law 
enforcement partners detect, deter and 
disrupt money laundering, terrorism 
financing and other serious crime
•	
	
build and maintain trust and integrity 
in Australia’s financial system as part 
of the global community.
AUSTRAC’s purpose, as stated in our 
corporate plan 2018-22, is to build resilience 
in the financial system and use financial 
intelligence and regulation to disrupt money 
laundering, terrorism financing and other 
serious crime. 
We do this by:
•	
	
Discovering new and emerging risks. 
Identifying risks posed by criminal actors 
seeking to exploit the financial system.
•	
	
Understanding our environment. 
Developing and sharing a 
comprehensive understanding of 
vulnerabilities within the global financial 
system at risk of criminal exploitation. 
•	
	
Strengthening the financial system. 
Ensuring that risks within the financial 
system are minimised through effective 
controls deployed by an engaged, 
capable and collaborative community.
•	
	
Disrupting criminal abuse of the 
financial system. Collaborating with 
our partners to detect, understand 
and disrupt criminal exploitation of 
the financial system. 
•	
	
Optimising our business. Continuously 
evolving and adapting our business 
operations to improve efficiency, 
effectiveness and sustainability in 
a dynamic operating environment. 


/  AUSTRAC ANNUAL REPORT 2018-19
Our purpose is underpinned by the objectives 
of the Anti-Money Laundering and Counter-
Terrorism Financing Act 2006 (AML/CTF Act), 
which include to:
•	
	
support cooperation and collaboration 
among reporting entities, AUSTRAC 
and other government agencies—
particularly law enforcement agencies—
to detect, deter and disrupt money 
laundering, terrorism financing, and 
other serious financial crimes
•	
provide relevant Australian government 
bodies and their international counterparts 
with the information they need to 
investigate and prosecute money 
laundering and terrorism financing 
offences and other serious crimes
•	
	
promote public confidence in the 
Australian financial system through 
the enactment and implementation 
of controls and powers to detect, deter 
and disrupt money laundering, terrorism 
financing and other serious crimes
•	
	
to fulfil Australia’s international 
obligations and address matters of 
international concern in combating 
money laundering and terrorism 
financing, while beneficially affecting 
Australia’s relations with foreign countries 
and international organisations.
As Australia’s AML/CTF regulator, AUSTRAC 
oversees the compliance of more than 14,000 
Australian businesses with the requirements 
of the AML/CTF Act and Financial Transaction 
Reports Act 1988. 
Our regulatory activities assist reporting 
entities with strengthening their AML/
CTF controls to identify and mitigate their 
risks. This hardens the environment against 
criminal exploitation and builds trust within 
the financial sector. 
In an environment where new opportunities 
and challenges continually emerge, we play 
a unique role as a conduit of information 
between industry and government agencies. 
This maximises opportunities to generate and 
share intelligence, build relationships with 
reporting entities and ultimately achieve our 
purpose. 
In partnership with industry and government 
agencies in Australia and overseas, we help 
keep Australia safe from financial crime, 
transnational crime and terrorism. We build 
and maintain trust and integrity in Australia’s 
financial system as part of the global 
community. 
AUSTRAC is an independent statutory agency 
in the Home Affairs portfolio. This creates 
opportunities to work more closely with our 
partner agencies to better protect Australia 
against evolving security concerns. Being 
part of the portfolio since 2017 has enhanced 
AUSTRAC’s ability to perform our role as a 
conduit of intelligence between the financial 
sector and Australia’s law enforcement and 
National Intelligence Community.

Our performance 
framework
AUSTRAC is governed by the Public 
Governance, Performance and Accountability Act 
2013. Our performance framework measures 
our ability to deliver on our purpose. It joins 
our purpose and performance criteria and 
aligns with our 2018-19 Portfolio Budget 
Statement and performance information. 
The annual performance statements in this 
report (see pages 20-56) detail our progress 
against the performance criteria in our 2018-22 
corporate plan. 




In 2014 the Australian Government established 
the Regulator Performance Framework to 
help reduce the burden of unnecessary or 
inefficient regulation imposed on individuals, 
business and community organisations. In 
compliance with the framework, we undertake 
and publish an annual self-assessment that is 
validated by our stakeholders within industry. 
It is published by the end of each calendar year 
on our website.

/  AUSTRAC ANNUAL REPORT 2018-19
AUSTRAC’s performance relies on several 
key capabilities. As outlined in the 2018-22 
corporate plan, the agency’s operations are 
centred around our regulatory and intelligence 
capabilities, our work in the international arena, 
data and innovation, and our people and 
corporate enablers.  
REGULATION
As Australia’s anti-money laundering and 
counter-terrorism financing (AML/CTF) 
regulator, AUSTRAC regulates more than 
14,000 individuals, businesses and 
organisations. We make sure they are 
complying with their obligations under the 
Anti-Money Laundering and Counter-Terrorism 
Financing Act 2006 (AML/CTF Act) and the 
Financial Transaction Reports Act 1988. We do 
this to protect them, and the financial sector, 
from criminal abuse.
Reporting entities’ obligations include 
reporting financial transactions and suspicious 
activity to AUSTRAC, through suspicious matter 
reports, threshold transaction reports and 
international funds transfer instruction reports.
Our regulatory activities also include:
•	
identifying new and emerging risks
•	
identifying and collecting data 
to generate regulatory insights
•	
using regulatory insights and financial 
intelligence to assess industry 
vulnerabilities and threats to 
Australia’s financial sector
•	
collaborating with industry to improve 
risk management, help them comply, 
and educate them on risks and 
compliance
•	
supporting national security 
and law enforcement operations
•	
taking a risk-based approach to how we 
handle non-compliant reporting entities
•	
taking enforcement action against 
reporting entities for serious and/or 
systemic breaches of the AML/CTF Act.

In 2018-19 our regulatory function was 
undertaken by AUSTRAC’s Regulatory 
Strategy Division.

/  AUSTRAC ANNUAL REPORT 2018-19
INTELLIGENCE
As Australia’s financial intelligence unit (FIU), 
AUSTRAC collects information from the 
thousands of entities we regulate. Our financial 
intelligence analysts use this information to 
identify financial transactions linked to crimes 
including money laundering, terrorism financing, 
and other forms of serious and organised crime.
AUSTRAC’s work forms part of a wider 
landscape of intelligence and national 
security agencies that work together to 
protect Australia from those who might do 
us harm. We place a high priority on effective 
partnerships and timely, accurate and 
actionable financial intelligence. We share our 
expertise with a wide range of domestic and 
international partner agencies. Over the past 
year, we have strengthened the contribution 
of our intelligence to broader government 
national security priorities, through our 
inclusion in the Home Affairs portfolio 
and the National Intelligence Community. 
Since its establishment in 2017, the Fintel 
Alliance has transformed our capability to 
tackle a broad range of threats to Australia. 
These include terrorism financing, money 
laundering, drug trafficking, child exploitation, 
cybercrime, and other serious and organised 
crime. It has proved to be a world-class example 
of the power of public-private partnerships 
in the financial intelligence sector. The Fintel 
Alliance has enhanced the way we communicate 
and exchange knowledge and ideas between 
industry partners and government agencies. 
INTERNATIONAL 
CAPABILITY
As new and developing technologies make 
moving money around the world faster and 
easier, organised crime has been quick to take 
advantage of these opportunities. To combat 
money laundering, terrorism financing and other 
serious financial crime threats, a powerful global 
response is needed. AUSTRAC makes a significant 
contribution to international efforts by:
•	
exchanging information and intelligence 
with other FIUs and AML/CTF regulators 
around the world
•	
playing an active role in international 
AML/CTF organisations, including the 
Financial Action Task Force, the Egmont 
Group of FIUs and the Asia/Pacific Group 
on Money Laundering
•	
delivering regional solutions to terrorism 
financing and money laundering issues 
and risks, through our support for the 
annual CTF Summit
•	
supporting international partners through 
technical assistance and training.
In 2018-19, we expanded our international 
footprint by deploying additional staff overseas.

/  AUSTRAC ANNUAL REPORT 2018-19
OUR DATA AND 
INNOVATION 
AUSTRAC’s ability to manage and leverage 
data provided from industry and other 
partners is critical to our performance and 
the value of our intelligence. The growth in 
money laundering and terrorism financing 
activities globally, requires collecting more 
detailed information, searching for new data 
sources and developing advanced tools 
to analyse and correlate high-volume, 
high-variety information quickly.
Our regulatory operations have significantly 
invested in using data analysis and advanced 
analytics to: increase our understanding of 
compliance and risk across the financial sector; 
and apply near real-time monitoring to identify 
and respond to non-compliance. This enables 
AUSTRAC to respond rapidly and intervene 
early, preventing further non-compliance and 
extending our operational reach with existing 
resources. We also leverage user-friendly and 
agile technology to minimise the regulatory 
burden on reporting entities. This also enables 
us to provide accurate and actionable financial 
intelligence, generate insights and provide raw 
data to partners in near real-time. 




AUSTRAC continuously refines and standardises 
the data received from reporting entities. 
Our data scientists, in collaboration with 
researchers from Data 61 and the Australian 
National University, have created state-of-the-art 
algorithms to manage inconsistencies between 
data sets and recognise linkages between them 
to identify persons of interest. 

We cooperate closely with other government 
agencies by sharing data and matching data 
sets. We are developing techniques for sharing 
our data with our Fintel Alliance partners and 
overseas FIUs.
AUSTRAC is focused on being adaptable to 
meet future technological challenges. We are 
shifting to open-source, component-based 
platforms and systems to join various data silos, 
enable faster operational response, greater 
data access and enhanced sharing capabilities. 
This includes the development of a specialised 
case management system, and deployment 
of a mobility solution for staff.

For AUSTRAC to be effective in our role, it is critical that we proactively uncover new and emerging 
risks facing the financial system. In a complex and evolving environment, we need to continually 
assess the insights we get from our data. We also explore opportunities to unlock the potential of 
our vast data sets and information. During 2018-19 we continued to enrich and link our data with 
our partners, with valuable lessons learnt to identify new risks and for future innovation in data 
and information sharing more broadly.


/  AUSTRAC ANNUAL REPORT 2018-19
LINKING AND SHARING DATA 
WITH PARTNER AGENCIES
AUSTRAC works with the Department of 
Human Services (DHS) on data sharing 
and matching, to strengthen the integrity 
of welfare payments. DHS data assists us 
to verify information, such as entity details 
in transaction reports, and expand on the 
financial analysis we perform.
In 2018-19 we developed automated bulk data 
matching, which allows us to realise the value 
of combined data sets. This enhanced our ability 
to successfully detect and prevent welfare fraud, 
with DHS. In 2018-19 we contributed to more 
than 1,510 cases and more than $16 million 
in savings achieved by DHS in its increased 
detection of welfare fraud. 
We also continued to collaborate with the 
Australian Taxation Office (ATO) to provide 
high-volume transaction report data. This 
enables the ATO to identify undeclared foreign 
source income and serious non-compliance, 
which drives revenue savings. In the ATO’s 
analysis for 2018-19, it was found that more 
than 4,500 ATO cases used AUSTRAC’s financial 
intelligence capability. These cases contributed 
to the ATO’s raised revenue of more than $210 
million for the financial year. 
ENTITY RESOLUTION ALGORITHM

AUSTRAC has developed an innovative 
algorithm as a solution to the problem of data 
matching or linking millions of entities across 
disparate data sets. This represents a significant 
advance in our financial intelligence capability. 
Testing has shown that the algorithm performs 
better than previously reported state-of-the-art 
algorithms. It uses ‘big data’ to take advantage 
of parallel processing, and is robust in dealing 
with messy, misleading or incomplete data. It 
also offers improved accuracy while cutting 
the processing time for resolving more than 
five billion transactions from months to around 
three-and-a-half hours. 
Many partner agencies have expressed 
interest in implementing our entity resolution 
algorithm. Research work with CSIRO’s Data61 
and the Australian National University is well 
underway, to extend the core algorithm to 
become privacy preserving to allow analysis to 
take place while ensuring the privacy of entity 
data. This work will open up new possibilities 
for data sharing with partner agencies and 
reporting entities. 


25  / 150
CO-DESIGNING INFORMATION 
SOLUTIONS WITH BUSINESS
Both AUSTRAC and the Australian Criminal 
Intelligence Commission (ACIC) are facing 
an increase in the scope and volume of 
information collected, analysed and shared in 
numerous sectors, nationally and internationally. 
To look at new and innovative ways to solve 
the associated policy and service delivery 
problems, AUSTRAC and the ACIC turned 
to the Australian Government’s Business 
Research and Innovation Initiative program.
The program provides opportunities for 
small-to-medium enterprises to work with 
government to develop innovative products 
and services with genuine commercial 
potential. A joint AUSTRAC-ACIC proposal was 
one of the winners in the first round of the 
program, with solutions to the challenge of 
‘tracking the effect and value of information 
products’. The solutions offer interesting 
opportunities for us to explore how we could 
use technologies like blockchain for sharing, 
tracking and machine learning to support 
valuation tools, to potentially track performance 
of information products. A pilot solution for 
a secure, decentralised information-sharing 
platform was developed in November 2018. 
Features include blockchain power, search, 
tracking, collaboration and performance tools.



Working alongside the vendors has helped 
us to understand the challenges associated 
with developing and implementing tools to 
collect feedback on intelligence products, 
as well as indicative costs. Learnings from 
our participation in the program have also 
informed ongoing projects, including: the 
creation of an international sharing platform 
pilot between AUSTRAC and our international 
counterparts Pusat Pelaporan Dan Analisis 
Transaksi Keuangan (PPATK) and Bank Negara 
Malaysia to address some of challenges with 
information sharing; and a secure sharing 
platform being developed by the Fintel Alliance.

AUSTRAC takes a collaborative approach to 
support businesses and partner agencies to 
become more knowledgeable, vigilant, and 
capable of discovering and communicating 
threats of criminal exploitation. We educate, 
monitor and promote compliance with 
money laundering/terrorism financing (ML/TF) 
legislation, to strengthen the financial sector 
and build resilience. 
AUSTRAC uses a range of mechanisms to 
collect and share information and practices, 
to improve information sharing among our 
domestic and international partners. This is in 
addition to our ongoing participation in various 
interagency task forces and international 
forums (see pages 27).
ML/TF risk assessments 
ML/TF risk assessments are one form of industry-
specific, tailored guidance we provide to help 
keep our regulated population informed of new 
and emerging ML/TF risks in the financial system. 










ON-COURSE BOOKMAKERS
In December 2018 we published our on-
course bookmakers ML/TF risk assessment. 
This was the result of engagement with partner 
agencies, feedback and professional insights 
by industry stakeholders, and analysis of 
transaction reports submitted to AUSTRAC. 
The risk assessment identified that the risk 
of criminal exploitation of the on-course 
bookmaking sector has significantly decreased 
since 2008. However, it is likely the sector will 
continue to be exploited for money laundering 
and predicate offence purposes. By publishing 
the risk assessment, AUSTRAC advised the sector 
of potential risks and compliance obligations, to 
increase the quality and quantity of suspicious 
matter reports (SMRs) submitted to us. 


27  / 150
SUPERANNUATION SECTOR
In December 2018 we also released guidance 
to inform Australia’s superannuation sector 
of potential risks they may face from criminal 
exploitation. The guidance focuses on specific 
risks and potential scenarios relating to ML/
TF and serious financial crime specific to the 
sector. It also gives examples of methods these 
organisations can use to mitigate the risks, and 
how they can proactively combat financial crime. 
The new guidance is the latest in our suite 
of sector-specific guidance to identify and 
address ML/TF vulnerability in the industry. 
While the superannuation sector is not 
traditionally associated with financial crime 
exploitation, our assessments show there is a 
higher than perceived risk. It is important that 
the sector understands these risks, so they 
can combat potential threats. 
Based on the risk assessment’s preliminary 
findings regarding significant non-enrolment 
in the sector, AUSTRAC subsequently 
conducted an enrolment campaign. This 
increased enrolment numbers in the sector 
from 257 to 293 by 30 June 2019.

TRAVELLER’S CHEQUES 
In September 2018 we published an assessment 
of the ML/TF risks associated with traveller’s 
cheques. The assessment will help businesses 
that provide traveller’s cheque services to 
identify and manage the ML/TF risks they face. 
The purchase of traveller’s cheques is likely 
to be vulnerable to ML risk, as customers can 
buy traveller’s cheques using cash. The very 
significant reduction in recent years in the 
number of outlets in Australia where traveller’s 
cheques can be purchased, has reduced this 
risk. The decline in demand for traveller’s 
cheques comes as the uptake of travel money 
cards, or stored value cards, increases. These 
cards have many features that make them a 
more attractive way of funding travel activity 
than traveller’s cheques. However, they are 
also highly vulnerable to criminal misuse.
AUSTRAC will continue to release information 
to inform industry about the ML/TF risks they 
may face, with a mutual banking sector ML/TF 
risk assessment scheduled to be published in early 
2019-20. Funding was announced in late 2018 for 
AUSTRAC, with the assistance of the Fintel Alliance, 
to undertake a series of targeted risk assessments 
on the banking, gambling and remittance 
sectors. These will be developed with industry 
over the next three years. The funding enables 
the establishment of a focused risk assessment 
program to provide greater identification of risks 
and insights into the financial industry. It has 
already increased our capacity to manage the 
consultation and data collection activities needed 
to produce meaningful ML/TF risk assessments 
for target sectors.

Memoranda of 
understanding

AUSTRAC takes the utmost care and 
responsibility in ensuring the security of 
our data and information. We are bound by 
privacy and other disclosure provisions that 
ensure data is collected, stored and shared 
appropriately. Sharing data and intelligence 
is, however, critical to the global fight against 
money laundering, terrorism financing and 
other serious crimes. 
Memoranda of understanding (MOUs) enable 
us to exchange financial intelligence and 
regulatory information with our overseas 
counterparts, while governing the access and 
use of the information exchanged. MOUs are 
vital to our ability to understand the broader 
environment and effectively combat ML/TF 
and other financial crimes.





In 2018-19 we continued to increase the 
span of our formalised information-sharing 
relationships, with five new MOUs signed. Two 
of these were domestic, with the Australian 
Charities and Not-for-profits Commission and 
the ACT Gambling and Racing Commission. 
Three were with international partners: the 
Seychelles and Saudi Arabia to exchange 
financial intelligence; and our United States 
counterpart, the Financial Crimes Enforcement 
Network, to exchange regulatory intelligence.

International technical 
assistance and training

AUSTRAC’s international technical assistance 
and training programs are delivered to financial 
intelligence units (FIUs) and anti-money 
laundering and counter-terrorism financing 
(AML/CTF) regulators. Our programs strengthen 
the institutional capacity and governance of 
recipients, and facilitate improved compliance 
with international standards. 
Through sharing our knowledge, skills and 
experience in implementing international 
best practice, we improve domestic and 
regional cooperation. This enhances 
the exchange of intelligence between 
partners and strengthens our relationships 
with counterpart FIUs and domestic and 
international AML/CTF stakeholders. 
In 2018-19 we continued to deliver technical 
assistance and training programs to regional 
partners including Indonesia, the Philippines 
and Papua New Guinea. We also provide a 
suite of training and operational engagement 
activities in collaboration with South-East Asian 
partners (see pages 34-35).
New AUSTRAC website


AUSTRAC’s website is our primary channel to 
inform reporting entities of their compliance 
obligations and how to build their resilience 
against criminal exploitation. Through our 
website, entities can access enrolment and 
registration forms, check their legislative 
obligations, find detailed information on the 
Anti-Money Laundering and Counter-Terrorism 
Financing Act 2006 (AML/CTF Act) and AML/
CTF Rules, and industry-specific guidance about 
threats, risks and vulnerabilities. We also publish 
information about upcoming events that 
generate knowledge transfer and networking 
opportunities for reporting entities. 
In 2018-19 we consulted 32 reporting entities 
and industry bodies to redesign our website 
and ensure content is user-centred and high 
quality. We also evaluated website analytics, 
interviewed our Contact Centre staff and 
held workshops with internal stakeholders to 
inform the redesign. In addition to addressing 
users’ feedback, the new website uses plain 
English to suit all audiences, complies with the 
government’s Digital Service Standard, offers 
mobile responsiveness and adaptability, and has 
improved accessibility with a strong governance 
structure. The new AUSTRAC website will be 
available from the beginning of 2019-20.
OUR PERFORMANCE


/  AUSTRAC ANNUAL REPORT 2018-19
Enhancing our 
Contact Centre
The AUSTRAC Contact Centre assists internal 
and external stakeholders with all facets of AML/
CTF legislation and obligations. In 2018-19 we 
commenced a program of work to upgrade 
our Contact Centre, focusing on areas where 
inefficiency gaps were identified. 
The Contact Centre is a key channel through 
which we engage with the public, partner 
agencies and reporting entities. In 2018-19 we 
handled 23,166 enquiries. As part of ongoing 
improvements, we will analyse operations and 
functionality to determine how existing Contact 
Centre training and technology can be enhanced 
and the user experience improved. 



As part of the upgrade we reviewed the training 
provided to Contact Centre staff, to ensure new 
staff in the Contact Centre have a high level of 
confidence when starting out. The review of the 
training resulted in the development of a five-
week theory and practical training package 
with a staggered approach, incorporating 
subject matter experts from across AUSTRAC. 
The improvements to this training package 
will add value to AUSTRAC stakeholders and 
regulated entities in the long term.
Other improvements to be rolled out in 2019-20 as 
part of the Contact Centre upgrade include new 
quality and timeliness benchmarks. There will also 
be a transition to an improved interactive voice 
response method to allow phone enquiries to be 
more easily directed to relevant subject matter 
experts in AUSTRAC, streamlining the customer 
experience and alleviating call wait times.

AUSTRAC analyses financial transaction 
reports and data to produce client-focussed, 
actionable intelligence for use by our broad 
range of partners. By developing and sharing 
our intelligence products, we contribute our 
expertise and insights to domestic partner 
agencies and international counterpart FIUs. 
This establishes a more complete, shared 
picture of vulnerabilities and crime across 
financial systems.














Beyond data and intelligence sharing, 
AUSTRAC plays an important role in 
establishing and maintaining relationships 
and building capabilities among our 
counterpart FIUs. These relationships are 
key to our ability to assist with improving 
compliance with international standards, 
and develop a more universal understanding 
of vulnerabilities and criminal abuse in 
regional and international financial systems. 
With the assistance of agencies including 
the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade 
we have pursued a range of educational 
and developmental programs to achieve this.

Financial intelligence 

Monitoring our intelligence products allows 
us to understand the volume of products we 
generate, as well as how our intelligence is 
being shared and used, and by whom. Being 
aware of how our intelligence is being used 
to inform partner agencies and support them 
in their work, is critical to our ability to produce 
fit-for-purpose, valuable intelligence. 
We introduced a new analytical tool to allow 
our analysts to conduct more complex analysis 
of larger data sets and improve triaging of 
incoming reports. As a result, we can identify 
more complex networks and activities, and 
produce higher quality and more complex 
intelligence products. 



While the number of reports produced 
in 2018-19 is lower than the previous year, 
these reports are of a higher quality and more 
sophisticated and better targeted at the needs 
of our partners than those produced in 2017-18. 
The value of our intelligence products can also 
be demonstrated by the number of requests 
for information we receive from our partners. 
In 2018-19, AUSTRAC received 708 requests, 
with the Australian Federal Police (AFP), the 
Department of Home Affairs and the ATO 
among those submitting the most requests.

Analyst Workbench 
project
Analyst Workbench is a suite of tools used 
by AUSTRAC for real-time analytics and 
actionable intelligence for our agency. The 
suite is planned to be shared with our partner 
agencies and trusted industry partners over 
time. Analyst Workbench has transformed 
our analytics capabilities in both technology 
offerings and business/partnership models and 
will reduce manual work processes over time. 
Analyst Workbench tools allow our analysts 
to conduct more complex analysis on larger 
data sets, faster than was possible in our old 
systems. This has led to significant efficiencies 
for AUSTRAC’s intelligence capability. Using 
the Analyst Workbench triage application, 
our analysts identified 316 alert detections 
for further assessment, between its launch 
in March 2019 and 30 June 2019.
Another focus for 2018-19 was commencing 
the rollout of the Analyst Workbench Financial 
Forensics tool to partner agencies. The ATO 
is the first agency to pilot the service, as the 
largest user of AUSTRAC data (with over 1,300 
users). The first of the ATO pilot users will 
transition to the system in early 2019-20. 
Financial Intelligence 
Analyst Course
AUSTRAC’s Financial Intelligence Analyst 
Course (FIAC) is a globally innovative course 
that builds high-quality financial intelligence 
analyst skills, capability and tradecraft to 
prevent, detect and disrupt financial crime 
and terrorism financing. At the same time, it 
enhances participants’ knowledge about the 
financial and criminal environments in which 
they work. FIAC provides a world-first baseline 
and common financial intelligence definition 
and language, alongside consistent financial 
analytical approaches. 
A unique feature of FIAC is the different 
perspectives and insights of money 
laundering, serious and organised crime, 
and terrorism financing threats and risks, 
delivered by international experts from 
industry, academia and law enforcement 
agencies. FIAC is a key response to the Fintel 
Alliance’s plan to develop a shared approach 
to building skills, capability and tradecraft to 
prevent, discover, understand and disrupt 
financial crime.
Since Charles Sturt University accredited FIAC 
in February 2017, the course has hosted 327 
personnel from 29 agencies, departments 
and industry (banks), domestically and 
internationally. In 2018-19, 165 personnel 
participated in six courses. FIAC has been 
expanded to include a second and more 
advanced module, which has been delivered 
since September 2018. 
OUR PERFORMANCE


/  AUSTRAC ANNUAL REPORT 2018-19



In cooperation with the Department of Foreign 
Affairs and Trade, AUSTRAC designed and 
delivered FIAC to our international partners, 
creating a regional FIAC. This was based on the 
original FIAC design and tailored, with valuable 
input from all the FIUs of the Association of 
Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN). Two courses 
have been delivered to 10 of our ASEAN 
partners, with the most recent course delivered 
in Manilla, the Philippines, in September 2018. 
Feedback from each course and attendee 
is collected, consolidated and analysed, to 
continuously improve and ensure content 
stays meaningful and relevant to the evolving 
environment of financial intelligence. The 
overwhelmingly positive feedback from 
participants of FIAC and the regional FIAC has 
highlighted the invaluable new relationships 
formed, cooperation, collaboration and a 
better understanding of other FIUs’ capabilities. 
Past FIAC participants have also remarked 
on how much they learnt across intelligence 
fundamentals, financial intelligence 
methodologies, and the organised crime and 
terrorist groups operating in the region, as well 
as new and ever-evolving digital technology 
and cryptocurrencies.
Multilateral exchange 
programs
Analyst exchange programs give AUSTRAC 
the opportunity to collaborate with our 
regional partners. This increases the level of 
proactive analysis and information exchange 
between participating jurisdictions, through 
spontaneous disclosures, and strengthens 
operational cooperation.
INDONESIA
AUSTRAC’s strong partnership with 
Indonesia’s PPATK was a continued focus in 
2018-19. More than 40 key activities were 
delivered in partnership with PPATK in 2018 
alone. AUSTRAC’s deployed representatives 
in Jakarta collaborated with teams in-country 
and regionally to develop, design and deliver 
on new innovations in the international 
partnership space.
The first-ever quadrilateral analyst exchange 
program with Indonesia, Malaysia and the 
Philippines was held in 2018. This activity built 
on the analyst exchange concept that was 
first rolled out in Jakarta in 2013. It continues 
to provide operational outcomes derived 
from close collaboration and increasing trust 
between FIUs in our region.
A three-month secondment to the 
Fintel Alliance was another first for the 
PPATK-AUSTRAC partnership. Two PPATK 
representatives worked with us and our 
partners on live cases, where for the first time, 
AUSTRAC and PPATK entrusted each other with 
exchanges on the most sensitive target lists. 


35  / 150
THE PHILIPPINES
In the Philippines, AUSTRAC works closely 
with our counterpart agency, the Anti-Money 
Laundering Council (AMLC). The final part 
of the AMLC–AUSTRAC Partnership Program 
was delivered in 2018-19. Funded by the 
Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade, this 
program delivered notable outcomes including:
•	
‘Intelligence Fundamentals’ training 
delivered to all AMLC analysts, and 
analysts from relevant partner agencies, 
ensuring standard baseline skills
•	
operational outcomes from a multilateral 
analyst exchange, which focused on 
terrorism financing 
•	
enhanced preparation for the Philippines’ 
mutual evaluation by the Financial 
Action Task Force
•	
development of a strategy to increase 
engagement and registration among 
certain sectors
•	
support with identification of 
information technology solutions.
MALAYSIA
In April and May 2019, AUSTRAC led the 
second multilateral analyst exchange 
program in Kuala Lumpur. This initiative 
brought together representatives from 
nine ASEAN members—Brunei, Cambodia, 
Lao PDR, Indonesia, Malaysia, Myanmar, 
Philippines, Singapore and Thailand—
and New Zealand. 
These ‘analyst hubbing’ exercises, like the 
regional FIAC, represent an outcome of the 
CTF Conference, held in Sydney in March 
2018 on the sidelines of the ASEAN-Australia 
Special Summit (as reported on in 2017-18). 
In addition to improved relations and 
capability uplift across the region, 
benefits for AUSTRAC include a better 
understanding of the remittance sector in 
the region, and increased information and 
intelligence exchange. We also developed 
a new appreciation for the regional FIUs’ 
commitment to support common initiatives.

International forums
THE EGMONT GROUP
AUSTRAC hosted and chaired the 25th Egmont 
Plenary in Sydney in September 2018. More 
than 400 delegates from FIUs around the 
globe attended. The Plenary focused on 
public-private partnerships and the work of 
FIUs with law enforcement and prosecutors. 
The Plenary was especially valuable for 
Egmont members in furthering their bilateral 
and multilateral working relationships. 
More than 50 MOUs were signed among 
the jurisdictions and almost 30 bilateral 
engagements agreed, including two new 
MOUs for AUSTRAC (see page 28). 
Since the establishment of the Egmont Group 
in 1995, AUSTRAC has helped the forum to 
mature into an effective platform for members 
to exchange information and experience in the 
global fight against ML/TF and proliferation 
financing, and improve the understanding 
of ML/TF risks among its stakeholders.
COUNTER-TERRORISM 
FINANCING SUMMIT
AUSTRAC co-hosted the fourth CTF Summit 
in November 2018 in Thailand. The Summit 
was jointly hosted by Thailand’s Anti-Money 
Laundering Office in partnership with co-
founding FIUs, AUSTRAC and PPATK. The 
Summit brought together more than 350 
global leaders and specialists in financial 
intelligence from 31 countries. 
This year’s CTF Summit theme was ‘Regional 
Synergies for Regional Solutions’
, which epitomises 
the Summit’s role in bringing together relevant 
parties to deepen their understanding, and 
identify and address gaps in collaboration. The 
CTF Summit gives AUSTRAC the opportunity 
to improve our products and strengthen our 
partnerships, in the interests of understanding 
and ultimately addressing the risks faced 
across the financial system.
FINANCIAL INTELLIGENCE 
CONSULTATIVE GROUP 
The Financial Intelligence Consultative 
Group (FICG) is the operational arm of the 
CTF Summit and comprises Australia, Brunei 
Darussalam, Cambodia, Indonesia, Laos 
PDR, Malaysia, Myanmar, New Zealand, the 
Philippines, Singapore, Thailand and Vietnam. 
Since its establishment, the FICG has evolved 
into a valuable forum for improving the 
understanding of key regional CTF risks, 
and strengthening collaboration on mutually 
agreed transnational crime priorities. Together 
with PPATK AUSTRAC co-chaired the FICG 
meetings in  August and November 2018 
and April 2019.
The FICG facilitates the South East Asia Counter 
Terrorism Financing Working Group (SEACTFWG), 
which was established to provide practical 
mechanisms for regional FIUs to progress 
strategic priorities and coordinate operational 
work to combat regional terrorism financing. In 
2019, the members of the SEACTFWG progressed 
efforts on terrorism financing disruption in the 
South-East Asian region.

INTERNATIONAL 
SUPERVISORS FORUM
AUSTRAC, as current Chair, hosted seven AML/
CTF regulators as part of the International 
Supervisors Forum, in Melbourne in November 
2018. The focus included the identification of 
unregistered businesses, regulation of digital 
currency exchanges and sharing alternative 
approaches to influencing behaviour. 
Interactions between AUSTRAC and these 
regulators has continued through ongoing 
sharing of information to support one another 
in the global effort to fight financial crime. 
GLOBAL SUPERVISORY COLLEGE
In 2018-19 we participated for the first time in 
the Global Supervision College, co-hosted by 
the Australian Prudential Regulation Authority 
and Australian Securities and Investments 
Commission. The College is a forum for 
supervisors from across the globe to meet 
and discuss common issues and themes 
about a particular organisation. 
Regulators including the Financial Industry 
Regulatory Authority (USA), National 
Futures Association (USA), Japan Financial 
Services Agency, and Monetary Authority 
of Singapore also participated. The College 
increased our knowledge of the entity, and 
developed stronger ties with our domestic 
and international regulatory partners.
OTHER INTERNATIONAL FORUMS

In addition to our ongoing participation 
in numerous government and industry 
forums, AUSTRAC also provided leadership to 
international partners in the following meetings.
•	
The Human Trafficking and People 
Smuggling Workshop in Indonesia, 
with PPATK and the Asia/Pacific Group 
on Money Laundering. The workshop 
brought together: enforcement officers 
from Indonesia, Australia, Canada, New 
Zealand, United Kingdom; FIUs from 
most ASEAN countries; the Department 
of Home Affairs; bankers from major 
international banks; and representatives 
from numerous non-government 
organisations working in this area.
•	
The Financial Action Task Force in 
October 2018 and February 2019 
at the Organisation for Economic 
Co-operation and Development’s 
headquarters in Paris France. Then 
in June 2019 at Orlando, Florida.

Task force contributions

AUSTRAC plays an increasingly important 
role in providing intelligence to partners in 
Australia and internationally, through our 
participation on counter-terrorism and law 
enforcement task forces. Our participation 
provides us with the opportunity to provide 
valuable, actionable intelligence and more 
effectively engage with our partners to share 
information and to disrupt serious crimes. 
Since joining the National Intelligence 
Community in December 2018, we have 
increasingly sought to align our intelligence 
products to whole-of-government priorities 
on national security, serious organised and 
financial crime.
SUPPORTING NATIONAL AND 
STATE-BASED TASK FORCES
During 2018-19 we provided specialist financial 
intelligence to help combat serious criminal 
activity, including ML/TF, organised crime 
and tax evasion, through 53 multi-agency 
collaborations. In a task force environment 
we support operational outcomes and identify 
opportunities to disrupt financial crime. We 
do this by bringing the capabilities of each 
agency together with our specialist financial 
intelligence capabilities. 
AUSTRAC is an active member and contributor to 
national priority criminal task forces, focused on: 
outlaw motorcycle gangs; methylamphetamine, 
fentanyl and other illicit drugs; combating child 
exploitation; and illicit firearms. 
We also contribute to national economic 
disruption task forces, including: the Serious 
Financial Crime Taskforce to address serious 
tax evasion and international facilitation; 
Black Economy Standing Taskforce; Illicit 
Tobacco Taskforce; and the Phoenix Taskforce 
focusing on illegal business rebirthing. 
AUSTRAC supports a number of Australian 
Government lead programs focused on fraud 
and the exploitation of Commonwealth 
welfare and assistance programs. In addition, 
AUSTRAC was a member of the Fraud and 
Anti-Corruption Centre overseen by the AFP 
to lead national efforts to target fraudulent 
and corrupt activity. 
OUR PERFORMANCE


/  AUSTRAC ANNUAL REPORT 2018-19
AUSTRAC’s task force collaborations are diverse, with a focus on embedding financial intelligence to 
identify and disrupt crime. In 2018-19 we produced more than 130 intelligence products to support 
various task forces in response to a broad range of crimes.

JOINT AGENCY TASK FORCE—
MONEY LAUNDERING
In addition to lending our expertise and 
intelligence to established task forces, AUSTRAC 
intelligence is also able to initiate investigations 
into serious financial crimes. Following our 
identification of a suspected international 
money laundering syndicate, a joint agency 
task force was established with AUSTRAC, AFP, 
Australian Border Force and Western Australia 
Police, to identify the source of the deposited 
funds and disrupt the money laundering. 
A total of 163 bank transactions were made, 
estimated to be worth $29.5 million, with 10 
arrests by the task force, on money laundering 
and drug charges. AUSTRAC’s financial 
intelligence and expertise were pivotal in 
helping law enforcement understand the 
syndicate’s sophisticated money laundering 
methodologies and identifying new suspects 
throughout the investigation.
International footprint
In addition to our work with multilateral 
bodies, we continued to expand our 
international footprint in 2018-19. Our staff 
deployed overseas complement our existing 
networks to foster closer financial intelligence 
collaboration, increase information sharing 
and generate intelligence leads for domestic 
and international partners to disrupt terrorist 
groups and organised crime. As at 30 June 
2019, AUSTRAC has: 

•	
two officers located with our FIU 
counterpart PPATK, in Jakarta, Indonesia 
•	
an officer in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia, to 
deepen multilateral cooperation across 
the region
•	
an officer at the Philippines’ FIU, AMLC, 
in Manila
•	
an officer in Guangzhou, China, to 
enhance relationships with Chinese 
financial intelligence and regulatory 
counterparts
•	
officers in Washington DC, USA, and 
London, United Kingdom, to deepen 
our partnerships in those jurisdictions.

In 2018-19 our internationally deployed 
staff undertook a wide range of activities 
to build greater regional and international 
collaboration on terrorism financing and 
financial intelligence. These included delivering 
training and education initiatives in Malaysia 
and the Philippines (see page 34-35) and 
fostering AUSTRAC’s relationships with 
Chinese counterparts and Hong Kong’s Joint 
FIU, to identify areas of future collaboration. 
While these deployments represent 
opportunities to enhance information sharing, 
they also enable both parties to learn from 
one another, collaborate and develop best 
practices across AML/CTF and FIU operations 
more broadly.

Corporate plan 2018-
22, p17.

AUSTRAC acknowledges the importance 
of minimising the impost on regulated entities, 
and maximising regulatory efficiencies, in 
performing our regulatory functions. We 
undertake a range of regulatory activities that 
do not constitute a compliance assessment, 
but still provide us with assurance about the 
entity, and influence the entity’s level 
of compliance. 
We work in partnership with our key 
stakeholders to prevent serious financial 
crime and ML/TF risks. This involves regular 
engagement with industry to improve 
collaboration, compliance and reporting. We 
actively engage our reporting entities through 
workshops, email campaigns and one-on-one 
engagement. In addition to engaging with 
industry partners, we work closely with the 
Department of Home Affairs to look at policy 
and legislative reforms to the AML/CTF regime.










Publishing our approach 
to regulation 
We take a collaborative approach to our 
regulatory role. We recognise that reporting 
entities are our partners and play a critical 
role in building resilience across the financial 
system. In October 2018 we published, on our 
website, our ‘approach to regulation’. It provides 
reporting entities and other stakeholders with 
useful insights into how we view and fulfil our 
regulatory role, and outlines our commitment 
to collaboration, outcome orientation, efficiency 
and continuous improvement. It also provides 
insight into how we exercise our enforcement 
powers when we identify serious or systemic 
non-compliance, including the factors we take 
into account when choosing an intervention.

Annual compliance report

Under the AML/CTF Act, reporting entities are 
required to lodge a report each year relating 
to their compliance with their obligations. Last 
reporting year we collaborated with industry 
to redesign the annual AML/CTF compliance 
report. This was to improve the value of 
information received from reporting entities 
and reduce the associated costs and effort for 
reporting entities and AUSTRAC. 
The previous version of the compliance 
report was based on PDF format, but is now 
provided in a more user-friendly online version. 
Industry engagement on the new report 
included workshops, surveys and one-on-one 
interactions. This was valuable as it provided us 
with a better understanding of the challenges 
faced by entities in meeting their obligations.

In April 2019 we implemented our new 
regulatory monitoring and alerting capability, 
which analyses our extensive data holdings 
to generate alerts that may indicate non-
compliance with legislation. Alerts are then 
assigned to analysts, who assess and respond 
in accordance with our approach to regulation. 
This new system has been integrated with 
our existing systems and external data, to 
provide analysts with a comprehensive picture 
of potential non-compliance. Combined 
with new policies and procedures, this has 
enabled us to identify and respond to specific 
regulatory issues in a far more efficient manner 
than previously possible. Issues that previously 
took as much as three hours to resolve can 
now be completed in as little as 30 minutes.
Initial alerting profiles focussed on late 
reporting and enrolment by reporting entities, 
as well as issues arising from 2018 compliance 
reports. The new process has been successful 
in allowing us to efficiently achieve regulatory 
outcomes. The range of profiles will be 
expanded in 2019-20 to focus on a wider 
range of regulatory issues.
OUR PERFORMANCE


/  AUSTRAC ANNUAL REPORT 2018-19
Regulatory triage
In addition to enhancements to our 
regulatory monitoring capability, we also 
implemented a new, centralised process 
for responding to non-compliance. This 
allows us to more efficiently make risk-based 
decisions about how to respond to potential 
non-compliance, in a way that is consistent, 
transparent and defensible. 
Under this process, all new reactive regulatory 
matters that involve non-compliance (such 
as referrals, self-disclosures and tip-offs) are 
centrally received, recorded, assessed and 
escalated before being reviewed by a cross-
agency board.
The implementation of this process has 
allowed non-compliance to be handled in 
a more efficient and timely manner. This has 
been important in enabling us to handle the 
increased volumes of self-disclosure reporting 
and other forms of disclosed non-compliance 
since enforcement action taken against the 
Commonwealth Bank of Australia in June 2018.
Legislative reforms 
AUSTRAC continues to work closely with, and 
support, the Department of Home Affairs to 
implement the recommendations from the 
2016 Report on the Statutory Review of the 
Anti-Money Laundering and Counter-Terrorism 
Financing Act 2006 and Associated Rules and 
Regulations. The current phase of legislative 
reforms will improve the framework for accessing 
and sharing AUSTRAC information, deliver 
regulatory efficiencies, align correspondent 
banking requirements with international 
banking practice, and consolidate cross-
border reporting of movements of currency 
and bearer negotiable instruments. 
The next phase is likely to implement 
broader reforms to streamline, simplify 
and strengthen the AML/CTF framework. 
AUSTRAC will contribute as a key stakeholder 
to the Department of Home Affairs-led 
reform process and participate in industry 
engagement. We will also support the 
legislative reform process with risk 
assessments to inform an evidence-based 
approach to policy development and new 
AML/CTF Rules.

AUSTRAC recognises the valuable role that 
regulatory technology (‘RegTech’) and AML 
service providers play in improving the standards 
of reporting entities, and strengthening their 
role as the first line of defence against financial 
crime. Greater compliance from reporting entities 
translates to better reporting and intelligence 
for AUSTRAC and in turn, our domestic and 
international partners’ ability to fight financial 
and other crimes.









Regulatory education 
and outreach 
We engage with the regulated population 
to provide support and understanding of the 
AML/CTF Act. This ensures businesses comply 
with their AML/CTF obligations and are also 
resilient to the AML/CTF threats they may 
face themselves. 
OUR PERFORMANCE


/  AUSTRAC ANNUAL REPORT 2018-19
We tailor education and outreach activities 
to the needs of particular industries to 
enhance their understanding and capability 
to meet requirements. We also seek feedback 
from industry via surveys and workshops, to 
understand their needs and how we can best 
provide the support and education they require. 
Some examples of our regulatory education and 
outreach work in 2018-19 include the following.
•	
As part of our capability to identify 
trends in non-compliance, we 
communicated areas of weakness that 
were particularly vulnerable to financial 
crime, to affected reporting entities. For 
example, following reports of scams 
relying on cryptocurrency ATMs, we 
contacted reporting entities to alert 
them to the scams and how to 
prevent them from being exploited. 
•	
We worked with a number of large 
reporting entities in the remittance, 
gambling and superannuation industries, 
to improve the quality and quantity of 
SMR reporting. This included highlighting 
low reporting volumes occurring in 
comparison to their peers, and the 
areas they are falling short. We also gave 
feedback on the quality of reporting and 
improvements that can be made.
•	
We undertook a campaign to increase 
the enrolment numbers of on-course 
bookmakers, resulting in 36 new 
enrolments. This included an outbound 
call campaign and a presentation to 
Australian Bookmakers Association 
members, to outline the importance 
of meeting AML/CTF obligations.
•	
To raise awareness of SMR reporting, 
we developed our first short animation. 
From November 2018 to the end of the 
reporting year, the animation had more 
than 5,000 views. Given its success, we are 
developing more animations to promote 
the importance of AML/CTF obligations.
•	
AUSTRAC staff presented at a number of 
conferences and forums to promote the 
work we are doing and communicate key 
messages to reporting entities, industry 
associations, regulators and AML service 
providers. This included industry forums 
such as the Australian Superannuation 
Funds Association and various 
conferences that focussed on AML/CTF. 
•	
Following external consultation, 
we changed our policy involving 
the authorisation of external auditors 
under the AML/CTF Act. This allows for 
a more streamlined process when a 
reporting entity is required to appoint 
an external auditor. The new process 
reduces the burden to auditors in 
maintaining authorisation and is 
now only relied upon when AUSTRAC 
decides to direct a reporting entity 
to appoint an external auditor.


47  / 150
Digital currency 
exchange providers 
On 3 April 2018 new AML/CTF requirements 
came into effect for digital currency exchange 
(DCE) providers. We engaged heavily with the 
DCE industry to ensure they are capable of 
meeting their obligations and managing ML/
TF risk. During 2018-19 we provided education 
and engagement activities to support DCE 
providers in establishing mechanisms to 
achieve compliance. 
In August 2018 we facilitated five workshops 
focusing on ML/TF risk assessment, mitigation 
and management. These workshops brought 
together 42 DCE providers to learn about 
important risk management concepts. They 
also provided opportunities for DCE providers 
to share the risks they identified in their 
own businesses and learn from each other. 
Following a survey of DCE providers, risk was 
selected as the key topic identified as needing 
assistance and assessment by AUSTRAC 
to build capability in the industry. 
In addition to the workshops, fact sheets 
were made available to DCE providers to 
help with their ML/TF risk management 
processes. The fact sheets contain insights 
shared by businesses in the workshops, as 
well as information from AUSTRAC intelligence 
and learnings from our regulatory activities, 
to provide real examples of risks and 
suggested controls. A one-hour webinar 
was also provided on our website to help 
DCE providers understand suspicious matter 
reporting and their obligations.
RegTech engagement

In the first half of 2019 we focused on 
engagement with RegTechs whose tools 
can be used to enhance regulatory processes 
and support the reporting population in 
complying with AML/CTF obligations. Since 
March 2019, 47 one-on-one sessions have 
been held with RegTechs across Sydney, 
Melbourne and Brisbane. 
These sessions allow AUSTRAC to understand 
the products under development by the 
RegTechs, and how they will meet the needs 
of our regulated population in understanding 
our legislation and requirements. It also 
provides the opportunity for us to educate the 
RegTechs about AML/CTF legislation, the types 
of industries we regulate and how RegTech 
products can best be adapted to provide 
robust compliance solutions that will meet 
AML/CTF needs.
OUR PERFORMANCE


/  AUSTRAC ANNUAL REPORT 2018-19


In another new initiative, in May 2019 we held 
the inaugural ‘RegTech Collab TechSprint’ with 
the RegTech Association. These are designed to 
present RegTech participants with a problem 
our reporting entities are facing, with the 
goal to build solutions or tools that maximise 
regulatory outcomes and serve user needs. 
This is an opportunity for the RegTechs to 
receive firsthand insight into our expectations 
and hear from our reporting population about 
their needs. The event brought together 
reporting entities across the superannuation, 
remittance, online bookmaking and digital 
currency industries, with both Australian and 
international RegTech providers and AUSTRAC 
staff. We received overwhelmingly positive 
feedback from the reporting entities and 
RegTechs. Given the popularity and high level of 
interest from RegTechs to take part in the event, 
we will hold more TechSprints in the future. 
Serious non-compliance
We adopted a risk-based approach to review 
compliance report responses where a 
reporting entity indicated that they might be 
in breach of their AML/CTF obligations. This 
approach took into account the size of the 
entity, as well as the nature of the potential 
non-compliance. 
Many of the entities we engaged with were 
able to resolve the concerns about potential 
non-compliance. 
As a result of our engagement, entities have 
advised us of steps they are taking to develop 
and adopt an AML/CTF program. This is key 
to ensuring those reporting entities more 
effectively identify, mitigate and manage 
the ML/TF risks they face going forward.
We will undertake further work focusing on 
the results of the 2018 compliance report in 
2019-20, as well as following up with entities 
engaged as part of the process above.

abuse of the financial system.
Evidence of AUSTRAC's 
contribution to 
disrupting criminal 
abuse of the financial 
system.
Corporate plan 
2018-22, p19.
AUSTRAC has compliance, education and 
enforcement tools to disrupt criminal abuse 
of the financial system, while also serving 
to safeguard regulated entities from abuse 
themselves. In addition to the contributions 
made to law enforcement through our 
intelligence products and ongoing 
participation in task forces (see pages 39-41), 
we have our own enforcement powers to 
address serious or systematic non-compliance 
with AML/CTF legislation. We use these powers 
to take action where regulated entities fail to 
protect themselves or the Australian financial 
system from criminal activity.
Enforcement actions 
Under the AML/CTF Act, it is an offence for 
a business to provide designated remittance 
or digital currency exchange services without 
being registered with AUSTRAC. We can refuse, 
cancel or suspend the registration of remittance 
service and digital currency exchange providers 
if they pose an unacceptable risk of ML/TF 
or other serious crimes. 












In 2018-19 we refused the registration of 
two digital currency exchange providers and 
suspended another two due to risks posed 
by serious crime. In addition, we cancelled the 
registration of three remitters and suspended 
one due to ML/TF risks. Registration of remitters 
will continue to be a focus for us in 2019-20, 
with a remitter education campaign to be 
rolled out from August 2019.
During 2018-19 we made reviewable decisions 
concerning remittance service providers: five 
refusals of registration, five cancellations, three 
suspensions and one refusal of renewal.
As part of our supervisory powers, we can issue 
written notices to businesses to appoint an 
external auditor, on suspicion that they had 
contravened, are contravening, or are proposing 
to contravene, the AML/CTF Act, regulations or 
AML/CTF Rules. Following a period of ongoing 
engagement, in June 2019 we ordered Afterpay 
Pty Ltd to appoint an independent external 
auditor. The audit will be used to determine the 
extent of any compliance issues and whether 
further regulatory action concerning Afterpay 
is required.

Evidence of 
strengthening 
the Fintel Alliance.
Corporate plan 
2018-22, p19.

AUSTRAC established the Fintel Alliance in 
March 2017. It is a public-private partnership 
created to develop shared intelligence and 
deliver innovative solutions, contribute to the 
growth of the Australian economy, and help 
protect the Australian financial system from 
criminal abuse. 
Through its Operations Hub, the Fintel Alliance 
produces publicly available intelligence products 
to inform industry, and targeted intelligence 
reports to support investigations by law 
enforcement agencies and task forces. The 
Innovation Hub is also vital to the maturation 
of the Fintel Alliance. It develops improved 
and faster detection capabilities through its 
co-design approach to new and innovative 
products, services, systems and processes. 










The Fintel Alliance is a collaborative structure 
where participating private sector, government 
and law enforcement entities join together 
to confront the challenges of ML/TF criminal 
activities. The Fintel Alliance provides the vehicle 
where operational and tactical intelligence can 
be developed in close to real-time, while at the 
same time developing new ways to lift the cloak 
of darkness that may hinder the identification of 
serious criminal activities.
As such, the Fintel Alliance undertakes 
operations that are core to national intelligence 
priorities, to identify opportunities to deliver 
and present outcomes. This collaborative 
approach creates an environment to develop 
and test risk identification and mitigation 
programs, which deliver operational outcomes 
leading to new insights. 


51  / 150
Expansion of the 
Fintel Alliance
In its second full year of operation, we focused 
on expanding and maturing the Fintel Alliance. 
In 2018-19, the Fintel Alliance partnership 
increased from 18 to 25 members spanning 
Australian and international government and 
private sector organisations. AUSTRAC takes 
a measured approach to how we expand 
the Fintel Alliance partnership. New partners 
are invited to join where they fill a gap in 
intelligence objectives, or add a particular 
value to the existing membership cohort.
There were significant increases in the 
products delivered from 2017-18 to 2018-19. 
This demonstrates the continued demand and 
relevance of the Fintel Alliance intelligence and 
products for intelligence and law enforcement 
activities. It also displays a maturing of the 
Fintel Alliance in its ability to produce more 
than double its output in only its second full 
year of operation. 



While the Fintel Alliance delivered an 
increased number of intelligence products 
in 2018-19, interventions and operational 
outcomes may not be realised in the same 
financial year. This is shown by the decrease 
in the number of interventions in the table 
below. This number can also fluctuate based 
on the type of outcomes—for example, 
a large number (approximately 2,500) of 
incidents were recorded in 2017-18 as the 
result of a credit card operation, compared 
to 16 more complex interventions related 
to child exploitation in 2018-19.

With our Fintel Alliance partners, AUSTRAC 
continued to disrupt the ability of criminal 
networks including the recruitment of money 
mules and outlaw motorcycle gangs, and 
harden the financial sector to identify and 
disrupt child sexual exploitation. The Fintel 
Alliance operations are intelligence-gathering 
and dissemination exercises that support law 
enforcement investigations and task forces, and 
the detection and disruption of serious crime. 

The Fintel Alliance contribution to task forces 
has increased from 2017-18 to 2018-19, 
particularly concerning operations responding 
to regional and community harms, including 
localised crime, detection of scams, and child 
exploitation materials. The Fintel Alliance’s work 
in detecting and disrupting child exploitation 
is profiled below.


53  / 150
Child exploitation
Through the Fintel Alliance, we provide advice 
to the financial industry to help them identify 
and report suspicious activity that may unveil 
payments for child exploitation. The Fintel 
Alliance analyses financial transactions to 
identify Australians sending small payments 
offshore for the purchase of live-distance 
child abuse material. Analysis includes 
examining traditional international transfers, 
remittance payments and transactions made 
through other payment service providers.
Enhanced financial intelligence identified 
a 52-year-old Australian man conducting 
financial activity consistent with the purchase 
of child exploitation material from another 
country. With the support of this financial 
intelligence, the AFP identified and charged 
the man with child exploitation offences 
including grooming and procuring a child 
to engage in sexual activity. The man was 
sentenced to seven years imprisonment and 
will be on the Sex Offenders Registry for life. 


The collaboration of public-private participants 
through the Fintel Alliance, and the development 
of financial methodologies used, has seen 
a significant increase in reports received by 
AUSTRAC identifying suspicious activity related 
to child exploitation. This increase in intelligence 
collection has resulted in more than 40 referrals 
to law enforcement agencies, producing 
outcomes including the interception and arrest 
of a number of offenders. The Fintel Alliance 
has also supported international investigations 
by providing financial intelligence through 
transactions of interest to partner countries 
such as Indonesia and the Philippines. 
In 2018-19, Fintel Alliance representatives 
attended and presented their work to 
international groups, including the Asia Pacific 
Financial Coalition against Child Pornography 
in the Philippines and Australia. The Fintel Alliance 
work was further shared through an invitation 
from the French Police Attaché to present at 
the Regional Seminar on the Fight Against Child 
Sexual Exploitation, in Singapore, the Fintel 
Alliance also engaged with the Philippines-
Australia Investigator Exchange Program 
Leadership visit to Australia on 20 June 2019.
The outcomes from the operations this 
year showcase the ongoing necessity and 
effectiveness of the Fintel Alliance in the fight 
against financial crime. As the Fintel Alliance 
continues to mature, AUSTRAC and industry 
hope to contribute to more operations, support 
government initiatives and protect Australians. 
OUR PERFORMANCE


/  AUSTRAC ANNUAL REPORT 2018-19
Continued innovation 
by the Fintel Alliance
The ‘Alerting Project’ is a core Fintel Alliance 
Innovation Hub initiative, to improve detection 
of financial crime through the development 
of new systems, processes and skill sets. The 
project will enable the discovery of financial 
crime risks that only become visible by joining 
disparate and distributed data sources from 
multiple reporting entities. The long-term goal 
is to enable real-time detection and alerting of 
criminal activities, using a secure system that 
supports privacy-preserving data matching 
and machine learning. 
The project progressed in 2018-19 with ongoing 
work between AUSTRAC and the Fintel Alliance 
partners in developing and executing proof-of-
concepts, as well as research and development 
activities with the Australian National University 
and CSIRO’s Data61.
AUSTRAC and the Fintel Alliance derived 
valuable lessons from project work undertaken 
in the past year. Work will continue with the Fintel 
Alliance and other project partners, to build the 
necessary capabilities and technologies to deliver 
the alerting platform in future years.
OVERALL ANALYSIS 
OF PERFORMANCE
2018-19 was an important year for AUSTRAC. 
We continued to enhance our regulatory 
capability and develop client-focused, 
actionable intelligence to support our 
purpose, as well as the outcomes of our 
public and private partners. 
We remained committed to improving 
and sharing our high-quality data and 
technological capabilities with our partners, 
to continue to derive mutually beneficial 
outcomes. We pursued new and innovative 
ways to partner with government and 
private partners, like CSIRO, Australian 
National University and the Fintel Alliance, 
to uncover new insights. By investing in our 
technological capabilities and working with 
partners, we continued to identify new risks 
and actively share advice on mitigating these 
risks, through channels such as our website, 
industry guidance and risk assessments.
Through our strong collaborative network 
of domestic and international partners, we 
heavily contributed to the development of 
a more informed, shared understanding of 
our environment and the threats financial 
crime poses to the community. Using this 
knowledge, we contributed our expertise 
to numerous task forces and international 
forums, and disseminated intelligence 
products to detect and disrupt criminal 
activities including illicit drugs, firearms 
and serious and organised crime. 


55  / 150
Joining the National Intelligence Community and 
Home Affairs portfolio solidified the relevance 
and impact of our work in contributing to 
whole-of-government priorities. This is also 
demonstrated by the diverse and far reach of 
our intelligence and engagement efforts across 
Australia, the region and the globe. 
As AUSTRAC’s presence becomes more relevant 
to our domestic and international partners, 
we are conscious of the need to continue to 
support the source of our intelligence—our 
reporting entities and other private sector 
partners—and strengthen their abilities to 
identify and mitigate the risks they face. 
Through our regulatory function, we continue 
to drive legislative reform and streamline 
processes to help our regulated population to 
better understand their obligations. We have 
also generated positive outcomes through 
our education and engagement work with 
regulated entities, as demonstrated by the 
high compliance reporting rate (95 per cent 
of entities) and feedback received on activities 
like our RegTech events, DCE workshops and 
published guidance materials. 
Collaboration with partners is critical to 
our ability to disrupt criminal activity. 
Our valuable intelligence enables law 
enforcement agencies and task forces 
to detect and disrupt criminal activities, 
including serious and organised criminal 
syndicates related to child exploitation 
and outlaw motorcycle gangs. 
Operations with our Fintel Alliance partners 
continued to provide us with enhanced 
capabilities to disrupt, intervene and counteract 
crimes and threats to Australia’s interests. We 
also exercised our own enforcement powers 
to deter and respond to non-compliance, and 
ensure entities are complying with their AML/
CTF obligations and playing their part 
in mitigating risk in the financial system. 
Overall, our achievements throughout 2018-19 
supported our strong performance against 
the criteria in our 2018-22 corporate plan 
and the high-level criterion in the 2018-19 
PBS. We will continue to build on our 
successes to ensure we deliver outcomes 
that build resilience and protect the Australian 
community from financial crime.

Fraud and risk
AUSTRAC’s fraud and corruption control 
framework complies with the requirements 
of section 10 of the Public Governance, 
Performance and Accountability Rule 2014, 
and the Commonwealth Fraud Control Policy. 
Our fraud prevention, detection, investigation, 
reporting and data collection procedures and 
processes align with the requirements of the 
Commonwealth Fraud Control Framework 2017. 
We have taken reasonable measures to 
minimise the incidence of fraud within 
the agency and to investigate and recover 
the proceeds of fraud against the agency. In 
partnership with our internal audit provider, 
AUSTRAC developed a revised fraud and 
corruption control plan in 2019. It outlines 
the roles, responsibilities and processes 
AUSTRAC has in place with respect to fraud 
and corruption, as well as the critical roles that 
all AUSTRAC staff have in managing potential, 
perceived and actual fraud and corruption 
risks. This work identified 10 recommendations 
for improving our fraud and corruption control 
posture that will be progressed in 2019-20.
Integrity framework
As Australia’s anti-money laundering and 
counter-terrorism financing regulator and 
specialist financial intelligence unit, AUSTRAC’s 
integrity is vital in maintaining the confidence 
of the Australian public, partner agencies and 
international partners. AUSTRAC continually 
improves our tailored integrity framework to 
ensure it supports an honest, professional and fair 
workforce that embodies the Australian Public 
Service (APS) Values and Code of Conduct. 
In 2017 we partnered with the Australian 
Commission for Law Enforcement Integrity 
(ACLEI) on a self-assessment of the development 
of AUSTRAC’s integrity maturity. ACLEI published 
the resulting report on its website on 9 July 2018. 
The work represented a collaborative effort to 
develop a new methodology for the assessment 
of AUSTRAC’s corruption risk environment. The 
report has resulted in the formulation of an 
action plan to further strengthen the agency’s 
fraud and corruption detection and resilience.

considered included: emerging privacy trends 
and issues; AUSTRAC’s standard operating 
procedure for managing notifiable data breaches; 
and the proof-of-concept for money laundering 
and terrorism financing alerting process.

MANAGEMENT AND ACCOUNTABILITY
Planning and 
performance reporting
Each year, AUSTRAC considers its strategic 
direction and key initiatives for the years ahead 
through the development of our corporate plan. 
The plan articulates our purpose, performance 
measures and the key short- and medium-term 
initiatives we will deliver to build our capabilities 
in regulation, intelligence, data and analytics 
and our people.
The initiatives are developed as part of our 
annual internal planning process and the 
development of branch plans. Each branch 
plan considers its business-as-usual work, risks 
and delivery of key projects, in line with the 
pillars of our strategic direction.
This ensures agency work is conducted with 
clear line of sight to our purpose, and whole-
of agency performance can be monitored 
and reported. Regular branch reports align to 
the requirements of the annual performance 
statement and provide assurance to the 
Governance Committee of the progress 
against branch plans and the corporate 
plan performance measures.



In 2018-19, AUSTRAC undertook to mature 
the agency’s planning capabilities, to enable 
us to deliver on longer term outcomes, 
capability resourcing and sustainability. 
We have strengthened our processes and 
documentation by taking a more integrated 
approach to planning, performance reporting 
and budget setting. This work will progress 
into the future, through the collocation of 
these functions in a new branch that will 
further integrate capital investment planning 
with capability delivery and project and 
performance reporting. 
Internal audit
As the accountable authority, the AUSTRAC CEO 
relies on the agency’s internal audit function to 
provide assurance that the agency’s financial 
and operational controls are efficient, effective, 
economical and ethical. By undertaking regular 
reviews and providing recommendations, 
the internal audits performed contribute 
to improving AUSTRAC’s performance.
Our Audit, Integrity and Risk team works with 
the Governance Committee to prepare the 
annual audit plan, in which assurance activities 
are focused on key risk areas for AUSTRAC. Audit 
reports and updates are submitted to the Audit 
and Risk Committee to provide independent, 
objective assessments on arrangements in 
place to manage risks across the agency.


/  AUSTRAC ANNUAL REPORT 2018-19
Finance law compliance

During 2018-19 AUSTRAC did not identify 
any significant issues relating to non-
compliance with the finance law. As such 
the accountable authority did not report 
to the responsible Minister any serious non-
compliance as required by paragraph 19(1)
(e) of the Public Governance, Performance 
and Accountability Act 2013.
EXTERNAL SCRUTINY
In 2018-19, the AUSTRAC CEO reported on the 
agency’s operations to the Minister for Home 
Affairs and for the period 1 July 2018 to 28 
August 2018 the Minister for Law Enforcement 
and Cyber Security. In addition, AUSTRAC’s 
transparency and accountability to Parliament 
includes responding to questions on notice, 
publishing information required by Senate 
Orders, and appearing before Parliamentary 
Committees when required. During 2018–19 
AUSTRAC did not appear before any 
Parliamentary Committees.
In 2018–19 there were no judicial decisions, 
decisions of administrative tribunals, or 
decisions by the Australian Information 
Commissioner that had a significant impact 
on AUSTRAC’s operations.
There were no reports on AUSTRAC’s operations 
given by the Auditor-General, a Parliamentary 
Committee, or the Commonwealth Ombudsman. 
There were no capability reviews of the agency.
ASSET MANAGEMENT
Asset management is not a significant part 
of AUSTRAC’s activities. However, in 2018-
19 AUSTRAC commenced development of 
a 10-year capital management plan to be 
delivered early in 2019-20. This will enhance 
decision making in relation to the ongoing 
management of AUSTRAC’s asset base.

PURCHASING
The PGPA Act governs AUSTRAC’s use of 
Commonwealth resources and expenditure 
of public money. The Commonwealth 
Procurement Rules are applied when procuring 
goods and services, including consultancies.
Our Procurement and Contracts team 
provides strategic advice to agency staff on 
procurement and establishing contracts that 
support the agency’s purpose and strategic 
priorities, and which are consistent with 
legislative obligations and Commonwealth 
Government procurement policies.
An annual procurement plan is published 
on AusTender, which is reviewed and updated 
as required. Information about expenditure 
on contracts and consultancies is available 
on the AusTender website.

CONSULTANTS AND CONTRACTS
During 2018-19, three new consultancy contracts were entered into involving total actual expenditure 
of $145,435.25. In addition, two ongoing consultancy contracts were active during the period,

defined reviews or assessments—for example, analysing a specific issue, or providing independent 
advice, information or solutions to assist in decision making.
Decisions to engage consultants in 2018–19 were made in accordance with the PGPA Act, Commonwealth 
Procurement Rules and relevant internal policies.
During 2018–19 AUSTRAC did not exempt any contracts valued at more than $10,000 (GST inclusive) 
from publication on AusTender.

(GST inclusive)
•	
	
motivating competitive participation 
by using standard documentation 
and conditions
•	
	
ensuring offers are clear, in plain English 
and accessible.
AUSTRAC recognises the importance of 
ensuring that small businesses are paid on 
time. The results of the Survey of Australian 
Government Payments to Small Business 
are available on Treasury’s website, 
www.treasury.gov.au.

FREEDOM OF INFORMATION
Entities subject to the Freedom of Information Act 1982 (FOI Act) are required to publish information to 
the public as part of the Information Publication Scheme (IPS). This requirement is in Part II of the FOI 
Act and has replaced the former requirement to publish a ‘section 8’ statement in an annual report. 
Each agency must display on its website a plan showing what information it publishes in accordance 
with the IPS requirements.
AUSTRAC’s IPS plan is at www.austrac.gov.au/about-us/corporate-information-and-governance/

PERFORMANCE
We are committed to meeting our obligations 
under the Environment Protection and Biodiversity 
Conservation Act 1999. We continually improve 
our environmental performance and 
sustainable business practices. Our green 
office principles help to reduce the impact 
of AUSTRAC’s ecological footprint, including:
•	
	
conserving energy and water use
•	
	
reducing office consumables and waste
•	
	
maximising reusable resources
•	
	
increasing opportunities for recycling
•	
	
avoiding purchase and use of

MANAGING 
AND DEVELOPING 
EMPLOYEES
In 2018-19 104 employees were recruited 
to AUSTRAC. Of these:
•	
84 are ongoing
•	
14 are non-ongoing
•	
6 are temporary transfers
•	
70 came from other government 
departments/agencies.

There were 52 employees who left AUSTRAC. 
Of these:
•	
45 were ongoing
•	
7 were non-ongoing
•	
40 left the Australian Public Service (APS)
•	
12 transferred within the APS or to a 
Commonwealth non-APS employer.

Our attrition rate in 2018-19 was 13.3 per cent, 
compared with 23 per cent in 2017-18. 
AUSTRAC 
Enterprise Agreement


The AUSTRAC Enterprise Agreement 2016-2019, 
covering all non-Senior Executive Service (SES) 
AUSTRAC employees, was due to expire in 
March 2019. At the end of 2018, AUSTRAC staff 
were asked to consider the following options: 
1.	 bargaining for a new agreement, 
developed in accordance with the 
APS Workplace Bargaining Policy 2018
2.	 a determination under subsection 
24(1) of the Public Service Act 1999, 
as an alternative to a new enterprise 
agreement. 
Sixty-seven per cent of AUSTRAC employees 
responded to these options through a survey 
issued to all staff. Of those, 90.27 per cent were 
in favour of the subsection 24(1) determination.
As a result, the AUSTRAC CEO made a subsection 
24(1) determination. This included supplementing 
the AUSTRAC Enterprise Agreement 2016-2019 
to provide agency-wide remuneration increases 
during the period 2019-21.


/  AUSTRAC ANNUAL REPORT 2018-19
Executive remuneration
The terms and conditions of employment 
for AUSTRAC’s SES are established under 
subsection 24(1) of the Public Service 
Act 1999, and outlined in the respective 
employee’s determination. The majority of 
employment conditions are similar to those 
set out in AUSTRAC’s Enterprise Agreement 
and comply with the APS Executive 
Remuneration Policy.
In 2018-19, AUSTRAC implemented an ‘SES 
Remuneration Policy’ to ensure a more consistent 
approach in determining SES remuneration. 
As at 30 June 2019, such determinations were 
in operation for 11 SES employees. 
AUSTRAC benchmarks SES remuneration 
against the annual APS remuneration surveys. 
The AUSTRAC CEO is responsible for setting 
the appropriate remuneration for SES employees 
upon engagement, move or promotion. The 
CEO also reviews SES salaries regularly to ensure 
SES base salaries remain competitive. 
SES base salary generally increases in line with 
those that apply to non-SES employees. This 
is in accordance with the agency’s enterprise 
agreement or other applicable mechanisms, 
such as an agency wide subsection 24(1) 
determination. No incentive payments were 
made to SES employees during 2018-19. 
Employment conditions
The terms and conditions of employment for 
AUSTRAC’s non-SES employees are governed by 
the AUSTRAC Enterprise Agreement 2016-2019. 
This remains in force under the subsection 24(1) 
determination, but can be varied through a 
written individual flexibility arrangement (IFA).
The AUSTRAC IFA policy outlines the underlying 
principles whereby an IFA may be established. 
It also sets out the approval process and 
governance of IFAs. AUSTRAC’s Governance 
Committee approves IFAs, and these are 
reviewed annually to ensure they continue 
to support AUSTRAC’s operational requirements.
At 30 June 2019 there were 34 IFAs in effect 
and they related to salary or leave arrangements. 

No incentive payments were made to staff 
during the reporting period.
No AUSTRAC employees were covered 
by common law contracts in 2018-19. 
Performance pay was also not applicable.

MANAGEMENT OF HUMAN RESOURCES
We work together 
as one AUSTRAC 
and have high 
expectations 
of ourselves 
and others. We 
embrace change 
and collaborate 
internally and with 
our partners 
to serve the 
community.
We are 
transparent
 and accountable 
for our actions. 
We are honest 
and consistent, 
which builds trust 
and earns 
us credibility.
We empower 
our people 
to share new 
ideas without 
fear. This 
empowerment 
upholds our high 
performing 
reputation 
across the 
community and 
with our partners.
We are innovative, 
flexible and 
embrace new 
ideas. We are bold 
enough to take 
risks and test new 
ideas to solve 
problems, but we 
are never reckless.
We recognise 
and celebrate our 
differences.  We 
embrace diversity 
and are respected 
for it. People are 
our strength, 
we care for and 
support 
each other.


/  AUSTRAC ANNUAL REPORT 2018-19
OUR CULTURE

In 2018-19 AUSTRAC staff worked together to 
develop a new culture statement. Our approach 
to culture is underpinned by our ‘One AUSTRAC’ 
philosophy that recognises we are stronger 
together than we are as individuals. 
This means we are:

TRUSTED
We are a trusted leader and partner 
and are widely respected for our expertise 
in financial intelligence and regulation. 
FOCUSSED
We are individually and collectively responsible 
for delivering AUSTRAC’s purpose and realising 
our vision. We are committed and set out to 
complete what we start.

COURAGEOUS 
We foster growth and self-development. 
We have the right tools to support an 
innovative and flexible workplace. Our 
environment encourages curiosity and 
courage. We take measured risks in pursuit 
of our purpose of fighting financial crime.
DISABILITY REPORTING 
MECHANISM
Since 1994, non-corporate Commonwealth 
entities have reported on their performance as 
policy adviser, purchaser, employer, regulator 
and provider under the Commonwealth 
Disability Strategy. In 2007–08, reporting on the 
employer role was transferred to the Australian 
Public Service Commission’s State of the Service 
reports and the APS Statistical Bulletin. These 
reports are available at www.apsc.gov.au. From 
2010–11, entities have no longer been required 
to report on these functions.
The Commonwealth Disability Strategy 
has been overtaken by the National Disability 
Strategy 2010–2020, which sets out a 10-year 
national policy framework to improve the lives 
of people with disability, promote participation 
and create a more inclusive society.
A high-level, two-yearly report will track 
progress against each of the six outcome 
areas of the strategy and present a picture of 
how people with disability are faring. The first 
of these progress reports was published in 
2014, and can be found at www.dss.gov.au.
AUSTRAC also has in place a ‘Workplace 
diversity and inclusion program 2019-23’. 
Which sets out our objectives and goals over 
the next four years as we continue to cultivate 
an organisational culture where all voices are 
heard, respected, and valued.


73  / 150
TRAINING AND 
DEVELOPMENT
AUSTRAC continued investing in building 
the capability of our people in 2018-19. A 
strong focus was placed on strengthening 
leadership and management capabilities. 
Forty-six staff at the APS 6 to Executive Level 
(EL) 2 levels, as well as six SES, participated 
in identified leadership programs, including 
programs offered by the Australian Public 
Service Commission and Australian Institute of 
Police Management. Developing core agency 
capabilities and skills also remained a priority, 
with 180 staff members accessing more than 
80 different external training opportunities. 
Initiatives were developed and implemented 
to streamline and optimise processes related 
to on boarding, capability mapping, studies 
assistance, management of external training 
requests, and improved communication for 
upcoming development opportunities. 
AUSTRAC continued to offer customisable 
development opportunities through our 
online learning platform, Learnhub. This allows 
bookings for face-to-face programs and access to 
e-learning programs and learning tools, including 
Lynda.com. Development of e-learning programs 
continued, with new modules released for risk 
and health, safety and wellbeing. Development 
and release of additional e-learning compliance 
modules will continue in 2019-20.
MANAGEMENT OF HUMAN RESOURCES
Development of a program of required training 
for all staff is underway. The first two training 
sessions, for security and privacy awareness, 
were delivered during 2018-19.
Mentoring continued to be supported through 
our in-house six month mentoring program, 
which saw participation double in 2018-19 to 
24 mentoring pairs. 
Our Studies Assistance Program supports 
employees to access external professional 
development opportunities. This continued 
to grow, with 36 employees accessing studies 
assistance in 2018-19.
Our Financial Intelligence Analyst Course 
(FIAC) aims to build high quality analyst 
skills, capability and tradecraft, to prevent, 
detect and disrupt financial crime. In 2018-
19 five FIACs were offered domestically 
to 91 staff and 71 external partner agency 
employees. Regional FIACs were expanded 
to four programs during 2018-19, hosted 
in Indonesia, the Philippines and Brunei.


WORK HEALTH 
AND SAFETY
AUSTRAC is committed to fostering a positive 
safety and wellbeing culture, and ensuring the 
health and safety of our employees, contractors, 
visitors, and anyone who may be affected by 
our operations. We ensure we comply with the 
Work Health and Safety Act 2011 (WHS Act) and 
the Safety, Rehabilitation and Compensation 
Act 1988, through the following.
•	
Prevention—providing and maintaining 
a healthy and safe working environment, 
and preventing work-related injury 
or illness, by adopting a proactive 
risk management approach to WHS 
as an integral part of overall business 
operations.
•	
Injury management—reducing the 
personal, organisational and financial 
costs of both compensable and non-
compensable injuries and illnesses, 
through active early intervention 
and return-to-work programs.
•	
Wellbeing initiatives—providing 
programs to enhance the physical and 
mental wellbeing of our employees, 
improve engagement and promote 
a culture of proactive wellness.




There was one notifiable WHS incident 
reported to Comcare in 2018-19.
In 2018-19 AUSTRAC did not have any:
•	
WHS investigations by Comcare
•	
compensation claims accepted 
by Comcare
•	
improvement notices issued by Health 
and Safety Representatives (section 90 
of the WHS Act)
•	
improvement notices issued by 
Comcare (section 191 of the WHS Act)
•	
non-disturbance notices issued by 
Comcare (section 198 of the WHS Act).
AUSTRAC’s Comcare premium for 2018-19 was 
0.26 per cent of payroll, well below the overall 
scheme rate of 1.23 per cent.

REPORT ON 
FINANCIAL  
PERFORMANCE
96


97  / 150
A copy of AUSTRAC’s audited financial 
statements and the Auditor-General’s report 
are included in the annual report.
Our financial statements have been prepared 
on an accrual basis in accordance with the 
Financial Reporting Rule and Australian 
Accounting Standards. As in previous years, 
the Statement of Comprehensive Income 
relates to items of revenue and expenses 
where we are directly responsible for their 
administration and management.
In 2018–19 we produced a net operating loss 
of $5.4 million, compared with a net operating 
surplus of $2.2 million in 2017–18. The net 
operating loss includes $5.4 million of unfunded 
depreciation and amortisation expenses.
Total revenue for 2018–19 was $76.3 million: 
a $6.3 million increase over the previous year.
Our financial position at 30 June 2019 is 
shown in the Statement of Financial Position. 
This takes into account movements in assets, 
liabilities and equity. Total equity has increased 
to $35.0 million (2017–18: $30.3 million).
Events occurring after 
balance date
No significant events occurred after balance 
date that would have an effect on our ongoing 
structure and financial activities.
Legal Services 
expenditure
The total expenditure on legal services for 
the financial year ended 30 June 2019 was 
$1,988,138 (exclusive of GST). In accordance 
with Office of Services Coordination reporting 
requirements, this includes the cost of 
providing internal and external legal services.
$736,696 (exclusive of GST) was spent 
on purchasing external legal services.
$1,251,442 (exclusive of GST) was spent 
on purchasing internal legal services.

INDEPENDENT AUDITOR’S REPORT
To the Minister for Home Affairs
Opinion 
In my opinion, the financial statements of the Australian Transaction Reports and Analysis Centre for 
the year ended 30 June 2019:
(a) comply with Australian Accounting Standards – Reduced Disclosure Requirements and the Public 
Governance, Performance and Accountability (Financial Reporting) Rule 2015; and
(b) present fairly the financial position of the Australian Transaction Reports and Analysis Centre as at 
30 June 2019 and its financial performance and cash flows for the year then ended.
The financial statements of the Australian Transaction Reports and Analysis Centre, which I have 
audited, comprise the following statements as at 30 June 2019 and for the year then ended: 
•
Statement by the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Finance Officer;
•
Statement of Comprehensive Income;
•
Statement of Financial Position; 
•
Statement of Changes in Equity; 
•
Cash Flow Statement;
•
Administered Schedule of Comprehensive Income;
•
Administered Schedule of Assets and Liabilities;
•
Administered Reconciliation Schedule; and 
•
Notes to the financial statements, comprising a Summary of Significant Accounting Policies and 
other explanatory information.
Basis for opinion
I conducted my audit in accordance with the Australian National Audit Office Auditing Standards, which 
incorporate the Australian Auditing Standards. My responsibilities under those standards are further 
described in the Auditor’s Responsibilities for the Audit of the Financial Statements section of my report. 
I am independent of the Australian Transaction Reports and Analysis Centre in accordance with the 
relevant ethical requirements for financial statement audits conducted by the Auditor-General and his 
delegates. These include the relevant independence requirements of the Accounting Professional and 
Ethical Standards Board’s APES 110 Code of Ethics for Professional Accountants (the Code) to the 
extent that they are not in conflict with the Auditor-General Act 1997. I have also fulfilled my other 
responsibilities in accordance with the Code. I believe that the audit evidence I have obtained is 
sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for my opinion.
Accountable Authority’s responsibility for the financial statements
As the Accountable Authority of the Australian Transaction Reports and Analysis Centre the Chief 
Executive Officer is responsible under the Public Governance, Performance and Accountability Act 
2013 for the preparation and fair presentation of annual financial statements that comply with Australian 
Accounting Standards – Reduced Disclosure Requirements and the rules made under that Act. The 
Chief Executive Officer is also responsible for such internal control as the Chief Executive Officer
determines is necessary to enable the preparation and fair presentation of financial statements that are 
free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error. 
In preparing the financial statements, the Chief Executive Officer is responsible for assessing the 
Australian Transaction Reports and Analysis Centre’s ability to continue as a going concern, taking into 
account whether the Australian Transaction Reports and Analysis Centre’s operations will cease as a
FINANCIAL STATEMENTS


/  AUSTRAC ANNUAL REPORT 2018-19
result of an administrative restructure or for any other reason. The Chief Executive Officer is also 
responsible for disclosing, as applicable, matters related to going concern and using the going concern 
basis of accounting unless the assessment indicates that it is not appropriate.
Auditor’s responsibilities for the audit of the financial statements 
My objective is to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements as a whole are 
free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error, and to issue an auditor’s report that 
includes my opinion. Reasonable assurance is a high level of assurance, but is not a guarantee that an 
audit conducted in accordance with the Australian National Audit Office Auditing Standards will always 
detect a material misstatement when it exists. Misstatements can arise from fraud or error and are 
considered material if, individually or in the aggregate, they could reasonably be expected to influence 
the economic decisions of users taken on the basis of the financial statements.
As part of an audit in accordance with the Australian National Audit Office Auditing Standards, I exercise 
professional judgement and maintain professional scepticism throughout the audit. I also: 
•
identify and assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to 
fraud or error, design and perform audit procedures responsive to those risks, and obtain audit 
evidence that is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for my opinion. The risk of not detecting 
a material misstatement resulting from fraud is higher than for one resulting from error, as fraud may 
involve collusion, forgery, intentional omissions, misrepresentations, or the override of internal 
control; 
•
obtain an understanding of internal control relevant to the audit in order to design audit procedures 
that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the 
effectiveness of the entity’s internal control;
•
evaluate the appropriateness of accounting policies used and the reasonableness of accounting 
estimates and related disclosures made by the Chief Executive Officer; 
•
conclude on the appropriateness of the Chief Executive Officer’s use of the going concern basis of
accounting and, based on the audit evidence obtained, whether a material uncertainty exists related 
to events or conditions that may cast significant doubt on the Australian Transaction Reports and 
Analysis Centre’s ability to continue as a going concern. If I conclude that a material uncertainty 
exists, I am required to draw attention in my auditor’s report to the related disclosures in the financial 
statements or, if such disclosures are inadequate, to modify my opinion. My conclusions are based 
on the audit evidence obtained up to the date of my auditor’s report. However, future events or 
conditions may cause the Australian Transaction Reports and Analysis Centre to cease to continue 
as a going concern; and 
•
evaluate the overall presentation, structure and content of the financial statements, including the 
disclosures, and whether the financial statements represent the underlying transactions and events 
in a manner that achieves fair presentation. 
I communicate with those charged with governance regarding, among other matters, the planned scope 
and timing of the audit and significant audit findings, including any significant deficiencies in internal 
control that I identify during my audit.

Budget Variances Commentary
Statement of  Comprehensive Income
The variance in suppliers expenses is mainly due to:
- a higher than expected utilisation of contractors and consultants to implement IT projects and investigative work on business units
- unbudgeted travel services
- higher than budgeted training services
- additional IT maintenance contracts with suppliers.
As a result, supplier expenses were higher than expected.
The variance in depreciation is due to timing changes for completion of work in progress assets. Project timelines were extended for 
certain assets, which affected the dates on which those assets were ready for use.
The variance in own-source income rendering of services is due to higher than budgeted receipts from partner agencies requesting 
additional services from AUSTRAC, and new services unknown at budget setting time.

STATEMENT OF FINANCIAL POSITION
as at 30 June 2019
Budget Variances Commentary
Statement of  Financial Position
The variance in trade and other receivables mainly relates to appropriations receivable retained at year-end due to delays in 
capital projects that were in initiation stage and not capitalisable. Also reserves of Act 1 appropriations retained were 
$5.000 million more than in 2018.
The variance in intangibles is due to the delays in capital projects.
The variance in suppliers is in line with the overall increase in supplier expenditure.
The variance in other payables is due to the reporting of the lease liability attached to the lease incentive for office fitout consistent 
with last year.

Accounting Policy
Administered Cash Transfers to and from the Official Public Account
Administered revenue collected by AUSTRAC is for use by the Government. 
Collections are transferred to the Official Public Account (OPA) maintained by the Department of Finance. Conversely, cash is drawn
from the OPA to make payments under Parliamentary appropriation on behalf of Government.
These transfers to and from the OPA are adjustments to the administered cash held by AUSTRAC on behalf of the Government and 
and are reported as such in the schedule of administered cash flows.

OVERVIEW 
Objectives of AUSTRAC 
The Australian Transaction Reports and Analysis Centre (AUSTRAC) is a non-corporate Commonwealth entity, 
controlled by the Australian Government. 
AUSTRAC is Australia's financial intelligence unit and anti-money laundering and counter-terrorism financing (AML/CTF) 
regulator. AUSTRAC’s purpose is to build resilience in the financial system and use financial intelligence and regulation 
to disrupt money laundering, terrorism financing and other serious crime. 
AUSTRAC is structured to the following outcome: The protection of the financial system from criminal abuse through 
actionable financial intelligence and collaboration with domestic and international partners. 
AUSTRAC activities contributing toward this outcome are classified as either departmental or administered. 
Departmental activities involve the use of assets, liabilities, income and expenses controlled or incurred by AUSTRAC in 
its own right. Administered activities involve the management or oversight by AUSTRAC, on behalf of the Government, 
of items controlled or incurred by the Government. 
Basis of Preparation of the Financial Statements 
The financial statements are general purpose financial statements and are required by section 42 of the Public 
Governance, Performance and Accountability Act 2013 (PGPA Act). 
The financial statements have been prepared in accordance with: 
a) the Public Governance, Performance and Accountability (Financial Reporting) Rule 2015 (FRR); and
b) Australian Accounting Standards – Reduced Disclosure Requirements issued by the Australian Accounting 
Standards Board (AASB) that apply for the reporting period. 
The financial statements have been prepared on an accrual basis and in accordance with the historical cost convention, 
except for certain assets and liabilities at fair value. Except where stated, no allowance is made for the effect of changing 
prices on the results or the financial position. 
The financial statements are presented in Australian dollars and values are rounded to the nearest thousand dollars 
unless otherwise specified. 
Unless an alternative treatment is specifically required by an accounting standard or the FRR, assets and liabilities are 
recognised in the balance sheet when and only when it is probable that future economic benefits will flow to AUSTRAC 
or a future sacrifice of economic benefits will be required and the amounts of the assets or liabilities can be reliably 
measured. Liabilities and assets that are unrecognised are reported in the schedule of commitments or the schedule of 
contingencies. 
Unless alternative treatment is specifically required by an accounting standard, income and expenses are recognised in 
the Statement of Comprehensive Income when and only when the flow, consumption or loss of economic benefits has 
occurred and can be reliably measured. 
Recognition of Revenue 
Amounts appropriated for departmental appropriations for the period (adjusted for any formal additions and 
reductions) are recognised as revenue from Government when AUSTRAC gains control of the appropriation. 
Appropriations receivable are recognised at their nominal amounts. 
Funding received from external parties for services to be provided by AUSTRAC is recognised as revenue from rendering 
of services in accordance with AASB 1004 Contributions. For the period ended 30 June 2019, $0.430 million has been 
recognised as revenue for which there is no matching expenditure (2018: $2.263 million). The expenditure associated 
with delivery of the affected programs will be incurred and reported in future accounting periods. 
Resources received free of charge are recognised as revenue when, and only when, a fair value can be reliably 
determined and the services would have been purchased if they had not been donated.  Use of these resources is 
recognised as an expense. 
Significant Accounting Judgements and Estimates 
No accounting assumptions and estimates have been identified that have a significant risk of causing a material 
adjustment to carrying amounts of assets and liabilities within the next accounting period. 
New Australian Accounting Standards 
Adoption of New Australian Accounting Standards Requirements 
There were no new, revised or amended standards and interpretations that were issued prior to the signing of the 
Statement by the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Finance Officer that were applicable to the current reporting period 
and that had a material effect on AUSTRAC’s financial statements. AASB 9 came into effect after 1 July 2018 and has 
been assessed by management as having no material impact on the retrospective year.  The standard has been applied 
for 2019. 
FINANCIAL STATEMENTS


/  AUSTRAC ANNUAL REPORT 2018-19
Future Australian Accounting Standards Requirements 
The following new standards were issued by the AASB prior to the sign-off date, which may have a financial impact 
on AUSTRAC for future reporting periods: 
Accounting Standard 
Application date 
Nature of change 
AASB 15 Revenue 
from contracts 
with customers 
1 July 2019 
For AUSTRAC, AASB 15 becomes mandatory 
for annual reporting periods beginning on or 
after 1 January 2019. The standard uses a 
five-step model to determine revenue 
recognition, which reinstates the principle of 
revenue recognition when a contracted 
performance obligation is satisfied. 
AASB 16 Leases 
1 July 2019 
AUSTRAC expects to apply AASB 16 Leases 
from 2019–20. This Standard will require the 
net present value of payments under most 
operating leases to be recognised as assets 
and liabilities. The application of AASB 16 
will have a material impact on the statement 
of financial position currently estimated at 
$21.323 million in operating lease 
commitments as at 1 July 2019. 
Other new standards or revised standards that were issued prior to the sign-off date and are applicable to future 
reporting periods are not expected to have a future material financial impact. 
Taxation 
AUSTRAC is exempt from all forms of taxation except Fringe Benefits Tax (FBT) and Goods and Services Tax (GST). 
Events after the reporting period  
There were no events occurring after balance date that had a material effect on the Departmental or Administered 
financial statements. 
Budget Variances 
The original budget shown in the financial statements is the budget first presented to Parliament in respect of the 
reporting period. For the year ended 30 June 2019, the budget is contained in AUSTRAC’s 2018-19 Portfolio Budget 
Statements (PBS). Disclosure of budget variances has been made at management discretion. 
Reporting of Administered Activities 
Administered revenues, expenses, assets, liabilities and cash flows are disclosed in the schedule of administered items 
and related notes. 
Except where otherwise stated below, administered items are accounted for on the same basis and using the same 
policies as for departmental items, including the application of Australian Accounting Standards. 
Administered Revenue 
Administered revenues comprise: 
a) industry contribution levies invoiced by AUSTRAC under the Australian Transaction Reports and Analysis Centre 
Industry Contribution (Collections) Act 2011
b) collection of infringement notices issued under the AML/CTF Act by AUSTRAC, and
c) collection of infringement notices issued under the AML/CTF Act by other Australian Government agencies on behalf 
of the Australian Government. 
Revenue from industry contribution levies is stated net of any adjustments due to corrections made by entities to 
enrolment information that should have applied on the census day. Leviable entities may, in certain circumstances, 
apply to the AUSTRAC Chief Executive Officer for a waiver of payment. Where such waiver applications are granted 
(either in full or in part), the amount of the waiver is treated as an expense.

Accounting Policy
Financial assets
Financial assets are classified as loans and receivables and are assessed for impairment at the end of
each reporting period. The classification depends on the nature and purpose of the financial assets
and is determined at the time of initial recognition. Financial assets are recognised and derecognised
upon trade date and are assessed for impairment at the end of each reporting period. AASB 9
classification treatment has not materially changed the impairment of receivables. Under AASB 9
expected credit losses are $0.012 million (2018 Nil).
Loans and Receivables
Where loans and receivables are not subject to concessional treatment, they are carried at amortised 
cost using the effective interest method. Gains and losses due to impairment, derecognition and
amortisation are recognised through the statement of comprehensive income.
Financial assets were assessed for impairment  in accordance with the impairment policy stated below. 
No indicators of impairment were identified at 30 June 2019.

Contractual commitments for the acquisition of property, plant, equipment and intangible assets
Contractual commitments for the acquisition of software maintenance for intangible assets includes $1.000 million (inclusive of GST) over
2 years for a software supplier (2018: $2.200 million inclusive of GST).
1. The carrying amount of intangibles comprises additions of $2.791 million of internally generated software (2018: $3.908 million) and
$0.500 milion of purchased software (2018: $5,551 million).
Intangible assets were assessed for impairment in accordance with the impairment policy stated below. There were no impairments in 2019 
(2018: Nil).
Revaluations of non-financial assets
All revaluations are conducted in accordance with the revalution policy stated below.  Leasehold improvements were not revalued in 2019 
(2018: Nil). Property plant and equipment was not revalued in 2019 (2018: Nil).
FINANCIAL STATEMENTS


/  AUSTRAC ANNUAL REPORT 2018-19
Accounting Policy 
Assets are recorded at cost of acquisition, except where stated below. 
The cost of acquisition includes the fair value of assets transferred in exchange and liabilities undertaken. Financial 
assets are initially measured at their fair value plus transaction costs where appropriate. 
Asset Recognition Threshold 
Purchases of property, plant and equipment are recognised initially at cost in the balance sheet, except for purchases 
costing less than $2,000, which are expensed in the year of acquisition (other than where they form part of a group of 
similar items which are significant in total). 
The initial cost of an asset includes an estimate of the cost of dismantling and removing the item and restoring the site 
on which it is located. This is also relevant to ‘make good’ provisions in property leases taken up by AUSTRAC where 
there exists an obligation to restore the property back to its original condition. These costs are included in the value of 
leasehold improvements with a corresponding recognition of a provision for restoration obligation. 
Revaluations 
Fair values for each class of asset are determined as shown below: 
Asset class 
Fair value measured at 
Leasehold improvements 
Current replacement cost, adjusted for obsolescence 
Property, plant 
and equipment 
Current replacement cost, adjusted for obsolescence 
AUSTRAC has assessed a three year update is appropriate to meet this requirement. 
Following initial recognition at cost, items of property, plant and equipment are carried at fair value less subsequent 
accumulated depreciation and accumulated impairment losses. Independent valuations are conducted with sufficient 
frequency to ensure that the carrying amounts of assets do not differ materially from the assets’ fair values as at the 
reporting date. The frequency of independent valuations is dependent upon the volatility of movements in market 
values for relevant assets. 
The most recent independent valuation was conducted during June 2017. The carrying values of assets were assessed 
by management at 30 June 2019 and no material differences between carrying values and fair values were identified. 
Revaluation adjustments are made on a class basis. Any revaluation increment is credited to equity under the heading 
of asset revaluation reserve except to the extent that it reverses a previous revaluation decrement of the same asset that 
was previously recognised in the surplus/deficit. Revaluation decrements for assets are recognised directly in the 
surplus/deficit except to the extent that they reverse a previous revaluation increment for that asset. 
Any accumulated depreciation as at the revaluation date is eliminated against the gross carrying amount of the asset and 
the asset restated to the revalued amount. Depreciation is recalculated over the remaining estimated useful life of the 
asset on a straight line basis. 
Depreciation 
Depreciable property, plant and equipment assets are written-off to their estimated residual values over their estimated 
useful lives to AUSTRAC using the straight-line method of depreciation. Leasehold improvements are depreciated on a 
straight-line basis over the lesser of the estimated useful life of the improvements or the unexpired period of the lease. 
Depreciation rates (useful lives), residual values and methods are reviewed at each reporting date and necessary 
adjustments are recognised in the current, or current and future reporting periods, as appropriate. 
Depreciation rates applying to each class of depreciable asset are based on the following useful lives: 
Asset class 
2019 
2018 
Leasehold improvements 
Lease term 
Lease term 
Property, plant 
and equipment 
3 to 10 years from date of purchase 
3 to 10 years from date of purchase 
Impairment 
All assets were assessed for indications of impairment at 30 June 2019. Where indications of impairment exist, the 
recoverable amount of an asset is estimated and an impairment adjustment made if the recoverable amount is less 
than the carrying amount. 
The recoverable amount of an asset is the fair market value less costs to sell and its value in use. Value in use is the 
present value of the future cash flows expected to be derived from the asset. 


117  / 150
Derecognition 
An item of property, plant and equipment is derecognised upon disposal or when no further future economic benefits 
are expected from its use. 
Intangibles 
AUSTRAC's intangibles comprise purchased and internally developed software for internal use. These assets are carried 
at cost less accumulated amortisation and accumulated impairment losses. 
Software is amortised on a straight-line basis over its anticipated useful life. The useful lives of AUSTRAC's software are 
1 to 10 years (2017-18: 1 to 10 years). 
All software assets were assessed for indications of impairment as at 30 June 2019.

Liabilities for ‘short-term employee benefits’ (as defined in AASB 119 Employee Benefits) and termination benefits due 
within twelve months of the end of reporting period are measured at their nominal amounts. 
The nominal amount is calculated with regard to the rates expected to be paid on settlement of the liability. 
Other long-term employee benefits are measured as the net total of the present value of the defined benefit obligation at 
the end of the reporting period. 
Leave 
The liability for employee benefits includes provisions for annual leave and long service leave. No provision has been 
made for sick leave as all sick leave is non-vesting and the average sick leave taken in future years by employees of 
AUSTRAC is estimated to be less than the annual entitlement for sick leave. 
The leave liabilities are calculated on the basis of employees’ remuneration at the estimated salary rates that will be 
applied at the time the leave is taken, including AUSTRAC’s employer superannuation contribution rates and other 
employee benefits to the extent that the leave is likely to be taken during service rather than paid out on termination. 
Leave provisions are disclosed as being settled in more than 12 months as AUSTRAC does not expect all leave for all 
employees to be used wholly within 12 months of the end of the reporting period. 
The liability for long service leave is the present value of employee entitlements based on the Australian Government 
shorthand method as per the FRR. The estimate of the present value of the liability takes into account attrition rates and 
pay increases through promotion and inflation. 
Superannuation 
The majority of AUSTRAC's staff are members of the Commonwealth Superannuation Scheme (CSS), the Public Sector 
Superannuation Scheme (PSS) or the PSS accumulation plan (PSSap). A small number of staff are members of employee 
nominated superannuation funds, as allowed under AUSTRAC's enterprise agreement. 
The CSS and PSS are defined benefit schemes for the Australian Government. The PSSap and other employee nominated 
superannuation funds are defined contribution schemes. 
The liability for defined benefits is recognised in the financial statements of the Australian Government and is settled by 
the Australian Government in due course. This liability is reported by the Department of Finance administered 
schedules and notes. 
AUSTRAC makes employer contributions to the employees' superannuation scheme at rates determined by an actuary 
to be sufficient to meet the current cost to the Government. AUSTRAC accounts for the contributions as if they were 
contributions to defined contribution plans. 
The liability for superannuation recognised as at 30 June 2019 represents outstanding contributions for the final 
fortnight of the year.

The total number of key management personnel included in the above table is 4 (2018: 6 including part year arrangements).
Key management personnel are those persons having authority and responsibility for planning, directing and controlling the activities of 
AUSTRAC, directly or indirectly. AUSTRAC has determined the key management personnel to be the Minister for Home Affairs, the 
Minister for Law Enforcement and Cyber Security, the Chief Executive Officer and the three Deputy Chief Executive Officers.
Key management personnel remuneration is reported in the table below.  Remuneration excludes the remuneration and other benefits of 
the Minister for Home Affairs and the Minister for Law Enforcement and Cyber Security.  The Ministers' remuneration and other benefits 
are set by the Remuneration Tribunal and are not paid by AUSTRAC.

The following transactions with related parties occurred during the financial year: 
4.3 Related Party Disclosures
AUSTRAC is an Australian Government controlled entity. Related parties to AUSTRAC are Key Management Personnel, including the Portfolio 
Minister and Executive, and other Australian Government entities.
Given the breadth of Government activities, related parties may transact with the government sector in the same capacity as ordinary 
citizens. Such transactions include the payment or refund of taxes, receipt of a Medicare rebate or higher education loans. These transactions 
have not been separately disclosed in this note.
No key management personnel (KMP) have entered into any related party transactions with AUSTRAC and there are no contracts 
involving key management personnel interests existing at year end.
AUSTRAC transacts with other Australian Government controlled entities consistent with normal day-to-day business operations 
provided under normal terms and conditions, including the payment of workers compensation, insurance premiums, vetting and legal 
services. 
AUSTRAC transacts with other Australian Government controlled entities for the provision of fee based services to or on behalf of 
those entities. Such services are provided under normal terms and conditions and are not considered individually significant to 
warrant separate disclosure as related party transactions.

5. Managing Uncertainties
This section describes how AUSTRAC manages financial risks within its operating environment.
Significant Remote Contingencies
There are no departmental or administered remote contingencies as at 30 June 2019 (2018: Nil).
5.1 Contingent assets and liabilities
Quantifiable contingencies
There are no departmental or administered quantifiable contingencies as at 30 June 2019 (2018: Nil). 
Unquantifiable contingencies
There are no departmental unquantifiable contingencies as at 30 June 2019  (2018: Nil).
AUSTRAC has one administered unquantifiable matter subject to litigation through the Administrative Appeals 
Tribunal. The matter involves a reporting entity’s dispute of their 2018-19 levy invoice. AUSTRAC is defending 
the matter. At the date of this report, AUSTRAC does not consider the outcome of this matter likely to have a 
significant effect on its operations or financial position.
Accounting policy
Contingent liabilities and contingent assets are not recognised in the Statement of Financial Position but are 
reported in this note. They may arise from uncertainty as to the existence of a liability or asset or represent an 
asset or liability in respect of which the amount cannot be reliably measured. Contingent assets are disclosed 
when settlement is probable but not virtually certain and contingent liabilities are disclosed when settlement is 
greater than remote.
Significant accounting judgements and estimates
No accounting assumptions or estimates relating to contingencies have been identified that have a significant 
risk of causing a material adjustment to carrying amounts of assets and liabilities within the next reporting 
period.

Accounting Policy 
Financial assets 
With the implementation of AASB 9 Financial Instruments for the first time in 2019, AUSTRAC classifies its financial assets at 
amortised cost. 
Financial assets are recognised when the entity becomes a party to the contract and, as a consequence, has a legal right to 
receive or a legal obligation to pay cash and derecognised when the contractual rights to the cash flows from the financial 
asset expire or are transferred upon trade date.  
Comparatives have not been restated on initial application. 
Financial Assets at Amortised Cost 
Financial assets included in this category are held in order to collect the contractual cash flows and the cash flows are solely 
payments of principal and interest (SPPI) on the principal outstanding amount. 
Amortised cost is determined using the effective interest method. 
Impairment of Financial Assets 
Financial assets are assessed for impairment at the end of each reporting period based on Expected Credit Losses. 
The simplified approach for trade receivables is used. This approach always measures the loss allowance as the amount equal 
to the lifetime expected credit losses. 
A write-off constitutes a derecognition event where the write-off directly reduces the gross carrying amount of the financial 
asset. 
Financial liabilities 
Financial liabilities are recognised and derecognised upon ‘trade date’. 
Financial Liabilities at Amortised Cost 
Financial liabilities are initially measured at fair value, net of transaction costs.  These liabilities are subsequently measured at 
amortised cost using the effective interest method, with interest expense recognised on an effective interest basis.  
Liabilities are recognised to the extent that the goods or services have been received (and irrespective of having been 
invoiced).
