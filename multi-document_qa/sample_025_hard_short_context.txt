CHAPTER 7:
AI POLICY AND  
NATIONAL STRATEGIES
Overview
OVERVIEW
AI is set to shape global competitiveness over the coming decades, promising 
to grant early adopters a significant economic and strategic advantage. To 
date, national governments and regional and intergovernmental organizations 
have raced to put in place AI-targeted policies to maximize the promise of the 
technology while also addressing its social and ethical implications. 
This chapter navigates the landscape of AI policymaking and tracks efforts taking 
place on the local, national, and international levels to help promote and govern AI 
technologies. It begins with an overview of national and regional AI strategies and 
then reviews activities on the intergovernmental level. The chapter then takes a 
closer look at public investment in AI in the United States as well as how legislative 
bodies, central banks, and nongovernmental organizations are responding to the 
growing need to institute a policy framework for AI technologies.

In 2020, Global Partners Digital and Stanford’s 
Global Digital Policy Incubator published a 
report examining governments’ national AI 
strategies from a human rights perspective, 
titled “National Artificial Intelligence Strategies 
and Human Rights: A Review.” The report 
assesses the extent to which governments 
and regional organizations have incorporated 
human rights considerations into their national 
AI strategies and made recommendations to 
policymakers looking to develop or review AI 
strategies in the future. 
The report found that among the 30 states and 
two regional strategies (from the European 
Union and the Nordic-Baltic states), a number 
of strategies refer to the impact of AI on human 
rights, with the right to privacy as the most 
commonly mentioned, followed by equality 
and nondiscrimination (Table 6.1.1). However, 
very few strategy documents provide deep 
analysis or concrete assessment of the impact 
of AI applications on human rights. Specifics 
as to how and the depth to which human 
rights should be protected in the context of 
AI is largely missing, in contrast to the level of 
specificity on other issues such as economic 
competitiveness and innovation advantage.

Given the scale of the opportunities and the challenges 
presented by AI, a number of international efforts have 
recently been announced that aim to develop multilateral 
AI strategies. This section provides an overview of those 
international initiatives from governments committed to 
working together to support the development of AI for all. 
These multilateral initiatives on AI suggest that 
organizations are taking a variety of approaches to 
tackle the practical applications of AI and scale those 
solutions for maximum global impact. Many countries 
turn to international organizations for global AI norm 
formulation, while others engage in partnerships or 
bilateral agreements. Among the topics under discussion, 
the ethics of AI—or the ethical challenges raised by current 
and future applications of AI—stands out as a particular 
focus area for intergovernmental efforts. 
Countries such as Japan, South Korea, the United 
Kingdom, the United States, and members of the European 
Union are active participants of intergovernmental 
efforts on AI. A major AI powerhouse, China, on the other 
hand, has opted to engage in a number of science and 
technology bilateral agreements that stress cooperation 
on AI as part of the Digital Silk Road under the Belt 
and Road (BRI) initiative framework. For example, AI is 
mentioned in China’s economic cooperation under the BRI 
Initiative with the United Arab Emirates. 
INTERGOVERNMENTAL 
INITIATIVES 
Intergovernmental working groups consist of experts and 
policymakers from member states who study and report 
on the most urgent challenges related to developing and 
deploying AI and then make recommendations based on 
their findings. These groups are instrumental in identifying 
and developing strategies for the most pressing issues in AI 
technologies and their applications.

BILATERAL AGREEMENTS
Bilateral agreements focusing on AI are another form 
of international collaboration that has been gaining in 
popularity in recent years. AI is usually included in the 
broader context of collaborating on the development of 
digital economies, though India stands apart for investing 
in developing multiple bilateral agreements specifically 
geared toward AI.
India and United Arab Emirates
Invest India and the UAE Ministry of Artificial Intelligence 
signed a memorandum of understanding in July 2018 
to collaborate on fostering innovative AI ecosystems 
and other policy concerns related to AI. Two countries 
will convene a working committee aimed at increasing 
investment in AI startups and research activities in 
partnership with the private sector.
India and Germany
It was reported in October 2019 that India and Germany 
likely will sign an agreement including partnerships on the 
use of artificial intelligence (especially in farming).
United States and United Kingdom
The U.S. and the U.K. announced a declaration in 
September 2020, through the Special Relationship 
Economic Working Group, that the two countries will 
enter into a bilateral dialogue on advancing AI in line with 
shared democratic values and further cooperation in AI 
R&D efforts.
India and Japan
India and Japan were said to have finalized an agreement 
in October 2020 that focuses on collaborating on digital 
technologies, including 5G and AI. 
French and Germany
France and Germany signed a road map for a Franco-
German Research and Innovation Network on artificial 
intelligence as part of the Declaration of Toulouse 
in October 2019 to advance European efforts in the 
development and application of AI, taking into account 
ethical guidelines.

FEDERAL BUDGET FOR  
NON-DEFENSE AI R&D 
In September 2019, the White House 
National Science and Technology Council 
released a report attempting to total 
up all public-sector AI R&D funding, the 
first time such a figure was published. 
This funding is to be disbursed as grants 
for government laboratories or research 
universities or in the form of government 
contracts. These federal budget figures, 
however, do not include substantial AI 
R&D investments by the Department of 
Defense (DOD) and the intelligence sector, 
as they were withheld from publication for 
national security reasons. 
As shown in Figure 7.3.1, federal civilian 
agencies—those agencies that are not part 
of the DOD or the intelligence sector—
allocated USD 973.5 million to AI R&D 
for FY 2020, a figure that rose to USD 1.1 
billion once congressional appropriations 
and transfers were factored in. For FY 
2021, federal civilian agencies budgeted 
USD 1.5 billion, which is almost 55% 
higher than its 2020 request.

Figure 7.3.2
U.S. DEPARTMENT OF DEFENSE AI 
R&D BUDGET REQUEST 
While the official DOD budget is not publicly available, 
Bloomberg Government has analyzed the department’s 
publicly available budget request for research, 
development, test, and evaluation (RDT&E)— data that 
sheds light on its spending on AI R&D. 
With 305 unclassified DOD R&D programs specifying the use 
of AI or ML technologies, the combined U.S. military budget 
for AI R&D in FY 2021 is USD 5.0 billion (Figure 7.3.2). This 
figure appears consistent with the USD 5.0 billion enacted 
the previous year. However, the FY 2021 figure reflects 
a budget request, rather than a final enacted budget. 
As noted above, once congressional appropriations are 
factored in, the true level of funding available to DOD AI R&D 
programs in FY 2021 may rise substantially.
The top five projects set to receive the highest amount of 
AI R&D investment in FY 2021: 
• 
Rapid Capability Development and Maturation, by the 
U.S. Army (USD 284.2 million)
• 
Counter WMD Technologies and Capabilities 
Development, by the DOD Threat Reduction Agency 
(USD 265.2 million) 
• 
Algorithmic Warfare Cross-Functional Team (Project 
Maven), by the Office of the Secretary of Defense (USD 
250.1 million) 
• 
Joint Artificial Intelligence Center (JAIC), by the Defense 
Information Systems Agency (USD 132.1 million)
• 
High Performance Computing Modernization Program, 
by the U.S. Army (USD 99.6 million)
In addition, the Defense Advanced Research Projects 
Agency (DARPA) alone is investing USD 568.4 million in AI 
R&D, an increase of USD 82 million from FY 2020.
CHAPTER 7:

7.3 U.S. PUBLIC 
INVESTMENT 
IN AI
Important data caveat: This chart illustrates the challenge of working with contemporary government data sources 
to understand spending on AI. By one measure—the requests that include AI-relevant keywords—the DOD is requesting 
more than USD 5 billion for AI-specific research development in 2021 . However, DOD’s own accounting produces a 
radically smaller number: USD 841 million. This relates to the issue of defining where an AI system ends and another 
system begins; for instance, an initiative that uses AI for drones may also count hardware-related expenditures for the 
drones within its “AI” budget request, though the AI software component will be much smaller.

CHAPTER 7 PREVIEW
Artificial Intelligence
Index Report 2021
USD 1.5 billion agencies spent in FY 2019 (Figure 7.3.3). 
AI spending in 2020 was more than six times higher than 
what it was just five years ago—about USD 300 million in 
FY 2015. However, to put this in perspective, the federal 
government spent USD 682 billion on contracts in FY 2020, 
so AI currently represents 0.25% of government spending.
Contract Spending by Department and Agency
Figure 7.3.4 shows that in FY 2020, the DOD spent more on 
AI-related contracts than any other federal department 
or agency (USD 1.4 billion). In second and third place 
are NASA (USD 139.1 million) and the Department of 
Homeland Security (USD 112.3 million). DOD, NASA, and 
the Department of Health and Human Services top the 
list for the most contract spending on AI over the past 10 
years combined (Figure 7.3.5). In fact, DOD’s total contract 
spending on AI from 2001 to 2020 (USD 3.9 billion) is more 
than what was spent by the other 44 departments and 
agencies combined (USD 2.9 billion) over the same period.
Looking ahead, DOD spending on AI contracts is only 
expected to grow as the Pentagon’s Joint Artificial 
Intelligence Center (JAIC), established in June 2018, is

U.S. GOVERNMENT AI-RELATED 
CONTRACT SPENDING
Another indicator of public investment in AI technologies is 
the level of spending on government contracts across the 
federal government. Contracting for products and services 
supplied by private businesses typically occupies the largest 
share of an agency’s budget. Bloomberg Government built 
a model that captures contract spending on AI technologies 
by adding up all contracting transactions that contain a 
set of more than 100 AI-specific keywords in their titles or 
descriptions. The data reveals that the amount the federal 
government spends on contracts for AI products and 
services has reached an all-time high and shows no sign of 
slowing down. However, note that during the procurement 
process, vendors may add a bunch of keywords into their 
applications, so some of these things may have a relatively 
small AI component relative to other parts of technology.
Total Contract Spending
Federal departments and agencies spent a combined 
USD 1.8 billion on unclassified AI-related contracts in FY 
2020. This represents a more than 25% increase from the

how three of these four are setting the agenda for AI 
policymaking, including the legislative and monetary 
authority of national governments, as well as think tanks, 
civil society, and the technology and consultancy industry. 
LEGISLATION RECORDS ON AI
The number of congressional and parliamentary 
records on AI is an indicator of governmental interest 
in developing AI capabilities—and legislating issues 
pertaining to AI. In this section, we use data from 
Bloomberg and McKinsey & Company to ascertain the

number of these records and how that number has 
evolved in the last 10 years. 
Bloomberg Government identified all legislation (passed 
or introduced), reports published by congressional 
committees, and CRS reports that referenced one or more 
AI-specific keywords. McKinsey & Company searched for 
the terms “artificial intelligence” and “machine learning” 
on the websites of the U.S. Congressional Record, the U.K. 
Parliament, and the Parliament of Canada. For the United 
States, each count indicates that AI or ML was mentioned 
during a particular event contained in the Congressional 
Record, including the reading of a bill; for the U.K. and 
Canada, each count indicates that AI or ML was mentioned 
in a particular comment or remark during the proceedings.1
1 If a speaker or member mentioned artificial intelligence (AI) or machine learning (ML) multiple times within remarks, or multiple speakers mentioned AI or ML within the same event, it appears only 
once as a result. Counts for AI and ML are separate, as they were conducted in separate searches. Mentions of the abbreviations “AI” or “ML” are not included.

The 116th Congress (January 1, 2019–January 3, 2021) is 
the most AI-focused congressional session in history. The 
number of mentions of AI by this Congress in legislation, 
committee reports, and CRS reports is more than triple 
that of the 115th Congress. Congressional interest in AI 
has continued to accelerate in 2020. Figure 7.4.1 shows 
that during this congressional session, 173 distinct 
pieces of legislation either focused on or contained 
language about AI technologies, their development, 
use, and rules governing them. During that two-year 
period, various House and Senate committees and

Figure 7.4.5
CENTRAL BANKS
Central banks play a key role in conducting currency and 
monetary policy in a country or a monetary union. As 
with many other institutions, central banks are tasked 
with integrating AI into their operations and relying on 
big data analytics to assist them with forecasting, risk 
management, and financial supervision. 
Prattle, a leading provider of automated investment 
research solutions, monitors mentions of AI in the 
communications of central banks, including meeting 
minutes, monetary policy papers, press releases, 
speeches, and other official publications. 
Figure 7.4.5 shows a significant increase in the mention 
of AI across 16 central banks over the past 10 years, 
with the number reaching a peak of 1,020 in 2019. The 
sharp decline in 2020 can be explained by the COVID-19 
pandemic as most central bank communications focused 
on responses to the economic downturn. Moreover, 
the Federal Reserve in the United States, Norges Bank 
in Norway, and the European Central Bank top the 
list for the most aggregated number of AI mentions in 
communications in the past five years (Figure 7.4.6).

either U.S.-based or have a sizable presence in the United 
States, and we grouped them into three categories: think 
tanks, policy institutes and academia (27); civil society 
organizations, associations and consortiums (9); and 
industry and consultancy (6). 
AI policy papers are defined as research papers, research 
reports, blog posts, and briefs that focus on a specific policy 
issue related to AI and provide clear recommendations

for policymakers. Primary topics mean that such a topic is 
the main focus of the policy paper, while secondary topics 
mean that the policy paper either briefly touches on the 
topic or the topic is a sub-focus of the paper. 
Combined data for 2019 and 2020 suggests that the topics 
of innovation and technology, international affairs and 
international security, and industry and regulation are 
the main focuses of AI policy papers in the United States 
(Figure 7.4.7). Fewer documents placed a primary focus 
on topics related to AI ethics—such as ethics, equity and 
inclusion; privacy, safety and security; and justice and law 
enforcement—which have largely been secondary topics. 
Moreover, topics bearing on the physical sciences, energy 
and environment, humanities, and democracy have 
received the least attention in U.S. AI policy papers.

BLOOMBERG GOVERNMENT 
Bloomberg Government (BGOV) is a subscription-
based market intelligence service designed to make 
U.S. government budget and contracting data more 
accessible to business development and government 
affairs professionals. BGOV’s proprietary tools ingest 
and organize semi-structured government data sets 
and documents, enabling users to track and forecast 
investment in key markets. 
Methodology
The BGOV data included in this section was drawn from 
three original sources:
Contract Spending: BGOV’s Contracts Intelligence Tool 
ingests on a twice-daily basis all contract spending data 
published to the beta.SAM.gov Data Bank, and structures 
the data to ensure a consistent picture of government 
spending over time. For the section “U.S. Government 
Contract Spending,” BGOV analysts used FPDS-NG data, 
organized by the Contracts Intelligence Tool, to build a 
model of government spending on artificial intelligence-
related contracts in the fiscal years 2000 through 2021. 
BGOV’s model used a combination of government-
defined produce service codes and more than 100 
AI-related keywords and acronyms to identify AI-related 
contract spending.
Defense RDT&E Budget: BGOV organized all 7,057 
budget line items included in the RDT&E budget request 
based on data available on the DOD Comptroller website. 
For the section “U.S. Department of Defense (DOD) 
Budget,” BGOV used a set of more than a dozen AI-
specific keywords to identify 305 unique budget activities 
related to artificial intelligence and machine learning 
worth a combined USD 5.0 billion in FY 2021.
Congressional Record (available on Congressional 
Record website): BGOV maintains a repository of 
congressional documents, including bills, amendments, 
bill summaries, Congressional Budget Office 
assessments, reports published by congressional 
committees, Congressional Research Service (CRS), and 
others. For the section “U.S. Congressional Record,” 
BGOV analysts identified all legislation (passed or 
introduced), congressional committee reports, and 
CRS reports that referenced one or more of a dozen AI-
specific keywords. Results are organized by a two-year 
congressional session.

Examples of Central Bank Mentions
Here are some examples of how AI is mentioned by 
central banks: In the first case, China uses a geopolitical 
environment simulation and prediction platform 
that works by crunching huge amounts of data and 
then providing foreign policy suggestions to Chinese 
diplomats or the Bank of Japan use of AI prediction 
models for foreign exchange rates. For the second 
case, many central banks are leading communications 
through either official documents—for example, on 
July 25, 2019, the Dutch Central Bank (DNB) published 
Guidelines for the use of AI in financial services and 
launched its six “SAFEST” principles for regulated firms 
to use AI responsibly—or a speech on June 4, 2019, by 
the Bank of England’s Executive Director of U.K. Deposit 
Takers Supervision James Proudman, titled “Managing 
Machines: The Governance of Artificial Intelligence,” 
focused on the increasingly important strategic issue of 
how boards of regulated financial services should use AI.

Data collection and analysis was performed by the 
McKinsey Global Institute (MGI).
Canada (House of Commons)
Data was collected using the Hansard search feature on 
Parliament of Canada website. MGI searched for the terms 
“Artificial Intelligence” and “Machine Learning” (quotes 
included) and downloaded the results as a CSV. The date 
range was set to “all debates.” Data is as of Dec. 31, 2020. 
Data are available online from Aug. 31, 2002.
Each count indicates that Artificial Intelligence or Machine 
Learning was mentioned in a particular comment or remark 
during the proceedings of the House of Commons. This 
means that within an event or conversation, if a member 
mentions AI or ML multiple times within their remarks, it 
will appear only once. However if, during the same event, 
the speaker mentions AI or ML in separate comments (with 
other speakers in between), it will appear multiple times. 
Counts for Artificial Intelligence or Machine Learning are 
separate, as they were conducted in separate searches. 
Mentions of the abbreviations AI or ML are not included. 
United Kingdom (House of Commons, House of 
Lords, Westminster Hall, and Committees)
Data was collected using the Find References feature of the 
Hansard website of the U.K. Parliament. MGI searched for 
the terms “Artificial Intelligence” and “Machine Learning” 
(quotes included) and catalogued the results. Data is as 
of Dec. 31, 2020. Data are available online from January 1, 
1800 onward. Contains Parliamentary information licensed 
under the Open Parliament Licence v3.0.
As in Canada, each count indicates that Artificial 
Intelligence or Machine Learning was mentioned in a 
particular comment or remark during a proceeding. 
Therefore, if a member mentions AI or ML multiple times 
within their remarks, it will appear only once. However 
if, during the same event, the same speaker mentions 
AI or ML in separate comments (with other speakers in 
between), it will appear multiple times. Counts for Artificial 
Intelligence or Machine Learning are separate, as they 
were conducted in separate searches. Mentions of the 
abbreviations AI or ML are not included. 
United States (Senate and House of 
Representatives)
Data was collected using the advanced search feature 
of the U.S. Congressional Record website. MGI searched 
the terms “Artificial Intelligence” and “Machine Learning” 
(quotes included) and downloaded the results as a 
CSV. The “word variant” option was not selected, and 
proceedings included Senate, House of Representatives, 
and Extensions of Remarks, but did not include the Daily 
Digest. Data is as of Dec. 31, 2020, and data is available 
online from the 104th Congress onward (1995).
Each count indicates that Artificial Intelligence or Machine 
Learning was mentioned during a particular event 
contained in the Congressional Record, including the 
reading of a bill. If a speaker mentioned AI or ML multiple 
times within remarks, or multiple speakers mentioned AI or 
ML within the same event, it would appear only once as a

Overview
As AI has become an increasingly ubiquitous topic in the last decade, 
intergovernmental, national, and regional organizations have worked to 
develop policies and strategies around AI governance. These actors are 
driven by the understanding that it is imperative to find ways to address 
the ethical and societal concerns surrounding AI, while maximizing 
its benefits. Active and informed governance of AI technologies has 
become a priority for many governments around the world.
This chapter examines the intersection of AI and governance, and takes 
a closer look at how governments in different countries, regions, and 
U.S. states are working to manage AI technologies. It begins by looking 
at AI policymaking across the globe and within the United States, 
exploring which countries and political actors are most keen to advance 
AI legislation, and what kind of AI subtopics, from privacy to ethics, are 
the focus of most legislative attention. Then the chapter takes a deep 
dive into one of the world’s top public sector investors in AI, the United 
States, and studies how much its various government departments have 
spent on AI in the past five years.

CHAPTER HIGHLIGHTS
• 
An AI Index analysis of legislative records on AI in 25 countries shows that the number of bills 
containing “artificial intelligence” that were passed into law grew from just 1 in 2016 to 18 in 
2021. Spain, the United Kingdom, and the United States passed the highest number of AI-related 
bills in 2021, with each adopting three.
• 
The federal legislative record in the United States shows a sharp increase in the total number of 
proposed bills that relate to AI from 2015 to 2021, while the number of bills passed remains low, 
with only 2% ultimately becoming law.
• 
State legislators in the United States passed 1 out of every 50 proposed bills that contain AI 
provisions in 2021, while the number of such bills proposed grew from 2 in 2012 to 131 in 2021.
• 
In the United States, the current congressional session (the 117th) is on track to record the greatest 
number of AI-related mentions since 2001, with 295 mentions by the end of 2021, half way 
through the session, compared to 506 in the previous (116th) session.

GLOBAL LEGISLATION  
RECORDS ON AI 
​
Governments and legislative bodies across the globe are 
increasingly seeking to pass laws to provide funding for 
AI development and innovation, while also promoting the 
integration of human-centered values. The AI Index has 
conducted an analysis of laws passed in 25 countries by 
their legislative bodies that contain the words “artificial 
intelligence” from 2016 to 2021.
Taken together, the 25 countries analyzed have passed a 
total of 55 AI-related bills. Figure 5.2.1 demonstrates that in 
the past six years, there has been a sharp increase in terms 
of the total number of AI-related bills passed into law.1
5.1 AI AND POLICYMAKING
1 Note that the analysis only includes laws passed by national legislative bodies (e.g.  congress, parliament) with the keyword “artificial intelligence” in various languages in the title or body of the bill 
text. See the appendix for the methodology. Countries included: Australia, Belgium, Brazil, Canada, China, Denmark, Finland, France, Germany, India, Ireland, Italy, Japan, the Netherlands, New Zealand, 
Norway, Russia, Singapore, South Africa, South Korea, Spain, Sweden, Switzerland, the United Kingdom, and the United States.
Artificial Intelligence

Federal AI Legislation in the United States
A closer look at the federal legislative record in the 
United States shows a sharp increase in the total number 
of proposed bills that relate to AI (Figure 5.1.3). In 2015, 
just one federal bill was proposed, while in 2021, there 
were 130. Although this jump is significant, the number 
of bills related to AI being passed has not kept pace with 
the growing volume of proposed AI-related bills. This gap 
was most evident in 2021, when only 2% of all federal-
level AI-related bills were ultimately passed into law.

STATE-LEVEL AI LEGISLATION IN 
THE UNITED STATES
Growing policy interest in AI can also be seen in the 
large number of AI-related bills recently proposed 
at the state level in the United States, based on data 
provided by Bloomberg Government since 2012. 
Bloomberg Government classified a bill as relating to 
AI if it contained AI-related keywords such as artificial 
intelligence, machine learning, or algorithmic bias.
As is the case on the federal level, there has been a 
significant increase in the number of AI bills proposed 
at the state level in the last decade (Figure 5.1.4). 
In 2012, the first two pieces of AI-related legislation 
were proposed when New Jersey assembly member 
Annette Quijano directed the New Jersey Motor Vehicle 
Commission to establish driver’s license endorsements 
for autonomous vehicles. In the past 10 years, the 
increase has been substantial, from 2 bills in 2012 to 131 
in 2021.
A notable difference between AI-related lawmaking in the 
United States on the federal versus the state level is that 
a greater proportion of proposed state-level AI bills have 
actually passed. In 2021, of the 131 proposed state bills, 
26 were passed into law (20%), or 1 out of 5 proposed 
bills became law. This ratio is significantly higher when 
compared to the federal level, where 1 out of every 50 
proposed bills became law in 2021.

By State
In the United States, AI 
lawmaking has been relatively 
widespread across all states. As 
of 2021, 41 out of 50 states have 
proposed at least one AI-related 
bill, but certain states have been 
particularly active in generating 
AI legislation. Figure 5.1.5 shows 
that Massachusetts has proposed 
the most AI bills, with 40 since 
2012, followed by Hawaii (35) 
and New Jersey (32). Focusing 
on just 2021 in Figure 5.1.6, 
Massachusetts was the state that 
proposed the most AI-related 
bills, with 20, followed by Illinois 
(15) and Alabama (12).

Sponsorship by Political Party
State-level AI legislation data reveals that there is a 
partisan dynamic to AI lawmaking. Figure 5.1.7 plots the 
number of AI-related bills sponsored at the state level by 
Democratic and Republican lawmakers. Although there 
has been an increase in AI bills proposed by members 
of both parties since 2012, in the past four years, the 
data suggests Democrats were more likely to sponsor 
AI-related legislation. Whereas Democrats sponsored 
only two more AI bills than Republicans in 2018, they 
sponsored 39 more in 2021.

MENTIONS OF AI IN LEGISLATIVE 
RECORDS
Another barometer of legislative interest in AI is the 
number of mentions of “artificial intelligence” in 
governmental and parliamentary proceedings. This 
subsection considers data on mentions of AI both 
in U.S. congressional records and the parliamentary 
proceedings of other countries based on AI Index and 
Bloomberg Government data. 
AI Mentions in U.S. Congressional Records
In the last five years, and especially in 2021, U.S. 
congressional sessions have devoted increasing amounts 
of time to discussions of AI. This section presents data 
from Bloomberg Government concerning mentions of AI-
related keywords in congressional proceedings, broken 
down by legislation, congressional committee reports, 
and congressional research service reports.
According to Figure 5.1.8, the current congressional 
session (the 117th) is on track (as of the end of 2021) 
to record the greatest number of AI-related mentions 
since 2001. The most recently completed congressional 
session, the 116th (2019-2020), saw 506 AI mentions, 
nearly 3.4 times as many mentions as there were during 
the 115th session (2017–2018), and 30 times as many as 
the 114th session (2015–2016).

U.S. AI POLICY PAPERS
To estimate activities outside national governments 
that are also informing AI-related rulemaking, the 
AI Index tracks 55 U.S.-based organizations that 
published policy papers in the past four years. Those 
organizations include: think tanks and policy institutes 
(19); university institutes and research programs (14); 
civil society organizations, associations, and consortiums 
(9); industry and consultancy organizations (9); and 
government agencies (4).3 A policy paper in this section 
is defined as a research paper, research report, brief, or 
blog post that addresses issues related to AI and makes 
specific recommendations to policymakers. Topics of 
those papers are divided into primary and secondary 
categories: A primary topic is the main focus of the paper, 
while a secondary topic is a subtopic of the paper or an 
issue that was briefly explored.
Figure 5.1.11 plots the total number of U.S.-based AI-
related policy papers that have been published from 
2018 to 2021, which can proxy the general interest in AI 
within the U.S. policymaking space. The total number of 
policy papers has tripled since 2018, peaking in 2020 with 
273, and decreasing slightly in 2021, with 210.

In 2021, the leading primary topics were Privacy, Safety, 
and Security; Innovation and Technology; and Ethics 
(Figure 5.1.12). Certain topics, such as government and 
public administration, education and skills, as well as 
democracy, did not feature prominently as primary 
topics, but they were reported on more frequently 
as secondary topics. Among the AI topics to receive 
comparatively little attention from tracked organizations 
are those that relate to energy and the environment, 
humanities, physical sciences, and social and behavioral 
sciences.

FEDERAL BUDGET FOR NONDEFENSE  
AI R&D 
In December 2021, the National Science and Technology Council 
published a report on the public-sector AI R&D budget across 
departments and agencies participating in the Networking and 
Information Technology Research and Development (NITRD) 
program and the National Artificial Intelligence Initiative. The report 
does not include information on classified AI R&D investment by the 
defense and intelligence agencies.
In fiscal year (FY) 2021, nondefense U.S. government agencies 
allocated a total of $1.53 billion to AI R&D spending, approximately 
2.7 times what was spent in FY 2018 (Figure 5.2.1). This figure 
is projected to rise 8.8% for FY 2022, with a total of $1.67 billion 
requested.4 The increasing amount spent on AI R&D by nondefense 
departments indicates the U.S. government’s continued strong 
interest in public sector funding for AI research and development 
spanning a wide range of federal agencies.

U.S. DEPARTMENT OF DEFENSE 
BUDGET REQUEST
Spending on AI by the U.S. Department of Defense (DOD) 
can be proxied by looking at the publicly available 
requests made by the DOD for research, development, 
test, and evaluation (RDT&E) relating to AI. In FY 2021, 
DOD allocated $9.26 billion across 500 AI R&D programs 
(Figure 5.2.2), a 6.68% increase from the $8.68 billion 
spent in 2020. For FY 2022, the department has requested 
$10 billion so far, which is likely to grow once additional 
requests and congressional appropriations are taken into 
account.
Important data caveat: This chart is indicative of one 
of the challenges of quantifying public AI spending. 
Bloomberg Government’s analysis that searches AI-
relevant keywords in DOD budgets shows that the 
department is requesting $10.0 billion for AI-specific R&D 
in FY 2022. However, DOD’s own measurement produces 
a smaller number of $874 million. The discrepancy 
may result from the difference in defining AI-related 
budget items. For example, a research project that uses 
AI for cyber defense may count human, hardware, and 
operations-related expenditures within the AI-related 
budget request, though the AI software component will 
be much smaller.

DOD spending on AI R&D can also be broken down on 
a subdepartmental level, which reveals how individual 
defense agencies—the Army and the Navy, for instance—
compare in their AI spending (Figure 5.2.3). The U.S. 
Navy was the top-spending DOD agency in FY 2021 and 
is poised to maintain that position in 2022. They have 
requested a total of $1.86 billion in FY 2022 for AI-related 
projects, followed by the Army ($1.77 billion), the Office 
of the Secretary of Defense ($1.1 billion) and the Air Force 
($883 million).

U.S. GOVERNMENT AI-RELATED 
CONTRACT SPENDING
Public investment in AI can also be measured by federal 
government spending on AI-related contracts. U.S. 
government agencies often award contracts to private 
companies for the supply of various goods and services 
that typically occupy the largest share of an agency’s 
budget. Bloomberg Government built a model to classify 
whether a U.S. government contract was AI-related by 
adding up all contracting transactions that contain a set 
of more than 100 AI-specific keywords in their titles or 
descriptions.5
Total Contract Spending
In 2021, federal departments and agencies spent a total of 
$1.79 billion on AI-related contracts. Although this amount 
is nearly double what was spent on AI-related contracts in 
2018 (roughly $920 million), it represents a slight decrease 
from the amount spent on AI-related contracts in 2020, 
which peaked at $1.97 billion (Figure 5.2.4).

Contract Spending by Department and Agency
Figures 5.2.5 and 5.2.6 report AI-related contract spending 
by the top 10 federal agencies in 2021 and from 2000 to 
2021, respectively. The DOD outspent the rest of the U.S. 
government on both charts by a significant margin. In 
2021, it spent $1.14 billion on AI-related contracts, roughly 
five times what was spent by the next highest department, 
the Department of Health and Human Services ($234 
million). 
Aggregate spending on AI contracts in the last four years 
tells a similar story. Since 2018, the DOD has spent $5.20 
billion on AI contracts, approximately seven times the next 
highest spender, NASA ($1.41 billion). In fact, since 2018, 
the DOD has spent twice as much on AI-related contracts 
as all other government agencies combined. Following the 
DOD and NASA are the Department of Health and Human 
Services ($700 million), the Department of Homeland 
Security ($362 million), and Department of the Treasury 
($156 million).

BLOOMBERG GOVERNMENT
Prepared by Amanda Allen
Bloomberg Government is a premium, subscription-
based service that provides comprehensive information 
and analytics for professionals who interact with—or 
are affected by—the government. Delivering news, 
analytics, and data-driven decision tools, Bloomberg 
Government’s digital workspace gives an intelligent edge 
to government affairs and contracting professionals. For 
more information or a demo, visit about.bgov.com.
 
Methodology
Contract Spending: Bloomberg Government’s Contracts 
Intelligence Tool structures all contracts data from 
www.fpds.gov. The CIT includes a model of government 
spending on artificial intelligence-related contracts that is 
based on a combination of government-defined product 
service codes and more than 100 AI-related keywords. 
For the section “U.S. Government Contract Spending,” 
Bloomberg Government analysts used contract spending 
data from fiscal year 2000 through fiscal year 2021.
Defense RDT&E Budget: Bloomberg Government 
organized all the RDT&E budget request line items 
available from the Defense Department Comptroller. For 
the section “U.S. Department of Defense (DOD) Budget,” 
Bloomberg Government used a set of AI-specific keywords 
to identify 500 unique budget activities related to artificial 
intelligence and machine learning worth a combined $5.9 
billion in FY 2021.
Legislative Documents: Bloomberg Government 
maintains a repository of congressional documents, 
including bills, Congressional Budget Office assessments, 
and reports published by congressional committees, 
the Congressional Research Service, and other offices. 
Bloomberg Government also ingests state legislative 
bills. For the section “AI Policy and Governance,” 
Bloomberg Government analysts identified all legislation, 
congressional committee reports, and CRS reports that 
referenced one or more AI-specific keywords.

GLOBAL LEGISLATION RECORDS ON AI
For AI-related bills passed into laws, the AI Index performed searches of the keyword “artificial intelligence,” in respective 
languages, on the websites of 25 countries’ congresses or parliaments, in full-text of bills. Note that only laws passed 
by state-level legislative bodies and signed into law (i.e., by presidents or received royal assent) from 2015 to 2021 are 
included. Future AI Index reports hope to include analysis on other types of legal documents, such as regulations and 
standards, adopted by state- or supranational-level legislative bodies, government agencies, etc.

State Council Notice on the Issuance of the Next 
Generation Artificial Intelligence Development Plan 
Completed: July 8, 2017 
Released: July 20, 2017 
 
A Next Generation Artificial  
Intelligence Development Plan 
 
The rapid development of artificial intelligence (AI) will profoundly change human society 
and life and change the world. To seize the major strategic opportunity for the development 
of AI, to build China’s first-mover advantage in the development of AI, to accelerate the 
construction of an innovative nation and global power in science and technology, in 
accordance with the requirements of the CCP Central Committee and the State Council, this 
plan has been formulated. 
I.  The Strategic Situation 
 
The development of AI has entered a new stage. After sixty years of evolution, especially in 
mobile Internet, big data, supercomputing, sensor networks, brain science, and other new 
theories and new technologies, under the joint impetus of powerful demands of economic 
and social development, AI’s development has accelerated, displaying deep learning, 
cross-domain integration, man-machine collaboration, the opening of swarm intelligence, 
autonomous control, and other new characteristics. Big data-driven cognitive learning, 
cross-media collaborative processing, and man-machine collaboration–strengthened 
intelligence, swarm integrated intelligence, and autonomous intelligent systems have 
become the focus of the development of AI. The results of brain science research inspired 
human-like intelligence that awaits action; the trends involving the chips, hardware, and 
platform have become apparent; the development of AI has entered into a new stage. At 
present, the development a new generation of AI and related disciplines, theoretical 
modeling, technological innovation, hardware and software upgrades, etc., all advance, 
provoking chain-style breakthroughs, promoting the acceleration of the elevation of 
economic and social domains from digitization and networkization to intelligentization.  
 
AI has become a new focus of international competition. AI is a strategic technology that 
will lead in the future; the world’s major developed countries are taking the development of 
AI as a major strategy to enhance national competitiveness and protect national security; 
intensifying the introduction of plans and strategies for this core technology, top talent, 
standards and regulations, etc.; and trying to seize the initiative in the new round of 
international science and technology competition. At present, China’s situation in national 
security and international competition is more complex, and [China] must, looking at the 
world, take the development of AI to the national strategic level with systemic layout, take 
the initiative in planning, firmly seize the strategic initiative in the new stage of 
international competition in AI development, to create new competitive advantage, 
opening up the development of new space, and effectively protecting national security. 
 
AI has become a new engine of economic development. AI has become the core driving 
force for a new round of industrial transformation, [which] will advance the release of the 


3 
huge energy stored from the previous scientific and technological revolution and industrial 
transformation, and create a new powerful engine, reconstructing production, distribution, 
exchange, consumption, etc., links in economic activities; with new demands taking shape 
from the macro to the micro within each domain of intelligentization; with the birth of new 
technologies, new products, new industries, new formats, new models; triggering 
significant changes in economic structure, profound changes in human modes of 
production, lifestyle, and thinking; and a whole leap of achieving social productivity. 
China’s economic development enters a new normal, deepening the supply side of 
structural reform task is very arduous, [and China] must accelerate the rapid application of 
AI, cultivating and expanding AI industries to inject new kinetic energy into China’s 
economic development. 
 
AI brings new opportunities for social construction. China is currently in the decisive stage 
of comprehensively constructing a moderately prosperous society. The challenges of 
population aging, environmental constraints, etc., remain serious. The widespread use of AI 
in education, medical care, pensions, environmental protection, urban operations, judicial 
services, and other fields will greatly improve the level of precision in public services, 
comprehensively enhancing the people’s quality of life. AI technologies can accurately 
sense, forecast, and provide early warning of major situations for infrastructure facilities 
and social security operations; grasp group cognition and psychological changes in a 
timely manner; and take the initiative in decision-making and reactions—which will 
significantly elevate the capability and level of social governance, playing an irreplaceable 
role in effectively maintaining social stability. 
 
The uncertainties in the development of AI create new challenges. AI is a disruptive 
technology with widespread influence that may cause: transformation of employment 
structures; impact on legal and social theories; violations of personal privacy; challenges in 
international relations and norms; and other problems. It will have far-reaching effects on 
the management of government, economic security, and social stability, as well as global 
governance. While vigorously developing AI, we must attach great importance to the 
potential safety risks and challenges, strengthen the forward-looking prevention and 
guidance on restraint, minimize risk, and ensure the safe, reliable, and controllable 
development of AI. 
 
China possesses a favorable foundation for the development of AI. The nation has: 
deployed the National Key Research and Development Plan’s key special projects, such as 
intelligent manufacturing; issued and implemented the “Internet +” and AI Three-Year 
Activities and Implementation Program, releasing a series of measures from science and 
technology research and development; and promoted applications and industrial 
development, and other aspects. As a result of many years of continuous accumulation, 
China has achieved important progress in the field of AI, with the number of international 
scientific and technology papers published and the number of inventions patented ranked 
second in the world, while achieving important breakthroughs in certain domains of core 
crucial technologies. Leading the world in voice recognition and visual recognition 
technologies; initially possessing the capability for leapfrog development in adaptive 
autonomous learning, intuitive sensing, comprehensive reasoning, hybrid intelligence, and 
swarm intelligence, etc.; with Chinese information processing, intelligent monitoring, 
biometric identification, industrial robots, service robots, and unmanned driving gradually 
entering practical application; AI innovation and entrepreneurship have become 
increasingly active, and a number of leading enterprises have accelerated their growth, 


4 
receiving widespread concern and recognition internationally. Accelerate the accumulation 
of technological capabilities and massive data resources, the organization integration of 
both the huge demand for applications and an open market environment, which together 
constitute China’s unique advantage in AI development. 
 
At the same time, we must also clearly see that there is still a gap between China’s overall 
level of development of AI relative to that of developed countries—lacking major original 
results in the basic theory, core algorithms, key equipment, high-end chips, major products 
and systems, foundational materials, components, software and interfaces, etc. Scientific 
research institutions and enterprises do not yet possess international influence upon 
ecological cycles and supply chain, lacking a systematic research and development layout; 
cutting-edge talent for AI is far from meeting demand. Adapting to the development of AI 
requires the urgent improvement of basic infrastructure, policies and regulations, and 
standards systems. 
 
Facing a new situation and new demands, we must take the initiative to pursue and adapt 
to change, firmly seize the major historic opportunity for the development of AI, stick 
closely to development, study and evaluate the general trends, take the initiative to plan, 
grasp the direction, seize the opportunity, lead the world in new trends in the development 
of AI, serve economic and social development, and support national security, promoting 
the overall elevation of the nation’s competitiveness and leapfrog development. 
 
II.  The Overall Requirements 
(1)  Guiding Ideology 
  
Comprehensively implement the spirit of the 18th Party Congress and 18th Central 
Committee’s Third, Fourth, Fifth, and Sixth Plenary Sessions. Thoroughly study and 
implement the spirit of General Secretary Xi Jinping’s series of important sayings and new 
concepts, new ideas, and new strategy for governing the country; according to the “five in 
one” overall layout and “four comprehensives” strategic layout, conscientiously implement 
the CPC Central Committee and State Council decision-making arrangements, deeply 
implement the innovation-driven development strategy to accelerate the deep integration 
of AI with the economy, society and national defense as a primary line, to enhance: 
scientific and technological innovation capacity for a new generation of AI as the main 
direction of attack; intelligent economy development; smart society construction; 
protecting national security; building of knowledge clusters, technology clusters, and 
industry clusters mutually integrated with talent, system, and culture, for a mutually 
supporting ecosystem, advancing intelligentization as the center of humanity’s sustainable 
development. Comprehensively enhance society’s productive forces, comprehensive 
national power, and national competitiveness, in order to provide strong support to 
accelerate the construction of an innovative new-type nation and global science and 
technology power, to achieve the two centennial goals and the great rejuvenation of the 
Chinese nation.
