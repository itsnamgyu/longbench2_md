This critical review comprehensively assesses the current landscape of sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) technol­
ogies, their associated costs, emissions profiles, policy implications, and market dynamics. This review highlights 
several key findings regarding bio-jet fuels as a low-carbon emission alternative to traditional jet fuel. First, the 
hydroprocessed esters and fatty acids (HEFA) technology stands out, boasting the highest possible technology 
readiness level (TRL) and fuel readiness level (FRL) of 9, indicating its advanced stage of development and 
readiness for commercial deployment. Second, most bio-jet fuel production technologies entail costs averaging at 
least 120% higher than conventional fossil-based jet fuel while achieving emissions reductions of at least 27%. 
Despite these high costs, only 38% of existing policies provide monetary incentives to SAF producers, resulting in 
SAF production operating at only 3.5% of its total potential capacity. Consequently, the paper highlights open 
research questions at the intersection of SAF technology development, policy, and market.   
1. Introduction 
Motivated by the urgent need to reduce greenhouse gas (GHG) 
emissions, the International Air Transport Association (IATA), an in­
ternational airline organization, has set a cap on net aviation CO2 
emissions from 2020 and a 50% reduction of CO2 emissions by 2050 
compared to 2005 levels (IATA, 2021). The most promising way to 
reduce GHG emissions in the aviation sector is to use alternative aviation 
fuels: bio-jet fuels, synthetic jet fuels, liquefied natural gas (LNG), liq­
uefied hydrogen (LH2), electrofuels, and electricity (Atsonios et al., 
2015; Dahal et al., 2021). Among these, bio-jet fuels appeal to aviation 
companies due to their economic competitiveness and drop-in compat­
ibility with existing aircraft and fuel systems (Atsonios et al., 2015; 
Guti´
errez-Antonio et al., 2017; Santos et al., 2018). Bio-jet fuels reduce 
GHG emissions and meet stringent fuel property requirements, such as 
low sulfur content and high thermal stability (Wei et al., 2019). 
Bio-jet fuels have gained considerable interest from the scientific 
community and have been highlighted in several recent review articles. 
Prior reviews focus on isolated dimensions of the complex bio-jet fuel 
landscape, ranging from production processes and techno-economic 
performance (Dahal et al., 2021; Guti´
errez-Antonio et al., 2017; Wei 
et al., 2019; Doliente et al., 2020; Emmanouilidou et al., 2023; Goh 
et al., 2022; Kargbo et al., 2021; Su-ungkavatin et al., 2023; Wang and 
Tao, 2016) to commercialization status and performance characteristics 
(Abrantes et al., 2021; Kandaramath Hari et al., 2015; Mawhood et al., 
2016; Becken et al., 2023) and policies status (Larsson et al., 2019). 
Three recent reviews holistically evaluate the confluence of policies, 
markets, and technological innovations (Zhang et al., 2020; Shahriar 
and Khanal, 2022; Ng et al., 2021; Detsios et al., 2023). This article 
further examines the intricate interplay of policies, markets, and tech­
nological innovations. To the best of our knowledge, this critical review 
is the first to complete the following:  
1) Extract techno-economic analysis (TEA) and life cycle analysis (LCA) 
data from over 50 sources.  
2) Quantitatively assess the current and future market of sustainable 
aviation fuel (SAF).  
3) Compare market reports (forecasts) and SAF policy adoption (data).  
4) Identify critical research directions at the nexus of SAF technology, 
markets, and policy.

By synthesizing techno-economic, emissions, policy, and market di­
mensions, this review offers a comprehensive perspective on the op­
portunities and challenges ahead in realizing the full potential of bio-jet 
fuels amid the global imperative to combat climate change. The 
remainder of this article is organized as follows: Section 2 reviews the 
current technologies for producing SAF; Section 3 presents the current 
policy status for SAF; Section 4 presents the past, present, and future 
markets of SAF and discusses challenges for SAF implementation; and 
Section 5 summarizes the concluding remarks and open research 
directions. 
2. SAF technologies 
2.1. Methodology 
Bio-jet fuel, also referred to as SAF, describes biomass and bio­
materials derived synthesized paraffinic kerosene (SPK) that is blended 
into conventional petroleum-derived jet fuel (Jet A) (Doliente et al., 
2020). This section thoroughly examines the seven American Society for 
Testing and Materials (ASTM)-certified SAF production technologies: 
Fischer-Tropsch (FT-SPK), Fischer-Tropsch synthetic kerosene with ar­
omatics (FT-SPK/A), hydroprocessed esters and fatty acids (HEFA-SPK), 
synthetic iso-paraffins from fermented hydroprocessed sugar (HFS–SIP), 
alcohol-to-jet (ATJ-SPK), catalytic hydrothermolysis (CHJ-SPK), and 
hydrocarbon hydroprocessed esters and fatty acids (HC-HEFA-SPK) 
(Abrantes et al., 2021). Two additional ASTM-certified pathways for 
co-processing biomass feedstocks in petroleum refineries are discussed 
in Section 2.6. 
This analysis offers a comprehensive understanding of the SAF pro­
duction landscape, encompassing the technological aspects and the 
intricate interplay of economic and environmental considerations. The 
minimum jet fuel selling price (MJSP) and GHG emissions were used to 
quantify the status of each technology. The MJSP is calculated from a 
TEA and represents the selling price of SAF at the break-even net present 
value (NPV), meaning the selling price of SAF where the difference 
between the present value of cash inflows and cash outflows arising from 
the production and sale of SAF are equivalent (Li et al., 2018). The GHG 
emissions are calculated from an LCA of the SAF production process. A 
full LCA would include a “cradle-to-grave” approach by considering 
each step of the SAF life cycle: design/development of the product, raw 
material acquisition, manufacturing, distribution use/maintenance/r­
euse, and end-of-life activities (Jacquemin et al., 2012). The studies 
selected for our analysis include cradle-to-grave analyses and less in­
clusive LCA scopes. For example, Pipitone et al. (2023) used a “gate-­
to-gate” approach, considering only the manufacturing or process 
emissions. Section 2.4 discusses the impact of LCA scope inconsistencies 
across sources on a comparative analysis of SAF technologies. 
The technology pathway review was conducted by searching the 
literature for recent peer-reviewed scientific papers from 2015 to 2023. 
The combination of the keywords "bio-jet fuel" and "sustainable aviation 
fuel" with "techno-economic," "life cycle analysis," and "emissions" 
yielded over 20,000 results in Google Scholar. The Google Scholar 
search listed results in order of relevance, and searches for each keyword 
combination were stopped on page 15 (a total of 150 results). Manual 
filtering was applied to select peer-reviewed articles that explicitly 
calculated the MJSP or GHG emissions and remove articles that studied 
non-ASTM-certified technologies (e.g., pyrolysis). After manual 
filtering, 73 pieces of literature met the above criteria. Table 1 catego­
rizes the literature reviewed by economic analysis, life cycle analysis, 
economic and life cycle analysis, and technology reviews and specifies 
the technology pathway considered. 
2.2. Technology descriptions 
Seven ASTM-certified technologies for SAF production (Table 2) 
have been extensively reviewed in the literature (Table 1) and can be 
categorized into three feedstock types: bio-oils, biomass for sugar pro­
duction, and lignocellulosic biomass. Fig. 1 illustrates the main process

steps for five ASTM-certified technologies from their feedstock group: 
FT, HEFA, CHJ, ATJ, and HFS–SIP. Table 2 lists the characteristics of 
seven ASTM-certified technologies, including feedstock type, technol­
ogy readiness level (TRL), fuel readiness level (FRL), blend limit, and 
year of ASTM certification. Two additional ASTM-certified pathways for 
co-processing biomass feedstocks in petroleum refineries are discussed 
in Section 2.6. The TRL measures the progress of a technology toward 
commercialization. The FRL reflects the risk associated with the devel­
opment of new fuels. The FRL classification is preferred over TRL in the 
aviation industry for communication of fuel technology maturity 
(Mawhood et al., 2016). The blend limit refers to the percent of SAF 
allowed to mix with conventional jet fuel. 
HEFA is currently the only fully commercialized SAF technology, 
boasting a TRL and FRL of 9 (Dahal et al., 2021); however, with the 
urgent need for widespread global SAF capacity, developing and scaling 
additional technologies is imperative. Catalytic hydrothermolysis 
(CHJ), another oil-to-jet process, consumes less hydrogen than HEFA; 
however, the process has a lower TRL due to unfavorable operating 
conditions, i.e., temperatures from 450 ◦C to 475 ◦C and pressures of 
210 bar (Wang and Tao, 2016; Eswaran et al., 2021). Fischer–Tropsch 
synthesis has been demonstrated commercially to produce syngas from 
coal and natural gas. Using biomass as a FT feedstock is more chal­
lenging due to its heterogeneous nature. Thus, biomass pretreatment is a 
critical and potentially costly step to achieve the desired properties of 
syngas (high carbon and hydrogen content and no impurities) (Goh 
et al., 2022; Hu et al., 2012). The ATJ process has strong potential for 
commercial development with bioethanol as a feedstock, given the 
current worldwide production, price, and market share advantages over 
other alcohols (Goh et al., 2022). However, with the widespread use of 
bioethanol in the petrochemical industry as a mandatory blended 
component of automobile fuel, the commercialization of ATJ may create 
competition between the air and ground transportation sectors 
regarding feedstock availability (Doliente et al., 2020). HFS–SIP, also 
called direct sugar to hydrocarbon (DSHC), converts biomass for sugar 
production to alkane-type fuels using anaerobic fermentation, bypassing 
the alcohol intermediate in ATJ (Wei et al., 2019). HFS–SIP is the only 
process resulting in a SIP fuel. HFS–SIP has a lower FRL (Santos et al., 
2018; Wei et al., 2019; Doliente et al., 2020; Emmanouilidou et al., 
2023), mainly due to the difference in fuel properties of SIP and Jet A, 
including a significant difference in fuel viscosity (Dahal et al., 2021). 
2.3. Economic and environmental performance review 
SAF technologies’ economic and environmental performance are 
arguably the most important metrics for commercialization. Fig. 2 dis­

et al., 2021)) of conventional fossil-based jet fuel. Furthermore, we 
calculated each technology’s average MJSP and GHG emissions across 
all sources and feedstocks (Table 3). 
HEFA and CHJ stand out as economically attractive options with 
MJSP averages of 1.12 $ L−1 and 1.30 $ L−1, respectively (Table 3). 
HEFA excels due to the existing established biodiesel supply chain 
components, high yields from oil-based feedstocks, and a low number of 
process steps. CHJ similarly benefits from high-yielding oil-based feed­
stocks but needs more commercial-scale data (Eswaran et al., 2021). 
Two instances report SAF costs below fossil-based jet fuel (HEFA at 0.44 
$ L−1 from waste cooking oil (Barbera et al., 2020) and an intensified 
ATJ process at 0.47 $ L−1 from lignocellulosic waste (Romero-Izquierdo 
et al., 2021)). HFS–SIP reports the highest MJSP of 5.79 $ L−1 from a 
wheat straw feedstock (de Jong et al., 2015) and has the highest average 
MJSP among its reported data, 3.99 $ L−1. Regarding GHG emissions, 
SAF generally emits less CO2, except for one HEFA scenario (Liu et al., 
2021). Table 3 indicates that, on average, FT reduces CO2 emissions the 
most, while HEFA has the highest emissions among SAF pathways. 
Our analysis indicates an unclear best technology across all metrics 
(TRL, FRL, MJSP, and GHG emissions). FT offers low CO2 emissions, 
while HEFA excels in MJSP, FRL, and TRL. FT’s average MJSP (2.08 $

L−1) is higher than HEFA’s (1.12 $ L−1), but its average CO2 emissions 
(7.84 gCO2eq MJ−1) significantly outperform other pathways. More­
over, averages calculated in Table 3 are insufficient for directly 
comparing technologies due to varying analysis factors among sources, 
including feedstock variations, geographic variations, and different 
economic estimation parameters or LCA scopes across the studies. 
Among 58 quantitative analysis papers, 21 offer consistent technology 
comparisons (multiple technology comparisons in Table 1). For 
instance, Tanzil et al. (2021a) ranked HEFA as the most economical SAF 
pathway (0.88 $ L−1), credited to its high fuel yield. De Jong et al. 
(2017) found that FT significantly reduces emissions. Both studies affirm 
HEFA and FT as top-performing SAF pathways. However, the best choice 
hinges on specific criteria, including country/region, feedstock costs and 
availability, co-products, and land and water resources. 
2.4. Comparative analysis 
Next, we compare the trade-offs between MJSP and GHG emissions 
using results from 14 papers (from our initial 58 technology reports), 
which conducted TEA and LCA on the same process (Santos et al., 2018; 
Pipitone et al., 2023; Michaga et al., 2022; Real Guimar˜
aes et al., 2023; 
Alam et al., 2021; Liu et al., 2021; Umenweke et al., 2023; Moretti et al., 
2021; Park et al., 2022; Vela-García et al., 2020; Michailos, 2018; Capaz 
et al., 2021; Tanzil et al., 2021b). Fig. 3 compares the MJSP values and 
GHG emissions for each study organized by technology. The arrows in 
Fig. 3 show the impact of a 100 $ tonneCO2
−1 carbon tax on the MSJP of 
SAF technologies. Most technologies with low CO2 emissions (<40 gCO2 
MJ−1) are minimally affected by this moderately high carbon tax. 
Furthermore, with the addition of a carbon tax, 9 SAF processes are 
cheaper than conventional fossil-based jet fuel (1.27 $ L−1). This high­
lights the impact carbon tax may have on the future of SAF. 
For the FT technologies (blue), most studies report an MJSP of 
around 2.5 $ L−1 and CO2 emissions below 25 gCO2 MJ−1. Two outliers 
stand out: Tanzil et al. (2021b) (6.2 gCO2 MJ−1, 3.74 $ L−1) and Real 
Guimar˜
aes et al. (2023) (16 gCO2 MJ−1, 0.45 $ L−1). Tanzil et al. 
(2021b) (6.2 gCO2 MJ−1, 3.74 $ L−1) produce SAF from corn stover in 
the US with a feedstock cost of 125 $ tonne−1. The corn stover is almost 
double the second highest feedstock cost among the FT studies 
(switchgrass 70 $ tonne−1 (Tanzil et al., 2022)). On the contrary, Real 
Guimar˜
aes et al. (2023) (16 gCO2 MJ−1, 0.45 $ L−1) produce SAF from 
bagasse (a sugarcane mill by-product) in an integrated sugarcane mill in 
Brazil, resulting in a much lower MJSP. Ethanol is the main product of 
the integrated sugarcane mill concept, accounting for over 50% of the 
total mill revenue. Furthermore, they include a carbon credit of 10 $ 
tonneCO2
−1 for CO2 avoided, further reducing the MJSP for SAF. 
HFS–SIP studies (purple) consistently report higher MJSPs than the 
other SAF technologies (2.78 $ L−1 to 4.8 $ L−1). Like FT, feedstock cost 
plays a vital role in the MJSP of HFS–SIP. Michailos (2018) (46.2 gCO2 
MJ−1, 2.78 $ L−1) studied HFS–SIP produced from bagasse. The cost of 
bagasse (44 $ tonne−1) is significantly lower than the remaining two 
HFS–SIP studies’ feedstock costs (molasses 70 $ tonne−1 (Tanzil et al., 
2022) and corn stover 125 $ tonne−1 (Tanzil et al., 2021b)), resulting in 
a lower MJSP. In contrast, Michailos (2018) (46.2 gCO2 MJ−1, 2.78 $ 
L−1) also report the highest CO2 emissions of the HFS–SIP studies. The 
discrepancy in CO2 emissions is attributed to different LCA scopes. 
Michailos (2018) (46.2 gCO2 MJ−1, 2.78 $ L−1) chose a cradle-to-grave 
LCA, including all CO2 emissions from plant cultivation to SAF com­
bustion. Tanzil et al. (2022) (39.6 gCO2 MJ−1, 3.19 $ L−1) and Tanzil 
et al. (2021b) (19.5 gCO2 MJ−1, 4.8 $ L−1) only consider a cradle-to-gate 
LCA, meaning emissions are only accounted for from plant cultivation to 
product production (no transportation emissions considered from SAF 
distribution or combustion). 
ATJ technologies (green) report a wide range of MJSPs and CO2 
emissions. Reported MJSPs span from less than 1 $ L−1 to more than 4 $ 
L−1. Tanzil et al. (2021b) (24.7 gCO2 MJ−1, 4.09 $ L−1) report the 
highest MJSP from corn stover in the US costing 125 $ tonne−1 (the 
highest feedstock cost from the ATJ studies). On the contrary, Park et al. 
(2022) (37.9 gCO2 MJ−1, 0.75 $ L−1) report the lowest MJSP utilizing 
bioethanol produced from corn in the US as the feedstock. Starting with 
bioethanol (0.53 $ L−1) reduces biomass processing and supply chain 
costs. For CO2 emissions, ATJ technologies span from less than 20 gCO2 
MJ−1 to almost 80 gCO2 MJ−1. Tanzil et al. (2022) (17.5 gCO2 MJ−1, 
1.97 $ L−1) and Tanzil et al. (2021b) (24.7 gCO2 MJ−1, 4.09 $ L−1) 
conducted a cradle-to-gate LCA (no SAF distribution or combustion 
emissions accounted for) and reported the lowest CO2 emissions. The 
highest CO2 emissions for ATJ are reported by Vela-García et al. (2020) 
(75 gCO2 MJ−1, 1.2 $ L−1). Vela-García et al. (2020) (75 gCO2 MJ−1, 1.2 
$ L−1) used a gate-to-gate LCA scope, meaning only process emissions 
are accounted for, and there is no credit for emissions savings from the 
biomass feedstock. 
Like FT, HFS–SIP, and ATJ, the MJSP and CO2 emissions data re­
ported for HEFA are heavily reliant on feedstock cost and LCA scope, 
respectively. HEFA technologies (red) reported similar MJSPs, ranging 
from less than 1 $ L−1 to 2 $ L−1, with variations attributed to feedstock 
choice. Liu et al. (2021) (53 gCO2 MJ−1, 0.56 $ L−1) report the lowest 
MJSP for SAF produced from castor oil in China. CO2 emissions of HEFA 
technologies show much more variation, spanning from less than 20 
gCO2 MJ−1 to almost 80 gCO2 MJ−1. In general Liu et al. (2021) (53 
gCO2 MJ−1, 0.56 $ L−1 & 55 gCO2 MJ−1, 0.69 $ L−1) and Capaz et al. 
(2021) (73.5 gCO2 MJ−1, 1.93 $ L−1 & 69.9 gCO2 MJ−1, 2.03 $ L−1) 
report the highest emissions for HEFA produced from castor oilseed, 
jatropha oilseed, palm oil, and soybean oil, respectively. Liu et al. (2021) 
and Capaz et al. (2021) include land-use-change (LUC) from the feed­
stock in their LCA. These feedstocks (specifically palm oil) have high 
LUC, mainly due to the negative environmental impacts of deforestation 
for crop expansion (Zhao et al., 2021). Strangely, the lowest emissions 
reported for HEFA (Pipitone et al., 2023) (12 gCO2 MJ−1, 1.84 $ L−1) 
utilize a palm oil feedstock. However, Pipitone et al. (2023) consider a 
HEFA process utilizing on-site hydrogen produced by aqueous phase 
reforming, reducing the emissions by 54% compared to conventional 
fossil-based hydrogen utilization. Furthermore, for comparison, Pipi­
tone et al. (2023) only perform a gate-to-gate LCA, meaning only process 
emissions are accounted for, and the environmental impact of the 
feedstock is not considered. 
Feedstock is a significant component of SAF MJSP and GHG emis­
sions. It is important to note that feedstock cost and availability vary

from region to region. For example, the US and Brazil are the top two 
global ethanol producers from corn and sugarcane, respectively. Thus, 
for the ATJ pathway, Tanzil et al. (2021b) (24.7 gCO2 MJ−1, 4.09 $ L−1) 
and Park et al. (2022) (37.9 gCO2 MJ−1, 0.75 $ L−1) study SAF produced 
from corn stover (125 $ tonne−1) and corn ethanol (0.53 $ L−1) in the 
US. In contrast, Santos et al. (2018) (42.5 gCO2 MJ−1, 2.83 $ L−1) and 
Capaz et al. (2021) (44.7 gCO2 MJ−1, 1.9 $ L−1) studied SAF produced 
from sugarcane (22 $ tonne−1 and 18 $ tonne−1, respectively) in Brazil. 
SAF technology and feedstock selection should be tailored to the pro­
ducer country/region. 
2.5. Net-zero with SAF technologies 
SAF mitigates GHG emissions but will not achieve net-zero emissions 
alone with the current 50% blending limit. SAF can be a transitory op­
tion to move from using fossil fuels to other net-zero energy alternatives 
such as green hydrogen, hybrid-electric, or electric aircraft (Dahal et al., 
2021; Michaga et al., 2022). For example, the power-to-liquid (PtL) 
pathway offers a different approach, requiring clean electricity for water 
electrolysis to produce ’green’ hydrogen and CO2 to create e-kerosene in 
an FT process via methanation or methanol synthesis, effectively 
reversing the combustion process. Although the PtL process for e-fuels is 
still in development, the first industrial pilot plant opened in Germany in 
2021, signifying progress in this domain (Becken et al., 2023). With the 
expected prevalence of net-zero and deep decarbonization technologies 
in the future (beyond 2050), SAF may be less competitive regarding 
environmental impacts. Fernanda Rojas-Michaga et al. (Michaga et al., 
2022) investigated adding carbon capture and storage (CCS) to the FT 
process to produce SAF from forestry residues. The inclusion of the CCS 
in the FT biorefinery increased the MJSP from 3.03 £ kg−1 to 3.27 £ kg−1 
and reduced the GHG emissions from 15.51 gCO2eq MJ−1 to −121.83 
gCO2eq MJ−1 (Michaga et al., 2022). Bio-jet fuel fitted with CCS can 
serve as a CO2 removal technology and should be a motivating research 
direction moving forward to ensure the long-term use of SAF. However, 
the limitations of natural sinks and CCS technologies present risks and 
challenges. The competition for land area between SAF production and 
nature-based removal, along with the competition with various carbon 
capture and storage methods, including e-kerosene, deserves more 
attention in aviation roadmaps. Acknowledging the implications of SAF 
usage for decarbonization and permanent carbon removal is vital in 
shaping the future of sustainable aviation fuels (Becken et al., 2023). 
2.6. Co-processing biomass and fossil fuels can de-risk SAF technology 
development 
Within the spectrum of technologies examined in this study, it is 
evident that, aside from HEFA, significant obstacles must be surmounted 
before attaining commercial profitability. Co-processing offers a prag­
matic path forward, allowing companies to supplement a portion of 
conventional petroleum refinery feedstock with biomass that can un­
dergo catalytic hydroprocessing or fluid catalytic cracking. This process 
allows biomass to be integrated with petroleum products within the 
conventional processing and blending framework. Biomass feedstocks 
suitable for co-processing encompass triglycerides containing plant oils, 
waste oils, or animal fats akin to HEFA feedstock. 
The ASTM currently sanctions co-processing via fats, oils, and grease 
(FOG) for blending up to 5% by volume. Several organizations have 
started co-processing, with companies like Parkland (Vancouver, British 
Columbia) and Preem (Gothenburg, Sweden) leading the way. For 
instance, Preem, renowned for pioneering co-processing technologies, 
presently incorporates a biomass lipids ratio of up to 30% and boasts 
successful co-processing ventures with biomass ratios as high as 85% for 
green diesel production (Su et al., 2022). Liu & Yang (2023) show that 
coprocessing FOG can save up to ~8% in GHG emissions with a 5% 
by-volume blending limit. While co-processing may not rival standalone 
SAF technologies like FT or ATJ in terms of emissions reduction, it offers 
companies a financially prudent entry point into SAF technology 
development. Moreover, it serves as an effective hedge against the un­
certainties surrounding future SAF demand and incentives. 
Furthermore, the potential of repurposing traditional refineries to 
standalone SAF refineries presents a compelling avenue. Studies by Su 
et al. (2022) have drawn insightful comparisons between conventional 
petroleum refineries and standalone biorefineries, pinpointing critical 
changes required for this transition. These changes encompass refur­
bishing existing tanks to accommodate diverse feedstocks, establishing 
new pretreatment facilities, and enhancing existing wastewater treat­
ment infrastructure for repurposing. Estimates suggest that repurposing 
efforts, e.g., the Eni biorefinery in Venice, Italy, can amount to 20%– 
25% of the costs of establishing a new greenfield facility. Additionally, 
modeling efforts, such as those conducted by Tanzil et al. (2021b), have 
explored 
integration 
scenarios 
that 
include 
the 
sharing 
of 
non-conversion infrastructures, the co-utilization of conversion and 
non-conversion infrastructures, and the repurposing of idle or shutdown 
petroleum refineries. These endeavors have yielded reductions in min­
imum fuel selling prices, greenhouse gas emissions, and overall process 
costs compared to greenfield approaches. With the global transition 
toward a sustainable future in full swing, repurposing holds promise in 
regions such as the US and Europe, where conventional refining infra­
structure is already in place. 
2.7. Will feedstock availability limit SAF adoption? 
Generally, concerns about feedstock shortages for SAF production 
remain low. Numerous reports and scientific studies estimated biomass 
feedstock availability for SAF production using various methods, 
including spatial (Walter et al., 2021; Cervi et al., 2020; Leila et al., 
2018; Carvalho et al., 2019) and general equilibrium models (Shahriar 
and Khanal, 2022; Ng et al., 2021; Capaz et al., 2021; Wolff and Riefer, 
2020; Staples et al., 2018). These studies collectively suggest an ample 
biomass supply to meet the demand, even considering more sustainable 
biomass sources. Some authors advocate the use of advanced and waste 
feedstock options, including waste and residue lipids, oil trees on 
degraded lands, oil-cover crops, agricultural and forest residues, and 
municipal solid waste, which could potentially yield up to 490 million 
tons of SAF by 2030, surpassing the demand by a significant margin 
(Wolff and Riefer, 2020). 
For instance, Staples et al. (2018) estimate substantial alternative jet 
fuel potential, projecting 225 million tons of SAF by 2050, based on an 
average of conservative scenarios proposed by various authors. HEFA is 
expected to remain the primary SAF production pathway until 2030. 
However, it is important to note that the HEFA process alone, heavily 
reliant on FOG feedstock, possibly leading to feedstock availability 
limitations in the next decade, falls short of delivering the required SAF 
volumes. Additionally, HEFA pathways are estimated to have the 
highest induced land use change (ILUC) emissions, mainly due to the 
direct or indirect linkages to the high deforestation and peat oxidation in 
Southeast Asia from palm expansion (Zhao et al., 2021). Furthermore, 
the HEFA process currently relies on hydrogen from fossil fuels for 
hydrotreatment, with only a small fraction coming from green 
hydrogen. In contrast, newer pathways like FT and ATJ allow for con­
verting more diverse feedstocks into SAF. For instance, Aemetis has 
signed significant SAF agreements using orchard residues in California, 
and LanzaTech processes ethanol feedstock from steel mill waste gases 
in the UK to produce SAF (Becken et al., 2023). 
3. Policy analysis 
3.1. Methodology 
For the policy analysis, a Google Scholar search was conducted using

types of analysis: modeling and simulations (Ebrahimi et al., 2022; Jiang 
and Yang, 2021; Trinh et al., 2021; Rathore et al., 2020; Martinez-Va­
lencia et al., 2021), stakeholder surveys (Ritchie et al., 2020; Ahmad and 
Xu, 2021; Yengin, 2021), and policy summaries and evaluations (Lars­
son et al., 2019; Shahriar and Khanal, 2022; Ng et al., 2021; Agencia de 
Informaci´
on Paraguaya, 2022; Commonwealth of Australia, 2017; IEA, 
2017; Reynoso and Montes, 2016; State Council of People’s Republic of 
China, 2022; Nystr¨
om et al., 2019; ICAO, 2023; Wang et al., 2021; 
G¨
ossling and Lyle, 2021). 
The International Civil Aviation Organization’s (ICAO) policy sum­
mary (ICAO, 2023) identified 30 global aviation policies. Three of these 
policies pertained to international or regional regulations, while the 
remaining policies were in development or adopted by 20 different 
countries. Subsequently, 17 countries with SAF facilities that were not 
listed in ICAO’s policy summary were identified, based on the review by 
Nystr¨
om et al. (2019). A two-step approach was followed to assess 
policies for sustainable aviation fuels in these 17 countries: (i) a Google 
Scholar search, which yielded ten relevant results; however, none of 
them mentioned specific policies for sustainable aviation fuel, and (ii) an 
examination of government websites of each country. Searching gov­
ernment websites revealed seven additional policies in six countries: 
Australia, China, Mexico, Panama, Paraguay, and the United States 
(Agencia de Informacion Paraguaya, 2022; Commonwealth of Australia, 
2017; Reynoso and Montes, 2016; State Council of People’s Republic of 
China, 2022; ICAO, 2022). 
Table 4 summarizes SAF policies, categorized as direct or indirect 
monetary incentives. Indirect monetary-based policies are further clas­
sified as cap-and-trade targets and blending mandates. The classification 
of direct monetary-based policies follows Wang et al.’s framework 
(Wang et al., 2021), which outlines four instruments: output-based in­
centives, feedstock subsidies, capital subsidies, and price subsidies. It is 
important to note that initiatives supporting SAF at non-governmental 
levels are essential but are not detailed in Table 4 (Shahriar and Kha­
nal, 2022; Ng et al., 2021). 
3.2. Current policies to promote SAF 
Policy-focused papers are categorized into three groups: modeling 
SAF incentives, surveys of stakeholder perceptions, and SAF policy de­
tails. Modeling SAF incentives allows authors to compare aspects of SAF 
policies and their impact on SAF development (Ebrahimi et al., 2022; 
Jiang and Yang, 2021; Trinh et al., 2021; Rathore et al., 2020; Marti­
nez-Valencia et al., 2021). Survey papers explore stakeholder attitudes 
and concerns about SAF policies (Ritchie et al., 2020; Ahmad and Xu, 
2021; Yengin, 2021). The third group of papers reviews existing or 
proposed SAF policies, such as the European Union Emissions Trading 
System (EU ETS) and the ICAO’s Carbon Offset and Reduction Scheme 
for International Aviation (CORSIA) (Larsson et al., 2019; G¨
ossling and 
Lyle, 2021). 
The ICAO has compiled a compendium of 30 distinct policies pro­
moting SAF (ICAO, 2023). Furthermore, this review has identified an 
additional seven resolutions from countries including Australia, China, 
Mexico, Panama, Paraguay, and the United States (Shahriar and Khanal, 
2022; Agencia de Informaci´
on Paraguaya, 2022; Commonwealth of 
Australia, 2017; IEA, 2017; Reynoso and Montes, 2016; State Council of 
People’s Republic of China, 2022), resulting in a global aggregate of 
approximately 37 policies devised to advance SAF adoption. Among 
these, 35 are regional or country-specific, with the remaining two 
operating internationally. Notably, 30 of these policies are in Europe 
and the Americas, as presented in Figs. 4 and 6. 
Fig. 5 summarizes policies categorized by their mechanisms, 
encompassing output-based subsidies, feedstock subsidies, capital sub­
sidies, and price subsidies. Output-based subsidies involve fiscal in­
centives based on the volume or type of fuels produced and sold, often 
rooted in market and regulatory motivations. An example of such a 
policy is California’s Low Carbon Fuel Standard (LCFS), which

distributes credits determined by the carbon intensity score of renew­
able jet fuels. Feedstock subsidies offer financial benefits to reduce 
operating costs for feedstock or support feedstock producers, exempli­
fied by Brazil’s National Biokerosene Program and South Africa’s 
research and development (R&D), which foster research and biomass- 
based energy production. On the other hand, capital subsidies grant 
one-time monetary support for facility construction, as observed in the 
US Sustainable Aviation Tax Credit policy, aimed at reducing costs and 
accelerating domestic sustainable aviation fuel production. 
Additionally, price subsidy policies, e.g., the Investment in Illinois 
Act, provide discounts on SAF prices. Currently, cap-and-trade policies 
and SAF blending mandates represent the most prevalent approaches, 
encompassing voluntary and market-based mechanisms, as exemplified 
by policies in Portugal, Norway, France, Denmark, and ICAO regula­
tions. G¨
ossling and Lyle (2021) mention “indirect” policy types, for 
example, additional taxes on flight tickets corresponding to carbon 
emissions; however, no such cases are reported in peer-reviewed liter­
ature. Voluntary initiatives like Qantas’ Fly Carbon Neutral program 
allow customers to offset flight emissions through ticket purchases. 
Larsson et al. (2019) also mention tax on fossil jet fuel to decrease 
emissions and finance the public sector, as done in Japan and Norway. 
3.3. Are existing policies sufficient? 
Challenges emerge concerning existing SAF policies. The first per­
tains to policies offering monetary incentives for SAF, comprising only 
38% of identified policies, which play a pivotal role in the economic 
viability of biofuels. This is crucial since technical SAF production 
pathways tend to be economically feasible only when subsidies are 
applied, as shown in Section 2. The International Energy Agency (IEA) 
estimates that commercial aviation biofuel costs, on average, exceed 
fossil-based jet fuel production costs by 155% (IEA, 2020). In contrast, 
our analysis indicates that depending on the technology (e.g., HEFA to 
HFS–SIP), SAF costs range from 120% to 700% higher than fossil-based 
jet fuels (see Table 3 and Fig. 2). Even when SAF is blended with fossil 
aviation fuel according to blending mandates in non-competitive set­
tings, its costly production inflates flight ticket prices. Thus, these pol­
icies become essential in narrowing the price gap and facilitating 
commercial SAF adoption. 
The second issue concerns the anticipated surge in SAF demand 
driven by carbon-target policies. Coupling this SAF demand surge with 
minimal monetary incentives, an imbalance between airlines that need 
to buy SAF and companies willing to invest in producing SAF is ex­
pected. Fig. 6 illustrates the geographical distribution of SAF incentive 
policies alongside the number of operational SAF production facilities. 
In this context, we exclude policies that do not go beyond the CORSIA 
scheme, even if voluntary. As elaborated in the next section, countries 
must significantly bolster their demand to reach untapped installed ca­
pacity to meet the CO2 emission targets in the near term (present - 
2030). 
3.4. Interdependence of technology economics and policy 
Fig. 6 reveals a strong correspondence between the existence of 
policies in a specific region and the location of planned and operational 
SAF facilities. As previously discussed, this relationship is primarily 
attributed to the inherently elevated costs associated with SAF produc­
tion, rendering them economically unviable without accompanying 
financial incentives. While existing techno-economic analyses in the 
literature generally acknowledge the pivotal role of policies, quantita­
tive assessments are relatively scarce. A few studies have quantitatively 
assessed the impact of monetary incentives as producer credits, such as 
renewable identification numbers (RINS) and LCFS (Nguyen and Tyner, 
2022; Bann et al., 2017; Alam et al., 2021). Furthermore, other studies 
integrating TEA and policy design quantify minimum incentive values or 
structures to improve the probability of positive NPVs (Diniz et al., 
2018; Ebrahimi et al., 2022). These instances exemplify the significance 
of policy influence on SAF technologies; however, integrating quanti­
tative analyses to elucidate the nexus between economics, environ­
mental impact, and policy remains an open research question. 
4. Market analysis 
4.1. Methodology 
The market analysis covered the period from 2015 to 2023. A Google 
Scholar internet search resulted in 24 publications using the following 
keywords: "sustainable aviation fuels," "bio-jet fuel," "market," "future 
market," "demand," and "production." Eleven publications were included 
in the analysis. Six reports and seven peer-reviewed scientific papers 
were excluded due to the absence of quantitative information regarding 
SAF demand, supply, or capacity. Each publication was assigned a 
Source ID for reference in the visual analysis. 
SAF market forecasts encompass key quantitative metrics, including 
capacity, demand, and production. The sources chosen for our analysis 
include the following: SkyNRG, IRENA, IEA Task-39, WEF, CIT Indus­
triell Energi, and scientific studies by Bauen et al. (2020), Abrantes et al. 
(2021), and Fulton et al. (2015). These sources presented SAF capacity, 
production, and demand data with different timeframes and technology

insights. Demand information was derived from IEA’s World Energy 
Outlook (WEO) and Renewables Analysis (IEARen). Production data 
originated from IRENA’s World Energy Transition Outlook and IEA’s 
Task-39. Detailed descriptions of each information source are listed in 
Table 5. To ensure consistency in units, production, capacity, and de­
mand data were converted using an energy density of 34.146 MJ L−1 and 
a fuel density of 0.804 kg L−1 (Kallio et al., 2014). For references 
reporting HEFA capacity, a factor of 0.5 (IEA, 2021b) was applied to 
represent the approximate jet fraction, as HEFA produces other liquid 
fuels like renewable diesel. These analyses underpin discussions and 
conclusions regarding future demand, idle capacity, and policy 
effectiveness.

various technologies. An average capacity line is included to aid in 
analysis. 
Notably, capacity data varies significantly across references, partic­
ularly in forecasts of future installed capacity and the technical feasi­
bility of SAF production. Data discrepancies up to 2020 are notably 
influenced by the prevalence of the HEFA process, as seen in sources like 
WEF, Task-39, and the SkyNRG database for 2020. In Fig. 7, WEF pro­
vides valuable insights into HEFA’s actual utilization for SAF and its 
additional potential (additional HEFA, yellow bars) for SAF production, 
considering HEFA’s technical limitations. Comparatively, SkyNRG and 
Task-39 data exceeds WEF’s projections for future installed capacity. 
SkyNRG projections, influenced by industry announcements and 
modeling results, are less certain beyond 2023. Furthermore, SkyNRG, 
as a SAF company, differs from WEF and Task-39, with its predictions 
heavily reliant on as-yet-unadopted policies, such as the EU’s envisioned 
SAF blending mandate of up to 63% in 2050 (SkyNRG. SAF Market 
Outlook, 2021). 
From 2010 to 2027, SAF’s average capacity is expected to increase 
38-fold. The period up to 2021 has seen a considerable surge in installed 
capacity with technical potential for SAF production, marking a 700% 
increase. The most substantial annual increase occurred from 2010 to 
2011, with a 125% capacity rise, aligning with the initiation of opera­
tional Neste HEFA plants in The Netherlands and Singapore, each 
boasting a 1.4 billion-liter per year capacity (including renewable 
diesel) (Nystr¨
om et al., 2019). Subsequently, a 62% increase was pro­
jected from 2021 to 2022, attributed to the expansion of Neste plants in 
Singapore and The Netherlands, with a capacity of 1.8 billion liters per 
year (IEA, 2021b). However, only the Singapore expansion was 
completed, with The Netherlands’ share of expansion postponed to 2026 
(Neste, 2023). 
Regarding technology, HEFA is expected to maintain a significant 
role throughout the timeline, consistent with findings from techno- 
economic analyses. Bauen et al. (2020) reported 37 million liters per 
year of operational capacity and 129 million liters per year from alter­
native technologies (including gasification, pyrolysis, direct sugars to 
hydrocarbons, hydrothermal liquefaction, and power to liquids); other 
references only indicate the emergence of non-HEFA technologies, 
commencing in 2021 (IEA, 2021b) or 2022 (Wolff and Riefer, 2020; 
SkyNRG. SAF Market Outlook, 2021), particularly with the introduction

Fig. 8 illustrates average capacity trends from 2010 to 2027 along­
side current and projected SAF demand up to 2026 and 2075, depending 
on the information source. IRENA and IEA report demands under 
various scenarios. The Net Zero Emissions (NZE) scenario refers to the 
global energy sector achieving net zero CO2 emissions by 2050. The 
Announced Pledges Scenario (APS) takes account of all the climate 
commitments made by governments around the world, including na­
tionally determined contributions and long-term net-zero targets, and 
assumes that they will be met in full and on time. The Stated Policies 
Scenario (STEPS) provides a more conservative benchmark for the 
future, considering only existing policies and policies under develop­
ment (IEA, 2021a). Complementary, Fulton et al. (2015) modeled the 
need for biofuels in aviation to reach the 2 ◦C increase scenario. For 
2030 and 2050, the authors’ projections fall on almost half of IEA 
forecasts. The authors, however, are the only source of information for 
2075, showing a need for 368 billion liters per year of SAF to limit global 
warming to 2 ◦C. 
Fig. 8 highlights that the historical (blue line) demand is an order of 
magnitude less than the historical installed capacity (black dashed line). 
This lag is primarily due to elevated consumer fuel prices and 
economically advantageous alternatives like renewable diesel. Conse­
quently, implementing monetary incentives is imperative to harness 
existing capacity and stimulate SAF consumption. 
Considering the existing capacities and policy landscape, the APS 
demand scenario (depicted by the red line in Fig. 8) emerges as the most 
probable outcome, forecasting an additional 91 million liters per year in 
technical installed capacity by 2030 compared to the projected 2027 
capacity level. As previously discussed, prevailing monetary-based 
policies incentivize capacity expansion by offering credits to SAF pro­
ducers. However, the current demand falls short by a factor of twenty. In 
practical terms, the absence of policies promoting SAF adoption poses a 
significant hurdle to achieving even the more modest 2030 emissions 
targets and sustainability objectives (Fulton et al., 2015).

Furthermore, the more aggressive STEPS (orange line) and NZE 
(green line) scenarios require a 101% (19,710 million liters) and 235% 
(45,868 million liters) increase in capacity, respectively, to guarantee 
meeting projected SAF demand in 2030. Similarly, for STEPS and NZE, 
current demand is behind by factors of 40 and 60, respectively. This 
indicates the gap between pledges (STEPS) and actual policies in place 
(APS) regarding climate actions based on the IEA WEO. Moreover, the 
NZE scenario would require considerable incentives to be achieved 
based on the current historical capacity trends. 
4.4. Policy and market interactions 
Fig. 9 depicts SAF production trends from 2007 to 2021 alongside 
yearly policy counts, both adopted and under development. Notably, 
SAF production (Fig. 9) lags significantly behind projected capacity 
(Fig. 7). For instance, in 2018, while the average capacity stood at 2.5 
billion liters per year, actual production reached just 6.7 million liters, 
equivalent to 0.3% of the installed capacity. A notable surge in pro­
duction occurred between 2018 and 2019 when Neste contributed 
approximately 125 million liters of SAF (IEA, 2021b). Remarkably, 2021 
marked the highest SAF production at 3.5% of the installed technical 
capacity. 
Fig. 9 also reveals a two to three-year lag between policy adoption 
and increased SAF production. Initial SAF policies were instituted be­
tween 2011 and 2013 in the US, Europe, and Asia. Europe integrated 
aviation emissions into the EU emissions trading system, requiring 
emissions tracking and reporting. Indonesia introduced a SAF mandate, 
specifying 2% bio jet fuel blending in 2016, with subsequent targets of 
3% by 2020 and 5% by 2025. ICAO (ICAO, 2022) noted that the 2016 
goal was not met due to national circumstances, but Indonesia’s oil 
producer committed to commence production by late 2018. These policy 
actions corresponded with the first observed rise in SAF production in 
2016, followed by a substantial increase in 2019. 
Between 2020 and 2021, 14 policies were introduced, potentially 
leading to another significant capacity upturn (ICAO, 2023). However, 
this observation indicates correlation rather than causation. Research 
opportunities exist to explore causal inferences regarding policy impact 
on capacity and production, along with economy-wide modeling to 
ascertain subsidy levels. 
In the short to medium term (present-2040), the economic viability 
of sustainable aviation fuels (SAFs) relies on financial incentives and 
government policies. Today, about 38% of existing policies are finan­
cially driven, while the remaining 62% set carbon emission limits, 
indirectly promoting carbon reduction. Indirect policies such as 
blending mandates and carbon tax play a significant role in driving SAF 
demand, but the lack of monetary incentives creates an imbalance in 
supply. In the medium term, these consumption-based incentives are 
expected to boost SAF demand significantly, potentially surpassing 
production capacity. 
This demand gap underscores the urgent need for monetary in­
centives and policy frameworks to offset the high SAF production costs, 
encouraging utilization. SAFs currently have higher operating costs due 
to underdeveloped biomass supply chains. Feedstock subsidies, consti­
tuting 60% of existing monetary-based incentives, aim to address this 
issue. However, these subsidies are complex and do not always reduce 
biomass expenses. Additionally, because of the growing social and 
environmental concerns around “food vs. fuel,” many feedstock sub­
sidies focus on using advanced, non-food-based biomass, which tradi­
tionally has more complex pretreatment and technological challenges. 
The current policies are a step in the right direction, but there is still a 
significant gap in cost that is yet to be overcome. Thus, there is an op­
portunity to more closely couple techno-economic analysis of SAF pro­
cesses and supply chains with economic modeling to understand the 
impacts of different incentive structures to guide policymakers. 
4.5. Emerging global supply chains 
Furthermore, global supply chains are essential for SAF adoption. 
Transportation may become prohibitive if the SAF production facilities 
are far from the consumers (i.e., airports). For example, fossil refineries 
supply large jet fuel consumers through installed, cost- and carbon- 
efficient pipelines. The construction of such an infrastructure for SAF 
is not widely considered in current research or incentivized via policy. 
Global airlines will likely focus on using up to 50% SAF blends in re­
gions/countries with desirable infrastructure. For example, Brazil was 
one of the first countries to use biomass fuels in the 1970s and is 
currently the second-largest producer of the world’s bioethanol from the 
sugarcane industry (Li et al., 2022). We see an opportunity for Brazil to 
become an early global leader in SAF production from sugarcane and in 
the operation of aircraft fleets with high concentrations of blended SAF 
(Capaz et al., 2021; Cervi et al., 2020; Escalante et al., 2022). Similarly, 
based on policy concentration and SAF facilities in Fig. 6, we expect the 
US and Europe to be instrumental in the SAF transition. Global airlines 
can take lessons learned in Brazil, the US, and Europe and scale up 
globally to meet 2050 sustainability goals. 
Beyond government and organizational policy implementation, in an 
increasingly environmentally conscious society, there are public re­
lations (PR) incentives for airline companies to consume SAF. However, 
with the costs of SAF still above the cost of conventional fossil-based jet 
fuel, airline companies must be willing to pay a premium to reach 
company-wide PR goals. A premium price for SAF can be a monetary 
incentive for SAF producers, leading to more strategic development of 
SAF capacity globally. United, Cathay Pacific, Southwest Airlines, 
British Airways, Lufthansa, Qantas, and JetBlue have already estab­
lished agreements with biofuel suppliers to start receiving some volume 
of SAF to blend with conventional fossil-based jet fuel (Ng et al., 2021). 
5. Conclusions 
This review evaluates SAF production’s economic and environ­
mental aspects, policies, and market landscapes. We highlight SAF’s role 
in meeting sustainability goals and key adoption factors. Achieving 2050 
GHG targets in aviation depends on addressing these challenges, leading 
to four identified research directions at the intersection of technology 
development, policy, and markets: 
How to reduce SAF costs and carbon footprint while expanding the 
market? Our analysis shows SAF costs at least 120% higher than

2022 (black line, right axis).

conventional jet fuel, yet it aligns with global climate objectives and 
facilitates a transition to renewable sources. SAF can leverage policies 
mandating greenhouse gas reductions, regional fuel chains, and aviation 
emissions commitments; however, challenges exist, including inade­
quate financial support, feedstock competition, land constraints, and 
costly scale-up. Developing realistic roadmaps for SAF technologies, 
addressing regional differences, and fostering collaboration among 
producers, airlines, and policymakers are crucial for meeting 2050 
sustainability targets. 
What are the prospects for SAF beyond 2050? Projected demands for 
2050 sustainability goals could require significant renewable resources. 
Evaluating SAF alongside other aviation decarbonization options such as 
direct air capture (DAC), hydrogen fuel, and electrification is crucial. 
Long-term strategies like integrating carbon capture or transitioning to 
waste feedstocks may enhance SAF’s longevity. Additionally, it is critical 
to understand the role of SAF beyond 2050 within a deeply decarbonized 
global economy. 
How to standardize guidelines for assessing SAF technologies? Inconsis­
tent TEA and LCA methodologies hinder direct comparisons and reli­
ability. Urgent action is needed to establish consistent guidelines. 
CORSIA offers a starting point for internationally adopted GHG emission 
calculations. Furthermore, considering geographical factors and feed­
stock choices is essential for fair comparisons. 
How to integrate TEA and LCA with SAF policy? Inadequate monetary 
incentives (only 38% of existing policies) hinder adoption despite gov­
ernment initiatives. Integrating TEA and LCA with SAF policy may aid in 
policy designs for attractive SAF investments, setting emissions thresh­
olds for CO2 penalization, and addressing long-term subsidy 
uncertainties.

Abstract: Developing production technology pathways of sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) that align
with China’s national conditions and aviation transportation needs is crucial for promoting the SAF
industry and achieving China’s carbon peak and carbon neutrality goals. This article ﬁrst projects
the future SAF demand in China for the coming decades. Using SAF demand data as an input,
this article employs the TOPSIS analysis method to comprehensively evaluate the suitability of
four SAF production technology pathways at different stages of development in China, which are
Hydroprocessed Esters and Fatty Acids (HEFA), Alcohol-to-Jet (AtJ), Natural Gas + Fischer–Tropsch
Synthesis (G + FT), and Power-to-Liquid (PtL). The research results reveal the following trends:
HEFA-based processes are the most suitable technology pathways for China in the near term; the
G + FT route, based on energy crops, appears the most likely to support civil aviation needs in the
medium to long term. In the long run, the PtL route holds signiﬁcant potential, especially with the
decreasing costs of green electricity, advancements in carbon capture, utilization, and storage (CCUS)
technology, and improvements in SAF synthesis methods. In the ﬁnal section of this article, we
provide recommendations to drive the development of the SAF industry in China.

1. Introduction
The aviation industry is widely considered to have emissions reduction challenges
because aircraft operations depend strongly on fossil fuels, the aviation infrastructure faces
persistent carbon lock-in, and ﬂeet turnover is rather slow [1]. In the aviation industry,
carbon reduction measures mainly include developing new aircraft and engine technologies
with better fuel efﬁciency, enhancing operational efﬁciency in the air and on the ground,
and utilizing sustainable aviation fuel (SAF), hydrogen, electricity, and other alternative
energy sources. Among these, SAF can be directly blended with aviation kerosene without
requiring signiﬁcant changes to aircraft engines, airframes, or ground infrastructure. It
represents the most commercially applicable measure for emission reduction in the short to
medium term within the aviation industry [2]. Assessments by international organizations,
such as the International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO), the International Air Trans-
port Association (IATA), and the Air Transport Action Group (ATAG), indicate that SAF

has a decarbonization potential exceeding 55% [3,4]. SAF refers to aviation fuel made from
renewable resources or waste materials, certiﬁed for safety and sustainability. Its lifecycle
greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions can be reduced by over 50% compared to traditional fossil
fuels. It can even achieve negative carbon emissions. The signiﬁcant emission reduction
potential drives the potential consumer market of SAF. In 2021, global SAF consumption
reached 125 million liters, accounting for only 0.55% of global aviation fuel usage in that
year [5,6]. This still falls short of the requirements for large-scale applications. The main
obstacle to scaling up SAF application is its low cost-effectiveness. Currently, SAF costs
and prices are approximately 2–4-fold higher than traditional aviation kerosene, posing
a cost burden that will overwhelm ﬁnancially weak airlines [7]. Reducing SAF costs and
prices is crucial for increasing SAF usage, enhancing carbon reduction efforts in the aviation
industry, and helping the industry achieve carbon peaking and neutrality.
The production technologies associated with biofuels are incredibly diverse, encompassing
variable pressure and adsorption technology [8], Alcohol-to-Jet fuel (ATJ) technology [9,10],
catalytic hydrothermal decomposition technology [9], hydrodepolymerization of cellulose
technology [9], gas-to-jet fuel technology, gas fermentation processes [11,12], direct disaccharide-
to-jet fuel technology [9], aqueous-phase reforming technology [13–15], etc. The use of renew-
able bioresources for aviation fuel production holds great promise for the aviation industry,
offering a means to reduce its reliance on fossil fuels and achieve carbon emission reduction
goals. While various studies have focused on the techno-economic evaluation of specific SAF
production routes to assess their costs and environmental impacts [16–19], there is a noticeable
dearth of research directly comparing the economic viability of these different technology
routes in China.
The cost structure of SAF includes raw material and additive costs, ﬁxed asset in-
vestments, and transportation and storage costs, with raw material costs and ﬁxed asset
investments being the main driving factors of SAF cost [20–22]. Different production
technology pathways have signiﬁcant heterogeneity in raw material requirements and the
necessary ﬁxed asset investments, resulting in cost and price differences. As the world’s
largest developing country and a net importer of energy and crops, China faces the dual
tasks of improving energy and food governance. Thus, China’s selection of SAF raw ma-
terials and preparation processes must consider multiple aspects, such as food security,
energy security, social development, and resource conservation. It requires comprehensive
governance that integrates food, energy, and climate security, promoting the sustainable
development of the industry and the economy. SAF production technology pathways that
align with China’s national conditions and meet the needs of aviation transport are crucial
for promoting the development of China’s SAF industry and achieving carbon peaking
and carbon neutrality.
In order to determine SAF production technology pathways that align with China’s
national conditions, this study centers on assessing the suitability of four sustainable
aviation fuel (SAF) production technology pathways, HEFA, AtJ, G + FT, and PtL, at various
developmental stages within China. These four types of technology routes are currently
widely recognized by the aviation industry as having greater development prospects in the
future, and are also areas of focus for major global fuel providers. The outcomes of this
article will provide essential input for SAF production companies and ﬁnancing entities
to implement investing analysis, as well as for local government to formulate supporting
policies. The remainder of this article is organized as follows. Section 2 utilizes the grey
model to segmentally predict the future SAF demand in China, which is a vital data input
for the techno-economic assessment of the SAF production routes. Section 3 introduces
the application of TOPSIS to assess the suitability of the SAF production routes in China
across various time periods. Section 4 shows the results and discuss the ﬁndings. Section 5

2. SAF Demand Prediction
In order to calculate China’s SAF demand, we constructed a SAF demand calculation
model, as shown in Equation (1):
Demandsaf =
ITS −ITStarget
 × TKM × CRSsaf ÷ EF ÷ LERR
(1)
where Demandsaf is the annual demand volume of SAF, ITS is the annual carbon intensity
and ITStarget is the controlled target of annual carbon intensity, TKM is the annual air trans-
port turnover which is measured with the ton-kilometer, CRSsaf is the emission reduction
potentiality share of SAF, EF is the carbon emission factor of aviation fuel, and LERR is
the lifecycle emission reduction value of SAF which is measured with the percentage of
the lifecycle emission. TKM forecasting is an essential step in SAF demand prediction as
illustrated in Equation (1). We ﬁrstly project the TKM in China by 2050 and calculate the
SAF demand, subsequently.
2.1. Projection of Air Transport Turnover
Civil aviation transportation is greatly affected by macroeconomic development. The
relevant macroeconomic factors can be divided into two categories: demand-motivated
factors (foreign trade, tourism demand and industrial structure, etc.) and purchasing power
factors (per capita purchasing power, effective purchasing power and overall purchasing
power) [23]. We examine the correlation between China’s TKM and macroeconomic indica-
tors, such as gross domestic product (GDP), GDP per capita, value of tertiary industry as a
percentage of GDP, urbanization rate, disposable income per capita, total import and export
of goods, and international and domestic tourism revenue from 2001 to 2019. The Pearson
correlation coefﬁcients are illustrated in Table 1, indicating that the correlation relationship
between TKM and GDP is the strongest. Considering the maturity of GDP forecasting, the
difﬁculty of other inﬂuencing factors estimation and the strong correlation with GDP, this
paper utilizes the quantitative relationship between GDP and TKM to project China’s air
transport turnover.

2.1.1. The Segmented Ensemble Prediction Mode
The linear prediction value (Lt) of the actual value of TKM (Yt) can be calculated
through the unitary linear regression model of TKM and GDP. Actual deviation rate (Et)
between Yt and Lt can be calculated using Equation (2).
Et = Yt −Lt
Yt
(2)
Equation (2) can be changed the form to Equation (3) and indicates that both Lt and Et
will affect the prediction accuracy of Yt. In order to improve the accuracy of long-period
forecasting and solve the problem that the traditional linear regression equation forecasting
will produce large deviation, we construct a segmented ensemble prediction mode of Lt
and Et.
Yt =
Lt
1 −Et

First step: Linear regression prediction. We make use of historical data from 1978
to 2022 to construct a linear regression equation L(1978–2022) between TKM and GDP of
China’s civil aviation. Then, L(1978, 2022) is utilized to calculate Lt from 1978 to 2022.
Second step: Actual deviation rate prediction. First, we calculate the actual deviation
rate Et between Yt and Lt from 1978 to 2022. Subsequently, the gray prediction model is
used to construct the actual deviation rate prediction models, which are E(1978–1987) for
the period from 1978 to 1987, E(1988–1997) for the period from 1988 to 1997, E(1998–2007)
for the period from 1998 to 2007 and E(2008–2022) for the period from 2008–2022. Then,
we make use of the actual deviation rate prediction models to calculate the prediction
deviation rate et.
Third step: Calculate the ensemble prediction value (yt) of historical air transport
turnover for the period from 2008 to 2022. The calculation formula of the yt is shown in
Equation (4).
yt =
Lt
1 −et
(4)
Fourth step: Forecasting the air transport turnover. China’s national economic and
social development planning is based on a ﬁve-year planning period. In view of this, we
divide the period 2023–2050 into six phases, namely, 2023–2025, 2026–2030, 2031–2035,
2036–2040, 2041–2045 and 2046–2050, and forecast the air transport turnover in stages. First,
the annual projected GDP of the period from 2023 to 2025 is introduced into the previous
stage linear regression equation L(1978–2022) to obtain Lt for the period from 2023 to 2025.
Then, E(2008–2022) of the previous period is used to calculate an approximation Et′ of
the actual deviation rate Et for the period from 2023 to 2025, and make use of the Et′ to
construct the deviation rate projection model E(2023–2025) for the period from 2023 to
2025. Subsequently, the forecast deviation rate (et) is calculated using E(2023–2025) and the
ensemble prediction value (yt) from 2023 to 2025 can also be valued through Equation (3).
Finally, L(2023–2025) is constructed using yt and projected GDP for the period from 2023
to 2025, for the purpose to carry out projections of the next period from 2026 to 2030.
We repeat the process period by period to project the air transport turnover for the next
few decades.
2.1.2. Segmented Ensemble Prediction of Air Transport Turnover
According to the steps described in Section 2.1.1, L(1978–2022) is constructed which
is illustrated in Equation (5), and the hypothesis testing results are shown in Table 2.
Annual data of China’s air transport turnover are obtained from the Civil Aviation Statistics
Yearbook of China. Annual GDP sourced from the National Bureau of Statistics.
L(1978–2022) = 481480.347 + 10.61 × GDP

Then, we implement grey estimating and deviation rate prediction model of 1978–1987,
1988–1997, 1998–2007, and 2008–2022, are illustrated from Equation (6) to Equation (9).
E(1978 −1987) = 88.024 ∗exp−0.183(t−1) −104.422

(8)
E(2008 −2022) = −1.177 ∗exp−0.118(t−1) −1.304
(9)
Using the above equations, we calculate the ensemble forecast value of China’s air
transport turnover from 1978 to 2022. The results show that the average deviation rate
between the actual air transport turnover (Yt) and ensemble prediction value (yt) during
the period of 1978–2022 is 0.11, whereas the average deviation rate between Yt and the
linear forecast value (Lt) is 2.2. Therefore, the segmented ensemble prediction mode can
substantially improve the accuracy of long-term transportation turnover prediction.
In 2023, China’s target for GDP growth is 5% [24]. The World Bank also holds a
positive and optimistic attitude towards China’s economic development after the pandemic
and raise its forecast for China’s GDP growth rate in 2023 to 5.1% [25]. As a result, we
assume that China’s GDP growth rate will maintain an average annual growth rate of 5%
from 2023 to 2025. After 2026, the GDP growth rate will reasonably slow down and we
assume GDP growth rate will remain an average annual growth rate of 4.8%, 4.5% and
4.3% for the period from 2026 to 2030, from 2031 to 2035 and from 2036 to 2040, respectively.
Afterwards, we assume the average annual growth rate will decrease by 0.1% every ﬁve
years. Based on the assumption of the GDP growth rate, we calculate the projected value
of China’s GDP from 2023 to 2050 and air transport turnover. The prediction process and
results are shown in Table 3 and Figure 1, respectively.

Taking the average carbon emission intensity of 0.928 kg/RTK during the “13th Five-

civil aviation if no effective emission reduction measures are implemented. We use it as the
emission baseline.
During the “14th Five-Year Plan” period, China’s major airlines (which account for
over 90% of the industry’s total TKM) are expected to achieve an average annual car-
bon intensity reduction at a rate of no more than 0.5%. After 2026, with the continuous
optimization of operational emission reduction technology, the annual carbon intensity
reduction rate is expected to increase. However, due to the gradual aging of the ﬂeet,
China’s civil aviation carbon intensity is expected to decline continuously at a rate not
exceeding 0.5% annually from 2026 to 2030, reaching 0.8826 kg/RTK by 2030. Considering
further optimization of operational emission reduction technology and a new round of
renewal cycle of the ﬂeet after 2030, carbon intensity of China’s civil aviation may be greatly
decreased. We assume the portion of China’s air transport emission compared with the
baseline emission after 2030, will meet the level of the ICAO’s prediction [26].
The IATA proposed a fuel efﬁciency goal of annual average improvement of 1.5% [25],
which is similar to the ICAO’s prediction [26]. China’s civil aviation industry aims to
realize peak carbon emissions by 2035 [26]. With the fuel efﬁciency goal proposed by the
IATA, we calculated the annual control target of carbon emission until 2035 and assume
annual emissions will decrease proportionally to zero, achieving carbon neutrality from
2036 to 2060.
Based on the above calculation results and reasonable assumptions, this study calcu-
lates the carbon emission reduction to be realized by China’s civil aviation through SAF
and market-based measures (hereinafter referred to as SAF-M), as illustrated in Figure 2.

“14th Five-Year Plan” Period, the industry-wide use of SAF should reach 20,000 tons by 
2025, equivalent to 0.05% of the industry’s fuel consumption [26]. To promote the civil 
aviation industry’s realization of carbon peaking and carbon neutrality, the National De-
velopment and Reform Commission, Ministry of Science and Technology, National En-
ergy Administration, and Civil Aviation Administration, among others, have successively 
put forward policies and measures to support the research and production of biomass 
aviation kerosene [26–29]. This will facilitate the development of China’s SAF industry 
and drive the large-scale production and utilization of SAF. Furthermore, the Special

as the ICAO analysis [5]: 7% (2024–2030); 20% (2031–2040); 46% (2041–2050).
The EF (emission factor) for aviation kerosene is 3.15 tons of carbon per ton of fuel [31].
We also assumed that the lifecycle emission reduction ratio of SAF used in China’s civil
aviation can reach 80% due to improvements in research and production technologies.
Subsequently, this study calculates the SAF demand from 2024 to 2050 for China’s civil

China’s civil aviation in 2050 is estimated to be 36.92 million tons. The total SAF demand

In this section, we make use of the TOPSIS (Technique for Order Preference by Simi-
larity to Ideal Solution) method to assess the applicability of the technological pathways 
at different stages in China. TOPSIS was introduced by C.L. Hwang and K. Yoon in 1981 
[32], which has become a widely adopted approach in multi-objective decision analysis. 
This method is primarily employed to identify practical solutions that represent both op-
timal and worst-case scenarios, achieved through the normalization of the original data 
matrix. Subsequently, a formula is applied to calculate the distances between the evalua-
tion objects and the optimal and worst-case solutions. This process yields the proximity 
of each evaluation object to the optimal solution, forming the basis for quality evaluation 
[33,34]. 
3.1. Technology Pathways for SAF Production 
As of October 2021, nine technology pathways for SAF production have been certified 
by American Society for Testing and Materials (ASTM) standards—seven by ASTM D7566 
and two by ASTM D1655. This study focuses on three technology pathways that produce 
aviation fuels—HEFA, Gas+Fischer–Tropsch (G + FT), and AtJ—and one uncertified path-
way—PtL (Power-to-Liquid). Currently, there are two synthetic pathways for PtL (Power-
to-Liquid) fuel production. They are the Fischer–Tropsch synthesis method and the metha-
nol synthesis method. The PtL route has obtained ASTM approval when using the Fischer–
Tropsch synthesis, but the methanol pathway has not yet received approval [35–37]. These

The AtJ (Alcohol-to-Jet) route centers on the production of SAF from alcohol [41].
This alcohol source can be derived from biomass, including those with sugar and
starch or lignocellulosic content, such as crops like corn and sugarcane. Notably, two
alcohol types, isobutanol and ethanol, have received certiﬁcation for SAF produc-
tion in accordance with ASTM speciﬁcations. The AtJ route, utilizing isobutanol as
the feedstock, has obtained certiﬁcation from ASTM D7566 in April 2016 [42], and

ethanol was added as an approved feedstock for the AtJ route from ASTM D1655 in

other by-products) to feedstock inputs) of 13%. SAF accounts for 77% of the total
production in this pathway (SAF overall yield (SAF overall yield: This refers to the
ratio of SAF produced to total output)) [44]. The availability of raw materials varies
signiﬁcantly between countries and regions. For example, the abovementioned crops
provide stable and abundant sources of raw materials in countries with vast agricul-
tural land—the United States and Brazil. Thus, AtJ is the main promoted technology
pathway for SAF production in these countries. However, the availability of such raw
materials is limited in China.
2.
The PtL pathway primarily utilizes green electricity, hydrogen, and carbon capture,
utilization, and sequestration (CCUS) to produce SAF. The entire process chain for plat-
inum liquefaction (Power-to-Liquid) fuel production should rely entirely on electricity
sourced from renewable energy, such as wind, solar, hydropower, and geothermal
energy. Carbon dioxide should originate from the atmosphere or renewable sources.
The electricity used in the process of electrolyzing water should be derived from
renewable energy and not from fossil sources. Currently, there are two ways to syn-
thesize PtL fuel: Fischer–Tropsch synthesis and methanol synthesis. The PtL pathway
is in its early stages but has signiﬁcant potential in carbon emission reduction. It can
utilize photovoltaics and wind energy to power the electrolysis process and use CO2
captured from other sources (DAC technology), resulting in good emission reduction
beneﬁts. In theory, PtL aviation fuel can achieve almost 100% emissions reduction
throughout its lifecycle, with a conversion rate of approximately 17–18% [44]. SAF
can account for 60% of the total production, and further process improvements can in-
crease this proportion to 70% [44]. Compared to plant-based SAF pathways (biofuels),
PtL has a lower greenhouse gas footprint (based on lifecycle analysis), reduced water
demand, and higher yields. Moreover, PtL does not increase the demand for arable
land, avoiding the food versus fuel conﬂict. From a technological perspective, PtL
could potentially produce fuel suitable for purifying fossil fuels (non-blended fuels).
Nevertheless, the production cost and capacity of the PtL pathway are signiﬁcantly
inﬂuenced by the availability of green electricity, the cost of hydrogen production,
and the maturity of CCUS technology. It will take a considerable period for the pro-
duction conditions and technological maturity of PtL to reach commercial application.
Meanwhile, as of 2020, the price of hydrogen was USD 7.3 per kilogram, which is
relatively expensive compared to fossil fuels, posing a challenge for competing with
fossil aviation fuels. This calls for policy incentives, regulatory actions, and further
technological improvements [45].
3.
The HEFA pathway mainly involves processing and reﬁning raw materials such as
animal and vegetable oils, waste cooking oil (gutter oil), and algae using hydrogena-
tion to produce SAF. The HEFA pathway is already mature. It is adopted by most
existing SAF projects worldwide. Compared to fossil aviation fuels, HEFA has a GHG
emission reduction potential of 73–84% [44]. There is additional emission reduction
potential when sustainably produced “green” hydrogen is used in production. The
conversion rate of the HEFA pathway is approximately 90%, and SAF can account
for 46% of the total production. This proportion can be increased to 70% through
process optimization [44]. From a global perspective, the reduction in production
costs and the scale expansion of the HEFA pathway are considerably inﬂuenced by
raw material availability.
4.
The G + FT pathway involves the decomposition and recombination of carbon-
containing materials such as energy crops, agricultural and forestry waste, and munic-
ipal solid waste in the form of syngas. This approach is currently in the experimental
stage and can reduce carbon dioxide emissions by 85–94% (World Economic Forum,


Energies 2023, 16, 7597
9 of 20
2020). The conversion rate is 20%, and SAF can account for 60% of the total production.
Through technological improvements, the overall yield of SAF can be increased to
70% [44]. However, there are challenges regarding the collection difﬁculties and high
costs associated with urban solid waste, agricultural and forestry waste, and other
raw materials. Nevertheless, energy crops can adapt to marginal land, minimizing the
need to convert food crops to biofuel production. They can also reduce sediment loss,
water quality degradation, and other negative externalities, avoiding the displacement
of productive farmland and meeting sustainable land use requirements. Therefore,
the production technology that utilizes the G + FT process and energy crops as raw
materials can meet the needs of civil aviation in terms of production volume and
achieve negative carbon emissions through the carbon sink generated during the
cultivation process. Thus, carbon emissions can be reduced in light of local conditions.
A comparison of the relevant descriptions of the four SAF production technology
routes is shown in Table 4 [44].

3.2. Method Description
The TOPSIS method is adopted in this article to assess the techno-economic applicabil-
ity of the four technology routes, HEFA, AtJ, G + FT, and PtL, at future time points. The
following is a description of the comprehensive analysis process using the TOPSIS method.
Since we need to assess techno-economic applicability of the four technology pathways at
different time periods, separate TOPSIS evaluations should be conducted for each year.
(1)
Step 1. Select evaluation criteria for the four technology pathways. Detailed criteria
are listed in Section 3.3.
(2)
Step 2. Normalize and standardize the raw value of the evaluation criteria for the four
SAF routes. Data normalization is outlined in formula (10), where Zij represents the

3.3. Indicator Selection
The research focuses on four SAF technology pathways (HEFA, AtJ, G + FT, PtL), and
the goal is to assess their applicability at different stages of development in China, in order
to help aviation sector to reach carbon peak and carbon neutrality goals. Therefore, this
study uses ‘greenhouse gas emission reductions’, ‘conversion rate’, ‘technological maturity’,
‘SAF overall yield’, ‘availability of raw materials’, ‘SAF production cost’, ‘feedstock costs’,
‘operating costs’, and ‘capital expenditure’ as the primary assessment indicator. The speciﬁc
descriptions of the assessment indicators are as follows:
(1)
Greenhouse gas emission reductions. This indicator considers the GHG emissions
generated at all stages of SAF production and is deﬁned as the proportion of GHG
emissions reduction compared to total emissions over the lifecycle [44].
(2)
Conversion rate. The conversion rate represents the proportion of total yield to raw
material input. The HEFA pathway has the highest conversion rate, reaching 90%.
(3)
Technological maturity is currently classiﬁed into nine levels [46]. The fuel readiness
level (FRL) serves as an assessment of the technical and commercial maturity of alter-


Energies 2023, 16, 7597
11 of 20
native fuel production pathways proposed by the Commercial Aviation Alternative
Fuels Initiative (CAAFI) [47]. FRL is categorized into levels ranging from 1 to 9, with
levels 1–5 signifying the research and development (R&D) stage, levels 6–7 indicating
the certiﬁcation stage, and levels 8–9 representing the commercialization stage.
Furthermore, the Technology Readiness Level (TRL) spans from 1, denoting “basic
technology research,” to 9, signifying “very mature technology,” enabling the evaluation
of technology maturity across different processes [48]. Table 5 provides a summary of the
TRL and FRL levels for various technologies utilized in the production of bioaviation coal.

SAF overall yield. This indicator represents the proportion of SAF yield to total output.
This study makes assumptions regarding the SAF overall yield for each pathway.
The known data are the SAF overall yield in 2020, and it is assumed that all four
pathways will reach their maximum SAF overall yield by 2050 through technological
improvements and other measures. The annual growth rate for 2020–2050 is assumed
to be 3.3% for all four pathways [44].
(5)
Availability of raw materials. For the HEFA pathway, the required raw materials are
mostly waste oils. These raw materials are difﬁcult to collect because of their decen-
tralized distribution. In China, 3.4 million tons of these raw materials are available
yearly [50]. The G + FT pathway beneﬁts from abundant sources of raw materials such
as agricultural and forestry waste, municipal solid waste, and energy crops. Each year,
425.5 million tons of raw materials are available for this pathway. The AtJ technology
route mainly involves the fermentation of corn, sugarcane, lignocellulose and exhaust
gas to produce fuel ethanol, which is then converted into SAF. The production of fuel
ethanol in China is 2.5726 million tons [51]. Theoretically, the raw materials for the
PtL pathway (carbon dioxide, hydrogen, and renewable electricity) have unlimited
sources. Thus, this study does not speciﬁcally evaluate the availability of raw mate-
rials for this pathway. To unify the indicator of raw material availability, this study
deﬁnes it as the ratio of raw material yield to raw material demand based on the
predicted SAF demand in Section 2. If this ratio is greater than 100%, the availability
of raw materials is considered 100%, indicating that the raw material yield can meet
the demand. According to the aforementioned assumptions, the raw material yield
can support the raw material demand for the PtL pathway.
Using the SAF demand data calculated in Section 2, along with conversion rate data
and SAF overall yield data obtained from [44], and the feedstock availability data provided
earlier, we have computed the feedstock obtainability for the four technology routes. The
speciﬁc calculation process can be found in formulas (17) and (18).
Di,j = Si,j ÷ Oi,j ÷ Ci,j
(17)
Ri,j = Di,j ÷ fi,j
(18)
where Di,j represents “demand for raw material” for the j-th technology pathway in the

Oi,j represents “SAF overall yield” for the j-th technology pathway in the i-th year; Ci,j
represents “conversion rate” for the j-th technology pathway in the i-th year; Ri,j represents
“raw material availability” for the j-th technology pathway in the i-th year; fi,j represents
“the feedstock availability” for the j-th technology pathway in the i-th year; i represents

SAF production cost. In the HEFA pathway, the SAF production cost includes raw
material cost, hydrogen production cost, operational and execution cost, and capital
expenditures. Raw material cost accounts for a signiﬁcant portion of the total cost. For
the G + FT pathway, the SAF production cost includes raw material costs, operational
and execution costs, and capital expenditures, with capital expenditures playing a
major role. In the AtJ pathway, the SAF production cost comprises raw material
costs, operational and execution costs, and capital expenditures. Operational and
execution cost is relatively high due to the high cost of reﬁning ethanol into aviation
fuel. In the PtL pathway, the SAF production cost includes raw material costs, capital
expenditures for hydrogen production, operational and execution cost, and capital
expenditures for FT + RWGS (Fischer–Tropsch and Reverse Water–Gas Shift) processes.
Among these, hydrogen production costs contribute the most. With other measures
such as technological improvements, the production costs of SAF using the HEFA
technology will progressively decrease. For the other three production technology
routes, which are not yet commercially available, cost reductions are not anticipated
until 2030 [44].
(7)
Feedstock costs. Feedstock costs vary depending on the type of feedstock used for
each technology route. The cost data for feedstock are from [44].
(8)
Operating costs. Operating costs play a signiﬁcant role in the economics of bioaviation
fuel production. Data on operating costs can be found in [44].
(9)
Capital expenditure. Each of the four technology routes has distinct capital expendi-
tures, which we also consider as an assessment indicator. Speciﬁc data can be found
in [44].
The detailed raw value can be found in Appendix A.

We calculate the composite scores for different time periods based on Equations (10)–(16).

4. Results and Discussion
4.1. HEFA Is the Most Suitable Route for SAF Production in China before 2035
HEFA has the highest composite score from Table 7 to Table 9. These highest scores
show that HEFA pathway is the best choice in China until 2035, ranking the 1st among the
four pathways.


Energies 2023, 16, 7597
14 of 20
The HEFA pathway is already in a mature stage and boasts competitive advantages
in terms of potential lifecycle emissions reduction, overall SAF yield, and producing cost.
The primary raw material required for HEFA pathway is waste oils. Table 6 show that
the availability of waste oil resources can meet the raw material demand for the HEFA
pathway from 2024 to 2035, further conﬁrming its strong suitability during this period.
Most of China’s SAF producers currently employ this technology pathway. By 2035, HEFA
will continue to be the most efﬁcient and cost-competitive pathway due to its relatively low
capital investment requirement for a proven technology.
4.2. The G + FT Technology Route Experiences Rapid Growth and Takes the Lead in SAF
Production from 2035 to 2050
Tables 10 and 11 highlight the growing suitability of the G + FT pathway in China,
and Table 6 conﬁrms that agricultural waste, forestry waste, and energy crops within China
can meet the raw material demand G + FT pathway from 2035 to 2050. This solidiﬁes the
G + FT pathway’s dominance in China during that period, reinforcing its suitability.
The increasing maturity of G + FT technology, especially when based on energy crops,
alongside continuous cost reductions in SAF production and the availability of various raw
material options (agricultural and forestry waste, municipal solid waste, industrial waste,
and energy crops grown on marginal land), will make G + FT pathway highly favorable.
China has already validated the FT and hydroprocessing quality-upgrading processes
through coal-to-oil projects. The only remaining steps involve pilot tests for pyrolysis and
gas modulation processes, alongside intensiﬁed research and development on the separa-
tion of raw material components, efﬁcient conversion of hemicellulose-derived furfural
and lignin, and bio-jet fuel production technology integration. Once these milestones are
achieved, large-scale commercialization becomes possible.
HEFA pathway faces challenges related to raw material collection, and its performance
weakens after 2035. The market share of G + FT is expected to keep growing from 2035
to 2050, potentially making it the most competitive SAF production pathway in China.
Utilizing energy crops grown on marginal land is regard as the best raw material option for
developing the SAF industry in China. China’s current maximum production capacity is
75 million tons per year, aligning with civil aviation demand projections. Moreover, the
cultivation of energy crops generates a carbon sink, achieving negative carbon emissions
and delivering substantial environmental beneﬁts.
4.3. The PtL Technology Route Becomes the Most Suitable for SAF Production in China after 2050
As shown in Table 12, the overall score index for the PtL production pathway has
signiﬁcantly improved, surpassing the G + FT pathway and taking the top position. Table 6
further corroborates the viability of the PtL pathway, emphasizing its nearly unrestricted
access to raw materials.
As the dominant long-term technology pathway, PtL eliminates concerns about the
availability of raw materials for SAF production, reinforcing its leading position in China
after 2050. Although PtL is yet to achieve full commercialization, it offers a substantial
emission reduction potential of up to 99% compared to conventional aviation fuel [44].
Furthermore, it can capture carbon dioxide and green electricity directly from the air as
raw materials, ensuring a high level of availability.
In the PtL pathway, operating and input costs make up 80–90% of the current produc-
tion costs, depending on the speciﬁc production process [44]. These costs are inﬂuenced
by hydrogen production or cooperative electrolysis. With the advancement of technol-
ogy, the production costs of PtL are expected to decrease signiﬁcantly, making it the most
competitive technology pathway beyond 2050.
4.4. The AtJ Technology Route Is Less Suitable for SAF Production in China Compared to the Other
Three Technology Routes
The TOPSIS analysis consistently ranks the AtJ production pathway relatively low
in China from 2020 to 2050 due to the limited availability of raw materials for SAF pro-


Energies 2023, 16, 7597
15 of 20
duction. The AtJ technology route primarily utilizes feedstocks such as corn, sugarcane,
lignocellulose, and waste gas to produce SAF. However, the yields of fuel ethanol obtained
from these feedstocks are relatively low, and this is compounded by the need to adhere
to the principles of “not competing with food resources” and “not competing with land
resources.” These constraints, along with technological limitations, result in a restricted
supply of raw materials. Consequently, large-scale SAF production for civil aviation in
China faces signiﬁcant challenges when adopting the AtJ pathway.
5. Conclusions
In this paper, we forecast SAF demand in China for the next few decades and utilize the
TOPSIS method to conduct a comprehensive assessment of the suitability of SAF production
pathways in China at different stages. This article yields the following conclusions.
5.1. The Potential for SAF Emissions Reduction and Its Future Demand in China Is Substantial
China, as the second-largest aviation market, is responsible for approximately 1% of
the country’s total carbon emissions, which equates to approximately 100 million tons [52].
With the post-pandemic recovery of air travel, carbon emissions from China’s aviation
sector are expected to continue rising. It is imperative to implement comprehensive and
effective measures aimed at reducing carbon emissions in the civil aviation industry in
China, thereby contributing to the country’s carbon peak and carbon neutrality goals.
This study’s ﬁndings suggest that cumulative SAF demand in China from 2024 to
2050 is projected to reach 297.17 million tons, resulting in a reduction of 93.04 million tons
of carbon emissions by 2050. Consequently, a well-planned schedule for SAF production
pathways is essential to meet the rapidly increasing demand.
5.2. Applicability of the Four Technical Routes
The ﬁndings of this study reveal that HEFA technology exhibits strong suitability for
China’s SAF production before 2035, given the relatively advanced industrial technology in
this domain. This technology provides positive support for future SAF capacity expansion
in the country. Among the four technical pathways, G + FT also demonstrates clear
advantages. As China strengthens its technical capabilities and research and development
efforts in the G + FT pathway, it is likely to be the most applicable technology pathway
for China’s national conditions from 2035 to 2050, effectively meeting the demands of
civil aviation.
PtL technology ranks ﬁrst in the overall assessment, suggesting that with a decrease
in green power costs, advancements in CCUS and SAF synthesis technologies, and clear
policy support, PtL holds great potential to become the most promising technology route
for SAF production in China after 2050, in the long term.
Conversely, the AtJ pathway has the lowest rating among the four technical routes,
indicating that its applicability in China is limited. This limitation primarily stems from
the strict principles of “not competing for food resources” and “not competing for land
resources.” Large-scale SAF production from crops like corn and sugarcane in China faces
signiﬁcant challenges.
In summary, considering China’s national conditions and realities, HEFA technology
is mature, making it the most suitable SAF production method before 2035. G + FT becomes
the dominant production route from 2035 to 2050, and PtL technology is the most suitable
option for SAF production in China after 2050.
6. Recommendations
From the analysis presented earlier in this article, it is evident that while SAF offers
signiﬁcant potential for emission reduction in China, a thorough understanding of the
current state of SAF development in the country reveals a range of issues. These challenges
include the absence of mature technology in the development of SAF production routes,
high fuel costs, increased demand for raw materials, an imperfect SAF management system,

and a lack of comprehensive policy guidance. To expedite the mass production and large-
scale commercial application of SAF in China, we put forward several recommendations
aimed at reducing cost barriers and enhancing the environmental and economic viability
of SAF.
6.1. Enhance Technical Research on Both the G + FT and PtL Technology Routes
In China, the G + FT process is still in the commercial pilot stage and has limited
widespread applications. The PtL process is in the early stages of development. Both of
these pathways, which hold long-term potential, are not yet fully mature. When it comes to
the G + FT pathway using energy plants, a signiﬁcant focus is placed on advancing G + FT
process techniques to improve the economic feasibility of SAF. Research and development
projects should encompass the puriﬁcation of pyrolysis gas, its conversion to synthesis
gas, Fischer–Tropsch-directed conversion, as well as the technology and application of
fractionating raw material components, utilizing cellulose derived from furfural, and
efﬁciently converting lignin into bio aviation oil. For the PtL pathway, it is advisable to
conduct advanced research in building a highly efﬁcient composite catalytic system (such
as photocatalytic, photoelectric catalytic, or photothermal synergistic catalytic) to convert
carbon dioxide into methane and other carbon-based fuels.
6.2. Continuously Exploring New Raw Materials Is Essential to Progressively Achieve Fuel
Expansion and Cost Reduction
In terms of raw materials, considering the G + FT pathway based on energy plants is the
most feasible technology route for China between 2035 and 2050, it is suggested to develop
energy plants and microalgae resources suitable for cultivation in saline-alkali lands. China
possesses abundant saline-alkali land resources in regions such as the Northwest, Northeast,
and North China, as well as extensive coastal areas. Therefore, we suggest vigorous
development of salt-tolerant plants in the Northwest, Northeast, and North China regions
and the cultivation of microalgae resources in coastal areas. This strategy helps gradually
expand cultivation scale, increase the supply of raw materials, boost farmers’ income,
reduce heavy dependence on foreign energy sources, and strengthen energy security.
6.3. Improve Economic Policies and Establish a Market-Oriented Mechanism for SAF
Policy guidance is a crucial measure for enhancing the economic feasibility, production
capacity, and demand for SAF. Firstly, we suggest to establish a comprehensive tax policy
system to support the entire supply chain of SAF, including raw material supply and
research and development, by providing tax incentives. This will better leverage the tax
policies to promote the large-scale use of SAF and further reduce the price gap between
SAF and traditional aviation fossil fuels. Secondly, to overcome the economic barriers
in the aviation industry’s adoption of SAF, it is recommended to actively promote green
ﬁnancial tools, such as green loans, green funds, carbon ﬁnancial products to support
the development of SAF. At the same time, it is proposed to motivate private capital to
establish SAF industrial investment funds in a market-oriented manner. Furthermore, close
cooperation between airlines and fuel producers, is also suggested to promote the research
and development of SAF and expand its production scale.

Supporting the pathway to net zero carbon emissions in the aviation industry, sustainable aviation fuels (SAF) 
will contribute to a large extent to reduce net CO2 emissions in the next decades to deliver on climate targets. For 
this reason, the large-scale uptake of SAFs in aviation is on top of the agenda of regulatory policy. However, 
challenges remain for building the respective infrastructure and supply chains at the appropriate scale to produce 
and distribute SAF at a reasonable cost. Currently, only one percent of fuels consumed by airlines in Europe are 
blended with sustainable aviation fuels. The paper examines current SAF production pathways, environmental 
benefits, and estimated fuel prices from the state-of-the art literature. Further, regulatory policies established by 
governments, regulatory agencies and industry associations are examined, regarding blending mandates in 
different regional markets. The authors conclude with the statistical analysis of minimum selling prices for 
different types of SAF, and discuss their respective availability.   
1. Introduction 
The transition of air transport toward net zero carbon dioxide (CO2) 
emissions by 2050 is a primary goal of the aviation industry, govern­
ments, and regulatory agencies. Respective strategies, scenarios, and 
roadmaps have been suggested at the highest level, for example, the 
European Green Deal including the Fit-for-55 package, IATA’s “Fly Net 
Zero” strategy, or EUROCONTROL’s aviation outlook for 2050 (EURO­
CONTROL, 2022; European Council, 2022; IATA, 2021). In addition, 
many global aviation industry forecasts refer to net zero CO2 targets by 
2050. 
The majority of studies, reports, and proposals conclude that the net 
zero target can only be achieved by combining different options for CO2 
emissions reduction, such as improving current aircraft technology, 
improving airport and air traffic management operations, introducing 
revolutionary aircraft powered by fuel cells or hydrogen (Grimme and 
Braun, 2022), by using sustainable aviation fuels, or by introducing 
effective market-based measures, e.g., the European Emissions Trading 
Scheme (EU ETS). Among these options, which differ depending on 
future potential, effectiveness, scalability, time of rollout, and costs, 
sustainable aviation fuels (SAF) are one of the largest contributors in all 
net zero strategies. The latest scenario forecast of EUROCONTROL, see 
Fig. 1., estimates that SAF. 
will be the largest contributor in two of three outlined European net 
zero scenarios with 41% and 56% respectively, and the second largest 
contributor in a third scenario with 34%. Market-based measures and 
carbon capture will also be a large contributor with 32% as shown in 
Fig. 1 labelled as “Other”. 
The reason for this high share is that sustainable aviation fuels can be 
used as “drop-in” fuels with existing aircraft technology without any 
modification, and are therefore fully compliant with current aircraft and 
airport infrastructure. Similar results are found in the Waypoint 2050 
study (ATAG, 2021), where SAF would contribute up to 71% to emis­
sions reductions in 2050. It is also well understood how SAF can be 
produced and blended with conventional fossil fuel kerosene. A range of 
flight tests have been conducted by major aircraft manufacturers and 
airlines (The Emirates Group, 2023). Certification is partially completed 
for blending ratios up to 50%, depending on the SAF type. In addition, 
sustainable aviation fuels are already commercially available on the 
market in limited quantities. However, the use of SAF in day-to-day 
flight operations is still in its infancy, with less than 1% of all Euro­
pean flights being operated with SAF today (EASA, 2022). Reasons for 
the low utilization rate are related to availability and cost. Production 
costs and market prices for SAF are substantially higher than for fossil 
kerosene jet fuel, and the infrastructure and supply chains for efficient 
large-scale production of SAF are still in their infancy.

However, to leverage the potential of SAF, it is worth reviewing the 
different types of SAF, their respective production pathways, and feed­
stocks that are discussed today. SAF can be produced in a variety of 
different ways and with different feedstocks that serve as raw material 
inputs to the production process. Examples include biofuels from the 
hydroprocessed esters and fatty acids (HEFA) conversion pathway, 
advanced biomass to liquid fuels (ABtL), and power-to-liquid fuels (PtL) 
from renewable hydrogen and CO2 as shown in Table 1. 
In a competitive market environment, including the availability of 
fossil jet fuels, SAF competes with other CO2 mitigation options such as 
market-based measures and carbon capture but also with various types 
of sustainable aviation fuels based on different feedstocks and produc­
tion methods and their respective supply chains. For example, an airline 
may choose to purchase large stocks of CO2 allowances to meet CO2 
targets rather than using SAF beyond fuel mandates to gain a competi­
tive advantage. Given a pre-COVID-19 jet fuel price of 690 USD per ton, 
IEA (2022) estimates the CO2 price of around 160 USD per ton in 2050, 
whereas 1 ton of kerosene is equivalent to 3.16 tons of CO2. Currently, 
one CO2 allowance within the EU-ETS is about 85 USD per ton (PwC, 
2022). 
This paper reviews recent (mainly over the last five years) scientific 
and economic studies on the production and pricing of SAFs. The aim is 
to provide up-to-date reference values for SAF pricing that can be used 
for future economic analysis. The focus of the evaluation is on peer- 
reviewed articles that considered SAF production pathways and costs 
from a techno-economic perspective. The analysis only covers the US 
and European markets, leaving other markets such as those in devel­
oping countries or regions in the Far East of Asia, for future research. To 
the authors’ knowledge, no such state-of-the-art review has been un­
dertaken. Based on the data found in the reviewed publications, price 
ranges are derived from an aggregation and statistical analysis of min­
imum selling prices (MSP) for sustainable aviation fuels found in 55 
peer-reviewed articles. They were selected manually on the basis of a 
thorough literature review. These derived reference values for SAF 
pricing can also be used for future market research, scenario planning, 
and policy option development. In addition, the availability of different 
SAF types are discussed in more detail, and respective benefits and 
challenges are revealed. The environmental impacts and non-CO2 ef­
fects of air transport emissions regarding SAF utilization are also 
reviewed. Non-CO2 effects refer to the climate impact of gases and 
particles other than CO2 emitted by aircraft, as well as the formation of 
contrails and cirrus clouds. 
The paper is structured as follows: Section 2 reviews different types 
of SAF, production pathways, and environmental benefits and blending 
mandates, focusing on the United States and Europe. Section 3 (meth­
odology and results) evaluates SAF prices based on the data found in the 
reviewed articles and studies. Section 4 specifically discusses SAF 
availability. Section 5 concludes with a discussion of results. 
2. Types, environmental benefits, and regulation of sustainable 
aviation fuels (SAF) 
This section reviews different types of SAF discussed in the literature, 
and their respective production pathways and feedstocks. The environ­
mental benefits of sustainable aviation fuels in terms of net greenhouse 
gas emission (GHG) reductions and non-CO2 effects are examined. In 
addition, SAF blending limits with fossil jet fuels (kerosene) and regu­
lations regarding mandates for using SAF are reviewed. 
Sustainable aviation fuels have been intensively discussed in recent 
years. For example, Kousoulidou and Lonza (2016), analyze the 
deployment of biofuels in aviation and outline demand and supply po­
tentials for the European market. Zhang et al. (2020) provide an

overview of challenges and trends, including certification and avail­
ability of SAF regarding the United States (U.S.) domestic market. They 
state that the U.S. jet fuel market represents approximately 20 billion 
gallons per year, while global consumption is about four times that 
amount. Further, Brandt et al. (2022) study impacts of federal policy on 
minimum selling prices of SAFs, also focusing on the U.S. market. They 
report that HEFA biofuels could achieve a SAF price that would be 
competitive to conventional fuels when using a specific feedstock. 
However, availability of this feedstock is limited and unlikely to support 
the production of large quantities of SAF. As a result, different SAFs 
compete not only in terms of market prices but also in terms of their 
availability including required feedstocks and supply chains. 
2.1. Production pathways and feedstocks 
The combustion of sustainable aviation fuels in aircraft engines 
causes nearly the same amount of CO2 emissions as conventional 
kerosene-based jet fuel. The CO2 savings potential is determined by a life 
cycle analysis of the feedstocks used as raw materials and the required 
production and conversion processes. For example, biological feedstocks 
remove CO2 from the atmosphere during their growth. To produce e- 
fuels such as Power-to-Liquid fuels, CO2 previously emitted from other 
sources is captured from the atmosphere or concentrated sources and 
then fed into the SAF production process (EASA, 2022; García-Contreras 
et al., 2022). 
Overall, there are several production and conversion pathways to 
produce SAF and a wide variety of possible feedstocks for biofuels 
(Karim et al., 2022; Pasa et al., 2022; Vela-García et al., 2022; Zhang 
et al., 2020). To date, the American Society for Testing Materials (ASTM) 
has certified seven conversion pathways (García-Contreras et al., 2022; 
IATA, 2022). The Fischer-Tropsch synthesis (FT or FT-SPK)1 and the 
hydroprocessed esters and fatty acids (HEFA) pathway are among the 
most mature production processes for sustainable aviation fuels, being 
the first conversion technologies to be approved in 2009 and 2011, 
respectively. Other pathways include the following processes: 
Fischer-Tropsch containing aromatics (FT- SPK/A), hydroprocessed 
fermented sugars to synthetic isoparaffins (HFS–SIP/DSHC), isobutanol 
and ethanol Alcohol-to-Jet (ATJ), catalytic hydrothermolysis jet fuel 
(CHJ) and hydroprocessed hydrocarbons (HH-SPK or HC-HEFA) (IATA, 
2022). Pathways for drop-in SAF need to be approved by the ASTM to 
ensure that SAFs are interchangeable with existing infrastructure and jet 
engines and that they can be blended with conventional fossil kerosene 
(EASA, 2022; IATA, 2022). Due to their properties, certified SAFs are 
used as “drop-in” fuels, i.e., they are blended with kerosene and can be 
used with kerosene-powered aircraft. They can therefore be used in all 
current and future aircraft designed for kerosene jet fuel. The inter­
changeability of SAF and fossil-based jet fuel makes SAF a cost-effective 
solution for reducing CO2 emissions while scaling up SAF production to 
gradually replace fossil-based jet fuels. However, the production of SAF 
is still more expensive than fossil-based jet fuel, and SAF production 
capacity and quantity is limited. The price of fossil-based jet fuel cor­
relates with the crude oil price. 
As outlined by Royal NLR (2022), SAF can be produced from bio- or 
waste-based feedstocks but also in synthetic form also known as e-fuels 
or power-to-liquid fuels (see Table 2). For synthetic fuels, hydrogen 
serves as feedstock and is processed with CO2 to produce synthetic 
kerosene. However, direct air capture of CO2 is at early stage of devel­
opment and therefore expensive. 
Table 2 provides a brief classification of the different types of SAF 
including potential conversion pathways and costs. Costs refer only to 
feedstocks supplied from the European Union (EU) or the United 
Kingdom (UK). According to Royal NLR (2022), the cost of bio- or waste 
based SAF based on the Fischer-Tropsch (FT) pathway is much lower 
than the cost of hydrogen in 2020, which is around 8300 EUR/ton of 
hydrogen. Due to the uncertainty of cost estimations, Section 3 derives 
estimated SAF cost ranges from a sample of techno-economic studies and 
papers that have been published in recent years. 
2.2. Environmental benefits 
Sustainable aviation fuels must meet certain sustainability criteria, 
such as greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions savings, consideration of land 
use change and avoidance of competition of raw materials with nutri­
ents, in order to comply with European environmental policies. Ac­
cording to the EU’s Renewable Energy Directive (RED III), the life-cycle 
GHG emissions of biofuels must be 50–70% lower compared to con­
ventional kerosene, and the cultivation of the feedstock must not lead to 
environmentally or socioeconomically negative changes in land use 
(European Parliament and Council of the European Union, 2023a). 
Therefore, emissions from carbon stocks due to land use changes are also 
considered when calculating life cycle emissions of SAFs. 
Feedstocks for biofuels that meet the EU sustainability criteria are 
defined in Annex IX of RED III. Biofuels produced through the HEFA 
pathway are limited to sources such as used cooking oil and certain 
classified animal fats. In contrast to conventional biofuels, the European 
Union (EU) is focusing on promoting the use of "advanced" biofuels. 
These advanced biofuels are derived from a specified list of feedstocks, 
and there are restrictions on biofuels that are considered to pose a high 
risk of direct and indirect land use change or competition with nutrients. 
The EU approach aims to ensure the sustainability and environmental 
benefits of biofuel production. Feedstocks for advanced biofuels can 
include algae, mixed municipal waste, straw, and others listed by the 
European Commission. SAFs that can be used under the European 
Emissions Trading Scheme (EU ETS) and the ReFuel Aviation Regulation 
must meet the criteria of RED III. 
ICAO also defines sustainability criteria for SAF to be eligible for the 
Carbon Offsetting and Reduction Scheme for International Aviation 
(CORSIA) (Efthymiou and Ryley, 2022; ICAO, 2022a, 2022b). The po­
tential to reduce GHG emissions on a life-cycle basis (and including 
direct and indirect land-use changes) must be at least 10%, and criteria 
similar to those in the EU Energy Directive apply in relation to

biodiversity and carbon stock changes (ICAO, 2022b). ICAO provides a 
summary of production pathways and raw materials with GHG emis­
sions reported in grams of CO2 equivalents during each life cycle. In 
addition to CO2, the greenhouse gases nitrous oxide (N2O) and methane 
(CH4) are also included in the assessment. The life cycle assessment of 
GHG emissions is based on "Well to Wake" (WTW), starting with land use 
and cultivation of the feedstock, transportation of the feedstock, and 
ending with combustion as jet fuel. To calculate the GHG emission 
savings potential of biofuels, their life cycle emission factor is subtracted 
from a reference value of 89 gCO2 equivalents per megajoule (MJ) of jet 
fuel (EASA, 2022; ICAO, 2022a; Prussi et al., 2021; Voigt et al., 2021). 
Figs. 2 and 3 show the GHG emissions saving potentials by produc­
tion pathway and by feedstock on a life cycle basis. As mentioned above, 
the life cycle emissions factor (LSf) includes direct and indirect land use 
change. While some production processes may result in higher emissions 
than the fossil baseline, e.g., when life cycle emissions and land use 
changes are included, a wide range of biomass feedstocks and conver­
sion processes can reduce carbon dioxide equivalents. 
Among advanced biofuels, SAF globally produced using the Fischer- 
Tropsch process from miscanthus - also known as silver grass - forestry 
and agricultural residues, and municipal solid waste, offers the highest 
potential to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by more than 90%–100%, 
based on lifecycle emissions. In some regions, emissions savings could be 
as high as 125%. The median reduction potentials of alcohol-to-jet 
conversion pathways are about 60%, while those of HEFA are almost 
below 60%. In terms of feedstocks used to produce biofuels, e.g., mis­
canthus, jatropha oil, and municipal solid waste generally offer the 
highest GHG reduction potential. Palm oil and corn kernels show almost 
no potential, with an average savings potential of around zero, and even 
net negative emissions are possible. 
Palm oil and corn grains in this case can have a negative impact on 
emissions due to land use change. GHG emissions savings potentials of 
less than 50% would not be eligible for the EU sustainability criteria for 
biofuel plants starting operations before October 2015, nor would they 
be eligible for financial support from public authorities. The GHG sav­
ings threshold increases to 65% for biofuel plants starting operations 
after January 2021. 
In contrast, synthetic fuels have the potential to reduce direct 
emissions by up to 100% and achieve carbon neutrality if electricity is 
generated from renewable resources and the required CO2 is extracted 
from the air by direct capture. However, due to GHG emissions from 
transport supply chains, full carbon neutrality will not be achieved 
based on a life cycle analysis. EASA (2022) defines synthetic fuels as 
renewable liquid transportation fuels of non-biological origin; other 
terms include electro-fuels, e-fuels, and power-to-liquid (PtL) fuels. The 
production pathway is based on the Fischer-Tropsch technology, and 
there are several ways to obtain the CO2 needed for the PtL process. 
Technically, the CO2 could be extracted from industrial waste gases, 
biomass or directly from the atmosphere (EASA, 2022), but the EU re­
stricts the origin of the CO2 to non-biological sources (European 
Parliament and Council of the European Union, 2023a) 
In addition to reducing life-cycle GHG emissions, the use of SAF can 
also reduce other direct climate impacts of aviation (García-Contreras 
et al., 2022). In addition to carbon dioxide (CO2), planes emit water 
vapor (H2O) and aerosol particles (particulate matter) like soot. Under 
certain atmospheric conditions, the water vapor emissions from an 
aircraft engine become visible as contrails and cirrus clouds. In addition, 
the soot particles alter the cloud formation. However, this effect is 
concentrated on a small percentage of flights that are particularly 
responsible for the formation of the warming contrails (Teoh et al., 
2022). The climate effect is measured using the concept of radiative 
forcing. A positive radiative forcing means that less solar radiation is 
reflected back into space from the Earth’s atmosphere, resulting in a 
warming of the Earth (Lee et al., 2021). Although research in this area is 
ongoing, recent studies have found that SAF reduce contrail lifetime and 
its radiative forcing because sustainable aviation fuels are typically low 
in aromatics and sulfur, and thus will emit less particulate matter 
(Beyersdorf et al., 2014; Durdina et al., 2021; EASA, 2020; Lobo et al., 
2012; Moore et al., 2017; Teoh et al., 2022; Voigt et al., 2021). Since the 
formation of contrail clouds is highly dependent on the particular flight 
route and weather conditions, climate researchers suggest using SAF 
primarily for flights that form highly warming contrails in order to more 
effectively reduce the climate impact of air traffic (Teoh et al., 2022). 
To comply with regulatory sustainability criteria, the GHG savings 
potential is particularly important also regarding future investments and 
public financial support. Regulations are covered in the next section. 
Minimum selling prices for SAFs are evaluated in Section 3.

2.3. Regulation and blending limits 
Due to the significance of SAF for the overall strategy towards net 
zero 2050, governments are promoting the adoption of SAF by airlines 
and air transport operators. The certification of SAFs also defines the 
maximum blending limits with kerosene. The maximum blending limit 
is currently up to 50% by volume for the Fischer-Tropsch, HEFA, AtJ and 
CHJ pathways, and 10% for the other certified pathways.2 In addition to 
SAF blending limits, which may increase in the future with ongoing SAF 
certification, several directives in the EU and in other regions have been 
released to encourage investments in sustainable aviation fuels (Efthy­
miou and Ryley, 2022). These include, for example, mandates for fuel 
suppliers to deliver SAF blended fuels to all European airports with more 
than 800,000 passengers or 100,000 tons of cargo per year, ensuring 
that airlines operate a certain number of their flights with sustainable 
aviation fuels (European Parliament and Council of the European Union, 
2023b). 
The ReFuelEU Aviation Regulation (European Parliament and 
Council of the European Union, 2023b) (Quelle) requires SAF mandates 
(shares) of between 2 and 70% for jet fuel starting in 2025, whereas the 
share is gradually increasing in 5-year increments (European Parliament 
and Council of the European Union, 2018; Seo Amsterdam Economics, 
NLR, 2022). The regulation also requires jet fuels to meet specific quotas 
for synthetic (power-to-liquid) fuels as shown in Fig. 4. 
Similarly, the IEA Net Zero proposal (IEA, 2021a) suggests SAF 
mandates of 2–75% from 2025. These quotas are higher than those in 
the ReFuelEU directive, and are therefore more likely to support the 
1.5-degree climate target. In addition, the European Energy Tax Direc­
tive (ETD) has been revised, including the removal of an exemption for a 
European kerosene tax (European Parliament and Council of the Euro­
pean Union, 2021). 
In contrast to the EU ETS and the ETD, the SAF mandate of the 
ReFuelEU Aviation directive will apply to all flights departing from 
European airports including those arriving at non-EU airports (European 
Parliament and Council of the European Union, 2018). 
In the U.S., the Biden administration announced the goal of replacing 
all fossil jet fuel with SAF by the year 2050, including the plan to in­
crease SAF production to 3 billion gallons annually by 2030 in coordi­
nation with Airlines for America. This goal is supported by the 
Sustainable Skies Act, which was passed in the US Congress in May 2021 
(U.S. Congress, 2021). The act introduces a dedicated blender’s tax 
credit of 1.50–2.00 USD per gallon to accelerate commercial-scale pro­
duction of SAF. California’s Low Carbon Fuel Standard (CA-LCFS) is 
restricted to the U.S. regional state but also gives credits for reducing the 
GHG intensity of California’s transportation fuels by 20% by 2030 (U.S. 
State of California, 2009). 
In Australia, the Sustainable Aviation Fuels Alliance (SAFAANZ) of 
Australia and New Zealand published a proposal in 2022 with the goal of 
2.5% emissions reduction from jet fuel by 2025, 3% by 2030, and 10% in 
2050 (Bioenergy Australia, 2022). These quotas are much weaker than 
the European directives. 
ICAO has conducted feasibility studies for the introduction of SAF in 
smaller, less economically developed countries as part of its capacity- 
building and assistance to member states. Four studies have been con­
ducted for the Dominican Republic (Gomez Jimenez, 2017), Kenya 
(White, 2018), Burkina Faso (Weber, 2018) and Trinidad and Tobago 
(Serafini, 2017). 
Despite these regulatory efforts, the widespread adoption of SAF will 
depend on competitiveness in the marketplace against other CO2 
reduction alternatives such as cap-and-trade systems. Airlines and de­
cision makers are developing their own roadmaps to reduce their air 
transport emissions while meeting customer needs. In the EU, the 
enforcement of the blending quota will be monitored for aviation fuel 
suppliers and aircraft operators: First, in the event of non-compliance, 
the SAF aviation fuel suppliers will be subject to a fine not less than 
twice as high as the amount resulting from the multiplication of the 
difference between the yearly average price of conventional aviation 
fuel and SAF per ton by the quantity of aviation fuels not complying with 
the minimum shares. In addition, the fuel supplier will be obliged to 
deliver the missing SAF amount in subsequent years on top of the 
respective obligations for these years (European Parliament and Council

Airlines will risk penalties at least twice the average annual price of 
kerosene per ton multiplied with the total yearly non-tanked quantity if 
airlines fail to comply to uplift at least 90% of the fuel required for flights 
from each respective EU airport. This provision shall limit tankering to a 
minimum to avoid potentially higher fuel costs at EU airports as a 
consequence of the blending mandate (European Parliament and 
Council of the European Union, 2023b). And to avoid double-counting 
of CO2 emission reductions, airlines may only claim the benefits of 
SAF utilization once - under the EU ETS for intra-EU flights or under 
CORSIA for extra-EU flights. 
For the timeframe 2025 to 2034, fuel suppliers will not be required to 
deliver the minimum amounts of SAF to all airports physically. For 
compliance purposes, they can prove an average share of SAF delivered 
to all EU airports. For these reasons, reliable cost estimates for sus­
tainable aviation fuels including their availability are important for 
decision-making in a competitive market environment. 
3. Market prices for SAF derived from reviewed studies 
In this section, a meta study on SAF prices is presented. In a 
competitive environment, prices will have a relevant impact on future 
air transport and passengers. Stakeholders may fear substantial cost 
increases compared to the current use of fossil jet fuel, which could lead 
to a reduction in demand and, subsequently, profits for many stake­
holders in the air transport value chain. Airlines may also decide to pass 
on to customers the add-on costs for SAF. Therefore, expectations on 
future SAF prices are of interest for the aviation industry and regulators 
alike. Also, for air transport forecasts typically relying on the relation­
ship between fuel prices, airline ticket prices and demand development, 
future prices of sustainable aviation fuels are of considerable interest. 
In recent years, a plethora of techno-economic analyses on SAF 
production have been carried out, describing feedstocks, conversion 
processes and associated costs of production or minimum selling prices, 
respectively. In total, 55 peer-reviewed studies were considered for the 
analysis presented in this paper. The studies have been searched at 
various sources (ScienceDirect, Google Scholar, Springer Link and Wiley 
Online Library) using search terms closely related to the topic, such as 
“techno-economic study”, “sustainable aviation fuel”, “power-to- 
liquid”, “biofuel” or “jet-fuel”. Additionally, the list of references of 
studies found in a first round of search were analyzed for further rele­
vant studies. Fig. 5 shows the distribution by publication year, revealing 
a growing scientific interest in techno-economic analysis. The studies 
describe production processes from a technological and bio-chemical 
point of view, additionally it is the purpose to determine the mini­
mum selling price (MSP) of SAF. This is done by estimating required 
capital expenditure (CAPEX) and operating expenditure costs (OPEX) 
over the life of the plant. For finance costs, assumptions on interest rates 
are made. At the minimum selling price, the net present value of the 
overall project is zero. Hence, the variations in minimum selling prices 
are a result of different conversion pathway efficiencies and different 
assumptions on costs of feedstock, facility construction, energy and in­
terest rates. In economic terms, this corresponds to the long-term 
average cost. 
Several studies analyzed multiple conversion pathways, feedstocks 
or input cost scenarios. Overall, 230 observations on minimum selling 
prices (MSPs) and production costs were included in the analysis. In 
order to improve the comparability, the results of different years and 
different currencies have been normalized to USD2020, using the average 
exchange rate of the base year of each study and OECD’s producers price 
index. For aggregation and to allow a better interpretation of results, 
typical descriptive statistics (mean, median, lower quartile and upper 
quartile) have been calculated on the basis of the normalized mean 
selling price in USD2020. Table 3 lists analysis results grouped by con­
version pathway and respective minimum selling prices based on pro­
duction costs. 
The HEFA conversion pathway is the most intensively studied pro­
duction process with 23 studies and 81 observations on MSP/production 
costs. HEFA results in the lowest price range, when considering the 
lower quartile, but not according to the mean and median indicators. 
The reason for this is that several studies have analyzed this production 
process with algae as feedstock. Oil extraction from algae is considered 
to be more expensive than with vegetable oils, producing several out­
liers with production costs above 2000 USD2020/t SAF, as also shown in 
Fig. 6. The Fischer-Tropsch (FT) conversion pathway with biogenic 
feedstocks, the initially approved production process for SAF, is more 
cost-intensive compared to other pathways, except for the production of 
power-to-liquid (PtL) fuel. This is mainly due to the capital-intensive 
nature and operational complexities associated with the FT production 
pathway. The feed mass and energy balances are lower for the FT

synthesis, and the ratio of jet fuel to feed energy is half that of hydro­
processed esters and fatty acids (HEFA) pathway, for instance (Die­
derichs 
et 
al., 
2016). 
Studies 
focusing 
on 
aqueous 
phase 
processing/reforming (APR) with furfural and/or levulinic acid as in­
termediate products also feature relatively low production cost esti­
mates, and thus, lower minimum selling prices. 
Power-to-liquid (PtL) fuels have the highest production costs, both in 
the mean (3126.3 USD2020/t), median (2821.2 USD2020/t) and lower 
quartile (2023.6 USD2020/t). The variation in production costs can be 
attributed to several factors. For relatively highly advanced conversion 
pathways, technological uncertainty about the efficiency of processes (e. 
g. conversion yields) is low, but assumptions about feedstock prices play 
a major role in SAF price modelling. For instance, Barbera et al. (2020) 
assume a used cooking oil price of only 150 USD/t, resulting in a SAF 
price of 564 USD2020/t. Due to the high demand for used cooking oil as 
feedstock for both SAF and biodiesel, prices increased on the interna­
tional commodities market to more than USD 1200 in the year 2022 
(Matsuura, 2022). For PtL fuels, electricity prices determine the 
minimum selling prices to a large extent. Assumptions on electricity 
prices themselves vary across different studies, therefore also impacting 
the model results in the respective studies. Drünert et al. (2020) use a 
price range between 4.4 and 7.2 euro cents per kWh in 2030 and 3.5 to 
5.5 euro cents per kWh in 2050. Schmidt et al. (2018) assume an elec­
tricity price of 4 euro cents per kWh, while Gonzalez-Garay et al. (2022) 
assume a price of 3 €-cents per kWh during the day and 8 euro cents per 
kWh during the night. The provision of sufficient electricity from 
renewable sources is an enormous challenge in the upscaling of PtL 
production, as it requires substantial capital expenditures. Electricity 
generation capacity used for PtL production should be additional, in 
order not to compete with alternative uses required in the trans­
formation of power systems. It also favours locations where an efficient 
combination of different renewable power sources (such as photovol­
taics and wind) could be realized in order to buffer fluctuating power 
generation. 
In several cases where hydrotreatment is a process step in the con­
version pathway (e.g. HEFA, pyrolysis (PYR) or APR), a trade-off

between production costs and GHG reduction potential can be observed. 
When the required hydrogen originates from steam methane reforming 
(SMR), lower costs for the provided hydrogen can be achieved, while 
SMR releases substantial amounts of CO2. Water electrolysis can provide 
hydrogen with minimal lifecycle GHG emissions if renewable electricity 
is used, but costs are substantially higher. 
The MSPs calculated for SAF in techno-economic studies also depend 
on the assumptions made for revenues from co-products. Most, if not all, 
conversion pathways produce other chemicals and fuels in addition to 
SAF, and in some cases, electricity and heat. For plants not focused on 
SAF, this could even lead to negative prices for SAF if the costs of 
operation are already covered by other products (e.g. in the studies 
conducted by Alam et al., 2021; Klein et al., 2018). 
Assumptions on plant sizes and capacity have a direct impact on 
minimum selling prices due to economies of scale. The studies examined 
clearly show that there is a correlation between the capacity of bio­
refineries and decreasing costs per fuel production unit. Atsonios et al. 
(2015) show that the increase in plant size for a facility with gasification 
of biomass and methanol synthesis can reduce the MSP from initially 
2470.7 USD2020/t for a plant with 400 tons/biomass feedstock per day to 
2291.6 USD2020/t for 864 tons feedstock/day and 1772.4 EUR/kg for 
2000 tons feedstock/day. Similar findings are observed by Li et al. 
(2018), where an increase in plant capacity from 1.3 million liters per 
year to 13 million liters per year for a facility utilizing corncobs as 
feedstock with aqueous phase reforming (with Furfural and Levulinic 
acid as intermediates) reduces the MSP from 1853.6 USD2020/t to 
1342.2 USD2020/t. 
Techno-economic studies typically focus on the engineering dimen­
sion of SAF productions, making assumptions on feedstock prices, cap­
ital costs and process efficiency to estimate minimum selling prices. 
However, selling and market prices can differ substantially, depending 
on market structure. On the one hand, given the high number of 
different feedstocks and production pathways, there is likely to be a low 
level of concentration in supply of SAF, potentially leading to compet­
itive pricing in the SAF market. From an economic perspective, it would 
be welfare enhancing to have a global market for feedstock, interme­
diary products and SAF. However, differing sustainability criteria may 
impede global trading. For instance, SAF made from corn or sugar in 
North America is not eligble under the ReFuel EU regulation, as food and 
feed crops from agricultural land will not be accepted. On the other 
hand, blending quotas combined with the obligation to uplift 90% of the 
fuel required at each respective airport will lead to a reduction in price 
elasticity of demand. This, together with the likely limited supply of SAF 
has the potential to drive up SAF prices well above production costs. 
4. Availability and production outlook 
Production cost, availability and selling price are highly inter­
connected. Production cost, or minimum selling price as defined by 
techno-economic studies is mainly determined by the prices of the input 
factors (feedstocks and energy) and production (conversion processes, 
realization of economies of scale of industrial-sized facilities, and capital 
cost). However, airlines as future operators of SAF should be aware of 
the potential discrepancy between production costs and the customers’ 
willingness to pay. In a classic microeconomic setting, SAF prices will be 
determined by the interplay between supply (production cost and 
availability) and the demand. Blending mandates (see Section 2.3) are 
likely to lead to inelastic demand, as aircraft operators have no choice 
but to comply with the quota imposed. This can lead to high prices and 
supernormal profits for the suppliers of SAF, if the quantity supplied is 
inelastic. If supply reacts elastic to changes in price, high prices will 
normally send out a price signal that leads to an increase in the supplied 
quantity. However, when feedstocks, energy or process technology are 
constrained, stakeholders are not able to increase quantities. Hence, a

systemic analysis of SAF production processes with an outlook on po­
tential future quantities that can be supplied are important when eval­
uating policy objectives on blending mandates. 
4.1. Biomass-to-liquid availability 
The availability of SAF produced from biomass feedstocks is con­
strained by the availability of natural resources. For first-generation 
biomass feedstocks competing for food use, such as vegetable oils, 
wheat grain or corn, typical constraints are the availability of agricul­
tural land and harvest results. Moreover, due to sustainability issues, it is 
questionable whether some of the first-generation biogenic feedstocks 
should be actively promoted for SAF usage. For some feedstocks, when 
indirect land use changes are considered in the life-cycle assessment, 
total emissions (as measured in CO2eq) can be even higher than fossil jet 
fuel as outlines in Section 2.2. 
Non-food agricultural crops on marginal farmland, waste and resi­
dues have a potentially high emissions reduction potential and are also 
available in large quantities. Estimations of biomass availability have 
been conducted both in the context of SAF production, as well as in a 
more general context of the transition to renewable energies. Brosowski 
et al. (2019) have estimated the mobilizable potential of biomass in 
Germany. Agricultural by-products, such as animal manure or cereal 
straw have a potential in a range of 11.1–26.2 million tons and forestry 
by-products range from −0.8 to 10.9 million tons. DBFZ (2023) esti­
mates a technical potential of 4.3 million tons of cereal straw that could 
be mobilized in Germany. It should be noted, however, that the con­
version rates of feedstock-to-SAF from biomass are relatively low. Esti­
mated conversion rates from biomass to jet fuel are listed in Table 4. For 
residues and lignocellulosic biomass, most of the conversion pathways 
yield in less than 200 kg per ton of input biomass. 
Further issues can be caused by a competition for biogenic feed­
stocks, which could be either used for electricity, heating, and for fuels 
used in ground transport next to aviation. Hence, studies providing in­
formation on biomass availability does not necessarily impose that the 
biomass estimated will be fully available for aviation (see Table 5). 
4.2. Power-to-liquid availability 
At least in theory, power-to-liquid based fuels are unlimited in terms 
of feedstock availability, as they require electrical energy, hydrogen (e. 
g. from water electrolysis) and carbon (e.g. from carbon dioxide through 
direct air capture or concentrated streams). In practice, the availability 
of electricity from renewable sources is likely to limit PtL production. It 
is estimated that 1 kg of PtL fuel requires 42 kWh of electricity, assuming 
a mix of pure and scrubbed CO2 from point sources and a 20% share of 
direct air capture (Drünert et al., 2020). Subsequently, the electricity 
demand for the production of a high share of PtL fuels would be enor­
mous: for the production of 10.3 Mt of jet fuel (which equals 2019 
aviation fuel demand in Germany), Drünert et al. (2020) estimate an 
electricity demand of 440 TWh, which corresponds to about 80 % of the 
total electrical energy production of Germany in year 2022 (Fraunhofer 
ISE, 2023). Results in a similar order of magnitude were found by 
Gonzalez-Garay et al. (2022), estimating 298–361 TWh of Spain’s cur­
rent jet fuel demand could be met with power-to-liquid fuels. 
The price of PtL fuels depends largely on the price for electricity, but 
also depends on the capital cost of building PtL refineries and the effi­
ciency of the different process steps (such as electrolysis and the pro­
vision of carbon through direct air capture or concentrated streams). 
5. Conclusion 
Sustainable aviation fuels (SAF) will contribute to a large extent to 
the net zero CO2 roadmap in the aviation industry. In addition, SAF can 
also reduce other significant direct climate impacts of aviation such as 
the formation of cirrus clouds and contrails. However, in a competitive 
market environment, sustainable aviation fuels compete with other CO2 
mitigation options such as hydrogen or carbon offsetting regimes. In 
addition, different types of sustainable aviation fuels (SAF) compete 
with each other in terms of market prices due to different production 
processes and raw materials. This paper has reviewed a wide range of 
scientific studies to determine price ranges for different types of sus­
tainable aviation fuels based on minimum selling prices. These price 
estimations could potentially support market research and policy option 
development with respect to SAF blending mandates or future 
investments. 
Regarding SAF production, the Fischer-Tropsch (FT) conversion 
pathway has the highest average greenhouse gas (GHG) savings poten­
tial (almost 100%) compared to fossil-based jet fuel, followed by 
Alcohol-to-Jet (slightly above 60%), and HEFA (slightly below 60%). 
Among advanced biofuels, SAF produced from feedstocks of miscanthus, 
forest and agricultural residues, or municipal solid waste, and combined 
with the FT process can potentially reduce GHG emissions of about 90% 
to more than 100%. However, this legislative position in the EU (Eu­
ropean Council, 2022) is likely to be particularly challenging, as SAF 
production processes with a highly advanced technology readiness level 
and reasonable production and feedstock costs favoured e.g. in North 
America are explicitly ruled out in Europe, such as alcohol-to-jet from 
sugar- or starch-rich crops (sugar beet or corn) or HEFA from vegetable 
oils. In the EU, only agricultural feedstocks from waste or residues are 
acceptable for accounting as SAF under the ReFuel EU Aviation 
regulation. 
Market prices for SAF are likely to remain well above the price for 
fossil jet fuel. Therefore, regulatory policy and respective incentives will 
have an impact on future price competitiveness. SAFs produced with the 
HEFA process are expected to achieve the lowest prices with a minimum 
selling price of 1068 USD2020/t in the lowest quartile of studies but still 
well above the 2010–2021 average for fossil jet fuel of 690 USD2020/t. 
However, cost reductions for HEFA-based fuels are expected to be 
limited as their technology readiness level is relatively high, so prices

will likely be more dependent on feedstock costs. power-to-liquid fuels 
have an availability advantage that is basically only constrained by the 
provision of green electricity but minimum selling prices well above 
2000 USD2020/t are currently not competitive. Nevertheless, several 
studies suggest a high cost reduction potential. Schmidt et al. (2018) 
estimate production costs of 1393 USD2020/t for PtL fuels in 2050 based 
on a concentrated CO2 source with the methanol synthesis pathway. 
Drünert et al. (2020) estimate minimum selling prices for PtL fuels of 
1610 USD2020/t in 2050, also assuming a concentrated CO2 source. 
An essential factor in the decarbonization of aviation through the use 
of sustainable aviation fuels (SAFs) is the availability of SAFs to meet 
environmental policies and achieve established climate goals. Although 
several projects are in the planning stages to scale up production ca­
pacities, SAF production is still in its early stages. The SAF dashboard by 
Boeing (2023) offers a summary of projected SAF capacities per region 
or country, relative to the expected consumption of jet fuel. This high­
lights potential shortfalls and gaps between the need for SAF and the 
production capacities that may arise. To prevent shortages in SAF sup­
ply, collaboration among various stakeholders in the aviation industry is 
crucial. Underwriting memorandums of understanding (MoU) for joint 
SAF production, (Airbus, 2022) can be a strategic approach. Coopera­
tion between different stakeholders, including the aviation industry and 
institutional stakeholders, is particularly important in the early stages, 
as the adoption of new technology demands significant investment for 
ramping up SAF production. 
In addition, the aviation sector needs to be mindful of potential de­
mand competition from other transport modes. In particular, maritime 
transport is increasingly turning to sustainable fuels, given that there are 
limited alternatives to decarbonize large container ships. This highlights 
the importance of considering broader inter-sectoral dynamics when 
planning and implementing sustainable fuel strategies within the avia­
tion industry. Future research could address pricing strategies for SAF 
based on co-products, the in-depth analysis of regional markets, or 
pricing impacts of policies and tax incentives.
