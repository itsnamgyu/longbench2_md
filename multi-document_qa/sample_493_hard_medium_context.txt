Accessing the Economic Bulletin Board 
Preface 
PREFACE 
In May 1983, the Joint Committee on Printing (JCP) formed an Ad Hoc Committee on 
Depository Library Access to Federal Automated Data Bases. The ad hoc committee, chaired 
by Bernadine Abbott Hoduski of the JCP staff, was composed of individuals nominated and 
appointed from the public and private sectors who were involved in the production,
dissemination, and use of electronic information. Their charge was " . . . to evaluate the 
feasibility and desirability of providing access to Federal Government information in electronic 
formats to depository libraries."1 
The committee's final report affirmed " . . . the principle that the Federal Government should 
provide access to Federal information, as defined in sec. 1901, U.S.C., title 44, in electronic 
form through the depository library system" and suggested that the economic feasibility of 
such an action be investigated. It proposed a pilot project program, under the direction of JCP 
and the Superintendent of Documents, through which " . . . depository libraries will receive 
Federal information in electronic form and provide it to the general public free of charge."2 
This report is the third in a series to be released following the conclusion of the 
implementation phase of the pilot project program. It describes and evaluates the findings of 
one of two projects that involved online dissemination of Government publications. 
I believe that this report provides useful data on the costs of disseminating Government 
information online. No less useful are the insights offered by the report into the effects and 
benefits of providing electronic access in depository libraries for public users of Government 
information.

Executive Summary 
Accessing the Economic Bulletin Board 
Executive Summary 
In 1987, the Joint Committee on Printing (JCP) commissioned the Government Printing 
Office (GPO) to conduct tests for determining the feasibility and practicality of 
disseminating electronic Government information to the general public through the 
Federal Depository Library Program (FDLP). This report presents the findings of the 
Economic Bulletin Board (EBB) Pilot Project, one of five projects approved and 
undertaken to address the JCP request. 
The EBB Pilot Project provided the opportunity for 100 test site libraries to have online 
access to more than 400 files on a bulletin board for current economic news and 
statistics. 
A Test Site Selection Survey was distributed to all 1,398 depositories in 
order to identify the libraries that were interested in taking part in the Pilot Project. 
The 100 test site libraries were selected from the group of 376 libraries that expressed 
interest in participating. Among the 745 libraries that declined to be considered for the 
pilot project, the most frequently mentioned reason was insufficient user interest. 
Almost 24 percent of those that declined cited a lack of equipment for accessing the 
data base [Table 3-1]. 
During the pilot project period, 93 libraries conducted a total of 3,247 online EBB 
sessions [Table 4-5]. Usage was disproportionate across the libraries, as 17 percent of 
the test sites accounted for more than half of all sessions. Computer work stations were 
generally available to most users and, when the EBB was dialed by modem, the line 
was usually not busy. 
Users reported accessing 120 of the more than 400 files on EBB during the pilot test 
period [Table 4-6]. More than half (56 percent) of the libraries reported using the EBB 
to provide reference services for patrons, while one-third reported using it to download 
updates of frequently requested statistics [Chart 4-5]. 
In terms of the EBB’s acceptance and utility, 79% of respondents to one survey
reported getting the information they were looking for from the EBB [Chart 4-8]. 
Sixty-nine percent were generally or very satisfied with EBB [Chart 4-9]. 
Seventy-
seven percent of respondents to another survey reported that the EBB made their work 
easier rather than harder [Chart 4-10]. A substantial majority of users indicated that 
the EBB provided information that is more up-to-date than what was available in the 
library before. 
However, survey results were more divided over whether the EBB 
offered a more useful format or whether it provided new information [Table 4-7 and 
Chart 4-11]. 
A majority of EBB users believed there was some overlap with certain Government 
documents [Chart 4-12]. However, when respondents representing the libraries were 
asked if EBB access would be an acceptable substitute for specific titles, such as

Executive Summary 
Consumer Price Index, most did not consider the EBB an acceptable substitute [Table 
4-10]. 
Almost three-quarters (74 percent) of the libraries encountered one or more major 
problems in using the EBB. The problem mentioned most frequently (by 26 libraries) 
was that the EBB was not user friendly or lacked a search capability [Table 4-11], Of 
the 27 distinct improvements that libraries suggested for the EBB, the one most often 
cited was that more detailed information be provided as to EBB file content, location, 
and update times [Table 4-12]. 
The Government cost of the EBB Pilot Project was $15,000, the amount paid by GPO 
to the Department of Commerce as a transfer payment. Pilot project libraries reported 
an average of $289 per library in staff expenses for setting-up EBB and for training 
staff and others to use the system [Table 5-2]. The libraries also covered their own 
telecommunications costs, which averaged $89 per library for the Pilot Project period 
[Table 5-3]. The average total EBB cost to libraries was $463 [Table 5-4]. Asked 
whether library cost considerations may have served to restrict library use of the EBB, 
more than two-thirds (69%) of EBB users responding to one survey indicated that such 
considerations restricted use to "little or no extent". 
The EBB Pilot Project demonstrated the technical feasibility of disseminating 
Government documents online to the general public through the FDLP. 
Although 
useful information was obtained about the practicality of online dissemination, the 
results are not conclusive due to limitations in the scope of the EBB Pilot Project and 
its evaluation.

Section 1, Introduction 
Accessing the Economic Bulletin Board 
INTRODUCTION 
Background of the Pilot Projects 
Since the 19th century, the Federal Government has been making its publications available for 
free use by its citizens in local communities across the country. 
Congress established the 
Federal Depository Library Program (FDLP) to bring Government information1 into every 
congressional district in the Nation.2 
The FDLP is administered by the Superintendent of Documents, U.S. Government Printing 
Office (GPO), with oversight by the Joint Committee on Printing (JCP). It is a partnership of 
Government publishers, GPO, and approximately 1,400 academic, public, Federal, and other 
libraries. This partnership allows Federal publishers to use the dissemination mechanisms of 
GPO and the services of the designated depository libraries to make their publications available 
to the public.3 
Dissemination of publications to depository libraries was done primarily in paper format until 
the late 1970s. 
Microfiche format was introduced in 1977 for the purpose of reducing 
administrative costs to the FDLP4, and, by the end of fiscal year 1991, more than 62 percent 
of the publications distributed through the FDLP were in that format.5 
Concern has been expressed in recent years about the lack of public access to electronically-
stored Federal Government information. As early as 1979, the American Library Association, 
in its support of a proposed revision of title 44 of the U.S. Code, affirmed that distribution to 
depository libraries should include publications in electronic databases as well as those in the 
traditional paper and microfiche formats.6 
The JCP's Ad Hoc Committee on Depository Library Access to Federal Automated Data Bases 
'in this document, the terms "Government information" and "Government publication" are used interchangeably. 
According to GPO's 
General Counsel, " . . . whenever an agency 'publishes' information, that is, intends to, and does, disseminate it to the general public—in 
whatever form—the information constitutes a 'Government publication' within the meaning of [Title 44 U.S. Code] Section 1901. This 
would include, therefore, a publication in electronic format."

Dissemination of Federal Agency Publications in Electronic Format", Memorandum. May 22, 1989, p. 5. 
2 Authorization for the FDLP is in Title 44 U.S. Code Chapter 19. 
3 During the fiscal year 1991, Library Programs Service (LPS), the operational arm of the FDLP within GPO, distributed nearly 27 million 
copies of publications from the legislative, executive, and judicial branches of Government to the designated depositories.

Accessing the Economic Bulletin Board 
Section 1, Introduction 
recommended that the economic feasibility of dissemination of electronic information to
depositories be investigated through a pilot project program.7 In 1987, JCP asked GPO to
implement pilot projects to test the committee's belief that " . . . new and emerging electronic
technologies could make it possible to distribute government information to Depository
Libraries at substantial cost savings to the program."8 
In response to the JCP request, the Superintendent of Documents established the Information 
Technology Program (ITP) to coordinate the planning of the recommended pilot projects.9 A
single full-time position was designated for the ITP while GPO sought funding to conduct the 
pilots according to the ad hoc committee guidelines.10 
In 1988, a draft plan for the pilot projects was published for comment.11 
Entitled 
Dissemination of Information in Electronic Format to Federal Depository Libraries, it
described five discrete dissemination activities with estimated costs. The pilot project plan was 
approved by JCP in May 1989, and, as the initial request for appropriated funds to conduct the 
pilots was rejected, GPO agreed to conduct the pilot projects with existing resources.12 The 
General Accounting Office (GAO) was enlisted to provide technical assistance to GPO for the 
evaluation activities. 
Goal and Objectives of the Pilot Projects 
JCP provided the goal for the pilot projects when they asked GPO to begin work on a program
to carry out the tests as recommended by the ad hoc committee. 
In a letter to the Public
Printer, Hon. Frank Annunzio, then Chairman of the JCP, stated that the purpose of the pilot 
projects was to " . . . test the feasibility and practicality of disseminating electronic 
government publications to Depository Libraries in electronic formats."13 
The ad hoc committee established objectives for the pilot projects in a 1987 report that

In the Appropriations Hearings for fiscal year (FY) 1988, the Public Printer requested $800,000 to initiate the first year of a proposed 5­
year pilot project program. This request was "not allowed" pending release of a study by the Office of Technology Assessment—a study 
which came to be called Informing the Nation. [See: U.S. Congress, House of Representatives, Committee on Appropriations, Report to 
Accompany H.R. 2714: Legislative Branch Appropriations Bill, 1988, 100th Cong., 1st sess.. Report 100-173, p. 30.J Appropriated funds 
were not requested in either FY 1989 or FY 1990. In the FY 1991 budget for the Office of Superintendent of Documents, Salaries and 
Expenses, $80,000 was appropriated for the pilot projects.

Accompany S. 3207: Legislative Branch Appropriations Bill, 1991, 101st Cong., 2d sess.. Report 101-533, p. 36.[ The costs for conducting 
the pilot projects have, in essence, been funded out of existing appropriations.

Accessing the Economic Bulletin Board 
Section 1, Introduction 
indicated that " . . . both the usefulness and cost of disseminating Federal information in 
electronic format . . . should be tested by projects that included both online and distributed 
dissemination".14 To accomplish these objectives within the resources allocated, projects were 
selected and evaluations were designed that would be able to provide information on the 
following: 
• 
Ability of the Government to disseminate information in electronic formats through the 
FDLP. 
• 
Integration of Government electronic information into depository libraries. 
• 
Use and usefulness of Government information in electronic formats. 
• 
Costs of distributing Government information to depository libraries in electronic 
format. 
Description of the Pilot Projects 
The pilot project plan included project descriptions and estimated costs of different types of 
Federal agency databases that would be disseminated to depository libraries using electronic 
technologies. 
Three of the five pilot projects involved agency databases distributed on compact disc, 
read-only-memory (CD-ROM).15 The Bureau of the Census' Test Disc #2 Pilot Project, the 
Environmental Protection Agency's Toxic Release Inventory Pilot Project, and the JCP's 
Congressional Record Pilot Project each featured this space-saving technology that evolved 
from audio compact discs in the mid-1980s. 
The remaining two projects examined depository library access to online databases of the 
Department of Commerce and the Department of Energy. 
Pilot Project Reports 
Each of the pilot projects is to be fully described in individual project reports which will be 
consolidated into a report of all pilot project findings. The Economic Bulletin Board Pilot 
Project is the subject of this report. 
Findings from the EBB study are conveyed in the body of the report, with detailed backup data 
in the appendixes. The Survey Results section supplies details about most of the data collected

The Cost Analysis section describes the Government and library costs
associated with the EBB Pilot Project. 
The Economic Bulletin Board 
The Economic Bulletin Board was established in 1985 by the Department of Commerce to 
provide timely access to statistics and other current economic news. It contains a variety of
data published by Commerce Department offices and several other sources, including the
International Trade Administration, Bureau of Economic Analysis, Census Bureau, The Bureau
of Labor Statistics, Federal Reserve Board, and the Treasury Department. 
Examples of 
information available through the Economic Bulletin Board include the Consumer Price Index
(CPI), Gross National Produce (GNP), employment statistics, and Daily Trade Opportunities 
for Exporters (TOPS). 
In 1990 there were about 2,300 paid subscribers to the Economic 
Bulletin Board service. 
The Economic Bulletin Board is available to dial-up users 24 hours a day. It typically contains 
about 30 megabytes of data in over 400 files. Archival data is not retained on the bulletin 
board. Rather, data files are replaced as soon as new information becomes available. Many 
widely-used statistics, such as the CPI, are loaded onto the bulletin board within 15 minutes of
their official release. Two-thirds of the files on the bulletin board are updated on a quarterly 
or monthly basis. Selected information, such as TOPS, may be updated daily. Many files on 
the Economic Bulletin Board are text files, and contain data exactly as it appeared in 
Commerce Department press releases. Other files are in Lotus 1-2-3 (or compatible) format to 
facilitate data manipulation by the end user. Appendix G contains a complete list of the files
that were available on the Economic Bulletin Board in July 1989. 
Online bulletins, which contain general economic news, calendars of release dates for 
upcoming news, and points of contact in economic statistical agencies, are designed to be read
while signed onto the EBB. The core of the EBB-representing over 95% of the data on the
bulletin board—
is comprised of files that are intended for downloading to a PC for later 
viewing or manipulation. Such files include the major economic press releases and specific
economic information. Users equipped with dumb terminals can view or print out the files 
locally. In addition, the EBB provides programs for accomplishing "housekeeping chores", 
such as changing passwords and leaving messages for the system operator. 
The following examples illustrate the kinds of questions that can be answered using the EBB: 
• 
What was the Consumer Price Index just released by the Commerce Department? 
• 
What are the latest figures available on single family home sales for the U.S.? 
• 
How can I find out the latest Producer Price Index issued by the Bureau of Labor
Statistics?

Section 2, Study Approach and Methodology 
STUDY APPROACH AND METHODOLOGY 
The intent of the EBB pilot project study was to develop information for the JCP about the
feasibility and practicality of electronic information dissemination through the Federal
Depository Library Program. The approach and methodology for the evaluation of the EBB
project was derived from the project plan developed by the JCP, GPO, and Department of
Commerce and was designed with consideration of the limited time and resources available to 
support the study. The intent of the evaluation approach and methodology was to provide
descriptive data about the use and usefulness of the EBB, the library environment in which it 
was accessed, and EBB dissemination costs under a library cost-sharing model. The study
approach included a site selection process that provided all depository libraries with (1) an 
opportunity to indicate interest in participating in the project, and (2) a chance for each
interested library to be randomly selected for participation. 
Study Approach 
Considerations and Limitations 
The primary approach adopted for the EBB evaluation was to use multiple survey 
methodologies administered to participating depository libraries and EBB users. These surveys 
were designed to obtain descriptive information on various aspects of online dissemination of
EBB information-its effects, benefits, and some associated costs. The information obtained
from the surveys was supplemented by data recorded by the EBB host computer which tracked
the number of online sessions and associated charges. The choice of this study approach was
dictated by a number of design considerations in conjunction with project resource limitations.1
It was not possible to draw a statistically representative sample of the entire depository library
population for the study since the project plan limited participation to 100 test sites that
voluntarily chose to participate. In order to be statistically representative, the sample would
need to be larger, randomly selected, and not restricted to those who volunteered to
participate. A significant drop-out rate or refusal to participate in the study would also have to
be avoided. 
The site selection process, however, was designed to assess the extent of library interest in 
participating in the project and ensure that the libraries randomly selected from interested
libraries would approach the mix of libraries in the depository program on the dimensions of
type of library, library size, and geographical location. 
Other considerations influencing development of the study approach and methods included: 
Between 1989 and late 1991, the EBB pilot project, along with three other dissemination pilot projects, was staffed entirely by GPO's
Manager of the Information Technology Program with technical assistance from GAO on a half-time basis.

► 
The need to collect a substantial and diverse amount of study data from participating 
libraries and knowledgeable individuals during and immediately after the project's 
seven-month period of operation. 
Survey methods standardized the data collection 
process and preparation of data for analysis. 
• 
Balancing the detail with which specific dissemination issues or effects could be 
examined with the data collection burden placed on participating libraries and 
individuals. Data collection procedures and controls that could potentially improve the 
amount and quality of data but impose a significant burden on project participants were 
not attempted. 
Requests for information needed to be reasonable and realistic. 
Moreover, extensive and detailed data collection requirements were not likely to be 
successfully implemented at the sites. 
• 
The inability of the EBB host computer to identify and track the files accessed by users 
required that libraries and individual users be queried about their use of EBB files. 
• 
The need to ensure that the study approach assessed but did not determine library 
procedures for providing access to the EBB. Study methods that significantly interfered 
with or altered the way the library would choose to provide access to the EBB service 
would be less likely to yield data indicative of typical or normal library operations. 
Library and user participation in the pilot project study was strictly voluntary. 
• 
Infeasibility of developing and implementing a conventional cost/benefit assessment 
given (1) the limited correspondence between the contents of EBB files and paper 
publications, and (2) the time and project resources needed to develop methods for 
comprehensively identifying and assessing costs and benefits (e.g., indirect costs to 
libraries). 
Test Site Selection 
Before the pilot project study could begin, a site selection method was established to determine 
which libraries would participate in the pilot project study. 
The site selection plan was 
designed to support two objectives—
to select sites that reflected the diverse types of libraries 
that comprise the depository community and to select sites that would attempt electronic 
information dissemination under special or innovative circumstances. To achieve these two 
objectives, the site selection process was divided into two parts. 
Eighty-six of the 100 
available test site slots were to be randomly selected from groups of candidate libraries cross-
classified on the dimensions of library size, library type, and geographical location (e.g., 
large, academic, western library). The purpose of the selection process was to obtain a mix of 
test site libraries that approximated the proportionate representation of these groups in the 
depository population. 
The remaining 14 test site slots were set aside for discretionary 
assignment based on the library's proposal for using the EBB service. Depository type was 
also of interest, but maintaining proportional representation of regional libraries to selective 
libraries would severely limit the inclusion of regional libraries as test sites.

regional library's role as a central resource for information dissemination in the depository
program, an additional selection requirement was set that, overall, roughly 20% of the project 
participants be regional libraries. 
In accordance with the site selection plan, test site libraries were chosen out of a pool of 
depository libraries that had indicated their desire to participate in the EBB pilot project study.
In volunteering to be considered as an EBB test site, a library agreed to comply with specified
conditions for participation. If selected as a test site, a library would have to submit a brief 
plan outlining 1) how access to the EBB would be provided by their institution, 2) how the
library would inform its user community about the availability of the EBB, and 3) the steps 
that the library would take to train its staff and users on using the EBB. 
The libraries selected as test sites were given online access to the EBB, asked to submit their 
project implementation plans within 30 days of going online, and designate a staff member to 
serve as Project Coordinator. 
Study Methodology 
Four survey data collection instruments (DCIs) were developed to collect pilot project data.
Three of these surveys were administered in paper format and the fourth survey in electronic
format. This electronic format survey was presented to users when they logged on to the EBB.
User responses to the electronic survey DCI were recorded by the EBB host computer. The
EBB system operator installed and maintained this online survey DCI as well as the data base 
for tracking the number of sessions and associated session charges for each participating
library. All surveys contained a mix of closed-ended and open-ended questions. The open-
ended survey questions gave libraries and EBB users an opportunity to express views in their 
own words. The DCIs were administered at different times during the course of the pilot 
project. 
Data Collection Instruments 
The four survey DCIs used for obtaining pilot project data were developed through a joint
effort of the GPO, GAO, and Department of Commerce. 
The process of DCI content
development was based on a review of pilot project background literature and other DCIs used
to assess online information dissemination. The survey DCIs were pretested with small groups
of depository librarians and revised on the basis of their comments and observations.

Section 2, Study Approach and Methodology 
Accesing the Economic Bulletin Board 
Test Site Selection Survey: This survey (See Appendix A) was a short, 14-item questionnaire 
that was designed for use in the initial site selection process. It was sent to all depository 
libraries before the project began. Responses to certain items on this survey were used to 
identify the pool of candidate libraries from which to select project test sites. Questions on 
this survey also assessed the extent of library interest in participating or the reasons why 
libraries declined consideration as candidate test sites. 
Library Survey: The Library Survey (See Appendix C) was designed to capture a single, 
institutional response from the library test sites at the end of the project period. This survey 
featured 15 multipart questions that included requests for information on: 
• 
staff time and other library resources expended on EBB activities 
• 
telecommunications costs 
• 
the use and value of the EBB in the library 
• 
problems encountered in using the EBB 
• 
suggestions for improving EBB services 
For most of the survey items requesting data on EBB-related expenditure of library resources, 
there was an accompanying data source question. The data source question asked respondents 
to indicate whether the figures being provided were based on estimates or were actually 
monitored during the project. 
The responses to the data source questions were used 
analytically as quality control checks to assess if there were significant differences in reported 
figures as a function of the data collection methods used by the library. 
Online User Survey: This questionnaire, using a special survey function available on the EBB, 
was presented to users when they logged onto the bulletin board. Although limitations in the 
EBB survey software restricted the length and structure of the questions that could be posed or 
the responses that could be given, the online survey provided greater control over the data 
collection process and reliably captured user responses concerning the files they were going to 
access at the time of EBB use. 
The survey presented several subsections which respondents selected on the basis of whether 
they were library staff or library patrons and whether they had completed an Online Survey 
before. 
When EBB users encountered the Online Survey for the first time, they completed a 
questionnaire (25 item survey for library staff, 29 item survey for library patrons) that covered 
such topics as: 
• 
their previous use of the EBB 
• 
how they learned to use the EBB

• 
EBB support and accessibility 
• 
usefulness of the EBB information 
• 
level of satisfaction 
Most of the questions asked of users who were library staff and users who were library patrons
were the same. Library patrons were asked 4 additional questions concerning their use of EBB
information and their profession. If an EBB user was presented with the Online Survey again after
logging onto the system, they were asked to complete a short, follow-on survey that requested a
listing of the files they intended to access for review or downloading during that session. Under
this arrangement, EBB users completed the longer survey once-the first time it was presented to
them—
and then completed the shorter, file identification survey on all subsequent occasions when 
they encountered the Online Survey. 
Offline User Survey: This survey, a short eight-item questionnaire, was designed to obtain direct 
feedback from library patrons who obtained information from the EBB, but did not directly access
the bulletin board (i.e., a library staff member accessed the EBB in response to the patron's
request). The survey inquired about the usefulness of the EBB information, patron's use of that
information, and their profession. The survey was limited to a few items in order to facilitate the 
immediate completion and return of the survey at the time it was given to the patron. 
Site Selection Process 
All libraries were mailed information packets describing the EBB pilot project, the EBB files, 
requirements for participation in the project, and the site selection process. A copy of the Test Site 
Selection Survey was also included. 
Libraries were instructed to review the package and then
complete and return the survey, thereby indicating whether or not they were interested in being 
considered as a candidate test site. 
Libraries indicating they were interested in participating in the project constituted the pool of
eligible test sites from which the participating sites were selected. 
For selection of 86 test site 
participants, the candidate libraries were grouped according to the cross-classified attributes of 
library size, library type, and geographical location (e.g., large, academic, eastern libraries). 
Libraries were randomly selected by computer from each group to fill the number of test site slots
allotted to that group. 
Allotment of test site slots to the groups was based on each group's
proportional representation in the depository library population. Groups whose representation in 
the population was so small that allotment of even a single test site slot was not possible were 
pooled into a single, larger set whose collective size obtained a proportional allocation of eight test
site slots. These test site slots were filled by random selection from all libraries in the combined
group. Selection of regional libraries preceded selection of selective libraries in order to meet the
requirement that 20% of the test sites be regional libraries. A statistical test of the distribution of
randomly chosen regional libraries indicated that it was not significantly different from the
population distribution of all regional libraries in the cross-classified groups.

Section 2, Study Approach and Methodology 
Accesing the Economic Bulletin Board 
Responses of libraries also expressing interest in being selected for one of the remaining 14 
discretionary test site slots were initially reviewed by GPO and the final selection of the 14 sites 
was done by Depository Library Council members. Further information on responses to the Test 
Site Selection Survey are presented in the Study Participants and Response Rates section. 
Data Collection Process 
The data collection process began with libraries completing and returning the Test Site Selection 
Survey. The notification letter sent to libraries chosen as test sites asked the libraries to submit an 
EBB implementation plan within 30 days of going online. This letter described the material that 
should be included in the implementation plan and also the data that libraries should collect for the 
project evaluation. 
Libraries were informed that they should use logs or other recordkeeping 
methods to track or otherwise monitor EBB accessibility, use of EBB information, and the 
expenditure of staff time or funds on EBB-related activities. 
Equipment, set-up, training, and 
telecommunication costs were specifically mentioned. 
Although the Online Survey was to be implemented shortly after libraries began accessing the EBB, 
the demands of other pilot projects on limited staff resources delayed development and installation 
of the survey until the fourth month of the project. 
Libraries were randomly divided into three 
groups and presented with the Online Survey on a weekly rotating basis. 
This procedure was 
adopted in order to reduce the data collection burden that would be placed on users if the survey 
appeared on their EBB computer screens every time they logged on for the rest of the project 
period. Development of the Library Survey was also delayed for the same reasons and distribution 
of this DCI did not occur until approximately one month before the end of the test period. 
Resource limitations also precluded independent verification of library or user responses on the 
DCIs. 
The Offline User Survey was developed late in the study period after review of the patron response 
count for the first month of the Online User Survey's operation. 
The delayed initiation of the 
Online Survey coupled with the limited number of test sites that permitted patrons to personally log 
on to the EBB significantly reduced the rate at which direct feedback from patrons was being 
obtained online. The Offline User Survey was implemented as a supplement to the Online Survey 
as a method of improving the collection of data from library patrons who obtained EBB 
information. 
A final data collection packet containing the Library Survey and copies of the Offline User Survey 
was mailed to each of the test site libraries. Each library's Project Coordinator-whose role it was 
to administer the project activities, collect data, and return all appropriate forms by the deadline 
dates—
was asked to complete the Library Survey after consulting with other library staff who had 
relevant knowledge or involvement in the library's EBB experience. 
Project Coordinators were 
given instructions to distribute the Offline Survey to patrons who obtained EBB information. 
Instructions stated that each patron obtaining EBB information was to complete the survey only 
once, not every time they made a request that required accessing the EBB. The Library Survey 
and all completed Offline User Surveys were to be returned at the end of the study period.

Section 2, Study Approach and Methodology 
A brief chronology of project activities and data collection events follows: 
January 6, 1990: 
All depository libraries are mailed EBB information packets and are 
solicited to become applicants for the pilot project test site slots. 
April 19, 1990\ Of the 361 library applicants, 100 are selected to serve as pilot project test 
sites. 
June 1, 1990: Online access to EBB begins for test site libraries; libraries are asked to submit
their project implementation plans within 30 days. 
October 1, 1990: Online surveys of librarians and EBB users commence on a rotating basis an
continue through December 31, 1990. 
November 20, 1990: Final data collection packet is mailed to each of the 100 EBB test sites;
return date for the completed DCI's is set for January 15, 1991. 
December 31, 1990: EBB online access period ends for test site libraries. 
March-April 1991: Follow-up efforts mounted by GPO to collect outstanding DCI's from
library test sites. 
Data Processing and Analysis 
At the conclusion of follow-up efforts to obtain outstanding survey DCIs from the test site 
libraries, data processing and analysis activities were initiated jointly by GPO and GAO.
Processing of the paper format DCI's prior to data entry involved checking for duplicate 
returns, verifying the accuracy of the depository library numbers that were reported, checking 
that instructions for answering items were followed, and applying a content code to 
respondents' written answers to open-ended questions. 
Content codes were developed and 
applied to the open-ended questions on the Library Survey. These codes made it possible to
automate, analyze, and summarize respondents' open-ended comments. 
Computer files were created and merged for test site library responses from the Test Site
Selection Survey, the Library Survey, and the session and charge data were automatically 
tracked by the EBB. This library master file also included information from a limited content
analysis of library EBB implementation plans. Responses to the Online Users Survey and the 
Offline Users Survey were maintained as separate files. 
All data keying was double-entry 
verified and data cleanup programs were run to check for out-of-range values, data outliers,
conflicting responses, failure to follow question "skip" patterns, and duplicate open-ended
codes to the same item. 
When indicated, and possible, library project coordinators were
contacted to verify or modify suspect data.

Section 2, Study Approach and Methodology 
Accesing the Economic Bulletin Board 
The purpose of the data analysis was to provide a preliminary, quantitative description of 
library and user experience with the EBB. 
Responses to survey items were interpreted as 
indicators of project effects and benefits. 
For example, responses to items addressing 
improvement in access to information were interpreted as assessments of benefit. The primary 
analytic approach consisted of generating frequency of response distributions to survey items 
either in total or broken out by library type and library size. For certain data elements, mostly 
measures of cost and staff time, means and medians were computed. 
In general, when 
summary statistics that comprise more than one data element per library are reported, the 
contributing data elements are combined for each library first before the overall statistic is 
computed across the number of libraries providing data. 
Other analyses were also done. One analysis involved combining and editing file access data 
from the Library Survey and the Online User Survey to produce a master list of all EBB files 
identified as being 
used during 
the pilot project. 
Another analysis 
computed 
telecommunication cost-per-session across geographical regions. All data were analyzed using 
SAS software. SAS output was then transferred to Microsoft spreadsheet software, Excel, for 
generating charts and tables. 
In evaluating the survey results presented in subsequent sections, certain observations and 
qualifications about the data and the analysis process should be made. With the exception of 
the session data that was tracked automatically by the EBB computer, all survey responses are 
self-reported and of unknown reliability. 
A data quality analysis using the data source 
questions on the Library Survey indicated that the general tendency was for libraries to report 
figures that were based on estimates. 
In most cases, there were variations in results as a 
function of whether the data reported were based on an estimate versus actually monitored. 
However, the differences were generally not extreme or indicative of significant impact. Such 
differences are reported in the results section when they are considered significant.

Section 3, Study Participants and Response Rates 
Study Participants and Response Rates 
The number of libraries participating in the FDLP varies as new institutions are designated and
others leave the system. 
Information about the libraries is regularly collected through the 
Biennial Survey that is conducted by GPO's Library Programs Service. 
The libraries are 
typically described according to the following categories: depository status, library type, and
library size. In 1990, when the EBB pilot project was initiated, there were 1,398 libraries in 
the program. It was from this depository library population that libraries were selected to be 
EBB test sites. 
Test Site Selection Survey Response Rate 
The Test Site Selection Survey, which was distributed to all 1,398 libraries in January 1990, 
was completed and returned by 1,121 (80%) libraries. One third of the returns (376) indicated 
that the library wished to be considered as a test site candidate. These libraries constituted the
pool of libraries to be used in selecting 86 of the 100 test site slots. Of these libraries 255 also 
indicated that they wished to be considered for selection as one of the discretionary site slots. 
The 745 libraries that answered the EBB participation question in the negative were asked to
identify their reason(s) for not wanting to participate. Their responses are shown in Table 3-1.

Selected Sites 
Using the site selection process described in the Study Approach and Methodology section, 101 
libraries were selected to participate as EBB test sites. (The original sample of 100 test sites 
changed to 101 libraries, when one additional library was named to replace a library that 
decided to drop out of the EBB pilot project.) This group of selected libraries constituted 27% 
of those libraries that expressed interest in participating in the pilot project and 7% of the 
general depository library population. Table 3-2 shows the profile of selected EBB sites along 
with those of all candidate sites and the depository library population.

Relative to the distribution of libraries by size and type in the general depository population, 
large libraries were proportionately over-represented in the selected test site group while small 
size libraries and "other" libraries were under-represented. Geographical distribution of the 
test site libraries is generally in accord with the population distribution. 
Several factors contributed to the greater presence of large libraries in the test site group. The 
candidate pool from which sites were to be selected contained more large and fewer small 
libraries than the general population. 
Likewise, there were fewer "other" libraries in the 
candidate pool than the general population. 
For three of the cross-classified "small-other" 
groups, there were no libraries responding to the Test Site Selection Survey indicating that 
they wanted to be considered as candidate sites. 
Consequently, more large libraries were 
available for selection while small and other libraries were scarce. Large libraries dominated 
the selection of discretionary sites and the random selection of eight libraries from the group 
created by combining cross-classified groups whose individual representation in the population 
was not large enough for allocation of a single test site slot.

Library Survey Response Rate 
Library Surveys were returned by 92 of the test sites. The distribution of libraries returning
surveys was essentially the same by size, library type, and geographical location as the
distribution of EBB test sites presented in Table 3-2 (i.e., nonresponse was not associated with 
any particular group of libraries). Records kept by the EBB host computer indicated that all 
the libraries responding to the Library Survey used the EBB. 
EBB Users 
EBB users are those persons who completed either the multi-section Online User Survey or the
Offline User Survey during the course of the pilot project. Assessments of the EBB were 
obtained from 197 users at 54 test sites. There were 121 library patrons who completed an
Offline User Survey and 76 respondents who completed the Online Survey's initial 25 or 29 
item section. Respondents to the Online survey consisted of both library staff (63) and library 
patrons (13) who had directly accessed the EBB and encountered the Online Survey. Table 3-3
shows the distribution of libraries by size and type providing user survey responses and the
associated number of user returns associated with each group.

In general, users answering the Online User Survey are predominantly library staff with
previous, direct experience obtaining information from the EBB. During the session when
users encountered the Online Survey, only 23% of the respondents identified themselves as 
first-time users. 
Of these respondents 31% had accessed the EBB from two to six times 
before, and 47% had logged on more than seven times previously. In contrast, respondents to 
the Offline User survey are exclusively library patrons who did not have direct access to the
EBB. 
The majority of these respondents (79%) indicated that they had not obtained
information from the EBB before. 
Library patrons who obtained information from the EBB were asked on both the Online Survey
and Offline User Survey to identify their employment status. 
Table 3-4 presents their 
responses to this item for both surveys combined.

Another section of the Online User Survey consisted of a short follow-on set of questions that 
respondents who had completed the initial, longer section of the survey were to answer if, in a 
subsequent EBB session, they were presented with the survey again. The short form was designed 
to identify those files that the user intended to access during the session, as the EBB computer 
could not track this information. There were 173 completed Online Survey short forms obtained 
from 38 libraries. 
Since a single user could respond more than once to the short form of the 
survey, the quantity of short form returns obtained during the study only reflect the number of 
times the form was completed by users when they logged on and were presented with the survey. 
It is neither a count of individual users nor a comprehensive indicator of file usage since (1) 
libraries were presented with the Online Survey on a rotating basis and (2) EBB system records 
show some users chose not to respond to this section of the survey when it was presented to them. 
Table 3-5 shows those libraries by size and type that are the sources of data on EBB file usage.

It should be noted that the user feedback reported in the Survey Results section came chiefly from 
large libraries and academic libraries. While this is due, in part, to the oversampling that occurred 
in the site selection process, a review of the users providing feedback shows that the representation 
is somewhat larger than the presence of large and academic libraries in the test site group.

Section 4, Survey Results 
SURVEY RESULTS 
The overall pilot project objectives served as the framework for analyzing EBB survey data. Those 
survey responses and the data collected by the EBB host computer (Appendixes A through E ) serve 
as the sources for the results presented in this section. Survey data were analyzed to describe the 
incorporation of the EBB into library operations and services, the patterns of EBB usage in libraries, 
and the acceptance and utility of the EBB in libraries. 
Charts and tables presented in this section are based on the responses of those who answered the 
survey questions. For all results, the information provided describes the cumulative experience and 
views of the libraries and users who participated in the pilot project. However, the results cannot be 
considered statistically representative of all depository libraries or EBB users. 
Also, the libraries 
used both estimation and tracking techniques to derive the project activity and cost data provided on 
the Library Survey. 
In instances where analysis of the data source question associated with a 
particular survey question indicates a notable difference between data that were estimated rather than
actually tracked during the project, the difference is reported. Cost data are not included in this
section but reported in Section 5 of this report. This Cost Analysis section covers the costs to the
Government and to libraries for making the EBB available to the test site libraries during the pilot
project period. 
Incorporation of EBB in Libraries 
Using outside computer data bases is a common practice for depository libraries. 
Of the 1,121 
libraries responding to the Test Site Selection Survey 88% indicated that they were accessing outside 
computer data bases in order to provide reference services to patrons [A5]. For the 101 EBB test site 
libraries, 87% indicated on the Test Site Selection Survey they were already accessing one or more 
online services [C6]. Ninety-three percent indicated that they either had the necessary equipment or
would acquire it to participate in the project; the remaining 7% said that they had the necessary 
equipment, but would acquire additional equipment if they were selected as a pilot project test site. 
Fully 94% of the online User Survey respondents who gave an opinion on the availability of library 
work stations/equipment, indicated that the equipment was "always available" or "generally 
available" to them for accessing the EBB [B7]. 
Four-fifths (80) of the selected sites submitted plans describing how they would implement EBB
service, and 56% of these libraries said they intended to permit only library staff to directly access
the EBB. 
The other libraries indicated that they would also have some form of supervised or 
controlled patron access.

EBB Installation and Set-up in Libraries 
The mean time expended for installing or setting up the hardware and/or software to access the EBB 
was four hours for the 87 test site libraries that reported this data. The reported library staff time 
used in setting-up for EBB ranged from negligible (i.e., several libraries reported no expenditure of 
time on this activity) to a high of 32 hours. Some libraries explained that set-up time included such 
things as learning to use the communications software and/or having a telephone connection installed 
for the modem. Although smaller libraries spent more time setting-up than did either the medium or 
the large libraries, the most notable difference in set-up time was between Selective and Regional 
depositories. Selective libraries averaged four hours of staff time in setting up for EBB, which was 
double that of the 2-hour average for reporting Regionals. Table 4-3 shows the average staff hours 
spent per library in setting-up the EBB.

Promoting Use of EBB in Libraries 
EBB Test Site Libraries were asked to undertake special efforts for ensuring that prospective users 
were made aware of the EBB's availability during the pilot project period. Promotion of the EBB by 
librarians was especially important because of the relatively brief duration of the pilot project. The 
selection of appropriate activities for promoting the EBB was left to the discretion of the individual 
libraries. 
In their EBB Implementation Plans, 78 test site libraries described the methods they
intended to employ for promoting use of the EBB.

Section 4, Survey Results 
Accessing the Economic Bulletin Board 
Training and Assistance to Library Staff and Users 
Test site libraries were asked to report the number of library staff that received training in how to use 
the EBB, how many staff hours were spent in EBB training, and how many staff hours were spent in 
training non-staff on using the EBB. For the 90 libraries that provided information on these items, 
the average number of EBB-trained staff was 4.6. 
The average number of staff hours spent in 
training was 8.2 hours. 
However, a check of the associated data source question for this item 
indicated a notable difference in the average depending on whether the library reported the figure as 
being an actual or an estimated value. For the 24 libraries that reported an actual number of training 
hours, the average number of staff hours spent in training was 4.8. For the libraries that gave an 
estimated figure, the average number of training hours was 9.1 [C3]. 
Staff hours spent by test site libraries training non-staff to use the EBB averaged 5.3 hours. 
However, this average is somewhat moderated by the number of libraries that reported no non-staff 
training activity. Thirty-eight percent of the libraries reported no expenditure of staff hours training 
non-staff. When the analysis is restricted to the 56 libraries that did report some expenditure of staff 
time, the average increases to 8.5 hours [C4]. Within their respective categories, large libraries and 
public libraries on average reported training the most staff and spending the most hours on training of 
staff and non-staff. For example, large libraries trained almost twice as many staff (5.9) as small 
libraries (3) [C2], Overall, libraries spent an average of 17.3 staff hours in set-up and training time 
for the EBB.

Section 4, Survey Results 
Accessing the Economic Bulletin Board 
EBB Usage 
During the seven-month trial period, the EBB was accessed by 93 of the 101 test site libraries for an 
overall total of 3,247 online sessions. For the test site libraries that explained their non-use of the 
EBB, their reasons had to do with equipment failure or unavailability, the library's inability to access 
the EBB system, a library staffing change or relocation, or the simple lack of user demand for EBB 
information. Because 17% of the libraries accounted for slightly over half of all the sessions, the 
average number of sessions per library tends to be pulled higher by a few libraries with heavy use of 
the EBB. 
Therefore, median levels of usage are reported in Table 4-5 to present a more 
representative picture of library use of the EBB.

The general pattern of EBB usage over the course of the pilot project period shows heavy activity
(663 sessions) during July (after the "practice" month of June), before leveling-off to just under 500 
sessions for each of the next three months, and then dropping to a low of 258 online sessions in 
December [E].

Section 4, Survey Results 
Accessibility of the EBB 
Users answering the online survey were asked how often they received no response or a busy signal when
attempting to access the EBB. Two-thirds of the respondents who expressed an opinion indicated that they 
"never or almost never" had trouble getting through on the phone. Another 30% said they "sometimes" had 
trouble. Less than 2% of the respondents indicated having trouble getting through more than half the time
they tried [B65-70]. When asked about the ease or difficulty of accessing the EBB on average, 90% of the
users who expressed an opinion judged it to be either "very easy" or "somewhat easy" to do so [B31-35]. In 
general, the survey results indicate that neither an unavailability of equipment nor an inability to access the 
EBB system itself, posed any significant barrier to EBB access for most of the online User Survey
respondents. 
Files Accessed 
Both the Online User Survey and the Library Survey asked respondents to identify EBB files accessed. The 
responses to these items on both surveys were merged to create a master list of all files mentioned as being 
accessed during the pilot project. This master list identified 120 of the more than 400 files available on the
EBB. For just the Online Survey, 84 of these 120 files were identified one or more times by library staff and 
patrons as the files they planned to access during a session. Table 4-6 shows the frequency with which these 
files were mentioned. The Summary of Consumer Price Index was most frequently mentioned. The frequency
with which a file was identified on the Online Survey provides a rough indication of the relative popularity of 
various EBB files. It does not, however, constitute an accurate count of file accessions since respondents 
were not required to answer the survey in order to access the EBB nor were all EBB users presented with the
survey over the course of the pilot project. Hence, these data are not a complete count of file usage. As the 
master list compilation shows, 36 files were identified from Library Survey responses but not Online Survey 
responses.

Purposes for Using the EBB 
Slightly more than half of the online User Survey respondents who were library staff indicated they 
were searching the EBB in response to requests from end users. Another 25% indicated they were 
obtaining the information for library use while an additional 14% said they were accessing the EBB 
to do both [B5-8]. Library patrons directly accessing the EBB were asked to indicate if they were 
obtaining information for themselves, someone else, or both. Chart 4-4 presents the responses of 
both groups.

Section 4, Survey Results 
On the Library Survey, respondents were asked to describe how the EBB was used in the library during the 
pilot project period. Over half of the respondents (56%) mentioned using the EBB for providing reference 
services and one-third said they used EBB to download updates of frequently requested statistics [CIO],

Library patrons were asked to identify how they used the EBB information. Only 4% of 118 offline User 
Survey respondents stated that they were seeking EBB information for personal use. In most cases they were 
searching the EBB for academic or for job/business purposes [D2].

In the online Users Survey, library patrons who directly accessed EBB were also asked how often 
they accessed EBB information for the same three specified purposes [B71-85]. 
Both surveys 
indicated a strong relationship between type of library and a patron's reason for using the EBB. A 
majority of respondents in academic libraries identified academic work as their purpose, while a 
majority of respondents in public libraries cited a job/business purpose.

In the online User Survey the users were asked how often they got the information they were looking for 
when they accessed the EBB. Of the 61 users who expressed an opinion, 79% got the needed information
from EBB at least "often" [B126-132].

Likewise, the majority of respondents to the offline User Survey provided a positive response when 
queried as to whether obtaining information through the EBB made their work harder or easier. 
Chart 4-10 
Did EBB Information Make Your Work Harder or Easier? 
Source: D1. 
Advantages of EBB for Information Access 
Both the offline and the online User Surveys featured questions about the advantages offered by the 
EBB as compared with the information resources that were already available in the library. Three 
kinds of advantages were surveyed: access to new information, access to more up-to-date infor-
mation, and access to information in a more useful (e.g., computer-readable) format. 
This comparative assessment of the EBB's advantages presented in Table 4-7 and Chart 4-8 is based 
on the responses of those users who expressed an opinion on the matter. 
Excluded from this 
assessment are those survey respondents who answered "don't know/no basis to judge" or "not sure" 
to the survey questions that dealt with the information access advantages of the EBB. 
A decided majority of respondents to both the offline and the online User Surveys indicated that the 
EBB provided information that is more up-to-date than what was available in the library before [B92­
97,D4]. Survey results were more divided, however, over the questions as to whether EBB offered a 
more useful format and whether EBB provided new information [B98-108; D5,6].

The Library Survey sought to elicit examples of EBB information that was either more up-to-date 
than library information or not in the library at all. When asked to identify specific EBB information 
that was more up-to-date than library information, 75 libraries provided 166 responses, which 
denoted 28 distinct files or publications. By far the most frequently mentioned example was the 
Consumer Price Index, which was cited by 56 libraries [Cl2].

EBB Access as a Substitute for Certain Depository Documents 
Online User Survey respondents were asked how much of the information provided by the EBB
overlaps with other Government documents they obtained through the library. On a scale ranging
from ’little, if any" to "all, or almost all", a majority of the 58 online User Survey respondents
believed that "some" EBB information overlapped with other Government documents [B86-91]. 
Chart 4-12

Source: B86-91. Based on 58 users responding. 
Online User Survey respondents were also asked whether access to EBB, if it were instituted on a
permanent basis, could be an acceptable substitute for some other Government documents obtained
through the library. 
Of the respondents who expressed an opinion, almost two-thirds (64%)
answered either "definitely yes" or "probably yes" [B121-125].

On a more specific question in the Library Survey, respondents were asked to identify any Government 
depository documents that contain essentially the same information as that provided by the EBB. In addition, 
respondents were asked to indicate whether the EBB would be an acceptable substitute for the documents they 
identified. Of the 54 document titles that were identified, the most frequently mentioned were the Consumer 
Price Index, Producer Price Index, Survey of Current Business, and Economic Indicators. [Cl 1]. As Table 4­
10 shows, when this question focuses on specific documents, the majority of respondents mentioning each 
document did not consider the EBB an acceptable substitute.

Section 5, Cost Analysis 
Accessing the Economic Bulletin Board 
Cost Analysis 
The figures presented in this section are the costs that were borne by the Government and by 
depository libraries in providing free public access to the EBB during the pilot project period. 
The library test site expenses are based on costs that were either monitored or estimated by the 
library. 
Costs to the Government 
Direct costs to the Government were limited to a single $15,000 transfer payment from GPO 
to the Department of Commerce to defray the costs incurred in providing libraries with online 
access and in performing the following pilot project support tasks: 
• 
preparing a project implementation plan showing resource requirements and project 
milestones; 
• 
performing the systems analysis and programming necessary to provide libraries with 
online access; 
• 
providing EBB documentation and telephonic support to facilitate library access; 
• 
recording and reporting statistical data on EBB usage by libraries; and 
• 
participating in the project evaluation. 
The actual dollar amount of EBB computer connect time used by the pilot project test site 
libraries was $8,813. 
Costs to Depository Libraries 
Depository libraries were asked to report EBB-related costs in three areas: 
• 
Equipment\Service Expenses 
• 
Staff Costs 
• 
Telecommunications Charges

Section 5, Cost Analysis 
Equipment\Service Expenses 
EBB equipment and service expenses were incurred in installing, promoting, and supporting
the EBB. Table 4-1 in Section 4 identifies the EBB-related items and activities that were 
purchased with these expenditures. 
For most libraries these costs were negligible or non-
existent. 
Of the 77 libraries that responded to the Library Survey's question about
equipment/service expenditures, 67% reported no expenditures in this cost category. 
The 
remaining libraries reported expenditures ranging from a high of $2,200 for one particular
computer purchase, to a low of $5 in several libraries [C5]. Table 5-1 shows the average
equipment/service cost per library by library type and size. When the analysis is restricted to
those libraries that incurred some expense, the average cost per library was $364.

Staff Costs 
In addition to equipment/service costs, libraries incurred labor costs in providing the EBB
service. Libraries were asked to report staff costs associated with the (1) staff hours spent
setting up the EBB and (2) training staff members and others to use the EBB. Table 5-2 shows
the average staff cost per library for these activities. For libraries responding to the items
about staff costs in setting up the EBB and staff training, over 90% reported some costs. Staff 
costs reported for setting up the EBB ranged from $0 to a high of $500. The costs for training 
staff members ranged from $0 to $864. 
With respect to staff costs for training non-staff, those costs ranged from $0 to $1,500. 
However, 38% of the reporting libraries indicated zero staff costs for training non-staff. If the
analysis of this staff cost is restricted to only those libraries that reported some expenditure in 
this category, the average cost is $162 rather than the $101 reported in Table 5-2.

Telecommunications Charges 
Under the cost-sharing provision of the EBB pilot project, participating libraries agreed to pay 
their own telecommunications charges for accessing the EBB. The libraries were asked to 
maintain a record of their monthly EBB telecommunications charges during the pilot project 
period and report these costs in the Library Survey. 
For the 69 libraries reporting EBB 
telecommunications charges, the average cost per library for the 7-month pilot project period 
was $89 [C8]. Telecommunications costs ranged from a high of $479 down to $0 for the two 
libraries within the EBB's local calling area. The average telecommunications cost per session 
per library was $2.90.

Section 5, Cost Analysis 
The geographical distribution of telecommunications costs was also examined using the time 
zone in which the library was located as an approximate indicator of distance from the EBB's
location in Washington, D.C. With one exception, the pattern of average cost per session 
shows a gradual increase from the eastern time zone ($2.61) across the central zone ($3.50), to 
the Pacific zone ($3.61). However, the cost for the mountain time zone libraries was quite 
low ($1.67)[C8]. This anomaly could be due to the fact that the mountain time zone had the 
fewest number of libraries reporting telecommunication cost data-6 libraries-and 5 of those 
libraries calculated their costs by applying an average charge to estimated usage times. 
In addition to reporting their EBB telecommunications costs, test site libraries were asked to 
report the costs of all other online services and, if possible, break out these costs between 
connect charges and telecommunications charges. 
For the 31 libraries that were able to
provide 
this breakout 
of their online expenses, 
the 
libraries' 
average 
monthly 
telecommunications cost was calculated 
as a proportion 
of its average 
monthly 
telecommunication charges. The median EBB average monthly cost amounted to 7% of the
average monthly telecommunication cost for these 31 sites. 
Library Cost Summary 
All equipment/service, staff, and telecommunications costs reported by each test site library 
were summed and used to compute an average total cost per library. Table 5-4 presents these 
figures. As indicated in Tables 5-1, 5-2, and 5-3, staff costs accounted for the largest portion 
of this total followed by equipment/service costs and then telecommunication costs.

Section 5, Cost Analysis 
Accessing the Economic Bulletin Board 
Cost as a Factor in EBB Use 
Because the test site libraries were responsible for their own telecommunications expenses, the Online 
User Survey included a question designed to assess whether cost considerations might have restricted 
library use of the EBB. 
More than two-thirds (69%) of the respondents who offered an opinion, 
believed that budget/cost limitations restricted their use of the EBB to "little or no extent" [B109-114]. 
Chart 5-1 
Extent to Which Costs Restricted EBB Use 
Source: B109-1 14. Based on 68 users responding. 
Other survey data also suggest that project costs did not significantly influence EBB use during the 
study. The provision of a toll-free phone number was not among the top five suggestions provided on 
the Library Survey for improving the EBB (See Section 4, Chart 4-11). Additionally, in the Test Site 
Selection Survey, libraries were asked this hypothetical question: If the online access charges were not 
fully subsidized by GPO, what would be the maximum hourly access charge that your library would be 
willing to pay for the EBB? Of the 98 test site libraries that responded to this item 12% stated that 
they would not be willing to pay any online access charge for EBB. Almost two-thirds (65%) would 
agree to pay between $1.00 and $10.99 per hour, and the remaining 20% would pay more [A9J.

TO MEMBERS OF THE INFORMATION COMMUNITY 
On April 9, 1987, the Joint Committee on Printing passed 
a resolution urging the Government Printing Office to 
initiate a series of pilot projects to test the feasibility 
and practicality of disseminating government publications to 
Depository Libraries in;
electronic formats. 
As a result of 
that resolution the Government Printing Office, in 
consultation with the Joint Committee on Printing, has 
developed the enclosed plan. 
i 
At its meeting on June 29, 1988, the Joint Committee on 
Printing, agreed that, prior to implementation, this plan 
should be circulated for public comment. 
If you have 
specific comments to make regarding these test projects, 
please submit them to the Joint Committee on Printing by 
August 22, 1988. 
Sincerely,

INTRODUCTION 
In 1983, 
the Joint Committee on Printing established the Ad Hoc 
Committee on Depository Library Access to Federal Automated Data 
Hoc Committee submitted reports in December 1984 
Bases. 
The Ad 
of 
and January 
1987 
strongly 
recommending 
implementation 
demonstration projects within the depository library community as 
a means of accurately assessing both effectiveness and economic 
feas.ibility.1,2/ 
The Ad Hoc Committee also recommended that the 
Joint Committee on Printing submit a request for funding for the 
projects 
and 
that GPO 
be 
responsible 
for the 
"planning, 
administration and implementation of the projects...."3/ 
At the 
direction of the Joint Committee 
on Printing, GPO requested 
$800,000 for fiscal year 1988 for electronic dissemination pilot 
projects, however, these funds were not allowed by Congress. 
On April 
9, 
1987, 
the Joint Committee accepted the Ad Hoc 
Committee’s reports and passed a resolution calling for "a series 
of pilot projects [to] be implemented to test the feasibility and 
publications to 
practicality 
of 
disseminating 
government 
depository libraries in electronic formats."4/

BACKGROUND 
Responsibility of the Government Printing Office 
As authorized under Title 
44 of the U.S. 
Code, the Government 
Printing Office (GPO) serves as the Federal Government’s printer 
and primary distributor of Government publications. 
For purposes 
of distribution to the Depository Library Program, Government 
publications 
are defined as 
"informational matter which 
is 
published as an individual document at Government expense, 
or as 
required by law.5/ 
The Depository Library Program guarantees 
public accessibility to Federal information at no cost to the 
user. 
Government publications are provided to depository libraries in 
the most usable, cost effective format. 
Over the past ten years, 
Congress has authorized GPO to distribute an increasing number of 
suitable publications in microfiche 
format, in order to contain 
costs 
for 
the 
Depository 
Library 
Program. 
The House 
Appropriations Committee recently indicated its support for cost 
effective methods of electronic dissemination to depository

Depository Libraries 
The Superintendent of Documents is required to make available to
participating libraries 
"government publications, 
except those
determined by their issuing components to be...for official use 
only or for strictly administrative or operational purposes which
have no public 
interest or educational value and publications 
classified for reasons of national security."7/ 
There are nearly 1,400 depository libraries throughout the United
States. 
There 
is at least one depository library in every 
Congressional district. 
Fifty-three 
libraries have agreed to
serve as regionals to maintain complete collections, allowing the 
other libraries to select publications according to the needs of
their users. 
The selectives can borrow publications from the
regionals. 
The Patent and Trademark Office plans to provide each of its 63
libraries, many of which are also depository libraries, with a
microcomputer, CD-ROM drive, and a printer. 
This will not only 
increase the number of libraries with such devices, but also
gives further 
indication of the growing acceptance of this 
technology. 
Distribution of Government Information to Libraries 
During FY 
1987, 
22.7 million copies of 58,143 titles were
distributed to depository libraries. 
Of the total number of 
copies, 9.6 million (42%) were in paper while 13.1 million (58%)
were in microfiche. 
The average number of libraries receiving 
any one item 
is 415. 
Where a publication 
is produced in
microfiche and paper formats, 
regionals receive copies of both
versions. 
III. 
DEPOSITORY LIBRARY PROGRAM DEMONSTRATION PROJECTS 
Over the past eight years, the library community has strongly 
supported access to Government information in electronic format.
All of the major 
library associations have testified to the
Appropriations Committees in support of depository library access 
to Government 
publications in electronic format. 
The Depository
Library Council 
to the Public Printer passed a supporting
resolution in 1980, and in 1987, 
established a subcommittee on 
electronic dissemination to act as a resource during the planning
and implementation of the plan.

More recently, 
the Association of Research Libraries (ARL) 
issued a report compiled by the Task Force on Government 
Information 
in Electronic Format, 
which supported the earlier 
findings of the Ad Hoc Committee. 
ARL believes that the 
Depository Library Program has 
reached a critical juncture 
a 
crossroads, if you will, 
to the future. 
ARL vigorously urges 
QPQf 
in cooperation with other Federal agencies, to institute 
immediate action thereby enabling depository libraries to begin 
receiving Government documents in electronic format.8/

IV. 
DESCRIPTION OF PROPOSED PROJECTS 
Overview 
This section of the plan describes possible projects to provide 
Government publications 
to depository libraries 
in electronic
format. 
These or similar projects would provide GPO and
depository libraries experience in dealing with these formats,
help clarify policy issues, and enable GPO to begin planning for 
the future. 
The criteria 
for selection of the 
projects 
include cost, 
willingness of the publishing agency to participate 
in the
planning of the project, value of the information to the public,
size of publication, 
frequency of update, search requirements, 
and the publishing schedule. 
The five projects include a mix of formats, approaches, and types
of data. 
Three 
of the projects involve CD-ROM (Compact Disc ­
Read Only Memory). 
Of the discs described herein, 
one will 
contain statistical data (Census); 
one will contain descriptive
data in a record 
format (EPA); and one will contain full text
(Congressional Record). 
Software development is an important consideration for the
increasing number of Federal agencies publishing CD-ROM products.
Agencies may develop retrieval 
software for CD-ROM in-house, as
Census has done, or contract for those services either on their 
own or through GPO. 
GPO has expanded its procurement services to
include CD-ROM products and will be able to "ride” issuing
agencies requisitions 
to obtain copies for depository libraries
and for sales. 
If agencies contract for CD-ROM development, they
(or GPO, 
on behalf of the depository libraries) may have to pay
for software licenses for each of the CD-ROM copies that are
distributed. 
Another possibility is for the government to
negotiate for unlimited use of software for a set fee. 
Two of the projects would provide on-line access to Government
data bases. 
There can be no doubt that online information
dissemination 
is technically possible; 
many libraries have 
offered database 
searching as a service to their patrons for 
years. 
In many cases, 
online data base searching offers
significant advantages over using a printed counterpart (e.g., it 
may be more up-to-date, easier to search, and may save staff time
previously spent cataloging and handling little-used materials).
However, online information distribution may be more costly than
paper distribution. 
Some libraries pass the cost of the more 
complicated and lengthy data base searches on to their patrons.
The Department of Energy (DOE) project 
is the most far-reaching 
in its implications. 
DOE proposes a phased effort to provide

PROJECT: Distribute a CD-ROM, software, and hard copy
documentation published by the Census Bureau. 
The CD-ROM
contains the 1982 Census of Retail Trade by Zip Code and the 1982 
Census of Agriculture. 
DESCRIPTION: 
As the nation’s statistician, the Census Bureau
collects 
and disseminates 
information about the population,
economy, industry, and other aspects of American life. 
This
information is used by all kinds of organizations, including 
Congress, 
Federal agencies, 
state 
and 
local governments,
businesses, educators, associations, students and many others. 
Despite 
the importance of Census data and the efforts of the
Census Bureau to disseminate 
it as widely as possible, much of 
the information 
is not readily available to the public. 
Because
of its sheer volume, 
much Census data is published in magnetic 
tape format only. 
Unfortunately, most libraries and certainly
most 
individuals do not have the computing 
facilities and
technical expertise to manipulate data in magnetic tape format. 
Therefore, this data is lost to large segments of the general 
public. 
Last year, Census became the first Federal agency to publish data
in CD-ROM format. 
Census’ initial test, which 
involved over 30 
libraries (most of which were depository libraries), as well as 
Census field offices and statisticians, was so successful that
Census decided to expand the use of CD-ROM in future publishing 
efforts. 
In March 1988, Census mastered a disc containing data from the
1982 Economic Census. 
Heretofore, this data was sold only on 
magnetic tape. 
This disc will be used to test whether parts of
the 1990 Decennial Census should be published on CD-ROM. 
Census
will provide basic search and retrieval software that they have 
developed. 
Data will be structured on the disc so that it can
also be manipulated easily by dBase 
III and other commercially 
available 
software, 
which 
is 
widely used by the Federal
government and other organizations. 
Census is in the process of
developing 
software 
to facilitate downloading data to provide
maximum flexibility to data users. 
The Census Bureau is a good choice for a partner in a CD-ROM
project because 
they already have expertise in this area, and
Census is likely to be major publisher of CD-ROM products 
in the
future. 
The Government could realize significant savings by 
distributing results of the 
1990 Decennial Census to depository
libraries in CD-ROM format instead of paper or microfiche. 
Another advantage is that Census, as the originating agency, will 
pay for developing retrieval 
software and documentation and for

the mastering of the disc; GPO will pay only for the copies for 
the depository libraries. 
Finally, this project will not entail the issue of software 
licensing. 
(Service bureaus which develop CD-ROM products under 
contract sometimes charge substantial fees per disc copy for use 
of their retrieval software.) 
The Census Bureau software is in 
the public domain. 
COST PROJECTION: 
The total cost for this project, including 
materials, postage, and labor, would be approximately $14,027 for 
1,400 libraries. 
Contractor costs for duplicating copies of CD-
ROMs and floppy disks are estimated at $2.75 and $5 respectively. 
The documentation 
(estimated at 100 pages) would cost about $51 
per 
100 copies.

PROJECT: Distribute the Toxic Release Inventory (TRI) to be 
Protection Agency 
(EPA) 
in 
published by 
the Environmental 
February 1989 to depository libraries in CD-ROM format. 
DESCRIPTION: 
The EPA was established in 1970 to safeguard 
the 
environment through development of effective Government standards 
and regulations, research, monitoring, and education. 
As part of 
the Superfund Amendments and Reauthorization Act of 1986 (SARA), 
Congress charged the EPA with collecting and making available to 
the public 
information about over 300 toxic chemicals that are 
being 
released 
to 
the 
environment. 
Certain chemical 
manufacturers, 
processors, 
and users are required to submit 
annually a toxic chemical release form to the EPA. 
The release 
forms provide 
information to the Federal, 
state, 
and local 
governments and the public. 
EPA is required to make this data 
accessible by computer telecommunications and other means. 
Between 160,000 and 300,000 release forms will be submitted to 
the EPA by July 1, 1988. 
Data collection will not be completed 
until about February 
1989. 
EPA proposes to publish a CD-ROM 
containing the TRI data base for distribution to their field 
offices, as well as depository libraries. 
CD-ROM format was selected for the TRI data base because of size, 
EPA would 
content, update 
frequency, and search requirements. 
contract for designing the layout of the CD-ROM and development 
Disc replication would be through a GPO 
of search software. 
contract. 
EPA also plans to publish the TRI in printed format. 
It would 
probably be distributed to depository libraries 
in microfiche 
format, at a cost of approximately $70,257. 
Distribution of this 
data to depository libraries in CD-ROM format instead would offer 
significant cost savings. 
COST PROJECTION: The total cost for this project, including 
materials, fees, 
postage, and labor is estimated at $22,319 for 
400 libraries. 
Most of this amount, 
$20,000, 
is to purchase 
software 
licenses to entitle disc users to use contractor-
developed software. 
(Some companies allow publishers to purchase 
rights to the software outright, but licensing seems to be more 
prevalent in the industry.) 
Costs for software 
licenses seem to 
vary a great deal depending on the company, product, and the 
number of disc copies produced. 
The figure used here 
($50 per 
disc copy) 
seems to be a reasonable amount based on a recent 
survey of CD-ROM producers. 
The software license 
fee would 
include the cost of the floppy disk and documentation to support 
the software.

PROJECT: 
Distribute 
the 
final 
(bound) 
edition of the 
Congressional Record published by the U.S. Congress to depository 
libraries in CD-ROM format. 
DESCRIPTION: 
The Congressional Record is published in two 
editions: 1) a daily edition is produced when Congress 
is in 
session; and 2) a cumulated final edition is prepared after the 
conclusion of each session of Congress. 
Indexes to the daily Record are published on a biweekly basis. 
Indexes to the final editions of the Record are created by 
cumulating the biweekly indexes for each session of Congress. 
The cumulated indexes are edited to reflect the page numbers that 
appear in the final Record. 
Currently, 
the Congressional Record is published 
in three 
formats: 1) paper (daily on newsprint, cumulated final on 40 lb 
offset); 2) microfiche (daily and final on 24X diazo fiche); and 
3) electronic 
(standard 1600 BPI, ASCII, IBM compatible, 9 track 
magnetic tape). 
While the magnetic tape format has never been offered through the 
Depository Library Program, until 1986 the bound Record was made 
available to libraries 
on dual 
format 
distribution 
(i.e., 
selective depositories could choose either paper or microfiche; 
regional depositories received both paper and microfiche). 
In 
early 
1986, 
depository distribution of the bound Record was 
changed from dual format to microfiche-only, 
as a cost-savings 
response to budget cuts mandated by Gramm-Rudman-Hollings. 
Recent advances 
in the use of CD-ROM technology seem to indicate 
that this format may be an appropriate alternative to microfiche 
distribution. 
Not only does-
CD-ROM provide much greater 
research capabilities to the user, it also appears 
that it will 
be less costly than microfiche. 
The following analysis presents 
the projected costs and considerations of employing CD-ROM as an 
alternative to microfiche 
for depository distribution of the 
Congressional Record. 
Considerations in Publishing the final Record on CD-ROM 
1
. Size of data base 
A year of the Congressional Record is made up of approximately 
413 million keystrokes, which translates to about 500 megabytes 
of information. 
In addition, the index and bill digest 
for a 
year’s 
Record 
will 
comprise 
approximately 22 additional 
megabytes. 
A single, 4-3/4 inch CD will hold up to 660 megabytes 
of data.

The amount of data a disc can handle depends upon the type and
size of the retrieval software. 
An initial decision must be 
made as to what type of software will be used, so the data can be 
properly structured. 
A year’s Record on CD-ROM would be such a
large data base that the response time in searching full-text on
a personal computer could be quite long. 
Therefore, it may be 
more practical 
to include the index along with the text and have
full-text searching of the index only, 
with the ability to
directly locate 
in the Record, the specific index reference. 
It
also might be possible to search on the headers in the full text. 
2. Software 
The users of data on compact discs will want to search, 
retrieve, and download the data onto another disk, 
or another 
computer. 
They also will want the capability to print a page or
a smaller section of the data onto paper. 
The type of retrieval 
and on-demand printing software must be carefully chosen, in 
order to accommodate the variety of equipment that will be used
to access the data. 
3. Planning 
A working group of technicians (GPO and JCP) 
and Record users 
(LC, House and Senate Library .staff) 
should be established to 
plan the most effective way to publish the Record on CD. 
4. Cost Projection 
The basic 
publishing costs would include data preparation 
(converting the electronic data into a format suitable for 
CD-ROM), 
acquisition of retrieval 
software, creation of tapes
containing text and index data, 
and procurement of the CD-ROM 
master disc. 
(GPO is in the process of leasing a CD-ROM 
publishing system for testing software and producing tapes for
mastering discs.) 
The master disc and duplicate CD-ROMs would be 
procured from a private sector vendor. 
The annual cost to the Depository Program if 1,295 depository 
libraries (plus 10 additional copies to replace those that may be
lost or damaged) received the bound Record in CD-ROM format would
be: 9/

It should be noted that statistics compiled by the GAO for the 
recent OTA study on information technology indicate that over 40% 
of depository libraries already have CD-ROM readers. 
Given the
development of commercial products now being offered on CD-ROM, 
it is safe to assume that in a relatively short period of time, a 
substantially greater number of depositories will obtain such 
devices. 
The OTA study indicates that such devices can be 
obtained for approximately $845, 
which would appear to be well 
within the reach of almost any library within a relatively short 
period of time.

Appendix F 
Accessing the Economic Bulletin Board 
AN-v9-nl3-7/88 
PROJECT: 
Provide online access to the Economic Bulletin Board 
sponsored by the Department of Commerce. 
DESCRIPTION: The Department of Commerce offers a wide variety of 
programs aimed at monitoring 
the nation’s economy and promoting 
economic growth through international trade, free enterprise, and 
technological advancement. 
One facet of the Department’s job is 
to collect, analyze, and disseminate statistics 
representing the 
state of the nation’s economy. 
This information is provided to 
business and Government planners to enable them to respond to 
national economic conditions. 
One of the primary ways utilized by the Commerce Department and 
other Federal agencies to distribute 
economic news is through 
press releases. 
Such press releases sometimes contain important 
Government information, for example, the Consumer Price Index and 
national unemployment statistics. 
Even though press releases are 
clearly within the scope of the Depository Library Program as 
defined by Title 44 USC, it is often difficult to obtain copies 
for depository distribution. 
Agencies frequently reproduce press 
releases 
in 
limited quantities 
for immediate distribution. 
Attempts to acquire copies 
later are costly and very often 
futile. 
Even when copies can eventually be obtained, they are of 
less value to depository libraries because the news is no longer 
timely. 
Another medium used to disseminate economic information is an 
electronic bulletin board sponsored 
by the 
Department of 
Commerce. 
The Economic Bulletin Board contains economic news and 
statistics published by several bureaus within the Department of 
Commerce, 
including the Bureau of Economic Analysis, Census 
Bureau, International Trade Administration, and NTIS, 
as well as 
the Federal Reserve Board, 
Bureau of Labor Statistics (Labor 
Department), 
and 
the 
Internal 
Revenue 
Service 
(Treasury 
Department). 
The 
information 
is contained in about 300 files 
which are updated within a few minutes of their release time. 
Updates are monthly or quarterly, 
depending on the release; 
employment statistics, for example, 
are updated monthly. 
There 
are currently 
about 900 
subscribers, 
including about 
100 
libraries. 
The only equipment required 
is a 
’
dumb” terminal, 
however, most subscribers use personal computers to download data 
to floppy disk for subsequent review and manipulation. 
The 
current equipment configuration at the Commerce Department will 
accommodate up to 16 simultaneous users, using 2400, 1200, or 300 
baud communication. 
The Commerce Department has indicated their willingness to extend 
access to selected depository libraries. 
Officials there have 
proposed that 
100 libraries be given the opportunity to use the 
Economic Bulletin Board for a period of six months.

Appendix F 
AN-v9-nl3-7/88 
At the end of that period, the project could be evaluated and a
decision made whether or not to continue the project and expand 
access to additional libraries. 
COST PROJECTION: Commerce Department normally charges users $25 
per year plus $6 per hour (daytime) to $3 per hour (evenings) for 
access to the Economic Bulletin Board. 
Rather than adhering to
Commerce Department’s regular fee structure, GPO would pay $5,000
for unlimited use by participating libraries for a period of six 
months. 
Commerce Department’s 
costs for conducting this 
demonstration would be reduced somewhat since they would not have 
to register individual libraries or send bills for system use. 
(This arrangement would enable Commerce Department to upgrade 
their existing equipment to accommodate the additional users.)
Telecommunication costs could be borne by the Federal Government 
or 
participating 
depository 
libraries. 
The 
estimated 
telecommunication costs ($16,800) are based on a total of 2,400 
hours of connect time billed at $7/hour. 
The actual expense 
would depend on the amount of online use and the hourly rate for 
service, which varies significantly between carriers.

(NOTE: Much of the information contained on the Economic 
Bulletin Board is not currently being distributed to 
depository libraries. 
Also, 
it contains data supplied by a 
wide range of Federal agencies, as described in the 
project description. 
For these reasons, reliable cost 
figures for hard copy distribution were not available.) 
According to records of system usage compiled by the 
Department of Commerce, one Federal depository library 
used the Economic Bulletin Board (EBB) 45 times to download 
261 files during the first three months of 1988. The cost 
for 100 libraries to use the EBB to this extent for six 
months 
(a 
total of 2,400 hours) 
at regular Commerce 
Department rates would be about $15,000.

Accessing the Economic Bulletin Board 
Appendix F 
AN-v9-nl3-7/88 
PROJECT: Phase I - (1) Develop a ’
gateway" to provide 18-22 
depository libraries 
online access 
to bibliographic files 
residing on the Department of Energy 
(DOE) 
computer and/or 
commercial 
systems; 
and 
(2) perform a study to determine the 
optimum media 
(e.g., microfiche, 
CD-ROM, etc.) 
for delivery of 
DOE contractor 
reports to depository libraries. 
Phase II-
Depending on the results of Phase I, select and test a system for 
electronic delivery of full-text DOE reports. 
DESCRIPTION: In FY 1987, about 14,000 Department of Energy
(DOE) 
technical 
reports were distributed in microfiche format 
through the Depository Library Program. 
Under an interagency 
agreement between GPO and DOE, 
the reports are mailed to 
depository libraries from the DOE facility located in Oak Ridge,
Tennessee. 
DOE pays for producing the microfiche (an estimated 
$350,000/year)
; GPO reimburses DOE for postage and handling costs 
(about $175,000/year)
. 
An index to the technical report 
citations published by DOE, 
Energy Research Abstracts (ERA), is 
distributed to depository libraries. 
DOE officials have proposed that selected depository libraries be 
provided online access 
to 
the 
DOE 
Integrated Technical 
Information System 
(ITIS). 
This would provide libraries more 
current access to the information received on fiche, greater 
search capabilities 
than possible 
through ERA, 
access to 
authority and other files 
internal to Office of Scientific and 
Technical 
Information 
(OSTI), 
and the ability to create 
electronic cataloging 
information 
(in 
LC/Machine Readable 
Cataloging format) for those documents the library receives. 
Programming 
to 
provide 
online 
access to ITIS would be 
accomplished under the supervision of the DOE (OSTI). 
It would 
be carried out 
in two steps. 
The first task would require 
enhancing ITIS to allow depository libraries to search authority
file information and bibliographic records created by DOE during
the past year. 
Secondly, 
a 
’
gateway" would be developed to 
enable users 
to automatically switch to a commercial system to 
search older Energy data base materials. 
Depository libraries 
could use existing programs to convert DOE bibliographic records 
into MARC format, 
which 
is the standard format used by the 
library community. 
During the second part of Phase I, a study would be conducted to 
determine the optimum media 
(microfiche, 
CD-ROM, 
floppy disks)
for distribution of the aforementioned DOE contractor reports to 
depository libraries. 
Alternatives would be evaluated on such 
factors as cost, usability, practicality, and timeliness. 
This project would provide significant benefits for depository
libraries. 
The libraries would have: (1) more current access to 
indexing (months before the paper ERA is distributed to

depository libraries); (2) increased search capabilities (i.e., 
more access points); (3) retrieval capability for related 
information; 
(4) 
electronic cataloging 
information that is 
currently not 
available. 
(GPO 
is 
not 
cataloging these 
publications in the LC/GPO cataloging format and this material is 
not 
part 
of 
the 
Monthly 
Catalog 
of 
U.S. 
Government 
Publications.) 
The development and application of this system 
could allow realization of significant cost savings at each 
depository library. 
COST PROJECTION: DOE officials have proposed that GPO 
reimburse DOE for development costs as well as use of the DOE 
computer by depository libraries for the duration of the project. 
One-time costs, 
in the amount of $100,000, would cover expenses 
for personnel and other resources needed to adapt the DOE 
computer system for use by depository libraries, develop the 
gateway for accessing commercial 
systems, 
and 
conduct the 
feasibility study for the 
format of DOE technical reports. 
The 
cost for searching files on the DOE computer would be $16 per 
hour. 
Based on 20 libraries searching the DOE computer for two 
hours a week, the annual recurring cost to GPO would be $33,280. 
This expense would be slightly offset by a savings of $2,155, if 
participating libraries no longer received printed copies of 
Energy Research Abstracts. 
Libraries 
that choose to utilize 
commercial systems to search 
for older DOE materials would pay 
for those services at the going commercial rate (currently $85­
$120/hour)
.

Accessing the Economic Bulletin Board 
United States Government Printing Office 
Washington, DC 20401 
Dear Depository Librarian: 
We are pleased to announce plans for implementation of a pilot 
project to offer online access to the Economic Bulletin Board 
(EBB) sponsored by the Department of Commerce. 
During the pilot 
project, the EBB will be available to 100 depository libraries 
for a period of six months. 
The purpose of this letter and accompanying materials is to 
provide you with detailed information about the Economic Bulletin 
Board, and to ascertain your interest in participating as a pilot 
project test site. 
This envelope contains a short, easy-to­
answer survey that we would like you to complete and return, 
regardless of your desire to actively participate in this 
project. 
Your response will help us fully consider the impact of 
electronic information dissemination on the entire depository 
library community. 
A copy of the enclosed information (except 
for the survey) has also been mailed to the director of your 
1ibrary. 
The Economic Bulletin Board is one of five pilot projects being 
conducted to test the feasibility of electronic dissemination of 
information to depository libraries. 
It is one of two online 
projects approved by the Joint Committee on Printing in May. 
Each of the pilot projects is structured differently, and each 
project will be evaluated carefully to understand more about 
electronic information delivery to depository libraries. 
To 
that end, we have asked the General Accounting Office (GAO) to 
assist GPO in conducting the pilot projects. 
GAO brings to the 
project their expertise in program development and evaluation. 
GAO staff have played an active part in designing the Economic 
Bulletin Board pilot project so that it can be evaluated fairly, 
and so that it will yield important information for future 
planning. 
GAO will also assist us in analyzing responses to the 
enclosed survey to select a sample of depository libraries that 
reflects the various types of libraries participating in the 
Depository Library Program.

Accessing the Economic Bulletin Board 
Appendix G 
Participation in the Economic Bulletin Board pilot project is 
voluntary, and consideration as a test site is open to all 
depository libraries. 
Depository libraries that are chosen as 
test sites will be asked to fulfill important responsibilities,
such as gathering information that will enable GAO to evaluate 
the pilot project. 
GPO will pay for access to the bulletin board 
itself; depository libraries must each pay their own 
telecommunications charges. 
Although costs will differ between 
libraries based on usage and other factors, a study of current 
subscribers to the EBB revealed that telephone charges are 
generally modest due to the nature of the system. 
The survey of depository libraries, provided as a separate 
enclosure, is very important. 
The questions are designed to take 
only a few minutes of your time to answer. 
Please help us by 
completing the survey whether or not you wish to be considered as 
a test site. The survey should be returned to the U.S. General 
Accounting Office, General Government Division, Mr. Thomas Beall, 
441 G Street, N.W. Room 3826, Washington, DC 
20548 within 10 
days of receipt. 
A postage-paid envelope has been provided for 
your convenience. 
If you have any questions about the materials contained in this 
package, please call Jan Erickson at (202) 275-1003. 
Thank you for your cooperation and support for this very

INFORMATION PACKET 
for the 
ECONOMIC BULLETIN BOARD PILOT PROJECT 
The Economic Bulletin Board (EBB) is one of five pilot projects 
being conducted to test the feasibility of electronic 
dissemination of information to depository libraries. 
The other 
pilot projects, which include three CD-ROM applications and one 
online system, are in varying stages of implementation. 
(For a 
complete description of all of the pilot projects, see 
Administrative Notes , v .9, #13.) 
The purpose of this package is to provide more detailed 
information about the Economic Bulletin Board pilot project, 
including information that will help you decide whether or not 
your library should be considered as a candidate for selection as 
a test site. 
It is comprised of five parts: 
* Section f provides a description of the Economic Bulletin 
Board and how it is used; 
* Section II outlines requirements for participating as a 
test site; 
* Section TIT describes the methodology that will be used 
for selection of test sites; 
* Section TV provides names and telephone numbers of 
Government officials that you may contact for additional 
information or assistance in completing the enclosed 
survey; 
* Appendix I is a list showing the type of files typically 
available on the Economic Bulletin Board. 
Although some of the information contained on the Economic 
Bulletin Board also appears in publications that are distributed 
to depository libraries, distribution of printed documents will 
not be affected during the pilot project. 
Data is available on 
the bulletin board much sooner than in printed documents; it is 
also significantly easier to manipulate or combine with other 
data, since it is already in machine-readable format.

Appendix G 
Subscriber fees and hourly connect charges for utilizing the EBB 
will be waived for participating depository libraries for the 
six-month period during which the pilot project is conducted.
Libraries that already subscribe to the EBB may apply for 
designation as test sites; however, annual subscription fees 
already paid to the Department of Commerce will not be refunded.
Depository libraries chosen as test sites, rather than GPO, will
be responsible for paying telecommunications costs for accessing
the bulletin board. 
The amount of the line charges will vary
between libraries, based on the amount of usage; time of day; 
distance from Washington, DC; and the telephone company or 
network serving your institution. 
Access to the EBB by depository library test sites may be 
discontinued at the end of the six-month pilot period. 
However, 
subscription costs to the EBB are low. 
The annual EBB 
subscription fee is currently $25.00, with daytime hourly
connect charges of $6.00 per hour and evening and weekend hourly
connect charges of $3.00 per hour. 
Test sites may wish to 
consider obtaining a subscription to the EBB at the end of the 
test period if the pilot project is not continued. 
Libraries not 
selected as test sites may also want to consider subscribing 
directly to the EBB. 
SECTION I
. THE ECONOMIC BULLETIN BOARD 
The Economic Bulletin Board was established in 1985 by the
Department of Commerce to provide timely access to statistics and 
other current economic news. 
It contains a variety of data 
published by Commerce Department offices and several other 
sources, including the International Trade Administration, Bureau 
of Economic Analysis, Census Bureau, the Bureau of Labor 
Statistics, Eedera1 Reserve Board, and the Treasury Department. 
Examples of information available through the Economic Bulletin 
Board include the Consumer Price Index (CPI), Gross National 
Product (GNP), employment statistics, and Daily Trade 
Opportunities for Exporters. 
There are currently about 2,300 
paid subscribers to the Economic Bulletin Board. 
The Economic Bulletin Board is available to dial-up users 24 
hours a day. 
It typically contains about 30 megabytes of data in 
over 400 tiles. 
Archival data is not retained on the bulletin
board. 
Rather, data files are replaced as soon as new 
information becomes available. 
Many widely-used statistics, such 
as the CPI, are loaded onto the bulletin board within 15 minutes 
of their official release. 
Two-thirds of the files on the 
bulletin board are updated on a quarterly or monthly basis.

Appendix G 
Accessing the Economic Bulletin Board 
Selected information, such as Trade Opportunities, may be updated 
daily. 
Many files on the Economic Bulletin Board are text files, 
and contain data exactly as it appeared in Commerce Department 
press releases. 
Other files are in Lotus 1-2-3 (or compatible) 
format to facilitate data manipulation by the end user. 
Appendix 
I contains a complete list of the files that were available on 
the Economic Bulletin Board in July 1989. 
Online bulletins, which contain general economic news, calenders 
of release dates for upcoming news, and points of contact in 
economic statistical agencies, are designed to be read while 
signed onto the EBB. 
The core of the EBB - representing over 95% 
of the data on the bulletin board - is comprised of files that 
are intended for downloading to a PC for later viewing or 
manipulation. 
Such files include the major economic press 
releases and specific economic information. 
Users equipped with 
dumb terminals can view or print out the files locally. 
In 
addition, the EBB provides programs for accomplishing 
“housekeeping chores," such as changing passwords and leaving 
messages for the system operator. 
The following examples illustrate the kinds of questions that can 
be answered using the Economic Bulletin Board: 
* What was the Consumer Price Index just released by 
the Commerce Department? 
* What are the latest figures available on single family 
home sales for the U.S.? 
* How can I find out the latest Producer Price Index issued 
by the Bureau of Labor Statistics? 
* Can you give me the personal income levels by county for 
this state? 
* I ’d like to look at the "trade opportunities" issued today 
to see what kinds of products or services my company might 
be able to sell to overseas markets. 
You do not need to be an advanced computer user to make effective 
use of the Economic Bulletin Board. 
Easy-to-use menus guide 
users through most of the steps needed to access the information. 
Online help is available for assistance in using specific 
commands. 
Documentation that clearly explains how to use the 
bulletin board will be distributed to depository libraries 
selected as test*-sites. 
Telephone support will also be available 
for libraries needing additional assistance.

Appendix G 
SECTION II. REQUIREMENTS FOR EBB TEST SITES 
The purpose of this pilot project is to learn more about the
benefits, costs, and other implications of depository library
access to online government data bases. 
In order to accomplish
this objective, full participation by depository libraries that
are designated as test sites is of paramount importance. 
Pilot project test sites will be issued an account number and 
password that will enable them to access the EBB. The depository
library will be responsible for protecting this information, and
ensuring that the bulletin board is being utilized properly under 
appropriate circumstances. While usage of the EBB is encouraged,
abuse of the system will not be tolerated. 
Depository libraries selected as test sites should make a special
effort to ensure that potential users of the Economic Bulletin
Board are aware of its availability. This is of particular
importance because of the short duration of the pilot project.
Activities for promoting the service, such as workshops, personal
contacts, newsletters, etc., will be left to the discretion of
librarians participating in the project. 
Experience in transferring data utilizing a modem may be
beneficial, but will not be necessary in order to participate in
the EBB pilot project. Using tools such as the documentation and
online help features, even novice users can expect to use the 
system successfully after a few practice sessions. 
Telephone
assistance will also be available, if necessary. 
Librarians that
will be using the system and/or assisting other users should plan 
to utilize the system sufficiently at the outset of the project
to become familiar with its operation. 
Depository libraries that are selected as test sites will be 
asked to submit a brief plan outlining 1
) how access to the EBB
would be provided by that institution, 2
) how they plan to inform
library users about the availability of the EBB, and 3
) the steps
they will take to train staff and/or library users about the EBB. 
Test sites will also be expected to collect certain data in
support of the evaluation of the pilot project. 
This will
require that staff time be devoted to data collection 
activities. 
Test sites will be asked to collect information on 
such things as: frequency and nature of EBB use, staff resources 
expended on implementing the EBB and servicing EBB requests,
telecommunications costs for accessing the bulletin board, and
user satisfaction with the EBB.

Appendix G 
Accessing the Economic Bulletin Board 
In some instances, test sites may need to develop procedures or 
methods for obtaining the necessary information. 
For example, 
test site libraries that do not monitor their own long distance 
telephone call charges will need to get this information in order 
to track the cost of calls to the EBB. 
For the most part, test 
sites will be expected to provide evaluation information by 
responding to surveys such as the one enclosed in this package 
or completing a brief questionnaire when they sign on to the EBB. 
Other methods, such as telephone interviews, may also be used. 
Test sites may be asked to intermittently maintain logs or other 
data collection forms for monitoring the use of the EBB and its 
associated costs and benefits. 
Data collection requirements 
will be designed with the objective of minimizing the workload 
placed on test sites, and depository librarians will be consulted 
to ensure that the collection procedures are not burdensome. 
No travel will be required for librarians participating in the 
proj ect. 
Depository libraries designated as test sites will be expected to 
provide equipment for accessing the bulletin board. 
The 
following equipment and software are required: 
Personal computer, word processor, or ‘
'dumb" terminal 
capable of asynchronous communications. 
Asynchronous communications software if you are using a 
personal computer or word processor (dumb terminals have 
communications circuitry). Most popular programs sold in 
the personal computer market will work. 
A modem which can communicate at 300, 1200, or 2400 baud. 
Most popular modems serving the personal computer market 
will work. 
A cable connecting the modem to the computer (internal 
modems inside the PC do not need a cable). 
Telephone line capable of transmitting and receiving 
data from EBB located in Washington, DC. (a telephone 
•line that connects to outside lines through an institution's 
central switchboard may not work). 
All depository libraries, regardless of their desire to apply for 
consideration as a pilot project test site, should complete the 
enclosed survey and return it to GAO within 10 days of receipt. 
(If the survey was inadvertently omitted or misplaced, call (202) 
275-1003 immediately to request another copy.)

The final question on the enclosed survey requires the signature
of the documents librarian (or other contact within the library)
and the library director, if the library is applying for
designation as a test site. 
By signing the survey, library
personnel agree to comply with the requirements for test 
libraries outlined,above. 
SECTION III. 
METHODOLOGY FOR SELECTION OF TEST SITES 
The site selection plan for the EBB pilot project has been
designed to support two complementary objectives. 
One objective
is to select sites that reflect the diverse types of libraries
that comprise the depository library community. 
The other
objective is to identify potential test sites that provide 
opportunities to assess electronic information dissemination
under special or innovative circumstances that would be useful as
case study evaluations. 
Test site allocation and selection of
participating libraries is divided into two parts in order to
realize these dual objectives. 
For the EBB pilot project, at least 86 of the 100 test site slots
will be apportioned on the basis of four dimensions to obtain an
appropriate mix of depository libraries. 
These dimensions are:
library size, library type, depository type (i.e., regional or
selective), and geographic location. 
The selection of libraries
to participate as test sites will based on the distribution of
the slots across these four dimensions. 
Selection on the library
type dimension, for example, has the following distribution: 50
percent of the test site slots will be allocated to academic
libraries, 20 percent to public libraries, and 30 percent to the
other types of libraries. 
It is anticipated that more libraries 
will apply for designation as test sites than there are slots
available. 
If this occurs, libraries seeking designation as a
test site will be randomly selected from the cross-classified
groupings of the four dimensions. 
Using the previous example as
a rudimentary illustration, if 200 academic libraries apply for 
consideration as test sites, 43 will be randomly selected from
the 200 since 50 percent of the 86 test sites are allocated to
academic libraries. 
The remaining 14 available test site slots are set aside for
possible discretionary assignment in support of the second site
selection objective. 
Libraries responding to item 11 of the enclosed survey will be 
considered for selection as one of the 14 possible discretionary
test sites.

All libraries indicating their desire to participate as a test 
site have an opportunity to be selected as one of the 86 randomly 
selected sites whether or not they answer item 11. 
Libraries 
chosen as one of the 14 discretionary sites will be expected to 
engage in additional evaluation activities relevant to the 
particular circumstances or plans that constitute the basis for 
their selection.

Executive Summary
EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
In response to the 1987 Joint Committee on Printing (JCP) resolution urging the United States 
Government Printing Office (GPO) to test the feasibility and practicality of disseminating govern-
ment publications to Depository Libraries in electronic formats, GPO and the Department of Energy 
(DOE) proposed and received approval for a Pilot Project to evaluate electronic dissemination of and 
access to DOE research results by Depository Libraries. The project consisted of two interrelated 
components: (1) evaluating online access to DOE services and databases by Depository Libraries and 
(2) a technology assessment of the feasibility of disseminating DOE research results in electronic 
format rather than on microfiche. GPO and DOE signed an Interagency Agreement in July 1990, and 
GPO allocated $133,000 for the project.
Because it is relatively inexpensive to produce and takes less storage space than paper, microfiche 
has long been the medium of choice for distributing full-text information to libraries. However, the 
need for quicker and more efficient access to information has prompted a reassessment of other media 
as potential alternatives to microfiche. DOE currently distributes microfiche of over 14,000 technical 
reports annually to Depository Libraries from its Office of Scientific and Technical Information 
(OSTI) in Oak Ridge, Tennessee. These documents, which are prepared by or for DOE, report the 
results from DOE-funded scientific and technical research projects.
OSTI also maintains the Energy Science and Technology Database, a multidisciplinary database 
containing references to information related to energy research and technology from worldwide 
sources. Abstracts of the documents distributed to the Depository Libraries are included in the 
database.
The complete Energy Science and Technology Database, available through DIALOG Information 
Services and STN International, contains approximately 2.5 million records dating from 1974 to the 
present. The Integrated Technical Information System (ITIS) maintained by OSTI for DOE and its 
contractors provides access to the current 14 months of Energy Science and Technology__over
200,000 records, with approximately 750 new records added nightly. (The database is updated semi-
monthly on the commercial systems.) Prior to the Pilot Project, the database was available to 
Depository Libraries only through DIALOG and STN. For the duration of the Pilot Project, however, 
DOE/OSTI made ITIS available to participating Depository Libraries.
Component I
The first component of the Pilot Project involved selecting a small group of Depository Libraries and 
training library staff in the use of ITIS, which provides electronic mail and a gateway to DIALOG 
in addition to access to the Energy Science and Technology Database. DOE cataloging records were 
also made available via downloading through ITIS or on magnetic tape for incorporation in the 
libraries’ own online catalogs.
The test libraries performed online searches, downloaded bibliographic information, and used the 
online gateway to access the full database on DIALOG and perform post-processing activities with 
retrieved files. A series of questionnaires was used to collect background information, costs, and

Executive Summary
other Project information throughout the test period and following its completion. DOE monitored 
the libraries’ usage of the system and provided a hotline service to assist with any questions or 
problems.
Results of the first survey in Component I showed that, prior to the Pilot Project, 81% of the 
responding libraries were not cataloging their DOE microfiche collection. Sixty percent, however, 
said an in-house online catalog was a source they “Often” to “Always” searched to satisfy patrons’ 
requests for scientific and technical information (STI). This may explain why, in 87% (14) of the 
libraries, this collection was typically accessed fifteen times or less a week, though 56% (9 libraries) 
estimated they received more than 16 STI requests per week (ranging from 16 to 170).
Shared cataloging was an important focus of Component I. MARC-like cataloging records were 
provided in an electronic file for the libraries to load into their online catalogs. The amount of 
programming required to enable this procedure exceeded the planned staff and budget support for 
several libraries. Another problem was the difficulty several libraries encountered when attempting 
to merge the MARC-like records with full MARC records already in the catalog. Both issues 
generated many write-in comments on the Component I surveys. Even so, on the final survey, 14 of 
the 17 libraries said that receiving DOE shared cataloging would be valuable to their libraries, at least 
to some extent. Half of those libraries stated that shared cataloging would be valuable to a “Very great 
extent.”
Finally, 41 % of the participating libraries said that, based on their experience with the Pilot Project, 
they thought their patrons would access the DOE microfiche collection “somewhat more fre-
quently,” and another 17% said “much more frequently.”
In addition to their ITIS online and per record costs, the participating libraries reported that they 
incurred cumulative total costs for all libraries of $36,272.35 during the Pilot Project. These other 
costs incurred by libraries varied greatly depending on how extensively they used the online system 
and the distance participants had to travel to Oak Ridge for the training. Staff salaries composed the 
largest single item of expense to the participating libraries. Total costs to participating libraries 
ranged from $332.00 to $8,515.00, with a median cost of $ 1,400.00 per library. Both GPO and DOE 
covered certain ITIS online costs which were not charged to the libraries.
Component II
The second project component was composed of two major parts: (1) a survey of all 1,398 Depository 
Libraries to assess their current and future use of various media for acquiring full-text scientific and 
technical information and (2) a technology assessment of existing and developing media to determine 
their applicability to the storage and dissemination of full-text information. A total of 1,064 of the 
1,398 Depository Libraries responded to the survey, for a response rate of 76%.
Responses to the survey were evaluated based on the number of libraries responding to each question 
and, where appropriate, whether or not the libraries currently receive DOE reports on microfiche. 
Of the libraries currently receiving DOE microfiche, 82% had received one or more patron requests 
for such scientific and technical information (STI) within the past six months. In comparison, 52% 
of all other libraries had received requests for STI within the same time frame. A relationship was 
ii


Accessing USDOE Scientific and Technical Information
Executive Summary
found between whether libraries receive DOE technical reports and the number of requests for STI 
received from patrons.
Over 45% of responding libraries stated that patrons have difficulty accessing information stored on 
microfiche. The most frequently cited reasons for this difficulty in order of occurrence were as follows: 
(1) patrons dislike the microfiche format, (2) a lack of awareness by patrons of the information available 
on microfiche, and (3) patrons had difficulty locating information stored on microfiche.
The responding libraries indicated that the three most-used media for acquiring all types of full-text 
information were as follows: (1) microfiche, (2) paper, and (3) compact discs, in that order. In response 
to a question asking how compact disc technology was used for all types of data/information, 96% of 
libraries that currently receive DOE reports and 91 % of libraries overall indicated that they use compact 
discs for archival storage, search and retrieval, or in some other capacity.
The libraries were further asked to indicate on which media they would prefer to access full-text 
information. Several media/mechanisms were listed, including downloading from remote or local 
hosts, optical discs, compact discs, floppy disks, magnetic tape, and paper. Compact discs were the 
most preferred medium of those listed, followed by paper. Optical discs and magnetic tape were the 
least preferred of all media. The preferred environment for accessing full-text information is via a 
personal computer (PC), either on a stand-alone system or connected to a local area network (LAN).
The two criteria for selecting a medium for storing and accessing full-text information most often 
cited by the responding libraries were (1) ease of information retrieval and (2) purchase cost. Other 
criteria receiving an overall ranking of at least “Great importance” were update/subscription costs, 
compatibility with current hardware, maintenance/operating costs, and compatibility with other 
media currently used. The most important criterion reported by libraries for selecting a user interface 
for searching, retrieving, and manipulating full-text information was easy search and retrieval of 
information. Other important criteria were the capability to accommodate both novice and expert 
users, and compatibility with current software/operating systems.
Component II: Technology Assessment
The technology assessment of Component II evaluated various media for their applicability and 
effectiveness for disseminating full-text information to Depository Libraries. This study covered the 
issues of library preferences, costs to produce and disseminate, storage capacity, searchability, and 
life span of each medium. A particular consideration was the need to incorporate graphic and 
pictorial data along with the full text of reports on any medium selected for dissemination.
The issue of dissemination of full-text information on alternative media to microfiche will diminish 
somewhat in importance if more searchable full-text online databases become available. However, 
widespread availability of these databases and the technology needed to make information residing 
in them fully searchable and retrievable will not become a reality for several years. It is also possible 
that the potential of online full-text databases may never be realized due to the costs associated with 
creating, maintaining, and accessing them.
At present, the most realistic electronic alternative to microfiche for dissemination of full-text 
information is CD-ROM. This medium is preferred by most libraries, is relatively inexpensive to 
iii

Executive Summary
produce, requires less storage space than microfiche or paper, retains the integrity of data, and can 
be easily searched. However, the life span of this medium is currently unknown, rendering its 
potential for long-range storage of information somewhat questionable. The volume of DOE reports 
distributed to Depository Libraries (currently approximately 14,000 per year) could require the 
creation of as many as 4 new CD-ROM discs per week. In addition, if libraries want to be able to 
provide simultaneous access to multiple users, the acquisition of CD-ROM “jukeboxes” and 
network interfaces could be required. Because many libraries have limited budgets for acquisition 
of additional equipment, CD-ROM may not be an ideal choice for disseminating full text despite its 
many benefits.
Providing a CD-ROM containing cataloging information corresponding to microfiche and paper 
shipments of DOE research results rather than the full text of these documents would provide better 
access and reference to this information. Additionally, making the indexing information available 
on a CD-ROM would capitalize on the libraries’ expressed desire to access full text information via 
a PC.
In conclusion, the Pilot Project provided both GPO and DOE with much valuable information that 
will help guide their decisions on the dissemination of full-text information. Because the ultimate 
value of information depends on its accessibility, this issue is paramount in making any decisions 
about which medium or media is best suited to full-text dissemination. Improving the ways in which 
information on existing media is indexed and referenced may be the most feasible alternative until 
the technology of full-text online databases matures. Finally, the technology of disseminating 
searchable full-text information over national and international networks is rapidly evolving and 
merits close attention.

Accessing USDOE Scientific and Technical Information
Background
BACKGROUND
In response to the 1987 Joint Committee on Printing (JCP) resolution urging the United States 
Government Printing Office (GPO) to test the feasibility and practicality of disseminating govern-
ment publications to Depository Libraries in electronic formats, GPO and the Department of Energy 
(DOE) proposed and received approval for a Pilot Project to evaluate electronic dissemination of and 
access to DOE research results by Depository Libraries. The Project consisted of two interrelated 
components: (1) evaluating online access to DOE services and databases by Depository Libraries and 
(2) a technological evaluation of the feasibility of disseminating DOE research results in electronic 
format rather than on microfiche. GPO and DOE signed an Interagency Agreement in July 1990, and 
GPO allocated $ 133,000 for the project. The objective of the GPO/DOE Interagency Agreement was 
to evaluate ways to improve the dissemination of, access to, and utilization of DOE research results 
provided to Depository Libraries.
Because it is relatively inexpensive to produce and takes less storage space than paper, microfiche 
has long been the medium of choice for distributing full-text information to libraries. However, the 
need for quicker and more efficient access to information has prompted a reassessment of other media 
as potential alternatives to microfiche.
DOE distributes microfiche of over 14,000 technical reports annually. These reports, which are 
prepared by or for DOE, contain scientific and technical information related to energy. Recipients 
of the fiche include the agency itself and its authorized contractors, researchers in the scientific and 
technical communities, U.S. industry, academia, and the public, as well as users from foreign 
countries. Microfiche is distributed directly to DOE and contractor sites. DOE has formal agreements 
with the National Technical Information Service and the Government Printing Office to provide 
fiche to the public and Depository Libraries.
Microfiche is distributed weekly from Oak Ridge, Tennessee, to Depository Libraries on the basis 
of selection profiles provided by GPO. GPO and DOE jointly fund the production and distribution 
of DOE microfiche to Depository Libraries.
Prior to the Pilot Project, only Depository Libraries holding DOE contracts were able to obtain access 
to the internal DOE online system, the Integrated Technical Information System (ITIS). DOE 
research and development information is currently available to Depository Libraries and the general 
public only commercially through DIALOG Information Services and STN International. At the 
time of the Pilot Project, online users of ITIS paid $30 per hour of connect time and $0.25 for each 
record downloaded or printed.

Component I
COMPONENT I: INFORMATION ACCESS
For this first component, referred to as the Information Access or the Online Access Component, 
17 Depository Libraries and GPO were given expanded and enhanced access to DOE scientific and 
technical information. (Because one site did not actively participate in the online part of the project 
after the initial training, 16 sites plus GPO used the online system.) To accomplish this, user accounts 
for the participating libraries were established on the Integrated Technical Information System 
(ITIS), a system primarily serving DOE and major DOE contractors.
Services Provided to Participating Depository Libraries
ITIS access allowed the participating libraries to use or test the following:
1. The Energy Science and Technology Database (EDB) on ITIS
This database contains unlimited, unclassified scientific and technical information processed at 
OSTI in support of DOE’s research and development activities and interests in energy and 
energy-related fields. OSTI makes available only a fourteen-month window of the most current 
information on ITIS. The entire file is available on DIALOG and STN, but because the ITIS 
version is updated nightly as items are processed, bibliographic records may be available on ITIS 
two to six weeks before they become available commercially. Access to the ITIS version of this 
database allowed the participating Depository Libraries to have timely access to the newest 
information as it is received at OSTI and provided them with more access points in addition to 
the existing paper indexes and DIALOG. Online availability of the subject thesaurus and the 
DOE authority files used in preparing the bibliographic records also enhanced the libraries’ 
access to this information. Another feature of the ITIS version of this database was the availability 
of the OSTI Search-Aid Menus (OSAM). This menu-driven user interface was developed to 
provide new users with the ability to search the Energy Science and Technology Database 
without having to know the database software command language. The interface was made 
available to the Pilot Project users to supplement and reinforce the search training provided by 
OSTI. Access to the database and these complementary features was made available at a special 
low rate to promote usage to enhance the librarians’ knowledge of this body of information.
2. A shared cataloging product in MARC-like format
Shared cataloging provided cataloging records to match, one for one, the full-text of DOE 
technical reports received on microfiche by the Depository Libraries. The bibliographic records 
were pulled from the Energy Science and Technology Database at the same time and by the same 
stored search profile that produced the list of microfiche to be shipped each week to recipients. 
The electronic records were then converted from the COSATI format used in the database to a 
MARC-like format more compatible with standard library applications. The purpose of the 
conversion was to transfer data as they appear in OSTI records into a format meeting the 
nationally defined standards for a minimum level MARC record; it was not to change the data 
or how the data elements were ordered or formatted within the fields. Thus, the records were 
described as MARC-like, rather than being “full” MARC records in which the contents have been 
generated according to the Anglo-American Cataloging Rules, 2nd Edition (AACR2). The 
converted file was then automatically delivered each week to each Pilot Project user’s ITIS 
account area. This made it immediately available for downloading from the system. With 
3

Component I
appropriate technical support at the libraries, it was planned that these files would then be 
uploaded into libraries’ online catalogs. This was to provide enhanced access to and usage of 
DOE microfiche for which cataloging did not currently exist or was normally separated from the 
cataloging of the libraries’ main collection. For the convenience of the libraries who could utilize 
it, OSTI also provided the shared cataloging files on magnetic tape.
3. An online, post-processing gateway to DOE files on DIALOG
The ITIS gateway was designed to provide users with an automated, menu-driven way to combine 
files of older Energy Science and Technology Database records on DIALOG with the newest 
information on ITIS. The records retrieved from DIALOG were converted back into COS ATI 
format when brought through the gateway to facilitate merging with ITIS records. The gateway 
deleted any duplicate records resulting from the overlap between the two systems and presented menu 
options for various report formats and sorts. These reports could be printed on the user’s local printer, 
printed offline at OSTI for postal delivery, or downloaded. Online editing of the merged files and on-
line toggling between DIALOG’S format and ITIS’s format were also part of the gateway’s features.
The ITIS access, which also provided electronic mail as a communication link between the libraries, 
OSTI, and GPO, was to be available for a six-month period. Access actually began the end of January 
1991 in conjunction with the ITIS training provided at OSTI and continued until August 16, 1991. 
(Note: Collection of usage statistics for tracking and billing ended July 31,1991. The final two weeks 
of access were for wrap-up activities only.) Figure 1 presents an overview of the services provided

to the participating libraries along with OSTI’s position in the DOE organizational structure at the 
time of the Pilot Project.
DOE and GPO Support of Component I
Throughout the early months of 1990, various GPO and DOE/OSTI personnel met to finalize the 
details of the Interagency Agreement. This group also worked together to prepare the information 
packet that would go out to Depository Libraries inviting them to participate in the Pilot Project. 
Also, at the request of GPO, an OSTI representative attended the spring meeting of the Depository 
Library Council Meeting held in Scottsdale, Arizona, to promote the upcoming project and answer 
questions that potential participants might have.
OSTI performed the following work in 1990 to ensure its readiness to provide Component I support 
for the 1991 project:
Finalized preparations to make the shared cataloging product available for beta testing.
• Completed the ITIS gateway to make it available for beta testing.
Completed the OSTI Search-Aid Menus (OSAM), a menu-driven user interface for the 
Energy Science and Technology Database.
Modified the accounting software to provide system usage tracking and billing at the special, 
reduced rate agreed upon for participating Depository Libraries. The ability to track online time 
in the shared cataloging module and online time as well as record output in the gateway module 
was added to the system in 1990 so that Pilot Project usage could be reported even though, for 
these test modules, it was free of charge.
Modified ITIS training class modules and materials to concentrate on Pilot Project needs and 
objectives.
To help the participating Depository Libraries maximize their use of ITIS, OSTI offered a three- 
day training class in January 1991. The class included an overview of ITIS and its relationship to 
OSTI s mission, an overview of the content and coverage of the Energy Science and Technology 
Database, instructions on developing and executing search strategies, a preview of OSAM, 
instructions on accessing the system and choosing a password, instructions on downloading or 
printing from the database, the use of electronic mail, and demonstrations of the shared cataloging 
downloading facility and the various options of the ITIS Gateway. Hands-on exercises were used 
or practice with each instruction module. In addition, the training staff helped attendees set up their 
accounts and worked with them to ensure they could return to their libraries and help their 
colleagues do the same. Two requests were made of OSTI by the attending librarians: (1) that 
participation be expanded to allow more than two password holders per site and (2) that libraries 
be supplied with tapes of shared cataloging as a backup to the downloading option on ITIS. OSTI 
agreed to both requests.
During the Project, ITIS was available from 6:00 a.m. Eastern time until 11:00 p.m. Eastern time 
Monday through Friday. The ITIS Hotline was also made available to participating Depository 
Libraries to assist users with all types of questions or problems.

Site Selection
On October 22,1990, Superintendent of Documents Donald E. Fossedal sent a letter to the then 255 
Depository Libraries that were receiving DOE microfiche, announcing the GPO/DOE Pilot Project 
and requesting their voluntary participation. A copy of the information package is provided in 
Appendix A. Also included was a survey asking for demographic information about their facilities. 
A total of 154 of these libraries responded to this request. Nineteen of the responding libraries 
indicated that they would be willing to participate in the Pilot Project. The other 135 libraries were 
asked to list the reasons they could not participate. Basic tabulated data for this survey is contained 
in Appendix A.
The most common reason for not participating (cited by 83 libraries, or 61% of the 135) was 
insufficient staff resources available to support the project. Another 68 libraries (50%) felt that 
there would not be sufficient library user demand for energy information to warrant project 
participation. Another commonly cited reason (by 64 libraries, or 47%) was that the libraries did 
not have funds to support the travel costs for staff training associated with the Pilot Project. The 
following reasons for not participating were cited by at least 25 libraries each: libraries did not wish 
to institute a service that might be discontinued after the end of the project; libraries did not have 
an online catalog; libraries did not have local automated data processing (ADP) support; and 
libraries did not have funds available to support telecommunication costs. Overall, costs of 
participation and inadequate staff resources were the most significant reasons for lack of partici-
pation in this project.
Libraries selected for participation in the Pilot Project were required to meet the following criteria:
• Be a current recipient of either the full set of DOE microfiche or a portion thereof.
• Have an online catalog for accessing the library collection.
• Be responsible for local software development to support moving shared cataloging records into 
the library’s online catalog.
• Have the necessary equipment to access and download from ITIS, including an IBM or compatible 
PC, a Hayes Smartmodem or compatible, appropriate communications software that supports the 
Kermit file transfer protocol, and an optional local printer.
• Dedicate staff time to participate in training, usage of the online system, downloading of shared 
cataloging records, ADP support, and providing feedback to DOE.
• Have the necessary funds available for travel costs associated with training and telecommunica-
tion costs.
• Have a valid DIALOG account and password to be able to access DIALOG through the online gateway.
The initial plan was to choose 15 libraries meeting these requirements at random. Five additional slots 
were set aside for discretionary assignment. However, of the 19 libraries willing to participate, only 
17 were able to commit the necessary staff and budget resources. Therefore, it was decided to allow 
all of the 17 libraries to participate although they did not all meet all of the specifications. Specifically, 
one library, West Virginia University, did not have an online catalog. Of the 17 libraries selected, 
one did not participate in the online access portion of the Project. GPO participated as an additional 
test site in the Project.

Objectives
Objectives of Component I were to determine the following:
Search, retrieval, and cataloging capabilities the participating Depository Libraries currently have 
and plan to have in the future.
• Sources the participating Depository Libraries rely on to direct patrons to the DOE microfiche 
collection.
• The extent of use of DOE information provided on microfiche.
Factors contributing to the use or nonuse of DOE information provided on microfiche.
• The usefulness of electronic cataloging of DOE scientific and technical information (STI) 
distributed to Depository Libraries in microfiche.
Additional objectives intended primarily to provide information for internal OSTI use were to
• Determine the feasibility and desirability of providing electronic cataloging for DOE research 
results in a format suitable for uploading to libraries’ online catalogs.
Encourage the use of EDB as a pointer” to the DOE microfiche collection and explore the 
feasibility of online access replacing expensive paper indexes.
• Test the utility and value of the ITIS gateway as a tool for merging EDB information on DIALOG 
with the newest EDB records on ITIS and as a tool for customizing the results into various report 
formats and sorts.
The information collected will be assessed by OSTI management in making decisions about 
dissemination alternatives.
Finally, by enhancing the access to depository library collections of DOE research results for both 
students in universities and the public, the GPO Pilot Project supported DOE’s initiatives in both 
education and technology transfer.
Methodology
DOE/OSTI distributed three survey instruments during Component I to collect information used for 
this first part of the Pilot Project. The survey instruments and the tabulated data from these surveys, 
on which this report is based, are contained in Appendixes C, D, E, F, G, H, I, and J.
The initial survey, entitled Depository Library Use of DOE Microfiche,” consisted of 31 questions, 
many consisting of multiple parts, addressing the libraries’ normal practices in filing DOE 
microfiche, cataloging and accessing microfiche, microfiche promotion, library instruction, and 
handling requests for scientific and technical information. This survey was mailed to the libraries on 
April 10, 1991, with responses requested by April 26, 1991.
The second survey instrument, entitled “Technical Evaluation,” consisted of three separate parts. 
Part A included 11 multi-part questions designed to evaluate usage of ITIS and the Energy Science 
and Technology Database. Part B consisted of rated responses to 3 questions about the delivery 
mechanism, the cataloging records, and the overall satisfaction with the product. Part C asked

Component I
28 questions about the ITIS gateway. The Technical Evaluation survey was mailed to the libraries 
on June 25, 1991, with responses requested by July 1, 1991.
The last survey, entitled “Final Project Evaluation,” assessed changes in handling of the DOE 
microfiche collection as a result of the Pilot Project, overall response to the information provided 
through the online system and through the shared cataloging product, and response to Component I of 
the project as a whole. The final survey was mailed on January 22, 1992, with responses requested by 
January 31, 1992.
In addition to the surveys, OSTI collected information through tracking of the calls made to the ITIS 
Hotline and as a result of an OSTI visit on April 16, 1991, to the University of Colorado in Boulder 
and the Denver Public Library. A representative from the Colorado Alliance of Research Libraries 
Systems, Inc. (CARL), also attended the meetings. During the meetings, participants discussed 
progress of the libraries in using the shared cataloging bibliographic data and how the transmitted 
file could be better formatted to facilitate loading onto the CARL database.
Profile of Participating Libraries
Of the 17 selected libraries, 9 were regional depositories and 8 were selective depositories. (See 
Appendix A.) Sixteen of the libraries had total collections (depository and non-depository materials) 
larger than 600,000 volumes, and one library had a collection between 150,000 and 600,000 volumes. 
Fourteen were academic libraries, two were public libraries, and one was a state agency library. 
Four of the libraries were located in the Mountain time zone, six in the Central time zone, six in the 
Eastern time zone, and one in the Pacific time zone. A list of the participating libraries is given in 
Appendix B.
On the survey used to determine Depository Library interest in participating in the Pilot Project (see 
Appendix A, Question 6), 15 of the 17 libraries which became participants indicated that they were 
“very interested” in access to EDB on ITIS. Ten of these libraries indicated that they were “very 
interested” in the ITIS Gateway and shared cataloging aspects of the project.
Online Usage Statistics and Component I Costs
This portion of the report is organized into two sections. The first presents the online usage statistics 
gathered during Component I. These statistics show the pattern of ITIS usage across the six months 
of the Component I time frame, how the system usage was subdivided into four usage types or 
categories, and usage statistics for the individual libraries involved. The second section translates the 
usage data into cost figures, breaking them down further into who paid what. This section also 
includes the information that libraries sent in as part of the final Component I survey. It shows the 
costs they incurred during this portion of the Pilot Project for items such as training, staff time, etc.
The detail presented in the text stops at the library level. For detail down to the level of the individual 
users at the libraries, see the Project Tracking Statistics in Appendix I.
Online Usage Statistics
Of the 17 participating libraries, 16 logged on to ITIS during the time frame of Component I. They 
were connected to the system for a total of 264.05 online hours. Figure 2 shows the online hours 
across the six months of the Component I time frame.

System usage, for tracking and costing purposes, was divided into four categories or types. These were
• Database Usage—All online time logged when a user was in the Energy Science and Technology 
Database.
Shared Cataloging—All online time logged when a user was in the shared cataloging module and/ 
or downloading shared cataloging records.
• Gateway Usage—All online time logged when a user was in the Gateway module performing any 
of the Gateway operations, such as merging files, creating bibliographies and reports, and/or 
printing or downloading records obtained through the Gateway. This also included online time 
spent in the database when the database was entered through the gateway menu and not through 
the ITIS Main Menu.
Other Usage All online time logged when a user was in electronic mail or using general system 
menus and utilities, including downloading or printing database records with the options listed on 
the Download Saved Files Menu.
Each one of these categories or types of usage is a subset of total system usage, and, added together, 
the time logged in each one equals the 264.05 hours of ITIS online time. Figure 3 illustrates the 
breakdown.
Shared cataloging usage accounted for 59% of the total ITIS online hours and reflects the time users 
spent downloading these large files. The small amount of time logged for Gateway usage reflects 
what the surveys showed after the Pilot Project, that only eight libraries used the Gateway at all.
Figure 4 illustrates how system usage was subset into the four usage types or categories across the 
six months of the Component I time frame.

Usage of the Energy Science and Technology Database was of particular interest during Component I, 
and, for that reason, a more detailed discussion of that particular type or category of system usage is 
included here.
When a user entered the Energy Science and Technology Database, one of the four categories of 
system usage, the database software not only tracked the time the user spent there but also counted 
the entry as a session. The libraries logged a total of 45.97 hours in the database during 186 separate 
sessions. The line chart in Figure 5 shows the libraries’ total database usage across the six-month 
timeframe, measured in terms of both online time and number of sessions.

fractions of hours. The total of 2,758 minutes equals the 45.97 hours of database time shown in 
Figure 5 of this section and represents 17.4% (Figure 3) of the total ITIS online hours.
The libraries printed or downloaded a total of 8,129 records from the Energy Science and Technology 
Database during Component I.
Component I Costs
During the Component I time frame, ITIS was available to two separate populations for two separate 
cost-per-hour rates. DOE and DOE contractors continued to use the system at the rate normally 
charged them: $30.00 per hour for online connect time and $0.25 for each record downloaded or 
printed, regardless of format. Print options included prints routed to local printers attached to users’ 
personal computers or offline prints, which were then mailed to users. DOE customers did not have 
access to shared cataloging or to the ITIS Gateway.
While the Depository Libraries participating in Component I were charged the standard $0.25 for 
each record downloaded or printed from the Energy Science and Technology Database, a special, 
lower cost rate for online time was put in place for this population. This special rate was $16.00 per 
hour and applied to only two of the four types or categories of usage. The other two types of usage, 
including records obtained as a result of that usage, were provided by DOE/OSTI at no charge, either 
to GPO or to the participating Depository Libraries.
Accordingly, the four types or categories of usage defined earlier can be characterized as either 
“billed” or “non-billed” items.
12


Accessing USDOE Scientific and Technical Information
Component I
Billed Items—
• Database Usage: Subsidized by GPO on behalf of the libraries during the first two months of 
Component I and paid by the libraries themselves during the last four months. Rate was 
$16.00 per hour.
• Other Usage: Same as above.
• Records Downloaded or Printed from the Database: Paid by the libraries themselves 
throughout the entire six-month period. Rate was $0.25 per record, regardless of format or 
length.
Non-Billed Items—
• Shared Cataloging Usage: Provided by DOE throughout the entire six-month period at no cost 
to GPO or the libraries.
Shared Cataloging Records: All shared cataloging records, whether downloaded from the 
shared cataloging module on ITIS or on the magnetic tapes sent to each library were provided by 
DOE throughout the entire six-month period at no cost to GPO or the libraries.
• Gateway Usage: Provided by DOE throughout the entire six-month period at no cost to GPO or 
the libraries.
Records Downloaded or Printed from the Gateway: All records downloaded or printed through 
the Gateway options were provided by DOE throughout the entire six-month period at no cost to 
GPO or the libraries.
Note that libraries who used the Gateway to search DIALOG were charged as usual by DIALOG 
for the connect time and transactions on that system. Those charges would have been transmitted 
to the libraries through DIALOG’S normal billing methods and were never controlled by or seen 
by OSTI. The Gateway operations that were free to the Depository Libraries were those occurring
As noted earlier, the Depository Libraries spent a total of 264.05 hours connected to ITIS. The total 
dollar value of their online time was $4,224.77. Of this total, GPO subsidized 56.59 hours of online 
time for $905.45; the libraries paid $777.60 for 48.60 hours of online time; and DOE subsidized 
158.86 hours of online time for a value of $2,541.72.
Based on average monthly usage, the libraries made use of the billed portions of the system less 
during the four months when they were paying for this online time than they did during the first two 
months when GPO paid. They also used the DOE-subsidized portions of the system more than the 
billed portions of the systems both during the first two months and during the final four months of 
Component I. The breakdown of online usage costs paid for by GPO, DOE, and the libraries is given 
in Appendix I.
In the third survey of Component I, Question F.21, libraries were instructed, “For each of the 
following project cost components, please indicate the total cost to your library for the entire project

question is shown in Table 3. Note that these are costs in addition to the online costs discussed 
previously and also that the figures are incomplete because not all libraries provided data.
The table shows that, of these additional costs, travel and staff costs were the largest expense to the libraries, 
together composing 78% of the total reported costs. The median cost per was library $1,400.00.
Survey Results—Component I
This portion of the report presents the results of the three survey instruments administered during 
Component I. The tables of data and the accompanying text are organized under three main headings 
taken from the titles of the three questionnaires. Copies of the survey instruments, with results, and 
the responses to open-ended questions, explanations of responses, and comments returned from the 
participating libraries are found in Appendixes C, D, E, F, G, H, and J.
Depository Library Use of DOE Microfiche Survey Results
This first survey consisted of 31 questions aimed at discovering the normal practices of the libraries 
for handling the DOE microfiche, handling microfiche in general, and for handling users’ requests 
for scientific and technical information that may lead to the DOE microfiche. Because this survey 
was intended to establish baseline information, libraries were instructed to respond to the questions 
based on their operation prior to the beginning of the Pilot Project. Sixteen of the 17 libraries involved 
in Component I responded.
Discussion of this survey is organized into five sections and a summary. The first paragraph of each section 
identifies the specific questions from the survey instrument to which the section applies. A copy of the 
questionnaire itself, with results, is found in Appendix C. In addition, the individual responses to open- 
ended questions, explanations of responses, and libraries’ comments are found in Appendix D.
Methods Used for Storing and Filing Microfiche
Questions B. 1 through B.6 of the questionnaire asked the libraries about their normal practices for 
storing and filing DOE microfiche and microfiche in general. The first question asked the libraries 
to identify the physical location of their DOE microfiche collection. Eleven of the 16 responding 
libraries answered that DOE microfiche were housed in the main library. The other five respondents 
identified branch libraries, including a Physical Sciences Library, Science/Engineering branches, 
and a branch identified as the Accelerator Facility (Table 4 and Appendix D, Question B. 1).
The libraries were then asked to rank the accessibility of DOE microfiche to their patrons. On a five- 
point scale that ranged from “Very accessible” to “Not at all accessible,” 12 of the libraries (75%) 
indicated they were “Very accessible.” One did explain, however, that “You have to be on the right 
campus. A few of our energy information users work on a different campus one mile away” 
(Figure 6 and Appendix D, Question B.2.a).
Respondents were then given 5 questions and asked to check the answer that best described the 
accessibility of the DOE microfiche in their library. More than 80 percent replied that a “Yes” best 
answered four of the five questions. The percentage fell when replying to the question, “Is the index 
[to microfiche] located in the microfiche area?” Eight answered “Yes,” but 7 said “No” or 
“Somewhat/Sometimes” (Table 5).

Question B.3 asked “How are your filing systems for microfiche and paper copies of DOE reports 
organized?’' Given 10 statements that acted as answers, libraries were instructed to check all that applied. 
As Table 6 shows, respondents checked the DOE report number, the SuDocs call number, and the DE 
number for microfiche. The paper copies of DOE reports were filed by SuDocs call number, DOE report 
number, subject heading, or by the Library of Congress (L.C.) call number. Two libraries indicated they 
did not receive paper copies (Table 7). All of the libraries indicated that they stored their microfiche in 
microfiche files or drawers, with two indicating they also used boxes (Table 8).
The next two questions, B.5 and B.6, asked the libraries to identify the persons who usually retrieve 
microfiche, those who usually re-file them, and to indicate whether problems with missing or mis-
filed fiche attributable to the procedures for retrieving or re-filing were major or minor or whether there 
were “No problems.” Most (87.50%) of the libraries responded that both library staff and patrons may 
retrieve microfiche, but all answered that it is the library staff that usually refiles them (Table 9). Related

This section covers Questions C.7 through C.8.b and Question D.14. Attachment A to the 
questionnaire was a list of 49 DOE subject categories. The libraries were first asked, “During the past 
year, approximately how many collective requests for scientific and technical information (STI) 
related to these subject categories did your library typically receive in a week?” The survey question 
provided several ranges (for example, “5 to 10”) as answers; libraries were to check only one answer. 
Four of the 16 responding libraries estimated that they received more than 25 of these STI requests 
each week. These libraries wrote in their own numbers, estimating that they received STI requests 
ranging from 170 per week, to 150 or more, to 75, to 50 per week. Five of the other libraries reported 
receiving anywhere from 16 to 25 STI requests per week. Only three indicated they received less than 
five per week. (Figure 7).
The second part of this question (C.7.b) asked the libraries to indicate the average number of times 
per week that they accessed DOE microfiche to satisfy the requests identified in C.7.a. These 
numbers were lower. Only one library reported accessing the DOE fiche as often as 21 to 25 times 
a week, and 6 (37.50%) indicated less than 5 times a week (Figure 8).
Question C.8 also consisted of two parts. Part a of question C.8 (Table 11), still referring to requests 
for STI related to the DOE subject categories, asked the libraries to estimate what percentage of the 
time the patrons requested STI for specific time periods. Only 14 of the libraries responded to this 
question, and 2 of those marked “Not sure/no basis to respond.” Twelve libraries did respond, and, 
on average, 25.42% of the time requestors specified a time period. For 74.58% of the time they did 
not specify a time period. The median values were 20% of the time requesting a specified time period 
and 80% of the time not requesting a specified time period.
Part b of Question C.8 asked the libraries to estimate, for those patrons that did specify a time period, 
how often four different time period ranges were requested. Respondents were to provide an answer 
for each of the four ranges. The “Documents less than one year old” were requested “Very often” or

“Documents published in the past 1-5 years,” but again “Very often” or “Often” received most of 
the responses (85.71 %). “Documents published in the past 6-10 years” were marked as “Sometimes” 
or “Rarely” by 11 of 15 libraries, while none of the libraries marked “Often” or “Very often” for the 
older documents, those published “over 10 years ago” (Table 12).
Question D. 14 was aimed at discovering how online searches for library patrons are typically funded. 
Of the 14 libraries responding, 5 (35.71 %) said that “Depends on the type of query.” They explained 
their responses by noting that the costs of quick or ready reference searches were absorbed by the 
library but longer searches or subject bibliographies were paid for by the patron. Three others 
(21.43%) said that who pays “Depends on who the patron is”; two of those cited the difference as 
being between university faculty or students and those not affiliated with the university. While

another five libraries split between “Patron always pays” (3) and “Library always pays” (2), one 
library that marked “Other” explained, “A few databases are funded by library since subscription had 
to be cancelled and was a moderately or high use index, e.g., Chemical Abstracts. Patron usually pays 
full cost of 90% of online searches” (Figure 9 and Appendix D, Question D. 14).
Figure 9: How are online searches for library patrons typically funded?
Source: Appendixes C and D, Question D.14
‘Explanation of answer of “Depends on the type of query” (5 responses):
• 
Quick reference or verification of a citation is paid by library. Longer 
searches (i.e., more than 10 print-outs or over $6) are paid entirely by 
patron or their funded research.
• 
Library pays for quick reference searches. Patron pays for all others, 
either personally or with dept./grant funding.
• 
Ready reference searches are free. Longer searches the patron pays the full cost.
• 
Quick reference—library pays.
• 
Ready reference—paid by library, preparation of subject bib.—paid by patron.
fExplanation of answer of “Depends on who the patron is” (3 responses):
• 
Faculty/student pay cost less $10.00 Non-EWV.
• 
University students, staff & faculty get subsidized searching, so they 
pay only a portion of costs incurred. “Outside” people pay a flat fee plus 
full cost.
• 
Some are paid by endowment.
^Explanation of answer of “Other” (1 response):
• 
A few databases are funded by library since subscription had to be cancelled, and was a 
moderately or high use index (e.g., Chemical Abstracts). Patron usually pays full cost 
of 90 of online searches.
Based on 14 valid responses (i.e., two libraries checked more than one answer).
Methods Used To Locate and Access Microfiche
This section includes the responses to questions in three parts of the survey instrument, specifically 
Questions C.9.a, D.9.b, D.10 through D.13, and H.29 through H.30.
The first two questions concerned the reference sources that may lead a patron to the DOE microfiche 
collection. Respondents were given a list of 14 sources, including printed sources such as the Energy 
Research Abstracts (ERA), online sources such as databases on DIALOG, databases on CD-ROM, 
21

Component I
an in-house online catalog, and sources that were themselves on microfiche. They were asked to rate 
how often they used each of these sources to find information answering the STI requests related to 
DOE energy subject categories. Table 13 presents the responses.
In answer to Question C.9.a., the source for which the greatest number of respondents (6 of 15) 
marked Al ways/Almost always” was an in-house online catalog. The source which was the least 
(“Never/Almost never”) searched by the greatest number of respondents (8 of 15) was NS A on 
DIALOG. Responses for the Energy Science and Technology Database on ITIS ranged from “Often” 
for one respondent, through “Sometimes” for six others, to four libraries who marked “No Access/ 
Don’t Own.” It should be remembered that respondents were instructed at the beginning of this 
questionnaire to answer in terms of their operation prior to the start of the DOE Pilot Project.
Energy Research Abstracts (ERA) was used more often than DOE Energy on DIALOG, with 
5 respondents marking Always/Almost Always” and “Often” for ERA and only one marking either 
one of those frequencies for the database on DIALOG. Both sources, however, received nearly the 
same number of respondents saying they used the source “Sometimes.”
There were 10 responses for “Other CD-ROM” and “Other.” Those additional sources named by the 
libraries are found in Table 13 and Appendix D under Question C.9.a.
With the various reference sources identified, the libraries were asked to rate how often each one of those 
sources led them or their patrons to the DOE microfiche collection. Possible responses for each source 
ranged from Always/Almost Always to “No Access/Don’t Own.” “An in-house online catalog,” which, 
in C.9.a, outranked all of the other sources for the number of “Always/Almost Always” and “Often” 
responses received, fell to fifth place in this part of the scale when respondents were estimating how often 
the sources they searched to answer STI requests led them or their patrons to the DOE microfiche 
collection. This appears logical in light of the fact that 81.25% of the responding libraries said they did 
not catalog their DOE fiche. Thirteen libraries said that ERA “Always/Almost Always” or “Often” led 
them to the fiche. It is interesting to note that DOE’s energy information on DIALOG was marked by only 
1 library as a source it always or often searched, but 11 respondents said it always or often led them to the 
DOE fiche. How the respondents replied for each of the sources is found in Table 14.
The respondents were then asked to rate, in Question D. 10, each one of six different types of requests 
in terms of how often those types led them or their patrons to access DOE microfiche. Table 19 shows 
that the request types receiving the most positive (“Always/Almost Always” and “Often”) ratings 
from more than 50% of the respondents were those based on a specific DOE report number identified 
from a printed or an online source. The query type that rated lowest (“Never/Almost Never” or 
“Rarely”) with the greatest number of respondents (15 of 16) was “Subject browsing of collection 
using fiche subject headers” (Table 15).
Table 16 displays the responses given to Question D.l 1, which was, “When patrons request a 
specific DOE report, how often have they used the following sources to identify information 
about the report?” The footnotes, references, and bibliographies of other reports or papers, and 
OCLC were noted under the “Other” category as additional sources that “Often” have been used 
to identify information about specific DOE reports (Appendix D, Question D.l 1).
Question D. 12 asked respondents to describe how patrons usually behave when reviewing the DOE 
microfiche they have accessed. Respondents were to check as many of the seven choices as applied.

Table 17 shows that 11 of the 15 responding libraries (73.33%) indicated that patrons usually used 
the microfiche printer to print specific pages or references. Using the microfiche reader and then 
requesting a printout of the entire report, if relevant, was also a common patron behavior; 8 of the 
15 respondents (53.33%) marked this choice. Only one library indicated that patrons usually skip any 
references that are contained on microfiche.
Three of 15 libraries said they made DOE microfiche physically available (i.e., retrievable) within 
1 to 2 days after receiving them in a shipment, while 5 others marked “Within a Week.” Only one 
library responded that it took “Longer than one Month” after receipt for them to make DOE 
microfiche physically available to patrons. All 16 libraries responded to the second part of this 
question as to how quickly after a shipment they made microfiche bibliographically available (i.e., 
announced or available to patrons in an index), but half of them marked “Not Sure.” Six of the other 
eight ranged from Within a Week to Within a Month.” Two marked “Longer than one Month” 
(Table 18).

The last two questions discussed in this section are H.29 and H.30 on the survey instrument. When 
asked if they or their patrons had experienced any significant difficulties in effectively accessing 
DOE technical report literature, 10 of the 16 libraries answered “Yes.” These 10 were then asked 
to check all choices that applied out of 8 statements describing the nature of the access difficulty 
referred to in H.29. The ninth choice was “Other.” Table 19 shows how many check marks were 
made for each of the choices. Two statements received an equal number of check marks and 
obviously outranked all the other choices; these were the statements indicating that patrons 
were unaware of the availability of microfiche and/or that they disliked the microfiche format 
(Appendix D, Question H.30).

Methods Used To Acquire and Maintain Microfiche Cataloging Records
This section includes Questions E.15 through E.30 on the survey instrument and deals with the 
libraries’ normal practices prior to the Pilot Project for acquiring and cataloging microfiche.
Question E.15 asked, “On which media, if any, do you receive cataloging records for books, 
monographs, reports, etc?” The libraries were instructed to check all of the seven choices that applied, 
including “Other.” All 16 libraries answered. Most (81.25%) of them were receiving cataloging 
records on magnetic tape, and half of them were downloading cataloging from online sources. The 
other media were not as common, though “CD-ROM” received more check marks than the last three 
combined (Figure 10).
The libraries were then asked to check all media they currently used to maintain their cataloging 
records (including those produced internally as well as those acquired from external sources). All but 
27

2 of the 16 libraries checked “Online catalog.” Magnetic tape was another common medium for 
maintaining cataloging records. See the range of responses in Figure 11.
Vendors from which they obtained cataloging records for books and monographs were identified by 
the libraries as OCLC, GPO, the Library of Congress, and RLIN. All of the libraries indicated that 
they received records from OCLC, and five circled this vendor as their preferred choice. The other 
11 libraries did not indicate a preference (Figure 12).

Note: Five libraries (31.25%) selected OCLC as their preferred source.
The libraries were asked if they anticipated using the same vendor(s) for cataloging records of 
technical reports. Seven of the 15 libraries answered “Yes,” 4 answered “No,” and 5 marked 
“Not sure.” Those that were “Not sure” indicated they did not catalog all fiche reports or technical 
documents. (See Appendix D, Question E.18 for the specific responses.)
Question E. 19 asked each respondent to check 
one of four statements that best described that 
library’s method of cataloging DOE microfiche 
in particular. All but three (81.25%) answered 
that they did not catalog these fiche prior to the 
Pilot Project (Table 20). Of the three who were 
cataloging fiche, two indicated they “acquire 
cataloging from an external source only,” and 
one marked “We perform the cataloging inter-
nally only.”

fiche prior to the Pilot Project were asked to

Statements to the effect that cataloging these fiche was “Too expensive,” that there was “Not enough 
time, and Not enough demand for DOE fiche to justify the time/expense” each received check 
marks from more than 50% of the respondents (Table 21).

Note: Only the 13 libraries selecting an answer of “Do not catalog DOE microfiche” on Question E.19 were 
eligible to answer this question.
The two libraries which indicated in Question E. 19 that they acquired their cataloging for DOE fiche 
from external sources were asked to list these sources in answer to Question E.21. One library listed 
“OCLC, Energy Abstracts, SuDocs (Mo. Cat), and CD-ROM (GDCS).” The other listed download-
ing from DOE/OSTI (Appendix D, Question E.21). This second respondent may have been 
answering in regard to the situation during the Pilot Project rather than before it began.
Remember that only three libraries indicated they were cataloging DOE microfiche prior to the Pilot 
Project. When these three were asked if the DOE microfiche cataloging was merged with the 
cataloging of the library’s other collections, two answered “Yes”; one answered “No.” The library 
answering “No” was asked to check the statement that best described why cataloging for DOE 
microfiche was maintained separately. The library chose the statement, “System cannot accommo-
date quantity.” See Question E.23 of the survey instrument in Appendix C for the other choices that 
could have been marked but were not.
Library Promotion of DOE Microfiche
Questions F.24 and F.25 asked libraries how they raise awareness of or promote DOE microfiche. 
Methods that libraries indicated they used to make library patrons aware of this collection included 
a wide range of activities, from library instruction to posting bulletins or flyers to circulating lists of 
titles (Table 22).
Ten of the 16 libraries indicated that, outside the library, “Word of mouth” was a way of promoting DOE 
microfiche, while 6 marked the statement “Do not promote any fiche collection externally.” The 
respondents could mark all statements that applied, and Table 23 shows that every response except the one 
that specifically excludes DOE fiche from microfiche promotion was checked at least once.
Treatment of DOE Microfiche in Library Instruction
This section covers responses for Questions G.26 through G.28. Libraries were asked, “If your staff 
provides any type of general instruction or orientation on library use or use of the fiche collection, 
is information regarding DOE microfiche included in this instruction/orientation?” Two of the libraries 
marked “No”; the rest answered “Yes” (7) or “Sometimes” (7). Those replying in the affirmative were

Technical Evaluation Survey Results (Mid-Project Findings)
This second survey consisted of 14 questions in Part A, 3 questions in Part B, and 28 questions in 
Part C. It was designed to evaluate the libraries’ experience at the mid-project point with ITIS, the 
Energy Science and Technology Database, shared cataloging, and the ITIS Gateway. Accordingly, 
the libraries’ responses do not indicate their final evaluation of the services and products utilized 
during Component I. Sixteen of the 17 participating libraries responded to this survey.
Discussion of this survey is organized into four sections. The first paragraph of each section identifies 
the specific questions from the survey instrument to which the section applies. A copy of the 
questionnaire itself, with results, is found in Appendix E. In addition, the individual responses to 
open-ended questions, explanations of responses, and libraries’ comments are found in Appendix D.
Library Use of the Integrated Technical Information System
This section covers survey questions from Part A, 1.1 through 1.3. The libraries were instructed to 
respond to this set of questions “based on your experience to date” with ITIS.
The first question asked, “Approximately how many times have you used ITIS?” Of the 16 libraries 
that responded to this question, 50% marked “11 or more times,” and another 31.25% (5 libraries) 
indicated they had used the system “6 to 10 times” (Figure 13). All of the 16 responding libraries had 
used ITIS at least one time.
Fifteen (93.75%) of the libraries said there were no significant differences between “what the 
documentation states and how the system actually operates.” The remaining library marked “Don’t 
know/No basis to judge” (Appendix E, Question A. 1.2).
The third question instructed the libraries to rate the ease or difficulty of 10 activities related to using 
ITIS. The scale for rating each one went from “Very easy” to “Very difficult,” with “No basis to

answered “Generally easy” than those who chose other answers on the scale. The lead was small in 
these two cases, however, and, for both these activities, four libraries marked “No basis to judge.” 
Eight (a different set of eight) of the 10 activities had at least one respondent marking “Very easy,” 
and only 2 of the 10 had anyone marking “Very difficult.”
Library Use of the Energy Science and Technology Database
Question A.2.5 asked the libraries to indicate approximately how many times they had used the 
Energy Science and Technology Database. Note that this is not the same as the question asked at the 
beginning of this survey concerning how many times the libraries had used ITIS. Libraries could 
connect to ITIS and perform other activities rather than entering and using the database. They could 
use the electronic mail feature, download shared cataloging records, or use the ITIS Gateway. 
Accordingly, the responses, shown in Figure 14, indicated for this question differ from those given 
for Question A. 1.1. One library indicated that at this mid-project point it had “Never” used the 
database. This respondent was directed to proceed to Part B of the survey, leaving the other 15 
libraries to answer the remaining questions in Part A.
Figure 14: Approximately how many times have you used the Energy Science and Technology Database?
Source: Appendix E, Question A.2.5
Question A.2.6 asked, “To date, how useful has the database been for your purposes?” Only one 
respondent chose “Extremely useful,” but 33.33% rated it as “Very useful.” Of the remaining nine, 
five (33.33%) answered “Moderately useful,” and four (26.67%) chose “Hardly or not at all useful” 
to answer the question (Figure 15).
When asked in Question A.2.7, “When you search the database, about how often are you able to 
retrieve useful information for yourself or patrons?,” 11 of the 15 libraries eligible to respond chose 
“Always or almost always” or “Often” for their reply (Figure 16).

The libraries were asked in A.2.8, “Has the database provided you with information that was not available 
in your library before?” Nine (60%) answered “Yes.” Of the remaining six, four said “No,” and two chose 
“Don’t know/No basis to judge” as their reply. Nine also said “Yes,” the database provided “information 
that is more up-to-date than what was available in the library before.” Three respondents said “No,” and 
three answered “Don’t know/No basis to judge” (Appendix E, Questions A.2.8 and A.2.9).
When asked if the database provided “information that is in a more useful format (e.g., computer- 
readable file) than what was available in the library before?,” the number answering “Yes” changed.

Six respondents said “Yes,” while seven (46.67%) said “No.” Two libraries marked “Don’t know/

The final question in Part A asked the libraries, “What types of patrons have you been able to serve 
with information from the database?” Ten choices were listed, with the respondents instructed to 
check all that applied. As Figure 17 shows, 73.33% (11) of the respondents checked “Graduate 
students,” and 66.67% (10) selected “Professors/Instructors.” The choice “General public” earned 
one more check mark than did “Scientists/Researchers.” The library that marked “Other” com-
mented that database searches had so far been done for practice rather than to meet patron requests 
(Figure 17 and Appendix F, Question A.2.11).

records. The shared cataloging module on ITIS allowed users to see the filenames of the shared 
cataloging records in their indexes and choose one file or several at a time to download via Kermit. 
The index also showed a size and an estimated transmission time for each file.
Six statements related to the downloading capabilities of shared cataloging were provided in 
Question B. 1. Libraries were asked to respond to each statement using a five-point scale ranging from 
“Strongly Agree” to “Strongly Disagree.” The middle value was “Not Sure/Don’t Know.” Responses 
collected for this choice were not considered as either agreement or disagreement in the discussion 
below. Fifteen libraries responded to this question.

Component I
Respondents agreed, 11 (73.33%) to 2, that “Access via ITIS is straightforward and easily 
accomplished.” Eleven also agreed with the statement, “Download menu is easily understood.” 
Agreement dropped to an 8 to 4 ratio for the statement “Download procedure is easy.” The number 
of libraries disagreeing with any statement was greatest for the statement, “Time required to perform 
download is satisfactory.” Six libraries marked “Strongly Disagree,” and two more marked 
“Somewhat Disagree.” Only one respondent strongly agreed that the downloading time was 
satisfactory. The responses for statements about help messages and user instructions spread across 
the scale with the exception that no library strongly disagreed with these two statements (Table 26).
Based on your experience, please rate the downloading capabilities of shared cataloging.

A second part to this question allowed the libraries to provide additional explanations of or comments 
on their responses. Ten of the 15 libraries wrote in comments. The full text of their comments is found 
in Appendix F under Question B. 1. Four mentioned their dissatisfaction with the time required for 
downloading, while two noted telecommunications problems that interrupted their downloading 
process. One library noted they had had no problems downloading but were unable to subsequently 
upload the file into their online catalog because it was not binary.
Though most of these comments appeared to be related to the disagreement responses made in 
Table 26 and were negative in nature, one respondent wrote, “Downloading these records has not 
been difficult; uploading is now equally easy for us to perform. I view the uploading of these records 
as being extremely valuable, and our patrons agree. They are using DOE materials as never before__
even for general subject requests” (Appendix F, Question B.l).
Question B.2 focused more on the product being delivered, the shared cataloging records themselves, 
rather than on the delivery mechanism. The question read, “Based on your experience, please rate 
your satisfaction with the cataloging records. Five statements were made, to which libraries were to 
mark one answer to each on a five-point scale ranging from “Strongly Agree” to “Strongly Disagree.” 
As in the previous question, the middle value was “Not Sure/Don’t Know.”
37


Accessing USDOE Scientific and Technical Information
Component I
For each of the statements, the largest number of respondents chose the answer “Not Sure/Don’t 
Know.” This may be because, at the mid-project point, many of the libraries had not yet succeeded 
in uploading the electronic file of cataloging records into their individual catalogs where the records 
could be fully evaluated.
Of those who did mark the non-neutral choices on the scale, respondents disagreed four to two with 
the statement, “OSTI elements occur in correct MARC fields.” Six respondents split evenly when 
agreeing or disagreeing with the statement, “Selected data elements are appropriate to our cataloging 
needs.” Of the three respondents who provided an opinion on the statement, “Cataloging records 
match microfiche,” two agreed, while one marked “Somewhat Disagree.” In regard to the user 
support information, four agreed that it was adequate; three disagreed (Table 27).
Libraries again were invited to provide comments on or explanations of their responses to the 
statements in B.2, and, again, 10 responded. Eight of their 10 comments focused on dissatisfaction 
with the format of the M ARC-like record and/or difficulties associated with uploading the file to their 
online catalogs and merging it with existing cataloging. The full text of these detailed comments is 
provided in Appendix F under Question B.2.
The final question in Part B asked the libraries to rate their overall satisfaction with shared cataloging. 
Again, many respondents replied to each of the five statements by choosing “Not Sure/Don’t Know.” 
Of those who did register an opinion, five disagreed while only three agreed that “The overall quality 
of this product is satisfactory.” The strongest disagreement was registered for “The method of 
obtaining the record is acceptable.” Six libraries disagreed as opposed to three who agreed.
Based on your experience, please rate your satisfaction with the cataloging records.

When given the statement, “The quality of the cataloging records is acceptable as it presently stands,” 
five agreed, and four disagreed. An even split of opinion was registered for the statement “This 
product meets our microfiche cataloging needs,” while nine libraries marked “Not Sure/Don’t 
Know” to that. In responding to the statement, “Our organization would be interested in subscribing 
to this product if it was made available,” five libraries indicated agreement, five disagreed, and five 
were “Not Sure/Don’t Know” (Table 28).
For the third time in this section on shared cataloging, the libraries provided explanations or comments. 
Five of the nine commenting libraries indicated they would prefer to receive shared cataloging records on 
magnetic tape, and one registered a preference for a CD-ROM of this product. Inability to easily and/or 
quickly upload these files and merge them with existing cataloging was noted again.
The libraries that commented on Questions B. 1 through B .3 took the time and trouble to make lengthy 
explanations. Their comments provide excellent information, and all three sets of these comments 
on shared cataloging should be read in full in Appendix F.
Based on your experience, please rate your overall satisfaction with shared cataloging.

Library Use of the ITIS Communication Gateway
This section covers questions from Part C, which asked the libraries to evaluate the ITIS Gateway 
as “a viable service to depository libraries.” After Question C.2, where 8 of the 16 libraries indicated 
that they had Never used the ITIS Gateway at this mid-point of the project, only the remaining 8 
were eligible to continue this part of the survey. It should be noted that, of these 8 libraries, 4 indicated

Component I
that they only used the Gateway one time (Figure 18). Consequently, few libraries had the requisite 
experience to meaningfully answer items in this section. As might be expected, the majority of 
eligible libraries answering items either did not respond, chose the “Not sure’’ or “Don’t know” 
categories, or otherwise indicated that they had not used a particular Gateway function. Given this 
minimal response rate, only selected items are reported here. Specific responses to all 28 questions 
in Part C are contained in the Appendixes E and F.
Figure 18: Approximately how many times have you used the ITIS Gateway?
Source: Appendix E, Question C.2
The ITIS Gateway allowed users to merge the results of searches in the Energy, Science and 
Technology Database on ITIS with older records on DIALOG. The search results were combined in 
a personal database that could be viewed, sorted, or printed as desired. A series of questions explored 
the use of ITIS or other systems to merge files of search results from different sources. For example, 
question C.3 asked, “Have you used the ITIS Gateway to merge search results files from ITIS and 
DIALOG?” Four of the eight libraries responding to this section replied “Yes” and were eligible to 
answer Questions C.4 and C.5 (Appendix E, Question C.3). Two libraries wrote in explanations or 
comments; see Appendix F under Question C.3.
Question C.4 asked the four eligible libraries to rate the merger activity on a five-point scale ranging 
from “Very satisfactory” to “Very unsatisfactory” and including “Don’t know.” The four respon-
dents split evenly here, with two marking “Very satisfactory,” and two marking “Very unsatisfac-
tory” (Figure 19).
On a question addressing the personal database services of the ITIS Gateway, respondents were 
asked, “Did the following personal database services work as described?” The six services were then 
listed, with the eight libraries instructed to choose one answer for each from the four yes/no type 
choices. Many of the responses were collected under “Didn’t Use” or “Not Sure.” Table 29 shows 
the responses for each service.

When asked to rate the Gateway in terms of how 
easy or difficult it was to use, three of the eight 
respondents marked “Don’t know/No basis to re-
spond.” Three of the remaining five rated it as 
difficult to some degree (Table 30).
Asked to rate the Gateway user screens for screen 
layout and design, menu design, and understand-
ability, the respondents generally graded them as 
“Good” to “Fair,” with three respondents either not 
answering or answering “Not sure” for each of the 
three items being evaluated. One of the libraries 
rated the menu design as “Excellent,” and none of 
the libraries chose “Poor” for any of the three items 
(Table 31).

Question C.26 asked, “If the ITIS Communication Gateway in its present form was made available 
as part of the regular ITIS service, would you or your colleagues use it?” One respondent marked 
“Yes, definitely,” and four of the eight were “Not sure.” Of the remaining three, one respondent 
marked “Maybe,” and two said “No, probably not” (Figure 20 and Appendix E, Question C.26). 
Comments received for this question included “Would like better documentation” and “Use here 
does not warrant it.” One respondent noted that “The up-to-dateness is not of sufficient importance 
to overcome inconvenience of two searches and new search language.” The full text of these 
comments is found in Appendix F, Question C.26.

When asked if “having access through the ITIS Gateway to other systems or databases (in addition 
to DIALOG files 103 and 104) would make you more likely to use it,” four of the eight respondents 
marked “Not sure,” and two said “No.” The two who said “Yes” specified “Any DIALOG or STN 
file” and “OCLC.” These comments are recorded in Appendix F, Question C.27.
The final question of this survey asked the libraries to provide other comments or suggestions 
concerning the Gateway. Five of the eight did so, and the full text of their comments is found in 
Appendix F, Question C.28. One respondent explained, “Have not had enough time or training to 
learn how to use it [ITIS Gateway] with proficiency,” and two explained why they had not had time 
to participate at the anticipated level. One of the two remaining comments explained the technical 
difficulties this respondent had experienced with the Gateway. The other noted that “Having access 
to the most current reports through ITIS is wonderful,” and suggested, “Should DOE go through with 
plans to produce a CD-ROM version of the Energy Database, it would be useful to have a way to 
merge records from the CD-ROM and ITIS.”
Final Project Evaluation Survey Results (End of Project Findings)
The third and final survey of Component I consisted of 22 questions. Questions were aimed at 
discovering changes that may have occurred in the libraries as a result of Component I, overall 
response to the various services and products involved, and overall response to this part of the Project 
as a whole. All 17 of the participating Depository Libraries responded to this survey.
Discussion of this survey is organized into four sections. The first paragraph of each section identifies 
questions from the survey instrument to which the section applies. A copy of the questionnaire, with 
results, is found in Appendix G. In addition, the individual responses to open-ended questions, 
explanations of responses, and libraries’ comments are found in Appendix H.
Library Use of DOE Information and Services
This section discusses Questions B. 1 through B.7 on the survey instrument. It begins by asking the 
libraries, “Based on your experience with the Pilot Project, how do you think the frequency with 
which your library patrons access your collection of DOE microfiche will be affected?” Ten libraries 
(58.82%) thought frequency would increase to some degree; but 6 of the remaining 17 anticipated 
no change, one marked “Don’t know” (Figure 21).
Libraries were asked if they experienced any increase or decrease in the number of STI requests as 
a result of the Pilot Project. Only 35.29% (6) said they had experienced an increase to some degree, 
while 58.82% (10) marked “Neither an increase nor a decrease” (Figure 22).
Fifteen libraries answered “Yes” when asked if the patrons they were able to serve with information 
from the DOE database were typical of their usual patrons. Seven libraries explained their “Yes” 
responses with comments such as the following:
Science is the subject area of our department.
Our typical users of energy information are faculty researchers or graduate students. Those patrons who used ITIS 
were from the above group, thus were used to the technical nature of the information.

One respondent qualified the Yes answer with “But very few.” Two libraries answered “No” to this 
question (Appendix G, Question B.3; Appendix H under Question B.3/B.4 for full text of comments).
Question B.5 asked the libraries to estimate what percentage of their usual, overall clientele they felt 
would have an ongoing need for DOE information. Fifteen (88.24%) chose the range “1 to 25%” as 
their estimate. Only one library chose a higher range, “26 to 50%,” and one library marked “Not sure.” 
One respondent, in explaining the choice of “1 to 25%” wrote, “Note that not all our patrons are 
interested in STI” (Appendix H, Question B.5).

Twelve respondents (70.58%) indicated that, at least to “Some extent,” regular access to ITIS and 
the Energy Science and Technology Database had been valuable to their library. One respondent, 
explaining a response of “Great extent” on the scale, wrote the comment “to Physics branch library” 
(Appendix H, Question B.6). The other 29.41% marked “Little or no extent” (Table 32).
Fourteen respondents (82.35%) said that, at least to “Some extent,” receiving DOE shared cataloging 
files would be valuable to their library, and half of these indicated the degree as “Very great extent.” 
One respondent, marking “Very great extent,” placed three stars beside the answer. Another 
commented, “If we had the resources to load (or access for free), value would be high.” A third 
respondent explained the choice of “Moderate extent” with, “If files could be successfully tape 
loaded onto local automated system” (Table 32 and Appendix H, Question B.7).

Library Use of DOE Shared Cataloging
This section covers Questions D.l 1 and D.12 of the survey instrument. Libraries were asked which 
method of receiving shared cataloging records they preferred. Twelve of the 17 libraries checked 
Receive magnetic tape.” Three indicated they would prefer to “Download from online source.” Two 
who marked Other method” specified, “CD-ROM with search software” and “Mount as database 
with OCLC’s first search” (Figure 23 and Appendix H, Question D.l 1).
Question D. 12 instructed the libraries to rate their satisfaction with DOE shared cataloging based on 
their overall experience. Four statements were then given to which libraries could agree (“Strongly” 
or “Somewhat”) or disagree (“Strongly” or “Somewhat”). They could also choose a neutral choice 
of “Not sure/Don’t know.”

that the overall quality of the product was satisfactory. Nine to three, they disagreed that the quality 
of the cataloging records was acceptable as it presently existed. Six to three, they disagreed that the 
method of obtaining the records was acceptable. Respondents did agree, six to four, with “This

be interested in subscribing to this product if it were made available,” five disagreed, while four 
agreed. For every statement, at least two libraries did not answer and others, sometimes five or six 
others, marked “Not sure/Don’t know” (Table 36).
Based on your overall experience, please rate your satisfaction with shared DOE cataloging.

Ten libraries (60%) provided explanations/comments of their answers.
Ten respondents provided comments on shared cataloging. Lack of personnel or funding to handle 
translation and loading of the electronic files into their library’s catalog/catalog software was 
mentioned four times. The fact that the records were MARC-like rather than true MARC format was 
mentioned three times, and file format problems were mentioned three times.
One library explained it had spent over 100 hours to get one shared cataloging file uploaded into their 
online catalog and went on to list the three major problems they encountered. This library said it 
would like to see the DOE cataloging records made available through OCLC. Read the full text of 
these comments in Appendix H under Question D.12.
Library Use of the ITIS Communication Gateway
This section covers the responses to Questions E. 13 through E.20 on the survey instrument. Because 
nine libraries indicated they had never used the Gateway at any time during the Pilot Project, only 
eight were eligible to answer this set of questions. Of these eight, two libraries said they had used the 
Gateway “One time”; four had used it “2 to 5 times”; and only two libraries had used it “11 or more 
times” (Appendix G, Question E.13).
Table 37 shows the capabilities that were used, and Table 38 shows how the eight libraries rated five 
features of the Gateway. Two choices on the scale were “Not sure” and “Didn’t use.” Excluding the 
respondents who marked these choices, three of the Gateway features were rated “Good” by the

One library found the ITIS Gateway overall to be “Very easy” to use, and three marked that it was 
“Somewhat easy.” Another three marked “Somewhat difficult,” and the eighth respondent marked 
“Don’t know/No basis to respond” (Table 39).
The Gateway was designed to allow database searching on both ITIS and DIALOG so that the results 
files of current and retrospective energy information could be merged. Question E. 17 asked, “Which 
retrieval software are you more comfortable using, ITIS or DIALOG?” Seven of the eight 
respondents indicated they were more comfortable using DIALOG’S retrieval software. In explain-
ing their answer of DIALOG, all but two of the seven referred in some way to the fact that they had 
more experience and, therefore, more familiarity with that retrieval software. The remaining library 
marked Both equal” (Appendix G, Question E. 17). The full text of respondents’ comments is found 
in Appendix H under Question E.17.
Question E. 18 asked, “Are the citations on DIALOG current enough for your needs?” Five of the 
eight libraries replied “Yes.” One said “No,” explaining that:
Microfiche is received and available long before records appear in DIALOG. Faculty are often aware of current 
research and want access as quickly as possible.

One library chose “Not always” as a response and explained, “but only because many users want 
information the same day the information was released.” The remaining library checked “NA” 
(Appendix G, Question E.18 and Appendix H, Question E.18).
The survey also asked if the libraries had used the OneSearch capability on DIALOG to search other 
files at the same time they searched the Energy Science and Technology Database. As Table 40 
shows, more libraries said “No” than “Yes.”
The final question in the Gateway portion of the questionnaire was, “How important is it to you to 
be able to search multiple files using a single search strategy?” Seven libraries responded within the 
range of “Some importance” to “Great importance.” Only one library answered “Little or no 
importance” (Table 41).

Component I
Summary—Component I
Seventeen Depository Libraries were selected to participate in Component I of the Pilot Project. 
These were libraries that were receiving DOE microfiche, had online catalogs, and had indicated 
their interest in participating and their ability to commit the necessary staff and budget resources.
Component I gave the participating libraries expanded and enhanced access to DOE scientific and 
technical information. To accomplish this, user accounts for the libraries were established on 
the Integrated Technical Information System (ITIS), a system primarily serving DOE and major 
DOE contractors. Through ITIS, the libraries were able to search the most current window of the 
Energy Science and Technology Database, obtain shared cataloging records, and utilize the ITIS 
Gateway to merge current records from ITIS with older records from the retrospective database on 
DIALOG.
OSTI completed work on the shared cataloging product and on the ITIS Gateway to make them 
available for beta testing during the Pilot Project. Training on the system, including these test 
modules, was given for representatives from the libraries in January 1991. The six-month Compo-
nent I time frame for ITIS access ran from February 1, 1991, through July 31, 1991. Only 16 of the 
libraries utilized their ITIS accounts; the 17th library worked with the shared cataloging records, 
which were also distributed on magnetic tape, but did not use ITIS.
The 16 libraries logged a total of264.05 online hours on ITIS during Component I of the Pilot Project. 
For tracking and costing purposes, this overall system usage was subdivided into four categories or 
types of usage. Two of these, database usage and usage of the ITIS electronic mail and system 
utilities, were characterized as “billed” usage and charged at the rate of $16.00, which was about 
half the normal rate charged to the DOE audience. GPO subsidized the first two months of billed 
usage, and then the libraries themselves paid for their billed usage during the last four months. 
Libraries also paid $0.25 per record, regardless of format or length, for all records downloaded or 
printed from the database. The “non-billed” usage was that provided by DOE at no cost to GPO or 
Project participants. DOE subsidized usage of the shared cataloging module on ITIS, the shared 
cataloging records, the ITIS Gateway, and records printed or downloaded through the Gateway 
options.
The total dollar value of the 264.05 online hours logged on ITIS was $4,224.77. Of this total, GPO 
subsidized 56.59 online hours for $905.45; the libraries paid $777.60 for 48.60 online hours; and 
DOE subsidized 158.86 online hours for a value of $2,541.72.
Component I objectives are listed in full in the body of this report. To briefly summarize, they 
included discovering the extent of usage for DOE technical reports on microfiche, determining 
factors contributing to the use or non-use of that collection, determining the feasibility and 
desirability of providing electronic cataloging for the DOE microfiche in a format suitable for 
uploading into libraries’ online catalogs, encouraging the use of the Energy Science and Technology 
Database as a “pointer” to the DOE fiche, exploring the feasibility of replacing paper indexes with 
online access, and testing the ITIS Gateway as a tool for merging DOE’s energy information on 
DIALOG with the latest energy information on ITIS and as a tool for customizing the results into 
various report formats and sorts.

Component I
To gather information related to these objectives, three surveys were conducted during and 
immediately following Component I. The first survey instrument, entitled “Depository Library Use 
of DOE Microfiche,” was designed to discover the normal practices of the libraries for handling the 
DOE microfiche, microfiche in general, and users’ requests for scientific and technical information 
(STI). Because this survey was intended to establish baseline information, libraries were instructed 
to respond to the questions based on their operation prior to the beginning of the Pilot Project. Sixteen 
libraries responded to this survey.
The second survey instrument, entitled “Technical Evaluation Survey,” was designed to evaluate the 
libraries’ experiences at the mid-project point with ITIS, the Energy Science and Technology 
Database, shared cataloging, and the Gateway. Sixteen libraries also participated in this survey.
The third and final survey instrument, entitled “Final Project Evaluation,” aimed at discovering 
changes that may have occurred in the libraries as a result of Component I, overall response to the 
various services and products involved, and overall response to this part of the Pilot Project as a 
whole. All 17 libraries involved in Component I responded to this survey.
In the baseline survey, the libraries’ collections of DOE microfiche were characterized as “very 
accessible by 75% of the 16 responding libraries. However, 13 libraries were not cataloging their 
DOE fiche collection prior to the Pilot Project, citing not enough staff, not enough time, expense, and 
not enough demand for this microfiche to justify the time/expense as common reasons. Of the three 
that were cataloging their DOE fiche, two were merging them with the cataloging for other 
collections.
Nine libraries (56.25%) reported that they received 16 or more STI requests from their patrons in a 
typical week. Two of these libraries estimated that they received 150 or more requests. The weekly 
frequencies indicating how often library staff and patrons accessed the DOE microfiche collection 
were, on the whole, however, lower than the numbers indicating the frequency with which STI 
requests were received. Only one library reported accessing the DOE fiche more than 15 times per 
week, whereas 14 libraries (87.50%) estimated they accessed those fiche 15 times or less per week.
The baseline survey listed 14 reference sources that could possibly be used to find information 
concerning the STI requests that are received. Respondents were asked to rate how often they 
searched these sources and then how often these sources led them or their patrons to the DOE 
microfiche. Thirteen libraries for Energy Research Abstracts and eleven for DOE Energy on 
DIALOG said these sources “Always/Almost always” or “Often” led them or their patrons to the 
DOE microfiche collection. However, when asked how often they searched these sources to answer 
STI requests, 9 said only “Sometimes” for ERA and only 5 said “Always” to “Often.” For DOE 
Energy on DIALOG, 10 said they “Sometimes” searched it, but only 1 library said they “Often” 
searched it, and no one marked “Always/Almost always.”
This survey also showed that more than half of the libraries were used to receiving catalog records 
for other, non-microfiche formats on magnetic tape, and half were used to obtaining catalog records 
by downloading from an online source.
The shared cataloging records were made available to the libraries during Component I both through 
the online delivery mechanism on ITIS and on magnetic tape. All through the project and at the end, 
51


Accessing USDOE Scientific and Technical Information
Component I
the libraries provided ratings and comments that reflected the problems they experienced with this 
product. The time required to download the file from ITIS was not acceptable to the majority of those 
who provided feedback at mid-project point. The amount of programming required to enable the 
electronic file to upload to the libraries’ online catalogs exceeded the planned staff support and 
budget for several libraries and remained an item that received lengthy comment throughout 
Component I. Another problem was the attempt to merge the MARC-like records provided by OSTI 
with true MARC records already in the libraries’ catalogs. As a result of these problems, libraries 
disagreed eight to four and nine to three with the statements, “Overall quality of this product is 
satisfactory” and “Quality of the cataloging records is acceptable as it presently exists.”
Even so, the libraries continued to indicate their interest in being able to provide cataloging of some kind 
for their DOE microfiche. Ratings for “This product meets our microfiche cataloging needs” swung back 
toward agreement, and the libraries disagreed only five to four with “Our organization would be interested 
in subscribing to this product if it were made.” Note that other respondents either did not answer or 
answered Not sure/Don t know when rating shared cataloging and were counted as neutral for the 
purposes of this discussion. However, 14 of the 17 respondents said that receiving DOE shared cataloging 
would be valuable to their libraries at least to some extent, with half of those choosing “Very great extent” 
as the degree. One respondent marking “Very great extent” placed three stars beside the answer. Another 
commented, “If we had the resources to load (or access for free), value would be high”
Comments received at the end of the project continued, as noted above, to describe the problems with 
shared cataloging, but also touched on the desire to provide cataloging for microfiche. One 
respondent wrote:
Most of our patrons expect to find energy related material using our public access catalog. We have GPO cataloging 
and most assume that DOE material is included. Having the DOE cataloging in PAC would vastly increase the use 
of the Energy material and make it available to a large cross section of our patrons. For this reason, the Shared 
Cataloging is the most important part of the Pilot Project.
The ITIS Gateway attracted only 8 of the 16 libraries enough to get them to use it, and even that usage 
was very low. This fact alone says something about its perceived utility. The eight respondents 
indicated they were more comfortable with DIALOG than with ITIS, primarily because of their 
longer experience with and, therefore, familiarity with that system. Five of the eight said the citations 
on DIALOG were current enough for their needs.
One objective of Component I was to encourage the libraries to become more familiar with DOE’s 
information in the Energy Science and Technology Database. Fifteen libraries estimated that “1 to 
25 %” of their usual, overall clientele had an ongoing need for DOE information. Access to ITIS and 
the database was rated valuable, at least to some extent, by 47.06%, and another 25.52% said 
“Moderate” or “Great extent.” Ten rated its usefulness to their purposes with the top three values on 
the rating scale: “Extremely useful,” “Very useful,” or “Moderately useful.”
Forty-one percent of the libraries said that, based on their experience with the Pilot Project, they 
thought their patrons would access the DOE microfiche collection “Somewhat more frequently,” and 
another eighteen percent said “Much more frequently.”
On both the second and third survey instruments, respondents took a great deal of time and trouble 
to write lengthy, detailed comments about their shared cataloging experiences. This was some of 
52


Accessing USDOE Scientific and Technical Information
Component I
the most helpful information collected, and the full text of their comments should be read in 
Appendixes F, H, and J. For instance, the very last question of this third survey, Question F.22, asked, 
“Do you have any other comments concerning your participation in the Pilot Project?” One 
respondent commented on OSAM, the menu-driven user interface that OSTI had provided with the 
database for any who wished to use it:
Also, OSAM version of ITIS was great for our purposes. It would be great as the front-end search software that all 
libraries use if you decide to make ITIS available to depository libraries.
When shared cataloging was mentioned in these final comments, the problems noted before came 
up again, but so did mention of the desire to have this cataloging for the DOE microfiche collection. 
One respondent said that only one tape of shared cataloging had been loaded into the online catalog 
by the time this questionnaire was being answered; another said, . inability to load tapes prevented 
serious study of adequacy of shared catalog product.” Others commented on the need for a real 
MARC format and the need for corrections to the file format so that records could be uploaded more 
easily. One respondent wrote, “. . . if records for DOE reports could be merged into our general 
catalog, a significant jump in usage would be seen.”
Another explained:
Most of our patrons expect to find energy related material using our public access catalog. We have GPO cataloging 
and most assume that DOE material is included. Having the DOE cataloging in PAC would vastly increase the use 
of the Energy material and make it available to a large cross section of our patrons. For this reason the Shared 
Cataloging is the most important part of the Pilot Project. While it took far longer than I would have preferred, we 
were able to load the records. Since working out the problems is what pilot projects are all about, I feel the Shared 
Cataloging project to be a success. I strongly urge that distribution of the DOE cataloging records to depository 
libraries be offered in the very near future.
Two respondents mentioned CD-ROM as a medium in which they had interest:
Investigation of ITIS was valuable and instructive, as was introduction to DOE indexing and document distribution. 
Lack of funding and systems staff was our major difficulty. Having full-text documents available on line or in CD- 
ROM form would be a convenient and cost-saving method for us.
CD-ROM is probably more appropriate to our needs. Adding records to the catalog could become prohibitively 
expensive in terms of mass storage.
One library s comments on Component I of the Pilot Project were divided into “positives” and 
negatives,” providing an excellent overall summary of their experience:
Positives Very helpful information about contents of DOE microfiche; Familiarization with OSTI, extremely 
interesting and beneficial; associations with OSTI personnel; very gratifying experience; Associations with other 
documents librarians from several states; Opportunity to participate in pilot and go through training program—a very 
well-planned project with many benefits for a more research-oriented institution; a well-planned training program 
with good personnel and resources.
Negatives Expensive for the library and institution for benefit received academically; Not really a beneficial 
program for a small liberal arts university; Lack of MARC format for records impossible to use; Lack of a load program 
to use with NOTIS system for cataloging records.
The comments received in this final survey provide excellent information and should be read in full 
in Appendixes H and J.

Component II
COMPONENT II: ALTERNATIVE MEDIA FOR FULL-TEXT DELIVERY
While Component I was specifically related to the use of DOE information, the second part of the 
Pilot Project took a broader view of the issues involved with disseminating and using full text. Most 
full-text information is not currently available in electronic format. Rather, this information is 
primarily accessed via such mechanisms as bibliographic databases and printed or online catalogs. 
Information users are directed to the full-text information through these mechanisms, but in most 
cases must manually scan the desired information on paper or microfiche.
While they are becoming more prevalent, even online full-text databases do not offer a definitive 
solution to the problem of searching and accessing the information they contain. Unlike biblio-
graphic databases, full-text databases are not inherently structured in a way that makes them easily 
searchable. For text to be retrieved effectively from these databases, it must be marked in such a way 
that the search and retrieval software can recognize and extract appropriate sections in the proper 
context. Although standards such as the Standard Generalized Markup Language (SGML) and 
Computer-aided Acquisition and Logistics Support (CALS) that will provide consistent ways of 
marking text for this purpose are evolving, it will be several more years until they are fully developed 
particularly for STL
The demand for better access to full-text information, however, is immediate and increasing. 
Component II of the Pilot Project addressed the specific needs and concerns related to the acquisition 
and use of full text by the Depository Library community. This component was developed to 
determine the feasibility of distributing full-text DOE technical reports to Depository Libraries in 
some medium or media other than microfiche. A survey covering technological, economic, and other 
issues associated with the various electronic delivery options was delivered to all Depository 
Libraries, and responses were received from 1,064 libraries. Also included in this component is an 
assessment of alternative media technology and its use.
Objectives
The objectives of Component II were to determine the following:
• Capabilities and technologies existing at the Depository Libraries for receipt of full-text scientific 
and technical information (STI) in electronic format;
• Usability of full-text information in electronic format;
• Optimum medium for presenting DOE research and development (R&D) results in full-text formats;
• Need for DOE R&D results in the full-text format;
Information which can be used by GPO and DOE to make decisions concerning future dissemi-
nation mechanisms;
• Usefulness of DOE information to the Depository Library user communities;
Criticality of full-text information to the Depository Libraries or sufficiency of bibliographic 
information;
Future, new, and existing technologies suitable for disseminating the full text of DOE STI reports.

Component II
Depository Library Use of Alternative Media for 
Full-Text Dissemination Survey Results
A two-part survey was used to collect data about the use of full-text information by Depository 
Libraries. The first part examined the current use of full-text information on microfiche; the second 
part addressed current and planned library technical capabilities for accessing full text in a variety 
of formats. The survey instrument, which included both closed-ended and open-ended questions, 
was developed in consultation with GPO and the General Accounting Office (GAO). GAO also 
served as a technical advisor for the data collection and analysis processes.
The survey was distributed to the 1,398 Depository Libraries on July 9, 1991, with responses 
requested by July 17, 1991. A total of 1,064 libraries responded, for a response rate of 76%.
Analysis of the data included examination of the total frequency of responses to each survey question, 
as well as (for selected questions) analysis of those responses provided by libraries which receive 
DOE full-text technical reports on microfiche compared with other libraries. Cross-tabulations 
between questions were performed where it seemed appropriate.
The data was analyzed using PC SAS®, Lotus 1-2-3®, FoxPro®, and StatGraphics® software. Several 
graphics software packages were used to generate charts. The survey form and data are contained in 
Appendixes K, L, and M.
Profile of Participating Libraries
To assist GPO and DOE in ascertaining the population of responding libraries currently being served by 
DOE full-text information, the libraries were asked whether they currently receive DOE technical reports 
in microfiche form. As shown in Table 42, of the 1,047 libraries responding to this question, 421 (40.21 %) 
reported that they received all or some of these reports. Of the remaining libraries, 
607 (57.98%) stated that they do not receive DOE microfiche, and an additional 19 libraries (1.81%) did 
not know whether they received DOE microfiche (Appendix K, Question 1.6). Where appropriate, survey 
results for this component have been stratified into two groups based on responses to this question: (1) 
libraries stating that they did receive all or selected DOE reports (“Libraries Receiving DOE Full-Text 
Reports’’) and (2) “All Other Libraries.” Note that the number of libraries which stated that they receive 
DOE full-text reports is greater than the number of library microfiche profiles maintained by OSTI; 
however, no attempt was made to correlate the microfiche profiles with the responses to this question.
*
*At the time that the Pilot Project was initiated, OSTI distributed microfiche on an ongoing subscription basis to 255 Depository Libraries electing 
to receive all or selected DOE technical reports. Currently, OSTI maintains standing microfiche profiles for approximately 225 Depository Libraries. 
However, DOE microfiche are also available from the National Technical Information Service (NTIS), from various commercial vendors, and may 
be individually purchased from OSTI. In addition, DOE microfiche may be acquired through interlibrary loan or shared among several libraries 
belonging to the same institution or university. Therefore, the number of Depository Libraries actually receiving or acquiring DOE technical reports 
on microfiche is not limited to those for which OSTI maintains profiles.
Types of Libraries
As shown in Figure 24, over half of the total libraries (54.97%) responding to this question were academic 
libraries. The next largest group was public libraries (23.42%) (see Table 43). More libraries receiving 
DOE technical reports were academic libraries (68.44% of the 358 responding in this group) than libraries 
in the “All others” group (47.41% of the 637 responding in this group) (Appendix K, Question 1.2).

Libraries Holding DOE Contracts
Of all the libraries responding to a question concerning whether their institution holds a DOE 
research and development (R&D) contract, 76 libraries (7.87%) stated that they do hold such a 
contract, as shown in Table 44 (see Question 1.5, Appendix K). Of the libraries receiving all or 
selected DOE reports on microfiche, 16.96% percent held a DOE R&D contract compared with 
.0158% of all other libraries. Over a third of all libraries responding to this question did not know 
whether their institution holds a DOE R&D contract.
If your library is affiliated with a large institution or organization, does that organization/institution 
currently have a U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) research and development contract in place?

Library Budgets for Materials and Equipment Acquisition
Question 1.4 parts a and b asked the libraries to specify the dollar amounts and percentage of their total 
budget which was available for material and equipment acquisitions (Appendix K, Question 1.4). Both 
median and average values were calculated for these dollars amounts and percentages.
Table 45 shows that an average of $834,863.79 was available for acquisition of materials. However, the 
median value for material acquisitions, $350,000.00, may be a more accurate measure of the actual budget 
amount available to a typical library. The average and median budget percentages for material acquisitions 
calculated for the libraries were closer to one another, at 33.47% (average) and 31% (median).
Average and median library budget dollar amounts and percentages for equipment acquisitions are 
reported in Table 46. Again, the wide gap between the high and low values reported by the libraries may 
make the median dollar amount ($20,000.00) a more accurate gauge of the typical library’s budget 
allocation for equipment.
How much of the library’s budget is available for 
material acquisitions?

It is apparent from the information collected in this question that the community of Depository 
Libraries varies widely in terms of the libraries’ relative abilities to purchase new equipment and 
materials. Any decisions concerning technologies used for dissemination of full-text information 
must therefore take into consideration that negligible funds are available to some libraries for 
materials or equipment to accommodate new media/technologies.
Microfiche Storage and Access
In answer to a question concerning where 
DOE microfiche are physically located, 84.5% 
of libraries responding indicated that the 
microfiche are located in the main library 
(see Table 47). Note that only libraries stating 
that they received all or selected DOE micro-
fiche were eligible to respond to this question 
(Appendix K, Question 1.7).
As shown in Table 48, over half (67.89%) of the 
libraries responding to Question 1.9 indicated 
that they maintain more than the required five

Of the libraries which indicated that they do maintain depository microfiche longer than the required 
5 years, 635 provided a response indicating how long it is maintained. Approximately 36% (233 of 
the 635 libraries) stated that they maintain all years of microfiche received for all or selected items. 
Another 17.48% (111 libraries) stated that the number of years that depository microfiche are 
maintained depends on the subject or title of the microfiche. Other responses given by more than 10% 
of these libraries were (1) microfiche are maintained for 10 to 15 years (by 87 libraries, or 13.7%) 
and (2) the number of years varies, reason not specified (by 79 libraries, or 12.44%). Frequencies and 
percentages of these responses are given in Appendix L, Question 1.9.a.
Filing Systems for Microfiche and Paper
When asked to list all the filing systems they use for microfiche, over 90% of the libraries responding 
to this question indicated that they use Dewey Decimal, SuDocs, or some other classification system,

Difficulties in Accessing Full Text on Microfiche
As shown in Table 51, significant difficulties in accessing full-text information on microfiche were 
reported by approximately 45% of libraries responding to Question 1.14. Libraries receiving DOE 
reports were slightly more likely to report significant problems in accessing full text on microfiche 
than were all other libraries (50.24% vs. 41.63%). The nature of the access difficulties experienced 
by these libraries is shown in Table 52. The most frequently cited problem (by 89.13% of libraries

responding to Question 1.15) was that patrons dislike the microfiche format. Almost half (49.57%) 
of these libraries reported that patrons aren’t aware of the availability of information on microfiche. 
41.52% stated that patrons have difficulty locating the information on microfiche (Appendix K, 
Question 1.15). The 20.43% of these libraries checking “Other” were asked to describe the nature of 
the other access difficulties experienced. Poor quality of the microfiche itself was listed by 27 
libraries, followed by inadequate/poor quality indexing (11 libraries). Eighteen other access 
difficulties were listed by one or more libraries (Appendix L, Question I.15.i).
To determine whether a relationship exists between the frequency of patrons’ requests for STI and 
significant difficulties to librarians or patrons in effectively accessing full-text information on 
microfiche, a cross-tabulation of the results for Questions 1.11 and 1.14 was performed. The cross-
tabulation was limited to the libraries providing valid responses to both questions, and percentages 
shown in Table 53 are based on these 869 libraries. The responses to Question 1.11, which asked 
libraries how frequently patrons requested STI, were grouped according to whether patrons made 
requests (1) more frequently than once a month or (2) once a month or less. Based on this cross-
tabulation, there does appear to be a relationship between the frequency with which requests for STI 
are received and whether significant access difficulties are experienced. The majority of libraries— 
264 of 444 (59.46%)—indicating that they receive requests for STI more than once a month also 
reported experiencing significant difficulties in accessing information on microfiche. In contrast, the 
majority of libraries—274 of 425 (64.47%)—receiving requests for STI once a month or less report 
they do not experience difficulties in accessing microfiche.

Libraries receiving requests for STI within the past 6 months were asked to estimate the percentage of the 
time that patrons requested specific time periods for the information (Appendix K, Question 1.12). Both 
average and median values were calculated for (1) the percent of the time that requesters specified a time 
period and (2) the percent of the time that requesters did not specify a time period. By the average value 
calculation, libraries reported that patrons requested a specific time period 43.89% of the time and did not 
specify a time period 56.11% of the time.
Libraries that had received requests for STI within the past 6 months for which patrons had requested 
specific times periods were further asked to identify what time periods were specified and how often 
they were requested (Appendix K, Question 1.12). Table 55 shows how often each of the following 
time periods was requested: information less than 1 year old, information published within the past 
1 to 5 years, information published with the past 6 to 10 years, and information over 10 years old. 
Figure 25 shows the relative frequency with which each time period was requested by patrons.
To determine if requests for STI were more frequent at libraries receiving DOE reports on microfiche, 
a cross-tabulation of the results for Question 1.11 (dealing with frequency of requests of STI) and 
Question 1.6 (dealing with whether libraries receive DOE microfiche) was performed. The cross-
tabulation was limited to the libraries providing valid responses to both questions, and percentages 
shown in Table 56 are based on these 868 libraries. A relationship between frequency of requests for 
STI and receipt of DOE reports does appear to exist. For instance, daily requests for STI were 
received by 31.59% (115 of 364) of the libraries which receive DOE microfiche, compared with

Library Use of Optical and Compact Discs
Question II.3 asked libraries to indicate how they currently use optical disc and compact disc technologies 
for storing and retrieving all types of data and information used (Appendix K, Question II.3). Over 85% 
of the libraries responding to this question indicated that they don’t currently own or use optical discs for

any purpose, as shown in Table 58. (Note that 558 libraries did not respond to the part of the question 
concerning use of optical discs.) More libraries receiving DOE technical reports used optical discs in some 
capacity (41 of 202 libraries responding or 20.3%) than did all other libraries (31 of 304 libraries 
responding or 10.2%). Use of optical discs for search and retrieval of information was reported by 8.88% 
of all libraries.

In contrast, Table 59 shows that over 90% of all libraries responding to this question indicated that 
they do use compact disc technology in some capacity (872 libraries or 90.83%). The most frequently 
listed use for compact discs was for search and retrieval of information, as shown in Table 59. Again,

a higher percentage of libraries receiving DOE technical reports on microfiche used compact discs 
(96.28% or 363 libraries of377 responding) than did all other libraries (87.31 % or 509 of583 libraries 
responding).
In Question II.4, the libraries were asked to indicate how they planned to use optical and compact 
disc technologies in the next three years. Over 68% of all libraries responding to this question 
indicated that they do not plan to own or use optical discs in that time period (Table 60). 
Approximately 14% of all libraries responding to this question stated that they planned to use optical 
discs for both archival storage and search and retrieval of information. (Note that 597 libraries did 
not respond to this part of the question—see Appendix K, Question II.4.)
Planned usage of compact discs was reported by 97.36% of all libraries responding to Question II.4 
(887 of 911 responding libraries). Approximately 71% of all libraries responding planned to use 
compact discs for both archival storage and search and retrieval of information, with another 25% 
planning to use compact discs for some other purpose than those listed in the question, as shown in 
Table 61. Reported “Other” responses are contained in Appendix L, under Question II.4.d—Other.

Question II.5 asked the libraries to indicate all types of compact disc (CD) equipment currently 
owned or accessed. As shown in Table 62, the three most frequently given responses were 
(1) multiple CD workstations in a stand-alone mode (listed by 56.62% of libraries responding), 
(2) a single CD workstation not on a local area network (LAN) (listed by 40.88% of responding 
libraries), and (3) a CD jukebox or disc tower, not on a LAN (listed by 13.82% of responding 
libraries) (Appendix K, Question II.5.). It is interesting that only about 23% of those responding 
stated that they had any CD equipment on any type of network. (See Appendix L, Question IL5 .g 
for other types of CD equipment specified by the libraries.)

that they use a workstation with a modem to access remote computers (e.g., dial in to DIALOG) as 
shown in Table 64 (Appendix K, Question IL7). The next most frequently given response (by 237 
libraries or 37.44%) was workstations connected to a mainframe computer.
Question II.8 asked the libraries to indicate whether they currently had, or planned to have within 
three years, access to one or more of several listed network services, including TYMNET, Internet, 
CompuServe, etc. These networks, some commercial and some government-operated, provide 
access to remote databases, electronic mail, bulletin boards, and other services. Over 56% of the 
libraries stated that they had or would have access to TYMNET, with approximately 45% reporting 
access to Internet and BITNET (Table 65).
In addition, 181 libraries reported that they used one or more “Other” networks. Sprintnet (formerly 
called Telenet) was the “Other” network most frequently cited (by 59 libraries), followed by 
OCLC/EPIC (28 libraries), Dialnet (22 libraries), and DIALOG (18 libraries). Seventy-four other 
networks were listed by one or more libraries, for a total of 248 responses (Appendix L, 
Question II.8.h).
Further analysis of the other networks listed by these libraries revealed that they fell into one of five 
categories: (1) network access systems, such as Dialnet and Sprintnet; (2) commercial bibliographic 
systems, such as DIALOG and OCLC; (3) local or statewide networks, such as FIRN and Huskernet;

categories. For the purpose of this analysis, a “consortium” is defined as a subject-specific network 
(e.g., law or medicine related) or a regional, non-commercial network that encompasses more than 
a single state. The libraries’ responses were then retabulated to determine whether they had listed one 
or more networks within a given category.

The second part of Question II.9 asked the libraries to specify the methods they planned to use to 
acquire full text in the next three years. In tabulating the responses to this question, it was assumed 
that the libraries currently using a given method would continue to use it during the next three years, 
and that the “plan to use” responses given to this question represented libraries which planned to use 
that method but did not currently do so. As Table 68 demonstrates, more libraries planned to add the 
use of compact discs during the next three years than any other method listed (182 libraries or 44.28% 
of those planning to add the use of media). Other methods planned to be used by 100 or more libraries 
were downloading information from internal hosts (by 133 libraries or 32.36%) and downloading 
from remote, time-sharing databases (109 libraries or 26.52%). Note that relatively few libraries 
responded to this part of the question.
Factors in Selecting a Storage/Access Medium and User Interface for Full Text
Question II. 10 asked the libraries to rate the importance of a number of factors in selecting a storage/ 
access medium for full-text information. The factor rated by the largest number of libraries as being 
of “Very great” or “Great” importance was ease of retrieval of information (by 947 libraries, or 
91.68% of those rating this factor). Purchase cost was the second most important factor in terms of

the percentage of libraries rating it as being of “Very great” or “Great” importance (by 945 libraries, 
or 90.95% of those rating this factor). The third most important factor was update or subscription 
costs (rated as being of at least “Great” importance by 914 libraries, or 88.05% of those rating this 
factor) (Table 69). Thus, two of the three most important factors to libraries in selecting a storage/ 
access medium for full-text information were related to costs of the medium. All of the listed factors 
received ratings of at least “Great” importance by 50% or more of the libraries rating that factor. (Note 
that although 100% of the libraries listing an “Other” factor ranked the specified factor as being of 
at least “Great” importance, only 32 libraries stated that some “Other” factor was of importance to 
them.) (Responses are listed in Appendix L, Question Il.lO.i.)
In the general comments provided by libraries in Questions 1.16 and II. 13, several libraries remarked 
that storage space required for various media and and/or any required new equipment was a concern. 
Nine libraries indicated that microfiche takes less storage space than paper and is a space-saving 
medium; seven libraries said that they have limited storage space for full text in paper or microform; 
and five libraries stated that they will use more full text on electronic and optical media due to storage 
limitations. Tabulations of comments related to storage space are contained in Appendix M 
(Questions 1.16 and 11.13).
Factors in selecting a user interface for searching, retrieving, and manipulating full-text 
information were rated in Question II. 11 (Appendix K). Eight different factors were listed in the 
question; in addition, libraries were asked to identify any other factors they thought important. 
(These additional factors specified by the libraries along with their assigned ratings are listed in 
Appendix L, Question II. 11.1.) Easy search and retrieval of information was the factor receiving the 
highest percentage of ratings of at least “Great” importance (by 965 libraries, or 93.6% of those rating 
this factor), as shown in Table 70.

Interestingly, the two factors receiving the highest percentage of “Very great” or “Great” importance 
ratings were related to the user-friendliness of the interface. Of the general comments related to 
dissemination of full text provided by the libraries (see Appendix M, “Comments Related to User- 
Friendliness of Technology for Full-Text Dissemination,” Questions 1.16 and 11.13), 20 comments 
were specifically related to the user-friendliness of technology/media used for full-text dissemina-
tion. Several of these comments urged government agencies to ensure that any interface provided 
with full-text information be as user friendly as possible.
The average overall importance of each factor in selection of a user interface for full-text information 
listed in Question II. 11 was calculated by assigning a value of 4 to “Very great importance” 
responses, a value of 3 to “Great importance” responses, a value of 2 to “Moderate importance” 
responses, and a value of 1 to “Some importance” responses. “Little or no importance” and “Not 
applicable” responses were excluded from this analysis so that the averages would include responses 
only from those libraries attaching some importance to a given factor. Table 71 shows the average 
overall importance of each factor to libraries receiving DOE reports on microfiche, all other libraries, 
and all libraries providing an importance rating for each factor listed.
Libraries receiving DOE reports on microfiche assigned a slightly higher average importance to 
factors related to supporting multiple numbers and types of users, standardization and completeness 
of information, and easy search and retrieval of information than did other libraries.

Preferred Environments and Media for Receiving and Accessing Full-Text Information
Two questions on this survey asked libraries to specify their preferences for media and/or 
environments used to receive or access full-text information. It should be noted that the issues of 
receiving and accessing full text are different, but both are discussed in this section to illustrate the 
extent to which libraries’ preferences are tied to the various media.
Library Preferences for Receiving DOE Technical Reports
Question 1.8 asked the libraries which receive DOE full-text reports on microfiche to indicate the 
extent to which they preferred to receive DOE technical reports in a medium or media other than 
microfiche (Appendix K). Of the media/sources listed, compact discs received the highest percent-
age of “Very greatly prefer” responses (25.58%) as shown in Table 72. In addition, 51.39% of 
libraries rating this medium indicated that they would “Greatly prefer” it to microfiche. Paper was 
the next most preferred medium to microfiche, rated as at least “Greatly preferred” to microfiche by 
25.38% of libraries rating this medium. Only 10.83% of the libraries rating compact discs stated that 
they “Do not prefer” this medium. Figure 27 represents the proportionate preferences of libraries 
providing a rating for each medium.
Library Preferences for Accessing Full Text in General
The final question of the survey asked libraries to indicate, all considerations of cost and planned 
acquisition aside, which media and environments they preferred to access full-text information. 
(Appendix K, Question 11.12). The first section of the question, which dealt with preferences for 
electronic and nonelectronic environments, listed various types of computers and systems that could 
be used as a platform for accessing full-text information (Table 73). The two environments receiving 
the highest percentages of “Very greatly prefer” and “Greatly prefer” ratings were stand-alone 
personal computers (61.25% of libraries rating this item) and personal computers on a local area 
network (53.50% of libraries rating this item). The environment receiving the highest percentage of 
“Do not prefer” ratings was mainframe/minicomputer (16.14% of libraries rating this item). The 
nonelectronic environment received a rating of at least “Greatly prefer” from 32.94% of the libraries 
providing a rating, with 10.36% of these libraries indicating that they “Do not prefer” this 
environment for accessing full text.
Of the media the libraries were asked to rate in this question, optical discs were the least preferred 
medium, as shown in Table 73. Only 10.78% of libraries rating this medium indicated that they “Very 
greatly” or “Greatly” preferred it, with 36.34% stating that they “Do not prefer” optical discs for 
accessing full text. Compact discs, on the other hand, were the most preferred medium (72.89% of 
the libraries rated this medium as “Very greatly” or “Greatly” preferred). Paper was at least “Greatly” 
preferred by 53.94% of the libraries providing a rating and was not preferred by only 1.89% of these 
libraries. Most of the ratings for floppy disks and microfiche fell in the “Moderately prefer” to 
“Somewhat prefer” categories. Other preferred media specified by the libraries are listed in 
Appendix L, Question II. 12.1. Figure 28 represents the proportionate preferences of all libraries 
providing a rating for each medium.
Average preferences were calculated for each environment and medium by assigning a value of “4” 
to “Very greatly prefer” responses, a “3” to “Greatly prefer” responses, a “2” to “Moderately prefer” 
responses, and a “1” to “Somewhat prefer” responses. “Do not prefer” and “Don’t know” responses

were excluded from this calculation as these ratings do not indicate an actual level of preference for 
a given medium. Table 74 presents these average preferences for libraries which receive DOE full-
text reports, all other libraries, and for all libraries indicating some level of preference for an 
environment or medium.
The electronic environment which received the highest rating by this method was stand-alone 
personal computers, which had an average preference value of 2.96 (approximating a rating of 
“Greatly prefer”). Personal computers on a local area network received the next highest average 
preference rating. A nonelectronic environment received an average preference rating of 2.58 
(midway between “Greatly prefer” and “Moderately prefer”).
Of the media rated by this method, the “Other” media specified by libraries received the highest rating 
(3.57, midway between “Very greatly” and “Greatly prefer”). However, note that only 17 libraries 
actually specified a preferred “Other” medium. Compact discs received the next highest average 
preference rating of 3.09 (just above “Greatly prefer”). Microfiche/microform and floppy disks each 
received an average preference rating of 2.12, which was the lowest average preference for any 
medium.
Many of the general comments provided by the libraries dealt with preferences for or concerns about 
the various media addressed by this survey. Throughout these comments, ease of use emerges as a 
major concern for libraries. Of the 109 comments related to compact discs (see Appendix M), the 
three most frequently made were (1) that CD-ROM products used for full-text dissemination must 
be user friendly and easy to install and use; (2) that current government CD-ROM products have poor 
user interfaces, poor user support, and/or poor search software; and (3) that government CD-ROM 
products should use standard search protocols and/or common user interfaces.

general library comments and suggestions related to the dissemination of full-text information were 
80


Accessing USDOE Scientific and Technical Information
Component II
requested in open-ended questions at the end of both parts of the survey (Appendix K, Questions 1.16 and 
11.13). Comments related to key issues concerning full-text dissemination have been grouped and 
tabulated in Appendix M. These tables have been referred to throughout the sections describing the 
findings of the survey where appropriate. The following paragraphs highlight comments received 
concerning the use of various media for full-text dissemination.
The largest number of general comments received about a given medium (109) concerned the use 
of compact discs for full-text dissemination. The most frequently made comment about this medium 
(by 14 libraries) was that CD-ROM products must be user friendly and easy to install and use. The 
next most frequent comment made (by 12 libraries) was that government CD-ROM products have 
poor user interfaces, poor search software, and poor user support. Comments noting the ease of use 
or user friendliness of CD-ROM products comprise 30% (33 of the 109) of all the comments received 
about this medium. Negative comments about compact discs included inadequate search software 
for some products, cost, and concerns about archival quality.
The media receiving the next highest number of general comments were paper and microfiche (39 
comments each). Over half of the comments received on the use of paper for full-text dissemination 
stated that users prefer paper to other media. Negative comments about paper were concerned with 
the space requirements and associated costs of storing paper documents.
Over 20% of the 39 libraries making comments on the use of microfiche stated that they have no 
problem with the dissemination of full text on this medium. The next most frequently made comment 
in this category (by 13% of the 39 libraries) was that microfiche is used because of storage/space 
problems. Other positive comments concerned the ease of using fiche for distribution and replace-
ment of documents and cost savings. Negative comments about microfiche mostly noted inconve-
nience, user resistance, and poor quality of microfiche/reproductions.
The most frequently made comment concerning the use of online networks for full-text information (by 
32% of the 22 libraries making this type of comment) was that cost of access is a great concern. Hardware/ 
software limitations and lack of use were other concerns. Positive comments concerning the use of online/ 
remote networks for full text included not having to store documents locally and ease of access.
Ten comments were received related to the use of optical discs for full-text dissemination. Of these, only 
one expressed a definite preference for this medium, stating that optical discs are better than CD-ROM 
for large full-text databases. The other comments focused on lack of equipment and other resources for 
use of this medium and concerns about the archival capabilities and quality of optical discs.
In addition to the comments concerning various media, libraries provided comments on a number of 
issues related to the dissemination and use of full-text information. Issues for which at least 20 
comments each were received were bibliography/indexing and search/retrieval capabilities, cost/ 
budget, equipment, software, user friendliness, and storage/space requirements for full-text informa-
tion. These comments are listed in individual tables in Appendix M.
Assessment of Alternative Media for Dissemination of Full-Text Information
As part of Component II of the Pilot Project, OSTI conducted an assessment of the feasibility of 
disseminating DOE full-text information on electronic media. The full analysis is contained in 
Appendix N.

Component II
Most of the DOE technical reports currently being received by depository libraries are in the form of 
printed documents or microfiche. Electronic dissemination of these reports would require that organiza-
tions providing reports to DOE transfer data in digital form or that DOE acquire technology to scan more 
than 2.7 million pages per year either in-house or through a contractor. In the future, the availability of high-
speed telecommunications via the national fiber-optic network will make it practical to transmit such large 
segments of full-text data electronically. The ability to receive these reports from their originators in 
electronic form would largely eliminate the need for scanning operations.
A further consideration is the fact that many of the reports include graphic or pictorial data that are 
absolutely necessary to the intellectual content of the document. In some cases the text would be of 
little use without the related graphic or pictorial data. This incorporates another level of complexity: 
the need to combine text and non-text data, a process known as imaging.
To incorporate image data even at a very low resolution requires significant space for the storage of 
the bitmap generated by a scanner. Imaging also adds a level of complexity to the search and retrieval 
software, as hyperlinks are required to associate the analog bitmaps with the digital text data so that 
both may be retrieved and displayed together.
This requirement for enormous data storage capability on any given distribution medium is the 
driving factor in full-text dissemination. It would be possible to reduce the need to physically 
distribute such enormous sets of data if a single source for access to full-text documents were 
provided through an online interface that could be used to rapidly retrieve full-text data in a cost- 
effective manner.
Such a system would allow the user to review the data on a terminal or download the data from the 
source to their local system for further processing. This capability does not yet exist; however, the 
advent of fiber-optic communications makes high-speed data transmission more and more available 
as networks are installed across the country. Improved speed and reduced cost will tend to make 
online systems more appealing to users and will reduce (but not eliminate) the need for a physical 
distribution process.
Much of the analysis of alternative media focused on the possibility of disseminating full-text 
information on CD-ROM. The CD-ROM format requires less space, cannot be damaged as easily 
as microfiche or paper, can use Boolean-type search capabilities, and has rapid query response. The 
CD-ROM format can also incorporate both text and image data.
Although technologies for storing and retrieving full-text information on CD-ROM currently exist, 
they have rarely been applied to a task as large as 30.5 GB of data (for a combination of ASCII and 
image format at 200 dpi) to 90 GB (for image format only at 200 dpi) annually. While this is a “worst 
case” figure, it is not unrealistic. Considering the enormity of such a full-text project, it would 
probably be better to enter the CD-ROM production arena on a smaller scale and allow the CD-ROM 
technology and fiber-optic communications to evolve to a state in which large quantities of data can 
be readily accessed and rapidly transferred.
A realistic short-term goal might be to produce a CD-ROM containing a twelve month-plus window 
of DOE STI abstracts rather than full text. This set of data could easily be loaded onto a single 
CD-ROM, including indices for searching. The abstract CD-ROM would essentially provide an 
82

Component II
index into the microfiche file, based on the abstract number, and would help resolve the difficulty 
of locating desired data within the microfiche file.
It should be noted that not all media authorities are in agreement regarding the life expectancy of 
optical media in their present form. Estimates of the archival life span of CD-ROM products range 
from five to one hundred years. This is reminiscent of the arguments heard thirty to forty years ago 
concerning the life expectancy of microfilm. Only time will provide the answer to the question of the 
longevity of optical media.
When users are able to access an online system that provides the capability to perform search and 
retrieval operations on full-text data, including the ability to actually download selected full-text data 
to their local system for further analysis and processing, the requirement for distribution services in 
other media will diminish. However, this capability is an issue for the future. In the meantime, an 
index CD-ROM accompanying microfiche shipments would provide enhanced access to the 
libraries’ existing stores of full-text information.
Summary—Component II
This section is intended to summarize for the reader some of the primary findings of Component II. Note 
that stated percentages are based on the number of libraries which responded to each individual question 
and do not necessarily represent the percentage of all 1,064 libraries responding to the survey.
DOE microfiche are physically located in the main library of 85% of libraries that receive DOE 
reports on microfiche. Both microfiche and paper are filed by Dewey Decimal, SuDocs, or some 
other classification system by over 90% of libraries listing one or more filing methods. Patrons or 
librarians at approximately 45% of libraries had experienced significant difficulties in accessing full-
text information. The three most frequently cited access difficulties were that (1) patrons dislike the 
microfiche format, (2) patrons are not aware of the availability of information on microfiche, and 
(3) patrons have difficulty locating the information on microfiche.
Over 98% of libraries currently use microcomputers/personal computers. Usage of compact discs was 
reported by 91% of libraries, with 97% planning to use this technology within 3 years. Over 85% of 
libraries did not own or use optical discs for any purpose, and only 32% planned to use this technology 
within 3 years. The type of CD-ROM equipment owned or accessed by the highest percentage of libraries 
was multiple stand-alone CD workstations.
The responding libraries make extensive use of networks, particularly network access systems such as 
Internet, TYMNET, and Sprintnet. Workstations with modems are used to access remote computers by 
88% of libraries.
Microfiche is the primary method currently used by libraries to acquire full-text information (used 
by 91 % of libraries), followed by paper (89%) and compact discs (71 %). More libraries reported that 
they will add the usage of compact discs for acquiring full text more than any other medium for 
acquiring full text.
Ease of retrieval of information was the most important factor to the libraries in selecting a storage/access 
medium and user interface for accessing full-text information. Costs, including purchase and maintenance 
costs, were also an important factor.
83


Accessing USDOE Scientific and Technical Information
Component II
Responding libraries in general preferred compact discs more than any other medium for accessing full-
text information. The preferred environment for accessing full-text was on a personal computer, either 
stand-alone or connected to a local area network.
Libraries that receive DOE full-text reports on microfiche would prefer to receive these reports on compact 
disc more than any other medium. Magnetic tape was the least preferred medium for receiving these 
reports.
In assessing the feasibility of disseminating DOE full-text information on some medium other than 
microfiche, this study found that the volume of technical reports issued each year makes it extremely 
problematic to generate a cost-effective replacement for microfiche. Since most of the technical reports 
currently submitted to OSTI are in paper format, electronic dissemination of these reports would require 
scanning and storing in digital form more than an estimated 2.7 million pages per year. In addition, 
disseminating these reports to Depository Libraries on the their preferred medium, compact discs, would 
generate approximately four new discs per week. Therefore, a more feasible alternative might be to 
produce a searchable CD-ROM containing a 12 month-plus window of abstracts, rather than the full text 
of the DOE reports. This CD-ROM would enhance access to the information contained on microfiche, 
and could be created from existing electronic files of bibliographic information.

Dissemination Media Cost Analysis
DISSEMINATION MEDIA COST ANALYSIS
During 1992 the United States Department of Energy (DOE), Office of Scientific and Technical 
Information (OSTI) made distribution of nearly 14,000 (13,914) research and development reports 
in varying quantities to 225 Depository Libraries. Distribution was made in the form of microfiche. 
A monthly publication in bibliographic format, Energy Research Abstracts (ERA), is provided as an 
index to the report literature acquired by OSTI, and, in particular, the DOE microfiche file. ERA 
subscription includes an annual index.
An objective of the GPO/DOE Pilot Project was to provide a cost analysis of at least one viable 
alternative technology compared to the cost of disseminating the same quantity of information in the 
form of microfiche to the Depository Libraries. A technology assessment, a discussion of currently 
available electronic media that could be considered for dissemination purposes, is provided as a 
separate appendix within this report.
Charts 1 and 2 on the following pages compare dissemination costs for providing bibliographic and 
full-text data to the Depository Libraries within the context of the applicable footnotes. It should be 
noted that provision of the following data does not indicate that these products are currently available, 
nor does it constitute a commitment on the part of DOE to produce such products. The analysis and 
actual production of CD-ROM discs were beyond the scope of the study; therefore the costs provided 
below are based on currently available data for commercial replication and distribution activities.
The following comparisons include data related to CD-ROM replication and distribution. It should 
be noted at this point that the CD-ROM cost estimates included in this analysis are based on a very 
simplistic design for the data contained on a CD-ROM. The study assumes that (1) each CD-ROM 
disc will be a stand-alone product, each with its own unique indexing capability; (2) information is 
stored on the CD-ROM in image format; and (3) search and retrieval software will be resident on each 
disc.
There are many different scenarios that could be examined or implemented in the design of a 
CD-ROM product. The Pilot Project did not include provision for the analysis and selection of the 
most economically feasible CD-ROM product design and implementation. Certain of these scenarios 
could conceivably provide significant cost savings, particularly in the area of software licensing; 
however, this is outside the scope of the Project.
Full-Text Data: Microfiche vs. CD-ROM
Chart 1 compares the actual replication and distribution costs of full-text reports in microfiche form 
with the estimated cost of replication and distribution of similar data utilizing the CD-ROM medium. 
In this case the term “replication” implies that OSTI is reproducing an existing product for 
distribution to the Depository Libraries. These costs do not include the cost of the acquisition of the 
data, its evaluation, initial microfilming, or storage. Similarly, the estimated costs for replication and

distribution of the full-text CD-ROM product do not include the cost of acquisition of the data, its 
evaluation, its storage, and the preparation for and actual production of the CD-ROM master disc 
from which the distribution copies are made.

Calculation of Costs of Full-Text CD-ROM
Of the 14,000 technical reports OSTI distributed to the Depository Libraries during 1992, not all 
libraries received all reports. OSTI’s user profile system determined which reports to reproduce on 
microfiche and distribute, by customer. If a CD-ROM distribution were to be established, all 
technical reports would be loaded onto a CD-ROM master from which the distribution copies would 
be made. All Depository Libraries choosing to receive DOE reports would receive the full 
distribution.
Using 14,000 reports per year as a base figure, an average of 270 reports per week can be assumed, 
based on the following calculation:
14,000 reports -s- 52 weeks per year = 270 reports per week (average)
The technical analysis of possible alternative distribution media indicates that, based on an average 
of 1.4 microfiche per report and 98 frames to a microfiche, there are approximately 138 pages in an 
average technical report. With this information it can be shown that weekly processing includes 
approximately 37,260 pages:
270 reports per week x 138 pages per report (average) = 37,260 pages per week
Appendix N of this report, “Technology Assessment of Alternative Media for Full-Text Delivery,” 
provides a series of calculations concerning data storage requirements. The calculations within 
Appendix N are based on a resolution of 200 dots per inch (dpi), and indicate a storage requirement 
of 46,500 characters (or bytes) for a single 8.5 inch by 11 inch page.
This figure has been used for the following calculations to provide consistency among the figures 
found in Appendix N and the cost analysis. It should be noted that changes in data scanning resolution 
will have a significant impact on the number of compact discs required to store the same quantity of 
full-text data. This in turn will have a proportionate impact on replication, handling, and mailing 
costs.
'Based on annual distribution for 225 Depository Libraries currently receiving DOE microfiche if all libraries received all reports. The estimated full-
text microfiche costs include replication costs of $142,000, handling costs of $166,500, and mailing costs of $67,000.
"Based on annual distribution of CD-ROM media to the 225 Depository Libraries currently receiving DOE microfiche. The estimated costs include 
replication, handling, software licensing, and mailing. Note that this estimate is based on an imaging resolution of 200 dpi.

Accessing USDOE Scientific and Technical Information
Dissemination Media Cost Analysis
At a relatively low resolution of 200 dpi (Footnote 3), the average page will require approximately 
46,500 (Footnote 4) bytes of storage as a raster image. Using this information and the estimated 
number of pages per week it is possible to calculate the total number of bytes of storage required for 
an average week:
37,260 pages x 46,500 bytes per page = 1,732,590,000 bytes per week
A CD-ROM disc is capable of storing as many as 660 megabytes (MB) of data on a single disc. 
However, the indexes necessary to access the data stored on the disc require a significant amount of 
storage space. For the purpose of this estimation process we will assume that 220 MB of each disc 
are required for the indexes, leaving 440 MB of data storage. Using this information and the estimated 
number of bytes which must be stored each week, it is possible to estimate the number of discs 
required per week, as follows:
1,732,590,000 bytes 440 MB of storage per disc = 4 CDs per week
The estimated four compact discs represent a single set that would serve a single Depository Library. 
There are 225 Depository Libraries currently receiving microfiche distribution; therefore, it would 
be necessary to produce 225 sets of these compact discs, a total of 900:
4 CDs x 225 Depository Libraries = 900 CDs produced per week
Current replication costs for a CD-ROM, including the jewel box and poly wrap, are approximately 
$3.50 per disc (Footnote 5) for quantities less than 250. It is assumed that as many as 75 additional 
customers would be receiving these CD-ROM products, increasing required CD-ROM production 
from 225 to 300 sets of these discs. When reproduction levels for a single master disc exceed 250 
copies, reproduction costs are reduced from $3.50 per disc to $2.50. Therefore the weekly replication 
costs would be $2,250:
900 CDs x $2.50 replication and packaging fee = $2,250 per week
Indexes placed on the CD-ROM must have software available to read the index and to retrieve the 
data from the disc. This software is licensed individually for each disc. License prices may vary, but 
for the purpose of this process a licensing cost of $10 per disc is assumed. At this rate the licensing 
cost for 900 discs will be $9,000:
900 CDs x $10.00 estimated software licensing cost per CD = $9,000 per week
Adding the total replication and packaging costs to the licensing costs, the total weekly costs to 
produce the CD-ROM product comes to $11,250:
$2,250 production costs + $9,000 licensing cost = $11,250 per week
Note that 200 dpi is a relatively low resolution for raster images. Depending on the data, it may be necessary to increase the resolution to 300 dpi. 
Such a change in resolution will result in a significant increase in the number of discs required to store the same quantity of data, with a proportionate 
increase in replication, handling, and mailing costs.
4This figure is based on calculations provided in Appendix N, “Technology Assessment of Alternative Media for Full-Text Delivery.”

Dissemination Media Cost Analysis
Shipping and handling costs are estimated at $1.55 per disc, a total expense of $1,395 per week.
900 CDs x 1.55 shipping and handling costs = $1,395 per week
When the total weekly production costs are combined with the shipping and handling costs, the total 
weekly cost to produce and disseminate the CD-ROM product is $12,645:
$11,250 + $1,395 = $12,645 total cost per week
The total estimated CD-ROM dissemination cost for a year is then $657,540:
$12,645 total cost per week x 52 weeks = $657,540 total cost per year
Bibliographic Data: Paper vs. CD-ROM
Chart 2 compares the replication and distribution costs of the ERA publication for 473 Depository 
Libraries with the estimated replication and distribution costs of the same data utilizing a CD-ROM 
medium. This comparison is included because this was the recommendation of the “Technology 
Assessment of Alternative Media for Full-Text Delivery” (Appendix N).

In this table the value $298,000 represents the estimated costs of duplication, binding, and shipping 
the Energy Research Abstracts (ERA) publication to 473 Depository Libraries. This cost does not 
include the cost of acquiring, evaluating, processing, and storing the data. This value is simply the 
cost of providing an existing product to multiple consumers.
Calculation of Costs of ERA Bibliographic CD-ROM
ERA is published monthly and distributed to 473 Depository Libraries. ERA provides bibliographic 
information concerning available scientific and technical reports, and provides an index into the 
DOE microfiche file being provided to some libraries.
Based on historical publication data, the average size of an ERA issue is 795 pages. From this 
information, the storage required for the average monthly issue can be estimated at 36.9 MB, as 
follows:
795 pages x 46,500 bytes per page = 36,967,500 bytes per month
6GPO override printing and estimated distribution and mailing costs for ERA to 473 libraries for one year. These estimated costs include reproduction 
costs of $264,000, handling costs of $10,000, and mailing costs of $24,000.
7GPO override replication, handling, software license, and mailing cost for ERA on CD-ROM for 473 libraries for one year.

Accessing USDOE Scientific and Technical Information
Dissemination Media Cost Analysis
The following calculation indicates that at a low resolution of 200 dpi, a monthly issue of ERA would 
only use approximately 8% of a CD-ROM disc. The remaining space on this disc could be used for 
other purposes. It should also be noted that the calculations being used in this evaluation are based 
on raster images, which are a worst-case estimate since raster images require significantly more 
storage space than do ASCII data.
36,967,500 bytes 440 MB of storage per disc = 0.08401 CD
Since only one CD is required for the monthly distribution of ERA, the total distribution to 473 
Depository Libraries for a single month will require 473 CD-ROM discs:
1 CD x 473 Depository Libraries = 473 CDs
At currently available commercial rates (March 1993), replication costs for 473 CD-ROM discs, 
including jewel boxes and poly wrap, will cost approximately $1,183 per month:
473 CDs x $2.50 replication and packaging fee = $1,183 per month
Software licensing costs for 473 CD-ROM discs at $ 10 per disc will cost approximately $4,730 per 
month:
473 CDs x $10.00 estimated software licensing cost per CD = $4,730
Total production costs for 473 CD-ROM discs will be approximately $5,913 per month:
$1,183 replication costs + $4,730 licensing cost = $5,913
It is estimated that shipping and handling costs will average $1.55 per CD-ROM shipped. On the basis 
of this assumption, monthly shipping and handling costs will be approximately $734:
473 CDs x $1.55 handling and mailing costs = $734
Using the total production and mailing costs established in the preceding calculations, the total 
monthly cost for CD-ROM distribution of the ERA publication can be approximated as $6,647:
$5,913 production costs + $734 mailing costs = $6,647
The annual cost would then be $79,764 for distribution of twelve months of the ERA publication:
$6,647 total cost per month x 12 months = $79,764

Dissemination Media Cost Analysis
Calculation of Costs of ERA Annual Index CD-ROM
The most recent ERA annual index consisted of 3,924 pages. The raster image storage requirement 
at a low resolution of 200 dpi for 3,924 pages is approximately 183 MB:
3,924 pages x 46,500 bytes per page = 182,466,000 bytes
The value 183 MB represents a storage requirement of approximately 42% of the available space on 
a CD-ROM disc:
182,466,000 bytes 4- 440 MB of storage per disc = 0.41469 CD
The ERA annual index can be stored on a single CD-ROM disc. Since the distribution will include 
473 Depository Libraries, it will be necessary to replicate 473 copies of the CD-ROM.
1 CD x 473 Depository Libraries = 473 CDs produced
The replication fee, including the jewel box and poly wrap, for 473 CD-ROM discs will be 
approximately $1,183:
473 CDs x $2.50 replication and packaging fee = $1,183
Licensing costs for 473 discs at $10 per disc will cost approximately $4,730:
473 CDs x $10.00 estimated software licensing cost per CD = $4,730
Total production costs are estimated by adding the total replication costs and the estimated licensing 
costs, a total amount of $5,913:
$1,183 replication costs + $4,730 licensing cost = $5,913
Shipping and handling costs for CD-ROMs are estimated at $1.55 per disc. For 473 discs this cost 
would be $734:
473 CDs x $1.55 shipping and handling costs = $734
Combining production costs and mailing costs, the total distribution costs for the annual ERA index 
can be estimated at $6,647:
$5,913 production costs + $734 mailing costs = $6,647
Estimated Total Annual ERA CD-ROM Distribution Costs
When the total annual costs for the distribution of the monthly ERA updates and the total cost for the 
distribution of the annual ERA index are combined, it can be estimated that the total annual cost for 
replication and distribution to the Depository Libraries of a full year of ERA publications would be 
$86,411, if such a product were to be produced:
$79,764 total ERA monthly costs + $6,647 total annual index cost = $86,411

(Superintendent of Documents)
October 22, 1990
Dear Depository Librarian:
We are pleased to announce plans for a pilot project to evaluate 
ways to improve the dissemination-of, access to, and utilization 
of Department of Energy (DOE) research results.
The GPO/DOE Pilot Project is one of five pilots being conducted 
to test electronic dissemination of information to depository 
libraries. This project consists of two interrelated components: 
"Information Access" and "Alternative Media for Full Text 
Delivery."
Under the "Information Access" (online) component, approximately 
20 depository libraries will access the DOE Integrated Technical 
Information System (ITIS) for a period of six months, beginning 
February 1990. This includes:
* searching bibliographic and authority files resident on 
ITIS;
* using electronic mail;
* testing a gateway to DIALOG;
* testing a COSATI to MARC-like conversion utility for 
shared cataloging.
The second component, "Alternative Media for Full Text Delivery," 
will evaluate the feasibility of distributing the full text of 
DOE technical reports in electronic format.
This letter and accompanying materials provide a description of 
the "Information Access" component of the GPO/DOE P.lot" Project. 
Additional details about ITIS may be found in the appendix to the 
enclosed information packet. A copy of the packet (except for 
the survey) has also been sent to your Library Director.

Depository Library Use of DOE Microfiche Questionnaire with Results
The U.S. Government Printing Office (GPO) and the U.S. Department of Energy Office of Scientific and Technical 
Information (OSTI) are conducting a pilot project to evaluate the usefulness of OSTI products and services in delivering 
scientific and technical information (STI) to your patrons. As one of the sites selected to participate in this project, your 
library will be asked to complete a series of questionnaires designed to determine the value to you of the capabilities 
you have been provided with for the duration of the project.
This questionnaire will establish baseline information that will be used to evaluate the success of the project The 
questionnaire should take between 45 minutes and 1 hour to complete. To the extent possible, please respond to the 
questions based on your operation PRIOR TO THE BEGINNING OF THE PILOT PROJECT.
Please return the questionnaire to OSTI in the enclosed postage-paid envelope by April 26. If you prefer, you may 
return the questionnaire by facsimile to (615) 576-2865. Your cooperation is important, and will help OSTI evaluate its 
dissemination program. If you need additional information on this study, or if you have any questions, please contact 
Amy Finnerty of OSTI at (615) 576-6800.
Thank you for your participation.

technical reports? (Explanations of “Not Sure” responses.)
• We usually don’t catalog fiche reports. A few of our reports are print and we 
catalog them with the same vendor as for our books.
• No plans at present for cataloging technical reports.
• We do not fully catalog all technical documents. Those that we do, we use 
OCLC, other receive limited cut in-house.

and/or patrons on library use or use of your fiche collection, is DOE fiche 
usage included?
Library comment:
But we are making new handouts on Energy and Environment which will address 
part of this problem.
Question H.30.9
What is the nature of this access difficulty [with effectively accessinq DOE 
report literature]? (“Other” responses.) 
a
• We know about reports before they are indexed or shipped-have to wait for 
access.
• Fiche access easy (illegible) numbers
• We don't receive international fiche/other non-depository which are in old version 
of ERA. ERA-located title.
* ERA is too time consuming; DIALOG is too expensive.
Responses received from 4 libraries.
Question H.31
Do you have any other comments or suggestions related to the use of DOE 
technical reports or microfiche? (Open-ended question).
• The DOE microfiche are important to us because of our mission to support the 
colleges of Engineering, and Mining and Energy Resources, as well as to provide 
research materials for the state of West Virginia where energy is seen as very

Appendix D
vital to the economy. It is under-utilized partly because we don’t promote it 
enough, partly because we don’t receive requests for report literature, partly 
because people perceive it as hard to access through ERA, and partly because 
DIALOG is so expensive. In my opinion we would save considerable expense in 
filing and mislocating reports, if we could order individual fiche quickly. I would 
like to be able to continue to offer low-cost searching, or at least much lower than 
DIALOG. Ideally we could then order the needed fiche online and it would come 
in the mail. Another idea is to put the reports on floppy disks since users aren’t 
terribly keen on microfiche.
• Nothing new since the previous survey.
• We appreciate the format: we could not possibly store that much paper, nor 
would we have time to select individual titles if they could not be subscribed to as 
a collection. Even if the collection is not used to the fullest—even if only one in 
100 microfiche are ever used—when there is a request for a specific one it is 
most gratifying to be able to retrieve it immediately.
• DOE should perhaps take advantage of GPO experience in creating MARC 
records for DOE publications; MARC records that are produced by a national 
cataloging authority is a must for depository libraries. GPO is a national 
cataloging authority, and DOE can become one after training from GPO. 
A. While the use of DOE technical reports is of great importance to some 
institutions, in a small liberal arts institution, it is not uncommon that they 
would have extremely limited use—either little or none. Also, the type student 
being served in an educational institution has much to do with the ultimate 
demand. Undergraduates and even masters’ students have less interest and 
it would be understandable that researchers, doctoral students and those in 
technical professions would use these reports much more.
B. Many of the reports are difficult or impossible to obtain. Users in academe 
are driven by a short availability span, and are unwilling to go to a lot of effort 
to produce reports.
C. Users in research institutions and business are used to paying for reports 
while those in academe are not. The price is usually not worth the product for 
those in academic institutions which are undergraduate in nature. When 
individuals pay for their own reports, it is less common that they are pursued 
strenuously.
D. Referring to comment (A.), I must add that most of the students and many of 
the interested faculty might very probably be unable to understand the DOE 
technical reports. Most are highly technical, naturally, and require an interest 
and background in a specific subject.
E. Many of the DOE reports are written in foreign languages. There is no one in 
most small academic institutions to translate, or even that knows many of the 
languages used. There is no money to translate and especially when the 
need is so limited.
F. Regarding the format of the DOE reports, while microfiche is not loved by its 
users, it is nevertheless unrealistic to receive in paper, especially with the 
limited use it receives in many institutions. However, accessibility is still more 
difficult.
G. My last comment concerns general use of the DOE technical reports. I 
believe it vital that these reports be available to those persons who do need 
the information. However, it is unrealistic to believe that a great percentage 
of the population needs DOE reports. For those who do need them, it is a 
wonderful source of technical information, and the availability factor must be 
protected. I commend OSTI heartily for their part in making DOE reports 
available and for the helpful way in which assistance is given.
Comments/suggestions were received from 5 libraries.

Technical Evaluation Questionnaire with Results
The U.S. Government Printing Office (GPO) and the U.S. Department of Energy Office of Scientific and Technical 
Information (OSTI) are conducting a pilot project to evaluate the usefulness of OSTI products and services in 
delivering scientific and technical information to your patrons. Baseline information about your library was collected 
from the first questionnaire you completed.
This questionnaire is designed to evaluate your experience to date with the Integrated Technical Information System 
(ITIS), the Energy Science and Technology Database, shared cataloging capabilities, and the ITIS Communication 
Gateway. The questionnaire is divided into three separate parts: Part A covers ITIS and the database, Part B covers 
the shared cataloging capabilities, and Part C covers the ITIS Communication Gateway. Since different individuals at 
your site may have been responsible for these different aspects of the project, the person who was most involved 
with each activity should complete the appropriate part of the questionnaire.
Each part of the questionnaire should take no more than 10-15 minutes to complete. Please return all three parts at 
the same time in the enclosed postage-paid envelope by July 1. If you prefer, you may return the questionnaire by 
facsimile to (615) 576-2865. Your cooperation is important. If you need additional information or have any questions, 
please contact Amy Finnerty at (615) 576-6800.

FILE MERGING:
The ITIS Gateway allows the user to merge the results of searches in the Energy Science and Technology Database 
on ITIS with older DOE records in files 103 and 104 on DIALOG. The search results are combined in a personal 
database that can be viewed, sorted, or printed as desired. The following questions concern the use of ITIS or other 
systems to merge files of search results from different sources.

Technical Evaluation Survey: 
Open-Ended Questions, Explanations of Responses, Library Comments
Question A.11
Question B.1
Question B.2
What types of patrons have you been able to serve with information from the 
database?
Library Comments:
• No patron requests per se. Just performed practice searches.
Based on your experience, please rate the downloading capabilities of shared 
cataloging.
• It took me three tries to successfully complete downloading a file. The first two 
times, I spent more than an hour downloading before I was dropped, probably 
due to line noise or other telecommunication problems. Thus, the time required to 
download one file was over three and a half hours and this is far too much time 
required.
• In my only attempt to logon so far I was stymied at the next-to-last step of pass-
words. Every typing mistake necessitated starting over. I gave up because there 
was only a slim chance of the database being helpful for this question anyway. It 
wasn’t worth the frustration.
• One example for b,c: get *.*—no clue that a space is needed between “get” and 
Second download took over 2 hours—ties up PC too long. No instruction or 
help on uploading from PC.
• About one time in four I’d get dropped mid-way through. Sometimes “lost” file.
• 
I was somewhat surprised with the size of the file we needed to download, I think 
it was about 20 records, file was about 400K, took about 2 hrs. at 2400 baud. I 
could have been downloading the wrong file. You might want to consider com-
pressing the file with PKZIP or something. After I download it, I compressed it to 
about 150K, this would have expedited downloading.
• Downloading these records has not been difficult; uploading is now equally easy 
for us to perform. I view the uploading of these records as being extremely 
valuable, and our patrons agree. They are using DOE materials as never be-
fore—even for general subject requests.
• Had problems with Kermit at 2400 baud. Amount of time needed for download is 
too long.
• We have not successfully downloaded anything at this time. A&M is having 
difficulty writing a translator for downloading magnetic tapes from ITIS. Once this 
is accomplished, we will be able to tell you more.
• Mechanics of downloading to disk were fine, however, we were not able to 
upload into our online catalog the data. We were not able to get binary download 
from ITIS system.
• Note: As a discretionary site, lacking an automated catalog, we received permis-
sion to not participate in this portion of the study.
Responses were received from 10 libraries.
Based on your experience, please rate your satisfaction with the cataloging 
records.
• 
I did not participate in this process to any large degree.
• Unable to read records from disk to local online catalog.

Subject heading not in LC format; not LC choice. Never were able to use records 
No staff time—see warning note of first survey at end. Our online cataloging 
system, LS/2000 requires rigidly controlled input.
• Format very non-standard. Took too much programming time.
• Sorry, we thought we would be able to engulf data into catalog. DP on catalog 
side needed a tape.
• Our Automation Department is unable to use the records.
• MARC-like record was not “loadable.” We do not have the technology to support 
staff to “write/modify” the loader for these records. (Attempts to read the files 
caused the loader program to abort.) Note that we use GEAC software which is 
proprietary and runs on GEAC hardware.
• Have not done any downloading—records are not in format our system can 
handle and—subjects do not conform to established library headings.
• See attached letter (in Appendix J). We have successfully downloaded EDB 
records to our local hard drive; however, we were unable to upload this material 
into our GEAC online catalog because we were unable to provide a program to 
use the translation tables. We also found ourselves involved in a changeover 
from GEAC to NOTIS. There was no space left in our GEAC online catalog to 
accommodate our day-to-day routine needs let alone space to accommodate the 
GPO/DOE Pilot Project. Finally, we chose not to corrupt our existing MARC 
format with any extraneous information that may logically belong to other fields in 
our system.
• We’ve had trouble with our VTLS loading programs reading tape. Indicator fields 
and 1st character of subfield (a) are dropped. This does not happen with BNA/ 
SOCINETcOCLC records.
Responses were received from 11 libraries.
Question B.3 Based on your experience, please rate your overall satisfaction with shared 
cataloging.
• Receiving the records on tape is much preferred over downloading.
The Shared Cataloging component of the pilot project was not satisfactory for us 
mainly because the records were not MARC records, and as a NOTIS library, the 
task of doing the translator program was simply too work intensive. This is a ’ 
small liberal arts university; unlike most of the other members of the 17-member 
pilot group. The support staff for MIS is very small and works with the entire 
university. There is not time nor money to undertake a project such as the DOE 
pilot project shared cataloging component. However, I made personal phone 
calls to six of my project colleagues trying to get information getting the system 
up, and none to that time were successful (all NOTIS sites).
• 
Until we can see these records load into and interact with our online catalog, we 
cannot respond positively to D. above. Assuming we can finally load the tapes, 
we would prefer to receive monthly tapes. Direct downloading to disk is much too 
time-consuming and expensive!
I would think that the presence of these records in our catalog would boost usage 
significantly. It seems, though, that much more work must be done for that to 
happen. As a separate, dial-up utility, expected usage would be very low.
If we can increase systems staff, and if we can purchase a new online system 
that will allow us to load the database as a separate file, we would answer “YES” 
to D. As to E.—tape is better than downloading.
• 
If tape, depends on price.
• 
Compression of downloading records would have been nice.

• The project did not take into account the storage requirement at the library sites. 
The cost could become quite great for a very small percentage of the collection. I 
would prefer a CD-ROM product.
• Tapes would be preferable; if we can get load programs to work properly.
Responses were received from 9 libraries.
Question C.3
Have you used the ITIS Gateway to merge search results files from ITIS and 
DIALOG?
• Did not merge files.
• Yes, but could not get gateway to save file from ESTD on ITIS. Used ProComm 
to save to disk instead!
Responses were received from 2 libraries.
Question C.12
Have you used the ITIS Gateway to produce bibliographies or notification lists 
using files merged from ITIS and DIALOG?
• No, but did distribute, in paper, weekly lists of DOE fiche distributed.
Response was received from 1 library.
Question C.23
List other comments or suggestions concerning personal database services.
• Would like to be able to merge records from a CD-ROM and ITIS.
• When I tried to merge the two databases, it was not successful. Things seemed 
to follow manual directions until then. At “edit,” showed 30 records and should 
have been 43—said “end of database.”
Responses were received from 2 libraries.
Question C.26
If the ITIS Communication Gateway in its present form was made available as 
part of the regular ITIS service, would you or your colleagues use it?
• Would like better documentation.
• Use here does not warrant it.
• The up-to-dateness is not of sufficient importance to overcome inconvenience of 
two searches and new search language. Will probably use Dialog or STN for 
energy searches.
Responses were received from 3 libraries.
Question C.27
Would having access through the ITIS Gateway to other systems or databases 
(in addition to DIALOG files 103 and 104) make you more likely to use it?
• Any DIALOG or STN file.
• OCLC.
Responses were received from 2 libraries.
Question C.28
Please provide other comments or suggestions concerning the ITIS Commu-
nication Gateway.
• With the advent of CD-ROM, our use of Dialog has greatly decreased. Our major 
means of access to DOE reports is through the Dialog NTIS CD-ROM. Having 
access to the most current reports through ITIS is wonderful. Should DOE go
F-3


Accessing USDOE Scientific and Technical Information
Appendix F
through with plans to produce a CD-ROM version of the Energy Database, it 
would be useful to have a way to merge records from the CD-ROM and ITIS.
• Manual did not say that files had to be named separately, at least where we read. 
We are used to using software where the downloaded records are added to the 
end of the file. Now we are assuming that the files should have been individually 
named and then combined using the “combine” option. When we began to “edit” 
it displayed the first 30 records and said we had ended the database, and there 
should have been another 13 records. Is there a limit to the SAMPLE file size? 
One of the problems with the software in general is that there seems to be no 
option for EXITING or BACKING OUT easily. The screens get very confusing 
and the process seems to go in circles. Back to the Gateway—the main problem 
was that the count indicated all the records were there, yet when we tried to find 
the DIALOG records, they were gone. They appeared with the SEL and disap-
peared when we tried to download. As with the “non-MARC” records in the 
shared cataloging component, there seems to be no consistency with any 
computer program. When a library uses many systems and processes with 
computers this get unbelievably complicated. If the Gateway experience had 
been anything but a test run, OSTI would have been accessed for assistance, 
but at this point it seemed unnecessary. NOTE: At one point, a WARNING 
message appeared, with message that “ITIS software error has been detected.” 
Had there been more time available, we would have called ITIS as indicated, and 
this might have been the reason our merging did not work. Upon continuing, 
however, the message disappeared, but not all options worked as indicated in 
manual.
• Have not had enough time or training to learn how to use it [ITIS Gateway] with 
proficiency.
• 
I want to note that Susan Hocker, who had been our contact person on this 
project, left LSU recently for another position. I have taken her place. While she 
did demonstrate how to log on to me, I had great difficulty turning her sketchy 
notes into success on my first and so far only attempt to log on to the system. I 
am filling out this evaluation because it was left behind for me with other materi-
als and because I have had some awareness of the project all along.
• 
I feel that I must offer you a word of explanation since our participation in the pilot 
project was not at the level that I had hoped. Soon after attending the ITIS 
training, I learned that my teammate would be resigning from the University. 
Because we were in a temporary hiring freeze at the time, that position has been 
unfilled. Since “the show must go on,” I’ve been responsible for a number of 
areas I was formerly able to delegate, and consequently unable to proceed with 
the pilot project at any level but the most minimal. I wanted you to know this 
because the training provided was excellent, and I know that the amount of effort 
expended on this project was enormous. This project is important to libraries 
throughout the nation. Wishing you continued success.

Final Project Evaluation Survey: 
Open-Ended Questions, Explanations of Responses, Library Comments
Question B.1
Based on your experience with the Pilot Project, how do you think the 
frequency with which your library patrons access your collection of DOE 
microfiche will be affected?
Library comments:
• “...will be affected?” crossed out; “has & is being affected” written in.
• If we can continue to receive cataloging data.
Question B.3/B.4
Were the patrons you were able to serve with information from the DOE 
database typical of your usual patrons? Why or why not?
EXPLANATIONS OF “YES” RESPONSES:
• Our patrons run an extremely wide gamut, including students and faculty as well as 
people from the business community.
• Science is the subject area of our department.
• My usual clientele is academic faculty and students, and those were the patrons I 
was able to work with most during this pilot project. I tried to interest personnel at 
Wolf Creek Power station (phone calls, letters) as well as colleagues in other KS 
academic institutions, but this did not work well.
• Not advertised off campus, though we received off-campus requests as usual.
• But very few.
• Our typical users of energy information are faculty researchers, or graduate 
students. Those patrons who used ITIS were from the above groups, thus were 
used to the technical nature of the information.
• Patrons for DOE STI are faculty, graduate students and research staff of the 
Physics Department and electron accelerator facility.
EXPLANATIONS OF “NO” RESPONSES:
• 
I think we had slightly more users from the University. I think of the DOE users as 
more community than University.
• This is a main Library, serving the whole campus.
Responses were received from 9 libraries.
Question B.5
About what percentage of your usual overall clientele do you feel would have 
an ongoing need for DOE information?
Library comments:
• It varies.
• Note that not all our patrons are interested in STI (explaining response of “1 to 25%”).
Question B.6
To what extent, if any, has regular access to ITIS and the Energy Science and 
Technology Database been valuable to your library?
Library comment:
• To Physics branch library (explaining response of “Great extent”).
H-l

Appendix H
Question B.7
To what extent, if any, would receiving DOE shared cataloging files be 
valuable to your library?
Library comments:
• [Library responded “Very great extent” and placed three stars beside their 
answer.]
• If we had the resources to load (or access for free), value would be high.
If files could be successfully tape loaded onto local automated system (explaining 
response of “Moderate extent”).
Question D.11.c
Which method of receiving shared cataloging records does or would your 
library prefer? (“Other method” responses)
• CD-ROM with search software
• Mount as database with OCLC’s first search
Responses were received from 2 libraries.
Library comment:
• If Internet, not by phone (explaining response of “Download from online source”).
Question D.12
Based on your overall experience, please rate your satisfaction with shared 
DOE cataloging. (Explanations/Comments)
Lack of a load program to get the records into the library online systems was an 
impossible obstacle since this university did not have the personnel or funding to 
have such a program written. We have NOTIS, as did some 6 others of the 
participating members. The other real difficult barrier was lack of the MARC 
format which most libraries live and die with. Too bad there was not more 
communication with library community before OSTI went to the time and trouble 
of the training program.
• See attached report. (See letter from Christina Perkins Meyer of the University of 
Minnesota in Appendix J.)
Records need to be easily converted into a usable format or already MARC. We 
have no one to write conversion programs and could not use the tapes we got. If 
they were usable they would be an enormous help since we get so many of 
these reports and currently rely on NTIS.
• a-c: If the file were separate from our online public catalog, the records would 
be quite satisfactory.
d: 
We currently have no funds for subscribing
e: 
We have no time nor sufficient equipment for downloading and cannot 
load tapes on our online catalog at present.
• We were not able to load the records during the pilot projects. It was a 
combination of bad timing and some miscommunication between our public 
services & technical services departments.
We were unable to load any of the records due to the non-standard MARC- 
record. We would probably prefer a CD-ROM due to the size of the database.
• N/A—we did not participate with this module. We loaded 1 magnetic tape. 
Our system manager prefers to load shared cataloging records from tape but 
was unable to load the project tape successfully. Our tape load program could 
not handle tapes because of dropped indicators & subfield characters.
Eastern and Washington State University programmers spent over 100 hours 
loading a test file into our joint online catalog. The test file consisted of two weeks

of DOE records. Three problems were major obstacles: (1) The offset value was 
off by 1 byte, (2) the leader description had to be adjusted to be recognized, 
(3) our system limit of 2K for maximum record length meant the end of many 
DOE records was lost. EWU intends to make extensive use of OCLC’s First 
Search over our campus network. We believe that the most cost-effective way to 
make ESTD available to the general and research public would be to make it 
available through such a service as First Search. OCLC has indicated it would be 
willing to work on such a project with Eastern if the DOE tapes would be made 
available. In general, many of the points made by the University of Minnesota 
were applicable to the EWU/WSU system.
• We received permission to participate in the study as a discretionary site. Since we 
did not get automated by the end of the project, we were not able to participate in 
the shared cataloging. Because we sometimes get line noise when downloading, 
we would have preferred magnetic tape had we participated in the shared 
cataloging.
Responses were received from 10 libraries.
Question E.13.e
During the Pilot Project, about how many times did you use the ITIS Gateway?
Library comment:
• Used DIALOG (NTIS) on CD-ROM instead—cheaper—(DIALOG’S CD-ROM 
version of NTIS.)
Question E.14
Which of the following Gateway capabilities did you use?
Library comment:
• Difficult to use (referring to “creating bibliographies or notification lists for 
distribution”).
Question E.17
Which retrieval software are you more comfortable using, ITIS or DIALOG? 
Why?
• Both are equal
• As a veteran searcher through DIALOG, it isTnuch easier for me to access 
information databases through this system. With several years of use and 
training which I have had, the search techniques are much preferred.
• DIALOG—because I use it for over 80 searches each month. Easier to use 
limiters.
• DIALOG is easier to use because they use similar vocabularies to librarians. ITIS 
was difficult in that Boolean logic did not consistently work nor did standard 
search strategies. The best results from ITIS were the broadbased searches.
• DIALOG—familiarity combined with power.
• DIALOG, because I am more familiar with DIALOG. Use DIALOG frequently.
• DIALOG used more frequently.
• DIALOG—more experience using.
Responses were received from 8 libraries.
Question E.18
Are the citations available on DIALOG current enough for your needs? If not, 
please explain.
• No. Microfiche is received and available long before records appear in DIALOG. 
Faculty are often aware of current research and want access as quickly as 
possible.

Appendix H
Question F.21
Question F.22
• Yes, the citations through DIALOG are usually current enough. The negatives 
concern the usual high prices of science/technology databases. However, with 
careful strategy, this can be satisfactory to our patrons. The currency and price of 
ITIS would be much better, but for an institution without much research in 
technology (no doctoral programs), DIALOG seems to be sufficient and easier for 
staff management.
• Yes
• Generally—yes.
• Not always, but only because many users want information the same day the info 
was released.
• N/A
• Yes
• Yes
Responses were received from 8 libraries.
Indicate the total cost to your library for the entire project and whether this 
cost is actual or estimated.
Library comments:
• Telecommunications [cost] included above (Computer/data processing).
• Figure [for computer/data processing] includes new computer equipment 
necessary for project.
• Costs [for training] included in F.21 .f.2 [staff costs].
• F.21 .f.1 [Training] includes week in training at Oak Ridge.
• F.1 Buckles (Washington State University programmer) 100 hours = 2.5 weeks 
@ $64,000/year. F.2 Rea (Documents Librarian) 80 hours = 2 weeks @ $60,625/ 
year. E.2 Photocopy costs to distribute weekly list to selected departments and 
faculty. See attached letter. (See Eastern Washington University correspondence 
in Appendix J.) (See note under Question F.22.)
Do you have any other comments concerning your participation in the Pilot 
Project?
• Most of our patrons expect to find energy related material using our public 
access catalog. We have GPO cataloging and most assume that DOE material is 
included. Having the DOE cataloging in PAC would vastly increase the use of the 
Energy material and make it available to a large cross section of our patrons. For 
this reason, the Shared Cataloging is the most important part of the Pilot Project. 
While it took far longer than I would have preferred, we were able to load the 
records. Since working out the problems is what pilot projects are all about, I feel 
the Shared Cataloging project to be a success. I strongly urge that distribution of 
the DOE Cataloging records to depository libraries be offered in the very near 
future.
• Positives—Very helpful information about contents of DOE microfiche; 
Familiarization with OSTI, extremely interesting and beneficial; associations with 
OSTI personnel; very gratifying experience; Associations with other documents 
librarians from several states; Opportunity to participate in pilot and go through 
training program—a very well-planned project with many benefits for a more 
research-oriented institution; A well-planned training program with good 
personnel and resources. Negatives—Expensive for the library and institution for 
benefit received academically; Not really a beneficial program for a small liberal 
arts university; Lack of MARC format for records impossible to use; Lack of a 
load program to use with NOTIS system for cataloging records. The library 
director and I are both glad ESU participated, even though the benefits were 
rather on the intangible side...THANKS for your dedication and hard work.

Appendix H
• Please make modifications suggested by Chris Meyer at the University of 
Minnesota Libraries (see Appendix J) so that we can all load cataloging tapes 
more easily! Also, OSAM version of ITIS was great for our purposes. It would be 
great as the front-end search software that all libraries see if you decide to make 
ITIS available to depository libraries.
• 
I believe the only costs incurred were for Susan Hooker’s training trip and one or 
two brief database searches. Use of DOE materials as a separate resource is 
low enough to make this a low use project, but if records for DOE reports could 
be merged into our general catalog, a significant jump in usage would be seen.
• Investigation of ITIS was valuable and instructive, as was introduction to DOE 
indexing and document distribution. Lack of funding and systems staff was our 
major difficulty. Having full-text documents available on line or in CD-ROM form 
would be a convenient and cost-saving method for us.
• Attached letter. (See Appendix J for letter.)
• The lists of reports received grouped by subject categories were very helpful to 
my patrons. We would continue to use them, if they were provided to us.
• Need standard MARC cataloging words for our online catalog. These should 
preferably arrive simultaneously with fiche shipments. Ongoing need for an 
online retrieval system has not been determined. So far Dialog/NTIS has served 
our needs.
• Please keep at least the shared cataloging portion available.
• CD ROM is probably more appropriate for our needs. Adding records to the 
catalog could become prohibitively expensive in terms of mass storage. The 
project staff underestimated the costs needed to convert non-standard MARC 
records for loading into an OPAC.
• Although the Pilot Project was originally scheduled to begin February 1, 1991, 
Texas A&M did not begin searching ITIS until mid-April, 1991, due to 
telecommunications problems. Our director set aside a separate fund of 
$6,000.00 to draw upon for expenses incurred during this project. I do not know 
how much, if any, of this sum remains. I know that $1,012.98 of this sum was 
spent for my travel/training to OSTI Jan. 28-Feb. 1, 1991. Also, part of the 
account was spent for hiring a computer programmer. We recently loaded 1 
magnetic tape in our online catalog and have received many comments from the 
librarian. At this time, this tape is available to library personnel only. The 
demonstrations I gave for various researchers on campus were very successful, 
but use of the DOE Fiche collection did not alter significantly except immediately 
after the demo. The energy collection has steady use.
• Participation was limited by other project commitments at time of budget 
retrenchment and staff shortages. Inability to load tapes prevented serious study 
of adequacy of shared catalog product. Interest in DOE fiche and online 
searching of energy database grew, especially.
• 
I am enclosing a memo from 8-22-91, where I summarizied our participation for 
key staff here. I would like to add that the tour of OSTI on Friday where I got to 
meet the staff and see how information is processed was of major benefit to me. I 
hope that other information professionals in the future will be able to benefit as I 
did from the well-organized tour. Also, I am exceptionally impressed by the job 
OSTI does, and hope the high quality indexing will continue to be produced and 
supported by the federal government. (Two page memo from West Virginia 
University in Appendix J.)

Breakdown of Costs Paid for by GPO, Libraries, and DOE
Figure 1-1 shows in bar chart format the total dollar amount of ITIS online time logged by each test 
library during the entire six months of Component I. The three shadings for each library illustrate how 
much of that library ’ s total time that month was paid for by GPO, how much was paid for by the library 
itself, and how much was subsidized by DOE. Tables 1-1 through 1-4 which follow, provide a 
breakdown by library of online time logged and costs incurred under the three funding conditions: 
GPO-subsidized, DOE-subsidized, and time paid for by libraries themselves. These tables are divided 
into two-month and four-month segments because the two-month division point was where GPO- 
subsidy of billed online time ended and libraries began to pay.

Dear Sutton:
I am enclosing a copy of a memo and printout I just received from our 
Automated Systems Manager, Robert Carterette, with his explanation of 
why we were unable to use DOE's bibliographic records during the pilot 
project.
In my opinion, gaining access to these reports through our catalog was 
the most usefLil part of this project. I still hope it can be achieved, 
at least for a portion of the collection.
If you have any questions concerning this memo please contact Mr. Carterette 
at (216)623-2810.
Thanks for your attention.
Sincerely,

SUBJECT: DOE Technical Reports
We are unable to process machine readable cataloging for 
the DOE technical reports. We have encountered four dis-
tinct problems in the pseudo-MARC record structure: The 
subfield count (Leader byte 11) is 1, while MARC uses a 
count of two; invalid characters appear in leader bytes 
23 and 24; and correcting the first problem results in a 
different logical record length (Leader bytes 00-04) than 
that appearing in the DOE record.
Besides the not-so-simple conversion of COSATI tags to 
MARC fields or subfields, the leader and directory would 
have to be rewritten, and the logical record length re-
calculated .
Note also the contents of subject fields. The treatment 
of subdivisions is inconsistent with the practice of 
other agencies preparing machine-readable cataloging 
(e.g., LC, NLM, GPO) and not provided for within the 
structure of the established authority indexing we use 
for bibliographic data.

P.O. Box 62

Dear Sutton Kay:
First, I must apologize for the "black hole" I have fallen 
into with regard to this project. After returning to campus 
from the training sessions in Oak Ridge, I experienced 
several problems with the communications software and never 
did get the stuff to work. By the end of our winter guarter 
I had missed some important opportunities to work with a 
small group of science faculty and my own responsibilities 
within the Library were shifted to include collection 
development and management information. I was just never 
able to return to the project, and the short handedness of 
our library faculty meant no one else could be assigned to 
pick up on the GPO/DOE project. My failure to communicate 
all of this to you is my responsibility and for that I 
sincerely apologize.
I have filled out the final project evaluation report you 
have requested and the Finnerty questionnaire of last fall. 
I hope this information will be helpful belated as it is.
I have enclosed some other materials which I hope you will 
find interesting. First, there is the printout of the test 
database that our programmer was finally able to establish 
on our library system. You will also find some printouts of 
screens of our ELIS system. These will give you some idea 
of what the DOE records look like on our OPAC terminals. 
The "grinder" program referred to in the memos is a program 
used by WLN to input our OCLC records into the EWU/WSU 
library database. This "grinder" routine turned out to be 
the single most costly obstacle to inputing the DOE records 
into our "catalog." It proved to be simply too costly for 
both of our institutions.
For these reasons and for those noted in the Minnesota 
letter of November 1991, I would urge you to consider 
working with a party such as OCLC to load the DOE database

on such systems as "First Search." This type of access to 
the DOE database would probably avoid the heavy conversion 
costs required to load the DOE records on conventional MARC 
systems and would probably require much less revision, if 
any, of the COSATI record.
Again, I apologize for my extended silence. I still believe 
that this project was very much worth doing and that DOE is 
to be commended for taking this kind of initiative.

U.S. Dept, of Energy

Oak Ridge, TN 37831
Dear Mr. Kay:
As a participant in the recent OSTI JCP/GPO Pilot Project, there 
are several additional comments I would like to make regarding 
the project. There were some very good things about the project 
even though it may not have turned out as you had hoped. Size of 
participating institutions was probably a major factor, and this 
will doubtless be reflected in the returned final questionnaires.
First, you are to be complimented on the staff personnel who were 
involved with the pilot project. It was gratifying to meet such 
knowledgeable, personable and gracious people, and 1 will always 
remember that Southern hospitality.
Second, I thought the week was very well planned, and your choice 
of accommodations was excellent. You are probably not used to a 
group of librarians spending a week on your premises, and it was 
fun to have some entertainment as well as to learn more about 
DOE resources and services. My only regret was that no short 
trip to the Great Smokies was included, because they seem so 
beautiful, and it was my first trip to the Knoxville area.
The manuals were very detailed, and displayed an enormous amount 
of work and organization. I know the difficulty in writing such 
documents. There were spots where the instructions were hard to 
follow once I returned to Kansas, but that is to be expected in 
any such endeavor.
The wonderful gift of the International Energy Subject Thesaurus 
was totally unexpected, and it has been added to our documents 
collection. It will be useful as we do on-demand DIALOG searches 
in DOE Energy. Also, Emporia State University is home to the 
School of Library and Information Management, and those students 
are always interested in all types of research tools.
Another bonus was the weekly mailing of the Reports Received List. 
I found this bibliography of great benefit since it can be easily 
routed to physical science professors on the campus, and photocopied

for other interested individuals off-campus. I will miss this 
resource. Because this is a small liberal arts university, the 
in-depth research for which the DOE reports are probably most 
useful simply are not needed often or with any real speed. There-
fore, the weekly list was quite adequate for informing our science 
faculty about the availability of selected reports.
/Another "plus" was the deepened appreciation and understanding I 
received about the organization and contents of these reports. I 
am sure they will be used more in my library simply because my own 
awareness has increased.
Finally, I must go back to the warm and friendly people who worked 
on this pilot project. Regardless of the outcome, it was a great 
experience, and I want to thank you and all who were involved for 
your hospitality and generosity in providing such an opportunity 
for the selected group of depository librarians.

I am enclosing a supplement to my questionnaires to flesh out the qualitative 
data they will provide you. First, let me apologize for their lateness; it 
was not intentional.
Before we loaded our shared cataloging records on our online system—which 
is also available to any library in our state—DOE reports were available 
bibliographically only through using the ERA or our NTIS CD-ROM. This 
-limited their use to those searching specifically for energy data, and 
because of the formidable nature of ERA, tended to be technical information 
users only. Downloading the cataloging data has caused our DOE fiche to 
be used for general, non-technical information uses and has also enchanced 
our usage for technical info users as well. We have averaged five questions 
per week for them since we have downloaded the records. This is a big increase.
We have also promoted DOE reports in five of our six bibliographic newsletters 
that we publish and distribute within the state. About 40% of those promoted 
have been requested.
The ability to do online searches on DOE/ITIS is a service we have publicized 
to every library in our .state through our state library newsletter, the 0DL 
Source. We have received six requests from other libraries to conduct searches 
for them. This fall, working with a librarian from that institution, I had 
intended to promote the use of online searching to the faculty, staff, and 
students of the University of Oklahoma Energy Center. If DOE/ITIS is still 
available to us then, I will do this in September. They could potentially 
become a big user of this service, since the Univ, of OK library also receives 
DOE microfiche, and has since the AEC days.

Sorry about the gatewaying, but we tended to use our NTIS CD-ROM for this 
purpose, as well as the reasons of lack of time that happened to me.
I am enclosing some exhibits of how we have promoted the pilot project here. 
If I had had more time during this period, I could and would have done more.
In my opinion, despite a slow start not only by my library but apparently 
by almost everyone else, I believe the project was a success. It enabled 
the depository librry community to access and utlilize DOE microfiche 
in a more efficient manner that it ever has before. It has also been an 
educational process for most of us. We have learned a lot about electronics 
that we did not know before. To sum up: the DOE pilot project has been an 
exemplary project.

De r Mr. Kay:
This is to inform you that we have received the first tape of 
COSATI records. As you know, it was Evans Library's decision to 
participate in this project by receiving the records on tape rather 
than by downloading. We do not intend to use these records for 
cataloging, therefore downloading would be an inefficient mechanism 
for getting records into our database. It is our intent to use the 
records as an information resource for our staff and patrons 
similar to other reference databases we have loaded, utilizing 
NOTIS' Multiple Database Software (MDAS).
In reviewing the information that we have been sent, we have 
noticed that the format of the records we expect to receive is not 
consistent with the USMARC Format for Bibliographic Data. Some of 
the inconsistencies may not matter since we will not be cataloging 
from this data, but others will have a significant impact on our 
ability to load the records using existing software. Therefore, we 
have determined that we will have to have conversion software 
written for us that we bring these records into conformance with 
the basic MARC format.
The changes being anticipated
LDR Byte 11
Subfield code count
change to "2"; currently the 
value is "1" which is incorrect 
since two characters are used 
to represent a subfield code
are:

037 Perm. Doc. No.
absence of a record key may 
prevent correct processing of 
the records; what variable

records?

I have a few questions the answers to which will help us in 
understanding the scope of this project considerably:
1. 
How many records are on the tape we just received? That 
information is not on either the external tape label or on the 
printout included with the tape.
2. 
How many tapes will be received during the project?
3. 
How many records would we receive on a monthly update tape?
How many of those records would be adds; how many updates to 
previously received records?
4. 
Why is there no 001 field in the record? If updates are 
received, how would matches be determined for replacing the 
existing records with the update?
5. 
Do COSATI records ever contain summary, contents, or abstract 
data?
6. 
Why was a significant USMARC defined LEADER value coded 
incorrectly: LDR Byte 11 should always be set to ”2” to 
indicate that two characters are used to represent a subfield 
delimiter? According to printouts of the record, two 
characters are used, but the leader specifies that only one is 
really used. This is the most significant discrepancy between 
your data and USMARC standards and may very well result in an 
inability for anyone to.process the data as is.
We look forward to your prompt reply, in order for our programmer 
to be able to begin his work. Once we have loaded a tape we will 
let you know since your staff may wish to dial into our database to 
evaluate our approach. If your staff have specific questions, 
please contact Michele Dalehite or Kathy Jackson at 409-845-8111.

Dear Participants in the GPO/DOE Pilot Project:
Like many other participants in the GPO/DOE Pilot project, we had 
considerable difficulty loading the DOE records in our online 
catalog. Since we were ultimately successful, I thought it might 
be useful to share our experience with you. We have loaded all 
the records we have received and have begun to get reaction from 
our staff and users. From our point of view, tape loading the 
DOE records into our catalog may prove to be the most valuable 
aspect of the project. We hope that the DOE will continue to 
supply records; however, we believe that some errors must be 
corrected first.
The first set of problems we uncovered are instances of failure 
to follow MARC format. While the content of these records may 
well differ from typical cataloging records, it is our 
understanding that the structure of the records should follow 
standard MARC format. I have written to the project manager, 
Sutton Kay, explaining the errors, and stating that we believe 
the DOE should correct them before the records are widely 
distributed. The three types of errors are as follows:
1) Records are not correctly blocked.
The maximum block size for MARC format records is defined as 
2048 characters. The length of the block for these records 
is simply the length of the record, which often exceeds 2048 
characters. This means that they cannot be processed by a 
typical MARC conversion program.
When the generic NOTTS conversion program attempts to 
process a record which is longer than 2048 characters, it 
takes the first 2048 characters from that block, and the 
remaining characters from succeeding block(s) (actually 
succeeding record(s)). in almost all cases, the resulting 
concatenation is unprocessable, and all the affected blocks 
are dropped. This means that not only the long record, but 
succeeding record(s) are lost.
J-ll


Accessing USDOE Scientific and Technical Information
Appendix J
We modified the generic NOTIS conversion program to process 
a single block, at a time, regardless of its length. Another 
alternative would be to reblock the records correctly before 
converting them.
2) 
Field addresses are incorrect because of errors in the 
leader and directory.
First, the base address of data given in the leader should 
be equal to the sum of the lengths of the leader and the 
directory, as specified in US MARC Format for Bibliographic 
Data, leader, p. 6. The base address in these records is 
consistently one greater than that sum. Another way of 
stating this is to say that the first byte in a record is 
counted as •’I,” rather than •’0."
Second, the starting character position for the first data 
field given in the directory is ’’OOOOi.11 It should be 
"00000," as shown in both the example in US MARC Format ... 
and on page 42 of the document "A Translation Table to 
Convert DOE/OSTI - COSATI Bibliographic Records to MARC- 
LIKE-FORMAT Records."
The combination of these two errors means that to calculate 
the actual address of a field, one must subtract two from 
the address calculated using the leader/directory 
information.
Obviously, a conversion program cannot process a field 
correctly if it begins processing at the wrong point. We 
have modified the generic NOTIS program so that addresses 
are correctly calculated.
3) 
008 fields are missing an end of field mark.
Since this field is defined as fixed length, a typical MARC 
conversion program will consider these fields to be invalid 
and reject them. The consequences of the absence of an 008 
field will vary from system to system, but will generally be 
serious.
Since NOTIS does not. carry end of field marks internally, 
the generic NOTIS conversion program deletes the last 
character in every field. The 008 field is then one
J-12


Accessing USDOE Scientific and Technical Information
Appendix J
character too short, and is rejected. Records without 008 
fields can be loaded in NOTIS, but they cannot be indexed, 
since values from the field are included in index entries.
We have modified the generic NOTIS conversion program to 
eliminate deletion of the final character in the 008 field 
only.
While deviations from MARC format will affect all participants, 
other issues we have had to deal with may or may not be 
problematic at other sites. These include:
1) 
multiple files on tapes, variable number of files per tape, 
unknown number of records per file
Though this is not a requirement of MARC format, most of us 
are used to receiving a single volume and single file of 
records on a tape, and our processing routines are generally 
set up accordingly. We initially discovered the presence of 
multiple files by accident. Then we ran the first tape off 
the reel when we set up our program to simply keep searching 
for additional files.
It would be helpful if the DOE could concatenate all records 
in a single file. As an interim measure, we asked the DOE 
to provide an external label showing the number of files and 
the number of records per file on each tape so that we could 
be certain we had processed all records. The tapes we 
received toward the end of the project did have these 
labels.
2) 
Long records
A very small number of records exceed the length limit of 
8192 characters which we have currently set in our NOTTS 
system. While we need to raise this limit for a variety of 
reasons, we will not be able to do so soon. Long records 
are simply rejected by the NOTTS generic conversion program, 
so we lose them entirely. They may cause other problems in 
other systems.
3) 
No 001 fields
The NOTIS conversion program expects an 001 field in each 
record, so instructions for processing 001 must be commented 
out. Other conversion programs may also require 001 fields.
4) 
Call numbers
Since libraries file these reports differently, call number 
processing will vary. We are using data in the 086 sv.bfield 
a plus the first subfield 2 as our call number. We have 
modified the generic NOTIS conversion program so that the 
first subfield delimiter and code z in the field as supplied
J-13


Accessing USDOE Scientific and Technical Information
Appendix J
by DOE are converted to a single blank before call number 
creation begins. The conversion program then picks up both 
the SuDoc stem and the report number from the extended 086 
subfield a, and converts it to NOTIS A22 subfield b.
(Without this change, only the SuDoc stem in subfield a gets 
converted.)
We are willing to share the version of LBC90, the older NOTIS 
conversion program, which we used to load these records with any 
other NOTIS site. T would also be happy to attempt to answer any 
further questions you may have. You can reach me by:

Dear Mr. Kay:
Julia Wallace and Gary Fouty have asked me to tell you about the 
University of Minnesota's experiences in attempting to load the 
DOE records supplied as part of the GPO/DOE Pilot Project. We 
have managed to load a small set of records in our NOTTS test 
file, and hope to load all of the records we have received to 
date in our public catalog soon. Once we have solved the 
remaining problems, we will share our experience with other 
participants. The information will of course be most relevant to 
other NOTTS users, but some of it may be useful to others as 
well. Meanwhile, I would like to point out some problems which I 
believe DOE should deal with.
The problems which concern us most are deviations from MARC 
format. It is our understanding that while the content of the 
records may differ from typical cataloging records in various 
ways, DOE intends to follow MARC format in the structure of the 
records. We therefore believe that these errors should be 
corrected before the records are widely distributed. We have 
identified the following problems:
1) 
Records are incorrectly blocked.
The maximum block size for MARC format records is defined as 
2048 characters. The length of block for these records is 
simply the length of record, which often exceeds 2048. 
Longer records cannot be correctly processed by a standard 
MARC conversion program.
DOE, rather than users, should reblock the records. Records 
may be structured in one of two ways. Blocks may be of 
variable length with a maximum of 2048 characters, so that 
there is never more than one record in a single block and 
records span blocks only if they are longer than 2048 
characters. Or block length may be fixed at 2048, with 
multiple records or parts of records in one block, and many 
J-15

Appendix J
or most records spanning blocks. GPO or LC staff should be 
able to provide further details.
2) 
Field addresses are incorrect because of errors in the 
leader and directory.
First, the base address of data given in the leader should 
be equal to the sum of the lengths of the leader and the 
directory (See US MARC Format for Bibliographic Data, 
leader, p. 6.) The base address in these records is 
consistently one greater than that sum. Another way of 
stating this is to say that the first byte in the records is 
counted as ”1,” rather than "0.”
Second, the starting character position for the first data 
field given in the directory is ”00001." It should be 
"0000," as shown in both the example in the US MARC Format 
for Bibliographic Data, Directory, p. 2. and the same 
example on page 42 of the document "A Translation Table to 
Convert DOE/OSTI - COSATI Bibliographic Records To MARC- 
LIKE-FORMAT Records."
The combination of these two errors means that to calculate 
tne actual address of a field, one must subtract two from 
the address calculated using the leader/directory 
information. Users of the records should not need to 
perform this added step; rather, DOE should supply correct 
leader and directory entries.
3) 
008 fields are missing end of field marks, which have been
supplied for all other fields.
Since this field is defined as fixed length, a typical MARC 
conversion program will consider these fields to be invalid 
and reject them. in NOTIS, records missing 008 fields 
cannot be indexed; in other systems, the absence of 008 
fields may have other serious results.
DOE should supply an end of field mark for 008 fields, as 
for all other fields except the final field in each record, 
where the end of record mark also serves to indicate the end 
of field.
Though it is not a requirement of MARC format, most of us are 
used to receiving a single volume and a single file on a tape. 
Our processing routines are set up accordinglv. DOE is supplying 
a variable number of files per tape. Apparently, each file is a 
week's worth of records. It would be helpful if DOE could 
concatenate all records for a month into a single file for each 
tape. If this is not feasible, each tape should definitely have 
an external label which gives the number of files on the tape and 
the number of records (logical and physical) per file. We can be 
certain that we have processed all files and all records, and the 
tape will not run off the reel while the program searches for yet

more files.
The remainder of the problems we have encountered are NOTTS- 
specific or Minnesota-specific. Being a beta site always has its 
frustrations, but we are still looking forward to getting our 
patron's reactions to these records.
If I can answer any questions or provide further information, 
please let me know.

Re: 
GPO/DOE Pilot 
Project
Enclosed are copies of the two questionnaires I filled out for the 
GPO/DOE Pilot Project. The first questionnaire is very different 
from the second one in the nature of the questions.
We only participated in two of the three sectors listed on the 
second form. We applied for participation as a discretionary 
library and so did not participate in the Shared Cataloging Study. 
We did not participate in the ITIS Communication Gateway Project, 
either, because we did not have anyone who wanted to pay for a 
Dialog search of the Energy Database. All of our users were glad 
to get the discounted current window of 12-14 months.
It occurred to me at the end of the project, that we could have 
produced bibliographies for distribution to interested parties 
without their having asked for them. Another library participating 
in the project, Oklahoma State Library, produces bibliographies in 
order to market the library and its documents. It might be 
appropriate for us to produce bibliographies, if they are not 
already available, on mine lar.d reclamation, acid mine drainage, 
and clean coal technology. It would require funding. If any of 
you would like such bibliographies to promote the library let's 
talk about it.
While we typically do only a few Energy Database Searches a year, 
we are still surprised that we did not have more people wanting 
discounted Energy Database searches. We made publicity efforts by 
sending letters to appropriate people on and off campus. The 
librarians made efforts to solicit searches on the database. We 
told users researching in energy-related areas of agriculture, 
engineering, law, or environment that there was a great deal of 
relevant information on the database, but usually they did not wish 
to pursue the issue. I wondered if the DOE has an image problem, 
since so much of their funded research is nuclear and/ or defense 
related, yet that is by no means the majority of this multi-
disciplinary database. The COMER move was another factor that made 
us think the database would be more utilized.
J-22


Accessing USDOE Scientific and Technical Information
Appendix J
During the study, the relative lack of use made of our extensive 
collection of DOE microfiche, Energy Research Abstracts, and the 
Energy Database seemed almost inappropriate, since energy is so 
important to this state. My impression is that the vast majority 
of our energy questions are environmental and occupational, and 
users perceive other bibliographic resources as more important.
When we get our NTIS trial this September, we will be able to give 
the DOE fiche another chance to be used. However, since the NTIS 
database derives its indexing second-hand from the DOE, and re-
manipulates it, it tends to be out-of-date, and being on a 
quarterly CD-ROM, it's even more behind.
I am a big fan of the DOE Energy Database, since the indexing, 
abstracting, and bibliographic control seems more current, 
consistent, and complete than that of many of the other government 
produced databases. Additionally the relatively unique feature of 
"up-posting" from narrow to broader descriptors seems to be one of 
the answers to more intelligent search systems. All project 
participants were able to see the facilities, get an overview of 
procedures, and meet the people responsible for the indexing and 
processing. I'm interested in improving our access to technical 
report literature at WVU, and believe that participating in this 
project has been beneficial to my education in this area. While I 
feel that our participation was worthwhile to us in the long run; 
I believe that the DOE Office of Science and Technology did not 
receive enough data in return from our participation.

OVERVIEW
The U.S. Government Printing Office (GPO) and the U.S. Department of Energy Office of Scientific and Technical 
Information (OSTI) are conducting a joint study of all Federal depository libraries on the potential use of media other 
than microfiche for the dissemination of scientific and technical full-text information. This questionnaire has been 
designed in two parts: general library information and library technical capabilities. Please have the person with the 
most knowledge about each subject (if not the same) complete the appropriate section.
The questionnaire should take no more than 30 minutes to complete. If you have any questions, please contact 
Amy Finnerty at (615) 576-6800. Please return the completed questionnaire in the enclosed postage-paid envelope 
by July 17, 1991. If the envelope is missing, please return to:

Technology Assessment of Alternative Media 
for Full-Text Delivery
During 1991, 15,293 non-classified Department of Energy (DOE) research and development (R&D) 
reports were received by the Office of Scientific and Technical Information, primarily in printed form, and 
an additional 4,355 reports were provided through bilateral agreements in the form of microfiche, 
representing a total of 19,648 unique documents that were reproduced and distributed in microfiche 
format to all microfiche customers. Of these, 12,667 reports were distributed to GPO Depository Libraries. 
Distribution of these documents is based on areas of interest, as indicated by the customer. The full set of 
DOE documents is provided to relatively few sites.
Estimated Electronic Storage Requirement
Based on an average of 1.4 microfiche per document and 98 pages per microfiche, for 19,648 
documents, there is an average of approximately 138 pages per document for an approximate total of 
2,711,424 pages.
1.4 fiche x 98 frames per fiche = 138 pages per report (average)
138 pages x 19,648 reports = 2,711,424 pages
Assuming 60 lines of text to a page and 80 printed characters per line as a worst case, there are 4,800 
possible characters per page representing a total storage requirement for 13,014,835,200 characters, 
more than 13 gigabytes (GB) for a full year of STI full-text data, in ASCII format.
60 lines x 80 columns = 4,800 characters per page
4,800 characters per page x 2,711,424 pages = 13,014,835,200 characters
However, calculations concerning pure text do not fully address the issue of required storage space for 
R&D reports. Many of the reports received in the course of a year include significant numbers of graphs, 
tables, and pictorial data without which the text of the report would be of little value. These types of data 
must be scanned and converted to analog data files known as image files.
Image data requires enormous storage capacity. Given that a letter-sized document of 8.5 by 11 inches 
represents 93 square inches, at a relatively low resolution of 200 dots per inch (dpi), this represents 
3.72 million bits or 465,000 characters. Using the worst case of 4,800 characters of text per page, it can 
be shown that image data requires at least 97 times as much storage capacity as text data.
200 dots per inch x 200 dots per inch = 40,000 dots per square Inch
40,000 dots per square inch x 93 square inches per page = 3,720,000 dots per page
In computer terminology, a dot is equivalent to a bit, and a single character is composed of eight bits. We 
can therefore show that a full page image at 200 dpi represents the equivalent of 465,000 characters:
3,720,00 bits 
---------------------------= 465,000 characters per page 
8 bits per character
Using the results of these calculations and the worst case estimate for the number of characters per 
page, it can be shown that the minimum storage equivalence ratio between image data of a relatively low 
N-l


Accessing USDOE Scientific and Technical Information
Appendix N
resolution and text data is approximately 97 to 1. Please note that as the resolution quality of the image 
increases or the number of text characters per page decreases, this equivalence ratio will increase 
dramatically.
465,000 characters of image data
4,800 characters of text data
This storage requirement can be reduced through the application of data compression techniques. 
Software currently exists that will compress image data by as much as 90% with minimal loss of 
resolution. Based on a 90% compression ratio, the 465,000 character per page storage requirement can 
be reduced to the equivalent of approximately 46,500 characters.
465,000 characters - (465,000 characters x 90%) = 46,500 characters
Using a similar approach, one can show that at 300 dpi resolution the per page storage requirement will 
be approximately 104,625 characters. This represents an increase of 225% in storage capacity. Similarly, 
at an even higher resolution of 400 dpi, the storage capacity requirement increases to 186,000 
characters, a 400% increase over the 200 dpi, storage requirement and a 178% increase over the 
300-dpi requirement.
Even using data compression techniques, image data requires at least 10 times the storage required by 
text data. Based on past experience, 10-15% of the data contained in research and development reports 
consists of tables, graphs, and pictorial data, which must be stored as images.
If 15% is used as a worst case, it is possible to estimate that portion of the previously calculated 13 GB 
estimated storage requirement which must be adjusted to reflect the presence of image data as follows:
13 GB of storage x 15% = =1.95 GB anticipated image data
Using the fact that image data requires approximately 10 times as much storage as text data it is possible 
to estimate the storage requirement for technical report image data:
1.95 GB x 10 = 19.5 GB of storage required for image data
Subtracting the 1.95 GB representing image data from the previous combined estimate of 13 GB, the 
estimated storage requirement for text data is approximately 11 GB.
13 GB - 1.95 GB = =11 GB required for text data
Combining the estimated storage requirement for text data and the estimated storage requirement for 
image data, the total estimated full text storage requirement for one year of scientific and technical 
information (STI) data is 30.5 GB.
11 GB of text + 19.5 GB of images = 30.5 GB of full text
Information flow, like any other process, has its highs and lows. Some years more data are received than 
other years. The statistical data used in these calculations represent an average based on the experience 
of many years of processing STI data and should therefore be reasonably accurate.
A recent and widely cited Association for Information and Image Management (AlIM) study has found that 
95% of the information stored by U.S. businesses is still on paper. Only 1% is online in any form, with the 
remaining 4% on microfilm or on offline magnetic media.1 Obviously, paper documents will always be with 
N-2

us; however, one would expect that as electronic media technology matures, a much greater percentage 
of this document storage will migrate from paper to the newer media.
Magnetic Tape
Based on an estimated storage capacity of 200 megabytes (MB) per 3600-foot reel of 9-track tape at 
6,250 bits-per-inch (bpi), 153 reels of magnetic tape would be required to store 30.5 GB of full-text 
information. This represents storage necessary for the data included in the documents themselves; it 
does not include any indexing information.
The initial cost of so many magnetic tapes and the shipping cost, which must be born by the customer, 
would probably be sufficient to eliminate 9-track magnetic tape as a likely distribution media. Other 
distribution problems associated with this media include sensitivity to magnetic fields, sensitivity to 
adverse temperature and humidity conditions that may occur during shipping, and the physical bulk of 
such a large number of tapes.
Floppy Disk
Due to the physical volume of STI data, the currently available floppy disk medium does not provide a 
viable distribution option. The 3.5-inch floppy disk has a capacity of 1.4 MB. Distribution of a single copy 
of full-text STI data would require 21,786 of these disks, which would be somewhat impractical.
However, some of the newer technologies include the utilization of laser-controlled read/write heads for 
floppy drives, also known as “floptical” disks. The accuracy of the laser makes it possible to significantly 
increase the storage potential of a floppy disk. Current technology in this area makes it possible to store 
as much as 21 MB of data on a 3.5-inch floppy disk.
Assuming the previously noted worst case storage requirements, it would be possible to store 31 STI 
reports on a single 21-MB floptical disk:
21 MB available storage 
----------------------------------= 4,375 pages
4,800 bytes per page
As this technology progresses, floppy-based media utilizing optical technology may become an 
acceptable option for distributing limited subsets of full-text STI data; however, this medium will not be 
suitable for distribution of large-scale full-text data in the foreseeable future.
Microfilm
Microfilm, in the form of microfiche, is currently the medium of choice for distribution of the nearly 20,000 
R&D reports received each year from both domestic and foreign sources. Each report requires 
approximately 1.4 sheets of microfiche. Based on the utilization of 98 frames per fiche, it can be 
estimated that each report contains about 138 pages.
Microfilm is an old, established technology for storing images. Its archival quality, compact storage format, 
and reproduction capabilities have been major selling points for the technology for years. However, the 
years and advancing technology are beginning to catch up with this venerable medium. As the years pass 
and more and more documents are preserved on microfilm, even considering the small footprint of a 
basic microfilm storage cabinet, the space requirement for historical stores of microfilm is becoming 
prodigious. This is particularly true for those Depository Libraries that attempt to maintain these files 
beyond five years.
In response to a recently conducted survey, space restrictions were cited as a major problem by virtually 
every responding library. At least one library indicated that they were no longer receiving Department of

the loss of microfiche through physical misfiling.
As imaging moves more into the data processing realm and out of the records management realm 
microfilm will lose ground as an option. Even in some situations where microfilm is the technically superior

In the course of normal day-to-day business, and especially in times of economic slowdown and 
decreasing budgets, organizations such as government offices and Depository Libraries must take steos 
to reduce their overhead by performing their missions as economically as possible. These XderXns 
and the overall costs associated with telecommunications and system access make online access less 
appealing to users not located at the host site.

Accessing USDOE Scientific and Technical Information
Appendix N
In a recent survey of 1,065 Depository Libraries, the specific area of cost was identified by respondents 
as a major factor affecting online access. To encourage external online database access, it would be 
necessary to reduce the cost threshold for system access, possibly by providing one or more free access 
800 series telephone numbers and reducing the cost of CPU access and disk storage. Cost-recovery 
procedures are somewhat impractical and counterproductive for systems that are receiving minimal 
usage.
Respondents to the survey also indicated that some of the search and retrieval mechanisms provided by 
certain of the gateways and online systems were somewhat less than user friendly and difficult to use, 
particularly with respect to Boolean logic-type searches. This has always been a complaint made by 
personnel external to any local site and is probably the result of an understandable lack of knowledge 
regarding the data set, the historical litany surrounding the accumulation of the data, or the basic use for 
which the data collection was originally intended. These factors need to be addressed and incorporated 
into user interfaces and training processes designed specifically for external users. If the system is made 
easy to use and the cost of access is not prohibitive, people will use it; otherwise they will not.
With the development of the National Research and Educational Network (NREN), agencies will have a 
wider range of options for the dissemination of government information. Indeed, in the future, it may be 
easier and less expensive to simply provide access to an agency database via NREN than to produce 
that database on CD-ROM.3
CD-ROM
CD-ROM technology has been shown to be quite effective as a distribution medium for full-text 
documents. The recent proliferation of commercially available software specifically designed to assist 
relatively unsophisticated users in the creation of CD-ROM discs has greatly simplified the process of 
converting digitally stored data to a format suitable for use as a CD-ROM application. Software is also 
available for inclusion on the CD-ROM disc that will utilize indexes created as the digital data are 
prepared for loading onto the CD-ROM media, so that keyword and Boolean search operations may be 
performed.
At this point, CD-ROM technology provides a storage capacity of approximately 660 MB, or 660 million 
characters, on a 4.7-inch disc. This is certainly a significant achievement in storage capacity, and the 
ability to search for and retrieve full-text data in a relatively rapid manner from such a large collection is 
quite impressive. One specific application available on the commercial market provides approximately 
70,000 magazine articles in full text, including user-friendly software to allow the user to search the data 
set and the related indexes, all on a single disc.
It has been estimated that the indexing necessary to perform keyword and Boolean type searches in full-
text data can require 35 to 50% as much storage as the data itself, depending on the level and type of 
indexing.4 Assuming a worst case storage requirement of 50% of the size of the full-text data for the 
indexes and the retrieval software, available storage on the CD-ROM disc is reduced to 440 MB.
Based on previously provided calculations, the estimated electronic storage requirement for a one-year 
window of DOE R&D reports is 30.5 GB. If we assume the worst case storage requirement of 50% of the 
total full-text storage requirement for index storage, it can be shown that full-text distribution of DOE R&D 
reports as a single data set, including image data, could require as many as 70 CD-ROM discs, using 
current CD-ROM technology.

Appendix N
One option for providing STI data on CD-ROM might be to divide the data into finite sets based on subject 
area(s) that might be small enough to be stored effectively on a single CD-ROM. This would allow the 
user to narrow the search to a specific area while eliminating the need for a jukebox (described later). 
This method of generating CD-ROM applications has the disadvantage that separate inquiries would have 
to be made to retrieve common data related to subjects that may span multiple areas of interest existing 
on separate discs.
Optical Disc
Optical discs utilize a technology similar to that of the CD-ROM, the primary difference being the physical 
size of the disc. Optical discs are available in two sizes, 12 inch and 14 inch. The increased physical size 
of the disc provides additional storage capacity, as much as 1 GB of data per side at this time.
Despite its larger storage capacity, the optical disc technology has not yet enjoyed the acceptance that 
the CD-ROM technology has. Of the 1,065 libraries surveyed only 1.5% indicated that they were using 
optical discs, and most indicated a preference for the CD-ROM format.
Jukebox
A jukebox is a mechanical device that is capable of manipulating a store of multiple media, either in 
CD-ROM, optical disc, or tape format. Using a robotic operation similar to that employed by its namesake, 
the jukebox is capable of selecting a specific disc or tape from storage and loading that medium into a 
drive for access by a computer system. The jukebox technology can provide unattended access to 
enormous data sets.
The largest capacity jukebox currently available is the Cygnet Systems Series 1800 Expandable Jukebox 
system, which supports the new ATG Gigadisc GD 9001 optical drive. The incorporation of the 9-GB 
12-inch ATG platter expands the capacity of the jukebox to 1.27 terabytes (1,270 GB).5
Imaging
In a way, document imaging systems are publishing systems running in reverse; publishing systems 
electronically format pages to be printed on paper, while document imaging systems capture paper pages 
via scanners and turn them into digital bitmap (raster) files. These page images are indexed in a 
document database for retrieval on a computer screen or terminal.1
Images represent more or less accurate representations of original documents. The level of accuracy is 
determined by the density at which the document is scanned. Scanners view documents as “light” and 
“dark” areas that are measured in terms of dots per inch (dpi). The higher the number of dots per inch, the 
higher the quality of the image will be when it is reproduced from the dot matrix or bitmap produced by the 
scanner. Higher quality is obtained at the cost of greatly increased storage requirements and reduced 
rates of throughput in terms of pages scanned per minute. Scanners usually operate at either 100, 200, 
300, or 400 dpi (100 dpi is the lower resolution and 400 dpi is the higher resolution image).
As noted earlier, images require enormous storage capacity. A letter-sized document of 8.5 by 11 inches 
(similar to the international standard A4 format) represents 93 square inches. At a resolution of 200 dpi, 
this represents 3.72 million bits or 465,000 characters. Based on these calculations, a letter-sized 
document stored as an image contains data equivalent to about 800 letters or memos created on a word 
processor.6
It is currently possible to store text data in digital (readable) format and graphics data such as charts, 
drawings, and pictures as image data, linking the two types of data together using hyperlinks, so that the 
original document may be reproduced by recombining the different types of data. While this method 
requires less storage than full imaging, current technology may not have progressed to the point that 
imaging in this form is a practical option for the dissemination of STI data.

Optical Tape
A developing technology that is new to the industry, not in concept but in terms of an actually functioning 
device, is the Optical Tape Drive. This device is capable of storing 1 terabyte (1,000 GB) of data on a 
single tape. According to the March 1992 issue of CD-ROM Professional magazine, only one of these 
devices had been shipped at that time, and four more were on order.
Access speed for this device is quite good in comparison with other tape units. CD-ROM Professional 
magazine states that the drive is capable of searching the entire length of the tape in 60 seconds and 
retrieving any given record in 28 seconds. This is certainly slow in comparison with magnetic disk speeds 
(which are measured in milliseconds), but it is quite significant for a tape device.
As with any new technology this product needs a little time to mature. The serial nature of the storage 
of data on an optical tape will not lend itself to repetitive direct searching of the type associated with 
CD-ROM discs, using current software and hardware access methods. However, with the inexorable 
advance of time come new ideas and methodologies. Optical tape may yet prove a useful tool in the 
dissemination of STI data.
Live Optical Disc System
The term “Live Optical Disc System” refers to a hardware system consisting of a number of disc drives, 
each specifically designed to access a series of optical discs simultaneously, similar to the operation of 
multi-platter magnetic disks. A live optical disc system is different from a jukebox system in that the total 
data collection is always online and available for use.
A primary disadvantage of a jukebox system is the fact that not all of the discs are online. Some are 
stored within the hardware until needed (known as “near line” storage), at which time they are retrieved 
and loaded on the system mechanically. On a multi-user system, this mode of operation creates a 
situation in which users requesting data located on a disc that is not currently online are placed in a 
queue until the requested disc is made available by the jukebox hardware.
Using a live optical disc system, there will be no waiting for a disc to be loaded; the entire data set is 
always online. This provides an efficient user interface to a virtually unlimited data set, depending on the 
number of disc units available. The tremendous storage capacity of the optical disc will make online 
access to full-text and image format data possible.
The completion of the national fiber-optic telephone network will provide the capability to transfer 
previously unheard of quantities of data at extremely high rates. Using this technology together with the 
live optical disc system technology, it will be possible to implement a single source database for full-text 
DOE STI data that would be available for online search and retrieval operations. High transmission 
speeds would improve the cost-effectiveness of downloading full-text data from the single source 
database to the user’s local system for further processing as necessary.
Given these anticipated technological advances and decreased costs for online access over the next few 
years, the libraries may find that it is more cost-effective overall to simply provide online access to the 
database(s) than to attempt to deal with as many as 70 CD-ROM discs a year and the associated 
hardware costs. The ability to download full-text data at gigabit transfer rates will become attractive to 
users, as will the related reduction in communication costs.
Conclusions
Based on the recently conducted survey of Depository Libraries, it is quite clear that the CD-ROM format 
is the dissemination method preferred by the libraries. The CD-ROM format requires less space, data 
cannot be misfiled or damaged as easily as microfiche or paper, and Boolean-type search capabilities 
and rapid query response make the medium popular with patrons.

Most of the reports currently being received are in the form of printed documents or microfiche. This 
means that it will become necessary to make arrangements with each of the organizations providing 
reports to transfer data in digital form or acquire the technology to scan more than 2.7 million pages per 
year either in-house or through a contractor. In the future, the availability of high-speed 
telecommunications via the fiber-optic network will make it practical to transmit such large segments of 
full-text data over the telephone line, making it possible to receive these reports from their originators in 
electronic form, thereby largely eliminating the need for scanning operations.
A further consideration is the fact that many of the reports include graphic or pictorial data that are 
absolutely necessary to the intellectual content of the document. In some of these cases the text would be 
of little use without the related graphic or pictorial data. This incorporates another level of complexity—the 
need to combine text and non-text data, a process known as imaging.
As previously noted, to incorporate image data even at a very low resolution requires significant space for 
the storage of the bitmap generated by a scanner. Increasing the required storage area increases the 
number of CD-ROM discs required to hold the data. Imaging also adds a level of complexity to the search 
and retrieval software; hyperlinks are required to associate the essentially analog bitmaps with the digital 
text data so that both may be retrieved and displayed together.
These are, of course, technologies that currently exist; however, they have rarely been applied to a task 
as large as 30_5 GB of data. Admittedly, this is a calculated “worst case” figure, but it is not necessarily an 
rnao J;?Ure ?0?Slderin9 the enormity Of such a ful|-text Pr°Ject- would probably be better to enter the 
CD-ROM Production arena on a somewhat less grandiose scale and allow the developing technologies 
such as CD-ROM and fiber-optic communications to evolve to a state in which large guantities of data can 
be readily accessed and evaluated and rapidly transferred if need be.
A more realistic short-term goal might be to produce a CD-ROM containing a 12- month-plus window of 
abstracts, rather than full text. This set of data could easily be loaded onto a single CD-ROM, 
including additional data for inclusion in the indexes for searching. Such a CD-ROM product would 
resolve one of the major problems identified by the libraries relating to microfiche distribution: the difficulty 
of locating desired data within the microfiche file. 
y
The abstract CD-ROM would essentially provide an index into the microfiche file, based on the abstract 
number, while providing personnel involved with the process valuable experience in creating a CD-ROM 
product and utilizing the technology. In the future, it will be possible for users to access the proposed online 
live optical disc system to retrieve their data in full text, rather than or in addition to utilizing a microfiche file.
Throughout this paper an issue that continually comes to the forefront is the requirement for enormous 
data storage capability on any given distribution media. It would be possible to reduce the need to 
distribute such enormous sets of data if a single source for access to full-text documents were provided 
through an online interface that could be used to rapidly retrieve full-text data in a cost-effective manner.
Such a system would allow users to review the data on a terminal or download the data from the source 
system to their local system for further processing. This capability does not yet exist; however, with the 
development and implementation of a live optical disc system and the advent of fiber-optic 
c°mmun|cat|ons making high-speed data transmission more and more available as these networks are 
installed across the country, the eventual availability of the described capability becomes more and more 
a reality. Improved speed and reduced cost will tend to make online systems more appealing to users and 
will reduce but will not eliminate the need for the physical distribution process.
When users are able to access an online system that provides the capability to perform search and 
retrieval operations on full-text data, including the ability to actually download selected full-text data to 
their local systems for further analysis and processing, the requirement for distribution services will 
dimmish. However, this capability is an issue for the future.

Finally, it should be noted that not all of the media authorities are in agreement regarding the life expectancy 
of optical media in their present form. Estimates of the archival life span of CD-ROM products range from 
5 to 100 years, depending on the current source of the estimate. This is reminiscent of the arguments heard 
30 to 40 years ago concerning the life expectancy of microfilm. Only time will provide the answer to this 
question.
Recommendation
Nearly all of the sources utilized during the development of this paper have basically agreed that optical 
technology (particularly CD-ROM), image processing, and open systems are the rising technologies of the 
office of the future. It would be well for an organization to begin to position itself to accommodate the 
anticipated needs and requirements of advancing technology in these areas.
In the short term, to gain initial entry and necessary experience in the general area of CD-ROM 
production, digital data that is immediately available on in-house computer systems in the form of R&D 
abstract information could be used as a pilot CD-ROM project to produce a searchable index for the full-
text data currently being distributed on microfiche. Such a project would provide two immediate benefits:
• Involved personnel would be provided an opportunity to gain knowledge and experience related to 
the process of creating a CD-ROM product without the additional burden of having to scan existing 
documents and microfilm to generate digital data.
• Providing an index for the fiche in CD-ROM format would at least partially address one of the 
specific concerns expressed by the surveyed libraries concerning the difficulty in using the 
microfiche distribution media.
As more experience is gained in preparing and organizing data for CD-ROM implementation through the 
vehicle of the Pilot Project, ongoing efforts should be undertaken to identify and evaluate existing and 
future options for obtaining STI data in digital full-text format. The most cost-effective long-term option(s) 
should be determined, whether it be performing the function in-house or through a contractor or service 
bureau, and a plan of action to initiate such activities should be formulated.
Consideration should be given to the form of storage selected for scanned data. Since R&D reports do 
not change, the best medium for storage would probably be optical discs utilizing the WORM (write once, 
read many) technology. It should be determined how graphic and pictorial data are to be handled, either 
as full-page images or as a multimedia application involving both digital and analog data.
Online systems capabilities should continue to be upgraded. The incorporation of a live optical disc 
system utilizing high-capacity optical discs should be implemented to begin to make full-text data 
available through the online user interface systems. The technologies necessary to accomplish this are 
still developing. The fiber-optic systems necessary to make the transmission of full-text data over 
telephone lines feasible have not yet been installed throughout the country. Organizations should position 
themselves to take advantage of this capability as soon as it becomes available.
Optical technologies are still developing, with new breakthroughs being announced on nearly a daily 
basis. It is difficult to make informed judgments as to the state of the art of computer science very far into 
the future. This is particularly true in light of the advent of the 64-bit computer technology that is about to 
be unleashed upon the industry. It is possible that the processing capabilities of these RISC (reduced 
instruction set computer) systems will enhance the speed of processing to the extent that state-of-the-art 
systems of today may be considered unusable in a relatively short period of time.
Given the rapid advancements experienced over recent months, the best recommendation for future 
dissemination activities would be to begin to gain experience through the production of a CD-ROM 
containing recent R&D abstracts, building on that experience to eventually, overtime, produce full-text or 
image format products for R&D reports.
