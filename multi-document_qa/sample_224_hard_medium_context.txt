Strong outbound and international momentum amid moderate domestic travel; 
margin could sustain
TCOM delivered a solid quarter, with 1Q revenue (+29% yoy) / adjusted net income 
(+96% yoy) coming in 2%/45% above market expectations, thanks to a faster 
outbound travel recovery, stronger operating leverage and equity gains of affiliates. 
Major business lines remain solid, thanks to resilient travel demand: 1) outbound 
travel maintained strong momentum, thanks to the relaxation of visa requirements 
amid a recovery in international flight capacity; 2) the international platform, 
Trip.com, continued to gain traction in key Asian markets; and 3) the domestic 
business stayed healthy, driven by solid volume growth, but partly offset by a yoy 
decline in hotel ADR. Looking into 2Q, we expect outbound and international 
business to continue to outperform, and we expect sector-leading growth, despite 
moderate growth in the domestic arm (bearing in mind the ongoing soft hotel ADR). 
Regarding TCOM's margin, we raise our FY24E adjusted OPM to 30% (from 29% 
previously), factoring in stronger operating efficiency and leverage. Accordingly, 
we raise our FY24/25 revenue forecasts by 2%/2% and our adjusted net income 
estimates 
by 
9%/8%, 
increasing 
our 
target 
price 
to 
HK$513. 
Our 
target 
price 
implies 
22x/20x FY24/25 P/E. Beyond pent-up demand, the company envisions multiple 
long-term opportunities through: 1) rising user penetration in lower-tier cities, 2) an 
improving cross-selling ratio, 3) capturing the silver generation's travel demand, 4) 
the inbound travel recovery, and 5) international expansion. We maintain Buy.
Domestic: solid volume growth, partly offset by weak hotel ADR
Domestic travel activities held up well, with hotel and air ticket booking volume 
both growing by 20%+ in 1Q. However, hotel ADR (average daily rate) declined yoy, 
due to: 1) travel preferences shifting toward outbound destinations and lower-tier 
cities, and 2) rising hotel supplies. In 2Q, the trend has persisted, with Trip.com 
witnessing double-digit yoy qtd travel bookings (yet ADR weakness may linger).
Outbound: still growing robustly
Outbound travel hotel and air bookings both grew by 100%+ yoy in 1Q. Countries 
offering free visas to Chinese travelers (such as Singapore, Malaysia, Thailand, and 
the GCC countries) are top destinations. Management remains confident, as it 
believes that the next leg of growth could come from a recovery in long-haul 
destinations during the upcoming summer holiday.

International business: significant potential for Trip.com
Revenue from TCOM's global online travel agency (OTA) platform increased by 
c.80% yoy in 1Q. Roughly 70% of its revenue was from Asian markets, and hotel 
bookings contributed 35%+. Management noted that Asia's travel market size is 
~1.5x that of China, and Trip.com aims to become a leading regional player, 
leveraging its unique advantages: 1) a one-stop shopping platform, 2) competitive 
pricing offerings (thanks to the group's well established supplier relationship), and 
3) superior customer service/user experience.
New opportunities
1) Inbound travel: inbound travel bookings surged by 400% yoy in 1Q, now 
contributing c.20% of Trip.com's revenue. Management envisions significant 
potential for inbound travel, with an up to multi-trillion RMB potential market size; 
2) silver generation travel: the company believes that silver generation travel is also 
a growing area, with market potential of RMB1tn. The company has introduced 
several tailor-made products (such as Old Friends Club) to capture the 
opportunities. The silver generation currently accounts for 10% of the company's 
total user base.

Valuation and risks
We use a DCF valuation to derive our target price, adopting WACC of 8.5% (vs. 9% 
previously), assuming a risk-free rate of 2.5% (vs. 3% previously), an equity risk 
premium of 6%, and a terminal growth rate of 3%. Downside risks: macro 
uncertainties, slower industry growth, the pace of international expansion, 
investment in Tier 3-5 cities, couponing, lower take rates on hotels, and higher 
marketing spend in a more intense competitive environment.

Bank'). Though the information herein is believed to be reliable and has been obtained from public sources believed to be 
reliable, Deutsche Bank makes no representation as to its accuracy or completeness. Hyperlinks to third-party websites in this 
report are provided for reader convenience only. Deutsche Bank neither endorses the content nor is responsible for the

Effective 
13 
October 
2023, 
Deutsche 
Bank 
AG 
acquired 
Numis 
Corporation 
Plc 
and 
its 
subsidiaries 
(the 
"Numis 
Group"). 
Numis 
Securities Limited ("NSL") is a member of the Numis Group and a firm authorised and regulated by the Financial Conduct 
Authority (Firm Reference Number: 144822). Deutsche Bank AG provides clients with, amongst other services, Investment 
Research services. NSL provides clients with, amongst other services, non-independent research services.
During an initial integration process, the research departments of Deutsche Bank AG and NSL will remain operationally 
distinct. Consequently, disclosures relating to conflicts of interest that may exist for Deutsche Bank AG and/or its affiliates do 
not currently take into account the business and activities of the Numis Group. The conflicts of interest that may exist for the 
Numis Group, in relation to the provision of research, can be found on the Numis website at https://www.numis.com/legal-
and-regulatory/conditions-and-disclaimers-that-govern-research-contained-in-the-research-pages-of-this-website. 
The 
disclosures on this Numis webpage do not currently take into account the business and activities of Deutsche Bank AG and/or 
its affiliates which are not members of the Numis Group.
Additionally, any detailed conflicts of interest disclosures pertaining to a specific recommendation or estimate made on a 
security mentioned in this report or which have been included in our most recently published company report or found on our 
global disclosure look-up page, do not currently take into account the business and activities of the Numis Group. Instead, 
details of detailed conflicts of interest disclosures for the Numis Group, relating to specific issuers or securities, can be found 
at: https://library.numis.com/regulatory_notice. The issuer/security-specific conflict of interest disclosures on this Numis 
webpage do not take into account the business and activities of Deutsche Bank and/or its affiliates which are not members 
of the Numis Group.
If you use the services of Deutsche Bank in connection with a purchase or sale of a security that is discussed in this report, or 
is included or discussed in another communication (oral or written) from a Deutsche Bank analyst,  
Deutsche Bank may act as 
principal for its own account or as agent for another person. 
Deutsche 
Bank 
may 
consider 
this 
report 
in 
deciding 
to 
trade 
as 
principal. 
 
It 
may 
also 
engage 
in 
transactions, 
for 
its 
own 
account 
or with customers, in a manner inconsistent with the views taken in this research report.  
Others within Deutsche Bank, 
including strategists, sales staff and other analysts, may take views that are inconsistent with those taken in this research 
report. Deutsche Bank issues a variety of research products, including fundamental analysis, equity-linked analysis, 
quantitative analysis and trade ideas. Recommendations contained in one type of communication may differ from 
recommendations contained in others, whether as a result of differing time horizons, methodologies, perspectives or 
otherwise. Deutsche Bank and/or its affiliates may also be holding debt or equity securities of the issuers it writes on. Analysts 
are paid in part based on the profitability of Deutsche Bank AG and its affiliates, which includes investment banking, trading 
and principal trading revenues. 
Opinions, estimates and projections constitute the current judgment of the author as of the date of this report. They do not 
necessarily reflect the opinions of Deutsche Bank and are subject to change without notice. Deutsche Bank provides liquidity 
for buyers and sellers of securities issued by the companies it covers. Deutsche Bank research analysts sometimes have 
shorter-term trade ideas that may be inconsistent with Deutsche Bank's existing longer-term ratings. Some trade ideas for 
equities are listed as Catalyst Calls on the Research Website (https://research.db.com/Research/) , and can be found on the 
general coverage list and also on the covered company's page. A Catalyst Call represents a high-conviction belief by an analyst 
that a stock will outperform or underperform the market and/or a specified sector over a time frame of no less than two weeks 
and no more than three months. In addition to Catalyst Calls, analysts may occasionally discuss with our clients, and with 
Deutsche Bank salespersons and traders, trading strategies or ideas that reference catalysts or events that may have a near-
term or medium-term impact on the market price of the securities discussed in this report, which impact may be directionally 
counter to the analysts' current 12-month view of total return or investment return as described herein. Deutsche Bank has 
no obligation to update, modify or amend this report or to otherwise notify a recipient thereof if an opinion, forecast or estimate 
changes or becomes inaccurate. Coverage and the frequency of changes in market conditions and in both general and 
company-specific economic prospects make it difficult to update research at defined intervals.  
Updates are at the sole 
discretion of the coverage analyst or of the Research Department Management, and the majority of reports are published at 
irregular intervals. This report is provided for informational purposes only and does not take into account the particular 
investment objectives, financial situations, or needs of individual clients. It is not an offer or a solicitation of an offer to buy or 
sell any financial instruments or to participate in any particular trading strategy. Target prices are inherently imprecise and a 
product of the analyst's judgment.  
The financial instruments discussed in this report may not be suitable for all investors, and 
investors must make their own informed investment decisions. Prices and availability of financial instruments are subject to 
change without notice, and investment transactions can lead to losses as a result of price fluctuations and other factors.  
If a 
financial instrument is denominated in a currency other than an investor's currency, a change in exchange rates may adversely 
affect the investment.  
Past performance is not necessarily indicative of future results. Performance calculations exclude 
transaction costs, unless otherwise indicated. Unless otherwise indicated, prices are current as of the end of the previous 
trading session and are sourced from local exchanges via Reuters, Bloomberg and other vendors.  
Data is also sourced from 
Deutsche Bank, subject companies, and other parties.

organizational arrangements and information barriers we have to prevent and avoid conflicts of interest with respect to our 
research are available on our website (https://research.db.com/Research/) under Disclaimer. 
Macroeconomic fluctuations often account for most of the risks associated with exposures to instruments that promise to pay 
fixed or variable interest rates. For an investor who is long fixed-rate instruments (thus receiving these cash flows), increases 
in interest rates naturally lift the discount factors applied to the expected cash flows and thus cause a loss. The longer the 
maturity of a certain cash flow and the higher the move in the discount factor, the higher will be the loss. Upside surprises in 
inflation, fiscal funding needs, and FX depreciation rates are among the most common adverse macroeconomic shocks to 
receivers. But counterparty exposure, issuer creditworthiness, client segmentation, regulation (including changes in assets 
holding limits for different types of investors), changes in tax policies, currency convertibility (which may constrain currency 
conversion, repatriation of profits and/or liquidation of positions), and settlement issues related to local clearing houses are 
also important risk factors. The sensitivity of fixed-income instruments to macroeconomic shocks may be mitigated by 
indexing the contracted cash flows to inflation, to FX depreciation, or to specified interest rates - these are common in 
emerging markets.  
The index fixings may - by construction - lag or mis-measure the actual move in the underlying variables 
they are intended to track. The choice of the proper fixing (or metric) is particularly important in swaps markets, where floating 
coupon rates (i.e., coupons indexed to a typically short-dated interest rate reference index) are exchanged for fixed coupons. 
Funding in a currency that differs from the currency in which coupons are denominated carries FX risk. Options on swaps 
(swaptions) the risks typical to options in addition to the risks related to rates movements. 
Derivative transactions involve numerous risks including market, counterparty default and illiquidity risk.  
The appropriateness 
of these products for use by investors depends on the investors' own circumstances, including their tax position, their 
regulatory environment and the nature of their other assets and liabilities; as such, investors should take expert legal and 
financial advice before entering into any transaction similar to or inspired by the contents of this publication. The risk of loss 
in futures trading and options, foreign or domestic, can be substantial. As a result of the high degree of leverage obtainable 
in futures and options trading, losses may be incurred that are greater than the amount of funds initially deposited - up to 
theoretically unlimited losses. Trading in options involves risk and is not suitable for all investors. Prior to buying or selling an 
option, investors must review the 'Characteristics and Risks of Standardized Options", at https://www.theocc.com/company-
information/documents-and-archives/publications. If you are unable to access the website, please contact your Deutsche 
Bank representative for a copy of this important document.
Participants in foreign exchange transactions may incur risks arising from several factors, including the following: (i) exchange 
rates can be volatile and are subject to large fluctuations; (ii) the value of currencies may be affected by numerous market 
factors, 
including 
world 
and 
national 
economic, 
political 
and 
regulatory 
events, 
events 
in 
equity 
and 
debt 
markets 
and 
changes 
in interest rates; and (iii) currencies may be subject to devaluation or government-imposed exchange controls, which could 
affect the value of the currency. Investors in securities such as ADRs, whose values are affected by the currency of an 
underlying security, effectively assume currency risk. 
Unless governing law provides otherwise, all transactions should be executed through the Deutsche Bank entity in the 
investor's home jurisdiction. Aside from within this report, important conflict disclosures can also be found at https://

Backtested, hypothetical or simulated performance results have inherent limitations. Unlike an actual performance record 
based on trading actual client portfolios, simulated results are achieved by means of the retroactive application of a backtested 
model itself designed with the benefit of hindsight. Taking into account historical events the backtesting of performance also 
differs from actual account performance because an actual investment strategy may be adjusted any time, for any reason, 
including a response to material, economic or market factors. The backtested performance includes hypothetical results that 
do not reflect the reinvestment of dividends and other earnings or the deduction of advisory fees, brokerage or other 
commissions, 
and 
any 
other 
expenses 
that 
a 
client 
would

paid. 
No 
representation 
is 
made 
that 
any 
trading 
strategy or account will or is likely to achieve profits or losses similar to those shown. Alternative modeling techniques or 
assumptions might produce significantly different results and prove to be more appropriate. Past hypothetical backtest results 
are neither an indicator nor guarantee of future returns. Actual results will vary, perhaps materially, from the analysis.
The method for computing individual E,S,G and composite ESG scores set forth herein is a novel method developed by the 
Research department within Deutsche Bank AG, computed using a systematic approach without human intervention. 
Different data providers, market sectors and geographies approach ESG analysis and incorporate the findings in a variety of 
ways.  
As such, the ESG scores referred to herein may differ from equivalent ratings developed and implemented by other ESG 
data providers in the market and may also differ from equivalent ratings developed and implemented by other divisions within 
the Deutsche Bank Group.  
Such ESG scores also differ from other ratings and rankings that have historically been applied in 
research reports published by Deutsche Bank AG.  
Further, such ESG scores do not represent a formal or official view of

◆ 1Q24 results showed strong beat on lower marketing spend 
and margin resilience driven by economies of scale 
◆ ADR facing pressure but more than offset by solid outbound 
travel; inbound travel could provide more room to grow 
◆ Reiterate Buy and raise TP to USD70 from USD60; strong 
top-line growth on improved efficiencies and scalability 
Strong beat for 1Q24 on lower market spend: TCOM reported strong results for 1Q24 
with the non-GAAP operating profit 19% higher than our estimate and 20% higher than 
consensus. We attribute the robust performance to the strong top-line growth (+29%  
y-o-y), led by the 29% rise in hotel reservations on market share gain and swift pickup in 
packaged tours (+129% y-o-y). Revenue from its global online travel agency (OTA) 
platform, Trip.com, was up c80% y-o-y, contributing c10% of total revenue. Marketing 
expenses were only 19% of total revenue, lower than the guidance of 22-23% and 15% 
lower than our estimate, demonstrating economies of scale. As such, the non-GAAP net 
income margin improved to 34%, the highest level for a first quarter since 2019 and 
second-highest since the pandemic, which is only shy of the peak in 3Q23 of 35.6%. 
ADR facing pressure but offset by robust outbound travel: TCOM noted that its 
domestic hotel average daily rate (ADR) is down 10% y-o-y recently due to 1) increased 
hotel supply and 2) shift in travel preference to outbound destinations and lower tier cities. 
Similarly, unit revenue from domestic air ticketing has also seen a low double-digit decline 
so far in 2Q24 due to lower revenue from value-added services (VASs) while outbound 
air ticket prices have further normalised to mid-teen increases above the 2019 level. 
However, we believe this could be more than compensated for by the strong outbound 
travel and international platform momentum. TCOM expects to channel additional 
marketing spend in 2Q24 to drive solid platform growth for Trip.com. So far in 2Q24, its 
outbound hotel revenue has recovered to 90% of the 2019 level, air ticking revenue to 
110%, and package tour revenue to 40-50%. 
Inbound travel should provide more room for growth: TCOM sees promising growth 
potential in inbound travel to China, citing the potential for GMV of RMB2trn. The Chinese 
government is lending support to promote traveling to China, such as by granting visa-
free entry for certain EU countries. We think inbound travel could provide a cushion for 
TCOM’s earnings in the off-season amid strong seasonality in China’s domestic travel. 
Inbound travel could also help to sustain mid- to high-double-digit revenue growth, which 
management expects to contribute 15-20% to total revenue in three to five years. 
Raise revenue for 2024e-26e by 1-3% and net profit by 10%: We now factor in higher 
transport revenue on stronger international growth and less marketing spend given 
improved efficiencies and scalability. 
Reiterate Buy and raise DCF-based target price to USD70 from USD60: Our higher 
estimates drive the increase in our target price. We reiterate our Buy rating as we like its 
leading domestic position and expanding overseas footprint.

Estimates changes 
We lift our revenue estimates for 2024e-26e by 1-3%, factoring in higher transport revenue on 
stronger international platform growth but  partly offset by less hotel revenue on lower ADR. We 
trim our marketing spend estimate by 4% for 2024e to reflect the improved efficiencies and 
economies of scale. We also factor in higher equity income from associates, leaving our non-
GAAP net profit estimates 10% higher for 2024e-26e. Our net profit estimates for 2024e-26e 
are 11-21% ahead of Bloomberg consensus.

Valuation and risks 
We value Trip.com.com using a DCF approach. Our WACC calculation follows our standard 
methodology of using a target debt ratio of 33.3% with reference to the company’s latest debt 
position while also factoring in the impact of the tax shield generated by borrowings. We 
assume a WACC of 9.1% based on a risk-free rate of 3.5%. We assume a mainland China 
market equity premium of 5.5% and an average beta of 1.5. We also assume a cost of debt of 
5% and marginal corporate income tax in mainland China of 25%. Our risk-free rate and 
mainland China market equity premium assumptions are provided by HSBC’s global equity 
strategy team (all unchanged). Based on the above calculations and our revised earnings 
estimates, we now derive a higher target price of USD70, up from USD60. Our revised target 
price implies c23% upside. We maintain our Buy rating. We like its market-leading position in 
domestic and outbound travel as well as its rapidly expanding international footprint.

22 May 2024 
For the local shares (9961 HK, CMP HKD436.40), we calculate a fair value target price of 
HKD546, up from HKD468, based on HSBC’s 2024 year-end USD-HKD exchange rate 
assumption of 7.80, an ADS-to-Hong Kong-listed-share conversion ratio of 1 to 1, and a US-
listed share target price of USD70.00. 
Downside risks: a macroeconomic slowdown in mainland China; intensified competition in the 
domestic online travel market; tightened regulations in mainland China’s travel market; the 
international business being affected by local market regulations; failing to maintain strong 
supplier relationships; and failing to respond to new demand or changes in demand.

Important disclosures 
Equities: Stock ratings and basis for financial analysis 
HSBC and its affiliates, including the issuer of this report (“HSBC”) believes an investor's decision to buy or sell a stock should 
depend on individual circumstances such as the investor's existing holdings, risk tolerance and other considerations and that 
investors utilise various disciplines and investment horizons when making investment decisions. Ratings should not be used or 
relied on in isolation as investment advice. Different securities firms use a variety of ratings terms as well as different rating 
systems to describe their recommendations and therefore investors should carefully read the definitions of the ratings used in 
each research report. Further, investors should carefully read the entire research report and not infer its contents from the rating 
because research reports contain more complete information concerning the analysts' views and the basis for the rating. 
From 23rd March 2015 HSBC has assigned ratings on the following basis: 
The target price is based on the analyst’s assessment of the stock’s actual current value, although we expect it to take six to 12 
months for the market price to reflect this.  When the target price is more than 20% above the current share price, the stock will 
be classified as a Buy; when it is between 5% and 20% above the current share price, the stock may be classified as a Buy or a 
Hold; when it is between 5% below and 5% above the current share price, the stock will be classified as a Hold; when it is between 
5% and 20% below the current share price, the stock may be classified as a Hold or a Reduce; and when it is more than 20% 
below the current share price, the stock will be classified as a Reduce. 
Our ratings are re-calibrated against these bands at the time of any 'material change' (initiation or resumption of coverage, change 
in target price or estimates).  
Upside/Downside is the percentage difference between the target price and the share price. 
Prior to this date, HSBC’s rating structure was applied on the following basis: 
For each stock we set a required rate of return calculated from the cost of equity for that stock’s domestic or, as appropriate, 
regional market established by our strategy team. The target price for a stock represented the value the analyst expected the 
stock to reach over our performance horizon. The performance horizon was 12 months. For a stock to be classified as Overweight, 
the potential return, which equals the percentage difference between the current share price and the target price, including the 
forecast dividend yield when indicated, had to exceed the required return by at least 5 percentage points over the succeeding 12 
months (or 10 percentage points for a stock classified as Volatile*). For a stock to be classified as Underweight, the stock was 
expected to underperform its required return by at least 5 percentage points over the succeeding 12 months (or 10 percentage 
points for a stock classified as Volatile*).  Stocks between these bands were classified as Neutral. 
*A stock was classified as volatile if its historical volatility had exceeded 40%, if the stock had been listed for less than 12 months 
(unless it was in an industry or sector where volatility is low) or if the analyst expected significant volatility.  However, stocks which 
we did not consider volatile may in fact also have behaved in such a way.  Historical volatility was defined as the past month's 
average of the daily 365-day moving average volatilities.  In order to avoid misleadingly frequent changes in rating, however, 
volatility had to move 2.5 percentage points past the 40% benchmark in either direction for a stock's status to change.

TCOM delivered another solid set of results, with 1Q24 revenue 
+29% yoy to Rmb11.9bn, toward the high end of company 
guidance. EBIT beat again, +44% yoy to Rmb3.8bn (vs. Visible 
Alpha Consensus of Rmb3.2bn) implying +3.2pts yoy margin 
expansion to 31.6% (vs. consensus of 27
.3%) on 
better-than-expected operational efﬁciency as its product 
development and G&A expense ratios dropped both yoy and 
on a sequential basis to 24.3%/6.2% (vs. 26.2%/6.5% in 4Q23 
and 27
.1%/7
.9% in 1Q23). Amid the strong travel demand esp. 
during the CNY holidays and more benign competitive 
environment (e.g., Meituan/Douyin reportedly have scaled back 
their promotional activities), the company did not have to 
spend as much on sales & marketing (-1% qoq), although 
management expect a reversal in 2Q24 reaching 22-23% of 
revenue (vs. 19.1% in 1Q24) by budgeting more to grow its 
overseas platform 
T
rip.com. Gross margin of 81.2% also came in 
slightly above our estimate of 80% and the 4Q23 level of 80.5%. 
After the temporary setback in 4Q23, its domestic travel 
momentum picked up again with revenue up mid-teen % yoy on 
20%/30% increase in hotel room and air ticket booking. Outbound 
travel volume doubled yoy back to ~90% of pre-COVID19 levels, 
continuing to outpace ~70% for the industry. Overall, group revenue 
contribution from domestic, outbound, Trip.com and Skyscanner 
was ~68%, 15%, 10% and 7% in 1Q24 respectively, compared to 
70%, 12%, 9% and 9% in 4Q23, reﬂecting accelerated growth in 
outbound and overseas travel booking with more foreigners

arranging their China trips using Trip.com apps. 
By segments, transportation ticketing business caught up noticeably with revenue 
+20% yoy running at 149% of pre-pandemic level (vs. 118% in 4Q23) driven by robust 
domestic and outbound air travel volume (+30% and +60% yoy) though partly offset by 
lower revenue per ticket booking at 105%/115% gradually normalized from 130-150% in 
1H23. Having shifted its focus from monetization to cross-selling for other businesses 
since mid-FY23, TCOM generated less revenue from value-added services (e.g., VIP 
lounges, insurance) translating into lower effective take rate of 2% (vs. ~3% last year). 
Revenue from its accommodation reservation business increased +29% yoy also 
tracking at 149% of pre-COVID19 level (vs. 132% in 4Q23) with domestic and overseas 
hotel revenue +20% yoy and 60-70% yoy respectively on steady ADR. Contribution 
from packaged tours still lagged behind at 84% of FY19 level (vs. 88% in 4Q23) 
reﬂecting behavioral changes as more mainland Chinese choose to travel on their own 
after the pandemic. Consistent with HTHT and other hotel operators’ comments (H 
World, Jinjiang, BTG) that business travel remained quite weak during 1Q24, TCOM’s 
corporate travel revenue grew at a slower pace of 15% yoy vs. group total revenue 
growth of +29% yoy.   
On the conference call and follow-up calls we had with the company, management 
still sounded positive about the outlook for 
TCOM’s outbound travel and 
T
rip.com 
platform, but were a bit more cautious about its domestic businesses. Speciﬁcally, 
while its booking volume in China remained healthy growing at mid-teen % yoy 
for hotels and mid-single digit % yoy for air tickets respectively, prices are under 
some pressure (i.e., hotel ADR -10%, transportation revenue per ticket -10-15%) 
such that overall domestic revenue growth has slowed to mid-single digit % yoy 
in 2Qtd (vs. ~+15% yoy in 1Q24) partly due to a high base last year given the 
strong pent-up demand shortly after full border reopening. Although Chinese 
consumers are still prioritizing their spending toward “experience-seeking” and 
“emotional fulﬁllment” which should support ongoing travel/leisure demand over goods 
purchases ahead, they have become more rational and price-sensitive, with more 
people choosing to take cheaper alternatives such as short-haul trips to lower-tiered 
cities. As discussed in our recent travel tracker notes (May 7), during recent long 
holidays, travel demand also appeared to broaden out to elderly and other lower-income 
groups as reﬂected by lower average spending per traveler. On the positive side, 
continuing to beneﬁt from China’s visa-free policies with more countries abroad (e.g., 
Singapore, Malaysia, Thailand, UAE etc) and gradual recovery of air ﬂight capacity, 
TCOM’s outbound travel revenue grew strongly, up more than 70% yoy and fully 
recovered to pre-pandemic level. Its overseas OTA platform, Trip.com, also saw 
continued strong revenue growth of 50+% yoy, contributing 10% of group revenue qtd 
(vs. 7% in FY23). Management also emphasized that globalization remains one of the 
group’s long-term strategic focuses. They hope to replicate their success in China to 
elsewhere in Asia Paciﬁc, where we estimate a potential addressable travel booking 
market size of US$801bn, exceeding China’s US$772bn in FY23. For now, Trip.com 
generates the majority or over 70% of its revenue from air ticketing. As the company 
continues to invest in expanding its supply chain and adding on hotel inventory, we 
anticipate its revenue to gradually diversify into hotel business which has a higher take

rate of 8-9% (vs. 3-4% for air ticketing business). Should the company be successful 
in growing 
T
rip.com’s revenue to 20% of group total (vs. 7% last year) within say 3 
years, it could add on 3-4% revenue CAGR for 
TCOM in FY24-27E. As 
T
rip.com has 
already achieved breakeven on a pre-ﬁxed or shared cost basis, any incremental 
revenue would ﬂow through to group earnings, serving as another source of 
potential margin upside for the group (in addition to outbound travel which 
generates higher margin vs. domestic business).  
Reﬂecting the softer price trends for domestic hotels and air ticketing businesses 
in April-May, 
TCOM guides 11-16% yoy revenue growth in 2Q24 to Rmb12.5-13.1bn 
including accommodation reservation (+14-19% yoy to Rmb4.8-5.1bn), 
transportation ticketing (ﬂat to +5% yoy to Rmb4.9-5bn), packaged tours (+40-45% 
yoy to Rmb1-1.1bn) and corporate travel (+7-12% yoy to Rmb0.6bn). Based on 
steady yoy gross margin of 82%, higher sales & marketing expense (22.5% of 
revenue vs. 19.1% in 1Q24) offset by lower product development/G&A expense 
(28.2% of revenue vs. 30.4% in 1Q24), we forecast Rmb4bn non-GAAP operating 
proﬁt in 2Q24 (+16% yoy and exceeding FY19 level by 133%). For the full year, we 
maintain our revenue forecast largely unchanged at Rmb52.8bn (+19% yoy) 
including +9% yoy domestic revenue growth to Rmb36bn and ~70% yoy jump in 
both outbound travel and 
T
rip.com revenue to Rmb7
.6bn/5.6bn respectively. Lifting 
our forecast for its gross margin (from 80.4% to 81.5%) to reﬂect the strong 1Q24 
performance and management guidance, and lowering product 
development/sales & marketing expenses slightly, we model a higher EBIT margin 
of 30.1% (vs. 27
.7% previously), implying another 0.5pts yoy margin expansion 
from 29.6% in FY23. Net-net, we raise our FY24 earnings estimate by +13% to 
Rmb16bn, followed by 16% yoy growth in both FY25E and FY26E. In terms of 
capital return, the board had approved a US$300mn share repurchase quota under its 
“2024 Capital Return program” representing roughly 14% of our projected FY24E 
earnings for the company, but it has not utilized any so far in 1Q24. When asked, 
management said that it is still their intention to repurchase at least 1-2% of its o/s 
shares so as to offset the dilution from the stock option program.  
Factoring in higher margin as noted above, we revise up our FY24-26E adj. EPS for 
TCOM by +13-17% and our 12-month SOTP-based target price to US$64/HK$500 (from 
US$56/HK$439). Looking back at TCOM’s share price performance over the past 1-2 
years, the stock initially lagged behind its earnings revision momentum and was up only 
+5% last year vs. cumulative upward consensus earnings revision of +46% to Rmb13bn 
in FY23, which in our view reﬂected skepticism about the sustainability of its margin at 
close to ~30% level (vs. 18-19% originally projected). After 3-4 quarters of earnings and 
margin beat, the market appears to have become more convinced that this is 
sustainable. As a result, TCOM’s share price has risen +59% ytd. Based on our 
assumption that the group should deliver steady 15-18% revenue growth and 
~30% EBIT margin for the rest of the year, 
TCOM’s share is now trading at 17x 
FY24E P/E, arguably not as undemanding as previously and has converged with 
its global peers, such as Booking.com also trading at 17x. As such, we believe 
further upside would be predicated on its ability to deliver further revenue and/or 
margin upside. Among its four core businesses (i.e., domestic travel, Skyscanner,

outbound travel and 
T
rip.com), we see more scope for upside surprise from the 
latter two - together representing ~25% of group revenue currently. We present our 
bull and bear cases in Exhibit 10. In our bull case where we assume strong 
revenue growth driven by upside from these two segments and higher EBIT 
margin (32% vs. 30%), and apply a higher target P/E of 22x (vs. 20x P/E based on 
group core net income incl. afﬁliates in our base case), the stock could be worth 
US$77/share, implying +35% potential upside (vs. US$64 or +12% upside in our 
base case).  
Management comments and other takeaways from the conference calls: 
Accommodation 
Despite typical seasonal slowdown post CNY holidays, Trip.com’s domestic hotel 
n
business saw robust growth with room nights increased by +20% yoy to ~180% of 
FY19 level in 1Q24 (vs. 170%/160% in 3Q23/4Q23). In 2Q24 so far, their domestic 
hotel booking momentum remained healthy with room nights growth of mid-to-high 
teens % growth yoy (vs. ﬂat to slightly down yoy for the industry). That said, they’ve 
observed declining hotel ADR from late-Apr especially for higher-end hotel segments 
which they mainly attributed to (1) dilution from outbound travel among 
higher-income customers; (2) more mid-low income customers’ travel to lower-tier 
cities which offer improved and better-valued transportation and accommodation 
infrastructure; and (3) growing industry supply which has recovered to single-digit % 
above pre-COVID levels on their platform (vs. single-digit % below in 1Q23). 
Continuing the strong growth in 1Q24 at over +100% growth yoy, Outbound hotel 
n
booking has largely recovered to pre-COVID levels in 2Q24 and reached a record 
high during Labor Day holiday at +20% vs. 2019 levels. Meanwhile, average 
outbound hotel prices remain stable compared to last year. 
T
ransportation 
Domestic air ticket booking volume saw healthy growth at +30% yoy in 1Q24, inline 
n
with the industry at +28%. That said, with their strategic scaling back of VAS sales, 
revenue per ticket decreased by mid-teens % yoy. 
Similar to hotel booking, outbound air ticket booking continued to recover along with 
n
the ﬂight capacity and has been fully back to pre-COVID levels recently, 
outperforming the industry’s ~83% recovery rate in Apr. Short-haul destinations in 
ASEAN regions (i.e., Thailand, South Korea, Singapore, Malaysia) continued to lead 
the recovery thanks to visa-free policy relaxations while long-haul destinations in 
Europe (e.g., the UK, France, Italy) also saw signiﬁcant improvement during the 
Labor Day holiday. Among all those outbound destinations, the US saw the slowest 
recovery mainly restricted by ﬂight capacities which only recovered to 25% of 
pre-COVID levels as of late. On the ﬂip side, average air ticket price decreased by 
-15% tracking at ~115% of FY19 levels on Trip.com’s platform. 
Corporate travel

% yoy) in 1Q24 mainly due to weaker seasonality, and they have been continuously 
acquiring new corporate clients. While the company has seen some budget cuts for 
SOEs, they also noted that some SMEs are revising up travel budgets ytd. Overall, 
they haven’t observed a signiﬁcant slowdown of business travel demand on their 
platform. 
Outlook 
Similar to the last few quarters, management sounded optimistic about its business 
n
outlook and guided +11-16% yoy revenue growth in 2Q24. By geographies, they 
expect domestic revenue to grow at mid-single digit % yoy (vs. mid-teens % in 
1Q24) supported by healthy booking volume, more than offsetting both hotel and air 
ticket price drop. Besides, management expects both outbound business and the 
Trip.com platform to see +50-60% yoy revenue growth in 2Q24.   
As mentioned in previous calls (Feb-22), the company reiterated its strategic focus 
n
on globalization, particularly in APAC regions where they believe the potential market 
size is over 1.5 times that of the domestic China travel booking market. Positioned 
as a one-stop shop OTA platform, they have seen an increasing cross-selling ratio 
from air tickets to hotel booking which has contributed to more than 35% of total 
revenue of the Trip.com business. They believe their core competencies of (1) 
user-friendly mobile app experience; (2) full range of travel products offerings; and (3) 
24-hour global online customer service center should support their further 
expansion into the global market in the mid to long term. Furthermore, leveraging 
their dominant position and competitive product offerings in the domestic China 
market, Trip.com has also helped introduce more inbound travel which contributed to 
~20% of the platform’s revenue in 1Q24. 
Cost management and margin 
Similar to the comments in the 4Q23 results call (Feb-22), management still expect 
n
to step up marketing efforts in coming quarters mainly for the promotion of the 
Trip.com platform, especially for its air ticketing business. For 2Q24, they expect 
higher S&M expense ratio to 22-23% of total revenue (vs. 19% in 1Q23/24). Product 
development and G&A expenses are expected to stay ﬂattish qoq. Net net, we 
pencil in 31.2% EBIT margin in 2Q24 (vs. 30.8%/31.6% in 2Q23/1Q24). 
Industry trends 
As mentioned in our recent reports (H World, Labor Day holiday travel takeaways), 
n
despite a high base in 2Q23, domestic travel demand in 2Q24 has so far remained 
resilient especially during the Labor Day holiday when the total number of domestic 
travelers grew +8% yoy, representing a +28% increase vs. FY19 levels (compared 
to +19%/+12% during the CNY and Qingming holidays respectively). By segment, 
both railway and domestic air trafﬁc saw further improvement to 123%/~116% of 
2019 levels, compared to 118%/109% in Apr. On the ﬂip side, domestic hotel RevPar 
data we gathered from STR remained soft at ~-16% yoy (or ~115% of FY19 level) 
during the Labor Day holiday, similar to -14% yoy in Apr, which was mainly dragged 
by ADR decline at ~-16% yoy amid the largely recovered industry supply while the

occupancy rate held up well on a year-over-year basis. We also gathered from H 
World (May 18) that its RevPar in May MTD has caught up strongly and returned to 
positive growth vs. a slight decline in Apr partly distorted by fewer holidays this vs. 
last year. 
On outbound travel, the number of both international and regional (e.g., to 
n
HK/Macau/Taiwan) air ﬂights remained steady at ~70%/~65% of FY19 levels as of 
late (vs. ~68%/~65% in 1Q24), according to FlightMaster. That said, ﬂights to 
visa-free countries further recovered (e.g., 101%/88%/70% of FY19 levels for 
Singapore, Malaysia, Thailand respectively), and those to Japan and South Korea also 
saw noticeable improvement to 78%/74%. 
Shareholder return and cash position 
In terms of shareholder return, management noted they did not repurchase any 
n
shares in 1Q24, and will resume buyback in the coming quarters. Currently, they 
have US$581mn total outstanding quota for shareholder return (US$281mn left from 
the prior repurchase program and US$300mn from the 2024 Capital Return 
Program) which could be utilized for either share repurchases or dividend payments 
or both.

Investment Thesis - Trip.com Group 
Trip.com is China’s dominant domestic online travel agency providing full travel booking 
services across hotels, airlines, ground transportation, tourist attractions and package 
tours both domestically internationally. We are Buy rated on Trip.com (both ADR and H 
share) given 1) continuing market share gains with increasing penetration in lower-tier 
cities and new content strategy; 2) upside from overseas businesses upon border 
reopening; and 3) EBITDA upside from potentially higher hotel RevPar. Trading at below 
mid-cycle P/E, we see the current valuation as undemanding. 
Price Target Risks and Methodology – Trip.com Group 
Valuation methodology: We have a Buy rating on Trip.com (TCOM/9961.HK) and 
12-month target prices of US$64/HK$500 based on a SOTP
, with the core travel 
business valued at 18x P/E FY24E and afﬁliates valued based on their GS target prices 
or current market cap.  
Key risks: Regulatory risk given its dominance in the China OTA industry, 
greater-than-expected competition, a slower-than-expected outbound trafﬁc recovery.

Reg AC 
I, Simon Cheung, CFA, hereby certify that all of the views expressed in this report accurately reﬂect my personal views about the subject company or 
companies and its or their securities. I also certify that no part of my compensation was, is or will be, directly or indirectly, related to the speciﬁc 
recommendations or views expressed in this report.

GS Factor Proﬁle 
The Goldman Sachs Factor Proﬁle provides investment context for a stock by comparing key attributes to the market (i.e. our coverage universe) and its 
sector peers. The four key attributes depicted are: Growth, Financial Returns, Multiple (e.g. valuation) and Integrated (a composite of Growth, Financial 
Returns and Multiple). Growth, Financial Returns and Multiple are calculated by using normalized ranks for speciﬁc metrics for each stock. The 
normalized ranks for the metrics are then averaged and converted into percentiles for the relevant attribute. The precise calculation of each metric may 
vary depending on the ﬁscal year, industry and region, but the standard approach is as follows: 
Growth is based on a stock’s forward-looking sales growth, EBITDA growth and EPS growth (for ﬁnancial stocks, only EPS and sales growth), with a 
higher percentile indicating a higher growth company. Financial Returns is based on a stock’s forward-looking ROE, ROCE and CROCI (for ﬁnancial 
stocks, only ROE), with a higher percentile indicating a company with higher ﬁnancial returns. Multiple is based on a stock’s forward-looking P/E, P/B, 
price/dividend (P/D), EV/EBITDA, EV/FCF and EV/Debt Adjusted Cash Flow (DACF) (for ﬁnancial stocks, only P/E, P/B and P/D), with a higher percentile 
indicating a stock trading at a higher multiple. The Integrated percentile is calculated as the average of the Growth percentile, Financial Returns 
percentile and (100% - Multiple percentile). 
Financial Returns and Multiple use the Goldman Sachs analyst forecasts at the ﬁscal year-end at least three quarters in the future. Growth uses inputs 
for the ﬁscal year at least seven quarters in the future compared with the year at least three quarters in the future (on a per-share basis for all metrics). 
For a more detailed description of how we calculate the GS Factor Proﬁle, please contact your GS representative.  
M&A Rank 
Across our global coverage, we examine stocks using an M&A framework, considering both qualitative factors and quantitative factors (which may vary 
across sectors and regions) to incorporate the potential that certain companies could be acquired. We then assign a M&A rank as a means of scoring 
companies under our rated coverage from 1 to 3, with 1 representing high (30%-50%) probability of the company becoming an acquisition target, 2 
representing medium (15%-30%) probability and 3 representing low (0%-15%) probability. For companies ranked 1 or 2, in line with our standard 
departmental guidelines we incorporate an M&A component into our target price. M&A rank of 3 is considered immaterial and therefore does not 
factor into our price target, and may or may not be discussed in research. 
Quantum 
Quantum is Goldman Sachs’ proprietary database providing access to detailed ﬁnancial statement histories, forecasts and ratios. It can be used for 
in-depth analysis of a single company, or to make comparisons between companies in different sectors and markets.

Ratings, coverage universe and related deﬁnitions 
Buy (B), Neutral (N), Sell (S) Analysts recommend stocks as Buys or Sells for inclusion on various regional Investment Lists. Being assigned a Buy or 
Sell on an Investment List is determined by a stock’s total return potential relative to its coverage universe. Any stock not assigned as a Buy or a Sell on 
an Investment List with an active rating (i.e., a  stock that is not Rating Suspended, Not Rated, Coverage Suspended or Not Covered), is deemed 
Neutral. Each region manages Regional Conviction lists, which are selected from Buy rated stocks on the respective region’s Investment lists and 
represent investment recommendations focused on the size of the total return potential and/or the likelihood of the realization of the return across their 
respective areas of coverage.  The addition or removal of stocks from such Conviction lists are managed by the Investment Review Committee or other 
designated committee in each respective region and do not represent a change in the analysts’ investment rating for such stocks.    
Total return potential represents the upside or downside differential between the current share price and the price target, including all paid or 
anticipated dividends, expected during the time horizon associated with the price target. Price targets are required for all covered stocks. The total 
return potential, price target and associated time horizon are stated in each report adding or reiterating an Investment List membership.  
Coverage Universe: A list of all stocks in each coverage universe is available by primary analyst, stock and coverage universe at 
https://www.gs.com/research/hedge.html.    
Not Rated (NR). The investment rating, target price and earnings estimates (where relevant) are not provided or have been suspended pursuant to 
Goldman Sachs policy when Goldman Sachs is acting in an advisory capacity in a merger or in a strategic transaction involving this company, when 
there are legal, regulatory or policy constraints due to Goldman Sachs’ involvement in a transaction, when the company is an early-stage biotechnology 
company, and in certain other circumstances.  Rating Suspended (RS). Goldman Sachs Research has suspended the investment rating and price 
target for this stock, because there is not a sufﬁcient fundamental basis for determining an investment rating or target price. The previous investment 
rating and target price, if any, are no longer in effect for this stock and should not be relied upon.  Coverage Suspended (CS). Goldman Sachs has 
suspended coverage of this company.  Not Covered (NC). Goldman Sachs does not cover this company.  Not Available or Not Applicable (NA). The 
information is not available for display or is not applicable.  Not Meaningful (NM). The information is not meaningful and is therefore excluded.

This research is for our clients only. Other than disclosures relating to Goldman Sachs, this research is based on current public information that we 
consider reliable, but we do not represent it is accurate or complete, and it should not be relied on as such. The information, opinions, estimates and 
forecasts contained herein are as of the date hereof and are subject to change without prior notiﬁcation. We seek to update our research as 
appropriate, but various regulations may prevent us from doing so. Other than certain industry reports published on a periodic basis, the large majority 
of reports are published at irregular intervals as appropriate in the analyst’s judgment. 
Goldman Sachs conducts a global full-service, integrated investment banking, investment management, and brokerage business. We have investment 
banking and other business relationships with a substantial percentage of the companies covered by Global Investment Research. Goldman Sachs & 
Co. LLC, the United States broker dealer, is a member of SIPC (https://www.sipc.org).  
Our salespeople, traders, and other professionals may provide oral or written market commentary or trading strategies to our clients and principal 
trading desks that reﬂect opinions that are contrary to the opinions expressed in this research. Our asset management area, principal trading desks and 
investing businesses may make investment decisions that are inconsistent with the recommendations or views expressed in this research. 
The analysts named in this report may have from time to time discussed with our clients, including Goldman Sachs salespersons and traders, or may 
discuss in this report, trading strategies that reference catalysts or events that may have a near-term impact on the market price of the equity securities 
discussed in this report, which impact may be directionally counter to the analyst’s published price target expectations for such stocks. Any such 
trading strategies are distinct from and do not affect the analyst’s fundamental equity rating for such stocks, which rating reﬂects a stock’s return 
potential relative to its coverage universe as described herein. 
We and our afﬁliates, ofﬁcers, directors, and employees will from time to time have long or short positions in, act as principal in, and buy or sell, the 
securities or derivatives, if any, referred to in this research, unless otherwise prohibited by regulation or Goldman Sachs policy.

necessarily reﬂect those of Global Investment Research and are not an ofﬁcial view of Goldman Sachs.

illegal. It does not constitute a personal recommendation or take into account the particular investment objectives, ﬁnancial situations, or needs of

appropriate, seek professional advice, including tax advice. The price and value of investments referred to in this research and the income from them 
may ﬂuctuate. Past performance is not a guide to future performance, future returns are not guaranteed, and a loss of original capital may occur. 
Fluctuations in exchange rates could have adverse effects on the value or price of, or income derived from, certain investments.  
Certain transactions, including those involving futures, options, and other derivatives, give rise to substantial risk and are not suitable for all investors. 
Investors should review current options and futures disclosure documents which are available from Goldman Sachs sales representatives or at

Differing Levels of Service provided by Global Investment Research: The level and types of services provided to you by Goldman Sachs Global 
Investment Research may vary as compared to that provided to internal and other external clients of GS, depending on various factors including your 
individual preferences as to the frequency and manner of receiving communication, your risk proﬁle and investment focus and perspective (e.g., 
marketwide, sector speciﬁc, long term, short term), the size and scope of your overall client relationship with GS, and legal and regulatory constraints.  
As an example, certain clients may request to receive notiﬁcations when research on speciﬁc securities is published, and certain clients may request 
that speciﬁc data underlying analysts’ fundamental analysis available on our internal client websites be delivered to them electronically through data 
feeds or otherwise. No change to an analyst’s fundamental research views (e.g., ratings, price targets, or material changes to earnings estimates for

publication to our internal client websites or through other means, as necessary, to all clients who are entitled to receive such reports.

J.P. Morgan Securities (China) Company 
Limited
See page 10 for analyst certification and important disclosures, including non-US analyst disclosures.
J.P. Morgan does and seeks to do business with companies covered in its research reports. As a result, investors should be aware that 
the firm may have a conflict of interest that could affect the objectivity of this report. Investors should consider this report as only a single 
factor in making their investment decision.
Trip.com’s share price has rallied by 58% YTD, significantly outperforming the 
sector average as measured by KWEB by 40ppt. We attribute such strong YTD 
share price performance to: 1) positive earnings revisions (+12%), 2) a sector-
wide valuation re-rating (large-cap average +22%), and 3) a company-specific re-
rating (24%) due to an improving mid- to long-term earnings growth outlook as a 
result of rapid growth of China outbound travel and international OTA revenue. 
We remain positive on the share price outlook on a six- to 12-month view,
because we believe: 1) a structurally higher margin in the China domestic market 
should lead to structurally higher group margins, 2) market-share gains in the 
outbound travel market on the back of a market recovery support earnings upside 
in the next few quarters, and 3) rapid growth of the international OTA market 
paves the way for long-term earnings growth sustainability. We raise our PTs to 
US$70/HK$550 as we increase 2024E/25E adj EPS by 16%/8% and roll over our 
valuation base to 2025E. Our revised 2024E/25E adj. EPS are 20%/15% higher 
than Bloomberg consensus estimates. Maintain OW.
Domestic travel: Revenue slows down in 2024 due to high base, while 
margin continues to increase. We estimate domestic revenue growth to slow 
to 8% YoY in 2024E, due largely to high hotel and air-ticket pricing in 2Q23 
and 3Q23. On the other hand, we expect domestic volume growth will remain 
healthy at teens levels in 2024E. We believe Trip.com's domestic operations
have entered a sustainable higher margin structure than that pre-COVID due to 
structural cost optimization during the COVID period. 
Outbound travel: market share gains on the back of industry supply 
recovery. We believe rapid growth of outbound travel revenue is driven by both 
an industry supply recovery and Trip.com's market-share gains from offline 
travel agents. We forecast outbound travel revenue to grow 60%/35% YoY in 
2024E/25E, respectively, with an increasing margin outlook due to higher ASP 
and take rate than domestic travel operations.
International travel: rapid growth in a sizable addressable market amidst 
benign competition. According to management, the addressable market of the 
overall Asia market is 1.5x bigger than that in China. In such a sizable market, 
we believe the company's execution capability and technology strength will 
allow it to achieve sustainable long-term growth (JPMe 42% CAGR during 
2023-25). Rapid growth from such a high growth potential business is positive 
to valuation multiples, due to potential benefit on long-term group earnings 
growth sustainability, in our view.

Revenue and analysis from a geographical perspective
We use 2019 data as the benchmark and estimate growth rate/margin profiles for 
each business line to get 2023 numbers. For 2024/25E, our forecasts are based on
yoy change vs a year ago (e.g. 2024 vs 2023).
Revenue
We expect total revenue to grow 18% YoY in 2024, driven mainly by robust 
outbound travel revenue (+60% YoY). International business should also maintain 
strong momentum, and we forecast 45% revenue growth in 2024. Looking into 2025, 
we forecast 18% YoY total revenue growth, thanks to a solid 35%/40% YoY 
increase in outbound/international revenue, respectively.

Margins
We forecast a group-level non-GAAP OPM of 30% in 2024E, up slightly by 0.5ppt 
YoY, thanks to an outbound travel recovery as well as improving profitability of 
international business. For 2025E, we expect group non-GAAP OPM to edge up 
further by 0.4ppt YoY, driven by continuous margin improvement in outbound/
international business.

Revisions of estimates and PTs 
We revise up our 2024/25E EPS forecasts by 16%/8%, due to better-than-expected 
1Q result and strong growth outlook for outbound/international business. We also 
roll over our valuation base to 2025. Our new Dec-24 PTs are based on 20x 2025E 
P/E (a ~10%-20% valuation premium to other vertical leaders such as H World and 
Beike), supported by the company’s clearer growth outlook and stronger competitive 
positioning vs peers.

Trip.com Group Ltd
Domestic travel operation enters sustainably higher margin 
structure; rapid growth in outbound points to MT upside
We remain positive on the share price outlook on a six- to 12-month view, because 
we believe: 1) a structurally higher margin in the China domestic market should lead 
to structurally higher group margins, 2) market-share gains in the outbound travel 
market on the back of a market recovery support earnings upside in the next few 
quarters, and 3) rapid growth of the international OTA market paves the way for 
long-term earnings growth sustainability. We raise our PT to US$70 as we increase 
2024E/25E adj EPS by 16%/8% and roll over our valuation base to 2025E. Our 
revised 2024E/25E adj. EPS are 20%/15% higher than Bloomberg consensus 
estimates. Maintain OW.
Investment Thesis, Valuation and Risks
Trip.com Group Ltd (Overweight; Price Target: $70.00)
Investment Thesis 
We remain positive on the share price outlook on a six- to 12-month view, because 
we believe: 1) a structurally higher margin in the China domestic market should lead 
to structurally higher group margins, 2) market-share gains in the outbound travel 
market on the back of a market recovery support earnings upside in the next few 
quarters, and 3) rapid growth of the international OTA market paves the way for 
long-term earnings growth sustainability.
Valuation
Our Dec-24 PT of US$70 is based on 20x 2025E P/E (~10%-20% valuation 
premium to other vertical leaders such as H World and Beike, based on consensus 
estimates), supported by its clearer growth outlook and stronger competitive 
positioning vs peers.
Risks to Rating and Price Target
Downside risks to our rating and price target include: 1) a slower-than-expected 
recovery of the travel market; 2) intense industry competition; and 3) a 
macroeconomic slowdown.

The chart(s) show J.P. Morgan's continuing coverage of the stocks; the current analysts may or may not have covered it over the entire 
period. 
J.P. Morgan ratings or designations: OW = Overweight, N= Neutral, UW = Underweight, NR = Not Rated
Explanation of Equity Research Ratings, Designations and Analyst(s) Coverage Universe: 
J.P. Morgan uses the following rating system: Overweight (over the duration of the price target indicated in this report, we expect this 
stock will outperform the average total return of the stocks in the Research Analyst’s, or the Research Analyst’s team’s, coverage 
universe); Neutral (over the duration of the price target indicated in this report, we expect this stock will perform in line with the average 
total return of the stocks in the Research Analyst’s, or the Research Analyst’s team’s, coverage universe); and Underweight (over the 
duration of the price target indicated in this report, we expect this stock will underperform the average total return of the stocks in the 
Research Analyst’s, or the Research Analyst’s team’s, coverage universe. NR is Not Rated. In this case, J.P. Morgan has removed the 
rating and, if applicable, the price target, for this stock because of either a lack of a sufficient fundamental basis or for legal, regulatory or 
policy reasons. The previous rating and, if applicable, the price target, no longer should be relied upon. An NR designation is not a
recommendation or a rating. In our Asia (ex-Australia and ex-India) and U.K. small- and mid-cap Equity Research, each stock’s expected 
total return is compared to the expected total return of a benchmark country market index, not to those Research Analysts’ coverage 
universe. If it does not appear in the Important Disclosures section of this report, the certifying Research Analyst’s coverage universe can 
be found on J.P. Morgan’s Research website, https://www.jpmorganmarkets.com.
