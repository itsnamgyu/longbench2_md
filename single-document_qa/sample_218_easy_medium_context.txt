Report
2023 Annual Report
A very warm welcome to CLP’s  
Annual Report. Our commitment to  
build a sustainable business remained  
the bedrock of our purpose to  
Power Brighter Tomorrows through a year 
in which we delivered significant growth 
despite persistent energy market volatility. 
We also took steps to enhance the way we 
report our business, providing stakeholders 
with greater insight into our strategies and 
objectives.
This year’s Annual Report has been restructured to better frame the discussion about 
how we deliver our sustainability agenda with reference to the new International 
Sustainability Standards Board’s IFRS S1 and IFRS S2 standards. Published in 2023, the 
standards define best practices for companies to improve disclosures on sustainability 
and allow capital providers to make more informed investment decisions. 
We continued our double materiality approach, and the Annual Report focuses on the 
financial effects of material topics that may affect the business’s cash flow, access 
to finance and cost of capital. Topics that have a material impact on people, the 
environment and the economy are covered by our Sustainability Report, which also 
explores the Group’s strategies for managing nature-related issues in line with the new 
Taskforce on Nature-related Financial Disclosures framework. 
Our disclosures continue to meet – and in many respects exceed – regulatory 
requirements and reporting frameworks, including the Hong Kong Listing Rules. They 
reflect our determination to further enhance our reporting and provide a comprehensive 
view of our efforts to create long-term, sustainable value for our stakeholders above 
and beyond financial performance. 
Decarbonisation remains CLP’s foremost priority. Our updated Climate Vision 2050 
coincides with the release of the Annual Report and Sustainability Report and sets out 
our strengthened target for 2030, as we continue our journey to net-zero greenhouse 
gas emissions across the value chain by 2050. 
The content of the Annual Report, Sustainability Report and Climate Vision 2050 have 
been streamlined to avoid any overlap and enable readers to access the information 
they require more easily. We sincerely hope you find our reports thought-provoking and 
insightful.

EnergyAustralia is one of the largest privately owned electricity generators under the 
National Electricity Market (NEM), a major gas and electricity retailer in New South 
Wales, Victoria, South Australia and the Australian Capital Territory, and an electricity 
retailer in Queensland. Private generators operating under the NEM and a number of 
government-owned assets provide generation services in a competitive wholesale 
market. The electricity retail market is partially regulated while the transmission and 
distribution segments remain substantially regulated.
The electricity industry in Mainland China is largely state-controlled. Transmission and 
distribution are principally operated by two state-owned enterprises while generation is 
open for investment. As the country continues to open up its energy market, the 
provision of sustainable energy services to customers also presents great potential for 
private investments. CLP first entered the market in 1979 when the Group began 
providing electricity to Guangdong province. Today, CLP China is one of the largest 
external investors in the energy sector in Mainland China with over 50 power projects in 
15 provinces, municipalities and autonomous regions, concentrating on low-carbon 
energy, including nuclear power and renewable energy, in addition to opportunities in 
smart energy services.
Much of the electricity industry in India has traditionally been owned and controlled by 
the Federal and State Governments. Since 2006, private companies have been 
encouraged to invest in the generation and increasingly transmission segments. On the 
distribution side, the Federal Government has recently progressed initiatives for more 
privatisation. Since entering the Indian market in 2002, CLP has built a diversified 
portfolio comprising wind, solar and supercritical coal generating facilities as well as 
transmission and advanced metering infrastructure assets. The business, a 50:50 joint 
venture between CLP and the Canada-based global investment group CDPQ, is operated 
under the Apraava Energy brand with a focus on clean energy, power transmission and 
other customer-focused energy businesses.
CLP has minority interests in a solar project in Thailand and a coal-based generation 
plant in Taiwan region. The electricity industry is government-controlled in both 
markets.
Hong Kong’s electricity sector is regulated by the Scheme of Control Agreements and 
operated by two vertically integrated utility companies that serve different 
geographical areas of the city. CLP Power Hong Kong Limited, the larger of the two 
companies and a wholly owned subsidiary of the Group, provides a power supply of 
99.999% world-class reliability to about 2.79 million customers in Kowloon, the New 
Territories and most of the outlying islands, serving more than 80% of the city’s 
population.

Group operating earnings before fair value movements increased 33.2% to HK$10,127 million attributable 
to dependable contributions from our core business in Hong Kong and Mainland China and significant 
improvement in overseas business. With the turnaround of fair value movements, from a loss of HK$2,979 
million to a gain of HK$2,125 million, and after taking into account the items affecting comparability, mainly 
impairment of goodwill of the Customer business in Australia of HK$5,868 million, total earnings came at 
HK$6,655 million, a strong rebound from HK$924 million for 2022.

actions, and we stand 
ready to Power Brighter 
Tomorrows for our future 
generations.

Chairman
Chairman’s Statement
CLP Holdings 2023 Annual Report

I am pleased to report that CLP delivered on significant 
growth opportunities across the Group in 2023 navigating the 
persistent economic, financial and geopolitical complexities 
worldwide.
In 2023, the Group’s operating earnings before fair value 
movements increased 33% year-on-year to HK$10,127 million,  
underscoring the solid performance of most of our markets. 
Taking into account several one-off items including the 
HK$5,868 million non-cash impairment of goodwill of 
EnergyAustralia’s Customer business, total earnings were 
HK$6,655 million, compared with HK$924 million a year earlier. 
The Board has declared a fourth interim dividend payment 
for 2023 of HK$1.21 per share, same as 2022. Total 
dividends for 2023 were unchanged at HK$3.10 per share.  
In line with our longstanding practice and policy on dividends, 
the Board struck a balance between the improvement of 
financial performance in 2023 and the Group’s ongoing 
investment in the energy transition and decided to maintain 
the 2023 total dividends at the same level as last year. 
In 2024, we remain committed to build on the positive 
momentum established in 2023 to remunerate shareholders 
in line with the evolution of earnings while ensuring that a 
solid financial position continues to back our business growth.
During 2023, encouraging growth and progress were 
achieved across all of our markets. Our five-year 
Development Plan was approved by the Hong Kong SAR 
Government, a milestone agreement that fortifies our 
commitment to meeting the energy demands essential for 
the long-term development of Hong Kong. These strategic 
investments will bolster economic growth, support the 
ongoing decarbonisation and reinforce Hong Kong’s position 
as a smart, modern and resilient city. Notably, we took 
pride in successfully launching Hong Kong’s first offshore 
LNG terminal in September that enhances the city’s energy 
security and ensures a competitive gas supply for the benefit 
of our community.

CLP Holdings 2023 Annual Report


In Mainland China, our business exhibited a strong 
performance led by our nuclear fleet, and an accelerated 
expansion of our renewable portfolio. A robust project 
pipeline and the commissioning of a new wind farm and 
a solar facility in China during 2023 underscores our 
commitment in meeting the country’s escalating demand for 
renewable energy. In November, I led a delegation of  
CLP board members and senior management to Beijing, 
where we had the honour of meeting the Director of 
Hong Kong and Macao Affairs Office, Mr Xia Baolong. We 
were deeply encouraged by Mr Xia’s recognition of our 
longstanding commitment to Hong Kong and China as well as 
his full confidence in the future of CLP’s business.
Our Indian joint venture, Apraava Energy, made substantial 
progress in 2023, particularly in non-carbon projects. 
The planned 300MW wind farm in Karnataka state, the 
commencement of partial operations at the Sidhpur 
wind project in Gujarat state, the continued growth of 
its transmission assets and the venture into smart meter 
business underscore a strategy to pursue diversified 
investments along the electricity supply chain.
Although the energy retail market in Australia has become 
increasingly challenging, EnergyAustralia improved its 
operational performance significantly in 2023 in the wake 
of the 2022 energy crisis, while supporting record numbers 
of customers seeking assistance in managing cost of living 
pressure. CLP remains committed to participating in the 
energy transition in Australia, and building a strong and 
sustainable business through the opportunities arising from 
this journey.
Looking to the future, decarbonisation stands as the  
foremost priority for our business and Climate Vision 2050,  
our blueprint for achieving net-zero greenhouse gas 
emissions by mid-century, remains one of, if not the main 
cornerstone of our strategy. Late last year, we conducted 
a review to make sure that this blueprint stays aligned 
with the latest developments in our businesses as well as 
the external risks and uncertainties we face. Based on the 
concerted and diligent efforts within the Group to accelerate 
the decarbonisation of our portfolio, we have strengthened 
our 2030 greenhouse gas targets to further enhance our 
progress. The leadership team at CLP is committed to 
ensuring we move ahead with the requisite speed and agility 
needed to achieve these strengthened targets and seize the 
opportunities before us. 
As the threat of climate change looms larger, we have 
witnessed extreme weather events rising in frequency 
and intensity. This often puts to test the resilience of our

Chairman’s Statement


operations and the capability of our teams to respond.  
I would like to express my heartfelt gratitude to our 
dedicated teams across all markets who have consistently 
delivered service excellence, particularly during testing 
circumstances. Hong Kong endured two extreme weather 
events in quick succession in September when Super 
Typhoon Saola – the most powerful storm in five years – 
was followed by the heaviest rainstorm since records began 
140 years ago which brought landslides and flooding across 
the city. The extraordinary professionalism and dedication 
our teams displayed during these adverse weather events 
enabled us to maintain a reliable power supply and minimise 
the impact on customers.
Our success over a long history has been predicated  
not just on results, but on how we have achieved them.  
This philosophy was formally embedded in CLP’s  
Value Framework two decades ago, which encompasses 
how we treat our people, our relationships with customers, 
investors, business partners, governments and the  
wider community. To support the Group’s purpose to  
Power Brighter Tomorrows, we recently updated our  
Value Framework, simplifying our values into the three 
core values of Care, Excellence and Responsibility. We also 
brought these values to life for our people by introducing 
expectations of their day-to-day work and for our 
stakeholders by explaining how we run our business.  
We believe these changes will not only empower our 
colleagues to achieve peak performance but will also 
distinctly articulate our promises and obligations to our 
employees, customers, shareholders, business partners and 
society at large. 
In June, I announced the appointment of Mr T.K. Chiang as 
Chief Executive Officer of CLP Holdings. T.K. brings with him  
a wealth of experience and expertise gained over 30 years 
with the Group. Prior to being elevated to CEO, T.K. was 
Managing Director of CLP Power. Stepping into this role is  
Mr Joseph Law, a seasoned professional who has held various 
senior management positions since joining CLP in 2001, 
culminating in his most recent role as Managing Director  
of CLP China. Both T.K. and Joseph have a deep connection  
with CLP and are strongly committed to the company’s core  
values and culture. Another example that reflects the deep  
bench of talent in our executive team is the appointment of  
Mr Alexandre Keisser to succeed Mr Nicolas Tissot as  
Chief Financial Officer on 1 April. Mr Keisser joined the Group 
as Managing Director of CLPe Solutions in 2018, before 
taking on his current role as Chief Officer – International 
Business last year. And I wish to thank Mr Tissot for his 
contributions to CLP since he joined us in 2020.
Our Group is well-positioned to navigate the many 
opportunities and uncertainties that lie ahead. The energy 
transition journey demands bold actions, and we stand ready 
to Power Brighter Tomorrows for our future generations.
On behalf of the entire Board, thank you for your continued 
support.

Despite our uncertain world, 
the prospects for CLP remain 
clear. We have a great 
business and an unwavering 
intent to take it into the next 
chapter of growth.  
T.K. Chiang
Chief Executive Officer

It is my honour to report on the Group’s performance for 
the first time as Chief Executive Officer of CLP Holdings. CLP 
has an incredible foundation for building our next successful 
era as we contribute to meeting the world’s energy needs in 
cleaner and more sustainable ways. I am both humbled and 
excited to be leading this organisation forward.
In 2023, CLP delivered a very solid performance amid a 
volatile global backdrop. Our core businesses in Hong Kong 
and Mainland China again brought dependable contributions 
to the Group. We have a valuable diversified portfolio 
of businesses and in the past year, we strengthened our 
positions in Australia and India, as we contributed to the 
energy transition in both countries. Across all of our markets, 
we are building growth momentum seizing the opportunities 
in rising demand for sustainable energy solutions. As always, 
safety remains a priority for our business and the reduction in 
the Group’s injury rates last year is testament to our ongoing 
efforts to make CLP a safer place for our people to work.
Hong Kong
As Hong Kong came out of the pandemic in 2023, CLP Power 
continued to deliver a highly reliable, environmentally 
sustainable and reasonably priced electricity supply to 
support the return to normal economic activities. Operating 
earnings from the local energy business before fair value 
movements rose 1.3% to HK$8,823 million as investment 
was made to fund Hong Kong’s economic and infrastructure 
developments and continued decarbonisation of the energy 
supply.
The gradual economic recovery and record summer 
temperatures lifted CLP Power’s electricity sales by 1.6% 
to 35,392 gigawatt hours (GWh) from a year earlier. Sales 
in the Commercial sector rose as the cessation of COVID-19 
restrictions, inbound tourism and the return of large-scale 
events drove consumption in hotels, shops and restaurants. 
Higher sales in the Infrastructure and Public Services sector 
reflected the resumption in government services, education and 
transport activities. By contrast, demand from the Residential 
sector dipped as people spent less time at home.

CLP Holdings 2023 Annual Report


We understand customers’ concern about electricity tariffs 
at a time of higher global inflation. We remain committed to 
cost control and a diversified fuel strategy to ease the tariff 
pressure on customers. Helped by falling international fuel 
prices, we were able to reduce the Average Net Tariff for our 
customers by 7.4% from January 2024 compared with a year 
earlier. Meanwhile, we are looking after customers in need  
by again allocating more than HK$200 million from the  
CLP Community Energy Saving Fund for a series of 
programmes in 2024 to promote energy conservation and 
help the underprivileged. These include providing electricity 
subsidies for elderly people and tenants of subdivided units.
Our 2024-2028 Development Plan was approved by the 
Hong Kong SAR Government in November 2023, projecting 
capital expenditure of around HK$52.9 billion over the 
five-year period to meet growing electricity demand and 
to support the Government’s policy priorities. The plan is 
designed to underpin Hong Kong’s accelerating economic and 
infrastructure development, deliver a reliable world-class 
electricity network, strengthen continued decarbonisation 
efforts and support the transition to a smart city. The 
Government is focused on land and housing supply, and we 
expect the construction of public housing units in our supply 
area to increase 50% to more than 150,000 over the  
five-year period. Hong Kong has a strong potential to become 
a prime regional location for data centres, and we aim to 
provide the power supplies and connections for up to 18 
large-scale data centres by 2028, compared with just four in 
the previous five-year period. We are also gearing up for the 
upgrading of major rail and road networks in our supply area 
as the Government modernises the city’s infrastructure.
Our competitive tariffs and the investments contained in the 
2024-2028 Development Plan are testament to the ability 
of the Scheme of Control (SoC) Agreement to deliver a cost-
effective, world-class electricity supply to support Hong Kong’s 
 
growth. An Interim Review of the SoC Agreement was 
concluded in 2023 during which we agreed several 
modifications with the Government to further strengthen 
the regulatory framework. Under a special tariff relief 
arrangement, we will provide additional financial support for 
those residential customers in need if an international energy 
crisis causes a sharp rise in fuel costs. We also agreed a new 
scheme for penalty payments in the event of a widespread 
supply interruption, and further improvements in information 
transparency on fuel and operating costs.
Extreme weather events are becoming more frequent and 
severe because of global warming, and we remain focused  
on strengthening our network reliability and resilience.  
Hong Kong was hit by Super Typhoon Saola and the heaviest 
rainstorm on record in the space of a week in September.  
Our power supply to customers was largely intact, 
demonstrating the resilience of our system and the 
effectiveness of our comprehensive preparations and 
response plans.
The decarbonisation of Hong Kong’s power supply took 
a major step forward with the launch of a new offshore 
LNG terminal over the summer. The floating storage and 
regasification unit vessel moored at the jetty is the largest 
of its kind in the world, increasing our access to diversified 
supply of competitively priced natural gas from international 
markets.
To facilitate a phasing out of coal-fired generation, we 
will complete a new advanced combined-cycle gas turbine 
generation unit, Unit D2, at Black Point Power Station. We are  
also enhancing the Clean Energy Transmission System (CETS) 
overhead line circuits between Hong Kong and Mainland China. 
 
When its upgrade is completed in 2025, the CETS will allow 
for increased imports of zero-carbon energy to the city. 
Together with Unit D2 at Black Point Power Station, it 
will help to maintain power supply reliability as coal-fired 
generation at Castle Peak A Power Station is phased out.
Separately, the 2024-2028 Development Plan allows for 
CLP Power to establish a grid-scale battery energy storage 
system (BESS) of around 100MW to reduce peak system 
demand and facilitate the integration of energy from  
non-fossil electricity sources. We also plan to launch a pilot 
project to test blending hydrogen into natural gas for power 
generation at Black Point Power Station.
We are strengthening our digital capabilities to provide 
customers with more personalised energy services including 
energy saving recommendations and incentives, many of which  
are enabled by smart meters. Under a meter replacement 
programme that began in 2018, we have connected more 
than 2.23 million smart meters for CLP Power customers in 
Hong Kong so far and the programme will be completed by 
2025.
Transportation accounts for nearly one fifth of carbon 
emissions in Hong Kong and electrifying this sector is another 
vital element of the decarbonisation journey. CLP has been 
a key facilitator of the city’s transition to a new era of 
eMobility. We support the Government’s electrification of 
public transportation and commercial vehicles, and  
CLP Power provided technical advice for the development 
of an electric vehicle (EV) fleet for The Kowloon Motor 
Bus Company (1933) Limited while installing EV charging 
infrastructure for customers on private residential estates. In 
another initiative, CLP Power teamed up with 14 like-minded  
businesses and organisations to launch the eMobility 
Network to encourage technology exchange and the wider 
use of electric commercial vehicles.

CEO’s Strategic Review


	
	 The new Yangzhou Gongdao Solar Power Station in Jiangsu province is equipped with an 8MW commercial use battery 
energy storage system, the first of its kind in the province.
CLP Power provides a wide range of energy solutions such 
as Renewable Energy Certificates (RECs) and energy audits 
to help customers decarbonise their businesses. We signed 
multi-year contracts for RECs with various corporations, 
bolstering the generation of renewable energy in Hong Kong  
while enabling carbon emission reduction benefits for these 
businesses. To add further value to our customers and promote  
RECs, we partnered with DBS Bank (Hong Kong) Limited to  
launch a programme in 2023 under which the bank offers  
our small to medium enterprise customers a series of 
privilege banking offers. 
Increasingly, customers are turning to sustainability-linked 
loans to fund projects and we help them to be more energy 
efficient to meet their sustainability targets. For instance, 
CLP Power conducted energy audits and provided energy 
efficiency advice to ESR Group Limited (ESR), a real asset 
manager, for the planned conversion of an old cold storage 
building into a modern data centre. ESR in turn secured 
funding from a sustainability-linked loan for the project.  
CLP Power also helped Far East Consortium International 
Limited secure its first sustainability-linked loan by 
conducting an energy audit for one of its hotels. With our 
support on energy efficiency, about HK$2.3 billion worth of 
sustainability-linked loans were obtained by our customers in 
2023.
As we continue to develop new ways to support the energy 
needs of our customers, it is pleasing that CLP Power is 
gaining increasing recognition for the service and value 
it provides. We received 45 coveted awards in 2023 
for customer-related areas including customer service, 
innovation and digital transformation from well-regarded 
organisations in Hong Kong and overseas.
The Group has established a growing status as a provider 
of Energy-as-a-Service solutions in Hong Kong and the 
Guangdong-Hong Kong-Macao Greater Bay Area (GBA) 
through our energy infrastructure and solutions subsidiary 
CLPe, which supports its customers in their sustainability 
efforts by drawing from its engineering expertise and 
applying advanced technologies. For example, it has formed 
a partnership with property companies Henderson Land and 
Chinachem Group to replace the cooling system of a shopping 
mall and through the use of AI technology to improve energy 
efficiency, lower electricity consumption and reduce carbon 
emissions.

CLP Holdings 2023 Annual Report


As more construction sites seek to cut pollution and save 
costs by turning to batteries to replace diesel generators, 
CLPe won more than 40 BESS orders from over 10 
construction companies during the year.
Hong Kong has emerged from the long shadow of the 
pandemic into a new growth stage. Our 2024-2028 
Development Plan is a roadmap for CLP to play a pivotal role 
to support Hong Kong’s growing energy needs at a time of 
accelerating economic and infrastructure development.
Mainland China
In 2023, our nuclear and renewable energy investments in 
Mainland China performed well, although operating earnings 
of CLP China dropped 7.0% year-on-year from a high 
HK$2,229 million to HK$2,073 million, largely due to losses 
incurred by the coal portfolio.
The two nuclear power stations in our portfolio performed 
strongly. Driven by robust electricity demand, generation at 
Yangjiang Nuclear Power Station reached a record high.  
Daya Bay Nuclear Power Station continued to operate 
steadily to supply zero-carbon energy to Hong Kong. As 
the plant entered 30 years of service, large-scale planned 
outages are being carried out at Daya Bay. Maintenance work 
on one of the generating units was successfully completed in 
January 2024. Preparatory work on the other unit has begun 
and the planned outage is scheduled to be completed before 
the peak summer season begins. 
	
	 CEO T.K. Chiang delivers an address at the Fourth Qingdao Multinationals Summit in Shandong province, a strategic area 
for CLP China’s business development.
CLP China’s remaining minority-owned coal-fired assets had a 
difficult year. The financial performance was affected by low 
electricity tariffs and high coal prices, coupled with a drop in 
overall asset utilisation due to increased renewable energy 
supply in the market and one generation unit underwent a 
repowering project.
Output and earnings from our renewable energy assets in 
Mainland China maintained steady performance thanks to the 
contribution of new wind and solar projects. Because both 
water resources and tariffs fell short of expectations, we 
booked an impairment of assets of HK$115 million for  
Dali Yang_er Hydropower Station in Yunnan province for 
2023. The performance of CLP China’s other hydro assets 
– Huaiji Hydro Power Stations in Guangdong province and 
Jiangbian Hydropower Station in Sichuan province – remained 
stable.
The expansion of our renewable energy portfolio accelerated 
in 2023 to meet rising demand as China pursues a dual target 
of peak carbon emissions by 2030 and net-zero emissions by 
2060. CLP China commissioned the 50MW Xundian II Wind 
Farm in Yunnan and the 73.7MW Yangzhou Gongdao Solar 
Power Station in Jiangsu province. Yangzhou Gongdao Solar 
Power Station is equipped with an 8MW commercial-use  
BESS, the first of its kind in the province. We began 
construction of the 150MW Bobai Wind Farm in Guangxi 
Zhuang Autonomous Region which is due to go into service in 
2024. Construction is due to begin soon on the Sandu II Wind 
Farm (100MW) in Guizhou province, and on two 100MW 
solar projects in Huai'an and Yixing in Jiangsu.
CLP Holdings 2023 Annual Report

CEO’s Strategic Review


All our newly commissioned projects and those under 
construction and planning are grid-parity initiatives designed 
to operate without government subsidies. As for legacy 
subsidised projects, by the end of December, the amount of  
accumulated national subsidy payments owed to CLP China’s 
renewable energy subsidiaries was HK$2,426 million, 
compared with HK$2,111 million a year earlier.
Beyond assets under construction, we have secured 
construction quotas for three renewable energy projects 
with a combined capacity of 660MW in Guangxi, and three 
more projects in Shandong province with a total capacity 
of 530MW. Although it is uncertain at this stage if all the 
projects will proceed, we are firmly committed to expanding 
our portfolio by developing greenfield sites.
Expanding our existing projects onto adjacent sites is another 
growth strategy that enables synergies and economies 
of scale. We are exploring the possibility of adding more 
capacity at Xundian and Sandu wind farms as well as other 
locations.
CLP broke new ground in corporate partnerships by entering 
into a strategic cooperation framework agreement with 
Shui On Xintiandi (Shui On), a leading investor and manager 
of premium and sustainable commercial properties. This 
involves a 10-year power purchase agreement (PPA) under 
which CLP will supply renewable energy from Yangzhou 
Gongdao Solar Power Station to Shui On’s Nanjing 
International Finance Center commercial and office complex. 
The agreement is the first medium to long-term agreement 
of its kind signed by CLP in Mainland China. We also signed 
our largest Green Electricity Certificate (GEC) contract with 
a prominent global data centre operator for five years, 
enabling the customer to claim the environmental benefits 
associated with renewable energy generation. Both contracts 
demonstrate our commitment to providing non-carbon 
energy solutions that help business customers achieve their 
sustainability goals.
We believe there is high demand for our PPAs and GECs as 
companies worldwide seek to reduce their carbon emissions. 
We are proactively expanding our renewable energy portfolio 
to meet rising demand, which is particularly pronounced in 
eastern and southern provinces such as Guangdong, Guangxi, 
Shanghai, Jiangsu and Zhejiang.
Shandong, where we have wind projects with a combined 
capacity of about 600MW in operation, is another strategic 
area for business development. I had the honour to speak in 
October at the Fourth Qingdao Multinationals Summit jointly 
hosted by the Ministry of Commerce of the People’s Republic 
of China and the People’s Government of Shandong, where 
we pledged to support the continuing development of clean 
energy in Mainland China. This followed an official visit to 
CLP’s headquarters by Shandong Governor Mr Zhou Naixiang 
in May when we made clear our determination to play a 
greater role in the decarbonisation of the province.
To capture opportunities from the growth of energy 
sustainability technologies and solutions in the GBA, CLPe set 
up a new office in Longhua district in Shenzhen in April 2023 
and has continued to strengthen its capabilities. The business 
expanded its partnership with MTR Shenzhen last year by 
winning two new projects to install and operate solar energy 
systems for the rail operator’s premises in Longhua, after 
completing a similar project in 2022.
In September, CLPe signed a Memorandum of Understanding 
(MoU) with Link Asset Management Limited (Link) to develop 
one-stop energy solutions at Link’s premises in the Mainland 
GBA cities.
China continues to take the lead in the electrification of 
transport and since 2022, CLPe has been operating an EV 
charging joint venture with TELD New Energy Company 
Limited. The business expanded its coverage to over 180 
charging stations offering more than 5,500 chargers in the 
cities of Dongguan, Shenzhen and Zhuhai in the GBA by the 
end of 2023.
The ascent of China as an economic powerhouse has been 
one of the defining stories of this era. With our established 
nuclear operations, a dedication to growing our renewable 
energy portfolio, strong corporate partnerships and  
Energy-as-a-Service solutions, CLP is ideally placed to 
support China on the journey to decarbonisation as it writes 
the next chapters of a remarkable economic success story.
Australia
We announced in late January 2024 that we expected to 
make an impairment charge following an assessment of 
the goodwill of the Customer business of our wholly owned 
subsidiary EnergyAustralia. The impairment reflected a 
more challenging outlook for the retail energy market as 
competition levels increased over the second half of 2023.
Notwithstanding that, EnergyAustralia’s performance is set 
on a path of recovery with its operating loss before fair value 
movements narrowed from HK$2,330 million in 2022 to 
HK$182 million in 2023. In a sharp contrast to the large fair 
value losses reported in 2022, fair value movements in 2023 
were favourable largely due to the roll off of energy contracts 
sold before the energy crisis. 
With the normalisation of wholesale electricity prices, 
improved power station performance and higher realised 
prices, contribution from EnergyAustralia’s generation 
business turned around. Sent out from Yallourn Power 
Station in Victoria was steady as availability rose from 67% in 
2022 to around 72% following an improvement in operations. 
This is despite the fact that to ensure the continued reliability 
21
CLP Holdings 2023 Annual Report


of the 50-year-old coal-fired power station until its scheduled 
retirement in 2028, EnergyAustralia conducted maintenance 
outages on two of its four units in the second half of 2023. 
Similar maintenance will be carried out on the other two 
units in 2024.
High availability was also maintained at Mount Piper Power 
Station in New South Wales, although output was lower 
year-on-year because of reduced market demand and lower 
wholesale electricity prices. Mount Piper is supplied with 
coal primarily from the nearby Springvale mine. Poor mine 
water quality led to reduced dewatering capacity for the 
mine, resulting in a risk of underground mine flooding in the 
second half. EnergyAustralia supported the mine operator 
with mitigations to ensure that the coal supply and financial 
performance of Mount Piper for 2023 were not materially 
impacted by this issue. However, looking ahead, there is still 
a risk of coal supply disruptions, even with the new, more 
flexible multi-mine long-term contract that was put in place 
in 2023.
On the project front, EnergyAustralia made significant 
progress with its distributed and flexible capacity initiatives. 
The new 320MW Tallawarra B gas-fired power station was 
officially opened in February 2024. Fast-start gas generation 
assets like Tallawarra B will play an increasingly critical role 
in providing electricity at peak periods and times of low 
sunshine and wind.
The commissioning of Tallawarra B and the rolling 
maintenance at Yallourn Power Station were part of a 
comprehensive programme by EnergyAustralia to prepare for 
demand in the summer of 2023/24.
EnergyAustralia moved forward with the development of 
Wooreen Energy Storage System in Victoria after receiving 
development approval in February and grid connection 
clearance in December. The four-hour utility-scale battery 
with 350MW of capacity is scheduled to go into service by 
the end of 2026.
In September, EnergyAustralia took commercial control of 
New South Wales’s largest energy storage system – the 
Riverina Stage 2 and Darlington Point batteries which have 
the capacity to provide energy for around 49,000 homes for 
two hours.
To further expand its renewable energy portfolio, 
EnergyAustralia signed a PPA with Genex Power for 30% 
of the output of the 258MW Kidston Stage 3 wind project 
in Queensland for 10 years. This followed an earlier energy 
storage services agreement with Genex for the 250MW 
Kidston pumped storage hydro project.
EnergyAustralia has released the concept design for the Lake 
Lyell pumped hydro project in New South Wales. Work on 
the 335MW project, capable of providing energy for 150,000 
homes for up to eight hours, is expected to begin in the 
second half of 2025 if approved and will take at least four 
years to complete.
	
	 Fast-start gas generation assets like the new 320MW Tallawarra B power station will play an increasingly critical role in 
providing electricity at peak periods and times of low sunshine and wind in Australia.

CEO’s Strategic Review


The new investments complement EnergyAustralia’s plan 
to expand its renewable portfolio to include up to 3GW of 
renewable energy to be committed or operational by 2030. 
EnergyAustralia expects to support investment of more than 
A$5 billion in capital directly and with partners under its 
inaugural Climate Transition Action Plan (CTAP) released in 
August.
The CTAP was followed by an expansion of the Capacity 
Investment Scheme (CIS) by the Australian Government. The 
Wooreen project together with another battery project next 
to the Hallet gas-fired power station will be submitted to 
the first round of the newly expanded CIS that focuses on 
projects in Victoria and South Australia.
Despite several tariff increases, rising supply costs and 
intensifying competition drove EnergyAustralia’s retail 
business contribution lower than in 2022. The overall number 
of customer accounts fell by around 20,700, or 0.8%, in 2023, 
while the rate of customer churn remained below the market 
average. Despite the goodwill impairment, the Customer 
business remains a key component of the EnergyAustralia 
integrated business model. 
EnergyAustralia is keenly aware that inflation weighs heavily 
on customers and does its utmost to support them through 
a variety of payment plans and extension arrangements. 
Help for customers impacted by financial hardship is 
available under the EnergyAssist and Rapid Business Assist 
programmes.
EnergyAustralia is firmly focused on making further progress 
in its path of recovery through strengthening its operational 
performance. It will seek to expand its “behind-the-meter” 
energy solution offerings to customers in the areas of 
battery storage, solar energy and electric vehicles. With its 
strategy of providing simple solutions to customers and its 
flexible, expanding portfolio, EnergyAustralia is committed 
to participating sustainably in the country’s vital energy 
transition.
India
Our joint venture Apraava Energy made good progress 
in expanding and diversifying its low-carbon portfolio to 
support the decarbonisation of India’s energy sector and 
to meet the rising demand for power. Successful bids were 
made for new wind, solar and transmission projects. The 
business also made a successful entry into the emerging 
advanced metering infrastructure (AMI) sector.
The joint venture also delivered a significant improvement 
in financial performance. Operating earnings in 2023 were 
HK$301 million, up 56.0% from a year earlier, driven by 
Jhajjar Power Station’s strong operating efficiency and 
performance with solid contribution from Apraava Energy’s 
renewable portfolio. The business benefitted from higher 
interest income after the Madhya Pradesh state utility 
made payments towards outstanding dues for output from 
Chandgarh Wind Farm, while utilities in other states also 
adhered to the new late payment surcharge rules introduced 
by the Government of India. 
Apraava Energy won bids to develop a greenfield wind 
energy project with a capacity of around 300MW in 
Karnataka state and a 250MW solar energy project in 
Rajasthan state, demonstrating the surge in opportunities 
offered by India’s fast-expanding renewable energy market. 
Construction of the solar farm – Apraava Energy’s first 
greenfield solar energy project – will begin in the first quarter 
of 2024 and it is due to begin operations in 2026. The wind 
farm in Karnataka is also due to go into service in 2026.
Apraava Energy also won bids to develop three greenfield 
interstate transmission projects. Two are in Rajasthan 
involving a total of about 250 kilometres of 400 kilovolt (kV) 
transmission lines and a pooling substation that will allow 
20GW of renewable energy to feed into the grid. Both are 
expected to be completed in 2025. The third project, awarded 
in December 2023, is in Madhya Pradesh and includes a 
4,000 mega volt amp (MVA) substation and approximately 
41 kilometres of 765kV transmission lines to cater to rising 
demand across the state. It is expected to take around 
two years to build after the required approvals, which are 
anticipated to be granted in 2024.
Smart meters have an important role to play in India’s energy 
transition by helping to balance supply and demand in the 
electricity market. Apraava Energy established a foothold in  
this key segment by securing two AMI projects in Assam and  
Gujarat states. More than 2.3 million smart meters will be 
installed for customers in Gujarat and around 700,000 in Assam.
The 251MW Sidhpur Wind Farm in Gujarat state is due to be 
completed in the first half of 2024 following delays caused 
by land use disagreements that held up the installation of 
transmission infrastructure. The plant has been put into 
service in phases with more than half its generation capacity 
currently in operation.
Apraava Energy’s greenhouse gas reduction target was 
validated as being in line with the target of limiting global 
warming to 1.5°C above pre-industrial levels by the Science 
Based Targets initiative (SBTi), a recognised international 
body promoting decarbonisation for businesses worldwide. 
Apraava Energy was one of only a handful of power 
companies in India to achieve this validation and the 
achievement highlights its leadership role in decarbonisation.
Wind energy assets performed well throughout the year with 
overall output increasing 23% due to higher resources and 
partial commissioning of Sidhpur. Generation from Apraava 
Energy’s operating solar energy assets increased by 12% 
compared with the previous year.

CLP Holdings 2023 Annual Report


Apraava Energy’s only coal-fired asset, Jhajjar Power Station, 
maintained its reputation as one of India’s best-run thermal 
power plants and achieved a record level of generation. 
Jhajjar also promoted sustainable energy sources by co-firing 
more biomass than any other coal-fired power station in the 
country. The power station benefitted from a one-off income 
emanating from an interim settlement of an ongoing dispute 
with its main electricity purchasers over contractual and 
operational issues dating back to 2012. This is reflected in our 
accounts as an item affecting comparability.
With the stalwart support of the CLP Group and CDPQ, 
Apraava Energy will continue to explore growth opportunities 
to strengthen its portfolio of renewable energy plants and 
transmission and AMI projects. The company’s expansion and 
commitment to decarbonisation make us an influential player 
in India’s ambitious energy transition.
Taiwan Region and Thailand
During the year, Ho-Ping Power Station in the Taiwan Region 
maintained reliable operations, with its financial performance 
benefitting from lower coal costs and higher energy tariff 
following an amendment to the tariff reimbursement 
mechanism in July 2022. Contributions from Lopburi Solar 
Farm in Thailand remained stable. As a result, operating 
earnings for Taiwan Region and Thailand increased to 
HK$307 million from HK$11 million a year earlier. 
Ho-Ping will continue to focus on strengthening its operations 
with a scheduled maintenance outage on one of its two 
generation units in the first quarter of 2024.
Powering Brighter Tomorrows
At a time of enormous change in the energy sector, we are 
working tirelessly to ensure CLP Group is well positioned 
to thrive in all of the markets in which we operate. As the 
Chairman noted in his message, the principal priority for our 
business is decarbonisation. This is an urgent and complex 
task, but we have both the commitment and roadmap to 
meet the challenge. Guided by our strategic focus, during 
the year we advanced resolutely towards our own net zero 
goal, aligning our efforts with the broader decarbonisation 
initiatives taking shape across all our markets.
Reflecting on my 35-year journey with CLP, our enduring 
focus on long-term, sustainable growth has never been 
more pronounced. Today more than ever, it is critical for 
us to upskill and reskill our people so that we are ready for 
change. We also need to ensure a strong pipeline of talent 
to meet our needs. As part of our holistic approach in talent 
development, we invest tremendous resources to support the 
professional growth of our people and generate the  
interest of students and young people in pursuing careers  
in the electricity industry. We have an established,  
long-term strategy to cultivate them with a powerful sense 
of belonging, trust and cooperation combined with the 
leadership skills to carry our business forward.
The decarbonisation process isn't just a challenge; it's an 
opportunity for diversified and profitable growth. Across 
our markets, we are capitalising on opportunities that yield 
robust returns, providing low-carbon solutions, and ensuring 
the delivery of safe, reliable and secure energy services to our 
customers and communities. As we do so, we are harnessing 
digital technologies throughout every level of the Group to 
optimise our business processes and introduce new ways of 
working in a manner tailored for the specific markets in which 
we are present. This integration is geared towards producing 
faster, better and more cost-effective outcomes for our 
customers, colleagues and partners.
As decarbonisation and digitalisation reshape the electricity 
sector, we must work hard to train and develop the visionary 
and highly motivated industry leaders who will carry the 
energy transition forward in the vital years ahead.
I would like to thank all of our valued shareholders and 
customers for the trust they place in CLP. I also extend my 
thanks to my outstanding colleagues, whose care, excellence 
and responsibility are critical to our success. Our culture 
is crucial to making our aspirations a reality and we will 
implement further initiatives to ensure we remain efficient, 
people-centric and agile in how we operate. We will place 
more of our resources and expertise even closer to our 
customers, while ensuring that we have the appropriate level 
of governance in place to reflect the evolving nature of our 
business.
Despite our uncertain world, the prospects for CLP remain 
clear. We have a great business and an unwavering intent to 
take it into the next chapter of growth. We are grateful for 
your steadfast support as we help shape the future of energy 
to the benefit of all of our stakeholders.

CEO’s Strategic Review


Mr Liu Wing Keung
Shareholder
CLP is one of the most familiar and trusted brands in Hong Kong. I feel deeply privileged to have the opportunity to 
lead the company forward at this exciting moment in its long history.
For more than 120 years, CLP has succeeded by anticipating and embracing changes in the market. Our proven 
capacity to transform ourselves and explore new horizons fills me with excitement and confidence in my new role 
as I work closely with my colleagues to deliver our key strategies.
Decarbonisation is CLP’s top priority. We understand the critical role the electricity sector has in the fight against 
climate change, and we are committed to playing our part in this urgent and complex challenge. We recently 
reviewed our Climate Vision 2050 roadmap and strengthened our 2030 greenhouse gas emissions intensity target 
to bring us closer to the goal of limiting global warming to 1.5°C. As well as lowering our own emissions, we do all 
we can to help customers reduce their carbon footprint. Meanwhile, digitalisation will be another major factor in 
our future growth. We must constantly enhance our digital capabilities and integrate new technologies into our 
operations to stay ahead of the curve. 
Our overarching purpose to Power Brighter Tomorrows requires more than just new technology and infrastructure. 
It also calls for investment in our people to build a strong pipeline of talent to lead our company forward. We must  
cultivate the desired values and culture so as to maintain our solid foundation while encouraging agility and 
innovation to meet rapidly evolving energy needs. I have shared with colleagues my expectation for them to learn, 
unlearn and relearn as we accelerate our efforts to pursue excellence as guided by our refreshed Value Framework. 
To build a future-proof organisation together, I call on my colleagues to retain a keen sense of curiosity and 
adaptability that we all had when we were children.
The significant strides forward we have taken in the past year put us in a powerful position 
to seize the opportunities offered by the energy transition as we continue to build a 
sustainable business that creates long-term value for our stakeholders.

ordinary dividends with steady growth when supported by 
our earnings whilst ensuring that a solid financial position 
can be maintained to fund our business growth.
The Group’s financial performance, and ultimately the 
Group’s operating earnings, are of paramount importance in 
CLP’s ability to stick to the Group’s Dividends Policy. Taking 
into account the strong financial performance for the year, 
our robust financial position and our capacity to finance the 
investment plan of the Group, total dividends per share for 
2023 are therefore maintained at HK$3.10.
More analysis on the value we created for our shareholders 
can be found on pages 38 and 39.
Strategy to Power Brighter Tomorrows
We remain focused on decarbonising and digitalising our operations in order to create value for our stakeholders and 
the communities in which we operate. Meanwhile, we are also building greater organisational agility through workforce 
transformation to equip ourselves for future opportunities. CLP underpins great effort to ensure Hong Kong remains a 
vibrant international centre, one that is playing a leading role in Asia in the transition to a net-zero future. We have a strong 
commitment to decarbonisation and pursue diversified investment opportunities in our overseas markets. Additionally, we 
are continuously enhancing our digital capabilities to not only deliver operational excellence for our businesses, but also 
provide bespoke energy service solutions to our customers.
Progress on the Execution of Our Strategy
Our commitment to invest for Hong Kong’s low-carbon future continue being evidenced through the new offshore LNG 
terminal which has been in service since July 2023, the construction of unit D2 at Black Point Power Station, and the 
enhancement of the Clean Energy Transmission System (CETS), which allows more imports of zero-carbon energy from 
Mainland China. Renewable portfolio in Mainland China was expanded at an accelerated pace with the commissioning of 
Xundian II wind project and Yangzhou Gongdao solar project, as well as the commencement of construction of Bobai wind 
farm in 2023. Sandu II wind farms and two other solar projects are due to start work soon.
The construction of Australia’s first net-zero emissions power plant, Tallawarra B, continued during the year and is now 
completing commissioning. Commercial operation of Riverina and Darlington Point, New South Wales’s largest energy 
storage system of which EnergyAustralia has market control for contracted output, commenced in September. In India, 
over 50% of the Sidhpur wind project was commissioned in 2023. Our joint venture, Apraava Energy also entered into the 
advanced metering infrastructure market.
Adequate Resources to Support Our Strategy
Free cash flow represents the cash that can be used by a company after taking care of its operations. It can be used to 
remunerate equity and debt holders and to grow the business.
Strong operating cash inflow from the SoC business continues to be the key source of funds for our capital investment 
programme and dividend payment in 2023. Our free cash flow also benefited from the refund of futures margin deposits 
and recovering operational performance at EnergyAustralia. During the year, we continue to carry out sustainable financing 
activities under Climate Action Finance Framework, for specific projects, and arrange Emission Reduction-Linked bank facilities 
with performance targets linked to emissions level for general corporate purposes.

in late December 2022, which reduced CLP Group’s equity interest in Apraava Energy from 60% to 50%. Apraava 
Energy is therefore now accounted for as a joint venture, so its financial results are no longer line-by-line consolidated 
into the CLP Group’s consolidated financial statements. CLP gets its share of earnings (one-line equity consolidation) 
but not revenue nor expenses. Had the equity accounting basis been adopted in 2022, the share of results (60%)  
of Apraava Energy would have been HK$193 million as compared to HK$1,425 million included in Consolidated 
EBITDAF for the year ended 31 December 2022.

*	 Excluding items affecting comparability
 
Hong Kong: Mainly reflected higher permitted return on 
higher average SoC net fixed assets and five-year energy 
saving and renewable energy connections incentives earned 
for the first time under the current SoC
 
Mainland China: Lower nuclear earnings due to higher 
operating and maintenance expenses at Yangjiang despite 
record high generation, and large-scale planned outage 
at Daya Bay; renewable earnings marginally lower than 
2022 because of lower water resource largely offset by the 
commissioning of Xundian II wind project and Yangzhou 
Gongdao solar project; loss (2022: profit) from Guohua coal-
fired projects due to planned outage of one unit at Panshan 
and reduction in tariffs in 2023; and higher expenses to 
support the growth trajectory of renewable energy projects
 
Australia: Big swing from loss to substantial EBITDAF; 
Energy business improved operationally and commercially 
after 2022 which was heavily penalised by costs for settling 
sold forward contracts not covered due to generation 
shortfall under record high wholesale electricity price 
environment, Yallourn delivered higher realised prices 
and gas portfolio gross margin was higher in 2023; lower 
contribution from Customer business due to higher realised 
energy procurement costs in 2023 and one-off favourable 
hedging outcomes under volatile market conditions in 2022 
not repeated, partially offset by several tariff increases 
since the second half of 2022
 
India: After adjusting the impact of change in accounting 
method for our interest in Apraava Energy (-HK$1,232 
million as discussed in the previous page) and 10% reduction 
in interest (-HK$32 million), higher Apraava Energy’s results 
mainly contributed by Jhajjar’s strong operating efficiency 
and performance; higher delayed payment charge income 
and higher natural resources for renewable projects; and 
higher earnings from transmission project with lower 
financing costs
 
Taiwan Region and Thailand: Following the amendment of 
the energy tariff reimbursement mechanism effective July 
2022, the under-recovery of rising coal costs resulting from 
the lagging adjustment mechanism in the first half of 2022 
was not repeated, share of Ho-Ping’s results substantially 
improved to HK$297 million; sound operations of Lopburi 
solar farm

	 Hong Kong: Higher gain on sales of Argyle Street properties 
with more units sold in 2023 offset by smaller revaluation 
loss of retail portion of Laguna Mall in line with property 
market trend
	 Mainland China: Recognition of an impairment provision of 
fixed assets and write-off of deferred tax assets with a total 
loss of HK$115 million triggered by reduction in utilisation 
hours (resulted from the dry weather and increased 
upstream water usage) and continuous low tariff for Dali 
Yang_er hydro project
	 Australia: EnergyAustralia’s Customer business was 
affected by adverse energy retail market trends, notably, 
margins are under increasing pressure as a result of 
rising supply costs and intensifying competition; whilst 
higher interest rates have also negatively impacted the 
Customer business’ cost of capital and as a consequence, an 
impairment of energy retail goodwill of HK$5,868 million 
was recognised as “other charge” in the profit or loss (Note 
4(a) to the Financial Statements)
	 India: One-off recognition of income relating to delayed 
payment charges on disputed and long outstanding trade 
receivables and additional capacity charge upon cash 
settlements received by Jhajjar

Liabilities (2023: HK$3,377 million; 2022: HK$6,715 million;  49.7%)
Derivative financial instruments are primarily used to hedge 
foreign exchange, interest rate and energy price risks. At 31 
December 2023, the fair value of these derivative instruments 
was a net deficit of HK$1,127 million, representing the net 
amount payable if these contracts were closed out at year end.
	 Hong Kong: Fair value loss charged to equity for cross 
currency interest rate swaps under cash flow hedges mainly 
attributable to the weakening of foreign currencies against 
Hong Kong dollar in forward exchange rate markets
	 Australia: Change from net derivative liabilities to assets 
for energy forward contracts mainly due to continuous 
settlement of out-of-the-money energy contracts during  
the year and fair value gains of our sold energy contracts  
(+HK$1.2 billion) credited to profit or loss due to lower forward

	 Hong Kong: Receivable remains at similar level in line with 
stable operations; increase in capex creditors pursuant to 
the progress of mega projects largely offset by lower fuel 
purchase related payables with reduced fuel prices from  
the peak in 2023
	 Mainland China: Higher accrued renewable national subsidies 
from sales during the year; and significant decrease in other 
receivables as a result of the receipts of the consideration 
from the sale of Fangchenggang of HK$1.6 billion and prior 
year dividend from Yangjiang; more business development 
and construction works to grow our renewable pipeline 
resulted in higher payables at year end
	 Australia: Higher retail debtors on higher tariffs; and 
reduction of cash deposits by HK$3.2 billion made to 
futures margin account in line with the favourable fair value 
movements of futures energy contracts; slight increase in 
payables driven by higher accruals for capex, coal purchases 
for Mount Piper and annual incentives provision (2022: nil) 
in 2023 substantially offset by lower electricity purchase 
payable at lower wholesale spot prices and lower green

Analysis of Financial Obligations
Consolidated financial statements are prepared to show the effect as if the parent and all of its subsidiaries were one entity by 
consolidating their financial statements on a line-by-line basis. In contrast, under the equity method of accounting, interests in 
joint ventures and interests in associates are accounted for on the basis of proportionate sharing of net assets (i.e. assets minus 
liabilities). As a result, the debts of our joint ventures and associates are not included as part of the debts shown in our consolidated 
statement of financial position. To enhance the transparency to readers, the diagram below illustrates the financial obligations of 
the CLP Group, as well as those of our joint ventures and associates.

Free Cash Flow (2023: HK$21,866 million; 2022: HK$11,080 million;  97.3%)
	 Free cash flow increased by HK$10.8 billion because of:
–	 Hong Kong: Improvement in cash inflow from SoC operations (+HK$8.1 billion) primarily due to partial recovery of under-
collected fuel costs of HK$3.3 billion (2022: under-recovery of HK$2.4 billion) and lower fuel payments in line with the 
movements of fuel prices in these two years; offset by higher tax paid (-HK$0.8 billion) due to timing of payment and higher 
profit
–	 Mainland China: Robust dividends from our nuclear associates and steady operating cashflow of renewable subsidiaries
–	 Australia: Cash flow from operations returned to a positive of HK$3.3 billion (2022: negative of HK$2.9 billion) largely 
attributable to refund of cash deposits from the futures margin account of HK$3.2 billion (2022: payment of HK$2.5 billion)
–	 India: Dividend of HK$202 million received from Apraava Energy joint venture in 2023 as compared with free cash flow of 
HK$0.8 billion (represented fund from operations of HK$1.3 billion less net finance costs paid of HK$0.5 billion) consolidated 
in 2022
	 Proceeds from divestment: Consideration from the sale of Fangchenggang received in 2023
	 Capital investments include:
–	 HK$10.1 billion of SoC capex for progress of construction of low-carbon generation facilities, development / enhancement of

Delivering  
Our Sustainability 
Agenda
Enabling our enduring focus 
on long-term growth, creating 
value for our stakeholders.


CLP provides sustainable energy solutions to create value for capital providers, customers, employees and the wider 
community. We aim to be a leading responsible energy provider, from one generation to the next, in order to deliver 
our purpose: to Power Brighter Tomorrows.
Major utilities like CLP have an important role to play in the functioning of society, acting as trusted partners 
to customers, governments, regulators and the community as a whole in our collective journey to a 
decarbonised future. We have also been the employer of choice to engineering and other top 
talent, and form a key part of the energy value chain, both as a consumer and provider 
of energy and related services. We understand the responsibilities inherent in 
serving the community as a utility and strive to set a benchmark for excellence 
in our service delivery.
This year, CLP continues to adopt the double materiality 
approach, which was first applied in 2021 based on a three-year 
cycle. The double materiality concept expands the traditional focus 
of materiality on stakeholder impacts to also consider the financial effects of 
sustainability topics that may reasonably be expected to affect the business’s cash 
flows, access to finance or cost of capital in the short, medium and long term, and these 
topics are covered by this Delivering Our Sustainability Agenda chapter in the Annual Report. The 
Sustainability Report, meanwhile, focuses on sustainability topics that have a material impact on 
people, the environment and the economy. With 2023 being Year 3 of the cycle, the focus of the 
assessment was on revalidation of the findings from Year 1 and Year 2, and the incorporation of 
incremental changes. The double materiality assessment complements CLP’s risk management 
process, which is detailed in the Risk Management Report in the Annual Report and takes into 
account the material topics identified by the assessment. 
When preparing the 2023 reporting suite, we voluntarily made reference to the recently released 
International Sustainability Standards Board’s (ISSB’s) IFRS S1 and S2 Standards, which relate 
to general purpose sustainability financial disclosures and climate-related financial disclosures 
respectively. While our Annual Report does not meet all the provisions of the standards yet, we 
have made strong progress in closing the gap. In addition, our materiality assessment process and 
results were externally assured for the first time to underline the rigour of our methodology and 
long-standing commitment to best practice sustainability strategy and reporting.
Adopting 
the double 
materiality 
approach
As we seize the opportunities associated with the industry’s growth, driven 
in large part by the decarbonisation, electrification and digitisation of 
infrastructure, we are mindful of the benefits that a strategic approach to 
sustainability can bring.
That’s why CLP conducts comprehensive annual materiality assessments to 
evaluate and respond to the sustainability matters most likely to impact our 
business and stakeholders. These assessments ensure our corporate strategy 
and sustainability ambitions remain aligned, help us respond to evolving 
stakeholder needs, uncover emerging sustainability risks and opportunities, 
and support transparent public reporting.
Overview
CLP Holdings 2023 Annual Report
42


The megatrends form the basis for us to identify 
and assess sustainability-related impacts, risks and 
opportunities (IROs). In addition, we drew on a range of 
internal and external sources – including CLP strategy 
and risk documentation, extensive interviews collating 
views from internal stakeholders, and scrutiny of the 
latest reporting standard to determine those IROs.
This comprehensive process initially identified 69 IROs, 
which were then assessed for materiality using our 
own enterprise risk framework and by incorporating 
the latest ISSB and Global Reporting Initiative (GRI) 
guidelines.
After evaluating for magnitude/severity and likelihood, 
49 IROs were assessed as “High” or “Extreme” and 
therefore material to CLP. These sustainability-related 
IROs were organised under six material topics and 18 
sub-topics. The six topics play a key role in informing 
CLP’s strategy, keeping its risk register up-to-date, 
supporting its reporting initiatives and generating 
sustainable returns for CLP’s capital providers in 2024 
and beyond.
The assessment process was conducted by a working 
group of internal and external materiality experts, with 
participation from CLP’s Group Sustainability, Group 
Risk Management, Investor Relations and Corporate 
Affairs teams. Assessment outcomes were refined and 
validated by the Sustainability Executive Committee and 
endorsed by the CLP Holdings Sustainability Committee.
In 2021, we identified nine megatrends that were most likely to affect our 
business and operating environment. Following a detailed review in 2023, the 
megatrends are confirmed to remain relevant in CLP’s current operating context.
Identifying and assessing 
our sustainability agenda 
CLP seeks to manage and respond to those 
sustainability-related financial risks and 
opportunities which may reasonably be expected 
to affect our cash flows, access to finance or cost 
of capital in the short, medium and long term. 
With reference to the IFRS guidance, we then 
disclose material information about these risks and 
opportunities to investors in this Delivering Our 
Sustainability Agenda chapter in the Annual Report. 
Information is considered material if omitting, 
misstating or obscuring it could reasonably be 
expected to influence investment decisions.

TRANSITION TO NET ZERO
CLP is decarbonising its existing asset base, investing in electricity infrastructure, ensuring the delivery 
of reliable and reasonably priced energy, and acting as a trusted partner for customers, communities, 
governments and investors in the transition to a just and fair energy future.
ENERGY GROWTH OPPORTUNITIES
Different regulatory environments across CLP’s markets affect growth opportunities locally. In 
Mainland China, especially in the Greater Bay Area, opportunities are significant due to the region’s 
large population and its proximity to CLP’s home market of Hong Kong. This offers prospects for 
mutually beneficial joint venture partnerships with public and private sector partners to accelerate 
the energy transition in line with government objectives, scale up electricity generation to meet 
rising demand as other sectors electrify, and introduce new energy products and services that meet 
customer needs.
ENERGY SECURITY AND RELIABILITY
Energy security and reliability have been impacted by an uncertain geopolitical environment and 
supply chain disruptions over recent years. Higher fuel prices have resulted in assets running at 
reduced capacity, which has increased costs for CLP and its customers alike. The Group must balance 
two vital and sometimes competing objectives: providing customers with reliable and affordable 
energy while continuing to make progress with its decarbonisation objectives.
A SAFE, FUTURE-READY WORKFORCE
CLP’s long-term success relies on its capability to attract, develop and retain a workforce that is safe 
and healthy, diverse and inclusive, skilled for the future, and well-supported to fulfil the customer 
demands of today, as well as to adapt rapidly to the social and technological changes brought by 
energy transition. Workplace safety, wellbeing and flexibility are top priorities. So too is the attraction, 
development and retention of diverse talent, with a focus on the skills needed to advance CLP’s critical 
decarbonisation and digitalisation agendas.
BUSINESS RESILIENCE
The accelerating pace of environmental, technological, regulatory and social changes has reinforced 
the importance of business resilience. CLP recognises the strategic value of anticipating, withstanding 
and learning from disruptive events, especially in response to the growing threats posed by climate 
change and cybercrime.
COMMUNITY STEWARDSHIP
CLP recognises its obligations to meet evolving stakeholder expectations around the positive role 
businesses should play in society. This includes demonstrating leadership in its decarbonisation 
ambitions, investing in green energy solutions that support the electrification of society, and 
transparently reporting on its ESG performance. Environmental stewardship extends to actively 
managing CLP’s dependencies and impacts on nature. Employee and supplier wellbeing is another 
priority. The Group recognises the importance of ensuring ethical human rights practices in its value 
chain, as well as of supporting employees and communities impacted by the closure of its fossil fuel 
assets.
The following six sections are dedicated to the discussion of the sustainability-related financial 
risks and opportunities that were considered “High” or “Extreme” by the assessment.

Overview


Decarbonisation is CLP’s foremost priority as the electricity sector has a crucial role to play in enabling the transition to a 
sustainable, lower-carbon future for all. Electricity companies worldwide need to keep abreast of evolving climate policies to 
ensure their decarbonisation plans and actions are in line with regulations. They also need to stay attuned to decarbonisation 
technologies to invest in non-carbon energy infrastructure such as wind and solar power, nuclear power and battery energy 
storage systems (BESS) as coal-fired generation is being phased out.
Decarbonisation requires huge amounts of capital. Energy providers, acting as a trusted partner in the energy transition, have 
a responsibility to maintain sound financial foundations and to meet the rising expectations of investors on acting in the best 
interest of the community and the environment. Carbon markets offer potential solutions for decarbonising hard-to-abate sectors 
of the economy, and energy companies need to support efforts to improve their quality and consistency.
in November, and Federal and State Governments agreed 
to work closely together to prevent a repeat of the energy 
shocks of 2022 that affected suppliers. 
Meanwhile, the Indian Government aims to more than 
double the country’s renewable energy capacity to 500 
gigawatts (GW) by 2030, and continued to roll out policies 
to drive investments in infrastructure to support the energy 
transition, including transmission and advanced metering 
infrastructure (AMI).
Accelerating the pace of decarbonisation
CLP’s decarbonisation efforts are reflected by a 12% 
decrease in total greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions (Scope 1, 2 
and 3) across the value chain to 52,988 kilotonnes of carbon 
dioxide equivalent (kt CO2e) on an equity basis in 2023. The 
GHG emissions intensity of electricity sold dropped to 0.54kg 
CO2e per kilowatt hour (kWh), lower than the 0.55kg CO2e per 
kWh a year earlier. Energy sent out from coal and gas assets 
fell 12%.
CLP’s Climate Vision 2050 decarbonisation blueprint has 
guided its business strategy since 2007. This blueprint has 
undergone regular reviews and updates to ensure its targets 
stay in line with changing climate science, technologies and 
policies. Following a review concluded in early 2024, 
Responding to evolving regulatory landscapes 
Governments around the world agreed to transition away 
from fossil fuels and speed up the adoption of renewable 
energy at the 28th United Nations Climate Change Conference 
(COP28) in Dubai during another year of record global 
temperatures.
In Hong Kong, under the Government’s Climate Action Plan 
2050, the ratio of zero-carbon energy in the fuel mix for 
electricity needs to increase to 60-70% by 2035 on the way 
to net-zero power generation by 2050. 
China strengthened cooperation with the US in November to 
step up development of renewable energy. The initiative  
underscored the Chinese Government’s steadfast commitment 
 
to decarbonisation, guided by its dual carbon targets of 
peaking carbon emissions by 2030 and achieving carbon 
neutrality by 2060. Driven by these goals, China already leads 
the world in solar energy and BESS technology.
In Australia, steps were taken at both federal and state levels 
to enable the energy transition, with increased support for 
low-carbon electricity infrastructure to boost supplies and 
mitigate the risk of shortfalls as coal-fired power stations 
are retired. The Capacity Investment Scheme to develop 
renewable energy and energy storage systems was expanded

Climate Vision 2050 was updated to strengthen targets to decarbonise the Group’s business at a faster pace. Under the 
updated edition entitled Climate Vision 2050: Powering an orderly transition, CLP committed to reducing the GHG emissions 
intensity of electricity sold to 0.26kg CO2e/kWh by 2030, compared to the previous target of 0.3kg CO2e/kWh. 
CLP is maintaining its target to reduce absolute Scope 3  
GHG emissions from the use of sold products by 28% 
by 2030, from 2019 levels. This refers to the emissions 
from customers’ combustion of the natural gas sold by 
EnergyAustralia. In addition, the Group’s targets to reduce 
GHG emissions intensity of electricity sold to 0.1kg CO2e/kWh 
by 2040, and achieve net zero by 2050 remained unchanged. 
The Group is committed to reviewing its targets for Climate 
Vision 2050 at least every three years. 
Please see CLP’s Climate Vision 2050 – Powering 
an orderly transition for further information on the 
latest decarbonisation strategies and targets. 
EnergyAustralia released its inaugural Climate Transition 
Action Plan (CTAP) in August. The plan outlines how the 
company will achieve net-zero Scope 1 and Scope 2  
emissions by 2050 through a combination of actions 
including the retirement of coal-fired power plants and 
the development of renewable energy and energy storage 
capacity. EnergyAustralia will publish its decarbonisation 
plan for Scope 3 emissions, including customer energy-use 
emissions, by December 2024.
Apraava Energy announced a target of reducing the intensity 
of its Scope 1 and Scope 2 emissions by 46.3% by 2027 
compared with 2022. The target was validated by the Science 
Based Targets initiative (SBTi), making Apraava Energy only 
the second Indian power company to receive SBTi validation.

Investing in zero-carbon energy 
infrastructure
CLP continued to focus on investments to enable the energy 
transition. Non-carbon generation assets, and transmission, 
distribution and retail operations accounted for 49% of the 
Group's capital investments of HK$15,674 million, on an 
accrual basis.
Investments in Hong Kong include the upgrading of the  
cross-boundary Clean Energy Transmission System (CETS) for 
the import of more zero-carbon energy from Mainland China, 
as well as the completion of the smart meter replacement 
programme, which will help customers better understand and 
manage their electricity use.
CLP China stepped up the pace of renewable energy 
investment as the falling costs of wind and solar energy 
equipment made new projects more viable. At the end of the 
year, CLP China’s renewable energy capacity increased to 
more than 2GW across the nation and is expected to double 
in the medium term. 
EnergyAustralia set a target of expanding its renewable energy 
portfolio to 3GW of committed and operational capacity  
by 2030, up from around 900 megawatts (MW) at present. 
In 2023, Apraava Energy secured 550MW of new renewable 
energy projects in competitive auctions and entered the 
AMI market to further diversify its non-carbon energy 
infrastructure business. The company also expanded its 
portfolio of transmission assets so that renewable energy 
generated in remote areas can be used in urban centres. 
A future without coal
Under Climate Vision 2050, CLP is committed to phasing out 
coal-fired generation before 2040. The company stepped 
up efforts to ensure a smooth transition with a reliable and 
affordable supply of electricity ready for a future without 
coal. 
Units at Castle Peak A Power Station in Hong Kong are 
gradually being retired and coal is not expected to be used 
for regular electricity generation in Castle Peak B Station 
beyond 2035. The completion in 2024 of the new D2 gas-
fired generator unit at Black Point Power Station, together 
with the existing D1 unit, will deliver a reliable, lower-
carbon power supply as CLP gradually phases out coal-fired 
generation.
EnergyAustralia is adapting Mount Piper Power Station in 
New South Wales to more flexible, short-duration operations. 
Modifications have been made to its generation units to enable 
safe operations at low loads so that it can reduce or increase 
generation according to market conditions. The power station 
is due to be transitioned to play a firming role for renewable 
energy by the mid-2030s before being retired before 2040. 
EnergyAustralia’s only other coal-fired power station, 
Yallourn Power Station in Victoria, will close in 2028. 
To safeguard the livelihoods and interests of employees 
and communities, workers at Yallourn are provided with 
transitional support, including training and guidance on 
future career development as part of EnergyAustralia’s  
A$10 million Power Your Future programme.

CLP Holdings 2023 Annual Report


The real estate industry has been a role model for other sectors of the economy by actively responding to national 
policies to reduce carbon emissions. CLP fully supports the industry’s leadership position on decarbonisation as the 
nation pushes ahead with the dual carbon policies for the comprehensive green transformation of economic and 
social development.
In line with our Climate Vision 2050 blueprint, CLP focuses on the development of renewable energy in Mainland 
China where zero-carbon energy now accounts for almost 70% of our installed capacity. Our Xundian II Wind Farm 
in Yunnan and Yangzhou Gongdao Solar Power Station in Jiangsu were successfully connected to the grid in 2023, 
and construction of our Bobai Wind Farm in Guangxi has commenced. We also broke ground on the Sandu II Wind 
Farm in Guizhou. 
We constantly explore new ways to offer renewable energy solutions for our corporate customers such as Shui 
On Xintiandi, a pioneer in decarbonisation. We understand that starting from 2011, your esteemed company has 
engaged an independent organisation to conduct annual carbon emission verification, and has since reduced your 
emissions by over 66%. We are extremely pleased to collaborate with corporates with a similar decarbonisation 
vision and signed a strategic framework agreement with your company in December 2023. With our shared 
heritage as Hong Kong enterprises, our partnership will concentrate on the development of zero-carbon energy and 
green power. One of the initiatives is a power purchase agreement to supply green power to meet all the power 
needs of the Nanjing International Finance Center. This project epitomises the kind of high-efficiency renewable 
energy solutions that will accelerate the zero-carbon transformation of the real estate sector.
CLP will continue to deepen our collaboration with businesses on new energy development 
to deliver mutually beneficial sustainability outcomes, supporting the nation’s dual-carbon 
goals.
According to the World Green Building Council, the 
construction industry is responsible for around 40% of global 
carbon emissions. Decarbonising the sector is therefore 
critical to the battle against climate change. Shui On 
Xintiandi’s prime commercial real estate portfolio spans fast-growing cities across the 
Mainland and is focused on carbon reduction across the entire life cycle of projects, from 
construction to estate management. What solutions can CLP China provide to help us 
become more sustainable and support the nation’s dual carbon goals of peaking carbon 
emissions by 2030 and achieving carbon neutrality by 2060?

Energy storage to bolster supply reliability
Energy storage plays a vital role in decarbonisation by 
making power grids more reliable as more intermittent 
renewable energy enters the system. CLP Power aims to 
build a BESS with a capacity of around 100MW at Castle Peak 
Power Station.
CLPe has found a promising avenue of growth in the strong 
demand for BESS from construction companies in Hong 
Kong, taking more than 40 orders for BESS on construction 
sites. CLP China is also investing in BESS to strengthen 
the operations of new renewable energy projects. Three 
battery systems are currently in operation, bolstering supply

reliability at Qian’an III Wind Farm in Jilin province, Xundian II 
Wind Farm in Yunnan province and Yangzhou Gongdao Solar 
Power Station in Jiangsu province.
Under CTAP, EnergyAustralia anticipates its initiatives 
on energy storage and renewable energy firming would 
involve more than A$5 billion of capital to be deployed 
by EnergyAustralia and its partners. EnergyAustralia 
has operational control of the new Riverina Stage 2 and 
Darlington Point BESS projects in New South Wales, which 
finished construction in September. It is also finalising plans 
to invest in the 350MW Wooreen battery system in Victoria 
next to Jeeralang Power Station, and examining battery 
projects near its Hallett Power Station in South Australia and 
Mount Piper Power Station in New South Wales. 
EnergyAustralia will have operational control of the 
250MW Kidston pumped hydro project in Queensland, due 
to complete construction in 2024. It is the first pumped 
hydro project in the Australian market in over 40 years, 
underpinned by an EnergyAustralia’s offtake agreement 
with developer Genex Power. In December, EnergyAustralia 
released the concept design of the 335MW Lake Lyell 
pumped hydro energy storage project in New South Wales.
Stable baseload electricity supply at competitive prices
Nuclear energy was acknowledged at the COP28 summit 
as one of the technologies that need to be accelerated to 
achieve climate global goals.
CLP has a 25% equity interest in Daya Bay Nuclear Power 
Station in Guangdong province, which meets around  
one-third of the electricity demand of CLP Power’s 
customers. Separately, CLP also has a 17% equity interest 
in Yangjiang Nuclear Power Station in Guangdong and 
continues to explore further opportunities to invest in the 
energy sector.
Please see the CEO’s Strategic Review on page 
16 and Energy Growth Opportunities on page 57 
for further information on CLP’s investments in 
decarbonisation.
Strong financial foundations for decarbonisation 
investments
CLP’s ongoing investments in decarbonisation were made 
possible by the Group’s strong financial position. Operating 
cash flow rose 85% to HK$23,567 million compared with 
HK$12,734 million a year earlier. The Group maintained  
good access to diversified, sustainable sources of  
cost-effective funding throughout a year of economic 
uncertainty and interest rate volatility, completing financing 
activities in a timely and orderly manner to support the 
business’s continued growth and development.
The strong financial position is reflected in the Group’s 
healthy liquidity levels, with undrawn bank facilities 
of HK$30.9 billion and bank balances of HK$5.2 billion 
respectively at the end of 2023 compared with  
HK$31.6 billion and HK$4.3 billion a year earlier. Liquidity 
at CLP Holdings increased to HK$14.1 billion at the end 
of the year compared with HK$13.5 billion a year earlier. 
The high level of liquidity is expected to be maintained in 
2024, supported by dividend payments and inflows from 
subsidiaries, joint ventures and associates.

Transition to Net Zero


Pre-emptive financing in volatile monetary 
environment
The uneven global recovery caused by the lingering effects of 
the pandemic and escalated geopolitical tensions continued 
to impact capital markets and generate pressure on inflation. 
Globally, central banks continued to tighten monetary 
policies to control inflation, maintaining interest rates at their 
highest levels since the global financial crisis. The yield of the 
benchmark 10-year US Treasury Notes surged from 3.74% in 
early January to 4.99% in October before retreating to 3.8% 
in December. Three-month Hong Kong Interbank Offered 
Rates reached a high of 5.73% during 2023, before softening 
to 5.27% by year end.
The Group took a pre-emptive approach and addressed the 
funding requirements for the year ahead at the end of 2022 
and in early 2023. In December 2022, CAPCO arranged  
HK$2 billion of one-year and two-year emission reduction-
linked bank loan facilities for its funding requirements in 2023. 
In the first half of 2023, CLP Power arranged HK$2.3 billion 
of one-year bank loan facilities and a HK$1.1 billion two-year 
emission reduction-linked bank loan facility.
Emission reduction-linked facilities are a type of sustainable 
financing with performance targets linked to air emissions, as 
well as other performance measures such as the number of 
smart meters installed.

CLP Holdings 2023 Annual Report


Sustainable financing instruments
The Climate Action Finance Framework (CAFF) remains 
CLP’s main channel for sustainable financing. The framework 
stipulates ways in which the Group’s businesses can raise 
financing including bonds and loans to address climate 
change challenges. In April, CAPCO executed a two-year 
offshore RMB300 million (HK$339 million) fixed rate private 
placement bond under CAFF and swapped the proceeds to 
Hong Kong dollars to refinance some existing bank loans. The 
bond was completed with preferential financing terms and 
was the first offshore RMB bond issuance for a CLP business, 
enabling further diversification in the Group’s financing.
In May and June, CAPCO executed HK$1.3 billion of one-year 
and two-year energy transition bank loan facilities in line 
with CAFF to refinance existing loans.
Both CLP Power and CAPCO have Medium Term Note 
programmes in place under which bonds in aggregate 
amounts of up to US$4.5 billion and US$2 billion respectively 
can be issued. As of 31 December, notes with aggregate 
nominal values of around HK$24.4 billion and HK$9.5 billion 
were issued by CLP Power and CAPCO respectively.
Around 62% of financing arranged by CLP’s SoC businesses in 
2023 was through sustainable financing compared with 68% 
the previous year. CLP Power and CAPCO had HK$32.2 billion 
of outstanding sustainable financing at the end of the 
year including HK$19 billion of CAFF financing, as well as 
HK$13.2 billion of emission reduction-linked facilities with 
14 banks.
CLP China executed a RMB293 million (HK$316 million) 
onshore non-recourse project loan facility for a solar energy 
project at a competitive interest rate. The business also 
lowered the interest rates of non-recourse project loans for 
three renewable energy projects totalling RMB718 million 
(HK$774 million).
EnergyAustralia executed a A$630 million (HK$3.3 billion) 
three-year loan facility with nine banks on competitive 
terms to refinance an existing facility. In addition, the 
business extended the tenor of a bank guarantee facility of 
A$150 million (HK$798 million) by one year to December 
2024.
CLP’s fixed-rate debt as a proportion of total debt at the 
end of December was 57% (2022: 52%), excluding perpetual 
capital securities or 60% (2022: 55%) including perpetual 
capital securities.
Navigating geopolitical instability
CLP’s prudent financing strategies, underpinned by robust 
governance and risk management, helped strengthen 
its capital resources to support the Group’s ongoing 
decarbonisation despite continuing market volatility. This 
approach was reflected in the pre-emptive action to complete 
major financing activities with preferential terms at the 
end of 2022 and early 2023, as well as the Group’s efforts 
to further diversify financing in terms of capital sources, 
currencies, debt tenor and instruments.
The Group maintained a high level of interest rate and 
foreign currency hedging at commercially acceptable terms 
to cover committed and highly probable financial obligations, 
enabling it to withstand financial market volatility and pursue 
its business objectives. This included the use of natural 
hedge and approved financial derivative instruments with 
straightforward, easy-to-understand features that can 
qualify for effective accounting hedge with no adverse profit-
and-loss impact to manage obligations and risks. 
For counterparty exposure, CLP transacts only with 
credible financial institutions and financially sound business 
counterparts with strong credit ratings. These measures help 
ensure CLP’s businesses do not face undue residual financial 
or credit risks and give strong grounds for confidence to 
stakeholders.
Acting as a trusted partner in the energy 
transition
CLP continued to engage capital providers on the Group’s 
efforts on decarbonisation. The Asia Investor Group on 
Climate Change’s Asian Utilities Engagement Program 
recognised the Group’s decarbonisation efforts including the 
commitment to exit coal-fired generation before 2040 and 
the use of battery storage technology.
During COP28, organisations including the Voluntary Carbon 
Markets Integrity Initiative (VCMI) and the Integrity Council 
for the Voluntary Carbon Markets (IC-VCM) agreed to 
increase collaboration on standards for carbon credits and 
enhance transparency and consistency for the instruments. 
CLP will consider the use of credible carbon offsets as a last 
resort to offset emissions in its value chain as the Group 
remains focused on reducing direct emissions from its 
operations by transitioning to lower-carbon technologies. CLP 
supports the efforts of the VCMI and IC-VCM to improve the 
integrity of voluntary carbon markets. The Group is currently 
undertaking a review on its carbon market strategy covering 
a range of factors including market trading opportunities and 
carbon credit generation from CLP’s assets. The review is 
expected to be completed this year.
EnergyAustralia’s Tallawarra B Power Station in New South 
Wales, which officially opened in February 2024, is Australia’s 
 
first net-zero emissions gas-fired power station with 100% of  
direct carbon emissions offset over its operational life. As part  
of funding arrangements to proceed with the construction of 
Tallawarra B in 2021, EnergyAustralia will purchase credible 
carbon offsets for all emissions from the plant.

Transition to Net Zero


The global energy crisis has had a profound impact on households and businesses, fueling inflation and hindering economic 
growth. It has also turbocharged investment in non-carbon energy as governments and corporations seek alternatives to costly 
fossil fuels, while consumers reduce their consumption and explore lower-carbon energy use as well as energy-saving tools and 
technologies.
As one of the largest energy companies in the Asia Pacific region, CLP has a responsibility to meet rising demand for low-carbon 
energy and smart energy solutions. As Hong Kong’s biggest utility company, CLP Power also has a duty to work closely with the 
Government to ensure the energy landscape adapts to changing times and provide consumers not only with reliable supply but 
also products and solutions they need for decarbonisation.
By responding nimbly and rapidly, CLP can rise to the challenges of uncertain times and generate income by providing innovative 
products and services including Energy-as-a-Service solutions that enhance energy efficiency. It can also develop smart solutions 
that have immense potential in Mainland China, Australia and India.
In the longer term, the electrification of transport and the wider economy open the door to a host of new business streams and 
opportunities both in Hong Kong and CLP’s other markets.
achieve their sustainability goals. Each unit of REC represents 
the environmental attributes of electricity produced by local 
renewable energy sources including solar power, wind power 
and land fill gas generated or purchased by CLP Power. The 
REC programme has boomed in popularity since its 2018 
launch with sales rising 70% year-on-year to more than 
170 gigawatt hours (GWh) in 2023. Some large commercial 
customers including AirTrunk Hong Kong Holding Limited,  
Citi Hong Kong and Bupa International Ltd. have signed  
multi-year REC agreements. The REC and FiT programmes 
enable CLP Power customers to increase renewable energy 
adoption as part of concerted efforts across society to drive 
Hong Kong’s decarbonisation.
The popularity of distributed energy resources including 
rooftop solar systems and EVs is increasing the complexity of 
electricity supply networks. CLP Power is continuing its smart 
grid development to support customers’ evolving energy 
needs and improve efficiencies in power network operations, 
while ensuring the electricity supply remains highly reliable 
and resilient. Key smart grid initiatives include the continued 
rollout of the smart meter replacement programme for  
Deploying customer-facing energy solutions
CLP Power serves over 80% of the Hong Kong population, 
and for generations has provided safe and reliable electricity 
needed by customers at a reasonable price. Public awareness 
of the impact of climate change has risen steeply in recent 
years and customers expect that their electricity comes from 
cleaner sources, with added services that help them become 
more energy-efficient.
To promote the development of renewable energy, CLP Power 
 
buys solar or wind energy generated by residential and 
business customers on their premises. The renewable 
energy Feed-in Tariff (FiT) scheme allows customers to sell 
their energy to CLP Power at a rate higher than the normal 
electricity tariff rate and recover their investment costs in 
a shorter period. By the end of 2023, 376MW of renewable 
energy capacity had been approved or connected to the 
grid, equivalent to the annual energy consumption of around 
89,700 households.
Customers can also buy Renewable Energy Certificates (RECs)

CLP Power continued to focus on supporting customers with 
a broad range of services to improve their energy efficiency. 
Under the All-Electric Homes programme, CLP Power is 
supporting property developers to adopt energy-efficient 
appliances such as induction cookers and water heaters 
in new apartments, promoting a lower-carbon lifestyle 
for homebuyers. CLP Power is also providing support for 
developers to install solar panels and EV-charging facilities to 
meet the energy needs of residents.
Business customers are offered advice and subsidies from 
CLP Power to implement electrification and energy-saving 
projects to support their decarbonisation targets. The CLP 
Eco Building Fund provides subsidies for energy efficiency 
improvement works for residential, commercial and industrial 
buildings. The Electrical Equipment Upgrade Scheme 
subsidises business customers, especially SMEs, to upgrade 
their lighting and air conditioning to more energy-efficient 
models. The Retro-Commissioning Charter programme 
offers professional training courses on how to improve the 
energy efficiency of buildings without the need for expensive 
equipment replacement.
As well as having a positive environmental impact, 
these schemes and programmes can potentially help 
customers qualify for sustainability-linked loans. Through 
its comprehensive range of energy services, CLP Power 
continued to deepen its customer relationships, evolving its 
business from a traditional electricity utility business model.
CLP Power and CLPe signed a Memorandum of 
Understanding with Link Asset Management Limited (Link) 
on energy efficiency and sustainability solutions. Under the 
agreement, CLP Power will provide technical support for EV 
charging systems and explore the feasibility of implementing 
energy management solutions at Link premises, as well as 
introducing battery energy storage systems (BESS) on Link 
construction sites to replace diesel generators. CLP Power  
will also promote energy saving to Link tenants. CLPe 
will work with Link to explore opportunities for one-stop 
energy solutions such as cooling, solar power, EV charging 
and smart energy management at Link properties in the 
Greater Bay Area (GBA). 
Digitalisation is crucial to the low-carbon transition, and 
CLP Power continued to provide customers with smart tools 
to enable energy efficiency improvements. More than 2,500 
CLP Power business customers are using the Smart Energy 
Online platform to manage energy consumption. The platform 
uses electricity consumption data from smart meters to 
effectively monitor and analyse the consumption patterns of 
business premises, enabling customers to save energy.
CLP Power continued to encourage residential customers to 
save energy, sign up for smart energy and energy-saving  
events and campaigns through the Power Connect 
programme which rewards them with points on an 
e-commerce platform called Domeo.

Energy Growth Opportunities


Increasing appetite for clean energy solutions
Outside of Hong Kong, CLP keeps pace with evolving demand 
by providing smart energy services that cater to customers’ 
increasing appetite for clean energy solutions. In 2023,  
CLP China signed four contracts with prominent companies 
in the form of power purchase agreements (PPAs) or 
Green Electricity Certificates to support the low-carbon 
transformation of a diverse range of industries including 
commercial real estate, manufacturing and data centres. 
One of them was a strategic framework agreement with 
Shui On Xintiandi (Shui On), which invests and manages 
premium commercial properties in Mainland China. The first 
initiative is a 10-year PPA which has seen Shui On’s Nanjing 
International Finance Center powered by the electricity 
generated by CLP China’s Yangzhou Gongdao Solar Power 
Station since the beginning of 2024. The arrangement will 
lower the commercial and office complex’s annual carbon 
emissions by an estimated 21,000 tonnes, which is equivalent 
to the carbon sequestration impact of 140 hectares of forest, 
as well as securing a steady revenue source for CLP China’s 
Yangzhou Gongdao project.
These partnerships underscore the growing demand for 
renewable energy from companies in China as the nation’s 
dual carbon goals drive the economy’s continuing low-carbon 
transition. CLP China will continue to expand its investments 
in renewable energy generation and maintain its strong 
growth momentum.
EnergyAustralia offered households the chance to reduce 
emissions with a Solar Home Bundle which provides them 
with a solar panel and battery system installed and managed 
with no upfront costs. By the end of 2023, 314 customers had 
signed up for the service in New South Wales, paying a fixed 
rate for electricity use and owning their systems outright 
after seven years. Another programme, PowerResponse, is a 
voluntary demand response initiative that rewards customers 
for reducing their electricity use at peak times. Customers 
who sign up receive notifications to reduce their energy use 
in return for credits or, if they have a home battery system, to 
join a PowerResponse Virtual Power Plant.
EnergyAustralia also provided accredited renewable energy 
to customers under the GreenPower programme supported 
by the Federal Government which allows commercial and 
industrial customers to source renewable energy or install 
solar and battery systems. The InsightsPro data portal gives 
business customers access to consumption data and carbon 
emissions tracking. The ResponsePro programme provides 
financial incentives for businesses to reduce their energy use 
at peak periods.
Apraava Energy is among the companies taking the lead 
in India’s nascent automated metering infrastructure 
sector by building smart meter networks that are key to 
the development of more efficient electricity services for 
households and businesses. Apraava Energy is supplying 
more than three million smart meters under two contracts 
won in the states of Assam and Gujarat in 2023. The meters 
allow power companies to develop more personalised 
services for electricity customers and improve energy 
efficiency.
Developing Energy-as-a-Service business 
models
Energy-as-a-Service business models have become 
increasingly popular in recent years amid a rising trend for 
renewable energy and decentralised power generation. 
CLPe has widened its range of offerings in Hong Kong and 
Mainland China, generating new revenue streams while 
providing customers with cost-effective solutions that have 
no upfront installation costs.
Buildings account for 90% of energy consumption in Hong 
Kong and offer huge scope for energy saving. CLPe is 
installing Hong Kong’s first chiller system to use zero-carbon 
electricity at Chinachem Group’s Nina Tower hotel and office 
complex – the tallest building in Hong Kong’s New Territories 
– which will be completed in phases between 2024 and 2027. 
It has also teamed up with Chinachem and Henderson Land 
in a 15-year agreement to upgrade and operate a shopping 
mall’s cooling system. CLPe will provide funding along with 
design and engineering work for the new air-cooled chiller 
system which is expected to reduce power consumption 15%, 
or around 500,000 kWh of electricity a year, equivalent to the 
annual electricity consumption of around 160 three-member 
households and a reduction of around 200 tonnes of carbon 
emissions.
CLPe and its partner China Mobile won a tender by MTR 
Corporation in December to enhance the rail operator’s 
communication systems infrastructure across its network in 
Hong Kong. CLPe is responsible for engineering, procurement 
and construction for the project, using China Mobile’s 5G 
technology. CLPe also signed a cooperation framework 
agreement with a branch of the Zhongshan Municipal

Hong Kong is home to many regional offices and headquarters and is ideally positioned to serve as a data centre hub 
for the region. The city offers excellent network connectivity, a dependable electricity supply with reasonable tariffs, 
a comprehensive data protection ordinance and proximity to Mainland China.
Data centres are the backbone of today’s digital economy, but the industry is also an intensive user of land, water 
and energy. As Hong Kong’s biggest electricity provider, CLP Power is committed to helping data centre operators 
become more efficient in their energy use while ensuring they have the highly reliable electricity supply they need.
CLP Power works closely with data centre operators and offers a diverse range of services to help reduce their 
carbon footprint. Through our Community Energy Saving Fund, we provide funding for universities to conduct 
energy analysis for high energy consumption businesses such as data centres to improve energy efficiency. 
The air flow optimisation energy analysis at Equinix’s data centre facility is a prime example. By monitoring the 
temperature in data halls and adjusting the air circulation to prevent excessive power use in data centre cooling,  
it achieved energy savings of around 30%. The collaboration allows us to validate and endorse some energy saving 
best practices for the data centre industry. Other services include free energy audits which allow data centre 
operators to conduct a health check of their energy consumption and identify areas where they can optimise energy 
use. Our customers can also participate in trials of our new energy-saving products and obtain subsidies to install 
more energy-efficient lighting and air conditioning.
CLP Power is continuing to invest in electricity infrastructure to support Hong Kong’s growth and decarbonisation. 
We are committed to maintaining our world-class power supply reliability and customer 
service excellence to meet the evolving energy needs of data centres and provide  
the digital infrastructure that is critical for Hong Kong’s transformation  
into a smart city.
How can CLP help data centre operators like us become more 
efficient and sustainable energy users? As more and more data 
centres are set up in Hong Kong, how can CLP ensure we have a 
reliable power supply to support our 24/7 operations?

In Hong Kong, electrifying transport networks is a vital part 
of decarbonisation as vehicles are currently responsible for 
around one-fifth of emissions. CLP Power works closely 
with the Government and the private sector to expand Hong 
Kong’s EV charging infrastructure. It is also supporting trials 
of electric buses, public light buses, taxis and ferries as 
Hong Kong moves towards a future of rising demand for EV 
charging solutions.

corporations, Hong Kong has become an increasingly popular 
location for data centres, which require a highly reliable 
electricity supply. Based on CLP Power’s projection, it aims 
to provide the power supplies and connections for up to 18 
large-scale data centres in the 2024-2028 period covered 
by the current Development Plan, compared with four in the 
previous five-year period.
By working closely with the Government in Hong Kong, CLP 
can play a major role in shaping the city’s low-carbon energy 
future and drive innovative policies for the electrification, 
digitalisation and decarbonisation of the economy. Most 
importantly, having a strong business in its core market gives 
CLP the experience and resources to explore exciting growth 
opportunities in markets around the world.
Please see CEO’s Strategic Review on page 16 
and Business Resilience on page 72 for further 
discussions on the Scheme of Control Agreement 
and the 2024 – 2028 Development Plan.
Creating new revenue streams as other 
sectors electrify
Climate change has made the need to reduce greenhouse 
gas emissions urgent, and CLP has accelerated its efforts to 
help businesses reach their decarbonisation targets. Carbon-
free electricity has the potential to significantly cut carbon 
emissions from sectors such as transport and manufacturing.
CLPe expanded its presence in Mainland China’s EV sector 
through a joint venture with TELD, the nation’s largest 
operator of EV charging services with operations in more 
than 300 cities and a subsidiary of smart power equipment 
manufacturer Qingdao TGOOD Electric Company Limited. 
The joint venture operates 181 charging stations in the south 
of the country with more than 5,500 chargers in Dongguan, 
Shenzhen and Zhuhai.
EnergyAustralia has also been increasing the scope of 
its services to cater to rising demand for EV charging 
infrastructure. In December, it joined Australia’s national 
body for the electric vehicle industry, the Electric Vehicle 
Council, which aims to drive investment and accelerate 
growth in the sector. It earlier signed an agreement with 
North Queensland’s largest tours and charter bus operator 
Tropic Wings to provide the electrification infrastructure 
for its multi-depot electric bus charging network. 
EnergyAustralia will oversee the project, due to be completed 
by mid-2024, and provide ongoing maintenance and repair 
services.
In 2023, CLP Power joined hands with 14 businesses and 
organisations including electric commercial vehicle (ECV) 
manufacturers and operators, charging service providers 
and a bank offering green finance services to form the 
eMobility Network which promotes the wider use of ECVs. 
To support the Hong Kong Government’s EV-charging at 
Home Subsidy Scheme, CLP Power continued to promote 
its Eco Charge 2.0 service which offers one-stop technical 
support and customer service to people seeking funding 
for EV charging infrastructure in the car parks of private 
residential blocks. By the end of 2023, CLP Power had 
completed preliminary assessments for around 92% of 
577 applications for Government funding, covering around 
136,000 car parking bays.
The Regalia in Kowloon was the first CLP Power customer 
to complete the installation of EV charging infrastructure 
under the scheme in early 2023 with 300 EV-enabled parking 
spaces. Since then, several private residential estates have 
also successfully completed similar installations to meet 
growing EV charging needs. In addition, CLP Power also 
continues to provide free EV charging throughout its supply 
area with around 160 chargers.
Deepening CLP’s value proposition with 
partners
CLP’s relationships with governments and regulators are 
pivotal in an industry that is capital intensive and requires 
a long investment span. It acts as a trusted partner in every 
market in which it operates by shaping practices and services 
that contribute to sound energy policies and laws that 
balance social, economic and environmental needs.
In Hong Kong, CLP Power’s operations are regulated by the 
Government under the Scheme of Control (SoC) Agreement 
which since 1964 has provided stability to allow CLP Power 
to invest and respond to the changing needs of Hong Kong. 
The Agreement is renewed periodically to ensure it remains 
suited to an evolving operating environment. In the current 
SoC Agreement for 2018 to 2033, for instance, a range of 
initiatives were introduced to promote renewable energy, 
including the FiT and REC programmes.
CLP Power presents a Development Plan to the Government 
every five years for the regulator to review CLP Power’s 
investments. The current Development Plan projects capital 
expenditure of approximately HK$52.9 billion to 2028 for 
a range of initiatives to support the Government’s policy 
objectives and the city’s accelerating economic development, 
spurred by infrastructure projects and new industries such 
as data centres. As a major financial and international trading 
and logistics hub and home to many regional offices of global

Energy companies have a responsibility to not only serve customers well but to advance decarbonisation, and CLP has a duty 
to provide customers with reliable and reasonably priced electricity while reducing emissions. These twin obligations are 
especially acute at times of volatile oil prices and geopolitical tension when energy companies must balance growing demand 
with affordability. An unstable world can make business unusually challenging by triggering trade restrictions and supply chain 
disruption in the short to medium-term and pushing up costs for energy companies.
CLP has been able to withstand the impact of fluctuating fuel prices to a large extent thanks to its stringent cost control 
measures. While geopolitical uncertainties remain, the organisational agility of CLP gives it a competitive edge and the ability 
to manage those risks effectively while taking full advantage of the commercial opportunities presented by a rapidly changing 
business environment.
Providing customers with reliable and 
reasonably priced energy
The prices of coal, oil and natural gas fell back from their 
2022 peaks but remained high in 2023 compared with levels 
two years earlier, as CLP continued to focus on ways to 
reduce electricity cost pressures facing its customers in an 
inflationary environment. Energy is an essential commodity 
that should be accessible and reasonably priced for everyone, 
and CLP made it a priority to support its customers.
In Hong Kong, CLP Power is committed to supplying 
electricity to customers with a service that is efficient, 
reliable, environmentally sound and provided at reasonable 
cost under the terms of the SoC Agreement with the 
Government. The company mitigated the impact of fuel 
cost volatility and eased the tariff pressure on customers 
in 2023 through a series of measures, including enhancing 
the efficiency of generation and making the most of existing 
gas reserves. The launch of the offshore LNG terminal made 
available a critical new source of natural gas for CLP and joint 
developer The Hongkong Electric Co., Ltd, giving Hong Kong 
access to competitively priced, reliable LNG from diverse 
sources in the global market and enhancing the territory’s gas 
supply security.
Meanwhile, the import of nuclear power – which has 
remained relatively stable in price – played a major role 
in smoothing out price fluctuations. The strategy of using 
a diversified fuel mix and importing energy from highly 
reliable zero-emission sources contributed to a 7.4% 
reduction in the Average Net Tariff for 2024. This included 
a slight 2.9% upward adjustment in the Average Basic 
Tariff, which had previously been maintained at the same 
level for three consecutive years. CLP Power continued 
with stringent cost controls to ensure its tariffs remained 
competitive – the 6% increase in Average Basic Tariff 
between 2005 and 2023 was well below the 60% jump in 
Hong Kong’s Consumer Price Index over the same period.
Underprivileged families have been hardest hit by the global 
cost of living crisis, and CLP Power allocated more than 
HK$200 million from its Community Energy Saving Fund 
for a series of community support programmes to promote 
renewable energy, boost the Hong Kong economy and 
encourage customers to save energy.
EnergyAustralia is equally committed to supporting its 
customers through turbulent times, especially vulnerable 
households facing cost of living pressures. It offers payment 
plans and extensions to customers facing short-term 
financial difficulties and provides information on the

CLP has been part of the Hong Kong community for more than 120 years and we care deeply for underprivileged 
people. While we have great confidence in the future as Hong Kong recovers from the impact of the pandemic, we 
are acutely aware that many grassroots households face challenges because of the housing shortage and the high 
cost of living. That is why support for people in need has always been at the heart of our community initiatives. In 
2024, we have again set aside HK$200 million from the CLP Community Energy Saving Fund (CESF) for a range of 
support programmes.
While the Average Net Tariff for 2024 has been reduced by 7.4%, to further ease the burden on underprivileged 
households, the CESF will provide electricity subsidies of HK$600 to each of 50,000 elderly people, low-income 
families and people with disabilities, while 20,000 tenants of subdivided units will each receive subsidies of 
HK$1,000. The new Home Electrical Safety Enhancement for the Underprivileged Programme will see us 
collaborating with community partners to arrange qualified electricians to inspect and repair the electrical 
installations of around 2,000 underprivileged families for free to improve their home safety. CLP will also 
continue to carry out rewiring works for the installation of individual electricity meters in subdivided units. 
A new programme funded by the CESF will meanwhile provide subsidies for equipping energy-efficient electrical 
appliances and education resources relating to energy saving and conservation for Community Living Rooms –  
a Government initiative to create additional living space for tenants of subdivided units.
In the next few years, the construction of public housing in Hong Kong 
will continue to be "back-loaded" as it takes time to deliver the supply 
to meet the society’s need. The situation with subdivided units is also 
unlikely to be resolved in the short term. In this environment, how can 
CLP help improve the quality of life for grassroots citizens and mitigate 
the impact of the housing constraints?
Mr Ricky Yu
Founder & CEO, 
Light Be
In addition, the CESF will provide HK$2,000 subsidies to each of 2,000 families living in transitional housing, 
including projects run by Light Be, for them to buy energy-efficient electrical appliances to improve their energy 
efficiency. As well as the CESF, CLP operates a popular Hotmeal Canteen service that serves 
up nutritious meals to people from low-income households.
Throughout the years, we have worked hand in hand with our partners to create a more 
compassionate and harmonious society. We look forward to continuing our support for 
underprivileged people as we fulfil our ambition to Power Brighter 
Tomorrows.

Navigating geopolitical instability
Energy markets worldwide have been on a roller coaster ride 
in recent years with the aftermath of the pandemic and war 
in Ukraine leading to wildly fluctuating oil, gas and coal prices. 
The turbulence has reverberated across every continent, 
and CLP has relied on its diversified procurement strategy to 
avoid the worst of the impact.
A continuous supply of fuel is critical for CLP to sustain a 
reliable electricity supply to its customers and off-takers, and 
fuel is the largest single component of the Group’s operating 
expenditure. Security of supply, competitive pricing and 
environmental performance are therefore key elements in 
CLP’s fuel procurement strategy. The company maintains 
supply security by adopting a diversified fuel mix, optimising 
its procurement contracting processes, balancing the use 
of term and spot contracts and maintaining multiple fuel 
sources so as not to be reliant on a single source or supplier.
In Hong Kong, CLP Power has been increasing its use of 
natural gas in support of the Government’s decarbonisation 
targets as coal-fired generation is phased out, raising the 
proportion of gas-fired energy generation to around 50% 
since 2020. A diversity of sources of natural gas ensures 
security of supply. CLP Power began importing natural gas 
from the Yacheng gas field off Hainan Island in the South 
China Sea in 1996, but reserves ran low. In 2013, it started 
drawing supplies through an undersea pipeline connecting 
the West-East-Pipeline Phase II (WEPII) at Dachan Island in 
Shenzhen to Black Point Power Station. It started sourcing 
natural gas from new gas fields in the South China Sea using 
the existing Yacheng pipeline in 2018.
The dwindling reserves in the Yacheng gas field and a 
temporary suspension of supplies from the WEPII in December 
2015 highlighted the importance of diverse gas sources 
for CLP Power and Hong Kong as a whole. It also served to 
emphasise the need for the new LNG terminal, which has 
received regular shipments of LNG under a long-term supply 
contract since it began operations in July 2023.
EnergyAustralia, meanwhile, reduces its exposure to market 
uncertainties by entering into forward energy contracts for 
hedging purposes. These contracts fix the wholesale price 
EnergyAustralia pays for electricity over a period of time 
regardless of the highs and lows of the spot market, allowing 
it to have more certainty over wholesale energy costs.
The amount of coal used by CLP is decreasing but it continues 
to evaluate its procurement strategy and explore new 
sources to maintain diversity of supply while improving 
environmental performance. CLP Power, for instance, buys 
coal from countries around the world including Australia, the 
US and Indonesia to avoid overreliance on a single supplier or 
country and continues to identify new sources.

Energy Security and Reliability


 Case Study
Enabling a secure energy transition
The New South Wales Government has committed to reducing greenhouse gas emissions by 70% by 2035 and reach net 
zero by 2050. The most highly populated state in Australia is fast-tracking the development of renewable energy, and 
flexible electricity capacity is key to a secure energy transition.
When EnergyAustralia begins operation of Tallawarra B power station, the new fast-start gas-fired plant will play  
an important role in providing flexible capacity and support the continued growth of intermittent renewable energy in 
New South Wales.
Tallawarra B will deliver around 320MW of dispatchable capacity, enough to power around 180,000 homes and small 
businesses during peak demand periods, supporting a reliable power supply to the market at times when a lack of 
natural resources curtail wind and solar energy generation.
It will be an Australian first, being a net zero emissions gas-fired power station, with 100% of all direct carbon emissions 
offset over its operational life.
The use of the latest turbine technology makes Tallawarra B one of Australia’s most efficient gas-fired generators, and 
its climate performance is poised to improve further still. EnergyAustralia aims to install technology to blend gas with 
up to 5% hydrogen in Tallawarra B’s fuel mix by 2025, if hydrogen supplies are adequate.
In late 2023, EnergyAustralia achieved a successful first fire of Tallawarra B, a key milestone before the plant’s final 
commissioning. The project overcame a series of challenges after starting construction during pandemic-enforced 
lockdowns in 2021, with progress also disrupted by the financial difficulties of principal project contractor  
Clough Limited, which went into administration in 2022.
CLP also sources goods and services from a diverse range 
of industries globally to support its operations and has 
been affected by supply chain disruption triggered by the 
pandemic, global financial turmoil and escalating geopolitical 
conflict. The flow of international goods and services has 
also been impacted by labour shortages, depleted inventory 
levels, material sourcing challenges due to tightened trade 
regulations, shipping delays and rising logistics costs.
CLP Power has overcome these multi-faceted challenges 
to remain on track to replace traditional meters with smart 
meters for all customers by 2025. More than 2.23 million 
smart meters have now been connected for about 80% of 
customers after the company dealt with logistic challenges 
posed by the pandemic, including global chip shortages 
and shipment delays. CLP Power succeeded by taking a 
three-pronged approach that reflects the Group’s vigilance 
on issues regarding supply chain resilience: Maintaining a 
sufficient inventory level, having access to multiple supply 
sources and forging close collaboration with suppliers.
Smart meters provide CLP Power customers access to  
power consumption data, allowing them to easily manage 
energy use and offering them the opportunity to take part 
in energy-saving events. In 2023, 950,000 CLP Power 
customers with smart meters were invited to save energy 
by participating in demand management programmes. By 
making minor adjustments to their consumption behaviour, the 
 
participating customers saved 410,000 kilowatt hours (kWh) 
of electricity – equivalent to a reduction of 160 tonnes of 
carbon emissions. On the evening of 26 July, one of the 
hottest days of 2023 when CLP Power reported electricity 
demand of 7,452MW, demand management programmes 
for residential and business customers helped trim peak 
demand which would otherwise have been 187MW higher. 
This helped strengthen power supply reliability by reducing 
strains on system capacity, lessening the need for additional 
investments in generation capacity.

and Business Resilience on page 72 for further 
information on CLP’s efforts to maintain supply 
reliability.

Energy companies need workforces that are diverse, inclusive and skilled for the future to lead the low-carbon transition while 
meeting rising global demand for electricity. Competition for talented people is intense, and failure to attract and develop people 
with the skills and capabilities needed in fast-evolving global energy markets, and to provide welcoming, inclusive workforces for 
them, represent risks to every energy company’s long-term prospects. It is also a priority for energy companies to ensure that 
projects are built and operated safely, that workplace hazards and risks for people are reduced, and that health and wellbeing 
risks are addressed.
Lack of organisational agility poses risks to competitiveness, as new ways of working embracing collaboration, commerciality 
and creativity are key to technological and service innovation. Lastly, energy companies must ensure that everyone is supported 
to succeed and thrive during the many changes brought by energy transition in order to meet workforce and community 
expectations. Managing these risks is essential to building a future-ready workforce to drive sustainable growth.
Together with a continued focus on reducing the risks from 
working at height and falling objects, and a flexibility to adapt 
the strategy to the specific risk profiles of CLP’s businesses in 
the region, the safety enhancement measures contributed to 
a decline in the Group’s total recordable injury rate (TRIR) and 
lost time injury rate (LTIR) for employees and contractors, led 
by significant improvements in Hong Kong and Australia.
CLP received recognition for its efforts to support employee 
wellbeing during and post-pandemic. CLP Power won the 
Gold Award for Best Corporate Wellbeing at the annual Best 
HR Awards organised by recruitment portal CTgoodjobs, 
and was a Gold award winner in the Mental Health Friendly 
Supreme Organisation category in the Occupational Health 
Award organised by Occupational Safety and Health 
Council. CLP China was a winner at the Wellness Employer 
Award organised by the bodies including the China Human 
Resources Management Research Association.
Promoting workplace safety and wellbeing
CLP is committed to the safety of its employees and 
contractors. The Group further strengthened workplace 
safety in 2023 based on its multi-year health, safety and 
environment (HSE) improvement strategy, a comprehensive 
blueprint that emphasises the importance of a proactive 
approach to make work processes safer.
Reflecting a contemporary approach to safety management, 
the HSE improvement strategy promotes organisational 
learning to enhance safety, based on human and 
organisational performance principles. A series of workshops 
and communication programmes were arranged for 
employees to increase their understanding of the principles, 
which aim to harness the knowledge and experience of 
the workforce to develop safer working practices. The CLP 
approach centres around how work is performed in  
day-to-day operation, moves beyond simply looking at 
human error as a cause, enabling a better understanding of 
the more complex latent conditions in the work environment. 
Additionally, the use of an internal taxonomy helped CLP 
organise safety information and knowledge more effectively, 
providing the Group with greater insight to guide employees 
to focus their learning on safety.

1	 The LTIR and the TRIR are the number of lost time injuries and 
recordable injuries respectively measured over 200,000 working 
hours, which is equivalent to around 100 persons working for one 
year.
2	 According to Global Reporting Initiative (GRI) reporting criteria, work-
related ill health and commuting injury are not reported under work-
related injury category. Hence, the LTIR and TRIR are for work-related 
injury only starting from 2022. There were 3 work-related recordable 
ill health injuries (employee only) and 2 recordable commuting injuries 
in 2023.
3	 2023 figures excluded Apraava Energy as CLP ceased to have 
operational control over the Indian company which became a 50-50 
joint venture in 2022.
Sadly, a contractor at Apraava Energy’s Sidhpur wind farm in 
the Indian state of Gujarat was killed in an incident involving 
on-site industrial machinery during construction work in May. 
A thorough investigation into the incident was conducted 
and measures were implemented to improve supervision of 
contractors and strengthen worksite management through 
increased site audits and training.
EnergyAustralia was charged by WorkSafe Victoria in 
November for alleged occupational health and safety 
offences in relation to a fire at Yallourn Power Station 
in 2021. The fire at Yallourn Coal Transfer Building was 
extinguished by the correct operation of the plant’s 
automated sprinkler system. No employees or contractors 
were harmed or present, and there was no risk to the 
neighbouring community nor any disruption to power 
generation. EnergyAustralia fully cooperated with WorkSafe 
Victoria’s investigation and proactively made changes to its 
systems for fire management following the incident.
Attracting and developing diverse talent and 
capabilities
The success of CLP depends on the talent and hard work 
of the Group’s employees and contractors as well as other 
team members serving its businesses and joint ventures. 
As well as investing in its people to develop and enhance 
their capabilities, CLP must attract new talent to seize 
opportunities and overcome challenges as the global energy 
market pivots to a low-carbon, digitalised future. The Group 
must also maintain a strong pipeline of engineering talent so 
that its deep reserves of skill and expertise can be passed on 
from one generation of employees to the next.
Strengthening skills and expertise
CLP further strengthened the recruitment of people with 
talent and expertise in engineering, digital technologies and 
customer service in its two core markets. More than 800 
people joined CLP’s businesses in Hong Kong and Mainland 
China, sustaining a rapid pace of recruitment. Recruitment 
was supported through scaling up internal talent acquisition 
capabilities as well as digitalisation of the candidate 
experience and building stronger connections to talent 
sources in Mainland China.
The highest ever intake of over 40 young engineers joined 
the company’s flagship Graduate Trainee programme in Hong 
Kong which provides participants with a thorough grounding 
in core technical, commercial and leadership skills as well as 
opportunities to work across the Group’s business operations 
in Hong Kong and Mainland China. The programme was 
bolstered by recruits from Mainland China and overseas 
universities and is regularly updated to give graduates more

exposure to CLP’s low-carbon and digitalisation projects. In 
Hong Kong, CLP also commenced its first Digital Graduate 
Trainee programme, which focused on digitalisation 
disciplines.
CLP Power cemented its status as a good employer when it 
won the coveted Grand Award in the Employer of the Year 
category of CTgoodjobs’ annual Best HR Awards, and was 
recognised in other awards for its graduate and management 
programmes.
Growing the talent pool
CLP considers that growing the engineering talent pool 
in Hong Kong is equally as important as tapping into new 
sources of talent in Mainland China and overseas. This is 
good for Hong Kong, CLP and young talent, helping to fulfil 
the manpower needs of Hong Kong’s infrastructure project 
pipeline. The CLP Power Academy works with education 
institutions in Hong Kong and overseas to offer a range of 
electrical and mechanical engineering courses for students 
from different educational backgrounds who wish to enter 
the industry or develop their skills while working. More than 
2,100 students have benefitted from the academy since it 
was founded in 2017.
The CLP Power Academy also has a role to play in facilitating 
electrical engineering talent mobility within the Greater 
Bay Area. In 2022, the academy launched a training course 
for Hong Kong engineers to gain high-voltage electrical 
qualifications in Mainland China in a joint initiative with the 
Guangzhou Industry and Trade Technician College and the 
Vocational Training Council. The first cohort graduated in 
mid-2023, and a new course for low-voltage electrical work 
was also launched during the year.
CLP supported other initiatives to promote talent 
development for the energy sector, including scholarships 
and internship programmes for students in Hong Kong 
and Mainland China. It also teamed up with the Women’s 
Foundation for the Girls Go Tech programme, which sponsors 
female students from underprivileged households to study 
science, technology, engineering and mathematics (STEM) 
subjects.
Investing in training and development
CLP is committed to the growth and development of 
its workforce and equips its people with the skills and 
knowledge they need to succeed in a rapidly evolving energy 
market covering topics ranging from power engineering 
and digital technologies to safety and business ethics. 
Training programmes at CLP focus on technical, business 
and leadership skills, digitalisation and Design Thinking 
methodology. Employees are encouraged to explore their 
personal and career development and receive coaching to 
help them realise their potential.
Employees received an average of 44.1 hours of internal 
and external training and development in 2023 in line with 
2022. This excludes on-the-job coaching and mentoring, 
departmental team development activities and career 
advisory sessions.

Embedding agile and innovative ways of 
working
Utility companies must rapidly develop more agile and more 
flexible organisation structures and new ways of working 
to compete and capture business opportunities at a time 
when decarbonisation and digitalisation are transforming the 
energy market.
In Hong Kong and Mainland China, CLP implemented a new 
operating model to enable its business units to respond more 
quickly to customers and growth opportunities and simplify 
their operations by reducing interfaces. The new model 
ensures that the areas of the business closest to customers 
will have accountability for end-to-end delivery, operational 
and financial performance, supported by Group Functions in 
CLP Holdings.
To set clear expectations of the qualities and skills required 
for managers at CLP, the Group has a well-established 
system of leadership competencies. These were updated 
in 2023 to reflect the capabilities and behaviours required 
to succeed in the evolving business environment including 
change management, decision-making under uncertainty and 
partnering and innovating for value. Updated competencies 
are being integrated into the Group’s employee training 
and development programmes, as well as performance 
management.
CLP continued to promote digitalised ways of working 
to deliver improved experiences and efficiencies for the 
workforce, and simplify business processes such as finance 
and human resources management to make them more 
streamlined and generate greater productivity. CLP is also 
migrating to new office designs that aim to support improved 
cooperation and interaction between employees.
CLP continued to invest in training to promote organisational 
agility. Almost 4,200 Hong Kong employees have been 
trained in Design Thinking since it was launched in 2019. 
Design Thinking aims to nurture an innovation culture and 
helps employees develop problem-solving capabilities and 
innovative mindsets.
CLP also launched online self-learning courses on robotic 
process automation (RPA) to show employees how the 
methodology can improve daily work processes. RPA 
aims to promote a digital mindset across the organisation, 
drive productivity gain, enhance customer experience 
and workforce satisfaction. Over 100 process automation 
projects are underway to help streamline work processes and 
minimise repetitive work.

CLP Holdings 2023 Annual Report


Maintaining resilience is a complex challenge for energy companies globally amid environmental, technological, regulatory 
and social changes and developments. Each of these changes alone is significant but combined they have led to a sharp rise in 
sustainability-related risks and opportunities. Climate change, for example, threatens energy infrastructure and operations, 
while in the short-term, extreme weather impacts renewable energy assets, in particular hydro power plants. Rising global 
temperatures meanwhile trigger changes in regulations as governments bring in stricter policies to achieve their climate 
targets, potentially creating medium- to long-term risk for the energy industry. By contrast, the rapid development of digital 
technologies such as artificial intelligence (AI) and data analytics tools offers new opportunities for utility companies to 
improve their operations and customer service. At the same time, every business must remain vigilant against the threat of 
cyberattacks in an increasingly digitalised world. Balancing these conflicting risks and opportunities calls for vision, strategy 
and commitment from energy companies to ensure effective and sustained business resilience.
Building resilience in the face of climate 
change and an evolving business environment
CLP invests in energy markets across Asia Pacific with 
vastly different regulatory requirements, and the Group’s 
overall resilience depends on its ability to anticipate and 
respond to regional economic and energy policies and market 
fluctuations. In every market, the Group works closely with 
policymakers to support their objectives through business 
activities designed to meet local circumstances. Ongoing 
engagement with stakeholders is key to building increased 
understanding of CLP’s businesses and the necessary 
regulatory framework conducive to a healthy energy 
industry.
In Hong Kong, CLP Power is regulated by the SoC Agreement 
with the Government. The SoC framework allows it to plan 
and invest cost-effectively in line with Hong Kong’s  
long-term development needs while meeting the 
Government’s policy objectives. The arrangement has 
provided an effective mechanism for CLP Power for 60 years 
to deliver a world-class electricity supply at a reasonable cost 
that powers Hong Kong’s economic growth and minimises 
environmental impact.
The SoC Agreement evolves in line with changing regulatory 
framework and community aspirations through an interim 
review conducted every five years. An interim review  
took place in 2023 for the current 15-year SoC Agreement 
ending in December 2033. CLP Power has agreed with the 
Government a new incentive and penalty mechanism for 
large-scale supply interruptions, special tariff relief in the 
event of future fuel crises and improvements to information 
transparency.
Governments worldwide are introducing new regulations 
and targets to promote the use of non-carbon energy. The 
Hong Kong Government is committed to achieving carbon 
neutrality before 2050. To support this, power companies 
will cease using coal for daily electricity generation by 2035 
and increase the ratio of renewable energy in the fuel mix 
to between 7.5% and 10% by that year, and subsequently to 
15%.
Hong Kong is densely populated and has limited potential for 
local renewable energy development. Regional cooperation is 
therefore crucial to achieve the Government’s climate change 
targets. CLP is strengthening partnerships with electricity 
companies around the region while pressing ahead with

existing initiatives, including enhancing the CETS to allow for 
more imports of zero-carbon energy from Mainland China. 
CLP, China Southern Power Grid, Companhia de Electricidade 
de Macau, and China General Nuclear Power Group meanwhile 
 
pledged to work more closely together on power supply, 
sustainable energy and energy storage systems in the 
Greater Bay Area (GBA) in an agreement reached at the 11th 
Guangdong, Hong Kong and Macau Power Industry Summit  
in Hong Kong in May. The agreement supports the  
Chinese Government’s dual goals of peaking carbon emissions 
by 2030 and achieving carbon neutrality by 2060.
In Mainland China, the Government is accelerating reforms 
of the energy sector aimed at developing a unified national 
electricity market by harmonising technical standards and 
trading rules. CLP works closely with local authorities to 
navigate these dynamic market reforms.
In Australia, climate-related policies are fast changing, driven 
by policymakers at the federal and state levels as well as a 
vast array of government agencies. EnergyAustralia engages 
in regular dialogues with policymakers and regulators to 
support the development of a smart, clean energy system 
in the country. In particular, EnergyAustralia is focused 
on opportunities in flexible capacity as the phasing out of 
coal-fired power stations continues and more rooftop solar 
systems are connected. Two new battery energy storage 
systems in New South Wales went into service in October 
to provide EnergyAustralia with 90MW/180MWh of firming 
capacity under an offtake agreement. The new 320MW  
Tallawarra B power station will help maintain power supply 
reliability. EnergyAustralia also made progress on other 
proposed energy storage projects, including the Wooreen 
battery system in Victoria and a pumped hydro project in 
Lake Lyell in New South Wales.
Please see Transition to Net Zero on page 49 for 
further information on CLP’s strategies to provide 
low-carbon energy.
With the development of sustainable energy solutions such 
as distributed energy systems and BESS, CLP needs to 
manage increased grid complexities and respond to changing 
customer needs. To stay on top of evolving market dynamics, 
CLP is accelerating the development of new energy services 
and business models to diversify from a traditional energy 
utility and reposition for success. For example, as customers 
need new ways to decarbonise their operations and become 
more sustainable, CLPe is providing solar energy and smart 
energy solutions, including energy-efficient cooling systems 
powered by AI, to a growing number of businesses and 
organisations in Hong Kong and other cities of the GBA.
Solar energy customers for CLPe include the Drainage 
Services Department (DSD) in Hong Kong. CLPe completed 
the installation of a floating solar photovoltaic system at 
DSD’s flood prevention project in Tin Shui Wai in the New 
Territories, with grid connection completed in September. 
Across the border, CLPe and the Cuiheng Group agreed to 
cooperate on the development of cooling systems in a new 
district in the southern city of Zhongshan. CLPe will also work 
with the Cuiheng Group on distributed solar energy and EV 
charging infrastructure.
To serve growing customer needs for sustainable energy 
solutions in the GBA, CLPe set up a new office in Shenzhen’s 
Longhua district. This followed a memorandum of 
understanding (MoU) on energy digitalisation signed with the 
Longhua Government in 2022. Meanwhile, CLPe expanded its 
collaboration with MTR Shenzhen with the installation of a 
distributed solar energy system at the rail operator’s carriage 
depot in Longhua, a year after providing a solar system for 
the company’s headquarters in the district.
Please see Energy Growth Opportunities on page 57  
for further information on CLP’s new energy 
services and business models.
Mitigating extreme weather risks
CLP is an essential service provider and recognises the 
importance of making sure its infrastructure and operations 
are resilient to extreme weather events caused by climate 
change. Despite the growing occurrence of extreme weather 
events, CLP Power achieved an overall reliability rate 
of 99.999% in 2023. The Group continues to strengthen 
planning and mitigation measures to cope with the 
heightened risks. New technologies offer ways for CLP to 
better manage power grids and strengthen the resilience of 
its infrastructure.
A comprehensive assessment of the threat of extreme 
weather events to generation, transmission and distribution 
infrastructure in Hong Kong was conducted using weather 
data and climate models from the Hong Kong Observatory, 
the International Panel on Climate Change, World Resources 
Institute and other international groups. The assessment 
allowed CLP to determine the measures needed to deal with 
the impact of super typhoons, storm surges, wildfires and 
other extreme weather events on key energy infrastructure.
CLP’s 2024-2028 Development Plan includes funding for 
projects to strengthen 400kV transmission lines and other 
network assets against extreme weather events.

 Case Study
Standing strong through superstorms
Hong Kong was hit by Super Typhoon Saola and the heaviest rainstorm on record during a single week in September. 
CLP Power rose to the challenge and maintained a reliable power supply with minimal service interruptions as 
advanced monitoring and diagnostic systems and effective preventive measures helped ensure the integrity of its 
power supply system.
Super Typhoon Saola led to the suspension of most offices and schools across the city. CLP Power’s operations 
remained largely unaffected, though about 18,000 customers suffered service interruptions as strong winds and 
fallen trees damaged some overhead cables and power supply equipment. Power was swiftly restored for affected 
customers.
When the rainstorm struck days later, CLP Power’s electricity supply remained stable as flash floods and landslides affected 
many parts of the city. Power was restored within hours to around 1,000 customers who suffered interruptions.
In recent years, CLP Power has reinforced transmission towers and installed anti-flooding equipment at substations. 
Vegetation near overhead transmission lines is closely monitored and managed and CLP Power uses new technology for 
the detection and isolation of faulty sections of the network.
CLP Power conducts regular emergency drills and is investing in rapid construction technology to erect temporary masts 
and shorten the lengths of power interruptions during emergency repairs. The continuing rollout of smart meters for 
customers, especially in more remote areas, also increases CLP Power’s ability to monitor supply interruptions. Flood 
gates and alarm systems are also being installed at substations to reduce the risk of disruption to the power supply.
Hong Kong is a non-stop city that relies heavily on electricity to keep its economy vibrant, making power supply reliability 
critically important.


CLP China took steps to reinforce the operational resilience of 
its renewable energy assets as well as that of new wind and 
solar farms under development.
The Bobai wind farm in Guangxi, currently under 
construction, will have a wind turbine tower capable of 
withstanding once-in-50 year strong wind speeds. Flood-
resistant solar panels are meanwhile being installed at the 
new Yangzhou Gongdao Solar Farm. Solar panels at Jinchang 
Solar Power Station and other sites are being strengthened 
to protect them against strong winds.
Robust early warning systems were installed at Huaiji Hydro 
Power Stations in Guangdong province to guard against 
flooding while ensuring safe operations during extreme 
weather. The plant was also modified to ensure it operates 
reliably in the event of a blackout. CLP China liaised with 
the local Government and neighbouring communities and 
conducted training and drills to raise awareness about the 
risks from flooding.
Volatile weather patterns caused by climate change have 
disrupted energy supplies worldwide in recent years. 
Drought conditions in Yunnan province in southwest China 
led to a reduction in output from Dali Yang_er Hydropower 
Station. Tariffs for electricity dispatched were also below 
expectations, resulting in a HK$115 million impairment 
charge for the plant in 2023.
Reinforcing cyber resilience and data 
protection
Big data and advances in AI and machine learning 
technologies have transformed the way the world does 
business and offers powerful tools for energy companies 
to improve their operations and customer service. CLP 
continued to upgrade its data analytics capabilities as part of 
the Group’s ongoing digitalisation efforts.
CLP Power developed a new data analytics tool to enhance 
the detection of faulty smart meters in customers’ homes 
and businesses, leading to reduced time and manual effort 
in managing its metering network. The new software can 
also monitor customers affected by outages during extreme 
weather events and allow for faster supply restoration.
CLP Power is exploring the use of data analytics to optimise 
management of electricity assets, fuel purchases and  
short-term load forecasting, and the use of AI-powered 
chatbots to support customer services and employee training.
CLP China and Apraava Energy in India continued to benefit 
from the use of the Group’s advanced analytics platform 
to monitor the operations of renewable energy assets. The 
system incorporates big data and AI technologies to monitor 
the performance of wind and solar farms in real time.
Keeping cybercrime at bay
Cybersecurity threats have become greater and more 
complex as energy markets are reshaped by new digital 
technologies.
CLP set up new governance systems in 2023 to establish the 
roles and responsibilities for cybersecurity of all business 
departments across the Group, based on guidelines from the 
National Institute of Standards and Technology in the  
US.
A new security operations centre was established in Hong 
Kong to step up monitoring of cybersecurity risks and 
strengthen response to incidents. The Group continued 
to deploy new technologies to counter online threats and 
provided training to employees to increase their awareness 
of cybercrime.

Achieved
100% recycling 
of major operational recyclable  
waste products
Businesses only succeed and prosper in the long term if they build strong and sustainable relationships with the communities 
around them and safeguard the environment in which they operate. Companies that neglect their duties of stewardship and 
fail to control pollution risk financial penalties and public health concerns.
Reducing environmental impact
Environmental responsibility is a cornerstone of CLP’s work to create a sustainable energy business. In addition to CLP’s 
commitment to net-zero greenhouse gas emissions by 2050, CLP has been strengthening its efforts to cut air pollution and 
improve water and waste management through a comprehensive environmental strategy that encompasses every aspect of its 
operations.
The Group set ambitious new targets in 2023 for reductions in air emissions, water use and waste generation. The updated 
targets for 2025 and 2030 were calibrated to reflect the decline of coal-fired power in CLP’s asset portfolio, and affirm the 
Group’s commitment to ongoing improvement in environmental performance.
Air emissions management
CLP uses a combination of a managed fuel mix and advanced technologies to limit air emissions. The Group cut emissions of 
nitrogen oxides (NOx), sulphur dioxide (SO2) and particulate matter (PM) in 2023 by 26%, 17% and 1% respectively compared 
with the previous year. The divestment of a majority stake in Fangchenggang Power Station in Mainland China contributed to 
the reductions, while emissions from India’s Jhajjar Power Station were excluded as Apraava Energy is no longer a subsidiary.
Targets for 2025 and 2030 were set to guide further improvements in the Group’s performance on reducing air emissions. The 
table below is a summary of the Group’s targets and air emissions performance.

NOx emissions will be further reduced at Black Point Power Station in Hong Kong when the new D2 gas-fired generation unit 
goes into service, thanks to its use of selective catalytic reduction technology. The same system has effectively controlled NOx 
emissions at the adjacent D1 unit since its introduction in 2020.
EnergyAustralia will use a plume dispersion device to manage exhaust gases from the new Tallawarra B power station in  
New South Wales when it enters service. The device helps cool exhaust gases from the gas turbine to slow the column of hot 
air rising from the power station, eliminating any safety threat to flights in and out of nearby Shellharbour Airport.
Two short-term carbon monoxide (CO) licence limit exceedances were recorded at EnergyAustralia’s power plants in Victoria 
in 2023. The first exceedance occurred during an emissions test at Jeeralang Power Station. The other occurred during a 
recommissioning run after an outage at Newport Power Station. Both incidents were reported to the local authorities and no 
further regulatory action was taken.
Yallourn Power Station recorded a minor environmental licence breach related to coal dust control. EnergyAustralia reported 
the case to the Environment Protection Authority in Victoria and updated its internal risk management and monitoring system. 
The authority deemed the response from EnergyAustralia appropriate and the case has been closed.
Water management
CLP strives to reduce the amount of freshwater used for its operations, and manage the impact of new energy projects on 
water systems. Freshwater consumption decreased by 62% compared with the previous year, following the divestment of 
Fangchenggang Power Station in 2022. Since Apraava Energy has ceased to be a subsidiary of CLP, water consumption of the 
operator of the coal-fired Jhajjar Power Station was no longer included. In 2023, the Group set targets for reduction in water 
consumption by 2025 and 2030. The below table is a summary of freshwater consumption performance and targets for 2025 
and 2030.

Compared with baseline level of 2021
Black Point Power Station in Hong Kong completed a project to expand the capacity of its water treatment plant and increase 
its water processing efficiency. CLP Power also installed more rainwater harvest systems at its substations to reduce 
freshwater consumption, including water recycling tanks and automatic drip irrigation systems.
CLP China continued to implement robotic systems in its solar energy plants to reduce freshwater use through the automatic 
cleaning of photovoltaic panels.
EnergyAustralia conducted an investigation into the underlying geology and possible impact on groundwater from its proposed 
Lake Lyell pumped hydro project in New South Wales. The investigation results will be included in an environment impact 
study (EIS) for the project, which would involve a purpose-built upper reservoir to store excess energy.
Most of CLP’s thermal power generation plants use seawater for cooling, including Black Point Power Station and Castle Peak 
Power Station in Hong Kong and Australia’s Tallawarra Power Station and Newport Power Station. Where seawater cooling 
is not feasible, CLP strives to minimise its freshwater use and adopt water recirculation processes. The quantity of water 
withdrawal and discharge depends on electricity generation volumes, and CLP takes steps to ensure the quality of water 
discharge meets regulatory standards.

CLP Holdings 2023 Annual Report


Waste management
Waste products from the Group’s operations decreased 68% compared with 2022, as year-earlier data included waste from 
Fangchenggang Power Station and Jhajjar Power Station, and both plants were no longer accounted for in 2023 due to 
divestments.
CLP is committed to minimising material use and waste disposal, and stepped up recycling efforts in line with circular 
economy principles. Across the Group’s operations, major operational recyclable waste products including scrap metals, scrap 
rechargeable batteries, waste electrical and electronic equipment (WEEE) and inert construction waste were fully recycled in 
2023.
The Group continued to recycle coal ash and gypsum, the main by-products of coal-fired power operations, for use in other 
industries including construction.
In 2023, the Group set waste reduction targets for 2025 and 2030. Key waste management performance and targets are 
summarised in the table below.

 Case Study
Mitigating the environmental impact of energy infrastructure
The Hong Kong Offshore LNG Terminal jointly developed by CLP Power and The Hongkong Electric Company, Limited 
entered service in the summer of 2023 to open a new chapter in the city’s low-carbon energy development. Despite 
the logistical challenges of the pandemic, the project maintained an exemplary environmental record throughout 31 
months of construction.
The project was subjected to extensive environmental assessments and stringent regulatory requirements before 
construction began in the southwest waters of Hong Kong, which are a habitat for marine species including Chinese 
white dolphins and finless porpoises.
Mitigation steps included the use of noise reduction systems and the implementation of marine mammal exclusion 
zone monitoring during piling works for the terminal’s marine jetty. Tests during construction and after the start of 
operations in 2023 found no deterioration in water quality while the marine mammal population has remained stable.
A stakeholders liaison group comprising academics and marine conservation and fisheries experts, along with 
representatives of fishermen’s associations and the community, was set up in September 2020 and meets regularly to 
discuss environmental issues.
CLP Power and Hongkong Electric also set aside HK$100 million to establish two funds to support environmental 
enhancement initiatives for marine ecology and conservation and sustainable development of the fishing industry. 
The Marine Conservation Enhancement Fund supports initiatives for the conservation and enhancement of the marine 
habitat, including initiatives on eco-tourism and education. The Fisheries Enhancement Fund meanwhile pays for 
enhancements to fisheries resources and sustainable fisheries development, as well as fisheries-related education and 
tourism.

A minor environmental breach was recorded at Mount Piper 
Power Station in New South Wales in 2023, after brine-
conditioned coal ash and salts emplaced in the ash depository 
exceeded the maximum authorised height. EnergyAustralia 
has developed mitigation measures to relocate the materials 
and prevent a recurrence. The incident was reported to the 
New South Wales Environment Protection Authority and no 
further action is incurred.
Another breach related to unauthorised vegetation clearing 
activities at Tallawarra Power Station. EnergyAustralia 
swiftly contacted the Environment Protection Authority to 
explain the cause of the incident and no action was taken by 
the authority.

strategies and the Group’s strategy on addressing

CLP Holdings 2023 Annual Report
CLP Holdings 2023 Annual Report

2023 was a busy year for CLP on corporate governance.
From our “2023 At a Glance” section in this Corporate Governance Report, we have highlighted 
some of the key focus of CLP’s corporate governance practices for 2023. These include our 
continuing efforts to gradually refresh our Board and Board Committees; implementing the 
findings from our last External Board Review exercise as well as keeping the market duly 
updated on the significant developments concerning the Group. Our commitment to these 
important initiatives is only possible with the support from the Board and the management 
leadership team.
In relation to the gradual refresh of our Board, work on this is continuing through to 2024 and 
we have commenced the search for a new Independent Non-executive Director with particular 
strength and experience on Audit & Risk Committees of comparable listed companies.
It would be remiss on our part not to thank former and outgoing Directors for their years of 
service and invaluable contributions to the Board and CLP. These include Mrs Fanny Law who 
retired at the 2023 AGM, Mrs Zia Mody and Mr Richard Lancaster who will be retiring at the 
2024 AGM and Mr J.A.H. Leigh who will retire in March 2024.
In preparing for 2024, an important work involving our Board Members is the Group strategy 
review. Preparatory work on this has commenced with a series of business unit and strategy 
updates having been made to the Board during the second half of 2023.
The level of regulatory oversight of sustainability is expected to increase and a key aspect of 
this is the reporting on sustainability. Building on the double materiality methodology approach 
that we have adopted in our sustainability reporting, the “financially material” topics will be the 
focus of our sustainability reporting in this year’s Annual Report.
2023 has been a year of transition for CLP as we navigate through the challenges, risks and 
opportunities for our Group’s businesses. This is another good reminder that our corporate 
governance practices will need to evolve to ensure that they remain fit for purpose consistent 
with our shareholders’ expectations whilst being guided by our culture of “doing the right 
things right”.

Implementing Findings  
from Board Review
Governance Oversight –  
Key Announcements
Board Committees Refresh
Board Succession
	 There were a number of material developments  
for the Group in 2023 which the Board exercised 
oversight of. We announced these to the market 
contemporaneously ensuring that the market is duly 
updated of these material developments. Highlights 
of these are set out below.
	 CEO transition – The Board had been involved in 
the succession planning and approval for the CEO 
transition as well as the communications plan for 
the transition. The announcement for the transition 
was made in June and covered the transitional 
arrangements and appointments.
	 Key developments for the Hong Kong Scheme of 
Control (SoC) Business – We issued an announcement 
in November which covered three important 
developments for the Hong Kong SoC Business as 
these were approved and agreed with the Hong Kong 
Government. These related to the Development Plan 
(2024-2028), the tariff for 2024 and the outcome 
from the Interim Review of the SoC.
	 Profit warning – The Company made an 
announcement in January 2024 regarding the 
expected impairment of goodwill of EnergyAustralia’s 
Customer business. The announcement of the 
expected impairment was based on management’s 
preliminary assessment ahead of the formal results 
announcement for 2023. Given the impact, the 
announcement was made to inform the market on a 
timely basis and considering the size of the expected 
impairment, we also announced the expected total 
operating earnings and total earnings for 2023 based 
on the management accounts.
	 Two key initiatives were implemented from the 2022 
External Board Review findings.
	 Management Briefing sessions for the Board were 
introduced in 2023 and a total of 16 sessions were 
held during the year with a high level of attendance by 
Directors. The schedule of sessions with selected topics 
were provided to Directors in advance. The Directors’ 
attendance at these sessions were optional and 
depending on their interest and availability, Directors 
would be able to decide which session they would 
like to attend. The topics covered at the Management 
Briefing sessions included business unit updates and 
key group functional updates.
	 CLP Holdings Board Committee Chairs’ updates to the 
CLP Holdings Board at Board meetings were introduced 
as a new standing agenda item for the Board meetings. 
The Committee Chairmen’s update enabled Board 
Members to be briefed on matters of significance  
that were considered by the relevant Committees since 
the last Board meeting. This also had the effect of 
highlighting certain key issues to the Board’s attention 
and assisting the Board to focus its discussion on the 
pertinent issues.
	 At the beginning of 2023, we welcomed the 
appointment of Mrs Betty Yuen as a  
Non-executive Director and the appointment of  
Mr Andrew Brandler as the Vice Chairman of the 
Board both of which took effect on 1 January 2023.
	 In June 2023, we announced the succession plans for 
CLP Holdings CEO and Mr T.K. Chiang’s appointment  
on the Board took effect on the same date as  
he became CEO on 1 October 2023. As part of the 
CEO transition, our former CEO Mr Richard Lancaster 
remained on the Board as an Executive Director and 
he will step down from all his positions with CLP at 
the conclusion of the 2024 AGM.
	 Ms Wang Xiaojun Heather was appointed as an 
additional Independent Non-executive Director in 
May 2023. In considering Ms Wang’s appointment, 
the Nomination Committee recognised her extensive 
experience in human resources at the executive 
leadership level and that her skills, experience and 
background are well aligned with the Board’s focus 
on organisational talent capability.
	 The beginning of the year 2023 saw  
Mr Andrew Brandler took up the Chair position of 
the Finance & General Committee, Ms May Siew 
Boi Tan became the Chairperson of the Audit & Risk 
Committee and Mr Chunyuan Gu also joined the 
Human Resources & Remuneration Committee.
	 Ms Wang Xiaojun Heather joined the Audit & Risk 
Committee and the Human Resources & Remuneration 
Committee in May when she joined the Board.
	 The Sustainability Committee was reconstituted 
during the year with the appointment of Independent 
Non-executive Director Mr Chunyuan Gu as the 
Chairman of the Sustainability Committee on  
1 October. The Committee became a Non-executive 
Directors and Independent Non-executive Directors 
only Committee with effect on 1 January 2024. 
Management Committee Members stepped down 
from the Committee and the terms of reference 
also provided that the composition will comprise 
Non-executive Directors only with at least three 
Independent Non-executive  Directors.
	 On 1 October 2023, Mr Andrew Brandler also joined 
the Human Resources & Remuneration Committee as 
a Member.

The CLP Code: Compliance and more
The Company has its own unique code namely The CLP Code on Corporate Governance (CLP Code). It is built on CLP’s 
own standards and experience while respecting the benchmarks set by The Stock Exchange of Hong Kong Limited 
(Hong Kong Stock Exchange). The CLP Code is on the CLP website and available on request. In 2023, we have updated 
the CLP Code to reflect the new requirements under the Corporate Governance Code (Corporate Governance Code), 
Appendix C1 of the Rules Governing the Listing of Securities on the Hong Kong Stock Exchange (Listing Rules). 
Our Code goes beyond the principles of good corporate governance and incorporates the code provisions on a “comply 
or explain” basis and certain recommended best practices as set out in the Corporate Governance Code. The only 
exception, however, concerns quarterly reporting, details of which are explained on page 97.
We have made further enhancements to our corporate governance practices in 2023 and some of these are highlighted 
in “2023 At a Glance”.

How our Purpose, Values, Strategy and Culture are aligned?
An overarching culture of honesty and integrity 
...is consistent and well aligned with those key principles and commitments in our:
Our Culture
Our updated Value Framework was launched in February 2024 and articulates our refreshed Purpose, Vision, 
Mission and our Core Values. As we embark on our Group strategy review in 2024, these fundamental 
principles will guide our formulation of the Group’s Strategy.
Purpose
“… to Power Brighter Tomorrows.”
Vision
“… to be a leading responsible 
 energy provider …” 
“… provide sustainable energy 
 solutions …”
Mission
Strategy
Core Values
Care
“… builds trusted, long-term 
 relationships …” 
Excellence
“… to deliver superior performance, 
 growth and value.” 
Responsibility
“… do the right things right.”


Areas in which our Corporate Governance Practices exceed the Hong Kong Stock Exchange  
Corporate Governance Code
Our Board
	 The composition of the Board and the Audit & Risk Committee exceed the independence requirements under the Listing 
Rules.
	 A dedicated Sustainability Committee to oversee the management of all long and short term sustainability issues and is 
chaired by an independent director and comprises Non-executive Directors only.
	 We conduct regular external and internal Board and Board Committee reviews and when completed, we publish  
a summary of the conclusions of the external Board review on the CLP website. 
	 With the objective of minimising succession risk, the retirement age guideline in our Board Diversity Policy provides  
that where a Non-executive Director (other than the Chairman) has reached the age of 72 at the time of the relevant 
AGM, such Director will not be considered for re-election, however, this may be waived if the Board considers such 
Director has the skills, experience or capabilities that cannot be replaced at the relevant time.
	 By reference to our Board Diversity Policy, we are committed to the gradual refresh of the Board and the Board 
Committees.
	 We issue a formal letter of appointment for Non-executive Directors. The model letter is on our website and deals 
with a range of matters regarding a Director’s appointment and responsibilities including an expected level of time 
commitment. 
	 We have a set of bespoke Onboarding Guidelines for Directors with the key objective of assisting new Directors in their 
understanding of CLP’s business, governance and Board and Committee dynamics. The Guidelines are available on the 
CLP website. 
Our disclosure
	 The CLP Fair Disclosure Policy sets out the principles for the broad and non-exclusionary distribution of information to 
the public.
	 The Continuous Disclosure Obligation Procedures guide the organisation in monitoring and disclosing potential inside 
information.
	 The Continuous Disclosure Committee conducts regular assessment of potential inside information.
	 We adopt a double materiality methodology to identify and report the sustainability-related issues that are financially 
material to us.
	 We disclose our Senior Management’s confirmation of compliance with the Listing Rules Model Code and CLP Code for 
Securities Transactions, in addition to similar disclosures by our Directors.
	 We issue individual Board Committee reports in our Annual Report for the Audit & Risk Committee, Sustainability 
Committee, Nomination Committee and Human Resources & Remuneration Committee.
	 Our Risk Management Report in the Annual Report sets out CLP’s risk management framework and how CLP manages 
the Group’s material risks.
	 We announce our financial results within two months after the end of the financial year. The Annual Report is available 
on our website within the following fortnight with hardcopies sent to shareholders about two weeks after that. 
	 We have published CLP’s Climate Vision 2050 since 2007 which sets out the blueprint of CLP’s latest decarbonisation 
actions and with targets updated at regular intervals. 
	 We disclose on our website minutes of our AGM; in addition, any questions or topics that are not specifically addressed 
at the AGM, full answers are provided and disclosed. 
CLP Holdings 2023 Annual Report

Corporate Governance Report


Our unique policies and practices
	 CLP has established its own Corporate Governance Framework, the Value Framework and its own Code for Securities 
Transactions.
	 We conduct a Group-wide Business Practice Review for our staff on a periodic basis to foster employees’ understanding 
of our Code of Conduct under CLP’s Value Framework. An important aspect of this is ensuring that our employees 
maintain a good understanding of CLP’s culture and values. 
	 We have a CLP Procurement Values and Principles. This explains our procurement values and principles and we 
encourage all suppliers to abide by the same values and principles as ourselves, and to adopt the same standards of 
integrity and transparency in doing business with us.
	 General Representation Letters are issued by our CEO and CFO to the Audit & Risk Committee as attestation of 
compliance.
	 Our Audit & Risk Committee regularly examines the audit activity reviews conducted by the Internal Auditors.  
The Internal Auditors highlight the significant events and findings which require the Committee’s attention and further 
examination, where appropriate.
	 Members of our Audit & Risk Committee conduct meetings as between Members only prior to the full Committee 
meeting attended by management and the auditors; two of which are joined by the independent auditor. 
	 For the Group’s continuing connected transactions (CCTs), we engage the Company’s independent auditor, PwC, to 
undertake an agreed-upon procedures (AUP) engagement on the Group’s CCTs pricing policies. The AUP findings are 
provided to the Independent Non-executive Directors as part of their consideration of the CCTs for the purposes of 
giving the required confirmation under Rule 14A.55 of the Listing Rules.
Compliance with the Corporate Governance Code and Environmental, Social and Governance 
Reporting Guide of the Hong Kong Stock Exchange
CLP’s Approach to Corporate Governance
Throughout the financial year ended 31 December 2023, the Company had complied with the code provisions as well as 
applied all the principles in the Corporate Governance Code. CLP deviates from only one recommended best practice in the 
Corporate Governance Code – that an issuer should announce and publish quarterly financial results.
Our Considered Reasons for not Issuing Quarterly Financial Results
While CLP does issue quarterly statements which set out key financial and business information such as electricity sales, 
dividends and progress in major activities, we do not issue quarterly financial results for the following considered reasons:
	 they do not bring significant benefits to our shareholders;
	 they encourage a short-term view of the Company’s business performance;
	 CLP’s activities do not run and need not be disclosed and judged on a three-month cycle; and
	 preparation of quarterly reports is costly, including the opportunity cost of Board and management time spent on quarterly 
reporting.

CLP’s Approach to Sustainability Reporting
Governance Structure
	 Sustainability is at the heart of CLP’s business strategy and the CLP Board has overall responsibility for CLP’s sustainability 
reporting. The Directors’ Report includes the “Board’s Statement on Sustainability”, which explains the Board’s oversight of 
sustainability-related issues and how CLP approaches and manages the sustainability-related topics (page 175).
	 Sustainability governance has been embedded in our corporate governance structure throughout the Group. Set out below 
is CLP’s Sustainability Governance Structure.

	 As one of the Board-level Committees, the Sustainability Committee has a primary role in overseeing the management of  
the Group’s sustainability issues and is supported by the management-level Sustainability Executive Committee. As an 
oversight role, the Sustainability Committee was reconstituted with changes introduced in 2023 and is now chaired by an 
Independent Non-executive Director and comprises Non-executive Directors only, with five Independent Non-executive 
Directors including the Chairman. The Audit & Risk Committee, meanwhile, ensures appropriate assurance of the ESG data.
	 Further information about CLP’s sustainability management approach and how progress on sustainability-related goals 
and targets are reported and reviewed can be found in the Delivering Our Sustainability Agenda chapter, Risk Management 
Report, the Sustainability Committee Report and the Directors’ Report of this Annual Report, as well as in the Sustainability 
Report published online at the same time as this Annual Report. 
Reporting Principles & Boundaries
	 Materiality – Since 2018, materiality assessments have been carried out on the basis of examining how megatrends could 
impact the success of CLP’s strategy in the medium- to long-term. In 2023, CLP provided a more detailed description of its 
sustainability-related impacts, risks and opportunities (IROs), and for the first time this process was reviewed and assured 
by CLP’s non-financial auditor.
	 Quantitative and Consistency – CLP’s sustainability-related disclosures follow guidelines and recommendations from the 
SASB Standards for Electric Utilities & Power Generators, the Hong Kong Stock Exchange’s Environmental, Social and 
Governance Reporting Guide (ESG Reporting Guide) and the Global Reporting Initiative Reporting Standards (GRI Universal 
Standards 2021). 
IFRS S1 /  TNFD – CLP also makes reference to emerging disclosure standards including International Financial Reporting 
Standards (IFRS) S1 – General Requirements for Disclosure of Sustainability-related Financial Information and the 
recommendations of the Task Force on Nature-related Financial Disclosures (TNFD).
CLP Holdings 2023 Annual Report
98
Corporate Governance Report


IFRS S2 – Between 2023 and early 2024, CLP conducted a review of CLP’s Climate Vision 2050 with the aim of further 
accelerating its transition to a net-zero future. Climate-related disclosures are integrated into the latest edition of  
CLP’s Climate Vision 2050 publication and in the Annual Report, in which the disclosures make reference to  
IFRS S2 – Climate-related Disclosures. 
Sustainability-related KPIs / Greenhouse Gas Emissions – CLP Group’s Sustainability-related KPIs are provided over a period 
of five years in the Five-year Summary: CLP Group Environmental, Social and Governance (ESG) Data on pages 288 to 291 
of the Annual Report (Five-year Summary). Greenhouse gas emissions are reported with reference to World Resources 
Institute’s (WRI) Greenhouse Gas Protocol.
	 Boundaries – As our business needs and focus evolve, scenarios may arise where our previously defined reporting scope 
was not able to fully capture the material impacts of our overall portfolio, and to better reflect these impacts, selected 
reporting scopes will be adjusted in different aspects. In 2023, assets added to the reporting scope included the Bobai wind 
farm, Hong Kong LNG Terminal Limited, Darlington Point Energy Storage and Riverina Energy Storage System II.  
Apraava Energy ceased to be a subsidiary from December 2022 and is now accounted for as a joint venture. For transparency, 
Apraava Energy’s sustainability performance was reported separately in ESG Data Table section of the Sustainability 
Report. 
Sustainability-related Disclosure in the 2023 Annual Report and 2023 Sustainability Report 
	 Details on how we report on the sustainability-related issues in accordance with the ESG Reporting Guide “comply or 
explain” requirements and related Listing Rules are set out below.
	 We follow a thorough materiality assessment as the foundation for our sustainability strategy and reporting and this has 
been well received by our stakeholders and users of our reports.  Our materiality assessment process enabled management 
to determine which material topics are likely to affect the Group’s cash flows, access to finance or cost of capital in the 
short, medium and long term (financial materiality). Accordingly, the financial effects of those topics are disclosed in the 
Annual Report. Further information is in the Delivering Our Sustainability Agenda chapter on page 40.
	 Topics with material impact to the nature and a wide range of stakeholders namely, customers, people, business partners 
and communities are discussed in CLP’s online Sustainability Report. It is published at the same time as the Annual Report 
and captures in detail the Company’s delivery of social and environmental value in a rapidly changing environment.  
In addition, data related to financially material and impact material priorities are set out in the Five-year Summary on  
page 286. 
	 With stakeholders’ increasing interest in CLP’s response to climate change and its impact on business, we have 
recently updated CLP’s Climate Vision 2050 standalone publication and this includes detailed discussion of our updated 
decarbonisation targets and transition plans. Key climate-related metrics are also included in the Annual Report and 
Sustainability Report. 
 
	 The table below sets out the financially material topics by reference to the aspects in the ESG Reporting Guide and 
discussions and data on these topics can be found in the corresponding chapters of this Annual Report. Aspects A3 (The 
Environment and Natural Resources) and B8 (Community Investment) in the ESG Reporting Guide are regarded as impact 
material priorities and these are discussed primarily in the Sustainability Report and are also covered in the “Five-year 
Summary: CLP Group Environmental, Social and Governance (ESG) Data” (page 288) of the Annual Report.

up to the date of this Report) (the Period):
Strategy
Group strategy and

During the course of the Period, the Board received updates on the business and 
strategy for the individual business units and the Board discussed with management 
on the strategy, the risks and opportunities for the Group’s business units including 
CLP China, CLPe, EnergyAustralia and Apraava Energy as well as the Group’s strategic 
investments. These individual business updates on the business and strategy were part 
of the preparatory work for the Group strategy review which will be undertaken in 2024. 
The Board spent a significant time in overseeing CLP Power’s work associated with the 
Development Plan and Interim Review under the SoC business.
Oversight of implementation 
– Management Briefing 
sessions
This was a newly introduced initiative for 2023. A total of 16 sessions were held during the 
year where management provided briefings to the Board on each of the business units and 
key group functions as represented by the Group Executive Committee Members.  
A selected topic was scheduled for the briefing sessions.
Governance and Risk
Profit warning
The Board was kept updated by management on the process of the impairment assessment  
of EnergyAustralia’s Customer business. The Board’s consideration and review of the profit 
warning announcement was supported by the Audit & Risk Committee oversight of 
impairment assessment process.
Revision of CLP’s Value 
Framework
The Board was briefed on the key changes to CLP’s Value Framework, which reflects the 
aspirations and desired culture for our people and organisation.
Audit & Risk Committee 
activities
The Board received the important overview from the Chairperson of the Audit & Risk 
Committee on the Committee’s review of financial statements and oversight of risk 
management and internal control systems ahead of management’s presentation of the  
full-year and half-year financial statements.

time with the active engagement and inputs from Members of the Nomination Committee 
as well as the Non-executive Directors.

of the recommendations and action plan items.

Corporate Governance Report


Leadership and People
Chairman’s session
The Chairman held an annual meeting with the Independent Non-executive Directors 
only and a separate annual meeting with the Non-executive Directors only. Both of these 
sessions were on an open agenda format for the Independent Non-executive Directors 
and Non-executive Directors, as the case may be, to raise any matters of interest to the 
Group with the Chairman. One of the key topics discussed was on the CEO succession 
arrangements.
Performance Monitoring and Planning
Results and dividends
The Board approved the following: 2022 and 2023 Annual Reports; 2023 Interim Report; 
the quarterly statements; and the dividends for the financial years ended 31 December 
2022 and 2023; as well as the business plan and budget. The Board also approved the 
profit warning announcement which included the preliminary key financial performance 
results of the Group for 2023 based on management accounts and this was released in 
advance of the formal results announcement.
In approving the Annual Reports and Interim Report, the Board also approved the financial 
statements and ensured that the statements give a true and fair view of the financial 
position of the Group.
Regular updates to the  
Board
The Board considered the matters covered in the CEO’s Report where the CEO highlighted 
key issues on safety and business updates for each of the Group’s markets. This enabled 
the Board to keep abreast of the material issues and developments of the CLP Group.
In between Board meetings, the Directors received the CLP Group management report that 
provided updates on the Group’s key financial information as well as reports on health, 
safety and environment. In addition, Management Briefing sessions were held during the 
year as explained in the above.

update
The Board was briefed on the investor feedback from the 2022 annual results roadshow 
and 2023 interim results roadshow. The Board gained valuable insights regarding the 
investors position and expectations as to CLP’s financial performance.
Hong Kong business
The work on the Development Plan, 2024 tariff and Interim Review of the SoC business 
were the main focus for the Hong Kong business and the stakeholders support in this 
area was of equal importance. The Board spent a considerable time in the oversight of the 
approach in managing the Hong Kong business’s key stakeholders.

The Company has in place a set of Onboarding Guidelines with the key objective of assisting new Director in understanding of CLP’s 
business, governance and Board and Committee dynamics. This sets out a structured onboarding process that would serve as a roadmap  
for new Director to gain a better understanding of CLP and our business environment.

the Director’s unique background, skills, experience and perspective. Components of our Onboarding Programme include:
	 an introduction session;
	 face-to-face and one-on-one meetings with the Chairman of the Board, Chairman of the Board Committees and the Senior Management 
who work closely with the Board and Board Committees;
	 access to information that provides a broad overview of the CLP Group;
	 invitation to attend Board Committee meetings to assist with the understanding of the work carried out by various Board Committees; 
and
	 visits to the major facilities of CLP and / or special projects with CLP’s involvement.
As part of the onboarding sessions for the newly-appointed Independent Non-executive Director, Ms Wang Xiaojun Heather met with some 
of the Senior Management members and visited CLP facilities during August to October 2023 including visiting facilities in Mainland China 
and Australia and met with the operational management team.
Directors’ Time and Directorship Commitments
Our Directors, Non-executive Directors in particular, have demonstrated a strong commitment to the CLP Board affairs and 
they are well aware that they are expected to have a sufficient time commitment to the Board. Directors have given certain 
confirmations and made disclosures about their other commitments.
	 Sufficient time and attention
	 Directors have confirmed that they have given sufficient time and attention to the affairs of the Company for the year.
	 Other offices and commitments
	 Directors disclose to the Company twice a year the number, identity and nature of offices held in Hong Kong or overseas 
listed public companies and organisations and other significant commitments, together with an indication of the time 
involved.
	 Other directorships
	 None of our Directors, individually, held directorships in more than seven public companies (including the Company) as at 
31 December 2023.
Our Executive Directors do not hold directorship in other public companies; however, they are encouraged to participate in 
professional, public and community organisations.
In respect of those Directors who stand for election or re-election at the 2024 AGM, all their directorships and board committee

CLP Holdings 2023 Annual Report


The report also identified the opportunities to enhance the Board’s impact through the two areas of refreshing the Board’s 
composition and strengthening the partnership between the Board and management. With a view of achieving these 
objectives, a number of initiatives and actions were taken during 2023:
	 the appointment of Ms Wang Xiaojun Heather as an Independent Non-executive Director with specific experience in 
organisation talent management and development in international markets and in Mainland China;
	 Directors’ visit to the Group’s operations and facilities were recommenced;
	 the introduction of the Management Briefing sessions for the Directors;
	 the Finance & General Committee received a more regular update on the business units’ strategy;
	 preparatory work for the 2024 Group strategy review had commenced;
	 the Sustainability Committee was repositioned with a stronger focus on the strategy for sustainability; and
	 the Board received updates from each of the Board Committee Chairmen at every Board meeting.
Nomination and Appointment of Directors
Following the Nomination Committee’s recommendations, the Board considered and appointed two new Directors in 2023: 
Ms Wang Xiaojun Heather as an Independent Non-executive Director; and Mr T.K. Chiang as an Executive Director. Mrs Betty 
Yuen’s appointment as a Non-executive Director took effect on 1 January 2023 and the Board had considered her appointment 
in 2022.
Independent Non-executive Director Appointment
For the search process in the lead up to the appointment of Ms Wang Xiaojun Heather as an Independent Non-executive 
Director, CLP followed a formal and transparent procedure and is guided by CLP’s Nomination Policy, which is disclosed in the 
Nomination Committee Report on page 153.
Executive Director Appointment
Through an extensive CEO succession planning process, Mr T.K. Chiang was identified as the CEO successor to Mr Richard 
Lancaster and the appointment as the CEO and an Executive Director was approved by the Board. The process was conducted 
with the active engagement and inputs from Members of the Nomination Committee as well as the Non-executive Directors.

Why Board Diversity is Important to CLP
We recognise that Board diversity is an essential element contributing to the sustainable development of CLP.
Aspects of Diversity cover:
independence / gender / age / cultural and education background / professional experience / 
business perspectives / skills / knowledge / ethnicity / length of service
The Policy incorporates:
Code Provisions of the Corporate Governance Code
Retirement Age Guideline (age 72) for Non-executive Directors (other than the Chairman)
30% target for female Director representation on the CLP Holdings Board – to be reviewed by the Nomination 
Committee annually
Independence mechanism (for directors to express their views and feedback) will be reviewed by the Nomination 
Committee annually
CLP Group Diversity and Inclusion Policy for Senior Management and Staff
CLP Board Diversity Policy adopted by the Board in 2013 (available on website)
Our Board Diversity Policy also recognises that board diversity can be achieved without increasing the size of the Board and 
that a reduction in board size due to retirements without replacement can also be a way to further diversity. During the Period, 
our Board size increased from 14 to 15 due to the appointment of one additional Executive Director.

How the Board has been refreshed
One initiative to enhance the Board’s diversity is to gradually refresh the composition of the Board.
As part of our continuing efforts to gradually refresh our Board, the Board saw two new appointments and one retirement 
since January 2023. We believe that this is an important balancing act of bringing experienced Directors with fresh ideas and 
experience aligned with CLP’s strategic priorities and ensuring that the Board remains well represented by Directors with 
a good degree of CLP corporate knowledge, background and history. The diagram below shows how the Board has been 
refreshed over the past five years.
Disclosure of Conflict of Interest and Independence of Directors
Conflicts
Directors are requested to declare their and their connected entities’ direct or indirect interests, if any, in proposals or 
transactions to be considered by the Board at Board meetings and withdraw from the meetings as appropriate. In addition, 
where there are actual or potential conflict of interests, restrictions on access to agenda materials will be put in place. In 2023, 
none of the Directors were required to withdraw from Board meetings in these circumstances.
The Company follows guidelines at each financial reporting period to obtain confirmations from Directors in respect of any 
transactions of the Company or its subsidiaries which are related to Directors or their connected entities.
In addition, identified significant related party transactions are disclosed in Note 32 to the Financial Statements.
Independence
For the year ended 31 December 2023, the Company received written confirmations from all of the Independent Non-executive 
Directors regarding the independence of each of them and their immediate family members.
Among the Independent Non-executive Directors of the Company, none of them has held cross-directorship with other 
Directors.
Our view on independence
The Company maintains the view that a Director’s independence is a question of fact and this is formally recognised in the 
Board Diversity Policy. The Board is committed to assessing this on an ongoing basis with regard to all relevant factors 
concerned, including the ability to continually provide constructive challenge for management and other Directors; to express 
one’s own views independent of management or other fellow Directors; and the gravitas inside and outside the boardroom. 
These attributes and desired behaviour have been demonstrated by our Independent Non-executive Directors as  
circumstances require.

Mechanisms for ensuring independent views and input
The Company has established channels through formal and informal means whereby Independent Non-executive Directors  
can express their views in an open and candid manner, and in a confidential manner, should circumstances require.
Communication channels for Independent Non-executive Directors:
	 dedicated meeting session between Independent Non-executive Directors and the Chairman only (before Board meeting);
	 board evaluation conducted by external consultant once every 3 years and internal survey conducted in the intervening 
period;
	 Independent Non-executive Director as Chairman of various Board Committees – Committee Chairman can update Board 
Chairman as necessary; and
	 other informal meetings outside the boardroom.
The Audit & Risk Committee has been asked to provide feedback and the Nomination Committee has been delegated with  
the authority to review the implementation and the effectiveness of the independence mechanism on an annual basis.
Taking into account all of the circumstances described in this section, the Company considers all of the Independent  
Non-executive Directors to be independent.
Details of all Directors and their biographies including, if any, relationship between the members are disclosed on pages 82 to 
89 and on our website. 
Directors’ Shareholding Interests
Directors’ interests in CLP’s securities as at 31 December 2023 are disclosed in the Directors’ Report on page 174. All Directors 
have confirmed, following specific enquiry by the Company, that throughout the year ended 31 December 2023 they have 
complied with the required standard set out in the Model Code and the CLP Code for Securities Transactions. The CLP Code for 
Securities Transactions is largely based on the Model Code set out in Appendix C3 of the Listing Rules and is on terms no less 
exacting than those in the Model Code.
Management and Staff
CLP recognises the importance of diversity not just at the Board level but throughout the CLP Group. Our respect for people 
and diversity are embedded in CLP’s Code of Conduct and our Board Diversity Policy has also incorporated the CLP Group 
Diversity and Inclusion Policy for Senior Management and Staff.
One of the key tasks of CLP’s management and staff is the successful implementation of strategy and direction as determined 
by the Board under the leadership of our Chairman. This includes promoting and “living” the good corporate culture set by our 
Board over the years. In doing so, they must apply business principles and ethics which are consistent with those expected by 
the Board, CLP’s shareholders and other stakeholders, and these have been documented in our Code of Conduct.
A key fundamental feature of CLP’s corporate governance is a culture of “doing the right things right”, this “tone” is set at the 
top of the organisation at the Board level and is embedded throughout our Value Framework, Code of Conduct, CLP Code and 
the Whistleblowing Policy.
Subsidiary Board Governance
The subsidiary board governance plays an important part to ensure that at the management level, the culture set at the 
Holdings Board level is observed and followed and that the expected standard of business principles and ethics will be 
consistently applied at the subsidiary board and management level. A number of the subsidiary board positions are taken 
up by our mid-management leaders where their legal responsibilities at the subsidiary board level are aligned with their 
accountability in their business or functional capacity.
The mid-management subsidiary directors are of a certain level of seniority who are familiar with the CLP culture and  
have a solid understanding of their obligations and responsibilities as a corporate director and an organisational leader.  
These subsidiary level directors are expected to lead by example and help guide and oversee our people to ensure that the 
right culture is not just observed but is applied in how we conduct our business.

CLP Holdings 2023 Annual Report


Role of Management and Staff in Promoting Good Corporate Governance Practices
Our CEO has the overall responsibility for carrying out the strategy and direction set by the Board and for managing the 
Group’s business. The delegation of authority by the Board to the Committees, Senior Management and management are 
prescribed in the form of a “Company Management Authority Manual”.
Management and staff adhere to various Group policies that reflect the values and corporate culture of CLP.
Whistleblowing Policy
Applies to CLP Group (Apraava Energy 
and EnergyAustralia have their own 
policies).
 Employees and third parties may 
report suspected misconduct, 
malpractice or irregularity in 
confidence.
 2023: 10 reported cases (2022: 5).
Code of Conduct
Guiding principles for employees: 
to do what is right, behave with 
integrity and honesty, obey all laws 
and anti-corruption practices and 
communicate openly.
 2022 & 2023: no convicted case of 
corruption at CLP.
 2023: 17 breaches of Code of Conduct 
(2022: 10).
 Cases are reported to the 
Audit & Risk Committee.
Value Framework
CLP’s purpose, vision, mission, values, commitments, policies and codes.
Ongoing Training
In addition to setting the right tone at the top, we recognise the importance of communicating effectively with our staff, and 
the need to cascade down the key messages and expectations of what are expected from them to ensure that everyone will 
work together to contribute to a good corporate governance culture.
In an increasingly challenging and uncertain environment, where organisations could potentially be more vulnerable to the 
heightened risk of fraud, we have rolled out a Fraud Risk Awareness e-training to all CLP staff including all new joiners as part 
of the mandatory induction training programme. The e-training focused on the importance of identifying different forms of 
potential fraud, and on how CLP staff can prevent, detect, respond to, and report cases of fraud.
We have also launched e-learning programmes on CLP Corporate Governance Framework and Internal Controls to reiterate the 
basic governance framework, principles and standards required for an effective system of management controls.
All the above-mentioned e-training are available on the CLP intranet for staff to understand, learn and refresh anytime as they 
see appropriate.

Securities Dealing
Our Management and Staff are subject to CLP Securities Dealing Restrictions.
	 We appreciate that some of our staff may in their day-to-day work have access to potential inside information.
	 Our Senior Management and selected members of staff, “Specified Individuals”, are subject to securities dealing restrictions 
in the CLP Code for Securities Transactions.
	 Securities Transactions: All members of the Senior Management have confirmed, following specific enquiry by the Company,  
that throughout the year ended 31 December 2023 they have complied with the required standard set out in the Model 
Code and the CLP Code for Securities Transactions.
	 Shareholding in CLP shares: Save for the interest disclosed by Mr Richard Lancaster in the Directors’ Report on page 194, 
the other members of the Senior Management did not have any interests in CLP Holdings’ securities as at 31 December 2023.
Senior Management Training and Development
We have a formal procedure in place for reporting the training and continuous professional development of Senior Management. 
Members of Senior Management have access to a variety of training activities. These include access to online learning and 
information resources, formal executive development programmes at leading business schools and executive briefings on 
matters of topical interest provided through our strategic partnerships with organisations such as Chatham House, IMD and  
The Economist. We also make selective use of independent executive assessment and coaching processes to assist with 
identifying individual development needs and provide input to our succession planning decisions.

Organisation’s Gender Diversity
The importance of gender diversity at the CLP Holdings Board level is extended throughout the organisation. We believe a 
diverse workforce and an inclusive culture supports high performance and CLP’s ability to operate effectively in the many 
communities in which it operates. CLP has set targets to encourage more women into the workforce, and policies to support 
employees to balance work and home-life commitments. Considering the nature of our business and the markets we operate 
in, addressing gender diversity is a Group-wide priority to ensure a sustainable workforce and to deliver a wider, positive  
social and economic contribution. Long-term aspirational Group-wide gender diversity targets have been set, reflecting  
UN Sustainable Development Goals, these are:
	 Women in Leadership target: to achieve gender balance in leadership positions by 2030 against a 2016 baseline of 22%; and
	 Women in Engineering target: for 30% of engineers to be female by 2030 compared to a 2016 baseline of 9%.
As indicated in the table on page 71, the gender diversity across the Group for 2023 has been largely consistent with that of 
2022. The Group is committed to promoting diversity and inclusion across the organisation.

Corporate Governance Report


Shareholders’ Rights
Shareholders are one of our key stakeholders and from a corporate governance perspective, the rights of our shareholders  
are well recognised and these include:
	 the right to receive declared dividends and to vote and attend general meetings; and
	 the right to convene general meetings and to put forward proposals – details of which can be found in our explanatory 
notes to the Notice of AGM and on our website or on request. 
CLP’s Dividends Policy
We create long-term value to our shareholders through dividend payments. CLP’s Dividends Policy, adopted by the Board in 
February 2019, aims to provide reliable and consistent ordinary dividends with steady growth when supported by our earnings 
whilst ensuring that a solid financial position can be maintained to fund our business growth. In line with our established 
practice, our ordinary dividends are paid four times a year in each of the quarters. CLP’s Dividends Policy is available on the 
CLP website. 
The Company’s performance- and dividend-related dates for 2024 are set out in Information for Our Investors on page 302.
2023 Hybrid AGM
The 2023 AGM was held in a hybrid format on 5 May 2023. Shareholders had the option of attending the physical AGM at the 
Principal Meeting Place (with prior registration to ensure the orderly attendance having regard to the size of the venue) or 
participating through the online AGM.
Most of our Directors (including our Chairman), Senior Management and our independent auditor attended the physical 
meeting. Our Chairman, The Hon Sir Michael Kadoorie played host and delivered his speech.
The opportunity for shareholders to attend the AGM and to send their questions in advance of the AGM and in real-time 
through the online platform allowed shareholders to express their views.
Highlights of the 2023 Hybrid AGM
	 All registered and non-registered shareholders who joined online could view a live webcast of the AGM, pose questions 
and cast votes in near real-time through the online platform. To ensure the online AGM was conducted effectively, a chat 
response function was available on the online platform to address procedural questions from shareholders.
	 New call in function was introduced on the online platform allowing shareholders joining online to ask questions verbally.
	 An attendance of around 700 shareholders, 60% of which participated physically and 40% participated online.
	 A high level of votes approving the following major items:
	 the election and re-election of Directors ranging from about 83% to 98%; and
	 the general mandate to issue new shares of up to 5% of shares in issue only, at a price not being at a discount of more 
than 10% to a benchmarked price (about 98%) and to repurchase shares of not more than 10% shares in issue (over 99%).
	 Through the online platform, shareholders posed various questions and most of these questions were addressed during the 
meeting; and questions not taken at the AGM were answered in writing and made available on the Company’s website.

Corporate Governance Report


Reviewing and enhancing shareholders communication
The Audit & Risk Committee is responsible for the annual 
review of the implementation and effectiveness of the 
Shareholders’ Communication Policy, which is available on 
our website. The most recent review was undertaken in 
October 2023 and the implementation and effectiveness of 
the Policy was confirmed. 
Group Internal Audit
CLP’s Group Internal Audit (GIA) department plays a major 
role in monitoring the internal governance of the CLP Group. 
The head of the department, Senior Director – GIA, leads a 
well-resourced department of 23 highly qualified professional 
staff.
The Senior Director – GIA reports directly to the Audit & Risk 
Committee and administratively to the CFO and has direct 
access to the Board through the Chairperson of the Audit 
& Risk Committee. The Senior Director – GIA has the right 
to consult the Audit & Risk Committee without reference to 
management.
Independent Auditor
The Group engages PwC (Certified Public Accountants and 
Registered Public Interest Entity (PIE) Auditor) as our external 
independent auditor and we regard their independence as a 
fundamental governance principle.
How the Group ensures the independence of the external 
auditor:
	 The lead audit partner for CLP is subject to rotation 
every seven years (as per The International Federation  
of Accountants rules on independence of external 
auditors).
	 As part of the rotation, the current lead audit partner 
was first appointed for the 2021 financial year-end  
audit and she did not have any prior involvement in the 
CLP Group audit.
	 PwC is required to give an annual confirmation on their 
independence.
	 The Audit & Risk Committee will assess PwC’s 
independence in considering their re-appointment.
In addition, PwC will not be engaged to perform non-audit 
work unless the non-audit work meets the criteria suggested 
in the Listing Rules and has been pre-approved by the  
Audit & Risk Committee or its delegates. There must be clear 
efficiencies and value-added benefits to CLP from the work 
being undertaken by PwC, with no adverse effect on the 
independence of their audit work, or the perception of such 
independence.
During the year, PwC provided the following audit and 
permissible audit related and non-audit services to the Group:

Other Stakeholders
Good governance requires due regard to the impact of business decisions (including impact on people, the environment and 
the economy), both on shareholders and on other key stakeholders. This Annual Report and our online Sustainability Report 
explain how we discharge our responsibilities to employees, customers, lenders, the environment and the communities in 
which we operate. 
Risk Management and Internal Control Systems
Effective risk management and internal control systems help the organisation anticipate its risk exposure, put controls in place 
to counter threats, and effectively pursue the set objectives. They are therefore an essential part of an organisation’s operation 
and governance processes. This section explains (and contains cross references) the key features of our risk management and 
internal control systems.
Risk Management Framework
CLP’s overall risk management framework is overseen by, and is the responsibility of, the Board, through its Audit & Risk 
Committee, and comprises four key elements.
Risk Management 
Philosophy
CLP recognises that risk 
management is the 
responsibility of everyone 
within CLP and thus it is 
integrated into the 
business and 
decision-making process in 
which both risks and 
opportunities are viewed 
holistically.
Risk Governance 
Structure
Clear roles and 
responsibilities are 
assigned to multiple layers 
within the organisation. 
This structure facilitates 
risk identiﬁcation and 
escalation.
Risk Management 
Process
Through an integrated 
top-down and bottom-up 
risk review process, which 
enables risks identiﬁcation 
and prioritisation 
throughout the Group, 
management maintains an 
open and effective 
communication channel to 
enable the timely 
escalation of material risk 
and adequate supervision 
of risk mitigation.
Risk 
Appetite
The nature and extent of 
the risks that the Group is 
willing to undertake in 
pursuit of its strategic and 
business objectives.
The way we manage risk is set out in the Risk Management Report on page 127.

Corporate Governance Report


Internal Control Framework
CLP’s structure of internal control is based on the internationally recognised COSO (Committee of Sponsoring Organisations of 
the Treadway Commission) 2013 integrated framework.
Our internal control systems are designed to manage rather than eliminate the risk of 
failure in achieving our strategic and business objectives, and can only provide reasonable, 
but not absolute, assurance against material loss or misstatement.

The review process
Five times a year, the Audit & Risk Committee reviews management’s findings and the opinion of GIA regarding the Company’s 
risk management and internal control systems. The reviews cover management’s assessment of the internal controls of key 
business operations, changes in material risks, internal control and compliance issues (both financial and non-financial) and 
significant issues arising from internal and the external audit reports.
For the year ended 31 December 2023, the Board considered the risk management and internal control systems of the Group 
to be effective and adequate. No significant areas of concern that might affect shareholders were identified.
Inside Information
We have our own Continuous Disclosure Obligation Procedures which set out the procedures and controls for handling  
and dissemination of inside information. The Procedures are on the CLP website. Our Continuous Disclosure Committee 
(established in 2016) conducted regular assessment of potential inside information. The members of the committee include the 
CEO, CFO, the Joint Company Secretaries and the Director – Investor Relations. Please also see “Our disclosure” on page 96.

Corporate Governance Report


CLP’s risk management framework promotes a judicious risk culture, empowering the company 
to capitalise on opportunities while securing its long-term growth and success.
CLP’s Risk Management Framework
In line with international standards and best practices, CLP defines risk as the effect of uncertainty on objectives. The effect 
can be positive, negative or both, and can result in opportunities and threats. CLP aims to identify risks early so threats can be 
understood, managed, mitigated, transferred or avoided while opportunities can be captured where appropriate. This demands 
a proactive approach and an effective Group-wide risk management framework. The risk management framework at CLP 
comprises four key elements:
Risk 
Appetite
Risk Governance 
Structure
Risk Management 
Process
          
CLP’s Risk Management Philosophy
CLP recognises that risk management is the responsibility of everyone within the business, and that 
cultivating and embedding risk awareness into the organisational culture is critical to implementing the 
Group’s risk management framework. Risk management is therefore integrated into all business and 
decision-making processes, including strategy formulation, business development, business planning, capital 
allocation, investment decisions, internal control and day-to-day operations. Risks and opportunities alike are 
viewed holistically.
CLP has clear risk management objectives:
	 At a strategic level, CLP focuses on the identification and management of material risks inherently 
associated with the pursuit of the Group’s strategic and business objectives. In pursuing opportunities 
for growth and transformation, CLP aims to optimise risk and return decisions as defined and quantified 
through diligent and independent review and challenge processes.
	 At an operational level, CLP seeks to identify, analyse, evaluate and mitigate operational hazards and 
threats while enhancing and capturing opportunities for operational improvement where appropriate. It 
does this to create a safe, healthy, efficient and environmentally friendly workplace for employees and 
contractors while ensuring public safety and health and minimising environmental impact, as well as 
securing asset integrity and adequate insurance.

CLP’s Risk Appetite
CLP’s risk appetite represents the nature and extent of the risks the Group is willing to undertake in 
pursuit of strategic and business objectives. In line with CLP’s Value Framework and the expectations of 
stakeholders, the Group takes only reasonable risks that fit its strategy and capability, can be understood 
and managed, and do not expose the Group to:
	 Hazardous conditions affecting the health and safety of employees, contractors and the general public;
	 Material financial losses impacting the financial viability and strategy execution of the Group;
	 Material breaches of external regulations that could lead to fines or loss of critical operational and 
business licences;
	 Material damage to the Group’s reputation and brand;
	 Business or supply interruptions that could lead to severe impact on the community; and
	 Severe environmental incidents.
CLP has established risk profiling criteria that align with its risk appetite, assessing each identified risk based 
on a spectrum of consequences and likelihoods. A risk rating is generated by combining these two factors, 
aiding risk prioritisation and decision-making. In this assessment and prioritisation process, CLP takes 
into account non-financial consequences as outlined in its risk appetite statement together with financial 
consequences.
     
CLP’s Risk Governance Structure
	 Facilitates risk identification and escalation while providing assurance to the Board;
	 Assigns clear roles and responsibilities and facilitates implementation with guidelines and tools; and
	 Adopts the Five Lines of Assurance approach as explained below:

129
CLP Holdings 2023 Annual Report


   
CLP’s Risk Management Process
End-to-End risk management from the initial identification of risks to ongoing monitoring and review
	 The core process involves:
3	 Establishing scope, context and risk criteria relevant to the business processes in different business 
units and Group functions
3	 Identifying risks based on relevant, appropriate, up-to-date information
3	 Analysing risks with detailed consideration of risk sources, consequences, likelihood, events, 
scenarios, and existing controls and their effectiveness
3	 Evaluating and prioritising risks against the established risk criteria and allocating management 
efforts; and
3	 Developing and implementing controls and mitigation plans.
	 Communication and Consultation: A continuous and interactive process, involving communication and 
consultation with stakeholders.
	 Recording and Reporting: Processes and outcomes are documented and reported to facilitate 
communication and provide information for decision-making.
	 Monitoring and Review: Regular monitoring and review according to the established risk governance 
structure and process.
Integrated process is key to embedding risk considerations at all levels of CLP and across all activities 
	 The process is integrated into business and decision-making processes, including strategy formulation, 
business development, business planning, capital allocation, investment decisions, internal control and 
day-to-day operations. This helps provide a holistic view of both risks and opportunities, enabling CLP to 
make optimal decisions that balance risk and reward.
Strategic adaptation to evolving external challenges and opportunities
	 Understanding the external environment and significant megatrends which may have implications 
for CLP’s business and markets. CLP recognises certain external global trends could have an impact 
on its operating and strategic environment. These megatrends encompass political, economic, social, 
environmental and technological changes which could rapidly evolve, changing the context in which the 
company operates.
	 Climate Vision 2050 is the Group’s blueprint and strategy for the transition to net-zero greenhouse gas 
emissions by 2050, and has been instrumental in informing CLP’s business strategy and guiding its  
investment decisions. Climate Vision 2050 is also an integral part of CLP’s broader climate strategy, 
which covers key considerations around scenario analysis and long-term climate risks and opportunities 
identification, among others. It guides CLP in managing these issues. 
	 Material Topics are identified by conducting comprehensive annual materiality assessments to evaluate 
and respond to the sustainability-related risks and opportunities most likely to impact CLP’s business 
and stakeholders. The material topics emerging from these assessments inform CLP’s strategy and 
reporting on managing sustainability-related risks and leveraging sustainability-related opportunities. 
This integrated approach embeds material topics into CLP’s risk and opportunity management 
processes.

Process
Sustainability-related and climate-related risks are 
integrated into CLP’s risk management process 
and risk register along with all other types of 
risks, forming a crucial component of the Group-
wide Risk Management Framework. The company 
identifies these risks through its annual materiality 
assessments and a comprehensive series of 
top-down and bottom-up risk review processes. 
Climate scenario analysis and risk analysis are also 
conducted in line with the Climate Vision 2050 
review, conducted once every few years. In line with 
other material risks, CLP applies a consistent set 
of risk profiling criteria to evaluate sustainability-
related and climate-related risks. Business units and 
group functions manage these risks in accordance 
with CLP’s risk governance structure and risk 
management process, with oversight and assurance 
from management to the Board. 
CLP identifies sustainability-related and climate-related 
opportunities through its annual materiality assessment, 
the regularly updated Climate Vision 2050, strategy and 
business planning processes and ongoing monitoring of 
market developments. Climate scenario analysis provides 
insights into potential opportunities especially in response to 
the evolution of the energy system and market. Opportunities 
are considered in areas such as expanding renewable 
energy and other low-carbon electricity, offering energy 
efficiency services, supporting electrification and advancing 
battery storage. In assessing opportunities, factors such 
as commercial viability, partnership potential, alignment 
with climate targets, and future market demand are taken 
into account. Each business unit monitors and evaluates 
opportunities specific to their market as part of their business 
performance reviews. Potential investment opportunities 
are subjected to a series of opportunity management 
processes, including business development, business planning, 
investment decisions and capital allocation.

CLP Holdings 2023 Annual Report


Risk Management is an integral part of CLP’s business and decision-making processes – Examples
Quarterly Risk Review Process at Group Level 
An integrated top-down and bottom-up risk review process
 
CLP adopts an integrated top-down and bottom-up risk review process to enable:
(1)	 Comprehensive identification and prioritisation of all material risks throughout the Group;
(2)	 Containment of material risks at the appropriate managerial level;
(3)	 Effective risk dialogue among the management team; and
(4)	 Proper governance of risk mitigation efforts.
Top-down Process
	 At Group Risk Management quarterly meetings, members of the Group Executive Committee discuss the top-tier risks 
and examine any other risk issues they consider important. This dialogue offers an opportunity for management to 
identify and respond to emerging risks early on, voice risk concerns, share risk insights and seek risk management 
guidance.
	 In addition, emerging risks are proactively identified and characterised by observing changes in organisational contexts. 
They typically emerge as new circumstances or conditions not previously recognised, or as evolutions in the profiles of 
established risks. Group Risk Management facilitates the review of emerging risks by compiling relevant information 
from both internal and external sources.
	 Emerging risks that are identified and considered material are further assessed and monitored by relevant business 
units or Group functions.
Bottom-up Process
	 CLP’s business units and Group functions are required to submit their lists of material risks identified through their risk 
management process to Group Risk Management on a quarterly basis.
	 Through a diligent process of aggregation, filtration, prioritisation and consultation, Group Risk Management compiles a 
Quarterly Group Risk Management Report for review and discussion by the Group Executive Committee.
	 Upon approval, the report is submitted to the Audit & Risk Committee on a quarterly basis. “Deep dive” presentations on 
selected risks are given to the committee for more detailed review.

Risk Management Report


Risk Review Process for Investment Decisions
 
	 CLP adopts a multi-gated system of periodic project appraisals during development and investment cycles.
	 Investment opportunities or projects seeking endorsement by the CLP Holdings Investment Committee are reported 
through the Project Investment Opportunities process, managed by the Business Development & Asset Management 
Oversight team of Group Finance.
	 In addition, CLP requires an independent, multi-disciplinary review of any investment proposal. Independent risk 
appraisal by Group Risk Management is part of the investment review process.
	 Group Risk Management ensures a detailed risk assessment is carried out for each investment project. Detailed 
checklists and worksheets are used to identify risks, formulate mitigation measures and assess risk levels. Material risks 
and associated mitigations are highlighted and discussed at the Investment Committee, chaired by the CEO.
Risk Management Integrated with Internal Control Systems
 
	 Risk management is closely linked to CLP’s Integrated Framework of Internal Control. Key controls are subject to testing 
in order to assess their effectiveness. Details on Internal Control are set out in the Corporate Governance Report on 
pages 122 to 125.
Risk Management in the Business Planning Process
 
	 At CLP, risk management is integrated into strategy and business planning by departments and business units across the 
Group.
	 As part of the annual business planning process, business units are required to identify all material risks that may 
impact the delivery of their business strategy and objectives. Overarching strategic risks to the Group are also reviewed. 
Identified risks are evaluated on the same set of risk criteria as the quarterly risk review process. Plans to mitigate 
the identified risks are then developed. The material risks listed on pages 135 to 139 have been set out in CLP’s 2024 
business planning process.
133
CLP Holdings 2023 Annual Report


Material Risks to the Group
As an investor and operator in the energy sector of the Asia-Pacific region, CLP’s risk profile is categorised into five key risk 
areas – operational, market and commercial, regulatory, financial, and transformation. The top tier risk profile is summarised 
on pages 135 to 139:
Material Topics
Climate-related Risks and Opportunities
The impact of sustainability-related issues on the business and its stakeholders are reviewed regularly through an 
annual materiality assessment. The review process detailed on pages 42 to 48 helps align the Group’s strategy with its 
purpose and responds to the evolving needs of stakeholders, uncovering emerging ESG challenges and opportunities for 
consideration in the risk reviews and opportunity management processes.
In accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) S2 Climate-related Disclosures standard, 
climate-related risks and opportunities have been classified into three major categories:
CLP recognises the wide-ranging implications of climate change and considers climate-related risks a combination of 
standalone risks and drivers for other material risks. As illustrated in CLP's top-tier risk tables on pages 135 to 139, 
climate-related transition risks and physical risks have been identified respectively as standalone risks, categorised under 
Regulatory Risk and Operational Risk. The tables also depict other material risks associated with either climate-related 
transition or physical risk drivers, or a combination of the two, as well as climate-related opportunities.
Following the latest assessment, six material topics were identified:
The top-tier risk tables on pages 135 to 139 illustrate the links 
between material risks and the material topics.

Risks that arise from efforts to transition 
to a lower-carbon economy that entail 
policy, legal, technological, market 
and reputational risks, and could carry 
financial implications for a business, 
such as increased operating costs, asset 
impairment due to new or amended 
climate-related regulations or shifting 
consumer demands and the development 
and deployment of new technology.
Risks resulting from climate change that 
can be event-driven (acute physical risk) 
or from longer-term shifts in climatic 
patterns (chronic physical risk), and could 
carry financial implications for a business, 
such as costs resulting from direct damage 
to assets or the indirect effects of supply-
chain disruption.
Climate-related opportunities are the 
potential business opportunities resulting 
from the effects of climate change. 
Efforts to mitigate and adapt to climate 
change can produce climate-related 
opportunities for a business, such as 
investment opportunities in renewable 
energy, broader revenue streams and the 
adoption of new technologies.

Risk Management Report


Material Risks to the Group (continued)
Operational Risk
 
 
CLP’s operations are exposed to a variety of 
operational risks relating to Health, Safety and 
Environment (HSE) incidents and compliance, 
physical security, plant performance, data 
privacy, cyber security attacks on operational 
technology (OT) and IT systems, project 
delivery and extreme weather events resulting 
from climate change.
Following the declaration from the World 
Health Organisation (WHO) in May 2023 
that COVID-19 no longer constitutes a public 
health emergency of international concern, the 
residual risk of the pandemic to CLP has been 
downgraded.
CLP manages operational risk by:
a)	 Implementing Group-wide initiatives on eliminating exposure to 
serious injuries and fatalities (SIF);
b)	 Implementing Group HSE Management systems documents 
(Operational enablers) with a focus on critical controls in line with 
SIF potential;
c)	 Implementing operations and systems reinforcements to maintain a 
high operational and emissions performance;
d)	 Consolidating emergency response, crisis management, disaster 
recovery and business continuity plans with regular drills;
e)	 Enforcing a Group-wide Project Management Governance System 
to facilitate the delivery of high-quality projects; and
f)	 Introducing Group-wide cyber security policies and standards with 
appropriate controls, technologies and practices at all levels, while 
cultivating a cyber resilience culture across the Group.

Market & Commercial Risk
 
 
Market & Commercial risk refers to significant 
changes in market conditions and potential 
losses arising from inadequate gross margins 
and non-performance of trading partners 
or counterparties. It is important to ensure 
that our trading partners and counterparties 
are reliable, financially healthy and willing 
to abide by the contracts. Currently, delays 
in the collection of receivables, fuel supply 
interruptions and tariff adjustment challenges 
are key market and commercial risks impacting

Risk Management Report


Material Risks to the Group (continued)
Regulatory Risk
 
 
Following the 2023 interim review of the SoC 
Agreement in Hong Kong, more stringent 
performance targets – including the new 
penalty scheme for large-scale electricity 
supply interruption and enhanced information 
disclosure requirements – present a short-
term regulatory risk exposure. There is also a 
possible risk of adverse regulatory changes in 
the medium to longer term.
The Group’s Australian business continues to 
face regulatory challenges which may restrict 
its margin recovery, increase the complexity 
and cost of market operations, and present 
significant regulatory compliance challenges.
In Mainland China, the power sector reforms 
have resulted in a gradual evolution towards 
a market-based trading, together with 
other regulatory changes such as tighter 
environmental rules. CLP devised adaptive 
market sale strategies to enhance its risk-
bearing ability.
Geopolitical tensions between China and 
its major trading partners may bring new 
challenges to CLP’s business. Additional 
government approval on foreign direct 
investment (FDI) in India, such as Press Note 
3 requirements, may delay or prohibit CLP’s 
development and acquisition of projects in the 
region.
As CLP progresses its strategy to address 
climate change challenges, the pace of 
change in government policies, regulations, 
technologies and market structures could be 
faster than the Group’s responses.
CLP manages regulatory risk by:
a)	 Closely monitoring regulatory development as well as market and 
public sentiments;
b)	 Working constructively with governments to advocate CLP’s 
position on regulatory changes;
c)	 Mobilising internal resources to ensure timely responses to 
regulatory changes, while maintaining regulatory compliance and 
oversight;
d)	 Communicating and highlighting the importance of a balance 
between a reliable and safe supply, care for the environment, and 
reasonable tariffs;
e)	 Reinforcing CLP’s efforts to care for the community and promote 
energy efficiency;
f)	 Developing capacity and decarbonisation scenarios to achieve  
net-zero greenhouse gas emissions by 2050 and progressively 
phase out remaining coal-fired generation assets before 2040;
g)	 Working with the Hong Kong Government to explore ways to 
enhance regional cooperation on zero-carbon energy;
h)	 Conducting supply chain review for assets on imported equipment 
and spares and exploring alternative sources and localisation 
opportunities; and
i)	 Proactively engage with regulatory bodies and closely monitor FDI 
project plans.

Material Risks to the Group (continued)
Financial Risk
 
 
CLP’s investments and operations, which are 
long-term in nature, are exposed to financial 
risks in the areas of cash flow and liquidity, 
credit and counterparty risks, interest rate risks 
and foreign currency risks. Group-level earnings 
may also be impacted by marked-to-market fair 
value movements. Volatile foreign exchange 
and equity markets have further affected the 
cost of securing financing. Market liquidity has 
also been reduced amid high borrowing costs 
after several major collapses in the banking 
industry in 2023.
CLP manages financial risk by:
a)	 Timely review and replenishing of liquidity, maintaining investment 
grade credit ratings and preserving a healthy capital structure;
b)	 Taking pre-emptive action for early completion of major financings 
on preferential terms;
c)	 Securing debt funding diversity and maintaining an appropriate mix 
of committed credit facilities;
d)	 Maximising the use of local funding options;
e)	 Hedging most transactional foreign currency exposures in line with 
CLP’s Treasury Policy;
f)	 Pursuing “natural hedge” by matching the currency of revenue, cost 
and debt, and ensuring project level debt financing is denominated 
in and swapped into a functional currency;
g)	 Controlling financial counterparty exposure by transacting 
only with creditworthy and pre-approved financial institutions, 
allocating exposure limits based on banks’ credit standing, and 
ensuring non-recourse to CLP Holdings for counterparties of CLP 
Holdings’ subsidiaries and affiliates;
h)	 Maintaining good, trustworthy relationships with lenders (banks 
and bondholders); and
i)	 Ensuring transparency in financial communications and disclosures.

Transformation Risk
 
 
CLP is advancing on a journey to become 
better fit for a net-zero future and executing 
a portfolio of transformation programmes to 
expand its clean energy solutions and support 
the transition to net zero, while improving 
customer engagement and experience, 
cost effectiveness, system flexibility and 
reliability, and capabilities including a proactive 
commercial and supply chain practice.
CLP manages transformation risk by:
a)	 Strong coordination and leadership of strategic digital 
transformation initiatives;
b)	 Building excellence in commercial and supply chain management 
capabilities to raise supply chain resilience and agility;
c)	 Promoting innovation and digital and business development 
skillsets;
d)	 Evolving to more agile operating models and human resources 
management systems; and
e)	 Managing the culture agenda by embedding CLP’s values and 
appropriate risk culture in an increasingly diverse workforce.

Effectiveness Review of Risk Management and Internal Control Systems
CLP adopts the Five Lines of Assurance approach to coordinate and optimise its risk and assurance efforts as described on 
pages 128 to 129 of this report. Combined assurance includes Board oversight by the Audit & Risk Committee, management 
oversight by the CEO and the Group Executive Committee, independent assurance by internal audit, control and monitoring by 
Group functions, and risk and control ownership by business units. It should be acknowledged that CLP’s risk management and 
internal control systems are designed to manage rather than eliminate the risk of failure in achieving our strategic and business 
objectives and can only provide reasonable – not absolute – assurance against material loss or misstatement.
The Audit & Risk Committee, on behalf of the Board, has reviewed the effectiveness of the Group’s risk management and 
internal control systems during the period covered by this Annual Report. The details of the effectiveness review are described 
in the Corporate Governance Report on page 125 and the Audit & Risk Committee Report on page 143.

Meetings and Attendance
During the Period, the Committee held six meetings in 2023 and another two meetings in 2024. The Chairperson met regularly 
and individually with each of PwC, the Senior Director – GIA and the CFO. The Committee commenced its meetings with 
scheduled sessions in the absence of management for the Committee Members and PwC, as well as sessions for Committee 
Members only. Two private meetings between Committee Members and PwC were held and six sessions for Committee 
Members only were held during the Period.
Individual attendance of Members for the 2023 meetings is set out in the Corporate Governance Report on page 107.
EnergyAustralia
CLP’s wholly owned subsidiary, EnergyAustralia, has its own board of directors that includes independent non-executive 
directors. The EnergyAustralia board has an audit and risk committee (ARC) and its members are EnergyAustralia’s  
non-executive directors independent of EnergyAustralia’s management.
The Committee’s work with respect to the operations of EnergyAustralia is strengthened and supplemented by the work of 
EnergyAustralia ARC. There is an open invitation between this Committee and the EnergyAustralia ARC for members to attend 
the other committee’s meetings.
During the Period, the Chairperson of the Committee participated in six EnergyAustralia ARC meetings which included the 
additional meeting held in January 2024 for the consideration of key accounting judgement in relation to the impairment for 
the full-year financial statements of EnergyAustralia. The Chairman of EnergyAustralia ARC participated in five meetings of the 
Committee.
Highlights of the Committee’s Work
The Committee devoted considerable time in overseeing the financial reporting for the Group, reviewing the GIA reports and 
monitoring some of the material risks faced by the Group.
Members travelled to Australia to visit key facilities and met with local management team. This provided the Members the 
opportunity to better understand the challenges and risks faced by the team on the ground.
Led by the Committee Chairperson, there was a considerable amount of work in and outside of the Committee meetings on the 
impairment assessment work on the EnergyAustralia’s Customer business.

Audit & Risk Committee Report


Summary of Work Done 
In addition to the Highlights of the Committee’s Work for the Period, the table below explains the work carried out by the 
Committee and how it discharged its responsibilities for the Period.
Areas of Focus
Risk Management, Internal Control and Compliance
Effectiveness of risk 
management and internal 
control systems
The Committee received and reviewed management’s periodic internal control reports 
and the Group’s quarterly risk management reports. As part of the review of the half-year 
and full-year financial statements, the Committee examined and received the General 
Representation Letters from the CEO and CFO (see page 125 for further details regarding 
the General Representation Letters). 
The Committee’s monitoring of the risk management and internal control systems was 
supported by the review work and reporting by GIA and by the independent auditor’s 
report of their testing of the control environment of the Group. 
During the Period, no internal control issue that would be material to the integrity of the 
financial statements was identified.
The Committee analysed and was satisfied that the Group’s risk management and internal 
control systems were effective and adequate for the Period.
Deep dive briefings
Having regard to the nature of the risks and the potential exposure for the Group, 
management presented deep dive briefings on the following topics:
	 Cybersecurity – The Committee looked into the key Group cybersecurity initiatives and 
progress update including for EnergyAustralia and Apraava Energy. The Committee also 
examined the follow up actions that were being taken to address the matters from the 
risk management report.
	 ERP Project – The Committee discussed with management the status of the ERP project 
including its progress and financials, key messages on the project risks. The Committee 
also considered the independent assessments from both GIA team and external auditors 
and examined into the risk scenarios and mitigation measures.
	 Geopolitical risks – The Committee and management explored into the implications 
on the supply chain disruption under escalating geopolitical tensions. The assessment 
focused on four risk areas: physical supply risk, payment restriction, currency 
fluctuation and commodity price volatility. The Committee supported management’s 
assessment of the risks in this area and the continued work on this.
Reporting on risk 
management
The Committee recognised the challenging external environment that the Group continues 
to be faced and these would require close monitoring on the part of management. The 
Committee also expected that the ERP should be an area of focus from a risk reporting and 
management perspective.
Cybersecurity
Cybersecurity update briefings continued to be one of the regular deep dive topics for the 
Committee.
Compliance
As part of the review of the half-year and full-year financial statements, the Committee 
considered a comprehensive legal and regulatory report on the Group covering key 
regulatory compliance issues and legal cases for each region of the Group.
The Committee acknowledged that the only exception to compliance with all the mandatory  
disclosure requirements and principles, code provisions and recommended best practices 
of the Corporate Governance Code is that CLP does not publish quarterly financial results 
(as a recommended best practice); and the Committee supported the considered reasons 
for this exception (please refer to page 97).

CLP Holdings 2023 Annual Report


Areas of Focus
Annual and Interim Financial Reports
Annual Reports and  
Interim Report
The Committee reviewed the 2022 and 2023 Annual Reports and the 2023 Interim Report 
and on the recommendations from the Committee, these were approved by the Board.
2023 Financial Statements – 
accounting judgements 
Management and PwC presented to the Committee the key judgements with material 
accounting impact. These included the review of the carrying values of the Group’s 
generation assets and EnergyAustralia’s goodwill for the Customer business and the 
accounts receivables for the renewable projects in Mainland China.
The Committee critically assessed these and found the judgements put forward to be 
acceptable for each of the issues presented. The Committee evaluated with management 
the impairment assessment of EnergyAustralia’s Customer business and supported the 
approach with the preliminary assessment along with the issuance of the Group’s 2023 
financial performance based on the 2023 management accounts ahead of the formal 
results announcement.
ESG data assurance
The Committee considered and acknowledged the independent consultant’s report on the 
ESG data assurance in respect of the 2022 and 2023 identified ESG metrics disclosed in 
the Annual Report, Sustainability Report and CLP’s Climate Vision 2050. The Committee 
was briefed on the scope of the ESG data assurance with the selected ESG performance 
indicators and some of the key changes. 
 
Internal and External Auditing
Internal audit
The Committee received and considered two types of reports from the Senior Director – GIA 
and they are: 
a)	 audit reports which provide independent appraisal of the audit unit’s compliance with 
prescribed policies and procedures, and evaluation of the effectiveness of the overall 
controls; and 
b)	 special review reports which focus on new business areas and emerging risks, where 
control advisory is provided. 
GIA also conducted desktop review for selected lower risk audit units to enhance audit 
effectiveness and timeliness of communication with those units.
For the year 2023, a total of 19 audits, 13 special reviews and one desktop review were 
completed. One of the audit reports carried a not satisfactory audit opinion.
None of the control weaknesses identified had a material impact on the financial statements.
Internal audit function
The Committee reviewed the adequacy of resources, staff qualifications and experience, 
training programmes and budget of the GIA function as well as the accounting and financial 
reporting functions of the Group.
With Apraava Energy having become a joint venture and its governance structure having 
been set up, the Committee was satisfied that GIA would be invited to join the Apraava 
Energy Audit & Risk Committee meetings while the internal audit team of Apraava Energy 
would report to the Apraava Energy Audit & Risk Committee Chairman.
The Committee was also briefed by GIA on the ERP Project special review that they have 
conducted and this covered the objective, approach and the methodology of the special 
review. The Committee welcomed the findings and noted management’s positive response 
and follow up actions to these.
CLP Holdings 2023 Annual Report
144
Audit & Risk Committee Report


Areas of Focus
Internal and External Auditing
Financial Statements – 
auditor’s opinion
For both the 2022 and 2023 financial statements, PwC presented the auditor’s opinion 
on the financial statements and the Key Audit Matters that had material impacts on 
the financial results and position of the Group. The Key Audit Matters identified were 
considered and reviewed by the Committee.
Fees to independent auditor 
and its re-appointment
The Committee reviewed the following fees payable to PwC:
	 audit fees for 2022 and 2023 for approval by the Board; and
	 permissible audit related and non-audit services provided by PwC for 2022 and 2023.
The Committee Chairperson also reviewed and approved the additional fees relating to the 
PwC’s specific non-audit service engagement. The Committee also reviewed the proposed 
permissible audit related and non-audit services to be provided by the external auditor in 
the coming year.
At the 2023 AGM, over 99% of the shareholders voting supported the re-appointment of 
PwC and they were re-appointed as independent auditor for 2023.
Having considered PwC’s performance and independence as CLP’s independent auditor, the 
Committee recommended to the Board that PwC be re-appointed as independent auditor 
for 2024 and this will be considered by shareholders at the forthcoming AGM. PwC also 
issued a letter of independence to the Committee.
Ms Yee Shia Yuen has been the lead audit partner for CLP since the financial year 2021, 
after her predecessor retired from CLP’s audit assignments upon the completion of seven 
years of service after the 2020 financial year-end audit. This rotation is consistent with 
The International Federation of Accountants rules on independence of external auditors. 
The Committee supports this approach for it believes that changing the lead audit partner 
regularly ensures the independence, objectivity and fresh perspectives the Committee 
requires in CLP’s independent auditor.
Further details of the fees payable to PwC and the assessment of their independence can 
be found on page 121.
145
CLP Holdings 2023 Annual Report


Areas of Focus
Corporate Governance
Corporate governance 
practices
The Committee received a report on Corporate Governance Policies and Practices Review 
covering the implementation and effectiveness review of the shareholders’ communication 
policy, review of the Code of Conduct, whistleblowing policy, procedures on gifts and 
entertainment, anti-fraud policy and policy on making political contributions.
The Committee took particular note of the updates regarding the Consultation on 
Enhancement of Climate-related Disclosures under the Environmental, Social and 
Governance Framework of the Hong Kong Stock Exchange. The Committee also noted 
other topical Board-related issues such as the recent Board changes and Board diversity 
statistics, Board tenure and time commitment, and other observations on CLP’s corporate 
governance practices.
Continuing connected 
transactions
The Committee considered the work carried out by PwC on the annual reporting and 
confirmation of continuing connected transactions as required by the Listing Rules.
Culture-related
The Committee received and considered the periodic updates on the breaches of the 
Code of Conduct. None of the 17 breaches in 2023 were material to the Group’s financial 
statements or overall operations. The breaches were mainly related to issues of workplace 
behaviour and individuals’ ethics and integrity. None of the reported Code of Conduct 
violations involved employees at the grade level of senior manager or above.
The Committee analysed the findings of the 2022 ethics and controls commitment surveys 
for the employees and took note that the results for 2022 were positive and in general, 
were either at the same level or better than the results of the previous year.
Responsibilities
Primary Responsibilities
The Committee’s primary responsibilities include:
	 satisfying itself that good accounting, audit 
principles, risk management, internal controls and 
ethical practices are applied on a consistent basis 
throughout the CLP Group (without limiting the 
primary responsibilities of all the business unit 
managers throughout the Group);
	 assuring adequate risk management and internal 
control systems are in place and followed and where 
deficiencies are found, appropriate remedial actions 
are taken in a timely manner;
	 assuring appropriate accounting principles and 
reporting practices are followed;
	 performing the corporate governance duties 
described further in this Report and fulfilling the 
functions conferred on the Committee by the CLP 
Code;
	 satisfying itself that the scope and direction of 
external and internal auditing are adequate; and
	 reviewing and making sure the assurance of the 
sustainability data in the Sustainability Report is 
appropriate. 
Accountability
The Committee is accountable to the Board. The Chairperson 
reports to the Board at the Board meetings in which the 
half-year and full-year financial statements are considered 
and this would cover key issues considered by the 
Committee in the course of the review of the preparation 
of the financial statements.
Terms of Reference
The Committee’s terms of reference follow international 
best practice and they also comply with the HKICPA’s 
“A Guide for Effective Audit Committees” and the 
Corporate Governance Code. Full terms of reference can 
be found on CLP’s and the Hong Kong Stock Exchange’s 
websites.

Audit & Risk Committee Effectiveness
The Company Secretary evaluated the performance and effectiveness of the Committee during 2023 and the Committee was 
pleased to note that the Company Secretary concluded that the Committee was performing its responsibilities in an effective 
manner in accordance with its terms of reference.
The evaluation was reviewed and the conclusion was confirmed by internal and independent auditors. The CLP Holdings Board 
also endorsed the Company Secretary’s evaluation.
Looking Ahead
I wish to thank our immediate past Committee Chairman, Mr Nicholas Allen for his leadership on this Committee and with  
Mr Allen remaining as a Member, this has provided a smooth transition to the Committee’s leadership. I also wish to thank 
our retired Committee Member Mrs Fanny Law for her contributions to the Committee. For the many years of service on the 
Committee, she had always maintained the strict discipline of challenging management constructively and with wise counsel. 
Looking ahead, the external environment continues to be challenging and more complex, this requires management to remain 
vigilant in how we monitor, report and manage the risks. The Committee will strive to be effective in our oversight of the 
Group’s risks and also in providing the constructive challenge to management on matters that come under the purview of this 
Committee.

Summary of Work Done
In addition to the Highlights of the Committee’s Work for the Period, the table below explains the work carried out by the 
Committee and how it discharged its responsibilities for the Period.
Areas of Focus
Climate Change-related Matters
CLP’s Climate Vision 2050 
review and climate-related 
disclosures
 
The Committee examined and endorsed management’s proposal to strengthen CLP’s 2030 
near-term GHG intensity target from 0.3 to 0.26 kgCO2/kWh while maintaining the other 
CLP’s Climate Vision 2050 targets and commitments. The Committee considered such 
proposal in light of the Group’s specific business plan including (but not limited to) CLP Power’s 
Development Plan. The Committee also endorsed the proposed approach of enhancing the 
disclosures in these areas in the coming Annual Report and Sustainability Report. 
 
Climate change-related 
developments and risks

Looking Ahead
First of all, I wish to express my gratitude to the immediate past Committee Chair, Mr Richard Lancaster for his leadership of 
this Committee and the solid foundation that has been laid for this Committee under his guidance. I am extremely enthusiastic 
about my chairmanship at this Committee and equally excited about CLP’s work in this space.
The expectations regarding the Group’s climate action commitment have been growing and this will expand to the broader  
sustainability commitments. A key focus for the Committee for the year ahead will be the publication of CLP’s updated 
Climate Vision 2050 and how we engage with our stakeholders on this and to continue our work on the financial-related 
disclosures associated with the Group’s energy transition. In addition, the Committee will review and consider nature-related 
assessments and disclosures, considerations related to human rights, as well as sustainability in procurement. 
As the new Chair, I can see CLP and the Committee have made excellent progress in sustainability over the years and it is 
important that the good work on this should and must continue.

high performing individuals and promoting the enhancement of the value of the Company to its shareholders.

Human Resources & Remuneration Committee Report


	 Change of Remuneration – Executive Directors and Senior Management in 2023 (Audited)
Details of the remuneration of Executive Directors and Senior Management prepared in accordance with the Hong Kong 
Financial Reporting Standards for the 12 months ended 31 December 2023 are set out in the tables on page 164 (Executive 
Directors) and pages 171 and 172 (Senior Management).
The amounts disclosed consist of remuneration accrued or paid for service in 2023 and, for the annual and long-term 
incentives, service, and performance in previous years.
The amounts disclosed are the amounts recognised in the financial year for accounting purposes, which do not necessarily 
reflect the cash actually received by the individual. Where payments are made to the individual over more than one 
financial year, this is explained in the notes.
To provide a clear picture of remuneration, amounts are shown as recurring or non-recurring items. Recurring items are the 
normal annual remuneration of Executive Directors and Senior Management while non-recurring items relate primarily to 
the appointment or termination of Executive Directors and Senior Management.
In the tables on page 164 and pages 171 and 172 the “Total Remuneration” column for 2023 includes the following 
recurring items:
(i)	
base compensation, allowances & benefits paid;
(ii)	 2023 annual incentive accrued based on previous year’s Company performance and the 2022 annual incentive 
adjustment. The adjustment is the difference between the actual annual incentive paid in 2023 for 2022 performance 
and the annual incentive accrual for 2022;
(iii)	 the 2020 long-term incentive award paid in January 2023 when the vesting conditions were satisfied (the comparative 
figures are the long-term incentive for 2019 paid in 2022). Approximately 22% of the decrease in the value of the 
phantom shares portion of 2020 long-term incentive payments resulted from the change in CLP Holdings’ share price 
between 2020 and 2022, with dividends reinvested; and
(iv)	 provident fund contribution made.
Performance Outcomes for the Year
In considering performance outcomes against the balanced scorecard of measures set for the 2023 performance year,  
the Committee reviewed progress made against a mix of financial, operational, safety, environmental, internal control and 
objectives reflecting strategic priorities and long-term sustainability.
In 2023, the Committee considered the strong operating financial performance of the Group significantly above 2022’s results, 
together with material progress made in decarbonisation and strategy execution, improved operating performance and 
maintenance of a good safety, governance and control environment. Having considered these factors, the Committee decided to 
award a higher performance outcome than 2022.

Board as an Executive Director of the Company. His remuneration covered the full year from 1 January 2023 to 31 December 2023.
The Group does not have, and has never had, a share option scheme. No Executive Director has a service contract with 
the Company or any of its subsidiaries with a notice period in excess of six months or with provisions for predetermined 
compensation on termination which exceeds one year’s salary and benefits in kind.

Linking Senior Management Pay with CLP’s Purpose and Strategy
For the purposes of this section, Senior Management means the managers whose details are set out on pages 89 to 91.
CLP’s Senior Management Remuneration Policy is an important element of the Group’s strategy and an expression of our 
culture. Our Policy is designed to be sustainable, aligned with shareholders and simple. Delivery of a highly reliable supply  
of electricity today together with transforming our business to become better fit for a net-zero future is a commitment 
that requires long-term stewardship and a sustainable approach to remuneration. Ensuring fairness and internal equity; 
encouraging and rewarding appropriate behaviour while discouraging inappropriate behaviour; and balanced judgement of 
short- and long-term performance, aligned with shareholder outcomes, underpin this approach.
Fairness and internal equity are key elements of our approach. Depending on individual roles, Senior Management is 
responsible for a mix of businesses: a vertically integrated regulated business in Hong Kong, a customer-focused energy 
business in Australia, and an independent power producer in Mainland China, India, Taiwan Region and Thailand. We seek 
to fairly recognise the extent of Senior Management’s assigned job responsibilities and capabilities demonstrated, and to 
ensure that our remuneration attracts, retains, and motivates a diverse, high-performing executive team. The structure of our 
executive remuneration packages is assessed in terms of appropriateness to the role, and with reference to both local and 
international markets. We emphasise strong management development, succession planning and job mobility to fill vacancies 
for executive positions as we believe that a long-term career with the Group is an important asset to CLP. Consequently, 
external competitiveness of remuneration must be balanced with internal equity. While Senior Management pay reflects 
the scale and scope of their responsibilities, our policy is designed to ensure that remuneration structure and outcomes are 
aligned with our wider workforce, whose skills, values, and commitment are essential to our success, and HR&RC decisions on 
executive pay outcomes are taken in the context of wider workforce considerations.
Senior Management pay is structured to seek to avoid excessive risk-taking in the achievement of performance targets and is 
governed by and compliant with relevant regulatory frameworks. In determining incentive payments and total remuneration, 
the HR&RC considers and balances a broad range of performance indicators including financial (e.g., long-term growth in 
the share price and dividends), operational, safety, environmental, social, business sustainability (including responding to 
climate change), governance and compliance-related factors linked to CLP’s strategy. Decisions on pay reflect considerations 
of both what was achieved and how it was achieved. The determination of performance outcomes is not formulaic, as the 
HR&RC believes that their overriding responsibility is to exercise judgement and responsibility, ensuring alignment between 
shareholders and management.
165
CLP Holdings 2023 Annual Report


CLP is committed to being simple and transparent in the way we do business. The HR&RC strives to keep remuneration 
arrangements simple, clear, and consistent to enable effective stakeholder scrutiny. We have maintained our Remuneration 
Policy in line with prior years in part on the belief that the current arrangements remain fit for purpose, are embedded into 
our business and are well-understood both internally and externally. Mindful of continuing external interest and debate on 
executive pay, we have reshaped the structure of our reporting on Remuneration Policy in order that the links between policy, 
strategy and performance are more clearly and simply articulated.

Executive Directors and Senior Management (excluding Managing Director – EnergyAustralia)
The illustration below summarises policy design and operation for members of Senior Management. The policy is set out in full

Human Resources & Remuneration Committee Report


Base Salary
Purpose and link to strategy
To attract, motivate and retain capable Executives needed to lead and sustain a 
multi-jurisdictional business in a complex operating environment, without  
over-paying.
Operation
Base salaries are reviewed annually considering market data (including base 
pay and total remuneration opportunity for both local and international peer-
group comparators, supplemented where necessary by peer data from published 
remuneration surveys) and the scope and responsibility of the role, including any 
changes in responsibility, individual skills, and experience. Changes are usually 
effective from 1 April each year.
Maximum opportunity and alignment 
with wider workforce
Ordinarily, base salary increases in percentage terms will be in line with, or less 
than, increases awarded to other CLP employees. Increases may be made above 
this level for circumstances such as a significant change in responsibility or 
progression due to recent appointment. The HR&RC’s intention is to align total 
remuneration between the median and upper quartile of the reference market.
Performance measures
Not applicable.
Annual Incentive
Purpose and link to strategy
To drive performance aligned to short- and long-term value creation considering 
both what was achieved and how it was achieved for the Senior Management, 
while seeking to avoid excessive risk-taking in the achievement of performance 
targets.
Operation
AIP awards are determined by the HR&RC’s assessment of organisational 
performance over each financial year. Awards are paid in cash in March following 
the relevant performance year. AIP awards for the CEO and Hong Kong based 
members of Senior Management are based on the performance of the CLP Group.
Maximum opportunity and alignment 
with wider workforce
Each member of Senior Management has a maximum annual incentive 
opportunity of 100% of base salary. Half of the maximum is payable for target 
performance. The maximum annual incentive opportunity may be exceeded in 
exceptional cases where a discretionary additional annual incentive is awarded 
by the HR&RC. All employees are eligible to participate in the AIP with target AIP 
percentage calculated as a percentage of base salary.

CLP Holdings 2023 Annual Report


Annual Incentive
Performance measures
In assessing organisational performance, the HR&RC considers a balanced 
scorecard of measures. Given the scale and complexity of our business operations, 
there are many such measures, including both quantitative and qualitative 
factors. There is not a formulaic mathematical determination of performance, 
rather it is a balanced judgement by the HR&RC taking all relevant factors into 
account. In reaching their decision, the HR&RC considers:
WHAT was achieved
	 Financial and Operational performance: Operating EPS, Operating Earnings, 
Return on Equity, Asset Performance and Customer Minutes Lost
HOW it was achieved
	 Safety performance: Fatalities, Lost Time Injury and Total Recordable Injury 
Rates
	 Climate risk stewardship: progress in meeting science-based greenhouse gas 
emissions intensity targets and phasing out coal-based assets, as set out in 
CLP’s updated Climate Vision 2050 
	 Stewardship of other sustainability risks including the social and economic 
impacts of energy transition, health and wellbeing, and diversity and inclusion
	 Internal Control: number of Not Satisfactory Audits and Code of Conduct cases
ADDITIONAL OBJECTIVES reflecting strategic priorities and long-term 
sustainability of the organisation in relation to five dimensions: customer and 
community engagement, business model, asset development, digitalisation, and 
culture and ways of working.
Long-Term Incentive
Purpose and link to strategy
To drive long-term business value creation, aligning Senior Management 
incentives to key strategic objectives, support Senior Management retention and 
to encourage an owner’s mindset.
Operation
LTI awards are based on the target LTI opportunity (50% of the maximum 
opportunity) set at the beginning of the year, multiplied by the organisational 
performance score for the preceding year. A minimum of 75% of the award is 
allocated to CLP Holdings phantom shares based on the average closing share 
price for the December prior to the making of the LTI award. At the individual’s 
choice, up to 25% of the award can be allocated to either a notional cash deposit 
or to CLP Holdings phantom shares. Payment is subject to a three-year vesting 
period.
Maximum opportunity and alignment 
with wider workforce
Each member of Senior Management has a maximum LTI opportunity of 66.6% of 
base salary. The final value of the award at the vesting date is determined based 
on initial allocation choices made and the subsequent impact of changes in share 
price, dividend reinvestment, exchange rate movements and interest earned 
over the three-year vesting period. Participation in the LTI Plan applies to Senior 
Management and other senior roles.
Performance measures
As per the AIP.

attraction and retention.
Operation
The Group Provident Fund Scheme is a Defined Contribution scheme which all 
members of Senior Management and Hong Kong based employees are eligible to 
join.
Employer contributions to the retirement fund range from 10-17.5% of Base 
Salary plus target annual incentive.
Maximum opportunity and alignment 
with wider workforce

Managing Director – EnergyAustralia
Base Salary
Purpose and link to strategy
To reflect responsibility and complexity of the role, the skills and experience 
of the individual and to support the attraction and retention of Executives to 
develop and deliver our strategy.
Operation
Fixed Annual Remuneration (FAR) includes base salary and employer contribution 
to the Australian statutory superannuation scheme. FAR is reviewed annually 
taking into consideration the competitive market position compared to peer 
companies, a range of listed companies with market capitalisation of 50% to 
200% of EnergyAustralia’s notional market capitalisation, market practice 
and individual performance. FAR accounted for 29% of Managing Director – 
EnergyAustralia (MD-EA)’s potential total remuneration in 2023.
Maximum opportunity and alignment 
with wider workforce
Ordinarily, FAR increases in percentage terms will be in line with or less than 
increases awarded to other EnergyAustralia employees.
Performance measures
Not applicable.
169
CLP Holdings 2023 Annual Report


Short-Term Incentive
Purpose and link to strategy
To reward individuals’ performance based upon achievement of annual financial 
and operational targets which are linked to EnergyAustralia’s strategy. This 
ensures that total remuneration received is consistent with organisation 
performance for which management can be held to account. Deferral of 
incentives facilitates clawback.
Operation
The EnergyAustralia Board determines the level of incentive at its absolute 
discretion considering key financial, operational, and strategic performance 
indicators.
Performance is assessed over a financial year. The actual payout of Mr Collette’s 
annual incentive is approved by the Board of EnergyAustralia. 50% of the  
short-term Incentive (STI) award is paid in cash annually, with 50% deferred for 
one year.
Maximum opportunity and alignment 
with wider workforce
Maximum annual incentive opportunity is 150% of FAR which accounted for 43% 
of MD-EA’s potential total remuneration in 2023. 100% of FAR is payable for 
on-target performance. All salaried employees are eligible to participate in the STI 
with target percentage calculated as a percentage of FAR.
Performance measures
STI awards are based on a mix of the corporate scorecard and specific Managing 
Director-level objectives related to the strategic performance of business. 60% of 
the STI is based on corporate performance and 40% on priorities set for the 
business.
Long-Term Incentive
Purpose and link to strategy
To drive long-term business performance aligning Senior Management 
incentives to key strategic objectives and to achieve long-term value creation for 
shareholders.
Operation
LTI awards are based on performance over a three-year performance period.  
The EnergyAustralia Board determines the final value of LTI awards depending on 
the achievement of the LTI Performance Conditions.
Upon determination of the Final Award Value, 100% of that value (subject to the 
discretion of the Nomination and Remuneration Committee of EnergyAustralia) 
will be paid on the vesting date in the fourth year.
Maximum opportunity and alignment 
with wider workforce
Maximum LTI opportunity is equal to 100% of FAR which accounted for 28%  
of MD-EA’s potential total remuneration in 2023. 50% of FAR is payable for 
on-target performance. The final value of the award at the vesting date is based 
on the subsequent impact of changes in share price. Participation in the LTI Plan 
applies to senior and selected other roles.
Performance measures
The LTI award is decided by the EnergyAustralia Board, depending on the 
achievement of LTI Performance Conditions.

	 Senior Management – Remuneration in 2023 (Audited)
CLP undertook a review of its Senior Management disclosure in 2023 and has adjusted the roles considered and disclosed 
as Senior Management in line with its operating model. In addition, Apraava Energy is now accounted for as a joint 
venture, hence the role of Managing Director – Apraava Energy is no longer considered and disclosed as CLP Holdings 
Senior Management. As a result, the disclosure for Senior Management for 2022 in the table is revised accordingly. To 
align with broader market practice, CLP also introduced extended disclosure of Group Executive Committee Members and 
the attendee to enhance the transparency of its broader leadership team. Details of the Members of the Group Executive 
Committee are set out on pages 90 and 91.
Details of the remuneration of the Senior Management are set out below (except for the Executive Directors, that are set

Business Review and Performance
Directors’ Report
CLP Holdings 2023 Annual Report
174


The following is a statement from the Board of Directors 
explaining the Board’s oversight of sustainability-related 
issues and how CLP approaches the management of 
sustainability-related issues.
Governance structure
The CLP Board is ultimately responsible for CLP’s 
sustainability-related issues, and governance of sustainability 
is integrated into our corporate governance structure 
across the Group. The Sustainability Committee is primarily 
responsible for managing the sustainability issues within 
the Group. It places a high priority on climate change 
developments and our own climate action, with a particular 
emphasis on the impact of longer-term sustainability 
issues on the Group’s business strategy. The Sustainability 
Committee, as a Board Committee, is supported by the 
Sustainability Executive Committee and coordinated through 
the Group Sustainability Department. The Audit & Risk 
Committee continues to oversee monitoring of significant 
sustainability-related risks and the assurance process of ESG 
data. For further details on the governance structure, please 
refer to page 98 of the Corporate Governance Report on 
“CLP’s Approach to Sustainability Reporting”.
How does CLP approach and manage material sustainability-
related issues?
CLP regularly reviews its strategic priorities against 
sustainability risks and opportunities to ensure they remain 
appropriate. The first post-pandemic year, 2023 saw a slow 
but steady recovery from the shocks of COVID-19. However, 
uncertainty persisted in the shape of an indeterminate 
economic future, complex international trade relationships, 
and geopolitical unrest in the Middle East and Ukraine. These 
incidents show that ESG concerns are dynamic and can have 
immediate as well as long-term effects. They also highlight the 
significance of conducting regular assessments of strategic 
priorities.
In 2023, CLP made efforts to provide a more detailed 
description of its sustainability-related impacts, risks and 
opportunities (IROs) with reference to IFRS S1 – General 
Requirements for Disclosure of Sustainability-related Financial 
Information which was published in June 2023. In addition, 
CLP has improved its strategy for handling IROs by adding 
a clear time horizon and outlining the position of the IROs 
in the value chain. This enables CLP to fully respond to the 
needs of stakeholders, better reflect sustainability risks and 
opportunities in its business strategy and enable enhanced 
transparency in reporting. Furthermore, there has been a 
closer integration between the processes of risk management 
and materiality assessment. The sustainability priorities which 
are determined through the comprehensive annual materiality 
assessment process, have been taken into account in CLP’s risk 
management process. The materiality results were categorised 
as:
	 Financially material priorities, which could reasonably 
be expected to affect the Group’s cash flows, access 
to finance or cost of capital in the short, medium and 
Board’s Statement on Sustainability
long term, as per the IFRS S1 standard, are covered 
in this Annual Report and are for reporting purposes 
our response to the ESG Reporting Guide. Information 
is material if omitting, misstating or obscuring it could 
reasonably be expected to influence investment decisions. 
The key audience is providers of financial capital.
	 Impact material priorities, which reflect significant positive 
or negative impacts on people, the environment and the 
economy, are covered in the Sustainability Report. They 
address the concerns of a diverse range of stakeholders, 
including customers, people, partners and community, who 
are interested in CLP’s positive and negative contributions to 
sustainable development. 
As part of Year 3 in CLP’s three-year materiality assessment 
cycle, CLP’s Senior Management was interviewed to obtain 
collated views on the business outlook and challenges in 
operations. Further, the sustainability IROs were identified 
and assessed against megatrends analysis, CLP’s top tier risk 
list and broader CLP strategy. The materiality results were 
presented first to the Sustainability Executive Committee 
and then to the Sustainability Committee for their review 
and endorsement. In addition, CLP appointed for the first 
time a non-financial auditor to perform limited assurance 
over its materiality assessment process in accordance with 
the International Standard on Assurance Engagements 
(ISAE) 3000 (Revised), Assurance Engagements Other Than 
Audits or Reviews of Historical Financial Information. Further 
details of the materiality assessment process can be found in 
Delivering Our Sustainability Agenda – Overview on page 42.
The sustainability IROs have been grouped under six 
sustainability priorities which are: (i) transition to net zero; 
(ii) energy growth opportunities; (iii) energy security and 
reliability; (iv) a safe, future-ready workforce; (v) business 
resilience; and (vi) community stewardship. For further 
details on how sustainability priorities are addressed by 
the Sustainability Committee, please see the Sustainability 
Committee Report on page 148.
CLP’s Climate Vision 2050
Climate change continues to be one of the top sustainability 
priorities for CLP. Following the 2021 review of its 
decarbonisation targets and climate commitments under 
CLP’s Climate Vision 2050, CLP now has strengthened further 
its targets in view of latest developments in climate science 
and the policy landscape. The updated targets and the 
detailed transition plan are detailed in CLP’s Climate Vision 
2050 (2024 edition). The transition plan will be updated 
every three years and annual updates on key metrics will be 
included in the Annual Report. Preparation of CLP’s updated  
Climate Vision 2050 has made reference to IFRS S2 – 
Climate-related Disclosures. 
The Board recognises that climate change is one of the most 
material risks to CLP’s business and will continue to provide 
oversight to ensure that the Group acts in a responsible 
manner and will be able to pursue the opportunities that may 
arise from the energy transition.

suppliers, in aggregate, accounted for 58.24% of the Group’s 
total purchases during the year and a breakdown of the 
purchases (as a percentage of the Group’s total purchases) 
from each of the five largest suppliers are set out below in 
descending order:
1	 15.07% from Australian Energy Market Operator (AEMO) 
in which the Group has no economic interest. AEMO is 
the administrator and operator of the Australian energy 
market, from whom electricity is bought to supply 
EnergyAustralia group customers and to whom electricity 
is sold from EnergyAustralia group generators (as market 
participants, EnergyAustralia group entities are members 
of AEMO but do not hold any economic interest in AEMO).
2	 13.00% from PetroChina International South China Co., 
Ltd. (PCISC) in which the Group has no interest. CAPCO 
purchases natural gas from PCISC for its electricity 
generation.
3	 12.84% from Guangdong Nuclear Power Joint Venture 
Company, Limited (GNPJVC) which is 25% owned by the 
Group. GNPJVC owns Guangdong Daya Bay Nuclear Power 
Station (GNPS), and CLP Power, a wholly owned subsidiary 
of the Company and the largest electricity supplier in 
Hong Kong, purchases 80% of GNPS’s output for supply of 
electricity to its customers in Hong Kong.
4	 12.14% from CNOOC China Limited (CNOOC) in which the 
Group has no interest. CAPCO purchases natural gas from 
CNOOC for its electricity generation.
5	 5.19% from Ausgrid Operator Partnership (Ausgrid) in 
which the Group has no interest. EnergyAustralia pays the 
distribution charges to Ausgrid which owns and operates 
the electricity distribution network that provides services 
to customers located in Sydney, the Central Coast and 
Hunter regions of New South Wales.
As at 31 December 2023, none of the Directors, their close 
associates or substantial shareholders of the Company had 
any interest in those suppliers other than their indirect 
interests in GNPJVC, which interests arose from the Group’s 
interest in GNPJVC and the Group’s approximate 0.28% 
shareholding interest in CGN Power Co., Ltd. (the listed entity 
of which GNPJVC is a subsidiary).

CLP Power.
For the energy transfer settled by cash payment, it 
is based on the number of kWh sold multiplied by 
an arm’s length tariff (unit rate of energy transfer) 
agreed between the parties. In addition, under the 
standby capacity support, the consideration settled 
by cash payment is based on the capacity (MW) and 
hours requested to standby multiplied by an arm’s 
length tariff (standby charges) agreed between the 
parties. The unit rate of energy transfer and standby 
charges are determined after taking into account the 
available market information and the relevant cost.

The objective of financial statements is to communicate the Group’s financial information to our 
stakeholders, especially shareholders, investors and lenders, for making economic decisions. To achieve 
this objective, it is always our aim to present the financial information of CLP as clearly and concisely 
as possible. This overview helps you understand how information is organised and presented in our 
financial statements. Hopefully, this will bring you a more insightful reading experience. 
Accounting Mini-series
We believe that understanding financial 
statements is a right, not a privilege. To help 
those unfamiliar with accounting terms read 
our financial statements, we have developed 
an Accounting Mini-series to explain topical 
and difficult accounting concepts in a way that 
is easier to understand. A number of topics 
have been discussed since 2007, the content of 
which can be found in our website.

Critical Accounting Estimates and Judgements
Management makes judgements and estimates in preparing the 
financial statements, some of which will have a significant effect 
on the reported results and financial position. HKAS 1 specifies 
that an entity shall disclose (1) the key judgements that have 
the most significant effect on amounts recognised; and (2) the 
assumptions and other sources of estimation uncertainty at 
period end that have a significant risk of material adjustment 
to the carrying amounts of assets or liabilities within the next 
financial year. You should pay attention to our disclosures under 
“critical accounting estimates and judgements” which help you 
assess CLP’s financial position and performance and understand 
the sensitivities to changes in assumptions.
Look for gold boxes
Material Accounting Policies
Financial statements are prepared in 
accordance with Hong Kong Financial 
Reporting Standards (HKFRS).  You do not 
need to be familiar with all the requirements 
of HKFRS because the accounting policies 
which are material and relevant to the Group 
are disclosed in the financial statements. 
The disclosures include specific principles 
and procedures selected and applied by 
management in preparing the financial 
statements, as well as the methods, 
measurement basis and procedures to account 
for the transactions.

Approaching Our Financial Statements


In today’s business landscape, it is common for corporations to expand their interests by 
exploring new business opportunities and avenues. This expansion typically involves establishing 
new entities or investing in existing ones, aiming to foster business growth and seize emerging opportunities. Besides  
traditional investment methods such as controlling subsidiaries, influential associates, and passive equity interest investments, 
corporations often opt for joint arrangements to collectively pursue mutual business goals.
In the following section, we will provide a concise overview of joint arrangements, examine their merits and drawbacks, delve 
into the accounting classification of different joint arrangements - joint ventures and joint operations, explore their pertinent 
accounting implications, and use CLP Group’s case studies to illustrate these points.
What is a joint arrangement?
A joint arrangement represents a contractual agreement 
between two or more parties collaborating on specific 
economic activities or projects. This arrangement is especially 
prevalent in industries demanding substantial capital 
investment, such as the energy and utilities sector, where  
CLP Group operates.
From an accounting perspective, a defining characteristic  
of a joint arrangement is the exercise of joint control by the  
involved parties. The joint control is typically established 
through contractual agreements or other formal arrangements. 
Joint control implies that decisions significantly affecting 
the returns of the invested entity necessitate unanimous 
agreement from all controlling parties involved. These 
distinctive elements set joint arrangements apart from other 
collaborative forms involving multiple investors.
Why establish a joint arrangement?
To achieve specific commercial goals and optimise the risk and return profile of an investment, investors should understand 
the pros and cons of the form of investment. The following outline several significant advantages and disadvantages related to 
joint arrangements:
The success of a joint arrangement relies on thorough planning, clear terms and conditions, effective communication, and alignment 
of goals and expectations among Partners. Whether or not to utilise a joint arrangement requires a thorough examination of all 
relevant factors, including the benefits and costs. This determination should be made on a case-by-case basis.
Risk Sharing
Financial and operational risks are shared among the joint 
arrangement partners (“Partners”), thereby lessening individual 
exposure to financial burdens without full commitment.
Resource and Expertise Sharing
Enriching the overall capabilities as Partners contribute 
complementary resources, skills and expertise.
Cost Efficiency
Enable cost and resource sharing, operational efficiency 
improvements, and achieving economies of scale, resulting in 
cost savings.
Market Entry and Expansion
Easier access to new markets and allow diversification into new 
industries or sectors by leveraging local Partners’ knowledge 
and relationships.
Specialisation
Higher-quality outcomes, especially for entities within vertically 
integrated value chains as Partners can focus on their areas of 
specialisation.
Shared Control
Decision-making often requires consensus, potentially resulting in 
disputes or delayed responses to market changes.
Potential Conflicts of Interest
Partners might possess conflicting objectives or interests, 
straining the relationship within the joint arrangement.
Limited Autonomy
The autonomy of each Partner in their respective areas of 
expertise may be limited.
Profit Sharing
The division of profits may not always align with each Partner’s 
contributions or expectations.
Exit Challenges
Exiting a joint arrangement can be complex, typically necessitating 
consensus from all or a significant majority of the Partners involved.
Intellectual Property Concerns
Protecting intellectual property contributed to the joint 
arrangement can be challenging when shared among Partners.

Joint venture 
Joint operation 
How does the accounting standard prescribe joint arrangements?
Joint arrangements are prescribed by HKFRS 11, they are classified into two distinct types and with very different accounting 
treatments.
One line share of 
results on profit 
or loss and share 
of net assets on 
statement of 
financial position
Ring-fencing 
structure
A separate legal entity?
The legal and contractual framework
Additional facts and circumstances
The structure of the joint arrangement
The direct allocation of rights (assets) and 
obligations (liabilities) through the legal 
framework or contractual terms 
significantly impacts the classification. In 
certain circumstances, if the Partners use 
the contractual arrangement to reverse or 
modify the rights and obligations inherent by 
the distinct legal form of the investee, 
resulting in each Partner having a specific 
stake in its assets and liabilities, instead of 
sharing the overall net assets, this could lead 
to a lack of distinct separation between the 
Partners and the investee. The modification 
may result in the arrangement being 
classified as a joint operation.
When a separate legal entity exists with a clear 
segregation of assets and liabilities between 
the Partners and the investee, other factors 
come into consideration. These factors include 
examining the investee’s outputs sold, its 
ability to sell to external parties beyond the 
Partners involved, pricing agreements 
between Partners and the investee, and the 
investee’s business model. The purpose of 
considering these is to determine if, even 
though the legal structure and contractual 
agreement suggest that the arrangement is a 
joint venture, are there any additional facts 
and circumstances that grant the Partners the 
majority of the economic benefits associated 
with the investee or make the investee reliant 
on the Partners for continuously settling its 
obligations which might impact the 
classification. 
Direct allocation of 
assets and liabilities?
Whether it’s established through 
a separate legal entity, plays a pivotal 
role in its classification. 
It is an initial indication that the joint 
arrangement might be a joint venture.  
If there’s no distinct legal entity, it won’t 
qualify as a joint venture and automatically 
falls into the joint operation classification 
given joint control exists. However, if there 
exists a separate legal entity, a thorough 
assessment is necessary to determine 
whether it qualifies as a joint venture 
or joint operation.
A joint venture typically involves the formation of a distinct legal entity, with each party holding an 
ownership interest. The Partner uses the equity method to account for its investment in a joint venture.
If an investment is qualified as a joint venture, its financial performance and position will not undergo 
detailed (line-by-line) consolidation in the Partner’s financial statements. Instead, its performance is 
reported under the share of the result of the joint venture while its position is included under interests in 
the joint venture in the primary statements as if a one-line consolidation. This exemplifies the application 
of the equity accounting method employed for the joint venture arrangement by sharing net return, and 
net assets or liabilities.
One of the key features of a joint venture would be the ring-fencing. The joint venture occurs through the 
establishment of a distinct legal entity, that exemplifies a ring-fencing structure, delineating asset ownership 
and liability obligations of the Partners from the joint venture, shielding the Partners from undue financial 
obligations beyond their investments. It is a protective measure to mitigate risks and ensure transparency and 
accountability within the joint venture structure. Should the joint venture incur any debts or legal obligations, 
the Partners typically hold no responsibility beyond their respective investments. 
Moreover, joint venture structure helps promote transparency and clarity in operations by establishing 
distinct management teams and staff dedicated to its functioning. It ensures a clear delineation of 
responsibilities, decision-making processes, allocation of resources and prevents conflicts of interest, and 
facilitates effective governance. 
Overall, joint venture structure helps protect the interests of Partners, providing a clear framework for 
operations while safeguarding assets and limiting liabilities.
A joint operation is a contractual arrangement in which the parties involved agree to manage specific 
activities or projects jointly, sharing the assets, liabilities, revenues, and expenses without forming 
a distinct legal entity. In a joint operation, each party retains control over their designated areas of 
responsibility, assets and liabilities, sharing returns based on the predetermined framework. 
Under joint operation, each Partner recognises in its financial statements the assets, liabilities, revenues,  
and expenses shared from the joint operation according to the sharing mechanism sets out in the joint 
arrangement and complies with all relevant accounting standards. This accounting method combines 
the financial statements of the Partner with its share of the joint operation’s details line-by-line.
In essence, joint operations enable Partners to collaborate towards achieving specific shared objectives 
in a project manner. 
Identification of a joint arrangement
The differentiation between a joint venture and a joint operation primarily involves examining specific features as below. 
Thoroughly assessing these criteria helps differentiate between joint ventures and joint operations, as the classification 
significantly influences financial disclosures and their associated implications.

Other implications
Joint arrangements are common to the modern business environment, each classification carrying distinct accounting 
implications. These require readers of the financial statements to gain a comprehensive understanding from a thorough 
review, including the accompanying notes. Accounting standards serve as guardians, managing the classification of these 
arrangements and ensuring transparent and clear financial information for stakeholders’ informed assessments.
Applications in CLP Group
The table below lists out various joint arrangements entered into by CLP Group:
Type of  joint
arrangement 
Benefits of the joint arrangement
Cost and risk sharing 
The arrangement offers the Partners the 
advantage of cost and risk sharing, 
particularly as the development, 
construction, and operation of an offshore 
LNG terminal are new scopes of business 
for both Partners. By entering this joint 
arrangement via forming a joint venture, 
the Partners effectively distribute risks and 
resources, working together to achieve 
their shared objective of utilising LNG for 
their respective electricity generation 
needs.
Hong Kong Offshore LNG Terminal 
Hong Kong LNG Terminal Limited is a 
collaborative effort between CLP Group 
and The Hongkong Electric Co., Ltd (“HK 
Electric”) which went into operation in 
2023. The entity is responsible for the 
development, ownership, and operation 
of an offshore LNG terminal within Hong 
Kong, providing LNG regasification 
services and related facilities to CLP 
Group and HK Electric.
Support Hong Kong’s 
energy development 
and bolster the 
region’s fuel supply 
stability through the 
introduction of a new 
natural gas supply 
source.
Market expansion 
The completed transaction strengthens 
Apraava Energy’s foundation to explore

Resources and expertise sharing
This collaboration showcases the primary 
advantages of a joint arrangement, 
emphasising the sharing of resources and 
expertise to achieve mutual objectives. CLP 
Group provided the strategic land location, 
while Sino Land contributed extensive 
knowledge and expertise in property 
development, together with the cost for 
redevelopment. Through this collaborative 
effort, they delivered a distinctive property 
project catering to market demands.

Business & Background 
Purpose 
Joint
Venture 
Joint
Operation
Classifying a joint arrangement as a joint venture necessitates employing equity accounting methods, 
resulting in a more concise presentation of the joint venture’s financial performance and position in 
the financial statements. Could this compromise transparency or affect the clarity for stakeholders?
In some instances, establishing a joint venture might be perceived as a strategic move to optimise 
the financial statements by transferring both assets and more importantly, the liabilities to the joint 
venture, potentially improving critical financial metrics. 
Nevertheless, accounting standards ensure sufficient and appropriate disclosure catering to the 
stakeholders, by mandating summarised financial data for significant joint ventures, an overview of 
financial data for less significant ones, and their related commitments and contingent liabilities in the 
accompanying notes. These requirements aim to provide readers with a comprehensive perspective, 
facilitating their decision-making process.

Key Audit Matters
Key Audit Matters are those matters that, in our professional judgement, were of most significance in our audit of the Group 
Financial Statements of the current period. These matters were addressed in the context of our audit of the Group Financial 
Statements as a whole, and in forming our opinion thereon, and we do not provide a separate opinion on these matters.
Key audit matters identified in our audit are summarised as follows:
	 Unbilled retail revenue;
	 The carrying values of EnergyAustralia’s energy retail business and generation assets;
	 Fixed asset accounting and the calculation of the Scheme of Control permitted return;
	 Recoverability of trade receivables; and
	 Asset retirement obligations (AROs).

How our audit addressed the Key Audit Matter
 
 
Unbilled retail revenue
Refer to note 3 to the Group Financial Statements
Retail electricity and gas revenues are recognised when 
electricity and gas are supplied to and consumed by the 
customers. Revenues are measured on the basis of periodic 
cycle meter readings and include an estimated accrual for 
the value of electricity and gas consumed from the meter 
reading date to the end of the reporting period. Unbilled 
retail revenue of the Group totalled HK$4,001 million as at 
31 December 2023.
CLP Power Hong Kong Limited (CLP Power) calculates 
unbilled revenue using estimates including: consumption 
quantity based on the electricity sent-out adjusted by 
loss factors, the pattern of residential and non-residential 
consumption, weather and certain other factors.
EnergyAustralia Holdings Limited (EnergyAustralia) 
calculates unbilled retail revenue based on the electricity 
purchased and the applicable tariffs for the mass market 
customer segment, as well as the actual meter readings 
and the contracted rates for commercial and industrial 
customers. The amount is adjusted for physical energy loss 
and other measurable factors.
This is a Key Audit Matter because the calculation of unbilled 
retail revenue involves a high degree of estimation.
Our procedures in relation to unbilled revenue included:
	 Understanding of and testing the key controls in place to 
determine the estimate of unbilled revenue for both CLP 
Power and EnergyAustralia;
	 Testing the volume of electricity sent-out by CLP Power to 
supporting information;
	 Assessing the reasonableness of estimates by comparing 
them against historical trends;
	 Testing the volume of electricity purchased by 
EnergyAustralia from the wholesale electricity market to 
the underlying Australian Energy Market Operator invoices 
on a sample basis and reconciling the total purchase 
volumes to revenue volumes; and
	 Understanding the estimates made relating to loss factors 
and tariffs used in determining the level of unbilled 
revenue for both CLP Power and EnergyAustralia and 
assessing their reasonableness by comparing them against 
historical trends and against the weighted average tariff 
for prices.
Based on the work performed, we found that the Group’s 
unbilled revenue amount is supported by the available 
evidence.

The carrying values of EnergyAustralia’s energy retail 
business and generation assets
Refer to notes 10 and 13 to the Group Financial Statements
EnergyAustralia has goodwill relating to the energy retail 
business in Australia.
The Australian energy retail business has experienced 
inflation and higher interest rates, which have led to 
EnergyAustralia’s energy retail business experiencing 
increased operating costs, intensified competition and 
decreased operating margins.
The recoverable amount of EnergyAustralia’s energy retail 
business is determined based on a value in use calculation, 
which did not support the carrying value. As a result the 
Group has taken a goodwill impairment charge of HK$5,868 
million during the financial year ended 31 December 
2023. Post impairment, the management consider that 
the carrying value of assets in the energy retail business 
(including remaining goodwill balance) of HK$8,086 million 
remains supported.
The cash flow projections used in the value in use calculation 
are derived from EnergyAustralia’s approved business plan 
which includes cost saving initiatives and an appropriate 
reflection of future cash flows from potential legislative, 
regulatory and structural changes in the industry.
The key assumptions used in the value in use calculation 
include retail tariffs, electricity and gas volumes, network 
distribution costs, the customer account growth rate and 
the discount rate.
This is a Key Audit Matter, because of the inputs to the value 
in use model require significant management judgements 
and a high degree of estimation. Changes in these key 
assumptions would have a direct impact on the valuation 
and resulting impairment charge.
Our procedures in relation to management’s assessment of 
the carrying value of EnergyAustralia’s energy retail business 
included:
	 Assessing the appropriateness of the valuation 
methodologies used in the assessment of the recoverable 
amount;
	 Reconciling input data to supporting evidence, such as the 
approved business plan and where possible to publicly 
available market data;
	 Challenging the reasonableness of the key assumptions 
based on our knowledge of the business and industry;
	 Assessing the discount rate used in the assessment which 
has included the involvement of in-house valuation experts 
where appropriate;
	 Verifying the integrity of formulae and mathematical 
accuracy of management’s valuation model;
	 Assessing the potential impact of reasonably possible 
changes in key assumptions including possible future 
regulatory policy changes with respect to retail sales of 
electricity in Australia; and
	 Reviewing the appropriateness of the Group’s disclosures 
with respect to the impairment assessment.
Based on the work performed we found the impairment 
charge recorded for the year and the 31 December 2023 
carrying value of EnergyAustralia’s energy retail business is 
supported by the available evidence and the key assumptions 
have been appropriately disclosed in note 13 to the Group 
Financial Statements.

The carrying values of EnergyAustralia’s energy retail 
business and generation assets (continued)
The Group has substantial investments in assets of HK$13.3 
billion related to EnergyAustralia’s generation business. 
They are tested for impairment whenever events or changes 
in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be 
recoverable.
The carrying value of EnergyAustralia’s generation assets 
are supported by scenarios which are produced to reflect 
a range of economic conditions that may exist over the life 
of the assets and the expected power plant closure dates. 
The key assumptions included within the scenarios include 
an estimation of forward electricity pool prices (the forward 
curve), generation volumes, retail volumes, gas prices, long 
term assumptions around market movements, potential 
regulatory changes including those impacting the timing of 
national power plant closure dates and the impact to the 
useful lives of the EnergyAustralia’s generation assets.
Management has performed an assessment and confirmed 
that no impairment was required for EnergyAustralia’s 
generation assets at 31 December 2023.
This is a Key Audit Matter because critical judgements exist 
in estimating forward electricity pool prices, volumes, gas 
prices and long term market assumptions.
Our procedures in relation to management’s assessment of 
the carrying value of EnergyAustralia’s generation assets 
included:
	 Discussing EnergyAustralia’s generation assets scenarios 
with management and understanding the key assumptions 
included within them;
	 Assessing the appropriateness of movements in the 
forward electricity pool prices and the gas prices, and the 
movements in the market inputs used in the scenarios to 
available observable market data, where possible;
	 Comparing the historical forecasted generation and retail 
volumes with the actual volumes;
	 Assessing the useful lives of EnergyAustralia’s assets to 
the committed asset closure of the assets;
	 Reconciling the generation asset scenarios to the approved 
business plan;
	 Verifying the integrity of formulae and mathematical 
accuracy of management’s valuation model;
	 Assessing the potential impact of possible future 
regulatory policy changes in Australia; and
	 Reviewing the appropriateness of the Group’s disclosures 
on generation assets.
Based on the work performed, we found that management’s 
scenarios were supported by the available evidence.

Fixed asset accounting and the calculation of the Scheme of 
Control permitted return
Refer to notes 10 and 11 to the Group Financial Statements
Consolidated fixed assets and right-of-use assets were 
HK$160,779 million at 31 December 2023. This includes 
fixed assets and leasehold land relating to CLP Power and 
Castle Peak Power Company Limited (CAPCO) (together the 
SoC Companies) (SoC fixed assets) which are the base used 
in the calculation of the permitted return under the Scheme 
of Control (SoC) Agreement.
The annual permitted return is 8% of the SoC Companies’ 
average net fixed assets. If the gross tariff revenue in a 
period is less than or exceeds the total of the SoC operating 
costs, the permitted return and the taxation charges, such 
deficiency shall be deducted from, or such excess shall be 
added to, the Tariff Stabilisation Fund (TSF). In any period, 
the amount of deduction from or addition to the TSF is 
recognised as a revenue adjustment to the extent that the 
return and charges under the SoC are recognised in profit or 
loss.
This is a Key Audit Matter because of the significance of 
the balance and its importance to the SoC Companies. 
The accuracy of SoC fixed asset additions, disposals and 
depreciation charges is important to ensure the SoC fixed 
asset balance is appropriate and the permitted return is 
calculated correctly.
Our procedures in relation to the Group’s SoC fixed assets and 
the calculation of the SoC permitted return included:
	 Assessing the control environment and testing controls 
over SoC fixed assets additions, disposals and depreciation 
charges;
	 Testing the SoC fixed asset additions in the year to 
supporting evidence on a sample basis and assessing 
whether the items have been appropriately capitalised;
	 Assessing the appropriateness of SoC capital accruals 
made by management for large projects by agreeing 
assumptions to audit evidence from the vendors;
	 Assessing the estimated useful lives of the SoC fixed assets 
for compliance with the SoC;
	 Testing depreciation charges by performing depreciation 
reasonableness tests;
	 Obtaining management’s reconciliation of SoC fixed assets 
from the opening balance at the beginning of the year to 
the closing balance at the end of the year and reconciling 
this to the general ledger and supporting records;
	 Recalculating the SoC permitted return for the year; and
	 Recalculating the SoC adjustment to revenue for the year.
Based on the work performed, we found that the Group’s 
SoC fixed asset accounting and the SoC permitted return 
calculation are supported by the available evidence.

Recoverability of trade receivables
Refer to note 19 to the Group Financial Statements
CLP Power and EnergyAustralia have significant retail 
businesses with many individual customers. The offtakers 
for the Group’s other generation businesses are mainly a 
small number of state grid operators in Mainland China. The 
Group measures the loss allowance for its trade receivables 
at an amount equal to the lifetime expected credit losses.
Expected credit losses in CLP Power are close to zero as the 
trade receivables are mostly secured by cash deposits or 
bank guarantees from customers and have no recent history 
of default.
EnergyAustralia has trade receivables of HK$6,832 million 
at 31 December 2023 against which provisions for expected 
credit losses of HK$770 million are held. Management 
estimated the level of expected losses, by assessing future 
cash flows for each group of trade receivables including a 
probability weighted amount determined by evaluating a 
range of possible outcomes based on twelve month rolling 
historical credit loss experience by customer segment, 
geographical region, tenure and type of customer and 
applying that weighting to the receivables held at year end. 
The impact of economic factors, both current and future, 
is considered in assessing the likelihood of recovery from 
customers.
As at 31 December 2023, the Group had total receivables 
of HK$2,426 million relating to unpaid Renewable National 
Subsidies in its Mainland China business. The expected credit 
loss is close to zero as continuous settlements have been 
noted with no history of default and the subsidy is funded 
by the Renewable Energy Development Fund set up and 
administered by the Ministry of Finance.
This is a Key Audit Matter because of the magnitude of the 
trade receivables balance and the significant judgement 
applied in assessing the allowance for expected credit 
losses.
Our procedures in relation to trade receivables included:
	 Testing controls over the billing and collection cycles in CLP 
Power and EnergyAustralia;
	 Testing the system calculated trade receivables ageing 
analysis used to assess the recoverability of receivables in 
CLP Power and EnergyAustralia;
	 Assessing the appropriateness of the credit loss 
provisioning methodologies used by the Group;
	 Assessing the estimates used to determine the expected 
credit losses by considering cash collection performance 
against historical trends and assessing the reasonableness 
of forward-looking factors included in the expected credit 
loss model;
	 Reviewing the allocation of deposits to customer balances 
as a part of CLP Power’s expected credit loss assessment;
	 Reviewing the accuracy of management’s judgements by 
comparing historical provisions against actual write-offs;
	 Reviewing minutes of the boards of directors’ meetings 
relating to the recoverability of trade receivables; and
	 Discussion with management to understand the nature 
and the judgement involved in their determination that 
the expected credit loss on unpaid Renewable National 
Subsidies is close to zero, assessing the regulatory 
eligibility for the Group’s projects and considering subsidies 
collected to-date.
Based on the work performed, we found that management’s 
assessments of the recoverability of trade receivables are 
supported by the available evidence.

Asset retirement obligations (AROs)
Refer to note 26 to the Group Financial Statements
Provisions are held for estimated remediation costs, 
discounted to present value, where the Group has a legal or 
constructive obligation for remediation and the likelihood 
of an economic outflow is probable. Estimating the amount 
and timing of the obligation requires significant judgement. 
Management has assessed the Group’s obligations for 
each asset based on the local regulatory environment and 
expected closure dates.
Management’s key ARO judgements are as follows:
The Group’s ARO provision for land remediation and 
decommissioning of generation assets in Australia was 
HK$3,544 million. The provisions are based on estimates 
by external and internal experts that are discounted using 
internally determined end of plant lives. Other significant 
judgements also include the timing of the asset removal 
and costs to remove infrastructure, remediate soil and 
groundwater, water usage and technological developments.
CLP Power expects that its transmission and distribution 
network will continue to be used for the distribution of 
electricity supply to its customers and considers it remote 
that the network will be removed from the existing land 
sites. Therefore, AROs have not been recognised for 
transmission and distribution assets.
CAPCO is retiring the coal-fired generation units at Castle 
Peak “A” Station (CPA) between 2022 to 2025. Management 
considers that the dismantling obligation for the CPA units 
is covered by the asset decommissioning liability accrued 
under the SoC as at 31 December 2023.
No provision for AROs has been recognised for the other 
generation units of CAPCO as the removal of CAPCO’s other 
fossil-fuel generation units is possible and it is expected 
that should such obligation be incurred, it will be met by the 
liability accrued and the cost recovery mechanism under the 
SoC.
This is a Key Audit Matter because significant judgement 
is required in determining whether an ARO exists and 
estimating the amount and timing of the obligation.
Our procedures in relation to AROs included:
	 Assessing the appropriateness of the Group’s accounting 
policy;
	 Evaluating management’s judgement that it is remote 
that the Hong Kong transmission and distribution network 
would be removed from the existing land sites; it is 
probable that the CPA units will be removed; and it is 
possible but not probable that CAPCO’s other fossil-fuel 
generation units may be removed at some point in time in 
the future;
	 Assessing management’s judgements as to whether a 
contractual or constructive obligation exists based on the 
respective power purchase agreements, lease agreements, 
local laws and regulations and past practice;
	 Assessing the independence, objectivity and competence 
of management’s external and internal experts involved in 
respect of the future cost estimates for those assets where 
a provision has been recognised; and
	 Testing the appropriateness of management’s estimates 
of future costs, the timing of payments and the discount 
rates where management has concluded that a legal or 
constructive obligation exists.
Based on the work performed, we found that the ARO 
provisions are supported by the available evidence.

Other Information
The directors of the Company are responsible for the other information. The other information comprises all of the information 
included in the annual report other than the Group Financial Statements and our auditor’s report thereon.
Our opinion on the Group Financial Statements does not cover the other information and we do not express any form of 
assurance conclusion thereon.
In connection with our audit of the Group Financial Statements, our responsibility is to read the other information and, in doing 
so, consider whether the other information is materially inconsistent with the Group Financial Statements or our knowledge 
obtained in the audit or otherwise appears to be materially misstated.
If, based on the work we have performed, we conclude that there is a material misstatement of this other information, we are 
required to report that fact. We have nothing to report in this regard.
Responsibilities of Directors and the Audit & Risk Committee for the Group Financial 
Statements
The directors of the Company are responsible for the preparation of the Group Financial Statements that give a true and fair 
view in accordance with HKFRSs issued by the HKICPA and the Hong Kong Companies Ordinance, and for such internal control 
as the directors determine is necessary to enable the preparation of Group Financial Statements that are free from material 
misstatement, whether due to fraud or error.
In preparing the Group Financial Statements, the directors are responsible for assessing the Group’s ability to continue as 
a going concern, disclosing, as applicable, matters related to going concern and using the going concern basis of accounting 
unless the directors either intend to liquidate the Group or to cease operations, or have no realistic alternative but to do so.
The Audit & Risk Committee is responsible for overseeing the Group’s financial reporting process on behalf of the Board of 
Directors.
Auditor’s Responsibilities for the Audit of the Group Financial Statements
Our objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the Group Financial Statements as a whole are free from 
material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error, and to issue an auditor’s report that includes our opinion. We report 
our opinion solely to you, as a body, in accordance with Section 405 of the Hong Kong Companies Ordinance and for no other 
purpose. We do not assume responsibility towards or accept liability to any other person for the contents of this report. 
Reasonable assurance is a high level of assurance, but is not a guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance with HKSAs 
will always detect a material misstatement when it exists. Misstatements can arise from fraud or error and are considered 
material if, individually or in the aggregate, they could reasonably be expected to influence the economic decisions of users 
taken on the basis of these Group Financial Statements.
As part of an audit in accordance with HKSAs, we exercise professional judgement and maintain professional scepticism 
throughout the audit. We also:
	 Identify and assess the risks of material misstatement of the Group Financial Statements, whether due to fraud or error, 
design and perform audit procedures responsive to those risks, and obtain audit evidence that is sufficient and appropriate 
to provide a basis for our opinion. The risk of not detecting a material misstatement resulting from fraud is higher than for 
one resulting from error, as fraud may involve collusion, forgery, intentional omissions, misrepresentations, or the override 
of internal control.
	 Obtain an understanding of internal control relevant to the audit in order to design audit procedures that are appropriate in 
the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Group’s internal control.
	 Evaluate the appropriateness of accounting policies used and the reasonableness of accounting estimates and related 
disclosures made by the directors.
CLP Holdings 2023 Annual Report

Independent Auditor’s Report


	 Conclude on the appropriateness of the directors’ use of the going concern basis of accounting and, based on the audit 
evidence obtained, whether a material uncertainty exists related to events or conditions that may cast significant doubt on  
the Group’s ability to continue as a going concern. If we conclude that a material uncertainty exists, we are required to 
draw attention in our auditor’s report to the related disclosures in the Group Financial Statements or, if such disclosures are 
inadequate, to modify our opinion. Our conclusions are based on the audit evidence obtained up to the date of our auditor’s 
report. However, future events or conditions may cause the Group to cease to continue as a going concern.
	 Evaluate the overall presentation, structure and content of the Group Financial Statements, including the disclosures, and 
whether the Group Financial Statements represent the underlying transactions and events in a manner that achieves fair 
presentation.
	 Obtain sufficient appropriate audit evidence regarding the financial information of the entities or business activities within 
the Group to express an opinion on the Group Financial Statements. We are responsible for the direction, supervision and 
performance of the group audit. We remain solely responsible for our audit opinion.
We communicate with the Audit & Risk Committee regarding, among other matters, the planned scope and timing of the audit 
and significant audit findings, including any significant deficiencies in internal control that we identify during our audit.
We also provide the Audit & Risk Committee with a statement that we have complied with relevant ethical requirements 
regarding independence, and to communicate with them all relationships and other matters that may reasonably be thought to 
bear on our independence, and where applicable, actions taken to eliminate threats or safeguards applied.
From the matters communicated with the Audit & Risk Committee, we determine those matters that were of most significance 
in the audit of the Group Financial Statements of the current period and are therefore the key audit matters. We describe these 
matters in our auditor’s report unless law or regulation precludes public disclosure about the matter or when, in extremely rare 
circumstances, we determine that a matter should not be communicated in our report because the adverse consequences of 
doing so would reasonably be expected to outweigh the public interest benefits of such communication.

CLP Holdings 2023 Annual Report
Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows
for the year ended 31 December 2023


Material accounting policies are included in the corresponding notes to the financial statements or set out below.
1.	
Basis of Preparation
The Company, CLP Holdings Limited, and its subsidiaries are collectively referred to as the Group in the consolidated 
financial statements.
The consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with Hong Kong Financial Reporting Standards 
(HKFRS) issued by the Hong Kong Institute of Certified Public Accountants (HKICPA) and requirements of the Hong Kong 
Companies Ordinance (Cap.622).
The preparation of the consolidated financial statements in conformity with HKFRS requires the use of certain critical  
accounting estimates. It also requires management to exercise their judgement in the process of applying the 
Group’s material accounting policies. The areas involving a higher degree of judgement or complexity, or areas where 
assumptions and estimates are especially significant to the consolidated financial statements, are disclosed in relevant 
notes to the financial statements.
2.	
Changes in Material Accounting Policies
(A)	 Amendments to standards first time adopted in 2023
There have been a number of amendments to standards effective in 2023. Amendments which are applicable to the 
Group include:
	 Amendments to HKAS 1 and HKFRS Practice Statement 2 Disclosure of Accounting Policies: require entities to 
disclose their material rather than significant accounting policies, and provide guidance to help entities apply 
materiality judgements to accounting policies disclosures;
	 Amendments to HKAS 8 Definition of Accounting Estimates: clarify the distinction between changes in accounting 
estimates, changes in accounting policies and correction of errors;
	 Amendments to HKAS 12 Deferred Tax related to Assets and Liabilities arising from a Single Transaction: require 
entities to recognise deferred tax on transactions that, on initial recognition, give rise to equal amount of taxable 
and deductible temporary differences, such as leases and decommissioning liabilities; and
	 Amendments to HKAS 12 International Tax Reform – Pillar Two Model Rules: provide a mandatory temporary  
relief from the requirement to recognise and disclose deferred taxes arising from the jurisdictional 
implementation of the Pillar Two model rules, and provide disclosure requirements for the affected entities to 
facilitate understanding of the exposure to these rules.
The Group has applied the above amendments for the first time in 2023. The adoption of these amendments has 
had no significant impact on the results and financial position of the Group. The Group has not changed its material 
accounting policies or make retrospective adjustments as a result of adopting these amendments.
Under the international tax reform, governments are expected to implement a new global minimum tax 
framework on multinational enterprises (Pillar Two Model Rules). At the date of this report, the Australian 
and Hong Kong governments have announced to implement the rules for income years commencing on or 
after 1 January 2024 and 2025 respectively. The Group continues to monitor the local legislation for Hong 
Kong and Australia and development of Pillar Two Model Rules in other jurisdictions CLP operates and 
assess the potential impact.

Changes in Material Accounting Policies (continued)
(B)	 Amendments to standards and revised interpretation effective after 2023
The following amendments to standards and revised interpretation, which may be applicable to the Group, have 
been issued and are effective after 2023. The Group has not elected to early adopt these pronouncements in 2023. 
These pronouncements are not expected to have a material impact on the results or the financial position of the 
Group.
	 Amendments to HKAS 1 Classification of Liabilities as Current or Non-current
	 Amendments to HKAS 1 Non-current Liabilities with Covenants
	 Amendments to HKAS 7 and HKFRS 7 Supplier Finance Arrangements
	 Amendments to HKAS 21 Lack of Exchangeability
	 Amendments to HKFRS 10 and HKAS 28 Sale or Contribution of Assets between an Investor and its Associate or 
Joint Venture
	 Amendments to HKFRS 16 Lease Liability in a Sale and Leaseback
	 HK Interpretation 5 (Revised) Presentation of Financial Statements – Classification by the Borrower of a Term 
Loan that Contains a Repayment on Demand Clause
3.	
Consolidation and Equity Accounting
(A)	 Basis of consolidation
The consolidated financial statements of the Group incorporate the financial statements of the Company and its 
subsidiaries up to 31 December and include the Group’s interests in joint ventures and associates on the basis set out 
in (B) below.
Subsidiaries are entities over which the Group has control. The Group controls an entity when the Group is exposed 
to, or has rights to, variable returns from its involvement with the entity and has the ability to affect those returns 
through its power to direct the activities of the entity.
The financial statements of subsidiaries acquired during the year are included in the consolidated financial 
statements from the date on which control is transferred to the Group. They are de-consolidated from the date that 
control ceases.
Intercompany transactions, balances and unrealised gains on transactions between Group entities are eliminated on 
consolidation. Unrealised losses are also eliminated unless the transaction provides evidence of an impairment of the 
asset transferred. Where necessary, to ensure consistency with the policies adopted by the Group, adjustments are 
made to the financial statements of subsidiaries, joint ventures and associates.
(B)	 Joint ventures and associates
A joint venture is an arrangement in which the Group has joint control, whereby the Group has rights to the net 
assets of the arrangement, rather than rights to its assets and obligations for its liabilities. Joint control is the 
contractually agreed sharing of control of an arrangement, which exists only when decisions about the relevant 
activities require unanimous consent of the parties sharing control.
An associate is an entity over which the Group has significant influence but not control nor joint control over the 
financial and operating policies, generally accompanying a shareholding of between 20% and 50% of the voting 
rights.
Investments in joint ventures / associates are accounted for using the equity method. They are initially recognised 
at cost. Subsequent to initial recognition, the consolidated financial statements include the Group’s share of post-
acquisition profit or loss and other comprehensive income, until the date on which joint control or significant 
influence ceases. Distributions received from an investee reduce the carrying amounts of the investments.
221
CLP Holdings 2023 Annual Report


3.	
Consolidation and Equity Accounting (continued)
(C)	 Joint operations
A joint operation is an arrangement in which the Group has joint control (as explained in (B) above), whereby the 
Group has rights to the assets and obligations for the liabilities, relating to the arrangement. When the Group 
undertakes its activities under a joint operation, the Group as a joint operator recognises its direct right to, and its 
share of jointly held assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses of the joint operation. They are incorporated in the 
financial statements under appropriate headings.
(D)	 Change in ownership interests
Transactions with non-controlling interests that do not result in a loss of control are treated as transactions with 
equity owners of the Group. A change in ownership interest results in an adjustment between the carrying amounts 
of the controlling and non-controlling interests to reflect their relative interests in the subsidiary. Any difference 
between the amount of the adjustment to non-controlling interests and any consideration paid or received, and the 
reattribution of other comprehensive income to non-controlling interests are recognised in a separate reserve within 
equity attributable to owners of the Group.
When the Group ceases to consolidate or equity account for an investment because of a loss of control, joint  
control or significant influence, any retained interest in the entity is remeasured to its fair value, with the change in  
carrying amount recognised in profit or loss. This fair value becomes the initial carrying amount for the purpose of  
subsequent accounting for the retained interest as a joint venture, associate or financial asset. In addition, any 
amounts previously recognised in other comprehensive income in respect of that entity are reclassified to profit or 
loss. Gains or losses on disposals are recognised in profit or loss.
If the ownership interest in a joint venture or associate is reduced, it is possible that joint control or significant 
influence is retained or a joint venture becomes an associate. As the Group continues to apply the equity method 
under both cases, the retained interest is not remeasured. However, a proportionate share of the amounts previously 
recognised in other comprehensive income of the investment is reclassified to profit or loss where appropriate.
A quick guide to the classification of equity investments:
Control  Subsidiary
Joint control  Joint venture / joint operation
Significant influence  Associate
Less than significant influence  Equity investment
4.	
Inventory
Inventory comprises stores and fuel and is stated at the lower of cost and net realisable value. Cost is calculated on a 
weighted average basis. Net realisable value is determined on the basis of anticipated sales proceeds less estimated 
selling expenses.
5.	
Renewable Energy Products
Renewable energy and energy efficiency schemes operate through the creation, trade and surrender of energy products. 
Renewable energy certificates are recognised upon the risks and rewards being transferred to the Group and are 
measured at the lower of cost or net realisable value. Cost is calculated on a weighted average basis.
CLP Holdings 2023 Annual Report
222
Material Accounting Policies


6.	
Retirement Benefits
The Group operates and / or participates in a number of defined contribution plans and defined benefits plans for its 
employees, the assets of which are held independently of the Group’s assets in trustee-administered funds.
The Group’s contributions to the defined contribution plans are charged to the consolidated statement of profit or loss in 
the year to which the contributions relate.
The Group, through its subsidiaries, operates funded defined benefit plans for qualifying employees in Australia. Under 
the plans, the employees are entitled to lump sum benefits on retirement, death, disablement and withdrawal. The level 
of benefits provided depends on employees’ years of service and final average salary. Plan assets held in trusts are 
governed by local regulations and practice.
The cost of providing benefits under the defined benefit plans is determined using the projected unit credit actuarial 
valuation method. Past service costs are recognised immediately in profit or loss. Remeasurement gains and losses  
arising from experience adjustments and changes in actuarial assumptions are recognised directly in other 
comprehensive income.
The defined benefit asset recognised in the consolidated statement of financial position represents the surplus of the fair 
value of plan assets over the present value of the defined benefit obligation at the end of the reporting period.
7.	
Foreign Currency Translation
Items included in the financial statements of each of the Group entities are measured using the currency of the primary 
economic environment in which the entity operates (the functional currency). The consolidated financial statements are 
presented in Hong Kong dollar, which is the Group’s presentation currency.
Foreign currency transactions are translated into the relevant functional currency using the exchange rates prevailing at 
the dates of the transactions or valuation where items are remeasured. Foreign exchange gains and losses resulting from 
the settlement of such transactions and from the translation of monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign 
currencies by using the exchange rates at the end of the reporting period are recognised in profit or loss, except when 
deferred in other comprehensive income as qualifying cash flow hedges or qualifying net investment hedges.
For subsidiaries, joint ventures and associates that have a functional currency different from the Group’s presentation 
currency for the purpose of consolidation, assets and liabilities for each statement of financial position presented are 
translated using the closing rates at the end of the reporting period, and income and expenses for each statement of  
profit or loss and other comprehensive income presented are translated at the average exchange rates for the  
reporting period (unless this average rate is not a reasonable approximation of the cumulative effect of the rates prevailing 
 
on the transaction dates, in which case income and expenses are translated at the date of the transactions). All 
resulting exchange differences are recognised in other comprehensive income and as a separate component of equity. 
Reclassifications of gains or losses previously recognised in other comprehensive income to profit or loss are translated 
by using the exchange rate at the date of reclassification. The remaining reserve balances are translated using the closing 
rates at the end of the reporting period. Any exchange differences arising from these are taken to retained profits 
directly.
Goodwill and fair value adjustments arising on the acquisition of a foreign entity are treated as assets and liabilities of the 
foreign entity and translated using the closing rates at the end of the reporting period.
Upon disposal of a foreign operation (that is, a disposal of the Group’s entire interest in a foreign operation, or a disposal 
involving loss of control over a subsidiary / loss of joint control over a joint venture / loss of significant influence over an  
associate that includes a foreign operation), all of the exchange differences accumulated in equity in respect of that 
operation are reclassified to profit or loss.
223
CLP Holdings 2023 Annual Report


7.	
Foreign Currency Translation (continued)
In the case of a partial disposal that does not result in the Group losing control over a subsidiary that includes a foreign 
operation, the proportionate share of accumulated exchange differences is re-attributed to non-controlling interests and 
is not recognised in profit or loss. For all other partial disposals (that is, reductions in the Group’s ownership interest in a  
joint venture or associate that do not result in the Group losing joint control or significant influence) the proportionate 
share of the accumulated exchange differences is reclassified to profit or loss.
Monetary assets and liabilities are assets to 
be received and liabilities to be paid in fixed 
amounts. For example, a trade receivable is a 
monetary asset (the amount to be received is 
fixed) but a fixed asset is not a monetary asset 
because it is uncertain how much you will receive 
if the fixed asset is sold.
An entity can have both functional currency and 
presentation currency, however, a consolidation 
group can only have presentation currency but  
not functional currency. This is because 
presentation currency is a matter of choice but 
functional currency is based on the different 
primary economic environment in which each 
group entity operates.

Revenue
Accounting Policy
(A)	 Revenue from contracts with customers
Revenues from sales of electricity and gas are recognised when electricity and gas are supplied to and consumed 
by the customers. Revenues are measured at the amounts billed to the customers based on the periodic cycle 
meter readings and the estimated accruals for the value of electricity and gas consumed from the meter reading 
date to the end of the reporting period (“unbilled revenue”).
(B)	 Revenue from sales of properties
Revenue from sales of properties is recognised when the control of asset is transferred to the customer, being at 
the point in time the physical possession or the legal title of the completed property, and the Group has present 
right to payment and the collection of the consideration is probable.
Critical Accounting Estimates and Judgements: Unbilled Retail Revenue
The Group records revenues from retail energy sales using the accrual accounting method. In Hong Kong, the unbilled 
retail revenue is calculated using estimates including consumption quantity based on electricity sent-out adjusted by 
loss factors, pattern of residential and non-residential consumption, weather and certain other factors. In Australia, 
the unbilled retail revenue is calculated based on the electricity purchased and applicable tariffs for the mass market 
customers, as well as actual meter readings and contracted rates for commercial & industrial customers. The amount 
is adjusted for physical energy loss and other measurable factors. Unbilled retail revenue of the Group (included in 
trade and other receivables) totalled HK$4,001 million at 31 December 2023 (2022: HK$3,470 million).
The Group’s revenue primarily represents sales of electricity and gas, which is recognised over time, and is disaggregated

Notes:
(a)	 The energy retail market in Australia is experiencing several changes, most notably over the second half of 2023. Energy retail business of 
EnergyAustralia Holdings Limited (EnergyAustralia) was affected by adverse energy retail market trends, notably, margins have suffered 
from increased supply costs, intensifying competition and higher interest rates have also negatively impacted the discount rate.
	
As a result of the factors outlined above, an assessment of the value in use of the energy retail cash generating unit (CGU) was performed 
to determine the recoverable amount. The recoverable amount did not support the carrying value of the energy retail CGU at 31 December 
2023. As a result, the Group has recognised an impairment on the energy retail goodwill of HK$5,868 million (A$1,103 million) in the profit or 
loss. The recoverable amount of the energy retail CGU with further information was disclosed in Note 13.
(b)	 Upon entering into an agreement to sell 10% shareholding in Apraava Energy Private Limited (Apraava Energy), Apraava Energy was 
presented as a disposal group held for sale at 30 June 2022 and losses of HK$1,635 million on measurement of the disposal group were 
recognised. A disposal loss of HK$2,677 million was further recognised upon the completion of the transaction in late December 2022, 
resulting in the total loss of HK$4,312 million. Apraava Energy then ceased to be a subsidiary and became a joint venture of the Group.

(d)	 Triggered by reduction in utilisation hours of Dali Yang_er Hydro Power Station (Dali Yang_er), which was resulted from dry weather and 
increased upstream water usage, and continuous low tariff, an impairment provision for fixed assets of HK$85 million was recognised in 
2023. 
(e)	 In November 2022, the Group completed the sale of its entire 70% interest in CLP Guangxi Fangchenggang Power Company Limited

10.	 Fixed Assets
Accounting Policy
Fixed assets are stated at cost less accumulated depreciation and accumulated impairment losses. Cost includes 
expenditure that is directly attributable to the acquisition of the fixed asset. Cost may also include transfer from 
equity of any gains / losses on qualifying cash flow hedges of foreign currency purchases of fixed assets. Subsequent 
costs are included in the asset’s carrying amount or recognised as a separate asset, only when it is probable that 
future economic benefits associated with the item will flow to the Group and the cost of the item can be measured 
reliably. For any asset replacement, the carrying amount of the replaced part is derecognised. All other repairs and 
maintenance are recognised as expenses in the period in which they are incurred.
Depreciation of fixed assets is calculated, using the straight-line method, to allocate their costs to their estimated 
residual values over their estimated useful lives. The estimated useful lives of the fixed assets are set out below:
	
SoC fixed assets	
Non-SoC fixed assets
Freehold land	
not applicable	
not depreciable
Cable tunnels	
100 years	
30 years

Other equipment, furniture and fittings, motor vehicles and marine crafts	
5 – 10 years	
2 – 10 years
*	 Useful lives of certain generating plants have been extended by 10 – 25 years after mid-life refurbishments
The assets’ residual values and useful lives are reviewed and adjusted, if appropriate, at the end of each reporting 
period. For plant under construction, no depreciation is provided until the construction is completed and the assets 
are ready for their intended use. An asset’s carrying amount is written down immediately to its estimated recoverable 
amount if the asset’s carrying amount is greater than its estimated recoverable amount. The gain or loss on disposal 
of a fixed asset is the difference between the net sales proceeds and the carrying amount of the relevant asset, and is 
recognised in profit or loss.

Critical Accounting Estimates and Judgements
(A)	 Assessment of the Carrying Value of Generation Assets in Australia
Given continued changes in the National Electricity Market (NEM) in Australia and changes in the supply and 
demand equilibrium, risk is introduced in market modelling which heightens the criticality of this judgement area. 
As part of making these critical judgements, risks do exist in the assumptions made around supply and demand 
with regard to our generation assets in Australia. In certain circumstances, where demand expectations and 
supply side responses vary substantially from the assumptions made, particularly in regards to the transition to 
renewable energy sources and uses, significant changes in the value of the assets could eventuate. The NEM is 
highly sensitive to a variety of factors such as government intervention and expected power plant closure dates. 
There has been no change in expected closure dates of our generation assets during 2023.
EnergyAustralia aims to address the enormous challenges associated with climate change and is committed 
to Australia’s transition to net zero emissions with cleaner, reliable and affordable energy for customers. 
EnergyAustralia is transforming its generation portfolio, investing in cleaner forms of energy, while helping 
customers to reduce their own emissions. When determining whether the carrying value of the generation assets 
is supportable, scenarios are produced which reflect a range of economic conditions that may exist over the life 
of the assets. The scenarios consider a broad range of outcomes including expected power plant closure dates, 
renewable generation, emissions reduction trajectories, potential regulatory changes including those impacting 
the timing of national power plant closure dates and the impact to the useful lives of our generation assets in 
Australia. The scenarios are then considered in terms of likelihood to arrive at management’s best estimate.
Key estimates and assumptions for assessing the carrying value of the generation assets are as follows:
	 Critical judgement exists in estimating forward electricity pool prices (the forward curve), generation volumes, 
retail volumes, gas prices and long-term assumptions around market movements and growth rates.
	 Operating costs are escalated by relevant cost drivers using activity-based costing principles. Significant 
uncertainties exist around fuel supply and non-contracted fuel costs are based on management’s estimate of 
future fuel supply expectation and prices.
The assessment concluded that the carrying value of generation assets (HK$13.3 billion) was supported by future 
cash flows. Management particularly considers the generation CGU to be highly sensitive to a change in expected 
long-term wholesale prices, which interplay with coal supply and expected power plant closure dates. The Group 
will continually assess the carrying value of the generation assets as the market and the Group transition towards a 
cleaner energy future.
(B)	 Assessment of the Carrying Values of Fixed Assets and Right-of-use Assets in Other Regions
The Group has also made substantial investments in fixed assets and right-of-use assets (mainly leasehold land 
and land use rights) in other regions. The Group conducts impairment reviews of these assets whenever events or 
changes in circumstances indicate that their carrying amounts may not be recoverable.
Determining whether an asset or a CGU should be impaired requires an estimation of the recoverable amount, 
which requires the Group to estimate the future cash flows, a growth rate (that reflects the economic 
environments in which the Group operates) and a pre-tax discount rate (that reflects the current market 
assessments of the time value of money and the risks specific to the asset, inclusive of climate change impact) in 
order to calculate the present value. Where the present value of the expected cash flows is less than the asset’s 
carrying amount, an impairment loss may arise. During 2023, after reviewing the business environment as well as 
 
the Group’s strategies and past performance of the investments, management concluded that there was no 
indicator of impairment of fixed assets and right-of-use assets except for Dali Yang_er (Note 5(d)).

11.	 Right-of-Use Assets
Accounting Policy
The Group as a lessee recognises right-of-use assets at the commencement date of the lease (i.e. the date the 
underlying asset is available for use). Right-of-use assets are measured at cost, less any accumulated depreciation and  
impairment losses, and adjusted for any remeasurement of lease liabilities. The cost of right-of-use assets includes 
the amount of lease liabilities recognised, initial direct costs incurred, and lease payments made at or before the 
commencement date less any lease incentives received. Right-of-use assets are depreciated on a straight-line basis 
over the shorter of the lease term or the estimated useful lives of the assets.
The Group has lease contracts for land and buildings and various items of plant, machinery and equipment used in its 
operations. The movements during the year are set out below:

Notes:
(a)	 Leasehold land represents lease payments, including land premium, on lease of land with the tenure of 20 to 150 years.
(b)	 The Group has leased several assets including a water treatment plant, battery storage facilities and offices. Lease terms are negotiated on 
an individual basis and contain a wide range of terms and conditions. Tenures of the leases range from 1 to 24 years.
12.	 Investment Property
Accounting Policy
Investment property includes property that is being constructed or developed for future use as an investment 
property. Land held under an operating lease is accounted for as an investment property when the rest of the 
definition of an investment property under the accounting standard is met. Investment property is measured initially 
at cost, including related transaction costs. Subsequent to initial recognition, investment property is measured at fair 
value, unless it is still in the course of construction or development at the end of the reporting period and its fair value 
cannot be reliably measured at that time. Fair value is based on active market prices, adjusted, if necessary, for any 
difference in the nature, location or condition of the specific asset. If the information is not available, the Group uses 
alternative valuation methods such as recent prices on less active markets or discounted cash flow projections. Any 
gains and losses arising from changes in the fair value or from the retirement or disposal of an investment property 
are recognised in profit or loss in the period in which they arise.

Investment property represents the commercial interest of the retail portion of the Laguna Mall in Hong Kong, which is 
leased out by the Group under operating leases.
Investment property was valued by Cushman & Wakefield Limited (Cushman), an independent qualified valuer, who holds 
 
recognised relevant professional qualifications and has recent experience in the locations and segments of the investment  
property valued.
Cushman has valued the property at 31 December 2023 by using the income capitalisation approach, cross-referenced 
with comparable market transactions. The income capitalisation approach is based on the capitalisation of the existing 
rental / licence income and potential reversionary income over the remaining tenure of the property from the date of  
valuation at appropriate capitalisation rates that by reference to the yields achieved in analysed market sales 
transactions and as expected by investors. The significant unobservable input is the capitalisation rates adopted for the 
valuation which are ranging from 4.00% to 4.25% (2022: 3.90% to 4.15%). The fair value is negatively correlated to the 
capitalisation rate.
The fair value measurement of the Group’s investment property is categorised within Level 3 of the fair value hierarchy at  
31 December 2023 and 2022.
13.	 Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets
Accounting Policy
(A)	 Goodwill
Goodwill arises from the acquisition of subsidiaries and represents the excess of the consideration transferred, 
the amount of any non-controlling interest in the acquiree and the acquisition-date fair value of any previous 
equity interest in the acquiree over the fair value of the identifiable net assets acquired.
For the purpose of impairment testing, goodwill acquired in a business combination is allocated to each of the 
CGUs, or groups of CGUs, that is expected to benefit from the synergies of the combination. Each CGU or group 
of CGUs to which the goodwill is allocated represents the lowest level within the entity at which the goodwill is 
monitored for internal management purposes. Goodwill is monitored at the operating segment level.
Goodwill impairment reviews are undertaken at least annually or if events or changes in circumstances indicate a  
potential impairment. The carrying value of the CGU containing the goodwill is compared to the recoverable 
amount, which is the higher of value in use and the fair value less costs of disposal. Any impairment is recognised 
immediately as an expense and cannot be subsequently reversed.
(B)	 Other intangible assets
Intangible assets other than goodwill are measured initially at cost or, if acquired in a business combination, fair 
value at the acquisition date. An intangible asset with a finite useful life is amortised on a straight-line basis over 
its useful life and carried at cost less accumulated amortisation and accumulated impairment losses.
237
CLP Holdings 2023 Annual Report


13.	 Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets (continued)
Critical Accounting Estimates and Judgements: Goodwill Impairment
The recoverable amounts of CGUs with allocated goodwill are determined based on value in use calculations, using 
cash flow projections derived from the approved business plan which has considered committed cost optimisation 
initiatives, and a forecast covering a period of ten years, and application of a discounted terminal value. Projections 
for a period of greater than five years have been used on the basis that a longer projection period represents the 
long-dated nature of our generation and electricity supply assets and a more appropriate reflection of future cash 
flows from potential legislative, regulatory and structural changes in the industry.
Energy retail business in Australia
As disclosed in Note 4(a), an impairment on energy retail goodwill of HK$5,868 million (A$1,103 million) has been 
recognised in the profit or loss. Subsequent to this impairment, the recoverable amount of the energy retail CGU is 
equal to its carrying value at the impairment assessment date of HK$8,086 million (A$1,520 million).
Key assumptions for value in use calculations
The key assumptions used in the value in use calculations reflect a combination of internal and external factors 
impacting gross margin, number of customer accounts and discount rates.
The assumptions impacting gross margin include:
	 Retail tariffs are sensitive to regulatory changes including regulation and deregulation, and based on management 
estimates and expectations of current and expected market conditions arising from known and potential 
regulatory outcomes.
	 Electricity and gas volumes for purchases and sales in the short term represent the internal forecast projections. 
External information is used to verify and align internal estimates.
	 Electricity and gas network (transmission and distribution) cost assumptions are based on published regulated 
prices. When no estimates are available, network costs are assumed to escalate by the relevant consumer price 
index.
	 Electricity pool prices, generation volumes, dispatch levels and gas prices were derived using modelling of the 
electricity and gas wholesale markets. NEM modelling is prepared internally using, where possible, observable 
inputs. The modelling used for the electricity and gas markets is based on experience and observable market 
activity.
Other assumptions include:
	 The cash flow projections are discounted using a pre-tax discount rate of 11.3% (2022: 11.0%). The discount rates 
reflect the current market assessments of the time value of money and are based on the estimated cost of capital.
	 A long-term growth rate of 2.5% (2022: 2.5%) is applied in the terminal value calculation beyond a period of ten 
years of cash flows.

13.	 Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets (continued)
Critical Accounting Estimates and Judgements: Goodwill Impairment (continued)
Energy retail business in Australia (continued)
Sensitivity analysis for the energy retail CGU valuation
Both retail tariffs and customer account growth assumptions are judgemental and have a direct impact on the CGU 
valuation. Movements in discount rates, whilst driven by different assumptions, would also have an impact.
	 A 5% decrease in long-term gross margin would decrease the recoverable amount by HK$1,383 million (A$260 
million).
	 A 1% decrease in long-term annual customer growth rate would decrease the recoverable amount by HK$1,373 
million (A$258 million).
	 An increase in the discount rate of 0.1% would decrease the recoverable amount by HK$154 million (A$29 million).
These sensitivities are based on changing the relevant assumption while holding other assumptions constant. In 
practice, this is unlikely to occur and changes in some of the assumptions may be correlated.
Hong Kong electricity business
The key assumptions used in the value in use calculations are as follows:
	 Goodwill arising from the acquisition of CAPCO has been allocated to CLP Power and CAPCO as a combined CGU as  
the acquisition is considered beneficial to the whole SoC business.
	 The electricity tariff for the supply of electricity in meeting the demand of customers in Hong Kong over the 
forecast periods is determined with reference to the rate-setting mechanism under the SoC.
	 The forecast for electricity demand is based on the load forecast to support local infrastructure development and  
meeting customer load requirements, maintaining safety and supply reliability, and meeting environmental 
requirements.
	 Expenditures for the supply of electricity in meeting the forecast demand are based on committed purchase 
contracts where applicable, and inputs on cost trend specific to the electricity business in Hong Kong. Such 
forecast aligns with the projection in the Business Plan for our Hong Kong electricity business, with capital 
expenditures up to 2028 aligned with those forecasted in the approved Development Plan.
	 Terminal value of the CGU is adopted to estimate the cash flows to be generated for the periods beyond ten years. 
This is expressed as a multiple of net asset values which corresponds to our return model based on fixed assets 
investment. The terminal value is a multiple of 1.2 times of the net asset values forecasted at the end of 2033.
	 The cash flow projections are discounted using a pre-tax discount rate of 9.75% (2022: 9.69%), or a post-tax 
return of 8.00% (2022: 8.00%) which reflects the SoC return rate applicable to the electricity business in Hong 
Kong.
Up to the date of this report, there were no reasonably possible changes in any of the key assumptions mentioned 
above that would have caused the recoverable amount of this CGU to be less than its carrying value.

CLP Holdings 2023 Annual Report


16.	 Derivative Financial Instruments
Accounting Policy
A derivative is initially recognised at fair value on the date a derivative contract is entered into and is subsequently 
remeasured at fair value. The method of recognising the resulting gain or loss depends on whether the derivative is  
designated as a hedging instrument, and if so, the nature of the item being hedged. Fair value gain or loss arising from 
derivatives not designated or not qualified for hedge accounting are recognised immediately in profit or loss.
The Group designates certain derivatives as either fair value hedges, which are hedges of the fair value of recognised 
financial assets or financial liabilities or firm commitments (e.g. fixed interest rate loans and foreign currency trade 
receivables) or cash flow hedges, which are hedges of the cash flows of recognised financial assets or financial 
liabilities or highly probable forecast transactions (e.g. floating interest rate loans and future purchases of fuels 
denominated in US dollar).
The Group documents at the inception of the transaction the intended relationship between hedging instruments and 
hedged items, as well as its risk management objectives and strategy for undertaking hedge transactions. The Group 
also documents its assessment, both at hedge inception and on an ongoing basis, of whether the hedging relationship 
meets the hedge effectiveness requirements.
(A)	 Fair value hedges
Changes in the fair values of derivatives that are designated and qualify as fair value hedges are recognised in  
profit or loss, which offset any changes in the fair values recognised in profit or loss of the corresponding hedged 
asset or liability that are attributable to the hedged risk and achieve the overall hedging result.
(B)	 Cash flow hedges
The effective portion of changes in the fair values of derivatives that are designated and qualify as cash flow 
hedges is recognised in other comprehensive income. The ineffective portion is recognised immediately in profit 
or loss.
Amounts accumulated in equity are reclassified to profit or loss in the periods when the hedged items affect 
profit or loss. Such reclassification from equity will offset the effect on profit or loss of the corresponding hedged 
item to achieve the overall hedging result. However, when the highly probable forecast transaction that is hedged 
results in the recognition of a non-financial asset (for example, inventory or fixed assets), the gains and losses 
previously deferred in equity are transferred from equity and included in the initial measurement of the cost of 
the asset at the time of acquisition. The deferred amounts are ultimately recognised in fuel costs in the case of 
inventory or in depreciation in the case of fixed assets.
When a hedging instrument expires, or is sold or terminated, or when a hedge no longer meets the criteria for  
hedge accounting, hedge accounting is discontinued prospectively. Any cumulative gain or loss remains in equity  
at that time is accounted for according to the nature of the underlying transactions (as discussed above) once the 
hedged cash flow occurs. When a forecast transaction is no longer expected to occur, the cumulative gain or loss 
that has been recorded in equity is reclassiﬁed to proﬁt or loss immediately.

Notes to the Financial Statements


16.	 Derivative Financial Instruments (continued)
Accounting Policy (continued)
(C)	 Costs of hedging
Forward element of forward contracts and foreign currency basis spread of financial instruments may be 
separated and excluded from the designated hedging instruments. In such case, the Group treats the excluded 
elements as costs of hedging. The fair value changes of these elements are recognised in a separate component 
of equity. For time-period related hedged items, these elements at the date of designation (to the extent that it 
relates to the hedged item) are amortised on a systematic and rational basis to profit or loss over the hedging 
period. For transaction related hedged items, the cumulative change of these elements is included in the initial 
carrying amount of any non-financial asset recognised when the hedged transaction occurs or is recognised in 
profit or loss if the hedged transaction affects profit or loss.
(D)	 Rebalancing of hedge relationships
If the hedge ratio for risk management purposes is no longer optimal but the risk management objective remains 
unchanged and the hedge continues to qualify for hedge accounting, the hedge relationship will be rebalanced by 
adjusting either the volume of the hedging instrument or the volume of the hedged item so that the hedge ratio 
aligns with the ratio used for risk management purposes. Any hedge ineffectiveness is calculated and accounted 
for in proﬁt or loss at the time of the hedge relationship rebalancing.

17.	 Other Non-current Assets
Accounting Policy
(A)	 Investments
Investments classified at fair value through other comprehensive income are initially recognised at fair value and  
are elected to present subsequent changes in fair value in other comprehensive income. The gains or losses on  
such investments are never reclassified to profit or loss and no impairment is recognised in profit or loss. 
Cumulative gains and losses recognised in other comprehensive income are transferred to retained profits on 
disposal of the investment. Dividends on the investments are recognised in profit or loss unless they clearly 
represent a recovery of part of the cost of the investment, in which case they are deducted from the carrying 
amounts of the investments directly.
Investments classified at fair value through profit or loss (mainly investments in funds) are initially recognised at 
fair value and subsequent changes in fair value are recognised in profit or loss.
(B)	 Contract acquisition costs
Incremental costs to obtain a contract with a customer are capitalised if they are expected to be recoverable. 
Costs capitalised are amortised on a straight-line basis over the expected benefit periods of the contracts. Non-
incremental costs, i.e. costs that would have been incurred regardless of whether the contract is obtained, are 
expensed when incurred.

Notes:
(a)	 On 6 December 2021, the Group and Far East Consortium Limited entered into a sale and purchase agreement (“SPA”) to purchase a target 
company which owns a land situated in Kai Tak, Hong Kong, for a development divided into a hotel portion and a non-industrial portion 
(including an office portion) (“the Office Portion”). At completion, the target company will hold only the Office Portion which will become 
CLP’s new Head Office. A coordination agreement was signed on the same date to facilitate the construction and development of the  
Office Portion directed by CLP. The consideration under the SPA amounted to HK$3.38 billion subject to post completion adjustments 
including additional costs in respect of any add-on designs required by the Group.
At 31 December 2023, the remaining amount is included in capital commitments under Note 31(A). The transaction is expected to be 
completed by 2024.
(b)	 The most recent actuarial valuation of the defined benefit plans for the Group’s Australian subsidiaries, at 31 December 2023, was prepared 
by Mr Mark Samuels of Mercer Consulting (Australia) Pty Ltd, a fellow of the Institute of Actuaries of Australia. In respect of the plans for the  
Group’s Australian subsidiaries: (i) the principal actuarial assumptions used include discount rate of 4.9% (2022: 5.2%), long-term salary 
increase rate of 4.0% (2022: 2.5% to 3.3%) and pension increase rate of 2.5% to 3.5% (2022: 2.5% to 3.5%); (ii) the level of funding is 155% 
(2022: 160%).
The costs for these defined benefit plans represent an immaterial portion to the Group’s total retirement benefit costs. For the year ended 31 
December 2023, the associated costs represented 0.0% (2022: 1.0%) of the Group’s total retirement benefit costs.

Notes to the Financial Statements


18.	 Properties for Sale
Accounting Policy
Properties for sale comprise leasehold land and building and are carried at the lower of cost and net realisable value. 
Properties for sale are included in current assets when it is expected to be realised or is intended for sales in the 
normal operating cycle.
On 18 December 2017, the Group and Sino Land Company Limited (Sino Land) agreed to collaborate on redeveloping 
the Group’s former headquarters at Argyle Street for residential purposes and to preserve the Clock Tower building for 
community use. Under the development arrangement, Sino Land is fully responsible for all development costs such as 
land premium, construction costs, professional fees etc. and paid a non-refundable upfront payment of HK$3 billion to 
the Group. The residential property development was completed in November 2022 and the sale of residential units is 
undergoing.
The arrangement entered into by the Group and Sino Land does not involve an establishment of a separate legal entity 
and is considered as a joint operation under HKFRS 11 Joint Arrangements. The non-refundable upfront payment forms 
part of the proceeds from the property development and is recorded as deferred revenue (Note 22(e)). When legal titles 
of the units in the developed property are passed to the purchasers, deferred revenue and the percentage share of the 
sale proceeds to which the Group is entitled will be credited to the profit or loss as revenue, while cost of properties will 
be charged to the profit or loss as cost of sales.
In 2023, cost of properties of HK$510 million (2022: HK$325 million) and deferred revenue of HK$507 million (2022: 
HK$320 million) were recognised to profit or loss.
19.	 Trade and Other Receivables
Accounting Policy
Trade and other receivables are recognised initially at transaction price and are subsequently stated at amortised cost  
using the effective interest method, less allowances for expected credit losses. The Group measures the loss 
allowance for its trade receivables at an amount equal to the lifetime expected credit losses. The amount of expected 
credit losses (or reversal) that is required to adjust the loss allowance at the reporting date to its recognised amount 
is recognised in profit or loss, as an impairment loss or a reversal of an impairment loss. Trade and other receivables 
are written off (either partially or in full) when there is no reasonable expectation of recovery.
Expected credit losses are a probability-weighted estimate of credit losses (i.e. the present value of all cash shortfalls) 
over the expected life of the trade receivables. Expected credit losses on trade receivables are calculated by using the 
provision matrix approach. Trade receivables are categorised by common risk characteristics that are representative 
of the customers’ abilities to pay all amounts due in accordance with the contractual terms. The provision matrix is 
determined based on historical observed default rates over the expected life of the trade receivables and is adjusted 
for forward-looking estimates. At every reporting date the historical observed default rates are updated and changes 
in the forward-looking estimates are analysed.
If there is no significant increase in credit risk since initial recognition, impairment on other receivables is measured at 
12-month expected credit losses. If a significant increase in credit risk has occurred, then impairment is measured as 
lifetime expected credit losses.

CLP Holdings 2023 Annual Report


19.	 Trade and Other Receivables (continued)
Critical Accounting Estimates and Judgements: Recoverability of Trade Receivables
Provision for expected credit losses is made when the Group does not expect to collect all amounts due. The provision 
is determined by grouping together trade debtors with similar risk characteristics and collectively or individually 
assessing them for likelihood of recovery. The provision reflects lifetime expected credit losses i.e. possible default 
events over the expected life of the trade receivables, weighted by the probability of that default occurring. 
Judgement has been applied in determining the level of provision for expected credit losses, taking into account the 
credit risk characteristics of customers and the likelihood of recovery assessed on a combination of collective and 
individual basis as relevant. While the provision is considered appropriate, changes in estimation basis or in economic 
conditions could lead to a change in the level of provision recorded and consequently on the charge or credit to profit 
or loss.

Credit risk management
The Group has no significant concentrations of credit risk with respect to the trade receivables in Hong Kong and Australia as their customer 
bases are widely dispersed in different sectors and industries. The Group has established credit policies for customers in each of its retail 
businesses.
In Hong Kong, electricity bills are due within two weeks after issuance. To limit the credit risk exposure, the Group has a policy to require 
cash deposits or bank guarantees from customers for an amount determined from time to time by reference to the usage of the customers, 
and in the normal course of events will not exceed the highest expected charge for 60 days. For all the deposits held, customers are paid at 
a floating market interest rate equivalent to the HSBC bank saving rate. At 31 December 2023, such cash deposits amounted to HK$6,880 
million (2022: HK$6,551 million) and the bank guarantees stood at HK$919 million (2022: HK$867 million). The customers’ deposits are 
treated on the statement of financial position as current liabilities on the basis that they are repayable on demand.
In Australia, customers are allowed to settle their electricity bills in no more than 45 days after issuance, while certain large commercial & 
industrial customers can range up to 60 days. EnergyAustralia has policies in place to ensure that sales of products and services are made to  
retail customers (including residential and commercial & industrial customers) of an appropriate credit quality. For residential customers 
however, where EnergyAustralia is the designated Financially Responsible Market Participant for electricity customers or Financially 
Responsible Organisation for gas customers, it is obliged to accept the customer, irrespective of their credit worthiness. In these instances, 
information obtained in relation to the customer’s credit worthiness is utilised for the purposes of risk segmentation and prioritisation of 
collection strategies to mitigate risk. Collectability is reviewed on an ongoing basis.
Trade receivables arising from sales of electricity to the offtakers in Mainland China, which are mainly state-owned enterprises, are due for 
settlement within 30 to 90 days after bills issuance. Management has closely monitored the credit qualities and the collectability of these 
trade receivables.
Expected credit losses
For trade receivables relating to accounts which are long overdue with significant amounts or known insolvencies or non-response to 
collection activities, they are assessed individually for impairment allowance. CLP Power and EnergyAustralia determine the provision for 
expected credit losses by grouping together trade receivables with similar credit risk characteristics and collectively assessing them for 
likelihood of recovery, taking into account prevailing economic conditions and forward looking assumptions.
CLP Power
CLP Power classifies its trade receivables by nature of customer accounts. These include active accounts and terminated accounts.

EnergyAustralia
EnergyAustralia categorises its trade receivables based on their ageing. EnergyAustralia recognises lifetime expected credit losses for 
receivables by assessing future cash flows for each group of trade receivables including a probability-weighted amount determined by 
evaluating a range of possible outcomes based on twelve month rolling historical credit loss experience by customer segment, geographical 
region, tenure and type of customer and applying that weighting to the receivables held at year end. The impact of economic factors, both 
current and future, is considered in assessing the likelihood of recovery from customers.

Mainland China
At 31 December 2023, the Group had total receivables of HK$2,426 million (2022: HK$2,111 million) relating to unpaid Renewable National 
Subsidies. The application, approval and settlement of the Renewable National Subsidy are governed by the relevant policies issued by the 
Central People’s Government. All of the relevant wind and solar projects are qualified for renewable energy subsidy in accordance with the 
prevailing government policies. Under normal operating cycle, it takes a relatively long time for settlement as the collection is subject to the 
allocation of funds by relevant government authorities to local grid companies and there is no due date for the settlement of Renewable 
National Subsidies. The expected credit loss is close to zero as continuous settlements have been noted with no history of default and the 
subsidy is funded by the Renewable Energy Development Fund set up and administered by the Ministry of Finance.
(b)	 At 31 December 2023, other receivables mainly represented EnergyAustralia’s futures margin account of HK$0.2 billion (2022: 
EnergyAustralia’s futures margin account of HK$3.4 billion and consideration receivable from the sale of Fangchenggang of HK$1.7 billion).
(c)	 The current accounts with joint ventures and an associate are unsecured, interest free and have no fixed repayment terms.

21.	 Fuel Clause Account
The cost of fuel consumed by CLP Power is passed on to the customers. Any variations between the actual cost of fuel 
and the fuel cost billed to customers are captured in the fuel clause account. The balance on the account (inclusive of 
interest) represents amounts over-recovered or under-recovered and is treated as an amount due to or from customers. 
CLP Power may adjust fuel related tariff from time to time, including on a monthly basis, in accordance with the SoC, to 
reflect changes in the cost of fuels consumed by the SoC Companies for the generation of electricity. At 31 December 
2023, the fuel clause account asset balance represented the right of CLP Power to collect the under-recovered fuel costs 
from the customers under the SoC.

CLP Holdings 2023 Annual Report


22.	 Trade Payables and Other Liabilities
Accounting Policy
(A)	 Trade and other payables
Trade and other payables are recognised initially at fair value and subsequently measured at amortised cost 
using the effective interest method.
(B)	 Lease liabilities
At the commencement date of the lease, the Group recognises lease liabilities measured at the present value of  
lease payments with reference to an expected lease term, which includes optional lease periods when the lessee 
is reasonably certain to exercise the option to extend or not to terminate the lease. The lease payments include 
fixed payments (including in substance fixed payments) less any lease incentives receivable; variable lease 
payments that depend on an index or a rate; and amounts expected to be paid under residual value guarantees. 
Variable lease payments that do not depend on an index or a rate are recognised as expenses (unless they are 
incurred to produce inventories) in the period in which the event or condition that triggers the payment occurs.
Lease payments are discounted using the interest rate implicit in the lease, if this cannot be readily determined, an 
 
incremental borrowing rate that the lessee would have to pay to borrow the funds necessary to obtain an asset 
of a similar value to the right-of-use asset in a similar economic environment, over a similar term and with a  
similar security. Lease liabilities are subsequently measured by increasing the carrying amounts to reflect interest 
on the lease liabilities (using the effective interest method) and by reducing the carrying amounts to reflect the 
lease payments made. Lease liabilities are remeasured (with a corresponding adjustment made to the related 
right-of-use asset) when there is a change in future lease payments in case of renegotiation, changes of an index 
or rate or in case of reassessment of options under certain conditions.

advances are denominated in Hong Kong dollar.
(d)	 The amounts payable to joint ventures and an associate are unsecured, interest free and have no fixed repayment terms.
(e)	 Deferred revenue included the non-refundable upfront payment for the property development at Argyle Street of HK$2.2 billion (2022: 
HK$2.7 billion) (Note 18) and payments received in advance for other services. Non-current deferred revenue of HK$1,457 million (2022: 
HK$1,474 million) was included under other non-current liabilities.
23.	 Bank Loans and Other Borrowings
Accounting Policy
Borrowings are recognised initially at fair value of proceeds received, net of transaction costs incurred. Transaction 
costs are incremental costs that are directly attributable to the acquisition or issue of a financial liability. Borrowings 
are subsequently stated at amortised cost and, if included as a hedged item in a fair value hedge relationship, are 
revalued to reflect the fair value movements on the associated hedged risk. Any difference between the proceeds  
(net of transaction costs) and the redemption value is amortised to profit or loss or capitalised as cost of the 
qualifying assets over the period of the borrowings using the effective interest method. Borrowings are classified as 
current liabilities unless the Group has an unconditional right to defer settlement of the liability for at least 12 months 
after the end of the reporting period.
The Group’s bank loans and other borrowings at 31 December were repayable as follows:

23.	 Bank Loans and Other Borrowings (continued)
Bank loans for subsidiaries in Mainland China of HK$4,893 million (2022: HK$5,085 million) are secured by rights of 
receipt of tariff and by fixed assets and land use rights with carrying amounts of HK$9,145 million (2022: HK$9,574 
million).
At 31 December 2023 and 2022, all of the Group’s borrowings are either in the functional currencies of the 
corresponding Group entities or hedged into those currencies.
At 31 December 2023, the Group had undrawn bank loans and overdraft facilities of HK$30.9 billion (2022: HK$31.6 
billion).
An analysis of borrowings by currencies is shown in “Financial Review” on page 36 of the Annual Report.
24.	 Deferred Tax
Accounting Policy
Deferred tax is provided in full, using the liability method, on temporary differences arising between the tax bases of  
assets and liabilities and their carrying amounts in the consolidated financial statements. However, deferred tax is  
not accounted for if it arises from initial recognition of an asset or liability in a transaction other than a business 
combination that at the time of the transaction affects neither accounting nor taxable profit or loss and does not give 
rise to equal taxable and deductible temporary differences. Deferred tax is determined using tax rates (and laws) that 
have been enacted or substantively enacted by the end of the reporting period and are expected to apply when the 
related deferred tax asset is realised or the deferred tax liability is settled. Deferred tax assets are recognised to the 
extent that it is probable that future taxable profit will be available against which the temporary differences can be 
utilised. Deferred tax is also provided on temporary differences arising on investments in subsidiaries, joint ventures 
and associates, except where the timing of the reversal of the temporary difference is controlled by the Group and it 
is probable that the temporary difference will not reverse in the foreseeable future.
Deferred tax assets and liabilities are netted off when the taxes relate to the same tax authority and where offsetting 
is legally enforceable. The following amounts, determined after appropriate offsetting, are shown separately on the 
consolidated statement of financial position:

25.	 SoC Reserve Accounts
Critical Accounting Estimates and Judgements: Classification of SoC-related Accounts
As stipulated in the SoC, the balances in the Tariff Stabilisation Fund and the Rate Reduction Reserve shall represent 
liabilities in the financial statements of CLP Power and shall not accrue to the benefit of its shareholders save as 
provided for by the SoC. The Group considers that CLP Power is required under the SoC to discharge its obligations 
arising from the SoC upon the expiry of the SoC Agreement such that these account balances meet the definition of a 
liability.
Tariff Stabilisation Fund, Rate Reduction Reserve and Rent and Rates Refunds of the Group’s major subsidiary, CLP 
Power, are collectively referred to as SoC reserve accounts. The respective balances at the end of the year are:

Notes:
(a)	 Under the SoC Agreement, if the gross tariff revenue in a period is less than or exceeds the total of the SoC operating costs, permitted 
return and taxation charges, such deficiency shall be deducted from, or such excess shall be added to, the Tariff Stabilisation Fund. In  
any period, the amount of deduction from or addition to the Tariff Stabilisation Fund is recognised as a revenue adjustment to the 
extent that the return and charges under the SoC are recognised in the profit or loss.
(b)	 Under the SoC, a periodic charge to accrue for asset decommissioning is made with corresponding deferred liabilities recognised in the 
statement of financial position of the SoC Companies. The balance of the asset decommissioning liabilities account of HK$1,575 million 
(2022: HK$1,463 million) (Note 26) recognised under the SoC represents a liability of the Group.
(c)	 During the year, a special energy saving rebate of HK¢9.3 per unit was provided to customers with consumption units in their tariff bills 
not exceeding certain specified levels. In 2022, a special rebate of HK¢2.1 per unit was made to all customers of CLP Power.

(C)	 Rent and Rates Refunds
In settlement of the appeals against the amounts of Government rent and rates levied for the assessment years from 
2001 / 02 to 2021 / 22, CLP Power had received refunds totalling HK$3,031 million from the Hong Kong Government. 
Using the total amount of refunds received, CLP Power provided customers with the Rent and Rates Special Rebate. 
At 31 December 2023, all the rent and rates refunds received have been provided to customers through the Rent 
and Rates Special Rebate.
The refunds are classified within the SoC reserve accounts. The Rent and Rates Special Rebate paid to customers 
was offset against the refunds received.
26.	 Asset Decommissioning Liabilities and Retirement Obligations
Accounting Policy
When the Group has a legal and / or constructive obligation for remediation and the likelihood of economic outflow is  
probable, provisions for asset retirement obligations are recorded for estimated remediation costs of reclamation, 
plant closure, dismantling and waste disposal. A provision for asset retirement costs is determined by estimating  
the expected costs associated to remediate the site based on the current legal requirements and technologies and is  
discounted to its present value with an unwind adjustment recognised in finance costs. An asset is recognised on 
initial recognition of the provision and is depreciated over the useful life of the facility. The asset retirement costs are 
reviewed annually and adjustments are made to the carrying amount of the assets to reflect changes made to these 
estimated discount rates or future costs.
Critical Accounting Estimates and Judgements
Estimating the amount and timing of the obligation to be recorded requires significant judgement. Management has 
assessed the Group’s obligations for each asset based on the local regulatory environment and expected closure 
dates.
CLP Power has been investing in the transmission and distribution network to supply electricity to the customers in its  
supply area in Hong Kong. As CLP Power expects that the land sites being used for the transmission and distribution 
network will continue to be used for the distribution of electricity supply to its customers, it is currently considered 
remote that the network would be removed from the existing land sites. Therefore in accordance with applicable 
accounting standards, asset retirement obligations for these assets have not been recognised by CLP Power.

26.	 Asset Decommissioning Liabilities and Retirement Obligations (continued)
Critical Accounting Estimates and Judgements (continued)
As agreed with the Hong Kong Government, CAPCO is retiring the coal-fired generation units at Castle Peak “A” 
Station (CPA) when they reach the end of their useful lives between 2022 to 2025. Following this retirement, the  
removal of CPA’s coal-fired generation units has become probable. In support of the Government’s net-zero carbon 
emissions targets in the “Hong Kong’s Climate Action Plan 2050”, CAPCO is working on the phasing-out of the use of  
coal for daily electricity generation in Castle Peak “B” Station and exploring the ways to convert its gas-fired 
generation facilities to operate on green fuels. While it is envisaged that these remaining generation units will 
have their roles in supporting the Government’s Climate Action Plan 2050, with the continuous development in 
decarbonisation technologies, the removal of these units and replacement by alternative facilities is possible. Under 
the SoC, CAPCO makes a periodic charge to accrue in the statement of financial position a liability balance to be 
utilised in discharging asset decommissioning costs if and when incurred. CAPCO considers that the dismantling 
obligation for the CPA units is covered under the asset decommissioning liability accrued under the SoC at 31 
December 2023. While no provision for asset retirement obligations for the other generation units of CAPCO has 
been recognised, it is expected that if such an obligation be incurred, it will be met by the liability accrued and the cost 
recovery mechanism under the SoC.
Asset retirement obligations of EnergyAustralia at 31 December 2023 amounted to HK$3,544 million (2022: 
HK$2,982 million) which mainly related to the provision for land remediation and decommissioning of generation 
assets. The provisions are largely based on estimates by external and internal experts that are discounted using 
internally determined end of plant lives. The calculation of the provision requires management judgement with 
respect to estimating the timing of asset removal, costs to remove infrastructure, remediate soil and groundwater, 
water usage and technological developments. The terms associated with the decommissioning of certain assets 
including site restoration plans are expected to evolve as plans are refined and agreed with the relevant bodies when 
approaching plant closure dates. Any future agreements with regulators or changes to regulatory requirements could 
impact the cost estimates used in the decommissioning provision. On an ongoing basis, we continually review and 
update underlying assumptions relating to future rehabilitation estimates and timelines.

29.	 Perpetual Capital Securities and Other Non-controlling Interests
(A)	 Perpetual Capital Securities
A total of US$500 million perpetual capital securities was issued by the wholly-owned subsidiary, CLP Power HK 
Finance Ltd. in 2019. The securities are perpetual, non-callable in the first 5.25 years (with issuer call option at par 
at any time in the 3 months before 5 February 2025) and entitle the holders to receive distributions at a distribution 
rate of 3.55% per annum in the first 5.25 years, floating thereafter and with fixed step up margins at year 10.25 and 
at year 25.25, payable semi-annually in arrears, cumulative and compounding. The distributions are at the Group’s 
discretion, as long as the issuer and CLP Power, as guarantor of the securities, do not (a) declare or pay dividends to 
their shareholders or (b) cancel or reduce their share capitals within each distribution payment period.

29.	 Perpetual Capital Securities and Other Non-controlling Interests (continued)
(B)	 Other Non-controlling Interests
Other non-controlling interests included CSGHK’s pro-rata share of HK$5,115 million (2022: HK$5,115 million) of 
redeemable shareholder capital of CAPCO. The redeemable shareholder capital is subordinated, unsecured, interest 
free and has no fixed terms of repayment. CAPCO can, at its sole discretion, redeem all or part of the redeemable 
shareholder capital at any time after 31 December 2032.

(B)	 The Group has entered into a long-term Energy Storage Services Agreement (ESSA) to be the market operator 
of the 250MW Kidston pumped hydro energy storage facility in Queensland. This facility is currently under 
construction and the ESSA is subject to a number of conditions precedent which must be satisfied before the lease 
commencement date, which is expected to occur before 31 December 2025. At 31 December 2023, the expected 
undiscounted contractual lease payments under this agreement were approximately HK$2.0 billion (2022: HK$1.9 
billion).
(C)	 Equity contributions to be made for joint ventures and private equity partnerships at 31 December 2023 were 
HK$187 million (2022: HK$199 million) and HK$77 million (2022: HK$163 million) respectively.
32.	 Related Party Transactions
Accounting Policy
Related parties are individuals and companies, including subsidiaries, fellow subsidiaries, joint ventures, associates 
and key management personnel, where the individual or company has the ability, directly or indirectly, to control or 
jointly control the other party or exercise significant influence over the other party in making financial and operating 
decisions. A close family member of any such individual is considered to be a related party.
Related Parties ≠ Connected Parties
They sometimes overlap but should not be confused. Accounting standards define related parties, while the 
Listing Rules of the Hong Kong Stock Exchange define connected parties.
Below are the more significant transactions with related parties for the year:
(A)	 CLP Power has arrangements with GNPJVC and its shareholder, Guangdong Nuclear Investment Company Limited,  
to purchase nuclear electricity from Guangdong Daya Bay Nuclear Power Station (GNPS). The base price paid by  
CLP Power for electricity generated by GNPS is determined by a formula based on GNPS’s operating costs and a  
calculation of profits with reference to the capacity factors. The purchase of nuclear electricity under the arrangements 
was HK$6,632 million (2022: HK$6,660 million).
(B)	 The loans to joint ventures and related interest income are disclosed under Notes 14 and 6. Other amounts due from  
and to the related parties at 31 December 2023 are disclosed in Notes 19 and 22 respectively. At 31 December 2023, 
 
the Group did not have any guarantees which were of a significant amount given to or received from these entities 
(2022: nil).

(b)	 Refer to remuneration items on page 163 of Human Resources & Remuneration Committee Report.
At 31 December 2023, the CLP Holdings’ Board was composed of thirteen Non-executive Directors and two 
Executive Directors. Remuneration of all Directors for the year totalled HK$45 million (2022: HK$42 million). The 
five highest paid individuals in the Group during the year included two Directors (2022: one Director), two members 
of Senior Management and one former senior executive of the Group who retired in 2023 (2022: two members of 
Senior Management and two other senior executives). The total remuneration of these five highest paid individuals 
amounted to HK$85 million (2022: HK$93 million). Further details of the remuneration of the Director and Senior 
Management, on a named basis, and remuneration paid to the five highest paid individuals by bands are disclosed in  
highlighted sections of the Human Resources & Remuneration Committee Report with a heading of “Audited” on 
pages 162 to 165 and 171 to 173. These sections are part of the financial statements.
(D)	 Interest of Directors
There are no loans, quasi-loans or other dealings in favour of directors, their controlled body corporates and 
connected entities (2022: nil).
During the year and at the year end, no director of the Company had or has a material interest, directly or indirectly, 
in any significant transactions, arrangements and contracts in relation to the Group’s business to which the Group 
was or is a party (2022: nil).

Financial Risk Factors
The Group’s activities expose it to a variety of financial risks: market risk (including foreign exchange risk, fair value and 
cash flow interest rate risks, and energy portfolio risk), credit risk and liquidity risk. The Group’s overall risk management 
programme focuses on the unpredictability of financial markets and seeks to minimise the impact of exchange rate, 
interest rate and energy price fluctuations on the Group’s financial performance. The Group uses different derivative 
financial instruments to manage its exposure in these areas. All derivative financial instruments are employed solely for 
hedging purposes.
Risk management for Hong Kong operations is carried out by the Group’s central treasury department (Group Treasury) 
under policies approved by the Board of Directors or the Finance & General Committee of relevant Group entities. 
Overseas subsidiaries conduct their risk management activities in accordance with policies approved by their respective 
Boards. Group Treasury identifies, evaluates and monitors financial risks in close co-operation with the Group’s operating 
units. The Group has written policies covering specific areas, such as foreign exchange risk, interest rate risk, credit risk, 
use of derivative financial instruments and cash management.
Foreign exchange risk
The Group operates in the Asia-Pacific region and is exposed to foreign exchange risk arising from future commercial 
transactions, and from recognised assets and liabilities and net investments in foreign operations. This is primarily with 
respect to Australian dollar and Renminbi. Additionally, the Group has significant foreign currency obligations relating 
to its foreign currency denominated debts and major capital project payments, US dollar denominated nuclear power 
purchase offtake commitments and other fuel related payments. The Group uses forward contracts and currency swaps  
to manage its foreign exchange risk arising from future commercial transactions, and from recognised assets and 
liabilities which are denominated in a currency that is not the functional currency of the respective Group entity. Hedging 
is only considered for firm commitments and highly probable forecast transactions.
SoC Companies
Under the SoC, the SoC Companies are allowed to pass-through foreign exchange gains and losses arising from future 
non-capital projects related commercial transactions and recognised liabilities which are denominated in a currency other 
than Hong Kong dollar, thus retaining no significant foreign exchange risk of such payments over the long term. The SoC  
Companies use forward contracts and currency swaps to hedge all their debt repayment obligations denominated in 
foreign currencies for the full tenor, and a significant portion of their US dollar obligations on fuel and nuclear power 
purchases, provided that for US dollar the hedging can be accomplished at rates below the Hong Kong Government’s 
historical target peg rate of HK$7.8: US$1. The objective is to reduce the potential impact of foreign exchange movement 
on electricity tariffs. The SoC Companies also use forward contracts to manage the foreign exchange risks arising from 
non-Hong Kong dollar payment obligations for major capital projects, for which the exchange gains and losses are 
capitalised.
At the end of the reporting period, the fair value movement of the derivative financial instruments in a cash flow hedge 
relationship is recorded in equity. The extent of the impact to the cash flow hedge reserve under equity due to exchange 
rate movements, with all other variables held constant, is as follows:

Foreign exchange risk (continued)
The Group’s Asia-Pacific Investments
With respect to the power project investments in the Asia-Pacific region, the Group is exposed to both foreign currency 
translation and transaction risks.
The Group closely monitors translation risk using a Value-at-Risk (VaR) approach but does not hedge foreign currency 
translation risk because translation gains or losses do not affect the project company’s cash flow or the Group’s annual 
profit until an investment is sold. At 31 December 2023, the Group’s net investment subject to translation exposure 
was HK$46,272 million (2022: HK$52,619 million), arising mainly from our investments in Mainland China, Australia, 
India, and Taiwan Region and Thailand. This means that, for each 1% (2022: 1%) average foreign currency movement, 
our translation exposure will vary by about HK$463 million (2022: HK$526 million). All the translation exposures are 
recognised in other comprehensive income and therefore have no impact on the profit or loss.
We consider that the non-functional currency transaction exposures at the individual project company level, if not 
managed properly, can lead to significant financial distress. Our primary risk mitigation is therefore to ensure that 
project-level debt financings are implemented on a local currency basis to the maximum extent possible. Each overseas 
subsidiary and project company has developed its own hedging programme into local currency taking into consideration 
any indexing provision in project agreements, tariff reset mechanisms, lender requirements, and tax and accounting 
implications.
Most foreign currency exposures of the Group entities are hedged and / or their transactions are predominantly 
conducted through the functional currency of the respective entity. The following analysis presents the Group’s (apart 
from the SoC Companies) sensitivity to a reasonably possible change in the functional currencies of the Group entities 
against the US dollar and Renminbi, with all other variables held constant. The sensitivity rates in US dollar and Renminbi 
used are considered reasonable given the current level of exchange rates and the volatility observed in the different 
functional currencies of the Group entities. These are both on a historical basis and market expectations for future 
movement at the end of the reporting period and under the economic environments in which the Group operates. The 
extent of the impact to post-tax profit or equity due to exchange rate movements of US dollar and Renminbi against 
different functional currencies of Group entities, with all other variables held constant, is as follows:

Financial Risk Factors (continued)
Energy portfolio risk
EnergyAustralia’s activity in energy markets exposes it to financial risk.
The electricity market is a competitive power pool. In this market generation supply and retail demand are exposed to 
spot (5-minute intervals) prices. EnergyAustralia purchases and sells majority of its electricity through the pool, at the 
same time EnergyAustralia enters into electricity spot-price-linked derivative financial instruments to manage the spot 
electricity price risk against forecast retail and generation exposures.
The gas market is a balancing market. To meet retail demand, EnergyAustralia procures gas supply agreements from 
various gas producers. The contract prices of certain agreements comprise a fixed component, and a variable component 
that is linked to oil spot prices on the global markets. EnergyAustralia enters into oil-price-linked derivative financial 
instruments to manage this oil price risk component.
Energy portfolio exposure is managed through an established risk management framework. The framework consists of  
policies which place appropriate limits on overall energy market exposures, hedging strategies and targets, delegations of 
 
authority on trading, approved product lists, regular exposure reporting, and segregation of duties. The corporate 
governance process also includes oversight by an Audit & Risk Committee (ARC-EA) which acts on behalf of 
EnergyAustralia’s Board.
Risk monitoring includes physical position reporting, stress testing of the portfolios and “at-risk” analyses of potential 
earnings. At-risk measures are derived by modelling potential variability in spot and forward market prices and supply 
and demand volumes, across the wholesale energy portfolio, through Monte Carlo simulations, historic simulations, and 
scenarios. Overall Earnings-at-Risk (EaR) exposure for the coming financial year is reported as the 1 in 20 probability 
downside (2022: 1 in 20 probability downside) of the expected earnings distribution, as simulated with the above 
methods. The energy portfolio risk exposure for EnergyAustralia at 31 December 2023 was HK$156 million (2022: 
HK$651 million).
Interest rate risk
The Group’s interest rate risk arises from borrowings. Borrowings issued at variable rates expose the Group to cash flow 
interest rate risk, and borrowings issued at fixed rates expose the Group to fair value interest rate risk. The risks are 
managed by monitoring an appropriate mix between fixed and floating rate borrowings, and by the use of interest rate 
swaps.
The appropriate level of the fixed / floating mix is determined for each operating company subject to a regular review. 
For instance, SoC Companies conducts an annual review to determine a preferred fixed / floating interest rate mix 
appropriate for its business profile. Each overseas subsidiary and project company has developed its own hedging 
programme taking into consideration project debt service sensitivities to interest rate movements, lender requirements, 
tax and accounting implications.
The sensitivity analysis below presents the effects on the Group’s post-tax profit for the year (as a result of change in 
interest expense on floating rate borrowings) and equity (as a result of change in the fair value of derivative instruments 
which qualify as cash flow hedges). Such amounts accumulated in equity are reclassified to profit or loss in the periods 
when the hedged items affect profit or loss, and offset one another in the profit or loss.
The analysis has been determined based on the exposure to interest rates for both derivative and non-derivative financial 
 
instruments at the end of the reporting period. For floating rate borrowings, the analysis is prepared assuming the 
amount of liability outstanding at the end of the reporting period was outstanding for the whole year. The sensitivity to 
interest rates used is considered reasonable given the market forecasts available at the end of the reporting period and 
under the economic environments in which the Group operates, with all other variables held constant.

Credit risk
The Group’s approach to managing credit risk for trade receivables is discussed in Note 19.
On the treasury side, all finance-related hedging transactions and bank deposits of the Group entities are made with 
counterparties with good credit quality in conformance to the Group treasury policies to minimise credit exposure. Good 
credit ratings from reputable credit rating agencies and scrutiny of the financial position of non-rated counterparties are 
two important criteria in the selection of counterparties. The credit quality of counterparties will be closely monitored 
over the life of the transaction. The Group further assigns mark-to-market limits to its financial counterparties to reduce  
credit risk concentrations relative to the underlying size and credit strength of each counterparty. The Group also 
monitors potential exposures to each financial institution counterparty. All derivatives transactions are entered into at the 
sole credit of the respective subsidiaries, joint ventures and associates without recourse to the Company.
Liquidity risk
Prudent liquidity risk management implies maintaining sufficient cash and making available an adequate amount of 
committed credit facilities with staggered maturities to reduce refinancing risk in any year and to fund working capital, 
debt servicing, dividend payments, new investments and close out market positions if required. The Group maintains 
significant flexibility to respond to opportunities and events by ensuring that committed credit lines are available to meet 
future funding requirements. In addition, CLP Power will fund its committed contractual maturities through cash flows 
earned under the terms of the SoC and financing available under its credit lines and MTN programme. Management also 
monitors rolling forecasts of the Group’s undrawn borrowing facilities and cash and cash equivalents on the expected 
cash flows.

Financial Risk Factors (continued)
Liquidity risk (continued)
Cash flow forecasting at least for next 12 months of the Group is performed by Group Treasury. It monitors rolling forecasts  
of the Group’s liquidity requirements to ensure it has sufficient cash to meet operational, financing and investing needs 
while maintaining sufficient headroom on its undrawn committed borrowing facilities at all times to guard against 
contingency and uncertainty with consideration that the Group does not breach borrowing limits or covenants (where 
applicable) on any of its borrowing facilities. Such forecasting takes into consideration the Group’s debt financing plans, 
applicable financial ratios, covenant compliance, applicable external regulatory or legal requirements, and potential market 
impacts arising from unforeseeable events such as currency restrictions.
The table below analyses the remaining contractual maturities at the end of the reporting period of the Group’s non-
derivative financial liabilities, derivative financial liabilities (both net settled and gross settled) and derivative financial 
assets (gross settled) based on the contractual undiscounted cash flows.

Hedge Accounting
The Group seeks to apply, wherever possible, hedge accounting to present its financial statements in accordance with  
the economic purpose of the hedging activity. The Group determines the economic relationship between the hedged 
items and the hedging instruments by reviewing their critical terms. As a result, the Group concludes that the risk being  
hedged for the hedged items and the risk inherent in the hedging instruments are sufficiently aligned. There is no inherent  
mismatch in the hedging relationships. Certain ineffectiveness can arise during the hedging process. The main sources 
of hedge ineffectiveness are considered to be the effects of re-designation of the hedging relationships and the 
counterparty credit risks on the hedging instruments.
Hedges on debt related transactions
The Group applies various types of derivative financial instruments (forward foreign currency contracts, cross currency 
interest rate swaps and interest rate swaps) to mitigate exposures arising from the fluctuations in foreign currencies and / or  
interest rates of debt. In most of the cases, the hedging instruments have a one-to-one hedge ratio with the hedged 
items. In view of the nature of the hedging activities, no significant ineffectiveness is expected at inception.
Hedges on non-debt related transactions
The SoC Companies use forward contracts to manage its foreign exchange risk arising from fuel and nuclear purchases 
obligations, and payments for major capital projects. The SoC Companies hedge a high portion of committed and highly 
probable forecast transactions.
EnergyAustralia uses electricity spot-price-linked forward contracts and oil-price-linked forward contracts to mitigate 
exposures arising from the fluctuations in electricity spot price and oil spot price embedded in gas contracts. In most of 
the cases, the hedging instruments have a one-to-one hedge ratio with the hedged items.

Fair Value Estimation and Hierarchy of Financial Instruments
The fair value of financial instruments traded in active markets (such as publicly traded derivatives) is based on quoted 
market prices at the end of the reporting period.
The fair value of financial instruments that are not traded in an active market (for example, over-the-counter derivatives) 
is determined by using appropriate valuation techniques and making assumptions that are based on market conditions 
existing at the end of each reporting period.
For the Group’s financial instruments that are not measured at fair value, their carrying values approximate their fair 
values.
Financial instruments measured at fair value are analysed into the following fair value measurement hierarchy:
Level 1 – 
quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities
Level 2 – 
inputs, other than quoted prices included within Level 1, that are observable for the asset or liability, either 
directly (that is, as prices) or indirectly (that is, derived from prices)
Level 3 – 
inputs for the asset or liability that are not based on observable market data (that is, unobservable inputs)
(A)	 Fair value hierarchy

Fair Value Estimation and Hierarchy of Financial Instruments (continued)
(A)	 Fair value hierarchy (continued)
The Group’s policy is to recognise transfers into / out of fair value hierarchy levels at the date of the event or change 
in circumstances that caused the transfer. During 2023 and 2022, there were no transfers between Level 1 and  
Level 2.
(B)	 Valuation techniques used to determine fair values
The valuation techniques and inputs used in the fair value measurements within Level 2 and Level 3 are as follows:
Financial Instruments
Valuation Techniques
Significant Inputs
 
 
 
Investments at fair value through  
profit or loss
Recent arm’s length 
transactions or net

Energy contracts
Discounted cash flow
Brokers’ quotes and observable exchange traded swap and  
cap price curves; and long-term forward electricity price  
and cap price curves
The significant unobservable inputs of energy contracts used for fair value measurement included long-term forward 
electricity price and cap price curve. The finance department of EnergyAustralia includes a team that performs the 
valuations of non-property assets required for financial reporting purposes, including Level 3 fair values. This team 
reports directly to EnergyAustralia’s Chief Financial Officer (CFO-EA) and ARC-EA. The valuation of Level 3 forward 
energy contracts involves the use of a short-term forward curve which is observable in the liquid market and an 
internally generated long-term forward electricity price and cap price curve which is derived using unobservable 
inputs. This short-term forward curve is reviewed at least once every six months, in line with the Group’s half-yearly 
reporting dates. Review of the long-term forward curve is performed by the CFO-EA and ARC-EA annually due to the 
lack of market liquidity. Analysis of fair value changes is performed on a monthly basis for reasonableness.

4.	
Offsetting Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities (continued)
Notes:
(a)	 Under HKFRS, amounts cannot be offset if the rights of set-off are conditional on a future event (e.g. default of payment). “Net amount” 
column represents the net impact that would be shown on the consolidated statement of financial position if all set-off rights (e.g. master 
netting arrangements, collateral arrangements, etc.) were exercised. At 31 December 2023, these items include (1) trade receivables related 
to Hong Kong electricity business where customers’ deposits are served as security for payments; and (2) bank loans and other borrowings of 
subsidiaries in Mainland China which are secured by charges over trade receivables or rights to income.
(b)	 For derivative financial instruments, the Group enters into derivative transactions under International Swaps and Derivatives Association 
(ISDA) master agreements in which there is a set-off provision. Under certain circumstances, for example, when a credit event such as a 
default occurs, all outstanding transactions under the agreement are terminated, a termination value is then assessed and only a single net  
amount is payable in settlement of all transactions. The ISDA agreements do not meet the criteria for offsetting in the consolidated 
statement of financial position since the Group does not have any currently legally enforceable right to offset recognised amounts. The right 
to offset is enforceable only on the occurrence of future events such as a default on the bank transactions or other credit events.
5.	
Capital Management
The primary objective of the Group’s capital management is to safeguard the Group’s ability to continue as a going 
concern, maintain a strong credit rating and a healthy capital ratio to support the business and to enhance shareholder 
value.
The Group manages its capital structure and fine-tunes it in light of changes in economic conditions and business 
strategies. To maintain or adjust the capital structure, the Group may adjust the dividend payments to shareholders, 
issue new shares or change the level of debts. The Group’s capital management objectives, policies or processes were 
unchanged during 2023 and 2022.
The Group monitors capital using “total debt to total capital” and “net debt to total capital” ratios. These ratios are as 
follows:
2023
2022
HK$M
HK$M
 
 
 
Total debt (a)

Total debt to total capital (based on total debt) ratio (%)
33.7
33.7
Net debt to total capital (based on net debt) ratio (%)
31.6
32.0
 
 
Decrease in the net debt to total capital was driven by lower net debt from strong operating cash inflows in 2023.
Certain entities of the Group are subject to loan covenants. For both 2023 and 2022, there is no material non-compliance 
with those loan covenants.
Notes:
(a)	 Total debt equals bank loans and other borrowings.
(b)	 Net debt equals total debt less bank balances, cash and other liquid funds.
(c)	 Total equity equals equity plus advances from non-controlling interests.
(d)	 Total capital (based on total debt) equals total debt plus total equity.
(e)	 Total capital (based on net debt) equals net debt plus total equity.

the outlying islands. CLP Power owns the transmission and distribution network.
Since financial year 1964, the electricity-related operations of CLP Power and CAPCO (the SoC Companies) have been governed 
by a Scheme of Control (SoC) Agreement with the Hong Kong Government. The SoC specifies the SoC Companies’ obligations to  
supply adequate and reliable electricity supplies to customers at the lowest reasonable cost and the mechanism for the Hong 
Kong Government to monitor their financial affairs and operating performance. In return, CLP Power is allowed to charge 
tariffs designed to recover the operating costs (including tax) and allowed net return of the SoC Companies.
The current SoC took effect from 1 October 2018 and covers a term of over 15 years ending on 31 December 2033. The SoC 
contains a provision to give the SoC Companies protection for stranded costs, which may arise as a result of future changes 
to the market structure which adversely impact on the SoC Companies’ ability to recover and to earn returns on existing 
investments made in good faith in accordance with the SoC. These costs will include the costs of investments, fuel and power 
purchase agreements previously approved by the Hong Kong Government. If stranded costs arise after the SoC Companies 
have implemented mitigation measures reasonably required by the Hong Kong Government, the SoC Companies are entitled to  
recover them from the market, consistent with international practice. Three years before market changes are introduced, the  
SoC Companies and the Hong Kong Government will agree on the amount of stranded costs and the mechanism for their 
recovery by the SoC Companies.
Tariff Setting Mechanism
For each year, CLP Power designs the total tariff it charges to cover the SoC Companies’ operating costs and allowed net 
return. The total tariff consists of the following components:
(i)	
basic tariff rate which is derived by taking into account the annual forecast of (a), (b) and (c) below, using the formula  
“(a-b) / c”:
(a)	 the allowed net return and operating costs including the standard cost of fuels; generation, transmission, distribution 
and administration expenses; depreciation; interest expenses; and taxes;
(b)	 80% of the profit on electricity sales to Mainland China; and
(c)	 local unit sales as determined by the load forecast.
(ii)	 fuel clause charge or rebate (Fuel Cost Adjustment) which represents the difference between the cost of fuels (including 
natural gas, coal and oil) and the standard cost recovered through the basic tariff rate. The Fuel Cost Adjustment may 
be adjusted from time to time, including on a monthly basis, to reflect changes in the cost of fuels consumed by the SoC 
Companies for the generation of electricity.
Any difference between the actual profit for SoC operations and the permitted return for the year is transferred to or from a 
Tariff Stabilisation Fund. The Tariff Stabilisation Fund does not form part of distributable shareholders’ funds and represents 
a liability in the accounts of CLP Power. A charge on the average balance of the Tariff Stabilisation Fund is credited to a Rate 
Reduction Reserve in the accounts of CLP Power, which balance as at the end of each year is to be transferred to the Tariff 
Stabilisation Fund in the following year.

Permitted and Net Return
The permitted and net return that the SoC Companies are allowed under the SoC are calculated as follows:
	 The annual permitted return under the SoC is 8% of the SoC Companies’ average net fixed assets.
	 The net return under the SoC is the permitted return after the deduction or adjustment of the following items:
(a)	 interest up to a maximum of 7% per annum on borrowed capital arranged for financing fixed assets;
(b)	 a charge of the average one-month Hong Kong Interbank Offered Rate on the average balance of the Tariff Stabilisation 
Fund under the SoC, which is credited to the Rate Reduction Reserve;
(c)	 an excess capacity adjustment of 8% less an allowed interest charge up to 7% per annum on the average related excess 
capacity expenditure;
(d)	 interest up to 7% per annum on the increase in average balance of the customers’ deposits in excess of the balance as at 
30 September 1998; and
(e)	 performance-linked incentives / penalties adjustments
Category
% incentives (+) / penalties (-)
 
 
Operation performance related incentives / penalties
in the range of -0.05% to +0.05% on average net fixed assets
Energy efficiency and renewable performance incentives
	 a maximum of 0.315% on average net fixed assets
	 incentive of 10% of renewable energy certificates sales revenue
	 five-year energy saving and renewable energy connections incentives with 
a maximum of 0.11% on the average net fixed assets at the final year of 
the five-year period
Demand response reduction incentive
a maximum of 0.025% on average net fixed assets
Large-scale electricity supply interruption penalty 
(effective from 2024)
a maximum of 0.03% on average net fixed assets for each single large-scale 
electricity supply interruption incident
The net return is divided between the SoC Companies in accordance with the provisions of the agreements between the SoC 
Companies. These provisions state that each company will receive that proportion of the total net return represented by the 
net return that company would receive if it were the only company under the SoC and the net return were calculated solely on 
the basis of its own financial statements.
Under the SoC, 65% of the energy efficiency incentives earned by the SoC Companies are to be contributed to a CLP 
Community Energy Saving Fund (CESF) to support programmes in promotion of energy efficiency, use of renewable energy, 
the disadvantaged groups and other programmes as agreed with the Hong Kong Government. In addition, a new mechanism 
to provide additional financial support (special tariff relief) by the SoC Companies in the event of severe international fuel crisis 
capped at HK$180 million has become effective from 2024 to help targeted residential customers most in need of support.
The calculations shown on next page are in accordance with the SoC and the agreements between the SoC Companies.

Advanced Metering Infrastructure 
(AMI)
AMI functions like a sensor overlay on the power grid. It provides greater 
visibility of the power grid conditions and detects power network 
irregularities, thus enhancing supply reliability. AMI enables power 
companies to provide timely electricity usage information to their customers, 
empowering them to manage their consumption efficiently.
Air emissions
The emission of air pollutants such as sulphur dioxide (SO2), nitrogen oxides 
(NOx) and particulate matter (PM).
Availability
The fraction of a given operating period in which a generating unit is 
available without outages and capacity reductions. Also known as Equivalent 
Availability Factor.
Behind-the-meter
Behind-the-meter assets are controllable electrical devices that help drive 
renewable technology through to customers, whether located inside or 
outside a home or business. Examples include electric hot water heaters, 
solar panels, batteries and electric vehicles.
Capacity purchase
Additional third-party owned power generation capacity contracted by CLP 
under long-term agreements to meet customer demand. Some of these 
agreements may confer CLP rights to use the generation assets and exercise 
dispatch control as if they belonged to the Group.
Carbon neutral
The condition in which greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions associated with an 
activity or entity’s carbon footprint are reduced as much as possible and 
any remaining hard-to-abate emissions are counterbalanced by offsetting 
through measures such as the use of carbon credits, carbon sinks or storage.
Circular economy
Generally defined as a framework that can address the global challenges 
of climate change, biodiversity loss, waste and pollution, which is achieved 
through three principles – eliminating waste and pollution, circulating 
products and materials at their highest value and regenerating nature.  
Embracing the circular economy, a utility company can contribute to 
the transition to a more sustainable and resilient energy and resource 
management system by adopting cleaner technologies, promoting resource 
efficiency and investing in nature conservation.
Climate Action Finance Framework 
(CAFF)
Launched in 2017, CAFF supports the transition to a low-carbon economy 
by attracting socially responsible, sustainable financing to fund CLP’s 
investments to reduce carbon emissions and increase efficiency of energy 
usage. The CAFF formalises and governs project evaluation, usage and 
management of proceeds, as well as reporting for Climate Action Finance 
Transactions, including bonds, loans and other forms of finance.
Climate Vision 2050
CLP’s Climate Vision 2050 is the blueprint of the Group’s transition to a  
net-zero greenhouse gas emissions business by mid-century. Since its launch 
in 2007, the Climate Vision has informed CLP’s business strategy. It guides 
CLP’s investment decision-making and is integral to the broader climate 
strategy. 
Combined-cycle gas turbine 
(CCGT)
A power generation technology that uses dual turbine design, comprising 
of a gas turbine and steam turbine. During the process, the heat from the 
gas turbine is captured and transported to heat up water in a boiler. Steam 
is then produced to drive the steam turbine for power generation. The 
combined-cycle design enables significantly higher efficiency by allowing for 
greater output without the use of additional fuel.

Double materiality
Under the concept of double materiality, companies assess matters affecting 
business sustainability from two perspectives: firstly financially material 
topics that may reasonably be expected to affect the business’s cash flows, 
access to finance or cost of capital; secondly impact material topics with 
potential effects on people, the environment and the economy. The concept 
was formally proposed by the European Commission in 2019.
