Abstract 
Abstract  
This year’s edition of the World Energy Investment provides a full 
update on the investment picture in 2023 and an initial reading of the 
emerging picture for 2024.  
The report provides a global benchmark for tracking capital flows in 
the energy sector and examines how investors are assessing risks 
and opportunities across all areas of fuel and electricity supply, 
critical minerals, efficiency, research and development and energy 
finance. 
The report highlights several key aspects of the current investment 
landscape, including persistent cost and interest rates pressures, the 
new industrial strategies being adopted by major economies to boost 
clean energy manufacturing, and the policies that support incentives 
for clean energy spending, notably from the increasingly important 
viewpoints of energy security and affordability. 
This year’s edition provides an expanded analysis on the sources of 
investment and sources of finance in the energy sector, including new 
insights on the role of development finance institutions in energy 
investments across emerging and developing economies. It will also 
look at how investment trends in clean energy compare with those in 
fossil fuels, as well as the geographic distribution of these 
investments. 
The report also includes a new regional section covering 10 major 
economies and regions. It also assesses additional efforts needed to 
meet the COP28 goals to transition away from fossil fuels, triple 
renewable capacity and double the rate of improvements in energy 
efficiency by 2030.

Overview and key findings 
Rising investments in clean energy push overall energy investment above USD 3 trillion for the 
first time 
Global energy investment is set to exceed USD 3 trillion for the first 
time in 2024, with USD 2 trillion going to clean energy technologies 
and infrastructure. Investment in clean energy has accelerated since 
2020, and spending on renewable power, grids and storage is now 
higher than total spending on oil, gas, and coal. 
As the era of cheap borrowing comes to an end, certain kinds of 
investment are being held back by higher financing costs. However, 
the impact on project economics has been partially offset by easing 
supply chain pressures and falling prices. Solar panel costs have 
decreased by 30% over the last two years, and prices for minerals 
and metals crucial for energy transitions have also sharply dropped, 
especially the metals required for batteries. 
The annual World Energy Investment report has consistently warned 
of energy investment flow imbalances, particularly insufficient clean 
energy investments in EMDE outside China. There are tentative 
signs of a pick-up in these investments: in our assessment, clean 
energy investments are set to approach USD 320 billion in 2024, up 
by more 50% since 2020. This is similar to the growth seen in 
advanced economies (+50%), although trailing China (+75%). The 
gains primarily come from higher investments in renewable power, 
now representing half of all power sector investments in these 
economies. Progress in India, Brazil, parts of Southeast Asia and 
Africa reflects new policy initiatives, well-managed public tenders, 
and improved grid infrastructure. Africa’s clean energy investments 
in 2024, at over USD 40 billion, are nearly double those in 2020. 
Yet much more needs to be done. In most cases, this growth comes 
from a very low base and many of the least-developed economies 
are being left behind (several face acute problems servicing high 
levels of debt). In 2024, the share of global clean energy investment 
in EMDE outside China is expected to remain around 15% of the total. 
Both in terms of volume and share, this is far below the amounts that 
are required to ensure full access to modern energy and to meet 
rising energy demand in a sustainable way.  
Power sector investment in solar photovoltaic (PV) technology is 
projected to exceed USD 500 billion in 2024, surpassing all other 
generation sources combined. Though growth may moderate slightly 
in 2024 due to falling PV module prices, solar remains central to the 
power sector’s transformation. In 2023, each dollar invested in wind 
and solar PV yielded 2.5 times more energy output than a dollar spent 
on the same technologies a decade prior. 
In 2015, the ratio of clean power to unabated fossil fuel power 
investments was roughly 2:1. In 2024, this ratio is set to reach 10:1. 
The rise in solar and wind deployment has driven wholesale prices

Overview and key findings 
down in some countries, occasionally below zero, particularly during 
peak periods of wind and solar generation. This lowers the potential 
for spot market earnings for producers and highlights the need for 
complementary investments in flexibility and storage capacity. 
Investments in nuclear power are expected to pick up in 2024, with 
its share (9%) in clean power investments rising after two consecutive 
years of decline. Total investment in nuclear is projected to reach 
USD 80 billion in 2024, nearly double the 2018 level, which was the 
lowest point in a decade. 
Grids have become a bottleneck for energy transitions, but 
investment is rising. After stagnating around USD 300 billion per year 
since 2015, spending is expected to hit USD 400 billion in 2024, 
driven by new policies and funding in Europe, the United States, 
China, and parts of Latin America. Advanced economies and China 
account for 80% of global grid spending. Investment in Latin America 
has almost doubled since 2021, notably in Colombia, Chile, and 
Brazil, where spending doubled in 2023 alone. However, investment 
remains worryingly low elsewhere. 
Investments in battery storage are ramping up and are set to exceed 
USD 50 billion in 2024. But spending is highly concentrated. In 2023, 
for every dollar invested in battery storage in advanced economies 
and China, only one cent was invested in other EMDE. 
Investment in energy efficiency and electrification in buildings and 
industry has been quite resilient, despite the economic headwinds. 
But most of the dynamism in the end-use sectors is coming from 
transport, where investment is set to reach new highs in 2024 (+8% 
compared to 2023), driven by strong electric vehicle (EV) sales. 
The rise in clean energy spending is underpinned by emissions 
reduction goals, technological gains, energy security imperatives 
(particularly in the European Union), and an additional strategic 
element: major economies are deploying new industrial strategies to 
spur clean energy manufacturing and establish stronger market 
positions. Such policies can bring local benefits, although gaining a 
cost-competitive foothold in sectors with ample global capacity like 
solar PV can be challenging. Policy makers need to balance the costs 
and benefits of these programmes so that they increase the resilience 
of clean energy supply chains while maintaining gains from trade. 
In the United States, investment in clean energy increases to an 
estimated more than USD 300 billion in 2024, 1.6 times the 2020 
level and well ahead of the amount invested in fossil fuels. The 
European Union spends USD 370 billion on clean energy today, 
while China is set to spend almost USD 680 billion in 2024, supported 
by its large domestic market and rapid growth in the so-called “new 
three” industries: solar cells, lithium battery production and EV 
manufacturing.

Overview and key findings 
Investment in fuel supply remains largely dominated by fossil fuels, although interest in low-
emissions fuels is growing fast from a low base 
Upstream oil and gas investment is expected to increase by 7% in 
2024 to reach USD 570 billion, following a 9% rise in 2023. This is 
being led by Middle East and Asian NOCs, which have increased 
their investments in oil and gas by over 50% since 2017, and which 
account for almost the entire rise in spending for 2023-2024.  
Lower cost inflation means that the headline rise in spending results 
in an even larger rise in activity, by approximately 25% compared with 
2022. Existing fields account for around 40% total oil and gas 
upstream investment, while another 33% goes to new fields and 
exploration. The remainder goes to tight oil and shale gas.  
Most of the huge influx of cashflows to the oil and gas industry in 
2022-2023 was either returned to shareholders, used to buy back 
shares or to pay down debt; these uses exceeded capital expenditure 
again in 2023. A surge in profits has also spurred a wave of mergers 
and acquisitions (M&A), especially among US shale companies, 
which represented 75% of M&A activity in 2023. Clean energy 
spending by oil and gas companies grew to around USD 30 billion in 
2023 (of which just USD 1.5 billion was by NOCs), but this represents 
less than 4% of global capital investment on clean energy.  
A significant wave of new investment is expected in LNG in the 
coming years as new liquefaction plants are built, primarily in the 
United States and Qatar. The concentration of projects looking to 
start operation in the second half of this decade could increase 
competition and raise costs for the limited number of specialised 
contractors in this area. For the moment, the prospect of ample gas 
supplies has not triggered a major reaction further down the value 
chain. The amount of new gas-fired power capacity being approved 
and coming online remains stable at around 50-60 GW per year. 
Investment in coal has been rising steadily in recent years, and more 
than 50 GW of unabated coal-fired power generation was approved 
in 2023, the most since 2015, and almost all of this was in China.  
Investment in low-emissions fuels is only 1.4% of the amount spent 
on fossil fuels (compared to about 0.5% a decade ago). There are 
some fast-growing areas. Investments in hydrogen electrolysers 
have risen to around USD 3 billion per year, although they remain 
constrained by uncertainty about demand and a lack of reliable off-
takers. Investments in sustainable aviation fuels have reached 
USD 1 billion, while USD 800 million is going to direct air capture 
projects (a 140% increase from 2023). Some 20 commercial-scale 
carbon capture utilisation and storage (CCUS) projects in seven 
countries reached final investment decision (FID) in 2023; according 
to company announcements, another 110 capture facilities, transport 
and storage projects could do the same in 2024.

Overview and key findings 
Energy transitions are reshaping how energy investment decisions are made, and by whom
This year’s World Energy Investment report contains new analysis on 
sources of investments and sources of finance, making a clear 
distinction 
between 
those 
making 
investment 
decisions 
(governments, often via state-owned enterprises (SOEs), private 
firms and households) and the institutions providing the capital (the 
public sector, commercial lenders, and development finance 
institutions) to finance these investments.  
Overall, most investments in the energy sector are made by 
corporates, with firms accounting for the largest share of investments 
in both the fossil fuel and clean energy sectors. However, there are 
significant country-by-country variations: half of all energy 
investments in EMDE are made by governments or SOEs, compared 
with just 15% in advanced economies. Investments by state-owned 
enterprises come mainly from national oil companies, notably in the 
Middle East and Asia where they have risen substantially in recent 
years, and among some state-owned utilities. The financial 
sustainability, investment strategies and the ability for SOEs to attract 
private capital therefore become a central issue for secure and 
affordable transitions.  
The share of total energy investments made or decided by private 
households (if not necessarily financed by them directly) has doubled 
from 9% in 2015 to 18% today, thanks to the combined growth in 
rooftop solar installations, investments in buildings efficiency and 
electric vehicle purchases. For the moment, these investments are 
mainly made by wealthier households – and well-designed policies 
are essential to making clean energy technologies more accessible 
to all. A comparison shows that households have contributed to more 
than 40% of the increase in investment in clean energy spending 
since 2016 – by far the largest share. It was particularly pronounced 
in advanced economies, where, because of strong policy support, 
households accounted for nearly 60% of the growth in energy 
investments.  
Three quarters of global energy investments today are funded from 
private and commercial sources, and around 25% from public 
finance, and just 1% from national and international development 
finance institutions (DFIs).  
Other financing options for energy transition have faced challenges 
and are focused on advanced economies. In 2023, sustainable debt 
issuances exceeded USD 1 trillion for the third consecutive year, but 
were still 25% below their 2021 peak, as rising coupon rates 
dampened issuers’ borrowing appetite. Market sentiment for 
sustainable finance is wavering, with flows to ESG funds decreasing 
in 2023, due to potential higher returns elsewhere and credibility 
concerns. Transition finance is emerging to mobilise capital for high-
emitting sectors, but greater harmonisation and credible standards 
are required for these instruments to reach scale.

Overview and key findings 
Much greater efforts are needed to get on track to meet energy & climate goals, including those 
agreed at COP28 
Today’s investment trends are not aligned with the levels necessary 
for the world to have a chance of limiting global warming to 1.5 °C 
above pre-industrial levels and to achieve the interim goals agreed at 
COP28. The current momentum behind renewable power is 
impressive, and if the current spending trend continues, it would 
cover approximately two-thirds of the total investment needed to triple 
renewable capacity by 2030. But an extra USD 500 billion per year is 
required in the IEA’s Net Zero Emissions by 2050 Scenario (NZE 
Scenario) to fill the gap completely (including spending for grids and 
battery storage). This equates to a doubling of current annual 
spending on renewable power generation, grids, and storage in 2030, 
in order to triple renewable capacity. 
The goal of doubling the pace of energy efficiency improvement 
requires an even greater additional effort. While investment in the 
electrification of transport is relatively strong and brings important 
efficiency gains, investment in other efficiency measures – notably 
building retrofits – is well below where it needs to be: efficiency 
investments in buildings fell in 2023 and are expected to decline 
further in 2024. A tripling in the current annual rate of spending on 
efficiency and electrification – to about USD 1.9 trillion in 2030 – is 
needed to double the rate of energy efficiency improvements. 
Anticipated oil and gas investment in 2024 is broadly in line with the 
level of investment required in 2030 in the Stated Policies Scenario, 
a scenario which sees oil and natural gas demand levelling off before 
2030. However, global spare oil production capacity is already close 
to 6 million barrels per day (excluding Iran and Russia) and there is 
a shift expected in the coming years towards a buyers’ market for 
LNG. Against this backdrop, the risk of over-investment would be 
strong if the world moves swiftly to meet the net zero pledges and 
climate goals in the Announced Pledges Scenario (APS) and the NZE 
Scenario. 
The NZE Scenario sees a major rebalancing of investments in fuel 
supply, away from fossil fuels and towards low-emissions fuels, such 
as bioenergy and low-emissions hydrogen, as well as CCUS. 
Achieving net zero emissions globally by 2050 would mean annual 
investment in oil, gas, and coal falls by more than half, from just over 
USD 1 trillion in 2024 to below USD 450 billion per year in 2030, 
while spending on low-emissions fuels increases tenfold, to about 
USD 200 billion in 2030 from just under USD 20 billion today. 
The required increase in clean energy investments in the NZE 
Scenario is particularly steep in many emerging and developing 
economies. The cost of capital remains one of the largest barriers to

Overview and key findings 
investment in clean energy projects and infrastructure in many 
EMDE, with financing costs at least twice as high as in advanced 
economies as well as China. Macroeconomic and country-specific 
factors are the major contributors to the high cost of capital for clean 
energy projects, but so, too, are risks specific to the energy sector. 
Alongside actions by national policy makers, enhanced support from 
DFIs can play a major role in lowering financing costs and bringing in 
much larger volumes of private capital.  
Targeted concessional support is particularly important for the least-
developed countries that will otherwise struggle to access adequate 
capital.  Our analysis shows cumulative financing for energy projects 
by DFIs was USD 470 billion between 2013 and 2021, with China-
based DFIs accounting for slightly over half of the total. There was a 
significant reduction in financing for fossil fuel projects over this 
period, largely because of reduced Chinese support. However, this 
was not accompanied by a surge in support for clean energy projects. 
DFI support was provided almost exclusively (more than 90%) as 
debt (not all concessional) with only about 3% reported as equity 
financing and about 6% as grants. This debt was provided in hard 
currency or in the currency of donors, with almost no local-currency 
financing being reported. 
The lack of local-currency lending pushes up borrowing costs and in 
many cases is the primary reason behind the much higher cost of 
capital in EMDE compared to advanced economies. High hedging 
costs often make this financing unaffordable to many of the least-
developed countries and raises questions of debt sustainability. More 
attention is needed from DFIs to focus interventions on project de-
risking that can mobilise much higher multiples of private capital.

Rising finance costs shape today’s energy investment climate
Meeting the targets for sustainable development, climate and energy 
security will require a substantial increase in capital investment in 
energy. As these investments scale up globally, it is increasingly 
important to understand the prevailing trends affecting capital-
allocation decisions across various finance providers, which is why 
this year’s World Energy Investment report begins with a chapter on 
finance.  
This chapter provides an overview of current financing trends. It 
makes a distinction between the notions of investment – understood 
as a capital expenditure used to build or acquire an asset – and 
finance, which encompasses the origin of the funds supporting an 
investment, as well as the form it takes and who is providing it. Within 
the energy finance ecosystem, we explore the different roles played 
by capital providers – the ones who make the investment decisions 
(e.g. governments, households and the private sector), also known 
as “sources of investment” – and finance providers. This second 
group includes development finance institutions as well as other 
public and private sources capital – which we refer to as “sources of 
finance.” We also look at emerging themes such as transition finance 
and consider how the development of transition plans by financial 
institutions and corporations can support access to capital for hard-
to-abate sectors. The role of carbon markets and carbon pricing is 
also discussed.    
The year 2023 was marked by a spike in interest rates across many 
countries – including advanced economies where relatively low 
inflation and low interest rates had prevailed for more than a decade 
in the wake of the 2008 financial crisis. While the 2020-2022 
pandemic drove interest rates sharply lower across much of the 
world, inflation pressures mounted in 2022, changing this trajectory. 
Compounding this trend, the invasion of Ukraine by the Russian 
Federation (“Russia” hereafter) in early 2022 – as well as other 
geopolitical conflicts across the world – increased political risks, 
driving up the cost of capital. Interest rates on long-term, local-
currency government bonds – a benchmark indicator for the cost of 
capital in a country – rose considerably in many countries, with the 
notable exception of the People’s Republic of China (“China” 
hereafter). Yields on ten-year United States Treasury bonds, for 
example, increased by about three percentage points between 2020 
and 2023, with even larger differences in the US overnight interbank 
lending rate (the short-term rate). A similar trend was seen in bonds 
issued by European governments. Sharp increases in US interest 
rates have a significant knock-on effect for capital investments 
worldwide – including in emerging market and developing economies 
(EMDE) – because the assets held by most large international 
investors, asset managers and financiers are valued in US dollars 
(USD) and most major projects, regardless of geography, are also

PAGE | 28  
Finance 
priced in USD. On top of this, local-currency financing has also 
become more expensive in many EMDE, including Brazil, Mexico, 
India and South Africa.   
In addition to raising borrowing costs, higher interest rates also affect 
the cost of equity, which is estimated as the sum of the risk-free rate 
(e.g. the return on a bond issued by a low-risk country like the United 
States) and the equity risk premium (the additional return that 
compensates investors for taking on the higher risk of equity). The 
expected equity internal rate of return (EIRR) of utility-scale solar 
photovoltaic (PV) projects in the United States, for example, has 
soared in recent years, reaching between 8% and 9% in 2023. But 
these USD rates of return are still about half of what foreign investors 
require to finance a similar project in some EMDE. Although the 
variations in both EIRR and the cost of capital vary widely among 
EMDE, developing and emerging economies face higher costs of 
capital in general due to the greater risks – real or perceived – of 
investing in a particular jurisdiction and/or industrial sector. This 
remains a significant barrier to increased levels of investment in 
these regions. 
A higher cost of capital – the weighted average of the costs 
associated with raising funds for investments – makes it much more 
difficult to generate attractive risk-adjusted returns. This is especially 
true for relatively capital-intensive clean energy technologies that 
require a large upfront investment, that are generally more 
dependent on debt financing (compared to the oil and gas industry) 
and where operating expenses tend to represent a relatively small 
share of total project costs. Although ambitious government policies, 
technological advancements and declining cost trends (all key factors 
in determining energy project costs) have helped offset some of the 
rise in capital costs, the general rise in interest rates and a stronger 
USD are not good news for investment anywhere. 
The picture in China is somewhat different. China did not suffer 
inflation pressures in the wake of the pandemic, but it has been 
battling relatively low economic growth and weakness in the property 
sector, with knock-on effects for local banks. This is why, unlike most 
of the world, China has kept benchmark lending rates low.  
Elsewhere, there are signs that benchmark interest rates may not 
remain high for long. There is ample debate on when and how fast 
they may come down, though most experts agree that the 
exceptional period of near-zero interest rates is probably over. The 
US Federal Reserve (Fed) has indicated that it plans to cut its short-
term benchmark by 75 basis points in 2024, although this expected 
rate-cutting cycle has been delayed repeatedly because US inflation 
remains stuck above the Fed’s 2% target. These movements are 
beyond the remit of energy policy makers, but will be important for 
determining the pace of the energy transition over the next years.

Clean energy is reshaping the role played by the private sector, including households, while 
government funding still plays a large role in China and in supporting fossil fuels in EMDE
Since 2016, there has been a significant change in the types of 
energy assets being financed, but less of a change in where capital 
has come from. Between 2016 and 2023, clean energy’s share of 
total energy investment increased from around 50% to 63%. 
Throughout this period, private sources of finance made up the bulk 
of spending, accounting for 73% in 2023. While this share remains 
roughly the same by 2030 in the NZE Scenario, in absolute terms it 
represents an increase of USD 1.5 trillion in private sector spending. 
The role of public financing – i.e. state-owned enterprises (SOEs), 
equity stakes in public assets such as government buildings and 
public vehicle fleets, as well as various subsidies and tax incentives 
– has decreased slightly. Public finance plays a larger role in EMDE, 
accounting for 32% of spending between 2016 and 2023, compared 
with 14% in advanced economies. Debt sustainability has become a 
growing concern across EMDE – three quarters of all developing 
economies have debt-to-GDP ratios of at least 75% – so mobilising 
a greater share of private finance in these markets will be essential.  
Government investment in global energy assets has remained 
broadly stable at around 37% of assets for the 2015-2023 period. The 
government plays a particularly prominent role in fossil fuel asset 
ownership, meaning they are most involved in the energy sector in 
regions with high fossil fuel production such as the Middle East, 
Russia and the Caspian states. As these economies respond to the 
energy transition, many SOEs will remain responsible for electricity 
networks and utility-scale power generation, while policy makers are 
increasingly positioning their SOEs to be key players in the energy 
transition. Still, the role of SOEs in global energy financing is 
expected to decrease over time as end-use sectors gradually take on 
a larger share of total investment.   
In China, government ownership accounts for 60% of all energy 
assets and is particularly evident in fossil fuels, where nearly all of 
assets are government owned. China has taken steps to support 
large SOEs and state-owned banks to increase clean energy finance, 
including through the development of sustainable finance regulations 
and incentives, so state ownership is expected to remain prominent 
even as clean energy becomes a larger part of the energy mix.  
As energy transitions have gained momentum in recent years, we 
have seen a rise in investments made by households. Their share of 
new spending has doubled from 9% in 2015 to 18% in 2023. This is 
due to growth in rooftop solar, energy efficiency in buildings and the 
purchase of electric vehicles. With households taking on a higher 
share of energy investment, affordability and cost-of-living concerns 
may act as potential brakes on investment in the coming year. Unlike 
corporations or governments, consumer finance operates under 


World Energy Investment 2024 
 
PAGE | 33  
Finance 
different constraints – use-of-proceeds, application processes, 
interest rates and fees, etc. – requiring unique policies and financing 
instruments. The financial institutions supporting consumers with 
financing also have a different profile compared to financial 
institutions lending to utility-scale projects. This fundamental shift in 
the system emphasises the need for tailored approaches to support 
households in their transition towards sustainable energy practices. 
Capital structure – i.e. the combination of debt and equity used to 
finance energy assets – has remained fairly stable over the last 8 
years at around 46% debt. This varies significantly between energy 
assets and regions. Fossil fuels have the lowest share of debt at 
around 40%. The last two years saw large repayments by oil and gas 
companies; prior to that, a period of low commodity prices ate into 
fossil fuel companies’ profitability, limiting their use of retained 
earnings to pay back debt. For clean power, the share of debt is 
closer to 50% – down from 60% in the late 2010s – driven by the 
need for high upfront capital investment. This change is partly due to 
better growth opportunities for the sector and lower equipment costs, 
but also to the contractual repayment of debt used for the upfront 
capital of previously installed clean power. Meanwhile, the share of 
debt financing in the end-use sectors – with higher household 
participation – is 45%, close to the average for all energy assets. 
Reducing the uncertainty on debt financing availability is crucial for 
the energy transition. Under the NZE Scenario, around 45% of 
investments in clean energy relies on debt – particularly in grid 
investment, where debt accounts for more than 50% of capital 
spending. This trend will feed into the concerns about countries’ 
capacity to sustain high levels of borrowing, particularly in EMDE. 
Whether debt is provided on a corporate or project finance basis also 
matters. Grids are typically financed on a corporate basis while solar 
PV and wind are increasingly on a project finance basis. This ends 
up being particularly important in EMDE, where lending on a 
corporate basis to utilities is challenging without tackling the 
fundamental financial health of the utility. 
Meanwhile, equity financing plays a key role in funding clean energy 
technologies with high upfront risks – such as geothermal or hydro – 
or less mature technologies like battery storage, carbon capture, and 
low-carbon hydrogen. As these technologies mature, the risks should 
fall, allowing more debt to be used. Long construction timelines, such 
as for grid and nuclear, also increase the technology risks. 
Equally, in less mature markets, even established technologies can 
count on a larger share of equity to take on the risks in development 
and construction phase. As newer technologies and markets 
establish a track record, there is potential for the share of debt to 
increase as governments implement supportive policies to bolster 
business models with stable cash flows. This can be particularly 
important in some EMDE, where a limited supply of equity (e.g. in 
Africa) acts as a brake on the development of bankable projects. This 
is where Development Finance Institutions (DFI) could step in to 
provide funds without increasing the debt burden in EMDE countries.

Sustainable funds rebounded in early 2024, while interest is growing for financial industry 
engagement to focus on credible transition plans as opposed to emissions disclosure 
Sustainable finance regulations have recently provided a tailwind for 
clean energy investments, but 2023 was a challenging year for 
sustainable investment practices. For the first time, sustainable funds 
saw a net outflow in the fourth quarter, notably including in Europe – 
home to 84% of sustainable funds by value. Outflows have become 
common in the United States, occurring for the last five quarters as 
environmental, social and governance (ESG) issues become 
increasingly politicised. Meanwhile, in Europe, sustainable funds 
consistently attracted larger proportional inflows than conventional 
funds, but the two have gradually converged in 2023 and as the 
market tightened, actively managed sustainable funds saw outflows 
for the first time. This is likely due to a combination of factors, with 
many fund managers increasing their allocations to government 
bonds, and concern growing over the classification of sustainable 
funds. Despite these concerns, the value of sustainable funds 
globally  increased by 8% in 2023, driven by a rally in growth stocks 
(those that focus on long-term potential).  
The pushback against ESG in the United States had an impact 
beyond sustainable funds. In February, two of the largest US-based 
asset managers – JPMorgan Chase and State Street – withdrew from 
Climate Action 100+ (CA100+), an investor-led initiative designed to 
encourage decarbonisation by large emitters. Blackrock also scaled 
back its involvement in the initiative, transferring participation from 
their US business to the smaller, international arm. CA100+ has also 
seen withdrawals from Europe, including Swiss Re in March 2024, 
with most firms arguing that they can achieve similar goals through 
independent engagement with emitters. Analysis of proxy voting 
patterns in 2024 indicates that support for climate-related resolutions 
remains strong, but most of these are focused on emissions 
disclosure. The departures from CA100+ came at a time when the 
initiative aimed to increase their focus on enactment of climate 
transition plans, as well as the continued push for improved 
disclosure.  
There has been a growing emphasis on moving beyond disclosures 
to implementing transition plans, particularly among asset owners, 
who play a key role in the financing chain due to their ability to 
influence both corporate strategy and the approach of asset 
managers. In December 2023, the UN-Convened Net Zero Asset 
Owners Alliance (NZAOA) released guidance on how to strengthen 
engagement on transition planning, alongside development of 
credible plans for their own activities. Several months later, the 
NZAOA also published guidelines for asset managers on how to 
support their asset owner clients through strengthened climate 
stewardship.

The banking sector is also wrestling with how to adhere to tighter climate disclosure 
regulations without slowing real economic growth by restricting to key sectors  
Banks play a particularly important role in the financing of energy 
projects because of their large pools of capital (primarily for debt 
financing) and because they provide funding at both the project and 
corporate level as well as to households, who play an increasing role 
in energy supply under the NZE Scenario. Banks can support energy 
transitions through the design of sustainable loan products and 
engagement with the companies they finance. Similarly, banks can 
create tailored consumer loan offerings to incentivise clean energy 
spending at the household level with products like green mortgages.  
There is significant diversity within the banking sector, and the role of 
banks in the energy transition is likely to vary by their size and by 
region. The UN-convened Net Zero Banking Alliance (NZBA) plays a 
leadership role, working across the sector to promote approaches to 
decarbonise lending, develop transition finance tools and facilitate 
the managed phase-out of fossil fuels. Currently, more than 140 
banks are NZBA members, and around 40% of global banking assets 
are held by banks with net-zero commitments. Despite this, data from 
Bloomberg indicate that the ratio of clean energy funding (including 
debt and equity underwriting) compared to fossil fuels has slightly 
worsened: For every 1 USD loaned  to the fossil fuel sector in 2021, 
75 cents went to clean energy companies. By 2022, the ratio had 
fallen to 73 cents (latest available data).  
Sustainable finance regulations for the banking sector are primarily 
focused on improving disclosure. For example, in November 2023, 
the Basel Committee published a draft climate disclosure framework 
for consultation aimed at improving the tracking of banks’ progress 
on climate-related activities. However, several banks have expressed 
concerns about the metrics used to measure these activities. 
Currently, the main metric used is financed emissions (i.e. banks’ 
Scope 3 emissions) but these emissions are not widely reported by 
companies and are hard to estimate accurately. Furthermore, there 
is still debate over whether financed emissions are the best proxy for 
climate risk, with banks arguing for the use of multiple metrics, 
including a calculation related to transition finance. 
Tighter regulations increase the risk that businesses in hard-to-abate 
sectors can no longer access financing from banks in markets with 
stricter climate regulations. This forces those businesses to raise 
capital in markets with more lax environments, where banks are also 
less likely to engage with companies over transition plans. This 
practice – financial carbon leakage – could delay change in the real 
economy. Avoiding this outcome means increasing the number of 
banks committed to net zero, while also ensuring that sustainable 
finance regulation considers transition financing.

 Box 1.1. Growing domestic private financial sector involvement in clean energy in EMDE 
 
 Currency risk is often cited as one of the primary drivers of high 
financing costs for energy projects, while also contributing to the 
growing debt problem in EMDE countries. Given the scale of 
investment needs, funding from advanced economies will remain 
important. Solutions such as hedging products allow hard 
currency funders to lend in local currencies, but these can add 
complexity and cost to financing arrangements. Domestic 
financial institutions, which lend in local currency and are less 
subject to external shocks, also therefore play a key role. 
There is currently significant variation in the role of domestic 
capital in energy financing based on the depth of local markets. 
Domestic financing dominates in some of the larger EMDE, such 
as India and Brazil, or regions with well-developed financial 
sectors such as ASEAN. In these markets, various approaches 
allow local capital providers to invest in energy projects at an 
affordable rate, including tools like sustainable debt issuance, as 
in ASEAN, or mechanisms where the government absorbs some 
costs of commercial lenders, as in India.  
In EMDE where the financial sector is less deep (e.g. sub-
Saharan Africa) institutional investors such as pension funds 
often primarily invest in government securities, with limited  
familiarity with other investment classes such as infrastructure.  
  
New mechanisms are emerging to tap into this capital source. For 
example, in Nigeria, InfraCredit – a local currency guarantee provider 
– has helped 19 local pension funds enter the energy sector, mobilising 
USD 206 million over the last five years. This group of investors is most 
likely to invest in operational assets, including via refinancing structures 
that help free up development capital for greenfield assets.

DFIs play a crucial and unique role due to their ability to take on higher-risk projects, but they 
are facing pressure to ramp up financing and to scale up private sector mobilisation
Development finance institutions (DFIs) are uniquely positioned to 
catalyse investment flows towards sustainable and resilient energy 
infrastructure, particularly in EMDE. Along with direct financing, DFIs 
can provide policy support, capacity building, and concessional 
capital focused on de-risking projects to mobilise private capital into 
otherwise high-risk markets or technologies.  
From 2013 to 2021, cumulative DFI financing reached approximately 
USD 468 billion globally, with China-based DFIs and other DFIs 
accounting for 56% and 44%, respectively. While energy financing 
from China’s DFIs has fallen from its peak in 2016 – averaging around 
USD 27 billion in annual disbursements – other DFIs have been fairly 
constant in their financing, averaging USD 21 billion annually. DFI 
financing was disbursed across regions, with Africa being the largest 
recipient, followed by Asia Pacific and Latin America. Russia has also 
consistently received global energy financing through China’s DFIs. 
In terms of financial instruments, DFIs primarily provide debt, 
followed by significantly smaller amounts of grant and equity 
financing. Less than half of the total debt financing is provided on 
highly-concessional terms, or in the form of Official Development 
Assistance (ODA), where at least 10-45% of the loan is a grant-
equivalent. The rest is provided under less-concessional terms, and 
mostly from China. It is also notable that nearly 80% of global DFI 
financing is reported to be provided in USD and EUR and limited 
amounts of local currency lending was available from DFIs excluding 
China. This highlights the need to better construct development 
finance instruments that are more preferential and are better suited 
to the needs of EMDE borrowers.  
With regard to technology, around 65% of DFI financing was directed 
towards clean energy, with investments in energy efficiency in 
transport and transmission and distribution grids accounting for more 
than 40%. Notably, financing for fossil fuels continues, albeit from a 
smaller group of providers. This includes Chinese DFIs which, in line 
with their pledge in 2021, have stopped financing new coal projects 
abroad, but do still provide funding to oil and gas projects.  
Several signals point to increased participation by DFIs in energy 
financing. According to the latest data, financing for energy-related 
sectors from DFIs outside of China reached a record high of 
USD 31 billion in disbursements in 2022, an increase of more than 
50% from the previous year. A 2017 pledge by multilateral 
development banks (MDBs)  to Paris align their financial flows  took 
effect in 2023, culminating in a joint MDB assessment framework for 
Paris alignment. China’s development finance in energy is also 
showing signs of revitalisation, with major announcements being 
made in the 3rd Belt and Road Forum in October 2023, such as the

pledge to inject nearly USD 48 billion each to China Development 
Bank and the Export-Import Bank of China to finance “small yet 
smart” projects, with an emphasis on green investments, as well as 
a USD 11 billion replenishment of the Silk Road Fund, the main 
investment platform for the Belt and Road Initiative. It is also notable 
that China has increasingly expanded its financing through state-
owned commercial banks, such as the Bank of China and the 
Industrial and Commercial Bank of China, especially through 
syndicated loans alongside various multilateral institutions, including 
the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development (EBRD). 
While it is important for DFIs to continue to channel their own capital 
into EMDE, including by acting as implementation partners for 
development aid from their donor governments, it is crucial to ensure 
that such resources also lead to effective mobilisation of the private 
sector. From 2012 to 2022, an average of USD 12 billion was 
mobilised for climate from the private sector annually – of which 
nearly USD 8 billion went to energy, industry, construction and 
transport. The Latin America and Caribbean region was the largest 
recipient of mobilised private finance (34%), followed by Asia (29%) 
and Africa (22%), demonstrating how middle-income countries are 
more likely to be the destination for private sector financing. Under 
the NZE Scenario, private finance increases across all EMDE regions 
by 2030. So finding solutions that can utilise DFI capital to de-risk 
private investments in lower-income countries will be essential to 
meet investment goals.

… but the next round of NDCs, expected by 2025, allows EMDE to reflect on their investment 
needs, providing greater clarity on where climate finance should be channelled
Increasing global co-operation on climate change can support clean 
energy investment via climate finance flows to EMDE. Countries put 
forward their short- to medium-term climate commitments in 
Nationally Determined Contributions (NDCs). The majority of NDCs 
have a target covering the energy sector. Around 70% of current 
NDCs contain a conditional component, the implementation of which 
is contingent on a range of possible conditions. These include 
financial, technical and capacity-building support. Some countries 
specify the level of financial support they would need to receive to 
implement their conditional NDC component; this can help increase 
clarity, transparency and understanding of these commitments. 
However, estimating the financial support needed for clean energy 
investments reported in NDCs is difficult to analyse due to 
fragmented and unstandardised data. Overall, the level reported falls 
short of what countries need to invest to meet their own 2030 clean 
energy targets. In the first United Nations Framework Convention on 
Climate Change (UNFCCC) report in 2021 on the determination of 
needs of EMDE (which will be updated in 2024) the Standing 
Committee on Finance also concluded that there were significant 
gaps in the requests for investment support across the nine types of 
national reports to the UNFCCC. This discrepancy could be attributed 
to several factors. For instance, some EMDE might not need 
international financial support to implement their own proposed 
mitigation measures (e.g. some high-income, high-emitting countries 
do not have a conditional NDC component). Some NDCs may not 
fully capture the necessary clean energy investments, potentially also 
due to a lack of detailed planning. Another factor could be the limited 
availability of data or a limited capacity to estimate clean energy 
investment needs. African countries stand out for including estimates 
of financial support requirements in their NDCs that are closely 
aligned with the IEA’s Announced Pledges Scenario (APS).  
The next round of NDCs, expected by early 2025, presents a crucial 
opportunity for countries to act on the outcomes of the first Global 
Stocktake (GST), a process that culminated at COP28 and evaluated 
the collective progress towards the goals of the Paris Agreement. It 
will also be an opportunity to enhance the clarity and transparency of 
their assessment of clean energy investment needs to achieve the 
2030 and 2035 NDC targets. In this light, Brazil’s presidencies of the 
G20 and COP30 have made it a priority to support countries to 
transform their next round of NDCs into investable plans. A clearer 
assessment of financial support needed in NDCs would have also 
been important input for the discussions of the New Collective 
Quantified Goal (NCQG) on climate finance, which will replace the 
USD 100 billion goal set in 2009. Current discussions around the 
NCQG address its potential quantum, scope and structure, and will 
culminate at COP29.

… but new issues of “green” debt – particularly green bonds – have held steady and thanks to 
sovereign issuances, indications from early 2024 are positive
Sustainable debt issuances reached approximately USD 1.2 trillion in 
2023, exceeding USD 1 trillion for a third consecutive year. 
Nonetheless, this represents a 14% decline from 2022 levels, and a 
23% drop from the peak in 2021. Over the last two years, rising 
interest rates have been a constraining factor, with both the number 
and size of issuances decreasing. During this period, debt issuance 
from energy and utilities companies also fell from a high of more than 
USD 280 billion in 2021 to USD 229 billion in 2023 – though it 
remains above 2020 levels.  
The biggest declines have been concentrated mainly in sustainability-
linked debt, which in 2023 registered a 50% drop from the previous 
year, reaching only USD 284 billion. By sector, real estate showed 
the biggest decrease, followed by utilities and automobiles 
manufacturing. Some of this decline is likely due to investors’ 
concerns around the credibility of sustainability-linked debt as a tool 
to drive rapid transitions, as well as industry-specific drivers, such as 
the contraction of the US commercial real estate market. Meanwhile, 
new issuance of green bonds – the most mature sustainable debt 
instrument – reached a record USD 650 billion in 2023 and 
accounted for more than half of total issuances. The steady increase 
in green bond issuance mainly comes from sovereigns, notably 
China, the United Kingdom, Italy, and Germany.  
Sustainable debt issuance remains concentrated in advanced 
economies, which account for over three-quarters, and China, which 
accounts for a further 11%. However, there are signs of growth within 
other EMDE, which saw their share of issuance rise to 14% in 2023 
from 8% in 2020. This has been driven by broadening use cases, as 
seen with two large bond issuances for green hydrogen in Saudi 
Arabia, and the instruments, such as the sovereign sustainability-
linked bond from the Chilean government. The EUR and USD remain 
the primary currencies for issuance, accounting for 38% and 28%, 
respectively. While this helps to attract international investors, it 
exposes issuers in EMDE to currency risks. With many EMDE 
grappling with rising debt levels, the borrowing at lower interest rates 
through sustainable debt instruments makes them an attractive tool, 
particularly for financing large public infrastructure projects. 
Initial indications from 2024 have given a generally positive outlook 
for sustainable debt issuances for the year. Although there may be 
some volatility due to political events, the fundamentals of the market, 
particularly for green bonds, remain strong and growth is expected in 
areas such as transition finance (see below). Additionally, the 
European Green Bond Standard, which comes into force in 2024, is 
expected to increase market confidence by strengthening disclosure 
requirements.

Transition finance tools are emerging as a promising means to drive more capital to high-
emitting sectors, but further efforts to harmonise standards for transition plans are necessary 
Achieving the NZE Scenario requires a broad range of investments. 
Some of these can easily be classified as clean energy, but many  
others are less easy to define. Under the NZE Scenario, technologies 
that could provide or enable zero emission energy or energy services 
account for 47% of spending in 2030, and those that provide 
emissions reductions but do not themselves deliver zero emissions 
energy or energy services account for 7%. Both categories struggle 
to attract financing earmarked for clean energy and are at risk of 
being excluded by investors seeking to decarbonise their portfolios. 
Transition finance is a framework that can support these activities. 
Several organisations such as ICMA, CBI, GFANZ, OECD and others 
have developed transition finance guidance, covering activities such 
as retrofitting and substantiating assets, investment in alternatives to 
fossil fuel use, and the role of engagement by financial institutions. 
Despite these guidelines, there is still significant variation in transition 
finance methodologies, with ICMA finding three overlapping 
definitions ranging from economy-wide to only hard-to-abate sectors.  
Transition-related bonds have been a preferred labelled tool for hard-
to-abate sectors. Oil refining and marketing, industrials and metals 
and mining accounted for 34% of issuances in the last three years; 
these sectors accounted for only 15% of green bonds over the same 
period. Transition-related bonds issuances in 2023 accounted for just 
USD 3.5 billion – less than 1% of all sustainable debt issuances and 
are geographically concentrated in Japan, Italy and China.

Establishing viable, science-based transition plans is a vital first step 
to expanding the use of transition debt instruments. Transition plans 
are generally understood as aligning with the Paris Agreement, and 
spelling out transition pathways, actions and interim targets. These 
elements are fundamental for engagement between corporates and 
investors, as well as tracking progress. Governments and regulators 
have taken different approaches to establishing transition activities. 
For example, Europe and Singapore are using taxonomies to define 
transition activities, while Japan has created industry roadmaps. 
Coverage can vary based on the regional methodologies, but both 
taxonomies and roadmaps can support an increase in funding, 
including from advanced economies where investors may be subject 
to stricter rules covering sustainable finance.  
Even with the provision of stronger transition plans and roadmaps, 
some additional obstacles have been observed. For example, on the 
issuer side, especially in EMDE, the data necessary to create 
transition plans and track progress is not always available. External 
support may therefore be necessary to help the development of this 
type of financing and, at least initially, such instruments will only be 
viable for larger companies with the resources to develop this data. 
On the supply side, many EMDE have sovereign ratings that are 
below investment grade, making it hard to attract investment from 
capital markets via instruments such as bonds without de-risking 
support from concessional finance providers. Particularly in EMDE 
with fossil-fuel intensive energy mixes, this use of concessional 
financing could have a significant real-world impact – especially if it 
leads to a “crowding in” of private sector investors. A further challenge 
is that many investors have net zero targets that rely on financed 
emissions as one of their primary metrics. Even though transition 
activities may be in line with a taxonomy or roadmap, they generally 
have higher emissions than purely clean activities, which would risk 
skewed investors’ efforts to reduce their financed emissions. Further 
consideration is needed on appropriate indicators that can monitor 
institutions’ proper progress and acceleration of funding for future 
energy transition of real economy.

 Box 2.1 The development of Climate Transition Bonds (JCTBs) in Japan 
 
 In February 2024, Japan issued the world's first sovereign transition 
bonds – Japan Climate Transition Bonds (JCTBs). Two offerings of 
JPY 800 billion (USD 5 billion) each were issued, with tenors of 5 
and 10 years. The issuances are certificated by the Climate Bonds 
Initiative and based on Japan’s national transition strategy.  
Japan’s Basic Policy for the Realization of Green Transformation, 
published in February 2023, includes a detailed investment plan for 
22 industrial sectors to reach carbon neutrality by 2050, as well as 
a commitment to introduce carbon pricing. Under the investment 
plan, the government envisages JPY 20 trillion (USD 130 billion) of 
public capital to realise more than JPY 150 trillion (USD 1 trillion) in 
investment through public and private financing by 2050. The plan 
is accompanied by transition roadmaps for each sector, which were 
developed by expert committees of public and private stakeholders. 
These roadmaps allow investors to identify transition activities and 
can also be used by companies for internal transition planning. The 
investment plan also includes an emphasis on nascent 
technologies, which will receive over half of the proceeds of JCTBs.  
The JCTBs also include a novel approach to carbon pricing. 
Normally, revenue from carbon pricing can only fund future energy 
transition activity, i.e. after the carbon has been paid. This delays 
in the impact of the carbon pricing but Japan’s approach was to  
 
build the future pricing revenue into the issuance, by assuming this 
is the capital government will use to make repayments on the bonds. 
This allows for the government to immediately take advantage of 
the assumed future revenue of carbon taxes.  
Structure of Japan Climate Transition Bonds (JCTBs)   
 
The JCTBs approach can potentially be repurposed for EMDE. With 
the government playing the role of credit intermediary, this could 
enhance corporates’ creditworthiness and eliminate the complexity 
of financing for small-scale projects. Countries with sub-investment-
grade credit ratings, may need additional credit enhancements – 
such as guarantees from DFIs – to help facilitate access to 
international capital markets.

Compliance carbon pricing instruments have seen further expansion and innovation in 2023, 
while voluntary carbon markets faced quality concerns 
Carbon pricing is a key instrument for mitigating emissions, 
encouraging investment in low-carbon technologies and reducing 
demand 
for 
emissions-intensive 
activities. 
Carbon 
pricing 
instruments include compliance carbon pricing instruments (CCPIs), 
such as carbon taxes, emissions trading systems (ETS) or hybrids of 
the two, as well as baseline and credit systems, which generate 
carbon credits. These two types of carbon pricing instruments can 
contribute in different ways to financing the clean energy transition, 
depending on the specific local contexts.  
As of May 2024, 75 CCPIs were in place worldwide. All CCPIs cover 
the energy sector and 23% of global greenhouse gas (GHG) 
emissions.  Aggregate revenues from CCPIs hit a new record high in 
2023 and, for the first time, revenues  surpassed USD 100 billion – of 
which roughly half was generated by Europe’s ETS. A few notable 
energy-sector related developments in CCPIs also took place: 
Canada introduced a regulatory framework for a federal cap-and-
trade system for the oil and gas sector – its largest source of GHG 
emissions. Meanwhile, as part of a broader reform, the European 
Union extended the coverage of its ETS by including its domestic 
maritime sector, which represents 3% to 4% of total EU CO2 
emissions. Indonesia introduced a new intensity-based ETS for the 
power generation sector. Brazil passed a new draft law for cap-and-
trade. Moreover, in October 2023, the EU Carbon Border Adjustment 
Mechanism (CBAM) also entered its transitional phase – introducing 
reporting requirements only – in preparation for a definitive regime 
that will start in 2026. 
Voluntary carbon credit markets have come under particular scrutiny 
in 2023, with some projects being accused of over-crediting, of 
lacking additionality or of enabling human rights abuses. This, 
alongside inconclusive negotiations at COP28 on Article 6 rules, 
impacted the issuance of energy-related carbon credits in 2023. 
Retirements of credits remained high in 2023, after reaching a peak 
in 2022. However, a surplus of unsold legacy credits has been 
accumulating in recent years, reaching around 480 million credits in 
2023. This keeps the costs of most energy-related carbon credits 
much lower than the real cost of mitigation. To address questions that 
some have raised on the integrity of some legacy credits, CORSIA 
has introduced cut-off dates for eligible credits. Recent initiatives 
were also set up to improve the quality of carbon credit supply (such 
as the Core Carbon Principles of the Integrity Council for Voluntary 
Carbon Markets) as well as demand (such as the Claims Code of 
Practice of the Voluntary Carbon Markets Integrity Initiative, the 
Nordic Code of best practice for the voluntary use of carbon credits, 
Finland’s guide to good practices for voluntary carbon markets).

 Box 2.3 Innovative financing solutions for energy access 
 
 There are still 750 million people living without access to 
electricity globally and more than 2 billion people without clean 
cooking solutions. Achieving the Sustainable Development Goal 
7 – universal energy access by 2030 – will require annual 
spending of at least USD 42 billion beginning in 2024. This 
represents a massive increase in spending, particularly in Africa, 
where energy access projects have struggled to attract more than 
USD 5 billion annually.   
Energy access investments are particularly challenging given that 
they are small scale, and the risks associated with the end user 
are often high. Mounting debt at utilities has slowed grid 
connections, challenges over demand stimulation have put 
pressure on mini-grid business models, and non-payment risks 
have impacted profitability for providers of home solar systems. 
Meanwhile, it is difficult to keep clean cooking solutions affordable 
for end users without the use of carbon credits, a market that has 
faced credibility concerns.  
Financial aggregation solutions have emerged as a way to raise 
more private capital for access projects. In May 2023, Sun King, 
an off-grid electricity provider, finalised a securitisation deal led 
by Citi, the US-based bank. Worth USD 130 million and 
denominated in Kenyan shillings, the transaction is based on the  
 
future expected revenue of a million customers. Alongside DFIs, the 
structure included participation from commercial banks in the region. 
Similarly, in 2021, Winch Energy used a portfolio loan approach – 
combining successful tenders for mini-grid development in Uganda 
and Sierra Leone into one holding company – to raise USD 16 million 
for projects that were otherwise too small to access financial markets. 
Grants and concessional capital will still play a key role, particularly in 
rural areas and fragile and conflict-prone states, but aggregation can 
leverage private capital into some of the more commercial projects.

To meet investment needs under the NZE Scenario, further evolution of today’s financial 
architecture is needed, including tailored solutions for transition activities and for EMDE
Ensuring the availability of affordable capital will be vital for driving 
rapid energy transitions. It is critical not only for financing projects and 
companies, but also for supporting the enabling environment and 
facilitating necessary spending by households. Current market 
conditions – particularly the rising interest rate environment – have 
resulted in higher financing costs and highlight the need for 
innovative risk-mitigation instruments and support mechanisms, 
particularly for EMDE. Tightening market conditions have also 
contributed to a setback in sustainable finance instruments as more 
financial players voice concerns about regulations becoming overly 
stringent, especially when it comes to financing high-emitting, hard-
to-abate sectors. 
Clean energy projects should adopt a diversified financing strategy 
that leverages the strengths and risk appetites of each source of 
capital. While private sector investment is particularly dominant in 
advanced economies, growing domestic private financial sector 
financing in energy in EMDE is particularly important, as it reduces 
currency risk and reliance on external sources. Attention is also due 
for households, which have also become increasingly prominent as 
providers of capital, as observed by the near doubling of their share 
of energy asset ownership between 2015 and 2023. Given the 
increases in the cost of living, maintaining affordability of services will 
be vital over the course of 2024, which may require additional support 
from public sources. DFIs can also play a role in ensuring affordability 
and providing capital in higher risk markets and technologies.  
Appropriate tools and systems need to be in place to direct finance 
towards energy investment in EMDE as a catalyst for clean energy 
transitions. This includes enhancing the credibility of carbon markets, 
which have faced criticism related to over-crediting, lack of 
additionality and enabling human rights abuses. Furthermore, 
improving transition finance mechanisms, and strengthening 
sustainable finance regulations, especially in the context of the 
potential impact on financing high-emitting, hard-to-abate sectors, 
can help ensure that financing supports the differing trajectories of 
EMDEs compared to advanced economies.  
On the EMDE side, providing an accurate assessment of financial 
needs for clean energy investments around NDCs will be crucial. This 
can be used as a basis for engagement in some of the global efforts 
to accelerate financing for energy transitions, such as at the 
upcoming G20 discussions, or via initiatives such as the ongoing 
Bridgetown Initiative that aims to reform the global financial 
architecture to better support EMDE.

Spending on renewables and batteries continues to reach new highs even as costs for solar PV 
and batteries plummet, while unabated fossil fuel power maintains its downward trend
Global investment in the power sector grew by 15% in 2023, reaching 
a record USD 1.3 trillion. Concerns over high interest rates and the 
profitability of renewables firms were offset by lower prices for solar 
PV modules, coupled with rapid renewables deployment in major 
economies including China, the European Union and the United 
States. Growth is set to continue in 2024 but at a more modest pace. 
Global spending on renewables also hit a new record of 
USD 735 billion, driven by solar PV and wind. China alone saw solar 
PV spending jump to USD 220 billion – almost half of global solar 
investment for the year – with capacity additions multiplying by a 
factor of 2.5 compared to 2022 thanks to falling module prices and 
pandemic recovery effects. As prices for solar modules and other key 
clean energy technologies continue to fall, we are now expecting the 
growth of spending for renewables to slow down – especially for 
distributed solar PV – and reach USD 770 billion in 2024. This does 
not reflect a slowdown in the renewable power capacity added, as 
price decreases allow for more capacity to be added per USD spent. 
Nonetheless, grid and curtailment concerns, permitting delays and 
land availability remain constraining factors.    
As renewables expanded in 2023, capital expenditures on fossil fuel 
power decreased by 10%, to USD 90 billion, led by declines in coal-
fired power. For 2024, we are expecting a similar decrease to 
USD 80 billion, again driven by coal (-30%) and to a smaller extent 
by gas-fired power (-8%). Spending on fossil fuel power with carbon 
capture utilisation and storage (CCUS) remained below USD 1 billion 
and was concentrated in China. 
While investment in nuclear power remained largely unchanged in 
2023, expected growth of around 20% in 2024 promises renewed 
momentum. However, most of this spending growth in the next few 
years will be driven by lifetime extensions rather than investment in 
new nuclear capacity. Investment in hydropower fell slightly and is 
expected to be even lower in 2024.  
Investment in electricity grids reached USD 375 billion, translating to 
a 9% average growth rate globally. Notable success stories for grids 
were in advanced economies as well as China and Latin America. 
Investment by other emerging market and developing economies 
(EMDE) still lagged the global average, and even declined in some 
regions. Battery storage investment grew in line with our strong 
expectations, reaching USD 40 billion. 
Final investment decisions (FIDs) continue to demonstrate a mixed 
picture. While FIDs for utility-scale renewables were at record highs, 
those for unabated coal-fired power plants also increased to levels 
not seen since 2015, with almost all of these made in China.

EMDE are slowly attracting more investment, but not at the scale required, while in advanced 
economies falling wholesale electricity prices create uncertainty for investors
While total power sector investment in EMDE outside China 
increased to USD 270 billion in 2023 – a record – its growth rate of 
12% still lagged the 16% average for advanced economies and 
China. Renewable power spending rose by almost one-fifth and now 
represents half of total power sector investment in other EMDE 
regions. Investment in grids increased to USD 80 billion – the highest 
level since 2018 – with further growth expected for 2024. Spending 
on nuclear and batteries also increased, while investments in fossil 
fuel power generation dipped slightly. 
Strong renewable power investment in EMDE outside China was 
driven by significant spending in India, Southeast Asia, Brazil and 
Africa, thanks to policy reforms and the introduction of well-organised 
public tenders, as well as grid improvements. The volume of 
renewable energy capacity that was auctioned in India, for example, 
topped 20 gigawatts (GW) in 2023 – more than double that of 2022 – 
with a particular focus on solar PV and projects that combine 
renewables with storage. Seeking to tackle its “state of disaster” in 
the electricity sector, South Africa also concluded its first battery 
procurement programme and is seeking to add an additional 5 GW 
of renewables and 600 megawatts (MW) of battery storage. 
Latin America notably increased its spending on grids in 2023. Brazil 
led the way with a record USD 8 billion auction, while Colombia and 
Panama revived interconnection plans. On the other hand, 
investment in grids in Southeast Asia and Africa stalled. 
Overall, however, power sector investment in EMDE outside China 
still represented only around 20% of the global total, while advanced 
economies and China were responsible for more than USD 1 trillion 
in spending. We expect this trend to persist in 2024, which means 
that overall spending is still not on track to meet current climate and 
energy-access goals. One major reason for this is the high cost of 
capital for clean energy projects in EMDE regions outside China, 
which is often double or triple the cost in advanced economies. 
While renewable companies in advanced economies saw improved 
profitability in 2023, lower prices for natural gas and deeper market 
penetration by low-cost renewables are starting to put pressure on 
wholesale electricity prices – creating uncertainties for their revenue 
streams. This, in turn, puts additional scrutiny on future investments 
– one reason we expect growth in renewable power investment to 
slow in 2024. In some European countries, for example, average 
wholesale electricity prices have fallen to their lowest levels since 
2021 – and have regularly dipped into negative territory. This 
underscores the pressing need for greater investment in power grids, 
interconnectors and storage infrastructure as the share of intermittent 
renewables increases.

Renewables developers see improving profitability, while solar PV onshoring plans and wind 
manufacturers face challenges
Solar PV and wind projects continue to offer attractive investment 
prospects, despite profitability challenges in the manufacturing 
business. Renewable utility profitability is slowly returning to pre-
pandemic levels, with returns on invested capital (ROIC) increasing 
by one-third in 2023 from a year earlier, thanks to falling solar and 
wind costs. ROIC is also notably more stable compared to the 
volatility of oil and gas companies in recent years. That said, the 
average cost of capital for renewable power firms has increased 
slightly in recent years, now hovering at around 7% of market value.  
An exception to the trend of improving profitability was offshore wind. 
2023 saw a range of contract cancellations due to previously agreed 
low prices that were no longer viable given supply chain challenges, 
cost increases and permitting delays. In the United States, for 
example, 7 GW of planned capacity was cancelled while another 4 
GW are subject to contract renegotiations at prices that are on 
average around two times higher. There were multiple cancellations 
in the United Kingdom as well, with the 2023 auction not attracting a 
single offer, prompting an increase of the strike price by 165% for its 
2024 auction. Nonetheless, successful contract renegotiations, 
adjustments in auctions and regulatory support such as the European 
Union’s wind power package are all positive signs that demonstrate 
the need for regulators to remain responsive to changing market 
conditions.   
On the manufacturing side, 2023 was dominated by significant price 
declines and concerns about overcapacity. As manufacturing 
capacity continues to grow within the Chinese solar PV sector, listed 
solar firms – dominated by Chinese entities – are starting to see their 
profit margins shrink. Despite government support for domestic 
manufacturing, cost pressures have led to some cancellations of 
expansion plans – and in some cases, existing plant closures – in 
Europe, the United States and India. That said, falling prices for solar 
modules led to a 5% drop in the global average levelised cost of 
electricity (LCOE) for solar PV last year. 
Companies specialised in wind turbines – a sector dominated by 
European manufacturers – struggled for roughly two years with 
various supply chain, cost and technical issues. But by 2023, 
profitability had largely recovered, reaching similar levels as solar PV 
manufacturers. Wind turbines produced by Chinese companies 
continue to be around one-third the price of European-made turbines 
and have had some limited success in winning onshore wind auctions 
in Europe and Asia. However, overseas expansion plans by Chinese 
wind turbine producers face obstacles due to more complex logistics 
and higher operation and maintenance costs.

 Investment in clean technology manufacturing is surging, driving price decreases but also 
creating overcapacity in solar PV and battery manufacturing 
 
 Clean technology manufacturing is surging: The sector 
accounted for 4% of global GDP growth in 2023. Clean 
technology manufacturing attracted almost USD 200 billion in 
investment last year – a 70% jump from 2022  – with solar PV and 
battery manufacturing plants leading the way. Investment in solar 
PV manufacturing more than doubled to around USD 80 billion, 
while 
investment 
in 
battery 
manufacturing 
stood 
at 
USD 110 billion. Together, both accounted for more than 90% of 
total spending on clean technology manufacturing in 2023. 
China accounted for three-quarters of global clean technology 
manufacturing investment, down from 85% in 2022, as 
investment in the United States and Europe accelerated. This 
geographic concentration is set to continue to 2030, with China, 
the United States and the European Union together projected to 
account for around 80% to 90% of manufacturing capacity for 
solar PV, wind, battery, electrolyser and heat pumps. 
This surge in clean technology manufacturing is, however, 
creating significant overcapacities – especially for solar PV and 
batteries. Existing capacity for solar modules and cells is already 
sufficient to meet demand under the NZE Scenario in 2030. 
 
As a result, prices for solar PV modules and batteries have fallen to 
historic lows. However, these facilities are also seeing relatively low 
utilisation rates and profit margins are being compressed.

Volatile wholesale electricity prices create uncertainty for renewables companies over the 
impact on revenues and future investment, underlining the need for storage and grid expansion
Wholesale electricity prices in Europe are declining, with some 
reaching their lowest levels since 2021. Lower natural gas prices, 
increased hydro and nuclear output, and reduced demand, are all 
driving down wholesale prices. As renewable capacity grows, power 
production from these sources is also reaching unprecedented levels, 
occasionally resulting in negative prices and increased volatility. For 
instance, Spain achieved record-high solar power production in the 
first quarter of 2024 with prices averaging 43 USD/MWh – and 
sometimes approaching zero. Germany and the Netherlands also 
experienced brief periods of negative prices in March 2024. While 
electricity prices in the United States have been below those in 
Europe for a while (due to its domestic natural gas production), prices 
have dipped to record lows in recent months.  
The rise in affordable electricity benefits consumers and is a welcome 
respite from the record highs during the energy crisis. At the same 
time, it increases uncertainty for renewables companies as revenue 
streams come under pressure and become more unpredictable – 
leading to greater scrutiny of the future growth prospects for 
renewables investments. Developers who choose not to co-locate 
their wind and solar PV power parks alongside battery storage or 
other sources of flexibility may see a drop in potential revenues during 
peak generation – hampering profits and discouraging investment. 
Enhanced coordination between renewables production, storage and 
demand response is needed to manage the balance between price 
levels and growing volatility. Further grid expansion is also urgently 
needed to mitigate price swings in both directions. Increased 
interconnection in Europe offers an opportunity to optimise electricity 
flow, especially when prices differ between regions. During the 
energy crisis, for example, Spain and Portugal experienced lower 
power prices than the rest of Europe due to their ample electricity 
production from solar PV and wind, while a lack of interconnection 
constrained electricity flow to higher-price markets in central Europe.

FIDs for unabated fossil fuel generation rose above their already elevated 2022 levels, reaching 
more than 110 GW, driven by unabated coal-fired power 
Despite a drop in the number of approvals for natural gas power 
plants, FIDs for unabated fossil fuel generation rose to 110 GW in 
2023, driven by a 30% year-on-year increase in coal-fired capacity. 
Even as its contribution to natural gas FIDs declined significantly and 
clean power expanded drastically, China is still the source of the vast 
majority of this unabated fossil fuel-generated capacity, accounting 
for 95% of the world’s coal-fired plants that reached financial close. 
In fact, if China were excluded, global approvals of unabated fossil 
fuel generation would have decreased by 3% last year. 
The main drivers for this proposed capacity expansion are ongoing 
security of supply concerns amid the underperformance of 
hydropower in China, inflexible interprovincial electricity export 
contracts and rising electricity demand, as well as pressure on 
provincial governments to prioritise economic growth. 
Against a backdrop of rapid expansion of renewables capacity in 
China, these new unabated fossil fuel power plants face the prospect 
of very low utilisation and reliance on capacity markets. It remains 
unclear whether this new capacity will be used primarily for flexibility 
purposes or for baseload generation, but the potential implications for 
China’s emissions in the latter case are significant given the 
government’s carbon intensity target. 
In India, new coal FIDs doubled from a year earlier, to 2 GW in 2023 
– their highest level since 2019 – as the country sought to meet 
higher-than-expected electricity demand. In the rest of the world, only 
two countries – Russia and the Philippines – approved meaningful 
increases in new coal-fired capacity for development. It appears, 
therefore, that most countries and financiers are following through 
with their pledges to stop supporting new coal-fired power plants. 
In contrast to coal, FIDs for gas-fired power generation fell by 10% in 
2023 – reaching 60 GW – although they remained above the average 
of recent years. China still approved the largest share of gas-fired 
plants, but the number dropped significantly, leading to a lower share 
of plants reaching financial close among net importers of natural gas. 
Elsewhere, FIDs for new gas plants increased in the Caspian region 
(Kazakhstan, Uzbekistan, and Azerbaijan) in particular, due to an 
influx of cheap Russian gas, while Nigeria has started to invest in 
gas-fired power stations using its domestic gas reserves. 
Elsewhere, approvals of new gas FIDs in the United States, Europe 
and Asia in 2023 were in line with recent years. At the same time, 
new projects in the Middle East and North Africa (MENA) region fell 
by 50%. Moreover, all new gas FIDs were for combined-cycle gas 
turbine plants (CCGTs), which indicates that these new projects are 
looking for operating at higher utilisation rates.

Continued growth in solar and a rebound in offshore wind lifted FIDs for utility-scale 
renewables to an all-time high in 2023
FIDs for utility-scale renewable projects increased by 15% year-on-
year to almost USD 400 billion in 2023, an all-time high. FIDs for solar 
plants represented more than half of the total at USD 220 billion – a 
new record and 2.5 times the amount approved in 2020. Wind power 
recovered somewhat from the previous year’s drop due to a strong 
recovery in offshore FIDs, while fewer onshore wind projects were 
approved. The total numbers of utility-scale deals continued to 
increase significantly as the combined value of deals above 
USD 1 billion more than doubled. 
Thanks to the European Union’s “Fit-for-55” package,  as well as 
improvements to the region’s auctions and permitting, approvals of 
utility-scale renewable projects there rose by 50%, led by Germany, 
France and Poland. Similarly, the United States saw FIDs increase 
by 20%, with a bumper fourth quarter after details of the Inflation 
Reduction Act were disclosed. Elsewhere, notable jumps were also 
observed in Saudi Arabia and the Philippines.   
In a strong year for hydropower, FIDs for large-scale hydro plants 
increased to 32 GW from 14 GW in 2022. This was the highest level 
seen since 2017 – a promising sign for a technology that will play an 
important role in providing future baseload and energy storage 
services. China dominated approvals – which approved FIDs for 
more than 23 GW – India, Indonesia, Laos, Viet Nam and Angola. 
Pumped hydro – which can serve as energy storage – constituted 
more than 70% of hydropower FIDs. (Almost all approvals in China 
and Indonesia were for storage projects.) 
In 2023, China and Egypt were the only countries starting the 
construction of new nuclear power plants (6 GW combined). The fact 
that nuclear continues to stagnate is cause for concern, even though 
additional capital is being spent on modernising and extending the 
lifetimes of existing plants, which is not captured by FIDs. 
The strong growth in approvals of utility-scale renewables suggests 
that the construction delays and supply chain constraints of past 
years have been largely resolved. However, a range of issues is still 
hampering the scaling up of renewable capacity: Advanced 
economies face land acquisition, permitting and grid connection 
delays, for example, while China is keen to keep renewables 
curtailment rates at 10%. In EMDE outside China, FIDs are still 
lagging behind – with the exception of India and Brazil – and will 
require addressing in particular the high cost of capital for clean 
energy projects. Doing so will mean establishing clear and stable 
regulatory frameworks, reducing off-taker risk and deploying 
concessional finance where necessary. For 2024, we are therefore 
expecting overall growth to continue, but growth in FIDs for utility-
scale renewables will slow in USD terms as costs continue to fall.

Electrification efforts are accelerating in advanced economies and Latin America, yet progress 
is urgently needed in EMDE outside China
There were positive changes in the grid landscape in 2023. In some 
regions, efforts to deploy networks for electrification increased, 
though the gains still fell short of what is needed. Advanced 
economies and China continue to lead investment in power grids, 
accounting for about 80% of global spending. China held its level of 
investment at USD 80 billion, with the government-owned State Grid 
Corporation maintaining its appetite for new grids and networks. 
Investment in advanced economies grew at a rate of 11% in 2023, 
led by the United States, which spent USD 100 billion – mostly on 
enhancing grid reliability and upgrading old infrastructure. Spending 
in the European Union rose strongly, reaching USD 60 billion, 
bolstered by the European Commission’s Grid Action Plan which 
targets more than USD 600 billion in spending on grids in the next six 
years. Further investments in grid interconnection are very much 
required in the European Union to facilitate the flow of renewable 
power from southern to central European markets. Generally, in 
advanced economies, a key challenge lies in sustaining investment 
growth and ensuring its effective translation throughout the supply 
chain. Power transformers in particular encounter obstacles due to 
inflationary pressures and supply shortages. 
Grid investment in EMDE outside China grew by an impressive 15%, 
reaching almost USD 80 billion in 2023. However, this increase 
masked very different patterns in the underlying regions. Investment 
in India, for example, remained flat despite the introduction of tenders 
for smart meters – of which only 10% of the government’s original 
target number have been installed. Investment in Africa and 
Southeast Asia also remained mostly unchanged. However, this lack 
of new investment was partly offset by a doubling of spending in Latin 
America as countries like Colombia, Chile, Panama and Brazil made 
efforts to increase spending. Brazil made particular progress – more 
than doubling its grid investments in 2023 and auctioning a record 
10 500 km of grid (where China State Grid won the biggest lot). 
Many EMDE are highly dependent on concessional financing and 
public funding for grid investment, which represented 80% of total 
investment in 2023. Most of Southeast Asia lacks robust regulatory 
frameworks for private participation, for example. In Viet Nam there 
is no public-private partnership (PPP) infrastructure with a clear 
revenue model. In Africa, more than half of investment comes from 
public sources – and only every third utility can recover operational 
and debt costs, even after including subsidies from governments. 
One positive exception to this is South Africa, which plans to establish 
an independent transmission project office to procure new 
transmission capacity using a build-operate-transfer model. Grid 
connectivity in Africa generally remains a challenge, however.

Sharply declining costs helped battery storage investment to double again in 2023
As we point out in our recent Battery Special Report, battery storage 
is a critical component for the energy transition. In 2023, investments 
in battery storage reached more than USD 40 billion, 90% of which 
was concentrated in China, the United States and Europe. But for 
every 1 USD invested in battery storage in advanced economies and 
China, only one cent was invested in other EMDE countries. This lack 
of investment in EMDE is mainly due the absence of clear regulatory 
frameworks as well as high capital and financing costs. 
Spending on battery storage in China increased by a factor of almost 
2.5 in 2023 to USD 11 billion. This comes as provinces rolled out 
capacity payment schemes that subsidise both discharging and 
charging. In addition, many provinces require project developers to 
include a minimum of 10% to 20% of energy storage capacity in every 
new wind or solar project. After this record year of renewables and 
battery deployment (as well as continued declines in capital costs) 
we are expecting capital expenditure for battery storage in China to 
continue growing strongly in 2024, albeit at a slightly slower pace. 
In the United States, investment also rose to USD 11 billion and we 
expect similar growth 2024. This is supported by the US Inflation 
Reduction Act and liberalised power markets that allow for favourable 
storage economics, as well as strong dynamism in the residential 
battery market. Even stronger growth has been held back by 
permitting issues and higher financing costs. 
Europe saw battery storage investment more than double to 
USD 15 billion in 2023, with behind-the-meter applications – for 
example, battery storage combined with rooftop solar – performing 
particularly well in Germany and Italy and strong growth in utility-
scale systems in the United Kingdom. Continued power price 
volatility, supportive energy storage auctions, and tax exemptions are 
expected to support a similar investment level in 2024 with 
progressively greater focus on utility-scale systems. 
The Asia-Pacific region (outside China) increased its battery storage 
spending by 40% to almost USD 2.5 billion, led by Japan and 
Australia. India did not meet its growth expectations due to project 
construction delays. For select other markets, such as Chile, 2023 
marked the take-off year for battery storage as it passed legislation 
to incentivise energy storage and announced that it would be seeking 
to procure 5.4 GWh in energy storage and non-variable renewables 
capacity by 2028 while setting aside USD 2 billion. 
Despite high expectations for future capacity growth, investment 
spending will likely moderate over time as capital costs continue to 
come down. After increasing in the previous year for the first time, 
capital costs returned to their 2021 levels in 2023 due to falling prices 
for critical minerals and expanding battery manufacturing capacity. 
Capital costs also continued to be significantly lower in China than in 
Europe or the United States.

While investment in renewables, batteries and (most recently) grids is accelerating, more effort 
is required to achieve a tripling of renewables capacity – especially in EMDE
At the COP28 international climate conference in Dubai, countries 
famously signalled the “beginning of the end” of the fossil fuel era. As 
part of this pledge, they agreed to triple installed renewables capacity 
by 2030. While global spending on renewable power hit a record 
USD 735 billion in 2023, more efforts are required for the tripling goal. 
Early signs of a potential slowdown in the growth of global spending 
on renewables, and persistently insufficient levels of investment in 
EMDE outside China, underline the need to double down if we are to 
achieve our climate and energy access goals. Ensuring further 
increases in renewables investment requires the following: clear and 
stable regulatory frameworks; policy support; simpler and faster 
permitting; grid expansion; energy storage and sources of flexibility; 
payment guarantees and more concessional finance. 
Under current policies and market conditions, renewables investment 
over the next seven years could meet around two-thirds of the 
spending necessary to triple installed renewables capacity by 2030. 
This creates a gap of around USD 400 billion per year in required 
spending on renewables between 2024 and 2030. While advanced 
economies and China will need to increase their current annual 
investments by an average of 6% to meet the cumulative required, 
the spending gap is particularly pronounced in other EMDE regions, 
where annual investment will need to increase by 30% per year. 
Key enablers for the tripling of installed renewables capacity are grids 
and battery storage. While spending on grids has been relatively flat 
in recent years, there was significant growth in 2023 and investment 
is projected to further accelerate. Despite this, in the IEA’s Stated 
Policies Scenario (STEPS), grid investment would still face a 
significant shortfall to the investment levels required for tripling 
renewables capacity. Current global spending on grids needs to grow 
by an average of 11% every year to meet the cumulative required 
investment. Tackling tariff risks, establishing forward-looking 
regulatory frameworks and financing models to mobilise private 
capital are essential to facilitate this increase in investment levels.  
Through its ability to smooth the load curve by storing electricity when 
it is produced in abundance and discharging when additional 
electricity is required by the system, battery storage is primed to 
support the variability of renewables generation. Even though it 
experienced explosive growth in the past two years, in the STEPS 
battery storage investment could only meet around two-thirds of the 
cumulative investment need. Closing the gap will require current 
annual spending on battery storage to grow by 25% every year. In 
our recent Special Report on Batteries, the IEA highlights the 
importance of clear and stable regulatory environments, as well as 
addressing off-taker risk, to attract battery investment at scale.

Fuel supply 
Fuel supply investment remains overwhelmingly focused on fossil fuels with a major new wave 
of LNG approved for development 
While power sector investment, discussed in the previous chapter, 
has shifted substantially in support of energy transitions, the same 
cannot yet be said for investment in fuel supply. Demand for fossil 
fuels remains robust as the world emerges from a period of vast 
turbulence caused first by the Covid-19 pandemic and then by 
Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. But investors peering beyond the short 
term confront a range of possible energy futures, each with very 
different implications for fuel supply projects.  
Upstream oil and gas spending is set to increase by around 7% in 
2024 – reaching USD 570 billion – building on a larger increase seen 
in 2023. This is led by national oil companies (NOCs) in the Middle 
East and Asia.  
The huge increase in revenues and profits during the price spikes of 
2021-2022 has not translated into a similar-sized rise in new capital 
expenditures. More has gone towards dividends, share buybacks 
and net debt repayment than to new investments. Upstream 
investment is focusing on projects that are considered viable even 
under challenging assumptions about future price and regulatory 
developments, typically through a combination of low costs and low 
emissions intensities. Expenditure aimed at extracting value from 
existing fields is an important element of many strategies, hitting 
USD 200 billion in 2023 for the first time since 2019. Strong cash 
positions and a hunt for advantaged resources also explain the 
volume and types of mergers and acquisitions (M&A) activity.  
Investment in LNG is set to rise with a major wave of new LNG export 
project approvals promising to increase LNG supply capacity by 
250 bcm (a 50% increase) between 2023 to 2030, with 75% of the 
growth coming from the United States and Qatar. Unlike previous 
LNG supply surges, now there are fewer committed end-use off-
takers for these additional volumes, implying a strong shift away from 
the sellers’ market seen in recent years toward a buyers’ market in 
the second half of the decade.  
Investment in refineries remained broadly flat from 2022 to 2023 and 
is expected to drop in 2024 as long lead time projects and uncertainty 
about future demand stymie final investment decisions. Refinery 
capacity growth, driven by projects in China, Nigeria, and the Middle 
East, added 1.3 mb/d of net capacity in 2023. Future capacity will 
mainly come from China, India, and the Middle East. 
Investment in coal supply increased in 2023, particularly in China, 
India, and Indonesia, with further growth expected in 2024. Coal 


 World Energy Investment 2024

Fuel supply 
investments will be heavily dependent on the demand outlook in 
China, which may slow due to economic uncertainties and rapid 
growth in renewables. 
Existing policies, plans, and commitments – like the Global Methane 
Pledge – could reduce methane emissions from fossil fuel operations 
by 50% by 2030. Achieving these reductions will require more than 
USD 80 billion in cumulative investments, led by fossil fuel 
companies. The investment will be offset by the value of the 
additional gas that will be brought to market. Financial support for 
low- and middle-income countries will be essential to reach this level 
of abatement, and even more so to achieve the 75% reduction in 
emissions by 2030 that is needed to limit global warming to 1.5 °C. 
Commitments to low-emissions fuels are rising rapidly, but from a 
very low base. Overall clean energy investment by oil and gas 
companies grew to around USD 30 billion in 2023, but this remains 
less than 4% of overall capital spending. Around half of clean energy 
investment by the oil and gas industry in 2023 involved M&A of clean 
energy companies. 
Low-emissions hydrogen is another nascent area for clean energy 
investment. Spending is growing but uncertainties, such as the future 
of demand and lack of reliable off-takers, constrain the development 
of large-scale supply projects. 
There has also been some progress with new CCUS projects. 
Around 20 commercial-scale CCUS projects in seven countries 
reached final investment decision (FID) in 2023 and according to 
company announcements, more than 110 capture facilities and 
transport and storage infrastructure projects could reach FID in 2024. 
The size of the critical mineral market in 2023 was USD 325 billion, 
shrinking due to commodity price declines, especially for battery 
materials (lithium, graphite, cobalt, nickel, and manganese). 
Diversifying supply by activating additional investment in different 
geographies, as well as stepping up demand-side measures such as 
recycling, are crucial to ensure well-balanced and resilient markets 
as energy transitions propel demand.  
Anticipated oil and gas investment in 2024 is broadly in line with the 
level of investment required in 2030 in the Stated Policies Scenario, 
a scenario which sees oil and natural gas demand levelling off before 
2030. However, global spare oil production capacity is already close 
to 6 million barrels per day (excluding Iran and Russia) and there is 
a shift expected in the coming years towards a buyers’ market for 
LNG. Against this backdrop, the risk of over-investment would be 
strong if the world moves swiftly to meet the net zero pledges and 
climate goals in the Announced Pledges Scenario (APS) and the 
NZE Scenario. 
Coal investment in 2024 is set to be far higher than the 2030 level 
seen in any IEA scenario. By contrast, despite the positive 
momentum in developing low-emissions fuel projects, investment in 
these technologies remains far below the levels projected for 2030 in 
both the APS and the NZE Scenario.

Upstream investment is realigning globally, with national oil companies taking the lead 
Based on a review of the spending plans of companies representing 
about 70% of global production, we estimate that upstream oil and 
gas investment in 2024 will increase to around USD 570 billion, up 
7% from 2023 levels, building on the 9% increase seen in 2023. 
The period since 2015 has seen a major reorientation in upstream 
investment, with greater cost discipline across company types along 
with a major shift in the approach to spending. Between 2017 and 
2024, investment by Middle East and Asian NOCs increased by more 
than 50% while investment by private companies fell by close to 20%. 
NOCs are set to provide over 40% of global upstream spending in 
2024, compared with less than 25% in 2015, and NOCs in the Middle 
East and Asia have been responsible for nearly all the increase in 
investment in 2023 and 2024. This includes investment by 
PetroChina to explore for conventional resources and develop tight 
liquids and gas basins, Saudi Aramco’s push to meet its expanded 
gas production target (even as it cuts back on plans to expand oil 
production capacity), and new sour gas field developments in the 
United Arab Emirates.  
Capital investment in existing conventional oil and gas has accounted 
for around 40% of total upstream oil and gas investment over the last 
decade. A further one-third of overall investment has been devoted 
to new field development and exploration, and most of the rest has 
flowed to US tight oil and shale gas production.  
From 2021 to 2023, nearly USD 130 billion was spent on 
conventional oil and gas exploration. More than half of this 
investment took place in China, North America, Norway, and Russia 
–  but the largest discoveries were seen in Guyana (in the Stabroek 
block) and Namibia. Exploration investment is set to increase by a 
further 15% in 2024, mainly because of increases in China and North 
America. 
Investment in US tight oil and shale gas peaked in 2018-2019, at 
around USD 130 billion per year, and has since fallen back amid 
significant cost cutting. Activity is set to remain broadly flat in 2024 
but investment will fall marginally, given cost reductions and M&A 
consolidation that should yield efficiency benefits.  
The IEA’s Upstream Capital Cost Index (UICI) increased by 6% in 
2022 because of tight markets for services and labour as well as 
increased raw material costs. However, the UICI in 2022 was still 
nearly 15% below 2014 levels due to efforts by operators to downsize 
and simplify project designs to maintain competitiveness. Inflation 
cooled in 2023 and costs could even fall marginally in 2024. The 
increases in upstream investment in 2023 and 2024 thus translate 
into a near 20% increase in upstream activity since 2022, a rate of 
increase not seen since 2010-2012.

High recent profits have been used mainly to benefit stockholders and to fund extensive 
mergers and acquisitions  
Oil and gas exploration and production companies generated 
USD 2.4 trillion in net income in 2023, down USD 1.5 billion from 
2022, but still well above the lows seen between 2015 and 2017 and 
again in 2020. Based on a review of the 30 largest upstream oil and 
gas companies, buybacks rose to historic highs in 2023, accounting 
for 20% of cash flow from operations and payouts from dividends rose 
to around 30%. For a second consecutive year, less than 50% of cash 
flow was allocated to capital expenditures. 
Many large M&A deals were completed and announced in 2023. 
Three quarters of these involved US shale companies, reflecting the 
trend towards consolidation of operational footprints in specific basins 
while also looking to increase overall production levels.  
Some of the largest deals in 2023 included Chevron’s purchase of 
PDC, with a total enterprise value of USD 7.6 billion and Occidental’s 
announced acquisition of CrownRock for USD 12 billion. Significant 
deals were also announced that are likely to be completed in 2024. 
These include: ExxonMobil’s USD 60 billion purchase of Pioneer; a 
USD 26 billion merger between Diamondback and Endeavour (the 
combined company will control close to 1 million acres in the Permian 
Basin); a USD 7.4 billion merger between Chesapeake and 
Southwestern, which will create the largest US gas producer; and 
SLB’s acquisition of ChampionX, which will enhance its services to  
the Permian basin. Chevron also announced its intention to acquire 
Hess – which has significant assets in the US oil and tight shale 
sectors, notably the Bakken basin – for USD 60 billion, but the deal 
remains subject to several legal challenges related to some of Hess’s 
non-US assets.  
M&A activity beyond North America highlights a trend for oil majors 
and NOCs to focus portfolios on specific geographies. ENI purchased 
Neptune Energy’s assets in Europe, Indonesia, and North Africa – 
locations where ENI already has a presence – for USD 2.6 billion, 
while Var Energi acquired Neptune Norge for USD 2.3 billion. 
TotalEnergies strengthened existing positions in Malaysia with a 
stake in SapuraOMV Upstream for USD 1 billion while Shell sold its 
Masela blocks in Indonesia to Pertamina and Petronas for 
USD 650 million. In 2024, a number of majors also announced a goal 
to scale down, or exit entirely, activities in Nigeria,  partly driven by 
the need to comply with sustainability goals.   
The acquisitions announced or completed in 2023 were funded either 
through cash, stock, reserve-based lending, or other investment 
vehicles, with financing coming from a variety of banks, private 
equity, and institutional lenders.

Nearly half of clean energy investment by the oil and gas industry in 2023 involved M&A of 
clean energy companies, with a particular focus on CCUS
In 2023, oil and gas companies invested USD 28 billion into clean 
energy, a 30% increase from 2022 levels. This was well below the 
65% jump seen from 2021 to 2022, reflecting in part the inflationary 
environment and supply chain issues for some renewable projects in 
the wake of the energy crisis, as well as some recalibration of 
company strategies.  
Mergers and acquisitions completed in 2023 comprised just under 
half of total clean energy investment by the oil and gas industry. The 
largest transactions included: ExxonMobil’s acquisition of Denbury’s 
CCUS network for USD 4.9 billion, which raises ExxonMobil’s CCUS 
capacity to over 100 Mt CO2 across its refining, chemicals, and 
enhanced oil recovery businesses; TotalEnergies’ USD 1.6 billion 
takeover of Eren Re, a renewable energy company, and Occidental’s 
USD 1.1 billion purchase of CarbonEngineering, a direct air capture 
(DAC) business. The ExxonMobil and Occidental deals together 
comprised the bulk of the industry’s USD 6 billion worth of 
investments in CCUS in 2023. 
Investment in solar PV and wind projects comprised more than 40% 
of total clean energy spending by the oil and gas industry in 2023. 
This includes more than USD 2.7 billion in investment by Equinor, 
USD 2.2 billion by TotalEnergies and USD 1.8 billion by Repsol 
(these three companies accounted for around 45% of total 
investment in renewables by the oil and gas industry). Despite 
announced cancellations and divestments in offshore wind projects, 
investment remained substantial in 2023. Equinor invested nearly 
USD 1.6 billion in offshore wind in 2023.  Two other recent projects  
– by bp in Korea and TotalEnergies in the United States – each 
involve around USD 2.5 billion worth of  investment. 
Capital expenditure in electrolysers reached a new high of almost 
USD 1 billion in 2023. Despite increasing policy support, the 
investment environment for low-emissions hydrogen remains fragile, 
mainly because of uncertainty about demand and the price that 
consumers will be willing to pay for low-emissions hydrogen. Other 
areas of increasing interest include EV charging infrastructure, 
enhanced geothermal systems and lithium extraction from brine. 
Clean energy investment by NOCs rose to more than USD 1.5 billion 
in 2023, representing around 5% of total clean energy spending by 
the oil and gas industry. Petronas, Sinopec, and Saudi Aramco led 
the NOC investments, which were mostly focused on solar PV and 
low-emissions hydrogen. Overall, the share of clean energy in total 
capital investment rose only marginally from 2022 levels.

Additional LNG capacity will come online at an uncertain time for demand with fewer committed 
off-takers for these additional volumes
Global LNG trade expanded by 2% (or 12 bcm) in 2023. This is the 
lowest growth rate since 2014, barring the exceptional contraction in 
2020. Growth was driven primarily by the United States on the supply 
side, which accounted for 90% of incremental global LNG volumes. 
The Asia-Pacific region led LNG demand growth, accounting for 
virtually all incremental imports. 
Since Russia’s invasion of Ukraine tightened global LNG markets, 
around 140 bcm per year of new capacity has been announced, 
representing some USD 80 billion of cumulative investment. Despite 
the cyclical nature of the oil and gas industry investment, total LNG 
trade was one of the few parts of the oil and gas sector to see 
consistent growth through the Covid-19 pandemic, Russia’s invasion 
of Ukraine and multiple other geopolitical headwinds.  
Around two-thirds of the new capacity announced since early 2022 
has been in the United States. The federal decision made in early 
2024 to pause approvals of new LNG projects does not affect the 
existing ones but raises uncertainty for the 350 bcm worth of 
developments that are seeking to raise financing and secure a final 
investment decision. 
In February 2024, Qatar announced that it would develop the North 
Field West project, adding a further 20 bcm of new LNG capacity. The 
total announced and under-construction projects would see Qatar’s 
LNG export capacity nearly double to almost 200 bcm/year.  With 
low-cost reserves, established infrastructure and well-developed 
relationships with contractors and buyers, Qatar can expand its 
capacity without needing to attract project financing or secure long-
term offtake contracts. Qatar is also looking to invest in CCUS to 
improve the environmental footprint of its LNG exports.  
LNG markets look amply supplied in the second half of the decade, 
with the potential to soften global markets and attract price-sensitive 
buyers. Nearly 250 bcm will come online between 2024 and 2030, 
with about one-third from Qatar and close to one-half from the United 
States. 
Unlike previous waves of LNG supply, there are fewer committed end 
use off-takers for these additional volumes. Of the new capacity 
coming online, 70 bcm is to be delivered to fixed destination 
terminals. Another 100 bcm has been contracted to portfolio players 
who sold the volume to end consumers using a mix of short, medium 
and long-term contracts. The remaining 80 bcm of new capacity does 
not yet have firm off-takers and would therefore currently be sold on 
the spot market. If future demand for LNG does not materialise, or if 
regional price benchmarks fall to low levels, the sellers of these 
uncontracted volumes would be the most exposed.

Around 0.8 mb/d of new refining capacity is set to come online in 2024, but uncertainties 
around future demand growth weigh on new investment decisions 
In 2023, investment in oil refineries (excluding maintenance 
spending) was just under USD 37 billion, similar to 2022. China saw 
the largest share of investment globally, followed by Africa, mainly 
related to spending in Nigeria’s Dangote refinery. The industry 
witnessed the addition of 1.3 mb/d of net capacity in 2023, and 
refinery runs increased to 82.3 mb/d in 2023. Heightened activity in 
China largely drives the 1.5 mb/d increase from 2022 levels. 
A further 0.8 mb/d of new refinery capacity is set to be added in 2024, 
but investment is expected to decline globally by 5%. China and India 
will likely account for almost half of the expected spending. Between 
2020 and 2022, an average of around 1.3 mb/d of capacity was shut 
down annually, but the pace of capacity closures is slowing: an 
estimated 300 kb/d is expected to be taken offline in both 2023 and 
2024. Global refinery runs are expected to rise by 1 mb/d in 2024, a 
slower pace compared to 2023, due to lower runs in Russia, 
unplanned outages in Europe and decelerating growth in China.   
The sanctions and embargoes on Russian oil trade flows had limited 
effect on Russian oil export volumes, but their impact on export 
revenue was notable. The redirection of trade routes maintained 
Russian export volumes at 7.4 mb/d in 2023. However, this resulted 
in a 25% reduction in oil export revenue to USD 14.6 billion in 2023. 
Following record margins and profits in 2022, refining margins began 
to trend downward in 2023 even though strong middle distillate 
cracks have kept margins well above historical averages. Despite the 
healthy margin environment, a new wave of investment in refining 
capacity is unlikely. Building new refineries entails significant capital 
commitment and long lead times (typically 5-10 years), and 
uncertainties surrounding long-term demand prospects present 
challenges for investment decisions. Unless the region experiences 
strong anticipated demand growth or expected operating costs are 
highly competitive, justifying investment decisions for large-scale 
greenfield refineries will be challenging. Future investment is 
therefore likely to be further concentrated in a few regions such as 
China, India, and the Middle East. 
Amid a multitude of challenges, an increasing number of refiners are 
opting to rationalise capacity or shift to low-carbon feedstock 
processing. Following recent decisions by Petroineos and Shell to 
close capacity in 2025, bp recently announced a restructuring of 
operations, with crude processing at the 257 kb/d Gelsenkirchen site 
in Germany being reduced by around 80 kb/d in 2025.

Investment in methane abatement is increasing, but a step change is needed in both spending 
levels and emissions transparency 
Methane emissions from the energy sector remained near a record 
high in 2023. However, with several major policies and regulations 
recently announced – and with 157 countries joining the Global 
Methane Pledge – the world could soon reach a turning point in 
efforts to reduce methane emissions. If all existing pledges on 
methane were to be achieved in full and on time, methane emissions 
from fossil fuels will decrease 50% by 2030. In many cases, however, 
pledges still need detailed plans.  
Methane abatement in the oil and gas industry is one of the lowest 
cost options to reduce greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions anywhere 
in the economy. Achieving current pledges and plans will require 
around USD 80 billion of investment to 2030. Investment levels that 
are needed to cut emissions by 75% by 2030 – the reduction 
assumed in the IEA’s Net Zero Emissions by 2050 (NZE) Scenario – 
would 
require 
an 
additional 
USD 
90 
billion. 
The 
total 
(USD 170 billion) includes USD 135 billion in capital investment and 
USD 35 billion in operating costs.  
This total amount of spending required to 2030 is less than 5% of the 
income the industry generated in 2023. Fossil fuel companies carry 
primary responsibility for financing methane abatement at their 
operations and currently there is very limited public reporting on the 
amounts companies spend on reducing methane emissions. 
Additional transparency is needed to track progress and the efforts 
companies are making. Regulations and policies could also help.  
Some spending on methane abatement will require special attention, 
especially to reduce emissions in low- and middle-income countries 
and for measures that do not generate meaningful return over their 
lifetimes. Several efforts are underway to increase financing and 
investment for methane abatement. These include international 
emissions pricing schemes and regional emissions trading markets, 
as well as direct public funding, emissions standards for market 
access and price premiums for low-emissions fuels.  
In terms of publicly announced funding for methane abatement, the 
Bipartisan Infrastructure Law and Inflation Reduction Act in the 
United States will provide USD 4.7 billion to plug old oil and gas wells 
and USD 1 billion in financial and technical assistance to cut 
methane emissions. The World Bank’s more than USD 255 million 
Global Methane and Flaring Reduction Fund aims to help cut 
emissions in developing economies. Additional programs are also 
emerging: the Climate Bonds Initiative, for example, is developing 
guidance to incentivise capital markets to finance methane emissions 
abatement.

Coal investment teeters between strong short-term demand and longer-term uncertainty
In 2023, coal demand growth in several countries, most notably 
China, India, and Southeast Asia, led to a 6% increase in investment 
in coal supply. A further 2% global increase is likely in 2024.  
Coal companies saw income surge in 2021 and 2022, which 
increased their capacity and appetite for investment in new supply 
and ushered in a heightened period of merger and acquisition activity.  
China is by far the largest coal producer and consumer globally, and 
it is also the main market for coal exports. Coal shortages in 2021, 
combined with very high prices in 2022, increased the focus on 
energy security and investment in domestic coal supply. Annual coal 
investment increased by nearly 10% on average between 2018 and 
2023. This resulted in increased production which, combined with a 
high level of imports, led to a surge in coal stocks.  
In 2024, the combination of high stocks, lower coal prices and an 
expected slowdown in economic activity is likely to reduce Chinese 
coal demand growth. We estimate that annual investment in coal 
supply will increase by around 1% in 2024 to roughly USD 100 billion 
(more than 60% of the global total). The use of coal in the power 
sector in China is coming under pressure from competition with 
renewables. Coal demand in aggregate is set to enter terminal 
decline, limiting the need for any future increases in coal investment 
in the country. 
India is the world’s second-largest coal producer and consumer. The 
government has announced plans to increase domestic production to 
meet rising demand and investment has been growing steadily since 
2021. Investment increased by 5% in 2023 and is set to expand by 
nearly 10% in 2024 to around USD 15 billion. The Ministry of Coal is 
relying on a series of measures to boost coal supply, including 
commercial auctions with a revenue share mechanism, allowances 
for the sale of additional coal production and rolling auctions. 
Nonetheless, based on current trends, demand is set to rise faster 
than supply, which means India could soon overtake China to 
become the world’s largest coal importer. 
Elsewhere, Australia and Indonesia are the two largest coal exporters 
globally and investment in these two countries is set to expand by 
around 5% in 2024 (following a 12% increase in 2023). Poland has 
seen an increase in coal investment in recent years as the European 
Union weaned itself from Russian imports. This increase is likely to 
be short-lived given the European Union’s climate targets and the 
increasing share of renewables in new capacity additions. The United 
States and other advanced economies are likely to see a continued 
downward trend in investment.

Supported by commercial prospects for sustainable aviation fuels, liquid biofuels could see a 
wave of new investments in the coming years
Transport biofuel capacity additions in 2023 reached a decade-high 
of 270 kb/d, a 6% increase from 2022 that translates into an 8% 
increase in investment. The growth stems mainly from the expansion 
of renewable diesel refining capacity in the United States, increases 
in bio-ethanol capacity in Brazil and growth (from a low base) in bio-
jet kerosene in China, Brazil, and Europe. 
A number of traditional biofuel projects have been announced in 
recent years, including a doubling of capacity at OCI Global’s green 
methanol facility in Texas (which will have a capacity of around 
4 kb/d). However, most biofuels investment increases are set to 
come from new capacity for so-called “drop-in fuels” (substitutes for 
petroleum products that are not subject to any blending limits). For 
example, in Spain, Cepsa and Bio-Oils have begun construction of a 
USD 1.3 billion sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) and renewable diesel 
plant, with a capacity around 10 kb/d. Brazil’s Acelen will invest 
USD 2.4 billion in a 20 kb/d green diesel plant which will come online 
in 2026. In China, American Honeywell, which teamed up in 2022 
with Oriental Energy to build a 20 kb/d SAF plant, announced that its 
refining technologies will also be used by Sichuan Jinshang 
Environmental Protection Technology Co. in a new 6 kb/d SAF plant.  
Major energy companies are also looking to invest in the expansion 
of biofuels. For example, Repsol announced plans to diversify into 
biofuels by retrofitting existing fossil diesel facilities and securing

2019 to 2024 to six commercial projects. Other governments have 
announced bioenergy support such as a USD 21 million grant from 
the UK Department for Transport’s Advanced Fuels Fund for a new 
waste-to-fuels project, and USD 6 million from Canada’s Clean Fuels 
Fund to help Azure Sustainable Fuels develop the front-end 
engineering and design for SAF production in Manitoba, with first

Investment in electrolysers is driven by higher deployment but also by higher financing costs
Investment in electrolysers is set to increase by close to 140% in 
2024 to USD 5 billion. This is mainly because of new capacity 
additions as well as cost inflation in the sector and resulting increases 
in equipment prices and financing costs. Most of the electrolyser 
capacity coming online in the next few years aims to replace existing 
uses of hydrogen (refining and the chemical industry). These 
investments are generally perceived as lower risk than generating 
new potential sources of demand (e.g. mobility and conversion into 
low-emissions hydrogen-based fuels). 
China is set to see a 140% increase in investment in electrolysers in 
2024, accounting for 40% of global investment. A low-emissions 
hydrogen and ammonia production plant costing USD 900 million is 
expected to begin operations in 2024, producing around 32 kt of low-
emissions hydrogen annually. By 2026, more than 20 projects above 
100 MW, with combined capacities around 6.9 GW, could be 
operational in China.  
Europe is expected to see a 120% increase in investment in 2024, 
accounting for less than one-third of global investment in 
electrolysers. Major projects include USD 270 million for a 100 MW 
electrolyser project being developed by GALP in the port of Sines, 
Portugal (capable of producing around 15 kt hydrogen per year) and 
just over USD 7 billion (USD 4.5 billion of debt, USD 2.3 billion of 
equity and USD 300 million of grants) for the construction of a low-
emissions steel plant in Sweden by H2 Green Steel. A number of 
projects have suffered from cost inflation and overruns: the Bad 
Lauchstädt Energy Park project in Germany, for example, which 
includes hydrogen production, storage and transport, has seen costs 
rise to USD 230 million when it received FID in 2023, an increase of 
50% over initial estimates. 
The United States, accounting for about 15% of global investment in 
hydrogen today, is expected to see a 120% rise in 2024, incentivised 
by programs such as the 10-year Clean Hydrogen Production Tax 
Credit which provides up to USD 3 per kilogram of low-emissions 
hydrogen. A number of large-scale projects are under development, 
including a USD 550 million liquid hydrogen production plant in 
Arizona under development by Fortescue that will be able to produce 
11 kt of hydrogen per year from 2026.  
Internationally, Fortescue is also set to spend USD 150 million on an 
electrolyser in Australia, scheduled to be commissioned in two 
phases, one in 2025 and the second in 2028. In Saudi Arabia, the 
world’s largest low-emissions hydrogen plant is under development 
by NEOM Green Hydrogen – a  USD 8.4 billion project due to start 
production in 2026. In Oman, ACME Group is poised to invest 
USD 480 million in a low-emissions hydrogen project, due to come 
online in 2025.

New policy momentum is supporting investment in CCUS worldwide, from direct capture 
projects to transport and permanent storage, but risks remain 
Around 20 commercial-scale carbon capture, utilisation and storage 
(CCUS) projects in seven countries reached FID in 2023. More than 
110 capture facilities, as well as transport and storage projects, could 
reach FID in 2024. If all projects are developed on time, there will be 
a near-tenfold increase in CCUS investment by 2025 (to 
USD 26 billion). Global CO2 capture capacity would increase to 
430 Mt CO2/year by 2030, and global CO2 storage capacity would 
reach 620 Mt CO2/year. However, it remains an open question 
whether all of these projects will materialise.  
Governments sought to significantly accelerate the deployment of 
CCUS in 2023, including initiatives such as the Carbon Management 
Challenge. Nearly USD 20 billion in public funding was allocated to 
CCUS projects in 2023 including: USD 1.7 billion announced by the 
United States as part of a Funding Opportunity for carbon capture 
demonstration projects; USD 1.2 billion announced by Denmark 
under its CCUS Fund; and more than USD 500 million to four CCUS 
projects under the European Union's Connecting Europe Facility. 
Risks include delays which may occur between the announcement, 
the securing of proposal funding and project mobilisation.  
Oil and gas companies continue to develop new CCUS projects. For 
example, ADNOC took FID on a 1.5 Mt CO2/year project in 
September 2023 to build one of the largest integrated CCUS projects 
in the Middle East. Several CCUS M&A deals involving oil and gas 
companies were also announced in 2023 and 2024. 
Many direct air capture (DAC) projects are advancing, and 
investment is set to rise to USD 660 million in 2024 (a 140% increase 
from 2023). The 36 kt CO2/year Mammoth DAC plant in Iceland 
started operation in May 2024, and the Stratos project in Texas – 
which will cost USD 1.3 billion and be the world's largest DAC facility 
with a capacity of 500 kt CO2/year – aims for a mid-2025 start. 
Expansion plans have also been announced by 1PointFive and 
Carbon Engineering (now Occidental), with a target operation year of 
2035, although locations and the fate of the captured CO2 (storage or 
use) have not yet been finalised. 
Investment in CO2 transport and storage infrastructure is set to 
increase to USD 1.4 billion in 2024 (a tenfold increase from 2023) as 
new business models are developing to create CCUS hubs that more 
efficiently transport and store gases. Three FIDs taken in 2023 
include the Porthos project to carry gas to depleted petroleum 
reservoirs 
in 
the 
North 
Sea 
(USD 1.4 billion, 
handling 
2.5 Mt CO2/year). The extension of the Alberta Carbon Trunk Line by 
Wolf Midstream Canada will allow 7 Mt CO2/year to be permanently 
stored. A CO2 transport and storage hub in Louisiana by 
CapturePoint Solutions is set to store more than 10 Mt CO2/year.

Recent critical mineral price declines challenge the diversity and reliability of future supply
Following a price surge that began in 2021, 2023 saw a significant 
decline in prices for most critical minerals and metals. Prices for 
battery minerals fell especially sharply, with lithium prices plunging 
75%. Inventory overhang in the downstream sector (such as battery 
cells and cathodes), weaker-than-expected demand growth and an 
increase in overall supply all contributed to the decline. Uranium was 
a notable exception and saw a sharp price increase in 2023 due to 
renewed momentum for nuclear power and a lack of new supplies. 
In early 2024, copper prices increased because mining outputs were 
lower than expected with the closure of the Cobre Panama mine and 
a reduction in production guidance by Anglo American, which  shifted 
the market balance to a slight deficit. Nonetheless, battery mineral 
prices remain subdued, prompting some high-cost producers to 
curtail output and place facilities on care and maintenance. Industry 
revenue fell by 10% in 2023 and operating profit fell by 34%, which 
had a major impact on capital investment plans. 
Our assessment of 25 large mining companies suggests that 
investment in critical minerals grew by 30% in 2022 and by 10% in 
2023 (6% when adjusted for cost inflation). Exploration investment 
grew by 15% in 2023, with Canada and Australia registering the 
largest increases, followed closely by Africa. Lithium saw much larger 
gains with a 50% increase in investment, and an 80% jump in 
exploration spending.  
Despite demand growth, the size of the market for critical minerals 
contracted by 10% to USD 325 billion in 2023. This figure would have 
been 20% higher if prices had remained at 2022 levels. While current 
supplies of most materials appear sufficient, the risks of market 
tightness and price volatility are constant as countries continue to 
pursue their energy and climate goals. Escalating geopolitical 
tensions, exemplified by trade restrictions on a number of elements 
in 2023 – including gallium, germanium, graphite, and rare earths – 
further compound these risks. Lower prices have contributed to cost 
reductions for many clean energy technologies, but they risk slowing 
efforts to diversify supply chains.  
The geographic concentration of production has remained largely 
unchanged in recent years. One exception is nickel, where supplies 
have become more concentrated: between 2021 and 2023, 
Indonesia's share of mined nickel production increased from 34% to 
52% and its share of refined nickel increased from 23% to 37%.  
The current investment landscape could lead to further supply 
concentration for several critical minerals, especially in the 
processing and refining segments. Efforts to enhance the diversity 
and reliability of critical mineral supplies therefore remain vital. 
Mobilising investment in diversified projects, boosting innovation and 
recycling and promoting environmental and social considerations in 
policy and investment decisions must therefore remain priorities.

Risks of over-investment in traditional elements and under-investment in low-emissions 
alternatives 
With the anticipated rise in 2024, overall investment in oil and gas 
supply is at the level projected in 2030 in STEPS, a scenario which 
shows coal, oil and natural gas demand levelling off or declining 
before 2030. The increase in 2024 investment is driven by national 
oil companies in the Middle East and Asia, although this does not 
necessarily coincide with expected growth in output. In the case of 
oil, increased near-term production is concentrated in the United 
States, Guyana, Canada, and Brazil.  
Even though oil and gas investment is broadly aligned with the 
direction of travel in energy markets, as represented by the STEPS, 
this trajectory is associated with some significant commercial and 
environmental risks. Global spare oil production capacity is already 
close to 6 million barrels per day (excluding Iran and Russia) and 
there is a shift expected in the coming years towards a buyers’ market 
for LNG. Against this backdrop, the risk of over-investment would be 
strong if the world moves swiftly to meet the net zero pledges and 
climate goals in the Announced Pledges Scenario (APS) and the 
NZE Scenario. Oil and gas investment in 2024 is set to be around 
35% more than the level required in 2030 if governments achieved 
their climate targets in full and on time (as in the APS), and more than 
double the 2030 level needed if consumption falls in line with a 1.5 °C 
target (the NZE Scenario). Differences in coal industry are even more 
stark: investment in 2024 is more than double the 2030 level in the 
STEPS, almost four times more than in the APS, and five times more 
than in the NZE Scenario.  
In the APS, the trajectory for oil and gas consumption is curbed by 
rapid growth in renewables, efficiency, and other clean energy 
sources. There is no need in this scenario for further oil and gas 
exploration, as already-discovered fields are sufficient to cover 
projected demand. Investment is needed in some new oil and gas 
projects, in maintaining production at existing fields and in safely 
decommissioning or repurposing existing operations. In the NZE 
Scenario, rapidly falling demand means that there is no need for long 
lead time conventional oil and gas projects. In both scenarios, 
investment in cutting greenhouse gas emissions from operations – 
most notably in reducing methane emissions – is essential. 
The oil and gas industry generated very large profits in 2022 and 
2023. The focus on companies has mainly been to return profits to 
shareholders through share buybacks and dividends. The oil and gas 
industry is well placed to scale up many crucial technologies for net 
zero transitions, especially those with strong overlap with existing 
strengths such as offshore wind, low-emissions hydrogen, bioenergy 
and CCUS. To date, only a few companies have markedly increased 


 World Energy Investment 2024 
 
PAGE | 127  
Fuel supply 
their spending in these areas, and less than 4% of the industry’s total 
capital investment was invested into clean energy in 2023. 
Scaling up clean energy investment rapidly is essential to mitigate 
future price risks while reducing emissions. Investment in hydrogen 
and CCUS has been growing rapidly in recent years, but from a very 
low base. Investment in bioenergy has risen modestly in recent 
years, but remains far below the levels needed by 2030 in the 
STEPS. To get on track with the APS and NZE Scenario, clarity over 
policy frameworks and incentives will be essential across all clean 
fuels and technologies to bring forward announced and new projects.

Energy end use and efficiency 
End-use investments in 2023 show a mixed picture, with high inflation and interest rates 
affecting governments’ ability to offer support
The year 2023 has been a challenging for investments in the energy 
efficiency and electrification of energy end-use sectors (Buildings, 
Transport, and Industry). Investment plateaued in 2023 at 
USD 646 billion: The buildings sector experienced one of its sharpest 
year-on-year declines (-5%), and industry investment fell by 8%, but 
this was partially offset by a 6% increase for transport, thanks to rapid 
growth in EV sales. The United States, Europe, and China account 
for about 75% of global end-use investment.  
This slowdown comes at a time when the case for the affordability of 
both energy efficiency technologies and financing have been affected 
by the macroeconomic environment. Inflation not only made energy 
and technologies more expensive to buy, but high interest rates also 
meant that obtaining financing at reasonable terms became more 
difficult and more costly – especially as the housing market has been 
slow to cool down and disposable income has shrunk.  
High interest rates are also eroding governments’ fiscal room and 
their ability to provide incentives for energy efficiency and 
electrification measures. In recent months, several countries have 
announced plans to reduce – or scrap in some cases – incentives 
provided for EVs, heat pump purchases or building renovations. 
Despite lower gas prices, the level of industrial activity has also been 
slower to recover from the combined effects of the global energy and 
economic crises.  
The question for the investment outlook in 2024 and beyond, is 
therefore whether spending can continue to be resilient in the face of 
waning government support as well as growing pressures on 
household budgets and company balance sheets.  
In the transport sector, the recent drop in battery costs and the 
ongoing price wars between EV manufacturers (aimed at seizing 
market share) seem to provide hope for continued growth – albeit at 
a slower pace than before. In some large EMDE, EV sales are poised 
to take off, notably with the arrival of Chinese manufacturers in Latin 
America and the development of an EV industry in India. The effect 
of measures aimed at onshoring manufacturing capacity (e.g. the 
Inflation Reduction Act in the United States and the Carbon Border 
Adjustment Mechanism in Europe) should also increase spending on 
EV production outside China.  
The outlook for investment in the building sector is very uncertain. On 
the one hand, the construction industry has been more resilient than 
anticipated, especially in China, with a focus on completing projects. 
But in advanced economies, uncertainty over the continued 
availability of public incentive packages dampens optimism about 


 World Energy Investment 2024 
 
PAGE | 133  
Energy end use and efficiency 
prospects for the next few years. In EMDE, weak building codes and 
poor enforcement continue to be a drag on investment.   
Despite easing inflationary pressures and lower gas prices, the level 
of investment in energy efficiency in industry in 2024 remains 
dependant on the level of growth in industrial activity in Europe and 
China, for which the outlook remains quite uncertain. 
For 2024, we project that aggregate spending in end-use sectors will 
be largely unchanged from the previous year. A continued, though 
slower, decline in building investment should be mostly offset by a 
recovery in the industrial sector and continued growth in transport.

… while inflation, higher interest rates and a constrained fiscal space continue to challenge the 
outlook for 2024
In 2023, energy efficiency investments in the building sector stood at 
around USD 280 billion – a 7% drop from the 2022 peak – thanks to 
higher interest rates and the winding down of several large European 
government incentive programmes. This decline is projected to 
extend into 2024 due to continued pressures around construction 
financing costs and further phase-outs of government led support 
initiatives. From 2019 to 2022, stimulus spending and large structural 
government programmes in Europe, including public efficiency 
investment schemes in Germany and Italy, had supported average 
annual investment growth of 15%. But 2023 marked a turning point, 
where borrowing and construction cost pressures around the world 
slowed the delivery of finished buildings.  
Several large economies saw a reduction in the construction of 
buildings in 2023. Construction in Brazil fell by around 2% from a year 
earlier, while China experienced a drop of 16%, significantly 
impacting global growth in construction spending and delivery of 
green buildings. Most of Europe has seen a drop in construction 
values, which translates into fewer efficient buildings being 
constructed. In 2023, the United Kingdom saw a 12% drop in housing 
deliveries, while they fell by 6% in France.  Germany issued 27% 
fewer building permits in 2023 compared to the previous year. 
Europe presented a mixed picture of energy efficient investment in 
2023. Following a ruling in November 2023 by Germany’s highest 
court that a EUR 6 billion climate budget was unconstitutional, the 
KfW development bank and BAFA export credit agency began to 
curtail support programmes such as the “Bundesförderung für 
Effiziente Gebäude” (Federal Funding Scheme for Efficient 
Buildings), which reducing funding by 34% in 2023. Together with 
cutbacks to other incentive schemes, Germany’s investments in 
energy efficient buildings dropped by 27% compared to 2022. 
The United Kingdom saw an increase in energy efficiency investment 
through the Energy Company Obligation, spending GPB 1.48 billion 
in 2023, a more than threefold increase from 2022. The Public Sector 
Decarbonisation Scheme reached around GBP 1.3 billion in 2023 
with a focus on improving heating systems, and a further commitment 
to invest  GBP 1.17 billion from 2024 onward. 
In Italy, incentives in the building sector have led to more than 
EUR 80 billion of investments in 2023 – of which more than half, or 
EUR 44.4 billion was linked to the country’s so-called Superbonus 
programme for homeowners. Since taking effect in July 2020, the 
Superbonus scheme – which reimbursed 110% of the cost of energy 
saving renovations – has led to EUR 102.7 billion in efficiency 
improvements. As of January 2024, however, the Superbonus is only

available for condominiums and the maximum tax credit has been cut 
to 70% for 2024 and will drop to 65% in 2025. A slowdown in 
investments is therefore anticipated. Italy’s association of private 
construction contractors foresees that such changes will trigger a 
27% drop in home renovation investments and a 4.7% decline in 
spending on new construction in 2024. The first two months of 2024 
saw investment growth slowing to  % from 4.8% a year earlier. 
The EU has further strengthened the Energy Efficiency Directive 
(EED), setting a target of 4% improvement in energy efficiency per 
year and an 11.7% annual reduction in energy consumption by 2030. 
The EED is complemented by a strengthened Energy Performance 
of Buildings Directive (EPBD), which aims to boost the energy 
performance of buildings and requires new buildings to be solar-
ready. The EPBD aims to reduce the primary energy use of 
residential buildings by 16% by 2030 and by 20% to 22% by 2035. 
The United States has continued to support investment in improving 
the energy efficiency of buildings through the Inflation Reduction Act 
of 2022. The Department of Energy is investing around 
USD 705 million on building energy efficiency and weatherization 
through the State and Community Energy Program. Similarly, the 
Rural Energy for America Program (REAP) will focus on investments 
in rural communities through grants and guaranteed loans to rural 
communities and small and medium-sized companies (SMEs) for 
renewable energy and energy efficiency improvements. 
In February 2023, the African Development Bank introduced the 
Africa Super ESCO Acceleration Programme, which provides 
USD 5 million to support the establishment of public Super Energy 
Service Companies (Super ESCOs) in Rwanda, Senegal  and South 
Africa. Standards that further promote energy efficient buildings 
across the African continent, such as the EDGE certification scheme 
from the International Finance Corporation, are also growing.  
Alongside improvements to the National Construction Code, Australia 
recently launched several programmes to support building energy 
efficiency. The government established the Household Energy 
Upgrades Fund, which includes AUD 1 billion for the Clean Energy 
Finance Corporation to partner with lenders to offer low-cost finance 
for home energy upgrades, and AUD 300 million dedicated to social 
housing. The Small Business Energy Incentive supports SMEs with 
a 20% tax deduction for eligible upgrades, such as electric heating 
and cooling systems and efficient appliances. 
Despite these initiatives, we estimate that global investments will fall 
by a further 3.5% in 2024 to USD 270 billion. Governments need to 
recommit to the doubling the rate of energy efficiency improvement 
through both a combination of direct support for homeowners and 
businesses to invest in efficiency and to help structure markets to 
incentivise private investment. For example, the explicit inclusion of 
building efficiency in green taxonomies and directives, such as in 
Europe and an emerging system in Canada, can start unlocking 
private financing at greater scale.

Sustained policy support is key to accelerate heat pump uptake
Throughout 2023, heat pump sales slowed, aligning with the broader 
investment trajectory seen in the building sector. This trend was 
particularly pronounced in Europe, where sales declined by 5% over 
the year. The United States also witnessed a near 17% decline 
during this period. These reversals in sales represent a departure 
from previously optimistic trajectories, despite the pressing global 
need for increased adoption of heat pumps to facilitate the transition 
to net zero emissions by 2050.  
That said, this outcome was not entirely unforeseen, as several 
factors contributed to the reduced enthusiasm of consumers to invest 
in heat pumps in 2023. High interest rates deterred potential buyers, 
while the substantial upfront costs associated with heat pump 
installation posed financial challenges. Additionally, declining natural 
gas prices rendered electric heating options less economically 
appealing, further dampening demand. Uncertainties, including 
delays in the adoption of heat pump-related regulations in the 
European Union and the prolonged timeline for rebate distribution for  
heat pump installations in the US exacerbated the situation. 
Nonetheless, there are still reasons to expect a brighter future for the 
industry. In the United States – where the overall market for HVAC 
equipment experienced a year-on-year decline –  heat pumps still 
accounted for 55% of heating system sales as of December 2023, far 
outpacing a 20% drop in gas equipment sales. Meanwhile, nine US 
states – which  together represent nearly a quarter of residential 
energy consumption – recently agreed to a collective target for new 
heating and cooling equipment sales to reach at least 65% by 2030. 
Additionally, there are tax credit schemes available through the 
Inflation Reduction Act that incentivise heat pump installations, 
further bolstering the outlook for the market. In Europe, while certain 
countries experienced declines in sales, others saw notable 
increases. Heat pump sales rose in Germany and the Netherlands 
for the first three quarters of 2023 – thanks to the carry-over effect of 
the previous year’s sales spike – but eventually fell back amid market 
pressures and the weakening of government incentives. Such 
fluctuations illustrate the importance of effective regulations 
supporting the adoption of heat pumps and enhancing building 
efficiency. 
China emerged as the market where heat pump sales thrived the 
most in 2023, with robust 12% growth from a year earlier. China 
currently leads the world in new heat pump installations, 
commanding more than a quarter of global sales.  This trend has 
been bolstered by ongoing government initiatives aimed at promoting 
the adoption of clean energy equipment in various industries, such 
as agriculture. China’s experience contrasts with Japan’s relatively 
mature market, which saw a 10% decline in heat pump installations 
in 2023.

Financing indicators for green building investment paint mixed picture for the years to come
Despite the decrease in investment in energy efficiency and 
electrification in the building sector, some financial indicators point to 
a brighter future. As with other energy sectors, rising prices and 
higher interest rates eroded the affordability of the entire construction 
value chain, pressing the pause button on the wave of the green 
buildings and renovation. But there are signs that construction costs 
have begun to stabilise and interest rates are expected to ease 
slightly over the next few quarters.  
The number of sustainable bonds listing green building as a target for 
their proceeds had already begun to decline in 2022. But in 2023, the 
volume of issuances remained relatively stable, in contrast to the 
declining trend in the rest of the market for green, social and 
sustainability (GSS) bonds.  
Historically, most green building bond sales have been driven by 
either by sovereign issuers (e.g. France, Belgium, Hong Kong) or 
public or quasi-public actors like Fannie Mae in the United States or 
KfW in Germany. But recently there has been a trend among private 
financial institutions and large utilities to issue debt to finance green 
buildings – though it remains unclear whether the proceeds of these 
bonds can be deployed fast enough to support the 2.5% annual deep 
retrofit rate required in the NZE Scenario. 
Meanwhile, since the beginning of the inflationary period in 2021, the 
number and value of current long-term mortgages – typically good 
proxies for measuring renovation activity –  have been declining both 
in the European Union and the United States. This is concerning, 
since all the IEA’s scenarios assume a greater role for debt to fund 
renovations. Today, most retrofits are financed through owners’ 
equity, which greatly limits their uptake. 
Therefore, making sure the right consumer financing tools are in 
place will be crucial. Today, many options exist to finance the 
purchase of a vehicle or even a home, but few mechanisms provide 
readily available options to finance green buildings or renovations. 
Some governments and banks – mainly Australia, the United 
Kingdom, and United States – are experimenting with green 
mortgages, but uptake has so far been limited due to many factors, 
including low customer demand and complicated application 
processes, as well as a lack of lending capacity or willingness by 
banks to offer these products. In France, for instance, a recent 
initiative to provide zero-interest loans for small renovations was 
largely snubbed by banks and consumers alike until the rules were 
simplified and revamped in 2024. Financial institutions often point to 
a lack of available data and the difficulty of finding the right balance 
between the financial risk and return on smaller loans.

Energy end use and efficiency 
Banks have identified a need to better address financing for energy 
efficiency and electrification of the building sector, however:  Today, 
37 of the world’s 100 largest commercial banks say they have 
implemented internal green building policies, although they still 
appear to struggle with communicating these policies across their 
branch networks. In June 2023, the International Sustainability 
Standards Board issued two new IFRS global sustainability 
disclosure standards that will require increased and more granular 
reporting from homebuilders and real estate companies on their 
building energy profiles. 
Innovative solutions exist to increase the amount of financing for 
green buildings, and they have been tested in various countries. In 
the United States, the Property Assessed Clean Energy Programs 
have shown a way to decouple the split incentives for owners – who 
must shoulder the cost of green investment  but do not necessarily 
benefit from the resulting savings – by linking renovation costs to the 
value of the property itself. In Europe, some of the largest banks have 
already begun to implement voluntary Mortgage Portfolio Standards 
to incorporate climate targets into their lending practices.  
About 80% of the world’s population are homeowners and unlocking 
at least a portion of the trillions of dollars’ worth of equity embedded 
in this housing pool could also be leveraged to help finance 
renovations. While many borrowers may not qualify for new 
mortgages – since homeowners tend to skew toward the top the age 
pyramid – public guarantees for home-equity loans could help to de-
risk commercial financing for renovations. 
Overall, these difficulties are compounded by a regulatory landscape 
which can be perceived as a moving signpost. As public budgets 
become tighter in many parts of the world, governments are tempted 
to cancel or scale back incentive mechanisms for renovations or 
green buildings, thereby reducing demand. One concrete example is 
from makers of insulation materials, who invested heavily in 
manufacturing capacity on the assumption that demand for 
renovation materials would rapidly materialise at scale. But recent 
hesitation by several European countries over whether to maintain 
incentive programmes have put these investments at risk and in 
2023, revenues from the insulation industry started to decline.

Nearly one in five new cars sold in 2023 was electric, although more than 90% of sales were in 
China, Europe, and the United States
In 2023, approximately 14 million electric cars were sold worldwide, 
constituting nearly one-fifth of total car sales. Sales of electric cars in 
2023 were 35% higher than in 2022, a trajectory that – if maintained 
– would still be compatible with the targets set in the NZE Scenario.  
Electric cars accounted for 18% of all cars sold in 2023, up from a 
14% share in 2022 and just 2% in 2018. These trends indicate that 
growth in electric car markets remains robust as the technology 
matures. Battery electric cars accounted for 70% of the electric car 
stock in 2023. But sales continue to remain heavily concentrated in 
the traditional key markets. In 2023, almost 95% of all global electric 
car sales took place in China, Europe, and the United States.  China 
led the way at almost 60% of sales, Europe at nearly 25%, and the 
United States at 10%. These regions also show significant adoption 
rates, with electric cars representing more than one-third of new car 
registrations in China, one quarter of registrations in Europe and 10% 
in the US market. In other developed car markets like Japan and 
India, EV sales remain limited. 
China ended its national subsidies for EV purchases in 2022 after 
more than a decade – yet its EV industry and the level of EV sales 
remained resilient. While the growth rate for Chinese sales fell in 
2023 to just over 35% it was from a high base, which speaks to the 
dynamism of the country’s EV market. 
Sales growth in the United States slowed somewhat but remained 
robust (up 42% year-on-year). The Inflation Reduction Act (IRA) and 
the revised qualifications for the Clean Vehicle Tax Credit, along with 
price cuts, seem to have helped in sustaining sales in 2023, despite 
initial worries that stricter domestic content requirements for EVs and 
batteries might trigger bottlenecks or delays. 
In Europe, new electric car registrations reached nearly 3.2 million in 
2023, marking a substantial increase of almost 20% compared to 
2022. European governments have historically offered some of the 
world’s most generous incentives for the purchase of new electric 
vehicles. However, these  subsidies are beginning to wind down, 
notably in France, where a  EUR 7000 (~USD 9000) per vehicle 
bonus is set to drop to EUR 4000 in 2024 (USD 5100). Germany has 
also ended its EUR 4500  (USD 5800) subsidy for the purchase of a 
new EV.  
Sales increased significantly in EMDE regions, but still accounted for 
a small share of the global EV market. In Latin America, electric car 
sales reached almost 90 000 units in 2023. In Brazil, electric car 
registrations nearly tripled year-on-year to more than 50 000 units, 
supported by the entry of imported Chinese models, a trend we could 
expect to see more of as Chinese carmakers prioritise EMDE 
markets over the United States and Europe. EV registration in India

increased by 70% year-on-year thanks to purchase incentives under 
the Faster Adoption and Manufacturing of Electric Vehicles (FAME-
II) scheme, supply-side incentives under the Production Linked 
Incentive scheme, tax benefits and the Go Electric campaign. 
In 2024, global EV sales growth is expected to slow to around 20%. 
Contradicting forces are at play: A certain level of market maturity 
might have been reached in China, while the reduction or cancellation 
of some subsidies in China, Europe and India cloud the horizon for 
future sales. On the other hand, several factors should continue to 
support growth, including: recent price drops in many EV models; 
renewed activity in the commercial fleet segment and new emissions 
standards such as those proposed by the US Environmental 
Protection Agency. More targeted policy incentives, such as a French 
programme offering a EUR 100 per month EV lease to low-income 
households, could also be of help. (The French scheme was 
suspended in 2024 after more than 50 000 households signed up).  
Despite drops in EV prices across the range of models, the largest 
EV manufacturers have been able to maintain their profit margins by 
delaying the pass-through of falling battery prices to their customers. 
Lower battery costs, supported by record levels of investment in 
manufacturing, should lead to further reductions in EV retail prices 
and increased sales. 
But as the market enters a new era of slightly slower growth, the car 
industry – which has seen many new entrants in recent years – is 
likely to experience lower market capitalisations, increased 
consolidation, spending restraint and eroding margins amid price 
competition and slowing sales. The cancellation of two long-awaited 
IPOs of the battery and EV branches of Volkswagen and Renault 
points to a degree of investor scepticism about whether  EV sales will 
be able to keep growing at the rates seen in recent years, especially 
in Europe. The story seems to be different in EMDEs, where in India 
for instance, companies like Exicom are starting to look to the capital 
markets for funding expansion into EVs. Announcements of new 
capital expenditures and additions of new battery manufacturing 
capacity continue to point to positive prospects for the sector globally. 
Global sales of electric buses reached about 50 000 units in 2023, 
which represented 3% of total bus sales. Roughly  60% of those sales 
took place in China, thanks to early policy support and development 
of domestic production capacity. Battery electric buses reached a 
43% share of new city bus sales in the European Union, and some 
progress was also made in Latin America and Kenya. In EMDE 
regions, mass transit public transportation investments have been 
supported by concessional finance, notably in India where multilateral 
development banks (MDBs) have worked with the government in its 
efforts to deploy a fleet of 50 000 electric buses and the 
corresponding charging infrastructure. In Dakar, Senegal, the all-
electric Bus Rapid Transit system started operation in late 2023 and 
was co-financed by the World Bank, which provided USD 300 million. 
This push from MDBs can both establish strong order pipelines for 
electric buses and help develop local manufacturing capacity.

This slowdown has taken place despite stubbornly high commodity prices across the board 
and rising margins, notably in the cement and fertiliser sectors
Investment in energy efficiency and electrification in the industrial 
sector shrank in 2023, cancelling out the gains seen in 2021 and 
2022. This was driven mainly by a fall in investment in China, the 
largest materials producer in the world. The country is experiencing 
challenges from a declining property sector and lower growth and 
demand prospects. Depending on estimates, the property sector 
accounts for between 14% and 30% of China’s GDP. Not only is the 
property sector itself very large, but it also drives many related 
industries such as steel and cement. The global economic slowdown 
and historically high inflation worldwide discouraged investment in 
other regions, which have remained flat.  
Industrial energy efficiency investment was down by 30% between 
2022 and 2023 in China, though it is expected to increase by 5% in 
2024. Until 2021, roughly one-third of all energy efficiency and end-
use investment in industry took place in China – but this share is 
expected to fall to 22% in 2024. As part of its 14th Five-Year Plan for 
National Economic and Social Government, China has set long-term 
objectives for 2025, emphasising the importance of low-emission and 
“green” development among heavy-polluting manufacturers such as 
steel companies. In practice, however, most subsidies to steel firms 
have gone to support investment in expanding capacity and capital 
equipment rather than targeting R&D expenses or investment in 
efficiency gains. 
Compared with global capital expenditures across all industrial 
sectors (iron and steel, cement, aluminium, copper, and chemicals), 
energy efficiency and other end-use investments have stalled, 
representing 13% of total investment in 2023 compared to 14% in 
2017. This suggests that even in a period of high energy costs such 
as 2021-2022, investments in energy efficiency and end-use have not 
been a priority. 
The surge in commodity prices since 2021 has prompted industrial 
sectors to focus on higher-margin products and consolidation among 
smaller producers. Driven by the high price of natural gas – a key 
component of most fertilisers – fertiliser makers have enjoyed record 
profits in recent years. Nonetheless, this has not translated into 
bigger investments in energy efficiency. 
In 2024, industrial sectors are expected to face growing turbulence. 
Global excess capacity is increasing, while demand shows signs of 
slowing, especially amid the potential for a downturn in Chinese 
demand if the real estate crisis drags on. Steel and cement 
production are declining in many countries, notably in Europe, while 
capacity is rising in Southeast Asia, the Middle East, and Africa.

Energy efficiency is one of the key pillars to keeping 1.5 °C within reach, but the world is not 
investing nearly enough
During COP28, governments agreed on a set of key climate pillars 
for keeping the door open to net zero emissions by 2050 and holding 
global warming below 1.5 °C. One of these pillars is to double the 
rate at which the energy intensity of the global economy improves. 
Today the annual rate of improvement stands at about 2%. The NZE 
Scenario requires this rate to double by 2030. Decarbonizing the 
power and fuel sectors is crucial, but the largest emissions come from 
end uses and efficiency improvements are pivotal in curbing fossil 
fuel demand. To achieve a doubling of energy intensity improvement, 
annual investment needs to triple within a little more than five years. 
By 2030, investment in buildings nearly triples in the NZE Scenario 
(as the share of deep retrofits reaches 2.5% per year), the number of 
heat pumps installed triples, and every new construction is net zero 
carbon ready. Clean investment in transport quadruples as 70% of 
new cars more than half of buses and trucks sold are electric, 17 
million charging points become available and new internal 
combustion engine vehicles are at least 20% more efficient. While 
industry is one of the most difficult sectors to decarbonise, it is also 
the one where funding yields the best results. Only 6% of the total 
increased 
investment 
delivers 
20% 
of 
the 
total 
intensity 
improvements by 2030. 
Annual trajectory of EV sales and retrofits in the NZE Scenario 
 
 
The upcoming years are pivotal for aligning the energy system with 
the NZE Scenario. Recent reductions in government support and 
slower growth in EV sales, heat pumps, and construction highlight 
the correlation between end-use efficiency investment and subsidies. 
However, public spending faces challenges due to inflation and 
higher interest rates. The key question will be whether the business 
case for electrifying transport, renovating buildings, and improving 
industrial efficiency becomes strong enough to attract significant 
private sector investment

R&D and Technology innovation 
Divergent trends for R&D funding and the scaling up of private capital, identified in last year’s 
report, continued throughout 2023
The amount spent globally on clean energy R&D grew again in 2023, 
extending post-pandemic gains. A 13% rise in US government 
spending on energy R&D helped keep global public energy R&D 
spending on a steady upward trend, reaching USD 50 billion. Energy-
related R&D spending in the corporate sector stood at 
USD 160 billion. Although the pace of growth was slower than the two 
previous years, the momentum of investment in clean energy 
technologies was maintained, led by the automotive sector. 
This growth trend is driven by three factors. On the public side, 
government commitments to reduce emissions are being taken 
seriously, and research funding is being strategically directed to 
areas that still show a gap between future deployment needs and 
technology readiness. Secondly, there is a fast-growing recognition 
at the highest levels of government that clean energy technologies 
can offer major opportunities for investment and growth and that 
benefits will accrue to those offering the most competitive products. 
Packages of government incentives aim to steer sectors towards low-
emissions options and these are spurring corporate R&D to maintain 
firms’ competitive advantages. These factors are evident in China, 
which further increased its share of energy R&D in 2023. 
For smaller, innovative clean energy companies, however, 2023 was 
a difficult year. The types of capital on which start-ups rely – such as 
venture capital (VC) or venture loans – became significantly more 
expensive amid rising inflation and higher interest rates. Not only did 
higher interest rates make alternative investments relatively more 
attractive, but inflation and weaker outlooks for consumer spending 
lengthened the expected time that start-ups would need to reach 
profitability. As a result, many investors either moved their money out 
of VC funds, or the funds offered smaller amounts of equity or debt 
to start-ups – enough to keep them afloat until visibility improved. 
Based on data from the first quarter of 2024, we expect start-ups to 
find it difficult to raise capital through at least the end of 2024. 
When it comes to energy innovation investment, emerging market 
and developing economies (EMDE) remain under-represented. 
Considering the active role these countries need to play in energy 
transitions, and the greater impact of higher interest rates on the cost 
of capital for innovators in these countries, their limited investment 
participation is a concern. In 2023, just 6% of public R&D spending 
and 3% of corporate R&D came from EMDE (outside China). For 
start-ups in some EMDE countries – where VC ecosystems are less 
developed than in advanced economies – borrowing rates have been 
reported to be as high as 25%. However, with an 85% increase in 
fundraising by Indian start-ups, the overall EMDE share of energy 
venture capital rose from 3% to 9% of the total in 2023.

Clean energy R&D dominates the global total, and announced government initiatives point to 
continued future spending growth, but in 2023, R&D for unabated fossil fuels also increased
Globally, public spending on energy R&D rose by 7% in 2023, to 
almost USD 50 billion according to our estimates. This continues a 
trend that has buoyed innovation in recent years despite 
macroeconomic uncertainty. However, whereas the growth in 2022 
was mostly driven by spending by the Chinese government and its 
major energy-related state-owned enterprises, in 2023 nearly half the 
growth came from North America, especially the United States. 
Collectively, budgets for US energy research at the national energy 
laboratories, Department of Defense and public grants given to 
energy R&D and demonstration projects rose by more than 
USD 1.3 billion in 2023. 
Despite slower growth in 2023, we estimate that China exceeded the 
7% per year planned increase in energy R&D spending in its 14th 
Five-Year Plan (2021-2025). This maintains China’s status as the 
largest public spender on energy R&D. However, compared to 
previous years, the share of growth in Chinese public energy R&D 
related to fossil fuel technologies was higher. As a result, the global 
share of public energy R&D devoted to clean energy topics dipped 
significantly for the first time in our dataset, after stagnating in 2022. 
New government initiatives in this area include Korea’s List of Critical 
and Emerging Technologies and a Special Act to create the support 
instruments for these technologies, which include rechargeable 
batteries, advanced mobility, advanced nuclear, biotechnology, 
aerospace and marine technology and hydrogen. Japan launched a 
programme to provide USD 300 million per year to support 
collaborative research on storage batteries, hydrogen and new 
bioproduction technologies. Austria’s new Climate Neutral Industry 
initiative includes USD 260 million of R&D funding. The United 
Kingdom announced an USD 28 million fund for interdisciplinary, 
use-inspired research on clean energy and climate change through 
international partnerships. 
Public energy R&D spending in EMDE rose in 2023 but, outside 
China, its share remained at 6% of the global total and was 
concentrated in a small number of G20 countries. Under Brazil’s 2024 
G20 Presidency  the Group has begun work to help EMDEs develop 
effective long-term clean energy innovation systems so that they can 
participate more fully in emerging clean energy technology value 
chains. As an example of targeted action in 2023, Colombia 
established a Committee of Ministers for Sustainable Productive 
Development, which seeks to guide the government's support for 
development and commercialisation of technologies for climate 
neutrality, including lithium production.

Globally, energy-related companies are investing more in R&D to stay competitive and much of 
this is tied to rising revenue at Chinese firms or more competition among car companies
Since 2019, corporate spending on energy R&D has grown by an 
average of 7% per year – more than three times faster than the global 
GDP. This reflects the ability of large firms to continue to invest to 
develop their competitive advantage in a rapidly evolving technology 
landscape. In some cases it is also a product of counter-cyclical 
government support that has been earmarked for low-emissions 
technologies in these companies. Major automotive manufacturers 
and their suppliers are an example of this situation and their receipt 
of sizeable public loans for electrification R&D since 2020 was 
explored in WEI-2023. Another factor boosting global growth is the 
allocation of higher sums to energy R&D by Chinese firms. Not only 
are the revenues of Chinese energy-related firms rising faster than 
many of their international counterparts, but they also increasingly 
need to innovate to stay competitive domestically and internationally. 
Of the top twenty energy-related corporate R&D spenders in our 
dataset, thirteen are automotive companies based in the United 
States, Germany, Japan or the Netherlands. The three non-
automotive companies in the top ten are Chinese: PowerChina (a 
state-owned power plant engineering firm), PetroChina (a state-
owned oil company) and State Grid Corporation (a state-owned 
electricity network operator). The French energy equipment 
manufacturer Schneider Electric also features among a “Top 20” 
group dominated by vehicle makers and auto parts suppliers, but the 
oil majors do not feature. Despite record revenues in 2022 and 2023, 
the oil major with the highest R&D spending, Shell, is below 
PetroChina, Sinopec and Saudi Aramco. In past years, the oil majors 
have been higher up the list. 
In the automotive sector, Volkswagen and Mercedes Benz increased  
R&D spending by a combined USD 5.5 billion, or 19%. This 
represents impressive growth at a time when sales of internal 
combustion engine vehicles are in decline and electric car sales, 
while growing, typically have thinner margins for the supply chain. 
Two companies focusing on electric vehicles, BYD and Tesla, rank 
thirteenth and fourteenth, respectively. 
Outside the typical scope of the energy sector, corporate R&D has 
been rising in so-called hard-to-decarbonise sectors such as long-
distance transport and heavy industry. This is a positive sign that 
companies, especially in the areas of trucks and cement, are 
embracing the challenge of rapidly changing their long-standing 
technological practices. Yet for chemicals, the recent upward trend 
stalled in 2023. There was no noticeable growth in annual R&D 
spending by companies engaged in the aviation, rail and shipping 
sectors.

Early-stage VC investment in energy start-ups fell in 2023 for the first time since 2014, largely 
because of macroeconomic conditions, but is set to get back on track in 2024
From the perspective of financial flows, 2023 was a disappointing 
year for venture capital (VC) investment in energy. Whereas 2022 
achieved unprecedented levels of deals and funding, both early- and 
growth-stage equity investment declined in 2023. Early-stage 
funding, which supports entrepreneurs with technology testing and 
design – and plays a critical role in honing good ideas and adapting 
them to market opportunities – fell by 4%. Growth-stage funding, 
which needs more capital but funds less risky innovation, slid 21%. 
This outcome can largely be attributed to macroeconomic conditions 
rather than a loss of confidence in clean energy technologies. With 
higher interest rates, fund managers found VC investments less 
attractive than other investment classes. For hardware developers, 
this was coupled with a more challenging path to market as their input 
costs rose and potential customers tightened their belts. These 
trends were already apparent in 2022 and are still expected to 
reverse 
as 
the 
macroeconomic 
environment 
improves. 
Encouragingly, there are also reasons for optimism about VC for 
energy technology innovation. Energy VC investment did not fall as 
far as other VC segments, such as digital, which saw funding drop by 
more than 70% compared with 2021. 
The number of specialist VC funds targeting clean energy and other 
climate segments continues to grow. These funds are often backed 
by investors that impose criteria – such as potential for deep 
reductions in greenhouse gas emissions – on the use of the money, 
and in some cases allow returns to accrue over longer timeframes. 
This additional investor focus on energy technology innovators is one 
reason behind the rise in the number of early-stage deals for energy 
start-ups in 2023. The overall investment trend appears therefore to 
stem from a reduction in the amount invested per deal and a possible 
postponement of very large deals, especially growth equity deals. 
Such an approach may be expressed as “wait-and-see” via the 
provision of “bridge finance” – which suggests there could be an 
upward correction if macroeconomic conditions improve. 
Data from the first quarter of 2024 indicate that the investment 
environment has improved somewhat and delayed early-stage deals 
are getting done. We estimate that early-stage VC funding for energy 
will return to growth in 2024, but the growth-stage capital shortage 
will continue. This is despite some big deals already being completed. 
Several start-ups have already raised USD 250 million or more in 
2024, including Deep Green (waste heat), Electra Charging (vehicle 
charging), Fervo Energy (geothermal), H2 Green Steel (hydrogen 
and steel projects), Koloma (hydrogen), NexAmp (solar projects) and 
Sunfire (electrolysis). These deals are similar in magnitude to the 
biggest energy VC transactions in early 2023.

In 2023, energy-related VC deals were more likely to be for early-stage companies and those 
developing projects rather than hardware
In the three years to 2023, start-ups based in the United States raised 
more than those in other regions. Most investors in these deals were 
US-based. While China, Europe and India have consistently 
represented growing shares of the total as investment has increased 
in recent years, this is not evenly distributed between the different 
funding stages or among technologies. The share of Chinese start-
ups is highest in energy storage and batteries, where it now stands 
at 35%, while Indian start-ups have been most successful in the 
mobility sector – including electric urban vehicles and charging 
infrastructure – where they represent a 6% share. 
European start-ups have significantly increased their share of global 
energy efficiency VC funding. In absolute terms, the amount of 
money raised in 2021-2023 was nearly three times more than in 
2018-2020, reaching USD 1.5 billion in 2023. The share of growth 
equity in this total has also increased, indicating greater success for 
European energy efficiency start-ups as they scale up. However, 
across energy sectors, there has been a decline in the number of 
growth-stage deals – when a defined product or service is in 
development – relative to the number of deals for early-stage start-
ups, when the business is still being defined. This trend has been 
most visible in the North American data: Between 2016-2018, the 
average growth-to-early stage VC deal ratio was more than one 
growth-stage deal and USD 11 of growth equity for every early-stage 
deal and USD 1 of early-stage equity. In the 2021-2023 period, this 
ratio was 0.7 growth-stage deals and USD 7 of growth equity per 
early-stage deal. In absolute terms, nearly three times as much 
funding went to early-stage deals in 2023 compared to 2018, while 
growth-stage deal value fell by 35%. For the first time in our dataset, 
European energy start-ups in aggregate raised more growth equity 
for every early-stage deal than their North American counterparts. 
The relative attractiveness of the two regions for scaling up a new 
energy technology, which has traditionally favoured US start-ups in 
terms of the availability of growth equity, may be converging. 
Much of the need for clean energy technology innovation relates to 
the development of hardware solutions, and energy start-ups 
developing hardware continued to attract most of the VC funding. 
However, growth-stage funding for energy start-ups dropped further 
in 2023 after a drop in 2022 and now stands at around 75% of total 
funding. Based on data for the first quarter of 2024, this level is 
dropping further: just 69% of growth-stage VC funding was for 
hardware developers. 
Hardware products can take many years of VC funding to be 
developed to meet customers’ needs, but these start-ups can achieve

R&D and Technology innovation 
high valuations and pay-offs for investors. By contrast, energy 
software and project development companies can have a quicker 
path to market but offer lower returns. The decline in 2022-2023 likely 
reflects lower willingness among VC funds to make large, long-term 
bets in the current macroeconomic environment. Thus, the share of 
hardware developers in early- and growth-stage deals tends to shift 
with changing risk perceptions. This indicates that governments could 
preferentially offer counter-cyclical support to hardware developers 
during periods when capital is temporarily more costly. 
In a given technology area, the share of VC deals represented by 
project developers can indicate technology and policy maturity. One 
of the biggest deals in 2023 saw 14 different investors take 
USD 1.6 billion equity in H2 Green Steel, a Swedish project 
developer for hydrogen-based steel production. The same company 
raised a further USD 300 million from three different investors in 
January 2024. The ability of H2 Green Steel to attract these levels of 
growth equity signals that its backers are increasingly comfortable 
with the level of technology risk and market outlook for hydrogen 
production and low-emissions steel.  
In contrast, renewables project developers in 2023 attracted the 
smallest proportion of renewables VC investments in more than a 
decade (excluding 2020, an outlier year due to the global pandemic). 
After 2011, when many VC investors made losses on solar 
companies that did not successfully scale up, there was a shift toward 
investment in solar project developers or companies that help 
building owners to install proven technologies: Between 2014 and 
2018, project developers attracted more than 60% of VC investment 
in solar, peaking at 70% in 2018. This increase accompanied an 
industry shakeout triggered by cheaper, Chinese-made crystalline 
photovoltaic panels. This was partly a reaction to how risks and 
innovation incentives evolve in a maturing sector. However, VC 
investors and start-ups have once again shifted its focus: In 2023, 
owners of new solar hardware technologies received 70% of solar VC 
investment. 
This recent shift back to hardware shows that, even in sectors like 
solar, which many people consider to be a mature and stable 
technology, government policies can have a significant impact on 
innovation. While the trend may relate, in part, to consolidation in the 
market for renewable energy project developers, another factor is 
likely to be the renewed interest of many governments in hosting solar 
manufacturing facilities. Knowing that government support is 
available for setting up a production facility that can compete with 
imports incentivises researchers to push forward the technology 
frontier to compete for the domestic market. Start-ups developing 
new approaches to solar photovoltaics – such as thin film, flexible 
designs and products that integrate solar cells – raised more VC 
money in 2023 than in the previous eight years combined.

R&D and Technology innovation 
Big corporations cut back equity investment in energy start-ups more sharply than other types 
of VC investors, with the exception of industrial companies 
In 2023, large companies spent USD 5.5 billion buying equity stakes 
in smaller energy-related start-ups with potential strategic value for 
the investing firm. This injection of corporate venture capital (CVC) 
has risen dramatically in recent years, as a way for big corporations 
to acquire knowledge, new technologies and business models quickly 
and at low cost. The nimbleness of start-ups and the “optionality” for 
investors can be particularly valuable under conditions of uncertainty, 
competition and budget pressures. While CVC remains lower than 
corporate R&D budgets (which usually target the development 
products that fit well with existing business lines) it has notable 
strategic value when disruption from mass-produced, modular and 
quick-to-scale technologies is anticipated.  
For start-ups, CVC complements other sources of funding and can 
accelerate scaling up by providing access to corporate experience 
and resources, especially for manufacturing, as well as access to 
consumers around the world. 
Apart from 2020, when the global pandemic triggered a market 
contraction, 2023 was the first year since 2017 that energy-related 
CVC declined. This follows a broader dip in energy-related VC activity 
in 2023, but the drop in CVC was more pronounced than the overall 
VC trend. As a result, CVC fell from 22% of total energy-related VC 
in 2022 to 17% in 2023. The change was largest for early-stage VC, 
for which CVC fell from 17% to 11% of the total. This raises important 
questions about the availability of this strategic source of capital 
during periods of macroeconomic uncertainty. 
Two sectors that have underpinned much of the recent growth in 
energy-related CVC – oil and gas and automotive – made cuts to their 
investment activities. For some firms, this was accompanied by 
messages about refocusing CVC on technologies closer to their core 
business and integrating start-up activities with corporate strategy. 
Saudi Aramco said in January 2024 that it would increase the capital 
of its CVC fund and prioritise clean energy technology. Volvo 
announced it would follow some other automotive companies, such 
as BMW, in deepening its start-up incubation and collaboration 
efforts, as a complement to CVC. In 2023, Porsche moved the 
headquarters of its VC fund and restructured it for efficiency. 
Increased investment by companies in industrial sectors helped to 
offset some of the CVC decline. Some of these deals were large: The 
Chinese aluminium firm Shandong Weiqiao Pioneering Group  
invested USD 1 billion in the EV maker Rox Motor; the Chinese 
chemicals company Yibin Tianyuan Group participated in a 
USD 375 million round of funding for Libode New Material, a battery 
cathode start-up; and ArcelorMittal took part in a USD 120 million 
capital round for Boston Metal, a US iron electrolysis start-up.

Implications 


 World Energy Investment 2024

R&D and Technology innovation 
Clean energy policies are fuelling innovation spending, but with high capital costs slowing 
progress for some technologies, maintaining momentum may require targeted measures
Several conclusions can be drawn from the 2023 trends presented in 
this chapter. First, governments are continuing to increase spending 
on R&D and demonstration projects in keeping with their pledges to 
cut emissions while maintaining economic growth. Second, policies 
that push the private sector to adopt low-emissions technologies are 
inducing more corporate R&D in the automotive and heavy industrial 
sectors. Third, the cost of capital matters most for early-stage and 
smaller companies, for whom the pool of available finance has 
shrunk since 2022. 
It is encouraging for the prospects of addressing climate change that 
many governments are successfully expanding their budgets for 
clean energy R&D, despite competing shorter-term priorities for 
government funds. Grants for applied research and demonstration 
projects are essential for shepherding the next generation of energy 
technologies to market at lower cost. However, governments should 
also be concerned by the apparent loss of momentum in equity 
funding for clean energy start-ups, given the urgency of the 
challenge. While recent years have demonstrated that higher 
government ambitions and expectations for tackling climate change 
translate quickly into the founding of more innovative energy 
companies and a corresponding flow of VC capital, it has also 
revealed the volatility of this funding in a changing interest rate 
environment. 
Compared with other segments, clean energy start-ups developing 
new hardware ideas require more capital and are often more reliant 
on large equity deals to pay for testing and manufacturing facilities. 
When access to this type of finance tightens, high-potential 
technologies 
risk 
being 
abandoned 
or 
delayed. 
However, 
governments can use tools such as non-dilutive project debt, equity 
or guarantees to accelerate the sector’s transition to cheaper forms 
of capital for scale-up. 
The VC data also shows some changes in the technology focus 
areas for investors, as revealed by their selectiveness in a more 
capital constrained environment. Funding for electric vehicle start-
ups, for example, has noticeably declined. Despite continued growth 
in electric vehicle sales, these are capital-intensive firms and riskier 
bets when the world’s largest car companies concentrate their 
resources on this sector. In comparison, VC investment continues to 
flow to newer areas with less dominant industrial players, including 
critical minerals, battery components, direct air capture of CO2, 
ammonia production and renewable heat. These areas benefit 
strongly from the entry of new VC investors that have exclusive 
mandates to support climate mitigation technologies, including 
hardware for challenging areas like industrial heat.

R&D and Technology innovation 
Regionally, China is estimated to be the biggest spender on energy 
innovation. China drove the year-on-year growth in corporate R&D 
and, along with the United States, led the growth in public energy 
R&D. While the link between spending and innovation outcomes is 
unpredictable and not always direct, it is clear that China’s increased 
spending on energy R&D over the past decade has borne fruit. 
China’s presence is growing in the global market segments for high 
quality electric vehicles, batteries, heavy equipment for power plants 
and solar PV manufacturing. Each of these areas incorporates a 
higher share of Chinese domestic innovation than ten years ago. 
The resulting competition within global markets for clean energy 
technologies is positive for consumers and for accelerating energy 
transitions. However, this good news is contingent on the free flow of 
knowledge to stimulate further innovation, and access to markets to 
encourage innovators to compete. Governments around the world 
face a challenge to balance the goal of raising the global pace of 
energy innovation with securing a return on their R&D investments in 
terms of domestic economic prosperity. The policy toolbox for 
addressing this challenge includes the prioritisation of technologies 
that are a good fit with existing local industries, measures to support 
effective innovation 
ecosystems and innovation related to 
maintaining the competitiveness of manufacturing processes and 
high added value products. 
Except for VC fundraising, especially in India, clean energy 
innovation investment in EMDE did not noticeably grow in 2023 as a 
share of the global total. There is much that governments, multilateral 
institutions and philanthropists can do to support these countries to 
contribute actively to clean energy technology development. 
Domestic 
expertise 
and 
private-sector 
advocates 
can 
be 
instrumental in helping EMDE countries to advance their energy 
transitions and make technology choices that fit the local context. As 
an example of how more attention to this issue has led to creative 
solutions, in May 2023, the International Finance Corporation took a 
USD 20 million equity stake in Boston Metal – a start-up developing 
an early-stage technology for low-emissions steel production – which 
is contingent on construction of the company’s first facility in Brazil.

The United States, the second largest economy in the world, accounts for 15% of global clean 
energy investment, and remains a major investor in oil and gas
The United States has taken important steps to scale up investments 
in clean energy. These investments overtook the spending that went 
to fossil fuels in 2020 – when oil and gas investments fell sharply – 
and increased to USD 280 billion in 2023 from USD 200 billion in 
2020. The country also invests a significant amount in oil and gas: for 
every USD 1.4 spent on clean energy in 2023, US investors directed 
1 USD to fossil fuels. (That is slightly below the global average of 
USD 1.8.) 
New legislative vehicles supporting clean energy investment in the 
United States are the Bipartisan Infrastructure Investment and Jobs 
Act of 2021, which allocated around USD 550 billion for clean energy 
and infrastructure, and the US Inflation Reduction Act (IRA) of 2022, 
which provides an estimated USD 370 billion in funding to promote 
energy security and combat climate change.  
These incentives are prompting faster deployment and the 
development of new clean energy manufacturing capacities. By the 
end of 2023, the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act allocated 
nearly USD 75 billion to clean energy, including projects related to 
grid improvement and expansion (USD 21.3 billion), clean energy 
demonstrations 
(USD 21.5 billion), 
energy 
efficiency 
(USD 6.5 billion) and clean energy manufacturing and workforce 
development (USD 8.6 billion). Meanwhile, tax credits from the IRA 
make clean energy projects in the United States more competitive 
and incentivise investment in vulnerable energy communities. 
The increase in clean energy investment moves capital flows towards 
alignment with the long-term goal, announced in 2021, to achieve 
economy-wide net zero emissions by 2050. However, clean energy 
investors have faced some headwinds, including high financing costs 
due to higher benchmark interest rates (that reached over 5.0% since 
the summer of 2023). Permitting issues and the finalisation of tax 
credit guidance under the IRA have also meant delays in some cases. 
The United States is the world’s largest oil and gas producer, and its 
spending on fossil fuel supply – more than USD 200 billion – accounts 
for around 19% of the global total. The United States is home to 
around 40% of the wave of new LNG export capacity that is set to 
come to market in the second half of the decade. US spending on 
clean fuels is also on the rise, amid a surge of interest in opportunities 
for low-emissions hydrogen and CCUS.  
In the IEA’s Announced Pledges Scenario (APS), lower demand for 
fossil fuels brings a significant reduction in upstream and midstream 
spending, while investments in low-emissions power double and in 
energy efficiency nearly triple by 2030.

Latin America has been a leader in clean energy but needs to step up investment to stay ahead
Latin America and the Caribbean (LAC), a diverse region of more 
than 30 countries, accounted for 7% of the world’s GDP in 2023, 
while income per capita is slightly below the world average. LAC 
countries have generally been prone to high inflation, high debt and 
fiscal issues, although sovereign credit ratings vary from debt in 
default (Venezuela) to upper-medium grade (Chile). LAC had a 
period of slow growth the past decade, where the region’s GDP 
expanded at about one-third of the average global pace. This partially 
explains why energy investment has been relatively low. 
Fossil fuels represent two-thirds of the energy mix, well below the 
world average of 80%. The use of coal is quite low, but oil use –
mainly for transport but also for industry – is relatively high, despite a 
share of biofuels in road transport that is twice the global average. 
The use of renewable energy has been central to LAC, where 
renewables represent a 60% share of the power mix (double the 
world average). LAC has a legacy of strong use of hydropower for 
electricity production, with many large dams built long ago. While its 
growth prospects are limited, hydro remains important for flexibility. 
There has been strong momentum for clean investments in parts of 
the region, and spending in fossil fuels has also risen in recent years. 
LAC’s overall ratio of clean energy to fossil fuels investment just 
under half the 2023 global average.  
Energy investment is set to reach USD 185 billion in 2024, a record 
high. The power sector accounts for over 35%, while fossil fuels 
supply represents almost 55% and end-use less than 10%. 
Renewables and storage continue their strong growth, with solar 
leading on deployment (including small-scale projects), investment in 
storage accelerating in Chile (to reduce transmission bottlenecks) 
and even offshore wind picking up in Brazil and Colombia. Many 
countries are also developing long-term hydrogen strategies and 
implementing pilot projects, especially in Brazil (where a 1.2GW plant 
obtained environmental permits in late 2023) and Chile. Investment 
in the end-use sectors is low: Less than a third of LAC countries have 
minimum energy performance standards for industrial motors or 
household appliances, for example, and few have implemented 
mandatory building codes.     
Almost half of the 33 LAC countries pledged to reach net zero 
emissions by 2050, including Brazil, Chile, Costa Rica and Colombia. 
Average annual clean energy investment over the 2026-2030 period 
needs to increase four-fold compared to the preceding decade in 
order to get on track for these goals, which would result in fossil fuel 
consumption peaking this decade. Efforts to reduce the cost of capital 
will be critical, and will require improving the economic proposition for 
clean investments while also reducing macroeconomic risks.

Clean energy investment in the European Union has risen as governments respond to the 
global energy crisis and the cut in Russian gas supplies 
The European Union (EU) is one of the leading regions for clean 
energy deployment and policy momentum has intensified in many 
countries, and at EU level, due to the global energy crisis that 
followed Russia’s invasion of Ukraine and its subsequent cut in gas 
deliveries. In large part because of its reliance on imported fuels, the 
European Union stands out as one of the regions that has the highest 
clean energy to fossil fuels investment ratios: it spends more than 
USD 10 on clean energy for every USD 1 invested in fossil fuels. 
In 2023, investment in renewables generation totalled almost 
USD 110 billion, an increase of more than 6% from the previous year. 
Although the cost of capital for renewables has seen a slight rise due 
to supply chain and inflation pressures, renewable investments 
remain very cost-competitive. Denmark and Germany remain at the 
forefront of the wind power sector in Europe, despite ongoing 
profitability challenges. Spain has led the surge in solar adoption and 
has seen wholesale electricity prices fall to record lows during periods 
of high solar output – bringing some benefits for consumers but also 
a warning sign for some investor revenue streams and the prospects 
for future investment.  
A good balance of investment across generation, grids, storage and 
demand-side flexibility is key. Investment in power grids rose by more 
than 20% in 2023, nearly reaching USD 65 billion, a very positive 
development that reflects the need for more grid interconnection, 
especially to facilitate power flows to central European markets.  
Meanwhile, there was also ongoing growth in oil and gas 
investments, which reached over USD 30 billion in 2023. Investment 
in liquified natural gas (LNG) reached nearly 7 billion, while Europe 
added more than 50 bcm/year of extra LNG import capacity to switch 
away from Russian gas, mainly via Floating Storage Regasification 
Units (FSRUs). The Netherlands, Italy, Finland, Greece and 
Germany have all acquired or leased FSRUs. 
The European Union has set a target to reduce net greenhouse gas 
emissions by at least 55% by 2030, relative to 1990 levels, and to 
reach climate neutrality by mid-century. Alongside a range of policies 
and targets focused on increased deployment of renewables and 
energy efficiency, there is also a focus on the diversity and resilience 
of clean energy supply chains, both for manufacturing and for critical 
minerals. The European Commission adopted the Net Zero Industry 
Act in June 2024, to bolster the manufacturing of clean technologies, 
with the objective of meeting 40% of the EU’s deployment needs by 
2030 and reducing today’s reliance on imports. Overall clean energy 
investment trends are broadly aligned with the EU’s energy and 
climate goals.

Achieving Africa’s energy- and climate-related goals by 2030 will 
require annual investments of over USD 200 billion through the end 
of this decade. This will be vital to meet the growing energy needs of 
a continent where the median age of the population is 20 years and 
average GDP per capita is just over one-fourth of the global average.  
Our 
tracking 
of 
energy 
spending 
suggests 
that 
around 
USD 110 billion is set to be invested in energy across Africa in 2024, 
of which nearly USD 70 billion to fossil fuel supply and power, with 
the remainder going to a range of clean energy technologies. 
Spending trends vary widely across Africa, but neither the total 
amount nor the proportion spent on clean energy are enough to put 
the continent on track to reach its sustainable development goals. As 
they stand, energy investments are equivalent to only 1.2% of the 
region’s GDP and clean energy investments, while rising, account for 
just 2% of the global total.  
Debt repayments, which have increased sharply in recent years, 
mean that many African governments have difficulty accessing the 
funds required for capital-intensive clean energy projects. Moreover, 
low sovereign debt ratings further limit access to outside investment 
– in 2023, only two countries, Botswana and Mauritius, held 
investment-grade ratings. 
Of the clean energy investments that have recently been made, the 
majority are in renewable power generation. While these projects are 
vital to meet Africa’s rising electricity needs in a sustainable way, the 
prospects for further growth will be limited as long as the grid itself is 
not upgraded and expanded. With average line losses of 15%, 
inefficient grids and insufficient interconnections are already creating 
bottlenecks for new renewable energy projects in the region. 
Energy access is among the top priorities in Africa, where 600 million 
people live without electricity and roughly 1 billion people lack access 
to clean cooking. Financing needs for energy access initiatives fall 
well short of the annual USD 25 billion that is required to achieve the 
2030 objectives of full access to modern energy. Progress in this area 
will require concessional finance providers to mobilise grants for the 
most vulnerable households and support the creation of bankable 
projects. The provision of other de-risking capital will also be critical 
to allow the private sector to take a more active role.  
A high cost of capital is a major impediment to scaling up clean 
energy investments in Africa. Reducing country-wide and project-
specific risks will require a major effort from national policymakers, 
based on clear strategies and ambitious NDCs, alongside 
significantly more international financial and technical support.

Clean energy investment in the Middle East is rising, but it remains dominated by the region’s 
traditional role as a supplier of oil and gas 
The Middle East is home to five of the world’s top oil producers: Saudi 
Arabia, Iraq, the United Arab Emirates (UAE), Iran, and Kuwait. 
Moreover, it plays a significant role as a producer of natural gas, with 
three of the world’s top ten producers being Iran, Qatar, and the UAE. 
For the moment, spending on fossil fuel supply predominates: for 
every 1 USD invested in fossil fuels, only 20 cents are allocated to 
clean energy investment, which represents approximately one-tenth 
of the average global ratio of clean energy to fossil fuel investment. 
There are wide disparities in per capita income and energy 
consumption levels across the region. For example, countries like 
Saudi Arabia, the UAE and Kuwait are situated at the higher end of 
income and energy consumption, while Yemen and Syria are 
positioned at the lower end. Sovereign credit ratings also vary 
significantly. Saudi Arabia, Kuwait, Qatar, and the UAE hold high 
ratings, while Jordan, Oman, and Bahrain fall into the medium-grade 
category. Conversely, Iraq and Lebanon have very low ratings.  
Energy investment in the Middle East is expected to reach 
approximately USD 175 billion in 2024, with clean energy accounting 
for around 15% of the total investment. In the APS by 2030, clean 
energy investment more than triples compared with 2024. As a result, 
by the end of the decade, every 1 USD invested in fossil fuels in this 
scenario would be matched by 70 cents going to clean energy.  
Five of the twelve countries in the region have set net zero emission 
targets. The UAE and Oman have set targets to achieve net zero 
emissions by 2050, while Saudi Arabia, Bahrain, and Kuwait have 
announced a target for 2060. Additionally, the UAE has committed to 
reducing emissions by 19% by 2030 from 2019 levels, and it also 
pledged USD 30 billion in catalytic capital to launch a climate-focused 
investment initiative at COP28. 
The region’s power sector holds a distinct opportunity for increasing 
investment in clean energy technologies, notably for solar PV.  
Harnessing these resources could substantially decrease reliance on 
both oil and gas in the power sector. Saudi Arabia, for example, is 
targeting 130 GW of renewable capacity by 2030, up from less than 
5 GW today. Projects including the large Al Shuaibah solar plant in 
Saudi Arabia and the Mohammed bin Rashid Al Maktoum solar park 
in UAE are underway. Various countries have also announced blue 
and green hydrogen investments, as well as intensifying investments 
in critical minerals. Saudi Arabia, for instance, has established a 
USD 182 million mineral exploration incentive program. Similarly, the 
UAE is expanding its efforts to establish a presence in the sector, 
including through a USD 1.9 billion mining partnership in the 
Democratic Republic of the Congo and securing new agreements in 
copper-rich Zambia.

China is a clean energy powerhouse, although energy security concerns continue to fuel 
approvals of new coal-fired power plants 
China accounted for 19% of global GDP in 2023 and its annual 
economic growth rate of 5.2% narrowly exceeded the government’s 
annual target. Despite initial signs that the recovery would be swift, 
China’s economy continues to face some challenges, notably with a 
troubled property market. Yields on Chinese sovereign bonds have 
been declining steadily since 2021 and reached a record low in March 
2024.The People’s Bank of China, as well as other state-owned 
commercial banks, have continued to lower their interest rates, in 
contrast to the upward trend in most other major economies. 
Chinese investments in energy remained extremely strong, 
accounting for one-third of clean energy investments worldwide and 
an important share of China’s overall GDP growth. China has 
announced dual carbon goals – to peak carbon emissions before 
2030 and achieve carbon neutrality before 2060 – and has shown 
remarkable progress in adding renewable capacity. In 2023, China 
commissioned as much solar PV as the entire world did in 2022 while 
its wind additions also grew by 66% year-on-year. Over the past five 
years, China also added 11 GW of nuclear power, by far the largest 
of any country in the world. 
The year 2023 saw robust growth for the so-called “new three” (xin-
sanyang) industries – solar cells, lithium batteries and electric 
vehicles (EV) – which saw a 30%  jump  in exports in 2023 from a 
year earlier, making them a major factor  in Chinese trade. These 
trends are expected to continue into 2024, with the largest portion of 
China’s investments heading towards low-emission power. 
Ample domestic manufacturing capacity and continued government 
support for clean technologies provides a foundation for strong clean 
energy investment within China. However, pressures are increasing 
on China’s ability to export these technologies to other large 
international markets, including Europe and the United States. 
Another issue that requires close attention is China’s continued 
investment in fossil fuels, especially coal with nearly all the new global 
coal-fired capacity. In tandem with its growing renewable capacity, 
coal still remains the most prominent fuel source in China’s energy 
mix, with coal production reaching a record high in 2023.  While China 
aims to ensure that coal and coal-fired power will play a supporting 
role in its energy system, these developments reflect a strong 
emphasis on energy security in China's energy strategy. 
Overall energy investment levels in China are comparable to the 
amounts required to meet national energy and climate goals, 
although full alignment with the targets implies a rebalancing away 
from investments in fossil fuel supply, towards grids and the end-use 
sectors.

India’s clean energy investments have grown fast in the past three years in response to 
ambitious clean energy targets   
With a GDP growth rate of 7.8%, India was the world’s fastest 
growing major economy in 2023. Its economy is now the world’s fifth 
largest, and is on track to become the third largest by 2030 behind 
the United States and China. However, per capita income is less than 
half of the world average, and India’s development priorities remain 
focused on poverty alleviation, job growth and infrastructure creation.  
As a result of its GDP growth potential, urbanisation, growth in built 
spaces, and the increased demand for electricity as well as materials 
such as cement and steel, energy demand growth in India is on track 
to outpace all other regions of the world by 2050. This could put 
strains on its energy system, which for the moment relies heavily on 
imported fossil fuels, especially crude oil and natural gas. In tandem 
with this sharp rise in energy demand, carbon emissions in India 
could increase significantly over this period due to a growth in fossil 
fuel use for transport, power generation and industry.  
To address these challenges, India has been pursuing a range of 
decarbonisation and diversification strategies. Most notably, India 
has a set a target for reaching net zero emissions by 2070. In recent 
years, India has scaled up solar and wind power investments and 
also announced measures to promote domestic clean energy supply 
chains. In 2020, India announced the Production Linked Incentives 
scheme to set up domestic manufacturing of solar modules, batteries 
and other clean energy equipment. India also has a long-standing 
energy efficiency programme in place, as well as a new hydrogen 
policy that envisions domestic manufacturing of electrolysers and the 
production of low-carbon hydrogen.  
India made its debut in the sovereign green bond market in January 
2023. Two tranches of bonds valued at USD 1 billion (INR 80 billion) 
were marketed primarily to local investors. The issue of bonds – 
whose proceeds were destined to support renewables, metro rail 
lines, and low-carbon hydrogen production – was more than four 
times oversubscribed.    
Such initiatives have led to a surge in Indian clean energy investment 
in recent years. Spending reached USD 68 billion in 2023, up by 
nearly 40% from the 2016-2020 average. Almost half of this was 
devoted to low-emissions power generation, which includes solar PV. 
Fossil fuel investment grew by 6% over the same period to reach 
USD 33 billion in 2023, in response to rising demand for fuel and 
coal-fired power generation. Clean energy investment is on track to 
double by 2030 under today’s policy settings, but would need to rise 
by a further 20% to get fully on track for the country’s energy and 
climate goals. Addressing risks that push up the cost of capital will be 
critical in this endeavour.

Japan and Korea have made important steps to expand clean energy investments 
Japan and Korea are two of the most developed economies in the 
Asian region, accounting for 5% of global GDP, with a per capita GDP 
of approximately 2.5 times the global average. Energy investment 
represents 1.5% of GDP, and clean energy investment per dollar of 
fossil fuel investment is 9.8 – over five times the global average. This 
reflects recent growth in clean energy investment as well as the fact 
that both Japan and Korea import almost all of their fossil fuels. From 
2021 to 2023, average annual clean energy investment in Japan and 
Korea increased by around 40% and 10%, respectively, compared 
with the 2016-2020 average. Both countries have announced targets 
to reach carbon neutrality in 2050 and in our Announced Pledges 
Scenario (APS), the countries increase their clean energy investment 
by a further 27% by the end of the decade to align with these goals. 
This expands investment in low-emission power sources, as well as 
in the decarbonisation of heavy industry and transport.  
Both countries are pursuing policies to promote investments in 
energy transitions. Japan has clarified investment policies and 
industry-specific roadmaps for its energy transition under the Basic 
Policy for the Realization of GX. Multiple plans (such as the Basic 
Hydrogen Strategy and the CCS Long Term Roadmap) have been 
developed to support innovation and increase investment in the 
deployment of a range of decarbonisation technologies. Japan is 
introducing carbon pricing and setting incentives for companies to 
accelerate investments in decarbonisation by announcing plans to 
increase carbon prices in the future.   
Korea’s drive for energy security and its transition to clean energy 
sources have spurred substantial investments in recent years. With 
its first National Basic Plan for Carbon Neutrality and Green Growth 
announced in 2023 (in line with its pledge to achieve carbon neutrality 
by 2050) Korea plans to significantly increase power generation from 
renewable energy sources as well as nuclear power, develop core 
green technologies and nurture new green industries through policy 
and private financing support, alongside improvements to relevant 
systems. Commitments to boost carbon neutrality policies are backed 
by enhanced financial support, such as climate response funds to 
mobilise private investment. Korea also aims to refine its emission 
trading systems (ETS) and introduce emissions permit trading. 
International export and co-operation are also seen as key pillars of 
Korea’s plan to help finance the energy transition, targeting the 
industrialisation of nuclear exports, as well as the EV, renewable 
energy, hydrogen and CCUS industries. Additionally, Korea has 
pledged to raise the amount of its development assistance devoted 
to climate and global energy transitions to OECD average levels by 
2025.

Most countries in Southeast Asia now have ambitious long-term clean energy goals, but 
investments are not yet on track
Southeast Asia accounts for 9% of the world's population, 6% of the 
world’s GDP and 4% of world energy consumption. The region’s 
population is expected to grow to nearly 800 million by 2050; together 
with continued economic growth this will have strong implications for 
energy demand. Investment will determine how this rising demand is 
met, with implications for security, affordability and alignment with 
sustainability goals. Eight out of 10 countries in the region have 
announced target dates of carbon neutrality: Singapore, Malaysia 
and four others in 2050; Indonesia in 2060; and Thailand in 2065. 
For the moment, there are significant gaps between investment 
trends and the region’s long-term goals. Southeast Asia’s spending 
on clean energy represents only about 2% of the global total. Annual 
average energy investment over the last three years was 
USD 72 billion, but would need to increase to over USD 130 billion to 
align with the APS by the end of the decade. There would also need 
to be a shift in the allocation of investment towards cleaner 
technologies: clean power would be the largest share of investment 
– nearly 40%.  
Some countries are signalling a shift in priorities. Viet Nam, for 
instance, approved its 8th Power Development Plan in 2024, which 
seeks to reshape its energy system, including extensive development 
of renewable technologies as well as the use of low-emissions 
hydrogen and ammonia and a reduction in reliance on unabated coal. 
However, the implementation plan is not yet fully clear and over 
10 GW of new coal-fired capacity remains in the pipeline.  
Updated 
expansion 
plans 
for 
low-emissions 
power 
and 
infrastructure, and changes in power purchasing agreements, are an 
important signal to investors. However, uncertainties remain in many 
countries over remuneration mechanisms for renewable output, 
which continue to affect risk perceptions and the cost of capital.  
International development finance and support is crucial to Southeast 
Asia’s energy transitions. The Just Energy Transition Partnerships 
(JETPs) launched in 2021 in Indonesia and Viet Nam provide a 
framework to mobilise capital for investments in clean energy and 
support the phasing out of coal-fired power generation. The release 
of the Indonesia Comprehensive Investment and Policy Plan in 
November 2023 was an important milestone for the JETP and is 
expected to mobilise USD 97 billion in power sector investments in 
Indonesia. The Asia Zero Emission Community initiative by Japan 
provides financial support of up to USD 8 billion to 2030 for energy 
projects in participating countries: Indonesia, Philippines, Thailand 
and Viet Nam. The ASEAN Taxonomy and ASEAN Transition 
Finance Guidance provide a valuable framework for the financial 
industry to improve credibility and transparency to capital providers.

Regional deep dive 
Eurasia navigates a complex energy landscape, characterised by heavy reliance on fossil fuels, 
and an urgent need to ramp up investments in clean energy
Eurasia is a heterogeneous region in energy terms, containing major 
fossil fuel producers and exporters, as well as countries like Georgia, 
Tajikistan, and Kyrgyzstan that obtain around 85% of their electricity 
from hydro sources. The overall share of natural gas in the energy 
mix is one of the highest in the world, but gas infrastructure is ageing 
and often poorly maintained. 
The region has been hit hard by energy instability in recent years. 
Ukraine’s energy infrastructure has been targeted by Russian forces 
following the 2022 invasion. High prices have had widespread 
impacts on energy-importing countries and traditional energy 
relationships between countries have been shaken.  
Levels of energy investment in Eurasia have stalled in recent years 
at around USD 110 and USD 120 billion per year, with around 80% 
of this going to fossil fuels. At around USD 20 billion, annual clean 
energy spending in the region is far below its potential, the result of 
significant obstacles that include pervasive fossil fuel subsidies and 
policy frameworks that are generally weak and unclear. 
The global energy crisis has prompted rising interest in the potential 
for clean energy. Azerbaijan’s hosting of the COP29 summit in 2024 
presents an opportunity to give new momentum to energy transitions 
through efforts to scale up clean power and to reduce emissions from 
fossil fuels. Five countries in the region have set net zero targets: 
Armenia ,Georgia and the Kyrgyz Republic aim to achieve net zero 
emissions by 2050. Russia and Kazakhstan have set a target of 2060. 
Except for Russia, all countries in the region have signed the Global 
Methane Pledge.  
Getting on track to achieve these commitments requires a steady 
increase in energy investment. In the APS, energy investment is 
projected to reach around USD 145 billion by 2030, with the share of 
clean energy investment reaching more than one third. 
The oil and gas investment picture is subject to a high degree of 
uncertainty. Russia is looking to compensate for the loss of European 
markets by seeking out new markets in China and South Asia. This 
has largely succeeded for oil but putting in place new export 
infrastructure for gas has proved to be much more difficult. Russia 
has stepped up its bilateral agreements with Eurasian countries, 
however, including plans for fossil fuel and nuclear plant projects. In 
2023, Russia signed an agreement with Kyrgyzstan for the 
construction of a new coal-fired plant (660 MW). As part of its push 
to open up new markets, Russia has also been seeking oil and gas 
supply and transit arrangements with Central Asia.
