# Question

Which of the following statements is incorrect?

# Choices

- A: This article inserts a module into the pre-trained diffusion model, and then trains the parameters of these models to adapt this module to the task and the priori of the diffusion model.
- B: TPB includes two MLP layers with Layer Normalization and LeakyReLU, ensuring that only the most task-specific attributes are retained
- C: Task-specific priors containing guidance information for the task can adequately guide pre-trained diffusion models to handle low-level tasks while maintaining high-fidelity content consistency.
- D: The spatial feature Fs extracted by SCB processing is calculated from SCB, Ft, Fp, F and has no relationship with TPB.

# Answer

D
