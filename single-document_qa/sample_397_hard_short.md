# Question

Please analyze the authors' experimental results regarding the GRABACh3.0 sensor and identify which of the following statements best reflects its importance in measuring neuromodulator concentrations?

# Choices

- A: The fluorescence lifetime of the GRABACh3.0 sensor shows no significant variation under different excitation light powers, indicating that it is not affected by laser fluctuations in practical applications.
- B: The fluorescence intensity and lifetime of the GRABACh3.0 sensor in cells are sensitive to changes in acetylcholine (ACh) concentrations, demonstrating its high sensitivity.
- C: The changes in fluorescence lifetime of the GRABACh3.0 sensor are closely related to the relative changes in cellular autofluorescence, leading to unreliable measurement results.
- D: The dynamic range of the GRABACh3.0 sensor is comparable to that of other FRET sensors, suggesting limited potential in studying neuromodulator dynamics.

# Answer

A
