# Question

Which policy mix should the government pursue to best balance fiscal sustainability, private sector engagement, and the energy transition, while maintaining political and social stability?

# Choices

- A: Aggressive Fiscal Realignment with Carbon Tax and Green Bond Program：
Introduce a substantial carbon tax on oil production and exports, increasing gradually over the next decade.
Launch a large-scale green bond program to fund solar and wind infrastructure, primarily targeting international investors.
Gradually phase out fossil fuel subsidies over the next five years, redirecting savings toward green infrastructure projects.
Implement social transfer programs to cushion the impact on low-income households as energy prices rise.
- B: Gradual Energy Transition with National Green Investment Bank：
Create a national green investment bank to de-risk renewable energy projects, using concessional financing from multilateral development banks (MDBs) and sovereign wealth fund reserves.
Maintain existing fossil fuel subsidies for the next five years to ensure energy price stability while gradually scaling up renewable energy.
Implement modest tax credits and subsidies for private renewable energy investments, while postponing the introduction of a carbon tax.
Prioritize regulatory streamlining to reduce barriers for private sector participation in renewable energy projects.
- C: Immediate Fossil Fuel Subsidy Removal with Regulatory Overhaul：
Remove all fossil fuel subsidies immediately to create a level playing field for renewable energy, and redirect savings to fund public investments in renewable energy infrastructure.
Implement a comprehensive regulatory overhaul, fast-tracking the approval process for renewable energy projects, and introducing mandatory renewable energy purchase agreements (PPAs) for utilities.
Introduce a carbon pricing mechanism within two years, focused on industrial sectors to reduce emissions.
Provide direct cash transfers to low-income households to offset rising energy costs due to subsidy removal.
- D: Blended Finance and Export-Led Renewable Development：
Establish a public-private blended finance fund to attract foreign direct investment (FDI) for large-scale renewable energy projects, especially focused on export markets (e.g., green hydrogen, solar exports).
Issue sustainability-linked bonds (SLBs) that tie coupon payments to national greenhouse gas reduction targets, tapping into international capital markets.
Implement a modest carbon tax on oil production, while retaining fossil fuel subsidies domestically to avoid sharp increases in local energy prices.
Use revenues from carbon taxes and SLBs to invest in education, retraining programs, and social welfare for workers in the fossil fuel sector who will be displaced by the energy transition.
