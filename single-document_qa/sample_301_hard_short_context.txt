Into The Top Ten 
We like C&D's top-tier earnings growth outlook, strong land 
acquisition capability, high operational efficiency, and solid 
balance sheet. We initiate at Overweight.
Top-tier core earnings growth: We expect C&D to  
achieve a 10% core earnings 
CAGR in 2023-26E, outperforming other leading developers in our coverage, thanks 
to: 1) steady revenue growth, 2) gross margin recovery, and 3) less impairment 
pressure. We forecast C&D will deliver an attractive >9% dividend yield in 2024-26E, 
assuming a stable payout ratio of 50%. The company became a top ten property 
developer in China in terms of contracted sales in 2023. 
Stronger-than-peer land acquisition pace with a clear focus on high-tier cities: 
C&D executed an aggressive land acquisition strategy in 2019-23, acquiring saleable 
resources at 1.4x contracted sales on average and resulting in sales growth that 
continues to outperform peers. Recently, it  
has become more focused on investing 
in high-tier cities, with >85% of land premium invested in Tier 1 and Tier 2 cities in 
2022-23 (vs. ~70% in 2019-21). This should allow it  
to achieve above-peer sales 
growth during market downturns, since these cities have stronger fundamentals 
than low-tier cities.  
High operational efficiency with low exposure to old projects: C&D has also been 
focusing on improving its operational efficiency; it achieved a 70% turnover rate on 
average in 2021-23. As of 2023 only ~22% of C&D's landbank was acquired in 2021, 
while ~8% was acquired before 2020. We believe this high proportion of new 
landbank will help C&D achieve a better sell-through rate and above-peer sales 
growth amid the weak  
property market.
SOE background with solid balance sheet and strong support from holding 
company: C&D has managed to balance scaling up and leverage in recent years. As 
of 2023, it has a solid balance sheet with: 1) net gearing of 33.6%, and 2) a cash-to-
short-term debt ratio of 4.75x. More importantly,  
>60% of C&D's  
interest-bearing 
debt is owed to its  
parent company (C&D Real Estate). As a result,  
C&D has been 
able to continuously improve its borrowing costs.
Valuation: Our price target of HK$17.90 implies 6.2x 2025 P/E. On our estimates 
C&D is trading at ~4.5x 2025 P/E, which we think is undervalued vs other leading H-
share developers such as CR Land (5.2x) and COLI (5.6x), considering its strong core 
earnings growth outlook and sufficient cash. More importantly, we find C&D's 
valuation attractive with a dividend yield of >9% in 2024-26E, assuming a stable 
payout ratio of 50%. Key risks: 1) declining property prices; 2) negative policy 
changes;  
3) weaker contracted sales; 4) deeper margin compression; and 5) a slower 
pace of land acquisitions.

20% discount to base case 2024e NAV
Meaningful credit and policy relaxation
drives property prices higher: Meaningful
relaxations to credit (e.g., quotas/ interest
rates for mortgages and development loans)
and property policies (e.g., HPR,
downpayment requirements, property price
caps, presales permit approvals) drive up
property demand (especially upgrade and
investment demand) and asset prices. 
HK$17.90
45% discount to base case 2024e NAV
Adequate credit and policy easing leads to a
normalized property market: The central
government aims to build a stable property
market to support GDP growth but avoid a
further property price rally. Recently, some
local governments relaxed HPR,
downpayment ratios and mortgage rates.
Our base case factors in -5%/-5%/-5% y-y
property prices growth from end-2023
levels in Tier 1, 2, and lower-tier cities.
HK$9.80
70% discount to base case 2024e NAV
Limited credit and policy easing, potentially
triggering further defaults of developers:
With the property market already cooling,
insufficient credit and policy easing worsens
the liquidity situation for developers, forcing
them to cut prices significantly, which then
leads to unfavorable sentiment that freezes
transactions.

HK$17.90, implying 36% upside potential. We like C&D for its: 
1. 10% core earnings CAGR in 2023-26E and >9% dividend yield: Backed by strong 
contracted sales growth during 2018-23 (50% CAGR) and unbooked sales 
(consolidated) of Rmb208.7bn by end-2023, we estimate C&D to realize 
5%/3%/2% y-y revenue growth in 2024-26E, respectively. Also, we believe C&D's 
gross margin will stabilize in 2025 (10.8%/11.6%/11.8% in 2024-26E, respectively), 
given less drag from the  
revenue booking of lower-margin projects acquired in 
2020-21 and more contribution from higher-margin projects acquired since 2022. 
Combined with cost savings and fewer impairments than in 2023, we estimate 
C&D to achieve 8%/14%/10% core earnings growth in 2024-26E, respectively, 
outperforming other leading developers in our coverage. Meanwhile, our core 
earnings estimates imply >9% dividend yield in 2024-26E, assuming a stable 
payout ratio of 50%.
2. Strong progress on land acquisitions  
with a stable attributable ratio and focus 
on high-tier cities: C&D executed an aggressive land acquisition strategy in 2019-
23, acquiring saleable resources at 1.4x contracted sales on average. It continued 
to acquire resources at 0.9x/1.2x contracted sales even during the market 
downturn in 2022/23,  
significantly outperforming peers. C&D also has a balanced 
attributable ratio in land acquisitions, with a 75% attributable ratio on average  
in 
2019-23, helping it to have better control on projects. Recently, it has focused 
more on investing in high-tier cities, with >85% of land premium invested in Tier 1 
and Tier 2 cities in 2022-23 (vs. ~70% in 2019-21). These cities have stronger 
fundamentals than low-tier cities and should allow C&D to achieve an above-peer 
sales performance even in market downturns.  
3. High operational efficiency with low exposure to old projects:  
C&D has also 
been focusing on improving its operational efficiency; it achieved a 70% turnover 
rate on average in 2021-23. Benefiting from this, at end-2023 only ~22% of C&D's 
landbank was acquired in 2021, while ~8% was acquired before 2020. We believe 
this high proportion of new landbank will help C&D to achieve a better sell-
through rate and above-peer sales growth  
amid the weak  
property market.
4. SOE background with solid balance sheet and support from parent  
company: 
Despite its aggressive expansion in recent years, C&D has maintained control of its 
leverage. As of 2023, C&D has a strong balance sheet with 1) net gearing of 33.6%, 
2) a cash-to-short-term debt ratio of 4.75x, and 3) a liabilities-to-assets ratio 
(excluding presale deposits) of 58.5%. Meanwhile, C&D's parent  
company (C&D 
Real Estate) continues to support C&D's funding. As of 2023, C&D has total debt 
of Rmb97bn, of which  
>60% has been borrowed from its parentco (Rmb48bn 
loans and Rmb12bn perpetual bonds).  
C&D also continues to improve its 
borrowing costs; costs were at 3.75% in 2023, down from 4.33% in 2022. 
5. Highly incentivized management and employees: C&D issued shares to Diamond 
Firetail Limited (C&D management team's shareholding platform) in 2015 and 
2017, representing 1.76% of outstanding shares. It  
also introduced a share-related 
incentive scheme in 2021-23, which covers a relatively wide range of employees

and related parties. As of 2023, the  
168.6mn shares in the scheme are equivalent 
to 8.9% of outstanding shares. These schemes have helped to align the interest of 
C&D's management with its shareholders.
We believe the stock's valuation looks attractive with a dividend yield of >9% in 2024-26E, 
assuming a stable dividend payout ratio of 50%. C&D ranks near the top of our order of 
preference among our China property developers coverage.
Morgan Stanley estimates vs. Consensus
Below we outline where we differ from consensus:
1. Revenue: Given our conservative view on the property sales and ASP outlook, our 
revenue forecasts are slightly lower than consensus. We forecast Rmb140.8bn/
Rmb145.1bn/Rmb147.5bn for 2024-2026E,  
1.0%/1.1%/5.2% lower than consensus.  
2. Gross margin: We believe in the short term, C&D's gross margin could still be 
dragged down by the revenue booking of low margin projects, but we expect it to  
stabilize and then recover from 2025. Thus, our gross margin estimates are 
10.8%/11.6%/11.8% for 2024-2026E. We are 0.6pt/0.1pt lower than consensus in 
2024-2025E but slightly higher  
in 2026E. 
3. Core profit: Though in general our revenue  
and gross margin estimates are lower 
than consensus, we expect C&D to maintain good cost control and suffer less than 
peers from impairment losses in the next few years. Thus, we estimate C&D to 
achieve Rmb4.7bn/Rmb5.3bn/Rmb5.8bn core earnings in 2024-2026E, which is 
2.6% lower than consensus in 2024E but 2.9%/6.3% higher in 2025-2026E.

Investment concerns and risks to our view
Our key investment concerns include: 
1.  
relatively thin landbank (only ~ 1.4x landbank years, less  
than most other leading 
developers), which requires C&D to keep proactively acquiring land in order to 
deliver sales growth; 
2. remaining saleable resources acquired in 2021 might still be hard to sell and drag 
down turnover; 
3. financial support from C&D's parent company might harm C&D's earnings in the 
long term owing to higher borrowing costs; and 
4. historically, C&D has announced placements due to relatively thin equity.

Key downside risks to our Overweight thesis include: 
1.  
poor sales and declining property prices should China's macro challenges persist; 
2. policy changes that negatively affect the industry; 
3. weaker-than-expected contracted sales, which would weigh on medium-term 
revenue growth; 
4. deeper-than-expected gross margin compression, which would undermine  
core 
earnings; 
5. slower-than-expected land acquisitions, which would weigh on medium-term 
contract sales growth.

Investment Positives
1. Aggressive landbanking and high operational efficiency to 
support strong sales growth and keep its status as a top 10 
developer
1.1 Stronger-than-peer land acquisitions in the past few years with a 
balanced attributable ratio
At the early stage, C&D's business development was highly reliant on its parent company. 
Most projects were injected by its parent company; in 2017 and 2018, its parent company 
injected 7 and 13 projects, respectively, into C&D (accounting for 47% and 39% of the land 
parcels acquired in those years). However, since 2019, C&D has become more market-
oriented and most of its land parcels were acquired from the public market.
In 2019-23, C&D acquired saleable resources at 1.4x contracted sales on average. It 
continued to acquire land even during the market downturn in 2022/23, acquiring saleable 
resources at 0.9x and 1.2x contracted sales, respectively. It recorded one of the strongest 
land-acquisition to land-investment ratios among our major developers coverage with a 
total land premium / contracted sales of  
49% and 62% in 2022 and 2023 (vs. 25% and 
23% on average) ( Exhibit 14 ), respectively. In 1H24, C&D continued to actively acquire 
land and acquired 18 land parcels with Rmb42.0bn land premium, and we estimate it 
acquired Rmb74.2bn  
in saleable resources (or 1.1x its 1H24 contracted sales). More 
importantly, >95% of its saleable resources are located in Tier 1 and Tier 2 cities (e.g., 
Shanghai, Hangzhou, Chengdu, Xiamen), where it is easier to achieve a better sell-through 
rate amid a weak property market (as opposed to lower-tier cities).
C&D has also kept a balanced attributable ratio in acquiring new land parcels. In 1H24, it 
acquired new saleable resources with a  
78% attributable ratio (vs. a 75% attributable ratio 
on average in 2019-23). At the same time, in 2020-1H24 on average 89% of  
projects 
acquired were consolidated by C&D, and on average 99% of projects acquired were 
operated by C&D. These factors have  
helped the company to better control and manage 
its projects at the operational level.

1.2 Clear metropolitan focus with increasing investments in high-tier 
cities
Along with its aggressive land acquisition strategy, C&D has also focused more on 
investing in high-tier cities. In 2019-21, the company began to focus on high-tier cities, with 
~70% of total land premium invested in Tier 1 and Tier 2 cities. In 2022-23, it increased its 
focus, with over 85% of its total land premium invested in Tier 1 and Tier 2 cities. More 
importantly, C&D has heavily invested in core high-tier cities. In 2023, over 60% of its

12
total land investments were in Top 5 cities, including Hangzhou (Tier 2, 20.3%), Shanghai 
(Tier 1, 14.7%), Xiamen (Tier 2, 12.5%), Suzhou (Tier 2, 6.6%) and Beijing (Tier 1, 6.0%). The 
company has built its presence in these cities, where housing demand has been more 
robust in recent years. This has allowed it to deliver resilient sales performance amid weak 
market sentiment.
As of 2023, C&D owns Rmb266.8bn in saleable resources and 15.5mn sqm in saleable GFA 
from >300 projects in 59 cities. It has three regional companies (Eastern China Cluster, 
Haixi Cluster and Southeast Cluster) and has a clear metropolitan focus, with most of its 
saleable resources located in southeast China. By regional company, Eastern China Cluster, 
Haixi Cluster and Southeast Cluster own 42.4%, 37.1% and 20.5% of C&D's saleable 
resources ( Exhibit 24 ). 
Benefiting from its aggressive land acquisition strategy, most of C&D's saleable resources 
are in high-tier core cities. As of 2023, >65% of C&D's saleable resources are located in 
Tier 1 and Tier 2 cities (Tier 1 16.0% / Tier 2 50.8%). By city, over 30% of C&D's landbank 
(in terms of saleable resources value) is  
in the Top  
5 cities, including Shanghai (10.0%), 
Xiamen (7.8%), Hangzhou (5.7%), Suzhou (5.3%) and Beijing (5.0%). We also note that 
C&D's  
average selling price has risen from Rmb17-19k in 2019-21 to ~Rmb21.0k in 2022-23,

1.3 Good product quality and differentiated product type to support 
asset turnover
C&D has constantly been upgrading its product designs to differentiate its product series 
from peers and cater to its buyers' changing preference. As of 2023, C&D has five  
product 
series that incorporate traditional Chinese culture and architecture to suit the prevailing 
homebuyers' demand.  
Meanwhile, it is also focusing on improving its operational efficiency 
(such as better sell-through rate, more efficient new launch, etc.) through a dedicated 
management and information system. 
These moves have helped C&D to 1) achieve a high sell-through rate  
of 68% in 2023, up 
from 62% in 2022, and 2) realize  
high asset turnover. In 2023, 34% of newly acquired 
resources  
were launched that same year, contributing Rmb51.4bn (or 27%) of contracted 
sales. C&D also realized a high turnover rate of 76%. 
Moreover, benefiting from its high operating efficiency, C&D has only a few old projects in 
its landbank for sale. As of 2023, 70% of its saleable resources were acquired in 2022-23, 
22% were acquired in 2021 and only 8% were acquired before 2021. Its high operating 
efficiency is also reflected in the overall sell-through rate of its saleable resources, with 
77% and 84% of resources acquired in 2021 and 2022, respectively, sold as of 2023. So, 
C&D is under less pressure than peers to sell  
old landbank  
projects amid the weak 
property market. Newly acquired landbanks are more likely to achieve  
a better sell-

through rate and better contribute to C&D's sales performance, considering those 
relatively old landbanks (especially those acquired in 2020-21 before the market 
downturn) might have relatively high land costs or be  
in less favorable locations.

1.4 Aggressive sales growth, delivering 50%  
CAGR in 2018-23, led to  
top 
10 developer status in China
Benefiting from its strong land acquisitions and high operational efficiency, C&D  
realized 
strong contracted sales growth during 2018-23, expanding at a CAGR of 50%. Its 
contracted sales reached Rmb188.9bn in 2023 (vs. Rmb24.8bn in 2018). At the same time, 
it has maintained a good balance between scale and stake in projects, with >70% 
attributable ratio in the past years. As a result, it realized a strong attributable sales CAGR 
of 51% in 2018-23 and its attributable sales reached Rmb138bn in 2023 (vs. Rmb17.4bn in 
2018).  
C&D's  
sales growth strongly outperformed peers in the past cycle. Even during 2022-23 
when the overall industry witnessed a significant decline in contracted sales, it recorded 
3%/12% yoy contracted sales growth, the best in our coverage (-23%/-9% sales median) 
and much better than the top 30 developers (-41%/-15% sales on average). This made it  
a 
top 10 developer in the country in 2023 (#8, vs. #10 in 2022 and #21 in 2021).
In 1H2024, C&D's contracted sales declined 30% y-y to Rmb50.9bn (-32% y-y on an 
attributable basis), but still outperformed peers (-39% y-y for top-30 developers). 
Considering it continued its aggressive land acquisition strategy in high-tier cities in 2023 
and 1H24, which should provide large high-quality saleable resources in the following 
months, we expect it to achieve above-peer sales performance with high visibility into 
2H24. We estimate C&D to achieve  
full-year sales of Rmb159.9bn (-15% y-y).

2. Strong earnings CAGR in 2023-26E, backed  
by sufficient 
unbooked resources and better margin outlook 
2.1 Strong sales growth in the past cycle has led to C&D's large 
unbooked resources so it can realize a steady revenue growth
Benefiting from strong sales growth, C&D has accumulated sufficient unbooked resources 
to support its revenue growth in next few years. C&D's presales deposit witnessed rapid 
growth in the past 5 years (at a CAGR of 71%), which has risen to Rmb191bn (+7% y-y) as 
of 2023. Accordingly, C&D's unbooked resources (consolidated, including VAT) have 
increased to Rmb209bn (+6% y-y), or 1.5x its 2023 development property business 
revenue. Combined with its stronger-than-peers sales outlook, we estimate C&D to realize 
5%/3%/2% y-y revenue growth in 2024-26E, respectively.

2.2 Margin should stabilize in 2025, benefiting from the booking of 
higher margin projects and less asset impairments
China's land market was extremely strong during 2020-1H21, with the average land 
premium witnessing a spike. Since 2H21, however, the physical market has quickly cooled 
down and most private-owned enterprise (POE) developers faced liquidity pressure. As a 
result, fewer companies have acquired land and so the land premium has stayed relatively 
low. Thus, from a developer's perspective, most of the land acquired during 2020-1H21 
might achieve low or negative margins, while land acquired after 2H21 might achieve 
better margins.
C&D has seen a similar margin trend for land acquisitions. In 2020-21, it recorded land 
prices of Rmb8,835/sqm and Rmb8,756/sqm, respectively, while the gap between 
estimated average selling price was only Rmb8,605/sqm and Rmb8,069/sqm. In contrast, 
in 2022-23, although C&D's land price increased to ~Rmb14,000/sqm (mainly due to

20
having a higher concentration on high-tier cities), the gap between estimated average 
selling price also jumped to over Rmb11,500/sqm, which provided a bigger buffer for profit 
given construction costs are relatively fixed.
At the same time, C&D's high operational efficiency and relatively short construction time 
span (~2.5 years from land acquisition to completion vs. the industry average of >3 years) 
should lead to quicker revenue booking. For example, the land acquired in 2020 and 2021 
contributed 44% and 50% to 2023 DP revenue, respectively, while the land acquired in 
2019 and 2020 contributed 39% and 55% to 2022 DP revenue, respectively.
We expect C&D's gross margin to stabilize and recover in 2025, despite some downward 
pressure in 2024 that we think is mainly due to 1) most of the drag from booking low-
margin projects (mainly acquired in 2020-21) will be digested this year and become much 
smaller from 2025 (only ~30% of unbooked sales by end-2023 were acquired before 
2022); and 2) high-margin projects acquired since 2022 will become major contributors of 
revenue, partly benefiting from C&D's quick revenue booking. We estimate gross margins 
of 10.8%, 11.6% and 11.8% for 2024-26E, respectively. 
We also note that C&D has recognized asset impairments of Rmb3.8bn in 2022 and 
Rmb1.6bn in 2023 due to the housing price decline and weaker-than-expected sell-through 
for projects. Our deep dive into its asset impairments in these two years indicates that 
most of the impairments came from projects acquired in 2021, when the land market was 
still strong and developers bought land with high premiums. Considering 1) C&D now has 
few old land banks to sell, 2) higher margins on its projects acquired since 2022, and 3) 
high turnover rate, we think there will be less burden on the company to recognize asset 
impairments going forward, which would help to improve its profitability.

3. Robust balance sheet and low liquidity risk, with strong 
support from parent company
C&D's total assets have witnessed rapid growth to Rmb427bn with a 47% CAGR in 2018-
23, thanks to its aggressive expansion. However, it still has good control of its leverage. 
During its expansion period, its total debt (including perpetual bond) delivered a 24% 
CAGR in 2018-23, reaching Rmb97bn in 2023. Meanwhile, it maintained a healthy cash 
collection in 2023 at Rmb185bn with 98% cash collection rate, backed by its strong sales 
performance, which led to healthy operating cash flow. We believe C&D has a strong 
balance sheet with limited liquidity risk, given 1) net gearing ratio of 33.6%, 2) cash-to-
short-term debt ratio of 4.75x, and 3) liabilities-to-assets ratio (excluding presales 
deposits) of 58.5% as of 2023. We also note that it is a "Green" company under the "Three 
Red Lines" requirements.
C&D Real Estate, C&D's parent company, has provided significant funding support. As of 
2023, C&D has  
total debt (including perpetual bonds) of Rmb97bn, of which Rmb48bn (or 
49%) in loans and Rmb12bn (12%) in perpetual bonds are borrowed from its parentco; the 
rest are Rmb32bn (33%) in bank loans and Rmb5bn (4%) in other interest-bearing loans. 
Its borrowing costs have also come down to 3.75%, vs. 4.33% in 2022.

Investment Concerns
1. Relatively thin landbank of 1.4x years and the remaining 
saleable resources in 2021 might drag down C&D's asset 
turnover
C&D's landbank years (saleable resources/contracted sales) declined to 1.4x in 2023, from 
1.5x in 2022,  
which is relatively thin compared with other leading developers (e.g., CR 
Land, COLI, CMSK with ~3x landbank years). The relatively thin landbank suggests C&D's 
high operational efficiency  
and less pressure to sell old landbank, although it may also add 
uncertainty to the company's sales growth prospects as it would require C&D to replenish 
its landbank very efficiently. Considering its land acquisition focus on high-tier cities (e.g., 
Shanghai, Hangzhou, Xiamen, etc.), the overcrowded land auction market environment in 
these cities might add uncertainty for C&D to replenish its landbank, especially during 
market downturns when all developers are similarly focusing on high-tier cities. Thus, 
once C&D's land acquisitions become insufficient, its sales may decline. 
The remaining saleable resources acquired in 2021 may also drag down C&D's asset 
turnover.  
C&D was  
aggressive in acquiring land in 2021, especially in 1H21 when the 
property market was very strong. It acquired Rmb261bn in saleable resources at a 
relatively high  
land price, >30% of which were in low-tier cities. As of 2023, C&D still has 
Rmb59.7bn saleable resources that it acquired in 2021 (or 22.4% of its total landbank). 
Among these saleable resources, Rmb29.7bn (or 50%) are in low-tier cities such as Suqian, 
Jiangyin and Huangshi ( Exhibit 59 ). Considering relatively weak housing demand in these 
cities, it may be difficult for C&D's sales to perform well at the project level.

2.  
Financial support from its parentco might harm C&D's 
earnings, with higher borrowing costs in the long term
The  
strong financial support from its parentco has helped C&D to maintain good liquidity, 
especially during market downturns. However, borrowing costs have been relatively high 
and could harm C&D's earnings in the long term. The borrowing costs for the loans were 
4.53% in 2023 (vs. 4.81% in 2022), and costs for the perpetual bond were ~4.5% in 2023 
(currently calculated by 5-year LPR * (1+VAT), but could be higher when the perpetual 
bond is renewed long term). C&D  
started to repay the perpetual bond in 2023 
(Rmb2.5bn). The progress it makes in the  
following years will be key to watch.

3. Frequent placements historically due to relatively thin 
shareholder equity
Going public via a back-door listing in 2016, C&D's equity base was initially relatively thin. 
To  
meet its business target, it raised HK$3.3bn equity capital via six placements in 2016-
22, representing ~16% of its attributable equity as of 2023. However, considering 1) it has 
become less aggressive in its land acquisition activities; and 2) it has sufficient cash on 
hand for land replenishment and operations, we believe C&D would have limited incentive 
to undertake further placements.

Financial Analysis and Earnings Estimates
10% core earnings CAGR in 2023-26E, with >9% dividend 
yield
We forecast  
C&D to achieve steady core earnings growth at 8%/14%/10% y-y to 
Rmb4.7bn/Rmb5.3bn/Rmb5.8bn in 2024-26E, respectively, with core earnings margin 
increasing to 3.3%/3.7%/3.9% y-y, backed  
by: 
• 3% revenue CAGR in 2023-26E: Thanks to its strong contracted sales, C&D has 
unbooked sales (on consolidated basis, including VAT) of  
Rmb208.7bn as of 2023. 
Together with the contribution from other businesses (e.g.,  
property management 
business), we forecast C&D's revenue to grow 5%/3%/2% in  
2024-26E.
• Gross margin recovery: Although  
C&D's gross margin may stay relatively low  
in 
the near term as lower margin projects acquired in 2020-2021 would still be the 
main revenue contributor, we expect it to start recovering in 2025, given the drag 
from booking low-margin projects acquired in 2020-21 will be much lower and we 
expect more contribution from higher-margin projects acquired after 2022. We 
forecast gross margins of 10.8%/11.6%/11.8% in 2024-26E.
 
We expect C&D to maintain a relatively stable dividend payout ratio of 50% (vs. 
43%/48%/51% in 2021-23 respectively), implying 9.6%/10.9%/11.9% dividend yield in 2024-
26E. Considering C&D's strong core earnings growth outlook and sufficient cash, we think 
its high DPS is sustainable.

Valuation
Price target methodology and key assumptions 
We initiate coverage on C&D  
with an Overweight rating and a price target of HK$17.90/
share. Our price target (which is also our base case scenario value) is derived from a 45% 
discount to our end-FY24 NAV estimate of HK$32.62/share. The 45% discount is based on 
our developers scorecard, which incorporates several metrics such as growth, profitability, 
and leverage. We give C&D a high-tier score for execution (8), financing (9), growth (7), 
and leverage (8), and a mid-tier score for  
landbank (7) and profitability (6), while its score 
for scale (7) is lower than that of the large developers in our coverage. As a result, our 
overall score for C&D is in the middle-to-upper range of our coverage universe, lower than 
other blue-chip state-owned enterprises (SOEs), but higher than POEs and semi-SOEs.
Our HK$32.62 end-2024 NAV estimate comprises HK$41.19/share of development 
properties, HK$1.18/share of other business segments (C&D Property Management and 
Holsin), and HK$9.76/share of net debt. Our NAV estimate values C&D's existing landbank 
and properties based on a sum-of-the-parts methodology: 
1.  
we use DCF to value the development properties, with a WACC of 10.1% (close to 
the midpoint of our WACC range for our coverage universe); and
2. we use a cap-rate approach (cap rate of 6-9%) to value C&D's investment 
properties
Scenario values
Base case = HK$17.90
In this scenario, we expect property prices to decrease 5% y-y in 2024 and remain flat 
thereafter in Tier 1, Tier 2, and low-tier cites. Our expectations are cautious, considering 
not only downward pressure on property prices, but also relatively limited new supply 
and recent strong supportive policies from local governments.
Bull case = HK$26.10
We derive our bull case scenario value by applying a lower NAV discount of 20%. In this 
scenario, we assume meaningful credit and policy relaxation drives up property prices and 
housing demand. 
Bear case = HK$9.80
We derive our bear case scenario value HK$9.8/share by applying a deeper NAV discount 
of 70%. In this scenario, we assume limited credit and policy easing potentially worsens 
property market sentiment and developers' liquidity. We also assume property prices and 
demand continue to drop.
Valuation
On our estimates, C&D is now trading at 4.6x 2025 P/E, which we think is undervalued

compared with H-share leading SOE developers, including CR Land (5.2x) and COLI (5.6x), 
considering its strong core earnings growth outlook and sufficient cash. More importantly, 
we see its high dividend yield of >9% in 2024-26E as attractive, assuming a stable payout 
ratio of 50%.
Key risks to our price target
1. poor sales and declining property prices should China's macro challenges persist; 
2. policy changes that negatively affect the industry; 
3. weaker-than-expected contracted sales, which would weigh on medium-term 
revenue growth; 
4. deeper-than-expected gross margin compression, which would undermine its core 
earnings; 
5. slower-than-expected land acquisitions, which would weigh on medium-term 
contract sales growth
