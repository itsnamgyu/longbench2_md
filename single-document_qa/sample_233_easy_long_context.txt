Handbook of Asian Criminology




Foreword

This Handbook of Asian Criminology could not come at a better time. As
India’s population rapidly approaches the size of China’s, as Myanmar seeks
engagement with peer nations that respect a Rule of Law, as research on
crime and justice
ﬂ
ourishes from Seoul to Sydney, no criminologist on earth
can ignore what our colleagues are doing in Asia.

A decade ago, I told the senior editor of this collection that the “future of
criminology lies in Asia.” I am honored that he has often reminded me of this
statement. Yet I do not claim any profound meaning for my observation.
Rather, I merely matched my prediction to the demographic trends. The
future of criminology must be in Asia simply because the future of most
people on earth is in Asia.

What will this mean for the quality of human existence? While the strug-
gle for food and survival remains problematic, especially in South Asia, the
struggle for freedom from fear—of criminal force—seems more daunting.
Across China and India, small farmers may have their land sold by corrupt
local politicians, losing centuries of family investment in the land. From
Afghanistan to Bangladesh, women suffer very high risks of rape or punish-
ment if they dare venture onto the streets without a man to chaperone them.
From the south of Thailand to many other locations, schools may be bombed
or teachers may be murdered for teaching young girls to read.

The booming economies and gleaming modern cities of Twentieth Century
Asia belie the strong traditions that hold back progress. The Indian idea of
“encounter killings” as a form of summary justice by police, for example,
collides with a rule of law. Yet a senior police of
ﬁ
cer who refused a politi-
cian’s request to kill someone this way (making it appear to be self-defense
by police against the criminal) did so on the grounds that the prospective
victim had not killed anyone himself, as accused, and so the police would not
kill him. Furious, the politician had the police of
ﬁ
cer transferred, and his
further career advancement blocked for at least 14 years.

The good news is that this police of
ﬁ
cer held fast to the substance, if not
always the procedures, of a rule of law. He did what police in the USA have
long been forced to do: to survive a confrontation between democracy and
due process. The apparently increasing occurrence of such confrontations
describes progress, the modern communications and Internet links of a growing
Indian middle class may help to raise standards of justice. Many criminals
punished in the USA are later found innocent based on new DNA evidence,
in cases publicized around the planet. Each of these may be a shock to


vi
Foreword
innocents about the state of justice. Yet it could also be a splendid indicator
of rising integrity. It is only when cultural demands for fairness become
intense enough to review the accuracy of punishment that such injustice can
be revealed. More global news of such efforts, in a wide range of countries,
spreads across the Internet daily and into Asia. That, in turn, makes interest
in criminology grow as an extension of middle-class empathy for victims of
crime and injustice.

There is another reason why the future of criminology lies in Asia. That
reason is the huge desire for learning found in Asia. In the past 4 years, I
have spent 20 weeks in Asia teaching police and criminologists in Turkey,
Israel, India, Vietnam, Taiwan, Korea, and Australia. In each of these visits
I have been impressed with the curiosity and zeal for learning I have seen.
The passion for reading research articles word for word is impressive. So
are the PowerPoint presentations prepared by the students I have taught,
mastering complex ideas into coherent and logical connections. Their con-
sumption of criminological research may already surpass the rest of the
world’s combined.

The same, of course, cannot yet be said of the production of research, at
least not in the English language journals. The Asian Journal of Criminology
is a bright beacon of such research. But the test of Asian research on crime
will be the growth rate of publications in journals without regions:
CRIMINOLOGY, JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL CRIMINOLOGY,
POLICE QUARTERLY, and POLICING, for example, all of which gladly
accept good research done anywhere on earth. Data from Asian countries
have already appeared in numerous articles, and should grow in future years
as more well-trained PhDs return home from graduate schools in the North
Atlantic.

The pace of research will increase even faster when Asian graduate schools
rise to the volume of US and European schools in annual PhD production.
Such an outcome is not far off. The key to this will be a steady commitment
to empiricism, and a steadfast resistance of the siren call of moral philosophy.
The discursive insights of the latter framework in criminology may merci-
fully jar Asian sensibilities, which may give quantitative empiricism a cul-
tural advantage in any case.

Therein lies a paradox. To the extent that Asia comes to dominate crimi-
nology, it is unlikely to do so in a regional way. Whatever cultural dimensions
criminology has—and they are many—they do not pose a barrier to building
a uni
ﬁ
ed, global science of crime. The effects of family bonds in preventing
crime, for example, appear to be universal, and not culturally dependent. The
deterrent effects of police patrols in crime hot spots may also be universal.
Domestic violence is certainly found in every nation, and education for
women may reduce it wherever it occurs. Asians who study these phenomena
will have as much desire as criminologists from elsewhere to make and test
general propositions, applying to all humans on all continents.

It is therefore possible that someday there will be no Handbook of Asian
Criminology. There may be many handbooks, global in scope. There may be
handbooks that tell readers of distinctive features of law and justice in different
nations or regions. But what there may not be is any claim that criminology


vii
Foreword
is different in Asia, just as we would reject the idea of “German science”
propagated in World War II.

If and when that day comes, it will be a long time from now. The impact
of nation-states on the nature of crime and justice problems makes criminol-
ogy without borders a dif
ﬁ
cult challenge. We will be many years in revealing
the commonalities of science across regions and even within Asia. Until then,
readers will
ﬁ
nd this Handbook indispensible.

1.1
Asia and Criminology in Asia
Moving Forward

It is traditional for editors to “talk up” the subject
matter of their book; but in our case, arguably, the
regional signi
ﬁ
cance of the subject matter is self-
evident. Within the Asian region, the People’s
Republic of China has already overtaken Japan as
the second largest economy in the world and is
likely to take over the top spot by the end of this
current decade (
New York
Times
, 15 August 2010,
“China passes Japan as second largest economy”).
India is moving rapidly up the ladder and will
soon become the third largest economy globally.
The International Monetary Fund estimates that
emerging Asia will be the main propellant of
world economic growth in the coming decades.
Europe, the USA, and Japan face serious reces-
sion. By contrast, the public
ﬁ
nancial system of
Asian countries appears in relatively good shape,
with debt ratios low, banking systems healthier,
and corporate balance sheets less stressed.
Furthermore, large foreign exchange reserves act
as an insurance against unexpected “global”
shocks (Tay
2010
)
. Wages and incomes are rising
and unemployment rates are not alarming.
Regional trade is at an all-time high and the
dependence on the USA and Europe for exports
has declined. China now ships only 35% of its
exports to the USA and European Union coun-
tries (Kawai and Petri
2010
)
.

In the coming decades, some trends in Asia
will likely develop in the context of further glo-
balization, developing regionalism and the ongo-
ing electronic and information revolution. First,
Asia is likely to develop a greater sense of
regional awareness and cohesion. The continent
is still comprised of subregions (Northeast,
Southeast, South, Central and West Asia). But
the region’s existing and developing institution
building (such as the Association of South
East Asian Nations, Shanghai Cooperation
Organisation and other, international, multi-lat-
eral or bi-lateral groupings) will gradually lead
toward a greater level of cross-Asian cooperation
(Ozawa
2009
)
. Second, the world con
ﬁ
guration
of power is becoming more evenly distributed
between traditional and emerging powers. In this
sense, Asia’s increasing role globally is evidenced
by the rise of G20 and enhancing reforms of the
World Bank and International Monetary Fund
(Tay
2010
)
. And third, Asia is likely to contribute
more to the mainstream of global intellectual
development. Asia will substantially change its

status as merely a recipient—or refractor and
assimilator—of Western cultural tradition. With
its traditional and intellectual cultures both expe-
riencing a renaissance, Asia will provide the
world with more public goods in the form of
ideas, principles, and values. The result will
doubtless be a fusion of cultures to the world.
Cultural and religious diversity and its accommo-
dation of these many differences is and has been
a hallmark of the Asian region. Tackling future
challenges across the world will require new val-
ues; Asian values attach much importance to
aspects of life, such as diligence, work ethics,
family cohesion, and consensus. Such values will
undoubtedly contribute to the eventual pooling of
shared values, which in turn will help tackle the
global challenges of the twenty-
ﬁ
rst century,
including crime control efforts.

As criminologists, we know that crime follows
opportunity and is embedded by processes of glo-
balization, economic growth, con
ﬂ
ict, and social
change; this is no less so in the Asian region. In
Asia and elsewhere the interdependence of nation
states has never been greater, and the necessary
quest for security, both domestically and exter-
nally, remains as pressing as ever (Broadhurst

2006
)
. The will to understand the operation of dif-
ferent criminal justice systems is also now more
crucial than ever, as nations rely increasingly on
mutual assistance in criminal matters. What are
the crime problems of Asia? In what ways do
Asian countries respond? These questions pose
practical challenges for law makers and policy
of
ﬁ
cials, but also of course for criminologists in
Asia; and more generally draw our gaze to the
development of the discipline of criminology
itself in Asia. In spite of the clear evidence of
institutional growth and signi
ﬁ
cance of criminol-
ogy in Asia, as Liu
(
2009
)
, the current President
of the Asian Criminological Society reminds us:

… the pace of growth is quite slow compared with
the rapid development of criminology in North
America and Europe. Understanding the develop-
ing criminology in Asia requires an equally good
understanding of the status of criminology in Asia,
of the features of Asian cultures and societies, of
the special features of crime and crime control in
Asia, and of the challenges and opportunities for
criminology in Asia. (Liu
2009
, p. 2)

In the long view, these matters have their
origins in the history of the discipline of crimi-
nology as a scholarly discipline within modern
and specialized institutions (see Garland
2011
;
Rafter
2009
)
. The international relations within
criminology, that is, the distribution of scholarly
communities, their output and communication
between them, can, in our view, be heuristically
characterized as center–periphery relations (see
Medina
2011
; Keim
2008
;
Hebenton and Jou

2012
). From a global perspective, criminology as
practiced in the United States (and maybe a con-
geries of other Anglo-phone countries including
United Kingdom) appears to constitute the center
of our discipline, whereas Asia, despite claims
for the internationalization and globalization
of the discipline, occupies part of a periphery.
One potentially useful conceptual framework
for thinking about this matter is illustrated in
Fig.
1.1
.

The three dimensions of scienti
ﬁ
c develop-
ment/underdevelopment; autonomy/dependency;
and centrality/marginality are all empirically
inter-related. For analytic purposes, however, we
can tease them apart. If we consider the problem
of scienti
ﬁ
c development, this requires an appro-
priate material, institutional, and individual basis.
Lack of the necessary material infrastructure,
including governmental sponsorship of research
and an appropriate political climate, hinders
development. Authorities attitude to access to
of
ﬁ
cial data and publishing of
ﬁ
ndings also
applies (we can witness this in the context of the
practice of criminological research in, for
instance, England and Wales, Wilkins
(
1984
)
referring to the 1980s and Radzinowicz
(
1994
)
referring to the 1990s). Institutional development
requires suf
ﬁ
cient general funding and adequate
income possibilities for researchers. This
ﬁ
rst
dimension, scienti
ﬁ
c development, is mainly
determined by external factors such as availabil-
ity of funding, scienti
ﬁ
c and higher education
infrastructures, and local academic cultures.
A second problem refers to the conditions of
existence of criminology, namely the dimension
of autonomy or dependency. At an ideal-type
level, an autonomous criminology contains the
capacity for self-reproduction and autonomous

development. The structural material factors
underlying the
ﬁ
rst dimension described earlier
make the strength of a center (such as USA and
Europe) dominant in the largely unidirectional
and uncritical
ﬂ
ow of criminological knowledge.
Dependency requires researchers from the Asian
region to rely upon their equivalents in the center
for key concepts and theoretical capital, reducing
the contribution of the periphery to a kind of
“testing ground for external validity” of such
ideas. Other indicators of this dimension include
the origin of higher degrees obtained by univer-
sity academic staff and researchers and the con-
struction of the university academic criminology
syllabus. Of course, this second dimension of
autonomy or dependency can largely be seen as a
product of the scienti
ﬁ
c process itself (rather than
external factors). Networks and collaboration are
also often illustrative of this dimension. Scholarly
productivity at least in terms of English language
outputs at the individual level is “highly depen-
dent on accessing professional international net-
works” (Teodorescu
2000
, and as noted by
Medina
2011
)
. Finally, a third problem hinges on
the problem of centrality and marginality, which
describes the relationship between existing crim-
inological communities and “international schol-
arship.”
Manifestations
of
marginalization
include: lack of visibility in internationally acces-
sible research databases of published literature,
the impact of unequal division of research labor,
and the fact that center studies the periphery, and
the corollary that the center is rarely the object of
study by the marginal. All these outcomes are
determined by processes key to the international-
ization of the discipline; particularly, scienti
ﬁ
c
journal publication policies combined with
English as the
lingua franca of international sci-
ence. In this sense, of course, our own
Handbook
of
Asian Criminology and its associated
ﬁ
ndings
are part of this “internationalization” context. By
these lights, publishing in the English language
means being accountable to “international” stan-
dards, yet those in the periphery face genuine
hurdles of budgets and often access to suf
ﬁ
cient
criminal justice system data to produce work of
suf
ﬁ
cient quality to meet “international” stan-
dards of recognition. More broadly, these exter-
nal demands may diminish the periphery’s
willingness to engage with local problems, con-
stantly being required to justify their research
and
ﬁ
ndings in a primarily center-focused
context.

When one considers Asian criminological
research, the general impression these days is
that it has gradually been on an upward trajectory
in terms of quantity and quality; as evidence, one
can take country-level reviews of research in
English language outputs, for example, Liu

(
2007
) and Zhang et al.
(
2008
) in relation to
People’s Republic of China; or Hebenton and Jou

(
2005
,
2012
) in the case of Taiwan; or Chui and
Lo
(
2008
) in respect of Hong Kong. Capacity
building is also evident—developments such as
the founding of the
Asian Journal
of Criminology
in 2006 by Springer Publishers, and the for-
mal establishment of the Asian Criminological
Society in Macao in December 2009, and with a

subregional focus, the Association of Chinese
Criminology and Criminal Justice in the US
(ACCCJUS), established at the San Francisco
meeting of the American Society of Criminology
in November 2010. An increasing number of
Asian scholars are now doing research that
focuses on both Asian and non-Asian topics. An
increasing number of scholars of non-Asian ori-
gin are also conducting research relating to Asian
phenomena. Details of the work carried out by
various scholars can be found in different publi-
cations, which are becoming increasingly visible
through the prism windows of the new profes-
sional associations mentioned above and through
focused publications (for example, the forthcom-
ing
Handbook of
Chinese Criminology
, edited by
Cao et al.
2013
, forthcoming).

Despite this, however, there is countervailing
news on the broader matter of Asia and interna-
tionalization. For example, Barberet
(

2001,
2007
)
used a content analysis to show that comparative
research involving two or more countries occurred
in only 5.8% of all American Society of
Criminology presentations in the 1990s (this work
has not been repeated for the new decade, as far as
the authors know). Few undergraduate university
programs in the United States have an international
criminal justice course. The teaching of compara-
tive methodology is also notably absent from the
criminology curriculum in many universities
(Barberet
2001
/7). The International Division of
the American Society of Criminology, is still rela-
tively small, as is the International Section of the
Academy of Criminal Justice Sciences. Coverage
of international scholars in US textbooks is still
rare. The proportion of international articles pub-
lished in one of our
ﬁ
eld’s leading journals,

Criminology
, ranged from 0 to 18% in the 1990s,
averaging 7.4% (Barberet
2001
)
. In relation to
Asian countries as an object of study, the analysis
of ASC presentations in the 1990s (
N = 8,287),
revealed a rank order of Japan (0.42%), China
(0.41), Taiwan (0.17), Hong Kong (0.12), Korea
(S) (0.08), and Philippines (0.06). A more recent
study (Hebenton and Jou
2012
) of Asia’s interna-
tional criminological research “footprint” evi-
dences the strength and diversity of publications
over the last decade, 2000–2010. They chose six
comparators, Hong Kong (China SAR), Japan,
Korea (S), PR China, Philippines, and Taiwan.
The authors, using the four premier e-databases
covering criminology and the social sciences
(Criminal Justice Abstracts, The US National
Criminal Justice Reference Service, Thomson-
Reuters Web of Knowledge, and PsychINFO),
identi
ﬁ
ed almost 700 separate English language
publications. Within the discipline of criminology
(as arguably in all
ﬁ
elds of the social sciences),
publications vary in terms of status and impor-
tance. One measure commonly used is the ISI/
Thomson-Reuters bibliometric, producing among
other things a “journal impact factor.” According
to this, the journal impact factor is the average
number of times articles from the journal which
have been published in the past 2 years have been
cited in the Journal Citation Reports (JCR) year. If
a journal has a higher impact factor, it means that
the journal is often cited and is thus “more impor-
tant.” The 5-year journal impact factor is the aver-
age number of times articles from the journal
published in the past 5 years have been cited in the
JCR year. This measure is understood to be more
stable than the 1-year
ﬁ
gure. There are 31 ISI/
Thomson-Reuters Web of Knowledge “criminol-
ogy & penology” journals, and Hebenton and Jou
looked at the performance of selected Asian com-
parators across the “top 20” journals. A number of
interesting features were apparent from the analy-
sis which presents cumulative proportions for the
Asian comparators. Hong Kong had by far the
largest proportion of papers in the 1–20 rankings;
some way behind come Japan and PR China. The
Philippines had the lowest proportion. Only Hong
Kong had a number of publications in the 1–5
rankings over the period under study. Turning to
Taiwan, of the 54 SSCI papers identi
ﬁ
ed, only one
of those had been placed in the “top 5”; Taiwan
had a comparatively small proportion in the “top
10” over the period under review, but rising to
around one-third cumulatively in the “top 20”
journals. Apart from divergent performance across
the Asian region, the authors conclude that the
empirical consequences of center–periphery rela-
tions are also visible in these
ﬁ
ndings and that
these too need greater acknowledgment and require
fuller examination and understanding.

1 Progress of Asian Criminology: Editors’ Introduction

1.2
Format of the Handbook

We are of the strong opinion that the challenge
for an enlightened criminology is to create a com-
munity of transnational scholars and practitioners
who seek to share their research and insights
about crime and its many manifestations.
Jianhong Liu reminds us that crime is a general
and human problem that troubles every country
and thus

…criminology is an academic response of man-
kind to the crime and justice problems. It is a gen-
eral social science, an international science, which
addresses the common human behavior of crime
and its control. Despite the wide diversity of
nations and cultures, there are enough common
features in human criminal behavior and crime
control to call for the study of shared experiences
and the exchange of knowledge in dealing with
crime problems in different nations and cultures.
Research and practices in Asian countries should
be part of the literature of international and com-
parative criminology. (Liu
2009
, p. 7)

This
Handbook of
Asian Criminology seeks to
represent the scholarly energy of a geographical
area rather than a particular perspective, arena or
“sub
ﬁ
eld” and in that sense is primarily an
endeavor in comparative research. It is this orien-
tation that serves to enhance the relevance of
research about Asia. The Handbook has three
sections, with this editors’ introduction, setting
out the development of criminological research
on and of the region, together with a broad assess-
ment of the varying state of crime and criminal
justice research.
Section one “Types of crime in
Asia” examines the empirical research base of
common and new forms of criminal activity. In
addition to internationally recognized and legally
categorized forms of crime (e.g., drug-related
crime), this section also draws attention to the
distinctiveness of socially contextualized crimi-
nal activity (cyber-crime, corruption). It provides
accounts of speci
ﬁ
c forms of criminality: when,
how, by whom and in what contexts they are car-
ried out, whether and why they are increasing or
declining, what particular issues they raise for
criminal justice agencies, and so on.
Section two
considers the current state of crime and the crimi-
nal justice system in a number of selected Asian
countries, with each chapter detailing the basic
detail of crime and punishment, including a brief
synopsis of the development and nature of the
criminal justice system. The
ﬁ
nal section,
Section
three “Victims and Offenders” provides the
reader with up-to-date accounts of both recent
victim-related developments in Asia, and how
such developments are evidenced in new ways of
seeking “justice” for victims and working with
offenders; the section includes country-speci
ﬁ
c
chapters on victims of crime in the criminal jus-
tice system and speci
ﬁ
c forms of victimization,
and includes research and policy development on
alternatives to formal criminal justice. Expanding
knowledge of “victims” has been gained from
both academic research and the political impact
of legislation, policy-making, and lobbying by
interest groups
. Much victimization is against the
most vulnerable, women and children, and this
section also focuses on these groups.

1.3
Limitations

Due to the practical constraints of length and the
volume of potential topics that could be addressed
under the banner of Asian criminology, many
topics were either discussed brie
ﬂ
y or not
included in the
ﬁ
nal product. However, beyond
such practical logistics, some omitted topics are
indicative of an inadequate knowledge base at
present. It is well known that, in many Asian
countries, of
ﬁ
cial data available for research use
are very limited. Frequently, governments con-
sider crime-related data to be politically sensi-
tive and are reluctant to disclose them to
researchers. Data collected by scholars are also
limited, with studies scattered and intertwined in
other areas of broader legal study. For instance,
detailed and systematic comparisons of mea-
sures of incidence and prevalence of crime based
on crime and victim surveys would be largely
impossible across Asian countries. Similarly, a
major feature of the Asian context is diversity
across Asian societies and cultures, with differ-
ent languages, different legal systems, and diver-
sity in crime and crime control systems and


6
J. Liu et al.
practices, and our
Handbook can only do limited
justice to the complexities.

On a further note of importance, in conversa-
tions as editors, we found ourselves frequently
speaking as though criminology possessed a
nationality—“American” criminology, “British”
criminology,
“European”
criminology,
and
“Asian” criminology. Usually, we assumed this to
be but a short-hand expression of general refer-
ence to criminology in that country or region, but
sometimes we actually were talking as though
criminology was endowed with a kind of national
character. At stake here was our recognition that
comparative analysis constitutes a particularly
fruitful way to demonstrate the profound inscrip-
tion of knowledge in local culture and institu-
tions; and that in our editorial role we were
engaged in a complex re
ﬂ
exive analysis of the
functioning of the
ﬁ
eld of criminology within the
Asian region as a whole and of its embeddedness.
The pursuit of such an enquiry necessarily rests
upon fashioning a more compelling sociological
account of the development of criminology, in
particular national contexts across Asia. No indi-
vidual chapter in the
Handbook is devoted to this
end, nor indeed to a broader consideration of
applicability of Western theories of crime and
transferability to other societies. We share the
view expressed by some commentators that
answers to such questions will, ultimately, be
empirical in nature (Zhang
2011
)
.

Despite its necessarily limited range of topics,
the
Handbook is a landmark publication, marking
a gear-change in the visibility of the research

ﬁ
eld on Asia for students and scholars alike. The

Handbook identi
ﬁ
es tropes, topics, and trends in
criminological research on Asia, and we wish to
heartily thank all our contributors for persevering
and helping in the completion of this ambitious
project. With its focus solely on English-language
publications, our
Handbook holds a mirror up to
the criminological communities in both Asia
itself and other parts of the English-speaking
world. Viewed this way, it provides a sense of
Asia’s criminological “footprint” in the largely
English language-based scienti
ﬁ
c literature. By
corollary, our
Handbook is also necessarily a
crude measure of the “internationalization” of
criminological work on and in Asia.

2.1
Introduction

Virtually all penal laws in the world include a

prohibition against homicide. Homicide as a gen-
eral term refers to all cases in which a human
being kills another human being by his or her own
act, omission, or procurement. However, not all
homicides carry criminal culpability. Sometimes,
a killing may be committed in self-defense or by
accident or any other circumstances that the law
permits. These are excusable homicides or
justi
ﬁ
able homicides. In this chapter, only crimi-
nal homicide is discussed and analyzed.

Countries differ considerably in how they
de
ﬁ
ne homicide and its categories. Some juris-
dictions further divide criminal homicide into
categories such as murder and manslaughter.
There are also categories of homicide based on
the level of intent, such as intentional homicide
and negligent homicide. Acts such as infanticide,
abortion, assisted suicide, and euthanasia may be
either included or excluded from the national
legal de
ﬁ
nition. Therefore, caution is usually
needed in comparing and explaining homicide
data across countries.

This chapter
ﬁ
rst introduces the data sources
of international homicide data and then describes
the recent homicide trends in Asian countries.
Based on empirical research, this chapter also
explores some correlates of homicide trends. In
addition, homicide clearance is also discussed
within a comparative approach.

2.2
International Homicide Data

Homicide data are usually considered the most
valid and reliable data for cross-national com-
parison among all internationally available vio-
lence
data
(Marshall
and
Block

2004
)
.
Comparative research on homicide has often used
homicide data from three international sources,
including the International Criminal Police
Organization (Interpol), the United Nations
Surveys of Crime Trends and Operations of
Criminal Justice Systems (UN-CTS), and the
World Health Organization (WHO). The
ﬁ
rst two
sources are cross-national criminal justice data
sources, and the last one is a cross-national pub-
lic health data source.

These three data sources often do not provide
similar homicide estimates. This is partly due to
de
ﬁ
nitional differences (Marshall and Block

2004
)
. According to Marshall and Block
(
2004
)
,
Interpol uses the term murder rather than homi-
cide. Murder refers to any act performed with the
purpose of taking human life. This de
ﬁ
nition
excludes manslaughter and abortion but not infan-
ticide. However, after 1978 manslaughter is not
explicitly excluded from the de
ﬁ
nition. In addi-
tion, Interpol does not provide data on
unintentional
homicide. In contrast, the UN-CTS survey includes

a few categories such as total homicides, total
intended homicides, attempted intended homi-
cides, and unintentional homicides. Different
countries may include or exclude euthanasia,
infanticide, assisted suicide, or assault resulting in
death. Unlike Interpol and UN data which collect
homicide data from criminal justice agencies in
member nations, WHO data are based on body
counts (i.e., on cause-of-death reports submitted
by participating nations) instead of incidents.
Further, WHO homicide data do not include
attempted or unintentional homicides (Marshall
and Block
2004
)
. Among these three sources of
cross-national comparative homicide data, the
WHO data are widely believed to be the most valid
(Gartner
1990
; Kalish
1988
; Messner and
Rosenfeld
1997
)
.

The United Nations Of
ﬁ
ce on Drugs and
Crime (UNODC) has developed the International
Homicide Statistics (IHS) which provides homi-
cide statistics in 198 countries and territories
from 2003 to 2008 (Harrendorf et al.
2010
)
. The
most recent UNODC homicide statistics can be
found in its new publication, The 2011 Global
Study on Homicide. The objective of this interna-
tional statistics is to improve the availability of
crime and criminal justice information and to
expand the knowledge of crime trends. UNODC
collects homicide data from a variety of data
sources, including data collected by UN-CTS,
data collected by other cross-national crime sta-
tistics sources such as Interpol and Statistical
Of
ﬁ
ce of the European Communities, interna-
tional public health data such as data collected by
WHO and Pan American Health Organization,
and 33 national law enforcement and criminal
justice data sources. One of the strengths of this
dataset is that all sources used are fully refer-
enced in the dataset and a methodological descrip-
tion is also provided (Harrendorf et al.
2010
)
.

According to the IHS dataset, in 2004 the
world average homicide rate was 7.6 per 100,000
population. Homicide rates (per 100,000 popula-
tion) in 2004 for the 16 subregions of East Africa,
North Africa, South America, Central Asia and
Transcaucasian Countries, East Asia, Near and
Middle East/South West Asia, South Asia, East
Europe, South East Europe, West and Central
Europe, and Oceania are presented in the map in
Fig.
2.1
. The map also suggests that the highest
homicide levels are found in the Americas and
Africa region, with the lowest homicide levels
generally in countries of Europe. Homicide rates
in Asia are also relatively low. The homicide data
by country shows that in 2004 Kazakhstan,
Cambodia, Democratic People’s Republic of

)

Korea, Myanmar, and Philippines had the highest
estimated homicide rates in Asia, while Hong
Kong, Japan, Qatar, and United Arab Emirates
had the lowest.

It should be noted that the IHS dataset does not
include killings in armed con
ﬂ
ict committed by
groups of up to several hundred members.
Therefore, the homicide data presented here
should be interpreted with caution in countries
affected by armed con
ﬂ
ict. It is also important to
note that the IHS dataset is about intentional
homicide, that is, unlawful death purposefully
in
ﬂ
icted on a person by another person. In other
words, negligent homicides are not included.
Thus, the method used by IHS captures the most
basic commonality between the various data
sources. Further, because of differences in the
de
ﬁ
nition of homicide, countries may or may not
count offenses such as assault leading to death,
euthanasia, infanticide, or assistance with suicide
in the homicide data. As a result, the differences in
intentional homicide data here between countries
and regions re
ﬂ
ect not only the different numbers
of killings across areas but also the extent to which
countries and regions classify different types of
killing as homicide (UNODC
2004
)
.


2.3
Recent Homicide Trends in Asia

The UNODC’s
(
2010
) international homicide
data can be used to depict the changes in homi-
cide rates over time in many countries.
However, as explained above, comparisons
between countries should be made with cau-
tion. In addition, data recording method in one
country may also change over time. The aver-
age intentional homicide rates for countries in
Asia and Oceania from 2003 to 2008 are pre-
sented in Fig.
2.2
. Due to the incomplete infor-
mation of some countries, not all the countries
are included. The homicide trends in recent

are going down slowly, and there have not been
abrupt increases or decreases from year to year.
The country level data collected by UNODC
are also grouped by subregion and presented in

Social Factors and Homicide

The macro-level empirical research on homicide
has described and analyzed a number of factors
that are correlated with homicide rates, and
majority of this body of research has studied the
homicide rates over time with a comparative
approach. Some Asian countries and regions such
as Japan, Singapore, Hong Kong, and Taiwan are
often selected in the comparative research, and
the social factors that have been studied in the
literature include availability of
ﬁ
rearms, use of
capital punishment, youth population, population

diversity, democracy, modernization, social stress
and support, and many others. This section
reviews the empirical literature that has studied
homicide rates in Asian countries.

2.5
Use of Firearm in Homicide

The availability of
ﬁ
rearms often plays an impor-
tant role in homicide rates. In the UNODC
2010
report of International Statistics of Crime and
Justice, it is found that areas with high homicide
rates are usually the areas with the highest per-
centage homicide with
ﬁ
rearms (Harrendorf et al.

2010
)
. Data from Fig.
2.3 suggest that Asian
countries are similar to European countries in
terms of the percentage of homicides with
ﬁ
rearm.
In contrast, Americas have the highest percent-
age of homicides with
ﬁ
rearm in the world.

In a cross-national study on homicide among
children, Krug et al.
(
1998
) speci
ﬁ
cally examined
the homicide rates among children in the USA
with those in other countries. In this study, the
selected countries were high-income countries
de
ﬁ
ned by World Bank in 1994, among which
Asian countries and regions included Singapore,
Japan, Israel, Taiwan, and Hong Kong. The data
about childhood homicide were between 1990
and 1995. Krug et al. found that among the Asian
countries selected, Israel had the highest
ﬁ
rearm-
related homicide rates for children, while other
Asian countries in the study had the lowest

ﬁ
rearm-related homicide rates. However, incon-
sistent with the
ﬁ
ndings reported by Harrendorf
et al.
(
2010
)
, Israel did not have the highest total
homicide rate. In fact, among the Asian countries
studied, Singapore had the highest non
ﬁ
rearm-
related homicide rate for children and also the
highest total homicide rate for children.

2.6
Capital Punishment and
Homicide

Research using homicide data has explored the
deterrent effect of capital punishment on homi-
cide. The major concern of this body research is
whether the threat of execution deters homicide
better than other criminal sanctions. As the
most serious violent crime, homicide usually
receives the harshest punishment in the crimi-
nal justice system, and when available, death
penalty is often used. Often, the public are
strongly supportive of a death penalty for mur-
der (Johnson
2006
)
.

According to Zimring and Johnson
(
2008
)
,
Asian countries provide a better context to explore
the deterrent effect of capital punishment. First,
there is a great variety of political systems and
policies toward capital punishment in Asia.

ﬁ
rearm, 2003–2008 (Harrendorf et al.

)



17
2 Homicide in Asia
Second, many Asian countries are undergoing
rapid changes in death penalty laws and practices.
Third, Asian countries are less in
ﬂ
uenced by the
European culture, which provides more social
contexts for comparative analyses and theory
generalization. Fourth, most of the executions in
the world are carried out in Asia, ranging from 85
to 95% in recent years. In addition, about 95% of
Asian populations live in the jurisdictions which
use capital punishment (Zimring and Johnson

2008
)
.

Zimring et al.
(
2010
) studied the deterrent
effects of capital punishment on homicide trends
in Asia. Speci
ﬁ
cally, this study used Hong Kong
as a comparison city to examine the impacts of
executions on homicide rates in Singapore over
time. According to Zimring et al., there are simi-
larities between Singapore and Hong Kong with
regard to many aspects including population den-
sity, annual population growth, economic growth,
adult literacy, birth rate, migrants-population
ratio, and life expectancy. In addition, homicide
levels and trends are remarkably similar in these
two cities over 35 years after 1973.

In Singapore, offenders convicted of murder
will be sentenced to death. Zimring et al.
(

2010
)
combined different sources of data and described
that murder executions in Singapore rose in
1992 and dropped back quickly after the 1994–
1995 peak. Further, homicide trials in Singapore
often take a few months with a speedy appeal
process after conviction. In contrast, Hong Kong
had no executions from 1967 to 1998, and since
1993, mandatory life sentences are imposed for
murder.

To explore the relationship between execution
rates and homicide rates in Singapore, Zimring
et al.
(
2010
) used the murder rate in Hong Kong
as a control variable in the statistical analyses.
They estimated 14 models of homicide trend in
Singapore during 1973–2007 and its shorter trend
during 1981–2007. They concluded that the
changes in execution levels had no signi
ﬁ
cant
impacts on the homicide trend in Singapore.
Speci
ﬁ
cally, the decline in homicide rate hap-
pened before the sudden increase in executions in
1992, and the changes of homicide rate over time
were largely unrelated to the extent of execution.

2.7
Youth Population and Homicide

Youth violence is a widespread problem around
the world, and the highest homicide rate has been
usually found among males between the ages of
15 and 29. Research showed that homicide rates
among youth aged 10–24 increased in many parts
of the world between 1985 and 1994 (Legge

2008
)
. The research literature provides a wealth
of approaches, focusing on different levels of
explanations: individual, situational, and social
cultural and economic factors. Among these fac-
tors, prior research often emphasizes the impor-
tance of the socioeconomic status of the family
and of youth. According to Legge
(
2008
)
, the
international labor data showed that working
poverty among youth was especially prevalent in
sub-Saharan Africa and South Asia.

Some criminologists contend that the effect of
age on crime is invariant across crime categories
and cultural conditions (Gottfredson and Hirschi

1990
)
. In other words, the age effect on crime is
everywhere and at all times the same because
crime declines as age increases. Empirical stud-
ies on homicide rates in some Asian countries
suggest that this thesis needs to be modi
ﬁ
ed.

Johnson
(
2008
)
, for example, described
Japan’s postwar homicide decline and the vanish-
ing young killers in particular. Japan’s homicide
rate has dropped 70% and become one of the
lowest homicide rates in the world. According to
Johnson, the World Health Organization data
showed that the Japan’s homicide rate was 0.6
per 100,000 population in 2002, a rate that was
about half the mean and the median for other
developed nations. Comparing with other Asian
countries, Japan also had few homicides.
According to Hasegawa and Hasegawa
(
2000
)
,
Japan’s postwar decline in homicide rate has
made it an extraordinary country.

According to Johnson
(
2008
)
, the most plau-
sible explanation for Japan’s homicide drop was
best described demographically. Johnson found
that Japan was a striking exception to the pattern
found in other nations where young males were
most likely to kill. Data showed that, in contrast,
the most murderous demographic in Japan was


18
M. Dai
men in their 40s and 50s. In fact, Japan’s homi-
cide rate in 2000 was higher among men in their
50s than among males aged 20–24. Further,
young Japanese males, those born after 1960,
committed fewer murders than previous cohorts
of young males did. Data showed that young
Japanese males now committed one-tenth as
many homicides as their counterparts did in 1955.
Thus, young Japanese males not only commit
fewer murders than youth in other countries, they
kill far less frequently than their predecessors did
in previous decades.

It is not common to
ﬁ
nd countries where the
propensity to kill peaks so late. However,
Johnson
(
2008
) found that South Korea resem-
bled Japan. Johnson collected data from the
reports by the Supreme Prosecutors Of
ﬁ
ce of
South Korea. According to the of
ﬁ
cial data, in
2004, only 13.1% of suspects indicted for homi-
cide in South Korea were aged 30 or under.
Compared with the homicide rate in Japan,
South Korea’s total homicide rate (excluding
attempts) was a little higher at the rate of 1.67
per 100,000 in 2004. Taken together,


the
ﬁ
ndings
on homicide from Japan and South Korea

suggest that how homicide rates are patterned
can vary across countries, and the different

patterns in Japan and South Korea are indeed
noteworthy.

The Japanese decline is a notable trend,
because homicide tends to increase during the
industrialization process (LaFree and Drass

2002
)
. However, very limited research has stud-
ied the homicide drop in Japan and especially the
homicide drop among young Japanese. This body
of research attempted to offer some explanations.
For example, Roberts and LaFree
(
2004
) studied
the declining levels of economic stress in postwar
Japan on homicide rates. Extant explanations also
include social structure (Park
2006
) and culture
(Komiya
1999
)
.

Hiraiwa-Hasegawa
(
2005
) developed a risk-
assessment explanation. They argue that young
males became more risk averse in the postwar
period. During this period time, income and edu-
cational level rose, while inequality and the aver-
age number of children per household declined
due to the nation’s postwar economic achieve-
ments. Further, In Japan, homicide was a very
risky way of resolving con
ﬂ
ict. First, there is a
high probability that would be assailants will
themselves be injured by acts of self-defense. In
Japan, weapon is used in most homicides, and
about 60% of all instruments of death are knives.
In contrast, guns are used in only about 5% of
homicides. Second, the homicide clearance rate
in Japan is extremely high, and it is very likely
that a successful killer will be caught by the
police. Data show that the Japanese police clear
about 96% of all homicides reported to the police,
while the chance of getting away with murder is
about 1 in 3 for America, in 4 for France, and just
1 in 25 for Japan (Finch
2001
)
. For the above rea-
sons, it is argued that murder is relatively rare in
Japan.

2.8
Population Diversity and
Homicide

Population diversity can be described along two
dimensions:
heterogeneity
and
inequality
(Avison and Loring
1986
)
. Heterogeneity is
based upon the distribution of a population
among groups in terms of nominal parameters
such as ethnicity, race, language, or religion.
Inequality refers to status distribution in terms
of a graduated parameter such wealth, income,
or education (Blau
1977
)
.

Cross-national studies have often reported a
positive correlation between income inequality
and homicide rates. This correlation suggests that
in a country where income inequality is high,
homicide rate is also high, and this correlation
has been observed by studies employing different
samples of nations, different measures of vari-
ables, and different control variables (Braithwaite
and Braithwaite
1980
; Kick and LaFree
1985
;
Messner
1980
)
. However, the evidence concern-
ing the effects of heterogeneity on homicide is
less clear.

Using homicide data from the World Health
Organization from 1967 to 1971, Avison and
Loring
(
1986
) examined the impact of income
inequality and ethnic heterogeneity on homicide
rates for a sample of 32 nations and regions. This


19
2 Homicide in Asia
sample included Japan, Hong Kong, Philippines,
Thailand, and Taiwan. They found that the two
dimensions of population diversity had signi
ﬁ
cant
main
effects
on
cross-national
homicide.
Speci
ﬁ
cally, as heterogeneity and inequality
increase, the homicide rate increases. In addition,
increased ethnic heterogeneity exacerbated the
impact of income inequality on homicide rates.

2.9
Democracy and Homicide

There were simultaneous increases in democrati-
zation and violent crime rates in many countries
during the second half of the twentieth century.
According to Potter et al.
(
1997
)
, this rapid politi-
cal transformation began in Southern Europe in
the 1970s, spread to Latin America and parts of
Asia in the 1980s, and then moved on to areas of
sub-Saharan Africa, Eastern Europe, and the
Soviet Union in the late 1980s and early 1990s.

LaFree and Tseloni
(
2006
) studied whether
the wave of democratization in the last half of
the twentieth century could explain the global
rise in violent crime rates. They collected annual
time-
series data from WHO on homicide victim-
ization rates per 100,000 population in 44 coun-
tries for varying years between 1950 and 2000.
Asian countries such as Japan, Israel, Philippines,
Singapore, and Thailand were included in the
analysis.

In this study, the democracy measure was
derived from evaluations of four characteristics
of national governments. These four characteris-
tics included the competitiveness of political partici-
pation, the openness of executive recruitment, the
competitiveness of executive recruitment, and the
constraints on the chief executive.

According to LaFree and Tseloni
(
2006
)
, vio-
lent crime rates are curvilinear with the highest
rates in countries that are transitioning between
autocracy and democracy. In other words, homi-
cide rates of full democracies on average may
not be signi
ﬁ
cantly different from countries with
autocratic governments. Further, countries mov-
ing from autocratic to transitional democracies
will experience a signi
ﬁ
cant increase in homi-
cide rates.


2.10
Modernization and Homicide

The modernization perspective asserts that crime
booms are inevitable results of the rapid social
changes experienced by nations that are in transi-
tion from traditional to modern forms of organi-
zation (Lafree and Drass
2002
)
. According to this
perspective, crime results when modern values
and norms come into contact with and disrupt
older, established systems of role allocation.
During the transitional period, the emerging new
roles are not fully institutionalized and integrated
into society, making normative guidelines ambig-
uous, which in turn disrupt the traditional forms
of social organization. Involved in this transi-
tional process are a wide range of concepts in
criminological theories, including social disorga-
nization, anomie, breakdown, tension, and strain.
These concepts help explain why modernization
is linked to rising crime rates and other forms of
deviance. It suggests that crime booms are most
likely to occur in industrializing societies as they
are shifting from agricultural to industrial and
service economies (LaFree and Drass
2002
)
.

According to LaFree and Drass
(
2002
)
, the
modernization perspective emphasizes crime
booms which are de
ﬁ
ned as positive, rapid, and
lasting changes in crime rates. To explain crime
booms and test the effects of industrialization and
modernization, LaFree and Drass used annual
homicide victimization data of 34 nations from
1956 to 1998 and assembled an annual time-
series dataset of WHO homicide victimization
rates. The sample included three industrialized
countries and regions from Asia, and they are
Singapore, Hong Kong, and Japan. However, all
the industrializing nations in the sample were
from east European and Latin American coun-
tries. In support of modernizaitonalists, this com-
prehensive study found that 70% of industrializing
nations had homicide booms.

In contrast, fewer than 21% of industrialized
nations did. Thus, Lafree and Drass concluded
that homicide trends were a more urgent contem-
porary problem in the industrializing countries
than in the industrialized countries. However, the
implications of this
ﬁ
nding for Asian countries


20
M. Dai
are limited because none of the industrializing
countries in Asia were included in this analysis.

2.11
Social Stress, Support, and
Homicide

Agnew
(
1992
) points out that failure to achieve
expectations may lead to such emotions as anger,
resentment, rage, dissatisfaction, disappointment,
and unhappiness, which are emotions customar-
ily associated with strain in criminology. In his
general strain theory, Agnew emphasized strain
as the key concept for understanding and explain-
ing crime and delinquency in general. Macro-
level empirical research has considered violent
crime to be major possible response to social
stress. For example, in two comparative analyses
of social stress in the 50 states of the USA, it is
reported that stressful life events were positively
correlated
with
all
seven
index
crimes.
Speci
ﬁ
cally, the higher the state stress level, the
higher the crime rates for these states (Linsky and
Straus
1986
; Linsky et al.
1995
)
.

Israel has been studied to explore the in
ﬂ
uences
of social stress and social support on homicide
and other violent behavior. Landau
(
1988
) inves-
tigated at the aggregate level the relationship
between the subjective perception of social stress
and support and violence (i.e., homicide and rob-
bery) in Israeli society. The analysis was based
on monthly data for the years 1967–1979. Violent
crime was positively related to most of the sub-
jective stress indicators and negatively related to
the subjective perception of national solidarity.

Landau
(
1997
) reexamined the effects of
social stress and social support on homicide for
the years 1979–1993. According to Landau, rep-
lication over time was particularly important in
the case of Israel, due to the dynamic and highly
stressful characteristics of this society. The period
of 1979–1993 was characterized by major crises
and dramatic events in Israel’s security and econ-
omy. The most salient were the war in Lebanon,
the Palestinian uprising, and the Gulf War. In
addition, these years witnessed times of eco-
nomic prosperity as well as economic hardship,
recession, dramatic increases in the rate of
in
ﬂ
ation, labor disputes, prolonged strikes,
terrorist attacks, and other acts of violence.

In the follow-up study by Landau
(
1997
)
, the
independent variables related to stress included
the state of the country and government handling
(regarding general situation, economic situation,
security situation, and political situation) and
personal situation (personal economic situation),
coping, and mood. The independent variables
related to national solidarity included solidarity
between ethnic groups, solidarity between reli-
gious and secular groups, and readiness for eco-
nomic sacri
ﬁ
ces. This study found that economic
stress had the most permanent and consistent
effects over time on homicide, and the effects of
social solidarity on homicide were stable over
time. The consistent and permanent effect of

economic stress on homicide in both studies is
especially noteworthy. The
ﬁ
ndings are also in
line with a wide range of studies connecting
objective economic stress factors such as in
ﬂ
ation
and unemployment with homicide.

2.12
Suicide and Homicide

There are patterns about suicide and homicide in
a society, and some social factors may be corre-
lated with both suicide and homicide. In a study
of 64 countries and regions, including China,
Hong Kong, Israel, Japan, Korea Republic,
Singapore, Macau, and other countries in the
world, He et al.
(
2003
) examined lethal violence
(i.e., suicide and homicide) during 1989–1993.
The predictors of this study included factors such
as income inequality, economic development,
unemployment rate, and divorce rate.

He et al.
(
2003
) found that income inequality
and economic development were not related to
lethal violence but were related to the tendency
of suicide over homicide. In particular, high
inequality reduced the tendency to express frus-
tration inwardly against oneself and increased the
tendency to express frustration outwardly against
other people. Further, the economic development
increased the tendency to express one’s frustra-
tion inwardly against oneself and reduced the
tendency of expressing one’s frustration against


21
2 Homicide in Asia
others. Finally, they found that divorce increased
both suicide and homicide in the contemporary
societies of the world.

Consistent with the
ﬁ
ndings of He et al.

(
2003
)
, Japan’s homicide and suicide rates are
noteworthy. As a country of one of the lowest
homicide rates in the world, Japan has a high sui-
cide rate. According to Johnson
(
2008
)
, postwar
developments have made Japan af
ﬂ
uent without
creating extreme social inequalities or the con-
centrations of poverty. Empirical research shows
that homicide problems are usually correlated
with social inequality, and thus homicide is not a
serious problem in Japan. During the postwar
period,
the
homicide
rate
had
reduced
signi
ﬁ
cantly.
In contrast, suicide rate is high in Japan. The
combined rate of lethal violence (i.e., homicide
and suicide) in Japan exceeds that for every other
industrialized nation, and it is about twice the aver-
age for all industrialized countries (Johnson
2008
)
.
Particularly, males commit about three quarters
of suicides in Japan, and since 1998 the nation’s
suicide rate has risen substantially among several
subpopulations, including young men (Miyazaki
and Otani
2004
)
. According to Johnson
(
2008
)
,
about 40 times more Japanese kill themselves
than kill other people.

2.13
Homicide Clearance

Clearance rate is a measure of crimes solved by
the police, and homicide clearance is usually rel-
atively high among all the categories of violence.
However, homicide clearance varies across coun-
try, and the Japan’s high homicide clearance rate
is remarkable. In a comparative study, Roberts

(
2008
) shows that homicide clearance rates in
Japan and USA are stable between 1994 and
2004. However, Japanese homicide clearance
rates were around 95% compared with roughly
60% in the United States.

There are a number of reasons for the extremely
high homicide clearance rate in Japan. Studies
have focused on the high level of citizen coopera-
tion and the good police–citizen relationship in
Japan which are essential parts of homicide inves-
tigation (Bayley
1991
; Fujimoto
1994
; Rake

1987
; Litwin
2004
; Riedel and Jarvis
1998
)
. In
addition to these studies, Roberts
(
2008
) has
focused on the characteristics of homicides
in Japan and the categorization of homicide in
of
ﬁ
cial statistics as an explanation for the much
higher homicide clearance rate in Japan than in
other countries such as the United States.

Using of
ﬁ
cial summary statistics from 2000 to
2004, Roberts
(
2008
) found that homicides in
Japan contained a higher proportion of easy-
to-clear cases, including those with non
ﬁ
rearm
weapons, family member offenders, and child
victims. First, homicide clearance studies have
found that cases involving a
ﬁ
rearm weapon are
less likely to clear than those involving a knife or
strangulation, because of the lack of close contact
with the victim and less physical evidence (e.g.,
offender’s hair, blood, and
ﬁ
ngerprints) (Regoeczi
et al.
2000
; Litwin
2004
; Puckett and Lundman

2003
; Addington
2006
)
. In Japan, the general
public is banned from owning
ﬁ
rearms. Between
2000 and 2004, only 3.4% of homicides in Japan
were committed with
ﬁ
rearms, and most homi-
cides were committed with knives, blunt objects,
or by strangulation. In contrast, 65.7% of the
homicides in the United States were committed
with
ﬁ
rearms. Second, homicides committed by
known offenders, especially family members,
have much greater chance of clearance than
homicides by strangers (Riedel and Rinehart

1996
; Roberts
2007
)
. Offenders in family-related
homicides are more likely to confess than offend-
ers unknown to the victims. Also, family-related
homicides tend to have more potential eyewit-
nesses. Third, homicide incidents with child vic-
tims have usually been found to have greater
chance of clearance due to the restricted routine
activities of children (Regoeczi et al.
2000
;
Puckett and Lundman
2003
; Addington
2006
;
Riedel and Rinehart
1996
)
.

Roberts
(
2008
) also found that categorization
of homicides in Japanese of
ﬁ
cial statistics
included attempted homicides and excluded rob-
bery-related homicides, which could also explain
the differences between the clearance rate for
homicide in Japan and that in other countries. In
Japan, robbery-related homicide cases were less
likely than other homicides to be cleared. Between


22
M. Dai
2000 and 2004, non-robbery-related homicide
clearance rates averaged 94.7%, whereas rob-
bery-related homicide clearance rates averaged
84.9%. In recent years, about half of the Japanese
cases categorized as “homicide” were actually
attempted homicides. However, the clearance
rates for the two types of offenses in Japan are
not very different: 95.8% for attempted homi-
cides and 93.4% for completed homicides. In
sum, though categorization of homicides in Japan
may be different when comparing with other
countries, the overall clearance in Japan is con-
sistently high.

2.14
Conclusion

There are a number of international homicide
data sources, and three data sources including
Interpol, UN-CTS, and WHO are often used by
scholars to describe international homicide
trends. These data sources sometime provide dif-
ferent estimates, because there are de
ﬁ
nitional
differences among these data sources. In addi-
tion, countries vary in their legal de
ﬁ
nitions and
reporting practices to the international data
sources. Using these data sources, empirical
research has explored homicide trends in Asia
and offered a number of explanations for the
homicide trends. These studies are usually at the
macro-level, and the factors that have been stud-
ied include
ﬁ
rearms, capital punishment, popula-
tion characteristics (such as youth population and
population diversity), and social characteristics
(such as democracy, modernization, and social
stress). Homicide clearance is also analysis with
a comparative approach.

Though empirical research has offered a broad
range of explanations for homicide trends, not all
the Asian countries have been extensively ana-
lyzed. Some countries and regions (such as Japan,
South Korea, Singapore, Taiwan, Israel, Hong
Kong) are more studied than other countries in the
comparative research. Future research should
address this limitation by improving current cross-
national data sources on homicide and including
more Asian countries in the comparative analyses.

3.1
Introduction

According
to
Transparency
International’s
Corruption Perceptions Index (CPI) in 2010, cor-
ruption remains a serious problem in many Asian
countries. Similarly, the
Global Competitiveness

Report 2009–2010 also con
ﬁ
rms that the public
trust of politicians is low in these countries.
However, unlike the other Asian countries,
Singapore and Hong Kong are not seriously
affected by corruption as re
ﬂ
ected in their top
two ranking and scores among Asian countries
on the 2010 CPI and the 2009–2010 Public
Trust of Politicians indicator in the
Global
Competitiveness
Report.

The purpose of this chapter is twofold. The

ﬁ
rst aim is to identify the causes of the high level
of corruption and low level of public trust of poli-
ticians in Asian countries. Second, this chapter
discusses how these two problems can be tackled
by referring to the successful experiences of
Singapore and Hong Kong. This chapter is
divided into seven sections. The
ﬁ
rst two sections
focus respectively on the nature of corruption and
low level of public trust of politicians in many
Asian countries. The causes of these two prob-
lems are analyzed in the third and four sections.
The
ﬁ
fth section discusses government effective-
ness in Asian countries according to three indicators.
The sixth section identi
ﬁ
es the lessons to be
learnt from Singapore’s and Hong Kong’s
success in curbing corruption and enhancing trust
in government. This chapter concludes that it is
not possible for other Asian countries to adopt
Singapore’s and Hong Kong’s experiences
because of their contextual differences. Never-
theless, these Asian countries should realize that
political will is needed to curb corruption and an
effective civil service is an important prerequi-
site for enhancing the citizens’ trust in their
government.

3.2
Corruption in Asian Countries

The United Nations Development Programme
(UNDP
1999
, p. 7) has de
ﬁ
ned corruption as “the
misuse of public power, of
ﬁ
ce or authority for
private bene
ﬁ
t—through bribery, extortion,
in
ﬂ
uence peddling, nepotism, fraud, speed money
or embezzlement.” However, for this chapter,
corruption is de
ﬁ
ned as “the misuse of public
or
private power, of
ﬁ
ce or authority for private
bene
ﬁ
t.” This modi
ﬁ
ed version of the UNDP’s
de
ﬁ
nition of corruption is adopted here for two
reasons: it identi
ﬁ
es the seven major forms of
corruption; and it applies to both the public and
private sectors.

Table
3.1 con
ﬁ
rms that corruption is a serious
problem in many Asian countries as it shows that
among the 25 Asian countries included in the
2010 CPI, only three countries have attained

a score above 7.0, namely, Singapore (9.3), Hong
Kong (8.4), and Japan (7.8). Among the other 22
countries, Taiwan (5.8), Bhutan (5.7), Brunei
Darussalam (5.5), South Korea (5.4), and Macao
SAR (5.0) are the only
ﬁ
ve countries with a CPI
score of 5.0 and above. At the other extreme,
there are 12 countries with CPI scores below 3.0,
with Myanmar (1.4) and Afghanistan (1.4) being
perceived as the most corrupt Asian countries.


Similarly, Table
3.2 provides the 2009 data on
the World Bank’s Control of Corruption gover-
nance indicator for 26 Asian countries and
con
ﬁ
rms that Singapore, Hong Kong, and Japan
are the three least corrupt countries in Asia.
Brunei, Bhutan, Taiwan, and South Korea are the
other four Asian countries with a percentile rank
above 70. At the other extreme, Table
3.2 also
shows that Laos, Cambodia, North Korea,
Afghanistan, and Myanmar are perceived to be
the
ﬁ
ve most corrupt Asian countries. The remain-
ing 14 countries had percentile ranks ranging
from 13.3 for Pakistan, to 68.1 for Macao SAR.


3.3
Public Trust of Politicians
in Asian Countries

As corruption is a serious problem in many Asian
countries, it is not surprising that their citizens do
not have a favorable view of their politicians as
re
ﬂ
ected in their distrust of politicians’ honesty.
Tables
3.3 and
3.4 show that among the 20 Asian
countries only Singapore and Hong Kong are the

Philippines, Nepal, Mongolia, and Bangladesh

national government (joint third rank), law courts,
civil service, parliament, town councils, national
television, and the national newspapers, to name the
top ten trusted institutions in Singapore.

3 Curbing Corruption and Enhancing Trust in Government: Some Lessons from Singapore and Hong Kong

In Hong Kong, the 2001 East Asian Barometer
(EAB) survey asked respondents how much trust
they had in eight public institutions. Table
3.6
shows that the military and courts were the most
trusted institutions (82%), followed by the civil
service (70%), television (69%), national govern-
ment (64%), parliament (62%), local government
(55%), and political parties (29%). According to
Lam and Kuan
(
2008
, p. 201), the high level of
distrust of political parties among the Hong Kong
respondents can be attributed to “their perceived
ineffectuality and hypocrisy.”


3.4
Causes of Corruption in Asian
Countries

Why is corruption such a serious problem in Asian
countries? Leslie Palmier
(
1985
, p. 272) has
identi
ﬁ
ed three important causes of corruption
from his comparative analysis of anti-corruption
measures in Hong Kong, India and Indonesia.
According to him:

Bureaucratic corruption seems to depend not on
any one of the [three] factors identi
ﬁ
ed, but rather
on the balance between them. At one extreme, with
few opportunities, good salaries, and effective
policing, corruption will be minimal; at the other,
with many opportunities, poor salaries, and weak
policing, it will be considerable.

In other words, corruption results from the
combined effect of ample opportunities, low salaries,
and the low probability of detection and punish-
ment for corrupt behavior. Thus, to combat
corruption effectively, the governments in the
Asian countries should introduce reforms to
minimize if not eliminate these three causes.

Surveys conducted in many Asian-Paci
ﬁ
c
countries con
ﬁ
rm the signi
ﬁ
cance of low salaries
as this has been identi
ﬁ
ed as a key cause for cor-
ruption by the respondents. For example, a 2001
national survey of 2,300 respondents in Indonesia
found that low salaries were identi
ﬁ
ed as the most
important cause of corruption by 51.4% of the
civil servants, 36.5% of the businesspersons, and
35.5% of the public (Partnership for Governance
Reform in Indonesia
2001
, p. 39). Similarly, the
low salaries of political leaders and civil servants
constitute an important cause of corruption in
Mongolia as manifested in the dif
ﬁ
cult living
conditions of judges in the countryside where “one
out of three judges does not have an apartment.
Consequently, some judges live in their of
ﬁ
ce,
which is clearly not desirable and does not enhance
the status of the judiciary” (McPhail
1995
, p. 45).
In his survey of civil service pay in South Asia,
David Chew
(
1992
, p. 78) found that “despite salary
revisions and dearness allowances, starting basic
salaries of the
ﬁ
ve kinds of civil servants in South
Asia remained very low in December 1987 by
international standards.” According to surveys
conducted by Transparency International from
November 2001 to May 2002 in
ﬁ
ve South Asian
countries, the respondents in Pakistan, Nepal, and
Sri Lanka were more likely than their counterparts
in Bangladesh and India to identify the low wages
of employees in the seven sectors as contributing
to corruption (Thampi
2002
, p. 9, 20, 23, 26, 28,
31, 34, 37). Hence, it is not surprising that the
Third Pay Commission (1970–1973) in India
asserted that “the payment of a salary which does
not satisfy the minimum reasonable needs of a
government servant is a direct invitation to corrup-
tion” (Das
2001
, p. 105).

In 2002, Thailand’s police chief, General Sant
Sarutanond, bluntly admitted that Thai policemen
“are undereducated and underpaid and that is the
reason why they are corrupt.” He explained that
the starting monthly salary of commissioned police
of
ﬁ
cers was 6,000 baht (US$153) instead of the
20,000 baht (US$500) needed monthly for meeting
their expenses in a large city (
Straits Times
2002
,
p. A5). In the Philippines, many of the employees
of the Bureau of Immigration were under-quali
ﬁ
ed
(they were hired because of nepotism or political
patronage)
and
paid
“starvation
wages.”
Consequently, they succumbed to bribery because
it was “dif
ﬁ
cult to survive without accepting
bribes” as almost everyone was also doing it (Chua
and Rimban
1998
, p. 154). Many civil servants in
the Philippines supplement their low wages by
vending within the of
ﬁ
ce, holding a second job,
teaching part-time, practicing their profession
after of
ﬁ
ce hours, engaging in research and

consultancy projects, and resorting to petty cor-
rupt practices (Padilla
1995
, pp. 195–202, 206).

Red tape and cumbersome administrative
procedures provide ample opportunities for
corruption. Red tape was an important cause of
corruption in South Korea in the past as
regulation
was usually accompanied by red tape. A com-
pany had to submit 44 documents to apply for
permission to build a factory. Consequently, it
required 3 years to build a factory in South Korea
instead of the two and half months required in
Austin, Texas. Red tape in South Korea resulted
in delay and increased the costs in time and
money for business
ﬁ
rms, which resorted to brib-
ing civil servants to reduce delay by expediting
their applications for permits or licences (Kim

1997
, p. 261–262).

South Korea’s experience has shown that it is
possible to reduce the opportunities for corrup-
tion by cutting red tape. In 1998, President Kim
Dae-Jung established the Regulatory Reform
Committee (RRC) to make South Korea more
business friendly by eliminating unnecessary or
irrational regulations which hindered business
activities or interfered in people’s lives. After its

ﬁ
rst year of operations, the RRC succeeded in

eliminating 5,226 or 48% of the 11,115

administrative regulations (Cho
1999
, p. 3). In
addition to the RRC’s efforts, the Seoul
Metropolitan Government launched an Online
Procedure Enhancement for Civil Applications
(OPEN) system in April 1999 to improve civil
applications covering 54 common procedures by

ﬁ
ling through the Internet. The OPEN system has
enhanced the transparency of civil procedures
and reduced the opportunities for corruption
(Moon
2001
, p. 41).

The best way to illustrate the linkage between
red tape and corruption is to show that those
Asian countries which are not af
ﬂ
icted by red
tape as re
ﬂ
ected in the ease in doing business are
seen to be less corrupt than those countries which
suffer from cumbersome administrative regula-
tions and procedures. Table
3.7 shows that the
level of perceived corruption in Singapore, Hong
Kong, and Japan, where it is easier to do busi-
ness, is much lower than in India, Philippines,
and Cambodia, where it is much more dif
ﬁ
cult to
conduct business because of the greater amount
of red tape. For example, in Cambodia, which is

3 Curbing Corruption and Enhancing Trust in Government: Some Lessons from Singapore and Hong Kong
ranked 154th on the 2010 CPI with a score of 2.1,
it takes 85 days to start a business, 709 days to
deal with construction permits, and 56 days to
register a property (World Bank
2010
, p. 153).


Thirdly, corruption thrives in those Asia-Paci
ﬁ
c
countries where the public perceives it to be a
“low risk, high reward” activity as corrupt offend-
ers are unlikely to be detected and punished (


Quah

2003a
, p. 13). According to Palmier, corruption in
Indonesia was rampant because it was tolerated as
corrupt of
ﬁ
cials were seldom punished. He con-
cluded that while there was strong policing against
corruption in Hong Kong, “policing is very poor
in Indonesia, and insuf
ﬁ
cient in India” (Palmier

1985
, p. 280). Mohammad Mohabbat Khan
(
1998
,
p. 36) has attributed the high level of corruption in
Bangladesh to the low probability of punishment
for corrupt of
ﬁ
cials who are seldom dismissed
from the civil service. Similarly, a comparative
study of Bangladesh, India, and Sri Lanka found
that “of
ﬁ
cial punitive action has seldom been
taken against corrupt of
ﬁ
cials” in spite of the large
number of corruption reports (Ahmad and
Brookins
2004
, p. 29). More speci
ﬁ
cally, Ahmad
and Brookins
(

2004
, p. 24) found that only 15%
of the 119 corruption cases in India resulted in
of
ﬁ
cial punitive action, followed by 10% of the 77
corruption cases in Bangladesh, and 4% of the 91
corruption cases in Sri Lanka.

In contrast, corruption is not a serious prob-
lem in those Asian countries where corruption is
viewed as a “high risk, low reward” activity as
corrupt offenders are likely to be caught and
severely punished. In Singapore, the penalty for
corruption is imprisonment for 5 years and/or
a
ﬁ
ne of S$100,000 (US$81,673 on May 1, 2011).
This penalty is impartially enforced on those
found guilty of corruption in Singapore regard-
less of their position or status in society (Quah

2007a
, p. 20, 37). The anti-corruption laws are
applied “strictly and consistently” in Singapore,
and high-ranking corrupt of
ﬁ
cials are “dealt with
in Singapore with a severity rarely seen else-
where” (
Straits Times
1996
, p. 3). A comparative
study by Robert P. Beschel Jr.
(
1999
, p. 8) of the
successful prosecution of corrupt offenders in
Hong Kong and the Philippines in 1997 con
ﬁ
rms
the critical role played by punishment in curbing
corruption as he found that a person committing
a corrupt offence in Hong Kong was 35 times
more likely to be detected and punished than his
Filipino counterpart.

In short, corruption is a serious problem in
many Asian countries today because of the com-
bined impact of the low salaries of civil servants
and political leaders, the ample opportunities cre-
ated for corruption by red tape, and the low prob-
ability of detecting and punishing corrupt
offenders. Indeed, the inability of most of these
countries to curb corruption effectively re
ﬂ
ects
the lack of political will of their governments to
enforce impartially the anti-corruption measures
as the “big
ﬁ
sh” (rich and powerful) are usually
protected from prosecution for their corrupt mis-
deeds. This lack of political will is the most
important reason for the rampant corruption in
Asian countries.

In addition to the impartial enforcement of the
anti-corruption laws by the anti-corruption
agency, there are two other indicators of a gov-
ernment’s political will in curbing corruption.
First, there must be comprehensive anti-corrup-
tion legislation to prevent loopholes and periodic
review of such legislation to introduce amend-
ments whenever necessary. A glaring example of
lack of political will in
ﬁ
ghting corruption is the
15-year delay in passing the draft Anti-Corruption
Law in Cambodia. This bill, which was originally
introduced in 1994, was not enacted by the gov-
ernment’s of
ﬁ
cial deadline of June 2006
(MacLean
2006
, p. 17; Ford and Seng
2007
, p.
186). On May 16, 2006, a petition with more than
one million signatures and thumbprints was pre-
sented to the Cambodian National Assembly
requesting its members to urgently enact an anti-
corruption law. However, this plea fell on deaf
ears as Lao Mong Hay
(
2008
) lamented that
“deadlines set for the enactment of that law have
repeatedly passed and the
ﬁ
nal draft has not yet
seen the light of day.” In October 2006, Prime
Minister Hun Sen justi
ﬁ
ed the delay in terms of
his government’s intention that the law should
“be as close to perfect as possible, with workable
implementation guidelines” drafted on the basis
of new penal codes (
Brunei Times
2006
)
. This
delay in enacting the Anti-Corruption Law


32
J.S.T. Quah
after 15 years clearly re
ﬂ
ects the Cambodian

government’s lack of political will in curbing
corruption (Quah
2007b
, p. 7). Hence, it is not
surprising that, as indicated earlier, corruption is
rampant in Cambodia.

The second indicator of a government’s political
will is its provision of adequate legal powers,
personnel and budget to enable the anti-corruption
agency to perform its functions effectively.
Table
3.8 provides comparative data on the
budgets and personnel of nine anti-corruption
agencies in Asia as well as their staff–population
ratios and per capita expenditures. Among the
nine anti-corruption agencies, Hong Kong’s
Independent Commission Against Corruption
(ICAC) fares best with a staff–population ratio of
1:5,780 and a per capita expenditure of US$13.40.
Singapore’s Corrupt Practices Investigation
Bureau (CPIB) is ranked second, with a per
capita expenditure of US$2.32 and fourth with a
staff–population ratio of 1:56,163.


On the other hand, the other seven anti-corrup-
tion agencies are poorly funded and staffed, with
Indonesia’s
Komisi Pemberantasaan
Korupsi
(KPK) having the highest staff–population ratio
of 1:433,888 and the second lowest per capita
expenditure of US$0.14. The Central Bureau of
Investigation (CBI) in India has the lowest per
capita expenditure of US$0.04 and the second
highest staff–population ratio of 1:243,373.
South Korea’s Anti-Corruption and Civil Rights
Commission (ACRC) is third with a per capita
expenditure of US$1.26 but ranks seventh with a
staff–population ratio of 1:103,863. Mongolia’s
Independent Authority Against Corruption (IAAC)
is ranked fourth with a per capita expenditure of
US$1.15 and third with a staff–population ratio
of 1:30,000. The National Anti-Corruption
Commission (NACC) in Thailand ranks
ﬁ
fth with
a per capita expenditure of US$0.33 and a staff-
population ratio of 1: 86,892. The Of
ﬁ
ce of the
Ombudsman (OMB) in the Philippines is also
poorly funded with a per capita expenditure of
US$0.22, and under-staffed with an unfavorable
staff-population ratio of 1:89,076. Finally, Taiwan’s
Ministry of Justice Investigation Bureau (MJIB)
ranks seventh with a per capita expenditure of
US$0.18, but it has the second most favorable
staff–population ratio of 1:27,262.

The comparative analysis in Table
3.8 shows
that the political leaders in South Korea,
Mongolia, Thailand, the Philippines, Taiwan,
Indonesia, and India must demonstrate their
political will in curbing corruption by increasing

3 Curbing Corruption and Enhancing Trust in Government: Some Lessons from Singapore and Hong Kong
substantially the legal powers, personnel, and
budgets of their anti-corruption agencies. For
example, the Korea Independent Commission
Against Corruption (KICAC) was not a full-
ﬂ
edged
anti-corruption agency when it was established in
January 2002 as it did not perform the major
function required of an anti-corruption agency
namely, investigating corruption offences, and its
scope was restricted to dealing with public sector
corruption only (Quah
2010
, pp. 37–38). On
February 29, 2008, the KICAC was merged with
the Ombudsman and the Administrative Appeals
Commission to form the ACRC. However, like
the KICAC, the ACRC does not have the power
to investigate corruption cases. The South Korean
political leaders must remove these two serious
obstacles to the ACRC’s effective performance if
they are committed to curbing corruption in their
country.

Similarly, instead of strengthening the KPK,
Indonesian President Susilo Bambang Yudhoyono
had unwittingly undermined its effectiveness in
May 2005 when he formed an anti-corruption
taskforce of prosecutors, police, and auditors to
compete with the KPK (Quah
2006
, pp. 178–179).
The con
ﬂ
ict and competition between the KPK
and the police and the Attorney-General’s Of
ﬁ
ce
(AGO) erupted recently in the arrest of two senior
KPK of
ﬁ
cials by the police allegedly for bribery.
The arrest of these of
ﬁ
cials in the wake of the
arrest of the KPK Chairman for murder is widely
viewed as “an apparent high-level conspiracy” by
the police and AGO to weaken the KPK (Osman

2009
, p. A9).

3.5
Public Trust and Distrust
of Politicians

In their analysis of distrust in South Korea, Jun
and Kim
(
2002
, p. 2) de
ﬁ
ne trust in terms of a
person’s reliance on another person, namely “a
person is considered reliable when the truster is
completely assured that the trustee will not fail to
meet the expectation of the truster in need.” If
trust is de
ﬁ
ned as “an attitude of optimism about
the goodwill and con
ﬁ
dence of another person,”
citizens are likely to trust civil servants who per-
form their duties effectively and to judge the gov-
ernment as trustworthy. Furthermore, Jun and
Kim distinguish between trust in interpersonal
relations and trust in institutions. Trust in
interpersonal relations is assessed “through the
amount of interpersonal competence that people
assign others in their current roles” (Jun and Kim

2002
, pp. 3–4).

On the other hand, it is dif
ﬁ
cult to apply trust in
interpersonal relations at the institutional level
because “as long as people engage in instrumental
interactions involving technical–functional work
relationships and rational exchanges to gain orga-
nizational and personal interest, trust will be
dif
ﬁ
cult to develop.” It is dif
ﬁ
cult to build and sus-
tain trust in the structural relationships in institu-
tions because of the role ambiguity of the actors
and institutions involved and the nature of their
interactions “which tend to be political, instru-
mental-rational, and restricted exchange, if not
super
ﬁ
cial, in many situations.” A third dif
ﬁ
culty
is that there are many factors in
ﬂ
uencing the level
of trust and solidarity at the institutional level
including the individuals’ “sense of organizational
obligation and loyalty, commitment, shared inter-
est, pride, roles, and the necessity for survival,
growth, or change” (Jun and Kim
2002
, p. 4–5).
Fourth, it is also dif
ﬁ
cult to sustain the expecta-
tions of organizational members for a long time.

Finally, it is implausible to expect citizens to
trust government institutions because they are
“highly unlikely to know the many people work-
ing in those institutions.” Indeed, trust in institu-
tions depends on whether civil servants perform
their roles responsibly and on behalf of the pub-
lic. However, few citizens are aware of the com-
plex structures and functions of government to
assess the performance of civil servants (Jun and
Kim
2002
, p. 5). Accordingly, citizens evaluate
institutions on the basis of their past role perfor-
mance and the trustworthiness of their staff.
Consequently, their level of trust in civil servants
and government is enhanced if they perform
effectively as expected. On the other hand, the
level of distrust by citizens in their government
and civil servants increases if they fail to meet
their expectations. Opposition political leaders
can feed the citizens’ distrust of the incumbent
government by reminding them of “past broken
promises” (Levi
1998
, p. 86).


34
J.S.T. Quah

According to Margaret Levi
(
1998
, pp. 85–86),
the state creates interpersonal trust among citi-
zens by having the “capacity to monitor laws,
bring sanctions against lawbreakers, and provide
information and guarantees about those seeking
to be trusted.” However, if they are doubtful about
“the state’s commitment to enforce the laws and
if its information and guarantees are not credible,
then the state’s capacity to generate interpersonal
trust will diminish.” Government institutions can
build trust by creating “bureaucratic arrange-
ments that reward competence and relative hon-
esty by bureaucratic agents” because:

A competent and relatively honest bureaucracy not
only reduces the incentives for corruption and
inef
ﬁ
cient rent-seeking but also increases the prob-
ability of cooperation and compliance … and of
economic growth. … To the extent that citizens
and groups recognize that bureaucrats gain reputa-
tional bene
ﬁ
ts from competence and honesty, those
regulated will expect bureaucrats to be trustworthy
and will act accordingly (Levi
1998
, p. 87).

The trust of the state in
ﬂ
uences the “level of
citizens’ tolerance of the regime and their degree
of compliance with governmental demands and
regulations.” Thus, citizens distrust their govern-
ment if it breaks its promises, is incompetent, and
antagonistic toward them. On the other hand,
they will trust government if they believe that “it
will act in their interests, that its procedures are
fair, and that their trust of the state and of others
is reciprocated” (Levi
1998
, pp. 87–88). In short,
a government is considered to be trustworthy if it
has procedures for policy formulation and imple-
mentation that are fair and if it makes credible
commitments. In other words, the citizens in a
country will trust their government if it is effec-
tive and delivers the goods. Conversely, they will
distrust an ineffective government that fails to
deliver the goods.

3.6
Government Effectiveness
in Asian Countries

Table
3.9 shows that of the 26 Asian countries,
15 countries had registered a decline in govern-
ment effectiveness between 1996 and 2009,
with Mongolia showing the highest decrease of
22.7 percentile rank, followed by North Korea
(18.9 percentile rank), Nepal (14.9 percentile
rank), Indonesia (14.5 percentile rank), and
Timor-Leste (13.8 percentile rank). Among the
11 countries which have increased their govern-
ment effectiveness, the top
ﬁ
ve countries are
Macao SAR, Cambodia, Sri Lanka, Hong Kong
SAR, and South Korea. However, in 2009, there
are only eight countries with government effec-
tiveness exceeding the 70 percentile rank,
namely, Singapore, Hong Kong SAR, Japan,
Macao SAR, South Korea, Taiwan, Malaysia,
and Brunei.

3 Curbing Corruption and Enhancing Trust in Government: Some Lessons from Singapore and Hong Kong

A second indicator of government
effectiveness
is provided by the
Global Competitiveness

Reports’ data on the competence of public
of
ﬁ
cials from 1999 to 2002–2003. Tables
3.10
and
3.11 show that the public of
ﬁ
cials in
Singapore are the most competent, followed by
those in Japan, Hong Kong SAR, China, Vietnam,
Sri Lanka, Taiwan, India, South Korea, Thailand,
Malaysia, Indonesia, Bangladesh, and the
Philippines.


Thirdly, a 2009 survey of 12 Asian countries
conducted by the Hong Kong-based Political
Economic Risk Consultancy (PERC) found that
the bureaucracy in Singapore was the most effec-
tive, followed by the bureaucracy in Hong Kong
SAR. At the other extreme, the least effective
bureaucracies were those in the Philippines,
Indonesia, and India in descending order (see
Table
3.12
). Thus, it is not surprising that the lev-
els of government effectiveness in Singapore and
Hong Kong are higher than those of India,
Indonesia, and Philippines because their civil ser-
vices are more effective than their Indian,
Indonesian, and Filipino counterparts.


In sum, the three indicators of government
effectiveness by the World Bank, the
Global
Competitiveness
Report
, and PERC con
ﬁ
rm that
Singapore and Hong Kong have the most effective
governments and civil services. As such, it is not
surprising that the citizens in both countries
have demonstrated a higher level of trust in their

Learning from Singapore’s and
Hong Kong’s Experiences

What can the other Asian countries learn from
the experiences of Singapore and Hong Kong
SAR in curbing corruption and enhancing the
citizens’ trust in their governments? As the major
factor responsible for the high level of public
trust of politicians in Singapore and Hong Kong
is the effectiveness of their governments, it is
necessary to identify the reasons for their effec-
tiveness. In other words, the government must be
effective in order for it to gain the public’s trust.
How did Singapore and Hong Kong ensure the
effectiveness of their governments?

3.7.1
Favorable Policy Context

The
ﬁ
rst reason for the high level of government
effectiveness in Singapore and Hong Kong is
their favorable policy contexts. Table
3.13 shows
that both countries are city-states with small
populations, high GDP per capita, no housing
shortage, high government expenditure on
education, low level of corruption, and high
degree of political stability. Their favorable pol-
icy contexts have enabled the governments and
their civil services to implement various public
policies effectively. Thus, compared to other
larger Asian countries with bigger populations
and rural hinterlands, the “absence of a rural hin-
terland” in Hong Kong and Singapore has con-
tributed to their rapid growth which has not been
hindered by their insigni
ﬁ
cant agricultural sec-
tors (Streeten
1993
, p. 199).


3.7.2
Importance of Meritocracy

The second reason for the high level of govern-
ment effectiveness in Singapore and Hong Kong
is the high quality of their civil services as
re
ﬂ
ected in their superior ranking on the World
Bank’s governance indicator on government
effectiveness,
the

Global
Competitiveness

Reports’ indicator on competence of public
of
ﬁ
cials, and PERC’s evaluation of Asian bureau-
cracies. As former British colonies, both
Singapore and Hong Kong have continued the
tradition of meritocracy introduced by the British
by retaining and relying on the Public Service
Commission (PSC) to ensure that recruitment
and promotion to their civil services are based on


37
3 Curbing Corruption and Enhancing Trust in Government: Some Lessons from Singapore and Hong Kong
merit and not patronage. According to A.P. Sinker

(
1953
, p. 211), a PSC has two functions: “to
eliminate patronage in all its forms” and “to
ﬁ
nd
the best men available and put them in.” The PSC
was established in Hong Kong in 1950 to advise
the Governor and the Chief Executive after July
1997 on civil service appointments, promotion,
and discipline “to ensure that selection processes
are ‘fair, meticulous, and thorough’” (Burns

2004
, p. 85). Similarly, the PSC was created in
Singapore in January 1951 to keep politics out of
the Singapore Civil Service (SCS) and to acceler-
ate its pace of localization (Quah
1982
, p. 50).

Unlike Singapore and Hong Kong, the tradi-
tion of meritocracy has not been maintained by
other former British colonies. For example, the
PSC in Bangladesh has abandoned meritocracy
because it is “riddled with massive corruption.”
Former PSC members in Bangladesh revealed
that “bribes worth Tk 50 lakhs change hands
daily at the commission, to determine recruit-
ment,
promotions,
and
other
decisions.
Question papers for the civil service examina-
tions are sold to candidates for Tk 5 lakhs.
Promotions are sold for Tk 5–10 lakhs, and
corruption cases against civil servants, which
are vetted by the PSC, are dropped for sums of
Tk 2 crore during the 5 years (Shahan
2007
,
p. 27). Instead of maintaining meritocracy, the
PSC in Bangladesh has been “considerably
used as a body for the partisan appointment of
Chairman and Members, and for [the] recruitment
[of] pro-ruling party activists and supporters
for the civil service since 1972” (Karim
2007
,
p. 43).

The importance of meritocracy in ensuring the
effectiveness of a civil service is clearly illus-
trated in Indonesia, where there is no tradition of
meritocracy because it was colonized by the
Dutch from 1602 to 1942. Unlike the British, the
Dutch did not rely on merit to recruit the local
civil servants, who were appointed by hereditary
succession. The lack of meritocracy was further
reinforced during the Japanese Occupation as
“many of the new heads of the bureaucracies had
achieved their high position in the colonial days
because they were loyal to the colonial govern-
ment” (Hadisumarto
1974
, p. 161). After inde-
pendence, the appointment of senior civil servants
was not based on merit but on their personal
background, especially whether they had partici-
pated in the 1945 revolution against the Dutch
(Hadisumarto
1974
, p. 164).

During Sukarno’s regime, “the principles of
merit system in hiring, promoting, and
ﬁ
ring of
personnel were completely disregarded, while
political and ascriptive considerations became
criteria for appointment to key positions in the
bureaucracy” (Siagian
1970
, p. 100). Similarly,
President Suharto by-passed the established
mechanisms for evaluating senior military of
ﬁ
cers
and promoted those politically ambitious of
ﬁ
cers
who had built a good relationship with him and
his family. Indeed, the selection process was
designed to produce of
ﬁ
cers who were loyal to
President Suharto (Kristiadi
2001
, p. 102).

In short, the lack of a meritocratic tradition in
Indonesia’s civil service is re
ﬂ
ected in the impor-
tance of patronage on the one hand, and the
neglect of merit on the other hand in the recruit-
ment and promotion of its civil servants. More
importantly, the absence or lack of importance
attached to meritocracy in the Indonesian civil
service has not only undermined its effectiveness
but also increased its vulnerability to corruption.

3.7.3
Attracting and Retaining the
“Best and Brightest”

To attract and retain the “best and brightest” citi-
zens into their civil services, the governments in
Singapore and Hong Kong have relied on com-
petitive salaries to minimize the brain drain of tal-
ented civil servants to the private sector. The high
salaries of Hong Kong’s civil servants is a legacy
of its 156 years of British colonial rule which pro-
vided “generous perks and bene
ﬁ
ts” for the top
civil servants but not the legislators to attract
expatriate of
ﬁ
cers to work in Hong Kong. Their
generous pay package includes “housing, chauf-
feur-driven limousines for personal use, passages,
local and overseas education allowances.” The
high salaries that were institutionalized during
colonial rule were continued after Hong Kong
became a Special Administrative Region of China
on July 1, 1997. An Independent Commission on
Remuneration for Members of the Executive
Council and the Legislature of the HKSAR was
established to review and give advice on the pay
of civil servants and legislative councilors. The
of
ﬁ
cial guiding principle for civil service pay is
that it is “set at a level which is suf
ﬁ
cient to attract,
retain, and motivate staff of a suitable calibre to
provide the public with an effective and ef
ﬁ
cient
service, and such remuneration should be regarded
as fair by both civil servants and the public which
they serve.” As Hong Kong’s per capita GDP
increased by more than two times during 1980
and 2000, the adoption of “the market principle of
broad comparability with the private sector”
resulted in a tenfold increase in the pay of Hong
Kong’s top political executive from 1976 to 2001
(Lee
2003
, pp. 130, 138, 141).

In Singapore, the expatriate civil servants also
received much higher salaries and more allow-
ances than their local counterparts. This discrimi-
nation against local civil servants in the British
colonies was justi
ﬁ
ed by the Public Services
Salaries Commission of 1919 (Seah
1971
, p. 15).
When the People’s Action Party (PAP) govern-
ment assumed of
ﬁ
ce in June 1959 after winning
the May 30, 1959 general election, it “found the
national coffers seriously depleted” (Bogaars

1973
, p. 80). Accordingly, a Cabinet Budget
Committee on Expenditure was formed and it
recommended the abolition of the 35% of the
variable allowance (VA) for Division I of
ﬁ
cers, a
10% reduction of the VA for Division II of
ﬁ
cers,
and a 5% cut in the VA for Division III of
ﬁ
cers.
The government implemented this recommenda-
tion which resulted in saving S$10 million. The
VAs of the senior civil servants were restored by
the government in 1961 when the budgetary situ-
ation improved. In 1968, a report on public sector
salaries recommended pay rises of more than
25% for most civil servants. However, the gov-
ernment did not accept this recommendation
because it could not afford to so (Quah
2003b
,
pp. 147–148). Former Prime Minister Lee Kuan
Yew
(
2000
, pp. 194–195) wrote in his memoirs
that after independence, he “had frozen ministe-
rial salaries and kept public wage increases at a
low level to be sure that we would cope with the
expected unemployment and slowdown in the
economy and to set an example of restraint.”

Singapore’s rapid economic growth during the
1970s resulted in higher salaries in the private sec-
tor. To curb the brain drain from the SCS to the
private sector, the National Wages Council recom-
mended the payment of an Annual Wage
Supplement (AWS) or the “13th month pay” in
March 1972 to reduce the wage gap in the public
and private sectors. Public sector salaries were fur-
ther increased in 1973 and in 1979. In 1981, the
Research and Statistics Unit of the Inland Revenue
Department conducted a survey on the employ-
ment and earnings of 30,197 graduates, or 81.5%
of the working graduate population enumerated in
the 1980 population census (Quah
1984
, p. 296).
The survey found that graduates in the private sec-
tor earned, on the average, 42% more than those in


39
3 Curbing Corruption and Enhancing Trust in Government: Some Lessons from Singapore and Hong Kong
the public sector (
Sunday Times
1982a
, p. 1). The
PSC revealed that from 1978 to 1981, eight super-
scale and 67 timescale administrative of
ﬁ
cers had
resigned from the SCS for more lucrative jobs in
the private sector (
Sunday Times
1982b
, p. 1). To
deal with these problems of wide disparity in pay
between graduates in the public and private sec-
tors, and the serious brain drain of talented senior
civil servants from the SCS to the private sector,
the government further revised the salaries of the
administrative of
ﬁ
cers in April 1982 (Quah
1984
,
p. 297).

In March 1989, the Minister for Trade and
Industry, Lee Hsien Loong, recommended a hefty
salary increase for the SCS because the compara-
tively low salaries and slow advancement in the
Administrative Service had contributed to its low
recruitment and high resignation rates (Quah

2003b
, p. 150). Similarly, in December 1993, he
announced that the salaries of ministers and
senior civil servants would be increased from
January 1994 to keep pace with the private sector
and to compensate for the reduction in their med-
ical bene
ﬁ
ts (
Straits Times
1993
, p. 1). In October
1994, a White Paper on
Competitive Salaries
for
Competent
and Honest
Government was pre-
sented to Parliament to justify the pegging of the
salaries of ministers and senior civil servants to
the average salaries of the top four earners in six
private sector professions: accounting, banking,
engineering, law, local manufacturing compa-
nies, and multinational corporations. The White
Paper recommended the introduction of formal
salary benchmarks for ministers and senior civil
servants, additional salary grades for political
appointments, and annual salary reviews for the
SCS. The adoption of the long-term formula sug-
gested in the White Paper removed the need to
justify the salaries of ministers and senior civil
servants “from scratch with each salary revision”
(Republic of Singapore
1994
, pp. 12–13, 18).

3.7.4
Effective Control of Corruption

Tables
3.1 and
3.2 show that Singapore and
Hong Kong are perceived to be the least cor-
rupt Asian countries according to Transparency
International’s 2010 CPI and the World Bank’s

2009 Control of Corruption governance indicator.
How did Singapore and Hong Kong succeed in
curbing corruption effectively?

3.7.4.1
Creation of an Independent
Anti-Corruption Agency

The British colonial government enacted the
Prevention of Corruption Ordinance (POCO) in
Singapore in December 1937 and created the
Anti-Corruption Branch (ACB) within the Criminal
Investigation Department (CID) of the Singapore
Police Force (SPF) to curb corruption (Quah

2007a
, p. 14). This decision to make the ACB
responsible for corruption control is dif
ﬁ
cult to
understand especially when the existence of ram-
pant police corruption in Singapore was docu-
mented by the 1879 and 1886 Commissions of
Inquiry (Quah
1979
, pp. 24–27). Not surpris-
ingly, the ACB was ineffective in curbing corrup-
tion for three reasons. First, the ACB was
under-staffed as it had only 17 personnel to per-
form 16 duties including corruption control.
Second, it had to compete with other branches of
the CID for limited manpower and resources as
corruption control was accorded lower priority
than the investigation of serious crimes like mur-
der and kidnapping. The third and most impor-
tant reason for the ACB’s ineffectiveness was the
prevalence of police corruption which made it
dif
ﬁ
cult for the ACB staff to enforce the POCO
impartially toward their colleagues (Quah
2007a
,
pp. 14–15).

The folly of the British colonial government’s
decision to make the ACB responsible for
corruption
control was revealed when three police detectives
were implicated in the robbery of 1,800 pounds of
opium worth about S$400,000 (US$133,330). The
involvement of these detectives and some senior
police of
ﬁ
cers in the Opium Hijacking Scandal in
October 1951 made the British colonial government
realize the importance of setting up an anti-
corruption agency that is outside the SPF’s jurisdic-
tion (Tan
1999
, p. 59). Consequently, the Corrupt
Practices Investigation Bureau (CPIB) was formed
a year later in October 1952.

Similarly, in Hong Kong, the ACB of the CID
of the Royal Hong Kong Police Force (RHKPF)


40
J.S.T. Quah
was also responsible for combating corruption
from 1948 until 1971, when the ACB was
upgraded to the Anti-Corruption Of
ﬁ
ce (ACO),
which was also ineffective in curbing the ram-
pant police corruption. The escape of a corrup-
tion suspect, Chief Superintendent Peter F.
Godber, on June 8, 1973, to the United Kingdom
angered the public and undermined the ACO’s
credibility. Consequently, the Governor, Sir
Murray MacLehose, was compelled by public
criticism to accept the Commission of Inquiry’s
recommendation to establish an independent
agency, separate from the RHKPF, to
ﬁ
ght
corruption.
Accordingly,
the
Independent
Commission Against Corruption (ICAC) was
formed on February 15, 1974 (Quah
2003a,

pp. 137–139).

Thus, Singapore’s and Hong Kong’s success
in minimizing corruption can be attributed to
their rejection of the British colonial method of
relying on the police to curb corruption and
their reliance instead on independent anti-cor-
ruption agencies like the CPIB and ICAC.
It should be noted that Singapore has taken 15
years (1937–1952) and Hong Kong has taken
26 years (1948–1974) to learn this important
lesson (Quah
2004
, pp. 1–2). However, India
still relies on the Central Bureau of Investigation
(CBI) to curb corruption even though there is
extensive police corruption and the CBI is part
of the police (Quah
2008
, p. 253).

A regional survey of anti-corruption agencies
in Asian countries shows that those countries
which have adopted a single anti-corruption
agency are more effective than their counterparts
which have relied on multiple anti-corruption
agencies if their governments are committed to
combating corruption (Quah
2007b
, pp. 4–6).
Table
3.8 shows that Hong Kong’s ICAC and
Singapore’s CPIB were among the best funded
and staffed anti-corruption agencies.

3.7.4.2
Comprehensive Anti-corruption
Legislation

A second prerequisite of an effective anti-corruption
strategy is comprehensive anti-corruption legis-
lation, which de
ﬁ
nes explicitly the meaning and
forms of corruption, and speci
ﬁ
es clearly the
powers of the anti-corruption agency responsible
for its implementation.

The Misdemeanours Punishment Ordinance
(MPO) was the
ﬁ
rst local law enacted against
corruption in Hong Kong in 1898. The MPO
increased the maximum penalty for corruption to
2 years’ imprisonment and/or a
ﬁ
ne not exceed-
ing HK$500. The Prevention of Corruption
Ordinance (POCO), which was enacted in 1948,
provided a more comprehensive de
ﬁ
nition of cor-
ruption, and increased the maximum penalty for
corruption to 5 years imprisonment and a
ﬁ
ne of
HK$10,000. The inadequate powers conferred by
the POCO and its other limitations led to its
review in 1968 and its replacement by the
Prevention of Bribery Ordinance (POBO), which
was enacted on May 15, 1971 (Kuan
1981
, pp.
16–18, 23, 29).

The POBO had three signi
ﬁ
cant features. First,
it enabled the government to prosecute a civil ser-
vant for corruption if he could not provide a sat-
isfactory explanation for maintaining a standard
of living or controlling excessive pecuniary
resources that were not commensurate with his
present or past of
ﬁ
cial salaries (Kuan
1981
, p.
32). Second, the POBO provided extensive pow-
ers of investigation as the Attorney-General could
authorize the inspection of bank accounts, safe-
deposit boxes, books, documents, or articles. He
could also require the suspect or any other per-
sons to submit information, and authorize the
entry into and search of any premises. Third, the
POBO introduced severe maximum penalties:
the general maximum penalty was a
ﬁ
ne of
HK$50,000 and 3 years’ imprisonment, or on
indictment, a
ﬁ
ne of HK$100,000 and 7 years’
imprisonment. The duration of imprisonment
was increased to 10 years for offences involving
contracts and tenders. The immediate conse-
quence of Peter Godber’s escape in June 1973 to
Britain was the amendment of the POBO to
remove the safeguards in the interests of the sus-
pect, and to require a suspect to surrender all his
travel documents (Kuan
1981
, pp. 38–39).

The ICAC was established on February 15,
1974 with the enactment of the ICAC Ordinance,
which entrusted it with the tasks of rooting out
corruption and restoring public con
ﬁ
dence in the


41
3 Curbing Corruption and Enhancing Trust in Government: Some Lessons from Singapore and Hong Kong
government. Apart from specifying the Comm-
issioner’s duties in section 12, the ICAC
Ordinance also indicates the ICAC’s powers. For
example, the ICAC Ordinance empowers the
Director of the Operations Department to autho-
rize his of
ﬁ
cers to restrict the movement of a sus-
pect, to examine bank accounts and safe-deposit
boxes, to restrict disposal of a suspect’s property,
and to require a suspect to provide full details of
his
ﬁ
nancial situation. These of
ﬁ
cers can also
arrest without warrant for the offences indicated
in ICAC Ordinance and the POBO, and they can
search premises and seize and detain any evi-
dence for such offences (Kuan
1981
, p. 40).

In Singapore, corruption was made illegal in
1871 with the enactment of the Penal Code of the
Straits Settlements. As indicated earlier, the POCO
was enacted in December 1937 as Singapore’s

ﬁ
rst anti-corruption law. However, the ACB’s inef-
fectiveness and the involvement of police of
ﬁ
cers
in the Opium Hijacking Scandal of October 1951
led to the formation of the CPIB in October 1952.
The PAP government assumed of
ﬁ
ce in June 1959
and demonstrated its commitment to curbing cor-
ruption by enacting the Prevention of Corruption
Act (POCA) on June 17, 1960. The POCA had

ﬁ
ve important features which removed the POCO’s
weaknesses and gave the CPIB additional powers
for performing its duties. First, the POCA’s scope
was broader, as it had 32 sections in contrast to the
12 sections of the POCO. Second, corruption was
explicitly de
ﬁ
ned in terms of the various forms of
“grati
ﬁ
cation” in section 2, which also identi
ﬁ
ed
for the
ﬁ
rst time, the CPIB and its Director. Third,
to increase the deterrent effect of the POCA, the
penalty for corruption was raised to imprisonment
for 5 years and/or a
ﬁ
ne of S$10,000 (section 5).
Fourth, a person found guilty of accepting an ille-
gal grati
ﬁ
cation had to pay the amount he had
taken as a bribe in addition to any other pun-
ishment imposed by a court (section 3) (Quah

1995a
, p. 395).

The
ﬁ
fth and most important feature of the
POCA was that it gave the CPIB more powers
and a new lease of life. For example, section 15
gave CPIB of
ﬁ
cers powers of arrest and search of
arrested persons. Section 17 empowered the
Public Prosecutor to authorize the CPIB Director
and his senior of
ﬁ
cers to investigate “any bank
account, share account, or purchase account” of
any person suspected of having committed an
offence against the POCA. Section 18 enabled
the CPIB of
ﬁ
cers to inspect a civil servant’s
banker’s book and those of his wife, child, or
agent, if necessary (Quah
1995a
, p. 395).

No matter how comprehensive the
anti-corr-
uption legislation in a country is, it must be
reviewed periodically to remove loopholes or
deal with unanticipated problems by introducing
amendments or, if necessary, new legislation
(Quah
2004
, p. 2). For example, in 1966, the
POCA was amended to ensure that Singaporeans
working for their government in embassies and
other government agencies abroad would be
prosecuted for corrupt offences committed out-
side Singapore and would be dealt with as if such
offences had occurred in Singapore (section 35)
(Quah
1978
, p. 13). In March 1989, the Corruption
(Con
ﬁ
scation of Bene
ﬁ
ts) Act was enacted after
the Teh Cheang Wan corruption scandal of
December 1986 to provide for the con
ﬁ
scation of
bene
ﬁ
ts from the estate of a defendant if he or she
is deceased (Quah
1995a
, p. 396).

3.7.4.3
Reduction of Red Tape

As unnecessary regulations provide opportuni-
ties for corruption, the PAP government has ini-
tiated various measures to reduce these
opportunities in Singapore by cutting red tape.
The Service Improvement Unit (SIU) was
formed in April 1991 to improve the quality of
service in the SCS and statutory boards by
obtaining public feedback on the removal of
unnecessary regulations. From April 1991 to
March 1992, the review of over 200 rules by the
SCS and statutory boards resulted in the
modi
ﬁ
cation or abolition of 96 rules (Quah

1995b
, pp. 339–340). In May 1995, Public
Service for the twenty-
ﬁ
rst Century (PS21) was
introduced to improve the quality of service and
prepare the SCS to welcome and accept change.
As part of PS21, the Cut Waste Panel was formed
in September 2003 “to receive suggestions from
the public on where the government can cut
waste, remove frills, and make savings in the
delivery of public services” (Quah
2007c
, p. 178).


42

The PAP government also relies on e-Government
to enhance transparency and reduce opportuni-
ties for corruption by simplifying the procedures
for obtaining business licences. In 2004, the
On-Line Applications System for Integrated
Services (OASIS) was launched to enable the
public to “apply, renew, or terminate 85 differ-
ent types of licences” online. Similarly, to
reduce the opportunities for corruption and
improve ef
ﬁ
ciency and transparency in procure-
ment, the online procurement portal known as

GeBiz was introduced to enable government
procurement to be done through the internet
(Soh
2008
, p. 7).

In Hong Kong, Lam Bing Chuen
(
2004
: 135)
found that the Housing Authority’s project orga-
nization had more red tape than private project
organizations because of its emphasis on the con-
trol and operating systems. In 1999, the Enhanced
Productivity Programme (EPP) was introduced
to improve productivity through savings in such
baseline expenditure as personal emoluments and
departmental expenses (Scott
2005
, pp. 95–96).
In January 2003, Christopher Cheng, the
Chairman of the Hong Kong General Chamber of
Commerce, called for the civil service to change
by adopting practices from the private sector,
including the review of all government services
to eliminate those regulations that hindered busi-
ness (Cheng
2003
)
. The EPP’s
ﬁ
rst phase was
completed in 2003 and resulted in savings of
HK$5.4 billion or 5.2% of baseline expenditure
(Scott
2005
, p. 96).

In 1998, the Chief Executive launched the
“Digital 21 IT Strategy” to enhance Hong Kong’s
information infrastructure and services. In May
2001, the “2001 Digital 21 Strategy” was intro-
duced to further strengthen Hong Kong’s position
as a leader in the digitally connected world. The
e-Government Programme promoted the adop-
tion of e-Commerce in the private sector by pro-
viding e-options for more services, including
e-procurement and outsourcing (Yong and Leong

2003
, pp. 101–103). To reduce red tape, the gov-
ernment streamlined its own information tech-
nology operations by establishing the Of
ﬁ
ce of
the Government Chief Information Of
ﬁ
cer in
July 2004 (Lam
2006
)
.

Singapore’s and Hong Kong’s efforts to reduce
red tape through the introduction of e-Government
have reaped dividends as both countries have
been ranked among the top
ﬁ
ve economies by the
World Bank for the ease of doing business from
2007 to 2011. Table
3.14 shows that Singapore is
consistently ranked
ﬁ
rst and Hong Kong SAR is
ranked between second and
ﬁ
fth positions among
the 175–183 economies and the 23 Asian econo-
mies included in the World Bank’s
Doing
Business
Surveys
from 2007 to 2011. The ease of
doing business in Singapore and Hong Kong
SAR is a re
ﬂ
ection of the effectiveness of their
governments, the absence of red tape, and their
lower levels of perceived corruption.


3.7.4.4
Punishing the Corrupt Offenders

As discussed earlier, corruption is rampant in
those Asian countries where those committing
corrupt acts are unlikely to be detected or pun-
ished. Consequently, the most effective way to
curb corruption is to punish those found guilty of
corrupt offences. The experiences of Singapore
and Hong Kong demonstrate the importance of
punishing corrupt offenders, regardless of their
status or position, in order to deter others from
being involved in corruption.

In Singapore, the prosecution rate for corruption
cases has increased from 47% in 2000 to 60% in
2002. Similarly, the conviction rate for corruption
cases also rose from 9 to 99% from 2000 to 2002.
Furthermore, during the same period, 680 persons
were charged and 293 public of
ﬁ
cers were disci-
plined for corrupt offences (CPIB
2003
, p. 3.25). In
Hong Kong, the ICAC’s Operations Department
completed 3,364 investigations, and 357 persons
were prosecuted and 54 persons formally cautioned
in 2008. In 2007, the Operations Department
arrested 781 persons, of whom 23 were civil ser-
vants. The number of persons arrested for corrup-
tion and related offences increased to 936 persons,
including 27 public of
ﬁ
cials (ICAC
2009
, p. 39).

Thus, to minimize corruption and to deter
those who are not involved in corrupt practices

from doing so, honesty and incorruptibility
among civil servants and political leaders must
be recognized and rewarded instead of being
punished. The lack of punishment of corrupt
civil servants and political leaders in many
Asian countries sends the wrong signal to their
honest counterparts and the population at large
as it makes a mockery of the anti-corruption
laws and encourages others to become corrupt
as the probability of being caught and punished
is low. In other words, the political systems in
those Asian countries plagued with corruption
reward those who are corrupt, and punish those
who are honest. Accordingly, these countries
must reverse their system of reward and punish-
ment by punishing the corrupt offenders and
rewarding those who have abstained from being
corrupt.

Conclusion

Table

shows that, unlike Singapore and
Hong Kong, the other Asian countries, with
few exceptions, are much larger in land area,
have bigger populations, and lower GDP per
capita. Politically, Singapore has been governed
by the PAP government for more than
ﬁ
ve
decades. The PAP’s substantial majority in
Parliament has enabled it to introduce many
public policies including the White Paper on
pegging the salaries of ministers and senior
civil servants to those of six professions in the
private sector. After 150 years of British colo-
nial rule, Hong Kong became a Special
Administrative Region of China on July 1,
1997. More importantly, the civil service in
Hong Kong has continued to be effective during

the past 13 years. For example, contrary to the
fears of some observers, the ICAC’s effective-
ness has not been adversely affected after July
1997. In 2001, 4 years after the handover, the
ICAC Commissioner, Alan N. Lai
(
2001
, p.
51), declared that Hong Kong’s “credentials as
a champion in
ﬁ
ghting graft have remained as
strong as ever.”


As the policy contexts in the other Asian coun-
tries differ from the favorable policy contexts in
Singapore and Hong Kong, what can the former
learn from the latter? For example, is it possible
for China, which is a Communist state, to learn
from Hong Kong’s and Singapore’s experiences
in curbing corruption? In his answer to this ques-
tion, Anthony Cheung
(

2007
, p. 66) suggests that
“China may not follow exactly the path of Hong
Kong and Singapore, in terms of shifting towards
a
single-ACA
[Anti-Corruption
Agency]
approach” because “its anti-corruption drive will
remain shaped by political factors and institu-
tional constraints.”

3 Curbing Corruption and Enhancing Trust in Government: Some Lessons from Singapore and Hong Kong

In the
ﬁ
nal analysis, whether Singapore’s and
Hong Kong’s effective anti-corruption strategy
can be transferred to other Asian countries
depends on two important factors: the nature of
their policy contexts; and whether their govern-
ments have the political will to implement the
required anti-corruption reforms. Needless to
say, it will be dif
ﬁ
cult for those Asian countries
with less favorable policy contexts to adopt
Singapore-style or Hong Kong-style anti-corrup-
tion reforms if their governments lack the politi-
cal will to do so.

Tables
3.3 and
3.4 show that the level of public
trust of politicians is much higher in Singapore
and Hong Kong than in the other Asian countries,
according to the
Global Competitiveness
Reports
from 1999 to 2009–2010. This high level of pub-
lic trust of politicians in Singapore and Hong
Kong can be attributed not only to their effective
anti-corruption strategies but also to their high
level of government effectiveness. According to
Table
3.9
, Singapore and Hong Kong have the
highest levels of government effectiveness among
the 26 Asian countries included in the World
Bank’s
2009
governance indicator on government
effectiveness. As only 8 Asian countries have a
level of government effectiveness
exceeding the
70 percentile rank, the other 18 Asian countries
have lower levels of government effectiveness,
ranging from 0.5 percentile rank for North Korea
to 64.8 percentile rank for Bhutan.

Drawing from Singapore’s and Hong Kong’s
experiences, those Asian countries can enhance
their citizens’ trust in their governments by
improving their levels of government effective-
ness by adopting meritocracy, paying competitive
salaries to attract and retain the “best and bright-
est” citizens in the civil service, and curbing cor-
ruption effectively. Furthermore, while contextual
differences might prevent other Asian countries
from transplanting Singapore’s or Hong Kong’s
effective strategies to curb corruption and increase
government effectiveness in toto, they can, never-
theless, emulate and adapt some features of these
strategies to suit their own needs, provided that
their political leaders, civil servants, and citizens
are prepared to pay the high economic and politi-
cal costs for introducing these reforms.

Introduction

Information and communications technologies
(ICT) are now part of everyday life and this is
illustrated by the rapid growth of the Internet and
social networks in cyberspace. Whether you are
searching for travel information or buying con-
cert tickets, you can easily perform these func-
tions at any time and in the convenience of your
own home or of
ﬁ
ce. ICT has thus become an
indispensable function of commerce and govern-
ment. With the help of computers and the Internet,
businesses are now able to provide immediate
services to their customers at an unprecedented
level of ef
ﬁ
ciency.

However, the Internet has also become the
proverbial “double-edged sword.” Along with
convenience comes the inconvenience of com-
puter crime. The Internet was originally built for
research and its founding protocols were designed
for in-built redundancy and openness. The rapid
evolution of the computer networks that comprise
the Internet from a government and research
focus to the e-commerce and domestic arena has
provided a gateway for offenders and deviant
entrepreneurs:

The Internet was built for research, not commerce.
Its protocols were open and unsecured; it was not
designed to hide. Data transmitted over this net
could easily be intercepted and stolen; con
ﬁ
dential
data could not easily be protected (Lessig
1999
,
p. 39).

The costs of cybercrime are increasing in scale
and gravity as the “industrialisation” of malicious
software (or crime-ware) proliferates (Ollman

2008
)
. For example, in 2009, the United States
Internet Crime Complaint Centre received
336,655 complaints reporting a total in direct
losses of USD$559.7 million (AFP
2010
)
. Given
this is an estimate based on complaints to just one
Internet crime reporting service in one country,
the real costs of cybercrime world-wide are con-
siderable. In short the rapid expansion of e-com-
merce and the Internet has brought many bene
ﬁ
ts
but also the emergence of various forms of crime
that exploit the strengths and weaknesses of mass
interconnectivity.

The speed, functionality, and accessibility that cre-
ate the enormous bene
ﬁ
ts of the computer age can,
if not properly controlled, allow individuals and
organizations to easily eavesdrop on or interfere
with computer operations from remote locations
for mischievous or malicious purposes, including
fraud or sabotage (United States General
Accounting Of
ﬁ
ce
2010
, p. 3).

As most cybercrimes are transnational in char-
acter, inconsistency of laws and regulations
across country borders makes it especially

dif
ﬁ
cult for countries to cooperate when investi-
gating cross-border cyber crimes. As Katyal

(
2003
, p. 180) observed, many countries will
ﬁ
nd
it increasingly dif
ﬁ
cult to enforce their national
laws against activities which are considered
offensive or harmful to local taste or culture. The
harmonisation of cyber-laws and regulations and
the building of cooperation and comity among
nations are vitally important countermeasures
against cybercrime. The
ﬁ
rst step in that direction
was the Convention on Cybercrime proposed by
the Council of Europe of 2001, which provided a
common legal framework on cybercrime.

4.1.1

Internet Access and the Digital
Divide in Asia

In March 2011, there were an estimated 2.95 bil-
lion Internet users in the world (Miniwatts
Marketing Group
2011
)
. Among all Internet
users, 45% (about 943 million Internet users) are
located in the Asia and Paci
ﬁ
c (i.e. Asia and
Oceania) region. As can be seen in Table
4.1
, the
“digital divide” is aptly shown by the immense
diversity between countries in levels of Internet
participation. China has the most Internet users in
the Asia and Paci
ﬁ
c region and indeed the world
and now exceeds the numbers on-line in North
America. Indeed, almost half of the Internet users
in the Asia and Paci
ﬁ
c region are located in
China. India, now 100 million Internet users, is
second largest and, is followed by Japan, the
Republic of Korea (South Korea) and the
Philippines. Countries like Japan, South Korea,
Taiwan, Singapore, Australia and New Zealand
have over 70% of their total population on-line as
internet users whereas in developing countries
like India, Pakistan, Sri Lanka, Bangladesh and
Nepal engage less than 10% of the population.
The Philippines, Thailand, Vietnam and to a
lesser extent Indonesia have also achieved
signi
ﬁ
cant Internet penetration and are also grow-
ing rapidly. Although China has by far the largest

population of Internet “netizens,” this still com-
prises only 31.8% of the total population and
these are mostly urban users.


Compared with the proportion of Internet
users in 2002, shown in Table
4.1 there has
been a signi
ﬁ
cant increase in all countries in
the Asia and Paci
ﬁ
c region in the past 10 years.
For example, only 3.5% of the Chinese popula-
tion were Internet users in 2002, but this
increased to 36.3% by 2011. There was also a
signi
ﬁ
cant increase in other developing coun-
tries like Vietnam, the Philippines, Pakistan
and India.

Along with the rapid rise of Internet use,
cybercrime has also become prevalent in this
region. However, of all the countries in the
Asia and Paci
ﬁ
c region only Japan has signed
and
rati
ﬁ
ed the Council of Europe Convention
on Cybercrime. The
Convention is the only
multi-lateral instrument for the control of
cybercrime and we discuss it further below.
First we begin with a short introduction to the
problem of cybercrime in Asia and compare
the laws and regulations in Asian states with
the provisions of the Convention. We also con-
sider the challenges faced in developing effec-
tive cross-national policing of cybercrime
in Asia.

4.2

Cybercrime and Its Impact
in Asia

Given the expansion in Internet participation a
drastic rise in cybercrime and information
security problems has occurred in Japan, South
Korea and greater China since 2005, accord-
ing to private information security companies.
For example, Symantec, a provider of com-
puter security software, such as anti-virus
tools, monitors and quanti
ﬁ
es malicious com-
puter activity that occurs on about 133 million
computers that use their services (Symantec

2011

)
. This describes malicious computer
activities such as programs that are used to
disrupt, damage or steal information from
computer systems. These so-called “malware”
or “crime-ware” computer codes usually
include viruses, trojans, worms
1 and botnets
2
(IBM
2009
; Trend Micro
2009
; Wall
2007
)
.
Such crime-ware can also be purchased on-
line from websites and underground forums or
“dark” networks that include instructions on
how to use such software. This enables the
wider use of “attack toolkits” by non-technical
actors, including criminal groups and may
account for the increased prevalence of cyber-
crime. Along with this growth, the malware
itself has evolved to adapt to countermeasures
such as software programs designed to prevent
and detect intrusions. Malware has also been
developed to attack new devices such as smart
phones and other digital devices (Symantec

2011
)
.

Symantec also provides general Asian-
Paci
ﬁ
c-Japan region (APJ) Internet security
reports that have ranked the impact on APJ coun-
tries from all kinds of malicious activities,
including denial of service attacks (DDoS),
botnet infections, phishing, spam and viruses.
Their reports also indicate the origin of the
attacks, such as the source of spam and the top
countries hosting phishing sites.
3 According to
their 2010 APJ report, Symantec found that

1
A worm is a sub-class of a virus. Worms spread from
computer to computer, but unlike a virus, can travel with-
out any help from a person. The danger with a worm is its
ability to replicate itself.

2
A botnet is a network of individual computers infected
with malware. These compromised computers are also
known as zombie computers. The zombies, part of a bot-
net under the control of the botnet controller, can then be
used as remote attack tools to facilitate the sending of
spam, hosting of phishing websites, distribution of mal-
ware and mounting denial of service attacks. The most
commonly used are centralised and P2P modes—hence
the focus on command and control servers for a botnet
that may comprise of thousands of zombies.

3
The Symantec “APJ Internet Security Threat Report”
measured malicious activity that mainly involved botnet-
infected computers, bot command-and-control servers,
phishing Web sites hosts, malicious code reports, spam
zombies and Internet attack origins that took place or
originated in each country. Rankings were based on a cal-
culation of the mean average of the proportion of these
malicious activities originating in each country (Symantec

2007a,
b,
2008,
2009,
2011
)
.


52
R. Broadhurst and L.Y.C. Chang
China ranked top in terms of malicious activi-
ties in the region, followed by the South Korea,
India, Taiwan and Japan (see also Symantec

2011
)
. As to the origin of attacks targeting the
APJ region, Symantec detected that most
attacks came from the USA, followed by China,
South Korea and Japan (Symantec
2009
)
. The
overall impact of malicious activity placed the
USA
ﬁ
rst, and China as the next most affected,
but growing rapidly from 9% of such activity to
16% in 2010. Countries such as Brazil, India and
South Korea account each for about 4% of such
activity (Symantec
2011
)
.

China also had the most botnet-infected com-
puters detected in the APJ region for the period
2006–2010 while Taiwan was ranked second, fol-
lowed by South Korea and India. Taipei was the
city with the most botnet-infected computers in
the region (
Symantec.
2007a,
b,
2008,
2009
)
. A
2010 survey
4 conducted by Norton, an anti-virus
provider, found that 83% of respondents from
China experienced some form of cybercrime,
including a computer virus or some form of
crime-ware. This was much higher than the global
average of 65%. Except for Japan which has a
lower victimisation rate (36%), other countries in
the Asia and Paci
ﬁ
c region like Australia (65%),
India (75%) and New Zealand (70%) are all
higher than the global average (Norton
2010
)
.

Malware like trojans and botnet programs are
spread through social engineering techniques
(Guenther
2001
)
, i.e. methods of deception that
create a false sense of trust, to gain “access infor-
mation,” for example a professional looking web-
site mimicking a brand or service or via spam and
phishing emails. Criminal groups are engaged in
computer or network intrusions to obtain sensi-
tive information such as identity and password
information. This in turn can be used to under-
take large-scale
ﬁ
nancial crime, and social engi-
neering may be the preferred method of obtaining
access to such data contained in digital devices/
computers. The kinds of activities vary but
encompass online scams and malware such as
spyware, phishing, rootkits
5 and botnets. Malware
in
ﬁ
ltrates a computer system and may include
viruses, worms, backdoors, keyloggers and
trojans.

In online scams, the internet is used to reach
potential victims by sending unsolicited mes-
sages pretending to originate from legitimate
organisations in order to deceive individuals or
organisations into disclosing their
ﬁ
nancial and/
or personal identity information. Information
obtained from “phishing” facilitates crimes such
as
ﬁ
nancial fraud and identity theft. For exam-
ple, a common form of phishing in China are
lottery scams delivered by email or instant mes-
senger that links the recipient to a fake website
(cited in KIC
2011
)
. The spread of malware is
easier when a hacker is attuned to what is hap-
pening in a particular culture, and is aware of
the current issues that help make the deception
more effective. For example, some malware has
been designed to target operating systems or
websites using only Chinese language and often
masked with appeals to patriotic sentiments
(Symantec
2008
)
.

Botnets are now widespread and targeted on

ﬁ
nancial opportunities. Botnets are the main
mechanism for the commercialisation and indus-
trialisation of cybercrime. Targets will include all
kinds of digital devices (i.e. mobile phones, rout-
ers, switches and backup devices) as well as
desk-top computers. The increase connectivity of
digitized appliances linked to the Internet
(e.g. vending machines, gas pumps, ATM’s) and
mobile phones to pay for such products will
ensure that they are attractive targets. Mobile or
smart phones also tend to be less well protected
against intrusion than other digital devices. Real-
time programs such as Instant Messaging are
likely to a major risk as are social network sites
where it seems many users assume safety and

4
The survey includes the United States, Australia, Brazil,
Canada, China, France, German, India, Italy, Japan, New
Zealand, Spain, Sweden and the United Kingdom.

5
Rootkits are cloaking technologies usually employed by
other malware programs to misuse compromised systems
by hiding
ﬁ
les, registry keys and other operating system
objects from diagnostic, antivirus and security programs.


53
4 Cybercrime in Asia: Trends and Challenges
privacy is inherent. A trend towards the develop-
ment of semantic/human intelligence methods
rather than syntactic measures is noted because
human-based social engineering can obtain infor-
mation in many cases where technological meth-
ods fail (Chantler and Broadhurst
2008
)
.

Cybercrime in Asia as elsewhere may be
caused by offenders or loose groups who are
hacking “for fun” or ego-driven, but can include
political or ideological motivation, hatred, or
simply to earn a pro
ﬁ
t. However, the involvement
of traditional criminal groups or new criminal
networks is likely to be associated with
ﬁ
nancial
deception and theft (Broadhurst and Choo
2011
)
.
However, when an attack occurs, it is often
unclear who is behind the attack, where it origi-
nates or their motive (Barboza
2010
)
. For exam-
ple, Sony, the Japanese electronics group, was
hacked into in April 2011 and the names,
addresses, emails, birth dates, phone numbers
and other information in respect of 24.6 million
PC game customers were stolen from its servers
(Telegraph
2011
)
. Hackers could have earned a
lot by on-selling this personal information to
“carding” groups (websites and users with a focus
on credit card fraud) or others who may use the
stolen identity to de-fraud e-commerce enter-
prises. While Sony was pursuing legal action
against the hacker groups “GeoHot” and “Graf_
Chokolo,” who allegedly hacked into their sys-
tem, Sony suffered additional cyber attacks which
included a distributed denial of service attack
(DDoS): an attack which makes Web sites or
other network services unavailable to Internet
users by
ﬂ
ooding it with traf
ﬁ
c—from another
hacking group “Anonymous”—an on-line activ-
ist and civil disobedience network. Although
“Anonymous” are allegedly involved in the
revenge, DDoS attacks on Sony over Sony’s pur-
suit of “GeoHot” and “Graf_Chokolo,” also
alleged “Anonymous” hackers (Takahashi
2011
)
,
others argue that given denials by Anonymous
that the motives were more likely pro
ﬁ
t-driven
cyber criminals (Poulsen
2011
)
. Such cases rep-
resent cybercrime where both pro
ﬁ
t and ideologi-
cal reasons may be involved: the hackers saw
Sony as pro
ﬁ
teering from the Internet gaming
industry.

4.2.1

Content Crime

Because of the political situations and the
tensions between some countries in the Asia,
cases of cybercrime with a political purpose are
common. These can be seen between Taiwan and
China, as well as between South and North Korea
and Japan and China, as well as Pakistan and
India (Broadhurst
2006a
)
. For example, Taiwan’s
Ministry of National Defence was hacked and the
computers in the Minister’s Of
ﬁ
ce and the
Secretary’s Of
ﬁ
ce were infected with trojans and
spyware in 2005 and in 2006. The National
Security Bureau in Taiwan claimed that a Chinese
cyber-army launched more than 3,100 attacks
against Taiwanese Government systems in 2008,
and this did not include attacks against the private
sector (Chang
2011
; Huang
2006
; Xu
2009
)
.

Similar occurrences can be seen between
North and South Korea. For example, govern-
ment agencies, banks and businesses in South
Korea have suffered serious cyber attacks. The
South Korean intelligence agency believes that
these attacks were not conducted by individuals,
but were prepared and staged by “certain organi-
sations or states” and that North Korea was the
main suspect (Parry
2009
)
.

Since the risk of cybercrimes, regardless of
motive or the role of organised crime, has
expanded via botnets. How best to prevent cyber-
crime and to deter cyber criminals has become a
major policy question for states and international
agencies. The transnational nature of cybercrime
basically requires that states enact laws to har-
monise de
ﬁ
nitions of criminality and enhance
mutual cooperation across states.

4.3

The Council of Europe
Convention on Cybercrime:
Budapest Convention

A key problem in the prosecution of cybercrime
is that all the elements of the offence are rarely
found in the same jurisdiction. Often the offender
and the victim and even the evidence are located
in different jurisdiction thus requiring a high
degree of cooperation between the law enforcement


54
R. Broadhurst and L.Y.C. Chang
agencies to investigate and prosecute (Brenner

2006

)
. The extent that Asia has been able to
address the need for such cooperation is addressed
by describing the
ﬁ
rst international instrument
and the role it has played in developing cyber-
crime law in Asia.
The Council of Europe’s (CoE) 2001

Convention on Cybercrime
, often referred to as
the
Budapest Convention

6 is currently the only
multi-national agreement that provides for the
means to prosecute cybercriminals and represents
an important attempt to regulate cyberspace. In
order to harmonise criminal law and procedures
across the states of Europe for the prosecution of
cyber-criminals, the CoE
7 drafted a convention
on cybercrime. The initiative can be traced back
to 1989 when the CoE published a set of recom-
mendations on the need for substantive criminal
law to criminalise harmful conduct committed
through computer networks. In 1997 the CoE
formed a Committee of Experts on Crime in
Cyberspace to draft a convention to facilitate
States’ cooperation in investigating and prosecut-
ing computer crimes and to provide a solution to
cybercrime problems through the adoption of an
international legal instrument (Council of Europe

2001a,
b
; ITU
2009
; Keyser
2003
; Weber
2003
)
.
In November 2001, the
Convention on
Cybercrime
was opened for signature and it entered into force
on July 1, 2004 after rati
ﬁ
cation by the required
minimum
ﬁ
ve member countries.
8

The Budapest Convention is supported by the
United Nations (UN) and because it also included
non-Council states it can be also regarded as an
international, rather than regional, treaty (Archick

2006
; Csonka
2000
; Keyser
2003
; Weber
2003
)
.
Resolution 56/121, of the UN General Assembly
noted the work of international and regional
organisations in combating hi-technology crime,
and stressed the importance of the
Convention on

Cybercrime
. The UN also invited Member States,
when developing national laws, policy and prac-
tices aimed at combating the criminal misuse of
information technologies, to take into account the
work and “achievements” of other international
and regional agreements such as the Convention
(United Nations
2002
)
.

The CoE
Convention on
Cybercrime (hereaf-
ter the Convention) has four parts: Chapter I
de
ﬁ
nes the terms used; Chapter II the measures to
be taken at the national level, including substan-
tive criminal law and procedural law; Chapter III
establishes the general principles of international
cooperation and mutual assistance and Chapter
IV includes miscellaneous matters such as acces-
sion to the Convention.
9

In terms of substantive laws, the Convention
lists four: (1) offences against the con
ﬁ
dentiality,
integrity and availability of computer data and
systems, such as illegal access of a computer sys-
tem; interception of non-public transmissions of
computer data to, from, or within a computer sys-
tem; interference with computer data; interfer-
ence with computer systems, such as computer
sabotage and the misuse of computer-related
devices (e.g. “hacker tools”), (2) computer-
related offences, including the traditional offences
of fraud and forgery when carried out through a
computer system, (3) content-related offences, in
order to control the use of computer systems as
vehicles for the sexual exploitation of children
and acts of a racist or xenophobic nature and
(4) offences relating to infringement of copyright
and related rights.

The procedural part of the Convention aims to
enable the prosecution of computer crime by
establishing common procedural rules and adapting

Budapest was the city in which the Convention was
opened for signature November 8, 2001.

The Council of Europe (CoE), founded in 1949, com-
prises 45 countries, including the members of the European
Union (a separate entity), as well as countries from Central
and Eastern Europe. Headquartered in Strasbourg, France,
the CoE was formed as a vehicle for integration in Europe,
and its aims include agreements and common actions in
economic, social, cultural, legal and administrative
matters.

8

Only after rati
ﬁ
cation by
ﬁ
ve states (including at least
three from members of the CoE) will the Convention enter
into force. Albania, Croatia, Estonia, Hungry and Lithuania
were the
ﬁ
rst
ﬁ
ve states to ratify the Convention.

traditional crime
ﬁ
ghting measures such as search
and seizure, and it also creates new measures,
such as expedited preservation of data. As data in
cyberspace is dynamic, other evidence collection
methods relevant to telecommunications (such as
real-time collection of traf
ﬁ
c data and intercep-
tion of content data) have also been adapted to
permit the collection of electronic data during the
process of communication by police or service
providers. The real-time collection of traf
ﬁ
c data
and interception of content data are the most
intrusive powers in the Convention (Csonka

2000
)
. The de
ﬁ
nition of “computer system” in
the Convention does not restrict the manner in
which the devices or group of devices may be
interconnected. These interception powers there-
fore also apply to communications transmitted by
means of any computer system, which could
include transmission of the communication
through telecommunication networks before it is
received by another computer system.

The Convention also makes it clear that inter-
national cooperation is to be provided among
contracting states “to the widest extent possible.”
This principle requires them to provide extensive
cooperation and to minimise impediments to the
rapid
ﬂ
ow of information and evidence. The
Convention also creates the legal basis for an
international computer crime assistance network,
i.e. a network of national contact points perma-
nently available (the “24/7 network”). The net-
work established by the Convention is based on
experience gained from the network created by
the G8 and co-ordinated by the US Department
of Justice. Under the Convention, States are obli-
gated to designate a point of contact available
24 h a day, 7 days a week, in order to ensure
immediate assistance to investigations within the
scope of the Convention. The establishment of
this network is one of the most important provi-
sions provided by the Convention to ensure that
States can respond effectively to the law enforce-
ment challenges posed by computer crime.

The Convention [Article 6(1)(a)] also prohibits
“…the production, sale, procurement for use,
import, distribution” of software programs with
the purpose of committing crime. The intention of
this provision was to prevent the crimes poten-
tially associated with these tools by banning their
creation and distribution. Use and possession are
also criminalised. However, if the purpose of the
program was for a legitimate purpose such as
“authorised testing or protection of a computer
system” then possession of such “malware” was
not criminalised [Article 6(2)]. An exemption
similar to the possession of certain pharmaceuti-
cals by medical practitioners for “legitimate” use,
and exceptions for forensic and preventative use
was also envisaged. So legitimate industry profes-
sionals are not adversely affected but has proven a
dif
ﬁ
cult law to implement, and each jurisdiction
can determine what sorts of malware might trig-
ger unlawful use. Attempts have been made to
control the use of these tools in Germany (German
Criminal Code Law 202c 2007), the UK, (Section
37, UK Computer Misuse Act amendment effec-
tive 2008), Taiwan (Article 362, Criminal Code)
and to some extent in China (Criminal Code 7th
amendment in 2009—Article 285) and Japan
(June 2011 Article 168-2 Japanese Criminal
Code). In July 2011 a European Union (EU) min-
isterial meeting proposed to make “hacking tools”
illegal but the de
ﬁ
nition of a “tool” has been ques-
tioned as well as the effectiveness of such a prohi-
bition. To date, there have been few prosecutions
in jurisdictions with relevant legislation, and
crime-ware is still readily available.

The continued proliferation of malware arises
in part because some states continue to be the
“weakest links” in the supposedly seamless cross-
national security web necessary to prevent cyber-
crime. Indeed the involvement of the state or at
least quasi-state actors in the dissemination and
use of crime-ware is a considerable impediment
to effective law enforcement. In some countries
in Asia, the absence of appropriate laws and/or
effective law enforcement enables their jurisdic-
tion to provide safe havens for cybercriminals.

4.4

Application of the Budapest
Convention in Asia

As in September 2012, the Convention has
received 47 signatories and of those, 37 countries
have rati
ﬁ
ed it after signing. The rapid ascension


56
R. Broadhurst and L.Y.C. Chang
of the Convention re
ﬂ
ects the importance of the
problem and the recognition that a multi-national
approach will be needed. Most of the signatory
countries are Member States of the CoE with only
four non-member States (Canada, Japan, South
Africa and the USA) signing the Convention. The
USA was the
ﬁ
rst non-member State to ratify the
Convention, however, the additional protocol to
the convention which speci
ﬁ
cally address hate
crime was excluded on the constitutional grounds
of the right to free speech. The accession by the
USA elevated the status of the Convention to an
international rather than a regional treaty.

As noted, most countries in Asia are not signa-
tories of the Convention. Although the conven-
tion is open to any non-member state wishing to
join only Japan has signed the treat while
Australia is likely to accede in late 2012 as the
relevant Bill has passed in Senate in August 2012
(Lee
2012
)
. Nevertheless many Asian countries
have looked to the Convention for guidance on
new laws.

Using the Convention as a benchmark,
Microsoft
(
2007
) investigated 14 countries
10 in
Asia to see whether their computer security laws
aligned with the requirements of the Convention.
It shows that, in 2007, most countries in Asia
could be classi
ﬁ
ed as having either favourable
alignment or moderate alignment. Only India and
Indonesia were at that time classi
ﬁ
ed as having a
weak alignment. Since the Microsoft report, new
laws against cybercrime have been introduced by
PR China, India, Indonesia and Japan. These
changes make the laws in those countries more
closely aligned to the essential requirements of
the Convention.

For example, amendments to the “Information
Technology Act (IT Act), 2000” (India IT Act
2000) were adopted by the Parliament of India
and rati
ﬁ
ed on February 5, 2009. The “Information
Technology (Amendment) Act, 2008” (IT Act
2008) re
ﬂ
ected largely the requirements of the
Convention (Council of Europe
2009
)
. Apart
from unauthorised access, introduction of viruses,
damage, disruption and denial of access in sec-
tion 43 of the India IT Act 2000, the amendments
also criminalised offences, such as using com-
puter codes or communication devices to dissem-
inate false information, dishonestly receiving or
retaining any stolen computer resources or com-
munication devices, fraudulently or dishonestly
making use of electronic signature, password or
other unique identi
ﬁ
cation features of any other
person (see amendments to section 66—66A to
66F). Also amendments to section 67, enhanced
the punishment for publishing or transmitting
obscene material in electronic form from 3 to
5 years and also impose
ﬁ
nes from 100,000 to
500,000
Indian
Rupees
(approximately
USD2,000–10,000).
In
addition,
ancillary
offences in the draft Right to Privacy Bill now
before the Indian Parliament includes provisions
against illegal interception (Venkatesan
2011
)
.
These amendments and new laws make India
more aligned to the requirements of the
Convention.

The Indonesian government enacted Law No.
11 of 2008 regarding Information and Electronic
Transactions. It passed substantive laws similar
to the Convention, including illegal access, ille-
gal interception, data interference, misuse of
devices, computer-related fraud and forgery
(Noor
2010
)
. China and Japan also amended their
cybercrime laws, which aligned them more to the
Convention. In China, the offence of illegal
access only applied to the access to computer
systems used for state affairs, at national defence
facilities and in the aid of sophisticated scienti
ﬁ
c
work. This was widely criticised as inadequate.
Consequently, Amendment VII of the PRC
Criminal Law was promulgated in February
2009, corrected this de
ﬁ
ciency and illegal access
to a computer system in areas other than those
previously proscribed could be sanctioned
(Article 285). The amendment also added sanc-
tions for those who provide a tool or process,
which is solely used for illegal access and unlaw-
ful control of a computer system in section 3 of
Article 285—in effect potentially criminalising
crime-ware.

10
The countries investigated include Australia, China,
Hong Kong, India, Indonesia, Japan, Malaysia, New
Zealand, Philippines, Singapore, South Korea, Taiwan,
Thailand and Vietnam.

4 Cybercrime in Asia: Trends and Challenges

In 2009 Japan revised its Penal Code to further
address problems of cybercrime paving the way
for ascension to the Convention. The revision
made punishable the creation or distribution of a
computer virus, acquisition or storage of a virus,
and sending emails containing pornography
images to random groups of people. The amend-
ments also strengthened investigative powers by
permitting data to be seized or copied from com-
puter servers that are connected via online net-
works to a computer seized for investigation.
Authorities are also given the power to request
Internet service providers to retain communica-
tions logs, such as the names of email senders
and recipients, for up to 60 days (Kyodo
2011
)
.

From the discussion above, we can see that
countries in Asia are not only amending their laws
to regulate offences against the con
ﬁ
dentiality,
integrity and availability of computer data and
systems, content offences are also a focus.
Publishing or transmitting obscene material (espe-
cially obscene material involving a child) is now
punishable in most Asian countries.

However, there is still little consensus on what
constitutes content crime within the very diverse
Asian region. It has been observed that, in Asia,
notions of obscenity and pornography/erotica
vary widely from country to country. For exam-
ple, compared to people in China, Taiwan and
Hong Kong, the Japanese might have a higher
tolerance to erotic materials. Islamic countries
have a much less tolerant approach to obscene
materials. Many have a “zero tolerance” approach
where any form of nudity is recognised as being
obscene (Broadhurst
2006a
)
.

Many countries (e.g. Australia, Italy, Norway,
Sweden, Switzerland, United Kingdom, China,
Iran, Saudi Arabia, Burma, Vietnam, Singapore and
Thailand) attempt to exercise control over undesir-
able or illegal content by blacklisting websites.
Although there is near universal criminalisation of
child pornography, most Internet content crime,
including those designed to incite racial or religious
vili
ﬁ
cation crime are not criminalised. Some coun-
tries (e.g. China, Singapore, Pakistan) also
ﬁ
lter
social networking sites; however, it is also evident
that many attempts at blocking or
ﬁ
ltering web
access can be readily overcome (OpenNet
2010
)
.

In summary, laws against cybercrime in most
countries in Asia are either favourably or moder-
ately aligned with the Convention. However,
dilemmas still exists when it comes to the inter-
pretation of certain types of content crime, and it
is likely that Asian countries (like the USA) may
only join the convention with exceptions to the
protocols on content crime.

4.4.1

The Development of the
Budapest Convention

Although the
Convention is widely considered to
be the
ﬁ
rst international convention on cyber-
crime, and is accepted as such by the UN, some
countries regard it as a regional rather than inter-
national treaty. Harley
(
2010
) argued that,
although the Convention is not strictly a regional
agreement, it is also not a global convention as
there is only one non-Member state of the CoE
(the USA) which has rati
ﬁ
ed the Convention.
11


The degree of participation of countries in Asia
region in the
Convention is limited, and many
countries have yet to fully develop their cyber-
crime laws to the requisite standard. For example,
differences between Chinese laws and the
Convention may be the reason why China has not
signed the Convention. Although recent amend-
ments to its criminal laws have made China’s legal
responses to cybercrime more aligned to those of
the Convention, there still remains inconsistency
between Chinese criminal procedural law and the
requirements of the Convention, especially in
regard to search and seizure for the collection and
production of computer data.

Countries such as China, Russia and India
were not involved in the development of the
Convention and have at times argued that a UN
treaty or code would be more appropriate. This
seems to be re
ﬂ
ected by a senior police of
ﬁ
cer
from China who stated (cited in Chang
2012
):

…the Council of Europe has been in contact with
China, trying to persuade China to amend its law to

ﬁ
t the requirements of the Convention. However,

11
Japan has rati
ﬁ
ed the Convention on July 3, 2012.


58
R. Broadhurst and L.Y.C. Chang
China did not care much about this issue then.
And, anyway, when they were drafting the conven-
tion, they did not invite China to join in the draft-
ing. Now they want us to join, we are not
interested.

In contrast the Taiwanese Government has
expressed an interest in signing the Convention
on Cybercrime, but is hindered by its ambiguous
political situation, where it is not recognised by
the Council of Europe as a country (Chang

2012
)
.

Given the limited degree of participation of
countries in Asia in the Convention, China along
with India, South Korea, and a number of other
developing countries recently initiated a proposal
to create a new global cybercrime treaty. More
than 50% of the world’s population, or an esti-
mated 40% of all Internet users, do not come
under the auspices of the CoE Convention.

The CoE’s cybercrime convention needs to be
expanded or re-invented to capture the phenom-
enal growth of the Internet especially in Asia.
Previous attempts to develop a UN convention on
cybercrime may also need to be re-activated as
circumstances have changed considerably since
the late 1990s when the CoE began the lengthy
process of creating the convention through diplo-
matic and expert dialogue. The absence of effec-
tive regional mutual legal assistance and
cooperation in criminal matters in ASEAN and
wider Asia (Gordon
2009
)
, especially cybercrime
(Thomas
2009
) may be addressed via another
iteration of the convention engaging those parties
not originally at the table.

For some developing countries, the 2002
Commonwealth Nations model law on computer-
related crime and international cooperation pro-
vides guidance especially useful for those
jurisdictions sharing a common legal history.
Indeed it had been estimated that over a thousand
bilateral treaties between Commonwealth States
are required to ensure adequate mutual legal
assistance (United Nations
2010
)
.

Developing countries may be reluctant to sign
on to the CoE convention because of the high
standards of procedural law and cooperation
required. The depth of the digital divide and the
dif
ﬁ
culties of creating consensus should not be
over-estimated in the context of a UN sponsored
process. Fears among the advanced technological
states that a UN instrument might result in a
“dumb” down version of the CoE convention will
have to be addressed in order to re-activate a
more widely accepted treaty format (Masters

2010
)
. The reluctance of Brazil to sign on to the
CoE convention due to concerns about the crimi-
nalization of intellectual property (Harley
2010
)
,
however, shows that agreement will not be pos-
sible on all issues. Traditions of dual criminality
in mutual legal assistance matters will remain a
signi
ﬁ
cant hurdle and a hybrid or two-tiered uni-
versal or UN treaty in tandem with the CoE may
emerge. A global convention on cybercrime was
given further impetus by the recent recommenda-
tion of the 12th United Nations Congress on
Crime Prevention and Criminal Justice (United
Nations
2010
, para 32). Given harmonisation of
responses to non-traditional security threats is
relatively novel, the CoE and Commonwealth
examples will be useful guides to a truly univer-
sal treaty.

4.5

Future Developments
in Cybercrime Law

As the Convention is based on the types of cyber-
crime that originated in the late 1990s, a number
of new problems and attack methods are not
explicitly covered by the Convention, and these
will require attention in future iterations. These
include the following.

4.5.1

Botnets

The use of botnets is arguably the most signi
ﬁ
cant
development in cybercrime to arise since the
original signing of the Convention. Using large
numbers of networked infected-computers, bot-
net operators can launch highly damaging attacks,
including such serious crimes as DDoS attacks. It
can also be used to send out massive numbers of
spam and phishing messages. It is estimated that
80% of phishing incidents are related to botnets
(Schjolberg and Ghernaouti-Helie
2011
)
. Large


59
4 Cybercrime in Asia: Trends and Challenges
botnets with hundreds of thousands of computers
have been discovered, and these have been
employed for purposes of cyber-terrorism and
cyber-warfare. Botnets may mimic in some ways
a form of cyber-organised crime (Chang
2012
)
.

Using bot-infected computers as springboards
to launch cyber attacks, criminals can avoid inves-
tigation or disturb investigation as the compro-
mised computers are usually located in different
countries and there are still no guidelines for
international cooperation on investigation. Botnets
are now available for lease or purchase and can be
obtained on-line for a reasonable price. Criminals
without a technology background are able to
launch cyber-attacks by using readily available
malicious toolkits or they hire hackers to do so.
As bot-infected computers’ sellers and buyers can
potentially be located in different countries, real-
time cross-border cooperation in criminal investi-
gation becomes essential.


4.5.2

Cloud Computing

This relatively new con
ﬁ
guration of data storage
and access is a form of shared data warehousing
long used by generic service providers such as
“gmail” and “yahoo” but brings new concerns in
relation to cyber-security. One problem may be
access to or retention of evidentiary data such as
log or ISP address data, for law enforcement.
“Cloud” computing provides computation, soft-
ware, data access and storage services often at
cheaper costs allowing users to store their data at
remote storage facilities provided by service
companies or to use software provided by those
companies. Users no longer need to physically
store their data on their own computer or buy
software for themselves. While it may be conve-
nient for users, cloud computing has the potential
to become a barrier to successful crime investiga-
tion (Schjolberg
2010
)
.

4.5.3

Anonymity and Encryption

The relative anonymity with which people con-
duct themselves online can lend itself to illicit
activity. The use of freely available tools to mask
IP addresses, locations and identities makes the
task of law enforcement more dif
ﬁ
cult, as does
the use of encryption programs to protect data
from third party access (see Chu, Holt and Ahn

2010
)
. While these tools also have legitimate
uses, their easy availability to cyber criminals
may need to be addressed in future iterations of
cybercrime law. Indeed, some countries already
have speci
ﬁ
c law enforcement powers to compel
the release of encryption keys.

4.5.4

Social Networking

A considerable amount of cybercrime—includ-
ing online harassment, stalking and child groom-
ing—is made easier through the use of social
networking sites such as Myspace and Facebook.
These services are ideal for facilitating social
contact and business relationships, but they also
afford insuf
ﬁ
cient protection to unsophisticated
and vulnerable users such as children. Greater
attention to the possibilities for law enforcement
monitoring of such sites, assisted by the private
sector entities involved, may be required in the
interests of public safety. In turn, this may neces-
sitate a regulatory response that connects sex
offenders and law enforcement databases in a
more systematic way. Counter-arguments based
on privacy concerns usually ignore the privacy
and safety rights of victims of cybercrime.

4.5.5

A Universal Harmonised
Cybercrime Law

In order to
ﬁ
ght transnational cybercrime, it is
widely agreed that there is a need for an interna-
tional convention that has universal application.
The EU and the USA support the CoE’s

Convention on
Cybercrime and are encouraging
more states to sign and ratify it. They see a pro-
cess of socialising the Convention as the best way
forward and are opposed to the distraction of a
UN treaty and the watering down of its scope by
excluding intellectual property offences, among
others (USA
2011
, p. 9):


60
R. Broadhurst and L.Y.C. Chang

The development of norms for state conduct in
cyberspace does not require a reinvention of cus-
tomary international law, nor does it render exist-
ing international norms obsolete. Long-standing
international norms guiding state behavior—in
times of peace and con
ﬂ
ict—also apply in
cyberspace

Despite the efforts of the USA and Europe, the
Convention has not reached a similar level of
acceptance in other regions and countries outside
the European region.

A new global cybercrime treaty was discussed
at the 12th United Nation Congress on Crime
Prevention and Criminal Justice in Salvador,
Brazil (United Nations
2010
) and a draft treaty
presented by Norwegian Judge Stein Schjolberg
and Professor Solange Ghernauti-Hélie from the
University of Lausanne. This outlined measures
similar to the Convention but took into account
the criminal innovations noted above, such as
phishing, bot-nets, spam, identity theft and ter-
rorism (Schjolberg
2010
)
. Compared with the
CoE’s Convention, the Draft replicated the proce-
dural law of the convention but deleted references
to intellectual property offences in cyberspace.
One of the key norms and standards identi
ﬁ
ed in
the USA’s promotion of the rule of law in the
“International Strategy for Cybercrime” was the
protection of intellectual property and its elimi-
nation from a proposed UN cybercrime treaty
illustrated the signi
ﬁ
cant differences that con-
tinue to undermine efforts to harmonise cyber-
crime laws. The Draft also proposed additional
criminal offences such as identity theft, mass
coordinated cyber-threats against critical infra-
structure, terrorism and the most serious cyber-
attacks
including
the
criminalisation
of
crime-ware and attack toolkits. Schjolberg
(
2011
)
also proposed an international criminal court or
tribunal for cyberspace because not all countries
are willing to cooperate or are able to cooperate
and an international criminal court or tribunal
will be able to take action to investigate and pros-
ecute transnational cyber criminals.

Russia has also sought a UN convention
against cybercrime and along with China has
urged the UN to adopt a voluntary code. The
Russian Government has argued that the current
CoE’s
Convention on
Cybercrime is outdated,
and did not address the problem of how to control
the use of the Internet in the spread of ideas or
skills relating to terrorism and cyber terrorism.
Neither does the current Convention, according
to this critiques put any emphasis on problems
such as identity theft and the emergence of social
networks and microblogs (Isakova
2011
)
. If USA
policy is any guide to the likelihood of signi
ﬁ
cant
changes in international approaches to cyber-
crime developments that restrict legitimate access
to the Internet rather than combat illegal activi-
ties will be unwelcome (USA
2011
, pp. 19–20).

Conclusion

This chapter brie
ﬂ
y reviewed developments in
cybercrime and the law-enforcement response in
Asia. We noted the rapid rise of cybercrime as a
problem and the relatively underdeveloped multi-
lateral response to it. Although the
Budapest


Convention
established a good base to harmonise
the differences in laws and regulations against
cybercrime between different countries, the
Convention has not been widely adopted by many
Asian countries or indeed as yet other parts of the
world. While this may be attributable to inconsis-
tencies with laws and regulations in some coun-
tries, for others there is reluctance to sign on to
what is seen as essentially a European instru-
ment. Even if laws are moderately or fully aligned
with the Convention, they may still not wish to
sign the Convention. This problem is unlikely to
be solved in the near future, and may frustrate
cross-national cooperation on cybercrime investi-
gation and prosecution. With the development of
new technologies such as cloud computing,
“smart” phones and social media, as well as the
emergence of botnets and the expansion of
encryption, the Convention requires updating.

Creating a network for illegal purposes and
selling or renting established botnets to commit
or facilitate criminal activities along with so-
called “attack toolkits” (e.g. ZeuS and Spyware)
should be more widely criminalised and may
help reduce organised crime in cyberspace.
The widespread incidence of identity theft as a

common precursor offence requires a broad-based
prevention effort (
Morris 2008; White and Fisher

2008
)
. The problem of “hate” and “content”
crime will remain complex and more widespread
via social networks and the under-net, but with
no prospect of a universal approach although
prone to over-lap with criminal activity and enter-
prise. The potential for mitigation of transna-
tional cybercrime ultimately lies in effective
public–private partnerships and effective interna-
tional cooperation, albeit not completely depen-
dent on an international treaty (Wall
2007
)
.
Greater understanding by government and com-
merce of the industrial scale of commercial
cybercrime, and the recognition of a sense of
“shared fate” in cyberspace, will quicken the
development of multilateral responses and the
capability for transnational crime control. Comity
can be promoted if wealthy states and affected
industries are prepared to fully aid those states or
agencies less capable of enacting and enforcing
appropriate laws. It can be argued, however, that
a strict enforcement agenda is usually not feasible
because of the limited capacity of the state, espe-
cially public policy agencies whose resources are
usually rationed (Broadhurst
2006b
)
. A risk is
that over-regulation could sti
ﬂ
e commercial and
technological development in developing coun-
tries and those sceptical of an interventionist
approach also argue that the marketplace may be
able to provide more effective crime prevention
measures (Newman and Clarke
2003
) and
ef
ﬁ
cient solutions to the problems of computer-
related crime than the state.

Introduction

Q. Lu (aka H. Ming) fetched meals and ran petty
errands for his bosses—a gopher. He was like
other youths in a North American city Chinatown
where he worked menial jobs in the hopes of
being noticed by a Dai Lo (big brother) or a gang
leader. He was eventually noticed by his
ﬁ
rst
boss, A. Tran. From there, Lu’s career as a gang-
ster steadily rose, from running errands to assum-
ing protection and security duties for Tran’s
gambling dens and brothels. Tran, however, was
assassinated in 1991 in Toronto’s Chinatown over
a gambling debt. Lu’s second boss, L. Cham, was
also assassinated in 2000 by a hitman from
Quebec. Thus, almost by default, the former
gopher assumed the role of a gangster boss and
took over the loan sharking and other illegal
operations in the city (e.g., marijuana grow oper-
ations, gaming dens). Lu incurred a large sum of
gambling debt in 2007 after a trip to Macau; his
daughter reported him missing shortly after his
return. In May of 2010, Lu’s body, stuffed inside
a barrel, was pulled out of Lake Ontario (see
Lamberti
2010
)
.

While the yakuza was inaugurated in the mod-
ern era in the ashes of post World War II (WWII)
Japan by returning soldiers who provided
security,
order maintenance, and a preexisting distribution
network for American goods and relief funds
(Yamagata
2001
)
, in addition to the usual vices
such as gambling and prostitution (Saga
1991
)
,
contemporary Japanese gangsters appear to have
moved well beyond the traditional forms of ille-
galities. In fact, the Japanese National Police
Agency recently reported that the yakuza had
penetrated the stock exchanges in various Japanese
cities by manipulating and trading shares of pub-
licly listed companies, thus shaking the con
ﬁ
dence
of the trading public and investors (Lewis
2008a
)
.
In fact, Japanese gangsters had gone so far as to
set up ghost companies as a way of manipulating
stock prices, and creating
ﬁ
nancial auditing
ﬁ
rms
to sign-off on falsi
ﬁ
ed accounting and fabricated
company books (Lewis
2008b
)
.

In January of 2010, the United States Drug
Enforcement Administration (DEA) of
ﬁ
cials
found close to 50 g of methamphetamine hidden
inside a photo album. The drugs were shipped to
South Korea via Mexico and the United States
using the global shipping company FedEx. South
Korean law enforcement of
ﬁ
cials and DEA inves-
tigators set up a sting operation to arrest the cul-
prits. The investigation ultimately led to the arrest
of Mr. Seo and Mr. Moon, both Korean gangsters
living in Korea (“South Korea, USA cooperate in
crackdown on drug traf
ﬁ
cking”
2010
)
. Such
changes in organized crime business arose,
according to police, after the Korean National
Police Agency began a massive crackdown
against organized crime groups—gangsters—in
South Korea in August of 2008, for extorting

money from street vendors, small businesses, and
entertainment agencies; it was also reported that
the police crackdown on the sex trade compelled
Korean gangsters (jok-pok) to seek alternative
sources of income (“South Korean police plan
intensive crackdown on organized crime”
2008
)
.

Whether the illegal activity is loan sharking in
Macau resulting in a contract murder in Toronto
(Canada), stock manipulation and fraudulent
accounting in Osaka (Japan), or smuggling nar-
cotics to South Korea via the United States and
Mexico, the examples used above illustrate the
transnational and international character of orga-
nized criminal enterprises (Chin et al.
1998
; c.f.
Zhang and Chin
2003

)
. For the purposes of this
paper, an “organized crime group” is de
ﬁ
ned as “a
structured group of three or more persons existing
for a period of time acting in concert with the aim
of committing one or more serious crimes or
offenses … in order to obtain, directly or indi-
rectly, a
ﬁ
nancial or other material bene
ﬁ
t”
(Finckenauer and Chin
2006
, p. 22). In this paper,
the term “triad” is used primarily to refer to orga-
nized crime groups that originate and operate out
of Hong Kong and surrounding areas (e.g.,
Kowloon, Macau) (Chin
1995
; Song and Dombrink

1994
)
; the term “yakuza” is used primarily to refer
to organized crime groups that originate and oper-
ate out of Japan (Yamagata
2001
)
; the term “jok-
pok” is used primarily to refer to organized crime
groups that originate and operate out of South
Korea. Although Lee
(

2006

)
uses the term “keon-
dal” to describe Korean ma
ﬁ
a-like
ﬁ
gures, it is
used in a singular nominative sense; the term “jok-
pok” (people of violence), however, describes
Korean organized crime groups as a collective
whole, similar to the way “triad” and “yakuza” are
used. In this paper, we use the broad term “Asian
gangsters” to refer to organized crime groups that
engage in offenses for
ﬁ
nancial and material gain
from the respective countries of China (Hong
Kong), Japan, and South Korea. This paper exam-
ines the portrayals of Asian gangsters in Asian
(Chinese, Japanese, Korean) cinema.

There are several reasons why an examination
of Asian gangsters in cinema is warranted. First,

ﬁ
ndings from previous research on Asian orga-
nized crime groups are inconsistent and peppered
with incomplete
ﬁ
ndings on the types of illicit
activities of the Asian crime groups. This condi-
tion may be attributed to the fact that Asian

organized crime groups are exceedingly secretive
and dif
ﬁ
cult to in
ﬁ
ltrate: there has been an over-
reliance on secondary sources, such as law
enforcement and journalistic accounts (Zhang and
Chin
2008

)
. Consequently, this reliance on news
media outlets has resulted in inconsistencies when
discussing the types of legitimate and illegitimate
activities of Asian organized crime groups.

For example, previous research has found that
Asian organized crime syndicates have engaged in
transnational narcotics traf
ﬁ
cking and human
smuggling throughout the Americas (Hudson
2003
;
Miro
2003
; Richard
1999
)
, while other
ﬁ
ndings
have disputed those claims (Chin
2009
; Finckenauer
and Chin
2006
; Lo
2010
; Zhang and Chin
2003,

2008

)
. With such contradictory results that emerge
out of state-sponsored research and academia, pop-
ular forms of entertainment such as movies may be
one of the most accessible ways that the public
gains information about triads, yakuza, and jok-
pok in their respective countries. It behooves us to
critically examine the contents of those
ﬁ
lms to dis-
cern how they might shape the public’s perception
of crime groups in their countries.

Second, if movies about triads, yakuza, and
jok-pok glamorize gangster life, by giving the
impression that gangsters dominate cityscape and
city life and live the “good life,” surrounded by
gorgeous women while their relations with other
gangsters are marked by a code of honor and
chivalry (Yin
2009
)
, then such popularly held
preconceptions about gangster life in Asian gang-
sters movies warrant a serious examination of
their accuracy and such enduring stereotypes.
Assessing the accuracy of Asian gangster stereo-
type in cinema is a topic that has not been
addressed by previous research. This paper rem-
edies that de
ﬁ
ciency in the existing literature.

Third, some have asserted that the growing
number of
ﬁ
lms about triads—and perhaps Asian
gangster
ﬁ
lms in general—in Hong Kong may
promulgate fear amongst the viewing public by
sensationalizing their dangerousness and threat
to society (Finckenauer and Chin
2006
, p. 101).
Such fear mongering in fact may empower


67
5 Triad, Yakuza, and Jok-Pok: Asian Gangsters in Cinema

organized crime groups by allowing them to
expand and conduct their operations without

disruption and without the fear of citizen inter-
vention (Chu
2005
)
. Therefore, it behooves us to
examine the accuracy of previous claims. Are
Asian gangster
ﬁ
lms likely to perpetuate fear?
We provide a provisional answer in this paper.

Fourth, we did not use representations of Asian
gangsters in Western (i.e., Hollywood)
ﬁ
lms.
While such a study would have been valid—and
interesting—in its own right, we had serious

reservations about using portrayals of Asian
gangsters in Western cinema. That is because
Hollywood has not been kind to Asians, Chinese
men in particular. Asian women have usually
been cast as the exotic, enigmatic, and sexualized
“dragon lady” of the Orient (Said
1978
)
. And
rather than telling the story of Asian women
and their unique and culturally nuanced histories
and contingencies, they have been constructed as
the object of European males’ desire, as well the
desiring beings of European men (Chan
2001,

2007
; Kang
1993
; Kim
2006
)
. Asian men, on the
other hand, have been tacitly constructed as asex-
ual creatures (Okazaki
2002
)
, undesirable as
objects of female sexual desire, unworthy and
incapable of sexual and emotional intimacy by
virtue of their race and their race alone (Chen

1996
)
. Or when Asian men have appeared in
“masculine” roles, they have still been relegated
as nonsexual martial artists (Chan
2000
) who
speak with a comedic Asian accent (Park et al.

2006
)
, or perverts and criminals (Shek
2006
)
.

Thus, we did not want to begin this paper with
such a heavy historical baggage from the start.
Instead, we wanted to examine the cinematic
lives of Asian gangsters in their own turf, told by
Chinese,
Japanese,
and
Korean—Asian—
screenwriters and directors, through
ﬁ
lms that
were intended for those respective audiences
(Park
1992
). Through a critical examination of
portrayals of Asian gangsters in cinema, we
attempt to remedy the gaps noted in the preced-
ing paragraphs. By doing so, we hope to be able
to contribute to the literature in the following
areas: (1) Asian criminology, (2) Asian gang
studies, (3) Asian cinema studies, and (4) Asian
masculinity.

5.2
Background

There are an abundant number of active Asian
organized crime groups that are often depicted in

ﬁ
lms, in Asia, as well as internationally (Berry
et al.
2003
). The most prominent organized crime
groups in Asia are the triads, the Green Gang,
Chinese refugee gangs, the Jiaotou brothers, and
common Chinese/Taiwanese street gangs who, as
a whole, operate in a variety of illicit and lucra-
tive activities (Huang
2006
)
. These groups can be
classi
ﬁ
ed as traditional hierarchies, hybrid orga-
nizations, and/or criminal networks (Xia
2008
)
.
The triads are the largest international Asian
organized crime groups with over 300 factions
known as “umbrella groups,” such as the Sun Yee
On, 14K, and Wo Shing Wo (Chu
2005
; Bolz

1995
; Finckenauer and Chin
2006
)
. Although
Asian organized crime groups vary in size,

ﬂ
exibility, and structure, monopolistic organiza-
tions such as the triads have a multigenerational
hierarchy that is universal, regional, and territo-
rial in their illicit activities to ensure stable clien-
tele and long-term pro
ﬁ
ts (Zhang and Chin
2003
;
Berry et al.
2003
).

Internationally, triads have begun to form
af
ﬁ
liations with other criminal syndicates and
entrepreneurs, such as the tongs in the United
States, in order to expand their operations and
in
ﬂ
uence globally (Bolz
1995
). While common
parlance con
ﬂ
ates triads and tongs as synonymous
entities, there is a distinction that needs to be
made. Triads are a criminal group whose sole pur-
pose is to make money through illicit activities
such as extortion, drug traf
ﬁ
cking, gambling, and
racketeering (Finckenauer and Chin
2006
)
. Tongs,
on the other hand, are community and civic orga-
nizations within Chinatowns; and while tongs
originally began as operators of opium dens and
gambling halls, they are more accurately described
as intermediaries between ethnic Chinese com-
munity and the English-speaking world—a com-
munity self-help organization (Chin
1995
)
. That
fact, however, does not mean that tongs do not
exert in
ﬂ
uence—positive and negative—in their
communities (Kelly et al.
1993a,
b
)
. As Asian
organized crime groups form relationships and


68
P.T. Lankin and P.C. Shon
cooperate with other triad
factions, criminal syn-
dicates, and tongs, such connections have the
potential to enhance international economic
opportunities, concurrently planting the seeds of
institutionalization (Hagedorn
2009
; Joe
1994
)
.
Triads have presently cooperated with organiza-
tions who were once rivals and other Asian crime
syndicates to create a cohesive structure that
allows them to take advantage of weaknesses in
international law enforcement, borders, and gov-
ernments (Zhang and Chin
2003
)
.

The literature on Asian organized groups is
marked by inconsistencies regarding the extent
and characteristics of illicit criminal activities of
Asian organized crime groups in the area of
human smuggling and drug traf
ﬁ
cking. Often,
law enforcement and the media report and accept
the validity of Asian organized crime groups as
the responsible culprits of the two preceding ille-
galities (Chin
1996
)
. Bolz (
1995
) reported that
Asian organized crime groups have dominated
these industries through false front triad-owned
travel agencies, where they have planned routes,
false identi
ﬁ
cation papers, and worldwide associ-
ates that assist them. As an example, it was
alleged by the United States State Department
that Hana Tours, a travel agency located in Seoul,
South Korea, falsi
ﬁ
ed employment information
on visa applications for their female clients. The
diplomatic cable from the American embassy in
Seoul alleged that Hana Tours would
ﬂ
ood the
consular of
ﬁ
ce with 20–30 visa applications in
the hopes of getting six to nine women through
(Richard
1999
)
.

Miro
(
2003
) also alleges that Asian criminal
organizations—triads, yakuza, “Korean-Ma
ﬁ
a”—
are extremely active in Latin America, engaging
in the traf
ﬁ
cking of women, human smuggling,
narcotics distribution, and counterfeit production
and sales. Similarly, Husdon (2003) posits that
triads, yakuza, and “Korean-Ma
ﬁ
a” operate out
of the Tri-Border area of Argentina, Brazil, and
Paraguay, extorting ethnically owned businesses
and engaging in the manufacture and sale of
counterfeit goods. As it relates to traf
ﬁ
cking of
women, Richard
(
1999
) states that such offenses
necessitate intercontinental cooperation and col-
laboration, for women who are traf
ﬁ
cked must
travel from the country of origin through transit
countries, and ultimately, to destination
countries,
which require the complicity of entrepreneurs in
the private sector, immigration agencies, and law
enforcement. Academic researchers, however,
claim that narcotics traf
ﬁ
cking and human smug-
gling out of Asia are carried out by independent
entrepreneurs who form temporary criminal
enterprises that are opportunistic and nonhierar-
chal, ranging from three to
ﬁ
ve individuals
(Zhang and Chin
2003
)
, or in exceptional cases,
one talented person (Sein
2008
)
.

Again, although most research acknowledges
that Asian organized crime syndicates are
involved in the production and international dis-
tribution of narcotics, some have disputed claims
of transnational drug traf
ﬁ
cking and human
smuggling on the part of Asian crime groups
(e.g., Chin
2009
; Dupont
1999
; Zhang and Chin

2003,
2008
)
. That challenge to
ﬁ
ndings from
operational based studies materialized from the
painstaking and diligent work from those who
have carried out in-depth qualitative
ﬁ
eldwork
with the major players in the illicit enterprises of
Asian organized crime


groups (Chin
1996,
1999,

2009
; Zhang and Chin
2001,
2002,
2003,
2008
)
.
As an example, the Golden Triangle, located in
the border areas of Thailand, Burma, and Laos, is
one of the largest producers of heroin in the
world, but the individuals operating in it are not
part of any organized crime syndicate (Dupont

1999
; Chin
2009

)
. Asian organized crime groups
often decline to participate in these trades as it is
inherently risky, highly competitive, and expen-
sive and has the potential to destroy their gangs
(Joe
1994
; Zhang and Chin
2003
)
. Asian orga-
nized crime group members and leaders have,
however, become opportunistically involved in
the drug trade and smuggling activities as entre-
preneurs (Soudijn and Kleemans
2009
)
.

Despite such noted inconsistencies, there is
consensus as to the types of illicit activities Asian
crime groups
undertake. Triads, yakuza, and

jok-pok operate sophisticated multimillion-dollar
industries in cross-national narcotics traf
ﬁ
cking,
counterfeiting, prostitution, arms traf
ﬁ
cking,
gambling dens, extortion, armed robbery, credit
card theft and fraud, loan sharking, money

laundering, fraud, contract killings, and the kid-
napping and trading of women and minors for
entertainment industries (Bolz
1995
; Berry et al.

2003
; Chin
1996
; Finckenauer and Chin
2006
;
Hughes et al.
2007
; Huang
2006
; Kelly et al.

1993a,
b
; Lindberg et al.
1998
)
. These organized
crime groups not only have the reputation to
allow them to engage in such activities, but they
also have the skills (e.g., specialized workers)
and connections to maximize pro
ﬁ
ts while
expanding across international borders (Edwards
and Levi
2008
; Chu
2005
; Xia
2008
)
.

Asian organized crime groups are able to
effectively operate illicit activities precisely
because they have motivated customers who
demand their services (Edwards and Levi
2008
)
.
For example, Dupont
(
1999
) stated that there are
over
ﬁ
fteen million opium addicts in China,

making the heroin industry a high-demand, mul-
tibillion-dollar industry. To meet that demand
and to evade detection, Asian crime groups
employ tactics (e.g., compartmentalization) to
avoid detection (e.g., use of runners and enforc-
ers). For example, enforcers are responsible for
ensuring the safety of the organized crime group
and its markets while runners perform the risky
task of transporting large quantities of contra-
bands (Levitt and Venkatest
2000
)
. Those
employed in such roles accept the risks of the job,
including death, injury, and arrest. However,
Asian gangs have often employed the vulnerable,
impoverished, and unemployed by delegating
risky tasks to them (e.g., drug mules) due to their
expendability (Dupont
1999
; Huisman
2008
)
.

In addition to their illegitimate activities, Asian
organized crime groups also have legitimate and
semi-legitimate businesses as they become insti-
tutionalized (Hagedorn
2009
)
. Asian crime groups
cloak their criminal identities in the guise of legit-
imacy and benign sociality by penetrating into
politics and to uphold some sense of “Mianzi” or
“face” (Chin and Godson
2006
; Huisman
2008
)
.
The triads, yakuza, and jok-pok have been known
to invest in legitimate businesses such as bars,
restaurants, hotels, casinos, and the entertainment
industry (e.g.,
ﬁ
lm production companies; talent
scout agencies) (Chu
2005
; Edwards and Levi

2008
)
. They also have been known to be involved
in semi-legitimate
businesses such as debt collection
companies, security
ﬁ
rms, consulting companies,
nightclubs, and loan companies (Huang
2006
;
Litner
2004
)
. These businesses are used to
increase their economic capital, expand their
empire, and
ﬁ
nancially support their illegitimate
activities. Edwards and Levi
(
2008
) and Chin

(
1996
) state in their research that Asian organized
crime groups use these businesses as fronts for
illicit businesses such as protection rackets and
extorting local independent Asian businesses.

To operate in both transnational and locally
based legitimate and illegitimate markets, Asian
organized crime groups have effectively used
intimidation, threats, and violence against other
criminal syndicates, criminal entrepreneurs, law
enforcement, and government of
ﬁ
cials or the
general public (Chu
2005
; Lindberg et al.
1998
).
The use of violence creates absolute power that
protects and establishes control of monopolistic
enterprises (Huang
2006
; Xia
2008
)
. This control
is commonly done through shootings, kidnap-
pings, assassinations, car bombings, assaults, and
intimidation (Litner
2004
; Lo
2010
)
. For exam-
ple, in the 1990s, Asian gangsters intimidated
individuals and actors to gain control of the
ﬁ
lm
and entertainment industry (Chu
2005
)
. One of
the most prominent forms of violent crimes com-
mitted by Asian organized crime groups is that of
extortion, as gang members intimidate and
threaten violence for “money” (e.g., protection
fees) and political considerations (Chin
1996
)
.

Asian organized crime groups also engage in
intra-gang and intergang violence. Intra-gang
violence is based on the strict codes of conduct
and oath allegiances, as members are obligated to
remain faithful to their groups based on fear of
severe gang discipline (Zhang and Chin
2003
;
Bolz
1995
). Intergang violence is more frequent
as violence can erupt due to disrespect, settling
con
ﬂ
icts, and eliminating competitors from
speci
ﬁ
c markets (Chin
1996
)
. However, Asian
organized crime groups try to avoid violence all
together as it provides unwanted attention that
could disrupt gang activities (Joe
1994
)
.

The methods employed by Asian crime groups
have also affected government as well. Graft and
bribery of public of
ﬁ
cials for “favors” has resulted


70
P.T. Lankin and P.C. Shon
in what has been termed “protective umbrellas”
(Van Duyne
1996

)
. A “protective umbrella” is
made up of corrupt members of political parties,
army of
ﬁ
cials, and the police, who often cooper-
ate and provide favors and privileged information
to Asian organized crime syndicates; known as
“black gold politics” (Huang
2006
; Zhang and
Chin
2008
; Lo
2010
)
, public of
ﬁ
cials in turn
receive cash, drugs, lavish dinners, and sexual
favors from crime groups in exchange for
con
ﬁ
dential information. The effect of “protec-
tive umbrellas” is to weaken the state’s legitimacy
as the government has protected criminal enter-
prises by providing
ﬁ
nancial support and politi-
cal information to these organized crime groups
(Chin and Godson
2006
; Huang
2006
; Xia
2008
)
.
It has been shown that Asian organized crime
groups have cooperated with members of politi-
cal parties by providing services such as kidnap-
ping and assassinations and in return for some
legal leeway which allows them to operate with
immunity (Litner
2004
)
. For example, if orga-
nized crime syndicates in Hong Kong are deemed
patriotic and concerned with Hong Kong’s pros-
perity, they are given patriotic immunity in the
crimes they commit despite the fact they pose a
long-term social, political, and economic threat
(Bolz
1995
; Lo
2010
)
.

Triads, yakuza, and jok-pok have always been
in the public spotlight because of the menacing
ways they are portrayed in
ﬁ
lm and in the media.
However, in reality, most gangsters are less color-
ful than the portrayals in Asian gangster cinema
(Litner
2004
)
. For instance, some have contended
that the Asian
ﬁ
lm industry has offered glamor-
ized depictions of these secret societies of gang-
sters which has created myths and misconceptions
(Zhang and Chin
2003
)
. The media has often
accepted the exaggerated and stereotypical views
of Asian gangsters without reliable empirical evi-
dence which has contributed to the inconsisten-
cies reported in the literature (Zhang and Chin

2008
; Chin
1996
)
. Zhang and Chin
(
2008
) found
that Asian crime syndicates may be more of a
cultural icon in the media as they are only
involved in about 5–10% of all crimes. This

ﬁ
nding is consistent with Chu’s
(
2005
)
ﬁ
ndings
that most of the public in Asia do not feel like
their everyday lives are affected in any way by
Asian gangsters.

We contend that there needs to be serious
attention placed on Asian gangsters in cinema
to determine the validity of these portrayals for
several reasons. First, much of the existing
scholarly work inconsistently reports on the
types of illicit activities of Asian organized
crime syndicates, speci
ﬁ
cally those of human
smuggling and drug traf
ﬁ
cking. As there is no
universal consensus, Asian gangsters in cinema
play a signi
ﬁ
cant role in how the public per-
ceives organized crime groups and their activi-
ties, which may lead to the creation and
perpetuation of undue fear in the public (Chu

2005
)
. Second, scholars have often blamed the
media for manipulating the fear surrounding
Asian organized crime groups; however, no
scholarly work has examined how these gang-
ster
ﬁ
lms may perpetuate fear. This de
ﬁ
ciency
may be due to the lack of research that exam-
ines Asian organized gangs and their popular
representation. Gangster
ﬁ
lms may also create
unrealistic expectations of glamour and excite-
ment amongst marginalized adolescents who
may be allured to such thug life based on inac-
curate portrayals. It is therefore necessary to
examine if the portrayal of Asian gangsters
leads to the creation of fear and false expecta-
tions of good life in the viewing public. Third,
victims of Asian crime groups may be reluctant
to report their victimization (e.g., extortion) to
authorities or even family members (Chin

1996
)
; if the potential discourse around victim-
ization is shrouded in secrecy and threats, the

ﬁ
ctional criminal activities of gangsters in
ﬁ
lms
may be the only source of information about
the crime groups. It therefore behooves us to
examine the portrayals of Asian gangsters and
their illicit activities in cinema to discern the
public stereotypes such
ﬁ
lms may engender in
viewers. The purpose of this study is to build
upon previous literature by examining the
activities of Asian gangsters in
ﬁ
lm, their accu-
racy, and the effects such
ﬁ
lms may cultivate in
viewers.

Asian Gangsters in Cinema

Films exert an effect on two levels. At the macro-
level, they critique society, its ills, and evils; at
the micro-level, they proffer identi
ﬁ
cation

fantasies for individual viewers (Black
1991
)
.
That is,
ﬁ
lms in general, and crime and justice

ﬁ
lms in particular, criticize the way the govern-
ments and criminal justice systems mistreat their
citizens and prisoners, or illuminate tyranny and
police abuse of power;
ﬁ
lms may also invite
viewers to relish the heroic and yet de
ﬁ
ant nature
of an outlaw or a rogue hero. Films perform this
double move: they re
ﬂ
ect and reify culture and
ideology as culture (Rafter
2006
)
. Films are also
intensely private and secretive sources of emo-
tions, for each viewer must decipher the plot and
viscerally experience the emotions of the protag-
onists, antagonists, heroes, and antiheroes. That’s
why
ﬁ
lms allow viewers to experience joy, ela-
tion, fear, and repulsion. Some have argued that
such emotions can be replicated on a national
level. For instance, national speci
ﬁ
c cinemas pro-
duce cultural myths and identi
ﬁ
cation structures
that reinvigorate a sense of nostalgia and com-
munity in the viewers (Park
2002
)
. Yet, despite
such private character of
ﬁ
lms’ intent and enjoy-
ment, they are also public in another way in that
they are shaped by social, economic, and political
forces external to the
ﬁ
lms themselves.

For example, scholars have noted that the
tenor of yakuza movies changed from pre-WWII
assembly line production movies with no
de
ﬁ
nitive national identity to ones that attempted
to af
ﬁ
rm a positive and strong sense of Japanese
identity in the wake of defeat in WWII (Schilling

2003
)
. Yakuza movies portrayed gangsters as
mythopoeic
ﬁ
gures, solitary rule breakers lead-
ing a lonely existence, with the aim of being rein-
tegrated back into society. Honk Kong
ﬁ
lms, too,
experienced such a shift (Lu
1997
)
. Films that
were produced out of one major production com-
pany repeatedly portrayed male
ﬁ
gures who were
mired in an unexplainable supernatural force and
attempting to extricate themselves from it (Pang

2002
)
. Rather than the con
ﬁ
dence and bravado
exhibited by earlier characters in previous cine-
matic periods (Lu
1997
)
, Pang
(
2002
) notes that
Milky Way
ﬁ
lms of the 1990s showed anxiety;
such a trend in the storylines of
ﬁ
lms re
ﬂ
ects the
cultural and economic uncertainty following the
Asian
ﬁ
nancial crisis of the 1990s.

The recent successes of Korean directors and

ﬁ
lms, such as Park Chan-wook and
Oldboy
, on
the international circuit also highlight the role of
extraneous factors that affect the quality and con-
tent of
ﬁ
lms (Shim
2006
)
. The history of
ﬁ
lms in
Korea illustrates the external factors and their
impact on the contents and quality of
ﬁ
lm rather
well. Korean
ﬁ
lms were heavily censored by the
Korean Government of
ﬁ
cials until the late 1990s
(Park
2002
)
. Only after the directors were released
from the tyranny of censorship did international
blockbusters such as
JSA and
Shiri emerge from
the Korean cinema landscape (Doherty
1984
;
Park
2002
)
.

That is to say that government censorship of

ﬁ
lms and other works of art is, in turn, tied to
political stability. Dictatorships and authoritarian
regimes—governments that are not democrati-
cally formed—worry that artistic content that
criticizes and challenges the regime’s legitimacy
will lead to political unrest, which then they must
repress using coercion. Again, South Korea is a
good example. Under the totalitarian regime of
Park and Chun,
ﬁ
lms that criticized the govern-
ment in any way were censored (Lee
1980
; Suh

1982
)
. Only when this government control of arts
was lifted did creative works emerge. Thus, the
nexus between
ﬁ
lm, society, culture, and govern-
ment is intertwined in complex ways that mutu-
ally reinforce one another. Films can be sources
of enjoyment, but they can also be the impetus for
political protest and insurrection. Other scholars
have already attested to the perception altering
effects of crime programs (Dowler et al.
2006
;
Paulsen
2002
; Websdale and Alvarez
1998
)
. This
leads us to ask what viewers of Asian gangster

ﬁ
lms might see. How are such
ﬁ
lms likely to
affect viewers? To answer that question, this
study analyzed
ﬁ
lms in the gangster genre in the
respective countries of China (Hong Kong),
Japan, and Korea.


72
P.T. Lankin and P.C. Shon

All of the
ﬁ
lms viewed were foreign language

ﬁ
lms that had English subtitles. One of the authors
happened to be an Asian gangster
ﬁ
lm a
ﬁ
cionado
who selected
ﬁ
lms that would portray the most
plausible, realistic, and authentic representations
of triads, yakuza, and jok-pok. Asian gangster

ﬁ
lms in particular are a genre that is quite limited
in popularity and viewership. Consequently, little
is understood by outsiders concerning the catego-
ries of Asian gangster
ﬁ
lms outside of their
respective countries, much less to the wider,
international, English-speaking viewers. With the
predominance of Western culture in cinematog-
raphy, authentic Asian gangster
ﬁ
lms are suscep-
tible to be ignored or disregarded by non-Asian
viewers as they may encounter dif
ﬁ
culties in
understanding and relating to the characters in
the
ﬁ
lm due to cultural differences and biases.
Despite this limitation, a handful of the
ﬁ
lms in
this study have received some international rec-
ognition, and are highly acclaimed by zealous
movie a
ﬁ
cionados. For this study, we selected,
viewed, and coded this genre of often neglected

ﬁ
lms, with particular attention being paid to the
legitimate and illegitimate pursuits of the crime
groups, as well as the characteristics and features
of violent acts. In the following sections we dis-
cuss two themes that emerged from the unmoti-
vated viewings, and which require further scrutiny
based on limitations reported in previous works:
the varieties of illicit activities of triads, yakuza,
and jok-pok, and the characteristics of violence
used in the
ﬁ
lm.

5.3.1
Illicit Activities of Asian
Gangsters in Film

The illicit activities depicted in triad, yakuza, and
jok-pok movies demonstrate the full range of
illicit activities of Asian gangsters in the
ﬁ
lms, in
ways that are consistent with those reported in
the literature on Asian organized crime groups
(Bolz
1995
; Berry et al.
2003
; Chin
1996
;
Finckenauer and Chin
2006
; Hughes et al.
2007
;
Huang
2006
; Kelly et al.
1993a,
b
; Lindberg et al.

1998
)
. International drug traf
ﬁ
cking in particular
was a recurring and popular theme throughout
the gangster
ﬁ
lms in all three of the countries
examined.

The Hong Kong-based
ﬁ
lm
Protégé (Chan

2007
) explicitly examines the international her-
oin trade as it relates to the Golden Triangle, as
well as the moral con
ﬂ
ict that the hero (Nick)
faces and attempts to resolve. The
ﬁ
lm opens
with voice-over narrative asking the question
why people use drugs. That question, as well as
the scene, brims with tension, almost echoing the
inner con
ﬂ
ict of the principal character. The scene
begins with a close-up of Nick and then pans out
to an apartment which looks unkempt and dirty;
viewers then are treated to a panoramic shot of
Nick, only to discover that the person who has
posed that question is a uniformed police of
ﬁ
cer.

True to the form and character of cops/robbers
genre of Hong Kong style action
ﬁ
lms (i.e.,
Hard-
Boiled
), Nick is an undercover cop who has man-
aged to in
ﬁ
ltrate a crime group that specializes in
the production and distribution of heroin. Nick
manages to secure the trust of Quin, the leader,
and after a show of loyalty, he is named the next
successor. Viewers are led to experience Nick’s
struggle to be good (by ful
ﬁ
lling his police man-
date) or evil (by assuming his role as the next drug
king). But in addition to such individual moral
choices and con
ﬂ
icts that de
ﬁ
ne the hero’s role,
viewers are also treated to the elaborate and trans-
national character of the heroin trade in Asia.

Quin takes Nick to Bangkok and then Burma
to meet various warlords (e.g., Wa State, Shan
State) as part of his “apprenticeship.” Viewers see
that the Golden Triangle is controlled by a private
military that is
ﬁ
nanced by proceeds from the
international drug trade; Nick learns the supply
and demand side of the drug trade as the warlords
show Nick “World Drug Reports” prepared by
the United Nations that is used to forecast world-
wide demand and sales projections. Such depic-
tions of the Golden Triangle are consistent with
the literature as the individual warlords seen in
the
ﬁ
lm operating the transnational heroin trade
are not part of an organized crime syndicate
(Dupont
1999
)
. The drug warlords are merely
independent criminal entrepreneurs (Chin
2009
)
.
During this trip, Quin proffers advice to Nick that
is relevant to this study when he warns to “never

take risks” as there is “no room for error in this
trade.” This statement is similar to the literature,
as Asian organized crime syndicates forego trans-
national drug traf
ﬁ
cking due to the inherent risk,
which is why organized crime groups can be seen
traf
ﬁ
cking and distributing various narcotics
cross-nationally
rather
than
internationally
(Zhang and Chin
2003
)
.

In addition to the international character of the
drug trade, Protégé (Chan
2007
) also provides an
intricate and operational view of the situational
contingencies that drug distributors and produc-
ers must negotiate. Viewers are treated to the fact
that Nick’s out
ﬁ
t has established an elaborate
“runner system,” in addition to a highly disci-
plined and sophisticated communication protocol
(i.e., use of prepaid cell phones which are promptly
disposed after an operation) that is involved in the
distribution of narcotics as a way of eluding police
detection and seizure. This tactical “runner sys-
tem” shows members of Quin’s organized crime
group engaging in sophisticated countersurveil-
lance and anti-surveillance measures such as
changing carriers and cars repeatedly to ensure
that the heroin reaches its destination.

The use of such a “runner system” is a reality,
as Levitt and Venkatest
(
2000
) state that the run-
ners have the risky task of avoiding police seizure
transporting large quantities of narcotics by what-
ever means necessary. This enterprise is fairly
elaborate as it has specialized workers known as
“head chefs” who manufacture the drug in gang-
operated warehouses to make distribution easier.
By employing skilled workers such as the “head
chefs” seen in the
ﬁ
lm, Edwards and Levi
(
2008
)
and Chu
(
2005
) corroborate the accuracy of the
movie’s portrayal as it allows them to success-
fully engage in drug traf
ﬁ
cking activities.

The
ﬁ
lm
Sympathy for the Underdog (Shundo
et al.
1971

)
depicts a yakuza gang leader (Gunji)
and his loyal followers who are forced out of
Tokyo and into the smaller town of Okinawa
after a failed assassination attempt on a boss
(Oba) of a more powerful sovereign yakuza gang
by one of Gunji’s men. In Okinawa, Gunji’s
yakuza gang attempts to af
ﬁ
rm his gang’s legiti-
macy by using threats, violence, coercion, and
the yakuza’s feared reputation to gain control of
various legal and illegal operations. Throughout
the
ﬁ
lm, various professional and nonprofes-
sional organized crime syndicates are seen dis-
cussing or participating in assorted ventures such
as protection rackets, illegal smuggling of
American alcohol, contract killings, operating of
brothels (e.g., exotic dancers and prostitution),
illegal gambling halls, entertainment businesses
(e.g., clubs), and local harbor. Greed and the
need for control over these competitive multimil-
lion-dollar industries are observed inducing vio-
lence or turf wars with other criminal enterprises
as each gang seeks dominance in speci
ﬁ
c mar-
kets that are usually restricted to speci
ﬁ
c gangs
or territories. As local Okinawan gangs feel
threatened and “squeezed out” of their once
dominant position in their business operations by
Gunji’s yakuzas, they call on Oba and the main-
land (Tokyo) yakuza to assist them to eliminate
this threat in order to regain control over their
markets and provide Oba with the opportunity
for revenge for the attempt on his life.

These illicit activities are also prevalent in
such Japanese yakuza
ﬁ
lms such as
Street Mobster
and
Pale Flower
. The
ﬁ
lm
Pale Flower (Iwatsuki
et al.
1964
) illustrates the daily operations of an
illegal gambling hall. A yakuza gangster (Muraki)
mentors and collaborates with his love interest
(Saeko) in cheating other yakuza gangsters in
high stakes games for large
ﬁ
nancial gains. This
relationship leads to a destructive and deadly out-
come as Saeko’s need for excitement results in
her inevitable demise. Gambling dens and more
sophisticated, elaborate activities are also por-
trayed in the
ﬁ
lm
Street Mobster
. In
Street
Mobster (Fukasaku
1972
)
, a yakuza gangster
(Isamu Okita) tries to reestablish his standing
with his boss (Yato) and an aspiring gangster
(Kizaki). Isamu is recently released from prison,
only to
ﬁ
nd a signi
ﬁ
cantly advanced criminal
world than that when he received his prison sen-
tence. Throughout the
ﬁ
lm, Isamu can be seen
trying to restore his yakuza gang’s dominance in
markets as they actively involve themselves in
competitive markets such as gambling dens,
extortion rackets, kidnapping, procuring women
for brothels, and operating semi-legitimate enter-
tainment businesses (e.g., bars and clubs). Similar


74
P.T. Lankin and P.C. Shon
to the
ﬁ
lm
Sympathy for the Underdog
, Isamu
failed to adapt to the changing ways of the yakuza.
He resorts to physical and violent encounters
with opposing gangs who also strive for control
and power which ultimately results in the death
of Isamu.

The depictions in all three of the noted Japanese
yakuza
ﬁ
lms provided accurate and consistent
portrayals of yakuza’s illicit activities in relation
to the literature. The effective visual representa-
tions of the yakuza’s use of violence, threats, and
intimidation against other criminal syndicates
allow for these gangs to operate in their varied and
extensive sophisticated multimillion-dollar indus-
tries as stated by Chu
(

2005

)
and Lindberg et al.
(
1998
). These criminal tactics allow the gang to
protect and establish power and dominance over
their monopolistic enterprises by effectively miti-
gating future threats or competition (Huang
2006
;
Xia
2008

)
. Such practices allow the various
yakuza families to successfully manage and
control their gambling dens, extortion rackets,
kidnapping, and trading of women for entertain-
ment industries, as shown in
ﬁ
lms, speci
ﬁ
cally

Sympathy for the Underdog (Bolz
1995
; Kelly
et al.
1993a,
b
; Lindberg et al.

)
.

A South Korean
ﬁ
lm that focused on orga-
nized crime drug enterprises is the classic gang-
ster
ﬁ
lm
Friend (Seok and Kwak
2001
)
. In the

ﬁ
lm, Joon-Suk and Dong-Su are best friends who
grew up in the same neighborhood, both admir-
ing the lifestyle of Joon-Suk’s father who is a
powerful boss in a local organized crime group.
As the years pass, they lose contact and join sepa-
rate organized crime groups. Joon-Suk assumes
the role of a leader of a criminal organization
after the passing of his father, while Dong-Su
becomes a powerful leader of Joon-Suk’s rival
organization. The potential con
ﬂ
ict between the
two principal characters is set.

In the
ﬁ
lm, Joon-Suk’s crime group engages
in illegal deep-sea
ﬁ
shing (e.g., shark
ﬁ
ns) while
Dong-Su’s group participates in illegal bidding
through extortion in the construction trade; Dong-
Su’s group also specializes in traf
ﬁ
cking and dis-
tribution of Philopon. Despite having shared
commonalities when growing up, both Joon-Suk
and Dong-Su are now involved in a competitive
and rival crime groups, putting business before
past friendship. Such a capitalistic view of rela-
tionships is consistent with the literature as
Dupont
(
1999
) stated that high demand makes
Asian crime groups actively participate and com-
pete in the market. Both gangs in the
ﬁ
lm
acknowledge that this business is very gang-
oriented and monopolistic.

The sophisticated drug enterprise is re
ﬂ
ected
in the Hong Kong blockbuster
Infernal Affairs
(Lau et al.
2002
) as well. Philosophically, the
ﬁ
lm
deals with the battle between good and evil, duty
versus desire; such a moral debate is contextual-
ized in the lives of an undercover cop who is
planted as a mole in the triads and a triad member
who is planted as a mole in the police force. The

ﬁ
lm unfurls the war, violence, and con
ﬂ
ict
between the police and the triads over the organi-
zation’s illicit activities, between forces of good
and evil. The main premise of this movie is that
both the police and the triads have in
ﬁ
ltrated each
other’s organizations. Lau King Ming is an
inspector in the police working undercover for
triad leader Hon Sam. Lau is paid to tip Sam off
to any raids or other police activity. However,
Superintendent Wong Chi Shing also has pene-
trated Hon Sam’s crime group with an undercover
of
ﬁ
cer (Chen Wing-Yan). Triad boss Sam can be
seen in the
ﬁ
lm operating a strict enterprise where
Chen is forced to sniff and taste the powder to
ensure that it is the best quality to traf
ﬁ
c and dis-
tribute. In the
ﬁ
lm, once the quality of the narcot-
ics has been veri
ﬁ
ed by members, the triads begin
importing shipments of “AA + Cocaine” from
Thailand. Despite being tipped off by Chen, Sam
monitors police channels to ensure the protection
of his enterprise from the police.

A Bittersweet Life (Park et al.
2005
) depicts
the violence that surrounds a gang’s illicit busi-
nesses. The main character, Kim Sun-Woo, is an
enforcer and manager of Mr. Kang’s (boss) hotel.
As an enforcer, he ensures the protection and
security of the organized crime group’s legiti-
mate and illegitimate enterprises against com-
peting rival gangs. This criminal organization
owns and operates the hotel where it employs
Russian and Filipino women as “dancers” for
their clubs, entertainment businesses, and prosti-


75
5 Triad, Yakuza, and Jok-Pok: Asian Gangsters in Cinema
tution. Through legitimate “front” businesses
such as the hotel, they are able to increase their
revenue while being able to discretely transfer
money without suspicion. According to Chu

(
2005
) and Edwards and Levi
(
2008
)
, Asian
organized crime groups have been known to
be involved in legitimate and semi-legitimate
businesses such as bars and restaurants which is
consistent with the
ﬁ
lm’s portrayal. However, as
Sun-Woo’s boss says, “You can do a hundred
things right, but do one thing wrong and it can
destroy you.” This may be why the gang is not
seen involved in the narcotics market, as the
risks are too great.

The
ﬁ
lm
Failan (Ahn and Song
2001
) is a love
story told through the life of a petty Korean gang-
ster (Lee Kang-Jae). Lee Kang-Jae is a loser in all
sense of the word. He is old, but garners none of
the respect of a person his age; although he is the
longest serving member of his gang, even his
juniors will not show him the proper deference.
In fact, the opening scene shows Kang-Jae com-
ing home to a
ﬁ
lthy apartment (after he is released
from jail for having sold pornography to a minor)
that he shares with his fellow gang member; as
part of his homecoming, his roommate tells him
that he has been demoted to a bouncer in the bar/
nightclub that his crime group operates. The
illicit activities of Kang-Jae’s crime group are
revealed when a female character, Failan, is
introduced.

One of the illicit money-making schemes that
Kang-Jae’s group engages in is providing women
to bars and nightclubs as hostesses. Kang-Jae’s
group operates an employment agency as a front,
which then provides falsi
ﬁ
ed documents to the
women; to extend the women’s stay in the host
country, the crime group uses its members to
fraudulently marry the women to provide them
with permanent residency status. The nominative
husband is paid a kickback for his services while
the crime group “sells” the women to bars, night-
clubs, and any employer who is willing to pay
upfront the large sum of money spent to carry out
the operation, plus the pro
ﬁ
ts. Although the pri-
mary storyline unfolds between Kang-Jae and
Failan, the
ﬁ
lm provides a fairly sophisticated
account of illegal and exploitive labor practices
as well as traf
ﬁ
cking of women. The
ﬁ
lm thus at
least partially corroborates the
ﬁ
ndings of previ-
ous works which claim that crime groups’
involvement is an integral component of the
human smuggling and traf
ﬁ
cking business at
some level (Chin
1999
; Kwong
1997
)
.

5.3.2
Violence

Throughout nearly all of the movies examined,
there were countless—too many to count—
depictions of assaults, stabbings, and murder. In
the gangster
ﬁ
lm
Friend (Seok and Kwak
2001
)
,
the reputation of jok-pok’s penchant for violence
and the fear they instill is clearly visible when a
teacher who disciplines Joon-Suk by lashing him
with a stick realizes his faux pas. When the
teacher realizes that Joon-Suk’s father is a jok-
pok (Korean organized crime group)
doo-mok
(leader), he quickly regrets his actions as he fears
violent retaliation. The effect of a reputation for
violence and the fear it generates ensure that their
members are not harassed; such an instrumental
view of a “badass” reputation is consistent with
the literature (Chu
2005
; Katz
1991
)
. Later in
life, as a mob war looms between Joon-Suk and
Dong-Su’s gangs, Joon-Suk can be seen in one
scene training gang recruits how to kill with a
knife, preparing them for “war.” However, even
though protection from one’s own gang is an inte-
gral part of being a gangster, it is not absolute, as
violence can be committed within the gang,
amongst themselves. Intra-gang violence is seen
depicted in
Friend when Dong-Su is betrayed
and murdered violently by his own men, as well
as his rivals, for not following protocol when
dealing with a vulnerable rival leader. Such depic-
tions are consistent with Zhang and Chin’s
(
2003
)

ﬁ
ndings that if leaders or members feel that the
gang’s code of conduct is broken at any time it
could result in immediate and severe discipline.

Respect and violence loom rather large in the
ethos of Asian gangsters. For example, when
Joon-Suk is asked why he did not deny ordering
the hit of his friend Dong-Su, despite the fact that
bribery had already been paid to court of
ﬁ
cials,
and all he had to do was deny that he knew the


76
P.T. Lankin and P.C. Shon
co-accused, he says: “That would have been
humiliating. Me and Dong-Su are gangsters.
Gangsters shouldn’t be humiliated.” Such a proc-
lamation is consistent with what Huisman
(
2008
)
stated when describing “Mianzi,” as gangsters try
and keep “face.” Losing face (“Mianzi”) is a prin-
cipal reason for violence in the
ﬁ
lm
Election
(Law et al.
2005
)
. As the respected elders of the
triad gang, known as “uncles,” vote and elect Lok
as the new leader, Big D loses the election and
seeks revenge on the elders who did not vote for
him. In one scene, Big D’s underlings kidnap two
of the elders who did not vote for him, put them
in a nailed crate, and roll them down a hill,
because when one loses an election it means loss
of “Mianzi.” This loss of face is why Big D seeks
retaliation for this perceived dishonor as he feels
the need to restore his honor within the gang.
However, Big D overcomes his bitterness when
Lok offers him a high position within the gang
which results in Big D showing his loyalty by
murdering betrayers within the gang to promote
Lok’s supremacy. Despite this loyalty, and oaths
of allegiance to the triad code, Lok murders both
Big D and his wife after Lok
ﬁ
nds out of a previ-
ous assassination plot by Big D. Such a turn of
events is consistent with previous works which
state that strict discipline is associated with break-
ing the loyalty oaths, and as Lok states in the

ﬁ
lm, “loyalty aside, you should put yourself
ﬁ
rst”
(Zhang and Chin
2003
)
.

Intra-gang and intergang violence is a com-
mon theme in Asian gangster cinema as seen in
the
ﬁ
lm
A Bittersweet Life (Park et al.
2005
)
which depicts the violence that surrounds a gang’s
illicit businesses. The use of enforcers like Kim
Sun-Woo is consistent with Levitt and Venkatest’s

(
2000
)
ﬁ
ndings that enforcers are used to ensure
that the gang’s criminal businesses are protected
through violence, threat, and intimidation. The

ﬁ
lm depicts multiple portrayals of intergang vio-
lence as Sun-Woo is constantly
ﬁ
ghting with his
gang’s rival, speci
ﬁ
cally Baek Jr. Previous litera-
ture has stated that violence erupts in settling
con
ﬂ
icts and eliminating competitors, and the
storyline behind
Bittersweet Life
attests to the
potential for intergang violence (Chin
1996
)
. In
one scene, Sun-Woo and another gang member
engage in a violent altercation with Baek Jr.’s
men for overstaying their welcome in their hotel.
For doing this Baek Jr. orders that Sun-woo
apologize.

When Sun-Woo refuses to apologize, he is fol-
lowed back to his residence, severely beaten, tor-
tured, and buried alive, but manages to survive
this ordeal. When Sun-woo discovers that his
own Boss Kang was involved in his beating for
not following orders, he feels betrayed. This
betrayal causes Sun-Woo to seek out another
organized crime group who dealt speci
ﬁ
cally in
arms traf
ﬁ
cking to exact revenge. When Sun-
Woo’s motives are discovered by the gun dealer,
a shoot-out erupts, with Sun-Woo killing every-
one. In the end there is a violent altercation,
resulting in the deaths of Baek Jr., Kang, multiple
underlings, and eventually the death of Sun-Woo,
but not before completing his revenge. Although
Chin
(
1996

)
states that intergang violence is more
frequent, several of the
ﬁ
lms provide rather visual
representations of intra-gang violence, while only
a few depict intergang violence.

Violence in Asian gangster cinema is not lim-
ited to intra- and intergang violence. The
ﬁ
lm

Infernal Affairs (Lau et al.
2002
) bases itself on
the war and violence between the police and the
triads. The triads in the
ﬁ
lm also are involved in
frequent shoot-outs with police, police chases,
and murder. The triads in this
ﬁ
lm murder
Superintendent Wong Chi Shing by severely
beating him and throwing him off a roof when he
fails to reveal the identity of his undercover
of
ﬁ
cer. Based on the
ﬁ
lm, it can be perceived that
violence, murder, and death are very prominent
in organized crime. This pattern can further be
seen in the movie as Mr. Lau ends up killing his
boss Sam, Chen, and other gang informants to
protect his identity and self-interests. As Berry
et al.
(
2002
) put it, sometimes money, power, and
self-interest are where the gangsters’ loyalty lies.
This
ﬁ
lm is consistent with Litner
(
2004
) and
Lo’s
(
2010
)
ﬁ
ndings that shoot-outs with law
enforcement, murders, and assaults are the most
commonly used approach to ensure protection of
their illicit activities from police intervention.
Japanese yakuza gangster
ﬁ
lms often sensation-
alize and glamorize the violent lifestyle of the


77
5 Triad, Yakuza, and Jok-Pok: Asian Gangsters in Cinema
yakuza through graphic visual representations
that include shootings, stabbings, assaults, assas-
sinations, and bombings, resulting in multiple
deaths. In the
ﬁ
lm entitled
Yakuza Demon (Naitô
and Miike
2003
)
, a small time (three members)
yakuza family called the Muto family of the Date
clan attacked the top echelon of the dominant
Tendo yakuza family. The outcome resulted in
the Tendo family seeking revenge on the much
smaller Muto family. Seiji the “Ripper” is a mem-
ber of the Muto family who planned and orches-
trated the murder plots of the Tendo bosses which
resulted in devastating carnage through the use of
automatic weapons, shotguns, and bombs. Seiji’s
boss, Muto, who had no knowledge or involve-
ment in the plot is attacked, beaten, and killed
while he was incarcerated. Yoshi, the other mem-
ber of the Muto family, is shot and killed while at
the beach. Seiji’s friend, who supplied him with
weapons, is discovered hanging from a crane and
eventually Seiji is murdered in an onslaught of
gun
ﬁ
re while attempting to
ﬂ
ee on a boat in order
to save his life. However, Muto’s wife is allowed
to live because, as one gangster stated, “we
shouldn’t kill women, we should fuck them.”
Despite this, violence against women is still seen
in Japanese gangster
ﬁ
lms, as shown in
Street
Mobster when Isamu’s “girlfriend” is shot and
killed alongside him by the rival yakuza gang
(Fukasaku
1972
)
. In Japanese yakuza
ﬁ
lms, mur-
der is not restricted by sex or gender.

Violence is predominant in other Japanese
yakuza
ﬁ
lms such as
Sonatine and
Sympathy for
the Underdog
. In
Sonatine (Mori et al.
2003
) a
yakuza leader (Murakawa), along with some sub-
ordinates, is ordered to go to Okinawa to assist
allies who are currently in a war with a rival
yakuza gang. The importance of the war is down-
played at the beginning of the
ﬁ
lm, yet, through-
out the
ﬁ
lm, Murakawa and his Yakuza soldiers
repeatedly come under
ﬁ
re from the opposing
group in their residences, bars, and on the beaches
of Okinawa. Eventually all of Murakawa’s friends
and allies are killed. The movie culminates in a
gun battle at the opposing gang’s compound, with
Murakawa emerging the victor. Ultimately
Murakawa commits suicide. This outcome is sim-
ilar to
Sympathy for the Underdog (Shundo et al.

1971
) as after Gunji and his associates were run
out of Tokyo, they reacted with violence, shoot-
ings, and stabbings in order to create fear and
intimidation in order to regain control over their
illicit operations, which is consistent with the lit-
erature (Huang
2006
; Xia
2008
)
. The constant
con
ﬂ
ict in this
ﬁ
lm is similar to Chin’s
(
1996
)

ﬁ
ndings that intergang violence is often necessary
to settle con
ﬂ
icts or eliminate competitors from
speci
ﬁ
c markets. When the head of the mainland
yakuza family discovers where Gunji is located,
he seeks out the help of local Okinawa gangs,
resulting in a
ﬁ
nal shoot-out. This battle resulted
in the deaths of Gunji and his soldiers as well as
Oba and the leadership of the mainland yakuza.

Rather than basing these
ﬁ
lms strictly on their
illicit enterprises, Asian gangster
ﬁ
lms have often
glamorized violence, as exaggerated violence in

ﬁ
lms perpetuates fear and chaos in communities
where Asian criminal organizations operate.
Literature has shown authentic Asian organized
crime groups use violence, threats, and intimida-
tion to protect their illicit enterprises, while Asian
gangster
ﬁ
lms seem to emphasize violence to
provide entertainment and excitement (Chu

2005
)
. Such an assertion is inconsistent with Joe’s

(
1994
)
ﬁ
ndings which indicate that violence is
only used when necessary to protect the business
ventures because it can signi
ﬁ
cantly hinder pro
ﬁ
t
by bringing unwanted attention on the gang.


5.4
Cultivating Inaccurate
Stereotypes About Asian
Gangsters

Our examination of Asian gangsters in cinema, as
it pertains to their legitimate and illegitimate
activities and violence, found that the violence
depicted in the
ﬁ
lms dominates over the portrayal
of their business ventures. Although the
ﬁ
lms did
portray legitimate and illegitimate business activ-
ities, the majority of the
ﬁ
lms signi
ﬁ
cantly down-
played their importance to the point where they
almost become auxiliary. From a
ﬁ
lmmaker’s
point of view, representations of the details of a
crime group’s business activities may not allure
viewers to the universalizable aspects of storytell-


78
P.T. Lankin and P.C. Shon
ing. There is, after all, nothing sexy or glamorous
about counting money or bragging about tenfold
increase in pro
ﬁ
ts for various crime groups.
However, that omission may serve to cultivate the
viewer’s perceptions in a particular way.

As previously noted, almost all of the
ﬁ
lms
dealt with drug traf
ﬁ
cking and distribution as the
prominent source of income for organized crime
groups in Hong Kong and South Korea. Other
crimes that were depicted in these
ﬁ
lms showed
brief representations of prostitution, gambling,
arms traf
ﬁ
cking, loan sharking, and protection
rackets. All of the depictions of their businesses
in
ﬁ
lm are consistent with the literature (Bolz

1995
; Berry et al.
2003
; Chin
1996
; Finckenauer
and Chin
2006
; Hughes et al.
2007
; Huang
2006
;
Kelly et al.
1993a,
b
; Lindberg et al.
1998
; Song
and Dombrink
1994
)
. However, when comparing
the
ﬁ
lms’ depictions with the literature, there is a
lack of substantial coverage of other illicit activi-
ties of actual organized crime groups, such as
contract killings, kidnapping for ransom, armed
robbery, fraud, and trading of women and minors
(Bolz
1995
; Berry et al.
2003
; Huang
2006
)
.

By sensationalizing and focusing only a few
types of violent and illicit activities, the
ﬁ
lms
ignore that these organized crime groups operate
a highly secretive, sophisticated, and structured
syndicate in various legitimate and illegitimate
markets. If the public were to take the
ﬁ
lms as
accurate portrayals of the gang’s activities, then
such representations may create misconceptions
about the actual activities of the gangs in a larger
context. Viewers may conclude that the harms
produced by the gangs may be minimal. The
directors of each
ﬁ
lm seem more interested in
providing sensational entertainment at the cost of
realism. But then again,
ﬁ
lmmakers are not docu-
mentary makers.

The
ﬁ
ndings reported here are consistent with
Litner’s
(
2004
) and Zhang and Chin’s
(
2003
)
comment that Asian gangsters were less colorful
in their portrayals in cinema. Our study indicates
that violence in Asian gangster cinema permeates
across national boundaries and cultures, which
could result in potentially misleading perceptions
that these groups pose a threat to the safety and
well-being of the citizens in the gang areas of
in
ﬂ
uence. Through repeated depictions of brutal-
ity, murder, torture, assault, and
ﬁ
ghting in the

ﬁ
lms, people may automatically accept all of
these crime groups to be problematic for society
as these
ﬁ
lms help validate public fear. Due to the
extreme nature of the visually graphic violence in
Asian gangster cinema, the
ﬁ
lms manipulate and
perpetuate fear, thereby making viewers suscep-
tible to perceived stereotypes of traditional orga-
nized crime syndicates (Finckenauer and Chin

2006
; Kelly et al.
1993a,
b
; Lindberg et al.
1998
)
.
Another perspective may be that the hyperbolic
forms of violence may shape the attitudes and
perceptions of viewers in the opposite direction.

Our work indicates that despite the manifold
array of illegal enterprises of triads, yakuza, and
jok-pok in the
ﬁ
lms, the visual representation of
violence is what leaves a lasting impression in
the cinematic experience of the viewers. The type
of violence that we found is something that is
qualitatively different from Western
ﬁ
lms in the
same genre. Using again the classic Korean gang-
ster movie
Friend as an example, Joon-Suk sets
up Dong-Su to be killed by his men as well as one
of his own lieutenants. In that scene, as Dong-Su
is about to enter his car, his trusted lieutenant
grabs him from the rear while another stabs him
in the back with a “
ﬁ
sh knife” (the most com-
monly used weapon in Korean gangster movies);
as Dong-Su
ﬁ
ghts off his attacker and attempts to
run away, he is attacked again by another gang-
ster assigned to complete the killing.

Dong-Su is stabbed no less than twenty-nine
times, three from an overhand hacking motion
and the rest in a direct frontal thrust to the stom-
ach; at one point, viewers are treated to the sound
of the blade making dull noises against the con-
crete post, as the blade enters and exits the
ﬂ
esh
and makes contact with the concrete post that
Dong-Su is leaning on as he is being stabbed; the
attacker is carrying out the killing in a scared
frenzy. Dong-Su senses that fear and the nervous
energy of a
ﬁ
rst-time killer, and tells him, as he
lay dying, “You’ve done enough; I’ve eaten
enough.” That is, you have stabbed me enough
times for me to die; you have done your job well.

from his body, there is no glamour in the life of a
gangster. There is only the brutality, the coldness
of the blade, and the relentless pouring of rain—
death. That is the moral message that is etched
into the minds of viewers.

The same message is conveyed to the audi-
ence in
Breathless
(Jang and Yang
2009
)
.
Although the title given is “breathless,” the actual
meaning in Korean translates, literally, to
“shit
ﬂ
y”; that title most felicitously re
ﬂ
ects the
life of Korean jok-poks who earn their money by
serving as muscle for politicians and wealthy
business owners who need to clear out destitute
residents out of slums to make way for new con-
dominiums.
Breathless
tells the story of Sang-
Woon, a petty Korean gangster who works for
his friend, a loan shark; and throughout the
movie, viewers get a glimpse of the underside of
Korean gangsters and the people from whom
such gangsters eke out a living: poor, miserable
men addicted to gambling who have squandered
away their fortunes and incurred the debts of
loan sharks. In this raw, in-your-face look at
gangster life in Korea, we again see the terminus
of that life: Sang-Woon is
ﬁ
rst struck on the head
with a hammer by an unruly client who cannot
pay; and when he exercises compassion and
decides to come back another day, his underling
uses the same hammer and strikes him on the
head repeatedly until he dies; but before Sang-
Woon dies, viewers are treated to the gurgling
sounds of blood caught in his throat, as he is
struggling to utter his last words: “I have to be
somewhere.” The pathetic life and death of a
gangster who feeds on the bottom of society are
visually articulated in that scene of death. There
is no glamour; there is no glory; there is only the
gurgling sound of blood caught in Sang-Woon’s
throat, and the
ﬂ
ies that will feast on his death.
There is no hero to be found anywhere. This
absence of a hero is one way that Asian gangster

ﬁ
lms differ from their Western counterparts
(Rafter
2006
)
.

To claim that gangster movies may unduly
in
ﬂ
uence youths to be drawn toward gangster life
as a result of glamorization of gangsters seems a
bit premature and dif
ﬁ
cult to understand, for
there is little that is glamorous about gangster life
as indicated from our work. Asian gangster mov-
ies may make the top bosses look enviable with
their
ﬂ
ashy suits and nice cars, but the life of
gangster underlings, and even gang
dai-los
,

oyabuns
,
doo-moks
, and
hyoung-nims meet the
same fate as their subordinates, an ignominious
and impersonal death from a
ﬁ
sh knife or a gun.
Again, there is little that is admirable or glamor-
ous about being betrayed and stabbed to death by
a trusted subordinate if one is a boss. There is
little honor in betrayal.

5.5
Future Trends

If Asian gangster movies glorify and glamorize
gangsters and their life, as some researchers have
claimed (Yin
2009
; Chin and Godson
2006

)
, such

ﬁ
ndings may be explained by the presence of a
distinct style. The triads, yakuza, and jok-pok in
all of the
ﬁ
lms had a unique language of their own,
a speech pattern and vocabulary of motive, and
style that marked them as such; furthermore, they
all had a stylish manner of dress and comportment
in ways that signi
ﬁ
ed their identity as a “badass.”
Their body markings—scars and tattoos—bore
the corporeal evidence of a life of agonistic strug-
gle and triumph. Finally, the gangster
ﬁ
lms dra-
matized and foregrounded the relationships among
men, qua men, and as brothers, and constructed
the men as masculine subjects, without the stereo-
type and prejudice embedded in white-dominated
Western
ﬁ
lms. That is, the Chinese, Korean, and
Japanese men played the part of men, as men. In
that sense, it is that image of a masculine
ﬁ
gure
that may be the primary source of attraction for
disenchanted and marginalized youths across
Asia, and not necessarily the gratuitous violence
in the
ﬁ
lms. The pursuit of masculinity and the
ethos and rituals of being an Asian gangster may
be worth pursuing in the future.

The
ﬁ
lms that we chose for this project were
selectively sampled; there are literally hundreds
of
ﬁ
lms in the particular genre that present the
activities of triads, yakuza, and jok-pok. For
future works, a more comprehensive review of

ﬁ
lms would add an additional empirical bite to
this exploratory project. Such a project, if carried


80
P.T. Lankin and P.C. Shon
out properly, may be used to verify the authentic-
ity of such
ﬁ
lms as well. But much more impor-
tantly, these types of
ﬁ
lms may be one way to
reach out to disaffected youths who may be con-
templating joining a gang; coupled with a former
gang-member-turned interventionist, the
ﬁ
lms
may be used as topics of focus groups to tell and
share the reality of gangster life to those who are
most likely to be wooed and targeted for

recruitment. Such a noble objective would not be
hyperbole or
ﬁ
ction.

5.6
Conclusion

We began this paper with the story of Q. Lu. He
met a fate similar to other
ﬁ
ctional gangsters cov-
ered in this paper: he met a cold and ignominious
death, stuffed inside a barrel and dumped into a
lake. The business activities of Asian gangsters in
the
ﬁ
lms appeared to be consistent with the

ﬁ
ndings from previous literature; the
ﬁ
lms
re
ﬂ
ected illicit businesses such as human smug-
gling, narcotics smuggling and distribution, and
loan sharking. Contrary to previous
ﬁ
ndings,
however, our work indicates that Asian gangster

ﬁ
lms do not seduce viewers to interpret gangster
life as one of glamour and excitement. In fact, we
have argued that the opposite may be true, for the
extent and gratuity of violence found throughout
the Asian gangster
ﬁ
lms militate against any
appeal to gang membership and gang life.
Fictional gangsters—and perhaps actual gang-
sters as well—end up in prison or die a cold and
brutal death. That may be the very moral message
originally intended by the
ﬁ
lmmakers, for art
appears to imitate life.

Introduction
1

The marriage of digital and networked technolo-
gies has resulted in the World Wide Web and the
cyberspace it creates being constructed of infor-
mational
ﬂ
ows that express ideas. It is the control
over the means by which these ideas are expressed
which lies at the heart of the various contempo-
rary debates over intellectual property, regardless
of jurisdiction. The products of the marriage of
digital and networked technologies are global
and they affect the Asian continent as much as
any other, with the possible exception of
Antarctica—for obvious reasons. Yet, under-
standings, especially in the West, of Asian juris-
dictions are pre-problematised and pre-sensitised
to the impacts of what are perceived as IP crimes
because of prior and broader concerns over their
relatively low enforcement of patents, trademarks
and copyright IP law by international trade part-
ners (mainly major western nations). Such con-
cerns are expressed through mechanisms such as
the US Special 301, which is an annual review of
intellectual property protection and market access
practices in foreign countries.
2 These concerns
are also embodied in the World Trade Organisation
(WTO) Trade-related aspects of Intellectual
Property Rights (TRIPS), which is a multilateral
international agreement on intellectual property.

In response to direct international pressure to
reform their IP regimes, Japan (Tessensohn and
Yamamoto
2005
) and Taiwan (Chiang
2012
) have
introduced specialist IP courts in 2005 and 2008,
respectively, to increase enforcement of IP law and
reduce litigation waiting times. The main concerns
of the IP courts are typically patents and copyright
(Chiang
2012

)
, but online IP issues, which are the
focus of this chapter, are quite
different in nature.
They tend to include the appropriation of trade-
marked symbols of trust, using the Internet to steal
intellectual property, artefacts and industrial
secrets. Furthermore, online IP issues in Asia tend
to have different (informational) characteristics to
the main IP debates and fall outside the remit of
the IP courts. The paradox is that not only is the
degree to which low IP law enforcement in Asia
contestable because “IP theft” is often cultural
issue, but also the IP issue in Asia has become
politicised as outlined above, with Asia becoming
the “criminal other” (see Yu
2003
, and also
Schwabach
2008
)
. In the online world the basic
technical IP issues remain similar to elsewhere.

The informational
ﬂ
ows that span the Internet’s
various networks are the product of creative

intellectual labour over which some form of moral
or
ﬁ
nancial claim can be made to ownership. They
range from the software codes that construct the
architecture of the World Wide Web to a range of
ingenious intangible artefacts that have become
the new real estate of virtual worlds. Not only has
there been a
ﬁ
ercely contested struggle over
whether or not these, sometimes valuable, artefacts
can be owned, but there have also been many
instances where individuals have sought to appro-
priate them from their authors. The
ﬁ
ght that is
taking place to control this “intellectual real estate”
has now become a prominent feature of debates
over the Internet because they tend to focus upon
issues relating to the ownership and control of an
environment that was initially designed to facili-
tate the free
ﬂ
ow of information.

The ability of networked technologies to dis-
seminate, share or trade informational or intellec-
tual properties in the form of text, images, music,

ﬁ
lm and TV through information services is what
has made the Internet and World Wide Web what it
is today, and same ability is arguably driving the
further development of the information age.
Networked information technologies are, however,
not simply characterised by informational
ﬂ
ows. It
is signi
ﬁ
cant that these
ﬂ
ows are also networked
and globalised (see Wall
2007
, p. 50). These three
qualities, on the one hand, give the authors, cre-
ators or their licensees—who have a right of own-
ership or control over the creations—a highly
ef
ﬁ
cient means by which to disseminate their
“properties”. On the other hand, however, the very
fact that they are informational, networked and glo-
balised means that traditional physical and/or “cen-
tralised” means of controlling intellectual properties
can be circumvented. The increased market values
of informational property in an information age
combined with relatively low levels of control that
can be exerted over them simultaneously creates
new opportunities and motivations for unauthor-
ised appropriation or use—what has become known
as cyber-piracy. Yet, these debates are also taking
place within the context of changing cultural, social
and legal meanings of intellectual property. It is a
process of change that is beginning to challenge
conventional orthodoxies and legal attitudes
towards intellectual properties.

This chapter critically explores what is being
understood as online intellectual property crime.
The
ﬁ
rst part looks at how intellectual property is
being transformed by new technologies and why it
has become signi
ﬁ
cant to the emerging informa-
tion economies. The second part looks at “virtual
theft” and speci
ﬁ
cally at how different forms of
informational intangibles (virtual intellectual prop-
erty online) are being appropriated and causing
concern for creators and owners: intellectual prop-
erty piracy of music, video and software and the
theft of virtual artefacts. Part three discusses criti-
cally some of the broader issues that are emerging
in the debate over intellectual property online.


6.2
How Is Intellectual Property
Being Transformed by the
Internet?

We begin here by brie
ﬂ
y mapping out just what is
meant by the term “intellectual property” and
intellectual property law. Intellectual property is
the creative product of intellectual labour and is
manifested in the form of the so-called intangi-
bles, such as ideas, inventions, signs, information
and expression. Whereas laws covering “real”
property establish rights over “tangibles”, intel-
lectual property laws establish proprietary rights
over “original” forms of intellectual production
(Bently and Sherman
2001
, pp. 1–2; WIPO
2001
,
p. 3). Intellectual property can take a number of
recognised forms—patents, trademarks, trade
secrets, industrial designs and copyright.
3
Copyright establishes the holder’s (e.g. an
author’s) rights over a particular form of original
expression (WIPO
2001
, pp. 40–41). Typical
objects of copyright include literary, journalistic
and other writing, music, paintings, drawings,
audio-visual recordings and (most recently) com-
puter software. As the term suggests, copyright
law grants the holder rights over the copying,

This chapter deals with the concepts of, and different
types of, intellectual property and issues relating to the
Internet, rather than speci
ﬁ
cally focusing upon intellec-
tual property law. Each jurisdiction has its own intellec-
tual property laws.

reproduction, distribution, broadcast and perfor-
mance of the designated “work” or content. In
essence, the holder retains ownership of the
expression and the right to exploit personally or
by licensing its copying, distribution or perfor-
mance in return for the payment of a royalty or a
fee. Thus, for example, if you purchase a CD
recording of songs, you have ownership over the
tangible object (the CD),
but not
of the
musical
content of the CD, whose ownership remains
with the copyright holder. Therefore, you are
legally prohibited from multiply copying, distrib-
uting, broadcasting or performing the content
without authorisation from the holder and the
payment of some agreed compensation. A trade-
mark, in contrast, is “any sign that individualises
the goods of a given enterprise and distinguishes
them from the goods of its competitors.” (WIPO

2001
, p. 68; BBC
2008
). Trademarks indicate the
source of the product, such that the consumer can
distinguish it from the products of other manu-
facturers. Words, such as slogans and company
names, drawings and symbols like logos and
audible signs such as music can all function as
trademarks (WIPO
2001
, p. 70; BBC
2008
)
. The
recognised holder of a trademark enjoys proprie-
tary rights over its use, and other parties are pro-
hibited from using the holder’s mark to (mis)
identify their own products (Bently and Sherman

2001
, pp. 900–901). Patents have as their object
inventions (products or process) over which the
state grants the inventor rights in relation to the
exploitation (e.g. manufacture and sale) of the
invention. Once an invention is patented, it can-
not be exploited by any party without the prior
permission of the patent holder (WIPO
2001
, p.
17). Historically, patents have been associated
with tangible properties such as the chemical for-
mulae for pharmaceutical drugs, or the design
speci
ﬁ
cations of engineered objects such as elec-
tronic circuitry or mechanical components.
However, in recent years patent protection has
come to also cover intangible properties, espe-
cially computer software (which is also addition-
ally afforded protection via copyright) (Stobbs

2000
)
. Therefore, taken together, intangible or
intellectual properties are created and defended
through copyright, trademark and patent laws.

The “digital revolution” brought about by
networked information technologies has had pro-
found consequences for the various different
forms of intellectual expression. The ability to
digitally copy, transfer or transmit the expression
of ideas in the form of code has enabled the per-
fect reproduction of such content, without deteri-
oration or degradation. Thus a digital copy of say
a
ﬁ
lm, image or sound recording is indistinguish-
able from the “original” and can subsequently be
copied endlessly without any loss of visual or
auditory detail (Yar
2006a
, p. 97). Since the
Internet is essentially a network designed to
enable the effective, fast and worldwide transmis-
sion of digitised code, it has become the perfect
medium through which such content can be freely
circulated, copied and exchanged. Moreover, the
rapidly falling costs of the equipment and services
necessary to make and share such copies, such as
personal computers, CD- and DVD-burners, hard
disk storage and broadband Internet access, have
enabled users to share digital content at very little
marginal cost (Yar
2005
;
2006b
)
.

A distinctly visible expression of the new
informational order that is emerging in the infor-
mation age has been the dramatic rise in the over-
all number of registrations for trademarks and
patents, combined with a new aggression in the
application of intellectual property laws to pro-
tect both properties and the expression of the
ideas they implement. Information is now rou-
tinely becoming commoditised as intellectual
property, including some previously in the public
domain. Not only is this practice encouraging the
growth of a new political economy of informa-
tion capital and new power relationships (see
Boyle
1996
)
, but the value inherent in it is also
encouraging new forms of deviant behaviour to
appropriate the value of informational content.

In this way, cyberspace today not only chal-
lenges our conventional understanding of owner-
ship and control, but it also blurs the traditional
boundaries between criminal and civil activities
along with some of the principles upon which our
conventional understandings of criminal harm
and justice are based. A good example here is a
reduction in the ability of prosecutors to prove the
offender’s intention to permanently deprive

another person of his or her digital informational
property as would be required under s. 1 of the
Theft Act 1968 in the UK. Consequently, impor-
tant questions remain unanswered as to what
online intellectual property crimes actually are
and to what extent they differ from other activities
that we currently recognise as intellectual prop-
erty crime. Wall
(

2007

)
argues that Cybercrimes
are behaviours that are mediated by networked
technologies with the premise that were those
technologies to be removed then the cybercrime
activity would cease. Using this criteria Intellectual
property crime online is no different and satis
ﬁ
es
the criteria as a cybercrime. It is, however, impor-
tant to distinguish between Intellectual property
crimes that use the Internet and intellectual prop-
erty crimes that take place in cyberspace.


6.3
Intellectual Property Theft

We can break down the types of losses that are
incurred by victimisation through virtual theft.
Indeed, here we encounter a basic conceptual
inconsistency because as stated earlier, digital
media can be reproduced exactly. In fact digital
media are simulacra (Baudrillard
1994
)
, copies
without originals, rather than copies. Because the
point in question here is the “owner”s’ lack of
exclusive control over the property, the metaphor
of piracy is probably more generally appropriate
than that of theft—although the latter is commonly
featured in many of the online crime narratives.

At the heart of the cyber-piracy debate is the
ability of those with legitimate rights to digital
intellectual properties to maintain their control
over them. The problem of regulating cyber-
piracy is largely one of policing its usage, because
digital property, whether in written, musical or
video form, has the unique characteristic of being
stored as code and, as stated earlier, being pro-
duced in its original form each time the
ﬁ
le is run.
Digital copies are identical, which creates new
problems for controlling their dissemination in
ways that preserve income streams. They are
very different in nature to intellectual properties
reproduced by analogue technology, such as
vinyl records or
ﬁ
lm, which degrades in quality
with each generation of copy. This characteristic
emphasises the value of the original artefact, but
also instils an informal policing mechanism into
the process. Without adequate controls in place
the value of digital property can (arguably) be
lost very quickly. Consequently, running in paral-
lel to the growth of the Internet has been an
increase in the number and complexity of intel-
lectual property laws and regulations relating to
trademarks, copyright and patents; see for exam-
ple the debates over the changes in privacy and
publicity laws in the USA (Boyle
1996
; Madow

1993
)
. These laws have intensi
ﬁ
ed the debates
over piracy. Thus, the intersection of the medium
of cyberspace and more restrictive intellectual
property laws became quite a potent combina-
tion, especially at a time when, as Baudrillard
observes, economic activity has become the out-
come rather than the cause of cultural values and
norms (Baudrillard
1994,
1998
)
. Importantly, the
fact that productive ideas can now be put into
place without the need for expensive mechanical
manufacturing processes means that the mone-
tary value of those ideas is further enhanced.
These forms of intellectual property, trademarks,
domain names and character merchandising are
becoming the real estate of cyberspace—espe-
cially where the IP is linked to the architecture of
the Internet (e.g. domain names). Thus the virtual
terrain of cyberspace is marked by the struggle
for control over this “intellectual” real estate and
its value increases in proportion to the strength of
the legal and technological control that exists
over its dissemination. The downside is that this
control makes it all the more desirable as some-
thing to be acquired for use or to be sold on.

Intellectual property piracy follows the centu-
ries-old practice of hijacking value by counterfeit-
ing products (through design piracy) and making
copies of the original and then passing them off as
originals. The trademark originally emerged as a
trusted sign to counter piracy by indicating to the
purchaser that the product is genuine and pro-
duced by quality manufacturers (see Sherman
and Bently
1999

)
. However, in the age of mass

, pp. 94–101.


87
6 Intellectual Property Crime Online in Asia
consumption the trademark has acquired its own
status and value, independent of the quality of
work—especially when linked to brands. For
goods carrying trademarks, the Internet has
become a natural marketplace,

5  especially follow-
ing the popularity of e-commerce and Internet
auctions such as eBay. These sites became a natu-
ral forum for selling counterfeit branded hard
goods, such as watches and designer clothes and
accessories, and also counterfeit branded
soft
goods that have been copied and packaged, or
made available to download, and they still are,
despite judicious policing efforts. Thus it is unsur-
prising that one of the most commonly reported
forms of misrepresentation on Internet auction
sites is selling counterfeit goods that are adver-
tised as authentic
items. There is a growing body
of evidence that auction sites are extensively used
for trading counterfeit DVDs, CDs and computer
software packages, as well as counterfeit clothing,
perfumes and other items (Enos
2000
; MPAA

2003
, p. 3).

In many ways, these examples follow the
mens
rea (guilty mind—intent) and
actus reus (guilty
act) of traditional piracy and the primary concern
of victims, the intellectual property right holders,
is to restore any income lost by piracy that would
otherwise have been enjoyed had the goods or
services been purchased legitimately. However,
other new forms of counterfeiting are emerging
solely within the con
ﬁ
nes of cyberspace that
require a further examination. Take, for example,
a situation where pictures of a famous pop star
are appropriated from (usually of
ﬁ
cial) Internet
sites, scanned from physical sources or digitally
created by “morphing” different images together.
The pictures are then packaged in a glossy, pro-
fessional format with some additional explana-
tory text, and then sold through some form of
cyber-shopping mall or topic-speci
ﬁ
c social net-
working sites typically to young customers who
purchase them in good faith. To frustrate detec-
tion, the site may be on a server in the USA and
the proceeds paid into a bank account halfway
round the planet. The whole operation might take
as little as a few days, and by the time the decep-
tion has been detected, the proceeds of the scam
have been removed from the bank account and
the perpetrators gone. Alternatively the images
may be traded online for other similar pirated
informational products. Such piracy does not stop
with images, it could just as easily be software,
music or video as the later discussion outlines.

The appropriation of informational property may
be motivated by libertarian (see Akdeniz
1997
)
6
artistic, moral, even educational reasons and not
simply by the prospect of
ﬁ
nancial gain. See, for
example, the three culturally different, yet
signi
ﬁ
cant, examples of the protection of popular
iconography through the WWW with regard to
Elvis Presley (imagery), the Tellytubbies (trade-
mark) and the pop-group Oasis (copyright) in Wall

(
2004,
2007
, p. 98) and more latterly the ferocity of
the anti-piracy campaigns. Although not explored
in detail here, these and many more examples nev-
ertheless demonstrate the gravity that owners of
intellectual property rights attach to threats to their
interests. They also illustrate the new dilemmas that
intellectual property right holders face with regard
to the paradox of circulation and restriction in an
environment of participatory consumption, which
requires them to carefully balance their need to
restrict the unauthorised circulation of their infor-
mational property to maintain income streams
whilst also allowing enough circulation of the
properties to allow the market to consume it as cul-
ture in the broadest sense and enabling it to reach
new markets (Wall
2004
, p. 35).

Informational piracy differs from traditional
intellectual infringement because it blurs the
boundaries between criminal and civil actions. It
is where owners’ intellectual property rights in
images, trademarks, copyrighted texts or general
character merchandising are threatened by theft
or release into the public domain of the Internet.
The threat is not just the loss of income streams,
but also of the “dilution” of a “property”’s value.

D.S. Wall and M. Yar
Dilution is a term used in intellectual property
law to describe the reduction in value through
unrestricted use, but is also a key part of the argu-
ment used to justify legal sanctions against
infringers. The additional problem for intellec-
tual property right holders and for law is that the
Internet also facilitates new types of participatory
consumption and development of informational
properties. Indeed the “wikinomics” of the digital
economy, as it has been named (Tapscott and
Williams
2007
)
, actively requires the release of
some aspects of intellectual property into the
public domain so that participants can contribute
to it. We return to this discussion later, but the
remainder of this section focuses upon speci
ﬁ
c
areas of intellectual property piracy: music, video
and software and the theft of virtual artefacts.

6.4
Music and Video Piracy

Music
: If P2P software transformed information
sharing, then the invention of MP3 (music) and
MP4 (video)
ﬁ
le formats has, respectively, trans-
formed the distribution of music and video. In the
case of the former, as long as the appropriate P2P
software is available, the music
ﬁ
les can be down-
loaded to a computer’s sound system, a portable
MP3 player or directly onto a CD Rom or Mini-
disc. The recording of music in a computer-read-
able format was previously possible; however
MP3 compression techniques reduced the
ﬁ
les to
manageable or transferable sizes. Consequently,
devices from the early Rio Diamond MP3 player
through to the more recent generation of I-Pods
have been speci
ﬁ
cally designed to play MP3
ﬁ
les.
Opinions on the morality and legality of MP3 are
divided. On the one hand the record companies
and a few rock bands argue that the distribution
of unauthorised MP3s is causing the death of
popular music by giving away hard-earned and
expensive properties and denying the authors the
rewards that they deserve. For example, the
International Intellectual Property Alliance claims
that in 2009, across 15 selected countries
alone, music “piracy” accounted for US $1.5 bil-
lion in losses. Notably, a number of Asian coun-
tries featured in these statistics, including China
($466.3 million in losses), Philippines ($112.1
million), Indonesia ($24.7 million) and Malaysia
($23.5 million) (Havoscope
2010
)
. On the other
hand, a strong counter-argument is emerging that
questions the claims of the music industry. A
report by the Australian Institute of Criminology
argued that the music industry cannot “explain
how it arrives at its statistics for staggering losses
through piracy” (Greene
2006
)
. Evidence is also
beginning to suggest that illicit MP3 downloads
are in fact helping to promote music culture and
also expand the capacity of the market. Not only
can individual musicians now obtain immediate
exposure to a much broader section of the public
without having to become contracted to record
companies, but also MP3 has arguably broadly
stimulated the market for old as well as new pop-
ular music. Even CD sales, it is alleged, are going
up and not down. Oberholzer-Gee and Strumpf
questioned industry claims in their 2004 research
into the impact of downloads on physical CD
sales with the observation that “downloads have
an effect on sales which is statistically indistin-
guishable from zero” (Gibson
2005
; Schwartz

2004
; Potier
2004

)
. Furthermore, this claim is
strengthened by the commercial success of
recently introduced, and authorised, pay-to-use
MP3 sites, such as I-Tunes, e-music and others,
and, of course, the popularity of new MP3 play-
ing hardware devices, such as the I-pod.
Additional evidence of this trend is found in
empirical research conducted in 2005 by
Leading
Question
, which found that online
ﬁ
le sharers
actually buy more music, up to four and a half
times more in legal downloads (Leading Question

2005
; Gibson
2005
)
.

The counterclaims described earlier illustrate
the dynamics of a power play in which the record-
ing industry’s highly publicised private legal
actions have been framed within a crime discourse
to tame the MP3 download market. As soon as the
technology of MP3 began to gain popularity, legal
actions were launched by the Recording Industry
Association of America (RIAA) and British
Phonographic Industry (BPI) on behalf of the
music industry. They invoked copyright laws and
brought lawsuits against MP3 bulk uploaders.
Perhaps uniquely, few of the 15–30,000 or more


89
6 Intellectual Property Crime Online in Asia
cases brought against individuals have actually
gone to court, with the most being settled privately
(Vance
2005

)
. Subsequent rogue (lawyer) actions,
from 2009 onwards, in the form of speculative
invoicing by ACS:Law and others, created so
much negative publicity that the industry repre-
sentatives distanced themselves from the actions.
Favouring instead the prosecution of commercial
uploaders (Wall
2011

)
, though not before launch-
ing a publicity campaign that warned the public of
the damage caused to the music industry and soci-
ety in general by suggesting that the proceeds of
piracy supported organised crime. The impact of
both actions and publicity has, however, been to
create an illusion of certainty of prosecution and
to exercise a broad chilling effect upon illegal
downloading behaviour.

Video (
Film and
Television
): MP4, or MPEG-4, is
a computer
ﬁ
le compression format that, like
MP3 with music, allows video, audio and other
information to be stored ef
ﬁ
ciently in one
ﬁ
le.
Within a P2P network MP4
ﬁ
les have transformed
the dissemination of video,
ﬁ
lm and televisual
materials. Newly released
ﬁ
lms can, for example,
be illicitly videoed in cinemas and then converted
into MP4
ﬁ
les, as can television programmes.
Similarly, DVDs can be ripped and all can be
sold, or traded through illegal “
ﬁ
lm portals” or
across P2P networks. DVD manufacturers ini-
tially protected their products with a security
device; however this was broken by a descram-
bling program, DeCSS, written by Jon Lech
Johansen (also known as “DVD Jon”) so that he
could watch his own DVDs on his Linux-powered

PC. He also posted details of his descrambler on
the Internet that led to him being prosecuted
“largely on the behest of the Motion Picture
Association of America (MPAA)” (Leyden

2003
)
. The case for the prosecution argued that
by sharing his DeCSS descrambler with others
over the Internet, Johansen made it easier to pirate
DVDs and therefore acted illegally. The case was
thrown out by the Norwegian court on the grounds
that the DVD scrambling codes had prevented
Johansen from using his Linux PC to play back
the DVDs he’d bought (Cullen
2004
:
Public
prosecutor
v Jon
Lech Johansen
2003
)
.

The failure to convict Johansen did not
prevent the MPAA from continuing to protect its
interests. From 2004 onwards, legal actions have
been brought against
ﬁ
le sharers, particularly the

ﬁ
lm indexing sites and television download sites
(BBC
2005c
)
. The latter action was signi
ﬁ
cant
because of the increased use of the Internet as the
broadcasting medium for television and the blur-
ring of the boundaries between the two: “as
TV-quality video online becomes a norm” (BBC

2005a
)
. Like the music downloading cases, the
MPAA’s actions were framed within an even
stronger crime discourse that was driven by anti-
piracy advertisements showing at the cinema and
also on DVDs and containing very vivid crime
imagery alleging that piracy supported organised
crime and terrorism. This discourse is supported
by studies claiming that illicit P2P movie sharing
is on the rise, especially in regions such as the
Asia-Paci
ﬁ
c, as access to high-speed broadband
services becomes more common (Mookerji

2009

)
. However, as with the cases against indi-
vidual music
ﬁ
le sharers, most of the video
download cases appear to have been settled pri-
vately and the practice of speculative invoicing
by entrepreneurial law
ﬁ
rms has shifted from
music to adult
ﬁ
lms
(Wall
2011
)
. The actions
and crime discourse have, as with MP3, also cre-
ated a chilling effect on downloading behaviour
and evidence of a decreasing volume of down-
loads is an indication of this trend, although it is
an area that requires further research. Initially,
these P2P-related actions against individual
infringers took place alongside legal actions
brought against
ﬁ
lm Web sites that pose as legiti-
mate
ﬁ
lm and music download services (BBC

2005g
)
. The current practice is to focus prosecu-
tions upon the latter.


6.5
Software Piracy

The
ﬁ
nal aspect of IP piracy that currently excites
major concerns within cybercrime debates is the
illegal distribution of software over the Internet.
Illicit software was initially distributed through
BBS bulletin boards and later across P2P
ﬁ
le
sharing networks such as “Drink or Die” (USDOJ


90
D.S. Wall and M. Yar

2002
; BBC
2005b
)
. The distribution operations
were either for pro
ﬁ
t or for trading (though not
necessarily for pro
ﬁ
t), or to ful
ﬁ
l a broader ethic
of helping the Internet community. The latter
function is often referred to as Warez, which is a
leetspeak (e.g. uses non-alphabetical numbers
that resemble syllables or sounds in words) deriv-
ative of (soft)wares, but also tends to signify
copyrighted software that has been illegally
offered for trade, but usually not for pro
ﬁ
t.
7 The
computer software industry claims large
ﬁ
nancial
losses to such violations. Global losses were
pinned at $51.4 billion for 2009 (BSA
2010
,
p. 1). Eastern-Central Europe is deemed to have
the highest “piracy” rate, where 64% of all soft-
ware is claimed to be an illegal copy; however,
rates are also high for North America (21%) and
Western Europe (34%) (BSA
2010
, p. 5). About
60% of software in use in the Asia-Paci
ﬁ
c region
is allegedly pirated, with “emerging” markets
such as China identi
ﬁ
ed as especially problem-
atic (BSA
2010
, p. 3). Whilst the
ﬁ
gures are high,
the methodologies used to calculate the losses
typically tend to rely upon estimations based
upon the generalisation of limited statistics pro-
duced by a business victimisation survey.

6.6
Stealing Virtual Artefacts

An emerging problem is the unauthorised appro-
priation of virtual artefacts that are the product of
intellectual labours and which have been created
in virtual environments. For many years, for
example, the trade in “game cheats” has been a
long-standing practice. Cheats are virtual arte-
facts that enable players to map their way through
computer games more quickly or gain access to
hidden spaces within them. Some cheats exploit

ﬂ
aws in gaming programmes, while others are
strategically placed there by the games-makers in
order to sustain players’ interest in the game. The
problem with “cheats” is to be able to identify
those that are illicit and those that are the
legitimate product of game designers. Perhaps
the most infamous “cheat” in recent years has
been the software called “Hot Coffee” which
unlocked secret sex scenes in
Grand Theft
Auto:
San
Andreas (BBC
2005c; 2005d
)
. Because of
these additional scenes, the rating of the game
was subsequently changed to “Adult”, which
along with the additional publicity attracted by
litigation helped to ensure that the game became
one of the most popular of all-time. Interestingly,
there is also a growing online market in the sale or
trade of other “cheat”-type activities outside the
gaming world, such as assignments by students
(plagiarism) on auction sites and P2P networks.

An interesting development in computer gam-
ing has been the increased criminal exploitation
of gaming artefacts that have strategic importance
in online role play gaming, for example in Project
Entropia.
8 Players need to obtain artefacts that
sustain their place in their games and help them
progress through it. The artefacts are therefore
highly desired because they represent not only
high levels of ability and power but also the hours
of labour put into their construction. Because of
this, players are willing to pay large amounts of
real money for them. In 2004, a virtual island was
sold on eBay for $26,500 (£13,700) and in 2005
a virtual space station went for $100,000
(£56,200) (BBC
2005f
)
. The space station was to
be used as virtual nightclub to which users paid
entry for access and whilst inside were exposed
to real-time advertising as in a real nightclub.

Consequently, the high values of these arte-
facts have generated a string of new criminal
opportunities. Already there have been examples
of buyers being defrauded through e-auction
sales, artefacts being stolen, by hacking, from
players’ accounts and even an “online mugging”
where a Japanese student was subsequently
arrested for using automated bots in a “
ﬁ
rst per-
son shooter” game players to make his avatar
move faster than other players and shoot with
pinpoint accuracy, thus attacking fellow players
and stealing items (BBC
2005e
)

Taiwan and also Japan, countries where computer
gaming is massively popular, have in recent years
had to respond to requests from gamers to inves-
tigate the theft of their “magic swords”—items
obtained in computer gaming environments
through intense labour.
9

The challenges that these forms of offending
pose for criminal justice systems are considerable,
not least because the victims can point to real eco-
nomic harms done to them through the illegal
usage, or sale, of their “virtual currency”. At the
forefront is the question of how best to legally
represent the loss in the victims’ interests. In their
discussion of virtual property crimes, Lastowka
and Hunter
(

2005
, p. 300) argue that the analogy
of theft is inappropriate because it implies the
destruction of existing value. They favour instead
the language of offences such as “counterfeiting”,
which takes into consideration the fact that the
“criminals” are actually creating illegitimate value
(Lastowka and Hunter
2005
, p. 315).


6.7
Outlining the Debate over
Intellectual Property Online

The emergence of intellectual property violations
as forms of criminal behaviour must be placed in
the context of wider legal, political, economic
and social processes, since it is in these spheres
of action that the de
ﬁ
nition of what counts as or
constitutes crime ultimately emerges. Below we
shall discuss relevant developments in the areas
of (1) intellectual property law; (2) policing and
(3) cultural rhetoric of anti-piracy discourse.

One of the most signi
ﬁ
cant legal developments
in recent years has been the incremental criminali-
sation of intellectual property offences. In the past,
violations (such as those related to copyright) have
been largely tackled through a range of
civil reme-
dies available to copyright holders—such as injunc-
tions, “delivery up” or destruction of infringing
articles and payment of damages (Bently and
Sherman
2001
, pp. 1008–23). Even where the law
made provision for criminal prosecution of IP
violations, there tended to be few such actions—for
example, between 1970 and 1980 there were less
than 20 prosecutions for copyright offences in the
UK (Sodipo
1997
, p. 228). This may be attributed
to a number of factors, including the relatively low
priority accorded to intellectual property crimes by
overstretched and under-resourced criminal justice
agencies; the public concern and political emphasis
on more visibly “harmful” offences, such as “street
crimes” and violent crime; dif
ﬁ
culties in policing
and intelligence gathering and the reluctance of
public prosecutors to involve themselves in a noto-
riously complex and specialised domain of law.
However, recent years have seen moves to redress
such copyright violations, bringing them increas-
ingly under the sway of criminal sanctions. This
has taken three main forms.

6.7.1
Increased Willingness to Use
Existing Criminal Sanctions
Against “Pirates”

There has been increased willingness to use exist-
ing criminal sanctions against “pirates”, encour-
aged both by greater political sensitivity to IP
rights and their economic importance and by
concerted application of pressure through lobby-
ing by the copyright industry. One key means in
achieving this has been the formation of industry
organisations (such as the Alliance Against
Counterfeiting and Piracy (AACP) and the
Federation Against Copyright Theft (FACT) in
the UK) that conduct investigations and gather
information on “piracy” activities, and lay com-
plaints before public prosecuting authorities
(Sodipo
1997
, p. 229; Bently and Sherman
2001
,
pp. 1030–31). Recent years have seen a number
of high-pro
ﬁ
le piracy cases in which such proce-
dures have led to criminal convictions carrying
substantial custodial sentences—for example, in
2002 a FACT investigation led to a 4-year prison
sentence for the convicted “pirate” (Carugati

2003
)
. The overall number of criminal prosecu-
tions for copyright violations has also increased
massively—in 2000 alone, there were over 500
such cases in the area of music (CD) counterfeit-
ing alone (Home Of
ﬁ
ce
2002
, p. 2).

6.7.2
Incorporating Additional
Provisions for Criminal
Sanctions into National Laws
and International Treaties

In recent years the incorporation of additional
provisions for criminal sanctions into both inter-
national treaties and national laws has taken
place. At the national level, we can note for
example Section 107 of the Copyright, Designs
and Patents Act (1988) in the UK, which places
local administrative authorities (such as Trading
Standards departments) under a duty to enforce
criminal copyright provisions, and signi
ﬁ
cantly
strengthens the penalties available in comparison
to the previously existing Copyright Act of 1956
(Dworkin and Taylor
1989
, pp. 121–122; Bently
and Sherman
2001
, p. 1031). In the USA, the No
Electronic Theft Act (1988) makes provision for
up to 3 years imprisonment for convicted
“pirates”; it also extends the applicability of sanc-
tions beyond those engaging in piracy for com-
mercial gain, to include for example the
not-for-pro
ﬁ
t digital trading engaged in by
ﬁ
le-
sharers (Drahos and Braithwaite
2002
, p. 185).
Concerted political pressure has been brought to
bear on governments in Asia to enact additional
legal prohibitions against piracy in its various
forms. Recent years have seen initiatives to intro-
duce new copyright laws in countries such as
Thailand, the Philippines and Korea (Bangkok
Post
2009
; Baldemor
2010
; Pfanner
2011
)
. At an
international level, Article 61 of the 1994 TRIPS
agreement establishes a
mandatory requirement
for signatories to make criminal provisions
against commercial copyright violations. Hence
the extensions of available criminal sanctions and
the greater willingness to pursue them have, taken
together, signi
ﬁ
cantly recon
ﬁ
gured piracy, ren-
dering it graver in an attempt to stem its growth.

Already noted has been the recent increase in
policing and enforcement activity, in which
industry organisations are playing a leading role.
It is also worth noting here the proliferation of
industry-
ﬁ
nanced “anti-piracy” organisations
whose
raison d’etre combines research, intelli-
gence gathering, policing, education and lobby-
ing activities. The past two decades have seen the
creation of the Counterfeiting Intelligence
Bureau, the International Intellectual Property
Alliance, the International Anti-Counterfeiting
Coalition, the Alliance Against Counterfeiting
and Piracy, the Coalition for Intellectual Property
Rights, the Artists Coalition Against Piracy, the
aforementioned AACP and FACT as well as
numerous existing trade organisations that have
established specialist groups and initiatives to
combat
ﬁ
lm piracy (such as the MPAA and the
RIAA). Such organisations purport to “lift the
burden of investigation from law enforcement
agencies” (AACP
2002
, p. 2) by engaging in a
range of increasingly intensive policing activi-
ties. Where public agencies have been reluctant
to invest time and resources in tackling IP viola-
tions, industrial and commercial interests have
“
ﬁ
lled the void”. In addition to intelligence gath-
ering and undercover operations, they have
attempted to bring intellectual property crime
into the criminal justice mainstream through, for
example, the appointment of specialist liaison
personnel to “assist” and “advise” responsible
agencies in the detection and prosecution of
“copyright theft”. Recent years have seen such
organisations step up their activities in “emerging
markets” such as the Asia-Paci
ﬁ
c region, discern-
ing the low priority that is currently given to
intellectual property rights enforcement; for
example, in China IP enforcement is an adminis-
trative rather than criminal justice matter, result-
ing in very limited levels of police attention (IIPA

2011
, p. 1). Governments have themselves
responded to concerted pressure from these
groups by establishing intellectual property strat-
egies and specialist units within criminal justice
agencies to address intellectual property viola-
tions. The UK, for example, has the local trading
standards organisations which operate at a local
level; the e-crime unit of the Serious and
Organised Crimes Agency, SOCA (from 2012
part of the UK National Crime Agency), investi-
gates serious national infringements. In the USA
there is the FBI’s Internet Fraud Complaint
Centre (IFCC), which also takes on the responsi-
bility for policing some intellectual property
crimes. At an international level, Interpol has
established an Intellectual Property Crimes Unit


93
6 Intellectual Property Crime Online in Asia
(2002) and there are concerted efforts at the EU
level to strengthen EUROPOL’s powers of
enforcement in the area of intellectual property.

6.7.3
The Development and
Implementation of “Anti-piracy
Education” Campaigns

Recent “anti-piracy education” campaigns involv-
ing both copyright industries and public agencies
have given particular focus to young people because
of their apparently disproportionate involvement in
illegal Internet downloading, copying and distribu-
tion of copyrighted materials. Recent years have
seen numerous “educational” programmes pro-
duced by umbrella organisations that represent
various sectors of the copyright industries—soft-
ware, music and/or motion pictures. Such pro-
grammes typically provide a range of materials,
exercises and gaming activities that are intended
for use in the classroom, thereby incorporating
anti-piracy into the school curriculum. Programmes
typically target younger children between the ages
of 8 and 13. For example, there is the Friends of
the Copyright Society of America—their child-
oriented program is called “Copyright Kids”. Also
notable is the Software and Information Industry
Association
(SIAA)’s
“Cybersmart!
School
Program”. A third is the Business Software Alliance
(BSA)’s “Play It Cybersafe” program featuring the
cartoon character Garret the Ferret aka “The
Copyright Crusader”. A fourth campaign is pro-
duced by the Government of Western Australia’s
Department of Education and Training, and is
called “Ippy’s Big Idea”. A
ﬁ
fth campaign is the
MPAA’s “Starving Artist” schools’ road show. This
is a role-playing game designed for school chil-
dren, which was taken “on tour” in 2003 in 36,000
classrooms across the USA. The game invites stu-
dents “to come up with an idea for a record album,
cover art, and lyrics” (Menta
2003
)
. Having com-
pleted the exercise, the students are told that their
album is already available for download from the
Internet, and are asked “how they felt when they real-
ized that their work was stolen and that they would
not get anything for their efforts” (Menta
2003
)
.
Similar IP education campaigns have been launched
in Asia-Paci
ﬁ
c countries including China, Singa-
pore, Malaysia and Hong Kong (ABAC
2007

)
. All
such campaigns attempt to create a moral consen-
sus that unauthorised copying is a form of theft,
and as such as immoral as stealing someone else’s
material possessions; moreover, they also target the
children’s parents in an attempt to warn them of the
possible legal repercussions if their children are
caught engaging in piracy.

All of the foregoing developments have served
to progressively shift intellectual property
offences into the space of criminal conduct.
However, as Becker
(
1963
) notes, it is by no
means given that those targeted with stigmatising
labels of criminality and deviance will automati-
cally accept such labels. Rather, they may resist
such efforts, seeking to de
ﬂ
ect the label by
defending their activities against those who seek
to position them as “outsiders”. Such reactions
may be considered as instances of what Sykes
and Matza
(
1957
) call “techniques of neutralisa-
tion”. These techniques serve as vocabularies of
justi
ﬁ
cation by which the potential “deviants”
de
ﬂ
ect negative labels, turning accusations of
moral delinquency back upon their accusers.
Prime among these techniques are those of the
“denial of harm” (the assertion that no real social
damage is caused by the behaviour in question)
and “denial of the deniers” (the assertion that
those who mount accusations are themselves cor-
rupt,
immoral
or
otherwise
hypocritical).
Moments of reaction-resistance have clearly
emerged in response to moral entrepreneurs’
constructions of Internet piracy as a form of
criminality. Music fans, committed to the free
circulation and appreciation of popular culture,
have established Web sites where such rhetorical
defences are mounted. For example, the activists
of BOYCOTTRIAA.com stated in 2005 that:

Boycott-RIAA was founded because we love
music. We cannot stand by silently while the
recording industry continues its decades-long effort
to lock up our culture and heritage by misrepre-
senting the facts to the public, to artists, the fans
and to our government. (BOYCOTTRIAA.com)


Through such responses, acts of copying and
culture sharing are defended as principled stands


94
D.S. Wall and M. Yar
against corporate interests who are charged with
being the true “villains” in the unfolding con-
frontation between producers and fans. However,
the lines of division within this battle to de
ﬁ
ne
criminality are further complicated by the inde-
terminate role played by recording artists them-
selves. On the one hand, artists have played a
pivotal role in the entrepreneurship that has
sought to de
ﬁ
ne Internet copying as harmful and
socially unacceptable. For example, the famous
controversy over Napster’s online music
ﬁ
le-
sharing service
ﬁ
rst hit the headlines as a result of
legal action taken by the band Metallica (Marshall

2002
, p. 9). Other prominent anti-Napster per-
formers included Madonna and Mick Jagger. In
contrast, other artists have made common cause
with
ﬁ
le-sharers, choosing instead to direct their
criticisms against the recording companies rather
that the fans. In 2000, rock musician Courtney
Love (singer with Hole and widow of rock icon
Kurt Cobain) launched what has been dubbed the
“Love Manifesto”, a critical re
ﬂ
ection on intel-
lectual property theft, artists and the recording
industry. Love began her “Manifesto” thus:


Today I want to talk about piracy and music. What
is piracy? Piracy is the act of stealing an artist’s
work without any intention of paying for it. I’m not
talking about Napster-type software . . . I’m talking
about major label recording contracts. (Love
2000
)


She went on to claim that standard practice
within the recording industry deprives musicians
of copyrights, and the monies advanced to artists
are largely recouped from them by the industry
under “expenses” for recording and promotion.
As a consequence, the musicians see little return
from their efforts and, she opined, “the band may
as well be working at a 7-11” (Love
2000
)
. In
fact, it has been argued that piracy is in the

ﬁ
nancial interests of most recording artists; most
performers make their living from concert perfor-
mance, and this is best supported and promoted
by having their music circulated as widely as
possible, including via copying. As musician
Ignacio Escolar has put it: “Like all musicians, I
know that 100,000 pirate fans coming to my
shows are more pro
ﬁ
table than 10,000 original
ones” (Escolar
2003
, p. 15).

6.7.4
The Need to Rethink Intellectual
Property Rights Management
and Reverse the
Decriminalisation of IP Piracy

What the previous discussion indicates is a pro-
cess by which intellectual property piracy is
increasingly becoming framed by crime debates
without any clear evidence that this process will
solve the problem. This suggests that the per-
ceived problem—the nature of the piracy—may
actually require some critical revision. An emerg-
ing and very real problem for intellectual prop-
erty right holders and also for law and its related
regulations is the very real shift that is now taking
place in the ways that intellectual properties are
being consumed in the information age. At the
level of computer programming, we have already
seen the “open source” movement make major
contributions to the development of powerful
operating systems such as Linux. The main prin-
ciple behind the open source movement is that
core computer code is freely circulated so that
individuals can perfect or develop it themselves
and then recirculate for the bene
ﬁ
t of others. In
this way, the group effort makes the object of
everyone’s labours stronger and also much more
powerful than one individual could possibly man-
age. At the broader level of the general consumer
we are also witnessing signi
ﬁ
cant new types of
participatory
consumption
(prosumption).
Sophisticated new software ranging from blog-
ging technology, through to image manipulators,
through to recording and publishing software
have enabled consumers of information, music,
text and images (moving and still) to create their
own “mash ups”. In other words, software is
enabling consumers to combine together the dif-
ferent parts of different intellectual properties
that they particularly enjoy to create something
entirely new that they consume themselves and
also share with others.

In both of the examples illustrated above, the
consumers also become producers or “prosum-
ers”. Not only does this cause them to fall foul
of conventional IP laws, especially in the sec-
ond example, but they are also increasingly
demanding recognition of, and rights to, their


95
6 Intellectual Property Crime Online in Asia
contributions to the intellectual properties that
they have enhanced. This “wikinomics” of the
digital economy (Tapscott and Williams
2007
)
actively requires entirely new ways of thinking
with regard to intellectual properties. Not least,
the release of some aspects of intellectual prop-
erty into the public domain so that participants
can contribute to it. This process is counter-intu-
itive to conventional practices; however,
Tapscott and Williams argue that allowing par-
ticipatory consumption has considerable value
to IP rights owners and, furthermore, it does not
necessarily require core intellectual property to
be released, only that which enables participa-
tory consumption. Plus mechanisms could be
created—depending upon the characteristics of
the intellectual property in question—that would
allow prosumers to gain recognition and even
income from their contributions. Importantly,
such a revision of conventional approaches to IP
would also halt the increasing criminalisation
process to the bene
ﬁ
t of all.


6.8
Conclusions

This chapter has illustrated how inventive,
re
ﬂ
exive and responsive computer-assisted or
-mediated intellectual property crime can be and
also how close it sits to legitimate business
opportunities. It also shows how the virtual bank
robbery, the virtual sting and virtual theft are
areas of harmful/criminal activity that are rap-
idly evolving along with technological develop-
ments. As they evolve, they create new challenges
for law enforcement. For example, in the UK,
machines cannot be deceived, only the people
who use them; data cannot be stolen; fraud and
deception are still to be fully established as
speci
ﬁ
c crimes (despite new Fraud Laws) and
trade secret theft is still not an offence—only the
way that the information was obtained. In other
jurisdictions, including some Asian countries,
such laws do exist, yet the practice of enforce-
ment is low. But this disparity not only creates
problems for law enforcement but also raises a
question as to whether law is the most effective
local solution to what has become a global prob-
lem. The example of music and movie
ﬁ
le shar-
ing is a graphic illustration of where private
corporate interests compete with the public inter-
est and capture the crime agenda.

The bulk of this chapter has focussed upon
fraudulent behaviour with regard to intellectual
property that has been driven by the desire for
economic or informational gain. This pro
ﬁ
le will
gradually broaden as new opportunities for
offending are created by the convergence of net-
worked technologies of the home, work and lei-
sure with those managing identity and location.
Importantly, this new world of convergence will
be characterised more and more by information
brokering; thus “information capital” will become
increasingly more valuable. As a consequence,
we shall probably see a further rise in the extent
and breadth of information theft. Future intellec-
tual property crime debates will therefore more
intensely focus increasingly upon the rights relat-
ing to the protection of information and also the
restoration of information and reputation once
compromised.

7.1
Introduction

Although the exact detail will vary across legal
systems, in most advanced democratic countries,
the legal de
ﬁ
nition for fraud activities in relation
to any of the parties generally requires the pres-
ence of at least three elements: material misrep-
resentation, in the form of concealment,
falsi
ﬁ
cation, or untruth; intent to deceive; and
aim of gaining unauthorized bene
ﬁ
t. At the prac-
tical level, insurance fraud has many dimen-
sions—especially
given
the
phenomenon’s
evolving and dynamic nature. Many commenta-
tors classify fraudulent activities under three
main categories: exaggeration of an otherwise
legitimate claim; premeditated fabrication of a
claim; and fraudulent known disclosure or mis-
representation of material facts.

Both legal and practical de
ﬁ
nitions “share
the distinctive common characteristic that,
unlike bad debts, for example, or conventional
property crime such as burglary, they are not
self-disclosing. Their essence is to appear as
normal and to be processed and paid in a routine
manner” (Clarke
1990
, p. 1). It follows that
insurers will normally only have an idea of the
nature and extent of a fraud if they take speci
ﬁ
c
detection measures.

However, neither the legal nor the practical
de
ﬁ
nition distinguishes the individual oppor-
tunist from “organized” insurance fraudsters.
Nevertheless, this kind of distinction is cer-
tainly recognized within the private insurance
industry itself, which has concentrated its inves-
tigative resources on forms of “organized”
activity—while recognizing that there is much
“padding” and claims-in
ﬂ
ation activity by
“ordinary” opportunists.

In this study, it is contended that the analytical
distinction is important because the social reac-
tions to the two types of fraudster are constructed
in a very different way under conditions of politi-
cal economy and culture. Arguably, the motiva-
tion and epidemiology of “organized” insurance
fraud are in general similar to other types of
“organized” criminal activity—broadly under-
stood as the same across the world. This “hard-
core” fraud, in Ericson and Doyle’s
(
2004
) words,
occurs when someone deliberately plans or
invents a loss covered by their insurance policy in
order to receive payment for damages that may or
may not be real. The “social reaction” to orga-
nized insurance fraud in all political economies
and cultures is arguably the same—that is, they
are, like violent and sex criminals, seen as “crim-
inal actions” and morally culpable (Coalition
Against Insurance Fraud, CAIF
2007
)
.

Prevention measures and more regulatory
activity against organized insurance fraudsters
are seen as legitimate by the private insurance
industry, the State, and the general public.
However, in relation to “opportunist” fraud, in

many countries people often deny “opportunist”
fraud as fraud or a crime. Again in Ericson and
Doyle’s
(
2004
) expression, “softcore” insurance
fraud refers to policyholders exaggerating other-
wise legitimate claims or when an individual
misreports previous or existing conditions to
obtain a lower premium on his or her insurance
policy. In a survey by the Insurance Council of
Australia in 1993, 14% of those interviewed
regarded padding a claim as acceptable. In the
2002 survey, the percentage had risen to 18%.
Other similar surveys done by the Association of
British Insurers in 2002 showed that 7% of
respondents in the UK admitted to having made a
fraudulent insurance claim, and 48% in the UK
did not rule out making a false claim in the future.
More interestingly, 40% of respondents believed
that exaggerating a claim was acceptable or mar-
ginal behavior. 29% in the UK thought that mak-
ing up a claim was acceptable or borderline
(CAIF
2007
)
. In the USA, nearly one of four
Americans say it is acceptable to defraud insurers
and some 24% say it is quite or somewhat accept-
able to bilk insurers (CAIF
2007
)
.

Why is “opportunist” fraud so perceived?
Why do people “neutralize” their behavior in this
way ? Why do some countries take a more proac-
tive approach to such “crime” than others? Some
criminologists have previously considered these
matters. Take Cressey
(
1953,
1986
) for example;
he pointed out (see Fig.
7.1
) that there are three
elements that can and will be found in all fraud
cases, organized or opportunist: namely, opportu-
nity, perceived pressure, and rationalization. The
triangle has also indeed been used as a model of
fraud prevention. Of the three elements,
ﬁ
nancial
pressures are considered to be the most impor-
tant. Among others, greed, luxurious lifestyle,
debts, unexpected
ﬁ
nancial crisis (i.e., unemploy-
ment, natural disaster), poor investment, and a
lack of family/relative supporting system are the
most common. The relationship between
ﬁ
nancial
pressure and opportunist fraud is well explained
by this model.

For many ordinary people, “softcore” fraud is
“acceptable
.” Many ordinary people who have
the experience of buying an insurance policy or
making a claim share some of these views.
Rationalizations do help fraudsters conceal their
true unlawful motivation and explain their actions
and feelings in a way that is less threatening to
their sense of self. In terms of opportunities, a
fraud arises when there is a lack of control to pre-
vent it, a lack of access to relevant information,
and a lack of adequate audit trails or attitudes such
as ignorance, apathy, incapability, and incapacity.

Donald Cressey’s “the Fraud Triangle”



101
7 “Opportunist” Insurance Fraud Under Different Political Economies: Taiwan (Asia) and Europe Compared
In a 2001 US survey nearly 10% of respondents
said they would commit insurance fraud if they
knew they could get away with it (
Coalition
Against Insurance Fraud
2008a,
b
)
. And about
30% would not report insurance scams commit-
ted by someone they know. In other words, if
antifraud measures are not taken or enforced seri-
ously, opportunity knocks.

Cressey’s fraud model, illustrated in Fig.
7.1
,
has been well received by criminologists and
practitioners; however, it arguably fails to capture
how or why the political economy and the nature
and dynamics of the modern insurance industry
affect the form of the three elements and increase
moral hazard of the insured and the moral risk of
the insurance industry. Here we de
ﬁ
ne moral haz-
ard as the insured not entering the contract in
good faith or where he/she has an incentive to
take unusual risks in a desperate attempt to make
pro
ﬁ
t, and moral risk as market misconduct in the
structure and culture of the insurance industry. In
reviewing the terminology “moral risk,” Ericson
and colleagues consider and critique the tradi-
tional de
ﬁ
nition of moral hazard (Ericson et al.

2000
; Ericson and Doyle
2006
)
. Arguably, neo-
liberal societies (e.g., the USA or the UK) empha-
size self-governance and individual responsibility
to create greater risk, individual responsibility,
and insecurity, and therefore, produce more

ﬁ
nancial pressures, rationalization, and opportu-
nity for padding a claim. In social democratic
society (e.g., Finland or Sweden), the social wel-
fare tradition and the perception of social insur-
ance can reduce these
ﬁ
nancial pressures and
rationalization to commit a fraud. The
ﬁ
nancial
pressures motivate people to commit fraud and at
the same time trigger a more proactive reaction
from insurance companies or the State. And the
changing nature of the insurance industry from a
mutual trust system within a homogeneous group
to a more investment-oriented and anonymous
system allows both policy holders and insurers to
rationalize their frauds and creates more opportu-
nity to commit it. For the insured and the insur-
ers, the insurance business has changed into a
more
investment-oriented
and
anonymous
arrangement, in contrast to the previously envis-
aged charitable and altruistic one. Inevitably, the
insured and the insurers together construct greater
moral risk of opportunist fraud in the modern
insurance industry.

Furthermore, the triangle model has nothing
to say about how differential reactions to oppor-
tunist fraud are constructed under different politi-
cal economies.

Prima facie
, the common rationales to “crack
down” on opportunist insurance fraud are the
following:

The perceived seriousness of opportunist fraud
•
by the industry

Costs to the industry
•

Threat the “honest” insured
•

Shame and fear
•

If all the rationales hold true, there should be
little difference in industry and government
reaction to the problem across countries.
However, this is not the case. Ericson and Doyle

(
2004
) noticed that antifraud publicity cam-
paigns started in the last two decades in Canada,
the USA, and the UK. Taiwan and China, on the
other hand, only launched their campaigns in
the past 5–10 years (Jou and Hebenton
2007
)
.
Until the mid-1990s, Finland and Sweden had
not yet taken much formal action to tackle
opportunist insurance fraud (Niemi
1995
)
.
Obviously, perception and reaction to insurance
fraud under differing political economies merit
further investigation.

This paper thus will investigate how political
economy and the changing nature of the modern
insurance industry reshape Cressey’s original tri-
angle model. We also analyze the “what and
why” of antifraud prevention measures and how
they are differently understood in three selected
countries (selected as an ideal-type analysis rep-
resenting neo-liberalist, social democratic, and
Confucian political economic regimes).

7.2
Political Economy and
Opportunist Insurance Fraud

Neo-liberalism refers to the late twentieth cen-
tury revival of the nineteenth century approach to
free-market capital known as economic
liberal-
ism. The general ethos is individualism rather


102
S. Jou
than collectivism (Cavadino and Dignan
2006
, p.
440). Scholars usually agree that the neoliberal
model has some basic common characteristics:
there is to be a minimal state; market fundamen-
talism is stressed; emphasis is placed not only on
risk management but also on risk taking; indi-
vidual responsibility is underscored. Each indi-
vidual is to be his or her own personal security
market and other consuming interests (
Ericson
et al.
2000
). Concepts such as risk, risk-taking,
individualism, insecurity, and uncertainty com-
monly dominate the neo-liberalism
literatures
(Lash and Urry
1987
; Esping-Andersen
1990
;
Beck
1992
)
. On the other hand, what are the
assumptions underlying the social democratic
model of society? Le Grand
(
1997
) argues that
this type of society assumes that the state and its
agents are both competent and benevolent. That
is, whoever operated the state can be trusted to
work primarily in the public interest. Politicians,
civil servants and bureaucrats, and managers are
supposed accurately to de
ﬁ
ne social and individ-
ual needs. In short, the society based on high
taxation and social security involves a belief in
people’s sense of altruism or at least of an adher-
ence to collective solidarity.

In a society under the in
ﬂ
uence of
Confucianism, mainly in East Asia, great empha-
sis is placed on collectivism, family responsibil-
ity, and a cooperative social security net. The
State and the family are seen as primary sources
for dealing with risks and losses. For example, in
Chinese culture, people still believe that the best
insurance one can buy is to have as many sons as
one can. Note that it’s “sons” not “daughters,”
because married daughters would not be consid-
ered as part of the family and therefore are not
responsible for their parents’ welfare or illness.
Gradually, and in the twenty-
ﬁ
rst century, the
cultural values of “
ﬁ
lial piety and
Guanxi (friend-
ship or connections)” in countries like Taiwan,
Singapore, or China have adapted to the marketi-
zation of society, interlocking with modern

ﬁ
nancial systems (Tang
2005
)
. The State both

ﬁ
nances and provides the supply of basic social
services such as education, health care, social
care, and full pension plan (for some selected
groups). However, the services are limited and
exclusive. They do not fully cover all risks
throughout a person’s life span. They also exclude
the individuals who have property, reasonable
income, or a family and especially a well-to-do
family. Because of collective responsibility, the
State and the family do not encourage risks and
risk-taking. Risk management strategies to them
tend to be “having some personal savings in the
bank,” “having more
ﬁ
lial and loyal children,”
and “extending more ties of friendship as safety
nets.” If a person has none of the above, the State
will provide them as basic social services. Thus if
a Chinese or Taiwanese citizen turns to buy pri-
vate insurance its meaning culturally would be
better understood as akin to “an investment to
make more money” or “to bene
ﬁ
t their family
members” than a self risk management tactic.

In sum, we can characterize individual respon-
sibility, self-governance, risk management, as
well as risk taking as central values for neoliberal
society whereas collectivism, altruism, trust, and
equality characterize social democratic society.
Collectivism, family responsibility, and coopera-
tive social security net, on the other hand, play
important roles in Confucian society and culture
(for a powerful analysis of cultural collectivism/
individualism and its consequences see Hofstede

2001
; Hofstede and Bond
1988
) (see Table
7.1
).
How do these different political economies (and
cultures) help determine reactions to opportunist
insurance fraud? One way of understanding these
relationships is to consider how the political
economy and culture interact to produce moral
hazard and moral risk.

7.3
More Risk Leads to Greater
Moral Hazard

Both Giddens
(
1995
) and Beck
(
1992
) argue that
the notion of risk is accompanied by the rise of
insurance. In modern society, not only are there
risks like natural disasters as in ancient times but
also risks from human forces, or what Giddens
might call “manufactured uncertainty or manu-
factured risks” (Giddens
1995
) which operate
signi
ﬁ
cantly under human agency (i.e., environ-
mental pollution, traf
ﬁ
c accidents). The insurance


103
7 “Opportunist” Insurance Fraud Under Different Political Economies: Taiwan (Asia) and Europe Compared
business is all about making people plan and dis-
cuss their risks in monetary terms as well as to
help them reduce
ﬁ
nancial pressures resulting
from possible risks and losses.

Moreover, as risk increasingly becomes an
integral part of the free market economic system,
certain risk taking and calculations assume new
respectability. Risk taking in neoliberal society
especially has a positive meaning now: the chance
of hitting a big win, of getting more on the back
side than one invests on the front side. Wall Street
(New York) and the City of London are full of
winners in this system. To deal with highly
encouraged risk-taking attitudes and behaviors,
rational calculation of possible loss and getting
insurance cover is viewed as a purely economic
decision. Paying premiums act as an appropriate
incentive and are calculated to diminish
ﬁ
nancial
losses. However, moral hazard increases drasti-
cally with the insured risk takers. The insurance
policy will arguably encourage them to take more
risks resulting in actual dangers that the insurer
has to pay for. And padding a claim is also an
economic calculation of the insured to get a “fair
share back.” A
ﬁ
eld experiment in Boston (USA)
undertaken by Tracy and Fox
(
1989
) found that
auto body repair estimates were signi
ﬁ
cantly
higher with insurance coverage than without,
regardless of the type of car, extent of damage,
sex of driver, and location of shop. For car own-
ers with insurance, they did not want to spend
more time to acquire a second opinion. For auto-
mobile garages, they knew their clients with
insurance would not bother to question their esti-
mates either. For both parties, padding an auto-
mobile bodily injury claim is what they “deserve”
from the insurance company.

Therefore, arguably in a neoliberal society,
more risks lead to more pressures which expand
the size of the insurance market. The booming
insurance market however brings an additional
quantum of moral hazard in terms of encouraging
people to take more risks and helping them ratio-
nalize the claim padding behavior.

7.4
More Individualism Leads
to Greater Moral Hazard

After World War II, neo-liberalism promoted the
idea of strictly individualistic conceptions of self-
help, replacing more ef
ﬁ
cient cooperative risk-
bearing techniques. Insurance emerges as the
most ef
ﬁ
cient secular risk-bearing system to han-
dle the economic hazards. Government tries to
shed responsibilities and transfer them to the pri-
vate sector, i.e., the insurance. Such an approach
to insurance is seen as positive and quickly
accepted. In an individualist society, social net-
work security is perceived less desirable than
market insurance. Thus, individualism not only
off-loads government responsibility but also dis-
courages the cooperative social security net. That
is to say, family, relatives, or friends are no longer
part of the risk management system. This would
take away the individual’s understanding of

collective morality, the value of others apart from
money and losses, inevitably resulting in greater
moral hazards in insurance relationships (Ericson
et al.
2000
)
. Rationalization of opportunist fraud
occurs when society loses its collective morality
and other values, apart from money values. This
is also evident when the government and the
industry start their antifraud campaigns and seek
to introduce more regulations to prevent oppor-
tunist fraud.

7.5
Insecurity Leads to Greater
Moral Hazard

As we know, the social democratic model prom-
ises security whereas neoliberal society promises
insecurity. Which one of the political economies
would result in greater moral hazard? One argu-
ment is that social democratic society creates a
culture of dependency (Giddens
1998
)
. Instead of
the desirable emphasis on risk-taking and enter-
prise, there is risk minimization, avoidance, and
aversion that create human and institutional iner-
tia (Ericson et al.
2000
)
. Because the State offers
generous bene
ﬁ
ts, citizens are expected to pay
high taxes as their “premium,” and it makes it
easy for ordinary people to morally rationalize a
fraudulent claim to social insurance bene
ﬁ
ts.
What about moral hazard for private insurance?
Arguably, the moral hazard for private insurance
would eventually be minimized where the culture
of social democratic society discourages the con-
sumption of private insurance and when bureau-
cratic inef
ﬁ
ciencies make it easy to commit
bene
ﬁ
t fraud.

In distinction to the welfare state, the sense of
insecurity in neoliberal countries appears for
opportunist fraudsters to override any notion of the
prospect of getting caught. Economic insecurity
brings more perceived risk and
ﬁ
nancial pressure
which encourage ordinary people to participate in
dishonest forms of economic behavior (Gooby
et al.
1999

)
. The low cost and the preserved rewards
associated with means-tested schemes make pad-
ding a claim highly incentive. On the other hand,
the image of insecurity and uncertainty is so well
exercised and successfully constructed that the
insurance industry is able to sell more unnecessary
policies to the insured. Over-insurance provides
people with opportunities to exploit. Opportunity
arises in the case of over-insurance, when the
amount insured is greater than the actual value of
the property insured. This allows the insured to
make pro
ﬁ
ts by acting less prudently—either in
relation to themselves or in relation to their prop-
erty, or to destroying their property or purposely
staying in hospital longer because the payment
they receive from their insurers is of greater value
than the property or time they lost and the pain
they have been through.


7.6
The Changing Nature of Modern
Insurance and Opportunist
Insurance Fraud

Aside from external in
ﬂ
uences, the internal work-
ing environment of the insurance industry has
also independently evolved in modern society.

Today’s insurance is far more complex than in
earlier times. Even though the fundamental idea of
risk management, the equitable transfer of the risk
of a loss, from one entity to another, in exchange
for a premium remains the same, the changing
nature of insurance business leads to a rise of what
Ericson and Doyle
(
2006
) called “moral risk”
which is institutionalized in the structure and cul-
ture of the insurance industry. Arguably, that moral
risk is situated within speci
ﬁ
c aspects of the “new”
insurance, namely, “scienti
ﬁ
c” underwriting pro-
cess, responsibilization of the individual consumer,
and the vision of insurance as a high-pro
ﬁ
t/invest-
ment-oriented enterprise.


7.7
The “Scienti
ﬁ
c” Development
of Underwriting and
Responsibilization of the
Individual Leads to Greater
Moral Risk

In traditional insurance, the character of a large
number of homogeneous exposure units allows
insurers to bene
ﬁ
t from the so-called law of large
numbers. However, today’s insurance practices


105
7 “Opportunist” Insurance Fraud Under Different Political Economies: Taiwan (Asia) and Europe Compared
are, on the contrary, an attempt to pool all popu-
lations based on a “scienti
ﬁ
c” selection of risk
factors calculated by experts.

Glenn describes underwriting as a “ticking
boxes” process (Glenn
2003
, p. 133). Underwriters
tick off boxes on an application and match them
to a set of clearly de
ﬁ
ned criteria. Glenn argues
that it is a more subjective than objective judg-
ment when underwriting for insurance. But the
fact of the matter is that with the competition in
the market as well as the legal responsibilization
of the individual consumer, more and more
underwriters don’t even bother to pay a home
visit or check whether the object being insured
actually exists before they write up a policy (Jou
and Hebenton
2007
; Niemi
1995
)
.

Since insurance shifts risk from one party to
another, it is essential that there must be utmost
good faith and mutual con
ﬁ
dence between the
insured and the insurer. In a contract of insurance
the insured knows more about the subject matter of
the contract than the insurer. Consequently, he/she
is duty bound to disclose accurately all material
facts and nothing should be withheld or concealed.
Any fact is material, which goes to the root of the
contract of insurance and has a bearing on the risk
involved. If the underwriter knows little about the
insured or purposely leaves the consumer an oppor-
tunity to mislead or conceal relevant information to
sell more insurance, moral risk arises.

Objectively “ticking off” the boxes creates a
more heterogeneous pool, a pool with lots of
anonymous “outsiders.” Responsibilizing the
individual consumer produces further moral risk.
The “scienti
ﬁ
c” underwriting process, including
pooling heterogeneously, along with the respon-
sibilization of the individual consumer destroys
the trust system, consequently making it easier
for insureds to rationalize their fraud.

7.8
An Enterprise Focused on Pro
ﬁ
t
and Investment Enhances Moral
Risk

How does an insurance company make large
pro
ﬁ
ts out of “insuring people’s life or property
loss?” It is clear that the nature of the gift rela-
tionship in insurance has long since changed in
modern society. The transformation from mutual
assistance to the marketplace signals a drastic
departure from a system of a gift relationship to
an economic type of exchange. While status pre-
scribed reciprocal types of exchange, market
relationships are regulated by contract and not
obligation.

Today’s insurance goes beyond safeguard
and mutual help—instead presenting as a

ﬁ
nance and investment industry. The invention
of the “whole” life insurance product is a good
example.


7.9
Three Cases: The UK, Finland,
and Taiwan

Our analysis has demonstrated the role of politi-
cal economy in relation to moral hazard and how
moral risk is embedded within the changing
nature of the modern industry itself. We now turn
to consider three countries, the UK, Finland, and
Taiwan, to further illustrate the relationship
between political economic regimes and oppor-
tunist insurance fraud. In our ideal-type compari-
son, the UK is selected as representative of an
advanced free market society with limited and
fewer welfare services, Taiwan is a market soci-
ety interlinked with some degree of state-pro-
vided provision and informal risk management
culture, and Finland conversely provides a gener-
ous welfare regime with strong protective state
provision (the heuristic value of typologies is
now widely recognized for comparative research
in the social sciences—see Esping-Andersen

1990
; and more recently the work of Hall and
Soskice
2001
)
. The ideal-type comparison is
often linked to the approach and work of Max
Weber; it is common in economic literature. An
ideal type is neither an average type nor a simple
description of the most commonly found features
of real-world phenomena. Thus one does not
construct an ideal type of “bureaucracy” by

ﬁ
nding the features that are shared by real
“bureaucracies.” Nor is ideal used normatively in
the sense of a desirable objective. In essence, it is
a heuristic device, or a method of investigation.

Opportunist Insurance Fraud
in Three Countries

The Association of British Insurers reports that
between 1996 and 2006, claims paid have
increased by 42%, from £13.4 billion in 1996 to
£19.1 billion in 2006 (ABI
2007
)
. Among the dif-
ferent types of insurance, motor claims was the
most frequent, about £8 billion (about 43%) in
2006, followed by £4.6 billion property claims
and £2.8 billion health and accident claims (ABI

2007
)
. An ABI booklet published in 2006
declared that bogus and in
ﬂ
ated insurance claims
in the UK cost over £1.5 billion every year. ABI
also surveyed 1,100 companies and found that
the majority of fraudulent claims arise from the
exaggeration of genuine incidents. Up to 15% of
commercial insurance claims in their survey were
exaggerated in this way (ABI
2005
)
. Another
independent survey undertaken in 2002 by
Karstedt and Farrall
(
2006
) found that 7% of
interviewees aged 25–65 admitted to have pad-
ded an insurance claim in their lifetime and 22%
had the intentions to do so. Karstedt and Farrall
refer to people who commit such crime, along
with other types of “everyday crime,” as “those
who think of themselves as respectable citizens,
and who would de
ﬁ
nitely reject the labels of
“criminals” and “crime” for themselves and their
actions” (Karstedt and Farrall
2006
, p. 1011).
This is simply another way of describing “oppor-
tunist” insurance fraud.

In Finland, it is estimated that every year,
insurance companies uncover 45–55 million euros
in fraudulent insurance scams. In a survey carried
out by the


Federation of Finnish Financial Services

2007
, 5% policyholders scam money from insur-
ance companies; 30% of them approved of exag-
gerating damages when
ﬁ
lling out insurance (a
close de
ﬁ
nition of “opportunist fraud”). About
half of the claims concern damages to automo-
biles, and one-third of the claims for household or
company damages (YLE News
2008
)
.

In Taiwan, as of 2008, no survey has yet been
undertaken to estimate the extent of insurance
fraud. It is usually estimated that 10% of the total
claims is fraudulent by one accepted rule of
thumb (based on the surveys done in the USA or
Australia). In one open speech delivered by the
Taiwanese Chief Commissioner of the Financial
Supervisory Committee, she mentioned a likely
loss in the range of NTD 130 billion (approxi-
mately three billion euros—at May 2008
exchange rate) insurance fraud in 2006 based on
estimates in the USA (Taiwan Insurance Bureau

2008
)
. There is no evidence to check the validity
of this estimation. However, in one telephone
poll, 38% of respondents were said to have made
a claim, and almost 80% of them successfully
obtained their compensation from insurance
companies (Taiwan Institute of Insurance Industry

2005
)
. If we calculate the probability of a claim
denied by insurance company as possible fraudu-
lent cases, it would come up with 8% (possibly
overestimated). If this number is close to the real-
ity, and given a total of NT$1,300 billion insur-
ance claims every year, the possible cost of
fraudulent claims amounts to about NT$104 bil-
lion annually. The most popular claims came
from life and damages/theft to the automobiles
(about 60% of total nonlife insurance claims) and
then came marine,
ﬁ
re, and personal injuries each
accounting for 10% of the total nonlife claims
(Taiwan Insurance Bureau
2008
)
.

Table
7.2 summarizes key facts of insurance
fraud in the three countries. As expected, the UK
and Taiwan have higher estimated opportunist
insurance frauds and much higher costs to the
industry than Finland. One common characteris-
tic across the three countries is that automobile
insurance claim happens to be the most popular
insurance type (and yet perhaps the easiest type
to pad a
claim?).

7.11
The Rise of Antifraud
“Campaigns”: The Public
Discourse

Traditionally, and certainly prior to the late 1980s,
most insurance companies, regardless of country
location, sought not to draw attention to their
level
of
individual
fraud
victimization.
Presumably, this was due to the fact that the
insurance companies have a strong motivation


107
7 “Opportunist” Insurance Fraud Under Different Political Economies: Taiwan (Asia) and Europe Compared
and resources to cope with the offences and to
deal with their “loss.” After all, insurance compa-
nies have the ultimate power to decide if a policy
is granted or a claim can be compensated. In
addition, it is believed that the insurance compa-
nies can pass the cost of fraudulent claims to
other policyholders by simply increasing premi-
ums. Clarke
(
1989
)
suggests that fraud appears as
an embarrassment to the insurance industry,
because it is a symbol of violation of the values
of service, fair dealing, and utmost good faith on
which it is historically proud to act.

However, due to the discovery of the large hid-
den costs of insurance fraud by the insurance
industry, some countries even by the mid-1960s
were advocating early recognition of the problem
and the need for collective reaction to it. Of those
countries, the USA is the global pioneer in terms
of seeking to raise public awareness and seeking
prevention of insurance fraud (Clarke
1990
)
.

However, arguably public perception is quite
different when compared with the industry itself.
In a recent ABI publication, it emphasizes that
“opportunist insurance fraud is dishonest, ulti-
mately costs everyone all money. And there is a
high chance of being caught” (ABI
2006
, p. 3).
Such aggressive publicity appears to sit uneasily
alongside the views of the public-consumer. In
qualitative research done by ABI in 2005, a panel
of employees of 1,100 companies were inter-
viewed by the researcher about a series of sce-
narios and asked in which circumstances people
were most likely to commit fraud. The research
found that 36% of the panel stated that they would
be tempted to commit fraud to avoid disciplinary
action, 33% would do it for personal
ﬁ
nancial
gain, and 27% for work-dissatisfaction or revenge
on their employers (Association of British
Insurers
2005
)
. Avoidance and dissatisfaction
obviously
ﬁ
t the de
ﬁ
nition of “rationalization” in
the fraud triangle model. The motivation of per-
sonal
ﬁ
nancial gain certainly indicates the

ﬁ
nancial pressure on these employees. These are
all “predicted” by the triangle model.

Another notable study argues that British con-
sumers develop a sense of anomie from the unfair
and unethical business practices in the neoliberal
marketplace and this allows them to justify their
“everyday crime” such as padding a claim
(Karstedt and Farrall
2006
)
. According to
Karstedt and Farrall, the major reasons given for
committing these everyday crimes are (1) the fear
of becoming a victim of crime and shady prac-
tices in the marketplace; (2) distrust of market
agents and their practices; and (3) legal cyni-
cism—the extent to which people feel disengaged
from legal norms. These three elements of ano-
mie in the market economy affect people’s moti-
vation to cheat on insurance claims.

Yet, arguably, the three elements proposed by
Karstedt and Farrall do not really take our under-
standing beyond the level of discussion of ratio-
nalization
in
the
fraud
triangle
model.
Nevertheless, their study is valuable in emphasiz-
ing “the crimes of everyday life re
ﬂ
ect the
changes of the economy at the late twentieth cen-
tury. The result of which has been a ‘cornucopia
of new criminal opportunities’” (Karstedt and
Farrall
2006
, p. 1012). A free market is always
seen to produce an abundance of new legal/illegal
opportunities. The rise of unfair and unethical
practices by business and dishonest and unlawful
behavior by consumers destroys any preexisting
bases of traditional morality, especially in regard
to fairness and justice. On the basis of the results
of these kinds of studies, one can see that public
perception of “opportunist” insurance fraud in
the UK may sit uneasily alongside that of the

industry. The public justi
ﬁ
es/rationalizes their
misbehavior as “hitting back.” The industry
attempts to label such “opportunist” fraud as
being “shameful.” Nonetheless, the perceptions
of the public and the industry all are shaped by a
hidden but common denominator—the new neo-
liberal market economy embraced by the UK
since the early 1980s.

Only in the mid-1990s did the Finnish insur-
ance industry begin to pay more attention to
analyzing the characteristics of potential policy-
holders and the possibilities of preventing fraud
by reducing opportunities for fraudulent activity
(Niemi
1995
)
. Violation of social norms is not a
major concern for opportunist fraud among the
Finnish public, especially the younger generation.
A survey done by the University of Turku in 2003
showed that the public’s views on insurance fraud
have not changed much from 1996. The older the
person, the more serious they considered the fraud
to be (Morse and Skajaa
2004
, p. 148). The policy
of insurance companies is guided by economic
reality. Niemi admits that prevention and control
of insurance fraud in Finland are not motivated by
any considerations of the public interest. For the
State, one goal in making insurance fraud a crimi-
nal offence is the maintenance of general respect
for the law. The insurance industry has to solve
insurance fraud independently of the State because
such frauds are widely regarded as “private busi-
ness.” This perspective can be seen in terms of the
published “good practice guidelines for insurance
investigation” regulated by the Federation of
Finnish Financial Services (FFFS
2006

)
. The reg-
ulations specify that “fraud prevention is part of
insurers’ social responsibility” (FFFS
2006
)
. That
is to say that for the State and the people in
Finland, insurers hold primary responsibility for
dealing with insurance fraud.

Finland, as a welfare state, has had low
con
ﬁ
dence in “privatization” since 1990s. For the
public in Finland, there exists the question of
why the insurance industry had not taken a more
proactive approach to the prevention of insurance
fraud. Contrary to Taiwan’s or the UK’s case, the
Finnish preferred that the insurance industry took
private investigatory action, instead of calling for
greater cooperation or help from police, prosecu-
tion, court, or other State agencies. Where such
cooperation was sought, the view was that the
insurance industry ought to “buy in” the services
of police and other state agencies. Turning to the
situation in Asia, Kim and Kwon in their recent
work on Korea point out that “neither the govern-
ment nor the insurance industry paid close atten-
tion to the issue of insurance fraud until the Asian
economic crisis” (Kim and Kwon
2006
)
. The
Asian economic crisis in 1997 caused a near-per-
pendicular depreciation of the currency, eco-
nomic uncertainty, and social insecurity. During
this crisis, some people throughout Asia were
under severe
ﬁ
nancial pressures and in
ﬂ
icted
self-injury or caused damage or staged
ﬁ
res to
their factories, companies, or property in an
attempt to gain compensation from insurance
(Kim and Kwon
2006
, pp. 136–137). If this is the
case in Korea as Kim and Kwon described, it is
important to note that Taiwan shared a similar
experience in the late 1990s. News media indi-
cated a rise of public awareness, and alerted the
government as well as the insurance industry.
Furthermore, in the late 1990s, the Taiwanese
Government embraced a fully open and transpar-
ent international
ﬁ
nancial market, and increasing
incidents of insurance fraud then come along
with the expansion in market business in insur-
ance. The insurance division which had been
established in 1991 then merged with the banking
and investment industry regulators into the
Financial Supervision Commission in 2004. In
the same year, the life and nonlife insurance
industry associations funded the Insurance Anti-
Fraud Institute (IAFI) to respond to a perceived
increase in insurance fraud.

Reactions to Opportunist
Insurance Fraud in Three
Countries

7.12.1
The UK

Of all the areas of insurance fraud, arson (
ﬁ
re)
seems to have offered the most legitimate oppor-
tunity to attract attention from the UK
Government. The Fire Loss Bureau was


109
7 “Opportunist” Insurance Fraud Under Different Political Economies: Taiwan (Asia) and Europe Compared
established as early as 1975 funded by a number
of insurance companies to control the losses from
fraudulent arson (Clarke
1989
)
. The involvement
of the public sector, namely, police, Home Of
ﬁ
ce,
and forensic services, has greatly assisted the
prevention of opportunist fraud.

On the other hand, insurance companies rec-
ognized that the industry suffered from nonpro-
fessional fraudsters and from changes in attitude
on the part of the insured population, who increas-
ingly regard insurance as fair game (Clarke
1990
,
p. 18). Learning from American experience
(because Americans identi
ﬁ
ed the problem at a
relatively early stage and was quick to act) (Morse
and Skajaa
2004
)
, the British started to take pub-
lic initiatives on insurance fraud in the mid-1980s.
In 1987, a Motor Insurance Anti-Fraud and Theft
Register was established by all motor insurers to
collate losses (Cullis
1987
)
. The data collection
and analysis have proved that the information
sharing was useful to discourage attempts to
make false claims. Since then, the innovation and
implementation of data mining techniques have
become a powerful measure for insurance com-
panies to screen high-risk underwriting and to
identify suspicious claims. The creation in 2006
of an Insurance Fraud Bureau to improve the
capability of member insurers to prevent, detect,
and investigate organized insurance fraud was a
major development
ﬁ
nanced by the insurance
sector itself (Jou and Hebenton
2007
)
.

Other reactions against fraud more generally
in the UK include the emergence of a new profes-
sion: the fraud investigator or counter-fraud spe-
cialist (Button et al.
2007
)
. The background to
this profession dates from 1979 and now totals
more than 8,000 people across the public sector
and a large number by private enterprises (for
example, Button et al. estimate that six largest
banks alone have 2,500 in-house investigators).

The legal response to fraud prevention is evi-
denced as part of the Financial Service Act of
1986. A year later, the Serious Fraud Of
ﬁ
ce was
set up to improve the investigation and prosecu-
tion of serious and complex fraud. After a long
process of consultation and review, a speci
ﬁ
c
Fraud Act (2006) was brought before Parliament,
establishing a high-level government Fraud
Review Team overseen by the Financial Services
Authority reporting on strategic action. The Fraud
Act speci
ﬁ
cally de
ﬁ
nes fraud as being committed
when a person “makes a false representation,”
“fails to disclose information to another person
which he/she is under a legal duty to disclose,” or
abuses a position in which he/she is “expected to
safeguard, or not to act against, the
ﬁ
nancial
interests of another person.” The penalties for
fraud under the Act are imprisonment up to 10
years, a
ﬁ
ne, or both (Ormerod
2007
)
.

7.12.2
Finland

In Finland, insurance supervision is regulated by
the 1999 Act on the Insurance Supervision
Authority, and special enactments regarding the
insurance industry. The task of the Finnish
Insurance Supervisory Authority is “to promote
the
ﬁ
nancial stability of insurance and pension
companies as well as other operators in the insur-
ance industry, while maintaining con
ﬁ
dence in
the insurance business” (FIN-ISA
2007
)
. Insurers
are expected to reduce opportunities for the poli-
cyholders to commit fraud against them and to
detect and investigate any detected fraud and,
where needed, report to the authorities. The gov-
ernment plays a supervision role to the industry
rather than becoming involved in preventing and
controlling insurance fraud.

Before 2007, the main organization responsi-
ble for antifraud campaign work was the
Federation of Finnish Insurance Companies
(FFIC). The FFIC was a joint body for insurance
companies operating in Finland, representing
their interests to government authorities, other
trade organizations, and the public. It worked to
promote insurance business, adequate risk man-
agement, and effective loss prevention, setting
out from the idea of insurance. At the beginning
of 2007, as a result of a merger between the
Finnish Bankers’ Association, the FFIC, and the
Employers’ Association of Finnish Financial
Institutions, the Federation of Finnish Financial
Services was set to start operations. The new
FFFS aims “to secure the industry a benign oper-
ating environment, well-functioning
ﬁ
nancial


110
S. Jou
markets and effective payments transmission sys-
tems and to support new opportunities offered to
members by Public-Private Partnership arrange-
ments”. It indeed acts as a liaison point for
information between insurers and with external
bodies.

Most insurance companies establish their
own fraud units or insurance investigators who
specialize in crime investigation. In addition to
setting up special investigation units and gov-
erning under the ISA and FFFS regulations,
Finnish insurers have access to two antifraud
databases, a claims database and another set up
for fraudulent claims (Morse and Skajaa
2004
,
p. 148). The joint claims register is set up with
an aim to prevent customers from getting com-
pensation from several insurers for the same
loss. Over time, the claims register also reveals
persons that sustain losses of a certain kind
exceptionally often. As customers are told about
the existence of a claims register when they
ﬁ
le
a claim, or even earlier, the role of the claims
register as a fraud deterrent is signi
ﬁ
cant. The
second one, the fraudulent claims database, con-
tains details of customers who have committed
insurance fraud. Recently, extensive work in
insurance fraud investigation has resulted in
new prevention tools devised in cooperation
with other European insurers. Prevention of life
and pension insurance fraud operates through a
network built between insurers and security
authorities.


7.12.3
Taiwan

Turning to Taiwan, in 2003 the Financial
Supervisory Committee reformed and enhanced
the capacity of the main government agency, the
Taiwan Insurance Bureau, to supervise the insur-
ance industry [Act Governing the Establishment
of the Financial Supervisory Commission,
Executive Yuan (Promulgated on July 23, 2003)].
As part of the reform, the Bureau was tasked with
developing policy on the control of insurance
fraud. In pursuit of its aims, the Bureau estab-
lished the IAFI in 2004 to coordinate relations
between the insurer, insurance development
association, prosecutor’s of
ﬁ
ce, police,
ﬁ
re depart-
ment, and other sector professionals (see Jou and
Hebenton
2007
)
. The Bureau’s main tasks include
acting as a liaison in multi-governmental agen-
cies meetings with the industry; establishing the
nonlife insurance compulsory reporting and
information enquiry systems across insurers in
2004; promoting share insurers’ online informa-
tion with prosecutors for cases involving suspi-
cious claimants and failure to disclose relevant
information; regulating the insurance companies
to set up an investigation unit or hotline for
claims; raising public awareness about insurance
and the nature of insurance fraud; and promoting
new measures that allow for insurance fraud cases
to be heard in specialized courts (such as the exis-
tence of economic crime specialized
court).
Compared to many other western countries, it is
clear that most preventive actions to control
insurance fraud are initiated and promoted by the
State rather than the private sector.

7.13
Comparative Analysis

For the UK and Taiwan, broadly similar responses
can be seen, though over different time periods,
namely, (1) the establishment of an anti-insur-
ance fraud organization to coordinate across
insurers; (2) creation of an appropriate database
across insurers and implementation of new data
mining or intelligent analysis technique/soft-
ware; (3) publicity on insurance fraud both orga-
nized and opportunist types as a serious crime;
(4) prosecutions and convictions with tougher
penalties; (5) closer work with police and insur-
ance industry; and (6) establishment of in-house
fraud investigation units. At present, Finland is
seemingly reluctant to take a more proactive role
in
ﬁ
ghting opportunist insurance fraud on a com-
prehensive scale.

The UK began preventive actions in the 1980s
and got even more proactive in the last decade,
while Taiwan began its efforts in 2003. In Finland,
selected measures like sharing database information
and forming in-house fraud investigation units


111
7 “Opportunist” Insurance Fraud Under Different Political Economies: Taiwan (Asia) and Europe Compared
began only at the turn of the twenty-
ﬁ
rst century.
Another difference that can be identi
ﬁ
ed is that
most of the UK responses involved cooperation
and greater effort by the industry itself, whereas
in Taiwan, the government set out the
ﬁ
rst moves
to push insurers, working within multi-govern-
mental agencies, and Finland seems to grant
more responsibility to individual insurers and
later the FFFS.

By comparing the three countries, it is evi-
dent that the criminalization of opportunist
insurance fraud, the response to it, the selec-
tion of private/public involvement, and the
making of individual/cooperative efforts are
indeed derived from the characteristics of the
wider political economy. In the UK and Taiwan,
an estimated 7–8% of insurance claims are
fraudulent. Both countries have embraced the
abundant opportunities provided by the market
economy and yet suffer from the inevitably
higher moral hazard and moral risk conse-
quence upon it. An important distinction, how-
ever, is that opportunist insurance fraud in the
UK appears to be portrayed as a “moral war”
between “rotten” business and “dishonest”
customers whereas in Taiwan it is perceived
both as threat to national and social security
and as an individual
ﬁ
nancial problem. The
reason for this lies in Taiwan’s singular politi-
cal relationship to the People’s Republic of
China. As a close neighbor, China has a less
regulated market and combined with possibili-
ties of frequent travel, it is seen as the source
of an increasing number of overseas staged
accidents/deaths and as a market for stolen
automobiles and parts. A further reason is the
recent breakdown of traditional family ties in
Taiwan, which is seen to weaken the informal
security net and place more pressure on indi-
viduals. These explanations are commonly
accepted by government, criminal justice agen-
cies, and the public in Taiwan. Finland, on the
other hand, in general has been less willing to
work with the insurance industry; hence
“opportunist” insurance fraud remains a pri-
vate matter to be solved by individual insur-
ance companies or seen simply as a threat to
private corporate security.


7.14
Conclusion

This paper began by considering the difference
between organized and opportunist insurance
fraud. Organized crime is well described in the
existing published literature, and indeed the
opportunist fraudster can be seen as someone who
recognizes the advantages provided by the situa-
tion. Using the fraud triangle model proposed by
the American criminologist Donald Cressey, it is
easy to understand opportunist insurance fraud
via increasing pressure, rationalization, and crim-
inal opportunity. In the insurance and risk man-
agement literature, moral hazard by the insured is
believed to be the cause of all insurance fraud.
Prevention hence can be easily undertaken via
direct reduction in opportunities and criminaliza-
tion via severe penalties. Data sharing and min-
ing, network analysis, specialized investigation
units, claim management strategies (i.e., more
obstacles in the way of making a claim), prosecu-
tion, conviction, and public shaming are taken to
be useful measures to prevent it.

Such a fraud triangle model however under-
states the reasons why the making of and reaction
to opportunist insurance fraud take different path-
ways in different countries. Moral hazard theory
also un/consciously underestimates the moral
risk caused by the competition of the insurer and
the professional (i.e., medical profession, car
technicians, or police who are sometimes linked
to
the
occurrence
of
insurance
fraud).
Furthermore,
two issues remain puzzling from the existing
criminological theory and moral hazard theory:
one is how insurance companies, given the esti-
mated grand scale of insurance fraud, seemingly
have been largely unaffected and manage to
remain highly lucrative. The second puzzle is that
current prevention measures seem to be rather
silent on reducing individual pressures and appear
ineffective in engaging with the average person’s
moral rationalizations about their everyday
crime—for instance—the padding of a claim.

What is missing in this picture? Put simply,
it is the even larger picture (context). The fraud
triangle model and moral hazard/risk theory
successfully capture aspects of insurance fraud.

S. Jou
Unfortunately, neither tell us much about the
making of opportunist insurance fraud in a
comparative sense and neither explain why
advanced preventive measures taken by for
example the USA, the UK, or Australia are
unable to stop opportunist fraud from being
perceived as “acceptable” by large segments of
the general public. As we have demonstrated in
this paper, antifraud activities are best regarded
as the classic example of “social reaction”—the
more activity one devotes to investigating, the
more one “uncovers” the extent of the problem.
Analyzing perception and action on opportunist
insurance fraud in the USA in the 1970s, the
UK in the 1980s, and Taiwan and Finland in the
turn of twenty-
ﬁ
rst century demonstrates a good
comparative case-study of the process of “social
reaction.” The earlier the reaction, the more
serious
opportunist
fraud
is
discovered.
Moreover, the earlier the country opens up to a
neoliberal free market economy, the harsher the
moral hazard and moral risk it encounters. It is
no coincidence that the rise of opportunist
insurance fraud has been concurrent with
macro-level change at the level of the political
economy in each country. This study’s analysis
suggests that the political economy helps shape
popular sentiment to insurance fraud.

In our comparison, the neoliberal UK has one
of the largest insurance markets in the world, and
faces “serious problems” of opportunist insur-
ance fraud. Taiwan, a society with arguably a
mixture of market and Confucianism ideology,
also holds one of the largest insurance sectors,
and suffers to a broadly similar extent on fraud.
The classical social democratic country, Finland,
possesses a smaller insurance market and suffers
less from opportunist fraud. The public discourse
of and social reaction to opportunist insurance
fraud further demonstrate how the politics of
economy interplays with the fundamental ques-
tion of “who to blame” in three countries. In the
UK, there is a perception gap between the insurer
and the insured on “who to blame.” As addressed
earlier, the insurer blames the dishonest and
greedy policyholder and the public blame it on
unethical and rotten business practice. The gov-
ernment obviously takes the insurer’s side and
initiates a more proactive reaction to prevention.
In the case of Taiwan, opportunist fraud is per-
ceived as a threat to national security, social secu-
rity, and personal
ﬁ
nancial desperation. The
blame is directed both to its political opponent,
China, and to decline in family ties and low self-
control among individuals. By doing so, the
government is able to engage itself in prevention
and control policy and of course downgrades its
responsibility and accountability to deal with the
macro-level problems of economic crisis in the
past 10 years. The Finnish public blames recent
changes in terms related to wider welfare privati-
zation. Thus, in Finland, it is undoubtedly the
insurance company’s responsibility to use their
own resources and initiate preventive and control
actions. The government plays a rather neutral
role between the insurer and the insured.

Our
ﬁ
ndings sit alongside the work of Baker
and Simon
(
2002
)
, Ericson et al.
(
2000
)
, and
Ericson
(
2007
)
. Manufactured risk, risk-taking,
individualism, and insecurity in the neoliberal
market society help create the atmosphere of
“anxiety” in everyday life. More signs of fear and
more security products are made available—
especially when government and family are no
longer seen as “capable”—it is now the responsi-
bility of individuals. Market society is saturated
with fears—fear of risk, fear of not taking risk,
fear of the withdrawal of the State, fear of the
breakdown of family support, and fear of insecu-
rity. The huge growth in the market for insurance
is undeniably facilitated by the summation of
knowledge of “fears.” Arguably, people with
greater anxieties “consume” more un/necessary
insurance policies or are over-insured. Scienti
ﬁ
c
underwriting and the investment vision of mod-
ern insurance, on the other hand, also act to trig-
ger moral risks, that is, to endorse the imaginary
risks and to promote/sell more unnecessary insur-
ance policies to insecure people. The chance to
pro
ﬁ
t from losses incites the unscrupulous to
fraudulent behavior. When deceptive insurance
sales become institutionalized, it certainly makes
the insurance business a troublesome practice in
terms of generating more opportunist fraud
(Ericson and Doyle
2006
)
.

Julian Le Grand, the British social policy
theorist, has an interesting metaphor, where in
the context of the interplay of contemporary


113
7 “Opportunist” Insurance Fraud Under Different Political Economies: Taiwan (Asia) and Europe Compared
government policy and behavior, one can, he
says, distinguish a “knave” strategy on “knightly”
behavior and a “knight” strategy on “knavely”
behavior (Le Grand
1997

)
. Le Grand de
ﬁ
nes
“knaves” as people motivated primarily by their
own self-interest, “knights” are predominantly
public spirited or altruistic, and “pawns” are
people who are essentially passive or unrespon-
sive (Le Grand
1997
, p. 154). Arguably, the poli-
tics of the neoliberal economy is a “knave”
strategy which introduces manufactured fears
and anomie in modern life that, in turn, incentiv-
izes the average person to act as an opportunist
fraudster or a criminal of everyday life—to be
“knaves” regardless of their human nature as
knights, knaves, or pawns. And it is this bigger
picture in relation to opportunist insurance fraud
that is missing in both the basic fraud triangle
model and moral hazard theory. In an investiga-
tion using an ideal-type typology, and examining
macro-level political economy and culture, it is
easy to be accused of naïve reductionism—but
our view is that such interrelationships need to
be fully recognized at the explanatory level while
also noting that the nature of such relationships
is likely to be highly mediated rather than simple
and direct, and indeed will require the use of dif-
ferent methods and sources of data to explore
their complexities.

Introduction

With rapid globalization, illicit drug traf
ﬁ
cking
and misuse have become worldwide phenomena
from which almost no nation has immunity. Due
to the availability of drugs and cultural traditions
of using illicit drugs, different types of drugs may
be traf
ﬁ
cked and abused in different regions and
countries. Based on the types of drugs traf
ﬁ
cked
and abused, three dominant transnational drug
markets are recognized globally, namely, markets
for heroin, cocaine, and cannabis. While the
markets for these traditional drugs have tended to
remain steady at the global level over the past
decades, amphetamine-type stimulants (ATS)
have quickly gained popularity worldwide, in
particular among a young user population.

Asia is renowned for its long history of opium
cultivation and use. For this reason, the world’s
three largest opium producers are all located in
Asia. Before Afghanistan’s opium production
surpassed that of the Golden Triangle in the late
1980s, Myanmar, as the major opium producer in
the Golden Triangle, was the world’s top opium-
producing country. It is now the second largest
(UNODC
2010d
)
.

2  Lao PDR is the world’s third-
largest opium producer. In addition to producing
the most opium, Afghanistan also produces the
most cannabis resin (UNODC
2010a
)
.

3  Asia,
more precisely Southeast Asia, also claims the
biggest share of the world’s ATS market.
Myanmar is also a major methamphetamine
producer (UNODC
2010d
)
, and India has become
a source of ketamine (UNODC
2010c
)
. Illicit
drugs produced/manufactured in Asia are not
only traf
ﬁ
cked and consumed inside Asia, but
they are also distributed to the underground
market in other continents, such as North America
and Europe.

Illicit drug traf
ﬁ
cking has brought about
signi
ﬁ
cant societal, political, and legal conse-
quences for Asian countries, in particular the
major producer countries (Cornell and Swanström

2006
; Dupont
1999
)
. Studies have found that
illicit drug trade in Asia has been closely linked
to social instability, widespread of
ﬁ
cial corrup-
tion, and transnational crime in the region (Chalk

2000
; Cornell
2006
)
. The drug trade not only
challenges the national sovereignty of states
(Dupont
1999
) but also poses increased threats to

According to the reports from the United Nations, ATS
refer to a group of synthetic substances comprising
amphetamine, methamphetamine, methcathinone, and
ecstasy-group substances (MDMA and its analogues). In
different countries, ATS street names may differ (UNODC

2009b
)
.

2
There are four countries in the Golden Triangle: Myanmar,
also known as Burma, Lao PDR, Vietnam, and Thailand.


3 This estimation was based on the high resin yields mea-
sured in Afghanistan (145 kg/ha), which are four times
higher than those in Morocco (36 kg/ha measured in
2005)—another major cannabis production country
(UNODC
2010a
)
.

both regional and international security.

4  As the
second-largest illegal transnational business in
the world (next to the arms trade), the illicit drug
trade’s link to terrorism has been also observed
by scholars (Jackson
2006
; Mccoy
2000
)
.

In Asia, a major source region for opium,
cannabis, and ATS, the number of people who
abuse illicit drugs is signi
ﬁ
cant. The social harms
brought about by illicit drug abuse are enormous.
Asia, home to two-thirds of the world’s popula-
tion, has the second-highest HIV infection rate in
the world. As of 2009, 4.7 million people in Asia
were HIV infected. The high HIV infection rate
is primarily drug related. The HIV infection rate
among injecting drug users (IDUs) is as high as
16%, and in some countries, such as Thailand
and Vietnam, the infection rate has reached
30–50% and 32–58%, respectively (UNAIDS

2010
)
. The HIV/AIDS epidemic in Asia affects
not only the drug users themselves but also their
families, communities, and many aspects of the
larger society as well. According to the United
Nations
Human
Development
Programme
(UNDP)
(
2010
)
, most of the world’s multidimen-
sional poor live in Asia (51% in South Asia and
15% in East Asia and the Paci
ﬁ
c). The impact of
HIV/AIDS on Asian countries, in particular those
countries in poor economic shape, has been
particularly devastating.

Due to the substantial consequences of illicit
drug traf
ﬁ
cking and drug abuse for Asian coun-
tries, this chapter focuses its discussions on two
central issues: illicit drug traf
ﬁ
cking and drug
misuse in Asia. The
ﬁ
rst part of the chapter intro-
duces illicit drug production in major producer
countries in Asia as well as current markets and
major drug traf
ﬁ
cking routes; the second part of
the chapter shows drug consumption patterns in
Asia, the social consequences of drug use, and
treatment modalities provided for drug users.
Responses of the criminal justice system and an
assessment of the effectiveness of the policies
will also be addressed for both sections.

8.2
Drug Traf
ﬁ
cking in Asia

The legal framework for addressing illicit
international drug traf
ﬁ
cking is based on three
major international drug control treaties: the
Single Convention on Narcotic Drugs of 1961
(as amended in 1972), the Convention on
Psychotropic Substances of 1971, and the United
Nations Convention against Illicit Traf
ﬁ
c in
Narcotic Drugs and Psychotropic Substances of
1988. Following these treaties, the Commission
on Narcotic Drugs and the International Narcotics
Control Board were established. According to the
United Nations, drug traf
ﬁ
cking is de
ﬁ
ned as a
global illicit trade involving the cultivation,
manufacture, distribution, and sale of substances
subject to drug prohibition laws. To advance the
understanding of illicit drug traf
ﬁ
cking and
consumption in the world, the General Assembly
of the United Nations in 1998 mandated UNODC
to publish comprehensive data about the world’s
drug production, traf
ﬁ
cking, and consumption.
Starting in 1999, UNODC began to publish its
annual report
Global Illicit Drug Trends
. In 2004,
UNODC merged
Global Illicit Drug Trends and
the
World Drug Report.
In its report published in
2010, the United Nations identi
ﬁ
ed three major
illicit drug markets worldwide: the heroin
market, the cocaine market, and the ATS market.
5
In general, different drug markets have shown
different traf
ﬁ
cking patterns: heroin and cocaine
traf
ﬁ
cking is mainly involved in long-distance
traf
ﬁ
cking between continents while ATS and
cannabis resin traf
ﬁ
cking is primarily limited to
the producers’ regions (UNODC
2010a
)
.

8.2.1

Opiate and Heroin Market in Asia

According to the
World Drug Report (2010),
global opium poppy cultivation declined to
181,400 hectares (ha) in 2009, a 23% reduction

4 For instance, countries in central Asia, on the major drug
traf
ﬁ
cking routes from Afghanistan to the Russian
Federation and Europe, have seen national security at all
levels impaired (Cornell
2005
)
.

5 While cannabis production is found throughout most of
Asia, it is not covered by
World Drug Report 2010 because
cannabis is mainly consumed locally in producer coun-
tries and is not subject to transnational market analysis
(UNODC
2010a
)
.


117
8 Drug Abuse and Drug Traf
ﬁ
cking in Asia
compared to 2007. While both global opium and
heroin production fell since 2007, a signi
ﬁ
cant
increase in opium production (from 4,346 to
7,754 mt) in 2009 was evident (UNODC
2010a
)
.
In Afghanistan, the world’s leading opium pro-
ducer, the total opium poppy cultivation in 2010
largely remained the same as the previous year’s
at 123,000 ha, representing two-thirds of the
opium cultivation in the world. However, yield
fell from 56.1 to 29.2 kg/ha due to a plant disease
(UNODC
2010b
)
.
6 In Myanmar, the second-
largest opium production country, the opium
poppy cultivation began to surge in 2006 (from
21,600 ha in 2006 to 38,100 in 2010) (UNODC

2010d
)
. Lao PDR is still ranked as the world’s
third-largest producer of opium; however, its
cultivation has signi
ﬁ
cantly decreased in recent
years (Reid et al.
2006
)
.

Although Afghanistan has cultivated opium
for centuries, opiate production began to surge
in the 1990s. The Soviet Union’s withdrawal in
1989 and the country’s breakup in early 1991
are viewed as two major events that boosted
Afghanistan’s opium production (Mccoy
2000
)
.
Before the Taliban took power in 1996 and estab-
lished the Islamic Emirate of Afghanistan in
Kabul, the country was largely controlled by
regional powers (Cornell
2006
)
. Until today, the
central government’s inability to exercise its
administrative power over different regions in the
country is still the primary reason that opium
cultivation thrives. Ninety-eight percent of opium
production in Afghanistan is concentrated in nine
southern and western provinces—areas under the
strong in
ﬂ
uence of antigovernment elements or
organized criminal networks. The United Nations
Department of Safety and Security (UNDSS)
classi
ﬁ
ed the security level of these provinces as
high or extreme risk (UNODC
2010b
)
.

Lack of security is also the main reason the
Golden Triangle was at one time able to become
the world’s largest opium cultivation area. In
Myanmar, the major producer country in the
Golden Triangle, opium production regions are
occupied by ethnic opposition groups that have a
self-administrated autonomy outside government
control (Kramer et al.
2009
)
. Another similarity
shared by Afghanistan and Myanmar is poorly
developed local economies. According to the
UNDP 2010 report, the Human Development
Index (HDI) for both Afghanistan and Myanmar
was in the low development category with a gross
national income (GNI) per capita at $1,419 and
$1,591, respectively. Opium production areas in
these countries are found in extremely poor areas.
A survey conducted in Afghanistan indicated that
farmers were motivated to cultivate opium poppies
mostly for economic reasons (47%) (UNODC

2010b
)
.

Regardless of increasing heroin use in Asia in
recent years, western Europe and the Russian
Federation are still the two largest heroin con-
sumer markets worldwide (UNDOC
2010a
)
. For
this reason, drug traf
ﬁ
cking routes have been
developed with a purpose of connecting the
producer countries with these two consumer
countries. Due to Afghanistan’s proximity to
western Europe and the Russian Federation, illicit
drugs from there are traf
ﬁ
cked mainly to these
two destinations via three major drug traf
ﬁ
cking
routes: the Balkan route, the Northern route, or
what might be called the Pakistani route, where
neighboring Pakistan is simply used as a distribu-
tion center. Iran and Turkey are the major transit
countries of Balkan route, and Central Asia is
responsible for drugs traf
ﬁ
cked from Afghanistan
to the Russian Federation.
7 Among Central Asian
countries, Tajikistan is the most vulnerable nation
affected by drug traf
ﬁ
cking due to its long shared
border with Afghanistan. Weak border control
and ethnic connections on the two sides are
also contributing factors (Engvall
2006
)
.
8 Drug
traf
ﬁ
cking in Tajikistan is primarily small scale;
for example, about 80% of seizures made from

The average farm-gate price of dry opium at harvest
time (weighted by production) in 2010 reached $169/kg
(a 164% increase) compared to 2009. As a market
response, the gross income for farmers also increased
36% (to $4,900) (UNODC
2010b
)
.

7 Central Asian countries include Tajikistan, Uzbekistan,
Turkmenistan, Kyrgyzstan, and Kazakhstan.

8 The Tajio population, situated mostly in the northern
border area, constitutes 20–25% of Afghanistan’s
population.

2005 to 2007 totaled 10 kg or less, with the
average size of 2.6 kg (UNODC
2010a
)
. In the
third drug traf
ﬁ
cking route via Pakistan, drugs
are traf
ﬁ
cked to many destinations, including
Iran (with Europe as the
ﬁ
nal destination), Africa,
the Middle East, and other Asian countries
(UNODC
2010a
)
.

Myanmar, the second-largest opium-producing
country, is also central to the global heroin trade.
Its drug traf
ﬁ
cking pattern has been greatly
shaped by changes in the consumer market. While
in the past heroin produced in the Golden Triangle
area primarily supplied North America and non-
Asian markets, beginning in the 1990s heroin
traf
ﬁ
cking became more focused on the Asian
market, in particular East Asia (Dupont
1999
)
.
With China’s economic reform and resulting
open-door policy in the late 1970s, more border
crossings were created along the border of China
and Myanmar. China, initially a gateway for
drugs traf
ﬁ
cked to other Southeast Asian coun-
tries and North America, has gradually become a
major consumer market with more than one
million heroin users currently. As observed at
cross-border drug traf
ﬁ
cking points between
Myanmar and China (Chin and Zhang
2007
, p. 5),
drug traf
ﬁ
cking patterns similar to those in
Central Asia have become apparent: drugs
traf
ﬁ
cked in large quantities have largely disap-
peared; instead, small quantities carried by large
number of individuals are typical.

8.2.2

Amphetamine-Type Stimulants
Market in Asia

ATS have gained popularity worldwide in the
past decades. At present, the manufacture of ATS
has spread throughout more than one-third of the
countries in the world (UNODC
2010a
)
. Asia, in
particular East and Southeast Asia, has become
the home of the world’s largest ATS manufacturers.
Unlike plant-based drugs, ATS can be made in
small clandestine laboratories as long as the
precursors are available. Unfortunately, China
and India are the world’s two largest producers of
ephedrine and pseudoephedrine—the precursor
chemicals for ATS
.
9
,
10 Due to the concealed
nature of ATS manufacture, only very limited
number of ATS laboratories are uncovered by
law enforcement. For example, in Myanmar, a
major ATS producer in Asia, only 39 manufac-
turing facilities (mostly small scale) have been
detected over the past decade (UNODC
2010c
)
.
Because of the clandestine nature of ATS produc-
tion, it is impossible to estimate its scope. Clearly,
gathering global ATS data is an urgent need.

In response to the increase in ATS manufac-
turing, UNODC launched the Global Synthetics
Monitoring: Analyses, Reporting and Trends
(SMART) Program in 2008. The region of East
and Southeast Asia was chosen as the
ﬁ
rst focus
region due to the area’s extreme ATS problems.
The
ﬁ
rst SMART annual report was published in
2009, and the second report became available in
2010. The data for these reports were gathered
from the Drug Abuse Information Network for
Asia and the Paci
ﬁ
c (DAINAP), which was initi-
ated by the United Nations Of
ﬁ
ce on Drugs and
Crime in 2005.
11 In general, those countries (or
regions) with a longer history of ATS abuse, such
as Japan, the Philippines, Singapore, and Taiwan,
have well-maintained national data collection
systems in place (Humeniuk and Ali
2004
)
.
Although South Asia was also included in
SMART, only very limited information is avail-
able because uni
ﬁ
ed national reporting systems
largely do not exist in those countries.

While ATS manufacturing originated in
Europe, it is evident that the abuse of ATS has
quickly increased in Asia in the past decades.
Responding to changes in drug-use culture and,
most importantly, pursuing huge pro
ﬁ
ts from the

9
Ephedrine seizures, reported by India since 2002
(126 kg), reached their peak in 2008 (1,284 kg) (UNODC

2009b
)
; in China, it was reported that a total of 1,113 tons
of precursors were seized in 2008 (NNCC
2009
)
.

10

Alternative precursors are also detected in MDMA
manufacture and substitute drugs (such as safrole-rich oils
from Southeast Asia), which are not under international
control or regulated by Asian countries (UNODC
2010a
)
.

11
DAINAP is an Internet-based drug use information
system which has 11 participating countries, including 10
countries from the Association of Southeast Asia Nations
(ASEAN) and China. Information from DAINAP was
supplemented with data from government sources and
secondary research.

underground drug market, heroin manufacturers
have diversi
ﬁ
ed their production by either
including synthetic drug manufacture or com-
pletely replacing heroin production (Humeniuk
and Ali
2004
)
. Now Myanmar has become the
main producer of opium, heroin, and ATS in
Asia. China is also considered a major producer
of methamphetamines in Asia—1 of 31 countries
where the largest number of ATS laboratories
have been detected (UNODC
2010a
)
. In South
Asia, India is the main source of manufacture and
traf
ﬁ
cking of ATS. India has become a source of
ketamine largely because the drug is manufac-
tured legally in the country. In spite of increased
controls on the substance by the Indian
Government, the drug continues to be traf
ﬁ
cked
to countries in East Asia (UNODC
2008
)
.
12 The
quantity of ketamine seized by Indian law
enforcement agencies has continuously increased
over the past 5 years (UNODC
2010c
)
.
13 ATS
manufacture and traf
ﬁ
cking have also been active
in other regions of Asia. The Middle East has
emerged as a major new market with demand for
pills called
Captagon, the brand name for
Fenethylline (or Phenethylinne), a member of
ATS. It was reported that close to 30% of global
ATS seizures in 2007 were made in the Near and
Middle East (
UNODC 2009c). For the
ﬁ
rst time,
ATS laboratories have been located in Iran and
Sri Lanka (UNODC
2010a
)
.

As reviewed in this section, Afghanistan and
Myanmar are the two major players in the world’s
illicit drug market in Asia. Drug markets centered
in those countries have also been
ﬁ
rmly estab-
lished. Though it is relatively easy to identify
drug-producing countries, it is more dif
ﬁ
cult to
locate major drug traf
ﬁ
cking routes due to their
dynamic nature. As observed in Afghanistan and
Myanmar, the emergence of drug traf
ﬁ
cking
routes is determined by two major factors: the
location of the producer market and the location
of the consumer market. How drug traf
ﬁ
cking
routes develop is primarily determined by the
distance between these two markets. In the
case of heroin traf
ﬁ
cking, there is a subtle differ-
ence between the Afghanistan and Myanmar
markets. While heroin produced in Myanmar
tends to be traf
ﬁ
cked within the region, heroin
produced in Afghanistan is traf
ﬁ
cked to regions
beyond Asia. Unlike the heroin market, however,
ATS produced in Asia is consumed locally, and
intraregional drug traf
ﬁ
cking is more typical with
its relatively less expensive network and quick
money return (Dupont
1999
)
.

8.2.3

Criminal Justice Responses
to Drug Traf
ﬁ
cking

With increased globalization and economic
activity between countries, it becomes more
challenging to control drug traf
ﬁ
cking. While
geography plays an important role in drug
traf
ﬁ
cking, as reviewed previously, a country’s
political, social, and economic factors are also
linked to the effectiveness of its criminal justice
system’s responses to drug traf
ﬁ
cking. Above all,
the weakness of state institutional capacity is one
of the major concerns in responding to drug
traf
ﬁ
cking (Jackson
2006
)
. Weak states are more
vulnerable to the drug trade, and the drug trade in
turn further weakens the state’s administrative
power (Cornell and Swanström
2006
)
, as is
evident in Afghanistan’s and Myanmar’s experi-
ence with the drug trade. In Myanmar, due to the
cease-
ﬁ
re agreement between the government
and armed ethnic opposition groups, the latter
gained a self-administered autonomy that rendered
them largely out of the government’s control.
Meanwhile, drug production and traf
ﬁ
cking are
also driven by local economic factors. For example,
in Tajikistan, about 30% of its population is

ﬁ
nancially depending on the illicit drug business.
Largely due to this reason, it is not unusual that
Central Asian countries’ budgets rely heavily on
drug traf
ﬁ
cking, as demonstrated in Kyrgyzstan
and Tajikistan (Jackson
2006
)
. In Myanmar, the

12 Ketamine has also emerged as an adulterant in the man-
ufacture of ecstasy in East and Southeast Asia (UNODC

2008
)
.

13 The quantity of ketamine seized by Indian law enforce-
ment has increased from 60 kg in 2005 to more than 1 mt
in 2009 (UNODC
2010c
)
.


120
H. Gao
Burmese Government also acquires a substantial
amount of money from drug lords. For this reason,
drug control in Myanmar is often politicized and
pursued without much vigor (Chin
2009
)
.

Meanwhile, the failure to control drug
traf
ﬁ
cking effectively in Asia is also attributed
to widespread corruption among government
of
ﬁ
cials, even top of
ﬁ
cials in major producer
areas such as Afghanistan and Central Asian
countries. Government of
ﬁ
cials frequently get
involved in criminal networks and drug traf
ﬁ
c-
king. It certainly weakens border control when
corruption became so prevalent. For example, on
the northern border of Afghanistan, a major drug
traf
ﬁ
cking route to Central Asia, border security
is largely out of the control of the central Kabul
administration. On the side of Central Asia, a
similar level of corruption exists (Walker
2005
)
.
In East Asia, corruption has also spread among
government of
ﬁ
cials and members of the security
forces (Dupont
1999
)
. Controlling drug traf
ﬁ
c-
king certainly imposes challenges to these unde-
veloped states.

In terms of a legal framework to stop drug
traf
ﬁ
cking, Asian countries have adopted harsh
drug policies against drug-related offenses,
including the death penalty. All six countries
listed by the International Harm Reduction
Association as high commitment states, where
the death penalty is exercised with regularity, are
located in Asia: China, Iran, Saudi Arabia,
Vietnam, Singapore, and Malaysia. The majority
of executions for drug offenses are carried out by
these countries (Gallahue and Lines
2010
)
.
According to the Criminal Law of P. R. China,
drug dealing is strictly prohibited; criminal
responsibility for heroin dealing or traf
ﬁ
cking is
determined by the quantity of drugs involved;
the death penalty might be imposed on whoever
sells or traf
ﬁ
cs more than 50 g of heroin, or
1,000 g of opium. Regardless of harsh punish-
ment on drug offenses, not only did the total
amount of illicit drugs traf
ﬁ
cked in China tremen-
dously increase in the past two decades, but a
wide variety of illicit drugs, such as ATS, also
began to emerge in the underground drug market
one after another.



8.3
Drug Misuse in Asia

According to the Word Drug Report (2010),
between 155 and 250 million people (3.5 to 5.7%
of the world’s population aged 15–64) abused
illicit drugs at least once in 2008. The largest
drug use population (129–190 million) used
cannabis.
14 In 2009, opiate users were largely
from East/Southeast Asia (2.83–5.06 million),
with users in the Near and Middle East as the
second (1.89 and 3.82 million) (UNODC
2010a
)
.
The ATS user population ranked second (between
14 and 53 million), and they were primarily
methamphetamine users.
15
,
16 It is predicted that
the ATS user population will exceed that of
opiate and cocaine users soon.

Regardless of types of drugs abused, between
16 and 38 million drug users (10–15%) in 2008
were “problem drug users” (UNODC
2010a
)
.

8.3.1

Patterns of Illicit Drug Abuse
in Asia

Opium has been used in Asia for several centu-
ries both for medical and recreational purposes,
but its popularity has diminished with the emer-
gence of ATS.
18 While heroin still ranked as the

14 Between 12.8 and 21.8 million people (0.3–0.5% of the
world population aged 15–64) used opiates in 2008
(UNDOC
2010a

)
. In Asia, opiate users were largely
from East/Southeast Asia (2.83–5.06 million) (UNDOC

2010a
)
.

15 Ecstasy users were also included in this category
(between 10.5 and 25.8 million), but ketamine users were
not counted (UNDOC
2010a
)
.

16
While amphetamine is preferred in Europe, about half of
the stimulant users in North America use methamphet-
amine (UNDOC 2009c).

17 UNODC de
ﬁ
nes “problem drug users”—those who
inject drugs and/or are considered dependent, facing
serious social and health consequences (UNODC
2010a
,
p. 16).

18 Between 12.8 and 21.8 million people (0.3–0.5% of the
world population aged 15–64) used opiates in 2008
(UNDOC
2010a

)
. In Asia, opiate users were largely

2010a
)
.


121
8 Drug Abuse and Drug Traf
ﬁ
cking in Asia
primary drug of use in China, Malaysia,
Myanmar, Singapore, and Vietnam, most coun-
tries in Asia witnessed stable or decreasing trends
in heroin use (including Myanmar, an opium
producer country). Lao PDR is the only country
in Southeast Asia that reported increased opium
use in 2009 (UNODC 2009c). As a general
phenomenon, both opium and heroin use tended
to decline in Asia while the use of metham-
phetamine pills has increased tremendously
(UNODC 2009c; UNODC
2010d
)
. However, in
Afghanistan, illicit drug use has shown a com-
pletely different pattern. Cannabis, opium, and
heroin are the top three drugs abused there, with
a signi
ﬁ
cant increase in opium and heroin use
since 2005 (53% and 140%, respectively) (UNDOC

2009a
)
.
19

In East and Southeast Asia, ATS, in particular
methamphetamine, make up one of the top three
drug categories consumed in all countries in the
region. While methamphetamine is a primary
drug abused in East and Southeast Asia, the so-
called
captagon (often containing amphetamine)
has gained popularity in the Near and Middle
East (UNDOC
2010c
)
. It is evident that drug use
culture in these countries is beginning to favor
ATS substances. At the present time, more than
two-thirds of the world’s ATS users live in the
region, and the number is still growing (UNODC

2010c

)
. Regardless of differences in social,
cultural, and economic factors, young people in
the area are more likely to use ATS in club
settings for social, recreational reasons or simply
to improve productivity and concentration
(Humeniuk and Ali
2004
; UNDOC 2009c).
Unlike in Afghanistan, young people in the
Golden Triangle (Wa area), with its increased
involvement in the methamphetamine trade,
have begun to switch their drug use preference
from opium or heroin to methamphetamine, and
a large consumer market for ATS use also has
formed in Thailand (Chin
2009
)
. The abuse of
methamphetamine began in East Asian countries
at different times. In Japan, methamphetamine
use began as early as the 1940s after the Second
World War (Sato
2008
)
; in South Korea it emerged
in the mid-1980s (Chung et al.
2004
)
. However,
in China, ATS use did not start until the early
1990s.

To understand the scope of illicit drug abuse,
some Asian countries or regions, such as China,
Hong Kong, Macao, Malaysia, Myanmar, and
Vietnam, maintain a system of registration for
apprehended drug users. According to these
databases, China, Indonesia, the Philippines, and
Thailand all have drug use populations of more
than one million. However, the real number of
drug users is estimated to be much larger because
many drug users may never have been caught by
police, in particular ATS users. Only a few Asian
countries use a national household survey (as
does Thailand and the Philippines) or national
surveillance of drug use (as does China and
Cambodia) to compile information about drug
users (Devaney et al.
2007
)
. However, in South
Asia, the data system often fails to differentiate
between various synthetic drugs (UNODC
2010c
)
.

As indicated in the United Nations report, the
lack of data in some parts of Asia and the Paci
ﬁ
ca
Islands is still an obstacle to estimating the scope
of the drug use problem (UNDOC
2010a
)
.
According to the UNODC, while cannabis users
and opiate users are reported systematically by
Asian countries, ATS and cocaine users are only
reported by East/Southeast Asian countries; for
all other regions, including South Asia, Central
Asia, and the Near and Middle East, not even
estimates can be provided (UNODC 2009c). To
improve the understanding of ATS abuse in Asia,
UNODC Regional Centre for East Asia and the
Paci
ﬁ
c launched the project
Improving ATS Data
and Information Systems (TDRASF97) in 2002 in
an attempt to aid the countries in the region in
developing and analyzing their national data.
20

As previously addressed, the SMART Program

19 In Afghanistan, there are approximately one million
adult drug users, who represent about 8% of the popula-
tion aged 15–64 (UNDOC
2009a
)
.

20 Countries participating in the project are Cambodia,
China, Indonesia, Lao PDR, Myanmar, the Philippines,
Thailand, and Vietnam while government agencies in
Australia, Brunei, Darussalam, Japan, Malaysia, and
Singapore participate in the network. The project is
supported through funding provided by the governments
of Australia and Japan (UNODC
2007
)

was created in 2008. According to its report, it is
estimated that between 3.4 million and 20.7 million
persons in the region used amphetamines in 2009
(UNODC
2010c
)
.

8.3.2

Consequences of Illicit
Drug Abuse

Illicit drug abuse has signi
ﬁ
cant consequences
for both the individuals who abuse drugs and
society at large. While drug users quite often are
involved in income-generating activities to

ﬁ
nance their drug use, substance abuse also
brings about other social harms, HIV/AIDS in
particular. Drug injection and needle and syringe
sharing have been linked to increased HIV/AIDS.
While injection is commonly used to administer
heroin, it is also used to administer ATS in some
Asian countries with growing numbers (Devaney
et al.
2007
; Humeniuk and Ali
2004
; Kramer et al.

2009
)
.
21 Since the
ﬁ
rst case of HIV due to drug
injection in Asia was identi
ﬁ
ed in Bangkok in
1987, the drug-related HIV infection rate has
substantially increased in the region (UNDOC

2009a
)
.

One of the most problematic issues related to
injection is needle and syringe sharing. In a recent
large-scale survey (
N = 2,614) conducted in
Afghanistan, the majority of IDUs (87%) had
shared a needle and syringe with other drug users
(UNDOC
2009a
)
. A cross-sectional study con-
ducted in Vietnam among young and female drug
users under age 25 recruited from drug treatment
centers (
N = 560) and the community (
N = 240)
also indicated that over half of them began inject-
ing heroin or opium (57%) after a year’s smoking.
Among injectors, 23% shared needles and 71%
were sexually active (among them, 77% had
unprotected sex) (Thao et al.
2006
)
.

Among the world’s drug use population, a
large number of users inject drugs—between 11
and 21 million people worldwide are injection
drug users. Although the heroin epidemic
emerged in China only in the late 1980s, China
has been listed as one of the four countries
worldwide with the largest population of IDUs.
22
According to the United Nations, East and
Southeast Asia is reported as one of the regions
in the world (and the only region in Asia) with
both the largest number and highest concentra-
tion of HIV infection rates (UNODC 2009c).
23
In 2008, 4.7 million (3.8 million–5.5 million)
people in Asia were living with HIV, the second-
highest concentration in the world next to sub-
Saharan Africa. India alone accounts for roughly
half of Asia’s HIV prevalence. In the same year
the total number of AIDS-related deaths in Asia
reached 330,000 (260,000–400,000). For East
Asia, the rate of HIV-related mortality in 2008
was more than three times higher than that in
2000 (UNAIDS
2009
)
.

Infection rates among IDUs in northern
Myanmar are among the highest in the world.
Myanmar, Cambodia, and Thailand are the
countries affected most by HIV/AIDS in Asia
(Kramer et al.
2009
)
. In Central Asia, countries
that are located on the main drug traf
ﬁ
cking
route with high concentrations of poverty and
poor health care systems, such as Uzbekistan,
Tajikistan, and Turkmenistan, have been struck
much harder by HIV (Walker
2005
)
. A survey
conducted with female regular sex partners of
drug users and injection drug users (
N = 4,612) in
Bangladesh, Bhutan, India, Nepal, and Sri Lanka
also indicated a low condom use rate (21%)
between male drug users and their female sex
partners. Due to the high HIV infection rates in
these countries, a big concern is whether HIV
infection will easily spread to the general popula-
tion (Kumar et al.
2008
)
.

8.3.3

Criminal Justice Responses
to Substance Abuse

Illicit drug use is highly criminalized in many
Asian countries. With a rapidly increasing prison

21 The most common means of administration for ATS
substances are smoking, snorting, and fume inhaling.

22 China, the United States, the Russian Federation, and
Brazil together account for 45% of total IDUs (UNODC
2009c).

23
This report also included Eastern Europe and Latin
America (Eastern Europe and Central Asia also had very
high HIV infection rates).


123
8 Drug Abuse and Drug Traf
ﬁ
cking in Asia
population and annual arrest rates, Southeast
Asia would appear to have the toughest laws in
the world against drug users (Gallahue and Lines

2010
)
. Myanmar is one of those countries that
has criminalized drug addiction. According to its
antidrug law published in 1993, if drug addicts
fail to register with government medical facilities
or are unsuccessful in treatment, they are subject
to 3–5 years’ imprisonment (Kramer et al.
2009
)
.
In Thailand, according to its “war on drugs”
policy initiated in 2003, drug users who failed
to participate in the drug treatment programs
provide by the government were subject to the
compulsory drug treatment for 4 months
(Vongchak et al.
2005
)
. In Afghanistan, con-
sumption of opium products may also result in a
prison term for 3 months (Todd et al.
2005
)
.
Harsh punishment for substance abuse raises
concern about compulsory drug treatment centers
in some Asian countries, which often have exer-
cised arbitrary detention and failed to follow due
process of law (Harm Reduction International

2010
)
.
24 As a result, a large number of drug users
have been incarcerated merely because of drug
consumption. For example, in Thailand, the
number of drug-related incarcerations increased

ﬁ
ve times (from 12,860 to 67,440) between 1992
and 1999 (Beyrer et al.
2003
)
. In China, while
the central government began to emphasize
community-based treatment programs in the
recent years, the total number of drug users who
served time in compulsory treatment programs
still reached 173,000 in 2009 (NNCC
2010
)
.
As far as incarceration is concerned, inadequate
health care inside these facilities is another issue.
Forced or involuntary testing for HIV in compul-
sory drug rehabilitation centers has also been
reported in several countries, such as China,
Malaysia, and Vietnam (Harm Reduction
International
2010
)
.

Despite such deterrents to drug use, post-
release relapse rates are extremely high in Asian
countries. A study conducted in China with
female heroin users indicated that the success
rate among those who were released from
compulsory treatment programs was extremely
low (Gao
2011
)
. Another study that examined
recidivism rates of male drug users in Taiwan
suggested that the recidivism of illicit drug users
in Taiwan after detoxi
ﬁ
cation in the detention
center was substantially high (
Chiang et al.
2009
)
.
Meanwhile, regardless of growing drug-related
prison populations, no Asian prisons have needle
and syringe exchange programs inside the facili-
ties, and India, Indonesia, and Malaysia are the
only countries that provide limited opioid substi-
tution programs to inmates (Harm Reduction
International
2010
)
. In recent years, a change in
antidrug laws from compulsory rehabilitation to
community-oriented programs has been witnessed
in Asian countries. For example, in China, 47,000
drug users were directly admitted to community-
based treatment programs together with 35,000
drug users who were released from compulsory
rehabilitation programs (NNCC
2010
)
.

While incarceration of drug users alone has
seldom led to successful abstention, drug treat-
ment programs have been viewed as a more effec-
tive approach to changing drug users’ behaviors.
However, drug treatment programs are only
provided to limited number of drug users glob-
ally. In 2008, there were only between 12 and
30% of problem drug users worldwide who had
received treatment though the majority of them
felt they needed it (UNODC 2010a). Hong Kong
opened the
ﬁ
rst methadone maintenance treat-
ment (MMT) in Asia and was credited for its
overall quality and wide coverage (Reid et al.

2008
)
. Thailand, Indonesia, China, and Malaysia,
all developed the program one after another. After
China initiated its methadone program in 2003,
more than 500 methadone treatment clinics were
developed in 23 provinces (including autono-
mous regions and municipalities) by the end of
2007; in all, 95,000 drug users were treated (Yao

2008
)
. Several other Southeast Asian countries
are also making efforts to develop meaningful
drug treatment programs. In 2008, Vietnam initi-
ated its pilot methadone treatment program with
1,800 heroin users and plans to develop the pro-
gram across the country (Hung
2010
)
. Cambodia,
which has been criticized for its boot-camp style

24 Forced detoxi
ﬁ
cation and labor are also commonplace
inside these facilities (Harm Reduction International

2010
)
.


124
H. Gao
compulsory drug rehabilitation centers, opened
its
ﬁ
rst methadone clinic for heroin users in 2010
(De Launey
2010
)
. However, there are still no
drug treatment programs available for addicts in
the Wa area of Myanmar—an area with severe
drug traf
ﬁ
cking and abuse problems. Drug addicts
there have to deal with their addiction all on their
own (Chin
2009
)
. While there are other drug-
related programs available for traditional drug
users, such as needle and syringe (NSP) and opi-
oid substitution therapy (OST) programs, only
just over half the countries in Asia have these
programs. In several Asian countries, the current
drug laws of Asia are a major obstacle for the
implementation of these programs. For example,
Malaysia, Thailand, Brunei, Hong Kong, and
Macao do not allow needle–syringe exchange
programs (Reid et al.
2008
)
.

While traditional drug treatment programs in
Asia focus on opiate dependency due to the large
number of opium and heroin users in Asia, the
dramatically increased ATS use population in the
region certainly demands new treatment pro-
grams for ATS users. However, only very limited
treatment services are currently available to them,
including specialized drug treatment services
provided in general hospitals, and psychiatric
facilities (UNODC
2010c
)
.

8.4
Future Trends and Conclusions

The previous sections brie
ﬂ
y reviewed and
discussed illicit drug traf
ﬁ
cking and abuse in
Asia. Although the illicit drug trade is involved in
a complicated chain network, only drug produc-
tion, drug traf
ﬁ
cking, and drug consumption are
essentials. Drug traf
ﬁ
cking connects the drug
supply with drug demand so that the illicit drugs
can reach the end customers—drug users. The
large pro
ﬁ
ts obtained from illicit drug traf
ﬁ
cking
suggest that this illegal business will not vanish
in the near future. What we have learned from
past experience is that it is impossible to com-
pletely remove drug traf
ﬁ
cking businesses from
the underground drug market even by using the
toughest sanction on drug offenses—the death
penalty. As reviewed previously, while most
Asian countries have adopted harsh sentencing
policies against illicit drug traf
ﬁ
cking, it is still a
thriving business in the region. Soon after one
drug traf
ﬁ
cking network is destroyed, a new one
will emerge and replace the previous one because
of the internal drive for pro
ﬁ
ts.

Regarding illicit drug production in Asia, as
previously addressed, the two largest opium
and heroin producer countries, Afghanistan and
Myanmar, are located in Southwest Asia and
Southeast Asia, respectively. While these two
nations have different social, economic, and
cultural traditions, they share one thing in common:
opiate poppy production areas located in poor
areas of these undeveloped countries. According
to the Afghanistan Opium Survey by the United
Nations and
ﬁ
eld research conducted in the
Golden Triangle (Chin
2009
; Kramer et al.
2009
)
,
the main reason farmers cultivate the opiate
poppy is survival. In the case of the Golden
Triangle, farmers in both Myanmar and Laos
have not been provided alternative livelihoods
despite opium bans, which not only cut off the
farmers’
ﬁ
nancial sources from opium cultivation
(UNODC
2010b

)
. Realistically, there is no reason
to believe that opium cultivation will be elimi-
nated from the area if farmers cannot
ﬁ
nd a legiti-
mate way to make a living. Rather, they may
choose to cultivate opiate poppies secretly in
remote sites that may be hard to detect by outsiders
(Chin
2009
)
.

While the primary reason for farmers to culti-
vate opium is to secure family income, the
government’s determination to ban opium may
have a strong impact on its cultivation. In a survey
conducted in 2010 with farmers in Afghanistan,
the farmers (25%) listed the government ban on
opium cultivation as a primary reason for stop-
ping opium cultivation (UNODC
2010b
)
. This

ﬁ
nding suggests that if the central government of
these drug producer countries and the countries
making up the drug traf
ﬁ
cking gateways had a
strong determination to control illicit drug pro-
duction, this determination would produce some
signi
ﬁ
cant impacts on drug production. However,
there are three major obstacles to reach this
goal. As suggested in the
ﬁ
eldwork conducted in
Myanmar, the illicit drug trade—drug money


125
8 Drug Abuse and Drug Traf
ﬁ
cking in Asia
coming from drug lords—has contributed greatly
to the Burmese Government’s
ﬁ
nancial sources.
Therefore, drug control in Myanmar is very much
politicized rather than put into action (Chin

2009
)
. Compared to Afghanistan, the Myanmar
Government is under pressure both from interna-
tional society and its neighboring countries, in
particular the Chinese Government, to control its
drug cultivation. Still, the fact that the central
governments in both Afghanistan and Myanmar
can hardly control their opiate cultivation areas is
another obstacle for implementing any meaning-
ful solutions. Lastly, impoverished economies in
these major producer countries and countries on
the major traf
ﬁ
cking routes make it impossible to
make any radical changes without
ﬁ
nancial
support from the international society. It should
be understood that drug traf
ﬁ
cking is not inde-
pendent from all the other problems that these
drug-producing countries face.

Based on the available information, while
global seizures of ATS have remained at very
high levels in recent years, due to the clandestine
nature of ATS manufacture, it is even more
dif
ﬁ
cult to estimate the scope of the problem and
make corresponding strategies. Based on increasing
demands from the consumer market, more and
more young people favor these synthetic drugs,
providing suf
ﬁ
cient reasons to believe that the
manufacture of ATS will not shrink in the near
future. Meanwhile, the sharp increase in the
heroin price in 2009 due to reduced yield related
to poppy disease also forced some heroin users to
switch to synthetic drugs. With demands from the
consumers’ market and the convenient access to
the two largest ATS precursor countries, Indian
and China, there is no clear indication that the
ATS production and abuse will go down, at least
in the near future.

For certain geographic areas where opium or
heroin use has been a tradition, the in
ﬂ
uences of
traditional drugs will remain. For example,
according to a recent survey conducted in
Afghanistan, more than half of the drug users had
placated their children with opium, and drug
users quite commonly had at least one other
family member who was also a drug user
(UNODC
2009a
)
. With family traditions like
these, the in
ﬂ
uence of traditional drugs on the
next generation is apparent. The most troublesome
issue for drug users, however, is access to drug
treatment programs. The lack of treatment facili-
ties, in particular in poorly developed areas such
as the border of Myanmar, Thailand, and China,
intensi
ﬁ
es demand (Chin
2009
)
. While Central
Asia is one of the few regions in the world where
the HIV epidemic remains clearly on the rise,
strong resistance to OST still widely exists. For
example, such a program was discontinued by
the Uzbek Government in 2009 (Latypov
2010
)
.
In addition, while the demand for special health
care is high among drug users, such facilities are
rare among Asian countries (Reid et al.
2008
)
.

Illicit drug traf
ﬁ
cking and abuse have been
global issues for centuries. Based on a historical
analysis of several countries’ successful experi-
ence (the United States, China, Turkey, and
Thailand), Mccoy
(
2000
) suggests that supply
reduction is the key to success while the role of
the state is critical, in particular, in increasing
state control over illicit drug production regions
and restraining of
ﬁ
cial corruption. Based on the
observation of the Golden Triangle, other schol-
ars agree that while supply reduction is essential,
a successful strategy also needs to include
demand reduction (Chalk
2000
; Chin
2009
)
.
Speci
ﬁ
cally, the implementation of crop-substi-
tution programs in producer countries, a far-
reaching mass movement against illicit drug
abuse, and increased international and intra-
regional
counter-narcotics
cooperation
and
enhanced border control and anticorruption mea-
sures seem more promising (Chalk
2000
; Mccoy

2000
; Walker
2005
)
. Due to increased globaliza-
tion, importantly, any interventions should be
coordinated regionally or internationally, as pro-
posed by the United Nations (UNODC 2009c).

Introduction

Human traf
ﬁ
cking is a form of modern-day slavery.
Traf
ﬁ
ckers often prey on individuals who are
poor, frequently unemployed or under-employed,
and who may lack access to social safety nets,
predominantly women and children in certain
countries. Victims are often lured with false
promises of good jobs and better lives, and then
forced to work under brutal and inhuman condi-
tions. The full dimensions of the problem of
human traf
ﬁ
cking are dif
ﬁ
cult to measure as there
is no database in that particular country. We do
not know, however, that human traf
ﬁ
cking is a
major source of pro
ﬁ
t for organized crime syndi-
cates, along with traf
ﬁ
cking in drugs and guns.
The scope of the problem in the Asian Countries
is serious. Victims are often lured into traf
ﬁ
cking
networks through false promises of good work-
ing conditions and high pay as domestic workers,
factory and farm workers, nannies, waitresses,
sales clerks, or models. Traf
ﬁ
cked victims suffer
extreme physical and mental abuse, including
rape, sexual exploitation, torture, beatings,
starvation, death threats, and threats to family
members. It is believed that most victims who are
traf
ﬁ
cked are isolated and remain undetected by
the public because (1) the strategies used by the
perpetrators isolate victims and prevent them
from coming forward, and (2) the public and the
victim service providers have only recently
become aware of this issue and may not be familiar
with how to recognize or respond to traf
ﬁ
cking
victims. This chapter covers the forms and trends
in traf
ﬁ
cking in Asian Countries, sources and
destination of traf
ﬁ
cking, and preventive and
protective measures adopted in each country.
In Asia, there is a general lack of hard data on
this topic. However, it is possible to glean some
valuable insights from studies on related activi-
ties. These studies can frequently provide an
indication of the scale of traf
ﬁ
cking in the region.
Although not comprehensive in scope or cover-
age, the following estimates do present convincing
evidence of the existence of a growing traf
ﬁ
cking
problem in this part of the world as well. Global
surveys conducted by UNDOC, US Department
of States, and UNDP provide a bird’s eye view of
traf
ﬁ
cking scenario throughout the world. The
UNAIP has compiled the Mekong Region Human
Country Datasheets on human traf
ﬁ
cking for the
Greater Mekong region which includes countries
like China, Cambodia, Vietnam, Laos, Thailand,
and Myanmar. This chapter also mostly relies
upon the data provided by these agencies.

There are a number of de
ﬁ
nitions given by
many international agencies. In this chapter, the

following de
ﬁ
nition of the UN is adopted to
de
ﬁ
ne traf
ﬁ
cking:


“The recruitment, transportation, transfer, harboring
or receipt of persons, by means of the threat or use
of force or other forms of coercion, of abduction,
of fraud, of deception, of the abuse of power or of
a position of vulnerability or of the giving or
receiving of payments or bene
ﬁ
ts to achieve the
consent of a person having control over another or
debt bondage, for the purpose of exploitation which
includes prostitution or for placing of holding such
person, whether for pay or not, in forced labour or
slavery-like practices, in a community other than
the one in which such person lived at the time of
the original act described.”

9.2

Types and Major Forms
of Traf
ﬁ
cking

Human traf
ﬁ
cking is occurring in various forms
for various purposes. Among them traf
ﬁ
cking for
commercial is widespread and most of the
victims are women and children in vulnerable
situations. This apart, traf
ﬁ
cking for forced labor
is more in many of the Asian Countries. Various
forms of traf
ﬁ
cking in Asian countries are given
in Table
9.1
.

9.3

Traf
ﬁ
cking Trends

9.3.1

Cambodia

Cambodian men, women, and children migrate
to Thailand, Malaysia, and other countries for
work, and many are subsequently subjected to
sex traf
ﬁ
cking or forced to labor in the Thai

ﬁ
shing and seafood processing industry, agricul-
tural plantations, factories, domestic servitude,
begging, and street selling. The number of workers
who migrated to Malaysia for employment
through Cambodian recruiting companies has
increased signi
ﬁ
cantly since 2008. In 2010,
licensed Cambodian labor recruitment agen-
cies—members of the Association of Cambodian
Recruiting Agencies—trained and sent 16,395
workers to Malaysia, of which 11,918 were
females trained as domestic workers. The
Cambodian Department of Anti-Traf
ﬁ
cking and
Juvenile Protection data for 2003–2006 suggests
a growing trend in persons arrested; 36 persons
arrested in 2003, rising to 73 in 2005 and 65 in
2006. In terms of victims traf
ﬁ
cked, the same
agency’s data provides a breakdown by gender in
the period 2003–2006. In 2003, the
ﬁ
gure was
674 (all women); in 2004 the
ﬁ
gure was 633
(of these some 54 were male); in 2005, 615
(19 men); and in 2006 the
ﬁ
gure had dropped to
292 (of which 9 were men).

9.3.2

China

International Labor Organization found that
forced prostitution, the entertainment industry,
hairdressing, massage parlors, brick kilns, and
manufacturing and forced begging are the key
sectors of employment for traf
ﬁ
cked victims in

China (

Internet users and young girls are sexually
exploited through this medium.
Table
9.2 reveals
that there has been an increasing trend of women
and children traf
ﬁ
cked and persons convicted
for traf
ﬁ
cking for more than 5 years.


9.3.3

Japan

Many of the traf
ﬁ
cking victims were coerced into
commercial sexual exploitation in strip clubs, sex
shops, hostess bars, private video rooms, escort ser-
vices, and mail-order video services. NGOs reported
that in some cases brokers used drugs to subjugate
victims. Women also voluntarily migrate to work in
Japan but are later coerced into exploitative condi-
tions. They are usually held in debt bondage for
$26,000–$43,000 for their living expenses, medical
care, and other necessities. There are 60,000–70,000
Filipina dancers in Japan (Calvez
1998
)
. Traf
ﬁ
cking
laws exist but are not effectively enforced
(
Ganjanakhundee
1998
). There are more than
150,000 foreign women in prostitution in Japan;
more than half are Filipinos; and 40% are Thai.
(CATW
1998
)
. There were 19 human traf
ﬁ
cking
cases investigated in Japan in 2010, and 28 in 2009.


9.3.4

Lao PDR

Current traf
ﬁ
cking trends in Lao PDR include
domestic traf
ﬁ
cking of women and girls for sex-
ual exploitation in the entertainment sector and
labor exploitation of men and boys on plantations
(see Table
9.3
). The total of
ﬁ
cial number of Lao
victims of traf
ﬁ
cking in 2009 is 128. This includes
both cross-border and domestic traf
ﬁ
cking. In
2009 the Ministry of Labor and Social Welfare
received 155 returnees from Thailand (148 girls
and 7 boys), 144 were children (Lao Department
of Social Welfare,
2009
)
. Also see Fig.
9.1
. Main
Employ
ment Sectors of Traf
ﬁ
cked Persons in
Lao PDR for the domestic traf
ﬁ
cking victims
are mainly found in the entertainment sectors.
Interna
tionally, Lao PDR victims of traf
ﬁ
cking
work in domestic services, the entertainment sec-
tor, agriculture,
ﬁ
sheries, and garment factories.


9.3.5

Myanmar

Reports indicate a trend of traf
ﬁ
cking of women
from Myanmar to China, for forced marriage
with Chinese citizens. Girls and young women
with low incomes are vulnerable to labor or sex-
ual exploitation. Most of the Myanmar victims of
traf
ﬁ
cking typically
ﬁ
nd themselves working in
the sex industry, in labor exploitation such as in
factories or working on plantations,
ﬁ
shing boats,
or in marriages with Chinese men. Some girls are
taken by means of deception, but increasingly
they are informed that they will marry Chinese
men. They are prepared to accept the marriage
arrangement, as they have few options. According
to Myanmar’s Anti-Traf
ﬁ
cking Unit, the total
number of traf
ﬁ
cking cases in 2009 was 155.
Of these, 85 cases involved forced marriage,
19 cases involved forced prostitution, 13 cases

Mekong countries as well as women from distant
countries such as Russia and Uzbekistan that are
vulnerable to being traf
ﬁ
cked into the Thailand
commercial sex industry. Main Employment
Sectors of Traf
ﬁ
cked Persons are migrants who
have been forced, coerced, or defrauded into
forced labor or commercial sexual exploitation.
Traf
ﬁ
cking victims within Thailand typically
work in
ﬁ
shing, seafood processing, low-end
garment production, and domestic work. See
Fig.

cked, 2010.


9.3.7

Vietnam

Vietnam is predominantly a source country for
victims of traf
ﬁ
cking. See Fig.
9.5 for investiga-
tion data 2003–2007. Vietnamese girls are
traf
ﬁ
cked into China, Taiwan, South Korea,
and Singapore via the brokerage of fraudulent
marriages by licensed and unlicensed migrant
labor recruitment agencies. Vietnamese children
are traf
ﬁ
cked for adoption by foreign families
(often Chinese). Vietnam is increasingly a desti-
nation for child sex tourism, with perpetrators
from Japan, the Republic of Korea, China,
Taiwan, the UK, Australia, Europe, and the USA.
Men of Vietnamese minority ethnic groups are
traf
ﬁ
cked into labor exploitation in mines and
brick factories in China. Main Employment
Sectors of Traf
ﬁ
cked Persons are sexual exploi-
tation, domestic labor, mining, construction,

ﬁ
shing, forced begging, selling of
ﬂ
owers and
lottery tickets, and manufacturing
(China,
Ministry of Public Security
2009a
).

9.3.8

India

In India, the National Crime Records Bureau, a
federal organization at the capital, Delhi collects,
compiles and disseminates statistics on crime
nationwide. This statistics is published as “Crime
in India” every year. Crime in India exclusively
publishes a chapter on human traf
ﬁ
cking which
includes the offences registered under Indian
Penal Code (IPC). The publication “Crime in

accordingly Table
9.5 shows the trends of human
traf
ﬁ
cking under various laws from 2005 to
2009.


The number of cases registered under human
traf
ﬁ
cking during the year 2009 is given in
Table
9.5
. While such a situation persists an
applaudable
action research was conducted by
National Human Rights Commission
(

2005
)
.
This is the
ﬁ
rst study on the victims of traf
ﬁ
cking
or survivors conducted in India and a detailed
review on the same is given below.

Some of the important facts given in the
CATW fact book are given below:

India, along with Thailand and the Philippines,
•
has 1.3 million children in its sex-trade
centers. The children come from relatively
poorer areas and are traf
ﬁ
cked to relatively
richer ones (Wadhwa
1998
)
.

In cross-border traf
ﬁ
cking, India is a sending,

receiving, and transit nation. Receiving chil-
dren from Bangladesh and Nepal and sending
women and children to Middle Eastern nations

is a daily occurrence. India and Pakistan are
the main destinations for children under 16
who are traf
ﬁ
cked in south Asia (

).


More than 40% of 484 prostituted girls rescued
•
during major raids of brothels in Mumbai in
1996 were from Nepal (Iijima
1998
).

The brothels of India hold between 100,000
•
and 160,000 Nepalese women and girls, 35%
were taken on the false pretext of marriage
or a good job (
Coomaraswamy
1997
).

9.3.9

Bangladesh

Bangladesh is predominantly a source country
for victims of cross-border traf
ﬁ
cking due to
migration in search of employment. Many border
areas are frequently used as land routes for
traf
ﬁ
cking. There are 111 Indian enclaves in
Bangladesh and 51 enclaves of Bangladesh in
India. Research carried out by the Bangladesh
National Women Lawyers Association (BNWLA)
has shown that these enclaves have been used as
recruitment and collection sites by traf
ﬁ
ckers
(Gazi et al.
2001
)
. See Table
9.6
.


9.3.10
Nepal

Nepal is primarily considered a country of
origin—a source for the traf
ﬁ
cking of men,
women, and children. The girls end up in brothels
in India or Pakistan or in Middle Eastern or
South Asian countries (Times of India
2003
)
.
Within Nepal, there has been some attention on
the foreign child sex tourism trade within the
country. Nepal also has a system of bonded
labor where entire families may be bonded and
forced to work in a range of occupations. This is
especially so among lower castes and socially
marginalized groups, who are particularly vulner-
able to dominance and exploitation. Overall
Government efforts for 2006 are summarized in

Sri Lanka

Sri Lanka is primarily a source country with men,
women, and children being traf
ﬁ
cked primarily
for labor and also for commercial sexual exploi-
tation, including domestic child sex tourism.
There may also be a small but signi
ﬁ
cant
traf
ﬁ
cking of women into Sri Lanka from coun-
tries such as Thailand, China, and the members
of the former USSR for commercial sexual
exploitation. There are also recent concerns about
traf
ﬁ
cking for employment to the Middle East as
well as Singapore among other countries. Men
and women are offered jobs as domestic workers,
construction labor or in other factories like
garments. Trends are given in
Table

Pakistan

Pakistan is a source, transit, and destination coun-
try for men, women, and children subjected to
traf
ﬁ
cking in persons, speci
ﬁ
cally forced labor
and prostitution. The largest human traf
ﬁ
cking
problem is bonded labor, concentrated in the
Sindh and Punjab provinces in agriculture and
brick making, and to a lesser extent in mining and
carpet-making. The number of convictions under

9 Human Traf
ﬁ
cking in Asia
Victims Protection Report (TVPA) of 2000
(reauthorized in 2003 and then in 2005). Tier I
countries are deemed to be in full compliance.
Tier II countries are not in compliance but are
making signi
ﬁ
cant efforts to become so. Tier III
countries are not compliant and are not making
signi
ﬁ
cant efforts toward that end. Most of the
Asian countries are assigned Tier 2 status as they
do not fully comply with the minimum standards
for the elimination of traf
ﬁ
cking, however, are
making signi
ﬁ
cant efforts to do so, despite limited
resources. Four countries—China, Thailand,
Vietnam, and Bangladesh—were put on the Tier II
Watch List due to its failure to provide evidence
of increasing efforts to combat traf
ﬁ
cking,
particularly its failure to convict traf
ﬁ
ckers and
public of
ﬁ
cials involved in traf
ﬁ
cking. In terms
of organizational infrastructure and efforts at
prosecution and prevention, the following is a
concise summary by Asian country.

9.6

Prosecution

9.6.1

Cambodia

Cambodia has a specialized Anti-Human
Traf
ﬁ
cking Department and Juvenile Protection
Police Department. Of
ﬁ
cers from these depart-
ments, in cooperation with prosecutors, carry out
investigations, apprehensions, arrests, prosecu-
tions, and convictions. Cambodia has a focused
campaign dedicated to combating human
traf
ﬁ
cking. Also there is a cadre of specialist
judges and prosecutors with strong understanding
of the issues and sensitivities concerning human
traf
ﬁ
cking cases in Cambodia (CMS
2009
)
.

9.6.2

China

Both local and central governments provide fund-
ing for anti-traf
ﬁ
cking activities in China. In
2009, a large, nation-wide campaign was
launched by Ministry of Public Security to com-
bat different forms of traf
ﬁ
cking. The campaign
has initiated a number of good practices in
suppressing traf
ﬁ
cking crimes and rescuing
victims, including setting up DNA database, joint
action of multifunction police, and immediate
response mechanism. Campaigns of combating
forced prostitution, illegal employment, and rescue
of street children and child beggars are launched
effectively.

9.6.3

Japan

Japan does not have comprehensive anti-
traf
ﬁ
cking laws, and does not keep statistics on
the number of traf
ﬁ
cking cases. The government
reported prosecuting and convicting
ﬁ
ve individ-
uals in 2009 under Penal Code (Article 226).
Cooperation between the different bureaucracies
that handle traf
ﬁ
cking cases is not always condu-
cive to establishing a clear statistical record that
includes prosecutions, convictions, and sentenc-
ing. Japan’s 2005 amendment to its criminal
code, which prohibits the buying and selling of
persons, and a variety of other criminal code arti-
cles and laws, including the Labor Standards
Law, and the Law for Punishing Acts Related to
Child Prostitution and Child Pornography crimi-
nalizes traf
ﬁ
cking and a wide range of related
activities. However, it is unclear if the existing
legal framework is suf
ﬁ
ciently comprehensive to
criminalize all severe forms of traf
ﬁ
cking in
persons. The 2005 Criminal Code amendment,
prohibiting the buying and selling of persons,
prescribes penalties of up to 7 years’ imprison-
ment, which is suf
ﬁ
ciently stringent.

9.6.4

Laos

The specialist unit for law enforcement/prosecu-
tion in Lao PDR is the Anti-Traf
ﬁ
cking Division
(ATD). The ATD and the Department of
Investigation are responsible for collecting
evidence for traf
ﬁ
cking cases and submitting it to
the Prosecutor’s Of
ﬁ
ce for trial in the Supreme
Court. In cooperation with international agen-
cies, the Government of Lao PDR has been
working to strengthen the legal sector in order
to bring more traf
ﬁ
cking offenders to justice
(DSW
2009
)
.

R. Thilagaraj and S. Latha

9.6.5

Myanmar

The specialist units for prosecution in Myanmar
are the Anti-Traf
ﬁ
cking Unit (at the central level)
and the Anti-Traf
ﬁ
cking Taskforce (at the
provincial level, located in 22 townships). The
human resources for prosecution include members
of the Myanmar Police Force, prosecutors, and
judges. Special courts dedicated to hearing
traf
ﬁ
cking cases are established in 2010 (MHA

2010
)
.

9.6.6

Thailand

The Anti-Human Traf
ﬁ
cking Division (AHTD)
focus solely on human traf
ﬁ
cking, including male
victims of traf
ﬁ
cking. The Of
ﬁ
ce of the Attorney
General also has a Centre against International
Human Traf
ﬁ
cking (CAHT), which is responsible
for prosecuting traf
ﬁ
cking cases. The Department
of Special Investigations (DSI) under the Ministry
of Justice (MOJ) is involved in investigating
human traf
ﬁ
cking cases that are deemed to be
“special cases.” Thailand has an Anti-Traf
ﬁ
cking
in Persons Fund which may be used for the pros-
ecution of cases related to cross-border human
traf
ﬁ
cking.

9.6.7

Vietnam

The departments/ministries that work coopera-
tively to prosecute traf
ﬁ
cking cases include the
following: The Investigation units at all levels of
the Ministry of Public Security; The Border
Guard Command; The Ministry of Justice, and
The Supreme People are Court and the Supreme
People’s Prosecutorial Of
ﬁ
ce. An Assessment of
the Legal System in Vietnam in comparison with
the UN Protocol to Prevent, Suppress and Punish
Traf
ﬁ
cking in Persons, especially Women and
Children; and the UN Protocol against the
Smuggling of Migrants by Land, Sea and Air, is
completed by the Ministry of Justice in coopera-
tion with the UNICEF and the UNODC. (China,
Ministry of Public Security
2009b
)

9.6.8

Bangladesh

The Government of Bangladesh showed progress
in convicting sex traf
ﬁ
ckers of females, but not
traf
ﬁ
ckers of men, during the reporting period;
however, the government drafted an anti-
traf
ﬁ
cking law that includes criminal prohibitions
for all forms of traf
ﬁ
cking, with stringent sent-
ences, and submitted the proposed law into the
parliamentary process in December 2010. During
the reporting period, the government obtained the
convictions of 42 sex traf
ﬁ
cking offenders and
sentenced 24 of them to life imprisonment under
Sections 5 and 30 of the Repression of Women
and Children Act; 18 were sentenced to lesser
prison terms. This is an increase from the 32
convictions obtained in 2009, with 24 offenders
sentenced to life imprisonment. The government
prosecuted
80
cases
involving
suspected
traf
ﬁ
cking offenders and conducted 101 investi-
gations, compared with 68 prosecutions and 26
investigations during the previous year. Fifty-
three prosecutions resulted in acquittals; how-
ever, under Bangladeshi law the term “acquittal”
also can refer to cases in which the parties settled
out of court or witnesses did not appear in court.
Most sex traf
ﬁ
cking cases are prosecuted by 42
special courts for the prosecution of crimes of
violence against women and children spread
throughout 32 districts of the country; those
courts are generally more ef
ﬁ
cient than regular
trial courts. The Ministry of Home Affairs’ Anti-
Traf
ﬁ
cking Monitoring Cell continued to collect
data on traf
ﬁ
cking arrests, prosecutions, and
rescues. The Government of Bangladesh did not
provide data on investigations, prosecutions,
convictions, and sentencing of public employees
complicit in human traf
ﬁ
cking. The country’s
National Police Academy continued to provide
anti-traf
ﬁ
cking training to police of
ﬁ
cers who
went through entrance training.

9.6.9

India

The government made progress in law enforce-
ment efforts to combat human traf
ﬁ
cking. India


139
9 Human Traf
ﬁ
cking in Asia
prohibits and punishes most, but not all, forms of
human traf
ﬁ
cking under a number of laws. The
government prohibits bonded and forced labor
through the BLSA, the Child Labor (Prohibition
and Regulation) Act (CLA), and the Juvenile
Justice Act. Moreover, these prison sentences
were rarely imposed on offenders. India also
prohibits forms of sex traf
ﬁ
cking through the
Immoral Traf
ﬁ
cking Prevention Act (ITPA).
Prescribed penalties under the ITPA, ranging
from 7 years’ to life imprisonment, are suf
ﬁ
ciently
stringent and commensurate with those pre-
scribed for other serious crimes, such as rape.
The ITPA also criminalizes other offenses. ITPA
crimes, however, are frequently tried under
magistrate courts, which limit sentences to
3 years, whereas rape cases are generally tried
under Sessions courts which permit the maximum
sentences according to the law. Indian authorities
also used Sections 366(A) and 372 of the IPC,
which prohibit kidnapping and selling children
into prostitution, respectively, to arrest and pros-
ecute suspected sex traf
ﬁ
ckers. Penalties pre-
scribed under these provisions are a maximum of
10 years’ imprisonment and a
ﬁ
ne. A court in the
State of Tamil Nadu in July 2010 issued a land-
mark conviction of 5 years’ imprisonment and a

ﬁ
ne to three bonded labor perpetrators. The
Government of India’s “Comprehensive Scheme
for Strengthening Law Enforcement Response in
India” earmarked $12 million over 3 years to
implement the nationwide anti-traf
ﬁ
cking effort.

9.6.10
Nepal

Nepal prohibits most forms of traf
ﬁ
cking in
persons, including the selling of human beings
and forced prostitution, through its HTTCA,
2008. Prescribed penalties range from 10 to
20 years’ imprisonment, which are suf
ﬁ
ciently
stringent and commensurate with those pre-
scribed for other serious crimes, such as rape.
According to the Of
ﬁ
ce of Attorney General, 174
offenders were convicted in 119 cases tried in
court under the HTTCA; 71 cases resulted in
convictions and 47 cases resulted in acquittals
in Nepal’s 2009–2010
ﬁ
scal year. This compares
with 172 offenders convicted in 138 cases tried
in court, with 82 cases resulting in convictions
and 56 case acquittals, in the previous
ﬁ
scal year.
The much lower number of convictions reported
in the 2010 Report represented only convictions
obtained from the Supreme Court, while the
numbers offered above represent convictions
obtained from district courts. Some Foreign
Employment Tribunal case convictions under the
Foreign Employment Act may have involved
human traf
ﬁ
cking. In 2010; the government
established a special unit to investigate human
traf
ﬁ
cking within the Central Crime Investigative
Bureau. There were no traf
ﬁ
cking related investi-
gations, prosecutions, or convictions of govern-
ment of
ﬁ
cials for complicity in traf
ﬁ
cking
during the reporting period. Between January
and March 2010, according to of
ﬁ
cial statistics,
the Maoists discharged the 2,973 child soldiers
they recruited during the 10-year con
ﬂ
ict, some
of whom may have been traf
ﬁ
cking victims.

9.6.11
Sri Lanka

The Sri Lankan government increased law
enforcement efforts in addressing human
traf
ﬁ
cking cases. Sri Lanka prohibits all forms of
traf
ﬁ
cking through an April 2006 amendment
to its penal code, which prescribes punishments
of up to 20 years’ imprisonment. Amendments
passed in 2009 to the Foreign Employment Act
expanded the powers of the Sri Lanka Bureau of
Foreign Employment (SLBFE) to prosecute
recruitment agents who engage in fraudulent
recruitment, prescribing a maximum penalty of
4 years’ imprisonment and
ﬁ
nes of $1,000, and
restricting the amount that employment agent can
charge. In March 2011, three traf
ﬁ
ckers were
convicted and sentenced to 9 years each for
forcing women into prostitution, in one case.
This is the
ﬁ
rst recorded convicted case under Sri
Lanka’s counter-traf
ﬁ
cking amendment. The
Attorney General’s Department claimed two
additional convictions in 2010 for violations of
the penal code’s statute on child sexual exploitation;
both convictions may have involved human
traf
ﬁ
cking crimes. Both convictions resulted in


140
R. Thilagaraj and S. Latha
suspended jail sentences. Each traf
ﬁ
cker had to
pay a
ﬁ
ne of approximately $900, and one
had to pay compensation of $450 to the victim.
In January 2011, the National Child Protection
Authority (NCPA) completed an investigation
and could not determine the whereabouts of the
remaining boys allegedly in armed service with
the Tamil Makkal Viduthalai Pulikal (TMVP)/
Karuna Faction; some of these boys may be
traf
ﬁ
cking victims. The Sri Lankan Police con-
tinued to teach a counter-traf
ﬁ
cking module to
all police recruits during their basic trainings

9.6.12
Pakistan

The Government of Pakistan made progress in
law enforcement efforts to combat human
traf
ﬁ
cking in 2009. While the lack of comprehen-
sive internal anti-traf
ﬁ
cking laws hindered law
enforcement efforts, a number of other laws were
used to address some of these crimes. Several
sections in the Pakistan Penal Code, as well as
provincial laws, criminalize forms of human
traf
ﬁ
cking such as slavery, selling a child for
prostitution, and unlawful compulsory labor, with
prescribed offenses ranging from
ﬁ
nes to life
imprisonment. Pakistan prohibits all forms of
transnational traf
ﬁ
cking in persons with the
Prevention and Control of Human Traf
ﬁ
cking
Ordinance (PACHTO); the penalties range from
7 to 14 years’ imprisonment

9.7

Protection and Prevention

9.7.1

Cambodia

Screening and identi
ﬁ
cation of victims of
traf
ﬁ
cking in Cambodia is undertaken with refer-
ence to the Law on
Suppression of Human
Traf
ﬁ
cking and Sexual Exploitation (
2010
).
Some organizations, such as the IOM and Legal
Support for Children and Women (LSCW), use
their own tools to identify victims. State-run
shelters for victims of traf
ﬁ
cking in Cambodia
operate based on the Agreement on Guidelines
for Practices and Cooperation between the
Relevant Government Institutions and Victim
Support Agencies in Cases of Human Traf
ﬁ
cking,
2007 and minimum standards for protection of
the rights of victims of human traf
ﬁ
cking.
Privately run shelters use their own operational
procedures, for example, those shelters run by
World Vision Cambodia. Post-harm assistance is
provided to victims of traf
ﬁ
cking in Cambodia,
including rescue, repatriation, reception in home
country, family tracing, family assessment, rein-
tegration,
short/medium/long-term
shelter
accommodation, medical, legal, psychosocial,
education and vocational education assistance,
and case follow-up. There are many government
and non-government victim assistance agencies
in Cambodia which provide shelter and other
forms of post-harm assistance.

Cambodia has bilateral agreements on recruit-
ment in place with Thailand, Malaysia, South
Korea, and Japan. Several national training pro-
grams are conducted for frontline anti-traf
ﬁ
cking
of
ﬁ
cers in various provinces. Awareness-raising
and educational campaigns on human traf
ﬁ
cking
and safe migration are conducted by a host of
government and non-government agencies A child-
safe tourism campaign to prevent traf
ﬁ
cking in
the tourism industry focused on the urban areas
of Cambodia, including Phnom Penh, Siem Reap,
and Sihanoukville.

China

In China, only women and children can be legally
recognized as traf
ﬁ
cking victims. Victims are
generally found through police raids or via infor-
mation provided by members of the public or
shelter staff, though there are some victims who
self-report to police. Victim identiﬁ
cation is
carried out by police ofﬁ
cers according to the
Articles 240 and 241 of the Criminal Law of the
People’s Republic of China. With the support of
other ministries and NGOs, the Ministry of Public
Security (MPS) and Ministry of Civil Affairs
(MCA) provide temporary relief and return and
reintegration assistance to victims of traf
ﬁ
cking.
China has a total of 1,372 administration and
relief shelters and over 200 Child Protection


141
9 Human Traf
ﬁ
cking in Asia
Centers located in cities across the country,
which provide temporary support to traf
ﬁ
cking
victims. In 2009, shelters across the country have
provided relief services to over 12,000 traf
ﬁ
cked
women and children, some referred by police
while others were self-reported. Responsibility
for repatriation is shared between the Chinese
Police and shelter staff, sometimes with the assis-
tance of non-government partners such as Save
the Children. Statistics on the number of victims
repatriated from China are not widely available.
One media report suggests that in 2009, 272 victims
were repatriated from China to Myanmar.

Throughout 2008 and 2009, bilateral meetings
between Lao PDR and China, and Lao PDR and
Vietnam were held with the aim of estab
ishing
similar agreements. These include the Memo-
randum of Understanding between Lao PDR and
Thailand on Cooperation to Combat Traf
ﬁ
cking
in Persons, Especially Women and Children
(2005), and the Thai–Lao Cross Border
Collaboration on Tracing Missing Traf
ﬁ
cked
Victims in Thailand (2008–2011). The Lao
Government is also developing a National
Training Manual on human traf
ﬁ
cking to
strengthen the capacity of front-line of
ﬁ
cers to
undertake counter-traf
ﬁ
cking activities and
promoting counter traf
ﬁ
cking initiatives, led by
the Ministry of Public Security.

9.7.3

Japan

The number of traf
ﬁ
cking victims identi
ﬁ
ed
overall by the Japanese government declined for
the fourth consecutive year. Police authorities
identi
ﬁ
ed only 17 victims in 2009, down from 36
victims in 2008, 43 in 2007, 58 in 2006, and 116
in 2005. Government efforts to protect Japanese
child sex traf
ﬁ
cking victims reportedly improved,
but the government did not report the number of
such victims identi
ﬁ
ed. Although the government
claims the availability of a long-term residency
visa for traf
ﬁ
cking victims, no foreign victims
have ever been granted such a visa. In 2009,
Japan decreased its funding to the IOM from
$300,000 to less than $190,000 for repatriation
and reintegration assistance, which has had a
detrimental effect on victim assistance efforts in
the country, resulting in foreign victims unable to
return home and victims unable to obtain reinte-
gration assistance.

The Japanese government made limited efforts
to prevent traf
ﬁ
cking in persons with assistance
from international organizations and NGOs. The
government continued distribution of posters
and handouts to raise awareness about traf
ﬁ
cking.
Authorities also continued law enforcement
training at the National Police University and
with IOM assistance. In July 2009, the govern-
ment established a temporary working group,
which included NGOs, to develop a new National
Action Plan to combat traf
ﬁ
cking, which was
released in December 2009, though the new
action plan does not include NGO partnerships.
Japan is not a party to the 2000 UN TIP Protocol.

9.7.4

Lao PDR

Lao PDR has a working group led by the Anti-
Traf
ﬁ
cking Division, the counseling center of the
Lao Women’s Union, the Department of Social
Welfare, and the Prosecutor’s Of
ﬁ
ce dedicated to
victim identi
ﬁ
cation. In 2009, the Ministry of
Labor and Social Welfare has started two new
support shelters for vulnerable populations
including victims of traf
ﬁ
cking. One shelter
located in Savannakhet is supported by Acting
for Women in Distressing Situations (AFESIP),
and the other shelter in Champasak province is
under the supervision of the Ministry of Education
and is supported by Village Focus International.
There are now
ﬁ
ve shelters in Lao PDR which
provides support to vulnerable populations
including victims of traf
ﬁ
cking. This support
includes medical assistance, legal assistance and
consultation, and vocational training. The organi-
zations which assist in repatriation are Laos
Women’s
Union,
IOM,
AFESIP,
Friends
International, Village Focus International, and
World Vision. Child safe tourism campaign, run
by the Lao National Tourism Administration dur-
ing the 2009 Southeast Asian Games (SEA) and
National radio campaign, run by Lao National
Radio, were organized to raise awareness about
human traf
ﬁ
cking, safe migration, and child
rights.

Myanmar

There are temporary shelters for victims of
traf
ﬁ
cking gives certain vulnerable areas in
Myanmar where the rescued victims are kept for
3 days and then transferred to shelters for 2 weeks.
These shelters provide counseling and guidance.
They are also given vocational training, and they
are reintegrated into their families.

In 2009, awareness-raising efforts were con-
ducted both within Myanmar and abroad by the
Central Body for Suppression of Traf
ﬁ
cking
in Persons and other governmental and non-
governmental agencies. These include the
introduction of traf
ﬁ
cking awareness into the
curriculum of some schools and two traf
ﬁ
cking
workshops involving 115 employment agencies.

9.7.6

Thailand

Standard operating procedures have been devel-
oped for the return and reintegration of victims.
They are offered medical, legal, psychosocial,
recreational and educational services, as well as
livelihood training. The Ministry of Social
Development and Human Security also plays an
active role in victim identi
ﬁ
cation. In 2009, 513
persons were discharged from shelters housing
traf
ﬁ
cking and other vulnerable victims. The
Royal Thai Government through various organi-
zations has launched several campaigns through
radio, television, print, and electronic media to
raise public awareness and their cooperation in
the
ﬁ
ght against human traf
ﬁ
cking.

9.7.7

Vietnam

In Vietnam, Ministry of Labour and Women’s
Union established centers for victims of
traf
ﬁ
cking, and these shelter programs provide
psychological support for returned victims from
the time of their arrival at the shelter up until rein-
tegration into their communities. They will
engage in vocational training of their choosing or
attend school and receive psychological support.
Vietnam’s Immigration Department is the lead
agency, and works in cooperation with relevant
agencies including the IOM, Oxfam, AAT-
AFESIP Vietnam and immigration units from
provincial police departments, to identify and
receive victims from abroad. The Border Guard
Command is the primary agency for identifying
and receiving self-returned victims or rescued
victims via land borders.

The Vietnam Government is creating aware-
ness programs about human traf
ﬁ
cking to the
public at a large scale through various media.
They have also identi
ﬁ
ed the vulnerable areas
and imparted vocational programs and pro-
vided employment opportunities. Working with
various Ministries and Departments within the
Government of Vietnam, the Vietnam Women’s
Union published brochures and books on anti-
traf
ﬁ
cking, for distribution across the country
and coordinated public broadcasts.


9.7.8

Bangladesh

The Government of Bangladesh made some
efforts to protect victims of traf
ﬁ
cking over the
past few years. Bangladesh’s courts and police
refer some victims of traf
ﬁ
cking to NGO shel-
ters; other times, those victims were either
self-identi
ﬁ
ed or identi
ﬁ
ed by an NGO. One
hundred thirty-seven victims (83 adult women,
0 adult men, and 54 children) were self-
identi
ﬁ
ed or identi
ﬁ
ed and rescued by law
enforcement of
ﬁ
cials or NGOs. There are nine
homes for victims of traf
ﬁ
cking attached with
these centers, in cooperation with NGOs, pro-
viding legal, medical, and psychiatric services.
Law enforcement personnel encourage victims
of traf
ﬁ
cking, when identi
ﬁ
ed, to participate
in investigations and prosecutions of their
traf
ﬁ
ckers by providing transportation to
courts. At least 36 Bangladeshi sex traf
ﬁ
cking
victims were repatriated to Bangladesh from
India from 2010 to 2011, although repatriation
remained a challenge for other victims.
Bangladesh established a traf
ﬁ
cking task force
with India.

9.7.9

India

The Government of India has taken initiatives to
prevent human traf
ﬁ
cking particularly among
women and children through number of measures.
Signi
ﬁ
cant among them are Watch Dog
Committees at village level, homes for rescued
women for rehabilitation, toll-free help lines for
women and children and many other homes. The
Village Level Watch Dog Committees are formed
in each village. The Committee monitor group
movement of children in and out of villages, Watch
out for brokers, keep a watch on the extremely
poor families and mainstream children—see at
least such children come to the school.

A number of homes are run by the States with
the
ﬁ
nancial assistance given by the Ministry of
Women and Children, Department of Social
Defence, and Ministry of Social Justice and
Empowerment. The homes are viz., short stay
homes, swadhar homes, ujjwala homes, and rescue
homes. The States also have counseling centers
for women and girls who are in moral danger or
abandoned by their families. Ministry of Women
and Child Development (MWCD) funded 331
Swadhar projects—which helps female victims
of violence, including sex traf
ﬁ
cking—and 134
projects and 73 rehabilitation centers in 16 states
under the Ujjawala program—which seeks to
protect
and
rehabilitate
female
traf
ﬁ
cking
victims—and 238 women’s help lines. This is an
increase from the previous year. Foreign victims
can access these shelters. Some traf
ﬁ
cking
victims were penalized for acts committed as a
result of being traf
ﬁ
cked. NGOs asserted that
some parts of Andhra Pradesh, Maharashtra,
Goa, Bihar, Delhi, Tamil Nadu, and West Bengal
continued to make progress in not criminalizing
sex traf
ﬁ
cking victims. Reports indicated that
some foreign victims continued to be charged
and detained under the Foreigners’ Act for
undocumented status. The Government of India
successfully
repatriated
seven
Bangladeshi
traf
ﬁ
cking victims from Chennai in 2010 with
the assistance of NGOs, and repatriated 29
Bangladeshi victims from Maharashtra in 2010–
2011, although repatriation remained a challenge
for other victims. India established a traf
ﬁ
cking
task force with Bangladesh which held three
meetings.

Rescue Homes are also run by many States.
Women who are rescued by the Police and those
facing trial in the Court of law are given shelter
during the trial period. They are provided with
free shelter, food, clothing, medical care, and also
vocational training.

India made uneven progress in its efforts to
protect victims of human traf
ﬁ
cking. Indian law
enforcement and immigration of
ﬁ
cials continued
to lack formal procedures for proactively identi-
fying victims of traf
ﬁ
cking among vulnerable
populations, such as children at work sites,
females in prostitution, or members from the
disadvantaged social economic strata in rural
industries. NGOs reported hundreds of more
rescues and release certi
ﬁ
cates and issued particu-
larly in Tamil Nadu, Andhra Pradesh, Karnataka,
Uttar Pradesh, and Bihar.

9.7.10
Nepal

The Government of Nepal does not have a formal
system of proactively identifying victims of
traf
ﬁ
cking among high-risk persons with whom
they come in contact. During the last year, the
Ministry of Women, Children and Social Welfare
(MWCSW) ful
ﬁ
lled a commitment reported in
the 2010 TIP Report to open and partially fund

ﬁ
ve NGO-run shelter homes for female victims
of traf
ﬁ
cking, domestic violence, and sexual
assault; a total of eight NGO shelters are now
given some funding by the government. As of
February 2011, 77 victims were in those shelters.
During the year, the government of Nepal ful
ﬁ
lled
a second commitment to open 15 emergency
shelters across the country for victims of
traf
ﬁ
cking and other forms of abuse. All facilities
that assist traf
ﬁ
cking victims were run by NGOs
and most provided a range of services, including
legal aid, medical services, psychosocial coun-
seling, and economic rehabilitation. The Nepal
Police Women’s Cells reportedly sustained
partnerships with NGOs to ensure that victims
were provided with available shelter; however,
it is unknown how many survivors received


144
R. Thilagaraj and S. Latha
assistance. The government did not encourage
traf
ﬁ
cking victims to participate in investigations
against their traf
ﬁ
ckers. Judges reportedly often
took an adversarial, rather than impartial, stance
when dealing with traf
ﬁ
cking victims.

9.7.11
Sri Lanka

The government made limited progress in pro-
tecting victims of traf
ﬁ
cking during the year. The
government forces foreign traf
ﬁ
cking victims to
remain in Sri Lanka if they are witnesses in a case
until evidence has been given. The Sri Lanka
Bureau of Foreign Employment (SLBFE) operat-
ing nine short-term shelters in 2010 in Jordan,
Kuwait, Libya, Oman, Saudi Arabia, and the
United Arab Emirates as well as an overnight
shelter in Sri Lanka’s international airport for
returning female migrant workers who encoun-
tered abuse abroad. The Ministry of Child
Development and Women’s Affairs (MOCDWA)
has a memorandum of understanding with IOM
to establish a shelter which can house 10–15
women and child victims of traf
ﬁ
cking and abuse.
Government personnel did not employ formal
procedures for proactively identifying victims.
The Commissioner General for Rehabilitation,
with the assistance of the NCPA, continued to
operate two rehabilitation centers speci
ﬁ
cally for
children involved in armed con
ﬂ
ict, some of
whom may be traf
ﬁ
cking victims, in partnership
with UNICEF. The government did not encour-
age victims to assist in the investigation and pros-
ecution of traf
ﬁ
cking cases; instead, they
sometimes forced victims to testify if they chose
to
ﬁ
le charges. In addition, prosecutors were
prevented under Sri Lankan law from meeting
with witnesses outside of formal court proceed-
ings. Thus, they had to rely on police to convince
a witness to testify.

9.7.12
Pakistan

The Government of Pakistan made some prog-
ress in its efforts to protect victims of human
traf
ﬁ
cking. The government continued to lack
adequate procedures and resources for proactively
identifying victims of traf
ﬁ
cking among vulner-
able persons with whom they come in contact,
especially child laborers, women, and children in
prostitution, and agricultural and brick kiln
workers. The expanded protection services over-
seas and provided medical and psychological
services to Pakistani traf
ﬁ
cking victims in Oman.
Some NGOs and government shelters, like the
Punjab Child Protection and Welfare Bureau,
rehabilitated and reunited children with their
families. Female traf
ﬁ
cking victims could access
26 government-run Shaheed Benazir Bhutto
Centers and the numerous provincial government
“Darul Aman” centers offering medical treat-
ment, vocational training, and legal assistance.
In September 2009, the government opened a
rehabilitation center in Swat, which included a
team of doctors and psychiatrists, to assist child
soldiers rescued from militants.

The government encouraged foreign victims
to participate in investigations against their
traf
ﬁ
ckers by giving them the option of early
statement recording and repatriation or, if their
presence was required for the trial, by permitting
them to seek employment. Foreign victims report-
edly were not prosecuted or deported for unlaw-
ful acts committed as a direct result of being
traf
ﬁ
cked. The Punjab Child Protection and
Welfare Bureau continued to fund 20 community
organizations aimed at preventing child labor
traf
ﬁ
cking. The federal and provincial govern-
ments developed and began implementation of
the Child Protection Management Information
System, a national monitoring system that collects
district-level data in
ﬁ
ve thematic areas, including
child traf
ﬁ
cking.

9.8

Conclusion

Traf
ﬁ
cking is one of the worst and most brazen
abuse of human rights violations. The continuum
of violence against poor women and children for
commercial sex and forced labor in inhuman
conditions are the manifestations of embedded
discriminations based on gender, class, caste,
ethnicity and socioeconomic position. A review


145
9 Human Traf
ﬁ
cking in Asia
of this chapter on human traf
ﬁ
cking situation in
various Asian countries reveals that only a tip of
the iceberg of the problem has been addressed
and a lot more has to be researched. Asian coun-
tries with a culture of strong values based on
human rights and fundamental freedom should
come together to
ﬁ
ght against traf
ﬁ
cking and
take it as a serious social issue to be addressed.
There should be a collective
ﬁ
ght against this
modern day slavery by all the stake holders in
these countries of Asian Region through an
effective partnership of governmental and non-
governmental organizations.

10.1
Introduction

On November 26, 2008, ten Pakistani militants
traveled in a
ﬁ
shing boat from Karachi, Pakistan
southward toward Mumbai, India. Once near
Mumbai, they transferred to an in
ﬂ
atable dingy
with an outboard motor. Upon reaching shore, they
divided up into small teams, each with a speci
ﬁ
c
objective in mind. The
ﬁ
rst team headed toward
the Chhatrapati train station, which was nominally
guarded by the Railway Protection Force (RPF)
that soon found itself outgunned. The terrorists
roamed throughout the station, shooting innocent
civilians indiscriminately. Eventually, armed
police units would arrive, putting pressure on the
team, which then dispersed toward the Cama and
Albless Hospital, where they were able to kill
more people (BBC News Timeline
2008
)
.

Meanwhile the second team dashed off to
Nariman House, a commercial–residential com-
plex administered by the Jewish Chabad Lubavitch
movement. The team moved into the building,
took 13 people as hostage (
ﬁ
ve of whom would
later be killed). At one point, Indian security

services intercepted a call between one of the

terrorists and one of his handlers: “Brother, you
have to
ﬁ
ght. This is a matter of prestige of Islam,”
the voice urged, “You have to
ﬁ
ght for the victory
of Islam” (India Ministry of Foreign Affairs
2008
)
.
The terrorists then prepared for a police assault,
which eventually came, resulting in their deaths.

The third team traveled to the landing site of
the Oberoi-Trident Hotel, where they shot people
indiscriminately. At one point in their assault,
they called local media outlets and demanded
that the Indian government release all Mujahiddin

ﬁ
ghters being held in Indian prisons. As with the
second team, members of this team were in tele-
phonic contact with their handlers; one handler
instructed a militant to concentrate on shooting
the foreign hostages (including a Singaporean
national) and to avoid hitting Muslims who might
have been staying at the hotel.

Finally, the fourth team headed directly to the
Leopold Café. Upon entering the restaurant, two
attackers (Abu Shoaib and Abu Umer) began
shooting patrons indiscriminately; eventually
eight would be killed (Agence France Presse

2009
)
. They then headed to the Taj Mahal Palace
and Tower Hotel. They meandered through the
hotel, shooting people and throwing grenades as
the opportunities presented themselves. At one
stage, an attacker was ordered by his Pakistani-
based handler to set
ﬁ
re to the hotel. After 60 h of
terrorist violence, Indian security forces were

ﬁ
nally able to subdue the attackers (Richman

2010
)
. However, the terrorists managed to kill at
least 195 people during a 3-day period.

Challenge Sustained by Ideological,
Physical, and Criminal Enablers

P.J. Smith

In subsequent months and years, India and
other governments conducted numerous investi-
gations into the background of the Mumbai
attack. One major break occurred when a
Pakistani-American named David Headley was
captured at the Chicago airport. Of
ﬁ
cials would
later determine that Headley had conducted sur-
veillance missions for the LeT (and by some
press accounts, its patron, the Pakistan Inter-
Services Intelligence (ISI) directorate). Headley
would later tell the US and Indian investigators
that the LeT had trained him in various camps in
the early 2000s and that, as of 2006, he began
working directly for Sajid Majid, a high-ranking
operations commander within LeT. He was
trained in both surveillance and counter-surveil-
lance techniques, which allowed him to stay
undetected in India while gathering information
on future targets (Burke
2011
)
.

Overall, the Mumbai attack indicated LeT’s
desire to expand its jihadi agenda beyond Kashmir
and into India and beyond, particularly with its
decision to include Jewish and Western targets
(Tankel
2011
)
. Second, the attack reinforced the
importance of the
ﬁ
rearms assault as a supplement
to the classic explosives methodology commonly
associated with contemporary terrorism. As a
recent RAND study noted: “[The]
ﬁ
rearms assault,
while not as deadly as mass-casualty bombings,
can be an effective tactic in creating prolonged
chaos in an urban setting” (Rebasa and Blackwill

2009
)
. Third and perhaps most signi
ﬁ
cant, the
Mumbai attack was an indicator that the global
center of gravity for terrorism had shifted to Asia,
particularly South Asia and to a lesser extent,
Southeast Asia. This is a signi
ﬁ
cant change from
the era of the 1960s through the 1980s, when
global terrorism was almost invariably linked to
the Middle East or Europe and was sustained and
nurtured by Cold War hostility and competition.


10.2
Terrorism in Asia: A Brief
Survey

Terrorism is typically de
ﬁ
ned as violence threat-
ened or actually committed by nonstate actors
against a state or its agencies for the purpose of
achieving some sort of political goal. The US
Department of State offers a similar de
ﬁ
nition:
terrorism is “premeditated, politically motivated
violence perpetrated against noncombatant tar-
gets by subnational groups or clandestine agents,
usually intended to in
ﬂ
uence an audience”
(Hudson
1999
)
. Terrorists understand the power
of symbols, which is why they generally select
their targets carefully. By focusing on a symbolic
target—for example, a Western luxury hotel
located in an Asian city—terrorists hope to gen-
erate a “high-pro
ﬁ
le impact on the public of their
targeted enemy or enemies with their act of vio-
lence” despite the fact that they typically have
limited resources (Hudson
1999
)
.

In Asia, there is no single type of terrorism.
Some terrorism, such as the Maoist/Naxalite terror-
ism, is ideological and pursues a redistributive
Marxist agenda. Other types of terrorism are clearly
religious in nature (often re
ﬂ
ecting an extreme or
militant interpretation of a religion). Some terrorist
groups have largely local agendas, while others
subscribe to larger transnational goals. The follow-
ing section provides a survey of some major terror-
ist organizations or movements in Asia by
subdividing the region into four subregions (by
descending level of severity): South Asia, Southeast
Asia, Central Asia, and Northeast Asia.

10.2.1
South Asia

South Asia is emerging as the center of gravity
for global terrorism. The three countries of this
subregion that have the greatest threats are, in
descending order, Afghanistan, Pakistan, and
India. In 2010, Afghanistan experienced the
greatest number of terrorist attacks in the world
(3,306), generating 3,202 fatalities (only Iraq had
a higher number of fatalities that year). Pakistan
follows closely behind Afghanistan, with 1,331
attacks and 2,150 fatalities. India comes in third,
with 860 attacks and 809 fatalities. The numbers
wounded in Afghanistan, Pakistan, and India in
2010 were 4,847, 4,522, and 906, respectively
(National Counterterrorism Center
2011
)
.

In the aftermath of 9/11 and subsequent global
concerns about terrorism, Afghanistan assumed

great prominence and is the focus of one of
NATO’s (in the form of the International Security
Assistance Force, or ISAF) most signi
ﬁ
cant mili-
tary mission. As of December 2010, more than
2,270 foreign troops (including 1,440 US and
346 British soldiers) had been killed since the
beginning of the Afghan war (IHS Jane’s
2011a
)
.
Terrorist attacks are rife, and are generally asso-
ciated with the activities of the Afghan Taliban,
the Haqqani network and, to a lesser extent,
Lashkar-e-Taiba, all of which are supported by
Pakistan (Tankel
2011
)
. In April 2011, Admiral
Mike Mullen, Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of
Staff, broke diplomatic protocol by accusing
Pakistan’s Inter-Services Intelligence (ISI) direc-
torate of having powerful links to militants (par-
ticularly those associated with the Haqqani
network), which are
ﬁ
ghting American and other
NATO forces (Khan
2011
)
.

In contrast with Afghanistan, Pakistan hosts a
veritable pantheon of insurgent or terrorist organi-
zations—with active ones numbering more than
40—ranging from sectarian groups to transnational
jihadi organizations. Among the more prominent
are the Paikistani Taliban (Tehrik-i-Taliban),
Lashkar-e-Toiba
(LeT),
Jaish-e-Mohammed,
Lashkar-e-Jhangvi (LJ), Sipah-e-Sahaba Pakistan
(SSP), Jammu and Kashmir Liberation Front,
among many others. Tehrik-i-Taliban (TTP) was
established in 2007 by a
shura
of 40 senior Taliban
leaders, who envisioned that the TTP would act as
an umbrella organization. Based in the FATA and
key districts of the North-West Frontier Province
(NWFP), the TTP seeks to, among other things,

ﬁ
ght against NATO forces in Afghanistan and per-
form “defensive jihad against the Pakistan
army”(Abbas
2008
)
. Meanwhile, Lashkar-e-
Jhangvi acts as the “lynchpin of the alignment
between al-Qaeda, the Pakistani Taliban and sec-
tarian groups”(International Crisis Group
2009b
)
.

The United Nations Consolidated List estab-
lished and maintained by the 1267 Committee
with respect to Al-Qaeda, Osama bin Laden, and
the Taliban (hereafter the “1267 Committee List”)
lists four South Asian organizations, all of which
are based in or have a substantial presence in
Pakistan: Jaish-I-Mohammed , Lashkar-e-Tayyiba,
Lashkar I Jhangvi, and Harakat-Ul Jihad (United
Nations
2011
)
. These disparate groups have been
linked to shocking levels of violence, particularly
during the past 10 years. From 2000 to 2010,
Pakistan witnessed more than 9,387 deaths attrib-
uted to terrorist or insurgent attacks, while more
than 19,819 individuals were wounded in such
attacks (National Counterterrorism Center
2011
)
.

Of the various groups, Lashkar-e-Toiba is
viewed as a group that is adopting an increasingly
global agenda, not only because of its role in the
2008 Mumbai attacks, but also because of its
increasing presence around the world. Former
head of US Paci
ﬁ
c Command, Robert Willard,
testi
ﬁ
ed in 2011 about LeT’s efforts to expand its
presence and in
ﬂ
uence throughout South Asia,
particularly Sri Lanka and the Maldives (Roul

2010
)
. Moreover, Willard noted that “LeT delib-
erately targets westerners and speci
ﬁ
cally engages
coalition forces in Afghanistan.” (Willard
2011b
)
.
As a result, US Paci
ﬁ
c Command is actively
building up state capacity in Nepal, Bangladesh,
Sri Lanka, Maldives, and other locations due to
evidence of growing LeT presence or in
ﬂ
uence
(Willard
2011a
)
. LeT also has linkages to Europe
and North America. When asked about allega-
tions of Pakistan’s linkages to LeT, Willard
responded that the question of Pakistan’s support
of LeT (particularly via its Inter-Services
Intelligence directorate) was a “very sensitive
one” and the subject “continues to be a discus-
sion item between the United States government
and
the
Pakistan
government
in
Islamabad”(Willard

2011a
)
.

Like Pakistan, India is home to a range of ter-
rorist groups and movements. Traditionally, much
of the violence has been associated, one way or
another, with Jammu and Kashmir, but an increas-
ing portion is also related to insurgencies in
India’s northeastern states. For example, in 2008,
over 404 civilians were killed in militant violence
in India’s northeastern region (Srivastava
2009
)
.
Much of the violence is linked to smaller insur-
gent groups in Assam, particularly as the more
established United Liberation Front of Assam
(ULFA) has become weaker (Srivastava
2009
)
.

In addition, India is plagued by the Maoist
(Naxalite) insurgency, which has now spread to
22 out of 28 states in India (Srivastava
2009
)
.


150
P.J. Smith
Between 2008 and 2010, more than 2,600 civil-
ian and security force personnel were killed by
Naxal-related violence in India (Press Trust of
India
2011
)
. The Naxal movement gets its name
from an armed uprising that occurred in Naxalbari,
West Bengal in 1967. Adopting the teachings of
Mao Zedong (as they interpret them), the Maoists
regularly target “class enemies, petty bourgeois,
police informers” either by murder or by sentenc-
ing them to various penalties through their
“People’s Court”(Asian Centre for Human Rights

2006
)
. However, the Maoists are increasingly
facing a dilemma: the more they rely on terrorism
to force their will on the government, the more
they risk alienating the local population on whose
support the insurgency is dependent (Srivastava

2009
)
. Overall, terrorism has been less of a chal-
lenge in India compared to Pakistan; neverthe-
less, more than 6,896 individuals have died in
India as a result of terrorist or insurgent attacks;
another 13,951 have been wounded since 2000
(National Counterterrorism Center
2011
)
.

Bangladesh was once considered a country
where terrorism was in a state of ascendancy, par-
ticularly with the activities of Jamaat ul-Muja-
hideen Bangladesh (JMB) and an array of smaller
groups. JMB was notable for its attack on August
17, 2005, in which the group executed 459 near-
simultaneous bombings that killed 2 and injured
100 (IHS Jane’s
2010a
)
. However, the govern-
ment has taken decisive measures—including
speci
ﬁ
c measures against the JMB—to mitigate
terrorism in the country. Between 2005 and 2010,
for example, only three civilians were killed in
attacks linked to Islamist militants. This contrasts
starkly with the number killed by Left Wing
Extremists (from 2005 to 2010, there were 50
casualties—including 46 terrorists—associated
with left wing extremism). Bangladesh hosts a
plethora of leftist militant groups, including the
Purba Banglar Communist Party, the PBCP
(Janajuddha), PBCP (M-L Red Flag), PBCP
(M-L Communist War), Biplabi Communist
Party, among others (South Asian Terrorism
Portal
2011
)
.

Other countries in South Asia have either com-
paratively or substantially reduced risk in terms of
terrorism. Sri Lanka, for instance, was once known
as the center for some of the most violent terrorism
perpetrated by the Liberation Tigers of Tiger
Eelam (LTTE). However, with that group having
been defeated in 2009, the threat has largely dissi-
pated, although there are concerns about an LTTE
revival within the very large and globally dispersed
ethnic Tamil diaspora.


10.2.2
Southeast Asia

Southeast Asia is the subregion with the second
most severe level of terrorism. The three most
signi
ﬁ
cantly affected countries are Thailand with
418 attacks and 265 fatalities, the Philippines
with 260 attacks and 176 fatalities, and Indonesia
with 18 attacks and 12 fatalities. The number of
wounded in Thailand, Philippines, and Indonesia
during 2010 was 736, 290, and 25, respectively
(National Counterterrorism Center
2011
)
.

Of
ﬁ
cially, the 1267 Committee lists three
groups in Southeast Asia: Jemaah Islamiyah, the
Abu Sayyaf Group, and the Rajah Solaiman
Movement. Among these various groups, Jemaah
Islamiyah (JI) stands out as having had the most
in
ﬂ
uence (and destructive impact, particularly in
Indonesia). On October 2002, JI conducted its
most lethal attack in its history: an attack on the
tourist destination of Bali. Simultaneous bomb-
ings killed more than 200 people (mostly tour-
ists). Later, Indonesian police arrested Abu Bakar
Bashir, who was subsequently convicted but later
released (Indonesian of
ﬁ
cials subsequently con-
victed Bashir in 2011, following a third prosecu-
tion). In August 2003, a JI suicide bomber
attacked the JW Marriott Hotel in Jakarta, which
killed 11 individuals. In October 2003, Indonesian
prosecutors convicted Imam Samudra for his role
in masterminding the Bali bombings. In October
2005, JI conducted its second attack in Bali, by
deploying 3 suicide bombers; over 20 people,
mostly tourists, were killed. In September 2004,
JI bombed the Australian embassy, an attack that
killed 11 and injured another 200.

JI’s bombing successes have, paradoxically,
led to its diminution as a powerful organization.
Aggressive policing by Indonesia, particularly its
Detachment 88, has resulted in more than 450


151
10 Terrorism in Asia: A Persistent Challenge Sustained by Ideological, Physical, and Criminal Enablers
arrests (and 250 convictions) of JI members. This
has spurred divisions and disputes within the
organization, resulting in at least two main wings:
the Hambali wing and the Mainstream wing
(Abuza
2010
)
. The Hambali wing—once led by
Noordin Top prior to his demise—having re-cast
itself as “al-Qaeda in the Malay Archipelago”
sought to engage in robust attacks against Western
targets, while the Mainstream wing sought to
maintain a lower pro
ﬁ
le (to fend off police actions
and arrests) and focus on sectarian con
ﬂ
icts
within Indonesia’s outer islands (Abuza
2010
)
.

On September 17, 2009, Indonesian police
held a news conference in Jakarta in which they
announced the death of Noordin Muhammad
Top, who had been killed in a police assault on
the safe house where he and others had been hid-
ing. Top led a Jemaah Islamiyah splinter group
and was known for his bomb-making skills.
Having evaded police for years, Top was linked
to a series of violent attacks, including suicide
bombings against the Australian Embassy in
Jakarta (2004), three Bali cafes (2005) and the
more recent attacks against the J.W. Marriott and
Ritz-Carlton hotels (July 2009) (Mydans
2009
)
.

Many observers noted that, notwithstanding
the elimination of Top, militancy in Southeast
Asia was not necessarily in decline. The Jakarta-
based newspaper
Republika
, in an editorial,
warned that the ideology of radicalism devel-
oped by Top and others like him “continues to
grow among certain groups in our society”
(Jakarta Republika
2009
)
. Indonesia, as the larg-
est Muslim-majority country in the world, is
often celebrated for its secular and relatively
liberal democracy; simultaneously, however, the
country harbors a signi
ﬁ
cant level of support for
radical Islamist ideologies and moreover, during
the past three legislative elections, “around 10%
of voters have chosen to support radical Islamist
parties—a higher percentage than in Pakistan”
(Barton
2009
)
.

As JI has been weakened by effective
Indonesian law enforcement, it has retreated
into a somewhat latent mode. In some cases,
leaders from JI have moved to other groups.
Abu Bakar Bashir founded a new group, Jama’ah
Ansharut Tauhid (JAT), in 2008. The JAT was
created as a result of
disagreements between
Bashir and other members of the Majelis
Mujahidin Indonesia (MMI). JAT was designed
to cast off some of the political baggage that JI
had accrued (International Crisis Group
2010
)
.
Bashir envisioned that the new organization
would focus on public outreach and education.
Its of
ﬁ
cial goal was to “revitalize the Islamic
movement in support of full victory for the
struggle of the Indonesian faithful”(International
Crisis Group
2010

)
. Similar to JI, JAT followed
strict Sala
ﬁ
st teachings, including those of
Abdullah Azzam and Sayid Qutb.

Despite the fact that it is only 4 years old, JAT
has become in
ﬂ
uential in Indonesia. However,
the organization ran afoul with Indonesian
authorities when a training camp in Aceh, alleg-
edly run by JAT, was discovered (International
Crisis Group
2010
)
. The discovery of the camp
appeared to undermine previous assertions by
JAT leaders that the group was eschewing vio-
lence. In March 2011, during the trial of Abu
Bakar Bashir, Abdul Haris, the leader of JAT’s
Jakarta chapter, revealed that during a meeting at a
restaurant, Bashir requested that Haris and others
help raise money for a military training camp in
Aceh Besar (BBC Monitoring Asia Paci
ﬁ
c-
Political
2011
)
.

Overall, effective law enforcement actions by
the Indonesian Government have greatly dimin-
ished JI’s power and most recently its successor
JAT organization. However, the threat of violence
continues unabated in Indonesia; for instance, on
April 22, 2011, Indonesian police disrupted a
bombing plot intended to be timed with the Easter
holiday. Five bombs, containing in aggregate
over 150 kg of explosives, had been buried next
to a gas pipeline located beside Christ Cathedral
at Serpong, West Jakarta. Police were uncertain if
the plot was designed by the country’s two main
jihadist groups (JI and JAT), or one of the newer,
smaller groups (Alford
2011
)
.

Police concern about the smaller organiza-
tions is well-founded, particularly as a number of
them have adopted violent tactics as their primary
raison d’etre. Such groups include the Fahrul
Tanjung Group in Bandung, which was respon-
sible for the March 15, 2010 attack on a police


152
P.J. Smith
station and the assassination of a police
constable.
Another is the Tim Ightiyalat (from Klaten,
Central Java), responsible for a “crude bombing
campaign against police posts, churches, and a
few mosques” (International Crisis Group
2011a
)
.
A third is the Medan Group, responsible for the
robbery of a Medan branch of the CIMB bank in
August 2010 (International Crisis Group
2011a
)
.

The Philippines contains the other two 1267
Committee listed groups: Abu Sayyaf Group and
Rajah Solaiman Movement (Philippines). Abu
Sayyaf Group split off from the Moro National
Liberation Front (one of two major separatist
organizations in the southern Philippines) in
1991. The group’s founder, Abdurajak Janjalani
served as a
ﬁ
ghter in the anti-Soviet resistance

ﬁ
ght in Afghanistan during the 1980s. The
group’s
ﬁ
rst attack occurred in 1991, when an
ASG operative threw a grenade at two American
evangelists, killing both (Council on Foreign
Relations
2011
)
. In subsequent years, the group
conducted a series of kidnappings involving
Filipino nationals and international tourists
(Council on Foreign Relations
2011
)
.

The Rajah Solaiman Movement was founded
by Ahmad Santos in the late 1990s, following his
conversion to Islam. The Rajah Solaiman shares
similar goals with other Islamist organizations
and is believed to have formed an alliance
between two Al-Qaeda linked organizations:
ASG and JI (BBC News
2005
)
. In addition, mem-
bers of Rajah Solaiman allegedly conducted one
of Southeast Asia’s most lethal attacks: the 2004
sinking of a ferry near Manila that killed more
than 100 people (BBC News
2005
)
.

In addition to Islamist groups, the Philippines
also hosts a major Marxist group, the New
People’s Army (NPA). As the armed wing of the
Communist Party of the Philippines, the New
People’s Army is a classic communist insurgency
that would seem—like the Maoists in India—to
be somewhat of an anachronism during the post
Cold War era. Nevertheless, the group is quite
active and boasts more than 8,500 troops (IHS
Jane’s
2011b
)
. Recently, following a 7-year
impasse, the CPP-NPA and the Philippine
Government agreed to resume negotiations in
Oslo, Norway. At their February meeting, both
sides agreed to establish an 18-month timeframe
for the talks.

In the southern Philippines, the Moro Islamic
Liberation Front (MILF) is behind one of the
country’s most signi
ﬁ
cant insurgencies (al-
though Manila is keen to avoid labeling the
MILF as a terrorist organization, notwithstand-
ing the fact that the MILF has been known to
host foreign jihadis within territory that it con-
trols) (International Crisis Group
2011b
)
. The
Philippine Government has been engaged in pro-
tracted negotiations with MILF, in an attempt to
secure a sustainable peace agreement. One key
obstacle has been certain MILF hardliners, in-
cluding Ameril Ombra Kato who recently broke
off with MILF to form (along with thousands of
his followers) the Bangsamoro Islamic Freedom
Fighters (BIFF) (Malinao
2011
)
. Another obsta-
cle is corruption in the existing Autonomous
Region of Muslim Mindanao, which is used as
“ammunition by critics to argue against any plan
that would result in an expansion of its powers or
territorial reach” (International Crisis Group

2011b
)
.

In addition to listed terrorist groups, Southeast
Asia also hosts a number of second-tier or next
generation terrorist groups or independent individ-
uals. For example, in Southern Thailand, anti-gov-
ernment insurgent violence (resulting in more than
3,300 deaths) has been conducted by a nebulous
collection of individuals and groups, the most
prominent of which appear to be the BRN-
Coordinate (Barison Revolusi National-Coordinate)
and the Patani United Liberation Organization
(PULO) (IHS Jane’s
2008
)
. Currently, the most
violent region of Southeast Asia, from a terrorism
casualty perspective, is southern Thailand. Since
2004, nearly 4,000 people have lost their lives in
violence perpetrated in just three Muslim-majority
provinces, Yala, Pattani, and Narathiwat (roughly
two-thirds of the casualties have been Muslims)
(IHS Jane’s
2011e
)
.

Similarly, Indonesia hosts a number of groups
that do not receive the same spotlight as that
devoted to Jemaah Islamiyah. Some of these sec-
ond-tier groups include (or have included) Ring
Banten (an offshoot of the historically rooted Darul
Islam movement), Mujahidin KOMPAK, Jama’ah


153
10 Terrorism in Asia: A Persistent Challenge Sustained by Ideological, Physical, and Criminal Enablers
Tauhid wal Jihad, Hizb-ul-Tahrir Indonesia (HTI),
among others (Chalk
2009
; International Crisis
Group
2009a
)
. Some of these groups have strong
(current or former) af
ﬁ
liation with JI, while other
groups act independently or pursue different goals.
In the Philippines, a previously unknown group,
the Bansamoro National Liberation Army, recently
claimed responsibility for a bomb attack in late
September 2009, which killed two American sol-
diers and a Filipino marine (Jacinto
2009
)
.


10.2.3
Central Asia

Central Asia is the third most serious subregion in
terms of terrorism, although comparatively, its sit-
uation is much more benign when compared to
South or Southeast Asia. Tajikistan reported the
most serious attack in 2010 (1 attack causing 2
fatalities, wounding 28), while Kyrgyzstan re-
ported 1 attack (no fatalities, 7 wounded) (National
Counterterrorism Center
2011
)
. According to the
NCTC database, Kazakhstan, Uzbekistan, and
Turkmenistan did not report any terrorism inci-
dents in 2010. Nevertheless, there remains at least
a latent threat of terrorism.

The UN 1267 Committee lists only one terror-
ist group based in—or with substantial presence
in or linkage to—Central Asia: Islamic Movement
of Uzbekistan, a group that was much more pow-
erful in the 1990s compared to today. In 1999 and
2000, the IMU was accused of launching attacks
into Uzbekistan and Kyrgyzstan from the Ferghana
Valley. However, US operations in Afghanistan,
following the 9/11 attacks, led to the destruction
of several key IMU bases. From that time, the
IMU, or its remnants, regrouped in Pakistan, espe-
cially within the tribal lands of the country’s
northwest region. Later, the group spawned an
offshoot organization, the Islamic Jihad Union
(IJU), which has maintained a presence in North
Waziristan in Pakistan’s Federally Administered
Tribal Areas (FATA) (IHS Jane’s
2010b
)
.

Both the IMU and IJU threaten not only
Uzbekistan, but also neighboring Kyrgyzstan and
Tajikistan, particularly as these countries have
less governance capacity and less ability to con-
trol unauthorized border crossings. Another group
in Central Asia is Hizb ut-Tahrir (HuT). The HuT
is considered a major threat within Uzbekistan,
although the group generally does not conduct
violent attacks. Instead, it
ﬁ
ghts its own “war of
ideas” by disseminating propaganda that urges
people to return to “an Islamic way of life” (IHS
Jane’s
2011d

)
. The HuT advocates the creation of
a central Asian caliphate. In Uzbekistan, mere
possession of HuT literature is a criminal offense,
with potential jail terms as long as 10 years. In
Tajikistan, thousands of HuT followers have been
arrested and imprisoned (IHS Jane’s
2011d
)
.

In Kazakhstan, terrorism appears to be much
less of a challenge compared to its neighbors,
particularly after the Kazakhstan Government
declared 13 organizations, including Al Qaeda
and the Islamic Movement of Uzbekistan, to be
terrorist or extremist organizations, thus prohibit-
ing all of their activities within the country. To
demonstrate its determination to enforce the ban,
the Kazakhstan Government sentenced an activ-
ist to 2 years in jail for his “involvement in the
operations of the Hizb-ut-Tahrir-al-Islami reli-
gious association”(Interfax
2011
)
. A month ear-
lier, the same court sentenced another two men
for varying jail terms for their membership in the
Hizb-ut-Tahrir organization (Interfax
2011
)
.

10.2.4
Northeast Asia

Of the four subregions of Asia, Northeast Asia
appears to have the least amount of threat.

According to the NCTC database, China expe-
rienced the greatest number of terrorist attacks
during 2010 (1 attack with 6 deaths and 15
wounded) (National Counterterrorism Center

2011
)
. The other major countries in the region—
including Japan, South Korea, Taiwan, North
Korea, and Mongolia—have no recorded inci-
dents. This was not always the case, however.
North Korea has played the role of state sponsor
of terrorism, For example, on November 28,
1987, two North Korean agents blew up Korean
Air Flight 858, and then swallowed cyanide cap-
sules (although only one actually died). In Japan,
the Japanese Red Army (Sekigun) was prominent
during the 1960s and 1970s. In the 1990s, the


154
P.J. Smith
religious group Aum Shinrikyo emerged as
a signi
ﬁ
cant threat and conducted a major chemi-
cal attack on Tokyo’s subway system in 1995,
which killed approximately 12 people and injured
more than 5,000.

Nevertheless, today, most terrorism seems to
be concentrated in, of all places, the People’s
Republic of China. The U.N. 1267 Committee
of
ﬁ
cially lists the East Turkistan Islamic
Movement (ETIM), which has been described as
a
terrorist
organization
by
the
Chinese
Government (although many reports suggest that
ETIM’s level of threat and operational capacity
have signi
ﬁ
cantly declined). China’s terrorism
concerns center around the Xinjiang Uighur
Autonomous Region (XUAR), which is home to
roughly eight million non-Han Uighurs and other
minorities.

Beijing characterizes unrest in Xinjiang as
being a manifestation of the “three evils,” namely
terrorism (恐怖主义), separatism (分裂主义)
and extremism (极端主义) (Dreyer
2005
)
. In
January 2002, the Chinese Government issued a
report titled “East Turkistan Terrorist Forces
Cannot Get Away with Impunity” (Xinhua
2002
)
.
The report asserted that since the 1990s, “the
‘East Turkistan’ forces inside and outside Chinese
territory have planned and organized a series of
violent incidents in the Xinjiang Uygur [Uighur]
Autonomous Region of China and some other
countries” (Xinhua
2002
)
. The report further
alleged that from 1990 to 2001, East Turkistan
terrorists (both within China and abroad) were
linked to over 200 terrorist incidents in Xinjiang
“resulting in the deaths of 162 people of all eth-
nic groups, including grass-roots of
ﬁ
cials and
religious personnel, and injuries to more than 440
people” (Xinhua
2002
)
.

Subsequently, China of
ﬁ
cially listed four
groups that it deemed instigators of terror. They
included the East Turkestan Islamic Movement,
or ETIM (东突厥斯坦伊斯兰运动), the East
Turkestan Liberation Organization, or ETLO (东
突厥斯坦解放组织), the World Uighur Youth
Congress, or WUYC (世界维吾尔青年代表大会),
and the East Turkestan Information Center, or
ETIC (东突厥斯坦新闻信息中心). Of the four
groups, ETIM seems to have had the most

credible relationship to terrorism, particularly
given past ties to Osama bin Laden and the Al
Qaeda organization (Mackerras
2007
)
.

China attributes a number of domestic plots to
these organizations or to the general movement
underpinning them. One of these plots occurred
on March 7, 2008 when a China Southern Airlines
jet took off from Urumqi (capital of the north-
west Xinjiang Uighur Autonomous Region) and

ﬂ
ew toward Beijing. After 2 h into the
ﬂ
ight, the
plane made an emergency landing in Lanzhou,
capital
of
neighboring
Gansu
Province.
Authorities later reported that they had captured a
19-year-old female ethnic Uighur (and an appar-
ent accomplice), whom they accused of attempt-
ing to set
ﬁ
re to the airplane while in
ﬂ
ight. The
Chinese government later characterized the act as
“organized and premeditated” (Xinhua
2008
)
.
Other plots were uncovered, particularly around
the time of the 2008 Olympic Games (Straits
Times
2008
)
. In April 2008, Chinese of
ﬁ
cials
announced that they had broken up a terrorism
conspiracy involving 35 members of the East
Turkestan Islamic Movement (ETIM). A Chinese
of
ﬁ
cial reported that the group “had plotted to
kidnap foreign journalists, tourists and athletes
during the Beijing Olympics” (Johnson
2008
)
.

In July 2009, China witnessed a major out-
burst of ethnic unrest in Xinjiang. The riots,
ﬁ
rst
led by ethnic Uighurs, were then followed by
revenge attacks by ethnic Han Chinese. Overall,
more than 190 people were killed and more than
1,600 were arrested. The chaos prompted China’s
President, Hu Jintao, to abruptly return home
from the G8 Summit, being held in Italy. Since
that time, Beijing has signi
ﬁ
cantly increased law
enforcement presence in the Xinjiang region and
has, periodically, uncovered plots and conspira-
cies which Chinese of
ﬁ
cials allege are indicative
of a persistent challenge of terrorism.

10.3
Asia’s Ideological Enabling
Environment

The global shift of terrorism to Asia is driven by
a number of ideological, functional, and criminal
enabling factors. Perhaps the most powerful of


155
10 Terrorism in Asia: A Persistent Challenge Sustained by Ideological, Physical, and Criminal Enablers
these is the role of ideology. Terrorism is, after
all, violence committed as part of a larger cam-
paign to achieve political ends. As would be
expected, there is no single ideological driver that
pervades such a vast region. In some countries
(such as the Philippines or Thailand), local insur-
gencies have an Islamic character—and some-
times even deploy jihadi ideas—but their struggle
is largely local in nature: “The minority groups
involved in these struggles
ﬁ
ght for separation or
autonomy from the existing political regimes that
they perceive to be guilty of imposing discrimi-
natory policies” (Helfstein
2008
)
.

Yet even these movements can be heavily
in
ﬂ
uenced by international trends. In Southern
Thailand, although insurgent violence is perhaps
more genuinely “local” than most of the region’s
other insurgencies, it is also apparent that militant
groups are increasingly invoking global jihadi
narratives and images—including referring to
southern Thailand as
Dar al-Harb
(House of
War)—as part of their recruitment efforts
(International Crisis Group
2009c
)
. As Thitinan
Pongsudhirak has argued: “The heightened aware-
ness of Muslim identity worldwide in the after-
math of September 11 provides a context for local
Muslim grievances in Thailand’s deep south”
(Pongsudhirak
2007
)
. However, at the same time,
it is important to draw a distinction between
“Muslim grievances” and ultimate objectives,
which may diverge substantially with organiza-
tions with more global agendas. An editorial in a
prominent English-language Thai newspaper
stated that Malay separatists are not interested in
taking over the Thai state (in contrast with the for-
mer Communist Party of Thailand); instead, the
Malays “just want their homeland back” (The
Nation [Thailand]
2011
)
.

In other cases, the agenda of a particular group
may expand along a spectrum of motives, encom-
passing both the local and the global. In these
cases, the persistent grievance narrative may
relate to the abuse of Muslims around the world.
As Kumar Ramakrishna has noted: “The suffer-
ing of Muslims anywhere, especially where the
United States is directly involved—as in the
instance of collateral civilian casualties in Iraq
and Afghanistan—can, as liberal Muslim scholar
Akbar Ahmed points out, be ‘used by extremists’
to ‘reinforce this feeling that all Muslims are
under attack’” (Ramakrishna
2005
)
. Imam
Samudra justi
ﬁ
ed the 2002 Bali bombing partly
on the rationale that the USA and its allies had
bombed innocent Muslims in Afghanistan in
2001 (Bin Hassan
2007
)
. In addition, the bomb-
ing targets (Paddy’s Bar and Sari Club) were
“places of vice” that had “no value in Islam”(Bin
Hassan
2007
)
.

In some cases, the local–global nexus is facili-
tated by geographical cross-pollination of ideas
or informal mutual cooperation agreements. For
example, the arrest of Umar Patek in Pakistan
(Patek was one of the top militants responsible
for the 2002 Bali bombing in Indonesia) sug-
gested some degree of convergence between
Pakistan militants and their Indonesian counter-
parts, although the exact nature and extent are
uncertain. One theory posits that JI possibly
wanted to establish a new training facility in the
Federal Administered Tribal Areas (FATA) in
much the same way that it had previously estab-
lished an overseas training facility in the southern
Philippines, under the aegis of the Moro Islamic
Liberation Front (MILF) (Abuza
2011
)
. Pakistan’s
potential role in this regard would not be surpris-
ing; the North Waziristan region is viewed by
Western intelligence and police of
ﬁ
cials as a key
enabler for plots in Europe, North America, and
other parts of the world (Keaten
2011
)
.

In addition, many contemporary movements
may have extensive histories: in Indonesia,
Jemaah Islamiyah reinvigorated some of the same
aims and themes of an earlier (1950s era) move-
ment known as Darul Islam, except that JI’s links
to global organizations have helped the organiza-
tion cultivate both a local and international
agenda (in contrast with Darul Islam’s more local
orientation) (Barton
2009
)
. In South Asia, the
unresolved status of Jammu and Kashmir fosters
a pretext for substate militancy, some of which is
supported clandestinely by of
ﬁ
cial agencies.
Pakistan’s security agencies, including the Inter
Services Intelligence (ISI) directorate have pro-
vided funding for substate insurgent groups,
including those with an active global agenda,
since the late 1940s (Ganguly and Kapur
2010
)
.

Non-Islamist insurgency organizations thrive
on very different ideological narratives. In India,
Maoists thrive on rural desperation and frustra-
tion with perceived government incompetence.
In the Philippines, the New People’s Army (NPA)
has thrived on themes of unfair distribution of
wealth, government failures to protect the rights
of the poor and similar grievances linked to ineq-
uities (both real and perceived) (Ferrer
2007
)
.

10.4
Asia’s Functional Enabling
Environment

Complementing the ideological enabling environ-
ment in Asia is the functional enabling environ-
ment. This refers to physical, institutional, or
geographical enablers that allow terrorism to

ﬂ
ourish (Ramakrishna
2005

)
. For Asia, six func-
tional enablers in particular deserve special focus.

First, Asia’s vast, unique, and sometimes
impenetrable geography provides an enabling
factor for terrorism. Porous borders facilitate
clandestine border-crossings for militants or their
supporters. In addition, Asia’s archipelagic geog-
raphy creates almost inevitable maritime border
porosity, which in turn aids violent nonstate
actors. This same border environment also facili-
tates transnational crime, which can in turn sup-
port transnational terrorism.

In South Asia, porous borders between
Bangladesh and India’s northeastern region have
been linked to a convergence of agendas and
operations among Islamist groups based in Assam
and Bangladesh. Ease of entry into the region has
reportedly
provided
functional
space
for
Pakistan’s Inter-Services Intelligence (ISI) direc-
torate, which has been accused of attempting to
destabilize the region (Kumar
2011
)
.

The second functional enabler for terrorism is
the wide availability of arms and explosives. Just
as the region’s porous borders allow in
ﬁ
ltration
or ex
ﬁ
ltration of militants, they also facilitate the
smuggling of small arms and light weapons. India
and Pakistan are estimated to have roughly 40
million and 20 million illegal
ﬁ
rearms circulating
within their populations, respectively (IHS Jane’s

2010a
)
. In Pakistan alone, an estimated 400,000
illegal
ﬁ
rearms are linked to various types of
criminal activities (IHS Jane’s
2010a
)
. In
Cambodia, a surfeit of small arms—a portion of
which is held by demobilized soldiers—is viewed
as a major contributor to rampant gun crimes in
the country (IHS Jane’s
2011c
)
. In the Philippines,
authorities recently discovered a “bomb factory”
in a cave in Davao, which was being used and
maintained by Communist rebels. In addition,
police discovered military-style arms, including
two anti-armor mines, four anti-personnel mines,
700 containers of liquid explosives, among other
items (Romero
2011
)
.

In some cases, arms will seep from the state-
realm to the non-state realm as a result of corrup-
tion, criminality, or negligence. In 2003, for
example, a senior Armed Forces of the Philippines
(AFP) of
ﬁ
cer admitted that over 8,000 army
weapons had “gone missing” in Sulu Province
over a 14-year period; many of these weapons
ended up in the hands of MILF or ASG operatives
(Capie
2005

)
. In August 2010, Defense Secretary
Voltaire Gazmin admitted that the AFP had pro-
vided weapons to the Ampatuan clan of
Maguindanao Province, which was reportedly
assisting the government in
ﬁ
ghting the Moro
Islamic Liberation Front (MILF), in addition to
various other groups that were supported as part
of the government’s
ﬁ
ght against the New People’s
Army. Many of the weapons—typically small
arms—are unaccounted for, while at least one of
the groups supplied with arms by the government
(the Kuratong Baleleng group) has recently
“evolved” into a criminal syndicate group engaged
in bank robbery, kidnapping, drug smuggling, and
other similar activities (Depasupil
2010
)
.

A third functional enabler is weak, corrupt, or
ineffective governance. Effective governance
can include a government’s ability or willing-
ness to address legitimate grievances or injus-
tices that are uniquely “local” and often
historically rooted. Effective governance also
implies minimal corruption, a factor that can
in
ﬂ
uence terrorism trends in unexpected ways.
First, widespread corruption typically accompa-
nies a dismissive attitude toward rule of law,
which reduces the institutional capacity of par-
ticular governments. Second, corruption under-


157
10 Terrorism in Asia: A Persistent Challenge Sustained by Ideological, Physical, and Criminal Enablers
mines or delegitimizes con
ﬁ
dence in government
policies because of perceptions that impartiality
or justice can be “bought” by opposing interest
groups (Transparency International
2008
)
.

A corollary to good governance is healthy and
robust state capacity. Weak states are often pre-
sumed to be more vulnerable to terrorist activities
and groups, particularly as the latter may seek to
take advantage of state weakness (including a
particular government’s inability to enforce laws,
to institute border controls, to have effective con-
trol over parts of its territory, to monitor
ﬁ
nancial
transactions, and so on). A US Congressional
Research Service study assessed that “terrorists
can bene
ﬁ
t from lax or non-existent law enforce-
ment in these [weak and failing] states to partici-
pate in illicit economic activities to
ﬁ
nance their
operations and ease their access to weapons and
other equipment” (Wyler
2008
)
. Moreover, the
issue can be even more complicated. For exam-
ple, a 2003 study conducted for the US Central
Intelligence Agency differentiated between
“caves” (failed states where governance is inef-
fective or nonexistent) and “condos” (states that
enjoy modern infrastructure, which allows for
easy transit, communication and access to fund-
ing) (Wyler
2008
)
. Another conception posits
that the “quasi” state—the state which is reason-
ably functional, but weaker than a developed
country—is more dangerous because it provides
such enabling infrastructures (Menkhaus
2003
)
.
Pakistan and Indonesia might qualify as “con-
dos” or quasi states, because of their reasonably
modern infrastructure and connectivity to the
global economic system.

A fourth functional enabler is the pervasive
role of the Internet. The Internet has emerged as a
major functional enabler for terrorism during the
past decade. A recent British Government report
found that the Internet is one of the few “unregu-
lated spaces where radicalization is able to take
place,” which also serves as a platform where
individuals can
ﬁ
nd “like-minded individuals and
groups” (House of Commons
2012
)
. In Southeast
Asia, jihadist websites are an increasingly com-
mon phenomenon. The number of extremist web-
sites (including individual blogs) in the region is
estimated to range between 150 and 200 (China
Daily Online
2009

)
. According to one assessment,
Southeast Asian jihadist websites are “equally, if
not more, focused on global jihadist issues than
they are on local or regional issues” (Brachman

2009

)
. These websites act as an electronic foun-
dation that allows the “promulgation and transla-
tion of global jihadist media and writings”
throughout
the
region
(Brachman

2009
)
.
Moreover, the American newspaper columnist
Thomas Friedman has characterized the ability of
small groups to gather and train via the Internet as
a “virtual Afghanistan”—a loose network of
Internet websites, prayer associations and mosques
(both electronic and real) that “recruit, inspire and
train young Muslims to kill without any formal
orders from Al Qaeda” (Friedman
2009
)
.

A
ﬁ
fth functional enabler is the growth and
spread of suicide techniques throughout Asia.
Inspired by the success of Hezbollah in deploying
suicide bombing tactics in Beirut in the early
1980s, the leader of the Liberation Tigers of Tamil
Eelam (LTTE) decided to deploy such tactics in
Sri Lanka. “If we conduct Black Tiger [suicide]
operations,” Velupillai Prabhakaran reportedly
stated, “We can shorten the suffering of the people
and achieve Tamil Eelam [Tamil Homeland] in a
shorter period of time.” (Smith
2008
)
. From the
mid-1980s until the group’s demise in Sri Lanka
in 2009, the LTTE conducted more than 160 sui-
cide bombings, including the May 1991 assassi-
nation of former Indian Prime Minister Rajiv
Gandhi and the 1993 assassination of Sri Lankan
President Ranasinghe Premadasa.

Today, however, Pakistan is ground zero for
suicide terrorism in South Asia; in 2010 alone,
over 135 suicide bombing attacks were recorded
(resulting in 2219 deaths and 6034 wounded)
(National
Counterterrorism
Center

2011
)
.
Terhrik-e-Taliban (TTP) is particularly notorious
for its use of suicide bombing tactics in Pakistan.
In January 2011, the US State Department desig-
nated TTP leader Qari Hussain under Executive
Order 13224 (US designation and
ﬁ
nancial block-
ing of terrorists and terrorist organizations).
Hussain was described as one of the TTP’s “top
lieutenants” who organized the group’s camps
that trained the TTP’s cadre of suicide bombers
(US State Department
2011
)
.


158
P.J. Smith

In Southeast Asia, Indonesia has emerged as
the center for suicide terrorism; the country has
witnessed at least four major suicide attacks since
2003, causing at least 48 deaths in total. Although
such methods are not totally new to the region,
their most recent appearance clearly derives from
operational (or ideational) linkages between
Southeast Asian groups and their South Asian or
Middle Eastern counterparts (Dale
1988
)
. In
2009, the youngest child of a prominent JI leader
posted a justi
ﬁ
cation of suicide bombings on a
jihadist website. The statement reasoned that as
long as these “acts of martyrdom” are conducted
in a sincere manner and in accordance with the
demands of Shariah, then these bombers will “be
martyrs on the path of Allah” (Muslim Daily

2009
)
. Some scholars predict that suicide bomb-
ing methods may spread and become more fre-
quent in such countries as Thailand and the
Philippines (Dolnik
2007
)
.

A sixth functional enabler might be described as
the collective effects and in
ﬂ
uences of poverty,
unemployment, and disruptive globalization. In
2004, the US National Intelligence Council issued
a future assessment of the global security environ-
ment in which it described globalization (de
ﬁ
ned
as increasing
ﬂ
ows of trade, people and ideas) as an
“overarching ‘mega-trend,’ a force so ubiquitous
that it will substantially shape all the other major
trends in the world of 2020” (National Intelligence
Council
2004
)
. Such force can promote extreme
insecurity, particularly as it is accompanied by
“large-scale social, economic, and aesthetic disrup-
tion” (Newman
2006
)
. Moreover, socially conser-
vative societies are forced to contend with an
“invasion of images that evoke outrage and disgust
as much as envy in the hearts of those who are
exposed to them”(Newman
2006
)
.

The same National Intelligence Council report
warned that globalization is likely to produce
“winners” and “those left behind” (National
Intelligence Council
2004
)
. One indicator of
being left behind is rampant unemployment in
many parts of the developing world. For example,
in Afghanistan and Pakistan, unemployment is
rife. In Afghanistan, unemployment has been
estimated to range between 30 and 50% (Rezaie

2011
)
. In Pakistan, the of
ﬁ
cial unemployment
rate during 2009–2010 was 5.6% (Business
Recorder
2011
)
. Unof
ﬁ
cial estimates place the
rate as high as 25% (Right Vision News
2011
)
.
Many who have jobs are just marginally better
off; 84.6% of the working population in Pakistan
earns less than $2 a day (
The Nation [Pakistan]

2011a,
b
)
. In Indonesia, an estimated 7.14% of
the workforce (8.32 million Indonesians) is
unemployed, according to government statistics
(Antara
2011
)
.

In India, poverty and unemployment are seen
as enabling factors that sustain the Naxalite
(Maoist) movement. A study commissioned by
the Indian government recently found that “cre-
ation of employment opportunities, immediate
land reforms, and good governance” could be an
effective antidote to the continued appeal and
spread of Naxalism (Sharma
2011
)
. However,
others have voiced skepticism about the pre-
sumed nexus between economic development
and terrorism. Ajai Sahni, an Indian-based terror-
ism analyst, argues that historically “no country
has ever ‘out-developed’ an ongoing insurgency
or terrorist movement” (Sahni
2010
)
.

10.5
The Terrorism–Crime Nexus

Another major functional enabler for terrorism is
crime. Although terrorism itself is typically
classi
ﬁ
ed by most countries as a crime, it is often
dependent on an array of “supportive crimes”
that allows it to achieve certain logistical objec-
tives, particularly funding. In some cases, terror-
ist groups will develop their own “in house”
specialists—passport forgers, for instance—who
provide key logistical services; in other cases,
terrorists may forge alliances with criminal
groups that specialize in certain operational spe-
cialties: “criminal and terrorist groups regularly
engage in strategic alliances to provide goods or
services”(Makarenko
2005
)
.

In his recent testimony to the US Congress,
James Clapper, Director of National Intelligence,
stated: “terrorists and insurgents will turn to
crime to generate funding and acquire logistical
support from criminals in part because of US and
Western success in attacking other sources of


159
10 Terrorism in Asia: A Persistent Challenge Sustained by Ideological, Physical, and Criminal Enablers
their funding” (Clapper
2011
)
. In 2010, a
Congressional Research Service report warned
that potential links between crime and terrorism
could “increase US vulnerability to attack by ter-
rorist groups with enhanced criminal capabilities
and
ﬁ
nancial resources” (Rollins and Wyler
2010
)
.

Perhaps the most important crime associated
with terrorism is money laundering, which is
involved not only with sourcing of funds, but also
their distribution. In the months following the 9/11
attacks in the United States, US of
ﬁ
cials began to
focus on the
ﬁ
nancial dimensions of Al Qaeda.
A number of investigations concluded that, not-
withstanding Osama Bin Laden’s personal wealth,
Al Qaeda and similar groups had access to a steady
stream of funding, which emanated from the
Middle East
ﬂ
owing under the imprimatur of char-
itable contributions. Indeed, numerous charities in
the United States were prosecuted under federal
money laundering statutes due to their diversion of
funds to terrorist organizations.

One country in particular, Saudi Arabia, was
highlighted as a key provider of charitable funds
that were being accessed by terrorist groups.
Internal US Government assessments revealed,
as late as 2010, that “donors in Saudi Arabia con-
stitute the most signi
ﬁ
cant source of funding to
Sunni terrorists groups worldwide” (Lichtblau
and Schmitt
2010
)
. In an addition to supporting
LeT in South Asia, Saudi Arabian donors have
also been known to provide
ﬁ
nancial support to
other groups, particularly those in Southeast
Asia. Having received funds, the organization
must transfer or hold such assets, through formal
banking instruments (such as using a
ﬁ
ctitious
name associated with a bank account) or infor-
mal means, such as relying on the hawala system,
to transfer money.

If an Asian terrorist organization cannot
access funds from gifts and charitable organiza-
tions, it may have to take matters into its own
hands by, among other things, robbing banks.
This is neither surprising nor historically unique.
Groups as diverse as the Irish Republican Army,
the Italian Red Brigades and the German Red
Army Faction regularly, or at certain times,
engaged in bank robbery as a means of acquiring
badly needed cash (Smith
2008
)
. In Southeast
Asia, JI members robbed a gold and jewelry
store in West Java in August 2002, in order to
raise money for its imminent attack in Bali that
year (


Jablonski and Dutton
2004
). JI has justi
ﬁ
ed
such activities by invoking the concept of
fa’i
,
which permits robbing non-believers as a means
of raising cash for jihad (Croissant and Barlow

2007

)
. Imam Samudra encouraged his followers
to learn new and sophisticated forms of robbery,
such as computer hacking and carding (carding,
a form of hacking, involves breaking a credit
card code which allows the user access to the
credit facility) (Bin Hassan
2007
)
. Moreover, he
urged that his followers, armed with their newly
acquired hacking and carding skills, direct their
efforts solely against Americans “as part of
Muslims’
ﬁ
ght against America’s imperialism,
arrogance, and oppression” (Bin Hassan
2007
)
.

In addition to JI, other groups in Asia have
turned to classic robbery to raise funds. In late
2009 and 2010, Jamaah Ansharut Tauhid (JAT)
conducted four robberies that netted the organi-
zation more than $80,000 (Abuza
2010
)
. In
Malaysia, the group Kumpulun Mujahideen
Malaysia (later renamed Kumpulan Militan
Malaysia or KMM) robbed a Hong Leong Bank
branch in Petaling Jaya, Selangor in December
2000; its success emboldened the group’s mem-
bers to attempt another robbery at the Southern
Bank branch in Jalan Gasing, Petaling Jaya in
May 2001, although this act was unsuccessful
after one of the robbers was shot dead and the
others were arrested (Noor
2007
)
.

In 2009, the Reserve Bank of India circulated
a notice to all banks in Kerala to increase security
following intelligence reports that the now-inac-
tive LTTE was planning to conduct a series of
bank robberies in order to raise funds (Press Trust
of India
2009
)
. In June 2010, Pakistani police
killed one and captured three activists of the
Lashkar-e-Jhangvi (LJ) group after they con-
ducted a bank robbery in Organi Town. The four
men, armed with pistols and hand grenades, held
20 employees of the bank hostage for 90 min.
They were able to take out Rs. 2.7 million prior to
being captured by Pakistan’s Rangers and its
Special Investigation Unit (SIU) (BBC Monitoring
Asia Paci
ﬁ
c-Political
2010
)
.


160
P.J. Smith

Kidnapping is another way that some Asia-
based terrorist groups have raised money. Perhaps
most notorious for this activity is the Abu Sayyaf
Group (ASG) in the Philippines, which has been
linked to a kidnapping spree in that country since
the late 1990s. Some of its more prominent
attacks have included the kidnapping (in June
2008) of news anchor Ces Drilon and two crew
members who had been working on a story about
the Abu Sayyaf. In May 2001, ASG rebels kid-
napped 20 people from the Dos Palmas beach
resort on Palawan island (including three
Americans, Martin Burnham, Gracia Burnham,
and Guillermo Sobero). Sobero was beheaded the
following month; Martin and Gracia Burnham
were held hostage for about a year. Martin
Burnham was later killed during a Philippine
hostage rescue operation, while Gracia Burnham
survived.

The Dos Palmas kidnapping occurred approx-
imately 1 year after another notorious case in
which Abu Sayyaf militants launched a cross-
border (maritime) raid into Malaysia, kidnapping
21 European and Asian hostages from a luxury
resort in Sipadan. The year-long hostage crisis
attracted international media attention, including
an intervention by the Libyan Government, which
reportedly paid a ransom to the ASG operatives.

Another crime linked to terrorist groups is
human traf
ﬁ
cking. Prior to its defeat by Sri
Lankan Government forces, the Liberation Tigers
of Tamil Eelam (LTTE) regularly conducted both
human traf
ﬁ
cking and migrant smuggling activi-
ties as a means, primarily, of raising cash. The
LTTE also demonstrated its ability to conduct
related criminal activities, including extortion
and money laundering. Canadian of
ﬁ
cials have
publicly voiced concerns that recent episodes of
mass migration (including the arrival of ships in
2010, such as the MV Sun Sea, which carried 490
Tamils to Canada) are being organized by the
LTTE or its overseas remnant organization,
including the European-based Transnational
Government of Tamil Eelam (TGTE) (Kamloops
Daily News
2011
; Asian Tribune
2011
)
. Canada’s
Public Safety Minister, Vic Toews, announced
shortly after the arrival of the MV Sun Sea
(August 2010) that “we are very concerned that
there are elements of the LTTE and the Tamil
Tigers on board this vessel” (Coyne
2010
)
. In
2009, Sri Lankan Defence Ministry of
ﬁ
cials
identi
ﬁ
ed Ravi Shankar Kanagarajah (alias
“Shangili”) as a key LTTE arms and human
smuggler, who owned three ships that have been
extensively used for the smuggling of people and
weapons (Colombo Times
2009
)
.

Closely related to human traf
ﬁ
cking is the
crime of passport fraud, particularly as terrorists
require forged identity documents as a means to
clandestinely transit borders. Thailand is reputed
to be one of the top passport forging centers in
the world (Thailand Press Reports
2006
)
.
Hambali, the former JI leader, was captured
because Thai and American of
ﬁ
cials were able to
track down his passport forger in Chiang Mai.
Thailand has had a persistent reputation as a cen-
ter for passport forgery. In December 2010, police
in Thailand, working with their Spanish counter-
parts, arrested two Pakistani men and a Thai
woman in a Bangkok apartment; the three were
part of an international passport forgery ring. In
Spain, police arrested another eight members of
the ring (comprised of seven Pakistanis and one
Nigerian). The group would steal passports from
tourists and others around the Barcelona area,
then send them to Thailand to be altered. The
group allegedly supplied forged passports to ter-
rorists responsible for the 2004 bombing of the
Madrid commuter rail station (which killed 191
people) and the 2008 Mumbai attacks (which
killed 195 people) (Thailand Press Reports
2010
)
.
Other customers included Lashkar-e-Taiba and
the LTTE (Associated Press
2011
)
.

Globally, a strong association exists between
terrorism and the global illicit narcotics trade.
According to Anthony P. Pacido of the US Drug
Enforcement Administration (DEA), 18 of 44 des-
ignated international terrorist groups (designated
by the US Government as a Foreign Terrorist
Organization) “have been linked to some aspect” of
narcotics traf
ﬁ
cking (Pacido
2010
)
. In Afghanistan,
the Taliban has earned hundreds of millions of dol-
lars from the proceeds of narcotics traf
ﬁ
cking in
Afghanistan; some of these funds are used to pur-
chase arms that are used against USA and coalition
forces in Afghanistan (Pacido
2010
)
.


161
10 Terrorism in Asia: A Persistent Challenge Sustained by Ideological, Physical, and Criminal Enablers

More signi
ﬁ
cantly, as Afghanistan’s drug
culture has spread throughout the region, it has
provided opportunities for terrorist organiza-
tions in neighboring states. The IMU, for
instance, was able to control the drug trade
from Afghanistan to Central Asia in the late
1990s via its linkages with the Taliban, Al
Qaeda and corrupt of
ﬁ
cials in the region
(Cornell
2006
)
. More recently, Russian and
Kyrgyz of
ﬁ
cials have expressed concerns about
a growing narcotics–militancy nexus. Drug sei-
zures in Kyrgyzstan have increased dramati-
cally; in 2008, of
ﬁ
cials there seized 8.2 tons of
narcotics, compared to 5.0 tons in 2007 (IHS
Jane’s
2009
)
.

In some cases, terrorist groups will funnel ill-
gotten cash into legitimate businesses. In the
early 2000s, Lashkar-e-Taiba began to invest its
assets (both derived from gifts as well as criminal
activities) in an array of legitimate businesses,
including “commodity trading, real estate, and
production of consumer goods” (
Jablonski and
Dutton
2004
). Similarly, JI has plowed some of
its cash into businesses that could earn even
greater wealth. Indonesian intelligence of
ﬁ
cials
acknowledged the fact that JI had businesses sell-
ing an array of goods: magazines, VCDs, fertil-
izer, bread, and coffee (Lopez
2007
)
.

Although terrorists tend to engage in crime for
instrumental reasons—as a way of gaining access
to funds or other logistics—in some cases the
association may be much thicker. Such is the case
with the South Asian-based Dawood Ibrahim,
whose organization represents a “fusion model”
in which terrorism and crime manifest within a
single entity. Ibrahim’s “D-Company” is known
to be involved in an array of activities linked to
both crime, terrorism and insurgency, including
extortion, smuggling, narcotics, and contract kill-
ing (Rollins and Wyler
2010
)
.

10.6
Conclusion

As the global center of economic power has
undergone a shift to Asia, it is not surprising
that the center of gravity for global terrorism
has shifted with it. In addition, a number of
longstanding local con
ﬂ
icts (e.g., Afghanistan,
Kashmir, Mindanao) provide their own enabling
energy, stimulating a variety of groups and justi-
fying—at least in their own minds—a variety of
plots and violent actions.

As terrorism is a constantly evolving phenome-
non, it cannot be addressed through simplistic, all-
purpose solutions. Ethnic-based terrorist ideologies
and activities must be distinguished from religious
or anarchist-based terrorism. Also critical is the
importance of understanding terrorism in the con-
text of insurgencies and avoiding confusion by
treating the two activities as a single phenomenon.

As this chapter has demonstrated, terrorism
thrives in Asia due to a variety of ideological,
functional, and criminal enabling factors. As a
result, effective counterterrorism strategies in the
region must address all of these factors if they are
to be successful. While terrorism in this region
may never be totally eradicated, it can be man-
aged with multilateral approaches and enlight-
ened government actions, some of which are
already in place. However, the
ﬁ
rst step is to
understand the challenge, viewing it from all of
its dimensions.

11.1
History and Politics

Cambodia is a small South East Asian nation bor-
dered by Laos in the north, Vietnam in the east,
Thailand in the west, and the Gulf of Thailand in
the south. During the last 30 years of the twenti-
eth century Cambodians have suffered civil war,
foreign aggression, and genocide. At peace since
1998, its growing and youthful population (60%
are under 25 and 40% are <15 years old) of 13.4
million face problems of development and is one
of the poorest countries in the world, ranking
137th out of 182 countries in 2009 (UNDP
2009
,
p. 145). Most Cambodians (84.3%) reside in rural
areas, many subsisting with less than $1USD a
day. Close to 60% of the remaining 15.7% urban
dwellers reside in the capital Phnom Penh
(National Institute of Statistics
2008
)
. The popu-
lation is 95% Buddhists and Ethnic Khmers. For
centuries the Khmers were ruled by revered God
Kings and most famously during the cultural bril-
liance of the Angkorian period between the 9th
and 13th centuries. Cambodia suffered recurring
territorial and political con
ﬂ
icts with its
Vietnamese and Thai neighbours, until the mod-
ern period when Cambodia was incorporated by
French imperial expansion in Indo-China. In
1863 Cambodia was established as a French
Protectorate, which lasted until independence in
November 1953.

In 1954 Cambodia became a constitutional
monarchy led alternatively as King or Prime
Minister by Prince Norodom Sihanouk. In the
1960s Cambodia was gradually enmeshed in
the complex politics of the cold war and one of
its “hot” manifestations, the civil war in neigh-
bouring Vietnam. In 1970 Sihanouk was ousted
by a coup led by General Lon Nol. Cambodia
was declared a republic and entered a period of
civil war, which was rendered even more
destructive by the heavy and illegal US bomb-
ing targeting Vietcong supply routes inside the
country. This con
ﬂ
ict boosted the popularity
and power base of groups opposed to the Lon
Nol regime, among whom the dominant groups
were royalists and a revolutionary movement
known as the Khmer Rouges led by Pol Pot. In
1975 the Khmer Rouges (KR) defeated the
republican army and entered Phnom Penh. Once
in power, the KR emptied the cities, and estab-
lished a Chinese-backed utopian regime of
agrarian revolutionary terror, which killed
(through starvation and murder) 1.7 million
people and ended in 1979 with a military occu-
pation by the Vietnamese. The Vietnamese army
of occupation installed a socialist regime called
the People’s Republic of Kampuchea (PRK) led
successively and brie
ﬂ
y by a number of former
KR defectors, and six years later by Hun Sen
the current long-serving Prime Minister, him-
self a
former KR defector. In 1989, when

Vietnam withdrew its troops from Cambodia,
the regime was renamed the State of Cambodia
(SOC). Thus in 1979 a second civil war (with
strong nationalist anti-Vietnamese overtones)
commenced. The combatants comprised PRK/
SOC forces supported by Vietnam and the
Soviet Union on one side and on the other side
KR and royalists forces militarily supported by
China and politically by the USA, most western
capitalist countries, and ASEAN nations. In
1991 a United Nations intervention resulted in a
peace settlement known as the Paris Accords
and the establishment of the United Nations
Transitional Authority in Cambodia (UNTAC).

In 1993 UNTAC oversaw the adoption of the
present constitution and implementation of the

ﬁ
rst
free
elections.
The
royalist
party
(FUNCIPEC) won a majority but, in the hope of
preserving a fragile peace between former war-
ring factions, was forced into an inherently
unstable governmental alliance (a joint Prime
Ministership) with the Cambodian People Party
(CPP) led by Hun Sen. This precarious peace
was indeed seriously threatened by armed
clashes between the CPP and royalist forces in
1997 which led to a signi
ﬁ
cant number of casu-
alties and the end of the co-prime ministership
with the defeat of the royalists military capabil-
ity. After the second elections of 1998, the
CPP–FUCINPEC governmental alliance was
eventually reinstated, but with a greatly weak-
ened FUNCIPEC. However, this arrangement
was accompanied by continued periods of polit-
ical uncertainty and violence. Remaining pock-
ets of KR resistance ended in 1998, which also
coincided with the death of Pol Pot. Efforts to
bring to justice the leaders of the KR responsi-
ble for the genocide and atrocities of the revolu-
tionary period have been long delayed by a
government reluctant to disturb pragmatic
arrangements that encouraged defections from
the KR. At the time of writing a tribunal
(jointly established by the United Nations and
the Kingdom of Cambodia and known as
Extraordinary Chambers in the Courts of
Cambodia) of Cambodian and international
jurists has sentenced the former chief of the KR
security police for crimes against humanity and
is preparing charges against the few remaining
ageing leaders of the KR. After four rounds of
national elections in 1993, 1998, 2003, and
2008, the CPP has consolidated its dominance
over government and its leader and Prime
Minister Hun Sen has steadily increased his
control over the country.


11.2
Crime Categories and Patterns

Police crime statistics provided by the Ministry
of Interior (MoI) distinguish between a “Serious
Crime Situation” also referred to as a “Felony”
with four categories: Robbery (threat/non-fatal
and robbery-murder), Murder (successful and
attempted), Terrorism (kidnapping, con
ﬁ
nement,
grenade attack, organised crimes), and Sexual
Offences (rape, rape-murder, human traf
ﬁ
cking);
and a “Minor Crime Situation” also referred to
as a “Misdemeanor” with
ﬁ
ve categories: Theft
(stealing and pickpocketing), Fraud/Breach of
Trust, Battery With Injury, Use Of Illegal
Weapon, and Others. Human Traf
ﬁ
cking, includ-
ing children, for illegal labour and prostitution in
neighbouring countries (e.g. Vietnam and
Thailand), is often cited as a serious criminal
activity. However, there is a scarcity of empirical
research on the extent and dynamics of this ille-
gal trade. In a survey of 18 out of 26 Cambodian
prisons, LICADHO
(

2009

)
found that the num-
ber of people incarcerated for human traf
ﬁ
cking
was 215 in 2007 and 255 in 2008 and that around
80% were women. A recent study (Keo
2011
)
con
ﬁ
rmed this pattern and revealed that most of
these prisoners, particularly women, were poor
and uneducated individuals, many of whom had
been victims of miscarriages of justice at the
hands of a corrupt criminal justice system.

The production, use, and sale of illegal drugs
are a criminal offence in Cambodia, although drug
use appears to be classi
ﬁ
ed as a misdemeanour
and traf
ﬁ
cking as a felony. The same types of
drugs (e.g. heroin, cocaine, cannabis, metham-
phetamines, ecstasy, etc.) as in most Western
countries have been declared illegal. A recent
report by the National Police Commissioner indi-
cates that drug traf
ﬁ
cking (heroin and particularly


169
11 Crime and Justice in Cambodia
methamphetamines) is rising and that “… the
demand for illegal drugs among youth, students,
and other citizens has remarkably increased”. The
report mentions that in 2006 the quantity of heroin
and
methamphetamines
(ice)
traf
ﬁ
cked
to
Cambodia was three times higher than that in
2005. In his January 2007 report, the National
Police Commissioner commented that Cambodia
had been used as a safe haven for the transit and
distribution of illegal drugs from the Golden
Triangle to other countries in the regions (NPC

2008
)
.


11.3
Crime Statistics

Trends in violent crimes have followed the typical
post-con
ﬂ
ict pattern theorised and empirically
tested by Archer and Gartner
(

1976

)
where homi-
cide rates temporarily increase at the end of armed
con
ﬂ
icts and subsequently decline. Table
11.1
presents an overview of the number of crimes
recorded by the police between 1998 and 2009.
For 2009 the rates per 100,000 per crime catego-
ries were the following:

Homicide events 1992–2009 (rates per 100,000 population)

Robbery: 3.15

Robbery-murder: 0.36

Murder: 2.03

Attempted murder: 0.77

Rape: 1.77

Rape-murder: 0.04

Grenade attack (considered lethal): 0.08

Homicide (murder, grenade attacks, robbery-
murder, and rape-murder): 2.52

Assault with injury: 7.19

Theft (ordinary theft from the person, of vehi-
cles, and of livestock, and burglary): 8.07

Fraud: 0.62

Other offences: 1.34

While the rates of robbery, including rob-
bery-murder, have declined since 1992, the
number of robbery-murders is still relatively
high. In rural Cambodia livestock theft is the
most prevalent crime and can have dramatic
consequences for both the victim(s) (i.e. serious
impoverishment) and the offender(s) (i.e. high
risk of being killed by villagers if caught in the
act). Given that more than 80% of the Cambodian
population make a meagre living through farm-
ing activities, this crime affects a large number
of citizens.

Figure
11.1 presents the trends of homicide
rates based on police records from 1992 to 2009.
It should be noted that these rates are based on
homicide events, not homicide victims, and are
therefore lower than the rates that would be cal-
culated on the number of victims, which was not
reliably provided by the police until 2008 (in
2008, 333 and in 2009, 331 homicide events
resulted, respectively, in 347 and 353 deaths). We
also regard the rates of homicide events before
1998, particularly for 1997, which coincided with
a
coup d’etat
, as unreliable police records.



171
11 Crime and Justice in Cambodia

At this stage we need to emphasise that in
Cambodia there is an enormous dark
ﬁ
gure of
crime. The two sweeps of United Nations
International Crime Victim Survey (UNICVS)
revealed that most victims of crime do not report
their victimisation to the police, who in addition
only record a fraction of the reported offences
(Broadhurst

2002,

2006
;
Broadhurst
and
Bouhours
2009
)
. For instance, if we compare the
rates based on police records in 2005 with the
estimated rates based on the UNICVS in Phnom
Penh very large differences are observed. Instead
of a rate of 29 for non-fatal robbery based on
police records a rate of 1,831 per 100,000 is esti-
mated by the UNICVS; for non-fatal rape instead
of 0.7 based on police records a rate of 92 per
100,000 is estimated. Again for assault with
injury instead of 6.5 per 100,000 based on police
records, 1,465 per 100,000 is estimated by the
UNICVS; for all theft (including vehicles, live-
stock, burglary, and pickpocketing) instead of
18.4 per 100,000 based on police records the
UNICVS estimated a rate of 33,700 per 100,000,
and for fraud instead of 0.62 per 100,000, 25,366
per 100,000. The same order of magnitude in the
difference between rates based on police records
and the UNICVS was found in Kandal and
Kampong Cham in 2000 and 2005–2006.

Although actual crime rates are far higher than
the of
ﬁ
cial crime rates, they have dramatically
reduced since 1998. Analyses of press reports
(Broadhurst and Bouhours
2009
)
, interviews
with judicial police (Broadhurst
2002
)
, and hos-
pital data (Wille
2006
) con
ﬁ
rm the declining
trends of the rates of homicide, and the UNICVS
sweeps show a signi
ﬁ
cant decrease in both prop-
erty and violent crime.

11.4
Corruption

Corruption is endemic in Cambodia and affects
many government institutions, non-government
institutions, and businesses. There have been sub-
stantial allegations that corruption within the
Judiciary System is rampant (Linton
2006
, p. 335).
However, street-level corruption by of
ﬁ
cials has
abated since 2000. For instance, two sweeps of
the UNICVS conducted in three provinces in
2000/2001 and 2006/2007 showed that the esti-
mated rates of rent-seeking by of
ﬁ
cials had
reduced from 27.8 to 18.2% in Phnom Penh, and
from 15.6 to 12.9% in Kampong Cham. In the
third province, Kandal, the rates (18.3%) had not
changed. The actual experience of corruption had
also decreased in respect to police (except in
Kandal). In Phnom Penh, the proportion of vic-
tims of police corruption reduced from 10.1% in
2000 to 5.7% in 2005 and represented 31.2% of
all victims of corruption compared to 36.5% in
2000. In Kampong Cham the proportion reduced
from 4.5% in 2000 to 2.5% in 2006 and repre-
sented 20.2% of all victims of corruption com-
pared to 29.1% in 2000. In Kandal, however, the
experience of corruption by police of
ﬁ
cers had
increased from 3.5% in 2000 to 4.4% in 2005 and
represented 24.1% of all victims of corruption
compared to 18.9% in 2000. In the three prov-
inces the most frequently cited offenders by vic-
tims of corruption both in the
ﬁ
rst and second
sweeps
were
elected
commune
of
ﬁ
cials
(Broadhurst and Bouhours
2009
)
. It is more
dif
ﬁ
cult to estimate the extent of corruption by
the elites, but it is clear that many high-ranking
government of
ﬁ
cials have amassed fortunes unre-
lated to their legitimate salaries.

Commercial fraud affecting ordinary consum-
ers is still widespread, although the rates have
signi
ﬁ
cantly declined between 2000 and 2006,
from 39.6 to 25.4% in Phnom Penh, 31.8 to
18.7% in Kandal, and 29.8 to 22.0% in Kampong
Cham (Broadhurst and Bouhours
2009
)
.

11.5
Regional Crime Patterns

As mentioned earlier, the UNICVS shows that
livestock theft is the most prevalent crime in rural
areas. In 2001, in two of the surveyed rural prov-
inces, Kampong Chhnang and Kampong Speu,
the 1-year prevalence rates of livestock theft were
close to 35% and reached 25% in Kampong
Cham. In 2006, the rate had declined to 11% in
Kampong Cham, but was still one of the highest
rates apart from fraud and corruption (Kampong
Chhnang and Kampong Speu were not surveyed


172
R. Broadhurst et al.
in 2006). On the other hand, police statistics show
that rates of homicide tend to be higher in many
rural areas compared to the capital Phnom Penh.

Until 2005, the rate of robbery was signi
ﬁ
cantly
higher in the capital Phnom Penh than in other
provinces. For instance, of all the robberies
recorded nationally by the police over 7 years
(1996–1999 and 2001, 2003, 2005) a third
occurred in Phnom Penh whose population dur-
ing the same period was only about 9.5% of the
national population (hence an average rate of
33.16 per 100,000). However, in 2006 the num-
ber of robberies (including robbery-murders)
recorded in Phnom Penh by the police had
signi
ﬁ
cantly declined to reach a rate of only 14.79
per 100,000, which was lower than the rates in a
few semi-rural and rural provinces (Sihanoukville,
Kong Kep, and Pailin). The UNICVS also
revealed that, although reduced, the prevalence of
robberies as well as “street-level” fraud and cor-
ruption was higher in Phnom Penh than in Kandal
and Kampong Cham. UNICVS (but not police
statistics) showed higher rates of burglary in
Phnom Penh, and both police statistics and
UNICVS showed higher rates of pickpocketing
in Phnom Penh than in rural areas.

11.6
The Legal System

Before the French Protectorate the Cambodian
legal system was essentially a customary law sys-
tem with widespread use of mediation and repa-
ration to settle local disputes and crime (Forest

1979
)
. During the Protectorate an of
ﬁ
cial legal
system patterned after the laws and courts of
France was imposed (hence inquisitorial in rela-
tion to the criminal law), but many cases contin-
ued to be dealt by informal customary practices
(Forest
1979
)
. After the protectorate until 1975,
the of
ﬁ
cial legal system and informal practices in
use during the Protectorate were maintained. The
Khmer Rouge regime of terror (1975–1979)
destroyed the legal system, judicial of
ﬁ
cials were
murdered, and traditional informal mediation
practices were undermined. During the PRK/
SOC regime (1979–1991) a soviet-style legal
system was imported from Vietnam and staffed
according to political allegiance rather than
expertise in the
ﬁ
eld of law and criminal justice.
Many police were trained in Vietnam and Russia,
and focused mostly on internal security and intel-
ligence rather than on law and order and crime
control (Gottesman
2003
)
. Regarded as a security
agency of the government with minimal commit-
ment to civilian peacekeeping, the police and the
whole Criminal Justice System (CJS) had a very
low standing in the community. Recourse to the
formal justice system was rare as people contin-
ued to use traditional mediation and resolution to
deal with crimes and con
ﬂ
icts at the commune
and village level. While a court system, styled as
People Revolutionary Courts, had been re-estab-
lished in May 1980, and formalised by the enact-
ment of the constitution of June 1981, judges and
prosecutors were generally unquali
ﬁ
ed, poorly
educated, and subject to military control (AusAID

2001
)
. There was no independent appellate body.
Any review of verdicts and sentences pronounced
by the courts was thus in the hands of the execu-
tive branch. Further developments, such as the
enactment of the Law Concerning the Organisation
of the Courts and Prosecutors and the establish-
ment of the Institute of Public Administration
and Law (IPAL) in 1982, the People’s Supreme
Court in 1985, or even the new SOC constitution
in 1989, did not bring any signi
ﬁ
cant changes to
the system and its standing in the community.

Since the Paris Accords in 1991, the of
ﬁ
cial
system has remained inquisitorial and is primar-
ily based on a civil law mixture of French-
in
ﬂ
uenced codes from the period of UNTAC,
royal decrees, and acts of the legislature, with
in
ﬂ
uences of customary law and remnants of
communist legal theory. However, most cases
continue to be dealt with informally at the village
or commune level.

11.7
The Criminal Justice System

In addition to a new constitution, 2007 saw the
passage of the Law on Criminal Procedure, which
de
ﬁ
nes the roles and functions of the police,
courts, and prisons. Agencies in the Cambodian
CJS include the MoI, the National Police


173
11 Crime and Justice in Cambodia
Department, the Gendarmerie Militaire, and the
Department of Prisons. The Ministry of Justice
(MoJ) is responsible for the court system, and the
Supreme Council of Magistracy for the manage-
ment of judges and prosecutors.

Some international donors such as the
Australian Government (AusAID) have focused
their aid on rebuilding a legitimate Cambodian
CJS with long-term programs such as the
Cambodian Criminal Justice Assistance Project
(CCJAP). However, in spite of ongoing assistance
many Cambodian people continue to regard the
current CJS as having little legitimacy, because in
the three branches of the system (police, judi-
ciary, and corrections) regime capture (lack of
independence) and corruption are endemic.

11.8
Role of Police

The
Cambodian
Police
comprises
the
Gendarmerie
and the Cambodian National Police (CNP). The
Gendarmerie is primarily a military police force
and does not have the rural policing function that
it generally plays in France and francophone
countries. However, in their 2007 report, CCJAP
(AusAID
2007a,
b
) noted the overlapping of
functions between the CNP and the Gendarmerie:
the latter has become increasingly visible deploy-
ing to district level in rural areas as well as in
towns and cities, performing “national security”
roles. The new Criminal Procedure Law provides
the Gendarmerie with the same powers of arrest
held by the Judicial Police (AusAID
2007a,
b
)
although such powers have long been exercised
by them under the general provision for arrest in
the UNTAC penal code.

The structure of the CNP includes a number
of central departments such as Traf
ﬁ
c, Means,
Training, Scienti
ﬁ
c and Technical, Human
Traf
ﬁ
cking and Child Protection, Public Order
Police, Border Police, Security Police, and
Judicial Police. In all Provinces the CNP struc-
ture is replicated at the various administrative
strata down to the commune level (Police Post).
However, Provincial Commissioners must com-
ply with the national policies and procedures
laid down by the MoI, which is responsible for
salaries and operating expenses, but take direc-
tion from the Deputy Governor (who, in theory
but rarely in practice, is responsible for infra-
structure and other resources) about provincial
policing priorities.

The role of the Judicial Police and its Central
Department of Criminal Police is similar to the
role performed by policing agencies in many
other countries (i.e. mediation, complaint han-
dling, investigation, and arrests). One of the func-
tions of the Scienti
ﬁ
c and Technical Of
ﬁ
ce, under
the control of the Judicial Police, is to record and
classify reported crimes, as well as offenders and

ﬁ
ngerprints. According to the law, Judicial Police
can also act as prosecutors and are often appointed
to conduct investigations, but in this role they
have limited powers of arrest and must seek
authority from a prosecutor. As in most inquisito-
rial systems, the investigating judge appointed to
the case can conduct further inquiries.

However, CCJAP (AusAID
2007a,
b
) points
out that poor training of the police force and the
judiciary often prevents the proper application of
and compliance with the laws of Cambodia. For
instance, many police interrogations end up in
confessions with little supporting evidence. As
part of its regular monitoring of prison conditions
in Cambodia, the Cambodian League for The
Promotion and Defense of Human Rights
[LICADHO]
(
2007
) conducted interviews with
prisoners in 18 prisons, and found that from 1999
to 2006 between 450 and 163 inmates had been
tortured in police custody. However, it is worth
noting that in 1999 reports of torture in police
custody represented 13.7% of the population of
the surveyed prisons but that they have steadily
fallen to represent only 2.1% in 2006, 1.3% in
2007, and 0.7% in 2008.

Other problems, affecting the CNP in general
and the Judicial Police in particular, reported by
CCJAP (AusAID
2007a,
b
) are poor management
and supervision, and lack of strategic planning
and equipment. According to CCJAP (AusAID

2007a,
b
)
, the creation of the Of
ﬁ
ces of Human
Traf
ﬁ
cking and Child Protection under the
responsibility of the Judicial Police is a positive
response, but its effectiveness is impaired by a
“lack of proper de
ﬁ
nition of function, staf
ﬁ
ng


174
R. Broadhurst et al.
requirements, training requirements, and a plan
for how these Of
ﬁ
ces will actually function”.

Decades of con
ﬂ
icts have resulted in an over-
staffed National Police Department, which was
used to absorb demobilised military personnel
with little sense of their civilian mission and the
provision of services to the community. This con-
tributes to a widespread feeling of mistrust,
re
ﬂ
ected for instance in the very low reporting
rates of criminal victimisation to the police
(Broadhurst and Bouhours
2009
)
. Given the level
of corruption in the police (Calavan et al.
2004
)
and in most other institutions, there is also cyni-
cism about impartiality and fair treatment by such
agencies. For instance, it is not rare for the judi-
cial police to seek between 20 and 50% of the
cost of a stolen motorbike up front before they
begin an investigation (AusAID
2007a,
b
)
. While
“street-level” police corruption of this kind has
generally decreased between 2000 and 2007, in
many locations public cynicism about police cor-
ruption has grown despite reductions in its inci-
dence (Broadhurst and Bouhours
2009
)
.

It is dif
ﬁ
cult to obtain reliable information
about the number of CNP in Cambodia. CCJAP
(AusAID
2001

)
estimated more than 65,000
police in 1996 and 64,000 in 2001. There was a
national plan to reduce the 1996 staf
ﬁ
ng by
24,000 in
ﬁ
ve years, but by 2000 the number
appears to have reduced by only 11,630. In 2001,
the Judicial Police had between 8,000 and 9,000
of
ﬁ
cers, but only 800 were female. More recent
estimations (2007) put the CNP number at
70,000. Yet, a report by the National Police
Commissioner (January 2009) indicated that the
total number of the national law enforcement
of
ﬁ
cers as of December 2008 was 55,277 (2,325
females), of which 41,015 (1,428 females) were
based in 24 municipal/provincial police commis-
sariats (NPC
2009


).


11.9
Courts and Procedure

There are 22 courts in Cambodia, one in each
province and one in each of the two municipali-
ties (Phnom Penh and Sihanoukville). There is
also one Appeal Court and one Supreme Court
both located in Phnom Penh. CCJAP (AusAID

2001
) reported that in January 1999, a total of 89
judges, 47 prosecutors, 368 court clerks, and 233
other of
ﬁ
cials were attached to these courts. The
most recent statistics from the Council of Justice
Ministry (CJM) shows that as of May 2006, there
were 167 judges (22 females) and 72 prosecutors
(one female) (CJM
2006
)
.

Before 2001, little training was available for
the magistracy and court clerks; apart from the
legacy of “socialist justice” uncoordinated and
inadequate programs were provided by some
NGOs. Training courses for judges and prosecu-
tors before or after appointment were virtually
non-existent. While some judges had received
university education very few were legally
quali
ﬁ
ed, including the majority of provincial
courts presidents and prosecutors. Even the
President of the Appeal Court was not a quali
ﬁ
ed
lawyer; the only exception was the President of
the Supreme Court, the highest court in Cambodia.
There have also been changes in a number of
Supreme Court judges, increases in the pay of
judges, improved training, and further oversight
of judges by the Council of Magistrates.

11.9.1
Juvenile Justice

There are no separate courts for juveniles in the
Cambodian CJS and juvenile cases are pro-
cessed and eventually heard in provincial courts
in the same way as adults. The law, however,
requires that penalties for juveniles be half of
those for adults and prohibits the detention of
minors less than 13 years old, two rules which
according to LICADHO
(
2007
) the judges nor-
mally apply. Despite the absence of juvenile
courts and separate prisons, no specialist train-
ing in relation to the treatment of juveniles as
victims, witnesses, or offenders is provided to
of
ﬁ
cials in the court system. As there are no
alternatives to imprisonment for minors, in 2008
the latter represented 6.3% of the prison popula-
tion, a rate that has steadily increased since 1999
(3.3%). The same prison rules (e.g. recreation
time) apply for adults and juveniles and no
schooling is provided.

11 Crime and Justice in Cambodia

11.9.2
Rights of the Accused

Although the principle of presumption of

innocence is enshrined in the Cambodian con-
stitution, the way the inquisitorial system is
practiced in Cambodia mostly insures that a
person is presumed guilty by the time he/she
appears before the court. Guilt or innocence
tends to be determined during a pre-trial stage,
which takes place before prosecutors whose
enquiries are not open to the public. The Law
on Criminal Procedure does specify a number
of basic rights for the accused, such as the right
to be informed of the imputed criminal act, the
right to answer or not to answer the investigat-
ing judge without the assistance of a lawyer or
a defender chosen by the accused, the right to
communicate privately with defenders, and the
right to appeal a court decision. However, there
is no provision for the right to remain silent
and to have an attorney present during police
interrogations. There is no trial by jury in
Cambodia, or a right to plead guilty to a lesser
offence. As for a speedy trial, it is not a right
provided to the accused but a provision of the
Law on Criminal Procedure allowing the pros-
ecutor to send an accused direct to trial (i.e.
without relying on the work of the investigat-
ing judge) when the offence is a misdemeanour
incurring a penalty of no more than a year
imprisonment, or a misdemeanour incurring
more than a year imprisonment in the case of
“
ﬂ
agrante delicto” (i.e. when the accused was
caught red-handed in the

act). Whilst article 21
(1) of the UNTAC code stipulates that children
under the age of 13 must not be placed in deten-
tion, there is no age of criminal responsibility
in Cambodia.

Because the CJS and the legal profession
were decimated during the Khmer Rouges dicta-
torship there is a scarcity of trained and compe-
tent lawyers in Cambodia. In theory, and
according to the Law on Criminal Procedure,
from the moment s/he is charged with an offence,
an accused person has the right to be assisted by
a lawyer or a “defender” at every stage of the
legal procedure. Article 76 of the Law on
Criminal Procedure stipulates that the automatic
appointment of a lawyer shall be made by the
presiding judge (other provisions mention the
investigating judge rather than the presiding
judge) in the following cases:

The victim is a minor without defence.
•


The accused person is a minor without defence.

•

The accused person is mute, deaf, blind, or has
•
a mental disorder.


The accused person is not able to afford a

defender.

Funded by the US donors, the Cambodian
Defenders Project (CDP) was set up in the mid
1990s to train a group of defenders whose role
was to represent those accused of crimes in the
court. They formed themselves into an organisa-
tion that now provides legal aid from of
ﬁ
ces in
Phnom Penh and a number of provincial towns. In
2001 it comprised 30 lawyers, 30 supporting staff,
and 17 law interns. According to CCJAP (AusAID

2001

)
, defenders were sometimes regarded with
suspicion by judges, prosecutors, and court clerks
and even forbidden to appear; however, as trained
lawyers they raised the standard of court proce-
dures. Yet, CCJAP (AusAID
2001
) reported that
despite being paid decent salaries, “some of them
have succumbed to the pervading corruption
found in the court system”. Legal Aid of Cambodia
(LAC) was set up shortly after the establishment
of the CDP as the latter split into two distinct
groups. Funded by several European assistance
projects, in 2001 LAC had of
ﬁ
ces in Phnom Penh
and nine provinces and was staffed by 18 lawyers
and 18 legal assistants.

In addition to the CDP and LAC, in 1995 a
statute
established
the
Cambodian
Bar
Association and stipulated that only members of
the association could practice law in Cambodia.
The association, which in 2000 had 216 mem-
bers, includes lawyers in private practice and
those in the legal aid/defender bodies. Although
generally not offering legal services, a number
of NGOs specialised in justice issues (e.g.
Cambodian League for The Promotion and
Defense of Human Rights [aka LICADHO],
Cambodian Human Rights And Development
Association [aka ADHOC], Cambodian Law
and Democracy Project, Cambodian Legal
Resources Development Center, Cambodian

of the rights of victims and accused persons.


11.9.3
Prosecution and Case
Investigation

Because of the legacy of the French protectorate,
particularly in relation to the inquisitorial nature of
the criminal justice procedure, there are a number
of similarities between the prosecution of criminal
cases in France and Cambodia. A notable similar-
ity is the extensive role of the
“juge d’instruction”
(investigating judge). Two distinct, yet closely col-
laborating, groups therefore conduct the prosecu-
tion and investigation of a criminal case:
prosecutors and investigating judges. Each prov-
ince has a public prosecutor department whose
role is to supervise the case brought by the judicial
police. In principle, the usual route for the prose-
cution, investigation, and adjudication of a crimi-
nal case starts with the judiciary police. The latter
receive denunciations or complaints relating to
crimes, misdemeanours, and minor offences,
gather evidence, may decide on the detention of
suspects for a maximum of 48 h, and then make
reports to the prosecutor of the competent jurisdic-
tion. Then the duty of the prosecutor is to immedi-
ately open a judicial inquiry, that is, to make a
charge called “introductory requisition”, which
indicates the offence in accordance with the law,
and, unless it is a
ﬂ
agrante delicto offence (in that
case prosecutors can proceed with the investiga-
tion by themselves), send it to the investigating
judge. According to Article 38 of the Law on
Criminal Procedure, there is at least one judge
responsible for investigating criminal cases in each
provincial court. Investigating judges are given
extensive powers in order to conduct their inquiry.
They may reach different conclusions as to the
charge laid by the prosecutor and must therefore
maintain a close communication with the latter.
When both the investigating judge and the prose-
cutor are satis
ﬁ
ed that there is a case to answer, the
prosecutor refers the case to the competent provin-
cial or municipal “criminal tribunal”. In principle
there is an absolute incompatibility of of
ﬁ
ce
between a trial judge and a representative of the
prosecution department or the investigating judge.

11.9.4
Alternatives and Outcomes
of Prosecution

Due to customary traditions and a profound dis-
trust of the corrupt and costly of
ﬁ
cial judicial
system, most victims do not report crimes to the
police but to village and communes chiefs.
However, village and commune chiefs only play
an informal role in con
ﬂ
ict mediation geared
towards reparation and compensation rather than
a formal prosecuting or investigating function.

Apart from this informal system, which appears
to process and “solve” many cases, there are no
formal alternatives to going to trial, and the of
ﬁ
cial
system does not include provisions such as plea-
bargaining or any kind of medical or other types
of supervised or unsupervised treatment.

The majority of criminal cases, apart from the
most serious ones, are therefore “resolved”
through the informal system. Serious cases go to
trial, in principle following the procedure men-
tioned above (in practice, due to lack of proper
training and corruption, many aspects of this pro-
cedure are not observed). There is no trial by jury;
after hearing the prosecution and the defence, the
presiding judge (or trial judge) decides on guilt or
innocence and, if the accused is judged guilty,
decides the penalty to be imposed.

Incarceration before or awaiting trial is allowed
and regulated by the UNTAC Criminal Code.
Article 14 (4) stipulates that time held in detention
without trial should be no more than four months,
which can be extended to 6 months by a judge with
appropriate reasons given. Article 21 (1) speci
ﬁ
es
that accused persons must be tried no later than
6 months after arrest and that children under the
age of 13 must not be placed in detention, and for
children between the ages of 13 and 18 no more
than one month, which can be doubled if the child
is charged with felony. However, CCJAP (AusAID

2001
) reported that very often the courts do not
comply with these rules and that many accused
persons were kept in detention before trial for lon-
ger periods than required by law.

11 Crime and Justice in Cambodia

Although improvements in judicial training
have occurred, examples of poor procedure and
oversight of police continue. Despite prohibi-
tions under the constitution and procedural law, a
widespread problem is the acceptance of dubi-
ously obtained confessions extracted from sus-
pects under duress by police. The Constitution
prohibits the extraction of involuntary confes-
sion in Article 38 (1993) and Article 321. A
study that monitored criminal cases between
April and June 2007 showed that 124 of 426
defendants complained that they had been
coerced into a confession: 100 of the 124 were
convicted. Police of
ﬁ
cers also misused the per-
mitted 48-h detention period in police custody to
extort confessions. In most cases, defendants
alleged that they were beaten or threatened or
promised release in exchange for a confession.
During the hearing, judges seldom fully consid-
ered defendants’ allegations of coercion or the
legality of the confession (The Center for Social
Development
2007
, p. 7).



11.10
Punishment

Of
ﬁ
cially, degrading treatments such as corporal
and public punishment are not allowed in
Cambodia. Fines and prison are the most com-
mon types of punishments imposed by the courts.
According to CCJAP (AusAID
2007a,
b
)
, there is
a lack of alternatives to imprisonment. Non-
custodial sentences are limited to
ﬁ
nes, suspended
sentences, and conditional release. There are no
legal provisions for community work orders,
supervised probation, and parole systems
(APCCA
2007
)
. The courts can also impose rep-
arations and compensation, but their greatest use
probably occurs in the informal system.

11.10.1
Punishment for Serious Crime

11.10.1.1
Murder

Capital punishment has been abolished in
Cambodia since 1989 and no legal executions
have taken place since then. Nevertheless, the
law imposes heavy penalties of imprisonment for
serious crime. Limited details about the length of
prison sentences are provided by the MoI. Article
31 of the Criminal Code stipulates imprisonment
for a term of 10–20 years for murder.

11.10.1.2
Rape

Article 33 speci
ﬁ
es a prison sentence of
5–10 years, which cannot be suspended (but can,
under article 68, be reduced by half for offenders
under 18). However, according to LICADHO
(O’Connell
2001
, p.49) judges often apply the
law “incorrectly and inconsistently, giving con-
victed rapists suspended sentences when the law
prohibits it”.


11.10.1.3
Theft, Burglary, and Robbery

The Criminal Code classi
ﬁ
es burglary as robbery.
Article 34 stipulates a prison term of 6 months to
5 years for theft depending on the circumstances:
for robbery a prison term of 3–10 years that varies
according to the amount of force or weapon
used.


11.10.1.4
Drug Traf
ﬁ
cking

According to Article 98, personal consumption,
and production for the unique purpose of per-
sonal consumption, of any of the prohibited
drugs is punished by a
ﬁ
ne ranging from US$25
to US$250. Article 36 stipulates that the offence
of selling or providing any of these drugs to a
person for his/her personal consumption “shall
be punished to imprisonment from 1 month to
1 year and with a
ﬁ
ne from 1,000,000 (about
US$ 250) to 5,000,000 Riels (about US$ 1,250)
or one of the two penalties”. Article 86 provides
a more severe penalty of one year to
ﬁ
ve years in
prison and with a
ﬁ
ne of about US$2,470 if the
drugs are made available to minors. Any other
drug offences for the eventual intentional pur-
pose of traf
ﬁ
cking incur a penalty from
ﬁ
ve to
twenty years imprisonment with
ﬁ
nes up to
50,000,000 Riels (about US$12,500). Long
prison terms and heavy
ﬁ
nes are therefore pre-
scribed by the criminal code and it seems that
these long prison sentences are indeed often
in
ﬂ
icted. Travel advisories of various foreign
governments warn travellers of the severe prison
sentences for drug traf
ﬁ
cking.

11.11
Prisons

Table
11.2 presents the trends in prison popula-
tion between 1995 and 2008. During the last
14 years the estimated rates of imprisonment
have escalated signi
ﬁ
cantly from 24.2 to 83.6 per
100,000. The estimated proportions of female
prisoners have ranged between 4.7% in 1995 and
6.4% in 2006 of the prison population (about
5.6% in 2008). As reported earlier, between 1999
and 2008, the proportions of incarcerated juve-
niles have risen from 3.3% to 6.3% of the prison
population. The number of institutional staff
which was 1,122 in 1995 has only increased to
1,661 in 2008. The ratio staff/inmate has there-
fore declined from 1/2.2 to 1/6.7.


In 2008, 26 prisons (3 national and 23 provin-
cial/municipal prisons) operated in Cambodia,
with a capacity ranging from 100 to over 1,200
detainees (LICADHO
2009
)
. The Department of
Prisons’ headquarters is located in the MoI in
Phnom Penh. Two of the national prisons, CCI and
CCII, are situated 12 km (7.5 miles) from Phnom
Penh, and CCIII near the Vietnamese border. Most
Cambodian prisons are overcrowded. In its survey
of 18 prisons, LICADHO
(
2007
) reported a hous-
ing capacity for 6,410 prisoners, but in 2004 these
prisons in average operated at 123% and in 2006 at
138% of their capacity. In CCI, which is consid-
ered to be one of the better prisons compared to
provincial facilities, between 22 and 25 men may
share a cell that is about 64 square metres (688.90
square feet). Since 1999, CCII houses only female
and juvenile prisoners. In 2006, 256 females and
285 juveniles as well as 14 babies and infants liv-
ing with their mothers in prison were incarcerated
at CCII (operating at 155% of its capacity). CCII is
the only facility of this sort in Cambodia. All the
other prisons, apart from the all-adult male CCI,
house both male and female prisoners in more or
less well-separated quarters.

11 Crime and Justice in Cambodia

In addition to overcrowding, health problems
are frequent in Cambodian prisons. The Prisons
Department is allocated only 1,500 riels (USD
0.38) per prisoner per day to cover the cost of not
only feeding the prisoners but also transportation,
sanitation, cooking fuel, water, electricity, and
administration. According to LICADHO
(
2007
)
,
the daily nutritional requirements stipulated in
article 4.1 of Prison Procedure would cost, even
using the lowest quality ingredients, at least 1,700
Riels in the Phnom Penh Market. Because of
widespread corruption in the prison system,
inmates with enough money can purchase nutri-
tious meals while many others are malnourished
and suffer from poor health. The number of
deaths in the prisons monitored by LICADHO

(
2007
) varied from 43 in 2002 to 100 in 2005,
that is, between 0.7 and 1.2% of the prison popu-
lation. Since 2005, deaths in custody have
declined from 69 in 2006, 57 in 2007, to 39 in
2008 (from 0.76 to 0.37% of the prison popula-
tion). The highest rates of death in custody
occurred in provincial facilities. Prison escapes
are common. In its survey, LICADHO
(
2007
)
reported 72 escapees in 2005 and 53 in 2006
(respectively, 0.87 and 0.60% of the population
of the 18 surveyed prisons). Most of them
involved group escapes. In 2005 and 2006,
respectively, 25 and 23% of these escapees were
killed during their attempts, and only 31 and 45%
were recaptured (i.e. 44% in 2005 and 32% in
2006 were successful escapes).

Correction Center I (CCI) is a new prison, one
of the only three prisons under the direct man-
agement of the General Department of Prisons,
and the largest correctional facility in Cambodia
with a capacity for 1,500 prisoners. Built on
10 ha CC1 houses only adult male prisoners. Like
most Cambodian prisons, CCI is overcrowded
and in 2006, with 2,132 inmates, it operated at
142% of its maximum capacity and employed
more than 150 staff (LICADHO
2007
)
. Although
security in CCI is exceptionally tight, in June
2006 a group of 12 prisoners managed to escape
and only one of them was recaptured. The num-
ber of deaths in custody was 17 in 2002, 13 in
2003, 22 in 2004 (1.4% of CCI population), 18 in
2005, 11 in 2007, and 6 in 2008 (in 2006, CCI did
not
provide information on prison deaths to
LICADHO).

The prison employs an administrative system
that centralises all decisions in the hand of the
wardens. Of
ﬁ
cially, family visits are on every
Saturday and public holidays from 7:30 am to
10:30 am and 2:00 pm to 4:00 pm. While Prison
Procedure (No 8, Article 4.1 [n]) “… expressly
forbids the collection of goods or money from
visitors by any prison of
ﬁ
cial for the privilege of
visiting a prisoner” and stipulates that “all pris-
oners have the right to receive visits from fami-
lies or friends for at least one hour each week at
times designated in the prison rules by the prison
chief”, in CCI the no-fee rule seems to be
respected only during of
ﬁ
cial family visit days.
Thanks to corruption it is possible to visit prison-
ers any day but visitors have to pay a fee of at
least 5,000R ($USD1.25). The places where the
visits occur and the privileges accorded during
the visits also depend on the amount of bribes
visitors are willing or can afford to pay. No pay-
ment is required if the visit happens via a phone
in a room where visitors and prisoners are sepa-
rated by glass and iron bars. In another room,
where they are only separated by iron bars and
can touch each other, a payment of between
10,000R ($USD2.5) and 40,000R ($USD10) is
necessary.
1 A “gold-class” visit area, away from
the inner core of the prison where cells are
located, allows visitors and prisoners to sit
together on a concrete lounge, but for this privi-
lege visitors have to pay a minimum of $USD10.
Unlike many other Cambodian prisons, and
despite a level of overcrowding that often results
in more than 20 inmates having to share a 64
square meters cell, CCI only allows prisoners to
go out of their cells for a short period of time
once a week or fortnight. However, prisoners
who can bribe of
ﬁ
cials are allowed to leave their
cells everyday for a long period of time to do
work around the interior compound.

In 2001, CCJAP (AusAID
2001
) mentioned
plans to assist in the development of vocational

1 Many Cambodian workers such as constructions work-
ers, school teachers, and police of
ﬁ
cers earn less than

R. Broadhurst et al.
training, literacy, and numeracy programs for
detainees. Some of these programs may have
been implemented in the prison located in the site
where CCJAP has focused its attention, but in the
main, as reported in 2003 by the 23rd Asian and
Paci
ﬁ
c Conference of Correctional Administrators
“[n]o formalised programs exist within prisons
for the rehabilitation of prisoners to return to
society at the end of their sentence”. Between
November and December 2007, one of the co-
authors visited seven major Cambodian prisons
and found that most of them did not have work-
shops, and when they did, these workshops were
small and did not provide any signi
ﬁ
cant skills,
mainly sewing for females, and carpentry and
gardening for males. While generally inmates are
not of
ﬁ
cially required to work, an informal trade
system exists where there are many jobs that can
be done by prisoners for prison staff or other pris-
oners in exchange of money, food, or privileges.

Two other privileges include prison transfer
and reduction of prison terms. An of
ﬁ
cial reason
for prisoners requesting a prison transfer is to be
close to their homeland and make family visits
more convenient. Because prison conditions,
such as building environment and rules, vary
greatly in Cambodia, unof
ﬁ
cial reasons would
include moving to a better facility. The transfer
process requires approval from the heads of the
relevant prisons and the General Director of the
Prison Directorate. The payment of bribes would
expedite this process.

Normally, each prison has a committee chaired
by the warden, which monitors and reviews pris-
oners’ behaviour and performance and can pro-
pose a sentence reduction or abolition. By law,
the committee must submit such request to the
king. For prisoners sentenced up to a year maxi-
mum the request can be made after half the sen-
tence has been served, and for those sentenced to
more than a year, after at least two-thirds has
been served. This privilege provides ample
opportunities for corrupt conduct, as members of
prison committees, especially wardens, can make
signi
ﬁ
cant income from relatively wealthy pris-
oners who in exchange would be proposed for a
sentence reduction. Many more “unof
ﬁ
cial” priv-
ileges in relation to cell allocation, treatment by
prison guards, food rations, relative freedom
within the prison, recreation, opportunity to make
money, and sex are available for those who can
pay their way in the corrupt prison system. A
prisoner transfer agreement was signed with
Australia in October 2006. At the same date no
such agreement existed with the UK. The
Cambodian Government also signed an extradi-
tion agreement with Thailand in 1999, China in
2000, and Laos in 2005.

Introduction

This chapter is a brief introduction of crime and
criminal justice in Hong Kong. Since the 1960s,
Hong Kong has experienced fast economic
growth and modernization, earning the interna-
tional acclaim of “the Pearl of the East.” The
availability of both cheap labour and industrial
entrepreneurs, who mostly migrated from main-
land China to Hong Kong before the Communist
takeover in 1949, had brought about the success
of Hong Kong as an export processing zone in the
1960s and 1970s. As China began its economic
reform in the 1980s, many of the manufacturing
industries in Hong Kong were attracted to move
to the mainland, where labour cost and the infra-
structure of production were a lot cheaper. There
was the need for Hong Kong’s economy to trans-
form itself by developing its
ﬁ
nance and service
sectors. Since the 1980s, Hong Kong has estab-
lished itself to be one of the most important

ﬁ
nancial centres in the world.

The world has been watching not only Hong
Kong’s economic success. How its political land-
scape might change after the handover on July 1,
1997, had started to become an international
focus back in the 1980s. After over a century of
colonial rule by the British, Hong Kong’s social
and political institutions are very different from
those in mainland China. Whether China would
keep its promise that Hong Kong would remain
unchanged in all aspects for 50 years was any-
one’s guess. Now that 15 years have passed since
the return of sovereignty, many people are still
debating whether Hong Kong has been able to
enjoy a truly free hand in managing its own
affairs, or has been subject to China’s covert or
overt control.

Against this background, an interesting social
issue to examine is crime and criminal justice in
Hong Kong. Developed on the basis of the com-
mon law of the British, the criminal justice sys-
tem in Hong Kong is perhaps one of the best
indicators of the degree of autonomy that Hong
Kong can exercise in the post-1997 period. In this
paper, we give an overview of the criminal justice
system in Hong Kong established since colonial
administration, and brie
ﬂ
y discuss the challenges
in the post-1997 period.

Equally important in the discussion of crime
and criminal justice in a society is the issue of
measurement of crime. Since crimes feed them-
selves to the criminal justice system, the amount
and characteristics of crime affect the work of the
system. Thus, in this paper, we
ﬁ
rst discuss how
crime information is collected by the major com-
ponents of the criminal justice system in Hong
Kong. Crime statistics of criminal justice depart-
ments are of
ﬁ
cial crime data. We also describe
some of the unof
ﬁ
cial sources of crime data, as
unof
ﬁ
cial statistics are complementary to of

ety. After this section, we describe the major fea-
tures of the criminal justice system in Hong
Kong, and discuss its changes since 1997 and the
new challenges ahead.

12.2

Counting Crime Of
ﬁ
cially and
Unof
ﬁ
cially

Crime is perhaps the most elusive phenomenon
in society. It is very much an integral part of the
society that we live in. At varying degrees, crime
and victimization are part of the daily lives of
most citizens. The very presence of law enforce-
ment, judiciary, and correctional departments is a
commitment of our society to combating and pre-
venting crime. In most media, crime appears as
the most persistent content of daily reports and
commentaries. Although crime and its societal
reactions are everywhere, we do not actually have
clear and simple answers to these questions: How
much crime is there in society? What are the
major types of crime? How serious is the crime
problem? How has the pattern of crime changed
over time? There seems to be no shortage of
information about crime in society, since it is
abundant in personal accounts, criminal justice
departments, and media reports. However, how
accurate are the various sources of information
about crime in representing the actual amount of
crime in society? Moreover, despite the plurality
of information about crime, how the public per-
ceive the crime problem is shaped mainly by the
selective reporting of crime in the media. The
“fear of crime,” as criminologists have demon-
strated, is a dominant trait of the public percep-
tion of crime, and it persists regardless of the
actual extent of crime and its vicissitudes in soci-
ety (Garofalo
1979
)
.

If the public perception of crime is not an
accurate barometer of the actual extent of crime
in society, the crime situation must be under-
stood by making reference to sources of system-
atically collected data on crime. Broadly
speaking, crime data can be divided into two
types, with regard to the nature of the organiza-
tion that collects the data. Of
ﬁ
cial crime data
are data collected by criminal justice and related
departments of the government, which include
the Hong Kong Police Force, the Independent
Commission
Against
Corruption
(ICAC),
Customs and Excise Department, the judiciary,
and the Correctional Services Department. Law
enforcement departments, especially the police,
are at the forefront of handling crime, and hence
their records contain rich records of different
kinds of offences in society. One of the major
drawbacks of of
ﬁ
cial statistics is that they would
miss offenders, and the crimes they commit, that
are not brought to the attention of law enforce-
ment agencies. Many crimes are not reported to
the police, and this “dark
ﬁ
gure” (Coleman and
Moynihan
1996

)
has a lot to do with factors
such as the willingness of citizens to report
crime to the police, and the size of the police
manpower (O’Brien
1996
)
.

Unof
ﬁ
cial crime data are data collected by
non-government organizations, such as private
security
ﬁ
rms, social service agencies, and aca-
demic/research institutions. Compared with
police statistics, which are comprehensive data
covering many different kinds of offence,
unof
ﬁ
cial crime data are usually collected for
special purposes. For example, private security

ﬁ
rms collect information on incidents of break-in
and damage to property. Voluntary drug treat-
ment agencies have information on drug abusers
and their patterns of drug use.

Academic or professional researchers study
crimes and criminals according to their research
interests or those of respective institutions. Many
of the studies conducted by these researchers are
in the form of surveys, involving either house-
holds or a speci
ﬁ
c sector of the population (e.g.
secondary school students). Due to the sensitive
nature of topics on crime and deviance, the self-
report method using a standardized and anony-
mous questionnaire is commonly used in the data
collection of surveys. The anonymity of this
method can facilitate more reliable answers of
respondents

ﬁ
lling
out
the
questionnaire.
However, this method can only collect data per-
taining to milder and more trivial forms of devi-
ance rather than serious crimes (Livingston
1992
,
pp. 102–103).

12 Crime and Criminal Justice in Hong Kong

As there are both strengths and weaknesses
with of
ﬁ
cial and unof
ﬁ
cial crime data, the two
types of data should be considered as comple-
mentary to each other rather than mutually exclu-
sive. Since each of them uses a different approach
to counting crime, no single source of data can
give us a comprehensive picture of the crime situ-
ation in society. The more sources of data we use,
the fuller will be the picture we can get. We now
examine major examples of of
ﬁ
cial and unof
ﬁ
cial
crime data.

12.2.1
Of
ﬁ
cial Crime Data

Sources of of
ﬁ
cial data described in this chapter
include criminal justice units of the government,
namely, the Hong Kong Police Force, ICAC,
Customs and Excise Department, Judiciary, and
Correctional Services Department. Over the
years, the government has also conducted several
victimization surveys. In addition, due to the
growing public concern over increasing incidence
of family violence since the late 1990s, the Social
Welfare Department has established the Child
Protection Registry and Central Information
System on Battered Spouse Cases and Sexual
Violence Cases for keeping a better record of
reported domestic violence.

12.2.1.1
Hong Kong Police

As in other cities, statistics of the Hong Kong
Police Force are the most widely used of
ﬁ
cial
crime data in Hong Kong. Despite the fact that a
lot of crimes are not reported to the police, “crime
known to the police” still represents the richest
source of of
ﬁ
cial data on crime. Crimes in police
statistics are grouped into different categories,
and once in a while categories may be revised or
new categories created in response to current sit-
uations. The present classi
ﬁ
cation scheme is
shown in Table
12.1
.

How are crimes counted in Hong Kong? The
rules for counting crimes may differ across coun-
tries and time. The latest rules adopted by the
Hong Kong police are based on four principles as
follows (Hong Kong Police
2007
, pp. 2–3; see
also Cheung and Cheung
2009
)
:

1.
For violent crime against person (e.g. murder,
wounding, rape, indecent assault), one crime
will be counted for each victim.



Example
: A gang attacks four men with weap-
ons. One man is killed and the other three are
injured. One offence of murder and three
offences of wounding will be counted. The
number of offenders is not relevant.

2.
For crime against property or public order
(e.g. robbery, burglary, snatching, shop theft,
theft from vehicle, and taking conveyance
without authority), one crime will be counted
for each distinct incident.



Example
: Two men rob a bank, and during the
operation, ten customers inside the bank are
also robbed. One offence of robbery will be
counted, regardless of the number of victims.

3.
For crime which is considered as a continuous
offence if repeated (e.g. blackmail, claiming
to be member of an unlawful society, decep-
tion, and theft by employees from their
employers), one crime will be counted for
each offence or a series of similar offences
committed by the same offender(s) involving
the same victim(s).



Example
: Three men blackmailed a person for
money ten times during the past 3 months.
One offence of blackmail will be counted,
regardless of the number of times repeated.

4.
For crime associated with other naturally con-
nected offences, those offences which are
naturally connected with the more serious
crime will not be counted statistically.



Example
: A man is arrested for attempting to
steal something valuable from a vehicle. He has
broken the window of the vehicle and is also
found in possession of a spanner, a chisel, and a
screwdriver. One offence of theft from vehicle
will be counted. No offence will be counted for
criminal damage of window and possession of
instruments for unlawful purposes.

Statistics on crime reported to the police can
be found in
Hong Kong Police Review
, published
annually by the Hong Kong Police Force. Crime
data reported in the annual review include not
only the number of reported offences in each of
the various categories of crime as shown in
Table
12.1 but also the distribution of offences in


186
Y.W. Cheung and N.W.T. Cheung
sex, age, district, and other socio-demographic
groups. The corresponding detection rates of the
crimes are also indicated.

One of the bene
ﬁ
ts of annual statistics is the
availability of trend data for overall and speci
ﬁ
c
crimes over a period of time. Table
12.2 gives an
example of the changes in the number of violent
offences as compared to the total number of
crimes in the past 25 years (1986–2010). When
the total population is taken into account, the
crime rate (number of offences per 100,000 pop-
ulation) for violent crime and that for total num-
ber of crimes can be calculated.

In Table
12.2
, a similarity between the violent
crime rate and the total crime rate can be noticed.
The violent crime rate was 243 per 100,000 pop-
ulation in 1986, steadily rising to over 300 in
1989, and peaked at 336 in 1991. It began to drop
to 294 in 1993, and has been steadily decreasing
to 218 in 2000, and remained just slightly more
than 200 in the late 2000s. It even dropped to 192
in 2010. The total crime rate also increased since
the mid-1990s (1,384 per 100,000 population in
1986), reaching its peak in 1991 (1,523). Since
then, it has been declining, and in the 2000s, it
has remained only slightly over 1,000.

Violent crimes are divided into violent crime
against person and violent crime against property.
The trend of number of offences of these two types
of crime has varied over the years. The number of
violent crime against person has increased from
7,879 in 1986 to 9,629 in 1989, and risen to 10,177
in 1995. Since then, it has
ﬂ
uctuated between
9,000 and 11,000 until 2005, but has
ﬁ
rmly
remained over 11,000 until today. The opposite
trend is found in violent crime against property.
Although it has also started to increase from 6,424
in 1986 to its peak of 10,414 in 1991, it has con-
tinuously decreased afterwards. It has dropped by
half by 1996 (5,241), and further reached the ever
smallest number of 1,703 in 2010.

Like police statistics everywhere, crime data
collected by the Hong Kong police should be


188
Y.W. Cheung and N.W.T. Cheung
interpreted with caution. They are, genuinely,
“crimes known to the police,” which necessarily
cannot include those crimes that are not known to
them. A host of factors may contribute to this
“dark
ﬁ
gure of crime.” First, some crimes are not
reported to the police because of a range of rea-
sons, including the offence being too trivial to the
victim, the low detection rate of the police for the
particular type of crime, the victim’s intension to
conceal delinquent behaviours such as rape and
drug abuse, the victim’s unawareness of the
occurrence of the crime, and the lack of public
visibility such as white-collar crimes (Hagan

1985
, p. 95). Second, some crimes reported to the
police are not recorded (Hood and Sparks
1970
,
p. 35). Sometimes citizens are not able to give an
accurate account of the particular offence, mak-
ing it dif
ﬁ
cult for the police to take follow-up
action. The police sometimes encounter citizens
who claim that they have been victimized by a
crime, but the circumstances do not lead to the
conclusion that a crime has occurred. Third, as
there is discretion in police work, police of
ﬁ
cers
might choose not to record a reported crime
because they thought that the crime was too
minor, or even because they were too busy
(Cheung and Cheung
2009
, p. 41).

12.2.1.2
The ICAC

The mission of the ICAC, which was founded in
1974, is to address the corruption problem in
Hong Kong. It is a government unit functionally
independent of other law enforcement depart-
ments and accountable directly to the governor
(Lo
1994
)
. The work of the Operations Department
of ICAC is to investigate and prosecute alleged
corruption cases in both public and private sec-
tors under the Prevention of Bribery Ordinance,
the Independent Commission Against Corruption
Ordinance, and the Elections (Corrupt and Illegal
Conduct) Ordinance. The total number of corrup-
tion cases reported to ICAC in selected years is
presented in Table
12.3
.


Since the beginning of ICAC’s operation, the
total number of reported cases (excluding elec-
tion-related reports) had drastically decreased
from 3,189 in 1974 to 1,234 in 1978, showing
that ICAC had made an impact on the society.
The number began to rise to more than 2,000 in
the 1980s. By the 1990s, it had increased to over
3,000, reaching its peak of 4,371 in 2002. It then
dropped back to 3,339 in 2006, and remained
about the same until 2010.

The increase of the total number of reported
cases since the early 2000s has been due to the
increase in the number of reported cases related
with private sector and public bodies. The num-
ber of reported cases related to the private sector
was well below 2,000 before the 2000s, but it
reached 2,403 in 2002 and has remained over
2,000 since then. A similar pattern is found in the
number of reports related to public bodies, which
reached 330 in 2002 and has remained over 200
until 2010. On the contrary, the number of reports
related to government departments has been
fairly stable. It dropped from 1,638 in 2002 to
1,068 in 2006, and remained at about 1,000
thereafter.

Not all corruption offences are reported, as the
public’s willingness to report
ﬂ
uctuates over
time, and some corruption behaviours are suc-
cessfully concealed. Some reported offences are
not pursuable. For example, in 2010, the total
number of corruption reports was 3,427. However,
the number of pursuable reports was 2,663, which
is 77.7% of the total number of reports (ICAC

2010
, p. 35). Also, some offenders are not pros-
ecuted, as a caution may be issued for minor
offences, particularly when it is not in the public
interest to prosecute. For example, in 2010, 393
persons were prosecuted and 30 formally cau-
tioned (ICAC
2010
, p. 38).

12.2.1.3
Customs and Excise Department

The Customs and Excise Department has a
diversity of responsibilities ranging from anti-
smuggling, protection and collection of revenue
on dutiable commodities, detection and deter-
rence of narcotics traf
ﬁ
cking and drug abuse,
safeguarding of intellectual property rights and
consumer interests, protection and facilitation
of legitimate trade and industry to uphold Hong
Kong’s trading integrity, and ful
ﬁ
lment of inter-
national obligations. Crime statistics recorded
by this department pertain to violations of
ordinances relevant to these responsibilities.
In 2011, the department prosecuted 3,595
cases (a case involving a number of ordinances

2011. A total of 3,836 persons and 397 compa-
nies were prosecuted, which resulted in total

ﬁ
nes upon offenders of HK$15.9 million and
the imposition of immediate imprisonment in
947 cases (Customs and Excise Department

2011
, p. 67
).

Like the Police, the Customs and Excise
Department’s priorities of enforcement work are
sometimes affected by public concern over cer-
tain crimes. For example, infringement of copy-
right and psychoactive drug abuse in young
people have become two of the biggest public
concerns in recent years. The department has
stepped up actions to monitor and crack down the
sale of counterfeit goods and the traf
ﬁ
cking of
psychoactive drugs such as ketamine and ecstasy.
This boosts the number of arrests, although it
does not necessarily mean that the actual number
of such crimes has also increased.

12.2.1.4
Judiciary

The Judiciary is responsible for the adminis-
tration of justice in Hong Kong. It hears all
prosecutions and civil disputes. It is completely
independent of the executive and legislative
branches of the Government (Judiciary

2011
)
.

The Judiciary publishes the
Hong Kong
Judiciary Annual Report each year. The annual
report covers the work of the Court of Final
Appeal, High Court (Court of Appeal and Court
of First Instance), District Court, Magistrates’
Courts, Tribunals (Lands, Labour, Small Claims,
and Obscene Articles), and Specialized Court
(Coroner’s
Court).
Statistical
information
reported is mainly about caseloads, case dispos-
als, and waiting time for the cases of various
courts. There is no mention of offence, convic-
tion, or sentencing.

Data on offence and sentencing had been
included in some of the previous reports. Starting
in 1989, comprehensive offence and sentencing
of all courts were recorded in annual reports.
However, information on offence and punish-
ment delivered began to be limited to magistrates’
courts in 1994. Annual reports of 1996–1999 did
not give information on offence and punishment
for magistrates’ courts any more, but recorded
the number of persons prosecuted and convicted
instead. Beginning in 2000, data on offence, sen-
tencing, and number of people prosecuted and
convicted were not included in annual reports.

Now, access to such data must be sought through
special requests.

12.2.1.5
Correctional Services
Department

As the
ﬁ
nal part of the criminal justice system,
the Correctional Services Department (CSD)
receives individuals into its varied institutions
(prisons, detention centres, training centres, reha-
bilitation centres, and Drug Addiction Treatment
Centre), while some basic data regarding admis-
sion numbers, socio-demographic characteristics
of prisoners/inmates, types of offence, etc. can be
found in the Department’s
Annual Reviews
.

Since CSD is an integral part of the criminal
justice system, admission
ﬁ
gures are highly cor-
related with police crime data. The greater the
number of offences known to the police, the
greater will be the number of prosecutions, which,
in turn, results in more admissions to CSD’s insti-
tutions. In Table
12.4
, police statistics on the total
number of reported crime and admission num-
bers of CSD institutions are compared for selected
years in the period from 1991 to 2010.


Although the comparison between police sta-
tistics and CSD admission data is only a crude
one, as the processing of crime from arrest to sen-
tencing may take more than a year, Table
12.4
clearly suggests a positive relationship between
the total number of crimes reported to the police
and the number of admissions to CSD facilities.
In the selected years between 1991 and 2010,
there were only two years when CSD admissions
did not increase or decrease correspondingly to
police data. Despite this high correlation, CSD
admission statistics are also affected by many
factors, including police priorities in laying
charges for certain type of offence, the tendency
of the courts to deliver heavier or lighter sen-
tences, and the capacity and manpower of CSD
institutions.

12.2.1.6
Victimization Surveys

Victimization surveys have become a popular
method of collecting crime data worldwide. In
Hong Kong, seven crime victimization surveys
(CVSs) have been conducted since the late 1970s
(1979, 1982, 1987, 1990, 1995, 1999, and 2006).
These surveys were conducted by the Census and
Statistics Department under the auspices of the
Fight Crime Committee, a government advisory
body that provides recommendations on mea-
sures to prevent and reduce crime. The objective
of CVS is not only to provide information on
crime victimization but also to examine the extent
to which the public was willing to report crime to
the police. The extent of under-reporting to the
police can roughly be used to estimate the size of
the “dark
ﬁ
gure” of crime.

As in previous CVSs, the 2006 survey adopted
a household survey design that involved the inter-
view of all household members aged 12 and over
in sampled households. A total of 24,272 house-
holds were selected, and 20,075 households were
interviewed (Census and Statistics Department

2007
, p. 147). Information on the victimization
of both the person interviewed and the household
was collected. Comparisons of victimization data

191
12 Crime and Criminal Justice in Hong Kong
and police statistics on speci
ﬁ
c crimes reveal the
discrepancies between these two sources of crime
information. Some discrepancies are bigger, and
others are smaller. For example, the number of
indecent assault for 2005 as indicated in the 2006
CVS was 13,800, whereas the number of inde-
cent assault reported to the police for the same
year was 1,136, which was only 8.2% of the CVS

ﬁ
gure. Deception is another example of low
reporting rate. The CVS showed 17,100, but the
number of reported cases was 1,400, only 8.1%.
For offences that are more likely to involve the
police, the discrepancy between the two sets of
data is understandably smaller. In CVS, the num-
ber of wounding and assault for 2005 was 17,500,
whereas the reported number was 6,800, which is
38.8%. Vehicles are under strict registration, and
so theft of vehicle is more likely to be reported.
CVS showed that for 2005, there were 1,700 vic-
timizations of theft of vehicles. The number of
reported cases of theft of vehicle was 1,500,
which is 88%. Among all the victimizations
shown in the CVS, the overall reporting rate was
only 19.1% (Census and Statistics Department

2007
, p. 100).

There are limits as to how much the CVS and
police data can be directly compared. Data col-
lected in CVS are limited to crimes against the
person and crimes against property. The sample
of CVS would exclude people who are not living
in residential households at the time of the sur-
vey. Despite these and other limitations, CVS can

ﬁ
ll many of the gaps in police statistics by its
ability to indicate people’s willingness to report
crime and offer rich information about the crime
and crime scene, and the possible social relation-
ship between the offender and the victim.

12.2.1.7
Other Of
ﬁ
cial Statistics

Besides the above-mentioned law enforcement
departments, other government units also keep
records of incidents of crime and deviance that
occur in connection with the operation of these
units. For example, the Narcotics Division of the
Security Bureau is active in gathering informa-
tion pertaining to drug abuse and its associated
factors for the facilitation of anti-drug strategies
and drug treatment programmes. Drug abuse data
are collected from two mechanisms, namely, the
Central Registry of Drug Abuse database and stu-
dent surveys. The central registry is a database
that provides relevant drug statistics on drug
abuse patterns and trends. It is based on a net-
work of more than 60 reporting agencies, which
include law enforcement departments, drug treat-
ment agencies, social welfare agencies, tertiary
institutions, hospitals, and clinics (Cheung and
Ch’ien
1996
)
. The Narcotics Division also com-
missions research organizations to conduct stu-
dent surveys to
ﬁ
nd out the prevalence and
associated factors of drug use of secondary stu-
dents. Altogether seven surveys have thus far
been conducted, in 1987, 1990, 1992, 1996, 2000,
2004, and 2008/2009 (Narcotics Division
2010
)
.

The Labour Department has the most detailed
records of incidents of labour disputes, violations
of safety regulations in workplace, and other
work-related offences. The Education Bureau
(formerly, Education and Manpower Bureau)
would have information about the occurrence of
student bullying, thefts, and other delinquent
behaviours in schools. The Social Welfare
Department has, since the mid-1990s, set up a

Child Protection Registry to systematically record
information on newly reported and at-risk cases
of child abuse, and the
Central Information
System on Battered Spouse Cases and Sexual
Violence Cases to record spousal aggression
cases (Social Welfare Department
2007
)
. Crimes
committed by corporations, which are not readily
available in police or ICAC statistics, can be
obtained from a variety of sources, including the
Securities
and
Futures
Commission,
the
Environmental Protection Department, the Urban
and Regional Council, the Consumer Council,
etc. (Cheung and Cheung
2009
, p. 48).

12.2.2
Unof
ﬁ
cial Crime Data

Unof
ﬁ
cial crime data are collected by non-gov-
ernment organizations, such as private security

ﬁ
rms, social service agencies, and academic or
research institutions. Crime-related cases are
part of the records in non-government organiza-
tions whose operations are directly or indirectly


192
Y.W. Cheung and N.W.T. Cheung
related to crime and deviance. For example,
managements of shopping malls have records of
shoplifting incidents reported by shops in the
malls. Outreaching social work agencies have
information on the delinquent behaviour of mar-
ginal youths who are their clients. Non-
government organizations vary a great deal in
how detailed and systematic their record keeping
practices are.

Since the past two decades, a special feature
of unof
ﬁ
cial crime and deviance data has been
the use of the self-report method in survey data
collection (Hindelang et al.
1982
; Shapland

1978
). This method involves the administration
of an anonymous questionnaire to respondents
who
ﬁ
ll out the questionnaires themselves, pro-
viding answers to questions that ask about their
commitment of delinquent behaviours in a
speci
ﬁ
ed period of time in the past (e.g. in the
past 30 days). This method is most popular in
surveys of students that aim to understand the
prevalence, patterns, and social and psychologi-
cal correlates of deviance, delinquency, or other
risk-taking behaviours among them. The major
drawback of the method is that it only collects
information on less serious and sensitive delin-
quent behaviours, as respondents are unlikely to
answer questions on serious delinquent acts. The
earliest self-report surveys of students in Hong
Kong were mostly conducted by academics. One of
the earliest studies of deviant behaviour of second-
ary students using the self-report method was the
“Behaviour and Attitude of Hong Kong Adolescents
Survey,” conducted in 1986 with a sample of 1,139
students from randomly selected secondary schools
(Cheung and Ng
1988
; Cheung
1997
)
.

The use of the self-report method has become
very popular since the 1990s, as social science
research on crime and deviance began to
ﬂ
ourish
in Hong Kong. While students continued to be
popular participants in self-report studies, such
as the study of school bullying in primary schools
(Wong et al.
2002
; Wong
2004
)
, the self-report
method was also adopted in interview surveys of
risk behaviours of other sectors of the population,
such as Hong Kong marginal youths’ drug use in
Hong Kong and Shenzhen, a city in the Mainland
most adjacent to Hong Kong (Cheung and Cheung

2006
)
, and child abuse of parents (Tang
1998
)
.
Furthermore, government departments also com-
missioned university researchers to conduct com-
munity surveys relating to crime and deviance
topics that have generated heated public concern.
For example, the Home Affairs Bureau has com-
missioned a research team of the Hong Kong
Polytechnic University in 2005 to study the
involvement of the general population in gam-
bling activities. Four years later, the Bureau com-
missioned a team of the University of Hong Kong
to do a follow-up study in 2005 (Home Affairs
Bureau
2002,
2005
)
. The Social Welfare
Department has commissioned a group of social
scientists in the University of Hong Kong to carry
out a territory-wide household survey in 2003–
2004 to determine the incidence and prevalence
rates of child abuse and spouse battering
(Department of Social Work and Social
Administration
2005
)
. Some NGOs have also
become active in research since the 1990s. The
Hong Kong Federation of Youth Groups
(HKFYG) is probably the most active NGO in
the research on youths. Its research has generated
a huge data bank on various aspects of youths
and their lives in Hong Kong, of which youth
deviance and delinquency are among the popular
topics of the surveys (HKFYG
2007
)
.

12.3

The Criminal Justice System

The various government departments involved in
handling crime together form the criminal justice
system in society. In the above description of
of
ﬁ
cial statistics collected by these departments,
we have already brie
ﬂ
y introduced each of them.
Here, we will take a look at the whole criminal
justice system in Hong Kong.

In a sense, the Hong Kong criminal justice
system, patterned after the common law system
of the UK, is not very different from that of many
Western societies. The emphasis on the rule of
law and due process has long been rooted in
Hong Kong. Due to the special historical devel-
opment of Hong Kong, its criminal justice sys-
tem has also evolved through different stages
since the Hong Kong Island
ﬁ
rst fell into the


193
12 Crime and Criminal Justice in Hong Kong
hands of the British in the mid-nineteenth cen-
tury. Since the area of Hong Kong was very small,
it would seem that any elaborate law enforcement
system was not necessary. Even when the
Kowloon Peninsula and New Territory regions
were secured by the British to become a part of
Hong Kong at the end of the nineteenth century,
the territory was still small, a mere 400 sq. miles.
A remote
ﬁ
shing village at that time, Hong Kong
was inhabited by just a few thousand people.

But there were serious reasons for establish-
ing a strong law enforcement apparatus right
from the beginning. The colony was ruled by a
foreign government, which did not have legiti-
macy in the Chinese population. Therefore, the

ﬁ
rst and foremost aim of the criminal justice sys-
tem was to control the Chinese (Gaylord and
Traver
1994
, pp. 2–6). In addition to the need for
registration of ordinary inhabitants, triads and
organized crimes also must be controlled and
monitored. The population began to increase in
the
ﬁ
rst half of the twentieth century, when peo-
ple
ﬂ
ed in large numbers from the war-torn and
disaster-struck China mainland to Hong Kong.
As the Communist Party took over mainland
China in 1949, free entry from the mainland to
Hong Kong was stopped about 2 years later. The
population of Hong Kong reached two million in
1950, a manyfold increase since the beginning of
the colony. In place to control crime in such a
large population was the coercive law enforce-
ment system developed since the early years.

12.3.1
Hong Kong Police

Refugees who
ﬂ
ed from the mainland to set-
tle in Hong Kong around 1949 in order to escape
Communist rule had quickly increased the pop-
ulation of Hong Kong. They were a source of
cheap labour; some of them were entrepreneurs
with capital and expertise in manufacturing.
Hong Kong was then beginning to leave behind
its image of a small
ﬁ
shing community to chart
its course in industrialization and moderniza-
tion. An economically dynamic and socially
heterogeneous society was a new challenge to
the colonial government, who was faced with
housing, employment, poverty, health care, and
other social problems characteristic of a new
industrial society.

The occurrence of riots and unrests in 1950s
and 1960s had supported the Hong Kong gov-
ernment’s belief that a strong police force and a
punitive approach in law enforcement was
essential in maintaining law and order and
defending a foreign regime. The series of anti-
colonial riots in 1966/1967, staged by
Communists in Hong Kong in response to the
proliferation of the Cultural Revolution in
mainland China, had threatened the stability of
the society and ruined its economy. This devas-
tating event sent a message to the Hong Kong
Government that a stable society needed more
than a tough police force. An important way to
dilute social unrest and to understand the mood
of the mass was to improve public relations.
Since the 1970s, when the government refor-
mulated its policy to build relations with grass-
root communities, the police also played an
important role. Service became a new mandate,
a new image of the force. Professionalism also
began to be emphasized for the modernization
of the force (Lau
2008
)
, and more and more
university graduates were recruited. By the
1990s, the Hong Kong Police Force has gained
a high reputation among police organizations in
the world.


12.3.2
The ICAC

The modern, service-oriented, and professional
image of the Hong Kong police we see today was
in stark contrast with the police image before the
1970s. For many decades, the police force, which
had been legally mandated to investigate and
punish corruption offenders, had been a very cor-
rupt government department. Corruption might
have a link with traditional Chinese culture,
which sometimes places more emphasis on par-
ticularistic relationships and favouritism than
established rules in getting things done (Lee

1981
)
, but giving the anti-corruption mandate to
the police force could have been the greatest
obstacle to the eradication of corruption.


194
Y.W. Cheung and N.W.T. Cheung

The
ﬁ
rst anti-bribery law in Hong Kong was
the Misdemeanours Punishment Ordinance (No.
3 of 1898), which gave the police responsibility
for investigating corruption among public ser-
vants. After
ﬁ
ve decades, the Prevention of
Corruption Ordinance (No. 34 of 1948) was
enacted, and the police established an Anti-
Corruption Squad to tackle corruption. Four years
later, this was transformed in 1952 into the Anti-
Corruption Branch of the police force, with
greater power in its work and headed by an assis-
tant commissioner. Ironically, the police force
had become the most corrupt department in the
public sector, with of
ﬁ
cers protecting gambling,
drug, and other vice syndicates. Public con
ﬁ
dence
in the police had sunk to a very low level, despite
some further re-structuring of the anti-corruption
unit in the police force in response to the
Prevention of Bribery Ordinance (Cap 201) in
1971. It was not until the public outcry in 1973
due to the successful slipping out of Hong Kong
of the Chief Superintendent Peter Godber while
under investigation for suspected corruption
charges that the British Hong Kong Government
decided to take drastic measures to remedy police
and public sector corruption.

Against this background, anti-corruption work
was separated from the police force, and in 1974,
the ICAC was founded (Lo
1994
)
. The ICAC was
a government unit, but was independent of the
police and other law enforcement departments,
and accountable directly to the Governor. It was
given the same power as other law enforcement
units such as the police and customs and excise.
Yet, the ICAC focuses not just on law enforce-
ment, which is a unilateral approach con
ﬁ
ning to
the legal control of the corruption problem. The
ICAC certainly was the
ﬁ
rst to adopt a strategy
that embraced not only operations (law enforce-
ment) but also systematic prevention (to identify
and minimize corruption opportunities in the
working methods of government/public sectors)
and community-wide education (Lo
2001
)
. This
tripartite strategy and its remarkably high level of
ef
ﬁ
cacy are conducive to Hong Kong’s notable
and persistent success in anti-corruption reform
over the last
ﬁ
ve decades (Lo
2001
, Quah
2010
)
.
Despite the concern over surging opportunities
for corruption in Hong Kong after 1997 due to
the return of sovereignty to and incessant integra-
tion with China (Chan
2001
)
, the ICAC still has
preserved anti-corruption, turning Hong Kong to
a city recognized internationally as one of the
least corrupt regions across the globe (Manion

2004
)
. With reference to the 2010 Corruption
Perceptions Index complied by Transparency
International (a global civil society organization
headquartered in Berlin), Hong Kong was ranked
13th among the 178 countries or places assessed,
scoring 8.4 on a 0–10 scale with 10 representing
the least corrupt and 0 the most corrupt
(Transparency International
2011
)
.

12.3.3
Customs and Excise Department

As mentioned above, the responsibilities of the
Customs and Excise Department (C&ED) fall
into a diversity of areas, including anti-smug-
gling, protection and collection of revenue on
dutiable commodities, detection and deterrence
of narcotics traf
ﬁ
cking and drug abuse, safe-
guarding of intellectual property rights and con-
sumer interests, protection and facilitation of
legitimate trade to uphold Hong Kong’s trading
integrity, and ful
ﬁ
lment of international obliga-
tions (Customs and Excise Department
2011
)
.
Law enforcement in these aspects of work is
based on relevant ordinances, including the
Dutiable Commodities Ordinance, Dangerous
Drugs
Ordinance,
Copyright
Ordinance,
Copyright (Amendment) Bill (2009), Import and
Export Ordinance, Trade Descriptions Ordinance,
Toys and Children’s Products Safety Ordinance,
and Consumer Goods Safety Ordinance.

The Department, headed by the Commissioner
of Customs and Excise, has an establishment of
5,562 posts in 2010 (Information Services
Department
2010
)
. It is organized into
ﬁ
ve
branches: the Boundary and Ports Branch (airport,
land boundary, and rail and ferry command), the
Excise and Strategic Support Branch (customs
affairs, dutiable commodities administration,
IT, project planning, and strategic research),
the Trade Controls Branch (CEPA, customer pro-
tection, trade declaration, and investigation), the


195
12 Crime and Criminal Justice in Hong Kong
Administration and Human Resource Development
Branch (central administration and
management),
and the Intelligence and Investigation Branch (nar-
cotics drugs, anti-smuggling enforcement and
intellectual property).

The history of the C&ED is as long as that of
Hong Kong itself, since the attraction of Hong
Kong to the British in the middle of nineteenth
century was its strategic location for trade with
China. As soon as the British secured Hong Kong
after the
ﬁ
rst Opium War in 1841, a Harbour
Department was set up to monitor incoming and
departing commercial vessels. In 1887, the
Imports and Exports Of
ﬁ
ce was set up to monitor
imports and exports of opium in Hong Kong.
Since then, the past 100 years have witnessed
rapid developments of the Department as Hong
Kong evolved into a bustling entrepot and export
processing zone in the
ﬁ
rst half of the twentieth
century, and then as a
ﬁ
nancial centre since the
1980s. Hong Kong is one of the busiest airports
and container ports in the world. The huge vol-
ume of cross-boundary traf
ﬁ
c of people and
goods between Hong Kong and the mainland
requires a strong and effective C&ED force to
deal with smuggling of consumer goods, drug
traf
ﬁ
cking, and other problems. Since the han-
dover in 1997, C&ED and its counterparts in the
Shenzhen and Guangdong Province have greatly
increased their cooperation in combating cross-
boundary smuggling and illicit drug traf
ﬁ
cking,
and sharing of experience and intelligence. This
kind of cooperation will continue and deepen in
the next decade (Gaylord
2009
, p. 89).

12.3.4
Judiciary

The police, ICAC, and C&ED are law enforce-
ment departments that bring alleged offenders
into the criminal justice process. When a prosecu-
tion is made, the alleged offender will enter the
second stage of the criminal justice process, where
criminal proceedings will commence. Not all
criminal cases actually proceed to trial, as some
defendants will plead guilty before trial begins.

A judiciary independent of the government
legislature and administration is an important
feature of Hong Kong’s criminal justice process.
After 1997, the independence of the judiciary has
been constitutionally guaranteed under Article 85
of the Basic Law of Hong Kong. The mission of
the judiciary is “to maintain an independent and
effective judicial system which upholds the rule
of law, safeguards the rights and freedoms of the
individual, and commands con
ﬁ
dence within and
outside Hong Kong” (Judiciary
2011
)
. Any ero-
sion of judicial independence due to pressure
from Beijing would seriously undermine main-
land’s “One country, two systems” promise to
Hong Kong.

Magistrates’ courts are where all criminal
cases commence. They hear a wide range of both
summary and indictable offences. These are the
busiest courts in Hong Kong, with caseload of
over 310,000 in 2010 (Judiciary
2011
)
. More
serious indictable offences are referred to either
the District Courts or the Courts of First Instance
(formerly called High Court). Also part of high
Court is the Court of Appeal, which hears appeals
against decisions of the District Court and the
Court of First Instance in both criminal and civil
offences. Appeals against decisions of the Court
of Appeal are heard in the Court of Final Appeal.
“Final” as it may be, when it comes to Hong
Kong’s Basic Law, the Standing Committee of
the National People’s Congress has the
ﬁ
nal
authority of interpretation. This could create ten-
sion between the judiciary and the government,
as the latter might seek the interpretation of the
Standing Committee of NPC to override a differ-
ent decision, or prevent the occurrence of a dif-
ferent decision, of the Court of Final Appeal. In
1999, the government did just that to prevent the
wives of Hong Kong residents who were main-
landers to have right of abode in Hong Kong
without having to go through the process of
applying and waiting in line in their hometowns
in the mainland (Gittings
2009
, pp. 163–164).

12.3.5
Correctional Services
Department

The CSD is at the other end of the criminal jus-
tice system. If in the early days a strong police


196
Y.W. Cheung and N.W.T. Cheung
force was necessary for the British Hong Kong
Government to control the Chinese and protect
the colonial regime in Hong Kong, a tough prison
system was an essential supporting apparatus. It
is not surprising, therefore, that for many years,
Hong Kong has had high incarceration rates com-
pared with many Western societies (Broadhurst
et al.
2008
, p. 59). As Table
12.4 shows, during
the early to mid-2000s, the number of admissions
to CSD per year was over 25,000.

Like the case of the Police Force, CSD has
gone through new developments in the last sev-
eral decades. Its current mission is “to protect
the public and reduce crime, by providing a
secure, safe, humane, decent and healthy envi-
ronment for people in custody, opportunities for
rehabilitation of offenders, and working in col-
laboration with the community and other agen-
cies” (Correctional Services Department
2011
)
.
Indeed, incarceration for detention and deter-
rence purposes is only one of the functions of
CSD today. Since the 1980s, reforms have been
started, moving away from paternalistic, coer-
cive custody as the only modality to incorporate
rehabilitation as an integral part of its services.
The landmark event was perhaps the change of
the name of the department from “Prison
Department” to “CSD” in 1982. As more and
more efforts were made to introduce rehabilita-
tive elements in the 1980s and 1990s, a new
Rehabilitation Division was set up in 1998 to
coordinate and promote such efforts. A cam-
paign in the community was launched in 1999 to
encourage employers in the community to give
rehabilitated offenders a chance to receive an
employment and start a new life. In 2000, the
term “discharged prisoners” was changed to
“rehabilitated persons” in order to reduce the
social stigma associated with the former.

Since the 1990s, CSD has been facing at least
two operational problems. The
ﬁ
rst issue is the
rapid increase of the percentage of females in the
total prison population, which has great implica-
tions for more facilities to be made available to
ease the crowding problem in prison and more
personnel to cope with the growing inmate popu-
lation (Joe Laider
2009
, pp. 192–194). The other
one is the change of the pattern of drug use of
inmates admitted to the Drug Addiction Treatment
Centre (DATC) of CSD. Since the mid-1990s, the
drug of choice among young drug users in Hong
Kong has shifted from heroin to psychoactive
drugs such as ecstasy and ketamine (Joe Laider

2005
; Cheung and Cheung
2006
)
. Inmates of
DATC aged under 21 have become predomi-
nantly psychoactive drug abusers, whereas the
percentage of psychoactive drug abusers among
inmates aged 21 or over is also increasing.
A great challenge for DATC is how to modify its
existing heroin-based treatment modality in order
to cater to the treatment needs of the rapidly
increasing percentage of psychoactive drug abus-
ers (Joe Laider
2009
, pp. 195–196).

Looking Ahead

One of the most important assets left behind in
Hong Kong by the British is the upholding of the
rule of law and a mature criminal justice system
with a judiciary that is independent of the gov-
ernment. When the British colonizers
ﬁ
rst occu-
pied Hong Kong in 1842, they would not have
imagined such a far-reaching consequence of
their presence. At the beginning of the British
regime, the legal system was designed primarily
for crime control and deterrence. The criminal
justice system has evolved and matured over the
decades, concomitantly with social, economic,
and political developments in society. Since Hong
Kong was always referred to before the 1997
handover as “borrowed time, borrowed place,”
the basis for the governance of the British Hong
Kong administration was more of compliance
than legitimacy. Knowing that a colonial admin-
istration could never achieve complete legiti-
macy, the British Hong Kong Government had, in
the later part of last century, made efforts to
“maintain a level playing
ﬁ
eld,” as put by Jones
and Vagg
(
2007
, p. 628) in their phenomenal
socio-historical analysis of the criminal justice in
Hong Kong. A fair and modern legal system
could increase the legitimacy of the colonial gov-
ernment. We may describe this as a kind of
“instrumental legitimacy,” established on the
basis of the instrumental values of institutions.


197
12 Crime and Criminal Justice in Hong Kong

The reversion of Hong Kong’s sovereignty to
China in 1997 did not automatically
ﬁ
ll the long-
time gap in legitimacy due to the British colonial
administration. Although most people in Hong
Kong supported the handover, mainland China
was an even more alien administration for people
in Hong Kong to be subject to. The “One Country,
Two Systems” promise was a very practical way
to ease the tension, for at least
ﬁ
fty years,
between return of sovereignty and the exercise
of it through direct governance. Hong Kong’s
existing institutions and way of life before 1997
were to continue after 1997, and this became a
yardstick for assessing the success or failure of
the “One country, Two systems” policy.

In crime and justice, the continuation of the
pre-1997 model of criminal justice is an impor-
tant indicator of the extent to which Hong Kong
is allowed to administer justice without the inter-
ference of the Central Government. The more
Hong Kong people perceive that they have full
autonomy in running their legal system, the more
“instrumental legitimacy” would be reaped by
the Central Government. On the contrary, if peo-
ple perceive that the Central Government is inter-
fering with Hong Kong affairs, then it would be
dif
ﬁ
cult to construct their trust on the Central
Government. In recent years, some people have
expressed great frustrations on the Hong Kong
Government’s seemingly yielding to Beijing’s
in
ﬂ
uence. The growing discontent seems to breed
antagonistic and even violent confrontations with
the police or government of
ﬁ
cials in parades and
demonstrations against the government. There is
also a trend that more and more judicial reviews
over government policies are launched by frus-
trated citizens in order to block government poli-
cies. On the one hand, this shows that freedom of
expressions and freedom of speech are still very
much alive in Hong Kong. But on the other hand,
the deliberate use of increasingly radical and vio-
lent means against the Hong Kong SAR govern-
ment
in
parades
and
demonstrations
is
undermining the effectiveness of law enforce-
ment in maintaining law and order. One of the
greatest challenges facing the criminal justice
system is to be caught in the political struggle
between anti-government groups and the govern-
ment and its supporters, thereby eroding the basis
for its independence from the government and
political parties, an ideal that has been a corner-
stone of the Hong Kong society.

Rule of Law, democracy, development, and
human rights are dependent on the degree of suc-
cess that the governments are able to achieve on
the criminal justice front. The objectives of the
criminal justice are prevention and control of
crime, maintenance of public order and peace,
protection of the rights of victims as well as per-
sons in con
ﬂ
ict with law, punishment and reha-
bilitation of those adjudged guilty of committing
of crimes, and generally protection of life and
property against crime and criminality. It is con-
sidered the primary obligation of the state under
the constitution of India.

The principal formal agencies of criminal jus-
tice are police, judiciary, and corrections. Under
the Constitution of India, Police and Prison
Administration are the State subjects. But, the
Supreme Court at Federal level and High Courts
at state level administer the judiciary in the entire
country. Though police and prisons are state sub-
jects, the organizational structure, administration,
and functioning of all the agencies of criminal
justice are as per the federal laws such as Indian
penal code, Criminal Procedure Code, Indian
Evidence Act, Police Act, and Prison Act. This
paper explains the structure and functioning of
various agencies of Criminal Justice System.

13.1

Role of the Federal
Government and Its Police
Force

There is no independent department of police at
the federal level. But the Federal government
performs numerous police functions. The Federal
Parliament has paramount jurisdiction over the
Central and the Concurrent subjects. There can
be no doubt that police and law and order are
state subjects. In spite of it, many quasi-police
subjects are from the federal government. For
example, the administration of the subjects or
items like the Central Bureau of intelligence and
investigation,
Preventive
Detention,
Arms,
Ammunitions, Explosives, Extradition, Passports,
and a host of similar or corresponding subjects is
the sole responsibility of the Central Government.
The Federal Government has also the power to
amend the basic Police Acts, like the Indian
Police Act, 1861; the Indian Penal Code, 1860;
the Code of Criminal Procedure, 1861; the Code
of Civil Procedure, 1859; and the Indian Evidence
Act. These are all binding on the State
Governments. Thus, the constitutionally created

ﬂ
exible situation and the organization and admin-
istration of police (Sethi
1983
) in the states are
brought under the purview of the Central
Government
under
special
circumstances
(Gautam
1993
)

Central Bureau of Investigation

The Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) was
created in 1963 at the federal level. It was estab-
lished to undertake thorough investigation of
important cases having interstate jurisdiction and
international rami
ﬁ
cations. The bureau initiates
its own investigation but the State Government
can also borrow its services in the
ﬁ
eld of preven-
tion and detection of crime, if and when required
(Raghavan
1989
)
. CBI is headed by Director
General of Police (DGP) assisted by Regional
Directors. Recently many sensational cases have
been investigated by CBI.

13.3

Central Intelligence Bureau

The collection and assessment of political and
other useful intelligence relevant to the security
of the entire country are the primary function of
Central Intelligence Bureau (CIB). The bureau
primarily coordinates the activities of special
branches of criminal investigation departments of
the states (Nehad
1992
)
. The CIB has its head-
quarters in all the capital cities and important
towns of the country and its of
ﬁ
cials have a
sophisticated network of information feedbacks
about individual and organization. The intelli-
gence collected by the headquarters is screened,

ﬁ
ltered, and veri
ﬁ
ed independently as well as
through
state
departments
of
criminal
investigation.

13.4

Central Reserve Police Force

The Central Reserve Police was established at
Neemuch, M.P., in the year 1939. As a strong arm
of the federal government, it was constituted
under the Central Reserve Police Bill 1949 as one
of the armed forces for the purpose of maintain-
ing internal security and it is used during the
period of crises with its establishments all over
the country. The force also was conferred with
certain powers under Cr. P.C. in matters related
with suppression of internal disturbances and res-
toration of order. At present the force comprises
1.20 lakhs men distributed over 93 battalions and
many more ancillary institutions. The role of the
force is varied and facing multiplicity of prob-
lems. Sometimes it deals with insurgents and
extremists and also handles sensitive law-and-
order situations (Krishna
1980
)
.

13.5

Structure of the State Police

The State Police under the head of DGP consists
of Commissionerate, Zones, Ranges, and Districts
headed by Commissioner of Police, Inspector
General of Police (IGP), Deputy Inspector
General of Police (Dy. IGP), and Superintendent
of Police, respectively.

13 Criminal Justice System in India
other legal proves, as may be by Law issued
against any person committing an offence. The
police station is the basic structure and primary
administrative unit of the police administration
(Diaz
1976
). The responsibility of maintenance
of law and order, patrolling, and prevention of
crime in a particular given jurisdiction rests on
the police station. Normally the personnel of a
rural police station consists of one Sub-Inspector
of Police as Station House Of
ﬁ
cer and under him
one Head Constable and ten Constables. The cit-
ies and other urban areas have special problems
like slums, trafﬁ
c, industrial disputes, and orga-
nized crimes, threats of terrorists and VIP visits
to handle these issues speciﬁ
c police wings are
also there (Sen
1986
).

13.7

Functions of Police

The Federal criminal law, namely, Indian Penal
Code, de
ﬁ
nes various types of crimes and pre-
scribes punishment for each crime. Similarly the
Criminal Procedure Code contains elaborate
details about the procedure to be followed by the
Police Of
ﬁ
cer in every investigation, inquiry, and
trial, for every offence under the Indian Penal
Code or under any other law (Kelkar
1998
)
. The
main responsibility of the Police is maintenance
of law and order, patrolling, prevention of crime,
and investigation in a particular given jurisdiction
(Saha
1990
)
.

Investigation primarily consists of ascertain-
ing facts and circumstances of the case. It includes
all the efforts of a police of
ﬁ
cer for collection of
evidence: proceeding to the spot; ascertaining
facts and circumstances; discovery and arrest of
the suspected offender; collection of evidence
relating to the commission of offence, which may
consist of the examination of various persons
including the accused and taking of their state-
ments in writing and the search of places or sei-
zure of things considered necessary for the
investigation and to be produced at the trial; and
formation of opinion as to whether on the basis of
the material collected there is a case to place the
accused before a magistrate for trial and if so,
taking the necessary steps for
ﬁ
lling the charge-
sheet. Investigation ends in a police report to the
magistrate (Krishna
1994
)
.

Two major issues in Indian Police system fre-
quently raised are violence in the custody and
undue political intervention in the police admin-
istration. In a number of judgments by high courts
and also by the Supreme Court it has been spelt
out clearly that every policeman must know that
it is not permissible for police personnel to in
ﬂ
ict
even the slightest physical harm to anyone except
in his own self-defense (Sunil Batra vs. Delhi
Administration, 1980). Law places him on par
with other citizens in that regard and he is entitled
to use only that much physical force which is rea-
sonably necessary to thwart any assault on him in
the exercise of his right of self-defense. The
National Human Rights has also many times
intervened against this custodial violence. Despite
all these interventions still there are reports on
custodial violence and deaths in police custody.

13.8

Police Abuse of Power
and Corruption

The subordinate echelons of the police are often
known to extort money at every step which is a
common feature all over India with only a few
good exceptions. At the same time the tasks
which are the liability of the police are quite often
neglected outright and performance occurs only
at a price which affects the public image of the
organization; the gross result is rampant corrup-
tion and abuse of human rights. They are desper-
ately depended on and pampered by the politicians
in all states and the central government and have
carved out good prospects for themselves in the
shape of a bloated cadre with copious sinecures
for their advancement in quick steps thanks to
politicians (Ganguly,
2009
)
. The
Transparency
International
, the Berlin-based NGO, has rated
India as the 95th most corrupt country among
183 countries in the world in its year 2011 cor-
ruption perception index.

The most important elements of police cor-
ruption are misuse of authority and misuse of
personal attainment. One of the main causes for
this is that the police of
ﬁ
cials have ceased to act


202
R. Thilagaraj
as professionals and are politicized to a great
extent. They are manipulated by political leaders,
who have misused the power of appointments
and transfers to patronize weak or corrupt of
ﬁ
cers
for their own sel
ﬁ
sh purposes at the cost of public
interest. The main areas for their interference are
appointments, transfers, rewards, and punish-
ments. General police corruption includes brib-
ery or exchange of money or something of value
between the police and the wrongdoer. Other
police crimes may range from brutality, fake
encounters, sexual harassment, and custodial
crimes to illicit use of weapons.

Open instances of corruption by the lower
ranks of the police, who are in direct contact with
the public, have wider implications on the image
of the police and the police–public relations. The
police personnel, especially the Constables,
harass and extort money from the people many
times a day. In most of the places there is a deal
of understanding between the street vendors and
the police about the “Mamool amount” (bribe) to
be paid to the police. According to the grapevine
in the police circles, money extracted from these
people also reaches the higher levels. The increas-
ing nexus between police personnel at various
levels and ma
ﬁ
a operators is another disturbing
trend in most of the cities like Mumbai, Delhi,
Kolkata, Lucknow, Ghaziabad, Hyderabad, etc.
These ma
ﬁ
a syndicates bribe the police and the
organized crimes such as periodic extortion and
kidnapping for ransom committed by them go
undetected. Delay is attributed to be one of the
main causes of corruption. The Santhanam
Committee report (1964) noted that administra-
tive delays are one of the major causes of corrup-
tion and quite often, delay is deliberately contrived
so as to obtain some kind of illegal grati
ﬁ
cation.
“Speed money” is reported to have become a
fairly common type of corrupt practice particu-
larly in matters relating to grant of licenses, per-
mits, etc.

13.9

Crime in India

The incidence of cognizable crimes in the coun-
try during the decade 2000–2010 reveals that as
many as 6,750,748 cognizable crimes were
reported in the country during 2010 comprising
22.25 lakh cases under the IPC and 45.26 lakh
cases under the SLL. The ratio of IPC to SLL
crimes varied from 1:1.72 in 2006 to 1:2.03 in
2010. In terms of percentage, 67% of total cases
(IPC + SLL) during 2010 were accounted for by
Special Acts and Local Laws and the rest of the
cases (33%) by the Indian Penal Code. The rate
of total crimes (IPC + SLL) was 569.3 in 2010
showing an increase of 24.9% over 2006 and a
decrease by 0.3% over 2009. The table below
gives the latest statistics of the IPC and SLL
crimes occurred during 2010.

A total of 2,224,831 IPC crimes were reported in the country during the year 2010 against 2,121,345 in 2009 recording
an increase of 4.9% in 2010. The share of IPC crimes to total cognizable crimes in percentage terms increased from
36.3% in 2005 to 36.8% in 2006.The IPC Crime rate has increased by 6.2% during the decade 2000–2010 from 176.7
in 2000 to 187.6 in 2010. A total number of 241,986 violent crimes were reported in the country accounting for 10.4%
of the total IPC crimes during the year 2010. Puducherry (352.3), Kerala (424.1), Chandigarh (299.8), Madhya Pradesh
(297.2) and Delhi (279.8) and 13 more States/UTs have reported much higher crime rates as compared to the National
average of 187.6 which is higher than National average of 181.4 in 2009.

The property crimes have the highest share of
36.7% among the IPC crimes followed by crimes
against scheduled castes (SC) with a share of
35% and crimes against children with a share of
34.6% among the IPC crimes.

13.11
The Role of Judiciary

The Indian Judicial System has the Supreme
Court of India at its helm, which at present is
located in the capital city of Delhi, without any
benches in any part of the nation, and is presided
by the Chief Justice of India.

The Supreme Court of India has many Benches
for the litigation, and this apex court is not only
the
ﬁ
nal court of permissible appeal but also deals
with interstate matters, and matters comprising
more than one state, and the matters between the
Union Government and any one or more states,
as the matters on its original side. The largest
bench of the Supreme Court of India is called the
Constitution Bench and comprises 5 or 7 judges,
depending on the importance attached of the mat-
ters before it, as well as the work load of the
court. The apex court comprises only various
benches comprising the Divisional benches of 2
and 3 judges, and the Full benches of 3 or 5
judges. The Appeals to this court are allowed
from the High Court, only after the matter is
deemed to be important enough on the point of
law or on the subject of the constitution of the
nation, and is certi
ﬁ
ed as such by the relevant
High Court.

Every State has a High Court, which works
under the direct guidance and supervision of the
Supreme Court of India, and is the uppermost
court in that state. The High Courts are also
termed as the courts of equity, and can be
approached in writs not only for violation of fun-
damental rights under the provisions of the Indian
constitution but also for any other rights of the
Constitution, and it has powers to supervise over
all its subordinate courts in the state. In fact,
when apparently there is no effective remedy
available to a person in equity, in justice, he or
she can always move to the High Court in an
appropriate writ.

Below the High court, there are subordinate
criminal courts under its supervision in each

district. They are court of sessions and court of
judicial magistrates. These courts conduct trials in
all matters related to all types of offenders.
However, only the session’s court has the power to
pass the sentence of death. Every district is headed
by the Chief Judicial Magistrate who heads over
the other Judicial Magistrates, these courts being
primary criminal courts, where every offender is

ﬁ
rst produced after arrest by the police.

Administration of criminal justice is carried
through these Magistrate-Courts and Session’s
Courts. The Court at the lowest level is called
Judicial Magistrate of the second class. This court
is competent to try the case if the offence is pun-
ishable with imprisonment for a term not exceed-
ing one year, or with
ﬁ
ne not exceeding
ﬁ
ve
thousand rupees, or with both. The First Class
Magistrate is competent to try offences punish-
able with imprisonment for a term not exceeding
3 years or with
ﬁ
ne up to 10,000 rupees. The
assistant session’s judge is competent to impose
punishments up to 10 years imprisonment and
any
ﬁ
ne. The session’s judge can impose any
punishment authorized by law: but the sentence
of death passed by him should be subject to the
con
ﬁ
rmation by the high court.

13.12
Function of Court

The high court may empower magistrates of
ﬁ
rst
class to try certain offences in a summary way.
Second class magistrates can summarily try an
offence only if punishable only with a
ﬁ
ne or
imprisonment for a term not exceeding six
months. In a summary trial, no sentence of
imprisonment for a term exceeding three months
can be passed in any conviction. The particulars


205
13 Criminal Justice System in India
of the summary trial are entered in the record of
the court. In every case tried summarily in which
the accused does not plead guilty, the magistrate
records the substance of the evidence and a judg-
ment containing a brief statement of the reasons
for the
ﬁ
nding. Trial is the judicial adjudication
of a person’s guilt or innocence. Under the
Criminal Procedure Code (Cr.P.C.), criminal tri-
als have been categorized into three divisions
having different procedures, called warrant, sum-
mons, and summary trials. A warrant case relates
to offences punishable with death, imprisonment
for life, or imprisonment for a term exceeding
two years.

A summons case means a case relating to an
offence not being a warrant case, implying all
cases relating to offences punishable with impris-
onment not exceeding 2 years. In respect of sum-
mons cases, there is no need to frame a charge.
The court gives substance of the accusation,
which is called “notice,” to the accused when the
person appears in pursuance to the summons.

13.13
Public Prosecution

In India there is a public prosecution system to
prosecute the offenders. The Cr.P.C. provides for
the appointment of public prosecutors in the High
courts and District Courts. They are of
ﬁ
cials
assisting the criminal courts by placing before
the courts all the relevant aspects of the case. The
public prosecutor acts in accordance with the
directions
of
the
judge
(Thilagaraj
and
Varadharajan
2000
)
. The control of the trial is in
the hands of the trial judge of the criminal court.
Investigation is the prerogative of the Police and
the Public Prosecutor is believed to represent the
public interest (Chandrasekharan
2008
)
. He is
supposed to lead evidence favorable to the
accused for the bene
ﬁ
t of the court.

13.14
Death Penalty

In India, over a 100 years, the mode of death pen-
alty has remained the same. Section 368 (1) of the
Code of Criminal Procedure, 1898, provides as
follows: “When any person is sentenced to death,
the death sentence shall direct that he be hanged
by the neck till he is dead.” This provision has
been retained in Section 354 (5) of Cr.P.C. of
1973. The Supreme Court of India ruled in 1983
that the death penalty should be imposed only in
“the rarest of rare cases.” Capital crimes are mur-
der, gang robbery with murder, abetting the sui-
cide of a child or an insane person, waging war
against the nation, and abetting mutiny by a mem-
ber of the armed forces. According to
Amnesty
International 2012
, for the seventh consecutive
year India did not carry out any executions, but at
least 110 new death sentences were imposed in
2011, bringing the total number of people believed
to be under sentence of death at the end of 2011 to
between 400 and 500.

Several mercy petitions were rejected by the
President in 2011. However, executions in those
cases were suspended by courts to allow for the
consideration of separate legal challenges on the
delay in the decision of the mercy petitions, and
the constitutionality of the prolonged stay on
death row. On 16 June 2011, the Mumbai High
Court found that the mandatory imposition of the
death penalty under Section 31-A of the
Narcotic
Drugs and Psychotropic Substances Act, 1985
,
violated Article 21 of the Constitution of India,
and ruled that it be changed to give judges a dis-
cretionary choice of punishment. Following the
judgment, engaging in the production, manufac-
ture, possession, transportation, import into India,
export from India, or transshipment of narcotic
drugs as well as
ﬁ
nancing, directly or indirectly,
any of these activities are offences that are pun-
ishable by death at the discretion of the judge. In
December 2011, the Indian Parliament approved
legislation making acts of terrorism aimed at sab-
otaging oil and gas pipelines punishable by death,
in cases where the act of sabotage is likely to
cause death of any other person.

13.15
Lok Adalats

Lok Adalats which are voluntary agencies are
monitored by the State Legal Aid and Advice
Boards. They have proved to be a successful


206
R. Thilagaraj
alternative forum for resolving of disputes
through the conciliatory method.

The Legal Services Authorities Act, 1987,
provides statutory status to the legal aid move-
ment and it also provides for setting up of Legal
Services Authorities at the Central, State, and
District levels. These authorities will have their
own funds. Further, Lok Adalats which are at
present informal agencies will acquire statutory
status. Every award of Lok Adalats shall be
deemed to be a decree of a civil court or order of
a Tribunal and shall be
ﬁ
nal and binding on the
parties to the dispute. It also provides that in
respect of cases decided at a Lok Adalat, the court
fee paid by the parties will be refunded.

13.16
Alternate Dispute Resolution

ADR has emerged in India in the middle nineties
due to the inordinate delay in disposal of cases
resulting in docket explosion. In the place of
Restorative Justice in other countries, India has
Alternate Dispute Resolution. The privatization
and structural adjustment policies in Post India
legal system resulted in our thinking to
ﬁ
nd out
ways and means to explore the quick and inex-
pensive ways to resolve the disputes without each
and every case subjecting to the full Court
pro-
cesses. The Arbitration and Conciliation Act of
1996 explains various forms of Alternate Dispute
Resolution.

The most commonly known methods are medi-
ation, conciliation, and arbitration. These methods
have been widely used not only to resolve disputes
in commercial cases but also in a number of other
noncommercial cases as well. Various disputes
arise every day. ADR methods are the non-litiga-
tive dispute resolution strategies for resolving the
disputes outside the court premises. Lok Adalat is
one of the ADRs. It is one of the strategies for
early settlement of disputes, particularly in per-
sonal injury compensation. Legal aid programme
was provided in the year 1980 by the committee
for implementation of Legal Aid Schemes (CLIAS)
in holding Lok Adalatas for settlement of disputes
through conciliation. It has become popular for
pre-litigation settlement and the decision of Lok
Adalat became enforceable after the endorsement
of the concerned court.


13.17
Correctional Administration
in India

In India over one million criminal cases are
reported every year. Each annual incidence of
crime in the country necessitates the existence
of a huge network of prisons and other institu-
tions of correctional administration. In India
the number of prison inmates per million of
population is one of the lowest in the world.
There are a total of 1,393 prisons of different
categories and sizes, with an authorized inmate
capacity of 320,450.

One notable feature of the prison population
in India is the large number of under-trial prison-
ers (240,098). This large number of under-trial
prisoners has led to overcrowding in most of the
prisons (Shankardass
2000
)
. This is a cause of
great concern, of which the Federal Government
too has taken note of and has decided to provide

ﬁ
nancial assistance to the States to modernize
their existing prisons and build new prisons to
overcome the problem. This overcrowding of
prisons has taken place despite the fact that bail is
comparatively easy to obtain in the country.

13.20
Types of Prisons

The reception and classi
ﬁ
cation of prisoners in
India is a long drawn process. At the time of
admission, the prisoners are examined by Prison
Of
ﬁ
cers to verify their personal identify as writ-
ten in the Prison warrants issued by the Courts.
Thereafter, arrangements are made for safekeep-
ing of their personal belongings. This is followed
by a thorough personal search, which is con-
ducted in a decent manner with due care of pri-
vacy and human dignity. Thereafter, the prisoners
are sent to the Reception Ward where they are
examined by a Medical Of
ﬁ
cer, within 24 h of
admission. The Medical Of
ﬁ
cer is required to
record a detailed report in writing on a medical
sheet and weightment chart of the prisoner. The
prisoners are kept in the Reception Ward for
3–6 months before being moved to the main
Prison Wards. During this period, prisoners are
keenly observed by the correctional staff and
their hobbies, areas of interest, likes and dislikes,
personal characteristics, and family background
are studied and compiled. This compilation is
called case-work.

On the basis of their personal, socio-economic,
socio-cultural antecedents of prisoners, as ascer-
tained in the Reception Ward, the prisoners are
classiﬁ
ed and the nature of segregation are on the
basis of the physical and mental health, age
group, sex etc. to different wards. Juvenile delin-
quents are kept in Juvenile Homes exclusively
meant for them (Nitai
2002
).

All the Central and District Prisons have whole-
time or part-time physicians in Prison Hospitals
which have both outdoor and indoor facilities. The
medical staffs thoroughly undertake medical
examination of all prisoners periodically. They
also carry out inspection of food, sanitation, and
hygiene and other amenities being provided to the
prisoners. Apart from regular vocational training
in various trades and occupations, and the educa-
tional training schedules, correctional institutions
in India have also started a large number of pro-
grammes to improve the personality and mindset
of the prisoners. These are programmes on anger
management, social skills training, counseling
against drug and substance abuse, Yoga,
Transcendental Meditation, and Vipasana. Many
prisons in India have tried these new approaches
and have found the same to be extremely effective
in changing attitudes of prisoners.

It is encouraging to note that the rate of relapse
in crime is very low in India as compared to other
developed countries like the UK. The extent of
recidivism in India is not more than 10% while in
the UK, it is more than 72% (Walmsley
2008
)
. In
2010, the share of recidivists among all offenders
has decreased to 8.2% as compared to 9% in 2009
(Crime in India 2010). Absence of recidivism
shows the nature of impact of treatment
programmes running in prisons for the reforma-
tion and rehabilitation of prisoners. A number of
alter care programmes for released prisoners are
being run by the government with the help of
non-governmental organisations (NGOs) which


208
R. Thilagaraj
are acting as a bridge between the prisoners and
the community (Trivedi
1987
). These services
are offered to the prisoners on their release to
reintegrate in the main stem of social life. The
Prison Departments are also providing tool kits
of trades to released prisoners to achieve self-
employment.

13.21
Modernization of Prisons

It has been mentioned earlier that, though prisons
are primarily the concern of the respective State
Governments, the federal Government has come
up with the offer of substantial help to improve
the conditions in prisons. The federal government
proposes to spend 18,000 million rupees on
improving the conditions in prisons which include
construction of new prisons, expansion and reno-
vation of existing prisons, construction of houses
for prison personnel, and construction of new
prisons and improving the sanitation and water
supply in prisons (Chauhan and Srivastava
2011
)
.
Out of this total outlay, the States are expected to
contribute 25% from their own
ﬁ
scal resources.

13.22
Women in Detention

The National Committee on Women Prisoners
(1987) has thoroughly examined the conditions
of women in prisons. It has pointed out that there
should be respect for gender dignity and concern
for women in all correctional institutions and per-
sonnel in the Criminal Justice System. The police,
prison, correctional, and judicial personnel
involved in the handling of women are especially
trained to ensure this and their knowledge is
updated in laws and procedures applicable to
women. Taking into account the special role of
women in family life and social development and
the vulnerability of girls, the current policy of the
Criminal Justice System is to avoid the arrest and
detention of women to the extent possible. In
cases where women are taken into custody, all
provisions regarding protection of their person
and rights are scrupulously adhered to. At no
stage, a woman arrestee is left unguarded by a
police woman or other women authorized by the
Government. Whenever, women are detained or
kept in custody, in addition to basic amenity and
privacy, the prison administration makes every
effort to provide the essentials for meeting the
women special needs. Welfare of children is a
relevant consideration in the sentencing and dis-
position of women and every effort is made to
ensure that the children enjoy protection from the
detrimental effect of their mothers’ arrest and
incarceration. Earlier, women prisoners were
mostly given vocational training in sewing and
knitting. Now, efforts are being made to give
them options of other vocations and activities.
They are paid minimum standard wages laid
down in the Prison Manuals for their work.

While, it has not been possible to set up sepa-
rate prison for women in every State of the coun-
try, there are 12 exclusive prisons for women
with an inmate capacity of 2010. Wherever sepa-
rate prisons for women do not exist, the prisons
have separate wards for them which are guarded
by female correctional personnel.

13.23
Open Air Prisons

To counter the problem of overcrowding in the
prison, open air prison has been established in a
majority of states in India and it has been suc-
cessful in most of the states. An initiative launched
in the country in 1960, open prisons are assigned
to convicts who have served part of their sentence
and displayed good conduct. There are 22 open
prisons in India (Report on Jail Reforms 1983). It
is an initiative to reform the prisoners; open pris-
ons give them freedom to move around freely
during the day and earn a living in accordance
with their skill set. In some of the states, the con-
victs are allotted a house where he or she can
keep his family with him or her.

13.24
Probation

Probation is an alternative to imprisonment.
Community-based treatment of offenders is
widely used in India under the Probation of


209
13 Criminal Justice System in India
Offenders Act 1958. Young offenders and offend-
ers who have not committed serious offences
are released on probation based on their pre-
sentence investigation report of the probation
of
ﬁ
cer. The probation of
ﬁ
cer plays a major role
in reforming the offender in the community with
the support of family members of the offender,
his or her employer, NGOs, and other stake-
holders. However the judiciary has an inimical
attitude towards probation and hence the number
of probationers has been declining in the past
years (Chakrabarthi
1999
).

13.25
Parole

Parole is release of an offender from prison before
the termination of his or her sentence based on the
good behavior he or she maintained in the prison.
It is aimed at reduction of the period of incarcera-
tion. In India, parole is a conditional supervision
of sentence for a short duration to enable the pris-
oners to attend to certain problems. However, in
par with parole in other developed countries,
there is a provision for premature release of
offenders in the Criminal Procedure Code.


13.26
Juvenile Justice in India

The Juvenile Justice (Care and Protection of
Children) Act, 2000, takes into consideration
(1) provisions of the Indian Constitution; (2)
UN Standard Minimum Rules for the
Administration of Juvenile Justice, 1985 (the
Beijing Rules); (3) UN Convention on the
Right of the Child, 1989; and (4) United
Nations Rules for the Protection of Juveniles
Deprived of Their Liberty, 1990.

Juvenile Justice (Care and Protection of
Children) Act, 2000, is a major step forward in
terms of being a progressive and proactive legis-
lation for the care, protection, treatment, and
rehabilitation of “children in need of care and
protection” and “juveniles in con
ﬂ
ict with law.” It
is a comprehensive legislation for justice to the
children in the situation of abuse, exploitation,
and social maladjustment.

The framework of the reenacted law provides
for “Juvenile Justice Boards” in place of earlier
Juvenile Courts and “Child Welfare Committees”
in place of Juvenile Welfare Boards. These are
the legal bodies, called Competent Authorities,
for trial or proceedings of “Juveniles in Con
ﬂ
ict
with Law” and “Children in Need of Care and
Protection,” respectively. The Act provides for
the multiple roles of social workers and voluntary
organizations at various levels. Besides, the Act
has highly innovative provisions for the social
reintegration of these children through the inte-
grated institutional and noninstitutional care sys-
tems of adoption, foster care, and sponsorship
programmes (Thilagaraj
1988
)
.

13.27
Lacunas of Juvenile Justice
System

Study of juvenile justice systems shows that chil-
dren committing crimes, as well as others taken
charge of in order to prevent the commission of
crimes, are not being given the promised care.
Special police units for juveniles or special train-
ing to police for dealing with neglected and delin-
quent juveniles are an exception. Juvenile courts
and juvenile welfare boards have not been consti-
tuted in each district and their powers are exer-
cised by speci
ﬁ
ed magistrates without any special
training in child psychology or child welfare.
A majority of children are unhappy in the institu-
tions and the casework services are inadequate in
terms of diagnosis, counseling, and planning of
rehabilitation. The main socialization agents, the
caretakers, are the lowest paid, least qualiﬁ
ed and
at times even ill-informed about the needs of the
institutionalized children (Weiner
1991
). Very
few aftercare service are available. Despite a stat-
utory provision to the contrary, children are not
always released on bail, even in case of bailable
offences, by some juvenile courts. The various
organs of the JJS are malfunctioning primarily
because the system is an ill-coordinated one.
Each of its three main components—law enforce-
ment, adjudication, and correction—frequently
operates haphazardly with little knowledge of
what other segments are doing. The piecemeal

and fragmented measures taken for the care and
the welfare of delinquent and neglected juveniles
are bound to malfunction in the absence of a
holistic approach to the problem of juvenile
social maladjustment.

Judicial Review and Criminal
Justice Administration

Never before in its history was criminal justice
administration in India subjected to such a criti-
cal review by the Highest Court in the country as
in the last few decades. Discarding its erstwhile
“hands off doctrine towards prisons,” the Supreme
Court of India came strongly in favor of judicial
scrutiny and intervention whenever the rights of
prisoners in detention or custody were found to
have been infringed upon. In Sunil Batra vs.
Delhi Administration and Others (1980), Mr
Justice V.R. Krishna Iyer pronounced: “prisoners
have enforceable liberties, devalued may be but
not demonetized; and under our basic scheme.
Prison Power must bow before Judge Power, if
fundamental freedoms are in jeopardy.” Again in
Sunil Batra vs. Delhi Administration (1979), the
Court asked and af
ﬁ
rmed: “Are prisoner’s per-
sons? Yes, of course. To answer in the negative is
to convict the nation and the Constitution of
dehumanization and to repudiate the world legal
order, which now recognizes rights of prisoners
in the International Covenant on Prisoners’ Rights
to which our country has signed assent.” These
and several other judicial pronouncements have
set into motion a series of prison reforms all over
the country.

For the undue arrest and harassment by the
police there had been a number of cases in the
Supreme Court. The Supreme Court had laid
down guidelines governing arrest of a person
during investigation. This has been done with a
view to strike a balance between the needs of
Police on one hand and protection of Human
Rights of citizens from oppression and injustice
at the hands of the Law Enforcement Agencies
on the other hand.

The Supreme Court and High Courts in India
have of late evolved the practice of awarding
compensatory remedies not only in terms of
monetary but also in terms of other appropriate
relief and remedies to victims of crime. Bhopal
Union Carbide Gas tragedy victims are examples
of relief and remedies forged by the Apex Court.
In the case of Abuse of Power by police, the
Supreme Court ordered for victim compensation
by state and restitution by the alleged police
of
ﬁ
cer. In another case, the High Court has held
that the Criminal Justice System is not penal code
alone, and that it is restitutive justice too.

13.29
Conclusion

The criminal Justice system is, at present, a
complex of different agencies working at cross
purposes. The delivery of justice is delayed
and, at times, leads to miscarriage of the legal
process. The current status of the Criminal
Justice system throws many challenges to the
government. But the Indian criminal justice
system suffers from serious underfunding and
understaf
ﬁ
ng, and continues to be extremely
slow. As in every democratic civilized society,
this system is expected to provide the maxi-
mum sense of security to the people at large by
dealing with crimes and criminals effectively,
quickly, and legally. More speci
ﬁ
cally, the aim
is to reduce the level of criminality in society
by ensuring maximum detection of reported
crimes, conviction of the accused persons with-
out delay, awarding of appropriate punishments
to the convicted to meet the ends of justice, and
prevention of recidivism.

Some of the recent developments that have
taken place during the last few years in the judi-
cial delivery system to seek redress and accord
justice to the poor are worth mentioning. The
importance of these developments to the delivery
system of justice cannot be ignored. They have
revolutionized our judicial jurisprudence and will
go a long way in giving relief to the large masses
and the common man. Efforts of the superior
courts of the country to provide new contents to
criminal justice have also resulted in paradigm
shifts in prison reforms, treatment of under-trials,
and rehabilitation of victims.

Introduction

Japanese anthropologist Tamotsu Aoki
(
1999
)
has pointed out that the whole Asian region
shares one common trait: its time. Indeed, in
his book
Asia dilemma
, he argues that the ideal
generalization of “Asia” is only an illusion.
The de
ﬁ
nition and concept of any speci
ﬁ
c
region is
ﬂ
uid and historically constructed,
especially by those in power. This argument is
related to the prevalent characterization of the
“Orient” proffered by Edward Said
(
1979
)
,
after which the word “Orient” has become
commonly regarded as prejudiced, having been
generated by dominant power and reverie in
early-modern Europe.

However, from an anthropological standpoint,
Aoki
(
1999
) has noted that we can, in fact,
observe “four types of time”
ﬂ
owing simultane-
ously throughout the Asian region: “indigenous,”
“Asian,” “historical,” and “contemporary.” First,
we
ﬁ
nd each native culture includes classically
observed languages and religions (such as vari-
ants of animism) in every part of the Asian
region, cultures which Aoki has described as
re
ﬂ
ecting an “indigenous” time. Second, the
ancient Chinese and Indian civilizations strongly
in
ﬂ
uenced the entire Asian region, and through
this we can identify the inheritance of an “Asian”
time. Although the extent of in
ﬂ
uence from each
civilization differs in different areas of this region,
the existence of this in
ﬂ
uence is common to all
areas. Third, in early-modern times, Western
European countries took over and colonized
almost all parts of the Asian region. Through that
period of time, the impact of Western European
civilization extended throughout this region.
Moreover, this shared historical experience con-
tributed to the emergence of the generalization of
the ideal of “Asia.” Aoki has mentioned that a
consequent “historical” time is common to this
region. This type of time includes the pre-modern
times speci
ﬁ
c to each part of the Asian region, as
well as modern times, and thus it also generates
the differences in social institutions and ethos
between different regional areas. Fourth, we live
in a contemporary time as well. In this time, all of
us are faced with progress from urbanization,
industrialization, informatization, technologiza-
tion, and consumer society. American cultures,
among others, have held great signi
ﬁ
cance in the
Asian region.

These “four types of time” pass simultane-
ously in the Asian region in general, and they can
be found in Japanese society as well. But they do
not
ﬂ
ow homogeneously in all of Asia, but rather
the particular way they
ﬂ
ow varies according to
the societies that experience them. According to
Aoki
(
1999
, p. 85), in Japan the fourth time,
which is mixing curiously with the third time, is
beginning to cover the entire society. Nonetheless,

Diversity Within an Asian Country:
Japanese Criminal Justice and
Criminology

the
ﬁ
rst and second times are also still
ﬂ
owing
there.

We can examine general trends in criminal
justice and criminology in Asia following this
anthropological notion. Of course, this viewpoint
is also applicable to the nature of criminal justice
and the ways of understanding crime phenomena,
including criminological perspectives, in the par-
ticular case of Japan. In discussing the signi
ﬁ
cance
of Asian criminology, a key feature of Asian culture
is described as diversity (Liu
2009
)
. Language,
religion, family structure, and other cultural ele-
ments vary greatly in Asian societies. We will see
that this diversity also exists in the nature of
criminal justice and the ways of understanding
crime phenomena in Japan, based on the view-
point presented above.

In this chapter, according to the above-men-
tioned “four types of time,” we will examine
Japanese criminal justice and criminology from a
historical perspective from four angles. First, in
Japan, the legal consciousness connected to
native laws underlies the present criminal justice
system and the legal notions in these laws leave
their mark on the understanding of crime phe-
nomena. Second, in ancient Japan, after the
period of native laws, penal codes and other legal
systems were imported mainly from China and
incorporated into Japanese society. The traits that
emerged in those years also remain in current
criminal justice in Japan. Third, after the penal
codes modeled after those of China developed
independently and strayed from the original style
over time, in the process of modernization that
had started at about 150 ago, the government
transplanted the Western European criminal
laws and social sciences into Japan. This formed
a foundation for present-day criminal justice
and criminology. Fourth, in contemporary
Japan, since the end of World War II, criminal
justice and criminology have become highly
Americanized.

Considering this four-part division of time, in
Sect.
14.2
, the legal consciousness connected
with native laws and the legal notion of these
laws will be examined. Moreover, we will ana-
lyze the history of the import of Chinese penal
codes and their original development, and show
its in
ﬂ
uence on the current criminal justice in
Japan. Next, in Sect.
14.3
, we will probe into the
process and effects of the transplantation of the
modern Western European criminal laws and
social sciences into Japan. After that, in Sect.
14.4
,
we will examine criminal justice system and
criminological thoughts in the post-World War
II Japan, characteristics of crime phenomena in
its society, and then the contemporary altera-
tion of criminal justice policy since the dawn of
a new millennium. Finally, in the conclusion in
Sect.
14.5
, it will be argued that both the crimi-
nal justice system and criminological ideolo-
gies in an Asian country such as Japan are
diverse enough to achieve dynamic internal
development.


14.2

Chinese Penal Codes and Their
Original Development in Japan

The Eastern area of the Eurasian continent and
the surrounding islands, including Japan, has
been called the “Far East” (of course, this is
appropriate only if it is viewed from a European
or American point of view). Geographically,
Japan is located at the end of the Asian region,
or even at the end of the world. Therefore, his-
torically, the “waves” of civilizations around the
world had
ﬁ
nally reached that end—Japan. It
has been said that, due to this geographical situ-
ation, the Japanese have a tendency to respect
foreign cultures. In ancient times, the ancient
Chinese and Indian civilizations were universal
throughout the Asian region. They extended into
every part of this region, which had also pos-
sessed many other native cultures. These civili-
zations
ﬁ
nally found their way into Japan as
well and took root in Japanese soil. At the begin-
ning of this section, we will discuss the native
cultures in Japan. According to the above-men-
tioned division of the “four types of time,” this
sort of culture represents the “indigenous” time.
After this discussion, the in
ﬂ
uence of the
Chinese and Indian civilizations on Japan will
be examined. The legacies of these civilizations
correspond to the “Asian” time. Finally, we
will describe the unique developments of these


215
14 Diversity Within an Asian Country: Japanese Criminal Justice and Criminology
civilizations in Japan. The heritage of these
developments can be categorized as a part of the
“historical” time.

14.2.1
Japanese Indigenous Time

In Japan, native laws were rooted in a Japanese
religion that evolved out of animism: Shintoism.
Thus, criminal law and Shintoism were uni
ﬁ
ed in
archaic Japanese society. The Japanese term

tsumi “crime” is derived from the expression

tsutsumu mi “wrapping what you really are.” In
Shintoism, it is believed that the real nature of
humans is good and innocent, such that any
tsumi
that has been perpetrated veils the good and inno-
cent human nature of the perpetrator. Therefore,
it is thought that, through some Shinto rituals,
like
misogi (a puri
ﬁ
cation rite), the
tsumi can be
cleared. Interestingly, in Japan, white-collar
criminals, especially corrupt politicians, often
receive people’s forgiveness through a variation
of this
misogi ritual. Apparently, this religious
ethos can be seen in the traditional Japanese ten-
dency to reincorporate ex-criminals into society,
which contrasts considerably with the exclusion-
ary stigmatization of and discrimination against
ex-criminals in societies that have developed high
common crime rates.

14.2.2
Japanese Asian Time

In ancient Japan, since around the
ﬁ
fth century,
foreign religions were gradually imported from
the continent through Korea. Among these,
Buddhism
and
Confucianism
were
most
in
ﬂ
uential. For instance, Buddhism provides the
Japanese with the notion of the
inga-ouhou “kar-
mic backlash,” and Confucianism furnishes the
Japanese with the theoretical grounds for the
view of human nature as being fundamentally
good.

In the seventh century, the Chinese legal sys-
tem was very much on the cutting-edge in the
Asian region. Therefore, the Japanese govern-
ment tried to import Chinese laws with the help
of dynasties in China. Chinese penal codes were
introduced into Japan, and in 702, Japanese
penal codes modeled after the Chinese codes
were put into effect. Interestingly, however,
compared with the original penal codes in China,
punishment in Japan’s codes was relatively
lenient.


14.2.3
Japanese Historical Time

After the importation of the Chinese penal codes,
Japanese criminal laws developed almost inde-
pendently. Nonetheless, we can observe the exis-
tence of in
ﬂ
uence from foreign countries,
especially China, Korea, and some Western
European countries. This in
ﬂ
uence was exerted
on Japan in a wave-like fashion. According to
Aoki
(
1999
)
, this period of time can be classi
ﬁ
ed
as “historical” time.

In 1639, the government implemented a
national isolation policy (except foreign com-
merce with China and the Netherlands, and
political exchange with Korea). During the Edo
era (1603–1867), unique criminal laws were
further developed. Early in the Edo era, the
government attached importance to general
prevention (or deterrence) through punishment.
However, the government’s attitude toward
punishment gradually changed. The govern-
ment established the
Kujikata Osadamegaki
(the law code of the Edo era) in 1742. As a part
of the
Kujikata Osadamegaki
, the
Osadamegaki-
Hyakkajo (the second volume of the law code
of the Edo era) included provisions for law-
suits, trials, and punishment. The government
codi
ﬁ
ed judicial precedents of criminal cases
and framed this code. After this period of
codi
ﬁ
cation, the government came to think
more highly of the notion of special prevention
(or rehabilitation) as the function of punish-
ment. In 1790, for those who were homeless
and had criminal tendencies, a vocational train-
ing facility was built in Ishikawa-jima (a water-
front area facing Tokyo Bay). This is regarded
as the beginning of institutional treatment in
Japan and this period might have shown the

ﬁ
rst emergence of spontaneous modernization
in this country.

14.3

Modernization and Western
Criminal Laws

In the middle of the nineteenth century, Japanese
society encountered the billow of modern
European civilization, after which the new gov-
ernment actively advanced modernization of the
society. In this section, we will discuss this mod-
ern time, or the “Western European” time. We
can classify this period into a part of the “histori-
cal” time, elements of which were already dis-
cussed in Sect.
14.2.3
.

During this period, Japanese criminal justice
was in
ﬂ
uenced by many countries. At the begin-
ning of modern era, the government laid down
the Rule of Prison of 1872, which was in line
with traditional ideologies. Although government
of
ﬁ
cials had inspected prisons in the British colo-
nies in the Asian region, such as Hong Kong and
Singapore, and established this rule, this rule’s
stipulations are also clearly in
ﬂ
uenced by Chinese
law. This rule was grounded in the spirit of
Confucianism, which encouraged practices such
as benevolence, and began by declaring the
importance of the humanitarian treatment of
offenders in prison.

Next, the government introduced French laws,
which were based upon the Napoleonic Code,
into Japanese society. Following these laws, the
Penal Code of 1880, the Codes of Criminal
Procedure of 1880 and 1890, and other laws were
established. Nonetheless, the individualism of
the French laws was considered extreme for
Japanese society, and the laws grounded on this
principle were
ﬁ
ercely criticized by scholars and
legislators. At this point, the government decided
to adopt German laws, and the Penal Code of
1907, the Code of Criminal Procedure of 1922,
the Prison Law of 1908, and other laws that fol-
lowed German laws were established. After that,
the government continued to prepare modern
laws, including the Juvenile Act of 1922, making
allowances for foreign legal systems.

At that time, “criminal policy,” one discipline
of law, was mainly adopted for understanding
crime phenomena, in place of “criminology.”
This legal approach was closely connected to the
disciplines of criminal substantive and procedural
laws. Furthermore, in the early twentieth century,
psychiatric approaches, such as forensic psychia-
try, were also adopted in academic circles. For
instance,
the
Japanese
Association
of
Criminology,
founded in 1913 and still in existence today, was
grounded in this approach. Following such
approaches, a sociological criminology literature
emerged in Japan.

14.4

Crime, Criminal Justice, and
Criminology in Contemporary
Japan

14.4.1
Americanization of Criminal
Justice and Criminology

In the history of Japanese criminology, the
“Susuki versus Tokoro” academic controversy
over methodology in 1970s has been regarded as
momentous, radical, and signi
ﬁ
cant for the disci-
plines of “criminal policy” and “criminology”
(Ishizuka
1996
)
. In articles published in academic
journals, two legal professors, Shuichi Susuki

(
1970
) and Kazuhiko Tokoro
(
1970
)
, heatedly
debated how we should comprehend the relation-
ship between the two disciplines. This debate
was related to the understanding of the relation-
ship between jurisprudence (a sort of dogmatics)
and the social sciences.

In his textbook, Susuki
(
1969
) has claimed
that each of these disciplines is perfectly inde-
pendent. He emphasizes the strict division
between the “norm” and the “fact,” where the
prescriptive statement is fully separated from the
descriptive one. Therefore, value judgments on
criminal policy cannot be directly derived from
the facts as illuminated through criminological
research. In the theory of criminal policy, our
judgments of value cannot be chosen, but only be
based upon our legal and social value system.
Susuki was apparently conscious of the
signi
ﬁ
cance of the notion of
Wertfreiheit “value-
freedom” in the social sciences, which was advo-
cated by Max Weber (1918/
1988
)
.

In contrast, Tokoro insisted that we should not
separate these two disciplines and that we can


217
14 Diversity Within an Asian Country: Japanese Criminal Justice and Criminology
consider the two disciplines of “criminal policy”
and “criminology” comprehensively. Thus, sim-
ply on the basis of the facts discovered through
criminological inquiry, we can make a normative
decision and present an ideal alternative in our
discussion of criminal policy.

Indeed, this controversy re
ﬂ
ects a greater
con
ﬂ
ict between the European-style “criminal
policy (
Kriminalpolitik
)” discipline and the
American-style discipline of “criminology,” par-
ticularly “sociological criminology.” After World
War
II,
Japanese
society
faced
the
Americanization
of cultures. We can see this period as a contem-
porary time, or an “American” time. Japanese
society has accepted Americanization for more
than half a century and is currently part of global
and universal cultures.

This process can be seen in the legal system as
well. In
ﬂ
uenced by American laws, the govern-
ment enacted the Code of Criminal Procedure of
1948 and the Juvenile Act of 1948, and partly
revised the Penal Code of 1907. The enactment
and revision were conducted under the new
Japanese Constitution, which emphasizes due
process of law and the individual instead of the
nation.

However, due to the historical layering
described above, these criminal laws and crimi-
nal procedure laws can, in fact, be at odds with
each other. The current Penal Code has been uti-
lized since its establishment in 1907. In this
Japanese criminal law, derived from Germany’s
legal system, subjective elements (e.g., criminal
intent) are emphasized. In contrast, objective ele-
ments (e.g., physical evidence) are intrinsically
stressed in the Japanese criminal procedure law,
which was derived from the legal system of the
United States.

Legal professor Koya Matsuo has cited “min-
ute justice” as a characteristic of Japanese crimi-
nal justice (Matsuo
1994
)
. In the criminal
procedure of Japan, every party involved strongly
desires to elucidate the truth of the case in ques-
tion. It is believed that the elucidation of the truth
through scrupulous examination and the defen-
dant’s confession of his/her guilt is at the core of
a criminal trial. In the process of criminal investi-
gation in Japan, law enforcement agencies take
on exhaustive criminal investigations, which
depend chie
ﬂ
y upon interrogations. Moreover,
the clearance rate for crimes seems to be rela-
tively high: 51.7% for penal code offenses in
2009 (Research and Training Institute, Ministry
of Justice
2010
)
. In Japan, this rate refers to the
percentage of cases referred to public prosecutors
or disposed as trivial offenses by the police or
other investigative authorities, given the number
of reported cases.

In contrast, in the criminal trial process, it
should be noted that the rate of judgment of not
guilty is extremely low. In fact, that rate was only
0.01% in 2009 (Research and Training Institute,
Ministry of Justice
2010
)
. The reasons for this
extremely low rate are often questioned and criti-
cized by foreign researchers. The background
behind this at
ﬁ
rst shocking number is the high
rate of suspension of prosecutions by public pros-
ecutors; 52.1% of persons
ﬁ
nally disposed in
public prosecutor’s of
ﬁ
ces in 2009 (Research and
Training Institute, Ministry of Justice
2010
)
.
Public prosecutors have enormous power in the
Japanese criminal justice system, and they can
exercise considerable discretion in choosing
whether they prosecute a criminal or not. In fact,
they prosecute only the accused who they are

ﬁ
rmly convinced must be convicted and pun-
ished. Most of the accused can escape from pros-
ecution, even if there is suf
ﬁ
cient evidence to
prove their guilt. Sociologist David T. Johnson

(
2002
) noted that suspension of prosecution
“does
ﬁ
t well with other features of Japanese cul-
ture, especially the propensity for wrongdoers to
confess and the disposition to believe that people
are ‘perfectible’ through social engineering” (p.
108). Thus, the Japanese criminal justice system
has been characterized as “prosecutorial justice”
(Mitsui
1980
)
. Nonetheless, this considerable
power triggered a shameful scandal in 2010 (The
Asahi Shimbun
2010
) in which organized evi-
dence tampering by public prosecutors was
detected. After this incident, reforms of the pub-
lic prosecutor’s of
ﬁ
ce have begun in Japan.

On top of the high rate of prosecution suspension,
we also
ﬁ
nd that the rate of suspension of sen-
tence execution is also high. In 2009, suspended
execution rates were 58.0% for imprisonment


218
T. Konishi
with labor for a limited term and 94.3% for
imprisonment without labor for a limited term
(Research and Training Institute, Ministry of
Justice
2010
)
. In this manner, there is a variety of
diversion paths in the Japanese criminal justice
system (Fig.
14.1
). In light of these possibilities,
Daniel H. Foote
(
1992
) has characterized the
Japanese criminal justice as a kind of “benevo-
lent paternalism.”

Alongside the development of this uniquely
Japanese criminal justice system after World War
II, Japan also developed its own literature in
criminology. The national research institutes
related to criminology, such as the National
Research Institute of Police Science at the
National Police Agency and the Research and
Training Institute at the Ministry of Justice, estab-
lished in post-war Japan, have played an impor-
tant role in the criminological academe. These
institutes’ researchers have effectively learned
American criminology and presented it to aca-
demic society in Japan.

After World War II, psychological and socio-
logical approaches to understanding crime phe-
nomena became prepotent in Japan, prompting
the formation of the Japanese Association of
Criminal Psychology in 1963 and the Japanese
Association of Sociological Criminology in 1974.
Japanese psychological and sociological research-
ers have tried to apply American theories to
crimes and society in Japan with American meth-
ods. Interestingly, however, in contrast to
American criminologists, most of whom hold
degrees in behavioral sciences such as psychol-
ogy and sociology, most Japanese “criminolo-
gists” have graduated from and belong to schools
of law. This further re
ﬂ
ects the dilemma between
the European-style “criminal policy” discipline
and American-style “criminology.”

14.4.2
Crime in Post-war Japan

If we turn our attention to the characteristics of
crime in Japan, we
ﬁ
nd that foreign researchers
have generally been interested in the low com-
mon crime rate in post-war industrialized
Japanese society. As Pontell and Geis
(
2007
)
noted, the “low crime rate in postwar World War
II Japan has challenged the interpretative skills of
a considerable cadre of western analysts and
brought into question many conditions usually
positively correlated with crime” (p. 103). In fact,
compared to the number of reported cases, crime
rates, and clearance rates for homicide and theft
in
ﬁ
ve major industrialized countries—Japan,
France, Germany, the UK, and the US—the rates
in Japan are the lowest, as seen in Table
14.1
. Of
course, the de
ﬁ
nitions constituting these rates do
not correspond exactly among these countries, so
this comparison is not as accurate as one would
hope.


It has been thought that people control them-
selves informally and thereby reduce the inci-
dence of crime in Japanese society. Referring to
the high level of interdependence and the highly

developed communitarian ideal in Japan, John
Braithwaite
(
1989
) has proposed a model strat-
egy for crime control. This strategy is called the
reintegrative shaming theory, which proposes
that people can reintegrate a criminal back into
their society through shaming him/her. In the
case of Japan, a spirit of Shintoism lies behind
such an attitude. Thus, some components of
restorative justice seem to have existed originally
in Japanese society. For instance, in Japan, the
role of volunteer probation of
ﬁ
cers is critical in
the community-based treatment of offenders, as
they are important in promoting reconciliation
between ex-criminals and the communities to
which they belong.

Nonetheless, some researchers have also
pointed out that the white-collar crime rate in
Japanese society has the potential to be quite high
(Pontell and Geis
2007
)
. Thus, it is said that there
is “a ubiquitous climate of corruption” in Japan
(Fisher
1980
, p. 222). For example, in Japan it is
common for failing companies to become
involved in window-dressing accounting in order
to avoid bankruptcy (Konishi
2010
)
. The history
of corporate accounting scandals in Japan after
World War II can be divided into three periods:
“the ‘normalization’ of window-dressing account-
ing up to the 1960s, their ‘enlargement’ in the
1970s and 1980s, and the ‘diversi
ﬁ
cation of pur-
pose’ of window-dressing accounting after the
1990s” (Konishi
2010
, p. 101; Suda
2007
)
.

Recently, the government and scholars alike
have sought to lower the high re-imprisonment
rate. The rate of re-imprisonment within 10 years
of release from prison was 53.6% in 2009
(Research and Training Institute, Ministry of
Justice
2010
)
. Most inmates who are re-impris-
oned have committed theft or violated controlled
substances regulations; in Japan, the main drug
offense is the illegal use and distribution of meth-
amphetamine. Therefore, the most problematic
illegal drug type in Japan is different from many
other countries, and we must devise and develop
more effective therapeutic methods for metham-
phetamine-dependent offenders.

Elderly and intellectually disabled people
have turned out to make up a signi
ﬁ
cant portion
of the offenders who committed theft. Families
and communities are said to be losing the tradi-
tional strong bonds in contemporary Japanese
society. As a result, crimes by elderly people are
sharply increasing. Some prisons in Japan look
like nursing homes. Thus, building up closer con-
nections between the criminal justice system and
social welfare is indispensable. It may be neces-
sary to establish a diversion program targeted at
elderly and intellectually disabled criminals in
the criminal justice system. Through this pro-
gram, they could be diverted from the criminal
justice system in its investigation, prosecution, or
court processes and instead treated within the
social welfare system.

14.4.3
Altering Legislative Policies on
Crime and Punishment

Prominent Japanese law professor Koya Matsuo

(
1981
) once imagined criminal justice policy in
Japan as analogous to a mythical world in ancient
Egypt: “while the legislator keeps silent as if it
were a pyramid, the judiciary rouses up as if it
were a sphinx.” As suggested by this remark,
criminal legislation in Japan has been sluggish
for a number of years. Instead, courts have con-
tributed to rule-making or even policymaking
through the formation of precedents.

For example, the Supreme Court standardized
the application of the death penalty through the
formation of precedents. In Japanese criminal
law, judges are given broad latitude in sentencing
and there is no codi
ﬁ
ed guiding principle, such as
sentencing guidelines. The Supreme Court’s
decision on the Nagayama case in 1983, among
others, is well known as a signi
ﬁ
cant judicial
precedent for the application standard for the
death penalty. In this decision, indifferent to pub-
lic opinion, the Supreme Court made the standard
relatively restrained. Consequently, in accordance
with this standard, the courts have thoroughly
taken into account matters favorable to the
accused in subsequent capital cases and thereby
controlled the number of capital sentences.

In another example, the Juvenile Act of 1948
contains the concept of the “pre-delinquent juve-
nile” (Konishi
2007
)
. However, this concept is
highly ambiguous, and the courts have applied
this concept to juvenile cases in a very limited
way. On the other hand, for more than half a cen-
tury, lawmakers have not attempted to rede
ﬁ
ne its
meaning through any revision of the Juvenile
Act.

Despite these setbacks, criminal legislation
has been actively created in Japan since around
the turn of the twenty-
ﬁ
rst century. Public opin-
ion has brought powerful direct pressure on crim-
inal justice policy in Japan since the late twentieth
century. As a result, punishment and other sanc-
tions against criminals have gotten harsher in
criminal legislation and judgment. Recently,
criminal legislation has advanced impressively.
The Penal Code, the Code of Criminal Procedure,
and the Juvenile Act were all revised to a large
extent. In 2010, for instance, the limitation on
prosecution of the crimes in which a person is
killed in the Code of Criminal Procedure and the
limitation on punishment in the Penal Code were
both revised. Through these revisions, parts of
the limitations on prosecution and punishment
were abolished. New basic laws concerning the
treatment of offenders in institutions and com-
munities—the Act on Penal Detention Facilities
and Treatment of Inmates and Detainees and the
Offenders Rehabilitation Act—were enacted in
2006 and 2007.

Like in other countries, we can observe
a “penal populism” (Pratt
2007
)
, or a populist
criminal policy, in Japan. Behind the scenes,
there are a variety of factors, such as the develop-
ment of information technologies and the decline
of the status of professionals on crime. Salient
criminal cases, in particular, have had a vast
impact on speed-before-quality legislation. In the
aftermath of these cases, the mass media have
urged legislators toward rapid enactment. As
Stolz
(
2002
) has noted, in symbolic politics,
criminal laws can function symbolically in all
three branches of government. For example,
recently, the number of capital sentences has
increased in Japan. As a result of having come to
care about the “public’s con
ﬁ
dence in the judi-
ciary” (Judicial Reform Council, Cabinet
2001
,
p. 41; General Secretariat, Supreme Court of
Japan
2008
)
, the courts appear to have twisted the
application standard of the death penalty, which
had been established through the foregoing
Supreme Court’s decision. The courts seek to
earn the “public’s con
ﬁ
dence in the judiciary”
through responding to the public’s request for
more severe punishments and more death
sentences.

As one of the background factors in this dras-
tic change, there has been a mobilization of the
victim’s rights movement in Japanese society. In
Japan, victimology attracted public attention
throughout the 1990s. In 1990, the academic
society of victimology, the Japanese Association
of Victimology, was founded, and the National
Association of Crime Victims and Surviving
Families was created in 2000.


221
14 Diversity Within an Asian Country: Japanese Criminal Justice and Criminology

Moreover, the public has come to play a
signi
ﬁ
cant role in the Japanese criminal justice
system, as public opinion has a continuous and
potent in
ﬂ
uence on criminal justice. Currently,
people can participate directly in criminal proce-
dures. The lay judge system started in 2009. That
same year, the Committees for the Inquest of
Prosecution, which consists of ordinary citizens,
obtained the power to prosecute criminals whose
cases have been dropped by a public prosecutor.
In addition, since 2008, victims or their family
members can participate in trial proceedings. In
these ways, public opinion and the citizens’
movement of crime victims and their family
members have wielded powerful direct in
ﬂ
uence
over criminal justice policy in Japan.

14.5

Conclusion

We can describe the above-mentioned phenom-
ena in Japanese criminal justice and criminol-
ogy as a “multilayered history.” Through this
type of history, a variety of experiences and
values have accumulated in Japanese society.
Of course, such an accumulation of different
experiences and values can include internal
con
ﬂ
ict. This is what makes a dynamic and
engaged society.

Recently, criminologists have been paying
keen attention to Asian criminology (Liu
2009
)
.
Japan is positioned as a part of Asia; this, Japanese
criminology can be examined as a part of Asian
criminology, which is rich in its diversity and
contains all of the necessary dynamics for further
development.

15.1

Development of Criminology
Before the World War II

In Japan, psychiatrists took the initiative in the
development of criminology and forensic medi-
cine. The leading psychiatrist was Shufu
Yoshimasu (1899–1974). He studied under the
guidance of Shuzo Kure, a professor of Tokyo
Imperial University (current Tokyo University),
and worked as a psychiatric researcher at a prison.
He carried out research on twin criminals from
the viewpoint of eugenics after the example of
the research by Johannes Lange (1891–1938). He
invented a table to describe criminal career of
each criminal by a curved line. As he became a
professor of Tokyo University, many young able
psychiatrists were interested in criminology, one
of whom was Osamu Nakata.

Tanemoto Furuhata (1891–1975) graduated
from the Faculty of Medicine at Tokyo Imperial
University, and became a professor at Kanazawa
Medical College in 1923. Three years later he
founded
the
Kanazawa
Association
of
Criminology. Under his leadership this associa-
tion developed. As the association covered the
country, in 1928 it was renamed the Japanese
Association of Criminology.

In 1936 the Japanese Government concluded a
treaty with the Nazi Government in Germany to
prevent communism. In 1940 Japan enacted the
National Eugenic Law to sterilize a person with
bad inheritance compulsorily after the example of
that proclaimed in 1933 in Germany, although
Japan did not carry out the operation for compul-
sory sterilization frequently as in Germany
(Yokoyama
1991
, p. 7). Under this law, criminol-
ogy from the viewpoint of eugenics was prevalent
before the World War II. Even after the war many
leading members of the Japanese Association of
Criminology has been psychiatrists, although
denying involvement in compulsory sterilization
of a criminal with a bad inheritance.
1


In the United States criminology was developed
mainly by sociologists before World War II. In
Japan sociology was often misunderstood as a kind
of socialism and communism, which the Japanese
Government suppressed severely under the Law to
Maintain Public Order of 1925. Therefore, Japanese
sociologists were not interested in the
ﬁ
eld research
from the viewpoint of criminology like in the
United States.

In the place of the National Eugenic Law the Eugenic
Protection Law was proclaimed in 1948, of which the
main purpose was to suppress the birth of a baby with bad
inheritance. To change the purpose to the protection of
mother’s body at her pregnancy and parturition, this law
was renamed the Mother’s Body Protection Law in 1996,
under which the idea of compulsory sterilization from the
viewpoint of eugenics was denied.

the theories on sociology developed in European
countries, especially Germany.

Around 1922 Shotaro Yoneda, a sociologist,
introduced the theory on criminology advocated
by Emile Durkheim, and analyzed female shop-
lifters and the intellectually handicapped crimi-
nals (Iwai et al.
1975
, p. 203).

In Japan criminology from sociological per-
spectives has been called sociological criminol-
ogy. The
ﬁ
rst book entitled “Sociological
Criminology” was written by Jyunko Tatsumizu
in 1922 (Iwai et al.
1975
, p. 203). A book enti-
tled Sociological Criminology written by Enrico
Ferri, a criminologist in Italian Positivism
School, was translated by Kichihiko Yamada
and published in 1923. Since then the term
sociological criminology has been used in
Japan.


15.2

Introduction of Sociology from
the United States Soon After
World War II

After the
ﬁ
nish of the war in August in 1945
Japan was democratized under the guidance of
the Allied Powers, in which the United States
took the initiative. With democratization the
freedom to study and research was completely
guaranteed, under which sociological study
has developed. Many scholars began to learn
sociology and criminology as it had developed
in the western countries, especially the United
Sates. Translations of books on sociology and
criminology into Japanese were commonplace.
These translated books were helpful for young
scholars to study sociology and criminology.


15.3

Development of Sociological
Criminology After World War II

Soon after the war Japanese lived in a chaotic
society, where we suffered absolute poverty.
There were many property crimes owing to the
poverty especially in cities, where black mar-
kets appeared to supply many goods, even daily
living necessaries. Many poor women became
prostitutes soliciting on the street
3
. By the use
of
violence to maintain order in a chaotic area,
Boryokudan, that is, Japanese ma
ﬁ
a groups,
developed (Yokoyama
1999
, p.138).

To analyze social problems at that time, Tatsuo
Takenaka carried out research on prostitution, the
result of which was published in 1949. Hiroaki
Iwai researched on activities of Tekiya, the street
stalls, one kind of Boryokudan. His report was
published in Shakaigaku Hyoron, a journal of the
Japan Sociological Society, Vol. 1, No. 1 in 1950.
His
famous
book
entitled
“Structure
of
Pathological Groups” was published in 1963.

In such a context sociologists became inter-
ested in research on crimes. Then, a session on
“Issues of Sociological Criminology” was held
for the
ﬁ
rst time at the annual meeting of the
Japan Sociological Society in 1951.

15.4

Researches on Juvenile
Delinquency Under the New
Juvenile Justice System

Soon after the war we witnessed many poor juve-
niles, especially orphans, committing crimes
(Yokoyama
2002
, p. 329). Many sociologists
began to be interested in phenomena of juvenile
delinquency as the serious social problem.

In 1948 the new Juvenile Law was enacted, under
which a family court and the Juvenile Classi
ﬁ
cation
and Detention Center were introduced. The next
year the Law for Prevention and Rehabilitation of
Criminals was proclaimed, by which the system of
probation and parole was de
ﬁ
ned. Then, the current
juvenile justice system was established.

After the establishment of this system many of
those who learned sociology and behavioral sci-
ences became probation of
ﬁ
cers at the family court,
specialists in researching juvenile’s disposition, and
probation and parole of
ﬁ
cers af
ﬁ
liated with the
Ministry of Justice. Together with such specialists,
sociologists developed sociological criminology.

3
The Prostitution Prevention Law was enacted in 1958 by
the initiative of female Diet members (Yokoyama
1993
)
.
After the enforcement of this law prostitutes soliciting on
the street ended, because the solicitation on the street was
criminalized (Yokoyama
1995
, p. 50).


225
15 Development of Criminology in Japan from a Sociological Perspective

Judges at the Supreme Court and family
courts were earnest about realizing purposes
de
ﬁ
ned by the new Juvenile Law of 1948. Under
the aegis of the Supreme Court the Study
Meeting on Protection of Youngsters was orga-
nized in 1951, in which such sociologists as
Koji Kashikuma, Kizaemon Ariga, Tatsumi
Makino, and Hiroaki Iwai participated (Iwai
et al.
1975
, p. 203). At the same time Tatsumi
Makino, Koji Kashikuma, Hiroaki Iwai, Kosaku
Matsuura, and Soichi Nasu founded the Group
to Study Sociological Criminology, which I also
joined in 1969. At that time many sociologists
researched on juvenile delinquents mainly from
the viewpoint of family background and
community.

A typical research project from the viewpoint
of the community was conducted by Kosaku
Matsuura and Koji Kashikuma. Under their
leadership members of the Group to Study
Sociological Criminology in corporation with
probation of
ﬁ
cers at Tokyo Family Court car-
ried out the research twice to analyze the rela-
tion between juvenile delinquents and the
community. They used a method of dot mapping
after the example of the research on the delin-
quency area by Clifford Shaw and Henry McKay
on the basis of the social disorganization theory.
They researched 7,999 and 15,229 juveniles
whom Tokyo Family Court disposed of in 1953
and in 1956, respectively (Kuroda
1975
, p. 62).
They found that there was no delinquency area
in Tokyo from the viewpoint of juveniles’ resi-
dence. On the other hand, juveniles went to
amusement areas to commit delinquency. Their
research was the
ﬁ
rst full-scale research from
the ecological viewpoint.

At that time the prediction of delinquency
studies drew our attention, because Sheldon
Glueck and Eleanor Glueck published their
social prediction scale for delinquency prone-
ness in 1950. Some Japanese scholars also
tried to evaluate their scale. For the
ﬁ
rst time
in 1954 Tokuhiro Tatezawa began to use this
scale in order to predict juvenile’s delinquency
proneness. The researches by the use of this
scale contributed to the development of statis-
tical methods on criminology in Japan,
although Japanese criminologists and practi-
tioners could not develop the complete scale.

In the late 1950s we enjoyed high economic
growth with modern industrialization. During this
period sociology in
ﬂ
uenced by the United States
developed, while Marxist sociology became popu-
lar under the surge of leftists’ movement, especially
the movement of labor unions. As a kind of branch
of sociology, criminological sociology progressed.

Around 1961 Tatsumi Makino organized the
Study Group on Teaching Youngsters. Under his
guidance some young scholars studying sociological
pedagogy like Kanehiro Hoshino became interested
in issues of juvenile delinquency. They have contrib-
uted to the development of the research on juvenile
delinquency from the sociological viewpoint.


15.5

Development of Two Research
Institutions

In 1948 the Research Institute for Scienti
ﬁ
c
Investigation was established, which was renamed
the National Research Institute of Police Science
in 1959. At the same time the institute founded
two departments, that is, a department for crime
prevention and juveniles and that for traf
ﬁ
c
offenses, in which specialist researchers in behav-
ioral sciences began to work. Researchers such as
Kanehiro Hoshino and Yoshio Matsumoto con-
tributed to the development of sociological
criminology.

The Ministry of Justice had a training insti-
tute for legal affairs, which was renamed the
Total Institute for Legal Affairs in 1959. Not
only public prosecutors but also specialist
of
ﬁ
cers in behavioral sciences working at the
Correction Bureau and the Rehabilitation
Bureau became researchers at the institute.
These researchers carried out the
ﬁ
eld research
at prisons, juvenile training schools, and so on.
They began to publish a White Paper on Crime
in 1960. They contributed to the development of
the
ﬁ
eld research from the sociological
criminology.

cation and Detention Center car-
ried out the case studies. To exchange the results
of their study they organized the Study Group on
Correctional Psychology. Through the initiative
by the main members of the Study Group on
Correctional
Psychology
the
Japanese
Association
of Criminal Psychology was founded in 1962.
Some sociologists also joined JACP. JACP has
contributed to the development of psychology in
the
ﬁ
eld of screening, classifying criminals and
juvenile delinquents, and developing the treat-
ment programs for inmates in a prison and a juve-
nile training school.

Establishment of Japanese
Association of Sociological
Criminology in 1974

In Japan, scholars in criminal law have been
interested in the legal theory in Germany.
However, Riyuichi Hirano and Kazuhiko Tokoro
advocated analyzing criminal law from the view-
point of “function” after the example of criminol-
ogy in the United States. To facilitate the analysis
from the functional viewpoint, they translated a
book on “Principle of Criminology (6th Edition)”
written by Edwin Sutherland and Donald Cressey
into Japanese, and published it in 1962.

Hiroaki
Iwai
wrote
a
book
entitled
“Sociological Criminology,” and published it in
1964. Katsuhiko Nishimura translated George B.
Vold’s “Theoretical Criminology,” and published
it in 1970. These three books contributed to the
understanding of theories on criminology from
the sociological viewpoint.

Soichi Nasu and Jyuzaburo Hashimoto edited
a book entitled “Sociological Criminology,” and
published it in 1968. In such a situation the term
“Sociological Criminology” became gradually
known among scholars in contrast to criminal
psychology. Then, by the suggestion of Ryuichi
Hirano members of the Group to Study
Sociological Criminology decided to found
the
Japanese
Association
of
Sociological
Criminology. The
ﬁ
rst meeting of JASC was
held in December in 1974.
4 Total number of
members of JASC amounted to about 350, of
which a half was specialists in behavioral sci-
ences including sociology and another half was
scholars in criminal law.


15.8

Activities of the Japanese
Association of Sociological
Criminology

Fifteen leading members of Japanese Association
of Sociological Criminology wrote a compact
textbook entitled “Sociological Criminology,”
and published it as the book edited by the asso-
ciation in 1975. The publication of this textbook
contributed to the understanding of nature of
sociological criminology.

JASC began to publish its formal journal

entitled “Japanese Journal of Sociological
Criminology” in 1976. The title of the
ﬁ
rst spe-
cial feature in the Volume 1 of JJSC was
“Problems
and
Method
of
Sociological
Criminology,” on which Hiroaki Iwai, Kanehiro
Hoshino, and Kazuhiko Tokoro submitted their
paper. The second feature was composed of a
topic on “Social Change and Crime Control,” for
which two practitioners and one sociologist wrote
paper.

progress in sociological criminology

ress was analyzed by Masami Yajima
(

First president was Soichi Nasu, my teacher. Second was

With rapid industrialization the social structure changed
drastically. Therefore, at that time the topic on crime con-
trol in the changing society was very important.

6
It is a pity that most of the articles in “Japanese Journal of
Sociological Criminology” are written in Japanese language.

members of JASC for a decade, and that scholars
in law presented paper more actively than in the
earlier period.

15.9

Change in the Theoretical
Focus

Around 1975 the anomie theory advocated by
Robert Merton was popular among young schol-
ars. In the Vol. 1 of JJSC there were two articles,
in which the analysis from the framework of the
anomie theory was used.

In the United States criminologists were inter-
ested in the labeling theory advocated in 1960s.
Then Japanese scholars began to read articles on
the labeling theory written by criminologists.
Several members of JASC including Yoji Morita

(
1977
) and Minoru Yokoyama
(
1978,
1980
) sub-
mitted a manuscript to JJSC.

Naoyuki Murakami translated “Outsiders”
written by Howard S. Becker in 1963 into
Japanese language, and published it in 1978.
Through this translation, Japanese learned the
critical viewpoint in the sociology of deviance,
which attracted the attention of youngsters, espe-
cially those involving in the movement for radi-
cal social change. However, the labeling
perspective, especially that from the critical view-
point was not accepted widely in Japan.

Following the wane of the students’ move-
ment around 1979 the critical viewpoint advo-
cated in the labeling theory was no longer
supported. In its place, since 1980s the frame-
work of the social constructivism and social bond
theory advocated by Travis Hirschi in 1969
became popular.

15.10
Establishment of Japanese
Association of Social Problems
in 1985

Scholars in criminal law who participated in the
activities of JASC were inactive at the time of
foundation of this association. They attended the
annual meeting as a receiver of information on
sociological criminology. However, they suc-
ceeded in understanding the fundamental knowl-
edge of sociological criminology. Then, they
became active members of JASC. On the other
hand, many sociologists were not interested in
discussing issues on criminal policy which schol-
ars in criminal law wanted to research together
with scholars and practitioners in behavioral
sciences.

In such a situation Kaoru Ohash, one of the
in
ﬂ
uential leaders of JASC, decided to found a
new association to promote the study and research
from the viewpoint of social pathology and social
disorganization. Under his initiative the Japanese
Association of Social Problems was established
in 1985. Many sociologists of JASC moved to
JASP, although leading ones in sociological crim-
inology remained in JASC. Since then JASP has
not contributed greatly to the development of
criminology, as members of this association dis-
cuss the phenomenon of crimes only as a part of
social problems.

15.11
Establishment of Japanese
Association of Victimology in
1990

Hans von Hentig published a book entitled “The
Criminal and his Victim” in 1947. In 1956
Benjamin Mendelsohn compiled the research
papers on the relation between offenders and vic-
tims, and systemized them as one research area,
which he called victimology. He sent his paper
on victimology to leading criminologists all over
the world, two of whom were Shufu Yoshimasu
and Tanemoto Furuhata. On the advice from
Shufu Yoshimasu, Osamu Nakata read the article
written by Benjamin Mendelsohn, and published
his article on victimology in 1958. In 1959 he
held a symposium on victimology at his Tokyo
Medical and Dental University with the support
of Shufu Yoshimasu and Tenamoto Furuhata.
Then, the term victimology became popular.

Such scholars in criminal law as Koichi
Miyazawa and Minoru Oya were also interested
in victimology. Koichi Miyazawa published an
article on victimology in 1963 for the
ﬁ
rst time as
a scholar in criminal law. At the beginning he was


228
M. Yokoyama
criticized by scholars in criminal law, because he
was regarded as an advocate for criminalization
in response to the demand of crime victims.
7 It
was not until 1990 that Japanese Association of
Victimology was founded by his initiative. The
inauguration meeting of the association was held
at his Keio University in 1990.

Since the late 1990s the crime victims’ move-
ment surged up. In response to the movement
members of JAV discussed the measures ear-
nestly best to guarantee victims’ rights. They
contributed to establishing and reforming the
legal system for the guarantee of victims’ rights.
On the other hand, they are less interested in
research on the relation between offenders and
victims.

15.12
Current Problems for Young
Criminologists to Get a
University Post

In the United States criminology is an important
academic area. On the other hand, in Japan it is a
minor subject taught at the sociological depart-
ment or the faculty of law at a university.

Japanese have also become conservative since
the breakdown of socialism in Soviet Union and
East European countries. In such an atmosphere
youngsters are more interested in psychology
than sociology, especially from the viewpoint of
critical analysis of social structure. Many univer-
sities begin to close or cut down the departments
of sociology because of the decrease in the num-
ber of young people interested in the area. In
addition, most sociology departments do not have
a full-time professor in criminology. Therefore,
there are fewer youngsters who study criminol-
ogy at the university, especially at graduate school
in Japan.

Some able youngsters go abroad to study
criminology. If they get a doctoral degree in a
foreign university, it is very dif
ﬁ
cult for them to

ﬁ
nd a full-time job as a criminologist in Japan.

At the large-sized university, a professor like
me teaches both criminology and criminal policy
at the faculty of law. Recently, members of the
faulty of law are also curtailed owing to
ﬁ
nancial
dif
ﬁ
culties in a university. Therefore, the univer-
sity refrains from employing a full-time profes-
sor to teach criminology.

I am afraid that able young criminologists,
especially those researching from the viewpoint
may decrease in the near future.

15.13
Researches at Two National
Research Institutes

There are two important national research insti-
tutes, that is, the National Research Institute of
Police Science and the Total Institute for Legal
Affairs of the Ministry of Justice. The current
situation of these institutes is as given below.

Previously, researchers at the National
Research Institute of Police Science had free-
dom to carry out scienti
ﬁ
c research independent
of the policy decided by the National Police
Agency.
8 Therefore, such researchers as Kanehiro
Hoshino and Yoshio Matsumoto
produced excel-
lent achievements by their researches. Nowadays,
the freedom to research is narrowed at NRIPS.
They are requested to conduct research, by
which they contribute to improving the policy by
the National Police Agency. Typical research is
conducted by Yutaka Harada, a director of the
Department on Behavioral Sciences, and some
researchers of his team at NRIPS. They collected
raw crime data from the police and geo-coded
these data on a map using computers. The pur-
pose of
making this neighborhood crime maps is
to
prevent children from being victimized in the

community. The research is highly regarded by
National Police Agency.

7
During the World War II many political criminals were
tortured and treated inhumanly within the criminal justice.
To prevent such inhuman abuse of criminal punishment,
scholars in criminal law opposed criminalization.

8
The National Police Agency has published the White
Paper on Police since 1978. However, researchers of
NRIPS are not responsible for this publication, although
results of their research are sometimes cited in the white
paper.


229
15 Development of Criminology in Japan from a Sociological Perspective

Able correction of
ﬁ
cers and probation and
parole of
ﬁ
cers who have mastered such social sci-
ences as sociology and psychology are assigned to
a position as a researcher at the Total Institute for
Legal Affairs in the Ministry of Justice. Previously,
they conducted much good
ﬁ
eld researches espe-
cially in a prison, a juvenile training school, and a
probation and parole of
ﬁ
ce. By the use of the
framework of criminology they analyzed results of
their researches. Their analysis also has contrib-
uted to the development of criminology.
9


In the Ministry of Justice public prosecutors
have monopolized all important positions, one of
which is a position of the director of TILAMJ. As
elite public prosecutors in the Ministry of Justice do
not regard researchers as true professional crimi-
nologists, they lose freedom to research. They are
obliged to conduct policy-relevant research to con-
tribute to policy effectiveness. Their most important
job is the publication of the White Paper on Crime,
a book for public consumption, in order to let peo-
ple understand the criminal policy of the Ministry
of Justice. In addition, they have gradually lost the
freedom to present papers at the meetings in aca-
demic circles such as the annual meeting of Japanese
Association of Sociological Criminology.
10


15.14
Research Institutes at
University Level

In Japan there are only a few research institutes
on criminology and victimology. The main insti-
tutes are as given below.

Ryukoku University, a private university sup-
ported by temples for Jodoshinshu, a school of
Buddhism, established the Corrections and
Rehabilitation Research Center in 2001.
11 By receiv-
ing funds from the national government and foun-
dations, such professors as Sinichi Ishizuka and
Koichi Hamai have conducted good research. They
tend to analyze data from a critical viewpoint. For
example, Shinich Ishizuka researches on the death
penalty, and criticizes the Japanese Government
policy on the maintenance of the death penalty.

In 2003 Tokiwa International Victimology
Institute was founded at Tokiwa University by
the initiative of Hidemichi Morosawa.
12 At the
institute they conduct international interdisciplin-
ary research and teaching in victimology. The
activities at the institute have contributed to the
progress of victimology and the improvement of
practice for crime victims.

15.15
Insuf
ﬁ
cient Funds and Chances
for the Field Research

In Japan important science research funds are
offered by the Ministry of Education, Culture,
Sports, Science and Technology. The largest
amount of such monies is assigned to the natural
sciences as opposed to the social sciences like
criminology. In such a situation criminologists do
not have suf
ﬁ
cient funding to carry out adequate

ﬁ
eld research.

Recently, younger sociologists give up con-
ducting
ﬁ
eld research. Most of them carry out a
case study by the use of a framework of social
constructivism. Their achievement does not really
contribute to the development of criminology,
because their interpretation is arbitrary and they

9

Researchers at TILAMJ started to publish the White
Paper on Crime in 1960. At the early period they analyzed
data on crimes and criminals as criminologists indepen-
dent from the policy by the Ministry of Justice.

10

Of
ﬁ
cers af
ﬁ
liating with national government and the court
are usually obliged to get permission to present their paper
at the academic circle in advance. Their paper is sometimes
censored by their boss. At the place of interpretation about
data, they have to express that the interpretation is not of
ﬁ
cial
but private one. Especially, the judges at the court who
respect the crime control model impose the strictest pressure
on the family court probation of
ﬁ
cers not to express their
own opinion freely. Under such pressure many probation
of
ﬁ
cers give up to work as a professional case worker for
juvenile’s best interests under the welfare model.


11

The founder of Jodoshinshu was Shinran (1173–1262),
who preached that even criminals are rescued by the mercy
of Buddha. Then, many priests in Jodoshinshu have worked
for rehabilitation of criminals especially as a chaplains.


12
Hidemichi Morosawa, a chairman of directors’ board of
Tokiwa University, studied victimology under the guid-
ance of Koichi Miyazawa at the graduate school of Keio
University.


230
M. Yokoyama
do not offer suggestions for improving the policy
and practice of the criminal justice.

In Japan, public organizations are unwilling
to provide a platform for research by professors
and researches working at an external institute,
because the former do not want to be criticized
on the base of results of the research in order to
maintain their good fame. In addition, it is very
dif
ﬁ
cult for professors and researchers at an
external institute to get permission for their
research from an organization linked to govern-
ment. If such dif
ﬁ
culty continues, the
ﬁ
eld in
criminology will wane.

15.16
Conclusion: Towards a New
Trend

In the current conservative atmosphere and with
sympathy for demands of crime victims the phe-
nomenon of criminalization is growing. Some
criminologists and scholars in criminal law such as
Setsuo Miyazawa and I analyze this phenomenon
from the critical viewpoint.
13 Some analyze it by
the use of the idea of penal populism. In 2009, the
Japanese Association of Sociological Criminology
published a book on “Globalized Penal Populism
and its Countermeasures” edited by Koichi Hamai.
The analysis from the viewpoint of penal popu-
lism will hopefully contribute to the development
of further democratic reform of the policy and
practice within criminal justice in Japan.

With globalization the research and discussion
in the international arena, for example, at the
meetings of the Asian Criminological Society
will be more necessary. However, younger
Japanese criminologists are not active in collab-
orative research together with foreign criminolo-
gists and neither do they attend international
conferences for exchange of ideas. If such a situ-
ation continues, criminology in Japan will not
play its part in the development of any wider
international criminology.

Introduction

On 8th July 2011, the Prime Minister of Malaysia,
Dato’ Seri Mohd Najib bin Tun Haji Abdul
Razak, announced a review of the Malaysian
Criminal Justice System as part of the
Government’s highly publicised “Government
Transformation Programme” and “New Economic
Model” (Of
ﬁ
ce of the Prime Minister of Malaysia

2011
)
. Together with the setting up of a Centre
for Law and International Legal Studies, with an
international faculty, and the prominence given to
criminal justice reform (one of the two initial
research projects), this indicates that crime and
criminal justice have become a political priority
in contemporary Malaysia.

The impetus for this review represents part of
a continuing political, social and economic
transformation begun in 2005 following the
stepping down of former Prime Minister of
Malaysia, Tun Mahathir Mohamed. The follow-
ing chapter provides the backdrop to and details
of this reform process in the context of the
Malaysian Criminal Justice system, as well as
an overview of crime, prosecution and impris-
onment
data. There is a dearth of published
criminal justice research in Malaysia, so it is
hoped that the following chapter will not only
provide an insight for concerned foreign observ-
ers from within the Asia region and beyond but
also act as a primer for local researchers with
active interests in criminal justice.


16.2

Overview of the Malaysian
Criminal Justice System

Malaysia is a federation comprising 13 individual
states and the federal territories of Kuala Lumpur,
Putrajaya and Labuan. Criminal laws are applied
at both federal and state levels, though both have
their particular subject matter and geographical
jurisdictions, with con
ﬂ
icts between federal and
state law resolved in favour of the former. The
Malaysian Penal, Criminal Procedure and
Evidence Codes are
federal law and have general
application, applying to all states and all ethnic
communities. In addition to the Penal Code, there
is also federal legislation related to drugs enforce-
ment (e.g. Dangerous Drugs Act 1952), national
security, immigration, food and health and trans-
port. These general laws are enforced by the
Royal Malaysian Police (PDRM) and prosecuted
(generally) by Deputy Public Prosecutors and
Assistant Public Prosecutors, working under the
auspices of the Attorney General, in federal

courts
1 (Magistrates, Sessions or High Court,
depending on the seriousness of the offence) in
each state.

While the majority of crimes (murder, serious
personal injury, sexual offences, etc.) are regulated
under federal law, there are speci
ﬁ
c Islamic crimes
(“offences against the precepts of Islam”) punished
under
state law though subject to a federal law
cap.
2
So under the Shariah Courts (Criminal
Jurisdiction) Act 1965,
3 federal law prevents state
legislatures from passing
hudud laws,
4 and limits
sentences up to a maximum of 3 years imprison-
ment, RM 5,000
ﬁ
ne, whipping of six strokes of the
rotan or any combination of all three. This aspect of
the Malaysian criminal justice system is becoming
more signi
ﬁ
cant as state religious authorities (such
as JAIS
5
) seek increasingly to enforce Islamic mor-
als and ethics on local Muslims, whether for violat-
ing state rules on unlawful proximity (“khalwat”)
and frequenting discotheques or for drinking alco-
hol.
6 It has also become a matter of concern for
opposition political parties, especially those domi-
nated by non-Muslims, who fear “creeping” expan-
sion of Shariah.
7


Apart from in matters relating to Islamic Law,
8
policing in Malaysia is centralised. A Chief Police
Of
ﬁ
cer is designated for every state and each is
subject to the central authority of the Inspector
General of Police (IGP), appointed by the King
(Yang di-Pertuan Agong), who in turn reports to
the Minister,
9 namely, the Attorney General or the
Prime Minister of the day. Although formally
independent of the federal government, the PDRM
is not subject to local authority police committee
oversight as in the UK (Mawby and Wright
2005
,
4), and disciplines itself.
10 Indeed, demands for
reform in criminal justice, as we shall see, have
tended to focus on the role of the police and to
criticise its apparent function as the “executive
right arm” of the central government.
11


1  Police of
ﬁ
cers of at least the rank of Inspector are allowed
to prosecute (Criminal Procedure Code, section 377(b)
(2)). In Sabah and Sarawak, especially in the more remote
areas, it is not unknown for senior police of
ﬁ
cers to con-
duct prosecutions for less serious offences. In addition to
the police, prosecutors can also be from other enforce-
ment agencies such as Customs and Excise, the Securities
Commission, the Central Bank and the Anti-Corruption
Agency; see Arif

n, Azmi

Malaysia or East Malaysia (Sabah and Sarawak), other

The Ninth Schedule, List II, to the Federal Constitution, in
addition to matters touching on ritual worship, Islamic
trusts and family laws, provides that States have powers to
enact legislation for the “creation and punishment of
offences by persons professing the religion of Islam
against precepts of that religion, except in regards to mat-
ters included in the Federal List”. List II adds that the
Shariah Courts only have jurisdiction over Muslims and
are subject to federal law.

8  Whether the Police should assist the religious authorities
to enforce Islamic law at all because religion is fundamen-
tally a “state” as opposed to a “federal” matter, remains a
problem for the Police (I am grateful to Dr. Khairil Azmin
Mokhtar for this point). Given that the religious authori-
ties should be better trained in “religious” matters, one
might have thought that enforcement should only be the
job of religious of
ﬁ
cers.

Former Prime Minister of Malaysia, Tun Mahathir
Mohamed, has vigorously asserted in his recent autobiogra-
phy, that the Police are independent and on the occasion of
Operation Lalang in 1987, it was
he
who had to follow their
advice; see Mahathir Mohamed
(

the Armed Forces, they are technically independent by their
being placed under the authority of the Malaysian King.

16 Crime and Criminal Justice in Malaysia

The proximity of the central government to
the police is underscored by the fact that ulti-
mately all prosecutions, with the exception of
prosecutions in the Shariah Court, are carried out
under the auspices of the Attorney General, who
is appointed by the King, upon the advice of the
Prime Minister. Technically, he is a public ser-
vant, holding of
ﬁ
ce during the pleasure of the
King (Federal Constitution, Article 145(5)). But
he is also “part and parcel of the government of
the day” (Bari
2008
, 118). Unlike in Australia,
England and Wales, Ireland and South Africa, the
powers of prosecution are not delegated to an
independent Director of Public Prosecutions but
remain vested in the person of the Attorney
General.
12 While this ensures that politically sen-
sitive cases are handled in accordance with the
government’s view of the “public interest”, it also
casts political shadows over certain police opera-
tions, investigations and decisions to prosecute. It
is also true to say, however, that certain prosecu-
tion agencies, such as the Malaysian Anti-
Corruption Commission, retain a high degree of
independence notwithstanding the buck ulti-
mately resting with the Attorney General.

cial crime data but
does not publish these
ﬁ
gures as a matter of
course. Nor is there any Freedom of Information
Act that guarantees a right of access to such
information. Release of information is subject to
the discretion of Bukit Aman, the Headquarters
of the PDRM, and of the Inspector General of
Police in particular. This does not mean that all
matters pertaining to the crime rate in Malaysia
are state secrets. Information is released by the
PDRM periodically through its Public Relations
Department and made available on the PDRM
Web site. Individual researchers (including this
author) are also occasionally given access to
more detailed information. The
ﬁ
gures provided
do not represent a complete breakdown of all of
the different types of crimes committed in
Malaysia, nor of the total amount of crime com-
mitted, but only what is mentioned in the “Crime
Index”. This refers to a limited list of crimes
compiled largely for the purposes of international
comparison. Inspector General Standing Orders
de
ﬁ
ne the “Crime Index” as those crimes
“reported with suf
ﬁ
cient regularity and with
suf
ﬁ
cient signi
ﬁ
cance to be meaningful as an
index to the crime situation”.
14

The most obvious limitation, common to all
countries, is that only “reported” crime is included
within this of
ﬁ
cial index. The actual extent of
crime is unknown (and frequently higher) because
not all crime is reported to the police or other law
enforcement agencies, and of those crimes reported
not all are recorded because of police discretion
(Moshe et al.
2011
, 45–47). But the “dark
ﬁ
gures”,
as they are known, are not illuminated in Malaysia
by additional surveys. There is no Malaysian
equivalent of the government-sponsored British
Crime Survey (BCS) which, for the
ﬁ
rst time in
1982, gathered data nationwide on the incidence
of unrecorded crime, and which has been repli-
cated at regular intervals ever since (Maguire
1997
,
162–163). Nor are the
ﬁ
gures supplemented by
local neighbourhood victim surveys, such as the
Islington Crime Survey (1986), which have been
in
ﬂ
uential in the UK and thrown light on the
uneven distribution of victimisation in local com-
munities, and revealed data normally left untouched
by the national surveys (Maguire,
ibid
, 170–171).
There is even a relative absence of smaller surveys
conducted by academics. Criminology is not a
widely studied discipline in Malaysia and does not
attract the funding it receives in many western
countries. The studies that exist are very limited in
nature and normally conducted as part of a diploma
course in Police Science at the National University
of Malaysia (UKM).

The only national survey on public percep-
tions and experiences of crime in Malaysia was

12  Criminal Procedure Code, section 376(1).

an isolated study conducted by the Royal
Commission as part of its enquiries into the prac-
tices of the PDRM (Royal Commission
2005
)
.
They carried out a survey of public opinion
between 22 November 2004 and 1 December
2004 (Royal Commission
2005
, 60) comprising a
sample of 575 adult respondents from urban areas
in all 13 states of Malaysia and the Federal
Territories, and approximating the ethnic break-
down of the population (43.9% Malay; 32.7%
Chinese; 13.9% Indian). A total of 101 out of the
575 respondents, or 17.6%, reported being vic-
tims of crime. Of those 101 victims, only 76 per-
sons, or 75.3%, reported the incident to the police.
The main reasons for not wanting to make a
report included the trouble in making police
reports and the feeling that the police would not
do anything if they did (Royal Commission

2005
, 60).

Whether this survey gave a more accurate or
valid picture of the true crime situation is doubt-
ful. First, it took place within just over a week
and in the context of a highly controversial Royal
Commission investigating the affairs of the Police
in general, in the immediate aftermath of a gen-
eral election and the freeing from custody of de
facto opposition leader, Anwar Ibrahim. Second,
its surveying sample was relatively small, espe-
cially in comparison with the national surveys
conducted in the UK, and thus arguably unrepre-
sentative. Third, although roughly approximate,
the ethnic pro
ﬁ
les of those interviewed under-
represented Malays and over-represented both
Chinese and Indians in the population (especially
the latter which is less than 8%). Given the PDRM
is predominantly Malay and the existence of eth-
nic chauvinism within local communities, this
had the potential to distort and exaggerate the

ﬁ
ndings.

The national survey conducted by the Royal
Commission has not been repeated, nor have
there been any other surveys to supplement the
recorded crime
ﬁ
gures. The principal reasons
given for the absence of surveying in Malaysia
have been the cost and empirical validity of the
results (Sidhu
2005
, 5). It is certainly true that
national surveys are very expensive operations,
and arguably impractical for a developing coun-
try like Malaysia. Yet if an elaborate Royal
Commission can be set up to look into the affairs
of the police as a whole (and of which the public
surveys formed only a very small part), there is
no reason why a properly structured and indepen-
dent Crime Survey could not be established if the
public policy arguments were convincing.

The second limitation of the Malaysian Crime
Index is that it represents only a small selection
of reported and recorded crime. Not only are reli-
gious crimes, such as “khalwat” (unlawful prox-
imity) and “minum arak” (drinking alcohol),
excluded (though their extent and prosecution are
fast becoming issues in contemporary Malaysia)
because they are handled by different enforce-
ment agencies, but even the majority of the crimes
under the Penal Code are not included. In research
carried out by Sidhu
(
2005
, 8), out of a total num-
ber of 1,797,105 criminal cases reported to the
PDRM, only 156,455 of the cases investigated
(8.7%) were of crimes caught by the Crime Index.
Kidnapping, criminal breach of trust, drug
offences, molestation and outraging modesty, for
example, are all excluded from the list.

While the Malaysian Crime Index has its
shortcomings in showing the total extent of crime,
it nevertheless provides useful data and indicates
trends for some of the most prevalent offences in
Malaysia. The Index is sub-divided into “Violent
Crime” and “Property Crime”. “Violent Crime”
incorporates murder, attempted murder, gang
robbery with
ﬁ
rearms, gang robbery without

ﬁ
rearms, robbery with
ﬁ
rearms, robbery without

ﬁ
rearms, rape and voluntarily causing hurt.
“Property Crime” comprises housebreaking and
theft by day, housebreaking and theft by night,
theft of lorries and vans, theft of motor cars, theft
of motorcycles and scooters, theft of bicycles and
“other forms of theft”. Since 2006, the Crime
Index has also grouped the offences of aggravated
theft, gang robbery without
ﬁ
rearms and robbery
under the category of “street crime” because of
concern expressed by members of the public in
relation to these particular crimes.

The total
ﬁ
gures for these offences between
2000 and 2010 are provided below. For ease of
comparison and because of changes in methods
of of
ﬁ
cial presentation in the crime statistics,


235
16 Crime and Criminal Justice in Malaysia
attempted murder has been removed, and the dif-
ferent offences for robbery given above merged
into one “robbery and violent theft” category.
Although “robbery and violent theft” are techni-
cally “property crimes”, the Crime Index categor-
ises them as offences of violence. The various
types of housebreaking have also been merged
into the single category of “breaking and enter-
ing”, as have the different types of theft into
“theft of motor vehicles and m/cycles”. The
remaining thefts are further differentiated into
“aggravated thefts” and “other thefts”, Fig.
16.1
.

In the last decade, the above table indicates
that although there has been an overall increase
in crime across the different categories, and big
spikes between 2006 and 2009, by the end of
2010, the percentage increase in the Crime
Index was a relatively small 3.27%. Taking into
account increases in population of approxi-
mately 2% per annum, this suggests that the
crime rate has stabilised over the decade. When
we compare with data over a longer period,
however, there has been a large increase in the
reported crime rate, both violent crime and
property crime. Between 1980 and 2004, vio-
lent crime increased by 120% and property
crime by 112% (Sidhu
2005
, 10). Between 2004
and 2010, the
ﬁ
gures had risen by a further 51%
and 3.1%, respectively. While much of this
increase could be put down to the proportionate
increase in Malaysia’s population, which stood
at 13.76 M in 1980 and had risen to 28.23 M by
2010 (Index Mundi), rates per 100,000 of the
population between 1980 and 2004 indicate that
violent crime still grew by 57.4% and property
crime by 15.4% (Sidhu
2005
, 11). An increase
of 10.86% in the size of Malaysia’s population
between 2004 and 2010 also demonstrates that
violent crime grew in excess of the growth in
population while the rate of property crime
actually fell.

The fact that this increase in the crime rate
took place at the same time as Malaysia’s push
for industrialisation and modernisation (Jomo
and Tan
2008
, 30) does not substantiate the view
that economic development has coincided with
an increase in criminality. There is no necessary
correlation between economic development and
increases in crime, but between economic

development and reporting rates (Soares
2004
,
156). As mentioned above, of
ﬁ
cial records rou-
tinely underreport crime and reporting error is
more likely in less sophisticated institutional
structures (Soares,
ibid
). So the more economi-
cally developed Malaysia has become, the more
likely crime has been accurately recorded pro-
ducing increases in the of
ﬁ
cially recorded
ﬁ
gures.
Whether crime has actually increased would
require comparisons with victim surveys, but as
mentioned earlier, there is only very limited vic-
tim survey data available.

If there has been a net increase in actual crime,
the causes could be rooted in Malaysia’s unequal
economic development and patterns of urbanisa-
tion that, in a number of empirical studies for
other jurisdictions, have been positively corre-
lated with increases in crime (Soares, 167). Since
the establishment of the National Economic Plan
in 1971 which established af
ﬁ
rmative action
plans to enhance the social and economic status
of the Malays (Government of Malaysia
1971
, 1),
successive Malaysian Governments have suc-
cessfully eradicated the association of ethnicity
with economic function and drastically reduced
the numbers living in absolute poverty. However,
the gaps between rich and poor have increased, as
have the divides between rural and urban popula-
tions. Rates of urban poverty, in particular, have
remained persistently high and shown little
change since the Asian Currency Crisis in 1997
(New Economic Advisory Council NEAC
2010
,
57–58). The strategic shift from agriculture to
industry, rural–urban migration patterns, differ-
ential access to job opportunities, low incomes and
loosening of traditional structures of social con-
trol
15 may account for the continual increases in
violent crime. It may also explain, at least partially,
the disproportionate representation of Indians in
the overall
ﬁ
gures for violent crime, where the
problems of social marginalisation and “gangster-
ism” have been most acute (Sidhu
2005
, 17–19).


16.4

Prosecution and the Courts

Under Article 145(3) of the Federal Constitution,
the Public Prosecutor (Attorney General) has
overall responsibility of laying charges and, since
2009, the prosecution division of the Attorney
General’s Chambers has taken over the conduct
of practically all prosecutions in the subordinate
courts (referring to Magistrates and Sessions
Courts) as well as in the High Court (Attorney
General’s Chambers
2010
, 11). The reform was
intended to further professionalise and systema-
tise prosecution practices. This has increased the
workload of state prosecutors and, as can be seen
in Fig.
16.2 below, had some impact on the rates
of conviction.

In 2008, the total conviction rate in the High
Courts, Sessions Court and Magistrates Courts
was 90.6%, with 9.4% of cases resulting in an
acquittal or a discharge. In 2009, the total convic-
tion rate fell to 85.8% and the acquittal rate rose
to 14.2%. The conviction rate in relation to par-
ticular offences is not available.
16 Moreover, the

ﬁ
gures are not available for the total conviction
rates when other prosecuting agencies were han-
dling some of the prosecutions in the subordinate
courts in 2008 and the preceding years.
17 Despite
the limitations of this data, of particular interest
are the
ﬁ
gures relating to prosecutions in the
High Court which tries the most serious offences
(punishable by death), and where the conviction
rate in 2009 fell from 79.5% to 65.5%. The rea-
sons given above by the AG’s Chamber for this
fall may provide a partial explanation, as a 274%
increase in the number of cases dealt with in the
High Court alone in the space of one year inevitably

15  See further the evergreen theories of Emile Durkheim
and Robert Merton on “anomie”. For a modern review, see
Bernard et al.
(
2009
)
,
Vold’s Theoretical Criminology
,
Chaps. 6 and 8.

16  Given the outroar in the British press in 2011 on publi-
cation of statistics that seemed to indicate that the convic-
tion rate for rape offences in England and Wales was 6%
(when a more detailed analysis would have shown that the
rate was in fact 58%), the reluctance of the Malaysian
AG’s Chambers to publish more detailed data is perhaps
understandable.

17  These
ﬁ
gures are not mentioned in previous Annual
Reports of the Prosecution Division of the AG’s Chambers;
see

http://www.agc.gov.my

.


237
16 Crime and Criminal Justice in Malaysia
would have increased pressure on prosecuting
staff. Resources may have been spread too thinly
and impacted deleteriously on prosecuting
efforts.
18 The increase in the workload on state
prosecutors might also have exacerbated the
problem of delay in criminal courts. The extent of
the problem can be gleaned from the
ﬁ
gures of
the number of cases pending (see Figs.
16.3–
16.5
below).

With a total of 11,624 trial cases pending,
together with 6,324 appellate cases (as of 2009),
the courts appear jammed with case traf
ﬁ
c.
According to Malaysian judges themselves, the
delay has much to do with the habits and profes-
sional shortcomings of criminal defence lawyers,
with too many requests for adjournment adding
to delay (Makinudin
2010
, iii). However, it may
also have been down to systemic failures and the
lack of a case management system (
Ibid
, i).

16.5

Prison Population

As of mid-2010, Malaysia had a prison popula-
tion of 38,387, ranking 43rd in the world for the
total number of offenders it incarcerates
(Walmsley
2011
)
. Given a population of 27.91
million, this equates to an imprisonment rate of
138 per 100,000. As a member of the Organisation
of the Islamic Conference (OIC), Malaysia incarcer-
ates less than Iran (291), Morocco (189) and
Saudi Arabia (178), but considerably more than
Indonesia, Pakistan, Egypt (81), Sudan (45) and
the poorer sub-Saharan countries (
Ibid
). Also as a
Common Law country which, in most cases,
gives judges discretion over sentence, its incar-
ceration rates more closely mirror Australia
(133), England and Wales (155) and New Zealand
(199) than India (31), Pakistan (40) and
Bangladesh (42) (
Ibid
).

The current
ﬁ
gures for Malaysia represent a
considerable reduction in its prison population
from previous years which has had demonstrated
a seemingly inexorable climb. Between 1992 and
2007, its prison population had grown from
21,612 (112) to 50,305 (189), more than dou-
bling, and prisons were overcrowded, the of
ﬁ
cial
prison capacity being 32,000. While part of the
growth could be attributed to a rise in overall
population growth (from 18.762 m in 1992 to
27.186 m in 2007), the increase could also have
indicated a preference for incarceration as a
deterrent response to the increase in the of
ﬁ
cial
crime rates (see above), though, then as now,
there has been no empirical or qualitative study
on the speci
ﬁ
c approaches of the judges in
Malaysian courts and whether there exist any
trends.

In retrospect, one factor on the level of incar-
ceration may have been a result of lack of sen-
tencing options available to the judges. The
framework within which they have operated, until
recently (see below), had changed little since
Independence, offering options of imprisonment,

18  In August 2010, the Malaysian Bar Council reported
that there were 508 state prosecutors across the country
(see Bar Council of Malaysia
(
2010
)
. If the
ﬁ
gures were
comparable in 2009, this would have equated to an aver-
age of 27 cases per prosecutor over the year.

Criminal Justice Reforms

16.6.1
Criminal Law

Since its
ﬁ
rst introduction to the Federated
Malay States
20
by the British in 1936, the con-
tent of the general criminal law (the Penal
Code) has remained largely intact and re
ﬂ
ected
the morals of that era. In more recent times,
however, key reforms have taken place in rela-
tion to sexual offences. In line with the devel-
opments in other common law jurisdictions,
these have included increasing the punishment
for convicted rapists, introducing different
offence structures (“simple rape” and “aggra-
vated rape”) and legislating for the new offence
of “marital rape”. The latter was introduced
following persistent lobbying from NGOs and
women’s groups but was given a particular
Malaysian spin to account for local sensitivi-
ties, and the Shariah rights of a Muslim hus-
band within a valid marriage in particular.
Section 375A reads:

Any man who during the subsistence of a valid
marriage causes hurt or fear of death or hurt to his
wife or any other person in order to have sexual
intercourse with his wife shall be punished with
imprisonment for a term which may extend to
ﬁ
ve
years.
21

As noted by other commentators (Nazeri
2010
,
386), the offence does not criminalise sexual
intercourse without consent within marriage.
Rather, it punishes the assault and physical vio-
lence which precedes it. According to the Shariah
(and the particular legal school followed in
Malaysia), the husband has an unquali
ﬁ
ed right
to have sexual intercourse with his wife and she
is obliged to have intercourse with him, unless
she is physically incapable of having intercourse
because of sickness, menstruation or postpartum
bleeding. However, this right does not extend to
the in
ﬂ
iction of physical harm,
22 thereby giving
some room to legislate against some of the more
odious forms of domestic violence, if not marital
rape per se.

In addition to “marital rape”, a new section
377CA
23 expands the traditional de
ﬁ
nition of
rape (penetration of the vagina by the penis) to
include “sexual connection by object” without
consent. This was a direct response to an unsolved
case that caused public outrage when an eight-
year-old girl was found dead with an eggplant
and cucumber inserted into her genitals (Nazeri

2010
, 386).

Perhaps the biggest, and most anticipated,
change to Malaysia’s criminal law in recent years
has been the dismantling of the Internal Security
Act (ISA) 1960 and the Emergency Ordinance.
Under the ISA, a person could be arrested on reason-
able suspicion of “subversion”. This was de
ﬁ
ned
as any action or behaviour that is “in any manner
prejudicial to the security of Malaysia … or to
the maintenance of essential services … or to the
economic life therein” (section 8). This was a
catch-all provision that, in effect, gave the police
and political authorities a free discretion to arrest
and detain for longer than 24 hours, those whom
they deemed to be threatening public stability.
Once a detention order had been given by the
minister under section 8, the suspect could also
be detained inde
ﬁ
nitely without any accountability
to the courts because of ouster clauses excluding

20  Negeri Sembilan, Pahang, Perak and Selangor.

21  The Penal Code (Amendment) Act 2006, Act A1273,
which came into force on 7 September 2007.

22  In the case of the wife who is “nushuz” (disobedient, i.e.
she has not complied with her Islamic obligation), the
husband does have the right and the power to reprimand
and physically chastise her (without causing harm and not
in anger) if this is not the
ﬁ
rst time she has refused (cf Abu
Ishaq al-Shirazi
1983
, 170). The purpose of exercising
this power, however, is not so that he may have sexual
intercourse but rather as part of his individual obligation
to Allah of bidding the good and prohibiting evil and to
uphold the responsibilities imposed upon the marriage
partners under the Shariah (Abu Ishaq al-Shirazi,
ibid
,
169). Malaysian religious leaders also warned against
having a technical “marital rape” offence as it would be
contrary to Shariah; see Norbani Mohamed Nazeri, ibid.

23  See note 17, above.


242

judicial review and a non-interventionist approach
by the courts.
24 The Act had originally been
passed to deal with the Communist insurgency,
but became a useful weapon in counter-terrorism
as well as a deeply unpopular method of manag-
ing ethnic con
ﬂ
icts and political opposition in
Malaysia. In June 2012, the Internal Security Act
1960 was repealed and replaced by the Security
Offences (Special Measures) Act 2012 which
provides for judicial oversight and neither allows
inde
ﬁ
nite detention without trial nor detention
incommunicado ( see sections 4 and 5).

16.6.2
Sentencing

In 2006, following an outcry over the extent of
prison overcrowding, amendments were made to
the Criminal Procedure Code allowing offenders
to perform up to 240 hours of community service
in place of imprisonment.
25 Though it seems that
the measures took a while to be put into place, by
2010 pressures on numbers were reduced through
administrative changes allowing 17,000 offend-
ers serving existing prison sentences for minor
crimes to serve the rest of their sentence as com-
munity service.
26 In addition, since 2008,
27 a sys-
tem of parole modelled along the lines of the
Australian system has been introduced which,
though initially affecting only a very limited
range
28 and number of prisoners,
29 nevertheless
has the potential to further reduce prison num-
bers substantially in addition to serving rehabili-
tative ends.
30

16.6.3
Criminal Procedure and
Evidence Law

The Criminal Procedure (Amendment) Act 2006
was the government’s response to mounting
internal and external political pressures for the
introduction of new mechanisms of police gover-
nance and legal accountability. This legislation
represented the most radical reform of Malaysian
criminal justice and procedure for more than 30
years (Farrar
2009
)
. In respect of pre-trial proce-
dure, it included reform of the law of body
searches, con
ﬁ
rmed speci
ﬁ
c rights of suspects
upon arrest (in particular the right to a lawyer and
to be so informed), abolished the infamous “cau-
tion statement” under section 113 of the Criminal
Procedure Code, further regulated the discretion
of magistrates to detain suspects following an
arrest, amended rules on pre-trial disclosure and
enhanced prosecutorial oversight of police
investigations.
31

In June 2010, the Government also passed leg-
islation allowing state prosecutors to offer plea
bargains, offering accused persons up to a
ﬁ
fty
per cent discount on the maximum sentence
available for that offence in exchange for a guilty

26  See
The Star
, “Foreign Prisoners to Join Parole
Programme”, 28 April 2010.

27  See The Prison (Amendment) Act 2008, Act A1332,
Part 1Va.

28  Parole is not available for a number of sex offences,
housebreaking causing death or grievous hurt, as well as
those who plant or cultivate dangerous drugs; see Prison
(Amendment) Act 2008, Fourth Schedule.

29  In 2011, there were only 310 parolees; see Gunaratnam
and Palansamy (2011).

30  The system has strict vetting procedures overseen by a
Parole Board and requires all potentially eligible appli-
cants to have successfully completed an “in-house” reha-
bilitation programme; see Prison (Amendment) Act,
2008s 46E.

31
The Public Prosecutor can now demand police reports at
any stage of an investigation (s 120 of the CPC). See also
sections 107 and 107A that oblige police of
ﬁ
cer to submit
reports to the Public Prosecutor within speci
ﬁ
ed time peri-
ods following requests by the person who
ﬁ
rst lodged the
police report. This is following reforms from other juris-
dictions. In England and Wales, for example, since the
publication of the Glidewell Report in 1998 and then the
Auld Report in 2001, the Crown Prosecution Service has
been cooperating more closely with the Police, especially
in the charging process; see Jehle and Wade
2006
, 177.

plea.
32 Given the current workload of deputy pub-
lic prosecutors and the number of cases pending
before the courts, this amendment was an essen-
tial move in order to avoid further adding to delay
in the court system.
33 Early in 2011, the Attorney
General issued guidelines and conducted road
shows throughout the country on how the system
should operate. It is still in early days, however,
and much will depend on the extent to which the
rights of accused persons to a lawyer during
investigation are implemented in practice and
how closely judges are involved in and regulate
the “negotiation”.
34 Malaysian lawyers and police
will need to draw from experiences overseas to
ensure that due process requirements are observed
and that suspects are not coerced into pleading
guilty to offences they never in fact committed.
35

In relation to trial procedure, video testimony
and live television links are now permitted where
“in the interests of
justice”.
36 This measure was
introduced to protect vulnerable witnesses (again
following trends in common law countries, but
especially earlier reforms in England and Wales)
and to encourage children and victims of sex
offences to give testimony in an adversarial trial
setting. In the case of children, these measures
have been enhanced by the Evidence of Child
Witness Act 2007. This confers a discretion on
the court to allow a child to give testimony out-
side the court in a special room,
37 to set up a
screen inside the court shielding him or her from
the accused,
38 to give pre-recorded video testi-
mony
39 and to testify via a live TV-link
40 and for
questions to be put to a child through a court-
appointed intermediary.
41 It also mandates restric-
tions on publication of the child witness personal
details to the press and other media
42 and permits
the court to minimise formality of proceedings
by ordering court of
ﬁ
cers to “de-robe”.
43

The Witness Protection Act 2009
44 further
facilitates giving testimony by introducing for the

ﬁ
rst time a witness protection programme in
Malaysia.
45 This legislation was passed because
of the perceived problem of prosecutions collaps-
ing due to extra-curial intimidation of prosecu-
tion witness in gang crime and related offences.
Subject to the discretion of the Director General,
the Act allows for change of identity and reloca-
tion of witnesses and their families. The Director
General may recommend particular witnesses for
the programme and consider applications from
witnesses based on the seriousness of the offence,
importance of their evidence, availability of alternative
methods for securing the witness testimony and
any other factors the Director General thinks
relevant.

The Malaysian courts have now overturned previous
case authority that prohibited a judge from indicating in a
pre-trial conference the sentence he or she would be
minded to give in relation to this particular accused and on
the facts of the case. However, the court retains a discre-
tion to refuse any potential “deal” forged between prose-
cution and defence counsel;

16.6.4
Criminal Justice Administration

Potentially, the most important reform in the
administration of criminal justice has been the
establishment of a new body, the Enforcement
Agency Integrity Commission,
47 to oversee the
activities of the PDRM, along with twenty-one
other federal enforcement agencies. Since the
release of former Deputy Prime Minister Anwar
Ibrahim in 2005 and the concerns of a “culture of
impunity” and police “untouchability” expressed
by the Royal Commission in its 2005 Report, try-
ing to
ﬁ
nd appropriate and acceptable legal
mechanisms for police accountability has been a
key political priority. The Royal Commission
recommended setting up an Independent Police
Complaints and Misconduct Commission that
would focus solely on overseeing the activities of
the PDRM. The original idea was to establish a
completely independent commission that would
investigate, prosecute and punish police of
ﬁ
cers
for “misconduct”. However, after successful
political lobbying by the PDRM, which com-
plained of unfair victimisation, the recommenda-
tions were watered down and replaced with an
inter-agency “Ombudsman” (the EAIC), respon-
sible for 21 enforcement agencies. This body
receives complaints, conducts investigations,
makes referrals and has the power to “go public”
if its recommendations are ignored by the rele-
vant disciplinary body. It does not have any pow-
ers to prosecute or impose punishments.

While such a commission can play a useful
function in using public opinion to effect agency
compliance, one wonders whether it will be per-
ceived as legitimate in ordinary Malaysian eyes
when the EAIC still comes under the purview of
the Attorney General, a government minister. It is
also doubtful whether the indirect sanctions will
be strong enough to deter police or other enforce-
ment agency misconduct when the EAIC relies
on the disciplinary authorities of the enforcement
agency itself and the determination of its of
ﬁ
cers
to take appropriate action. The effectiveness of
the EAIC will further depend on how well it is
funded. The recent controversial policing of the
demonstrations surrounding the campaign for
clean and fair elections (“Bersih 2.0”) might be
just the
ﬁ
llip the EAIC needed to push its funding
needs higher up the political agenda. However,
resourcing a “mega commission” cutting across
21 different agencies is a huge undertaking, espe-
cially in the contexts of the already considerable
spending commitments in the 10th Malaysia Plan
and the uncertain state of the global economy.

Supplementing and complementing the work
of the EAIC is the re-vamped Malaysian Anti-
Corruption Commission (the MACC) which, as
the name suggests, focuses on investigating and
policing “corruption” rather than “misconduct”.
The new Act was also passed in 2009 and, in con-
trast with the EAIC, cannot be accused of having
established a toothless tiger, though concerns
were initially expressed over its lack of indepen-
dence. Rather, the concern with the MACC is that
it has too much power and that its investigations
have insuf
ﬁ
cient due process protections, espe-
cially when examined in the light of the death of
Teoh Beng Hock (who died while in MACC cus-
tody in 2010.) “Witnesses”, that is persons who
are questioned by MACC of
ﬁ
cers but not placed
under formal arrest (though who may be in “cus-
tody”), have no rights to a lawyer (the CPC does
not apply) and, as a result of a ruling of the
Federal Court in 2010, can be questioned out of
“of
ﬁ
ce hours” in order to facilitate and expedite
the obtaining of relevant evidence.
48 Further, the
right of silence will not apply and all statements
made to MACC of
ﬁ
cers will be admissible unless
obtained by duress (section 53, MACC Act
2009).
Given that there is no right to a lawyer, the lack of
oversight and the opportunity to interrogate well
past the twilight hours, one would be forgiven for

47  Enforcement Agency Integrity Commission Act 2009.
The Act came into force in April 2011.

Conclusion

Crime and criminal justice in Malaysia, like
Malaysia itself, have been transformed by the pro-
cesses of industrialisation and modernisation. In
common with other countries that have undergone
relatively rapid economic development and social
restructuring, crime rates have increased (espe-
cially violent crime) and criminal justice agencies,
the PDRM in particular, have found it dif
ﬁ
cult to
cope with the changing expectations and demands
placed on them in the new social and political
environment. Inter-ethnic politics, rise of popu-
lism, Internet social networking, uneven economic
development, migration patterns, political events,
political personalities, corruption, scandals and
foreign in
ﬂ
uences have all shaped developments
in crime and criminal justice as they have other
areas of government responsibility.

As a result, Malaysia has reformed and is
reforming its system of criminal justice, from an
antiquated and inadequate post-colonial model to
a more modern, responsive and eclectic form
re
ﬂ
ecting its particular ethnic make-up and local
concerns. But this process is not complete and
more needs to be done to address systematically
problems encountered on the ground. In the
author’s opinion, this demands accurate and inde-
pendent data collection so that decisions to reform
are informed more by empiricism than vested
interests. Reforms are more likely to work and
have legitimacy where they are de-politicised and
based on multiple independent sources rather than
the enforcement agencies themselves. To this end,
academic institutions and independent institutes
across Malaysia need funding to support and
properly establish Criminology and Criminal
Justice as a research discipline, and for new
partnerships to be forged between enforcement
agencies and academics. The new Centre for Law
and International Legal Studies with a criminal
justice focus is a start, but Malaysia needs its
existing universities to play a greater role. It may
be that a Malaysian Crime Survey would be just
the right project to kick-start such a development
(as it was in the UK), but the universities also
require more staff with the expertise and resources
to make the necessary contribution.

Introduction

Criminology as an academic discipline and as a
profession doesn’t enjoy its deserved status in
Pakistan. Amongst 133 universities in Pakistan,
only three universities are offering a post
graduate
degree in the subject of criminology. On the other
hand, the crime rate in Pakistan is on the rise despite
the new police reforms in 2002. The crime rate rep-
resented by the of
ﬁ
cial statistics of police is rarely
reliable, as the data on crimes for drugs pushing,
narcotics smuggling, cyber crimes and traf
ﬁ
cking
in person are a few categories for which police do
not collect speci
ﬁ
c data. The Anti-Narcotics Force
(ANF) and Federal Investigation Agency (FIA) are
responsible for other serious and organized crimes
which are discussed subsequently.

In the wake of terrorism, the usual street and
organized crimes took a serious turn and presented
an unimaginable pattern of crime-terror-contin-
uum. Despite this grave situation and increasing
crime rate, the scienti
ﬁ
c and academic approach
towards research-based policies are yet to be seen
and implemented. The components of the criminal
justice system in Pakistan are still using the old
traditional methods of prevention, interrogation,
investigations, prosecution and imprisonment. The
academic and training institutes of the criminal
justice system are reluctant to accept the scienti
ﬁ
c
knowledge of criminology in their respective cur-
riculum. This paper consists of two parts. In part I,
the situation of criminology in Pakistan, its devel-
opment and current status and in part II the struc-
ture and functions of the major components of the
criminal justice
system in Pakistan—police, pro-
bation, prosecution, courts, and corrections are
discussed. The paper further discusses the need for
inclusion of criminological literature and the
police studies in the curriculum and educational
and training institutes of law-enforcement agen-
cies. The paper emphasises the importance of
bridging the gap between academics and practitio-
ners of the criminal
justice system in Pakistan.

Socio-economic Indicators
of Pakistan

Pakistan is a developing country, situated in South
Asia and her border touches with India,
Afghanistan, Iran, China and the Arabian Sea.
Pakistan came into being on August 14, 1947. It
has
four
provinces;
Balochistan,
Khyber
Pakhtunkhwa, the Punjab and Sindh, and seven
agencies of the Federally Administered Tribal
Area (FATA) which is a buffer zone between

Criminology and Criminal Justice
System in Pakistan

Fasihuddin

The author is highly grateful and indebted to the Assistant
Editor of Pakistan Journal of Criminology, Mr. Imran
Ahmad Sajid, a Ph.D. Research Scholar for collecting
data from of
ﬁ
ces of the criminal justice units and locating
some valuable references of criminology in Pakistan.

Pakistan and Afghanistan. With a population of
177.1 million and a growth rate of 2.05% Pakistan
has the 6th largest population in the world
(Population Reference Bureau 2010) and is the
home of one of the twenty (20) most populous cit-
ies in the world—Karachi. Though the majority of
the population still lives in rural areas, urbaniza-
tion is increasing at a constant pace. The urban
population reached 36.8% by July 1st 2011 (Ibid).
With one of the highest fertility rates (3.5) in the
region and increasing urbanization, Pakistan is
facing an increasing unemployed population. The
current unemployment rate is 5.6% (Economic
Survey of Pakistan
2010–2011
)
. Pakistan has the
Human Development Index (HDI) as 0.490 and
was ranked 128th by the UNDP
2010 HDI rank-
ing in
2010
. The population below poverty line
was 36.10% in 2008 (Economic Survey of Pakistan

2010–2011
). However, the Ministry of Finance
estimates that 75% of the population lives near
both sides of the poverty line (Economic Survey
of Pakistan
2010–2011
). Pakistan was placed at
number 143/178 in the 2010 Corruption Percep-
tion Index Ranking by Transparency Inter
national

2011
. The US Department of State 2010 report,
Traf
ﬁ
cking in Persons
2011
, has also placed
Pakistan in Tier 2 category, a slight improvement
since 2009 when it was in Tier 2 Watch List.

These socio-economic indicators present a
dismal picture of a typical 3rd world country.
Pakistan is a source, transit and destination of
many organized crimes like terrorism, human-
traf
ﬁ
cking, drugs, etc and has higher population
growth rate, and ill-conceived urbanization, ris-
ing unemployment, low expenditure on education
and health with a large portion of population
extremely vulnerable to poverty, and high rate of
corruption and crime.

17.2.2
Situation of Crimes in Pakistan

Figure
17.2 (Appendix
1
) explains that the crime
record is collected at the police station level from
which it goes to the of
ﬁ
ce of the District Police
Of
ﬁ
cer (DPO). The Central Police Of
ﬁ
ce (CPO)
at each provincial headquarters collects crime
statistics from all the DPO of
ﬁ
ces in the prov-
ince. The national crime recording institution is
the National Police Bureau (NPB). The NPB col-
lects crime data from the respective Central
Police Of
ﬁ
ces of each province. Though it col-
lects crime data at national level, the NPB rarely
publishes it. The crime rate in Pakistan is increas-
ing steadily. In this paper, crime rates were calcu-
lated from the of
ﬁ
cial crime
ﬁ
gures provided by
the National Police Bureau and the population

ﬁ
gures as published in the Economic Survey of
Pakistan
2008–2009
.

Pakistan’s crime situation has never been a
pleasant one. Not only the ordinary crimes are
very high but extra-ordinary situations are numer-
ous and varied. Agitations and riots similar to
those of 1958 and 1968, the in
ﬂ
ux of three mil-
lion Afghan refugees in 1980s, the recent effects
of the war on terror in terms of serious security
threats, and another three millions of Internally
Displaced Persons (IDPs) from tribal areas and
Malakand Division down to the cities further
aggravated the crime situation. However, proper
research and analyses are rarely conducted to
evaluate the impact and implications of such
social dislocations. Crime
ﬁ
gures were published
with comments from 1947 to 1981, but no such
efforts were made after 1981 by the NPB or any
other agency. The total recorded crimes in 1947,
the year of Pakistan’s independence, were 74,104
and 152,782 in 1981 with a crime rate of 247 per
100,000 population in 1947 and 182.2 in 1981
(Ministry of Interior
2009
). The higher crime rate
in 1947 can be attributed to the volatile situation
in the post-independence riots, violence, and
internal and external migration across the borders
of India and Pakistan in 1947.

If we analyze the recorded crime from 1991
onwards, it seems that the crime tide has followed
an upward trend. During the last 18 years, the
crime rate rose from 255.52 per 100,000 in 1991 to
354.8 in 2008. Police reforms were initiated in a
time (2001) when the of
ﬁ
cial crime
ﬁ
gures were
declining (1998–2001) but which steadily went up
after the promulgation of the new police law in
2002 (Fasihuddin
2010
)
. However, this is the situ-
ation of the of
ﬁ
cially recorded crime rate, which
does not, in any way, represent the true picture of

17 Criminology and Criminal Justice System in Pakistan
crimes in Pakistan. The real crime rate is yet to be
estimated. Basically, the police reforms initiated
by Gen. Musharraf in 2001–2002 were put to seri-
ous fundamental amendments by the successive
political governments, which rendered the reforms
redundant, ineffective, dysfunctional and poorly
implemented. In addition to this lack of political
will, never enough resources were provided for
police new units and specialized skills and train-
ing. Recently, in Baluchistan and Sindh provinces
the reforms are almost reverted.

It is still on the rise. This table is calculated
only for this paper and is not available in any
published documents of the NPB or any other
government or non-government paper or their
web sites. Such academic work is rarely seen in
any government department in Pakistan, Fig.
17.1
.
(For details, see Table
17.8 in Appendix
2
).

Usually, crime in Pakistan is classi
ﬁ
ed under
two main heads: (1) crimes against persons and, (2)
crimes against property.
Crimes against Persons
include physical harm or force being applied to
another person. Murder, assault, rape, kidnapping,
child abuse and violence against women are a few
categories of crimes against person for which data
is collected by the police. The highest incidence of
crime against persons are hurt and injury (36%),
kidnapping/abduction (16%) and attempt to mur-
der (16%) against the total of 86,101 crimes against
person in Pakistan in 2008 (Percentages calculated
from Tables
17.8 and
17.9
, Appendix
3
). The same
categories of crimes against person dominate in all
the provinces as well. The crimes of rape and kid-
napping are more dominant in the provinces of
Punjab and Sindh than in Balochistan and Khyber
Pakhtunkhwa (KPK).

Among the
Crimes against Property for which
the statistics are collected include dacoity,
2 rob-
bery, burglary, vehicle theft and cattle theft. The
dominant crimes in this category in Pakistan are
theft (31%), motor vehicle theft (25%), and rob-
bery (17%). There seems no signi
ﬁ
cant differ-
ence in provinces in this respect.

Overall, crime against person makes up only
15% of the total recorded crime while the crime
against property makes up only 19%. The very
low crime rates are of course not re
ﬂ
ecting the
real situation of crime, but an ineffective crime
recording system and an ineffective justice and
policing system (like in India and China).

Further, it is to be noted that in the provinces of
Punjab and Balochistan, “Crimes against the per-
son” is very large as compared to “crimes against
property”. In KPK even
ﬁ
ve times higher. Of
course this is not re
ﬂ
ecting real existing crime,
but simply shows that crimes against property are
not recorded. Nearly all over the world, “crimes
against property” makes up 80% of all crime.
Actually, in the Pakistan’s traditional and semi-
democratic society, people try to avoid reporting
to the police for theft and burglary as it is an hon-
our and prestige problem for many unless serious
and sensational. Moreover, police leadership takes
such crimes as serious inef
ﬁ
ciency on part of the
police station staff in the locality. So the lower/
ﬁ
eld
staffs try to avoid such registration of cases and
mitigate the seriousness by applying less serious
sections of the law and also by
persuading the
aggrieved party to seek some informal justice
practices for solving property matters.

Besides these crimes, the data on crimes for
drugs pushing, narcotics smuggling, cyber crimes
and traf
ﬁ
cking in person are a few categories for
which police do not collect speci
ﬁ
c data. The
Anti-Narcotics Force (ANF) is responsible for
data on drugs and the Federal Investigation
Agency (FIA) for some major organized crimes
like human traf
ﬁ
cking and smuggling, cyber
crimes, money laundering and corruption in gov-
ernment of
ﬁ
ces. These two agencies publish their
annual reports and digests until recently, but have
since discontinued documentation and analysis.
The of
ﬁ
cial crime rate, presented in this paper,
does not include data from these other agencies
as shown in Fig.
17.2
. Therefore, the crime rate is
only calculated from the police of
ﬁ
cial statistics.

To preserve the history of crime in Pakistan,
the writer collected and obtained certain crime
data for his Country Report for the 129th
International Senior Seminar at the UNFEI,

2
Under Pakistan Penal Code 1898, Section 391, Dacoity is
de
ﬁ
ned as “When
ﬁ
ve or more persons conjointly commit
or attempt to commit a robbery, or where the whole number
of persons conjointly committing or attempting to commit
a robbery and persons present and aiding such commission
or attempt, amount to
ﬁ
ve or more, every person so com-
mitting, attempting or aiding is said to commit “dacoity”.

17.2.3
Status of Criminology
in Pakistan

17.2.3.1
Academic Status

Unfortunately, criminology as an academic disci-
pline and as a profession doesn’t enjoy its
deserved status in Pakistan. Despite the serious
law and order situation and low socio-economic
indicators, there is a general apathy on part of the
academics and practitioners to promote the
scienti
ﬁ
c study of criminology and policing sci-
ences (Fasihuddin
2008
)
.

There are a total of 133 universities and
degree awarding institutions in Pakistan, 74
public and 59 private. Criminology is offered as
a separate subject in only three: Karachi
University (KU), Sindh University, and Punjab
University. The KU started a degree programme
in criminology in 1995–1996 under the
Psychology Department but it was abandoned
after 1 year. It was again started in 2000.
However, the criminology department at Karachi
University is still controversial and some news-
papers (
Daily Dawn
) alleged the KU of running
a fake department (Faiza Ilyas, January 18,
2010). According to a faculty member, Prof
Dr Burfat of KU, there is no criminology depart-
ment at the campus (Ibid). The of
ﬁ
cial web site
of KU does not mention the existence of any
department of criminology under its faculties
head.
3 Punjab University started the degree pro-
gramme in 2009. The Sindh University at
Jamshoro started the Master of Criminology
programme in 1998 and it continues success-
fully. The faculties hired to teach the courses of
criminology at these universities have very little
competence in the
ﬁ
eld.

Four other universities have included crimi-
nology as an optional subject in their various
social sciences programmes; University of
Peshawar offers as an optional subject in the
Department of Social work, Department of
Sociology and Department of Anthropology;
University of Sargodha offers as an optional sub-
ject in the Department of Social Work; Islamia
University, Bahawalpur offers in the Department
of Social Work; and Kohat University of Science
and Technology (KUST) offers criminology as
an optional subject in the Department of Social
Work and Sociology. Unfortunately, this is mostly
under the sociology or social work departments,
and criminology is not offered as an independent
discipline.

17.2.3.2
Curriculum of Criminology

The HEC proposed a 2 year curriculum of
M.Sc. Criminology to be implemented in all uni-
versities throughout the country but, it was never
appreciated by any of the academic institution

17 Criminology and Criminal Justice System in Pakistan
due to resources and capacity
constraints (See
Box 1 for HEC proposed curriculum for MSc
Criminology in Appendix
1
). The universities
which offer a criminology degree have devised
their self-styled curriculum which are not mod-
ern, scienti
ﬁ
c and comprehensive. The proposed
curriculum focuses on the very basics of crimi-
nology with no specialized subjects (See Boxes 2
and 3 for Criminology curricula of various uni-
versities in Pakistan in Appendix
4
). Further, the
books proposed for the study are often not avail-
able in the market. Furthermore, the local litera-
ture on the subject of criminology is very scarce,
even there was no journal of criminology before
April 2009 when the 1st issue of the
Pakistan
Journal
of Criminology was launched (to be dis-
cussed later).

The author wrote a book on criminology titled

Expanding Criminology to Pakistan
in which the
author proposed a curriculum for Master degree at
university (See Box 5). The Governor of the
Khyber Pakhtunkhwa (KPK, previously known as
North West Frontier Province, NWFP) circulated
the book to all the Vice-Chancellors of the univer-
sities of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa to assess the feasi-
bility of introducing the subject of criminology in
their respective universities (Letter No.PSG-
1(2)/2009/43). Unfortunately, no university was
able to implement the proposed curriculum
because of limited resources. However, the young
scholars in M.Phil., Ph.D., and Masters pro-
grammes in sociology, social work, psychology
and most of the young police of
ﬁ
cers who get a
chance on some scholarships to the western world,
have shown tremendous interest in the study of
criminology and criminological research. Most of
them wish to initiate similar programmes but have
yet to do so. The curriculum devised by the author
is basically on the pattern of the usual 2 years
course in any social science subject, mostly with
one hundred score/points in each paper. The author
not only has included modern topics and concepts
in it but also has given the further sub-topics
under each major subject (as shown in Box 5 in
Appendix
4
). The author, moreover, described and
suggested the latest books, journals and web sites
for the proposed curriculum which was unprece-
dented in the history of developmental
criminology
in Pakistan. At the moment, Pakistan has no
national institute of criminology, research and
policing and security studies. Even in the private
sector no one has come forward to invest in such
academic endeavours.

One of the recent achievements of criminology
is to get a place in the optional subjects in the
Central Superior Service (CSS) examination which
is the most prestigious and the highest test for
selection of the elite national bureaucracy in
Pakistan, conducted by the Federal Public Service
Commission (FPSC) of Pakistan every year. The
FPSC has asked the Pakistan Society of
Criminology to design a curriculum for this
optional subject vide letter no.F.3-1/2012/
CR-11(Criminology) dated April 16, 2012 to be
implemented from 2013. It is hoped that this one
move will revolutionize the promotion of crimi-
nology in academic institutions as about a ten
thousand candidates apply for CSS every year and
criminology will be likely one of their choice.


17.2.3.3
Criminology in the Trainings

Besides universities and degree awarding institu-
tions, criminology has also been lacking in the
curricula of the training schools and colleges of
the criminal justice system, particularly the police.
Criminology was long taught in the training of the
Assistant Superintendent of Police (ASP) at the
National Police Academy (NPA), Islamabad.
The course was primarily taught by visiting police
scholars who would have done some courses in
criminology from local or foreign institutions.
After the reforms in the ASP course in 1999,

criminology was excluded from the curriculum for
unknown reasons. Today, police of
ﬁ
cers in
Pakistan complete basic police training with no
criminological knowledge. The status of criminol-
ogy in the training academies of other components
of criminal justice system is unknown.


17.2.4
Criminological Literature
in Pakistan

There is a severe scarcity of criminological litera-
ture in Pakistan. Some of the police of
ﬁ
cers and a
few academics wrote books on
criminology and

17.2.5
Contribution of Pakistan Society
of Criminology

The establishment of Pakistan Society of
Criminology (PSC) in September 2008 and the
inauguration of Pakistan Journal of Criminology
(PJC) in April 2009 was a major step in the devel-
opment of criminology in Pakistan. By 2012,
PSC published twelve (12) issues including gen-
eral and special issues covering a wide range of
criminological subjects in Pakistan and the world.
The special issues of PJC addressed the juvenile
justice system in Pakistan (Vol. 1. No. 3. Oct
2009), terrorism, organized crime and law-
enforcement (Vol. 2. No. 1. Jan 2010), violence
against women (Vol. 2. No. 2. April 2010), crimi-
nal justice system in Pakistan (Vol. 2. No. 3. July
2010), and policing and transnational crime
(Vol. 2. No. 4. Oct 2010) and terrorism and

radicalism (Vol. 3. No. 3. Jan 2012). The journal
is freely available at the PSC of
ﬁ
cial web site.
6
Contributions to the PJC come from all over the
world, including USA, China, Australia, South
Africa, UK, Iran, Canada, Turkey, India,
Bangladesh, Japan, and others. A wide range of
research papers has been published in PJC cover-
ing the areas of drugs, human traf
ﬁ
cking, the
criminal justice system, police, prosecution,
prison, courts, child abuse, street crimes, kidnap-
ping, cattle theft, violence against woman, cor-
ruption, cyber crimes, suicide bombing, police
education and training, juvenile justice, problems
and constraints in criminological research, and
the limitations of criminological research in
Pakistan. More than 75% of all the published
research papers are produced by local scholars. It
is an indicator of the improving situation of local
literature on criminology in Pakistan. The remark-
able achievement of PJC came on 29th March,
2012 when the Higher Education Commission of
Pakistan formally recognized the PJC as an
authentic research journal in “Y” category vide
letter no.DD/JOUR/SS&H/2012/2/6.

Besides PJC, the Pakistan Society of
Criminology also published a book titled
“
Expanding Criminology to Pakistan
” which dis-
cusses practical issues in criminology in Pakistan
along with an emphasis on the future prospects of
criminology and with a proposed curriculum for
the masters level programmes at universities in
Pakistan as mentioned earlier. The book provides
a wide range of links to the journals, web sites,
archives, libraries and books on criminology
around the world. It further discusses the issue of
the practice and
ﬁ
eld application of criminology
in Pakistan. Besides this, PSC also published a
small booklet “
Child Rights, National and
International Laws and the Role of the Police
”
(2008) which is in Urdu. This small booklet is
very useful for the policeman in Pakistan. The
then Inspector General of Police, KPK sent the
booklet to all the police stations of the province

through an of
ﬁ
cial order. The same booklet has
been used in numerous trainings on juvenile jus-
tice and the police in Pakistan. The PSC designed
a new data-collection system for the local police
in KPK, on Juvenile Justice Indicators, as required
by the UNODC and UNICEF. For the
ﬁ
rst time
since 1934, a new criminal record system was
introduced. This practice was replicated in
another province, Balochistan, by the National
Police Bureau. Its report is now published and
available online. Moreover, two training manuals
on juvenile justice in Urdu language for police
were published in 2011 and have been highly
praised by local police chiefs.

One of the other contributions of PSC to the
criminological literature is the translation of the
book of Prof. Kam C. Wong,
Chinese Policing:
History and Reform, into Urdu. Wong’s book pro-
vides a model analytical framework for those who
are currently analyzing a democratic, professional
and responsible policing (Fasihuddin
2011
)
.

A future project of PSC is to launch a National
Institute of Criminology (NIC). PSC has been
working on NIC for the past few years. However,

ﬁ
nding
ﬁ
nancial support for the project is the key
constraint in the establishment of such an Institute.

17.2.6
Professional Organizations of
Criminology in Pakistan

There have been a few professional organizations
of criminological interest in Pakistan including
Association of the Police Service of Pakistan
(APSP), and National Council of Criminology
Pakistan (NCCPAK)
7 and the Pakistani chapter
of the International Police Association (IPA).
8
Unfortunately most of these organizations are
defunct and have made no contribution to crimi-
nology. Only the Pakistan Society of Criminology
has made signi
ﬁ
cant contribution to the
ﬁ
eld. A
few like-minded academics and police of
ﬁ
cers
established the Pakistan Society of Criminology
(PSC) in Sept 2008 and got it registered with the
provincial government of Khyber Pakhunkhwa
(Registration No. DSW/NWFP/2988). The aims
and objectives of the Society are to create a multi-
disciplinary forum to serve the nation through
earnest efforts of dissemination of criminological
knowledge and
ﬁ
eld experiences, both from inter-
national scholarship and local best practices.

The PSC soon afterwards launched its web
site, and ensured the publication of the Pakistan
Journal of Criminology on quarterly basis. The
Pakistani media is also giving a considerable rec-
ognition to the efforts of Pakistan Society of
Criminology.
9 Gradually it is drawing a signi
ﬁ
cant
attention of the researchers and readers from all
over the world especially towards its indigenous
criminological literature.

17.3.1
Criminal Justice System
in Pakistan

Criminal justice system as a system generated
very little attention in Pakistan. The interest in
criminal justice system has been largely sporadic,
and in the words of Dr. Paul Petzschmann
(
2010
)
,
limited to a few aspects deemed suf
ﬁ
ciently “pol-
icy-relevant” to merit international interest.
Criminal justice system in Pakistan is largely an
implanted institution, and amalgamation of

For example, in the most popular daily

many veteran coloumnists have written speci
ﬁ
c and spe-
cial coloumns on criminology and the role of Pakistan
Society of Criminology and its President (Dr. Zahoor

coverage by most of the national dailies. The Radio
Pakistan FM. 101 channel from Peshawar and Khyber
News TV Channel had special interviews with Fasihuddin,
Editor-in-Chief of Pakistan Journal of Criminology on
June 16, 2011 and on September 20, 2011, respectively

precolonial and colonial elements, combined
with variety of Islamic legal interpretations
(Petzschmann
2010
)
.

As in most former British colonies, Pakistan’s
criminal justice system is rooted in British politi-
cal traditions (Calafato and Knepper
2009
)
. The
procedure of criminal justice system in Pakistan,
inherited from 90 years of British rule, is given in
the Criminal Procedure Code (CrPC), 1898 which
provides for case registration and investigation by
the police and the trial in a criminal court. In a
typical criminal case in the criminal justice sys-
tem of Pakistan,
ﬁ
rst of all, a First Information
Report (FIR) as per Section 154 of the CrPC is
recorded. The FIR is known as the Register No. I
in a police-station criminal record, which con-
tains a total of 25 registers for various records in
a locality (see Box 6 in Appendix
5
). The police
of
ﬁ
cer proceeds to the scene of the crime, where
required, and investigates the facts of the case.
After the completion of an investigation, the
Station House Of
ﬁ
cer (also known as the Of
ﬁ
cer
in Charge) of the police station sends a report to
the concerned Magistrate or Session Judge, as the
case may require. This is called Final Report
(
Chalan
). On receiving the police report, the
Magistrate or District and Session Judge takes
cognizance and initiates the trial of the case. Once
the charges are framed, the procedure requires the

prosecution
(emphasize added) to prove the
charges against the accused beyond a reasonable
doubt. The accused is to be given a full opportu-
nity to defend himself/herself. If the trial ends in
conviction of the accused, which is very low in
Pakistan (15%), the court may award any of the
punishments as prescribed in the Pakistan Penal
Code, 1860 (or any other applicable special law).

In this section, we will describe the components
of the criminal justice system in Pakistan; police,
prosecution, courts, prisons and probation.


17.3.2
Police

Police are the
ﬁ
rst responders to any breach of law
in all civil societies. The Constitution of Pakistan
1973 stipulates that in the provinces the responsi-
bility for crime prevention and control and the
administration of justice primarily rests with the
respective provincial governments. That is why
police are under the control of the provincial gov-
ernment for all practical purposes. The federal
government, however, has jurisdiction over mat-
ters such as the enactment of criminal laws, the
training of certain categories of criminal justice
personnel, and research, apart from the direct
law and order responsibility it has for the feder-
ally controlled territories (Shoaib Suddle
1995
)
.
Though in all federation systems such arrange-
ments are inevitable, yet at times, it gives rise to
con
ﬂ
ict between jurisdictions. Pakistani police
have suffered a lot in this respect, especially after
the new Police Order 2002, promulgated by the
military ruler Gen. Pervez Musharraf and after
Pakistan joined the war on terror in the wake of
9/11 attacks. As we will see, both decisions have
far reaching effects for the police.
10


17.3.2.1
Police Structure, Organization
and Functions

Pakistan inherited the colonial criminal justice
system from the British in India. Since the parti-
tion of India in 1947, Pakistan has had a rigid
police structure, mostly hierarchical and vertical
in nature and based on the command and control
system. As Pakistan is a federation of four prov-
inces, law enforcement powers have been divided
between the federal government and provinces.
11

Provincial police agencies are led by an
Inspector General of Police, supported by a
Deputy Inspector General of Police in a region or
range, who is assisted by a Superintendent of
Police (SP) in a district. Below him is the Deputy
or Assistant Superintendent of Police who com-
mands the subdivision or
tehsil (sub district
level), and below him is the Station House Of
ﬁ
cer
(SHO) who is in charge of a police station, mostly
in the rank of Inspector or sub-inspector. After
the Police Order 2002, most of this nomenclature

17 Criminology and Criminal Justice System in Pakistan
was changed. The IGP is now called the Provincial
Police Of
ﬁ
cer (PPO), the SP is renamed as
District Police Of
ﬁ
cer (DPO) and the DIG in the
big cities is given a new role and authority under
the new title of Capital City Police Of
ﬁ
cer
(CCPO). The Investigation (or detection) is being
separated from the prevention (or watch and
ward) and has its own chain of command right
from a police station level to the SP (Investigation)
and Additional Inspector General of Police
(Investigation) at the top, however, subject to the
general command and control of the SHO in a
police station, of a DPO in a district, of a DIG in
a region and of the PPO in a province. Prosecution
is altogether cut off from the police and is now
established as an independent department under
the new law, the Prosecution Ordinance 2005
(See Appendix
6 for the various levels of entries
to the police and the organizational structure).

The police normally are not happy with the
available strength and budget and a demand for
more recruitment and funds is always on the top
of the police agenda. In the wake of serious terror-
ist attacks, more resources were provided by the
government. For example, only in the province of
KPK the police strength increased from 48,655
(2008) to 74,000 (2011). The major portion of the
total police budget goes to establishment and
management cost (80%), i.e. salaries and allow-
ances of the force and only a little (20%) is left for
the qualitative improvement, capacity building
and professional competence (See Appendix
7
).


17.3.2.2
Functions of the Police
in Pakistan

The universal function of the police is the preven-
tion of crime, investigation of crime and main-
taining peace and order in a society. The same
applies in Pakistan. To achieve this goal the
Police Order 2002, Chapter II, Clauses 3 and 4,
provide a detailed list of activities for the police
to carry out. The major functions of the police are
to protect life, property and liberty of citizens,
preserve and promote public peace, keep order,
etc. (See Appendix
8 for a detail list of functions
of the police).

However, the effectiveness of the police to
perform their duties is questioned by all sections
of the society, media, public, and civil society.
Police are often labeled as “too late to arrive at
the crime scene”, “they are never there when you
need them”, “too violent or passive” etc. The
deviation of the police from their duties is com-
mon in Pakistan (Fasihuddin
2009
)
. Their func-
tions have been reduced to the same old traditional
duties than the new role envisioned for them in
the new police order. The image of the police as
providing security to the public and winning pub-
lic con
ﬁ
dence is often very tarnished.

17.3.2.3
Police Recruitment, Training
and Education

A detailed description of the police recruitment,
training and education has been given by
Fasihuddin
(
2009
) in his article,
Police Training
and Education in Pakistan
. However, there are
numerous problems in the recruitment, training
and education of the police in Pakistan. The lower
level recruitment (constable) is done by the
District Police Of
ﬁ
cer. A huge level of corruption
and other mal-practices are observed at various
levels of recruitment in the police, particularly at
the lower level. It is a generally accepted opinion
that an unquali
ﬁ
ed person can be recruited if he/
she pays for recruitment. However, there are no
empirical
ﬁ
ndings in this regard.
12

The major focus of the police trainings and edu-
cation at various police training colleges (e.g. Police
Training College, Hangu, KPK) is on teaching vari-
ous criminal laws (e.g. Pakistan Penal Code,
Criminal Procedure Code, Police Rules, Local and
Special Laws, and Evidence Act etc) and physical
training (e.g. combat
ﬁ
ghting, drills, ri
ﬂ
e musketry,
mob dispersal, traf
ﬁ
c control, and assault courses
etc.). The author conducted a small survey of the
lower level police in 2009 in which the police were
asked about the major problems of the police.
Majority (14.8%) of responded that “inadequate
training facilities/training aides” is the biggest prob-
lem in the police training. Similarly, it was identi
ﬁ
ed
that the police perceive terrorism to be biggest

problem concerning policing these days (22%).
Criticizing the training curricula, Mr. Syed Akhtar
Ali Shah, the Additional Inspector General of Police
(Special Branch) of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa raised a
question on the launching ceremony of Pakistan
Journal of Criminology (April 24, 2012) “can we

ﬁ
ght terrorist through teaching these laws and by
such raw trainings to the police?” He doubted the
af
ﬁ
rmative answer as more than 500 policemen
have been martyred (killed in action) since 2005
and over a thousand have been severely injured in
terrorist attacks.
13


Coming to the impact of the recruitment,
training and education of the police, the indica-
tors are not very positive. There are a huge
number of cases in which the culprits are
marked as untraced by the police.
14 Similarly,
the police remained at the top of the list of the
most corrupt public sector institutions in the
National Corruption Perception Survey 2011
report of Transparency International
2011
,
Pakistan chapter. Although the validity and
reliability of this survey is challenged on many
grounds, it still shows the perception of the
population. Why the public perceive police as
the most corrupt institution? This merits a sep-
arate research.

Likewise, Khan and Sajid
(
2010
) criticized the
poor quality police training and the lack of mod-
ern equipments, and thus commented that the
police are the easy targets for the terrorists due to
these in-suf
ﬁ
ciencies.

17.3.2.4
Police Reforms in Pakistan

Although the history of police reform begins
prior to independence we focus here on the post-
independence developments. There have been
more than two dozens commissions and commit-
tees on revamping, modernizing and reforming
the police through both qualitative and quantita-
tive changes. Unfortunately the reports of all such
bodies (Appendix
9
, Box 7) are not available in
the market, nor published by any government or
displayed on their web sites. None of these
reforms came true or implemented in letter and
spirit due to a variety of reasons—political, eco-
nomic, legal as well as administrative. The most
important was the 1985 Commission and the sub-
sequently Implementation Committee (1991)

ﬁ
ndings and Abbas Khan Report (1996) which
demanded a modern police by replacing the
police law with a new law, formulation of public
safety commission and establishment of national
police agency.

In view of these demands the new Police Order
2002 was promulgated which replaced the Police
Act of 1861. It also resulted in the establishment
of National Police Management Board, National
Police Bureau and the Criminal Justice
Coordination Committee at district level.

Concerns were raised soon after the new law
was implemented and it was amended within the
two months of its implementation. The police
raised concerns whether the reforms are a posi-
tive step. It appeared to be a clumsy grafting of
the Japanese police model into a semi-demo-
cratic, semi-tribal, semi-religious and transi-
tional society of a country which was already
suffering from extremely poor socioeconomic
development (Fasihuddin
2008
)
. The new Police
Order, 2002 is highly comprehensive and
detailed. It is a part of the Access to Justice
Programme
(

http://www.ajp.gov.pk

),
mainly
funded by the Asian Development Bank. In real-
ity, the provision of the required human and
material resources for its proper implementation
is yet to occur. Due to the numerous amendments
in the Police Order 2002, the former senior
of
ﬁ
cers who supported the new system are now
disappointed over the lack of true reforms. For
example, Shigri
(
2005
)
, a retired Inspector
General of Police and a champion of the new
police reforms, terms the amended reforms of
2002 as worse than the 1861 Police Act. He
warned of the dreadful results due to the destruc-
tion of the police command structure. Due to
political exigencies, the present Government of

259
17 Criminology and Criminal Justice System in Pakistan
Pakistan has tolerated signi
ﬁ
cant amendments to
Police Order 2002 by provincial governments
since 2008. Balochistan province has completely
reversed it and the KPK has begun to do so. In
Sindh, it is reversed one day and restored the
other, depending on the political accommodation
of the coalition partners. No new Police Rules
have been framed in light of the new Police Order
2002. The 18th Constitutional Amendment for
devolution of powers has also given rise to
dif
ﬁ
cult legal questions on the new police law.
Only time will resolve this current (2011) ambi-
guity in police reforms.


17.3.3
Prosecution

Prosecution plays a pivotal role in the administra-
tion of justice. A prosecutor or public prosecutor
is an expert of the law to represent the state, in
court proceedings, against the law breaker.
Prosecution in Pakistan was a branch of police
but it has recently been separated, with a view to
achieving a more timely resolution of cases. It is
now made into an independent department after
the promulgation of the Prosecution Ordinance
of 2005.
15

Prosecutors are covered under section 492 of
the CrPC which provides that the provincial gov-
ernment may appoint “generally or in any case, or
for any speci
ﬁ
ed class of cases, in any local area,
one or more of
ﬁ
cers to be called Public
Prosecutors”.
16 As mentioned, the prosecution ser-
vices in all the provinces were under the Home
Department and were administered by the police
until 2005.
17 There was a separate prosecution
branch of the police consisting of law graduates in
the ranks of Deputy Superintendents of Police
(DSP), Inspectors and Sub-Inspectors. This was
considered, however, to be a major reason for poor
prosecution and delay in the resolution of court
cases. During the 1980s, a
ﬁ
rst attempt was made
to transfer administrative control of prosecution
powers from the police to law departments.
18 The
ongoing
vacillation
between
the
Home
Departments
and the Law Departments on this question contin-
ued until prosecution services were permanently
placed under the administrative control of the Law
Departments with the promulgation of the Police
Order, 2002. At present, all the provinces have
laws for separate prosecution services and the
respective provincial prosecution services are at
nascent stages of development (Mirza
2010
)
.

17  An Asian Development Bank soft loan to Pakistan is de
facto primarily responsible for the Access to Justice
Program, in which the state is engaged “in improving justice
delivery, strengthening public oversight over the police, and
establishing specialized and independent prosecution ser-
vices”. In this we see the Police Act 1861 being replaced by
the Police Order 2002 and new laws to constitute and pro-
vide for the functions of independent prosecution services
in Pakistan, thus divorcing prosecution from the investiga-
tive arm of the police. Arguably, more valid grounds can be
cited for the creation of an independent prosecution service
in Pakistan, being article 175(3) of the constitution, which
mandates that “the judiciary shall be separated progres-
sively from the executive within three years from the com-
mencing day”. Thereafter, there was the appeal decided in
Govt. of Sindh v. Sharaf Faridi (PLD 1994 SC 105).

Prosecution Service (Constitution, Functions and
Powers) Act
2005
. After this Act came into oper-
ation, all prosecution services in KPK province,
from the registration of the FIR up to the conclu-
sion of the case by the Supreme Court of Pakistan,
came under the KPK Directorate of Prosecution.

The 2005 Act has 12 sections. The powers
of the prosecutor are immense and are given in
Chapter III.
20
The public prosecutor under the
said ordinance is appointed under section 492
of the CrPC.
21 Once the prosecutor receives a
case
ﬁ
le from the police, the prosecutor reviews
it and has the option to continue with the pros-
ecution, take no further action or divert it away
from the criminal proceedings.
22


17.3.3.2
Organizational Structure
and Responsibilities

The Directorate is classi
ﬁ
ed into three sections:
prosecution, administration, and accounts. The
establishment lies with the Home Department. It
is headed by a Director General assisted by a
Public Prosecutor, Director Legal and Director
Administration/Accounts. The Director General
in essence is the head of Prosecution in the
Directorate. He looks after the Establishment and
Accounts Branches and exercises overall control
over of
ﬁ
cers of the Prosecution Directorate. The
District Public Prosecutors oversee the prosecu-
tion functions in the respective districts and all
the Assistant Public Prosecutors report and take
guidance from the District Public Prosecutor. In
cases where the sanctioned posts cannot be
ﬁ
lled,
the Prosecution Directorate can as a stop-gap
measure appoint Special Public Prosecutors from
the respective bars associations.

17.3.3.3
Major Functions of the
Prosecution Directorate

Normally, the role of the public prosecutor com-
mences after the investigation agency presents
the case in court. The Investigation Of
ﬁ
cer and
the Public Prosecutor work independently of each
other in the new system. Prosecuting of
ﬁ
cers
assist law courts in the disposal of cases. The
Directorate aims to deliver a prompt, ef
ﬁ
cient
and speedy service to the litigant for achieving
the ends of justice, ensuring judiciousness and
speedy legal remedies.
23 Cases registered and
investigated by the police are referred to the pros-
ecution for scrutinizing charge sheets, and after
their institution in the courts, the Assistant Public
Prosecutors conducts the prosecution. They eval-
uate the evidence in each case and make their rec-
ommendations for
ﬁ
ling revision petitions or
appeals against impugned orders and judgments,
as well as conduct cases in Courts. The public
prosecutor has the power to withdraw prosecu-
tion if reasonable grounds exist under section 494
of the CrPC. Consent will be given by the Public
Prosecutor only if public justice in the larger
sense is promoted rather than subverted by such
withdrawal.

20  See generally Chapter III of the North-West Frontier
Province Prosecution Service (Constitution, Functions
and Powers) Act,
2005
.

21  “Public Prosecutor” means a person appointed as Public
Prosecutor under this Act for the purpose of section 492 of
Cr.PC and includes District Public Prosecutor, Additional
Public Prosecutor, Deputy Public Prosecutor and Assistant
Public Prosecutor as well as Special Public Prosecutor.

22  A District Public Prosecutor in case of offences carrying
seven years or less imprisonment and the Director General
Prosecution for all other offences may withdraw prosecution
subject to prior approval of Court. Provided that prosecution
of an offence falling under the Anti Terrorism Act, 1997
(XXVII of 1997), shall not be withdrawn without prior per-
mission in writing of the Secretary to Government, Home
and Tribal Affairs Department. See also Section 494 of CrPC,
“Effect of withdrawal from prosecution. Any Public
Prosecutor may, with the ....] consent of the Court, before the
judgment is pronounced, withdraw from the prosecution of
any person either generally or in respect of any one or more
of the offences for which he is tried, and upon such with-
drawal: (a) if it is made before a charge has been framed, the
accused shall be discharged in respect of such offence or
offences; (b) if it is made after a charge has been framed, or
when under this Code no charge is required, he shall be
acquitted in respect of such offence or offences”.


23  “Preamble of the North-West Frontier Province Prose-
cution Service (Constitution, Functions and Powers) Act,

2005 states that “WHEREAS it is expedient to reorganize
and establish a Prosecution Institution with a view to
achieving a speedy justice process in the North-West
Frontier Province and for matters ancillary or incidental
thereto”.

17 Criminology and Criminal Justice System in Pakistan

17.3.3.4
Performance of Prosecution
in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa

Generally conviction rates by the prosecution
have been abysmally low, but it must be empha-
sized here that the prosecutor places before the
court all the evidence in his or her possession,
whether in favour of or against the accused.
However, most of the time, this motive is misin-
terpreted and prosecutors show no interest in
winning cases in favour of their client.

Overall, the conviction rate in the province is
very low. The data obtained from the Police
Department of the KPK provides an insight into
the conviction rate and the working of the
Prosecution Directorate (See Appendix
10
,
Table
17.11
). Analysis was restricted to 2009 due
to the paucity of information and credible data
for the past years. The average conviction rate of
crimes against substantive law for the year 2009
remained 15.48%. The conviction rate is higher if
convictions under special laws are included, but
the rate of conviction drops when convictions are
recorded under the substantive law.

The conviction rate however, is not indicative
of the ef
ﬁ
ciency of the Prosecution Directorate.
Nonetheless, in the wake of terrorism and the
release of terrorists by the Pakistani Courts is
often blamed on the poor prosecution of the case.
Moreover, the police divide a single crime into
many categories. This is a usual technique of the
police throughout the world and sometimes is
called the “puri
ﬁ
cation of statistics”. Moreover,
the conviction in terrorism cases is extremely low
i.e. 2% at the national level while 5% in KPK
about which even the higher judiciary has taken
serious notice and news in media are of no dearth
to put blame on police or prosecution for such a
low level of conviction (Amin
2011
)
.
24

For any prosecution department to be success-
ful and submit cases with best evidence before
the courts, good relationships with the police
are crucial. The unfortunate in-coordination and

disconnect between police and prosecution often
result in the acquittal of dangerous terrorists who
had been arrested with great dif
ﬁ
culties. It
remains to be seen whether police will accept the
supervisory role of the prosecutor.

17.3.4
Judiciary/Courts

Courts are one of the basic components in all jus-
tice systems. It is the next step after prosecution
in the criminal justice system. When the prosecu-
tor presents all evidences against an alleged
offender and the offender presents his own evi-
dences in defence then the court concludes the
trial and the presiding judge pronounces the judg-
ment. The judgment could be of acquittal or
punishment.
25

17.3.4.1
Structure and Functions
of Courts in Pakistan

The judiciary in Pakistan is composed of three
levels of federal courts, three divisions of lower
courts, and a Supreme Judicial Council. There
are district courts in every district of each prov-
ince, having both civil and criminal jurisdiction
though they deal mainly with civil matters. The
High Court of each province has jurisdiction over
civil and criminal appeals from lower courts
within the provinces. The Supreme Court sits in
Islamabad and has exclusive jurisdiction over
disputes between or among federal and provin-
cial governments, and appellate jurisdiction over
High Court decisions. There is also a Federal
Shariat Court established by Presidential Order
on 26th May 1980. This Court has exclusive
jurisdiction to determine, upon petition by any
citizen or the federal or provincial governments
or on its own motion, whether or not a law con-
forms to the injunctions of Islam. An Islamic
advisory council of
ulama (religious scholars)
assists the Federal Shariat Court in this capacity

High Court is re-established for the capital terri-
tory of Islamabad. The most important part in
criminal justice system is played by the lower
judiciary i.e. District Courts, Session Courts, and
Courts of Magistrate (See Appendix
11 for the
structure of judiciary in Pakistan).

17.3.4.2
District Courts

The district courts of Pakistan are the lowest of
all the courts in the hierarchy, which deal with all
the matters pertaining to civil and criminal nature.
In every district, there is a Court of Sessions
Judge, and the Courts of Magistrates have the
jurisdiction to try the Criminal cases. The offences
punishable with death and cases arising out of the
enforcement of laws relating to
Hudood (Islamic
Laws) are tried by Sessions Judges. The Court of
a Sessions Judge is competent to pass any sen-
tence authorized by law. Offences not punishable
with death are tried by Magistrates. Among the
Magistrates there are Magistrates of 1st Class,
2nd Class and 3rd Class. An appeal against the
sentence passed by a Sessions Judge lies to the
High Court and against the sentence passed by a
Magistrate to the Sessions Judge if the term of
sentence is upto 4 years, otherwise to the High
Court. During the year 2009 the disposal of cases
in District Courts of KPK province was 79,963
while 19,723 were still under trial at the end of
2009 (See Table
17.3 for details). Although the
disposal is higher than the institutions of cases,
however, the pendency slows the justice process
of the courts Table
17.4
.


17.3.4.3
Session Courts

The jurisdiction of the Session Court extends to
the whole district. It is presided by a session
judge appointed
26 who may be assisted by one or
more than one additional session judges. All
magistrates in the district are subordinate to the
session judge. A Session judge has numerous
powers e.g. to conduct trials of all serious crimes
such as robbery, murder and all kinds of homi-
cide, serious thefts by habitual offenders etc. A
death sentence pronounced by the Session judge
can be carried out only after the con
ﬁ
rmation by
the High Court. Appeals from the courts of
Magistrates go to Session Court. All session
judges have the power of the justice of the peace
and they can exercise the same powers as the
police u/s 54 and 55 of the Code of Criminal
Procedure. An ex-of
ﬁ
cio justice of the peace may
issue appropriate direction to the police authori-
ties concerned on a complaint regarding non-
registration of criminal case; transfer of
investigation from one police of
ﬁ
cer to another;
and neglect, failure or excess committed by a
police authority in relation to its function and
duties.
27 (See Appendix
12 for details).

17.3.4.4
Judicial Magistrate Courts

In every town and city there are numerous civil and
judicial magistrate courts. Magistrates with power
of Section 30 of Cr.P.C can hear all matters and
offences of criminal nature, where there is no death
penalty (such as for attempted murder, dacoity, rob-
bery, extortion) but he can pass sentence only up to
7 years or less. If the court thinks the accused
deserves more punishment than 7 years then it has
to refer the matter to some higher court with its rec-
ommendations. Every magistrate court is allocated
a jurisdiction that is usually one or more Police
Stations in the area. The trial of all non bailable
offences including police remand notices, accused
discharges, arrest and search warrants bail applica-
tions are heard and decided by Magistrate Courts.

Magistrate 1st class has the power to try
offences punishable up to 3 years imprisonment
and
ﬁ
fty thousand rupees
ﬁ
ne. Magistrate 2nd
class has the power to try offences punishable up
to 1 year and
ﬁ
ve thousand rupees
ﬁ
ne. Magistrate
3rd class has the power to try offences punishable
up to 1 month and one thousand rupees
ﬁ
ne.

17.3.4.5
Judicial Reforms in Pakistan

In early 2001 a huge programme of judicial
reforms was initiated with the
ﬁ
nancial support
from Asian Development Bank (ADB). The proj-
ect was worth US $350 million (P&D
2006
)
. There
were four (4) main objectives of the programme,

26
u/s 9 of the code of criminal procedure 1898.

27
Amendment through ordinance no OXXXI of 2002 by
inserting Sub section (6) in 22.A of the code of criminal
procedure 1898.

17.3.5
Prison

Like all other institutions of the criminal justice
system, Pakistan inherited the prisons set-up from
the British colonial period. This system was used
as an instrument to suppress political opponents
and to neutralize threats to Crown rule. After inde-
pendence, the prisons and prison departments as a
whole remained a low-priority for Government.
However, prisons remained an exclusively provin-
cial concern in the successive constitutions of the
Republic of Pakistan. Provincial Governments did
make efforts to maintain and improve the existing
prisons. Quite a few numbers of new jails were
constructed in the last 50 years on the recommen-
dations of various prisons reform committees
(Khan
2010
)
.

17.3.5.1
Structure and Functions
of Prisons in Pakistan

At present there are ninety-nine (99) prisons in
Pakistan including Azad Kashmir and Gilgit-
Baltistan which includes four Women Jails (one
jail in Punjab i.e. Women Jail, Multan and three
jails in Sindh Province i.e. Women Jail, Larkana,
Women Jail, Karachi and Special Women Jail,
Hyderabad). However, women prisoners are also
kept in separate portions of other jails.

It also includes two Borstal Institutions and
Juvenile Jails i.e. B.I.&J.Jail, Bahawalpur and
B.I.&J.Jail, Faisalabad. Juvenile prisoners are also
kept in the Youthful Offenders Industrial School,
Karachi and separate portions of other jails of the
country. In his article, Prison System in Pakistan,
Muhammad Masood Khan mentions the objec-
tives of the prison are to provide custody, control,
care, correction and cure of the inmates. As far as
the functions of prison is concerned they include
executing the sentence awarded by the Court;
maintenance, care, custody and transfer of prison-
ers; maintenance of orders and discipline amongst
the prisoners; control of expenditure relating to
prison management; enforcement of Prison Act,
1894, all laws, rules/regulations and orders per-
taining to the protection and maintenance of
prison/prisoners; imparting useful education/
training to the prisoners in various trades/skills
and other vocational disciplines for their rehabili-
tation; and organizing of recreational programmes,
welfare measures and psychological counseling
of inmates for their correction and rehabilitation.

17 Criminology and Criminal Justice System in Pakistan

17.3.5.2
Prison Statistics

As mentioned above, there are a total of 99

prisons in Pakistan. Out of the total, 32 prisons
are in Punjab, 22 in Sindh, 23 in KPK, 11 in
Balochistan, 5 in Gilgit-Baltistan and 6 in Azad
Kashmir. Furthermore, 25 of the total prisons are
the Central Jails situated in major cities of
Pakistan, 50 are District Jails, 9 are Sub Jails, 5
are speci
ﬁ
ed jails for women, 5 Juvenile Jails, 1
Special Prison and 4 Judicial Lock-ups.

The situation in Pakistani prisons is very
unhealthy. Mostly the prisons are overcrowded.
As it can be seen from Table
17.11 that the pris-
ons in Pakistan have the capacity for only 42,670
prisoners while they are carrying out a population
of 78,328 prisoners i.e. about 83% more than the
authorized capacity (See Table
17.5 for details).
Based on this information, it can be concluded
that there were 44.2 prison inmates per 100,000
population. It is extremely low level of inmates
when compared by international standards. For
example, the per capita inmates in the US are 737
per 100,000 population, 615 in Russia, 148 in the
UK, 118 in China, and 125 in Australia
(International Center for Prison Studies
2012
)
.
30


Of course there is overcrowding, but that is
because Pakistan has a very outdated colonial
prison system, and the overall number of 44.2 per
100,000 has not come about because Pakistan is
overly non-punitive, it is a resource problem.
Similarly, there is 83% over capacity mentioned
is very interesting with a prison population of
78,328. However, compared to Pakistan, the
number of inmates in the United States is
2,193,798 i.e. 96% more than the prison popula-
tion in Pakistan. Pakistan would have had a prison
population between 1.3 and 1.4 million inmates
if they had been on the level of the United
States.

Besides overcrowding, Masood Khan
(
2010
)
,
who is the Principal of the National Institute of
Prison Administration, now called National
Academy for Prison Administration (NAPA),
Lahore—the chief staff training institute of pris-
ons and prison data collection agency in the
country—identi
ﬁ
ed a number of other issues and
problems including shortage of manpower to run
the prisons, inadequate security devices, unhy-
gienic water and food and lack of recreational
facilities for the inmates. Though the jail admin-
istration generally talks of these perennial issues
and chronic problems being faced by them, no
reports or research papers are available on any of
the above. Like police, the prison of
ﬁ
cials com-
plain of challenges but rarely have any solutions.
A formal review of Pakistani prisons is required.

17.3.5.3
Prison Reforms

There have been voices regarding prison reforms,
however, no concrete step has been taken by any
administration for bringing any conclusive reforms
in prison system. The most visible step taken by
any government in the country is the release of
prisoners, or remission of sentence of some pris-
oners on special occasions like the Independence
day or
Eid
day. According to the Principal of
NAPA, the jail rules of Pakistan are very old and
are un
ﬁ
t for the present over-crowded and over-
burdened jails with poor ventilation and other sys-
tems. No concrete steps have been taken for using
the prisoners as a labour for producing industrial
goods, thereby contributing to the local economy.


17.3.6
Probation

Imprisonment is not the only way to respond to
the criminals. There are various alternative meth-
ods to imprisonment including probation which
is arguably one of the most progressive contribu-
tions to modern criminal policy (Qureshi
1999
)
.
It is a very important agency in criminal justice
system. Those offenders who, according to the
court, are likely to be reformed, and who are not
dangerous to society, are not sentenced to impris-
onment and are kept on probation under the
supervision of the state-probation of
ﬁ
cer.
Probation is “a period of time when a criminal
must behave well and not commit any more
crimes in order to avoid being sent to prison”

(Probation

)
. As de
ﬁ
ned by Elrod and Ryder,
it is the supervised release of an individual by a
court (Elrod and Ryder
2005
)
. In the words of
McLaughlin and Muncie
(
2001
) probation is the
supervision of offenders in conditions of freedom
by designated of
ﬁ
cers of the court (sometimes
called probation of
ﬁ
cers or community correc-
tions of
ﬁ
cers). Nowadays regarded as an “alter-
native to prison”, though, historically, has been
viewed as an “alternative to punishment”.
31

Islamic philosophy of crime does not profess
hating the criminal rather it professes hating the
crime and reforming the criminal. Quoting from
Ibn-Timya on philosophy of punishment, one
scholar, Qadir
(

1988

)
, comments that “Islam is a
blessing and benevolence to humanity, not punish-
ment. Therefore, those who award punishment must
take into consideration the principles of blessing
and benevolence. Punishment by state is similar to
the father punishing his child or the doctor treating
the illness of a patient”. He further comments that
“the concept of punishment is for the reformation of
the individual and the society”. Similarly, the proba-
tion system is based on the philosophy of “eradicat-
ing the crime not the criminal”. Many Islamic
scholars quoted various sayings of the Prophet
Muhammad (Peace Be Upon Him) and the Quranic
verses for reformation and correction. To quote one
example from the Quran, see the translation of the
verse 6:54 by Dr. Abdul Majeed Aulak:

“
and when those who believe in Our (Allah’s) Verses
come to you, please tell them, peace be upon you.
Your Rub (Sustainer) has prescribed for Himself
Mercy so that whoso of you commits some misdeed
due to ignorance and repents thereafter and amends
himself, then surely Allah is Forgiving Merciful”.


Probation department in Pakistan performs its
functions under The Good Conduct Prisoner’s
Probational Release Act 1926, Probation of
Offenders Ordinance 1960, and JJSO 2000, and
the rules formulated under various laws (Sajid

2009

)
. According to 3rd and 4th periodic report on
Convention on the Rights of the Child submitted
by Pakistan, “there is lack of awareness about the
[probation] system and its signi
ﬁ
cance. Police,
prison of
ﬁ
cials and even in the ranks of lower judi-
ciary there is lack of awareness concerning proba-
tion system”. Similarly, Sajid
(

2009
) reported that
only 2% of the police have heard about the JJSO
and less than 1% has read the JJSO.

17.3.6.1
Probation Procedures

The Probation of Offenders Ordinance (1960),
Section 5 empowers the Judiciary/courts to place
certain offenders on probation not more than 3 years
who are eligible for release on probation. After
release of offenders on probation, the Reclamation
and Probation (R&P) department in the province is
to supervise, monitor and rehabilitate them in the
community. Probation and parole of
ﬁ
cer plays the
key role in the whole process of probation system
from release of offenders to successful rehabilita-
tion (Bhutta
2010
)
. Judicial Magistrate Court,
Session Court, and other Courts are authorized to
release any offender on probation in Pakistan.

In some circumstances the courts allow condi-

32  Section 4 of THE PROBATION OF OFFENDERS
ORDINANCE, 1960, Ordinance No. XLV of 1960

4. Conditional discharges, etc.
—
(1) Where a court by
which a person, not proved to have been previously con-
victed, is convicted of an offence punishable with impris-
onment for not more than two years is of opinion, having
regard to:—(a) the age, character, antecedents or physical
or mental condition of the offender, and (b) the nature of
the offence or any extenuating circumstances attending the
commission of the offence,that it is inexpedient to in
ﬂ
ict
punishment and that a probation order is not appropriate,
the court may, after recording its reasons in writing, make
an order discharging him after if admonition,, or, if the
court thinks
ﬁ
t, it may likewise make an order discharging
him subject to the condition that he enters into a bond, with
or without sureties, for committing no offence and being of
good behaviour during such period not exceeding one year
from the date of the order as may be speci
ﬁ
ed therein. (2)
An order discharging a person subject to such condition as
aforesaid is hereafter in this Ordinance referred to as “an
order for conditional discharge”, and the period speci
ﬁ
ed in
any such order as “the period of conditional discharge”. (3)
Before making an order for conditional discharge, the court
shall explain to the offender in ordinary language that if he
commits any offence or does not remain of good behaviour
during the period of conditional discharge he will be liable
to be sentenced for the original offence.(4) Where a person
conditionally discharged under this section is sentenced for
the offence in respect of which the order for conditional
discharge was made, that order shall cease to have effect.

mental condition of the offender, and nature of
the offence. In case of woman offender, any
woman can be conditionally discharged having
any sentence except death sentence.

17.3.6.2
Social Investigation Report

After hearing the arguments of the prosecution
and the defence, if the Court feels the case
ﬁ
t for
probation, then it orders the Probation Of
ﬁ
cer to
submit SIR that includes information regarding
the character, antecedents, commission and
nature of offence, and home surroundings and
other circumstances about the offender who is
likely to be released on probation.

17.3.6.3
Functions of the Probation
Of
ﬁ
cer

The probation of
ﬁ
cer performs numerous func-
tions. One of the major functions of the probation
of
ﬁ
cer is to endeavour to
ﬁ
nd suitable employment
for the probationer and assist, befriend, advise and
strive to improve his conduct and general condi-
tions of living (see Appendix
13
for details of all
the functions of Probation Of
ﬁ
cer). However, the
probation of
ﬁ
cers can rarely perform most of the
functions prescribed by the law. When asked in an
informal interview, the Director of the Probation
Directorate, KPK, said that “the job scale of the
probation of
ﬁ
cer is very low, and that there is
extreme lack of facilities for the probation of
ﬁ
cers
in districts, e.g. no vehicle for travelling etc”.


17.3.6.4
Probation Statistics

Table
17.6 presents some vital statistics about
probation in Pakistan. As on March, 2010 there
were a total of 65 probation of
ﬁ
cers including 7
female of
ﬁ
cers in Pakistan observing 23,197 pro-
bationers in the whole country. It means there
were 356 probationers under the supervision of
each of
ﬁ
cer—a huge burden indeed. As far as
juveniles are concerned, there were a total of 295
juveniles under probation in Pakistan.


The majority of the probationers in all catego-
ries (91% of all probationers) were in Punjab
province. The province of KPK has 6 female pro-
bation of
ﬁ
cers while other provinces, except
Punjab, have no female probation of
ﬁ
cer even
though they have female probationers in supervi-
sion as evident from the above-mentioned table.
It means the male probation of
ﬁ
cers are supervis-
ing the female probationers in these provinces.

17.3.6.5
Parole System

Parole contains different meanings depending on
the context. However, in criminal justice, it refers
to the early release of a prisoner who has been
noted as bearing good conduct during a certain
period of his imprisonment. The law of Pakistan
(The Good Conduct Prisoners’ Probational
Release Act 1926) states that a person who is
con
ﬁ
ned in prison under a sentence of imprison-
ment, and it appears from his antecedents or his
conduct in the prison that he is likely to abstain
from crime and lead useful and industrious life, if
he is released from prison, he may be permitted
to be released by license on condition that he be
placed under the supervision or authority of a
suitable person named in the license and willing
to take charge of the prisoner.
33 Under the law, it


268
Fasihuddin
is called conditional release or Parole release.
However, this is the least developed branch of
CJS in Pakistan after Probation and Prosecution.

17.3.6.6
Parole Procedures

When the provincial government identi
ﬁ
es a pris-
oner with good conduct and it is decided that the
identi
ﬁ
ed prisoner may be released on parole, than
the provincial government through Reclamation
and Probation department issues a license to the
said prisoner. The prisoner released on parole is
called a parolee. The parolee is to be engaged in
suitable environments under the supervision of
Parole of
ﬁ
cer of the Reclamation & Probation
(R&P) department in his/her respective province.
The parolees are employed with approved employ-
ers of R&P department on
ﬁ
xed wages and under
speci
ﬁ
c terms and conditions (Bhutta
2010
)
. The
license is in force until the date on which the per-
son released would, in the execution of the order or
warrant authorizing his imprisonment, have been
discharged from prison had he not been released
on license, or until the license is revoked, which-
ever is sooner (Section 3 of the Good Conduct
Prisoners’ Probational Release Act 1926).


17.3.6.7
Selection of Prisoners Eligible
for Parole Release

The cases of prisoners who are likely to be
released on parole may be taken up by the
Assistant Director R&P department on applica-
tion of the prisoner, on application of the relative
or friend of the prisoner, on recommendation of
the Superintendent of jail, or the Assistant
Director and Parole Of
ﬁ
cer visit jail for selection
of prisoner suitability to be released on parole.

17.3.6.8
Functions of the Parole Of
ﬁ
cer

Bhutta (
2010
) provided a long list of all the
functions of a parole of
ﬁ
cer in Pakistan. The
major functions, among them, were supervision
and rehabilitation of the offenders placed on
parole, assist prison administration in prepara-
tion of rolls of selected prisoners for parole
release, and assist parolees in
ﬁ
nding suitable
employment.

It is to be noted that the duties of Parole of
ﬁ
cers
are assigned to Probation of
ﬁ
cers in many districts
of Pakistan as there is shortage of Parole staff in
R&P department of each province.


17.3.6.9
Parole Statistics

Table
17.7
provides some useful statistics regard-
ing parole in Pakistan. Out of the 17 parole of
ﬁ
cers,
56% are male of
ﬁ
cers. The highest number of
parole of
ﬁ
cers is found in the Punjab province, i.e.
almost 59%. However, it is not astonishing by the
fact that the highest number of prisoner is also
found in the Punjab province (66%).



As far as the parolees are concerned, there
were a total of 191 parolees at March 30, 2010
in all the provinces. All the parolees were male.
More than 50% of the prisoners were on parole
in the Punjab province, while 42% parolees
were found to be from the Balochistan prov-
ince, a province with a total of 2,946 prisoners
as compared to 52,318 prisoners in the Punjab
(See Table
17.11
). It appears that the parole
rate is highest in Balochistan province, i.e.
27.16 per 1000 prison population as compared
to 1.89 in the Punjab and less than 1 in other
two provinces. The reasons are yet to be
researched.

17 Criminology and Criminal Justice System in Pakistan

17.4

Conclusion

The development of criminology in Pakistan is
still in its infancy. There are a very few Universities
offering courses in criminology. The criminal
justice system in Pakistan has not been very suc-
cessful in delivering justice. The Access to Justice
Programme, a huge programme of US $350 mil-
lion, launched in (2001), to reform the criminal
justice system does not seem to have achieved its
targets in terms of police, legal and judicial
reforms.

The police are facing the new challenges of
the twenty-
ﬁ
rst century. The biggest among
those is terrorism. Under the new police
reforms, National Public Safety Commission,
National Police Bureau and Criminal Justice
Coordination Committee have been established
on various levels. However, neither the perfor-
mance nor image of the police is improved,
despite the new police law in 2002. The Police
Rules of 1934 are still not revised and
amended.

Prosecution has been developed into a sepa-
rate department since 2005. Since then, the pros-
ecution system has not gone positively, rather the
rate of conviction has remained at very lower lev-
els. Despite its separation in 2005 it still has to
formulate proper rules and procedures for its
operation. Proper trainings and developing pro-
fessional attitude in the prosecution of
ﬁ
cials will
help improve its image.

The courts are overburdened. The National
Judicial Policy (2009) was a good initiative by
the National Judicial Policy Making Committee.
The policy aims at providing speedy justice. The
policy is revised recently by the committee.
However, it is yet to be seen whether the policy is
properly implemented or otherwise.

The prisons are overcrowded and there seems
no modernization of the colonial prison adminis-
tration. However, inmate population per capita is
far lower than the international standards in
Pakistan. The department of probation is also
poorly developed and the system of parole and
probation has yet to gain strong grounds in
Pakistan.

In the
ﬁ
nal analysis, the criminal justice sys-
tem is a colonial relic which is not compatible to
the socio-cultural environment of Pakistan. To
make this system a success, assistance of the
international criminal justice community is
needed. Promotion of criminology, policing sci-
ences and security studies will be one of the
major steps towards a better understanding and
reforms in the criminal justice system of Pakistan.
Indigenous research and learning from interna-
tional scholarship and best practices should be
the aim of all those who are committed to see
criminology as a developed discipline in Pakistan.
For this purpose, the Pakistan Society of
Criminology is committed to establish an Institute
of Criminology, Research, Security Studies and
Justice Education.

Introduction

The Criminal Justice system in Sri Lanka has
undergone transformations in the last
ﬁ
ve
decades. The early traditional method of the
administration of criminal justice is no longer
limited to punishing the perpetrator with a puni-
tive approach to satisfy the victim. The (recent)
history of the criminal justice system in Sri Lanka
shows us that the philosophy of the primeval
administration of criminal justice based primarily
on the retributive/punitive concept is being
replaced by the restorative concept, a process
which involves the reintegration of both the
offender and the victim within the community.
Today, the wrongdoer of a criminal offence is not
considered (only) as an enemy of the society who
should be treated harshly by imposing severe
punishment but as a person who needs treatment
to overcome his/her status of criminality in order
to be reintegrated into the society as a law-abid-
ing citizen. Further, the victim of crime is also
being looked upon as a person who needs support
to recover from physical, mental, economical and
other losses that have occurred due to the crime
committed by the offender, in addition to reha-
bilitation and reintegration into society in order
to be free from the victimized mentality. New
methods have been introduced to the criminal
justice system to deter crime, sanction the perpe-
trators, rehabilitate the offenders, support the vic-
tims of crime, develop the victim offender
mediation and
ﬁ
nally control the human behav-
iour and protect the society from crimes and
criminals.

This paper focuses on such new methods and
the transformation from retributive to restorative
justice in the criminal justice system in Sri Lanka
with a special focus on the treatment of offend-
ers. Further, the study examines whether these
means and methods have affected the crime rate
in Sri Lanka. The full paper contains three main
parts including the response to crime and retribu-
tive theory of justice, the history of the criminal
justice system and retributive justice and the

concept of restorative justice, its practices and
new methods of treating the offender. The study
also explains the crime problem in Sri Lanka,
mentioning the statistical data relating to crimes,
especially the grave crimes.

18.2

Statistics of Crime in Sri Lanka

Commission of crime is an inherent habit of
human beings which is being changed due to
various reasons including socio-economic, cul-
tural and political reasons. The nature and the
magnitude of the criminal offences have under-
gone a remarkable change over the years. Sri
Lanka is not an exception to this phenomenon.
Among the other factors, rapid economic and
social development, 30 years of civil war and
changes of lifestyle have provided a consider-
able in
ﬂ
uence to the commission of crime.
Though it is disputed by some groups, the
increasing brutality of crimes and the crime rate
including reconviction and recidivism reveal the
necessity of new way of thinking of crime prob-
lem, especially in dealing with the offenders
(See Table
18.1
). The frequency with which
crimes are committed is much higher than that in
the past. This situation directs the policy makers
to pay their high attention towards the issue. An
effective role of the agencies of criminal justice
system in the country is also essential to curb the
crime problem (See Table
18.2
). The following
statistics may impart a rough idea of the crime
problem in Sri Lanka.


The crime rate of Sri Lanka has gradually
increased in the past years. The following statis-
tics revealed the gradual increase of grave crime
in Sri Lanka during the last 5 years.

18.3

Response to Crime
and Retributive Justice

Reaction or response to crime has been diverse at
different periods of human civilization. Even at a
particular time it has been different in various
societies. Certainly, there is a necessity of reac-
tion to crime in order to control certain unlawful
human behaviour and to protect law-abiding peo-
ple from crimes and criminals. According to the
general meaning of crime, it is an act that sub-
jects the wrongdoer to punishment; it is the com-
mission or omission of an act speci
ﬁ
cally
forbidden by public law or criminal law
(Marckwardt
1995
, p. 360; Della
1995
, p. 318).

People show their denunciation towards crime
by reacting against it either in a formal or an
informal manner. Institutions such as family,
schools, peer groups, organized religions and
other organized bodies like factories and compa-
nies have their own sets of rules based on social
norms to react against the member of those insti-
tutions for violating those norms in an informal
manner. Some informal responses are labelling,
ignoring, warning, in
ﬂ
icting mild corporal pun-
ishments and terminating of jobs which are based
only on retributive concept. Similarly, if a person
violates criminal law which is a threat to the
guilty and a separate branch of public law where
crimes and punishment are prescribed, the soci-
ety may
ﬁ
le an action against the perpetrator (in
the name of the State) where the court has the
power to impose formal punishment on the
offender according to the law. Thus, societies jus-
tify the reaction to crime for moral reasons which
re
ﬂ
ect the attitude towards crime, criminal and
basic values of a particular society at a particular
time.

The formal reaction to crime is carried out by
the criminal justice system which has the main
goals of upholding social control, deterring
crimes, sanctioning those who violate criminal
laws with punishment and rehabilitating and rein-
tegrating them into the society as law-abiding
citizens. There are three types of application of
laws in relation to the criminal behaviour of a
person (criminal justice): retributive justice based
on punishment, distributive justice based on ther-
apeutic treatment of offenders and restorative
justice based on restitution (Eglash Albert
1977
,
pp. 91, 92; Daniel and Strong
1997
, p. 24).

Retributive justice is a theory of justice which
considers that punishment is a morally acceptable
response to crime, with an eye to the satisfaction
and physiological bene
ﬁ
t bestowed to the
aggrieved party and society (Retributive Justice).

It is probably the most ancient justi
ﬁ
cation of reac-
tion to crime (Gobert and Dine
1993
, p. 22). Under

retributive justice, crime is an individual act where
the liability for the commission of the act is
de
ﬁ
ned as punishment. The criminal responsibility/
punishment is imposed only on the particular per-
petrator according to the magnitude of the offence
committed by the perpetrator. This idea was
expressed by the biblical dictum: eye for an eye and
tooth for a tooth. In primitive societies/tribal societ-
ies where the concept of retributive justice was well
established, the offender was regarded as an enemy
of the tribe and he/she was punished with the same
severity of the offence in order to get the revenge
from him/her. This notion was present in the Hebrew
Doctrine of Divine Sanction which was subjected
to the will of Jehovah and Mosaic Law. Further, the
Code of Hammurabi, the oldest
written ancient
penal practice, accepted that the punishment
imposed on the offender should be equal to the
weight of the crime as literally as possible (Dyneley

2010
, pp. 601–609; Packer
1968
, pp. 37–38; Munshi

2003
). However, even today, retributive justice is
appreciated in “just deserts” (proportionally) prin-
ciple in many parts of the world.

As one of its main characteristics, retributive
justice focuses on establishing guilt on the past
behaviour of the wrongdoers and the offenders
are perhaps considered as an unwanted group of
people who deserve to suffer due to wrongful
behaviour. In other words retributive justice is a
process of backward-looking and punishment
that is warranted as a response to a past event of
injustice or wrongdoing. It acts to reinforce rules
that have been broken by the offender and bal-
ance the scales of justice. Therefore, the main
purpose of the retributive justice is that the
offender is to be punished simply due to the

commission of crime. It is clear in the philosophy
established by the retributive advocates such
as Mabbott
(
1969
, pp. 39–64), Murphy
(

1994
,
pp. 44–77), and Moberly
(1996, p. 145).
According to these retributive advocates the
rationale behind retributive justice is that a good
deed deserves to be crowned with a reward
whereas a bad deed should be meted out with a
bad reaction, namely, suffering without consider-
ing the consequences. Their suffering should be
of the same magnitude as that of their victims.
The inherent threats/sufferings of punishment
may deter crime and sometimes change the
behaviour of the offender as to a better person.

Under the retributive justice, crime is under-
stood as an offence against the State and
de
ﬁ
ned as a violation of the law. Another fea-
ture of the retributive justice emphasizes the
adversarial relationship between the accused
and the State, and the victims of crime are
peripheral to the justice process and repre-
sented abstractly by the State. According to the
general feature of the adversary system, in the
traditional and conventional model of judicial
system of trial, the State has all the rights to
conduct the prosecution and impose punish-
ment on the offender. (Adversarial system is a
judicial system of trial in English legal system
(practiced in Great Britain, most common-
wealth countries, and the USA except the US
State of Louisiana and Canada’s Quebec prov-
ince). In this system, a case is argued by two
opposing sides who have the primary responsi-
bility for
ﬁ
nding and presenting facts. The

prosecutor tries to prove the defendant is guilty,
and the defendant’s attorney argues for the


287
18 Thinking for New Horizonin Criminal Justice...

defendant’s acquittal. The case is then decided
by a judge and punishments are prescribed.)
Therefore, when a crime is reported, the State
starts to discharge its responsibility assuming
the State as a party of the criminal case while
placing the victim in the category of a mere wit-
ness. The main agencies in the criminal justice
system pay whole attention only to the offender
to punish or otherwise rehabilitate him/her and
the victim is regarded as a mere witness in the
battle between the State and the accused (Barrett

2001
, pp. 1–2; Hogg
1992
, p. 836).

18.3.1
History of Criminal Justice
System and Retributive Justice
in Sri Lanka

In examining the history of criminal justice sys-
tem in Sri Lanka,
ﬁ
ve main distinct periods
could be identi
ﬁ
ed according to chronological
order, namely: period before the European pow-
ers occupied the island (before 1505 A.D.),
period during the Portuguese occupation
(1505 A.D.–1656 A.D.), period during the
Dutch occupation (1656 A.D.–1796 A.D.),
period during the British occupation (1796 A.D.–
1947 A.D.) and post-independence period
(1947 A.D.–to date).

During the reign of Kings in ancient Ceylon,
the King was the top of the hierarchy of Courts
and the source of all justice. With regard to the
criminal justice system during this period, the
hierarchy of Courts made it possible to appeal
from a judgment of the lowest Court, i.e.

Gansabhawa, the lowest Court (council) which
had both civil and criminal jurisdiction in cases
of petty offences and in boundary disputes
(Hayley
1972
, pp. 59–62), to the King (Hayley

1972
, pp. 58–73). History shows us that the
retributive justice was the dominant theory
adopted by the criminal justice system in ancient
Ceylon as well. Literature of the legal history of
the country reveals some important information
of punishment (
danda
). There were four main
types of
danda based on the retributive concept:
They were
kayadanda (corporal punishments),

vachidanda (verbal punishments),
dhanadanda
(
ﬁ
nancial punishment) and
manodanda (mental
punishment).

Death, mutilation,
ﬂ
ogging, whipping by cane,
banishment, downgrading to the
Rhodiyas (the
people who belonged to the lowest cast in ancient
Ceylon), putting into jail (
dangage/maha hirage
)
and cutting off hair were the modes of corporal
punishment. Death, mutilation and
ﬂ
ogging were
imposed on offenders for serious offences such
as murder, conspiracy against King, etc.
Reprimand was a verbal punishment imposed for
minor offences to show anger and disapproval of
crime in the Sinhalese law which comprised
Buddhist law, Hindu law,
Tesawalamai law,
Islamic law and Mukkuwar law but today is more
commonly referred to as Kandyan Law (Cooray

1971
, p. 3). Being cursed was represented in

manodanda
in
ﬂ
icted
for
minor
offences.
Con
ﬁ
scation of properties was the common mode
represented in
dhanadanda.

The Portuguese arrived in Ceylon in 1505
A.D. (Cooray
1971
, p. 4). By the
Malwana
Convention,
1 an Ordinary and a Supreme Tribunal
(General’s Court) were established to hear minor
criminal matters and serious offences, respec-
tively. By the same convention the Portuguese
agreed to administer the laws of the Sinhalese in
the coastal areas where they were settled and in
power (Cooray
1971
, pp. 26 and 194; Nadaraja

1972
, p. 5; Tambiah
1977
, pp. 3, 4 and 27).
Therefore, they did not introduce their own sys-
tem of law to Ceylon (Tambiah
1977
, p. 4). Thus,
the laws relating to punishment during the period
of the Portuguese occupation appear to have been
the Sinhalese laws (Cooray
1971
, p. 5).

The Dutch occupied Ceylon in 1656 A.D.
They ruled the Maritime Provinces (Coastal
Areas) from 1656 to 1796 and introduced their
law, the Roman Dutch Law, to Ceylon (Cooray

1971
, p. 194; Nadaraja
1972
, p. 5; Tambiah

1977
, pp. 3, 4). Criminal justice was adminis-
tered in
Radd van Justitie
(the High Court of
Justice) in the case of serious criminal offences.
Further, judicial power was exercised by certain
European of
ﬁ
cials such as the
ﬁ
scal, the chief

1  This Convention came into operation in 1957.


288
M.A.D.S.J.S. Niriella
residents and some military of
ﬁ
cers, and the
local chiefs such as
disavanis and
korala (local
of
ﬁ
cials who had the power to hear minor crimi-
nal matters over local persons). Dutch also con-
tinued to impose the same modes of punishments
used by the Portuguese.

The British occupation of Ceylon is reported as
of 1796 A.D. They captured all parts of the
Maritime Provinces which were under Dutch
power. By introducing a number of reforms to the
law operating in the Maritime Provinces, the
British developed the administration of justice.
British
rulers
issued
several
important
Proclamations to reform the existing penal system
at that time. By the Proclamation of 23rd of
September 1799, torture and all kinds of inhuman
and barbarous forms of punishment (specially the
public execution) were abolished. A uniform sys-
tem of Court procedure and a uniform system for
execution (hanging) were introduced by the
Proclamation of March 23rd 1826. All degrading
and inhuman modes of punishment were prohib-
ited by the Proclamation of 04th October 1799. By
regulation No. 04 of 1820, all kinds of mutilation
were prohibited. The classi
ﬁ
cation of crimes and
establishment of a new Supreme Court of criminal
justice consisting of the Chief Justice were intro-
duced by the Charter of 18th April 1801. The for-
mation of a uniform system of justice throughout
the Island was introduced by the Charter of 1833
on the recommendation of the Colebrook Cameron
report. The whole Kandyan criminal law (criminal
law which applied to locals) was abolished and the
“Law of the Maritime Provinces” was substituted
by Ordinance No. 5 of 1852. The Penal Code
Ordinance No. 2 of 1883, a model of the Indian
Penal Code of 1860 which was based on English
Law Principles, was introduced in 1883. Section 3
of the Penal Code expressly abolished the Roman
Dutch criminal law in order to settle the uncertain-
ties in the general law. The Criminal Procedure
Code of Ceylon was introduced in 1882 to govern
the procedure relating to criminal matters in the
country. It was replaced by the Criminal Procedure
Code No. 15 of 1898 which remained until 1973.

Sri Lanka gained independence in 1948, and for
the purpose of this study the intervening period up
to the present time will be discussed. Sri Lanka has
been governed by various political parties elected
by Sri Lankan citizens. Although these govern-
ments introduced numerous laws under their legis-
lative powers, there was no signi
ﬁ
cant alteration in
either the substantive criminal law or the law of
criminal procedure, except for a few amendments.
With regard to the Penal Code, some signi
ﬁ
cant
amendments have been introduced where punish-
ment is concerned, e.g. the Penal Code (Amendment)
Act, No. 22 of 1995, and the Penal Code
(Amendment) Act, No. 29 of 1998. Two very
important changes were made to the criminal proce-
dure, namely, the Administration of Justice Law
No. 44 of 1973 and the Code of Criminal Procedure
(CPC) Act No. 15 of 1979. Furthermore, recently a
few amendments were introduced to the CPC Act.
Among them the CPC (Amendment) Act, No. 17 of
1997, the CPC (Amendment) Act, No. 47 of 1999,
and the Community Based Correction Act, No. 46
of 1999, are most important for the purpose of the
present study.


18.3.2
Present Criminal Justice
System and Retributive
Theory of Justice

Similar to the other countries, until recently, the
criminal justice in Sri Lanka has been dominated
by retributive justice based on punishment. The
State maintains law and order, ensures confor-
mity with its rules and prosecutes and punishes
those who violate it. The Police, the Court and
the Prison and other Correctional Centres func-
tion as main State Institutions in this process. The
Penal Code Ordinance No. 2 of 1883 and the
CPC Act No. 15 of 1979 are the main Acts which
set out the legal provisions for dealing with crim-
inal matters in Sri Lanka.

The existing procedural law relating to criminal
cases is set out in the CPC Act enacted in 1979.
The rules relating to police investigation, arresting
the suspect, searching the premises, releasing sus-
pect/accused on bail, instituting the proceedings
and conducting trials and appeal are laid down in
this legal code. Further, the provisions (sections 13
and 14) in the CPC permit the Magistrate’s Court
and the High Court in First Instance to hear crimi-


289
18 Thinking for New Horizonin Criminal Justice...
nal cases, and to impose punishments on the con-
victed offender under the provisions of the Penal
Code or any other written law which prescribes
any act as a criminal offence.

The substantive criminal law of Sri Lanka is
embodied primarily in the Penal Code and other
Statutes which prescribe some human behaviour
as criminal offences corresponding with punish-
ment. The legal system in Sri Lanka provides
penal provisions (section 52 of the Penal Code)
for some modes of punishment such as the death
penalty, rigorous and simple imprisonment, for-
feiture of property,
ﬁ
ne and whipping. This struc-
ture of the modes of punishment in the Penal
Code con
ﬁ
rms the retributive approach in
responding crimes. The dominated view of “just
deserts” compelled the criminal justice system to
prosecute in the name of the State and punish the
wrongdoers more commonly with imprisonment
or
ﬁ
ne according to the magnitude of the criminal
offence. Death and forfeiture of property are the
other two modes of punishment in
ﬂ
icted on per-
petrators in Sri Lanka under this compelling
notion of just deserts. However, until 2005 whip-
ping was a permissible mode of punishment and
was repealed by the Corporal Punishment
(Amendment) Act enacted in 2005.

The death penalty is a classic example for the
application of retributive theory of punishment. In
Sri Lanka, the death penalty has been imposed for
few crimes such as murder, treason and drug
offences under the criminal law of the country. Like
the other countries, imposing the death penalty as a
punishment has been a subject of controversy over
many years in Sri Lanka. Though there is a public
outcry to re-implement the death penalty in Sri
Lanka, it is an abolitionist in practice that has not
executed any offender during the past 34 years and
established a practice of not carrying out execu-
tions. The State has also paid attention to the imple-
mentation of the death penalty by appointing law
reform commissions such as “Morris Commission”
(the four-member commission appointed by the
Governor General, after the assassination case of
Prime Minister S.W.R.D. Bandaranayake, to report
the practical utility of the death penalty) to examine
the practical utility of capital punishment, especially
as a better mode of punishment in reducing the
crime rate. The conclusion of the report has revealed
no observable relationship between the homicide
death rate and the practice of executing offenders
for murder. Since Buddhism is declared as the
of
ﬁ
cial religion in the country, offenders cannot be
executed without violating the First Precept which
prohibits killing of any live object.

As far as the history of prisons in Sri Lanka is
concerned, the new prison system that evolved in
Britain was introduced to the British colonies
during 1844. The Department of Prisons came
into existence
ﬁ
rst af
ﬁ
liated to the Police
Department under the Act No. 18 of 1844. During
that period the supervisions and control of all
prisons in the Island were vested in Inspector
General of Prisons. The of
ﬁ
ce of Inspector
General of Prisons was held by the Inspector
General of Police until 1905. The prison and
police departments were separated under two
departments thereafter. At present the Department
of Prisons is functioning under the Ministry of
Prison and Rehabilitation of Sri Lanka. The
Department of Prisons constitutes the Prison
Headquarters, Centre for Research and Training
in
Corrections,
Closed
Prisons,
2
Remand
Prisons,
3 Work Camps,
4 Open Prison Camps,
5

2  There are three closed prisons in Sri Lanka, namely,
Welikada, Bogambara and Mahara. Welikada Closed
Prison is for the
ﬁ
rst offenders, who had been adm-
itted to prison for the
ﬁ
rst time. Bogambara Closed
Prison is for the reconvicted prisoners, those who
had been admitted to the prison for the second
time. Mahara Closed Prison is for the recidivists,
who had been convicted and admitted to prison more
than twice.


3  There are Twenty Remand Prisons in Sri Lanka. Those
prisons are situated in Cololmbo, Kandy, Tangalle, Jaffna,
Anuradhapura, Batticaloa, Badulla, Galle, Matara,
Negombo, New Magazine, Kegalle, Tricomalee, Kalutara,
Boossa, Kurunegala, Polonnarwwa, Retnapura and
Vavunia.


4  Work camps are prisons without a perimeter wall where
prisoners are sentenced with short term (less than 2 years)
or medium term (2 years to 5 years) of imprisonment and
the offenders are detained under minimum security condi-
tions. The eight work camps are in Watareka, Meethirigala,
Navodawa,
Weeravila,
Anuradhapura
Kuruwita,
Wariyapola and Kandewatta.

5  There are two Open Prison Camps in Sri Lanka at
Pallekelle and in Anuradhapura.

9 The prison system of Sri Lanka con-
sists of 4,325 prison of
ﬁ
cials of Uniformed Staff
and 180 of Non-uniformed Staff. In the year 2010
the percentage of the un-convicted prisoners was
66% (approximately) and the convicted prison-
ers’ percentage was 33% (Prison Statistics 2010).
Ratio of convicted to un-convicted prisoners in
the year 2010 was 1:3. In such a situation the
present prison system in Sri Lanka is far behind
in achieving its main goal concerning the reha-
bilitation of prisoners.

The Department of Prisons has to play an
important role in carring out custodial sentences
(imprisonment) and non-custodial sentences and
orders (home detention, supervision, community
work and release on conditions) imposed by Sri
Lankan Courts. The prison statistics reveal that
the number of direct admissions of both convicted
and remand prisoners has considerably increased
during the last decade.
10
In the year 2010, the
number of direct admissions of both convicted
and remand prisons was 1,32,619 and the number
who were discharged from prison was 31,442.
11
This shows that 1,01,177 prisoners were kept in
our prisons in 2010. From the year 2000 the
reconvicted and recidivism rate has gradually
increased
12 and in the year 2007 the number of the
direct admission of reconvicted prisoners and
recidivists was higher than the
ﬁ
rst offenders
(prison statistics 2010).
13 Thus the above-said

ﬁ
gures reveal that the crime wave continues to be
high in Sri Lanka and the statistics further disclose
the failure of retributive justice in the country.

An effective policing system is necessarily
important in controlling the crime statistic (crime
rate). As mentioned earlier, the Portuguese who
controlled certain areas of the Maritime Provinces
of the country did not effect any serious changes to
the existing criminal justice system of the country.
The concept of policing in Sri Lanka started with
the Dutch who saddled the Military with the respon-
sibility of policing the city of Colombo. It was the
Dutch who established the earliest police stations
which were initially established at the northern
entrance to the Fort, the cause-way connecting Fort
and Pettah and Kayman’s Gate in Pettah. In addi-
tion to these the “Maduwa” or the of
ﬁ
ce of Disawa
of Colombo, who was a Dutch of
ﬁ
cial, also served
as a Police Station for these suburbs.

In 1805 under the British rule, the police func-
tions were de
ﬁ
ned clearly. Apart from matters
connected with the safety, comfort and conve-
nience of the people, police functions also came
to be connected with prevention and detection of

6  Two Training Schools attached to our prison system for
the youthful offenders and situated in Pallansena and
Ambepussa.

7  There are two Correctional Centres for Youthful
Offenders in Pallansena and Taldena. Offenders between
the ages of 16 and 22 are sent to these correctional/reha-
bilitation centres. Taldena correctional centre is an open
camp and Pallansena Correctional centre has both a closed
prison and an open camp.

8  Sri Lanka has only one Work Release Centre.

9  There are 28 Lock-ups in Sri Lanka in Ampara,
Avissawella, Balangoda, Balapitiya, Chilaw, Elpitiya,
Embilipitiya, Gampaha, Gampola, Hambantota, Hatton,
Kalmunai,
Kalutara,

Kuliyapitiya,
Kurunegala, Maho, Mannar, Matale, Mullaitivu, Nuwara
Elliya, Panadura, Point Pedro, Puttalam and Vavuniya.

10  The number of the direct admissions of both convicted
and un-convicted prisons from year 2000 to 20007 is as
follows: 2000—89,325, 2001—95,725, 2002—107,210,

crime and maintenance of law and order. The

1865. 1866 could be considered as the beginning
of the country’s present Police Service in Sri
Lanka
(

www.police.lk/index.php/crime-divi-
sion

). Since then the police force is primarily
responsible for assuring the security of the people
and their properties in the country. They are to act
as the effective law-enforcing agency to maintain
law and order in the country. After the emergence
of Sri Lanka as an independent and sovereign
State, it has become more essential for the police
to achieve the above-said goal in marinating law
and order in the country. With the change of the
social structure and other social phenomenon
great responsibility has been entrusted with
police to curb the crime. However, in the present
scenario in Sri Lanka, the police are required to
engage in many nonpolice works which are not
within the parameters of the main objectives of
police, i.e. prevention and detection of crimes.

The above discussion shows us that retribution
is not a proper answer to the crime problem in the
country. It further reveals that retributive theory
fails to control the crime rate, keep society safe,
rehabilitate prisoners and reintegrate them to the
society as law-abiding citizens.

18.4

Restorative Justice and New
Means of Treating the Offender

Restorative justice (reparative justice) is an
approach to justice whereby all the parities with
a stake in a particular offence come together to
resolve the problem collectively and how to
deal with the consequences of the offence and
its implications for the future (Wright
1991
;
Marshall
2000
, p. 2). This approach of justice
focuses on the needs of both parties of the case,
i.e. needs of victim and offender as well as the
needs of the community instead of satisfying
the hard legal principles and punishing the
offender. Unlike retributive justice, restorative
justice observes crime as a violation of human
rela
tionship (Zehr
1990
, p. 35) and crime is an
offence against the individual and community
rather than the State (Rotman
1990
; Marty
2001
,
p. 1). Under this theory, justice means an
exploration of solutions which encourage and
support restoration, mediation/reconciliation
agreeing by victim, offender and the community
where victims of crime take an active role in pro-
cess (Braithwaite
2002
, 249). Restorative justice
requires an offender to take responsibility for
his/her offence to take steps for restitution of
the victim (Daniel and Strong 2001, p. 106), pro-
moting the maximum involvement of the two
parties in the process at the highest level of
victim satisfaction and offender accountability
(Sharman and Strang
2007
, p. 36). Since restor-
ative justice maintains that increased crime is an
overall failure of society, it provides an opportu-
nity for the offender to meet his/her personal
needs, rehabilitate offenders, help rebuild their
life and reintegrate them into better persons.
Restorative justice principle mainly aims at four
key values. They are giving opportunity for the
encounter of parties (where the victim, offender
and the others in the community involved in the
crime meet), compelling the offender to take
necessary steps to repair the harm caused from
the crime, helping the restoration of both parties
(this includes third person who involved in the
crime initially) and opening the opportunity for
both parties to participate in
ﬁ
nding a resolution/
decision. Restorative justice could be found in
victim offender mediation, restorative or family
conferencing, healing/sentencing/peacemaking
circles, victim/ex-offender assistance, restitu-
tion, police cautions and non-custodial measures
such as probation, conditional discharge, sus-
pended
sentencing
and
community-based
corrections.

Among those methods, the justice system of
Sri Lanka adopts only a few, i.e. victim offender
mediation, restitution (compensation to the
victim), probation, conditional discharge,
suspended sentencing and community-based

corr
ection. Although the programmes relating to
ex-offender assistance (aftercare service) are not
institutionalized or implemented in a proper
manner, some religious and social
service groups
help the ex-prisoners to overcome the economi-
cal and social problems which they come across
after being released from prison.

18.4.1
Victim Offender Mediation

In Sri Lanka the police are involved in the ami-
cable settlement of minor (criminal and civil) dis-
putes. There efforts towards settlement of minor
disputes have begun to arise from statutory duty
stipulated on them to prevent crime and maintain
law and order in the country. In the 1950s the pro-
cess of settling minor criminal disputes was
of
ﬁ
cially entrusted by way of administrative
direction 1998; the Mediation Boards Act No. 72
of 1998 was passed by Parliament, having the
objective of providing the people in the country
an opportunity to follow a less cost-effective
mechanism to settle their minor disputes with the
agreement of both parties. Therefore, the Act

provides for the legal framework for institution-
alizing Mediation Boards, which are empowered
to resolve by the process of mediation all disputes
referred to it by disputing parties, as well as by
Courts in certain instances. At present the
Mediation Board has the criminal jurisdiction
over affray, causing hurt, grievous hurt, wrongful
restraint, wrongful con
ﬁ
nement, force, criminal
force, assault criminal misappropriation, criminal
trespass, house trespass, insult and criminal intim-
idation. A large number of the disputes handled
by the Boards relate to these criminal offences. In
the Mediation process the mediator encourages
the parties towards negotiation by coordinating
the large number of people involved in the matter,
improving communication, helping them to gen-
erate options, assessing alternatives to agreement
and bringing such agreements to closure.


18.4.2
Compensation to the Victim

Section 17 of the CPC Act No. 15 of 1979 pro-
vides necessary legal provisions for the court in
order to compensate the victims of a crime or their
dependants. Through compensation order Courts
may direct the offender to repair the loss or dam-
ages caused to the victim. Usually, compensation
is recovered from the
ﬁ
ne (as an ancillary order),
which is imposed for an offence
14 as decided by
the Court in the decision of
Rabo v James (32 NAL
91)
. But the Penal Code (Amendment) Ordinance,
No. 22 of 1995,
15 enables Courts to impose a com-
pensation order as a mandatory punishment
16
with
imprisonment for sexual offences
17 and offences
dealing with cruelty to children.
18 However, except
the offences stated above, under that particular
amendment, the Sri Lankan legislature does not
provide for legal provisions, which empowers the
Court to order compensation as an integral part of
punishment. Thus far, the Sri Lankan Courts have
not tendered a compensation order on the State or
otherwise Sri Lanka does not have any other alter-
native mechanism such as “State Compensation
Board” where the offender is unable to pay the
compensation. This situation shows us that the
offender is disregarded under the present law relat-
ing to compensation to the victim.


18.4.3
Community-Based Corrections

Community-based correction is a permissible
mode of punishment in Sri Lanka. As an alterna-
tive to prison sentence, the Magistrate Court may
order community task on an offender, for a num-
ber of hours stipulated by the Court within a cer-
tain period of time. If the offender fails to carry
out the work assigned on him/her, he/she will be
dealt with by the Court by imposing any other
appropriate punishment. The present law relating
to Community Service Orders was
ﬁ
rst intro-
duced in Sri Lanka by the Administration of
Justice Law No. 44 of 1973. Section 18(1) of the

14  Section 17(6) of the CPC Act, No. 15 of 1979.

15  Section 364 of the Penal Code (Amendment) Ordinance,
No. 22 of 1995, says that whoever commits rape shall,
except in the cases provided for in subsection (2) (3), be
punished with rigorous imprisonment for a term not
exceeding twenty years and, with a
ﬁ
ne, shall in addition
be ordered to pay compensation of an amount determined
by the court to the person in respect of whom the offence
was committed for the injuries caused to such person. For
more see section 364(2) (g) of Penal Code (Amendment)
Ordinance, section 365, as amended by the Penal Code
(Amendment) Ordinance, No. 22 of 1995.

18 Thinking for New Horizonin Criminal Justice...
CPC Act 15 of 1979 as amended by the CPC
(Amendment) Act No. 49 of 1985 has stipulated
the relevant provisions relating to Community
Service today. These provisions were repealed
and enacted in the Community Based Corrections
Orders Act No. 46 of 1999 which presently lays
down legal provision for unpaid community ser-
vice orders in Sri Lanka. According to the law
prescribed by the said Act, unpaid community
service order may be issued
in lieu of
ﬁ
ne which
is less than three thousand rupees or
in lieu of
imprisonment which is less than 2 years,
19 taking
into consideration various factors including the
nature of offence and the character of the
offender.
20 Community-based correction orders
are a step away from a prison sentence, and are a
more successful form of punishment for minor
offences from the corrective aspect, and a cheaper
alternative to short-term imprisonment.

There are three ways (types) of serving under
the unpaid community-based corrections, namely,
community work corrections; special rehabilita-
tion (programme) for drug offenders and work
under trained supervisors. Since these programmes
are not residential, offenders may participate in the
activities while staying in the community.

Factors or criterion such as age, social history
and background, medical and psychiatric history,
educational background, employment history,
previous convictions,
ﬁ
nancial circumstances,
special needs, family background and other
income of the offender, courses, programmes,
treatment or other assistance that could be made
available to the offender and bene
ﬁ
t that he may
gain from the assigned work are considered under
this programme. Lack of counselling and exclud-
ing women and children from the process could
be marked as demerits of the Sri Lankan system.

18.4.4
Probation

Correctional programme and treatment of offend-
ers in Sri Lanka started functioning in the form of
Probation in 1956 through the promulgation of
Probation of Offenders Ordinance No. 42 of 1956
for both adults and the children. In 1960 the pro-
bation system has been extended by appointing
Probation Of
ﬁ
cers to all judicial districts in the
country. However, today probation is ordered
only against the juvenile delinquents.

18.4.5
Conditional Discharge

Conditional discharge is one of the non-custo-
dial measures implemented on the offenders in
Sri Lanka. Section 306 (1) of the CPC Act, No.
15 of 1979, lays down the legal provisions for
conditional discharge. The Court may order
conditional discharge after taking into account
various factors, including the good character of
the offender (
Peter (1945) 47 NLR 23;
Fernando
v
Excise Inspector, Wennappuwa (1949) 4 CLW
41), the age of the offender (
Jayasena (1950)
52 NLR 183) and the nature of the offence
(whether the offence is a trivial offence)

(Gunasekara v Solomon (1923) 25 NLR 474
;
Appuhamy v Wijesinghe (1945) 46 NLR 189;

Krishnan v
Sittampalam (1952) 54 NLR 19;

Gomas v
Leelaratne (1964) 66 NLR 233;

Podiappuhamy
v
Food and Price Control
Inspector, Kandy 1968 71 NLR 93). However,
the Sri Lankan judiciary imposes a conditional
discharge on adult offenders only for trivial
offences (
Gunasekara v
Soloman (1923) 25
NLR 474;
Appuhamy v Wijesinghe (1945) 46
NLR 189
21
; R. v Peter (1945) 47 NLR 23).


18.4.6
Suspended Sentencing

As a result of the important proposals of the Law
Commission in 1970, suspended sentence of

19  Section 5 (1) of Community Based Corrections Act No.
46 of 1999.

20  Section 5 (2) of Community Based Corrections Act No.
46 of 1999. The facts that the court should consider are the
nature and the gravity of the offence, age of the offender,
other relevant circumstances relating to the offence and
the offender, pre-sentence report and facilities available
for implementing such order.

21  The court did not justify a conditional discharge where
the offence was accompanied by the use of violence.


294
M.A.D.S.J.S. Niriella
imprisonment was introduced into our penal law
in 1973, and section 239 of the Administration of
Justice Law laid down the provisions relating to
suspended sentencing for the
ﬁ
rst time. Section
303(1) of the CPC Act, No. 15 of 1979, which
provided for suspended sentences has been
amended twice in 1995 and 1998. Section 303 of
the CPC Act, No. 15 of 1979, as amended by the
CPC (Amendment) Act, No. 47 of 1999, lays
down the existing provision for suspended sen-
tences of imprisonment in Sri Lanka. Before the
amendment of the CPC Act, No. 20 of 1995,
came into operation, suspended sentencing of
imprisonment had been restricted to cases where
the sentence of imprisonment was more than 2
years
22 or where persons were convicted for grave
crimes. Under section 2 of the CPC Act, No. 20
of 1995, although it was applicable to cases where
imprisonment is for less than 2 years, if the stat-
ute provided that a particular sentence of impris-
onment is mandatory, the offender was not
entitled to a suspended sentence. This provision
was amended by section 2 of the CPC
(Amendment) Act, No. 19 of 1999.
23 At present,
a suspended sentence is imposed under this Act
for cases where the sentence of imprisonment is
for not more than 2 years,
24 where the law does
not provide a mandatory minimum imprison-
ment,
25 where the offender committed the offence
while he or she was not on a probation order, con-
ditional release or discharge;
26 the offender is
serving a term of imprisonment or the offender is
yet to serve the term of imprisonment which has
not been suspended.
27

According to the statutory provisions, Courts
may suspend the sentence of imprisonment
wholly or partly. Frequently, Sri Lankan Courts
(both Magistrate’s Courts and High Courts) pre-
fer to suspend the whole term of imprisonment,
especially where there is a plea of guilty. But
there is considerable doubt whether the Sri
Lankan courts in practice utilize the partly sus-
pended sentence as a form of punishment where
the accused has pleaded guilty. Even in severe
crimes such as culpable homicide not amounting
to murder, rape, etc., the Sri Lankan Courts sus-
pend the sentence of imprisonment wholly. For
example, in the following High Court orders
28 the
Court suspended the whole term of imprisonment
after it had taken into account the plea of guilt. At
this point one may argue that in such cases the
court should not impose a suspended sentence by
considering the plea of guilt as the only sentenc-
ing factor. Moreover, according to sec. 303 (1)
(b) of the CPC (Amendment) Act, No. 47 of
1999, the Court should consider the nature and
gravity of the offence. In considering the cases of
murder, rape and robbery they are crimes severe
in nature, and for these crimes suspended sen-
tence may not be the appropriate type of punish-
ment. Therefore, especially when a person
convicted for a heinous crime such as rape, rob-
bery and culpable homicide not amounting to
murder the Court should carefully exercise its
discretion in the imposition of a suspended sen-
tence on plea-bargaining. This may be a reason
that the legislature introduced the mandatory
minimum sentencing rule in 1995.

27  Section 303 (2) (b) of the CPC (Amendment) Act, No.
47 of 1999.

28  In some murder cases where an accused pleaded guilty
to the offence culpable homicide not amounting to mur-
der, the term of imprisonment was suspended by High
Court: Kurunegala H.C.85/95; H.C 89/95; Negombo H.C.
675/87. In some rape cases where an accused pleaded
guilty, two years rigorous imprisonment was suspended
for
ﬁ
ve years by High Court: Kurunegala H.C. 99/95(rape);
Kandy H.C. Jury 1226/92 (rape).

22  Section 303 (1) of the CPC Act No. 15 of 1979 says that
“A Court which imposes a sentence of imprisonment on
an offender for a term not exceeding two years for an
offence may order that the sentence shall not take effect
unless, during a period speci
ﬁ
ed in order, being not less
than
ﬁ
ve years from the date of the order (hereinafter
referred to as the ‘operational period’) such offender com-
mits another offence punishable with imprisonment (here-
inafter referred to as ‘subsequent offence’)”.

23  According to section 2 of the CPC (Amendment) Act,
No. 19 of 1999 “a mandatory sentence of imprisonment
was changed to a mandatory minimum sentence of
imprisonment”.

24  Section 303 (2) (d) of the CPC (Amendment) Act, No.
47 of 1999.

25  Section 303(2) (a) of the CPC (Amendment) Act, No. 47
of 1999.

26  Section 303 (2) (c) of the CPC (Amendment) Act, No.
47 of 1999.

18.4.7
Aftercare Service

In considering the aftercare service in Sri Lanka,
it is hard to
ﬁ
nd any public agency which under-
takes this as an organized group. But with the
assistance of Sri Lanka Prison Department some
individuals including Buddhist Monks, Catholic
Priests and Nuns help the ex-prisoners who need
assistance according to their capacity. They pro-
vide counselling service, food and clothing, help
them to
ﬁ
nd job opportunities, etc. According to
prison representatives, lack of a proper aftercare
service system is one of the reasons for the
increase in the reconvicted/recidivist rate.
29
Therefore, Sri Lanka should introduce these
aftercare service programmes to assist ex-prison-
ers who really need society’s help, to restart their
lives after they return to society. Therefore, Sri
Lanka should pay attention to enacting necessary
statutory provisions to institutionalize this ser-
vice. However, what is most needed is the provi-
sion of increased opportunities for public
participation in practical correctional work
through community volunteering efforts. Industry,
labour organizations and other civil organizations
such as religious centres may formally organize
and actively play a signi
ﬁ
cant role in such social
defence programmes.

18.5

Conclusion

The criminal justice system and criminal law in
Sri Lanka have been transformed from retributive
justice to restorative justice due to the decisions
taken by the Parliament and the Court. However,
the attitude of the public towards punishment is
still in
ﬂ
uenced by traditional retributive thoughts
where the offender should be treated harshly with
severe punishments through punitive approach.
The recidivism rate of country re
ﬂ
ects upon this
public thought and it further tells us the failure of
the treatment (reform) of the offender and retrib-
utive concept. Since the phenomenon of treat-
ment of the offender is a complex exercise, it is a
strenuous procedure particularly in a developing
country like Sri Lanka with limited resources and
lacking the update and new technologies. Though
Sri Lanka has introduced some restorative justice
practices to the criminal justice system, those
practices are not suf
ﬁ
cient to meet the treatment
of the offenders and crime problem. Therefore,
the criminal justice system of Sri Lanka pays her
attention to introducing new methods of restor-
ative justice such as circles and conferencing.
Further, existing mechanism such as probation,
community-based correction and mediation
should be strengthened for treatment of the
offender in a productive manner.

Introduction

This paper intends to explore the content and
characteristics of the criminal justice system in
Taiwan. We understand that there are four phases
in the criminal justice system. It is
ﬁ
rstly the role
of the police. The police play a major role as
gatekeepers to the criminal justice system, which
is to refer an arrested suspect to the of
ﬁ
ce of the
prosecutors. The second stage is investigation
and prosecution. This is a pretrial stage where the
prosecutors would investigate the crime incident
and decide if it involves any violation of the law.
The prosecutors often cooperate with the judges
if further detention is needed. The third stage is
the sentencing stage where the judge would make
a decision on a defendant. And the
ﬁ
nal stage is
imprisonment and treatment. The criminal justice
system exercises a formal social control mecha-
nism on those who violate the laws.

The criminal justice system involves different
components and mechanisms so that the system
can function and operate well. Moreover, the sys-
tem varies in different social and cultural settings.
In Taiwan, the criminal justice system is consti-
tuted by the following agencies: the National
Police Agency (NPA) of the Ministry of Interior,
the Investigation Bureau of the Ministry of
Justice, and the Coast Guard Administration. In
addition, the system includes the Prosecutor’s
of
ﬁ
ce, the Courts, and the Correctional
Institutions. On July 20, 2011, the Taiwanese
Government created a new of
ﬁ
ce, under the
Taiwanese criminal system called the Agency
Against Corruption, and its function is to
ﬁ
ght
against the white-collar crime committed by the
high-ranking government of
ﬁ
cials.

This paper focuses its discussion only on the
traditional components of the justice system: the
police, prosecutors, and judges. Other agencies
will not be covered here. The roles and functions
of the three agencies will be addressed along with
their interactions. This paper also discusses the
due process rights in Taiwan, which are less
discussed in Asian societies.

the welfare of all the citizens. And there are about
75,000 police of
ﬁ
cers to ful
ﬁ
ll these functions.

In Taiwan, there is a police bureau in each city
and county. And, there are several police districts
in each police bureau. The Police booth, pai-chu-
suo (派出所), similar to Kuban in Japan, is the
smallest police unit in Taiwan and a couple of
booths are installed in each police district. Police
of
ﬁ
cers are required to take shifts and take care of
the daily operations within their own booths.

There are many other special police forces
other than the regular police bureaus in cities and
counties. These special police forces are designed
to oversee the social order and social security in
special locales and settings. For example, we
have Criminal Investigation Bureau to investigate
and examine certain violations and serious
crimes. We also have Aviation Police, Highway
Police, Harbor Police, and Railway Police, along
with some other special types of police forces to
meet the needs and security in various settings.

There are about 30,000 offenses identi
ﬁ
ed by
the police each month in Taiwan. In the year
2010, there are about 360,000 offenses recorded.
3
However, the statistics were much higher in past
years. For example, the number of offenses
known to police was around 430,000 in 2000 and
550,000 in 2005. There was a signi
ﬁ
cant reduc-
tion in crime statistics in past years, which is
similar to the United States and many other areas
of the world (Federal Bureau of Investigation

2010
)
. The of
ﬁ
cial crime statistics in Taiwan
derive from police administrative statistics. These
are the data processed by the police agencies,
either proactively or passively. The other crime
control agencies such as the Investigation Bureau,
the Prosecutor’s Of
ﬁ
ce, or the Coast Guard
Administration have their own crime statistics
and they report their recorded data annually.
Therefore, the crime statistics known to police do
not re
ﬂ
ect the whole picture of the crimes in
Taiwan. One still has to look into the crime statis-
tics data in other agencies, then, to obtain a clear
picture of crime in Taiwan.

However, the police agencies still handle the
majority of crime in Taiwan. The statistics from
other crime control agencies are much smaller in
scope than those from the police bureaus.
Therefore, police crime statistics are helpful for
us to understand the general crime scenario and
trends in Taiwan.

The following analyses are about crime char-
acteristics in Taiwan. Analysis is based on the
police crime statistics (National Police Agency

2011
)
. Firstly, in the year 2010 there were about
6,700 violent crimes, including murder and non-
negligent manslaughter, kidnapping, robbery,
forceful taking, serious injury, intimidation, and
forcible rape, which occupied about 1.8% of all
the offenses in Taiwan.
4
The violent crime num-
ber was 10,000 in 2000 and 14,000 in 2005; to
compare from 2010 data this shows a sizable
reduction for the past years. Secondly, property
crimes, such as auto and motorcycle theft, bur-
glary, petty theft, and grand theft, ranked at the
top of all offenses. For example, in 2007 they
were about 240,000 theft-related crimes, occupy-
ing 49% of all offenses known to police on that
particular year. Like violent crime, the numbers
of theft-related offenses was reduced substan-
tially during past years. In 2000, there were about
300,000 cases and about 142,000 cases known to
the police in 2010, showing a 50% reduction in
10 years. I suggest three factors which might con-
tribute to the reduction of theft offenses in Taiwan.
Firstly, it is the increasing levels of education in
the population in Taiwan. We understand that the
theft offenders are often from the less educated
population. And, it requires one to learn skills
and motives to become a member in the profes-
sion. A formal education would frustrate one to
learn such skills and motives. Secondly, the rapid
aging population in Taiwan also makes it dif
ﬁ
cult
for the thieves to recruit new members. Finally,
the prevalence of CCTV and security devices all
over the island of Taiwan also contributes to the

2  The number of police of
ﬁ
cers per 100,000 residents are
326 in Taiwan, which is larger than 223 in Japan, 250 in
the United States, and 275 in the United Kingdom.

3  Here, the crime rate is about 1,565 per 100,000
population.

4  Here, the violent crime rate was about 29.13, much
smaller than 403.6 in the United States in 2010.

reduction of the incidence of theft. Many crimi-
nals were apprehended through the photos taken
on the CCTV cameras and in turn it produced an
effective deterrent for motivated offenders.

Thirdly, fraud is an emerging problem in
Taiwan. For the past 10 years, there were about
40,000 cases of fraud every year. The property
losses are estimated to be NT$100 billion a year.
However, the good news is that the number of
victims
decreased
to
30,000
in
2010.
Unfortunately, property losses were still enor-
mous. Telephones were used to play con
ﬁ
dence
games and players now move to the cyber world
to
ﬁ
nd victims. The fraud games involve sales or
purchases of goods, having romantic relation-
ships, a good return of investment, promises of a
huge heritage to be given, or winning a lottery.
However, it always ends with a
ﬁ
ction, not a
reality.

Police do have many responsibilities in Taiwan.
They take calls for assistance, such as lost and
found services and victim services of the crime.
They stay on the street to direct traf
ﬁ
c, especially
during rush hours, and they provide services of
protection for women and children. Moreover,
police are required to implement community
police measures, advocating the concepts of good-
will and charity, and having a good relationship
with the community. And, naturally, they have to
take responsibilities concerning the combat of
crimes, such as drug traf
ﬁ
cking, possessions of
illegal
ﬁ
rearms, frauds, and so on. At the top of
the above duties, police are also required to take a
close look at potential criminals, such as the listed
gang members and ex-convicts to ensure good
social order in the community. Previously, they
were required to make a home visit to every house
in the community. The police home visits were
required by law, as one of the police duties. The
police of
ﬁ
cers showed up at the house to check
the members of a designated residence. However,
in 2007, the Taiwan Legislative Yuan passed a law
to cancel this police practice due to strong opposi-
tion from the public. Legislators also criticized
the fact that practices of home visits had created
additional workloads for the police (Wu
2007
)
.

In 2011, a survey on Taiwanese perceptions of
police was conducted (Jou et al.
2011
)
. The sur-
vey found 70% of the respondents showing their
favorable ratings of national police, including
police politeness, fairness, and integrity. However,
only 46% of the respondents thought favorably
about police crime
ﬁ
ghting performance. This
indicates that a high proportion of the people
expect police to do a better job. The survey was
also able to locate some of the factors shaping
public perceptions of police, including gender,
age, and individual level of fear of crime. The
study suggests that efforts are needed to narrow
the social distance between the police of
ﬁ
cers
and the general public.

Science and technology are dominating the
world now, and because of this many potential
criminals turn their attentions to computers and
the Internet to commit crimes. According to the
Taiwanese police annual report in 2007, there
were about 30,000 computer-related offenses
(National Police Agency
2008
) and 38% of them
were Internet-related fraud and 30% of them
were sexual trade-related offenses. There were
other computer crimes, such as cyber bullying,
cyber stalking, spreading viruses, and cyber
intimidations in Taiwan. Specialized enforcement
agencies are being created to
ﬁ
ght against cyber
crimes. These agencies are on duty to apprehend
any possible violations in the cyber world.

After 38 years of lack of communication dur-
ing the military con
ﬂ
ict and cold war, Taiwan and
the People’s Republic of China started a dialogue
in November 1987. At the beginning, people
were allowed to visit their relatives. As a conse-
quence, it brought about tremendous increases in
trade, cultural, social, and personal exchanges
across the Taiwan Strait. However, justice agen-
cies were not allowed to make contacts and it
resulted in a vacuum of law enforcement. Many
Taiwanese fugitives
ﬂ
ed to China to escape the
legal sanctions. Later, in the year 1990, an agree-
ment, the Kim-men Agreement (金門協議), was
signed by representatives of the Red Cross
Foundations of Taiwan and Mainland China, to
combat illegal immigrants and criminals and a
procedure of the exchanges for those deported
was established. The trades were conducted on
the sea by people from the two sides of the Red
Cross Foundations. According to the statistics, a


300
C. Hou
total of 49,817 people were exchanged between
1987 and 2006.

In 2007, President Ma Ying-jeou (馬英九)
assumed political power in Taiwan, and started to
boost the cross strait relations in a pragmatic way.
Mr. Chiang Pin-kung (江丙坤), the chairman of
the Straits Exchange Foundation, and Mr. Chen
Yun-lin (陳雲林), the chairman of the Association
for Relations Across the Taiwan Straits, were
able to meet seven times and signed sixteen
agreements. Among them, the “Agreement on
Joint Cross-Strait Crime-Fighting and Mutual
Judicial Assistance” was signed in April of 2009
in Nan-jing (南京), China, and in <6 months, the

ﬁ
rst criminal, a con man, was deported from
China to Taiwan through direct
ﬂ
ight. This began
a new and historical era that enabled police
of
ﬁ
cers in Mainland China (called public secu-
rity of
ﬁ
cials (公安)) and the Taiwanese police to
work together to
ﬁ
ght against crime. After the
agreement, they have cooperated on nine occa-
sions in 2009 and ten occasions in 2010. The
majority were fraud-related offenses, emerging
rapidly these days.

In the following, the author examines the due
process rights concerning the handling of sus-
pects by the police.

Many people understand that American police
of
ﬁ
cials would read the Miranda warning when
they make the arrests: “You have the right to
remain silent; anything you say can be used
against you in a court of law; you have the right
to the presence of an attorney; if you cannot
afford an attorney, one will be appointed for you
prior to any questioning if you so desire.” The
Taiwanese police of
ﬁ
cers do not have to read
these warnings to the suspects to ensure their
legal rights. However, the suspects do enjoy some
of the due process rights, including legal assis-
tance, self-incrimination, and exclusionary rule.
However, the nature of due process rights is not
exactly the same as that of the United States.

In Taiwan, a criminal suspect is not required
to answer police inquiry questions if the suspect
is not accompanied by a lawyer. They can also
refuse to answer any question after sunset and
before sunrise. They can also check the wordings
of inquiry and make sure that the contents are
correct. Recording is permitted during the police
interrogation. Moreover, if unlawful or excessive
uses of force are used by the police of
ﬁ
cials, the
suspects can report this to the prosecutors for
investigation. The evidence of crime through the
excessive use of force would be treated as illegal
and cannot be used against the suspects.

Finally, the author would like to address an
issue relating to police law enforcement on hoo-
ligans/gangsters. In 2008, the law was discussed
by the grand judges, similar to the constitution
court in many countries, and was declared to be
unconstitutional, effectively making the police
power of combating gang members illegal.
Previously, Taiwanese police of
ﬁ
cers were
allowed to arrest gang members and refer them to
the court for up to a 1-year sentence. However,
the grand judges issued an opinion saying that the
law concerning the de
ﬁ
nition of gang members is
unconstitutional due to the ambiguity in acts
de
ﬁ
ning gang members. According to this law,
gang member behavior could involve occupying
turf, dining without pay, loa
ﬁ
ng on the streets,
and committing indecent behaviors.

The grand judges also issued another opin-
ion saying that police arrest without the appear-
ance of the arrestees is illegal. Often the police
invited scholars, prosecutors, and senior police
of
ﬁ
cers to decide if a violation of hooligans’
law has occurred. The suspects then were not
invited to the meeting, which the grand judges
make it against the spirit of the criminal justice
procedure. The grand judges argued that any
person, if detained, should go through a public
hearing to ensure a proper law enforcement
procedure.

Now, the hooligans are handled according to
the common criminal code as well as other spe-
cial statutes passed by the congress, the
Legislation Yuan in Taiwan. Police are required
to follow the general procedure of criminal
arrest. Although the police of
ﬁ
cers do not have
the legal ground to arrest gang members easily,
they still work hard to
ﬁ
ght against crime.
Arrests are often made in the name of crimes
against the code of organized crime, and a viola-
tion of the criminal code, such as intimidation,
battery, or fraud.

19.3

Prosecutors: Criminal
Investigations

Prosecutors in Taiwan are public administrators,
integrated with the broader execution branches,
the Execution Yuan. Because of this administra-
tive nature, prosecutors are subjected to the
supervision and management of their supervi-
sors. The Taiwanese prosecutors’ of
ﬁ
ce has three
levels, the district public prosecutors of
ﬁ
ce, the
Taiwan High Prosecutors Of
ﬁ
ce, and the Supreme
Prosecutors Of
ﬁ
ce. There is a head for each of
the district public prosecutors of
ﬁ
ce and there is
one head in both the Taiwan High Prosecutors
Of
ﬁ
ce, and the Supreme Prosecutors Of
ﬁ
ce. The
heads take responsibilities for daily operations
for their individual of
ﬁ
ces. However, the head of
the low-level prosecutor’s of
ﬁ
ce has to respond to
the calls from the head of the high-level prosecu-
tor’s of
ﬁ
ce. With this, the head of the Supreme
Prosecutors Of
ﬁ
ce, the Prosecutor General,
enjoys the largest power of prosecutions. Among
all his powers, he has the direct power of criminal
investigations on crimes committed by the presi-
dent, vice president, and other high-ranking
of
ﬁ
cials in Taiwan. There is another power that
no one else in the country has, which is the right
of special appeal on criminal cases when crimi-
nal cases are already
ﬁ
nalized in the courts. This
power is often used by the Prosecutor General for
death penalty cases. He could request a retrial to
ensure that the death penalty made by the previ-
ous courts is justi
ﬁ
able.

There are about 1,200 district prosecutors,
170 high prosecutors, and 20 supreme prosecu-
tors in Taiwan. Like prosecutors in many other
countries, the prosecutors in Taiwan bring the
accused criminals to the court in the name of a
country so that the justice can be achieved.
Prosecutors play the key roles for criminal inves-
tigations. They investigate criminal cases that
are referred from the police of
ﬁ
ce. And they can
also proactively investigate criminal cases.
Furthermore, they have the authority to lead the
police of
ﬁ
cers and the agents of the criminal
investigation bureau in the conduct of criminal
investigations.

Legal cases are divided into three categories in
Taiwan, which include civil, criminal, and admin-
istrative cases. The prosecutors can handle crimi-
nal cases only. They do not have the right to
involve in civil or administrative cases.
Theoretically, prosecutors take charge of crimi-
nal investigations. However, often they do not
apprehend criminal cases proactively. The police
and the investigation bureau along with other
crime control agencies refer the arrested suspects
to the prosecutor’s of
ﬁ
ce. Only serious crimes,
white-collar crimes, or crimes committed by
high-ranking
governmental
of
ﬁ
cials
would
receive prosecutors’ interest and action to
investigate.

However, regardless of whether the criminal
cases are actively or passively in the hands of the
prosecutors, they would examine and weigh the
evidence of the criminal offenses. If the offenses
constitute a violation of the criminal codes, the
prosecutor would formally place a charge against
the suspect. In this case the prosecutor would
become the plaintiff, representing the state, and
ask judges to indict the suspect.

According to the laws, the intake of criminal
cases to the courts could be the prosecutors or it
could be the general public. If prosecutors
ﬁ
nd a
violation of the criminal code from the defendant,
he or she would bring the case to the court, which
we call a public accusation. However, the laws
allow the general public who are the criminal vic-
tims to bring the offenders to the prosecutors. We
call this a self-prosecution. If it is a self-prosecu-
tion, the prosecutor is not required to appear in
the court to act as a plaintiff.

The Prosecutor General has the legal right to
exercise a special appeal and bring the case to the
highest court for a retrial. In 2010, there were 351
special cases appealed by the Prosecutor General
and 278 of them changed the verdicts, signifying
that the Prosecutor General is very careful and
also very functional about the use of his or her
appeal right. However, it also justi
ﬁ
es that justice
is not handled fairly in many of the cases in the
courts. Incorrect verdicts could be found in the
court system.

Prosecutors are very busy in Taiwan, especially
those at the
ﬁ
rst level, the district prosecutors.


302
C. Hou
The following statistics would give you the gen-
eral picture. In 2010, the number of new cases to
be handled by the 1,200 district prosecutors was
412,553. This translates that there are about 1 or
2 cases a day added to the list of daily criminal
investigation numbers. Usually it takes an aver-
age of 50 working days to deal with a case.
Prosecutors take new cases every day and they
have to exam every case brought to their of
ﬁ
ces.
At the top of the above-mentioned workload,
Taiwanese prosecutors are required to check into
suicide cases, and there are about 4,000 suicides
a year. Expectedly prosecutors are facing a tre-
mendous workload. “Prosecutors are too busy”
is a complaint often heard from the lawyers, and
it has become a subculture in the prosecutor’s
of
ﬁ
ce.

We have just mentioned that prosecutors han-
dle the majority of their cases referred by the
other agencies. In 2010, the police referred
292,742 cases which account for about 71% of
the cases that the prosecutors handled. There
were also 1,683 cases referred by the Investigation
Bureau, and meanwhile 13,470 cases were
brought in through litigations from the general
public. Obviously, the majority of cases handled
by the prosecutors are from the police. According
to the statistics, 95% of the cases from the police
ended with a verdict in the courts, meaning that
the quality of crime investigation by the prosecu-
tors is good. In Taiwan, 3% of the prosecutors’
cases at the local level are self-litigations, brought
in by the general public. However, the number of
statistics has been increasing for the past years
due to the increasing awareness of the legal rights
in Taiwan. Now, in Taiwan prosecutors would not
handle personal litigations without the assistance
of a lawyer.

In the following the author addresses the due
process rights relating to the discretionary power
of a prosecutor.

Speedy trial is a constitutional right for all
Americans. There is a due process rule, the 48-h
rule, in the United States that the accused should
be brought to the judges within 48 h. In 1991, in
the case of California vs. McLaughlin, the United
State Federal Supreme Court argued that the
criminal justice system needs
ﬂ
exibility to ensure
its functions, and the 48 h would meet the needs
for this
ﬂ
exibility. In Taiwan, a criminal suspect
if arrested is required to be sent to the court within
24 h, only half of the detained hours used in the
United States. This also means that the Taiwanese
police of
ﬁ
cers and the prosecutors have to share
the 24 h together. Most of the time, police of
ﬁ
cers
could have 16 h and the remaining 8 h belong to
the prosecutors. Although, the Taiwanese police
of
ﬁ
cers and prosecutors cannot detain an arrested
suspect as long as they want, they still need to ask
permission from the court for a continuous deten-
tion provided that the suspect has committed a
serious offense and a detention for further inves-
tigations is needed.

In the United States, for a serious offense, it
requires a grand jury to investigate and decide if
prosecution is needed. A grand jury is organized
by the prosecutors and members from the com-
munity. The purpose of the grand jury is to inves-
tigate if the criminal act constitutes a probable
cause for the criminal offense. The grand jury
will call the defendant for a public hearing so
that an adversary procedure is assured.
However, there is no grand jury arrangement in
Taiwan. The accused can show up before the
prosecutor and make statements. On the other
hand, no one except the lawyer can be allowed at
the hearing due to the con
ﬁ
dentiality of criminal
investigation.

19.4

Plea Bargaining

Plea bargaining is practiced in many countries. It
is an agreement in a criminal case where the
prosecutor allows a less serious charge provided
the defendant agrees to his or her wrongdoings.
In Taiwan, the prosecutors have the power of
exercising the plea bargain procedure in the jus-
tice system. The prosecutor meets with the defen-
dant and his or her lawyer to negotiate a possible
punishment for the wrongdoings before the
accused is brought to the court. In 2004, the legal
system in Taiwan formally adopted the practice
of plea bargaining for the purpose of reducing the
burdens on the courts while ensuring that justice
in the society is maintained. A prosecutor can


303
19 An Overview of the Criminal Justice System in Taiwan
call for a negotiation with the defendant and the
defendant’s lawyer after a formal charge is for-
warded to the court. They meet in order to reach
a possible conviction. Plea bargaining in Taiwan
can only be used when the defendant admits his
or her wrongdoing. It is also applicable when it
involves with minor offenses. Crimes punishable
by capital punishment, life sentence, or a
con
ﬁ
nement of more than 3 years are not permit-
ted for plea bargaining.

It has been several years since Taiwan started to
exercise the plea bargaining policy and there is now a
total of about 10,000 cases ending with plea bargain-
ing. Drug offenses are most likely to be called for a
plea bargain by a prosecutor. Fraud, falsi
ﬁ
cation of
documents, and petty theft are also offenses where a
prosecutor often calls for a plea bargaining.

There is another practice which is close to the
concept of plea bargaining commonly practiced in
the United States. In 1991, a Petty Crime Court
system was installed in Taiwan. For minor offenses,
provided that the accused admits his or her offense,
a prosecutor would refer it to the Petty Crime
Court. In this court, the defendant is not allowed to
appear and the judge exercises the judicial discre-
tion according to the documents and statements
from the prosecutor’s of
ﬁ
ce. However, the discre-
tionary power of the judge is limited to a
con
ﬁ
nement of less than six months. The due pro-
cess rights of public hearings and confrontation of
witnesses do not apply in the Petty Crime Court.

From the above, it is obvious that prosecutors
serve two major functions; criminal investigations
and prosecutions. We mentioned how the Taiwanese
prosecutors exercise their powers in the system so
that crime can be brought to justice. Subsequently,
we will discuss the role of the judges in Taiwan.
They enjoy the largest power in the criminal justice
system. However, the system can be very problem-
atic if they overly abuse their powers.


19.5

Judges: The Sentencing
Decisions

The purpose of the courts is the handling of civil
law suits. They also handle criminal cases as well
as juvenile delinquent cases. In Taiwan, petty
crime courts are installed to handle civil law suits
as well as criminal cases, minor in nature. Petty
crime court also takes case in violation of social
security codes.

The court is crucial in the criminal justice sys-
tem since this is where the justice is
ﬁ
nalized. If
a verdict is reached in the court, punishment will
follow. It could be a
ﬁ
ne of some amount of
money, a work service in the community, proba-
tion for a period of time, or a con
ﬁ
nement in jail.
If no verdict is reached, one simply leaves the
criminal justice system. One cannot pursue his or
her justice from within the prison system. That is,
one cannot exercise the right of appeal to reverse
his or her course in the system from the prison to
the court. In Taiwan, there is one exception. For
the death penalty case, the Prosecutor General
has the right of appeal to ask the court for another
trial. In this case, one might be able to change the
course after the court has already made the
ﬁ
nal
verdict for the defendant.

In Taiwan, there are three levels of court. The
local court, or the district court named in Taiwan,
is the lowest level which serves the function of
intake of cases in the court system. The high court
is the second level, above the local court, and the
highest court is the court of last resort of justice.
Theoretically, the three levels of the court act
independently. They exercise their own discre-
tionary authority. However, all the cases are pro-
cessed from the lower level of the court and then
move up to the next level. The use of the right of
appeal can only be utilized in the two lower levels
of the court. However, it is not guaranteed that all
the cases are legally allowed to enjoy the right of
appeal. The court limits the use of appeal, unless
there is a need of special appeal for the Prosecutor
General or there is an adequate reason for retrial.
However, in most of the criminal cases, the ver-
dicts can bring their cases to the higher level of
the court to look for the opportunity of changing
their fate in the system. These practices of appeals
at different levels of court are very common in
most of the countries in the world.

There are about 1,800 judges in Taiwan.
Among them, the local courts have a majority of
the judges, about 1,200. There are about 400
judges in the high courts and about 80 in the


304
C. Hou
highest court. The remaining are at the adminis-
tration court and the public functionary disciplin-
ary sanction commission and other administrative
branches of the court.

The administration court is very special in
Taiwan and operates to handle disputes between
citizens and administrative bodies. Everyone has
the right to bring his or her cases to the adminis-
tration court if he or she
ﬁ
nds the administration
agencies to be unfair. This may concern a
ﬁ
ne on
violations of the traf
ﬁ
c laws, or tax laws, or can
be any decisions based on the constitutional rights
of the citizens, such as meeting or having an
organization. However, one cannot pursue the
justice at the administration court without going
through the appeals at the previous administra-
tive agency. One has to ask for justice from the
previous government unit before one can bring
the case to the administration court. This special
administration court has only two levels, the high
court and the highest court, and there are about
75 judges to run this system.

In Taiwan, there is a special design for the
constitutional court. It consists of 15 grand
judges. The constitutional court has the power to
dissolve a political party which violates the con-
stitution. This court also has the power to impeach
the president and vice president. Other than the
above two powers, the grand judges also have the
power to interpret the constitution, or the law and
administration regulations. To date, however,
they have never exercised their power to impeach
a president or a vice president, and they have
never sought to dissolve a political party.

The grand judges are nominated by the presi-
dent and the con
ﬁ
rmations are made in the con-
gress, the Legislation Yuan in Taiwan. This part
of the operation is very similar to the justices in
the United States. However, the following points
are different. The Taiwanese grand judges have a
term limit, 8 years of service for a term only. By
law, they are not allowed to set a second term.
However, all the nine members of the Supreme
Court Justices in the United States are life term
appointed. Moreover, the Supreme Court is the
highest level, whereas the constitutional court of
Taiwan organized by the grand judges is not.
Therefore, one cannot take the advantage of the
constitutional right to appeal his or her case from
the highest court to the constitutional court. The
constitutional court in Taiwan could operate to
deal with the impeachment of the president and
vice president and it also operates to deal with the
legal status for a political party. These are their
major and only powers.

The grand judges in Taiwan have another
power, which is the power to interpret the law
including all governmental rules and regulations.
The grand judges meet together, express their
independent opinions, and come to a conclusion
by vote. The latest meeting issued by the grand
judges was on November 4th, 2011. There have
been 692 cases issued by the grand judges since
1949. A recent case involved a Taiwanese busi-
nessman, working in Mainland China, applying
for tax deduction for his daughter studying at
Peking University. The Taiwanese tax agency
rejected his application for the reason that chil-
dren studying at a university not recognized by
the Ministry of Education in Taiwan does not
qualify for tax deduction. Peking University was
not a recognized legal institution by the Taiwanese
Government at the time the said case happened.
However, the grand judge ruled that the practice
from the tax agency was unconstitutional since
tax deduction for children is designed to help the
parents to achieve their responsibility of taking
good care of their children, regardless of where
they stay or what school they study in.

The grand judges in Taiwan take cases from
all the highest governmental bodies in Taiwan.
They can be the executive branches or the justice
branches. They can also take cases from the leg-
islation branches. In addition, they can take cases
from the general public, the interest groups, or
the political parties as long as there is a need for
the grand judges to provide an opinion on law.
According to the statistics of the court in 2010,
the grand judges took 541 cases. Among them,
12 were from the governmental bodies and the
remaining were from the general public.
Obviously, it is quite simple for general citizens
to bring their cases to the grand judges, as long as
cases are points needing
interpretation. However,
most of the time, it is very dif
ﬁ
cult for cases to
appear. In 2010, the grand judges
ﬁ
nalized a total


305
19 An Overview of the Criminal Justice System in Taiwan
of 561 cases, with only 14 explanations. And, the
remaining cases were dismissed by the grand
judges.

In Taiwan, the courts are very busy, busier
than the prosecutors’ of
ﬁ
ce and the police
bureaus. More and more people now bring their
cases to the court. Criminology textbook describes
a
ﬁ
lter process phenomenon in the criminal jus-
tice system, where cases are reduced as they go
through the justice system. However, you will be
unable to see such a
ﬁ
lter process in Taiwan. On
the contrary, the district courts have the largest
number of cases in the system. For example, in
2010, there were 1,075 serious criminal cases,
477,261 criminal cases, and 48,000 juvenile
delinquent cases. As described earlier, the police
forwarded about 360,000 cases a year and there
are about 410,000 cases at the prosecutors’ of
ﬁ
ce.
Obviously, the courts handle more criminal cases
than the prosecutors as well as the police of
ﬁ
cers.
In addition to criminal caseload, the district court
judges have other duties, such as providing signa-
ture for married couples having the wedding cer-
emony in the court, handling of bankruptcy cases,
and any law suits against the government for
compensations from the victims of the state.
These heavy loads have created problems in the
operations of the court, the slowdown of the jus-
tice system and the quality of judicial decisions.

The of
ﬁ
ce of the Judicial Yuan
(
2011
)
, the
administrative body of the judicial system, con-
ducted a survey on consistency of the district
courts judges and the high courts judges and con-
cluded that the consistency rate for criminal cases
was 61.9% in 1996 and 57.8% in 2006. The sta-
tistical
ﬁ
gure improved in 2008 with a rate of
69.91%. This year, the rate is 71.01% which is
the highest rate of consistency yet achieved. The
consistency rate is now used by the Judicial Yuan
as a measure of the quality of judicial discretion.
It shows that the quality of the judicial discretion
is improving. Yet, it also indicates that there are
still a signi
ﬁ
cant number of inconsistent deci-
sions made by different level of courts. The of
ﬁ
ce
of the Judicial Yuan also indicated that the incon-
sistent rate is much higher in the civil court cases.
Furthermore, the senior judges often made deci-
sions which are contrary with decisions made by
the other court. The inconsistent decisions made
by different level judges have raised a concern
about whether justice can be done in the court, or
if there is a fair trial in the court. This is the rea-
son that Taiwanese describe the judges as “dino-
saurs.” They are in
ﬂ
uential and they can do
whatever they want. In the September of 2010, a
female group in Taiwan mobilized a social move-
ment, the white rose movement, which intended
to protest against judges abusing their powers,
particularly, in regard to sexual predators’ cases,
where the judges made apparently lenient pun-
ishments. The protestors took white roses and
marched on the streets to express their distrust of
the judges. The group also asked for professional
evaluation to be established for all the judges.

A survey conducted by Jou et al.
(
2011
)
showed that 68.5% of the 527 respondents in
Taipei city are doubtful about the fairness of the
judges. The widely spread cynicism among the
public concerning the fairness in the judicial sys-
tem has to do with the abuses of the power by the
judges. Theoretically, the judges after careful
review of the evidence would make their own
decisions. However, this might easily create a
problem if a judge takes a bribe and changes the
decision, from guilty to non-guilty, or from a
prison term of 10 years to 1 year. The unlawful
use of the discretionary power by the judges has
created a feeling of distrust by the public con-
cerning the integrity of the judges. The judges’
illegal conduct became a reality when in 2010 the
prosecutor’s of
ﬁ
ce placed a bribery charge against
thirteen judges.

There have been voices calling for judicial
reform to help regain trust from the public.
Among the suggestions, people are being encour-
aged to call the prosecutor’s of
ﬁ
ce if they
ﬁ
nd
wrongdoing in relation to judges as well as pros-
ecutors. People are also encouraged to appear in
court so that this possibly will have an impact on
judges. The reforms also ask for legislation on
judges’ performance, including professional
evaluation among the judges. Lastly, reforms
suggest adoption of the jury system in Taiwan.
There was a signi
ﬁ
cant reform recently when the
Taiwanese Government passed the “Judges Law”
on June 14, 2011. The law requires establishment


306
C. Hou
of the personal review board to process all the
recruiting and promotion of the judges. The law
also requires all judges to be evaluated every
3 years. This will need time and work before one
can examine the effects, but it should help to min-
imize the abuse of power by the judges.

Death Penalty in Taiwan

The latest execution was in March 2011. Five
criminals were executed. Previously, in 2010,
four death penalty convicts were executed and in
the period 2006–2009, for 4 years Taiwan did not
have any execution. Until the end of November
2011, there are a total of 53 persons on the death
row.

In Taiwan, the minister of justice is responsi-
ble for the execution. It requires the Minster to
sign the document for the execution to be han-
dled. As long as the minister refuses to sign, there
will be no execution. However, if the minister
does so, he or she will face serious protests from
the public. One Minister, Miss Wang Ching-feng
(王清峰), stepped down due to her refusal to
carry out an execution in 2010. A tremendous
number of complaints arose and forced the min-
ister to resign.

In Taiwan, the Prosecutor General is the only
authority having the power to delay the execu-
tion. The Prosecutor General has the right to
exercise the right of special appeal after all the
courts have
ﬁ
nalized their independent judg-
ments. The President of Taiwan does not have the
right to exercise this special power, neither does
the Minister of Justice. The exercise of this spe-
cial power would request the highest court for
another trial. If the special appeal is raised, the
execution has to be temporarily halted since the
process of justice is not
ﬁ
nished. The constitution
in Taiwan does not set a limit on the use of the
right of special appeal. It can be any number of
times as long as the Prosecutor General asks for
another trial.

The death penalty is a highly disputed issue in
Taiwan. There is a social movement group, the
Taiwan Alliance to End the Death Penalty, call-
ing for the abolition of capital punishment. They
protest against the death penalty saying that it is
inhumane and could lead to wrongful execution
of the innocent. They also argue that unfair trials
are very common in the criminal justice system.
In fact, in 1997, a young soldier, at the age of 21,
was executed for committing forcible rape. On
12th of September 1996, a 5-year-old girl was
found dead in a military compound. The young
soldier confessed through torture. He later denied
his crime and said that he was tortured and forced
to admit his offense. The military court did not
accept the argument and executed the soldier
immediately. Later, no DNA evidence of the
young man was found on the toilet papers which
were used as the major evidence of the offense. In
fact, it was later found that another soldier, a
pedophile, had raped and killed the girl. The

ﬁ
ngerprint matched with the evidence left at the
scene. The use of death penalty can be dangerous
and unfair. This is the reason that people at the
Taiwan Alliance to End the Death Penalty are
calling for a stop to the executions.

Although there is a social movement calling
for the abolition of the death penalty, public opin-
ion continues to support capital punishment. In
2010, a domestic newspaper conducted a poll
that showed that 74% of the respondents were
against the abolishment of the death penalty
(United Daily News
2010
)
. The poll showed only
12% of respondents supporting the abolishment
of death penalty. Public opinion continues to lead
discussions about the current policy of the death
penalty, and it is very unlikely that the death pen-
alty will be taken away in Taiwan soon. However,
the author suggests that judicial decision of a
death sentence needs stricter regulation. For
example, it must be a uni
ﬁ
ed opinion in the court
if a death penalty is to be used for a convicted
criminal but an oral or a written statement cannot
be used as the only evidence of crime in death
penalty cases.

The right for a counsel is a constitutional right
for a criminal suspect and can be found in the
criminal justice system in Taiwan. However, it is
not a right guaranteed for everyone. In Taiwan, a
counsel can be appointed to assist you only if
your cases are processed at the court. There is no
lawyer to help you when police arrest a suspect.


307
19 An Overview of the Criminal Justice System in Taiwan
There is also no lawyer to accompany you before
the prosecutors. Yet there are two conditions to
be met so that a lawyer can be appointed to assist
you. First, it has to be a serious offense, punish-
able for more than three years imprisonment and,
second, it has to be a condition where the accused
does not have the ability to describe the details of
the offense. The appointed counsels are govern-
mental employees and their incomes are similar
to judges. There are a total of 51 public defense
lawyers in Taiwan.

On the other hand, there are other alternatives
through which members of the public can
ﬁ
nd
legal assistance. You can request for legal assis-
tance from a nonpro
ﬁ
t organization, the Legal
Aid Foundation. The organization will send a
lawyer to protect your rights in the justice sys-
tem. The requirement for granting a lawyer is that
you are poor and you cannot afford to hire a law-
yer. In 2009, there were a total of 83,373 applica-
tions and 32% of them, 27,071, were granted
legal services (Legal Aid Foundation
2010
)
.

The following are two legal rights shared by
citizens in the United States which are not the
case in Taiwan. From a comparative criminology
perspective, it is worthy of discussion since it
could re
ﬂ
ect how the culture may affect the oper-
ation of the justice system. Firstly, it is the right
of trial by the general public, the jury. The sixth
amendment of the US constitution guarantees the
right of trial by jury. Regardless if it is a serious
or a minor offense, one has the right to a jury
trial. In the United States more than half of the
trials are made by jury trial, while 44% of the tri-
als are made by judges. However, due to the dif-
ference in the legal system, there is no jury trial
in Taiwan. Judges take the responsibilities of
making the decisions in the court. The judge-
based legal system is also integrated with the
imperial examination (科舉), where the elites or
public bureaucrats are selected in Chinese soci-
ety. And, the road to a judge is an uneasy one.
You have to take a series of examinations, and
you have to surpass many competitors.
5

Secondly, the due process right of double
jeopardy is not practiced in Taiwan. According to
the 5th amendment of the US constitution, no
person shall be subject for the same offense to be
twice put in jeopardy of life or limb. If no verdict
is reached and release is decided upon the state
cannot appeal in the same offense. This is to for-
bid a defendant from being brought to trial all
over again and thus, remained to be uncertain
with the justice system. Currently, in Taiwan, the
double jeopardy rule cannot be invoked. The
local court makes the judgment of not guilty but
this is not the
ﬁ
nal say within the criminal justice
system. The prosecutors can still litigate your
case to the upper court for a trial. The exercise of
the right of appeal is to assure that justice can be
fairly handled. However, this creates an uncer-
tainty for the defendant. As previously discussed,
there are about 30% of the cases inconsistently
ruled by different judges and naturally the deci-
sion of the criminal justice system could be very
different if a retrial is appealed.

19.7

Conclusion

This paper addresses three major components of
the criminal justice in Taiwan, the police, prose-
cutor, and the court. We examine the organiza-
tions and their functions. We also describe how
they actually process the cases brought to the sys-
tem. The system is a formal social control mech-
anism and it exercises the work of the authorities
to bring these violators of the law to rightful pun-
ishment. It functions this way to maintain social
order within the community in order to achieve a
sustainable environment for all the people.
Moreover, this system is also often used by the
general public to protect their personal rights,
especially when they encounter disputes or
con
ﬂ
icts with others.

There is another component in the criminal
justice system that was not discussed in this chap-
ter, the correctional institutions. In Taiwan, there
are 24 prisons, 12 detention centers, four drug
abuser treatment centers, three occupational
training agencies, two juvenile reform centers,
and two juvenile correctional schools. There are

5  In 2011, 7,981 people took the exam to compete for 70

C. Hou
a total of about 65,000 people in correctional
facilities. If we translate this number into the
International Standard of inmate’s population,
we obtain 280 per 100,000 people, ranking at the
25
th  of about 160 countries (NationMaster.com

2012
). Without doubt, the prison body is a major
component in the justice system.

From the above discussion, we understand that
the three components of the justice operate inde-
pendently and they exercise their individual pow-
ers given to them by law. They have their own
roles and responsibilities and they are connected to
each other in the system. The police act as gate-
keepers, determining the intake stage and they for-
ward the arrested suspects to the prosecutor of
ﬁ
ce.
The prosecutors play the key role of crime investi-
gations and move the cases to the judges, if they

ﬁ
nd any violation of the criminal code. The judges
then make the
ﬁ
nal disposition and change the sta-
tus for an accused from a suspect to a criminal.

The criminal justice system is designed for all
the members of a society to have their rights to
pursue justice. In the case of Taiwan, we found
that more and more people are willing to bring
their cases to the system, revealing the increasing
level of awareness of legal rights among the
Taiwanese. It also means that more and more
Taiwanese are searching for their own justice
from the system, rather than through personal
means.

Furthermore, restorative justice, popularized
by Australian criminologist John Braithwaite

(
1989
)
, is now a formal policy in Taiwan. In
2009, the Ministry of Justice announced this pol-
icy and encouraged restorative programs to
develop in the criminal justice system. Particularly,
it encourages a dialogue between the victims and
the offenders so that normal relationships can be
restored. The court, the prosecutor of
ﬁ
ces, and
the prison are allowed to organize a meeting for
the victims and the offender, along with the par-
ticipation of a mediator. The majority of pro-
grams involve minor offenses, such as family
violence, theft, and traf
ﬁ
c incidents. Restoration
programs are legally part of the justice system in
Taiwan now and we expect that the Justice of
ﬁ
ce
will implement and develop restorative justice
practices to enhance the justice system.

The purpose of criminal justice is to bring law
violators into the system for justice to be dis-
pensed. However, there is a problem when this
system does not operate according to its purpose.
If this happens, the system might not be able to
meet the needs and expectations for people who
are searching for justice. Unfortunately, very
often we witness the system serves the interests
of a certain segment of the people, particularly
those who are powerful or those who are rich.
Here, we have to admit that the justice system
operates with its limitations.

Finally, as a sociologist, I understand that every
society
ﬁ
nds its own way of providing formal jus-
tice and this lays a ground for the particular opera-
tions of the justice system. Indeed, the functional
operations of the criminal justice system need a
cultural basis. Therefore, the criminal justice sys-
tem in Taiwan operates with its own characteristic
style, underpinned by cultural support. The author
would argue that traditional Chinese of
ﬁ
cialdom,
centralization, and big state, rather than the indi-
vidual, underpin the operations of the criminal
justice system in Taiwan, with its judge-centered
and statute-based approach. It is suggested that
criminologists study these cultural underpinnings
to better understand criminal justice both in
Taiwan and elsewhere.

Introduction

Thailand is unique amongst its Southeast Asian
neighbors in never having been colonized and in
remaining to this day a constitutional monarchy. A

ﬂ
edgling democracy prone to political instability
and with a long tradition of resorting to coup d’état
to resolve political stalemate or tension, over the
past several decades the nation has witnessed enor-
mous social and economic change. All these and
other factors have contributed to the character of
the country’s criminal justice system as it is today,
including the existence of the right of prisoners
to claim and bene
ﬁ
t from royal pardons and

ﬂ
uctuations in successive governments’ penal policy.

Working within the acknowledged limitations
imposed by
ﬂ
aws in the recording and maintaining
of statistics in Thailand, the chapter aims to high-
light the country’s current crime trends, punitive
measures, and criminal justice reform A particular
focus is on the links—or discrepancies—between
penal policy and practice, with special attention
being paid to the drug issue, including related
legislation and the distinction that is now made
between drug users as opposed to drug produc-
ers/traf
ﬁ
ckers. It is also demonstrated how the
hard line approach to the latter has affected the
caseload of core criminal justice agencies, in par-
ticular the Department of Corrections and the
Department of Probation.

In drawing attention to and being objectively
critical of several aspects of the Thai criminal jus-
tice system, including the weaknesses in databases
and the policy/practice dichotomy referred to above,
the authors hope to make a small contribution to
instilling awareness of the constant need for
improvements in the system in order to slowly bring
it on a par with international norms and standards.

Current Crime Situation

The primary objectives of this section are to dem-
onstrate the
type
s of crime which Thailand has
faced in recent years through the workload data
of relevant criminal justice system agencies. This
sets the foundation for later discussion of the
reform of Thailand’s criminal policy and the
criminal justice system. At the outset it has to be
stated that a holistic approach has not yet been
applied to the management of crime-related data
in Thailand. Therefore, currently the best
approach that can be taken is to rely on individual
agencies’ data. As the authors are well aware that
dealing with secondary data might have a

impact on the validity and reliability of this paper,
a triangulation approach was used during the
analysis in order to maintain a balance between
data from different sources: namely, police
records, prosecutors’ caseloads, and the judicia-
ry’s statistics.

Although Thailand does not have a “
uniform
crime report
”
1 as such issued by law enforcement
agencies, the statistics presented by the Royal
Thai Police can provide general data on crimes
reported to the authority. Generally speaking,
since 2006 the number of crimes reported to the
police has gradually climbed (Fig.
20.1
). In detail,
473,672 cases were received by the police in
2006, with the number slightly decreasing to
446,392 in 2007 before steadily rising to 487,535
and 661,387 in 2008 and 2009, respectively. The
authors believe that the pronounced increase
between 2008 and 2009 stems from the reintro-
duction of the “get tough” on drugs policy, initi-
ated originally in 2002 (see also below). The
latest
ﬁ
gures show another slight decline to
657,584 in 2010. Thus, the annual average
number of crime reports over this 5-year period
is 545,304. It is worth noting that these statistics
do not include cases which victims decided not to
report to police. (This issue is discussed further
below.)

The most commonly reported violent crime is
assault, followed by attempted murder and rape
(Table
20.1
). A fairly recent de
ﬁ
nition change
in violent crime involves rape: in 2007, the Thai
Criminal Code was amended to expand the
de
ﬁ
nition to cover all types of rape, including
marital rape; rape by/of either sex; and all types
of sexual penetration.

2006 and 2010. The numbers show that arrests
on
drug-related offenses rose sharply over the
period while the numbers of other orthodox
offenses, except property crime, decreased.
Arrests in property crimes slightly increased in
2010. This was consistent with the recent victim
survey which revealed that the majority of the
respondents were victims of property crime (see
the discussion on “dark
ﬁ
gure” below). When
speci
ﬁ
cally looking at the 2010 statistics, the
number of drug arrests was as high as 252,183
cases, increasing from 2006 by almost 130%.

However, it would be wrong to assume that
the increase in arrests on drug-related offenses
was solely due to an increase in the abuse of
tra-
ditional drugs (viz. heroin and cocaine): the
criminalization of new substances, especially
methamphetamine, together with recent govern-
ments’ strict policies on drug suppression are
also signi
ﬁ
cant factors which led to this sharp
rise.
2 Evidence shows that considerable resources
have been allocated to ensure the success of such
policies (Chokprajakchat et al.
2010
)
. Relevant
law enforcement agencies, in particular the Royal
Thai Police and the Of
ﬁ
ce of the Narcotics
Control Board, have been urged to play a more
proactive role in combating the supply of drugs
whilst simultaneously reducing the demand. The
present government of Yingluck Shinawatra has
even made the drug problem a “
national agenda
,”

2  The Nacotic Addict Rehabilitation Act in a way “decrim-
inalized” the act of drug abuses and treated drug users as
“patients” who needed treatment rather than “criminals”
who deserved punishment. Therefore, the rise in drug
cases presented here was mostly related to the production,
distribution, export, and import of the illegal drugs or
substances.

classifying it as one of the “Urgent Policies to be
Implemented in the First Year.”
3 Evidently, there-
fore, a crime control approach prevails when it
comes to dealing with drugs in Thailand.

Gambling
4 and prostitution,
5 the second and
third most common crimes resulting in arrests,
respectively, should also be highlighted here.
Although many countries have already decrimi-
nalized gambling and prostitution, Thailand

continues to regard them as crimes in need of
punishment, possibly due to the fact that Thailand
is a predominantly Buddhist country.
6 According
to Buddhism, there are six evil consequences for
those who indulge in gambling. All forms of
gambling, therefore, are prohibited not only on
religious and moral grounds but also under the
nation’s legislation and criminal policy. In recent
years there have been attempts to decriminalize
gambling on the basis of enhancing the national
revenue through the operation of casinos.
However, advocates for this still have not suc-
ceeded in convincing the policy makers of the
desirability of doing so, despite the fact that most
of Thailand’s neighbors, including Cambodia,
now bene
ﬁ
t
ﬁ
nancially from casinos.

A similar approach has been adopted to the
criminalization of prostitution. Although recog-
nized in theory as a victimless crime, prostitution
can lead to both the violation and exploitation of
the rights of those forced into the sex industry.
Again, Buddhism condemns prostitution, believ-
ing that it potentially provokes in
ﬁ
delity which
runs counter to religious doctrine. Therefore, as a
result of the strict policy on this agenda (Samran

2010
) together with pressure from the public and
both domestic and international media, the num-
ber of arrests in prostitution cases has remained
in the top
ﬁ
ve since 2006.

The process for the passage of these and other
cases through the Thai criminal justice system is
relatively similar to that in other jurisdictions.
That is, after the inquiry process by the police
and the amassing of evidence, the case proceeds
to the Of
ﬁ
ce of the Attorney General (OAG). In
2010, 3,143,686 cases were handled by the
OAG.
7 Cases which, in the opinion of the public
prosecutor, are supported by suf
ﬁ
cient evidence
and are capable of being proved beyond reason-
able doubt will be indicted in the Court of First
Instance. Table

ve

OAG very largely re

Shinawatra to the National Assembly, 23 August 2011:
“1. Urgent Policies to be Implemented in the First Year.
1.2 Prevention of and de
ﬁ
ne solutions to drug problems as
a “national agenda” by adhering to the rule of law to crack
down on and penalize producers, dealers, in
ﬂ
uential per-
sons and wrong doers by strictly enforcing laws; adhere to
the principle that a drug addict is a patient who shall
receive treatment to enable him/her to return to be a pro-
ductive member of society; have a systematic mechanism
to monitor and provide assistance; seriously expedite the
prevention of drug problems by seeking proactive coop-
eration with foreign countries in controlling and seizing
narcotic drugs, chemicals and materials used in the pro-
duction of narcotic drugs smuggled into the country in an
integrated and effective manner; and, prevent vulnerable
groups and the general public from getting involved with
narcotic drugs by harnessing all sectors of society to

ght
against narcotic drugs.” See The Secretariat of the Cabinet.

4  The principle law against gambling in Thailand is Gambling
Act 1935. It, however, does not provide the exact de
ﬁ
nition
of “gambling” but rather speci
ﬁ
es the activities which can
lead to “gambling,” i.e., lottery, Bingo, and billiard. It should
be noted that the activities themselves are not “illegal” but
the “intention” of the parties involved can be deemed as ille-
gal. Basically, the law prohibits the act of betting or wager-
ing for money on such activities.


5  According to the Prevention and Suppression of
Prostitution Act 1996, “prostitution” is de
ﬁ
ned as “sexual
intercourse, or any other act, or the commission of any
other act in order to gratify the sexual desire of another
person in a promiscuous manner in return for money or
any other bene
ﬁ
t, irrespective of whether the person who
accepts the act and the person who commits the act are of
the same sex or not.”

6  A census in 2005 (

http://www.onab.go.th

) revealed that
there were 46,902,100 Buddhists in Thailand (or approxi-
mately 73% of the total population—the authors).

gure includes both new cases and pending cases

records, is replaced by immigration cases in the
OAG’s statistics. It is a moot point as to where
these prostitution cases have “disappeared” and
available statistics have not enabled the authors
to draw a de
ﬁ
nitive conclusion. However, opting
for an alternative source of data has helped to
identify a possible explanation: the key legisla-
tion concerning prostitution. Although efforts
have been made by the authorities to effectively
deal with the issue of human traf
ﬁ
cking in
Thailand, the speci
ﬁ
c laws against prostitution,
one of the core “businesses” of human traf
ﬁ
cking,
and their enforcement are ineffective (Samran

2010
)
. For example, according to the Prevention
and Suppression of Prostitution Act 1996
(Articles 5–7), the commission of many of the
prohibited acts can be settled out of court by the
payment of a
ﬁ
ne. The law also provides room
for police discretion, e.g., in determining the
acts of “communication,” “self-introduction,”
and “invitation,” between the prostitutes and
their customers. This, therefore, could result
in many prostitution cases being dropped by
the police when offenders pay the
ﬁ
ne, with the
result that prostitution does not
ﬁ
gure among
the
ﬁ
ve most common types of cases in the
OAG’s statistics.


Lastly, an examination of the judiciary’s sta-
tistics reveals that in 2010 there were 544,258
cases admitted to the Court of First Instance
(Of
ﬁ
ce of the Judiciary 2012). Table
20.3 demon-
strates that the
ﬁ
ve most common offenses in that
year were, in descending order, as follows: drug-
related offenses (160,478 cases); traf
ﬁ
c offenses
(106,679 cases); gambling (63,228 cases); viola-
tions of immigration laws (34,231 cases); and
theft (31,739 cases) (Of
ﬁ
ce of the Judiciary

2012a,
b
)
. These statistics con
ﬁ
rm that drug cases
have dominated the workload of key agencies in
the criminal justice system in recent years.
Gambling and theft remain in the top
ﬁ
ve, while
the number of traf
ﬁ
c and immigration cases sur-
passed those involving prostitution and weapons
in the Court of First Instance (some prostitution
and weapon cases were minor offenses and thus
not pursued in Court—the authors). In addition,
in 2010 the three most frequent sentences imposed

a These were offenses against Immigration Act, 1979 and the majority involved illegal
entrance to the country and the use of false documents. Section 58 of the Act indicates
that “any alien who has no lawful document for entering the Kingdom under Section
12 (1); or has no Residence Certi
ﬁ
cate under this Act; and also has no identi
ﬁ
cation in
accordance with the Law on Alien registration, is considered to have entered into the

on convicted offenders by the Court of First
Instance were, in descending order, suspension of
punishment,
ﬁ
ne, and imprisonment (Fig.
20.3
).


To sum up, according to the data presented
above, drug-related offenses represent a major
crime problem in Thailand, dominating the
workloads of the police, prosecutors, and the
judiciary. However, as has been suggested by
earlier scholars (Biderman and Reiss
1967
;
Pepper and Petrie
2003
; Pepper et al.
2009
;
Skogan
1975
)
, measuring crime is not an easy
task and relying solely on of
ﬁ
cial data can result
in problems of validity and reliability. Skogan

(
1975
) states that a civilian’s decision to report
an incident to the police is “probably the most
important factor shaping of
ﬁ
cial statistics on
crime” (p. 20) whilst the police’s discretion to
record or write a formal report also affects the
of
ﬁ
cial data (p.22). What is left unreported is
referred to in criminology as the “dark
ﬁ
gure.”
According to Bidderman and Reiss, Jr. (1967),
“the history of criminal statistics bears testimony
to a search for a measure of ‘criminality’ present
among a population, a search that led increasingly
to a concern about the ‘dark
ﬁ
gure’ of crime—
that is, about occurrences that by some criteria
are called crime yet that are not registered in the
statistics of whatever agency was the source of
the data being used” (p. 1) and that “in exploring
the dark
ﬁ
gure of crime, the primary question is
not how much of it becomes revealed but rather
what will be the selective properties of any par-
ticular innovation for its illumination” (p. 1).
These notions date back 35 years, yet the only
“innovation” with which most jurisdictions are
familiar is the crime victim survey as a supple-
ment to the of
ﬁ
cial data. The most recent attempts
to measure crime are the development of
Crime
Severity Index and
Uniform Crime Reporting
Survey in Canada. However, these tools are still
based on the combination of of
ﬁ
cial crime sur-
veys and victim reports.

In Thailand, as mentioned above, a systematic
approach has not yet been adopted to the man-
agement of crime statistics, unlike in developed
countries. Having said that, an attempt to identify
unreported crimes was made by the Of
ﬁ
ce of
Justice Affairs, Ministry of Justice, in 2008, when

315
20 Contemporary Crime and Punishment in Thailand
a ground-breaking crime victim survey was

carried out to examine crimes occurring from 1
January to 31 December 2007 (Of
ﬁ
ce of Justice
Affairs
2009
)
.
8 In total, approximately 18.2 mil-
lion households consisting of members 15 years
old or above were selected as the sample, repre-
senting a total of 51,070,971 interviewees. (To
put this in context, the total population of Thailand
at the end of the survey year was estimated to be
66 million.) Of the total sample, 288,683 persons
(0.6%) reported that they had been victims of
crime during the period involved. Interestingly,
the overwhelming majority of the victims (94.0%)
were victims of property crimes (most commonly
theft, breaking and entering, vehicle theft, and
destruction of property in that order). As for the
characteristics of the victims themselves, the
report demonstrated that the majority were male
(51.9%), married (74.8%), with a mean age of 43
and low education (primary level) (51.9%). Half
of the crimes were committed by a single offender
(51.0%), with offenders being generally unknown
to their victims. Of all these cases, the vast major-
ity of offenders were male (83.2%), assessed to
be aged from 18 to 25 (30.7%), and acting inde-
pendently. The most common response to the
question concerning when the crime occurred
was between 18.01 h and 06.00 h (36.5%) whilst
the crime location was most commonly the vic-
tim’s own residence.

One of the most interesting
ﬁ
ndings of this
pilot project was that 65.2% of actual crimes, in
particular sexual and property crimes, were not
reported to the authorities due to either the vic-
tim’s assumption that the police could not do
anything to help (62.0%) and/or the victim’s
inability to provide any details of the offender
(74.5%). The project not only uncovered unre-
ported crimes but also pinpointed the public’s
low level of con
ﬁ
dence in the Thai criminal jus-
tice system, a key issue which needs to be taken
into account by policy-makers and relevant
authorities. Finally, but not the least, a signi
ﬁ
cant
issue to emerge from the data is that there are as
many hidden, unreported crimes in Thailand as
reported ones. However, to date no visible action
has been taken or new policies introduced by the
authorities to effectively respond to this issue.

20.3

Key Punitive Measures

This section discusses criminal policy through
the examination of the criminal justice process
and of
ﬁ
cial facts and
ﬁ
gures in recent years. In
Thailand, no
of
ﬁ
cial policy as such is made pub-
lic. Having said that, the government’s discourses,
together with statistics from relevant criminal
justice system agencies, can be used as substi-
tutes when exploring the country’s approach to
dealing with crimes and offenders.

20.3.1
The Justice Process

In order to have a clearer picture of the treatment
of offenders, the Thai justice process should
ﬁ
rst
be brie
ﬂ
y introduced. The key legislation is the
Criminal Procedure Code, which guarantees the
right of the accused to counsel during the pretrial
phase, preliminary hearing, and trial itself.
Pursuant to the Constitution, the defendant is also
guaranteed the right to a public trial and to be
present at that trial. As in other jurisdictions, the
law adopts the principle of presumption of inno-
cence, whereby the defendant must not be treated
as a criminal until found guilty by the Court. It is
the burden of the public prosecutor to prove
beyond a reasonable doubt that the defendant
actually committed the crime before the Court
can penalize him or her. However, unlike some
countries there is no plea bargaining in Thailand,
although research is currently underway as to the
feasibility of introducing this. For offenses carry-
ing imprisonment terms of
ﬁ
ve years or more,
even if the defendant pleads guilty the Criminal
Procedure Code requires that there should be
proof beyond reasonable doubt that the defendant
actually committed the
offense. However, when
the defendant pleads not guilty, or when the case

porate missing crimes which were not of

requires further hearings, the Court will set a date
for the trial. Normally, the trial proceeds with the
examination and cross-examination of witnesses,

ﬁ
rst by the prosecutor and then by the defense
lawyer.

The Thai judiciary plays a passive, neutral
role during the trial, with the Court basing its ver-
dict on the facts that emerge during the examina-
tion and cross-examination processes carried out
by the public prosecutor and the defense lawyer.
Sentencing is the culmination of the trial process,
with the Court delivering its verdict together with
a proportionate sentence for a defendant who is
found guilty. To arrive at this and to ensure uni-
formity in sentencing, the Court uses sentencing
guidelines, although these are neither legally
binding nor do they of
ﬁ
cially limit the discretion
of the judge.

The Criminal Code and other criminal statutes
specify the range of minimum and maximum
penalties for a particular offense. The Criminal
Code speci
ﬁ
es
ﬁ
ve types of penalty, viz.,
capital
punishment
;
imprisonment
;
con
ﬁ
nement
;
ﬁ
ne
;
and
forfeiture of property to the state
. Section 39
of the Code also stipulates the following “safety
measures”: protective custody; prohibition on
entering speci
ﬁ
ed locations; the execution of a
bond upon receipt of a security for keeping the
peace; con
ﬁ
nement to an institution for treat-
ment; and prohibition on engaging in speci
ﬁ
ed
occupations. As speci
ﬁ
ed in the Criminal Code,
in cases for which the maximum term of impris-
onment is not more than three years and the
accused has not previously served a prison term,
except for negligence or petty offences, the Court
can use its discretion to grant a suspension of the
sentence and a suspension of the punishment for
a
ﬁ
xed period of time. If the accused does not
commit another offense during this period, they
will be discharged.

When found guilty of an offense punishable
by imprisonment, the convicted offender is
detained in a state prison administered by the
Department of Corrections. If the Court of First
Instance imposes a sentence of capital punish-
ment or life imprisonment, it must send all
ﬁ
les
relating to the judgement to the Court of Appeal
for review, even if no appeal has been lodged
against such a judgement, as such sentences are
not
ﬁ
nal unless con
ﬁ
rmed by the Court of Appeal.
Execution of sentence may be suspended if the
defendants are insane; if it is feared that their life
will be endangered by imprisonment; if they are
pregnant; or if less than three years have elapsed
since they gave birth. In cases where the defen-
dant has been sentenced to capital punishment,
this cannot be executed until the provisions of
the Criminal Procedure Code governing pardon
have been complied with. If a person sentenced
to capital punishment becomes insane before
being executed, the execution is suspended pend-
ing his or her recovery. Furthermore, the death
sentence is not applicable to a person under eigh-
teen and such a sentence on a pregnant woman
will be commuted to life imprisonment after
being suspended for the
ﬁ
rst three years after the
child is born. In fact, very few executions take
place in Thailand, the most recent having been
carried out in 2009 when two convicted drug
offenders and a murderer were executed. It should
also be mentioned in passing that the execution
method was “modernized” in 2003 when legisla-
tion was enacted to replace the
ﬁ
ring squad by
lethal injection.
9 As of 20 March 2012, seventy-
one prisoners, all male, were on death row in
Thailand (Department of Corrections 2012,
unpublished data).

Under the terms of the Criminal Procedure
Code, if either party is dissatis
ﬁ
ed with the judge-
ment of the Court of First Instance, they can
appeal to the Court of Appeal. Disagreements on
legal issues can, without exception, be sent to the
Court of Appeal and then, if necessary, to the
Supreme Court. Factual disputes can also be
appealed in both these Courts, subject to restric-
tions at both stages. In theory, the appeal has to
be lodged within thirty days of the issuance of the
Court of First Instance’s verdict or order.

criminal justice system from that of other juris-

dictions is the active use of the Royal Pardon.
This can be granted to any eligible individual or
group of individuals at the discretion of the mon-
arch, as stated in the 2007 Constitution
10 and in
the Criminal Procedure Code.
11 The pardon may
be in the form of an unconditional release, a com-
mutation, or reduction of punishment. A
Collective Royal Pardon is granted on certain
auspicious national occasions: in recent years
these have included the so-called Seventh Cycle
Birthday Anniversary (i.e., 84th birthday) of His
Majesty the King on 5 December 2011 and the
60th Anniversary of His Majesty’s Accession to
the Throne in 2006. On the other hand, an
Individual Royal Pardon is granted as a matter of
routine procedure: any convicted prisoner; a con-
cerned person (parent, offspring, or spouse); or
diplomatic representative (in the case of foreign
prisoners) wishing to petition the monarch for a
pardon may do so by submitting the petition
through of
ﬁ
cial channels, viz., the prison author-
ity, the Ministry of Justice, and the Of
ﬁ
ce of His
Majesty’s Principal Private Secretary, and for for-
eign nationals, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs or
their country’s diplomatic mission.

Overall, it is fair to state that Thailand’s crimi-
nal justice process is relatively similar to that of
other jurisdictions, especially the British court
system, as most of the key founders of the mod-
ern Thai justice system were trained in England.
In fact, many recent developments in the Thai
system continue the shift towards Western meth-
ods and standards, for example, restorative jus-
tice; “the re-emergence of feminism” (Newburn

2003
:235); and “the rise of victim support”
(2003:241). The reform of criminal justice is dis-
cussed later in this chapter.

20.3.2
Imprisonment

Founded in 1915, the Department of Corrections
(DOC) plays a signi
ﬁ
cant role in keeping in
custody those sentenced by the Court. The two key
thrusts of the correctional service as presented in
the organization’s vision are
custody and
reha-
bilitation
. In order to attain the objective of
secure custody, currently the DOC’s principal
strategy focuses on enhancing prison security for
effective management of high-pro
ﬁ
le prisoners
by equipping its main facilities with the neces-
sary custodial technology as well as competent
human resources. As for rehabilitation, the DOC
has established a new paradigm of correctional
works which emphasizes the importance of reha-
bilitation during incarceration, with the ultimate
goal of returning inmates to the community as
good, law-abiding citizens.

Rehabilitation programs for offenders in cor-
rectional facilities can be categorized into 3
groups: basic programs; supporting programs;
and reentry programs. The
ﬁ
rst comprises the
main activities for inmates, e.g., both mainstream
and vocational educational training; artistic train-
ing; and religious and recreational activities, all
of which aim to equip offenders with basic com-
petencies in readiness for their return to society.
The second group involves short-term programs
which emphasize knowledge enhancement and
skills training, e.g., anger management, absten-
tion from alcohol and tobacco, and empathy with
victims’ feelings. Lastly, the third block recog-
nizes the necessity of preparing prisoners for
reintegration and therefore focuses on such issues
as family, employment, social reintegration, and
necessary life skills, with the objective of reduc-
ing the risk of reoffending. Simultaneously, this
enhances the general public’s con
ﬁ
dence that
offenders will return to society as law-abiding
citizens.

Figure
20.4 shows the Thai prison population
over the past twelve years. In 2002 the prison
population reached a historical peak, with
252,879 prisoners incarcerated nationwide. This
was primarily due to the lead-up to what in 2003
of
ﬁ
cially became known as the “War on Drugs”
policy of the then government, with most drug
offenders of whatever nature being indiscrimi-
nately imprisoned. The subsequent decline
(2004–2007) re
ﬂ
ects three factors: the release of
prisoners under Royal Pardons; the implementation

of the Narcotic Addict Rehabilitation Act 2002;
and the use of alternatives to imprisonment to
help overcome overcrowding. From 2008 the
graph starts to rise again as a result of the reintro-
duction of more stringent policies together with a
tendency to impose very long sentences on major
drug offenders. Nevertheless, in 2010 a large
number of prisoners were released under Royal
Pardons, granted for quali
ﬁ
ed prisoners to cele-
brate the 60th Anniversary of HM King
Bhumibhol’s Coronation: this somewhat allevi-
ated overcrowding. However, the most recent sta-
tistics show a further increase in the prison
population, mainly due to a renewed rise in the
number of convicted drug offenders.

As of 1 February 2012, 227,750 individuals
were being kept in custody across the country,
with the breakdown of their legal status being
73.44% convicts; 25.44% remandees; and 1.12%
others (Table
20.4
). In line with other prison sys-
tems, the majority (85%) of the prison population
is male (Fig.

20 Contemporary Crime and Punishment in Thailand
that the growth in the number of female prisoners
is on a par with, or even higher than, their male
counterparts. In addition, recent international
data comparing the incarceration rate of 218
countries ranked Thailand at 28th, with an incar-
ceration rate of 328 per 100,000 population
12
(International Centre for Prison Studies 2012). In
a speci
ﬁ
cally Asian context, Thailand came sec-
ond after Iran.


When looking at types of offenses (Fig.
20.6
),
the majority of convicts (104,722 or 62.73%)
were drug offenders, followed by those convicted
of property crimes (29,852 or 17.88%) and life-
threatening offenses (12,319 or 7.38%). It should
be noted that currently incarcerated drug offend-
ers consist mainly of producers and pushers: as a
result of legal reform and diversion programs,
most drug users are now diverted to drug reha-
bilitation centers (see discussion on probation
below). In addition, in view of the discussion in
the previous section on both crimes reported to
the police and the crime victim survey, it is not
surprising that the proportion of drug prisoners
is much greater than other subgroups. Again,
this con
ﬁ
rms that the “get tough on drugs” pol-
icy has led to the imposition of the maximum
sentence for those convicted of drug-related
offenses.


20.3.3
Probation and Parole

In Thailand, probation is the main alternative
sanction to imprisonment. The probation system
for adult offenders was introduced into the coun-
try with the establishment of the Central
Probation Of
ﬁ
ce under the Probation Procedure
Act 1979. Since then the Thai probation system/
agency has gradually expanded and in 1992 the
of
ﬁ
ce was upgraded and renamed the Department
of Probation (DOP).

The administration of probation work in
Thailand is broadly on a par with other jurisdic-
tions. Adult offenders on probation are those
who have committed an offense punishable by a
term of imprisonment of not more than 3 years,
with the Court either suspending the determina-
tion of punishment or designating the punish-
ment but suspending the implementation thereof.
In addition, the Court may order probation
of
ﬁ
cers to conduct a social investigation for its

a comprehensive mechanism for developing the
probation system. Thus, by the end of October
2003, the responsibility of the DOP had been
modi
ﬁ
ed to cover probation sanctions against the
accused and offenders at all stages of adjudica-
tion, including adult probation, parolees, and
juvenile offenders on suspension of sentence or
conditional release from a training center.

Table
20.6 represents the probation and parole
population from 2003 to 2010. Overall statistics
show that the probation population has been
increasing constantly at an average rate of 5.8%
per annum. The number of adult probationers
doubled from 2003 to 2010, while the number of
juvenile probationers showed an even more
remarkable increase (
ﬁ
vefold) over the same
seven-year period, from 4,674 in 2003 to 23,733
in 2010. On the other hand, the parole population
in 2010, including prisoners released on sentence
remission, decreased about 56% from 2003.
When putting types of offense in perspective,
most of the caseload in the probation and parole
system was involved with traf
ﬁ
c and drug cases.
Statistics show that traf
ﬁ
c-related offenses were
at the top of the chart in 2007 (34.22% of all
newly admitted cases), and again in both 2008
(30.76%) and 2010 (40.12%), with drug offenses
in second place in both these years. However,
drug cases
13 topped the chart in 2009 (45.34% of
all cases) and again in 2011 (38.41%).
14


Compared with the number of cases success-
fully completed each year over the period 2006–
2009 (Table
20.7
), the rate is satisfactory, with a
range of 91–93%, even though there has been a
slight year-on-year percentage decline since 2007.


Over the period 2007–2009, the percentage of
probationers who had their probation revoked
due to a breach of conditions ranged from 6.8%
(2007) to 8.1% (2009) (Table
20.8
). Probationers
and parolees who reoffended after completion of
their sentence ranged from 10.7% to 15.3% over
the same 3-year period.

cies’ data in both this section and the previous
one, the authors wish to argue that they re

20 Contemporary Crime and Punishment in Thailand
ple is the policy towards drug offenses: it seems
that the government chose to “get tough” on one
speci
ﬁ
c crime which would attract the attention
of the public and the media (see Newburn
2003
,
264–267). This has resulted in a case overload
problem for criminal justice agencies, especially
the two core agencies—the Department of
Corrections and the Department of Probation—
which are key administrative bodies responsible
for implementing the Court’s sentences.

Although attempts have been made to deal
with drug offences by diverting drug use offences
from the justice system, drug-related offences are
still in the majority, consuming vast resources
from agencies across the system. Additionally, the
statistics from the DOC suggest that imprisonment
remains the most convenient and safest option to
punish wrongdoers. The authors wish to empha-
size that a holistic approach should be adopted
in dealing with crimes, especially drug crimes.
Currently, overreliance on imprisonment still
exists, whilst the employment of alternative sanc-
tions remains limited. Moreover, the ef
ﬁ
ciency
of the criminal justice system in dealing with
crimes appears to be suspect. These are some of
the challenges facing the criminal justice system
which are discussed in detail in the next section.


20.4

Criminal Justice Reform

When looking at the incarceration rate and pun-
ishments speci
ﬁ
ed by Thai law, it is undeniable
that the Thai criminal justice system relies exces-
sively on the use of imprisonment, with a higher
incarceration rate in comparison with that of other
countries. Sanctions imposed on offenders pri-
marily consist of payment of a
ﬁ
ne and suspension
of sentence/punishment with or without proba-
tion, traditionally the standard noncustodial mea-
sures applied in Thailand. Community service,
which is a popular, mainstream noncustodial mea-
sure in many countries, is not widely applied in
Thailand and is limited to some speci
ﬁ
c groups.
15

In addition, the criminal justice system has
been criticized on many fronts over the past
decade—including miscarriage of justice; rights
violations of both the accused and victims; abuse
of power; delay in the administration of justice;
and prison overcrowding (Kittayarak
2001
;
Thailand
Criminal
Law
Institute
1998;
16
Ua-Amnoey
1999
)
. These issues have been
repeatedly raised by politicians, scholars, human
right advocates, and other stakeholders whenever

ﬂ
agrant cases of injustice have occurred and have
been sensationalized in the media. It has been
argued that the inef
ﬁ
ciency of the criminal justice
system is partly caused by the lack of clear crimi-
nal policy and overemphasis on crime control.
However, other scholars regard the root of the
problem as being the “nonsystem” of criminal
justice agencies (Kittayarak
2003
)
.

During the 1990s, there was status disparity
among the core criminal justice agencies. The
Of
ﬁ
ce of the Attorney General
17 and the Courts
of Justice
18 at that time were independent,
although as court administration remained one of
the core responsibilities of the Ministry of Justice,
the ministry was somewhat scathingly referred to
as the “Ministry of Court.” On the other hand, the
Royal Thai Police and the Department of
Corrections were under the Ministry of the
Interior and the Department of Probation was
under the Ministry of Justice. Thus not only was
the structure of the criminal justice system inap-
propriate and fragmented, but the agencies’ oper-
ations
were
also
uncoordinated,
focusing
primarily on their own particular goals, with the
policy and the objectives of their umbrella orga-
nization accorded lower priority.

The inef
ﬁ
ciency of the criminal justice system
gradually became the focus of both the public
and successive governments. Therefore, when

15  In Thailand, community service is applied to those who
are on probation and consent to do such service; those
who request to do community service in lieu of
ﬁ
ne; or
drug users who are under compulsory drug treatment.

tively under the Ministry of Justice from 1991 to 2000.

L.D. Junlakan et al.
the 1997 Constitution was drafted, the reform of
criminal justice and rights protection were two
core issues to which the drafting committee paid
particular attention. As a result, the so-called
People’s Charter contained many Sections

focusing on due process and the reform of the
criminal justice system. Subsequently, the 2007
Constitution maintained most of the ideology
enshrined in its 1997 counterpart whilst putting
further emphasis on criminal justice agencies’
ef
ﬁ
ciency, including public participation in
the administration of justice and the establish-
ment of independent agencies to provide checks
and balances.

However,
midway
between
these
two
Constitutions, signi
ﬁ
cant criminal justice reform
took place in 2002 when the government decided
to reorganize the Ministry of Justice and establish
new departments to improve the system’s
ef
ﬁ
ciency. The reorganization of the Ministry
was also a response to overall civil service reform
based on citizen-centered principles and result-
based implementation. This, along with other
factors, led to changes in policies and the reorga-
nization of criminal justice which are discussed
later in this section.

20.4.1
Reform of Criminal Policy

In recent years—and in particular since the major
criminal justice reform of 2002 referred to
above—there have been changes and new direc-
tions in Thai criminal policy, not so much explic-
itly stated, but clearly re
ﬂ
ected in related
legislation and policy, including both the Criminal
and Criminal Procedure Codes, the National
Master Plan on Criminal Justice, and government
policy as a whole. To illustrate this shift, policy
and practices as applied over the past few years
are outlined below.

20.4.1.1
Increased Emphasis on the Rights
of Victims, the Accused,
and Offenders

Due to the 1997 and 2007 Constitutions’ empha-
sis on rights protection and conformity with
international standards for promoting the rule of
law and human rights, Thai criminal policy now
increasingly stresses the rights of victims, the
accused, and offenders, especially the vulnerable,
such as children and women. Acknowledging
losses suffered by both crime victims and accused
persons who themselves become victims of the
miscarriage of justice, Thailand enacted the
Compensation for Crime Victims and Accused
Act 2001 to
ﬁ
nancially compensate them for their
mental and/or physical suffering. Under this law,
victims of serious crime, such as rape, murder,
and assault, are entitled to receive compensation
from the State to cover loss of earnings, medical
expenses, death, and other losses if applicable. In
the case of accused persons, the compensation
applies to those who have been prosecuted,
con
ﬁ
ned, and then had the case against them
withdrawn due to their innocence, or when the
Court’s judgment is one of not guilty. The com-
pensation covers their criminal defense expenses,
loss of liberty during con
ﬁ
nement, medical
expenses, and death.

To protect the rights of children and juveniles,
the Criminal Procedure Code and legislation
relating to juvenile justice have been amended to
guarantee the rights protection of juvenile wit-
nesses and offenders. The amendments
19 stipulate
that the questioning of a child/juvenile by an
inquiry of
ﬁ
cial must be carried out separately
from other offenders; in an appropriate place; and
without discrimination or stigmatization. The
legal adviser of the alleged child/juvenile offender
is required to be continually present at the time of
their being informed of the charge and during
their interrogation. Additionally, in the case of an
alleged serious offence, the inquiry of
ﬁ
cial must
interrogate the child/juvenile offender in the pres-
ence of a psychologist or a social worker; a per-
son designated and requested by the child/
juvenile; and a public prosecutor.

Likewise, on the issue of women offenders,
Thailand has become a leader in the promotion of
their enhanced treatment and protection of their
rights. Under the royal patronage and leadership

19  Sections 133, 134, and 172 of the Criminal Procedure
Code as amended in 1999.


323
20 Contemporary Crime and Punishment in Thailand
of HRH Princess Bajrakitiyabha, in 2008 Thailand
initiated the Enhancing Lives of Female Inmates
(ELFI) project to promote appropriate treatment
programs for women prisoners, from their enter-
ing the correctional system to the aftercare phase.
The recommendations proposed by ELFI became
internationally recognized and supported, lead-
ing to their ultimate adoption by the United
Nations as the United Nations Rules for the
Treatment of Women Prisoners and Non-
Custodial Measures for Women Offenders, or
“Bangkok
Rules,”
in
December
2010.
Consequently the United Nations Of
ﬁ
ce on Drugs
and Crime (UNODC) was given the task of dis-
seminating the Rules as a supplement to the
Standard Minimum Rules for the Treatment of
Prisoners and the Tokyo Rules.

20.4.1.2
Application of a Wider Range
of Alternative Measures

The problem of excessively large caseloads, found
at every stage of the Thai criminal justice system,
especially prison overcrowding, has driven crimi-
nal justice agencies to apply a range of alternative
measures to divert cases from the system. This
policy was in effect initiated by a Cabinet
Resolution of 10 July 2001, providing guidelines
on reducing caseload and overcrowding. These
include the use of con
ﬂ
ict resolution as an alter-
native measure and sentencing option, as well as
the implementation of compulsory drug treatment
to divert drug users from the system.

The implementation of this policy is also evi-
dent through the application of restorative justice
practices, which are currently implemented at
both the pretrial and trial stages in both adult and
juvenile cases. When the amended Juvenile and
Family Court and Procedure Act was promul-
gated in 2010, conferencing became extensively
used with child/juvenile offenders as an alterna-
tive approach to divert cases from the juvenile
justice system and rehabilitate young offenders.
In such cases, if the victim(s) and responsible
of
ﬁ
cial agree, conferencing takes place and a
rehabilitation plan, aiming simultaneously to
reform the offender, make restoration to the
victim(s), and promote public safety, is devised.
Although the basic principle of restorative justice
aims to provide restoration for the victims and
the community, this approach also bene
ﬁ
ts
offenders by providing an opportunity for them
to make reparation and be diverted from the justice
system. Since its implementation in 2003, 20,000
children and juveniles have been diverted by
non-prosecution orders.

Another alternative measure development is
the compulsory drug treatment scheme, endorsed
by the Narcotic Addict Rehabilitation Act 2002.
This scheme was innovatory in that it made a dis-
tinction between drug users and drug producers,
sellers, and exporters: the users became classi
ﬁ
ed
as “patients” and therefore sent to rehabilitation
centers for drug treatment programs, depending
on the nature of their case. If the treatment shows
satisfactory results, they are then diverted from
criminal procedures without a criminal record.
Since its implementation in 2003, over 500,000
drug users have been diverted from the criminal
justice system.

20.4.1.3
Promotion of Community
Participation at Policy
and Practice Levels

Lastly, the change in criminal policy can be
observed through new schemes aiming to encour-
age community participation in criminal justice.
In accordance with the National Master Plan for
Justice Administration 2009–2012, a strategy is
in place to promote justice system participation
by all social sectors, including the community,
the private sector, local administration, and the
media. In fact, this policy had previously been
put into practice, with the National Master Plan
serving to promote its continuation and empha-
size its importance. For example, the concept of
voluntary assistance, such as acting as a volun-
teer probation of
ﬁ
cer, was established in 1986
but was subsequently extended to cover other
areas, such as the scheme for volunteering in
rights and liberties protection established in 2005.
However, the most innovatory project for public
involvement in the justice system is the
Community Justice Scheme, introduced by the
Department of Probation in 2003, under which
opportunities are provided for members of the
community to work in partnership with justice


324
L.D. Junlakan et al.
of
ﬁ
cials. Volunteers establish centers in their own
locality and they are then collaboratively involved
in justice activities, such as crime prevention,
offender rehabilitation, and con
ﬂ
ict resolution.
The primary aim of the Community Justice
Scheme is not to lessen the burden of justice
agencies or help justice of
ﬁ
cials perform their
duties but to empower the community to make
itself strong and just through its own members.
After nearly a decade since its inauguration, the
Community Justice Scheme has proved to be an
appropriate channel for the Thai criminal justice
system to respond to the needs of the public and
improve con
ﬁ
dence in its services. Indeed, it
could be argued that as Thailand moves towards
becoming a more mature democracy, greater
public involvement in the criminal justice system
is an inevitable step and this is the direction which
all justice agencies should follow.

20.4.2
Reform of the Organization
of Criminal Justice Agencies

As has already been mentioned, the 1997 and
2007 Constitutions, coupled with overall civil
service reform, have had a major in
ﬂ
uence on
Thai criminal justice reform. Section 230 of the
1997 Constitution paved the way for the estab-
lishment of new ministries, sub-ministries, or
expanded departments through the promulgation
of a speci
ﬁ
c law. Thus in 1998 the Royal Thai
Police became an independent organization under
the Prime Minister in order to improve its
ef
ﬁ
ciency, whilst in 2000 the Courts of Justice
became fully independent when its administra-
tive work, judicial affairs, and legal affairs were
separated from the Ministry of Justice and trans-
ferred to the newly founded Of
ﬁ
ce of the
Judiciary. There was also major reorganization of
the Ministry of Justice itself, with the substantial
changes including the transfer of departments
from other ministries and the establishment of

ﬁ
ve new departments.
20 Since the establishment
of these is essential to improving the ef
ﬁ
ciency of
the criminal justice system and promoting the
coordination of criminal justice administration,
each organization is brie
ﬂ
y introduced below.

20.4.2.1
Of
ﬁ
ce of Justice Affairs

The Of
ﬁ
ce of Justice Affairs was founded to sup-
port the new approach to the justice system under
the reform policies, with its core functions
including being responsible for the administra-
tive work of the National Commission for Justice
Administration Development and studying and
analyzing policies, strategic plans, and justice
system management.

20.4.2.2
Department of Special
Investigation

The Department of Special Investigation was
established speci
ﬁ
cally for the surveillance,
deterrence, and effective prevention of increas-
ingly complex crimes perpetrated by organized
criminal groups, especially those of a transna-
tional nature, which jeopardize the nation’s econ-
omy, social order, and stability, as well as for the
eradication of illicit groups or activities that
endanger international security.

20.4.2.3
Department of Rights
and Liberties Protection

The mission of the Department of Rights and
Liberties Protection is to promote and protect the
people’s rights and liberties as stipulated by law
through the development of the promotion of
justice and the enhancement of the public’s
awareness of their rights and liberties. In addi-
tion, it offers protection and primary assistance
to witnesses, victims, and accused persons in
criminal cases.


20.4.2.4
Central Institute
of Forensic Science

The institute’s main responsibilities are to receive
complaints from the public affected by forensic
science malpractices; to provide forensic science
services, e.g., the identi
ﬁ
cation of missing per-
sons and the veri
ﬁ
cation of evidence; to study
and research forensic science issues with both
governmental and nongovernmental sectors; and

20  A sixth new department, the Of
ﬁ
ce of the Public Sector
Anti-Corruption Commission, was later established in
2008, in accordance with the 2007 Constitution.


325
20 Contemporary Crime and Punishment in Thailand
to supervise forensic science personnel to ensure
that they comply with codes of practice, stan-
dards, and ethics.

20.4.2.5
Department of Juvenile
Observation and Protection

The Juvenile Observation and Protection Center
was upgraded to the Department of Juvenile
Observation and Protection with the expectation
that it would serve as the core agency for protect-
ing the rights and welfare of children in the juve-
nile justice system. Its main responsibilities are
to promote the rehabilitation of child and juve-
nile delinquents; to facilitate restorative justice
and other alternative measures for diversion; and
to provide other assistance services for children
by liaising with their families and community
networks.






20.5

Challenges and Conclusion

In accordance with the core principles of the
Constitution—including the protection of the
people’s rights and liberty, independence, and
good governance—Thailand’s criminal justice
system is continually being reformed. This reform
has clearly wrought changes in criminal justice
administration and processes, which require the
understanding and cooperation of those both
inside and outside the system: criminal justice
personnel need to understand the revised con-
cepts and implement them accurately, whilst pub-
lic support for the new policies is also needed.
Since Thai society is accustomed to the conven-
tional criminal justice system based on the pun-
ishment of offenders, the new policy and schemes
focusing on rights protection, public involvement,
and alternative approaches may not be readily
understood (Ua-Amnoey
2002
)
. To gain support
and implement the reforms smoothly, communi-
cation with and education of the public as well as
justice personnel are of critical importance.

Another concern regarding the changes in
Thai criminal justice is the implementation of
alternative approaches, especially alternatives to
imprisonment. Even when new laws or approaches
relating to alternative measures are promulgated
or launched in Thailand, it is all too likely that
they will not be implemented immediately, either
because no one agency assumes the responsibility
for doing so or appropriate resources are not
provided. Indeed, it would appear that changes
in criminal justice have been occurring at a rate
which prevents the system from responding in a
timely and appropriate manner. For example, the
Criminal Procedure Code was amended to enable
the use of home detention and electronic moni-
toring in 2007 but neither of these measures have
yet been implemented because, as referred to
above, it is not clearly speci
ﬁ
ed which agency
should be responsible for these innovative
approaches and no clear budgetary policy was
provided. This problem of implementation is
likely to continue if there is no single authority
capable of making such decisions for the system
as a whole and which simultaneously has the
power to compel the government to provide
suf
ﬁ
cient resources.

Recent developments seem to indicate a start
in addressing the above concerns but much
remains to be done. In order to provide an effec-
tive response to these challenges as well as to
strengthen the unity, effectiveness, and ef
ﬁ
ciency
of the justice system, the National Commission
for Justice Administration Development was
established by the National Justice Administration
Development Act 2006. The commission, chaired
by the Prime Minister or the designated Deputy
Prime Minister, consists of heads of relevant
organizations including the judiciary, the Ministry
of Justice, and the Ministry of the Interior.
However, to date this commission has not made
signi
ﬁ
cant progress, due in part, it can be specu-
lated, to the political upheavals and changes of
the past six years which have necessarily resulted
in changes of the chairperson.

Evidently, there still remains a long way to go
in the development of the Thai criminal justice
system, with more challenges to be faced.
Political uncertainty and instability remain preva-
lent, with the associated policy changes in agen-
cies. Although some criminal justice organizations
are now independent, successive governments
still have the potential to generate policy incon-
sistencies and inef
ﬁ
cient resource allocation.


326
L.D. Junlakan et al.
However, international trends and organizations
are putting pressure on Thailand to adopt stan-
dards and safeguards concerning human rights
and good governance, and this can only have a
positive in
ﬂ
uence on the Thai criminal justice
system, leading eventually to the development of
more effective and fairer processes.

Introduction

The international recognition of violence against
women as human rights and health-related issues
of priority began in the 1990s. Key events include
the Declaration on the Elimination of Violence
Against Women adopted by the United Nations
General Assembly in 1993 (United Nations
General Assembly
1993
)
, the appointment of a
special rapporteur on Violence Against Women
by the Commission on Human Rights in 1994
(United Nations Commission on Human Rights

1994
)
,
1 the resolution to “combat all forms of
violence against women” as one of the Millennium
Goals by the United Nations General Assembly
in 2000 (United Nations General Assembly

2000
)
, discussion of the in-depth study on vio-
lence against women at the United Nations
General Assembly in 2006 (United Nations
General Assembly
2006
)
, and more recently, the
launch of the campaign to end violence against
women (UNiTE) by the United Nations Secretary-
General Ban Ki-moon in 2008 (United Nations

2008
)
. Closer to Singapore, the establishment of
the ASEAN Commission on Promotion and
Protection of Rights of Women and Children in
2010 portends greater efforts towards the elimi-
nation of violence against women in


Singapore
(ASEAN
2010
)
.

However, unless there is systematic data col-
lection on the types and extent of violence against
women, it is not possible to have an accurate
evaluation of the effectiveness of international
and national strategies tackling such violence.
Different types of violence may also impact
groups of women in different ways, leading them
to decline assistance or redress. It is dif
ﬁ
cult to
know the true prevalence of violence against
women, particularly if it is violence committed
by a husband or an intimate partner since these
forms of violence are seldom reported. In a 2005
study published by the World Health Organization
based on a survey of 24,000 women in ten coun-
tries, it was found that between 55% and 95% of
women who had been physically abused by their
partners had never sought help from formal ser-
vice providers (such as the police, hospitals,
social services, or shelters) or persons in a posi-
tion of authority (such as local or religious lead-
ers) (Garciá-Moreno et al.
2005
)
.

There is limited knowledge about the true
prevalence of violence against women in
Singapore as well. Police data that is publicly
available do not disaggregate “crime against
the person” into gender or the type of crimes

Violence Against Women
in Singapore: Initial Data from
the International Violence Against

committed
(Singapore Police Force n.d.

)
.
2 Other
data available in Singapore focus on aspects such
as women who report spousal violence to the
police
(
Ministry of Community Development,
Youth and Sports, n.d.(a)

)
, women who seek med-
ical assistance in public hospitals for domestic
violence
(
Ministry of Community Development,
Youth and Sports, n.d.(b)

)
,
3 and applications to
the Family Court for protection orders against
family
violence
(Ministry
of
Community
Development, Youth and Sports
2009
)
.
4
These do
not give a complete picture of all women who
have experienced violence from men since they
require the victims to come forward to seek ser-
vices from the police, public hospital, or Family
Court, and only count them if the violence is
experienced in a certain way (namely, “spousal”
violence, “family violence”, or where the injuries
are severe enough to warrant medical assistance).

Several studies have appeared over the years
in Singapore which attempt to give a picture of
the socio-demographic pro
ﬁ
le of women victims
of violence (Seow et al.
1995
; Subordinate Courts
of Singapore
1998
; Lim
2002
; Foo and Seow

2005
; Basu
2009
)
. However, they are limited in
nature as well since only those who actively seek
help from public hospitals, the Family Court, or a
social service agency are covered. There has not
been an effort to uncover the true extent of male
violence against women, the victims’ pro
ﬁ
le and
their experiences when engaging help from the
police, and so on through a victim survey.

It is in the light of this background that the
present study was conducted using the
International Violence Against Women Survey
(“IVAWS”).
5 It aimed to uncover the preva-
lence and types of violence against women in
Singapore through a random sampling of
Singapore
households.
Socio-demographic
details of those women who experienced vio-
lence in the last 12 months, the severity and
perception of the incident, and contact with the
police will also be discussed here. Through
the adoption of the IVAWS, it is also hoped that
the Singapore data will contribute to future cross-
cultural analyses of violence against women in
other parts of the world and promote policy eval-
uation of national and international efforts to
curb violence against women.


21.2

Methodology

The Nielsen Company was engaged to carry out
the IVAWS in Singapore. The survey was trans-
lated into Chinese and Malay by Nielsen’s
experienced translators. A total of 2,006 women
aged between 18 and 69 years old were sur-
veyed through a random sampling of Singapore
households (mean age of respondents: 42.5
years).
6 Only one woman (whose birthday was
next) in each household was identi
ﬁ
ed for the
survey. Female interviewers were used and all
the interviews were conducted in person. The
interviews were conducted between February
and May 2009.

Owing to earlier studies which found a

disproportionate number of Indians among women
who experienced violence (Seow et al.
1995
;
Subordinate Courts of Singapore
1998
; Lim
2002
;

2  Even when statistics on the category of “rape” was pro-
vided for 1989–2008 (see

http://www.spf.gov.sg/stats/
stats_doc/stats_selected_areasconcern08.pdf

, last accessed
2 July 2010), this included cases of “statutory rape”, i.e.
consensual sex with an underaged girl, which raise differ-
ent concerns from cases involving non-consensual sex.


3
The data for the second half of 2001 and for 2006 are missing.

4  This category includes applications from men as well as
women applicants who may have been abused by other
women in the household, e.g. by their daughter or mother.
Protection orders are only available against certain forms of
violence and for those in (or have been in) certain relation-
ships with the abuser. A “protection order” is a form of
restraining order made by a court which requires an abuser
to refrain from further acts of violence or he/she will be sent
to jail or
ﬁ
ned otherwise. See the Women’s Charter (Chapter
353, 2009 Revised Edition) Part VII and Chan
(
1996
)
.


5  The IVAWS has been conducted in 11 jurisdictions to
date: Australia, Costa Rica, the Czech Republic, Denmark,
Greece, Hong Kong, Italy, Mozambique, the Philippines,
Poland, and Switzerland (collectively called “IVAWS par-
ticipating countries”). See Killias et al.

it was decided to
over-sample
this ethnic group in order to
capture their experi-
ences. The
ﬁ
nal
ﬁ
gures were re-weighted to re
ﬂ
ect
the overall pro
ﬁ

Table
21.1 provides the pro
ﬁ
le of the respon-
dents in the survey as compared with the female
population aged between 20 and 69 years old in
Singapore given by of
ﬁ
cial sources. It can be seen


332
W.-C. Chan
that the pro
ﬁ
les are not exact matches. This can be
explained on the basis that the respondents sur-
veyed include not only Singapore citizens and
Singapore permanent residents (whose pro
ﬁ
le is
given in the of
ﬁ
cial data) but also foreigners who
have set up a home in Singapore on a temporary
basis such as students, those who are in Singapore
on work contracts, and dependants of foreigners
who are entitled to bring them into Singapore
while they are here on work or study arrange-
ments.
7
The latter groups tend to have a higher
proportion who are younger as well as older per-
sons, be of different ethnic minorities, and have
different housing options as compared to the
Singapore population. These differences are also
re
ﬂ
ected in their monthly household income as
shown below.
8
A decision was taken to include
foreigners who have set up a home in Singapore
as well since they have been included in the
IVAWS conducted in other parts of the world and
there is a need to respond to all those who have
been victimised in Singapore or victimised abroad
but are currently living in
Singapore.


21.3

Preliminary Findings

21.3.1
Lifetime Experience of Violence

The IVAWS asked respondents speci
ﬁ
c questions
about whether they had ever experienced, since
the age of 16 years, 7 types of physical violence
and 5 types of sexual violence used against them
by any man. They are the following:

21.3.1.1
Physical

1.

Threatened with hurt physically

2.
Thrown something or hit with something

3.
Pushed or grabbed, having arm twisted or hair
pulled

4.
Slapped, kicked, bitten, or hit with a
ﬁ
st

5.
Tried to strangle, suffocate, burn, or scald

6.
Used or threatened to use a knife or a gun

7.
Any other physical violence

21.3.1.2
Sexual

1.
Forced into sexual intercourse

2.
Attempted to force into sexual intercourse

3.
Touched sexually

4.
Forced or attempted to force into sexual activ-
ity with someone else

5.
Any other sexual violence

It was found that Singapore had the lowest
rate of lifetime violence victimisation (9.2%) as
compared to the other IVAWS participating
countries (see Fig.
21.1
). Singapore also had the
lowest rate of lifetime physical violence victimi-
sation (6.8%) and the lowest rate of lifetime
sexual violence victimisation (4.2%) as com-
pared to the other IVAWS participating countries
(see Fig.
21.2
).





21.3.2
Experience of Violence
in the Last 12 Months

The respondents in the Singapore survey
reported the second lowest rate of 1-year vio-
lence victimisation (2.6%) as compared to the
other IVAWS participating countries (see
Fig.
21.3
). Singapore, together with Hong Kong,
had the second lowest rate of 1-year physical
violence victimisation (2.1%). Singapore also
had, together with Switzerland, the lowest rate
of 1-year sexual violence victimisation (0.5%)
as compared to the other IVAWS participating
countries (see Fig.
21.4
).



The most common forms of physical violence
were (1) being threatened with hurt physically,
followed by (2) being pushed or grabbed, having
arm twisted or hair pulled; and (3) being slapped,
kicked, bitten, or hit with a
ﬁ
st. The most com-
mon form of sexual violence was non-consensual
sexual contact.
9

7  It was reported that of the total population of Singapore
in 2008 of 4.8 million, only 3.6 million were Singapore
citizens and Singapore permanent residents (Department
of Statistics
2009a
)
.

8  A household refers to persons living together in the same
house and sharing common food or other living arrange-
ments. It includes a person living alone or a person living
with others but having her own food arrangements.

9  Note that some victims may have experienced multiple
types of violence.

21.3.3
Repeat Victimisation

A total of 58.8% of victims experienced repeated
victimisation in Singapore. This comprised
35.7% who experienced violence two to four
times; 9.7% who experienced violence
ﬁ
ve to
nine times; and 13.4% who experienced violence
ten times or more.

Repeated victimisation was higher for those
who experienced physical violence (64.0% of
victims of physical violence experienced repeated
victimisation) as compared to victims of sexual

Respondents Who Experienced
Violence in the Last 12 Months

enced physical or sexual violence in the last
12 months is shown below as compared to

). It can be seen that there is an over-
representation among respondents who experi-
enced violence in the last 12 months of those
who are (1) aged between 30 and 39 years old;
(2) Malays; (3) living in HDB 1 and 2 room

ats;
and (4) those who have university or postgradu-
ate education.

21.3.5
Severity and Perception
of Incident

The respondents were asked to recall the most
recent incident and their responses were categor-
ised according to whether the incident involved a
partner with whom they have (or had) a physi-
cally intimate relationship or not. Such intimate
partners include current or previous husbands
and boyfriends, while non-intimate partners
include strangers, colleagues, friends, and family
members such as a father or uncle.

Different measures were used to determine the
severity of the incident:

1.
Whether the respondent felt that her life was
in danger

2.
Whether the respondent was physically injured

3.
If the respondent was physically injured,
whether she needed medical care (even if she
did not receive it)

4.
Whether the respondent considered the inci-
dent as very serious at the time

5.
Whether the respondent used alcohol and/or
medication to cope

6.
Whether the respondent regarded the incident
as a crime or a wrong

It was found that incidents involving intimate
partner victimisation were invariably considered
to be more serious than non-intimate partner vic-
timisation on the different measurements used.
However, victims of intimate partner violence
were less likely to regard the incident as a crime
or a wrong as compared to victims of non-inti-
mate partner violence (see Table
21.3
).

21.3.6
Involvement of Police and
Assessment of Police Response

While the percentages of those whose victimisa-
tion was reported to the police or other judicial
authorities did not differ much between those
involved in intimate partner and non-intimate part-
ner victimisation (see Table
21.4
), the former were
more likely to be pleased with the way the police
handled the case than the latter (see Table
21.7
).


Where the incident was not reported to the
police, the three most common reasons given by
those in intimate partner and non-intimate part-
ner victimisation were the same: (1) “dealt with it
myself/involved a friend or family member”; (2)
“too minor/not serious enough”; and (3) “did not
want anyone to know” (see Table
21.5
).

But it should be noted that those involved in
intimate partner victimisation were more likely

to give the reason “dealt with it myself/involved a
friend or family member” and “did not want the
offender arrested/in trouble with the police” for
not reporting the incident to the police than those
involved in non-intimate partner victimisation.
On the other hand, those involved in non-intimate
partner victimisation were more likely to give the
reason “did not think police could do anything”
and “did not think the police would do anything”
for not reporting the incident as compared to
those involved in intimate partner victimisation.

If the incident was reported to the police, the
most common form of action taken by the police
in both intimate partner and non-intimate partner
victimisation cases is to “take a report”, but the
police are more likely to “give a warning” in inti-
mate partner victimisation incidents.
11 On the
other hand, the police were more likely to “take a
report” and “do nothing” in cases of non-intimate
partner victimisation (see Table
21.6
).

Criminal charges were slightly more likely to
be brought against the perpetrator in non-intimate
partner incidents than intimate partner incidents
(see Table
21.6
).

Where the incident was reported to the police,
those involved in intimate partner victimisation
were more likely to be satis
ﬁ
ed with the way the
police handled the case than those involved in
non-intimate
partner
victimisation
(see
Table
21.7
). A total of 76% of those involved in
intimate partner victimisation who reported the
incident to the police were “very satis
ﬁ
ed” or
“satis
ﬁ
ed” as compared to 40.9% of those
involved in non-intimate partner victimisation.

Comparison with Previous
Singapore Studies

Several limited scale studies have emerged in
Singapore on female victims of violence. These
give a pro
ﬁ
le of those who had gone to public
hospitals for medical assistance (Seow et al.
1995
;
Lim
2002
; Foo and Seow
2005
)
, to the Family
Court for a protection order (Subordinate Courts
of Singapore
1998

)
, or to a social service agency
for counselling support (Basu
2009
)
. Although
they are limited in scope, it is
nevertheless useful

to compare the results of the present survey with
these earlier studies to note commonalities and
differences.

First, in common with three out of four of the
earlier studies where information on age groups
was available (Subordinate Courts of Singapore

1998
; Lim
2002
; Foo and Seow
2005
)
,
12 the pres-
ent survey also found that the highest proportion
of victims who reported experiencing violence in
the last 12 months came from those who are in
their 30s (47.2%).

Second, in common with three of the four ear-
lier studies where information on educational
attainment was available (Seow et al.
1995
; Foo
and Seow
2005
; Basu
2009
)
,
13 this survey also
found that the highest proportion of victims who
reported experiencing violence in the last 12
months came from those who had secondary
school education (43.4%).
14

Third, the high proportion of victims with

tertiary education who reported experiencing
violence in the last 12 months in this survey
(30.2%) is supported by one of the studies where
this group was also found to be the second high-
est in proportion. That study which looked at the
pro
ﬁ
le of female victims of family violence who
approached a social service agency for counsel-
ling found that 24.9% had tertiary education, as
compared to 48.2% with secondary education
and 15.7% with primary education (Basu
2009
)
.

Fourth, in common with all the four earlier
studies where information on the ethnicity of the
victims was available (Seow et al.
1995
;
Subordinate Courts of Singapore
1998
; Lim

2002
; Foo and Seow
2005
)
, the present survey
also found that the Malays were over-represented
among those who reported experiencing violence
in the last 12 months (18.9%). Malays in the ear-
lier studies ranged between 15.0% (Seow et al.

1995
) and 20.9% (Foo and Seow
2005
)
. The pro-
portion of Malays in Singapore’s resident popu-
lation amounted to 13.6% in 2008 (Ministry of
Community Development, Youth and Sports

2010
) and, as noted above, comprised 12.2% of
Singapore’s female population aged between 18
and 69 years old.

On the other hand, one aspect of inconsis-
tency is that the present survey did not
ﬁ
nd an
over-representation of Indian victims unlike the
four earlier studies which did (Seow et al.
1995
;
Subordinate Courts of Singapore
1998
; Lim

2002
; Foo and Seow
2005
)
. The present survey
found that Indian female victims accounted for
7.5% of those who reported experiencing vio-
lence in the last 12 months. In comparison, the
earlier studies found that Indians comprised
between 15.3% (Lim
2002
) and 28.1% of their
samples (Subordinate Courts of Singapore

1998

)
. The proportion of Indians in Singapore’s
resident population in 2008 amounted to 8.9%
(Ministry of Community Development, Youth
and Sports
2010

)
and 8.4% of Singapore’s
female population aged between 18 and 69
years old.


21.5

Discussion

More data will be forthcoming from the IVAWS
conducted in Singapore when the
ﬁ
nal report is
ready. Until then, some comments may be
made based on the preliminary results pre-
sented here.

21.5.1
Prevalence of Violence and
Repeat Victimisation

It comes as no surprise that Singapore has very
low rates of violence against women amongst all
the IVAWS participating countries. It con
ﬁ
rms

12  But note that the Subordinate Courts of Singapore

(
1998
) study included men who applied for protection
orders as well. In the Seow et al.
(
1995
) study, those who
were in their 30s were the second highest group, compris-
ing 35.6% of the total and those in their 40s accounted for
44.2% of the total.

13  Lim
(
2002
)
’s results are inconsistent with the other stud-
ies in showing a very high proportion of those with no
education (33.3%) and those with primary school educa-
tion (44.4%).

14  It is unclear whether the earlier studies classi
ﬁ
ed those
with GCE A levels and diplomas as having secondary or
tertiary education, but this statement is correct regardless
how they are classi
ﬁ
ed as it will not affect the proportions
substantially.


339
21 Violence Against Women in Singapore…
what is known from rates of reported crime that
Singapore has one of the lowest crime rates in the
world
(
United Nations Of
ﬁ
ce on Drugs and
Crime n.d.

)
. More research of a cross-cultural
nature will be needed to uncover the possible
commonalities shared by Singapore and other
countries with a low rate of violence against
women.

However, the number of victims who experi-
enced multiple victimisations is a source of con-
cern. The rate of repeated victimisation reported
in Switzerland, another country with a very low
rate of violence against women, was 39.4%
(Killias et al.
2004
) as compared to 58.8% in
Singapore. Singapore’s record in encouraging
victims of family violence to come forward has
been dismal. It was found that 90.4% of persons
seeking a protection order were assaulted more
than once before they sought the order from the
Family Court: 23.2% were assaulted twice,
24.5% were assaulted 3 times, 21.8% were
assaulted 4 times, and 20.9% were assaulted 5
or more times (Subordinate Courts of Singapore

1998
)
.
15 In another study, it was reported that
about three-quarters of applicants suffered
physical and non-physical forms of abuse for
more than a year (with more than 20% having
suffered for more than 10 years) before seeking
a protection order (Subordinate Courts of
Singapore
2001
)
.

It will be interesting to see to what extent
repeated victimisation is affected by the relation-
ship between the victim and the offender. It is
likely that repeated victimisation is far more
common among those victims who have or had,
at least temporarily, shared an intimate relation-
ship with the offender which is re
ﬂ
ected in the
data from the Family Court on protection orders
cited above. It is less likely for strangers, and per-
haps for friends and relatives, to have the same
opportunities to commit repeated acts of violence
against the same victim.

21.5.2
Pro
ﬁ
le of Victims Who
Experienced Violence
in the Last 12 Months

Contrary to what has been found in surveys over-
seas (Bachman and Saltzman
1995
; Killias et al.

2004
; Mouzos and Makkai
2004
; Perkins
1997
;
Tjaden and Thoennes
1998,
2000
) where it was
found that younger women were more prone to
victimisation as compared to older women, the
present survey found that more women in their
30s reported to have experienced violence in the
last 12 months than any other group. Further
research on this difference is needed. One possi-
bility is that higher victimisation rates occur
when women are married or when they join the
workforce as compared to when they are in dat-
ing relationships or still in school.

Some studies overseas (Mouzos and Makkai

2004
) have found that women from minority pop-
ulations experienced a higher level of victimisa-
tion. The present survey also found that violence
was over-reported by Malays but this was not true
of Indians in Singapore. Further research will be
needed to con
ﬁ
rm this
ﬁ
nding as well as postulate
why this should be so. The over-representation of
Indians in the previous studies in Singapore (Seow
et al.
1995
; Subordinate Courts of Singapore

1998
; Lim
2002
; Foo and Seow
2005
) suggests
that Indians are more aware of the help services
available and are more willing to seek public
assistance even though their level of victimisation
may not be disproportionate to their numbers.

Further research is also needed to con
ﬁ
rm the

ﬁ
nding that those who have experienced violence
in the last 12 months are over-represented among
those living in 1- and 2-room public housing as
well as those with university education. This
appears inconsistent at
ﬁ
rst sight as it can be
expected that those with higher education will be
more likely to live in better housing. There could
also be differences in these two groups in the type
of violence experienced. Those living in 1- and
2-room public housing may experience more
intimate partner violence whereas those with uni-
versity education could experience more non-
intimate partner violence since they are likely to
spend more time away from the home.

15  These results were con
ﬁ
rmed by a later study which
found that only 11% of cases did not have any history of
past violence when they applied for a protection order
(Subordinate Courts of Singapore
2004
)
.

21.5.3
Severity and Perception
of Incident

In common with many of the IVAWS participat-
ing countries (Johnson et al.
2008
)
, it was also
found in Singapore that although violence
in
ﬂ
icted by an intimate partner was more serious
and, in more than four in ten of the cases, life-
threatening, fewer considered it to be a crime or
a wrong than those involved in non-intimate
partner victimisation who may have less serious
injuries. This shows that many women may still
perceive violence committed by an intimate part-
ner as a “family” or a “private” matter, leading
them to endure serious injury for many years.
This is supported by the
ﬁ
nding in the survey
that the most common reasons why victimisation
by an intimate partner was not reported are the
following: (1) “dealt with it myself/involved a
friend or family member”, (2) “too minor/not
serious enough”, and (3) “did not want anyone to
know”. These were also the common reasons
reported by other IVAWS participating countries
(Johnson et al.
2008
)
.

Among the IVAWS participating countries, it
was also found that even though a woman may
perceive the incident as “serious” or a “crime”, it
was not always followed by a decision to report it
to the police. Many other factors may in
ﬂ
uence
the decision whether to report the incident to the
police or not, including the availability of other
resources to help her cope with the situation.

Education to improve awareness of the unac-
ceptability of violence regardless of the relation-
ship between victims and offenders must be
reinforced, as well as enhancement of the crimi-
nal justice system’s ability to provide an effective
response to the wish of victims which may often
be to stop the violence without necessarily hav-
ing the offender arrested or punished.

21.5.4
Involvement of Police and
Assessment of Police Response

The reporting behaviour of those who were vic-
timised by intimate partners and non-intimate
partners is similar. This is similar to the
behaviour
reported in other IVAWS participating
countries
(the Czech Republic, Denmark, Hong Kong, and
the Philippines) where less than a quarter of vic-
timisations were reported to the police (Johnson
et al.
2008
)
.

Where the incident was reported to the police,
it was found in the present survey that those who
were victimised by an intimate partner are more
likely to be satis
ﬁ
ed with the way the police han-
dled the case. This may appear at
ﬁ
rst sight as
inconsistent since those who were victimised by
intimate partners were more likely not to regard
the incident as a crime or a wrong. A possible
explanation to the survey result is that those who
have been victimised by an intimate partner had
to overcome social conditioning that the incident
is “private” or that it is “shameful” to tell on a
loved one, but once that is done, the victim is
relieved that she did so, even though the most
common response given may be, in general, inef-
fective ones such as “taking a report”, “giving a
warning”, or “suggesting services”. Since vio-
lence committed by an intimate partner is often
downplayed in society, the satisfactory rating for
the police is also not affected by the small num-
ber of offenders who had criminal charges
brought against them. Such victims may be of the
view, rightly or wrongly, that there is very little
that can be done in their case. What may be most
important to them is that they were listened to,
taken seriously, cared for, and supported, but not
necessarily having the offender arrested or pun-
ished (Fleury
2002
; Johnson
2006
)
.

On the other hand, those who have been vic-
timised by non-intimate partners may feel more
indignant at their violation or fearful of a repeat
incident, and expect the police to be more active
in their intervention—even though this may not
be always possible if the incident was committed
by a stranger who cannot be properly identi
ﬁ
ed
subsequently. Further research will be needed to
examine the extent to which the objectives of the
female victims and the police can, and should, be
aligned together.

More women being satis
ﬁ
ed with the police in
situations of intimate partner violence than for non-
intimate partner violence was also found in 3 of the
IVAWS participating countries: Mozambique, the


341
21 Violence Against Women in Singapore…
Philippines, and Poland (Johnson et al.
2008
)
. It
should also be noted that positive attitudes towards
the police do not necessarily translate to a sense of
satisfaction with the criminal justice system in
general (Johnson et al.
2008
)
.


21.6

Conclusion

More research, both qualitative and quantitative,
on the issue of violence against women in
Singapore is needed in order to
ﬁ
ll the gaps in
what we know about it as well as formulate
effective strategies to tackle this problem.
Although this survey, like other surveys of this
nature, may be criticised in that it may be inac-
curate owing to under-reporting and wrong
information being given by respondents, it is
nevertheless a
ﬁ
rst attempt at giving a systematic
view of the issue in Singapore through a large-
scale victim survey. It is hoped that the present
survey, with a fuller report to follow soon, will
go towards a better understanding of the issue
and aid policy formulation to eradicate violence
against women and promote gender equality in
Singapore.

22.1

Introduction

Victimology as a new area in criminology
emerged in the 1970s but interest in crime vic-
tims is by no means new (McShane and Williams

1992
)
. In 1970 victimization
ﬁ
rst time became a
research topic of criminologists in Taiwan.
However, “the victimization issue in Taiwan
seems to be underdiscussed and investigated”
(Kuo et al.
2009
, p. 461). To shed some light on
this issue, this chapter briefs the background of
victimology as well as looks at the development
of victimization and movement of victims’ right
in Taiwan by reviewing related literatures and
statistics. In the section of background, a brief
history of conceptual framework of victimology
is reviewed, practical and theoretical issues in the
relationship to the formal criminal justice system
are discussed, and the potential and limitations of
“alternatives” to criminal justice are also
addressed. The main focus of this chapter con-
sists of four angles in Taiwan: unfolding the role
of victim surveys in generating criminological
interest in victims, describing the nature and
scope of victimization, tracing the role of victim
movements, and identifying changing service
and procedural rights for victim. The nature and
scope of victimization in Taiwan is presented in
three features, including individual, household,
and commercial. The changing service and pro-
cedural rights for victim are illustrated from three
prospects: victim compensation, victim advocate,
and victim right. The content of main focus of
this chapter led to the discussions of two future
trends: victimization of new residents in Taiwan
and a tertiary crime victim caused by using CCTV
as a self-protection measure. Finally, this chapter
concludes that many criminologists in Taiwan
have dedicated them to the new area of victimol-
ogy and the victims’ right in Taiwan seems con-
siderably improving after the enactment of the
Crime Victim Protection Act in 1998.

22.2

Background

22.2.1
A Brief History of the Principles
and Conceptual Framework

The concept of victim dates back to prehistoric
cultures such as the ancient Hebrews (Huang and
Zhang
2011
, p. 2). The original meaning of vic-
tim was rooted in the idea of sacri
ﬁ
ce (Genesis
31:54) or scapegoat (Leviticus, 16:8) (New
American Standard Bible
1997
)
. Over the centu-
ries, the word victim came to have additional
meanings. Today, the concept of victim includes
any person who experiences injury, loss, or hard-
ship due to any cause; and crime is one of the
causes (Fattah
1991
)
. In this chapter, the focus is
on crime victims.

Victims of Crime in Taiwan

H.M. Wang

The term “crime victims” generally refers to
any person, group, or entity who has suffered
injury or loss due to illegal activity. The harm can
be physical, psychological, or economic (Karmen

2007
)
. The individuals to whom the offense actu-
ally occurred are called “primary crime victims.”
However, crime victimization is not limited to the
primary victim. Secondary crime victims are
those who experience the harm second hand,
such as intimate partners of rape victims or chil-
dren of a battered woman (Karmen
2007
)
. Besides
“secondary crime victims,” there are also “ter-
tiary crime victims” who experience the harm
vicariously (Sessar
1990
)
. In a case that A kills
B, for example, B is the primary victim while his
family dependants are secondary crime victims.
Supposed B is a project manager of a software
company; his boss is the tertiary crime victim for
losing the contract due to the sudden death of B.

From criminological perspective, the above
statement presents a broad view of crime victims.
In line with criminal law, a victim of crime is an
identi
ﬁ
able person who has been harmed indi-
vidually and directly by the perpetrator, rather
than by society as a whole. However, this legal
de
ﬁ
nition is system-oriented and has its restric-
tion (McShane and Williams
1992
)
. For example,
Croall
(
2001
) argued that the system-oriented
de
ﬁ
nition may ignore or even de
ﬂ
ect attention
from white-collar crime victims whom may not
be clearly identi
ﬁ
able or directly linked to crime
against a particular individual. In this chapter, the
broad view of crime victims is applied.

The process of becoming a victim refers to
“victimization,” and the scienti
ﬁ
c study of vic-
timization is named “victimology” (Karmen

2007
)
. The term “victimology” was coined by
Benjamin Mendelsohn in 1947 (Huang and
Zhang
2011
)
. Although its roots can be traced to
a number of earlier works on crime victims in the
1940s, victimology emerged as a recognized spe-
cialization within criminology in the early 1970s
(McShane and Williams
1992
; Miethe and Meier

1994

)
. In the past, criminology was primarily
focused on the offender; victimology shifted the
interest to the victim of crime (Schneider
2001a
)
.
Victimology encompasses not only the study of
victimization but also victim–offender relation-
ships, victim–criminal justice relationships,

victims and the cost of crime, victims and the
media, as well as victims and social movements
(Karmen
2007
)
.

Scholars who dedicate themselves to advance
the knowledge of victimology are called “vic-
timologists.” Because of
ﬁ
cial data usually cannot
present a whole picture of crime, victimologists
often use surveys of large number of people about
the crimes that have been committed against
them. Several large-scale victimization surveys
have been conducted in various countries, such as
the National Crime Victimization Survey
(NCVS)
1 in the United States and the British
Crime Survey (BCS)
2 in the United Kingdom
(Max
ﬁ
eld and Babbie
2009
)
. Today, most vic-
timologists are engaging in at least one of the fol-
lowing activities (Huang and Zhang
2011
)
:

• De
ﬁ
ne the problem
: Find the asymmetry of
power, analyze responsibility, explore the
kinds of harm.

• Measure true dimension of the problem
:
Analyze statistics, see what kind of people are
involved, accurately gauge the extent of harm.


• Investigate how criminal justice system han-
dles the problem
: Look at what criminal
justice system ignores, ask what victim wants,
analyze effects, chronicle emergence of vic-
tim’s movement.

• Examine societal response to problem
: Look
at issues of constitutional rights, analyze pro-
posed legislation, analyze media reaction, see
if anyone is cashing in on the problem.

The studies of victimization in Taiwan can
be traced to 1970 (Huang and Zhang
2011
)
.
The
ﬁ
rst national criminal victimization survey

1  The NCVS, administered by the US Bureau of Justice
Statistics, is a national survey of approximately 77,400
households twice a year in the United States. The survey
focuses on gathering information on the offenses assault,
burglary, larceny, motor vehicle theft, rape, and robbery as
well as characteristics and consequences of victimization.

2  The BCS, presently carried out by BMRB Limited on
behalf of the Home Of
ﬁ
ce, seeks to measure the amount
of crime in England and Wales by asking around 50,000
people aged 16 and over (as of January 2009), living in
private households, about the crimes they have experi-
enced in the last year.


345
22 Victims of Crime in Taiwan
in Taiwan was undertaken in 2000. However,
“the victimization issue in Taiwan seems to be
underdiscussed and investigated” (Kuo et al.

2009

)
. The development of victimology and
victims’ rights movement is addressed in this
chapter.


22.2.2
Practical and Theoretical Issues
in the Relationship to the Formal
Criminal Justice System

The concept of “criminal justice” was
ﬁ
rst
coined by Jerome Michael and Mortimer Adler
in 1932 (Laub and Edwin
2006
)
. In a report
titled “the challenge of crime in a free society,”
the President’s Commission on Law Enforcement
and Administration of Justice created the term
“criminal justice system” and advocated a

“systems” approach to criminal justice, with
improved coordination among law enforcement,
courts, and correctional agencies (Walker
1992
)
.
Traditionally, criminologists look into crimes
from the perspective of criminals. However,
Hans von Hentig argued that “the study of crime
is not complete unless the victim’s role is con-
sidered” (Siegel
2009
, p. 15). The argument of
von Hentig highlights the importance of the
relationship between crime victims and criminal
justice system.

The police are the starting point of the crimi-
nal justice system to most crime victims. It is
necessary to know why many victims do not
report crimes to the police. In addition to that, the
criminal justice system usually focuses on the
individual to whom the offense actually occurred
(Karmen
2007
)
. However, crime victimization is
not limited to the primary victim. Secondary vic-
tims are usually being ignored by the criminal
justice system. The psychological effect of crimi-
nal victimization is another practical issue being
ignored by the criminal justice system. The psy-
chological effect can be nonexistent to extreme,
and can range from short to long term (Wallace

1998
)
, depending on the type of victimization,
amount of loss incurred, and trauma suffered.
Additionally, both primary and secondary
victims
are equally likely to suffer from psychological
disruptions (Schneider
2001b
)
. When more
intense psychological reactions occur the most
common include “fear, resentment, anger against
offender and CJ system, and humiliation”
(Williams
1999
, p. 51). In Taiwan few prior
research projects have examined those practical
issues; this chapter brie
ﬂ
y reviews related
ﬁ
ndings
in the following sections.

The victim precipitation theory, an earlier
explanation of victimization in the context of
research on homicidal criminality, postulated that
some victims may “contribute” to their own vic-
timizations (Wolfgang
1958
)
. Siegel
(
2009
)
pointed out two types of precipitations: active
and passive. “Active precipitation occurs when
victims act provocatively, use threats or
ﬁ
ghting
words, or even attack
ﬁ
rst,” whereas “passive
precipitation occurs when the victim exhibits
some personal characteristic that unknowingly
either threatens or encourages the attacker”
(Siegel
2009
, p. 73). Over the years, the victim
precipitation theory has been perceived as a nega-
tive connotation against victims and victim advo-
cates, whereas routine activities theory and
lifestyle theory were shaped and substantially
tested (Schneider
2001a
)
.

Routine activities theory, developed by Cohen
and Felson
(

1979

)
, maintained that crime occurs
whenever three conditions come together: suit-
able targets, motivated offenders, and absence of
guardians. This theory assumed that motivated
offenders always existed and were waiting for an
appropriate time, place, and target; therefore,
“engagement in activities in non-household set-
tings elevated the likelihood of becoming a vic-
tim” (Kuo et al.
2009
, p. 462). Lifestyle theory
claimed that “crime is not a random occurrence
but rather a function of the victim’s lifestyle”
(Siegel
2009
, p. 73). For example, college stu-
dents who frequently joined parties and took rec-
reational drugs were much more likely to be
violent crime victims than those who avoid
such risky academic lifestyle (Fisher et al.
1998
)
.
A number of empirical studies tested these two
theories in Taiwan, which are also reviewed in
this chapter.

22.2.3
The Potential and Limitations of
“Alternatives” to Criminal Justice

As victimology advanced and matured, the
public were more aware of victim’s rights in the
past decades. As a result in addition to victim
compensation, many victims’ crusading groups
had emerged to focus on speci
ﬁ
c needs of differ-
ent offenses, such as drunken driving, missing
children, and rape (McShane and Williams
1992
)
.
In the United States, victim-oriented crime poli-
cies had made large progress. Schneider
(
2001b
,
p. 548) summarized eight federal laws to illus-
trate this achievement as below:

The 1982 Victim and Witness Protection Act
•
improves victims’ rights and services.

The 1984 Victims of Crime Act provides sub-
•
stantial
ﬁ
nancial funds for victim assistance
and treatment programs. It supports the estab-
lishment of interdisciplinary victimological
institutes of teaching and the publication of
victimological literature.


The 1986 Children’s Justice and Assistance Act
•
reforms the handling of cases of child abuse
and reduces the effect of the traumatic experi-
ences that children undergo during their partici-
pation in the criminal justice proceedings.


The 1990 Victims’ Rights and Restitution Act
•
endows the victim with the right of restitution.
This act entitles the victim to be treated with
fairness and due respect for his or her dignity
and sphere of privacy.

The 1990 Victims of Child Abuse Act supple-
•
ments the reform of the treatment of child victims
and witnesses in the federal judicial system.


The 1994 Violent Crime Control and Law
•
Enforcement Act grants the victims of violent
and sexually motivated crimes a right of par-
ticipation in the criminal proceedings. It guar-
antees the victims’ restitution and intensi
ﬁ
es
the punishment for crimes of violence against
women and elderly persons.

In 1996, the Megan’s Law amendment to the
•
Jacob Wetterling Crimes against Children and
Sexual Violent Offender Act was enacted to
help ensure that communities are noti
ﬁ
ed of the
release and location of convicted sex offenders.

In 1997, Congress passed the Victim’s Rights
•
Clari
ﬁ
cation Act, asserting that victims should
have the right to both attend proceedings and
deliver or submit a victim impact statement.

However, this achievement still has its limita-
tions due to the fact of middle-class symbolism.
McShane and Williams
(
1992
) distinguished two
perspectives of crime victim de
ﬁ
nition: static and
dynamic. The static perspective presents the mid-
dle-class symbolism and views the victim and
offender as “part of a strict dichotomy, a mutually
exclusive set of categories. The offender cannot
be viewed as victim, nor can the victim be viewed
as offender” (McShane and Williams
1992
,
p. 261). The dynamic perspective suggests that
“at least some offenders and victims can be
thought of as participants in a dynamic, ongoing
interaction. At any point, participants can be
called the victim or the offender, depending on
the stage of the interaction” (McShane and
Williams
1992
, p. 261). McShane and Williams

(
1992
) argued that the static perspective is domi-
nant among the public and the media for the pur-
pose of social order maintenance. They suggested
victimology to undertake the dynamic view; oth-
erwise victimology remains “a pawn of the state
and political process” (McShane and Williams

1992
, p. 269).

22.3

Main Focus of the Chapter

22.3.1
The Role of Victim Surveys
in Generating Criminological
Interest in Victims

The crime victimization survey in Taiwan can be
traced back to a research project undertaken by
Professor Chuen-Jim Sheu
(
1994
)
. This project,
contracted by Kaohsiung City Police Bureau,
investigated 2,416 people from Kaohsiung City
and other six counties in Taiwan about their expe-
riences of victimization. Because of the limited
size of samples and the method of non-probabil-
ity sampling used, the results of this pioneer work
are very dif
ﬁ
cult to be used for inferential statis-
tics (Huang
2006
)
.

The
ﬁ
rst nationwide crime victimization sur-
vey in Taiwan was conducted by Sheu and his
associates in 2000 (Kuo et al.
2009
)
. This survey
was initiated by the National Police Agency


347
22 Victims of Crime in Taiwan
(NPA) as a response to a newly enacted law for
strengthening the crime victims’ protection.
However, there are certain limitations of the 2000
victim survey. For example, it cannot estimate
the “dark
ﬁ
gure” and has no capacity for com-
prehending repeat victimization (Huang
2006
)
.
Therefore, a second wave of nationwide crime
victim survey was conducted by the same NTPU
research team in 2005.

The 2005 survey had used two methods of
gathering information—telephone survey and in-
person interview. The telephone survey is used for
understanding the prevalence of crime and “dark

ﬁ
gures,” while in-person interview is used for
understanding the victims’ reaction to police case
processing and citizens’ request (Huang
2006
)
.

The third wave of crime victim survey in
Taiwan was undertaken in 2010. Research team
used the method of Computer-Assisted Telephone
Interview (CATI) for gathering victimization
information in 2009 but seek to represent the
nationwide population of persons aged 12 living
in household. A sample size of 16,015 was
obtained by using strati
ﬁ
ed sampling over the 20
counties/cities in Taiwan. Among the persons
experiencing victimization in 2009, research
team used multistage cluster sampling (i.e., theft,
motorcycle theft, auto theft, fraud, robbery, and
snatch) to obtain 1,800 samples for in-person
interview (Sheu et al.
2011
)
.

In addition to these three waves of crime

victimization survey undertaken by Sheu and
associates, the Crime Research Center of the
National Chung-Cheng University (CRC-NCCU)
also conducted biannually nationwide survey in
2009, 2010, and 2011. The CRC-NCCU success-
fully obtained a sample of 2000 in each wave of
the phone survey by randomly selecting persons
aged 20 living in households in Taiwan (CRC-
NCCU
2011
)
.

22.3.2
The Nature and Scope
of Victimization in Taiwan

22.3.2.1
Individual Victimization

The 2010 Taiwan Areas Criminal Victimization
Survey (TACVS) examined individual victimiza-
tion of larceny, assault, robbery, and snatch
3

happened in Taiwan in 2009 (National Taipei
University
2010
)
. The 2010 TACVS indicated
that larceny is the most prevalent offense
(10.43%), followed by assault (0.59%), snatch
(0.42%), and robbery (0.04%). The robbery vic-
tims are most likely to report their victimizations
to police (42.86%), followed by snatch (37.33%),
assault (29.11%), and larceny (18.36%) victims.
In other words, individuals in Taiwan are most
likely become crime victims of larceny but are
least likely to report this kind of crime to
police.
The main reason why victims do not report indi-
vidual victimizations to the police is “too petty to
report” (55.35%), followed by that “it won’t do
anything good” (27.63%). The average loss of
larceny, robbery, and snatch was $173,
4 $379,
and $255, respectively (National Taipei University

2010
)
.
5 According to the R.O.C. (Taiwan)
National Statistics, the 2009 GDP in Taiwan was
US$16,359 (National Statistics
2011a
). This

ﬁ
gure is about one-third of that of the United
States in the same year. However, given the facts
of relatively low living expenses ($6,548 per
person) and high savings ($1,919 per person) in
Taiwan, damages ranged between $173 and $379
perhaps are still bearable for most Taiwanese
(National Statistics
2011a
).

The
ﬁ
ndings of 2010 TACVS were partially con-
sistent with the CRC-NCCU crime victimization
survey in the same time period.
6 According to the

3  According to the Glossary in the 2010 TACVS Report
(National Taipei University
2010
, p. 181), these four
offenses were de
ﬁ
ned as below:

Larceny: Taking property away from persons without
•
their awareness, including bicycle thefts, items taken
away from vehicles and motorcycles, but excluding
motor vehicle thefts, motorcycle thefts, and taking
property from residences.

Assault: An unlawful injury of other person’s body or
•
health.

Robbery: Offenses where valuables were taken from
•
persons by force, threat of force, drug, or hypnosis.

Snatch: Offenses where valuables were taken from per-
•
sons in surprise but not by force.

4  The average exchange rate between the US dollar and
TW dollar was 1:33 in 2009. Hereafter, all monetary unit
is noted in the US dollar.

5  The monetary damage of assault was not inquired in the
2010 TACVS (National Taipei University
2010
, p. 24).


348
H.M. Wang
CRC-NCCU crime victimization survey, 11.3% of
respondents indicated being victimized in larceny
with an average loss of $2,485 in the
ﬁ
rst half year
of 2009. In the second half year of 2009, 16.8% of
respondents indicated being victimized in larceny
with an average loss of $3,327. Comparatively, the
prevalence of larceny between these two nation-
wide crime victimization surveys in Taiwan is
about the same. The results are also consistent with
that of National Crime Victimization Survey in the
United States. According to Klaus
(
2004
)
, theft
(10%) was the most frequently reported crime in the
year 2002. However, the damage
ﬁ
gure of CRC-
NCCU is much higher than that of TACVS. A pos-
sible reason is that the unit of analysis of
CRC-NCCU is all individuals in a speci
ﬁ
c house-
hold, while that of the TACVS is individuals.

It is worth to note that about 40% of victims of
CRC-NCCU chose not to report crimes to the police
for the reason that “it won’t do anything good.” The
CRC-NCCU further provided estimation of total
loss of larceny in Taiwan in 2009. There were
7,720,983 households in Taiwan in June 2009
(National Statistics
2011b
). It is estimated that in
the
ﬁ
rst half year of 2009 the total damage for lar-
ceny was $2.17 billion. There were 7,805,834
households in Taiwan in December 2009
(National Statistics
2011b
). It is estimated that in
the second half year of 2009 the total damage for
larceny was $2.74 billion.

Prior research suggested that demographic
characteristics distinguish victims and non-vic-
tims. The 2010 TACVS presented a general pic-
ture of individual victim, including gender, age,
education, marriage status, and nighttime activity
(National Taipei University
2010
)
.

Gender

Males are more likely than females to be the vic-
tims of larceny (54.27%) and assault (63.53%)
but not snatch (44.06%).

Age

Adults (30–54 years old) are more likely than
other age groups to be the victims of larceny
(54.62%), assault (48.57%), and snatch (42.67%).
However, the proportion of young adults and
youths being victims of snatch (42.15%) is very
close to that of adults.

Education

People with higher education level (high school
and above) are more likely than their lower edu-
cation counterparts (middle school and below)
7
to be the victims of larceny (78.24%), assault
(71.51), and assault
(70.82%).

Marriage Status

Married or cohabited people are more likely than
their not married counterparts (never married,
widowed, separated, or divorced) to be the vic-
tims of larceny (57.09), assault (50.73%), and
assault
(50.54%).

Nighttime Activity

People engaged in nighttime activities (going out
twice and above per week) are more likely to be
the victims of larceny (63.27%), assault (59.87%),
and snatch (56.34%).

22.3.2.2
Household Victimization

The 2010 TACVS also examined household vic-
timization of residence larceny, motorcycle theft,
motor vehicle theft, and fraud happened in 2009
(National Taipei University
2010
)
. The phone
survey results indicated that residence larceny is
the most prevalent offense (3.72%), followed by
motorcycle theft (2.16%), fraud (1.57%), and
motor vehicle theft (.78%). The motor vehicle
theft victims are most likely to report crimes to
police (97.14%), followed by motorcycle theft
(90.26%), fraud (54.17%), and residence larceny
(41.49%) victims. In other words, residence lar-
cenies are most likely to happen in Taiwan but
victims are least likely to report this kind of
crimes to police. The main reason why people do

6  The CRC-NCCU conducted biannual crime victimiza-
tion surveys in July 2009 and January 2010. The survey in
July 2009 examined the victimization in the
ﬁ
rst half year
of 2009, while the survey in January 2010 investigated the
victimization in the second half year of 2009.

7  Taiwan put 9-year compulsory education into practice in
1968. Since then, each student is required to complete at
least middle school education (7–9 grades).


349
22 Victims of Crime in Taiwan
not report household victimizations to the police
is “too petty to report” (49.22%), followed by
that “it won’t do anything good” (25.21%). The
average loss of residence larceny was $1,470
(National Taipei University
2010
)
.

The 2010 TACVS did not present the average
loss of fraud but indicated that about 65% of
respondents were victims of fraud with no loss
and only 1.1% of respondents were victims of
fraud with loss. On the other hand, the CRC-
NCCU crime victimization survey showed that
4.1% of respondents were victims of fraud with
an average loss of $8,576 in the
ﬁ
rst half year of
2009, and 3.5% of respondents were victims of
fraud with an average loss of $6,848 in the sec-
ond half year of 2009. It is estimated that the total
damages for fraud in Taiwan in the
ﬁ
rst and sec-
ond half year of 2009 were $2.71 billion and $1.8
billion, respectively.

22.3.2.3
Commercial Victimization

In Taiwan, most research projects in victimiza-
tion focus on individuals or households instead of
business (Mong
2006
)
. Dr. Weide Mong, a pro-
fessor of the Central Police University, conducted
a research about the perception of commercial
victimization in Taiwan in 2005. He surveyed
242 security managers of 242 large retail stores
in Taiwan (one manager from each store) and 165
police chief or deputy chief from 165 police sub-
stations which have at least one retail store located
in their jurisdiction (one chief or deputy chief
from each substation) about their perceptions of
crime victimization happened in the business
venue in the past 6 months.

Mong’s
ﬁ
ndings presented in six directions:
general pro
ﬁ
le, amount of loss, crime reports,
interactions between retails and police, risk per-
ception, and security management. Both security
managers and police of
ﬁ
cers agreed that the most
common offenses happened in the business site
are shoplifting and cars/scooters (a very popular
vehicle in Taiwan) theft, and that consumers are
more likely to be the suspects, comparing to store
employees. On average, 1–5 cases happened per
month. In terms of amount of loss, security man-
gers and police of
ﬁ
cers disagreed with each other.
Security managers believed that the minimum
loss of each case is less than $3.3, while police
of
ﬁ
cers maintained that the minimum loss ranged
between $3.4 and $100. The possible reason for
this difference is that the cases that involved small
amount of loss were not being reported to the

police (Mong
2006
)
.

When a case was reported to the police, most
police of
ﬁ
cers believed that they will be at the
site within 5 min whereas most security mangers
perceived more than 5 min of police’s arrival. In
addition to this disagreement, more than 75% of
police of
ﬁ
cers believed that most reported cases
were cleared while only 42% of security mangers
had the same perception. Furthermore, most
police of
ﬁ
cers perceived a good interaction
between their substations and retail stores in their
beats but less security mangers maintained the
same perception as that of police. Mong
(
2006
)
asserted that the interaction between police and
retails should be strengthened. In the regard of
security management, most retail stores perceived
themselves in good conditions with quali
ﬁ
ed per-
sonnel but police saw the other way around.

22.3.2.4
The Impact of Victimization

The research indicated that being the victim of
predatory crime (e.g., rape, robbery, or assault)
has a terrible burden that can have considerable
long-term consequences. The costs of victimiza-
tion not only include physical injuries, property
loses, and psychological trauma but also the
involvement of the police and other agencies of
the justice system (Huang and Zhang
2011
)
. Fear
of crime is the most signi
ﬁ
cant impact of victim-
ization indicated by prior research (Siegel
2009
)
.

Prior research projects on fear of crime focused
on four core factors: demographics, experience
of victimization, social disorganizations, and
police performance (Sheu et al.
2011
)
. It was
found that females (Box et al.
1988
)
, elders
(Acierno et al.
2004
)
, and people with victimiza-
tion experiences (Skogan and Max
ﬁ
eld
1981
)
and perception of social disorganization (Gibson
et al.
2002
) were more likely to fear of crime.

As for police performance, most previous
studies found that a better police performance
can decrease citizens’ fear of crime (Dietz
1997
)
.
In sum, the studies in the Western societies


350
H.M. Wang

indicated that many people fear crime, especially
females, elders, and persons with victimization
experience and perception of social disorganiza-
tion. It is worthy to know to what extent this

ﬁ
nding is true in Taiwan.

Dr. Xie Jinqi, a social psychology professor at
the Shih-Hsin University in Taipei, did an explor-
atory study about fear of crime in Taiwan. She sur-
veyed 1,000 people who ranged from 10 to 86 years
old. She found a reverse liner relationship between
age and fear of crime. Different from the
ﬁ
nding of
Acierno et al.
(
2004
)
, Xie
(
2005
) found that the
older the age, the less the fear of crime. When the
gender is taken into consideration, the reverse liner
relationship is still true in general for females but
not males. The men in the groups of young adults
(19–34 years old) and adults (35–54 years old)
fear more being victimized of car/scooter theft
when compared to the groups of youths (10–
18 years old) and seniors (55–84 years old).

On the other hand, the seniors and youths fear
more to take taxies alone in the evening. Xie

(
2005
) pointed out that this phenomenon could
be caused by the fact that young adults and adults
in Taiwan are more likely to have cars and/or
scooters for their daily transpirations, while
youths and seniors are more likely to rely on the
public transportations or taxies. In addition to
that, almost all age groups across gender (except
female and male youth as well as male young
adult) fear most being kidnapped.

Xie
(
2005
) urged that a speci
ﬁ
c historical
event may threat the validity of this
ﬁ
nding.
During the time period of Xie’s survey, a hideous
case of abduction and murder happened in Taiwan
in 1997. The victim named Hsiao-Yen Pai (Hanyu
Pinyin: Bái Xiăoyàn) was missing after leaving
for her school in the morning of April 14, 1997.
Her family received ransom request of $5,000,000
along with a severed piece of her little
ﬁ
nger and
a photograph of a half-naked girl bound with
tape. Pai’s deformed body was found in a drain-
age ditch on April 25, 1997. It was perhaps
because the victim’s mother Pai Ping-ping was a
popular Taiwanese TV host and actress in Taiwan,
the press paid a lot of attentions on this case. The
detail reports about suspects’ violent behaviors
indeed terri
ﬁ
ed many Taiwanese at that time.

Sheu et al.
(
2011
) used the data set of 2011
TACVS to examine the issue of fear of crime in
Taiwan in a more comprehensive way. The major

ﬁ
ndings are summarized as below:

Most people (71.5%) in Taiwan are worried
•
about being crime victims.

Females, middle-aged (40–49 years old), and
•
married/cohabitated people are more likely to
fear of crime.

Persons who experienced victimization of lar-
•
ceny, assault, snatch, residence larceny, motor-
cycle theft, and fraud are more likely to fear of
crime. Among these offences, assault and snatch
have most serious impacts on fear of crime.


Social disorganizations index (e.g., youths
•
wandering on streets,
ﬁ
ghting, and existence
of arcade in the neighborhood) is signi
ﬁ
cantly
related to fear of crime. The more perception
of social disorders, the more fear of crime.

Police of
ﬁ
cers’ attitude toward the victims is
•
signi
ﬁ
cantly related to fear of crime. The more
ofﬁ
cers were able to patiently listening
victims’
statements and more ef
ﬁ
ciently
handle the
case, the less fear of


crime.


To sum up, fear of crime commonly exists in
the society of Taiwan. Females, middle-aged
people, and those with experienced victimization
and perception of social disorders are more likely
to fear of crime. However, the quality of police
service can ease the fear of crime. The last
ﬁ
nding
implicates that the police administration should
not only promote the crime prevention measures
(e.g., installation of CCTV, branding ID on vehi-
cles, and 165 antifraud hotlines) but also educate
of
ﬁ
cers in upgrading their services, especially
receiving reports from crime victims.

22.3.3
Tracing the Role of Victim
Movements in Taiwan

The victimization
ﬁ
rst time becoming a research
topic in the context of criminology in Taiwan
was in 1970. In the same year, the victimology
was taught when the Central Police University
(CPU) in Taiwan established a section of crime
prevention in the policing graduate program
(Huang and Zhang
2011
)
.

22 Victims of Crime in Taiwan

In the late 1970s and early 1980s, a demo-
cratic movement was emerging in Taiwan where
many grassroot foundations were created for pro-
moting human rights, including crime victims’
rights. For example, Modern Women’s Foundation

(MWF) was formally incepted in Taipei in 1987.
The primary objective of MWF is to assist mod-
ern women in seeking a balance role in the fast-
changing society where modern and traditional
value coexists in Taiwan. In the process, the
MWF discovers that the basic personal safety of
women has never had the attention it deserves.
Consequently, as early as in 1988, the MWF set
up a women protection center, offering profes-
sional information as well as legal and medical
services to female victims. The MWF further
translates its services into a professional network
for female victims of domestic violence, sexual
abuse, or sexual harassment.

The Republic of China Association of
Vehicle Victim Rescue (AVVR), another exam-
ple of grassroot organization for victims’ rights
in Taiwan, was created in 1988. At that time, it
had no mandatory auto insurance in Taiwan. In
other words, the victims of auto incidents often
faced no compensations from the offenders.
Hence, the main purpose of creating AVVR
was helping the victims of auto incidents to
obtain fair opportunities on trials and to claim
reasonable civil compensations from the
offenders. The AVVR changed its name to the
Association of Auto Incidents Concerns after
the mandatory auto and motorcycle insurance
law was enacted in 1998 (Wu
2000
)
. As of
today, the minimum coverage for a death in the
car accident is up to $50,000.

The victim rights movement in the 1980s
inevitably pushed the Ministry of Justice (MOJ)
in Taiwan to promote the legislation for crime
victims’ protection and compensation in 1993,
and the Crime Victim Protection Act (CVPA)
was
ﬁ
nally enacted in 1998. Before the 1998
CVPA’s enactment, there was an extensive debate
about the scope of victims’ compensation.

In terms of state responsibility and the consid-
eration of government budget, there are four

different perspectives: state responsibility, social
welfare, life protection, and risk dispersion.
The state responsibility perspective maintains
that the state has the responsibility to protect citi-
zens’ life and properties according to social con-
tract. When citizen’s life and/or property were
being damaged because of crime, the government
has the obligation to compensate citizens’ dam-
ages. The social welfare perspective sustains that
the people of disadvantage groups are more likely
to be victimized according to crime data. The
state has obligations to protect disadvantage peo-
ple and provide necessary compensations when
they are being victimized. The life protection
perspective upholds that the state has obligations
to relieve people in miserable situations. Hence,
only people in miserable situation because of vic-
timization are entitled to compensation from the
government. The risk dispersion perspective,
derived from insurance theory, argues that there
is a risk for each person to being victimized.
Hence, every citizen should share the damages to
victims (see Hsu
2005
)
.

Initially, the life protection prevailed in the con-
sideration of governmental budget.
8
The draft of
CVPA stated that only the victims in miserable
life, when the offenders either cannot be identi
ﬁ
ed
or have no capacity for compensation, are entitled
to request the government to support their life
(Jiang
1998

)
. The Legislation Yuan (the highest
legislation branch in Taiwan) asserted that it is not
reasonable to ask the victims to locate offenders
and to prove that offenders have no capacity to
provide compensation hence revised the draft



accordingly. However, not all crime victims are
entitled to request compensation in the consider-
ation of government budget. The Article
ﬁ
ve of
1998 CVPA spells that only the severely injured
victims and dead victims’ family members are
entitled to request compensations from the gov-
ernment when the injury and death were caused by
crimes de
ﬁ
ned by ROC Penal Code. The compen-
sation for medical expense is up to NT$400,000,

8  As of 2011, the debt of Republic of China (Taiwan) is
estimated as NT$4,961,800,000,000 (about US$177.2 bil-
lion in the rate 1:28), which is about 37.5% of GDP (Lai
et al.
2011
)
. The debt situation of Taiwan is much better
than that of the United States, but the ROC Government is
always more conservative about raising debt.

for funeral expense is up to NT$300,000, and for
legal aliment is up to NT$1,000,000.

22.3.4
Identifying Changing Service
and Procedural Rights for Victim

22.3.4.1
Victim Compensation

Because of public concern over welfare state and
the change of criminal policies, the MOJ in
Taiwan began to promote the ROC legislative of
crime victims’ protection in 1993 (Zheng and
Wang
2004
)
. The ROC legislative Yuan promul-
gated the CVPA on May 27, 1998, and of
ﬁ
cially
enforced on October 1, 1998. However, not all
types of crime victims are protected by this Act.
The protection is limited to “the family members
of deceased victims, seriously injured victims of
criminal acts and victims of sexual assault crimes”
(Article 1). According to the Article 4 of the Act,
those people are entitled to apply for crime vic-
tim compensation paid by the prosecutors’ of
ﬁ
ce
of a district court or its branch court out of the
following funding sources:

The funds budgeted by the MOJ.
•

Amounts deducted from the total labor wages
•
paid to prisoners who participate in work pro-
grams in prison.

The proceeds from the criminal venture, the
•
proceeds from sale of con
ﬁ
scated property of
the criminals, or other proceeds.

Certain amounts deducted from the sum of
•
amounts payable by criminals for suspension
of sentence, deferred prosecution, or negotia-
tions relating to criminal judgments.

In line with the Article 9 of the Act, compensa-
tion may be made for loss of wages (up to
US$33,333), loss of future earnings for family
living (up to US$33,333), medical bills (up to
US$13,333),
mental
counseling
(up
to
US$13,333),
and funeral expenses (up to US$10,000). In the
United States, rarely are two compensation
schemes alike. Awards are typically in the range
of US$100 to US$15,000 (Siegel
2009
, p. 78).
Comparing to that, the compensation schemes
seem reasonable. However, those compensations
are considered as secondary. In other words, if the
applicant has already received any social insur-
ance bene
ﬁ
t, damage or any other pecuniary
bene
ﬁ
t for the harm he/she suffered from a crimi-
nal act, the sum of such other payments received
by him/her shall be deducted from the amount of
crime victim compensation payable to him/her
under this Act (Article 11).

The compensation decisions are made by two-
level
committees.
The
Crime
Victim
Compensation
Review
Committee
(hereinafter
“Review
Committee”) is established in each district court
prosecutor’s of
ﬁ
ce, while the Crime Victim
Compensation Reconsideration Committee is cre-
ated in a high court prosecutors’ of
ﬁ
ce for exam-
ining the appeals against the Review Committee’s
decisions. Each level’s committee usually consists
of six to ten members who are public prosecutors
and law or medical science experts appointed by
the MOJ, and is presided by the chief prosecutor
(Article 14). Upon payment by the prosecutors’
of
ﬁ
ce of any crime victim compensation under
the Act, the prosecutors’ of
ﬁ
ce has the right to
make a claim for reimbursement against a con-
victed defendant but such reimbursement shall
not exceed the compensation paid to the crime
victim (Article 12). In order to preserve the right
to claim reimbursement, the prosecutors’ of
ﬁ
ce
may request the court to provisionally seize the
property of the convicted defendant or others lia-
ble for indemni
ﬁ
cation for damage in accordance
with the applicable laws (Article 27).


22.3.4.2
Victim Advocates

In order to assist crime victims or their family
members to return to their normal lives, the
Article 29 of the CVPA ruled that the MOJ and
the Ministry of the Interior (MOI) shall work
jointly to establish a crime victim protection
institution but under the MOJ’s direction and

9  According to Article 192 of the Civil Code in Taiwan, the
perpetrator should assume liability for damages to victim,
including medical expenditures, increased living expenses,
and funeral expenses in the case of wrongful deaths
against others; the perpetrator should also assume liability
for the third person as long as the victims have a statutory
maintenance obligation to the third person. The calcula-
tion of the amount of maintenance obligation should con-
sider the actual conditions in line with the “Average Life
Tables” calculated by the Ministry of Interior.

22 Victims of Crime in Taiwan
supervision. Hence, an organization named
“Association for Victims Support” (AVS) was
created in 1999. The AVS has its head of
ﬁ
ce in
Taipei City and 21 branch of
ﬁ
ces located in each
Public Prosecutors Divisions under district courts
across Taiwan. The Board of Directors is the
AVS’ highest authority. It is composed of nine to
17 directors, being chosen from the MOJ staff
and serving a tenure of of
ﬁ
ce for 2 years with no
remuneration. The Prosecutor General of the
Public Prosecutors Division under the Taiwan
High Court serves the Chair of the Board.

In order to maximize the protection function
by assisting the victims or their survivors to reha-
bilitate their normal life, the Association and its
representative of
ﬁ
ces in various areas have
recruited and encouraged some social public hav-
ing enthusiasm for safeguarding public interests
to act as volunteers and join the team dedicated
for protection of victims of criminal acts and
establishment of protection service networks for
victims of criminal acts by working actively to
the furtherance of the victims protection task.
Presently, a total of some 1,300 volunteers, indi-
viduals, and/or in-groups have joined this force.
Most of them are college/university graduates
and currently working in industrial/commercial
sectors or in governmental agencies.

The operational funds of AVS mainly come
from the budgets of the MOJ and the MOI and
public donations. In line with the Article 29 of
the CVPA, the AVS not only advocates the pro-
tection of crime victims but also provides neces-
sary help to crime victims, including securing
emergent physical and mental treatments,
ﬁ
nding
a place for staying, legal counseling in the course
of the judicial investigation or trial, applying for
compensations, and obtaining medical treatments
and rehabilitations.

Zheng and Wang
(
2004
) conducted a research
about the crime victims’ perception of the AVS’
performance. The researchers used the method
of quota sampling to mail questionnaires to 600
crime victims across 19 jurisdictions in Taiwan
(Jinmen and Mazhu counties were excluded),
and 144 questionnaires were sent back, making
a response rate around 25%. More than half
(53.2%) of the respondents were auto incident
victims, whereas more than a third (36.1%) of
the respondents were violent crime victims.
Forty-one respondents indicated that they
received compensations but only 17 people
satis
ﬁ
ed the amount of compensations. While
the crime victims were being asked “how do
you know the service of AVS” more than one-
fourth of the respondents indicated that the AVS
actively contacted them; but only one respon-
dent was aware of the AVS’ service from the
media. In addition to that, because the interac-
tion between the AVS and crime victims was
most likely depending upon the AVS staff’s
active contacts, 64 respondents indicated that
the
ﬁ
rst contact by AVS happened 30 days or
later after their victimizations. When the
researchers used chi-squared test to examine the
relationship between the
ﬁ
rst-contact days and
satisfactions of AVS’ service, it was found that
the fewer the
ﬁ
rst-contact days, the more
satis
ﬁ
ed victims were with AVS’ service
.
However, the AVS is not a part of government
organizations; the prosecutor’s of
ﬁ
ce has no
obligation to notify the AVS about the crime
victims who entitled the assistances under the
CVPA. Zheng and Wang
(
2004
) suggested that
the AVS should strengthen its media connec-
tions to let publics to know its availability to
crime victims.

Recent news shows a progress of victim advo-
cates in Taiwan. The legislature voted on
November 15, 2011, to expand protection for
crime victims to cover foreigners, including
workers and spouses from China, Hong Kong,
Macau, and other countries. Under the current
version of the CVPA, a set of measures designed
to protect crime victims does not extend to for-
eign spouses and workers from countries that do
not provide reciprocal treatment to Taiwanese.
After the amendment comes into force, those
foreign spouses and other foreigners are entitled
to the service from the AVS. Lawmakers in
Taiwan “agreed to remove the principle of reci-
procity on the grounds that it went against the
spirit of the International Covenant on Civil and
Political Rights, which Taiwan has signed and
rati
ﬁ
ed even though it is not a UN member”
(Shih
2011

)
.

22.3.4.3
Victim Right

Taiwan enacted the CVPA in 1998 and amended
it in 2011. However, the focus of the Act is resti-
tution or compensation to crime victims rather
than the victim right. According to Song
(
2007
)
,
the legal protection of victim right in Taiwan is
still based on the Code of Criminal Procedure
(CCP). With respect to the CCP, crime victims
(or their family members) in Taiwan have four
basic rights:

Right to examine the case
ﬁ
le and exhibits and
•
make copies by defense
attorney (Article 33)

Right to state their opinions in the court
•
(Article 271)

Right to be noticed of the date of trial (Article
•
271)

Right to appeal by requesting the prosecutor
•
(Article 344)

Song
(
2007
) argued that those rights are not
appropriate for crime victims, especially the right
to state opinions in the court, comparing with the
victim impact statement in the United States. The
US Supreme Court
ﬁ
rst recognized the rights of
crime victims to make a victim impact statement
during the sentencing phase of a criminal trial in
the case of
Payne v. Tennessee 501 U.S. 808
(1991). The victims and their family members
may present the written or oral information about
the impact of the crime on them. Such statements
provide a means for the court to refocus its atten-
tion, at least momentarily, on the human cost of
the crime. They also provide a way for the victim
to participate in the criminal justice process. In
Taiwan, as the term indicated, victims’ presenta-
tions in the court are just “opinions,” which have
no legal ef
ﬁ
cacy as that of victim impact
statement.

22.4

Future Trends

Taiwan has experienced a lot of political and eco-
nomic advancement in the past decades. In terms
of politics, Taiwan has been moving from author-
itarian government to democratic administration
since late 1980s. The Democratic Progressive
Party (DPP) was formed as a genuine opposition
party in 1986. In 1996, citizens in Taiwan for the

ﬁ
rst time elected the ROC President by direct
votes rather than by the National Assembly. In
2000, DPP candidate Chen Shui-bian was elected
president, marking the
ﬁ
rst-ever transfer of gov-
erning power between political parties. The pres-
idential inauguration of the KMT’s Ma Ying-jeou
in 2008 marked the nation’s second democratic
transfer of power between parties (Government
Information Of
ﬁ
ce
2011
)
.

In terms of economy, Taiwan is moving from
agricultural economy to industrialized state. As it
took the United States 150 years to reach its pres-
ent living standard, Taiwan has achieved a similar
level to the United States within 40 years (Chow

2002
)
. The impressively political development
and economic growth inevitably triggered certain
trends in the context of victimization.

The
ﬁ
rst trend relates to an in
ﬂ
ux of immigra-
tions from Southeast Asia and Mainland China.
According to Government Information Of
ﬁ
ce

(
2011

)
, starting in the late 1990s, an increasing
number of marriages between ROC citizens and
foreign nationals have further diversi
ﬁ
ed the
nation’s ethnic makeup. The cross-border mar-
riage accounted for one in every
ﬁ
ve weddings in
2009. As of October 2011, the population of
“foreign spouse” is 456,814, with 67.1% from
mainland China (including Hong Kong and
Macau) and 18.8% from Vietnam (National
Immigration Agency
2011
)
. Those foreign
spouses account for about 2% of total population
in Taiwan.

Taiwan society (including the media and gov-
ernment) has long been used “foreign spouse” to
call brides from Southeast Asia and Mainland
China. As the population of foreign spouse
increased, scholars suggested using the term
“new resident” to replace “foreign spouse,”
because the latter one has a sense of discrimina-
tion. Now the term “new resident” has been grad-
ually accepted by Taiwan society. The creation of
R.O.C. Empathy and Care Association for New
Residents in 2009 exempli
ﬁ
ed this trend.

Yet new residents are still suffering many
social con
ﬂ
icts, including domestic violence
(Yu and Williams
2006
)
. The of
ﬁ
cial data


355
22 Victims of Crime in Taiwan

indicated that the ratio of foreign spouse as vic-
tims of domestic violence is 240 per 100,000
populations in 2008. This
ﬁ
gure is eight times
higher than that of national spouse (30 per
100,000 populations) in the same year (Hsu

2010
)
. The actual problem could be even severer
because foreign spouses as domestic violence
victims are underreported for varied reasons
(Yeh
2006

)
. Recent news squarely highlights
this issue, in which a 40-year-old taxi driver
killed his 30-year-old Vietnamese wife and
dumped her body into a harbor for long-term
domestic con
ﬂ
icts (“Half-naked female body
case,”
2011

)
. It is not the purpose of this chapter
to examine why this type of victimization hap-
pened. However, this chapter challenges crimi-
nologists to pay more attention of this type of
victimization in the future.

Another trend relates to self-protection. Prior
research indicated that fear of crime has prompted
crime victims in taking an active role in self-pro-
tection (Flaherty and Flaherty
1998
)
. One mani-
festation of this trend is the concept of
target
hardening (Clarke
1997
, p. 17), making one’s
residence or business crime-proof through locks,
bars, alarms, guards, or CCTV. According to the
2010 TACVS, many households adopted target
hardening approach after being victims of theft
by hiring security guards (increasing from 7.5 to
11.7%), installing alarms (increasing from 7.9 to
20.6%),
ﬁ
xing burglarproof bars (increasing from
66.4 to 73.2%), keeping dogs (increasing from
21.4 to 26%), and mounting CCTV (increasing
from 25.7 to 40%).

It can be concluded that burglarproof bars
and CCTV are the most common self-protec-
tion measures in Taiwan. However, the popular-
ity of CCTV caused another new type of
victimization—privacy impairment (“Theft-
prevention CCTV,”
2011

)
. In addition to that,
some victims may take self-protection to its
ultimate end by killing the offenders. For exam-
ple, a 29-year-old Vietnamese wife recently
stabbed her 58-year-old Taiwanese husband to
death because of long-term psychological abuse
by her husband for not allowing her to talk with
other males (“Husband stabbed to death,”

2011

)
. This chapter also suggests victimolo-
gists examining the issue of self-protection in
depth in the future.


22.5

Conclusion

The victim was a forgotten component in the
criminal justice system until the 1970s. Now the
victimology is truly becoming an international
focus. Regardless of whether the criminal justice
system of a speci
ﬁ
c country is based on adver-
sarial traditions or inquisitorial jurisdictions,
“they all share the ambition of reform on behalf
of victims of crime” (Lehner-Zimmerer
2011
,
p. 14). Although the Republic of China is not a
member of the United Nations, criminologists in
Taiwan have never self-isolated themselves from
the global trend.

The topic of victimization was
ﬁ
rst introduced
to Taiwan in 1970. In the 1980s, Taiwan society
experienced a democratic movement, which
inspired the creation of victim’s groups focused
on singular crimes, such as female protection
(1987), drunken driving (1990), and severe vio-
lent offense (1994). The CVPA was enacted in
1998, and Association for Victims Support was
established in 1999 in line with the CVPA. The

ﬁ
rst national criminal victimization survey was
undertaken in 2000.

This chapter examined most recently nation-
wide crime victim surveys in Taiwan, including
the 2010 TACVS and the CRC-NCCU’s biannual
surveys in July 2009 and January 2010. Those
surveys looked at the individual and household
victimizations happened in 2009 and indicated
that larceny was the most rampant offense, with
prevalent rates ranging between 10.43 and 16.8%.
However, the victims of theft were least likely to
report crime to the police. The main reasons for
not reporting were “too petty to report” and “it
won’t do anything good.” This chapter also exam-
ined commercial victimization in Taiwan based
on a study in 2005. It showed that shoplifting and
car/scooter theft were the most common crimes
happened in the commercial site. There was a dis-
agreement about the loss of crime between private


356
H.M. Wang
security managers and police of
ﬁ
cers. The
ﬁ
gures
of police were much higher than those of their
security counterparts. This disparity perhaps vali-
dated the
ﬁ
nding of individual and household sur-
veys that many victims would not report crimes to
the police unless the loss was large enough.

The victimization surveys indicated that more
than two-thirds of people in Taiwan were worried
about being crime victims. The past experiences
of victimization had signi
ﬁ
cant in
ﬂ
uence, espe-
cially by violent crimes. The social disorganiza-
tions index also signi
ﬁ
cantly connected with fear
of crime. Given the fact that of
ﬁ
cial crime rate in
Taiwan is continually decreasing from 2005
(2,442 cases per 100,000 population) to 2010
(1,607 cases per 100,000 population), this
ﬁ
nding
suggested that the community policing should be
seriously employed in Taiwan.

Victims rights in Taiwan seems considerably
improving after the enactment of the CVPA in
1998. The family members of deceased victims
and seriously injured victims of criminal acts and
sexual assaults are entitled to apply for compen-
sation up to $33,333. The AVS, established in
1999, has created networks to rehabilitate crime
victims’ normal life. An empirical research
(Zheng and Wang
2004
) indicated that more than
40% of crime victims who received compensa-
tions were satis
ﬁ
ed with the amount, and the less
the
ﬁ
rst-contact days, the more satis
ﬁ
ed of AVS’
service. However, the CVPA is restitution-ori-
ented, and the legal protection of victim right in
Taiwan presently is still based on the CCP. The
victims’ right described by the CCP is nominal,
especially the right to state opinions in the court
(Song
2007
)
.

This chapter identi
ﬁ
es two interrelated trends
due to the dramatic advancement in politics and
economy in Taiwan in the past decades. The
ﬁ
rst
trend involves a new group of residences in
Taiwan. They are more likely to be victimized
because of their social status. The second trend
associates with the concept of self-protection.
Many households in Taiwan install the CCTV,
which has a potential to invade neighbors’ pri-
vacy. Certain crime victims may even go further
to “
ﬁ
ght back.” Criminologists may pay more
attention to the above issues in the future.

Introduction

Children are the most vulnerable of human beings
in many ways. There are many risks for children
outside their homes. Children are, however, also
victimized by their family members. When abuse
and crime happen in the private sphere, inside the
family, it is very dif
ﬁ
cult to be discovered. Also,
it is dif
ﬁ
cult for law enforcement to intervene in
abuse within the family. This tendency may be
stronger in Asian countries where the society
respects family decisions in what happens within
the family (Neary
2002
)
. Asian countries are
home to the largest share of the children in the
world. Asian countries are also where rapid eco-
nomic development is happening. It is also true
that children are often the last parties who can
enjoy this prosperity. They are often exploited in
many ways. In this
ﬁ
rst section, the laws and
legal networks to prevent child abuse, commer-
cial sexual exploitation of children, and child
prostitution in Asian countries are explained.

23.2

Child Abuse

It is quite common that in many countries, focus
has mainly been put on crime against children
which occurred in the public sphere, and crimes
within private sphere (e.g., abuse against children
by their family members) have been considered
to be less serious. Since 1970s, feminist cam-
paigns have been playing a great role in family
violence, and many laws regarding family vio-
lence have been enacted in many countries. In
most western countries, it was around late 1970
when laws to protect children from being abused
were enacted. It takes more time, however, in
many Asian countries to let these movements
happen, and the legality of “reasonable chastise-
ment by parents” is still deeply rooted not only in
general public sentiments but also in law enforce-
ment. In most Asian countries, it was around late
1990s–2000 when laws to protect children from
being abused were
ﬁ
rst enacted (for example, the
Yokohama Conference Report
2002
)
.

23.2.1
Child Abuse in Japan

23.2.1.1
How the Law Has Changed to
Prevent Child Abuse Cases

Child abuse is becoming a more and more serious
problem in Japan (Nishizawa
2007
)
. The number
of child abuse cases reported to the Child
Guidance Centers (CGC) during 2010 was about
55,000, and the number is increasing every
year.
One of the reasons for this is, of course, that the
society has become more aware of the problem in
these 10 years. At the same time, it should be also
stated that the family style has been changing in
Japan. The family style has been bipolarized after
around late 1990s. Some women get to have their

children at a quite early stage in their lives, such
as late teens; on the other hand, other women
choose to marry and get pregnant when they are
in their 30s. When teenagers get pregnant and
cannot seek enough support from their family
members, relatives, and community, they face a
quite high risk in abusing children.

There was no speci
ﬁ
c law, other than the Child
Welfare Act (1947), to prevent and interact child
abuse cases in Japan until 2000.

The Child Abuse Prevention Act was enacted
in 2000. The Act de
ﬁ
nes child abuse as physical
abuse, psychological abuse, sexual abuse, and
neglect against children under 18 years. The Act

ﬁ
rst de
ﬁ
nes offender as parents and legal guard-
ian of the children; abuse committed by someone
who lived with the children (e.g., ex-boyfriends)
could not be categorized as child abuse cases. In
order to
ﬁ
ll this gap, the Act was amended in
2004. The Child Abuse Act (2004) states that
those who lived with the children and do not have
any legal rights over them could be also catego-
rized as a child abuser.

One of the other important amendments was
that the Act clearly de
ﬁ
nes what constitutes phys-
ical abuse, and also stated that the situation where
children had to observe the domestic violence
between their parents could be also psychologi-
cal abuse. Under the old Act the de
ﬁ
nitions of
psychological abuse were not clear, so it was
dif
ﬁ
cult to judge whether a reported case was
de
ﬁ
ned as a psychological abuse case or not.
Under the Act (2004), psychological abuse was
de
ﬁ
ned as “behaviors such as rejecting children
in an extreme manner, which gives children men-
tal and physical harm.” Domestic Violence hap-
pening between the parents was also de
ﬁ
ned as
psychological abuse. It is easy to imagine that
children who have to observe the violence
between their parents are put under great agony,
and these “forgotten victims” (Morita
2001
) were
protected by the amendment in 2004.

Even after the amendment in 2004, child abuse
problems were still facing many dif
ﬁ
culties. The
biggest issue then was the CGC often hesitated to
inquire and intervene with families even though
they did not doubt abuse cases happened. The
norm that “laws should not concern itself with
family matters” still strongly existed then. Most
of the severe cases where children die or are
heavily injured are due to this “delay.” Therefore,
in order to give the local government and the
CGC the power to summon the parents and search
their dwellings when they were suspicious that
children are abused, the Child Abuse Prevention
Act was amended for the third time, in 2007
(hereinafter the Act 2007). Under the Act 2007, if
the parents refuse to come to the CGC after their
being summoned twice, family courts can order
the staff of the CGC to search the houses with
help from police of
ﬁ
cers. In this sense, the Act
2007 gives greater power to CGC to intervene
with families where risk of child abuse is high.
Also, the article 12 of the Act 2007 gives prefec-
tural governors the power to give out restraining
orders against abusive parents so that they cannot
contact with their children in a children’s home
(jido-yogo-sisetsu).

23.2.1.2
Some Remaining Problems

The Child Abuse Prevention Act Japan has been
amended twice since its enactment in 2004. The
system and scheme for preventing and interven-
ing in child abuse have been gradually improv-
ing. At the same time, the CGC and other welfare
agencies still hesitate to use their enforcing power
to intervene with abusive families though the Act
allows them to do so. It is true that changing the
widely believed cultural myth that “law should
not intrude in the private sphere” is very dif
ﬁ
cult.
In order to discover and prevent abuse problems
as early as possible, we should not expect that
only CGC or other government agencies should
be involved. Not only CGC but also other social
welfare agencies, law enforcement, medical staff,
and so on need to cooperate well in order to pre-
vent child abuse cases. Also, building community
networks surrounding families with children
often works the best to
ﬁ
nd out problems within
the family. The government should pay much
more attention to how to build such bonds.

Also, what the Act is lacking is how to deal
with problems in the aftermath. There are very
few programs and schemes for reeducation of
abusive parents. It is sometimes necessary to take
efforts to reintegrate abused children and their


361
23 Child Protection in Asia
parents in order that there would be no risk for
the children to be re-victimized.

The Japanese Civil Code amended its provi-
sion regarding child custody rights in 2011 so
that these rights can be suspended for up to a
given number of years. Before this amendment,
these rights could be deprived; if there was severe
abuse, however, judges were reluctant to do so as
it would deprive the possibility for restoration of
the family. Under the amended provision, efforts
for restoration can be taken, while these rights are
suspended.

23.2.2
Child Abuse in South Korea

Because of the strong in
ﬂ
uence of Confucianism,
it had been very dif
ﬁ
cult for law to intervene in
the private sphere in South Korea, which means
that many child abuse cases were hidden. On the
other hand, the rapid economic and social
growth since 1960s made South Korea more
concerned about human rights of more vulnera-
ble people such as women and children. In 2000,
there was a
ﬁ
rst national survey on child abuse
in South Korea. It showed that over 30% of chil-
dren had been abused. The recent survey by the
Department of Health and Welfare showed that
the number of abused children in 2009 was 2.3
times as that in 2001. It is also true in South
Korea that child abuse is becoming a major
political issue.

In South Korea, the law to prevent family vio-
lence was enacted earlier than in other Asian
countries. In 1997 two laws, The Special Act for
Punishment of Family Violence and The Act for
Prevention of family Violence and Protection of
Victims, were established. The former law not
only states probation and community order but
also provides various treatment programs for
offenders for restoration of the family. The latter
law focussed on victims protection, such as sup-
port system for children in shelters.

One of the unique points of laws for child
abuse in South Korea is that they aim to respond
to not only child abuse problems but also broader
issues as family violence. When child abuse hap-
pens in a family, they often have another problem
such as domestic violence; therefore comprehen-
sive responses to violence in many forms maybe
important.

23.3

Commercial Sexual
Exploitation of Children

The market for commercial sexual exploitation of
children now spreads across the world. Also,
recent developments in information and commu-
nication technology have made this crime more
widely spread around the world, and what is
worse, it is dif
ﬁ
cult to trace. Unfortunately, Asian
countries are the big markets for sexual exploita-
tion of children, and attract many pedophiles
from all over the world. Commercial sexual
exploitation of children (hereinafter CSEC) takes
in many forms, such as child pornography, sexual
traf
ﬁ
cking, child prostitution, and so on. CSEC
often are committed in a form of an organized
crime. Organized crime groups
ﬁ
nd CSEC as a
way of obtaining pro
ﬁ
ts.

Children who are exploited sexually suffer
serious injury both physically and mentally.
Many of these children are suffering from serious
sexually transmitted diseases such as HIV. Most
children who are victimized in CSEC are from
poor families and communities. Just enacting
laws and punishing offenders are not enough to
respond to CSEC problems. Not only govern-
ment agencies but also NGO, NPO, and private
companies must cooperate to deal with underly-
ing problems of poverty, education, and social
welfare.

23.3.1
Child Pornography

It is dif
ﬁ
cult to de
ﬁ
ne Child Pornography. Child
Pornography can be de
ﬁ
ned as
ﬁ
lms, magazines,
and photos where improper nudity of child or
sexual activities involving child are depicted.
With the rapid growth of electronic communica-
tions, such as Internet, Web mails, chatting, and
social service network, child pornography can be
delivered and distributed in various forms, and
they are also easy to be exchanged from one


362
M. Hirayama
country to other countries. Therefore a global
de
ﬁ
nition of sexual abuse against children is nec-
essary. Pedophilia groups who produce and dis-
tribute child pornography are often called sex
rings. Child Pornography must be criminalized
because (1) children are abused during produc-
tion of child pornography, which hurts the child
both physically and mentally, and (2) watching
child pornography may trigger potential child
molesters to commit actual crimes against
children.

According to the 2008 report by the World
Congress against CSEC, “While impossible to
obtain accurate data, a perusal of the child por-
nography readily available on the international
market indicates that a signi
ﬁ
cant number of chil-
dren are being sexually exploited through this
medium.”
(the
World
Congress
against
Commercial Sexual Exploitation of Children).

Most countries have struggled to criminalize
and prevent Child pornography. The 87th Session
of General Conference of the International Labor
Organization in Geneva in 1999 adopted C 182
Worst Forms of Child Labor Convention 1999. In
this convention, child pornography is categorized
as one of the work forms of child labor. The
Convention is rati
ﬁ
ed by many Asian countries
such as Malaysia, Japan, Singapore, Republic of
Korea, Thailand, China, and so on.

Also, the Protocols to the UN Convention on
the Rights of the Child on the Sale of Children,
Child Prostitution and Child Pornography are
rati
ﬁ
ed by 118 countries including many Asian

countries. The Protocols demand ratifying coun-
tries to criminalize any behaviors relating to child
pornography such as production, distribution,
import/export and selling, and possession for
these purposes. Many of these ratifying countries
have their own domestic law to criminalize and
prevent child pornography, such as “Act on
Punishment of Activities Relating to Child
Prostitution and Child Pornography, and the
Protection of Children” (Japan, 1999).

One of the issues here is whether mere posses-
sion of child pornography should be criminalized
or not. Even mere possession may motivate
potential pedophiles to commit crime against
children. On the other hand, however, as it is
dif
ﬁ
cult to de
ﬁ
ne what constitutes “child pornog-
raphy,” criminalizing and punishing mere posses-
sion may give law enforcement a diffuse and
wide authority to arrest, search, and seize mate-
rial from citizens.

In Japan, there is another problem such as
“Child Pornography of non-real Children.” This
refers to comics and animations where nudity
and sexual intercourse with child characters
(which do not really exist) are depicted.
Sometimes such images are called “pseudo-pho-
tographs.” Even though no children are actually
exploited or harmed in these comics, some claim
that they must be prohibited as they exhibit a
pedophilic culture. At the same time, if the images
are not of real children, it is dif
ﬁ
cult to de
ﬁ
ne
what “child pornography” is. In 2010, the
Governor of Tokyo tried to submit a draft of an
ordinance to restrict these comics where images
of “non-real children” are depicted; however, no
regulation has been realized yet.

23.3.2
Child Traf
ﬁ
cking
and Prostitution

In 2008, one very shocking movie, entitled “Children
in the Darkness” (directed by J. Sakamoto), was
released in Japan. It involved child traf
ﬁ
cking and
prostitution in Thailand. Most of these exploited
children are abandoned street children or from poor
families. They are sometimes “sold” to rich people
from Western countries and other Asian countries.
In this sense, these children traf
ﬁ
cked are akin to
“slaves” in the modern era. As in these crimes, both
offenders and victims can be spread all over the
world, it is very important to control and prosecute
these crimes within a universal jurisdiction.

There have been many Conventions and
Protocols at government level to combat human
traf
ﬁ
cking.

Optional Protocol to the Convention on the
Rights of the Child on the Sale of Children,
Child Prostitution and Child Pornography
requires State Parties to take suitable measures
to submit the case to its competent authorities


363
23 Child Protection in Asia
for the purpose of prosecution, regardless of
nationalities of offenders or victims, and the
place where a crime had been committed.

In 2002, the South Asian Association for
Regional Cooperation (SAARC) adopted the
Convention on Traf
ﬁ
cking in Women and
Children. Under the Convention, SAARC mem-
ber States corporate not only to prevent and inter-
vene in human traf
ﬁ
cking of children and women
but also to provide suf
ﬁ
cient support to victims
for their recovery.

Also, ASEAN adopted the ASEAN Declaration
against Traf
ﬁ
cking in Persons Particularly
Women and Children in 2004 in Vientiane, Lao
People’s Democratic Republic. The aim of the
declaration is to establish regional networks to
prevent and combat traf
ﬁ
cking in women and
children in ASEAN countries. The declaration
also puts focus on providing support and treating
with respect victims either in receiving/recipient
countries, and repatriating the victims promptly
to their own countries.

23.3.3
Child as Victims of Sexual Crime

Criminal justice policy to prevent sex crime
against children often becomes irrational and
overly radical. Crimes against the most vulner-
able people who cannot defend their own selves
trigger moral panic in society. In some jurisdic-
tions, laws to require released sex offenders to
register at the law enforcement agencies and to
notify the information to neighbors or the
broader community are enacted. The most well-
known example of these laws is Megan’s Law;
the US Megan’s Law was enacted named after
Megan Kanka, a 7-year-old girl who had been
molested and murdered by a sex offender who
lived in the neighborhood. It was only after the
death of the girl when her parents and the com-
munity came to know that the offender had two
previous convictions for sex crime and that he
had been released from the prison for good-time
release. The parents and the community then
claimed that they needed a law to let the com-
munity know when a sex offender is released,
namely, Megan’s Law.

Each country has its own way of responding to
sex crime committed against children by repeat
sex offenders. I now look at two different types of
responses, namely, in Japan and South Korea.

23.3.4
Tracking System for Child
Molesters in Japan

In November 2004, a very similar case as Megan
Kanka case happened in Nara Prefecture, Japan
(hereinafter the Nara Case). In the Nara Case, a
7-year-old girl was abducted. While missing, her
family received an e-mail containing photographs
depicting the girl’s dead body, and her body was
discovered the next day. The police could not
ﬁ
nd
an offender for a while, and what was worse, the
family received blackmail threats from the
offender in which he claimed that he was now
targeting the family’s other daughter.

At the end of December, more than a month
after the kidnapping, a 36-year-old newspaper
delivery man, living in the same prefecture as the
victim, was arrested.

As it turned out, the man had a record of mul-
tiple sex offenses. He had been arrested a few
times for committing sex crimes, and for the last
crime he had served a 3-year sentence in prison.
The whole nation was put into fear and people
began to doubt the justice system and the correc-
tional system. A single case changed the crime
justice policy for sex offenders greatly. Because
of the Nara Case, cognitive behavior programs
for sex offenders in prisons have become manda-
tory since 2006. Also, recidivism prevention pro-
grmas became compulsory while they were on
probation that year. There was an outcry in
Japanese society, claiming that Japan should
enact law like Megan’s Law. However, the
Ministry of Justice adopted a Surveillance System
for Sex Offenders by the police (hereinafter the
surveillance
system). In this tracking system,
when a sex offender who committed crime against
victims under 13 is released from a prison, his
information is released to the National Police
Agency (the national
headquarter of the police).
Then NPA releases the information to prefectural
police headquarters where the sex offender lives.


364
M. Hirayama
Then information is delivered to a local police
station closest to the residence of the sex offender.
At the local police station, recidivism prevention
of
ﬁ
cers are assigned to check the residence of the
offender. In the surveillance system, the police do
not use any GPS or special supervision program;
they just check the residence occasionally. Sex
offenders are supervised for at least 5 years after
their being released if they have one prior convic-
tion. For those who have more than two convic-
tions, they are supervised for at least 10 years.
The system has not been evaluated so far (Harada

2009
)
. But some statistics reveal that as of May
2010, 740 sex offenders had been put under the
system for 5 years, and 200 out of them were
unable to be located (27%).

Even though this was a very similar case as
Megan Kanka case, Japan decided to reserve
information on sex offenders only for the police.
There is an interesting survey on people’s attitude
toward information of sex offenders. In March
2005, the Nomura Research Institute in Japan
surveyed on public attitude toward safety, and
asked “to which extent do you want information
on released sex offenders ”; 3.7% of the respon-
dents answered that information must not be
released to the police, 44.2% said that the infor-
mation should be released to the police, 17.9%
said that the information should be disclosed to
the parties concerned with public securities,
15.9% agreed that the information should be dis-
closed to the public on their request, and only
1.3% answered that the information should be
disclosed via the Internet (
N = 1,180).

The most interesting result of this survey was
that more than 40% of respondents said, “We do
not want the information on sex offenders
released into the community as long as police
do their job well.”

The response after the Nara case, even though
it was very similar to Megan Kanka case, was
quite different from that after the Megan case. It
seems that Japanese society trusts more in law
enforcement authority than the US society. But
the question here is whether it is quite the same
response in other Asian countries. South Korea
has shown a quite different response.

23.3.5
The Crime Justice Policy for
Child Molesters in South Korea:
Supervision and Information
Disclosure System

Since 2000, South Korea illustrates a very radical
attitude to sex crime where children are victim-
ized. Actually, the USA and South Korea are the
only two countries which have a law to allow
release of information of sex offenders to the
community. In 2000, South Korea enacted “Act
of Sexual Protection of Adolescence.” The main
background to this legislation was the increasing
number of prostitution cases involving young
girls. In South Korea, though Confucianism had
given strong moral guidance toward sex, young
people became more lenient about sex since
1990, leading to increasing number of prostitu-
tion cases by teenagers. This prostitution was
quite different from traditional forms of child
prostitution where children are abducted and
forced to work; on the contrary, quite many teen-
agers have sex with adults for pocket money. Yet,
of course in terms of power, it is still the same;
adults take advantage of minors because these
young girls often lack appropriate knowledge and
information. Under the Act of Sexual Protection,
South Korea introduced the system to disclose
the information on offenders who commit violent
sex crime or sexually exploit children under 19
years old. Under this disclosure system, name,
age, job, address, and description of offenders are
disclosed via an of
ﬁ
cial announcement report or
the Internet. If the information is disclosed by an
of
ﬁ
cial announcement report, the information
shall be posted for 2 months, and if by the Internet
for 6 months. Their disclosure system is similar
to Megan’s Law; however, one of the biggest dif-
ferences is they do not disclose the photos of

offenders. There has been much opposition to the
disclosure system, because in South Korea the
society puts much focus on shaming, and this
noti
ﬁ
cation system impacts heavily on privacy of
these offenders. Also, as they do not disclose
photos of the offenders, innocent people were
mistakenly taken as sex offenders just because
they have same or similar name as the offenders


365
23 Child Protection in Asia
who are disclosed. However, to protect (innocent)
children, the system has been supported by the
majority of the society in South Korea so far.

The disclosure system, however, has not been
seemed to work well in reducing the fear within
society. The fear against crime where children
are victimized has grown over the years. The
Nae-Yeong case in 2008 is worth noting. Nae-
Yeong, an 8-year-old girl, was brutally raped by a
57-year-old man on her way to the school. The
offender tortured the girl for hours, and she had
to have 8 hours surgery. She lost 80% of her colon
and genital organs. It turned out that the offender
had a prior record of rape. The tragedy shocked
the whole nation and citizens posted the offend-
er’s name, photo, and other details on the Internet.
In a single day, more than 200,000 people signed
the petition to seek harsher punishment.

Politically, the Lee administration also was
willing to enact further protection from violent
sex criminals. The outcry for preventing sex
crime against children in South Korea was gain-
ing momentum, which made South Korea the

ﬁ
rst nation in Asia which has chemical castration
introduced in 2011. The law gives judges the
power to order sex offenders who have attacked
children under the age of 16 to undergo a medical
procedure, widely known as chemical castration;
the effects of such chemical procedures can last
for up to 15 years.

Also the society’s outcry after the Ne-Yong
case amended “Child and teen Protection Law”
to extend the period sex offenders must register
from 5 years to 10 years. The information
noti
ﬁ
cation system was also further developed.
In July 2011, the Ministry of Gender Equality
and Family created “Registration and Information
System for Sex Attackers of Teenagers,” and
under the system children, their parents, and
school authorities have access to the information
on sex offenders obtained by the police. Prior to
the new system, such information included only
general location of offenders (city, county, and
ward) and no photo of them. Under the new sys-
tem, now name, age, job information, speci
ﬁ
c
address, and photo of an offender are published.
Information is viewable only from certain com-
puter terminals equipped at the police stations.
Sex offenders who fail to register may be pun-
ished by up to 1 year in prison and a
ﬁ
ne up to

ﬁ
ve million Won (approximately 5 thousand US
dollars).

Also,
in
September
2008,
“Electronic
Monitoring System for Speci
ﬁ
c Sexual Violent
Offenders Act” was enacted in South Korea”
(hereinafter Electronic Monitoring Act). Under
article 5 of the Electronic Monitoring Act, offend-
ers who are ordered to wear electronic device
system are:

1.
Those who have more than two previous

convictions of sex crimes and have served
more than 3 years in prison and reoffend
within 5 years

2.
Those who are ordered to wear GPS and
reoffend

3.
Those who have more than two previous sex
convictions and habitually offend

4.
Those who commit crimes against victims
under 13 years old

When prosecutors determine these above cir-
cumstances, they apply to courts, and courts can
order these offenders to wear GPS on their anklet
for up to 10 years (article 9).

Probation of
ﬁ
cers can preserve information
obtained by these electronic monitoring system
and make use of them for treatment programs for
preventing offenders’ recidivism. The police,
also, have the access to such information for
investigation when sex crime occurs in the com-
munity. Such information will be deleted after 5
years when these orders are completed.

If offenders break GPC devices, they face
more than 1 year incarceration, and if they break
restraining orders or fail to attend treatment pro-
grams, they face up to 3 years incarceration and/
or up to 10 billion Won
ﬁ
ne (approximately 100
thousand US dollars).

Because of the in
ﬂ
uence of Confucianism,
South Korea has put much value on the norm of
shame. If a person commits crime, especially a
most disgusting crime such as child molestation,
not only that person but also his or her family is
also excluded from a society. (These tendencies
may be stronger in Asian countries than western
countries.) The fact South Korea introduced
information disclosure system may exclude


366
M. Hirayama
offenders and their families from the community,
which end up depriving them of the opportunities
for rehabilitation. Further analysis will be needed
to assess whether these radical policies actually
prevent recidivism.

23.4

Conclusion

Child abuse can take place in various forms and
is deeply rooted in the cultural and economic
environment of the society. These problems espe-
cially are connected with poverty and lack of
education and the social welfare system
(Whitebook on Child Poverty Editorial Committee

2009
)
. It is very important, therefore, to provide
good welfare system and support parents and
family in order to reduce abuse problems rather
than punishing abusers. Also, as the role of the
community is important to detect and prevent
child abuse, how to rebuild bonds within com-
munity should pe put much more focus on.

Many researchers have shown that those who
have been abused may be more likely to be
offended against others, and become criminals
when they grow up. Therefore it is very impor-
tant to prevent and intervene in child abuse in
order to reduce future crimes.

As children often have little voice in the soci-
ety, their tragedies are often hidden. It is very
important not only for professionals or the author-
ity but also for the community to discover and
prevent child abuse. Also, more outreach pro-
grams for family are needed so that those fami-
lies who seek help and information can have
more access to support.

Child abuse is a unique crime, in a sense vic-
tims still seek connection to the offender after
being victimized (as still family). Therefore, res-
toration of the family should be also considered
in some cases. In doing so, a Restorative Justice
(RJ) approach such as Family Group Conferences
(FGC) method may be workable for some child
abuse cases. In New Zealand, one of the leading
countries which has a formal RJ system, use FGC
where victim, offender, and their (extended) fam-
ily members seek the way for restoration of fam-
ily for child abuse cases. In Asian countries, there
are no established RJ programs for child abuse
cases at this stage; however, RJ approach may be
appropriate for some cases such as restoring fam-
ily and reeducating offenders.

On the other hand, criminal justice policy for
the most vulnerable group can often become too
radical. Disclosing offenders’ information to the
community may deprive opportunities and rights
for them, and exclude them from the community.
Just excluding offenders and providing no sup-
port for them may be more dangerous, as it will
be dif
ﬁ
cult to rehabilitate those who have lost
bonds to the society.

Introduction

Although women constitute about half of the
total population (48%) in India and are the prin-
cipal providers of care and support to families,
their status is not equal to men. This has not
always been the case. For example, women in
ancient India enjoyed equal status with men in
all
ﬁ
elds of life, including education, whereas
during the medieval period, the women held a
subordinate status. In modern India, women have
slowly gained status but not in all spheres.
Various social indicators show that women’s sta-
tus is lower than their male counterparts.
Although the censuses recorded between the
2001 and 2011 show improved literacy rate for
women, females still represent only 43% of all
literates (
n
= 778,454,120) (Government of India

2011

)
. Further, in rural India, women are reported
to be 55–65% of the total labor force
(National
Commission for Women n.d.

)
. One report

indicated that in some rural areas women put in
more hours than a pair of bullocks in the
ﬁ
eld.
For example, a man works an average of 1,212 h
in a year, compared to a pair of bullocks who
work 1,064 h, whereas a woman works 3,485 h
(Shiva
1991

)
. In addition, women receive lower
returns for their labor due to gender discrimina-
tion. Such discrimination, according to the
National Commission on Women, contributes to
displacement, devaluation, and disempowerment
of women, which increases the incidence of rape,
female feticide, traf
ﬁ
cking of women, and other
forms of violence.

Due to their secondary status in the Indian
society, women are subjected to various forms of
violence. Of all the forms of violence, domestic
violence has emerged as one of the most serious
problems faced by women. Across the globe,
criminal justice agencies recognize the problem
of domestic violence as a serious crime against
women. In India, however, it is largely viewed as
a family matter—neighbors, friends, and even
relatives of victims rarely interfere in situations
of domestic violence.

Status of Women in India:
An Overview

During the Vedic period (1500

500
b.c.e.)
,
women had considerable freedom in the family
and society. The
Rig Veda, one of the four
Veda
s,
indicated that women were equal to men in terms
of access to and capacity for the highest knowl-
edge of Brahma (the Hindu God of creation). The

Veda
contains hymns, which were revealed even

by the women seers (known as

. It is stated that women had a voice in
choosing their partners, were educated, and held
prominent positions in social and religious gath-
erings. In Vedic society, women distinguished
themselves in science and learning and were con-
sidered intellectual companions, friends, and liv-
ing helpers in the life journey of their partners. In
addition, monogamy was the rule at that time.
Remarriage of widows was permitted. Overall, in
the Vedic age, Hindu women were honored and
respected (Kumari
1994
)
.With the passage of
time, however, the status of women gradually
deteriorated. For instance, in the Smriti period,
the most signi
ﬁ
cant lawmaker was Manu.
According to Manu, a woman in her childhood
must be protected by her father; in her youth, she
must be protected by her husband; when she is
older, she must be protected by her son. Manu’s
social codes and sanctions are re
ﬂ
ected in these
dictums. Although the laws of Manu were com-
piled between 200
b.c.e. and 200
c.e
., the day-to-
day life of Hindu women is still in
ﬂ
uenced by the
laws of Manu. The period that followed Manu’s
reign put further restrictions on women. For
example, the practice of child marriages,
Sati
(self-immolation of a woman following her hus-
band’s death), and a ban on widows remarrying
were practiced in some parts of India. With the
Muslim conquest of India, the practice of wear-
ing veils became common among Muslim
women. During the colonial era, notable Indian
social reformers stood
ﬁ
rm against social bigotry,
orthodoxy, idol worship, and even encouraged
women and men to seek Western/English educa-
tions. Raja Ram Mohan Roy (1772–1833
c.e.
),
one of the Indian social reformers, fought for the
abolition of
Sati. The efforts of other reformers
resulted in the remarriage of widows and the pro-
hibition of child marriages and bigamy. In 1929,
the minimum age of marriage for girls was set at
14. Under the British rule, some signi
ﬁ
cant
advances were made in women’s rights, includ-
ing proprietary and inheritance rights. Indeed,
similar reform movements emerged all over the
world during the mid-nineteenth century. Some
notable reformers who raised people’s awareness
of women’s political, social, and economic rights
included Susan B. Anthony, a prominent US civil
rights leader and an activist of women’s rights
movement, and Clara Jetkin, an in
ﬂ
uential
German socialist politician and a crusader for
women’s rights. The women of New York City
marched on March 8, 1908, demanding shorter
working hours, better pay, voting rights, and an
end to child labor.

In India, the issue of women’s rights was
voiced by Mahatma Gandhi and gained the sup-
port of many women activists (Tharakan and
Tharakan
1975
)
. Such a voice was re
ﬂ
ected in a
resolution adopted by the Indian National
Congress in 1931, when it made commitments to
defend civil rights and economic freedom. In
1940, the Indian National Planning Committee
established a subcommittee to review the social,
economic, and legal status of women and to
ﬁ
nd
measures to create equality of status and opportu-
nity (Forbes and Forbes
1996
)
. In 1927, Maharani
Chimanabhai Gaickward of Baroda organized
the
ﬁ
rst All India Women’s Educational
Conference. The All India Women’s Conference
held in 1945 discussed various types of discrimi-
nation faced by Hindu women and the Conference
prepared a Charter of Indian Women’s Rights.
After India achieved independence from the
British in 1947, the country adopted a socialist
philosophy and passed several laws intended to
protect the rights of women.

On January 26, 1950, the Constitution of India
was rati
ﬁ
ed. It not only granted equality to women
but also encouraged states to adopt measures of
positive discrimination, that is, to obliterate social
and
other
disabilities
and
deprivations.
Preferential
treatment for women is expressed in Article
15(3). This was “a warrant for af
ﬁ
rmative state
action” going beyond formal equal protection of
the laws provided under Article 14 (Roy and
Tilak
1996
)
. Although Article 15(1) prohibits
discrimination against any citizen in India on the
basis of religion, race, caste, sex, or place of birth,
Article 15(3) states that nothing in this article
shall prevent the state from making any special
provisions for women and children. In other
words, in a welfare state, the welfare of children
and women is of prime importance. Hence, any


369
24 Victims of Domestic Violence in India: Do They Have Rights?
special provision for their protection or empow-
erment would not offend against the guarantee of
nondiscrimination in Article 15(1) (Basu
2003
)
.
Despite these constitutional guarantees, however,
women are still subjected to various forms of
abuse and exploitation.

With the economic development and progress
of the last three decades, large number of Indian
women in urban areas have entered the work-
force. And, with economic independence, one
would expect equality of women in all spheres of
life; however, progress has been slow. Studies
have reported that abuse against working women
and violence against young widows have been on
the rise (Kumar
2010
)
. In addition, women in
India face unique forms of violence such as
“dowry deaths.”

Trends in Crimes Against
Women in India

In India, crimes against women are broadly cate-
gorized into two types: (1) crimes under the
Indian Penal Code (IPC) and (2) crimes under
special and local laws (SLL). There are provi-
sions in the IPC to deal with offenses such as rape
(Section 376); kidnapping and abduction for
speci
ﬁ
ed purposes (Section 363–373); homicide
for dowry, dowry deaths, or attempted dowry
death (Section 302/304B); torture (both mental
and physical) (Section 498a); molestation
(Section 354); sexual harassment (Section 509);
and importation of girls (up to 21 years of age)
(Section 366b). Molestation includes assaulting a
woman or using criminal force on her with the
intention of outraging her modesty (Ranchhoddas
and Thakore
1987
)
.

The IPC, a major criminal code covering all
substantive laws, was enacted in the year 1860
and, as a result, lacks provisions to deal with cer-
tain newer types of crimes against women.
Therefore, new laws (i.e., SLL) were enacted by
the government. A special law is a law that cov-
ers a particular subject matter such as dowry,
whereas a local law applies to a particular state
of India (i.e., the Tamil Nadu Police Act). The
major SLL that deal with speci
ﬁ
c crimes against
women are Immoral Traf
ﬁ
c (Prevention Act)

(

1956

)
, the Dowry Prohibition Act
(

1961
)
, the
Indecent Representation of Women (Prohibition)
Act
(

1986

)
, and the Commission of
Sati
(Prevention) Act
(
1987
)
.

and SLL crimes against women for the years

1 “Dowry” is an ancient cultural practice in many Indian
communities. It involves the bride’s family giving prop-
erty or valuables to the bridegroom or his family in con-
sideration of marriage. A dowry death, also known as
bride burning, is a unique form of violence experienced by
Indian women where young brides are either murdered or
driven to suicide by torture or harassment by husbands
and/or in-laws.

number of IPC crimes against women during this
period. Of the 5-year crime data, 2007 showed
the highest increase in IPC offenses (16.5%)
compared to 2009 (4.4%). In contrast, SLL
crimes against women have been decreasing.


The incidence of various types of IPC crimes
against women, including their growth rates, is
given in Table
24.2
. The offense of rape increased
between 2005 and 2008, but there was a marginal
decrease in the number of rape cases in 2009. The
number of dowry deaths steadily increased
between 2005 and 2009.


As stated previously, there are four special laws
that are gender speci
ﬁ
c. The incidence of crimes
under such laws and their growth rate are given in
Table
24.3
. In 2005, 3,204 cases were registered
under the Dowry Prohibition Act
(
1961
)
. In 2006,
a signi
ﬁ
cant increase (40.6%) was reported over
the previous year; in 2007, there was an increase of
24.8% over that in 2006. From 2008, the increases
are less noticeable (see Table
24.3
).


In 2009, a total of 203,804 crimes against
women were registered in all 28 states and 7
Union territories. Table
24.4 provides details
relating to the states and Union territories (i.e.,
areas that are under direct federal/central govern-
ment rule) and their contribution to the total inci-
dence of crimes against women. Some of the
states where the incidences of crime against
women are signi
ﬁ
cantly higher include Andhra
Pradesh (12.5%), Uttar Pradesh (11.4%), and
West Bengal (11.4%).

24 Victims of Domestic Violence in India: Do They Have Rights?

24.4

Domestic Violence: Its Nature
and Scope

Women and girls are subjected to physical, sex-
ual, and psychological abuse, irrespective of
income, class, and cultural background. Such
violence is one of the crucial social mechanisms
by which women are forced into a subordinate
position to men (United Nations [UN]
1995a
)
.
The UN General Assembly adopted the
Declaration on the Elimination of Violence
Against Women (DEVAW) in 1993. The DEVAW
de
ﬁ
nes violence against women as any act of
gender-based violence that results in, or is likely
to result in, physical, sexual, or psychological
harm or suffering to women, including threats of
such acts, coercion, or arbitrary deprivation of
liberty, whether occurring in public or private life
(UN
1993
)
. In light of this broad de
ﬁ
nition, vio-
lence against women in the family and in the gen-
eral community, and violence perpetrated by the
State, can also be included.

Violence against women in a family setting
may include battering, sexual abuse of female
children in the household, dowry-related vio-
lence, marital rape, female genital mutilation
(and other traditional practices harmful to
women), nonspousal violence, and violence
related to exploitation (UN
1995a
)
. Though there
are various de
ﬁ
nitions for domestic violence,
there is a need for a broad yet focused de
ﬁ
nition,
because the de
ﬁ
nition shapes the response. For
instance, the type of response from the commu-
nity (e.g., providing support services or need for
the legal reform) is shaped by the community’s
understanding of what constitutes domestic vio-
lence and whether it is to be conceptualized as an
intrafamily con
ﬂ
ict or a criminal violation of
rights. The de
ﬁ
nition of domestic violence by
law is critical because it de
ﬁ
nes standards and
thus in
ﬂ
uences the broader social perception of
the problem. Thus, the elements that need to be
considered include the boundaries of the relation-
ship between the perpetrator and the victim, the
norms of acceptable behavior, and the speci
ﬁ
c
acts that constitute violence (International Center
for Research on Women
1999
)
.

According to a report by the National Family
Health Survey ([NFHS-2] 2000, cited in Sunny

2003
)
, inequality and violence occur throughout
India. The report further states that 68% of the
women in the survey reported that they needed
permission from their husbands or in-laws to go
to the market, and 76% had to seek the consent of
their husbands before they could visit friends or

relatives. It is also revealed that only 60% of the
women could use money as they wished and one
out of every
ﬁ
ve women had experienced domes-
tic violence from the age of 15 onward. The per-
petrators of domestic violence, by and large, are
men, particularly marital partners. One of the
root causes for the aggressive behavior of marital
partners against women was the in
ﬂ
uence of
drugs or alcohol.

As far as the reporting behavior of the victims
of domestic violence is concerned, at one time
many victims would not
ﬁ
le complaints because
they feared that such complaints might create a
hostile environment at their homes. As a result,
they often suffered violence in silence (Sunny

2003
)
. Public awareness of domestic violence
and women’s
ﬁ
ght for equality and social justice
prompted the international community to recog-
nize violence against women as an important
social issue. India recognized the problem and
took measures to address them through the revi-
sion of old laws and the drafting of new ones to
criminalize offenders and provide protection to
women. For example, the IPC, which was origi-
nally passed in 1860, was amended in 1983 and
again in 1986; the Dowry Prohibition Act was
amended in 1984 and 1986. The amendments to
the IPC included de
ﬁ
nitions of speci
ﬁ
c offenses
such as marital violence and abuse. Under Section
498a of the IPC, domestic violence is a cogniza-
ble (i.e., felony) offense and police of
ﬁ
cers may
arrest the perpetrator without a warrant. For
example, if the victim complains to the police
that she was treated cruelly by her husband or
relatives, the police must take action. The term
“cruelty” not only covers serious injury, bodily
harm, or danger to life, limb, or physical health
but also danger to mental health, harassment, and
emotional torture through verbal abuse. The term
“harassment” covers acts such as coercing the
wife or her relatives, or demanding a dowry in the
form of property or valuables by the husband or
his family (Ranchhoddas and Thakore
1987
)
.

More important, Section 304b, which was
added to the IPC, de
ﬁ
nes the circumstances under
which a death is considered “dowry death.” It
states that if the death of a woman is caused by
burns, bodily injury, or other unusual circum-
stances within 7 years of the marriage, and it is
shown that the victim was subjected to cruelty or
harassment by her husband or his family, it is
considered a dowry death. In such cases, the hus-
band and/or his family would be deemed respon-
sible for her death. The punishment for such a
crime is imprisonment for 7 years or “life” (gen-
erally 20 years). The inclusion of dowry death in
the IPC necessitated changes in the evidentiary
standards for dowry death cases. Thus, a section
(113b) was added to the Indian Evidence Act

(
1872
)
, which shifted the burden of proof from
the prosecution to the accused in dowry death
cases.

Under the Dowry Prohibition Act, there are
three main forms of offenses: giving or taking a
dowry (Section 3[1], demanding a dowry [Section
4]), and receiving dowry for the bene
ﬁ
t of the
wife or her heirs (Section 6[1]). Section 3(1)
states that anyone who takes or aids in the giving
or taking of dowry shall be punished with impris-
onment for a term of not less than 5 years and
ﬁ
ne
of not less than 15,000 rupees or the value of the
dowry, whichever is greater. Section 4 stipulates
a punishment for anyone demanding a dowry
from the parents or relatives of the bride or bride-
groom of at least 6 months of imprisonment,
which may be extended to 2 years with a
ﬁ
ne of
10,000 rupees. Finally, Section 6 states that if a
dowry is received by anyone other than the bride,
it should be transferred to the bride within a
speci
ﬁ
ed period of time. Despite these legislative
changes, however, women in India were not
accorded the protections enumerated in various
international accords such as the DEVAW, the
Vienna Accord of 1994 (Of
ﬁ
ce of the United
Nations High Commissioner of Human Rights

1996
)
, or the Beijing Declaration (1995) (UN

1995a
)
.

The DEVAW de
ﬁ
nes the concept of violence
against women comprehensively. According to
the Declaration, violence against women is “any
act of gender-based violence that results in, or is
likely to result in, physical, sexual or psychologi-
cal harm or suffering to women, including threats
of such acts, coercion or arbitrary deprivation of
liberty, whether occurring in public or in private
life” (UN
1993
, Article 1). Article 3 of the


373
24 Victims of Domestic Violence in India: Do They Have Rights?
Declaration speci
ﬁ
es that women are entitled to
the following rights:

1.
The right to life

2.
The right to equality

3.
The right to liberty and security of person

4.
The right to equal protection under the law

5.
The right to be free from all forms of
discrimination

6.
The right to the highest standard attainable of
physical and mental health

7.
The right to just and favorable conditions of
work

8.
The right not to be subjected to torture, or
other cruel, inhuman, or degrading treatment
or punishment (UN
1993
)

Moreover, the Declaration encouraged states
to condemn and abolish all forms of violence
against women.

The Vienna Accord also recognized the human
rights of women and female children as inalien-
able, integral, and indivisible parts of human
rights. It insisted on full and equal participation
of women in political, civil, economic, social,
and cultural spheres at regional, national, and
international levels. It reiterated that any gender-
based discrimination due to cultural prejudice or
otherwise must be eliminated (Of
ﬁ
ce of the UN
High Commissioner on Human Rights
1996
)
.

The Beijing Declaration was intended to
advance women’s equality and development.
Speci
ﬁ
cally, it was intended to accomplish the
goals enumerated in the Charter of the United
Nations, the Universal Declaration of Human
Rights, the Convention on the Elimination of All
Forms of Discrimination against Women, the
Convention on the Rights of the Child, DEVAW,
and the Declaration on the Right to Development
(UN
1995b
)
. It recognizes the human rights of
women and of female children as inalienable
rights. Moreover, it states that the empowerment
of women can be achieved only if women are
given full participation in all spheres of society,
including access to power, involvement in deci-
sion-making process, and live their lives in accor-
dance with their own aspirations (UN
1995b
)
.

As a result of the recognition of violence
against women in the private domain and that
domestic violence is an unacceptable violation
of human rights, ensuring that women are treated
equally in all spheres of life has taken on interna-
tional importance. But in the Indian context,
even after the adoption of the aforementioned
UN Declaration, the issue has not received the
attention it deserved. This was perhaps due to
deep-rooted cultural norms and patriarchal val-
ues that view domestic violence as private family
matter that should be settled within the home,
without any need for “unnecessary” external
intervention (Lawyers Collective Women’s
Rights Initiative
2009
)
. Even in India, however,
domestic violence has gradually been recognized
as a serious human rights issue. But there was
neither a comprehensive law nor a clear legal
de
ﬁ
nition of domestic violence until 2005. Of
course, violence against women in the family
setting/within marriages is acknowledged and
remedies are available in the form of civil laws
(e.g., those dealing with divorce). In addition,
Section 498a of the IPC deals with cruelty by
husbands and relatives. Even so, these limited
legal remedies are available only to married
women. For victims of violence in other domes-
tic relationship, such as mothers, daughters, and
women in live-in relationships, Section 498a of
the IPC does not provide any remedy. It should
also be noted that marriages in India are solem-
nized under personal/customary laws. And not
all marriages are registered because registering
marriage is not compulsory. It was against this
background that the Protection of Women from
Domestic Violence Act (PWDVA) came into
force on October 26, 2006.


24.5

Salient Features of the
Protection of Women from
Domestic Violence Act

The PWDVA
(
2005
) intended to protect the rights
of women as guaranteed in the Constitution of
India. Hence, the PWDVA recognizes domestic
violence as a human rights issue. The PWDVA is
primarily a civil law but some elements of crimi-
nal law were incorporated into it. In other words,
the appropriate remedy under the PWDVA is
often civil in nature but when there is a violation


374
S. Kethineni and M. Srinivasan
of civil order by the perpetrator, the appropriate
remedy could be punishment.

Concerning the de
ﬁ
nition of domestic violence
in the PWDVA, it should be noted that it is the
most comprehensive de
ﬁ
nition of domestic vio-
lence under Indian law, and it includes all forms
of abuse and violence committed against women
in a family setting. To facilitate access to justice,
the PWDVA has provisions for new authorities,
including a protection of
ﬁ
cer (PO) as the key
implementing of
ﬁ
cer. In each district, the respec-
tive state government may appoint POs as it may
consider necessary. The state government shall
also notify the area(s) within which a PO shall
exercise the powers and perform the duties con-
ferred on him or her by or under this Act (Section
8[1]). The Act also provides that, to the extent
possible, POs shall be women. Some of the duties
and functions of the POs include the following:

(a)
Assisting the magistrate in the discharge of
his or her functions

(b)
Reporting to the magistrate about a domestic
violence incident upon receipt of a complaint
from the victim

(c)
Forwarding a copy of the complaint to the
police of
ﬁ
cer in charge of the police station
in the jurisdiction within which the incident
is alleged to have been committed

(d)
Applying to the magistrate for the issuance of
an order of protection, if the aggrieved per-
son so desires

(e)
Ensuring that the aggrieved person is pro-
vided legal aid under the Legal Services
Authorities Act (1987)

(f)
Maintaining a list of all service providers

(g)
Inform service providers that their services
may be required in the proceedings

(h)
Making a safe shelter home available to the
aggrieved person

(i)
Making sure that the aggrieved person is
examined by medical personnel if she has
sustained bodily injuries

(j)
Submitting a copy of the medical report to the
respective police station and the magistrate


(k)
Ensuring that an order for monetary relief is
complied with and executed in accordance
with procedures prescribed under the Code
of Criminal Procedure
(
1973
)

The PWDVA grants the victim of domestic

violence a number of reliefs: an order of protec-
tion (Section 18); a residence order (Section 19);
a custody order (Section 21); a compensation
order (Section 22); and interim and ex parte
orders (Section 23).

Under the PWDVA, the victim/aggrieved per-
son has the right to reside in a shared household
but this right does not confer a right of ownership
over the property. The right to reside is consid-
ered a procedural safeguard against dispossession
of the aggrieved person. In India, the male mem-
ber of a marriage is traditionally given possession
of the premises. Thus, it is relatively easy for a
man to dispossess a dependent wife, daughter,
mother, or other female members of the house-
hold (Lawyers Collective Women’s Rights
Initiative
2009
)
. In order to avoid being home-
less, many women stay in a hostile home.

Although legal provisions for providing com-
pensation to victims are available under the Code
of Criminal Procedure and the Probation of
Offenders Act
(

1958

)
, they are limited. For exam-
ple, the Code of Criminal Procedure recognizes
the principle of victim compensation, and Section
250 authorizes magistrates to direct complainants
or informants to pay compensation to people
accused by them without a reasonable cause.
Section 358 empowers the court to order a person
to pay compensation to another for causing a
police of
ﬁ
cer to arrest such other person wrong-
fully. Also, in a criminal proceeding, Section 357
allows the court to impose a sentence to grant
compensation to the victim as well as order the
defendant to pay the costs of the prosecution.
However, this is at the discretion of the sentencing
court and is to be paid out of a
ﬁ
ne recovered from
the perpetrator (Srinivasan and Mathew
2007
)
.

In addition to the restitution provision in the
Code of Criminal Procedure, Section 5 of the
Probation of Offenders Act empowers courts to
require released offenders to pay restitution.
However, given the low rates of conviction in
criminal cases (fewer than 25% of defendants in
domestic violence cases are convicted), the inor-
dinate delays in completing the proceedings, and
the relatively low capacity of the average accused
person to pay compensation, it is unrealistic to


375
24 Victims of Domestic Violence in India: Do They Have Rights?
say that there is a functioning victim compensa-
tion scheme (Menon
2004
)
. Unlike prior laws,
the provisions under the PWDVA for allowing
monetary relief and compensation (Sections 20
and 22) are meant to provide speci
ﬁ
c
ﬁ
nancial
remedies to the victims of domestic violence.

Although the PWDVA was hailed as the most
important legislation yet passed for providing
protection for women against physical, mental,
and economic abuse/violence, the Act was criti-
cized as being gender biased because it only pro-
tects women and some women could use this Act
to teach their male relatives a lesson. Such trends
were noticed in the case of anti-dowry law
(Section 498a). In addition, the de
ﬁ
nition of
domestic violence includes minor verbal insults
and name-calling as abuse. Some critics of the
Act felt that frivolous acts of “domestic violence”
could increase litigation and hurt the foundation
of marriages (“Amend dowry law …,”
2010
)
.

Others contend that the PWDVA has not
gained the desired level of social acceptance and
that one of the main barriers was delays in case
processing. At the time of writing this article, the
effectiveness of the Act is questionable because
although India has always been exceptional in
drafting legislation in accordance with interna-
tional standards, it has failed in the past to
enforce them effectively. In addition, the recent
Supreme Court decision regarding the right of
the women to a shared residence has, to some
extent, limited that right. In S. R. Batra v. Taruna
Batra
(

2007

)
, the Court held that a “shared
household” meant a house owned or rented by
the husband, or a house that is part of a joint
family dwelling in which the husband has a
share. In other words, if the house where the vic-
tim is staying is the sole property of her in-laws,
she has no right to the shared residence. This is a
step backward in terms of protecting women
from being thrown out of the joint family.


24.6

Conclusion

In spite of the glitches, the PWDVA is a signi
ﬁ
cant
legislation that offers various legal remedies
including monetary relief and compensation,
temporary custody of children until a case is
resolved in a civil court, counseling and medical
assistance, and protection orders. In addition, the
Act is intended to provide easy access to justice
and speedy access to relief. According to Lawyers
Collective Women’s Rights Initiative
(
2010
)
, the
Act offers a single window of access to judicial
system and service providers for women facing
domestic violence. Prior to the Act, women had
to seek different types of relief from different
courts, which was not only time consuming but
also dangerous. The Act requires key criminal
justice personnel (e.g., police, POs, and magis-
trates) to inform a woman of her rights at the time
of the
ﬁ
ling of the complaint. The periodic moni-
toring and evaluations, such as those conducted
by the Lawyers Collective Women’s Rights
Initiative, will identify loopholes in the law as
well as problems with its enforcement. As of
2010, the organization has completed four moni-
toring and evaluation reports. The most recent
evaluation (in 2010) found that married women,
divorced women, women in live-in relationships,
and mothers (in cases
ﬁ
led against their sons) are

ﬁ
ling cases under the PWDVA. Some states have
even established special cells within their police
headquarters to exclusively handle the cases that
fall under the Act.

Despite this progress, the formal justice sys-
tem is burdened with a backlog of cases and
domestic violence tends to take a backseat. As a
result, a new form of informal courts, known as
“Mahila Court” or
nari adalat (women’s courts),
have emerged in many parts of India, particularly
in western and northern states. The
nari adalats
are the results of grassroot efforts by women’s
groups (i.e., women’s collectives) to deal with
violence against women and empower women
(Sharma
2000
)
. These courts operate at the block
and village levels and the members are trained in
legal issues, discrimination of women, and wom-
en’s rights. As of 2010, there were 184
nari ada-
lats in 9 states, and they had presided over 6,000
cases (Purushothaman
2011
)
. These courts have
been especially useful for women from rural
areas and those who come from marginalized
communities. Typically, a group of
ﬁ
ve women
sit in a circle in front of a local government of
ﬁ
ce


376
S. Kethineni and M. Srinivasan
to decide cases such as divorce, disputes between
women and their in-laws, complaints about hus-
bands’ in
ﬁ
delity, domestic violence, rape, and
dowry harassment. In addition to serving as a
mediating body in which the parties must agree
to abide by the
nari adalat
’s decision, the
nari
adalat also ensures that the decision is imple-
mented (Purushothaman
2011
)
. In the future, a
combination of formal legal protection, enforce-
ment agencies, and informal courts should serve
to protect the rights of women in India. It remains
to be seen if the combination of these systems
will be able to assist victims of domestic violence
and provide the necessary protection to victims
of domestic violence.

Introduction

The origins of Restorative Justice are often con-
tested. Whilst the concept of Restorative Justice
is often attributed to Judeo-Christian beliefs and
values, it is also claimed that it has its genesis
within First Nation and Indigenous communities.
Even as there may be truth in the fact that restitu-
tion, reparation and apology had temporal and
spiritual connotations among families and early
communities in Europe, historically, violence at
individual, local and national levels was also
often the order of the day. A quick worldwide
historical examination demonstrates that both
violence and peacemaking have shaped the over-
all human experience. In short, human beings are
often, at one time or another, both conquered and
conquerors. This binary of peace and violence is
the starting point of the paper as many communi-
ties and nation states try to live in global peace
and harmony whilst always, in the
ﬁ
rst instance,
being mindful of their own interests. This is a
balance not always peacefully achieved.

Many jurisdictions now use the term “restor-
ative justice” to incorporate varying degrees of
restorative processes and practices, sometimes
rede
ﬁ
ning the term to suit their social and political
goals. The United Nations and Council of Europe
have suggested that restorative justice processes
become an integral part of the response to both
juvenile and adult offending. Although it is still
considered by some as an emerging social move-
ment, local, state and national governments often
see an advantage in including restorative justice in
their criminal justice systems. Braithwaite
(

2002
)
points to the UN Declaration (1985) as adopted by
the General Assembly in 1985, which covers many
aspects of restoration. The Working Party on
Restorative Justice adopted the Marshall
(

1996
)
de
ﬁ
nition of restorative justice:

Restorative justice is a process whereby all the par-
ties with a stake in a particular offence come
together to resolve collectively how to deal with
the aftermath of the offence and its implications for
the future.

In line with this ethos, Chi-Kong Lee
(
2008
)
contends that:

Placing a premium on the “doctrine of the mean”
and peaceful resolution of con
ﬂ
ict, Chinese tradi-
tional legal culture, being built on principles of
Confucianism, historically pursued a society where
the individual should live in harmony with Heaven
and Nature. This philosophy is consistent with
restorative justice’s emphasis on restoring breaches
in relationships with victims and the community.

Whilst nations develop diverse and often
inconsistent criminal codes and procedures to

suit local contexts and conditions within their
criminal justice systems, advocates of restorative
justice call for consistency in words, processes
and outcomes across boundaries. The downside
for this may be the loss of local and cultural dif-
ferences as the common language of restorative
justice presents a globalization in terms of ser-
vice types and delivery with common values and
principles. On another more positive note, a uni-
versal de
ﬁ
nition of restorative justice may be
required in order to maintain its underpinning
ethos, as in some jurisdictions, restorative justice
has been rede
ﬁ
ned and its core principles effec-
tively undermined to suit various governmental
“tough on crime” policies. On the other hand,
according to Van Wormer
(
2008
)
, Confucianism
contends that humankind is basically good. She
argues that, “Confucius taught his disciples the
principle of ren or truthfulness and kindness”.
Furthermore, according to Hui and Geng (2001
cited in Van Wormer
2008
)
, “Confucianism,
advocates a restorative approach to matters of
crime and justice. It assumes,
ﬁ
rst and foremost,
that the
ﬁ
rst victim of any criminal offence is the
offender himself or herself”. It remains a serious
concern that the oft times rede
ﬁ
nition of restor-
ative justice has, in some jurisdictions, led to
increasing rather than decreasing engagement
with the criminal justice system.

Braithwaite
(
2002
) maintains that the “core
listening principle” and the “non-domination
principle” are both central to the integrity of the
restorative process, involving the telling of sto-
ries of victims, accused offenders, community
members and stakeholders to deliver justice out-
comes. Following on from this, Ozawa
(
2003
:65)
notes within Singapore that “in this sense, justice
is not just an abstract concept, but the recti
ﬁ
cation
of or recompense for interpersonal wrongs. Crime
rates thus re
ﬂ
ect not simply matters of rules and
regulations, but the violation of societal norms,
interpersonal values, and principles governing
behaviour and the treatment of other citizens
within a given nation”. Pranis
(
2007
:59), too,
supports the range of values recognized as impor-
tant to the restorative justice process, including
“respect, maintaining individual dignity, inclu-
sion, responsibility, humility, mutual recognition,
reparation and non-domination”. Other research
(Goulding and Steels
2006
) has found that what
matters most to people, regardless of terminol-
ogy, is that due process is provided in a fair and
equitable way. Such due process should occur
with protections for human rights, the right to
voluntary participation, and the use of processes
that accord suf
ﬁ
cient time for all parties to par-
ticipate in a meaningful manner, according to
their needs. Currently, in many jurisdictions,
restorative justice processes are quickly pushed
through legal process to meet deadlines and judi-
cial outcomes. Also, the quality of facilitator and/
or mediator training is crucial, as is the manner in
which people are exposed to the criminal justice
system and treated at their arrest. It is also impor-
tant that all victims, regardless of the nature of
the offence, have an opportunity to participate at
a level at which they feel comfortable.

Restorative justice processes can provide
bene
ﬁ
ts to victims, offenders and communities of
interest, regardless of the place and time in rela-
tion to the event. Using Howard Zehr’s
(
1990
)
approach from his seminal text Changing Lenses,
the RJ process looks at the following: (1) how the
process can assist victims of crime and those who
have offended against them; (2) how the situation
can be resolved; (3) what do the people involved
feel about it; (4) what needs to happen to put
things right; (5) who is going to do it. The ques-
tion then remains, can we live and work with a
variety of restorative practices that bring sus-
tained or even short-term bene
ﬁ
ts to victims of
crime, offenders and their surrounding communi-
ties of interest, and yet are more dif
ﬁ
cult to iden-
tify and evaluate? The answer is perhaps more
about being positive, than a direct “yes”. A pre-
vailing lack of perceived fairness and due process
is often noted among participants of current
adversarial services, and has certainly raised con-
cerns amongst the judiciary in Australia. As
Malcolm
(
2004
:2) states:

For society to maintain its respect for the law, the
law must bear relevance to the society to which it
is applied. There are many occasions upon which a
judge is required to decide what is just, what is fair
or what is reasonable. In cases of that kind a judge
necessarily seeks to apply basic values representa-
tive of community values. In doing so, he or she


381

c Region: Acting Fairly, Being Just
cannot merely re
ﬂ
ect transient shifts in public
opinion …Judges should not be in
ﬂ
uenced by a
temporary shift in public opinion or by prejudice,
emotion or sentiment.

25.2

The Contentious Origins
of Restorative Justice

In response to a commonly used notion that
restorative justice has its origins among
Indigenous and First Nations people of Canada,
Australia and New Zealand, Cunneen
(
2007
)
identi
ﬁ
es Indigenous and non-Indigenous sanc-
tions that are not restorative. Many of these are
traditional sanctions. According to Cuneen,
Indigenous punishments for wrongdoing may
include “temporary or permanent exile, with-
drawal and separation within or from the com-
munity, public shaming of the individual, and
restitution by the offender and/or their kin. Some
sanctions may involve physical punishment such
as beating or spearing”. The Australian experi-
ence supports Cuneen’s argument as many of
Australia’s traditional Aboriginal people, living
in remote areas, still use tribal punishment as
well as reparations and restoration. In addition to
tribal forms of punishment, there is widespread
belief that practices such as community forums
and healing circles are closely linked to
Indigenous peoples, New Zealand’s Maori

people, Australian Aboriginal and American First
Nation cultures where people had to come face to
face with other members of their community to
settle disputes and put things right. In addition to
these particular Indigenous peoples, we acknowl-
edge and value the many other Indigenous peo-
ples of the Asia Paci
ﬁ
c region who also have
practices that include many components of what
we now call restorative justice.

Many of these local practices may not be
immediately recognized as the prevailing aca-
demic notion of de
ﬁ
nitions of restorative justice
but they are local practices that provide processes
to which people agree, meeting the desired out-
comes of mutually agreed settlement following a
dispute. These local cultural ways of being fair
and just demonstrate, for many Indigenous peo-
ple in the Asia Paci
ﬁ
c region, that they have con-
tinued their traditional ways of dealing with
disputes in a way that seeks to restore harmony in
a process considered and experienced as fair and
just. Restorative processes throughout the Asia
Paci
ﬁ
c region often utilize deep traditional and
cultural ways of striking a balance, making things
fair, replacing what is lost or stolen, and making
good following harm. In other words, living in
harmony with others and nature. Throughout his-
tory, these processes have been fundamental
among many peoples for resolving localized dis-
putes and crimes. This was the social contract
and inclusion that helped people to desist from
harmful acts, belonging to community where
rules bound people together. In terms of Confucian
philosophy and its compatibility to restorative
justice, Ozawa
(
2006
) identi
ﬁ
es certain values as
being similar. These are:

Compassion (“ren”);
ﬁ
lial piety (“xiao”); righ-
teousness (“yi”); propriety (“li”); loyalty (“chung”)
and reciprocity (“shu”). In this schema of life, for
example, “reciprocity” sees persons not so much as
individuals, but as persons caught up in an intricate
web of relationships.

Conversely, many people believe that restor-
ative justice originated in Western culture embed-
ded within a more formalized Judeo-Christian
framework. This process highlighted a variety of
alternatives to revenge and retribution, moving
towards notions of balance, being fair, and deliv-
ering just outcomes by law. The “giving back” or
replacing what was stolen was a part of commu-
nity living, especially among small social groups
such as villages where people were generally
known to each other.

Braithwaite
(
1999 :2) contends that restorative
justice has been the dominant model of criminal
justice throughout most of human history for all
the world’s peoples. Bottoms
(
1999
) however
argues that in pre-modern societies, the resolu-
tion of local disputes were more varied than
restorative justice advocates and practitioners
suggest, noting that many processes maintained a
high degree of threat, coercion and punishment.
Both arguments hold certain truths historically
and in contemporary society. The notion of the
common good is also re
ﬂ
ected in these discussions


382
B. Steels and D. Goulding
as social connections of family and community
hold together the values that lend themselves to
the larger social and moral order. Although Blagg

(
1997
)  remains critical of many of the restorative
justice practices being claimed as Indigenous,
suggesting that there is a process of re-colonizing
by justice systems which further exploit
Indigenous practices. He argues that states con-
tinue to colonize communities by using these
techniques to impose new law and order regimes
under the guise of “traditional”. In support of
Blagg’s argument, Daly
(
2002
:48) claims:

If the
ﬁ
rst form of human justice was “restorative
justice”, then advocates can claim a need to recover
it from a history of “takeover” by state- sponsored
“retributive justice”. By identifying current indig-
enous practices as “restorative justice”, advocates
can claim a need to recover these practices from a
history of “takeover” by white colonial powers
who instituted retributive justice.

Indeed, Blagg’s argument rings true, for we
often witness the homogenizing of practices
through the use of international trainers who visit
vastly different cultural groups and impose their
own Western concepts and values without explor-
ing and valuing local and traditional processes.
This effectively subsumes local knowledge and
experience under the guise of Western best prac-
tice. Cunneen
(
1999a,
b
) also maintains that
amongst Aboriginal and First Nation cultures the
processes of Indigenous governance are crucial
so that local people and their communities can
play an important role in their own justice pro-
cesses and, as a result, empower and decolonize
their knowledge base. Replacing colonial forms
of justice with local Indigenous community rep-
resentation means that perpetrators and their vic-
tims are more likely to comply and engage with
the social contract generated from the restorative
process. Although this is a delicate path to walk,
it is one that the authors have experienced
(Goulding and Steels
2006
; Steels
2008
)
.

In terms of criminal justice systems, there is
already a Western hegemony at play with the
general acceptance that Western systems of jus-
tice are better, more ef
ﬁ
cient and more effective.
Western court structures are built around the jury
system with the rules and regulations of coloniza-
tion following the various wars and imposition of
the victor’s rules and practices of doing justice.
Within the authors’ jurisdiction of Western
Australia, there is a current conversation that
regards juries as being rather ineffective. The
jury system, according to McCusker (2009:2)
, is
so outdated that it “leads to unjust convictions
and to guilty people being acquitted”.

25.3

The Asia Paci
ﬁ
c Region

The Singaporean legal system was originally
based on British colonial forms of justice, result-
ing in many negative consequences. However,
Ozawa
(
2006
) contends that today:

…the courts of Singapore are of the belief that
courts are not dealing simply with complex legal
matters but with complex human relationships
within an overall context of societal values based
on religious and moral traditions. It is not recidi-
vism which is the touchstone of Singaporean jus-
tice, but rather the redemption of individuals from
lives which violate high norms of interpersonal
behaviour.

In New Zealand, too, Judge McElrae
(
2010
:2),

an experienced restorative justice practitioner,
claims that:

…restorative justice offers a quite different view of
victims’ interests, one that is not necessarily
opposed to that of offenders—and can produce
“win-win” outcomes. They are actually what is
aimed at every time. If the Courts could more con-
sistently show that victims’ interests can be catered
for in meaningful ways (not token ways like victim
impact statements), and that their needs are better
addressed in this way, much of the pressure for
tougher sentences would fall away.

As previously mentioned, many nations within
the Asia Paci
ﬁ
c region have a history of being
dominated in one form or another. Their justice
systems have not escaped this domination. The
authors note the ways in which practitioners, aca-
demics and researchers from these regions can
provide a unique insight into what has worked at
the grass roots level amongst local Indigenous
peoples. These restorative justice practitioners
provide some degree of fairness and justice, giv-
ing a voice to those who have been harmed as


383
25 Restorative Justice in the Asia Paci
ﬁ
c Region: Acting Fairly, Being Just
well as those people who may have brought harm
upon others. Such restorative practices are often
claimed as local, culturally appropriate or tradi-
tional within the aforementioned regions.
Restorative processes have resonance with both
communities and governments in an attempt to
break away from the retributive justice processes
that have engulfed them. In many cases these
regional nations have, at one time or another,
experienced similar colonizing in
ﬂ
uences to
those of Australia and New Zealand. Morris

(
2002
:598) reminds us that “restorative justice
encourages cultural relativity and sensitivity
rather than cultural dominance”.

For many people, being more restorative is
initially more about a personal rather than a state
issue, regardless of whether it is Asian, European
or Indigenous. Many nation states within the Asia
Paci
ﬁ
c region agree that what matters most is the
ability to make things better, and to produce har-
mony where there is con
ﬂ
ict following criminal
acts or anti-social behaviour. Whilst the state has
the mechanism to intervene, local actions are
often more desirable, effective and experienced
by the people as fair and just processes and out-
comes. Indeed, in Chinese culture, Chi-Kong Lee

(
2008
) claims that the ancient Bao-Gu and tradi-
tional mediation systems re
ﬂ
ect many aspects of
contemporary restorative justice. These systems
seek to restore feelings of safety and personal
dignity amongst victims, encourage feelings of
responsibility amongst offenders, thus facilitat-
ing their successful reintegration into the com-
munity. Moreover, Chi-Kong Lee states that:

1.
The “Bao-Gu” system establishes the base of
non-lawsuit practice, so that the social relation
that had been broken by the offence can be
restored. This helps reinforce social stability
in the community and alleviates the con
ﬂ
ict
between the offender and the victim.

2.
The application of the “Bao-Gu” system, like
restorative justice, can spare
ﬁ
nancial resources
of criminal justice system, especially in reduc-
ing the costs of imprisonment.

Pranis
(
2010
:4) suggests that when a commu-
nity can “draw on and trust its own inner resources
to discover the validity of a new paradigm, the
community is liberated from bondage from old
embedded,
ﬁ
xated ways of being in the world”. It
becomes clear that regardless of local policies
and the political ambitions of a few, the commu-
nity is then, according to Pranis (ibid), “…able to
embrace the creativity of chaos, the possibility of
dreams”. People are then “empowered to imagine
new ways of being, to problem solve on a deep
level” (ibid). Meanwhile, from New Zealand,
Judge McElrae
(
2010
)
:3) gives hope that the
criminal justice system will be able to “…deliver
justice for all, not just for defendants, and that the
courts will be left to get on with the job of judg-
ing according to the law and applying principles
of respect and compassion for all”.

Further, the authors claim that these principles
can re
ﬂ
ect the underpinning values within juris-
dictions. For example, Ozawa
(
2006
:78) claims
that “with a population drawn from ancestral
roots in China, Malaysia, India and other parts of
Asia and Southeast Asia, and populated with reli-
gions of the region (mostly Buddhist, but also
Christian, Muslim, and Hindu), Singapore is also
infused with Confucian values. In addition,
throughout the region, informal as well as formal
ways of dealing with wrongdoing are used. These
are often re
ﬂ
ective of family and community
needs and dealt with in a holistic fashion. For
example, in Singapore, Ozawa
(

2003
:65) con-
tends, “…this is a society which [is] not bred of
retaliatory rules nor simply reduced to fear of
legal sanctions, but steeped in the heart of the
citizens—a high regard for interpersonal and
familial connectivity”.

In Japan, the practice of Ji-dan has a long tradi-
tion of use as a means of con
ﬂ
ict resolution. In
contemporary Japan Ji-dan remains useful as a
process of negotiation between family members as
a way to resolve a dispute between two parties. It
may mean that no direct face-to-face meetings will
occur, but that family or trusted others will negoti-
ate for a fair and just outcome, saving face and
restoring harmonious relationships. However, it is
pertinent to note that Japanese social organization
and cultural practices are central to the success of
Ji-dan. As Komiya
(
2011
:132/133) points out:

As Japanese have obtained a sense of security by
integrating themselves with groups, they had no
choice but to strictly adhere to countless rules for


384
B. Steels and D. Goulding
group cohesiveness. In this process, the Japanese
have become a patient and orderly people, and
have successfully elevated their level of self-
control.

Certainly, it is the authors’ contention that
such elevated levels of self-control as seen in
Japan are not apparent within contemporary
Australian society where individual rights con-
tinue to subsume notions of the common good as
a societal and cultural norm.

Set among the problems that appear to have
plagued many practitioners throughout the
ﬁ
elds
of criminology, victimology, penology, and
restorative justice practices and policy is that
most often we see through a Western lens. Also,
we often hear through a Western ear that inter-
prets within a frame of colonial histories and
imperial expansionism. We are partially captured
today by the world’s marketplace of criminal jus-
tice ideas with theories and practices developed
for one culture and rolled-out to another. Steels

(
2008
:4) identi
ﬁ
es much of this as he highlights
the need for local people and their communities
to have “pertinent information readily available
to them” along with many other issues such as
“fair and just processes in which to participate in
and develop clearly de
ﬁ
ned goals that bene
ﬁ
t the
common good”.

It is timely therefore to welcome and to
acknowledge that whilst we are from different
backgrounds, we are all the experts of our own
experiences. We hold the social capital and the
collective desire to reduce harm. We are a part of
the collective problem with its local solutions.
We also have a great deal in common as we build
up our region’s ability to be effective restorative
justice practitioners, researchers and academics.
People throughout the regions know that they no
longer live in isolation and that there is much to
be learned from each other as we learn to respect
each other’s ideas, values, customs and concerns.
Some of the localized practices may not use the
term “restorative justice” but already have many
of the desired components in terms of process
and outcome. Yet at the same time, sadly, through-
out the region harsh and at times inhumane pun-
ishments remain. These are (in no particular order
of importance): the over-use of prison against
minority groups and marginalized people, the
devaluing of Indigenous tribal and language
groups and the powerful use of state sanction.
These factors often disallow or remove victims’
rights and due process at law, diminish offenders’
rights and responsibilities and negate the notion
of natural justice. Conversely, in many jurisdic-
tions, the people are calling for discussions
around their justice systems, to deliver fair and
justice processes for all participants, in a safe and
equitable framework.

The Asia Paci
ﬁ
c regions hold the world’s larg-
est populations, namely China (1.3 billion) and
India (1.1 billion), along with Pakistan and
Indonesia. The regions encompass diverse cul-
tures and complex belief systems from Buddhism
with its Four Noble truths, the respectful Shinto
temples, the simplicity and complexity of Zen,
through to the mystics of India and the Teaching
of the Gita. There are also the teachings of the
Quran among the world’s most populated Muslim
country and the words of the Old and New
Testaments of Christianity as well as the teach-
ings of the Torah. The regions also include ancient
Confucianism with its philosophy of restoring
harmony and Taoism and the need for balance.
All of these belief systems exist within nation
states that can display the politics of nationalism,
communism, capitalism, juntas, democratic gov-
ernments and dictatorships. Such vast diversity
notwithstanding, the authors argue that it is still
possible to
ﬁ
nd some common ground. For exam-
ple, the global ability to help others in times of
anguish and disaster that often crosses national
boundaries. Trying to keep a balance between yin
and yang in the maintenance of harmony impacts
upon the young as well as the elderly and knows
no limits. Bloodlines can stretch far across land
and seas and it is these interconnections that
highlight the many ancient traditions working
together with modern practices. They bring into
the twenty-
ﬁ
rst century the Asian Paci
ﬁ
c prac-
tices of harmony and peace with the self, among
others, within local villages, small communities
and peaceful co-existence between nations.

On the other hand, con
ﬂ
icts, competition and
disunity abound, causing fractures in relation-
ships that bring harm to individuals, communities


385
25 Restorative Justice in the Asia Paci
ﬁ
c Region: Acting Fairly, Being Just
and even nations. Today within the region, nation
states attempt to heal the wounds of the past, to
reconcile, to rebuild and strengthen good and
harmonious relationships through respect and
with integrity. Restorative practices within the
region already encourage planning and
ﬁ
nancing
of resources and energy on positive intervention
programs, providing rehabilitation within com-
munities, including and prioritizing support for
victims. The traditional Chinese emphasis for
example, as pointed out by Van Wormer
(
2008
:3)
is on “harmony between persons and on the unity
of humanity with nature. In
ﬂ
uenced by Confucian
communitarian ideology, the Chinese criminal
justice system relies on grassroots committees to
provide social control and to resolve con
ﬂ
ict”.
These and other restorative practices help to heal
fractures within families, provide wellness and
harmony and promote the Asia Paci
ﬁ
c paradigm
within a sociological, psychological and crimino-
logical context. This is indeed the foundation of
restorative practices, deeply rooted in the Asia
Paci
ﬁ
c fabric, interwoven into the daily lives and
played out in day-to-day experiences of being
fair and just.

Many traditional ways of restoring justice
within a fair process have been retained by local
people of the region, including but not limited to,
small rural communities in India, Pakistan,
Taiwan, Indonesia and Malaysia. In China, many
disputants use traditional non-judicial processes
whereby parties to a dispute may not face each
other but are represented by a close family mem-
ber who then speaks through a negotiator to the
other party’s relative. In turn, the negotiator
speaks to the relative or representative acting on
behalf of the other person at the centre of the dis-
pute. It is a shuttle-style mediation that has a deep
history within Chinese culture and is located out-
side of the state sanctioned system. Following on
from this, Liu and Palermo
(
2009
:51) contend
that “…the Chinese Confucian legal tradition
lends high promise for the development of restor-
ative justice in China”. Whilst Liu and Palermo
make it clear that “few studies have analyzed and
speci
ﬁ
cally identi
ﬁ
ed those speci
ﬁ
c philosophi-
cal ideas and principles of the Chinese traditional
legal culture which encourage restorative justice
values and practices”, the philosophy is currently
seen as valuable. In addition, Braithwaite

(
2002
:22) indicates that “Confucius is the most
important philosopher of restorative justice” and
has long argued that such philosophies are seen
as valid to the region’s restorative practices. Liu
and Palermo
(
2009
:51/52) also make the point
that “The Confucian legal tradition was secular
and largely informal… Humanity and the human
world were the focus of Confucian philosophy”
where “ideal harmonious human-society rela-
tionships and harmonious human-nature relation-
ships were sought”.

Liu and Palermo
(
2009
:54) add that “…when
order and harmony are disrupted by disputes and
crimes, the
ﬁ
nal objective of the law is to restore
that order and harmony, to restore the relation-
ships to their original state”. They claim that this
principle is “in essence restorative in nature” and
that by “placing social relationships over other
goals, Confucian thought coincides with modern
principles of restorative justice. Furthermore, Liu
and Palermo,
(

2009
:54) argue that the most
import aspect of Confucian principles of justice
in traditional China are that “resolution must be
fair and must respect human feelings tian li ren
qing”. Although the Confucian ideals that sup-
port harmony through wu song (no law suit), are
seen today in contemporary Chinese criminal
justice circles as being “implemented at the
expense of individual interests and legal rights”
(ibid). The ancient and traditional way of doing
justice, one based on “morality, feelings and rea-
sonableness” (ibid) is at odds with prevailing
Western legal principles now used within Chinese
mainstream justice. The obvious tensions caused
by any criminal act are now viewed as a break in
the relationship with the state, rather than a break
in the social relationship between human beings.
This is as noticeable throughout China as it is
elsewhere in the region.

Certainly, it is important to note, that we do
not have enough evidence of whether these tradi-
tional practices reduce the likelihood of repeat
offending, or if the people who use these methods
are more satis
ﬁ
ed with the process and outcome
than if they went through the formal justice sys-
tem. What we do know is that such practices hold


386
B. Steels and D. Goulding
some of the key ingredients of being fair and just,
of restoring a balance, producing harmony and
reducing fear. These traditional restorative pro-
cesses warrant more in depth research in order to
ascertain their real impact, if any, on rates of
recidivism, victim, offender and community sat-
isfaction, and victims’ mental health outcomes.

25.4

Underpinning Theories

Tyler
(
1990
;
2006

)
claims that people are more
likely to comply with the social sanctions imposed
on them when they feel that they have experienced
fair and just process, even if the outcome is differ-
ent to what they desired. Often the use of tradi-
tional methods that, at
ﬁ
rst glance, appear not to
have due process or just outcomes are more accept-
able within a local context where informal rather
than formal criminal justice processes are used. It
is this apparent lack of faith in mainstream crimi-
nal justice systems to deliver fair and just outcomes
that encourage the development of alternative
paths. Perceptions of fairness are crucial to the
legitimacy of the criminal justice process, for as
Tyler
(
1990
:172) indicates, being “unfairly treated”
disrupts “the relationship of legitimacy to compli-
ance” even more than “receiving poor outcomes”.
In other words, all participants involved in a crimi-
nal offence or fracturing of relationships (offender,
victim, community of interest) ought to be in a
position to feel as though they are being treated
fairly and with respect. Such acceptance would
apply to many local practices, including Ji-dan.
We also know that many people do not experience
our current adversarial regimes as fair and just
from the point of arrest though to sentencing and
beyond. Victims are frequently left outside of the
process as well as, in many jurisdictions, being
used as a tool of the prosecution. For all partici-
pants, process is always paramount. Wholly restor-
ative processes are designed to provide fair and
just process, one that responds to local values,
human rights and fair treatment of others in and
around their community. Ideally, they should
re
ﬂ
ect local practices, ensure fair and just treat-
ment that takes note of grassroots values, and pro-
vide conversations around human rights and
protection of both victim and perpetrator.

It is now more than a decade into the new
millennium and throughout the world a great
many people are calling upon their governments
to deliver justice in a more transparent, fair and
just way, through a process that recognizes their
human rights. They demand a cultural change
from their local police services, courts, parole
boards and community justice agents. This is
particularly true from minority communities
and the most marginalized people. In a regional
sense, as Morris
(
2002
:598) contends, “restor-
ative justice also emphasizes human rights and
the need to recognize the impact of social or
substantive injustice and in small ways address
these rather than simply provide offenders with
legal and formal justice and victims with no jus-
tice at all”. Although many of these discussions
can be applied today within the broad social
movement of restorative justice and penal
reform, the conversation often relies heavily
upon the Western perspective, leaving out many
of the Asia Paci
ﬁ
c peoples who are able to sup-
ply a wealth of experience in settling local dis-
putes by community means. People within the
region have witnessed change where national
disputes have often fuelled vicious oppression
by brute force and violence. Reclaiming “old
and wise ways” has always had a place among
people within the region where wisdom, age,
and harmony are valued conditions that lend
themselves to resilience.

Any focus on the treatment and rehabilitation
of people ought always to consider the use of a
broader lens, embracing both victims and offend-
ers. A combination of therapeutic and restorative
practice can provide an opportunity for offenders
and victims to feel satis
ﬁ
ed with both process and
outcomes. A major thread in the fabric of respon-
sibility taking amongst offenders is the challenge
to decrease “neutralization” (Sykes and Matza

1957
:664) a practice central to the therapeutic
process. Neutralization is de
ﬁ
ned as a denial of
personal responsibility. In their work with juve-
niles, Sykes and Matza recognized a variety of
strategies whereby offenders deny their responsi-
bility for a criminal activity; denial of responsi-
bility, denial of injury, denial of victim,
condemnation of the condemners, and appeal to
higher loyalties.


387
25 Restorative Justice in the Asia Paci
ﬁ
c Region: Acting Fairly, Being Just

That said, Cunneen
(
1999a,
b
) mentions that
there is often a degree of neutralization that can
be found amongst First Nation communities
where there is a level of resentment and disregard
for what is often perceived as an unjust colonial
authority. This provides an opportunity for peo-
ple to neutralize behaviour by what Sykes and
Matza
(
1957
:664) view as “condemn the con-
demners”. Further to this, and in line with other
underpinning practices which identify positive
lifestyle opportunities for offenders, Maruna and
Immarigeon
(
2004
;6) contend that “the major
correlates of desistance from crime identi
ﬁ
ed in
research…involve ongoing, interactive relation-
ships that can take up most of an individuals wak-
ing life”. Farrall
(
1995
:23) also found that, in
general terms, “…desistance occurs away from
the criminal justice system”. In short, social rela-
tionships are seen to be central to restoring jus-
tice, both for victims and offenders especially
when crime is viewed as a fracture of relation-
ships within a community. Further to this,
Braithwaite
(
1989
) argues that re-integrative
shaming is most effective when used in the pres-
ence of “relatives, friends or a personally relevant
collectivity” largely because “repute in the eyes
of close acquaintances matters more to people
than the opinions or actions of criminal justice
of
ﬁ
cials”. Tyler
(
2006
:307) also provides support
to the argument that close family and friends, the
crucial supportive network, provide a bene
ﬁ
t, not
just in terms of human resources but also as a
mechanism
of
improving
self-image
and
compliance:

The restorative justice conference seeks to moti-
vate such immediate and future behaviour by sepa-
rating the “good” person from their “bad” conduct.
The conferences then seek to both deal with the
consequences of the bad conduct and, separately,
to connect the good person to their motivation to
behave in ways that win respect from their family,
friends, and community. It is this connection with
one’s favourable self-image that motivates compli-
ance in the future.

Most restorative justice processes that are
practiced today, regardless of region or culture,
have a level of shaming, generally enough to
highlight dissatisfaction with the offender’s
behaviour, whilst giving positive regard to the
person. This forms the underpinning philosophy
of restorative justice, that of re-integrative sham-
ing (as opposed to “disintegrative or stigmatic”
shaming) of offenders in an environment of safety
and support. As Braithwaite
(
1989
:55) contends:

Re-integrative shaming means that expres-
sions of community disapproval, which may
range from mild rebuke to degradation ceremo-
nies, are followed by gestures of reacceptance
into the community of law-abiding citizens.
These gestures of reacceptance will vary from a
simple smile expressing forgiveness and love to
quite formal ceremonies to decertify the offender
as deviant. Disintegrative shaming (stigmatiza-
tion), in contrast, divides the community by cre-
ating a class of outcasts.

Combined, the above transformative and
restorative constructs encourage a sense of chal-
lenge to offenders’ neutralisations, and provide
them with an opportunity to feel satis
ﬁ
ed with
both the process and outcomes. This last point
meets Tyler’s
(
1990
:172) notion that fair process
is crucial to the legitimacy of the criminal justice
process, for as he indicates, being “unfairly
treated” disrupts “the relationship of legitimacy
to compliance” even more than “receiving poor
outcomes”. Victims and offenders, together with
supporters, can bene
ﬁ
t from such processes for,
as previous research has indicated, they provide
all parties greater satisfaction with process and
outcome (Beven et al.
2005
)
.

The following comments from Western
Australian Chief Stipendiary Magistrate Heath
1
suggest that the restorative process used within a
community group conference model of restor-
ative justice trialled in his court was a valuable
resource for the court as well as being bene
ﬁ
cial
to offender, victim and community. He claimed
that:

The restorative and transformative justice pilot has
provided a rare opportunity to receive an indepen-
dent report of the interaction between the victim, the
offender and their families or friends after the
offence. In that way it goes beyond the matters that

ative and transformative justice project carried out by

might be contained in an outline of the facts, a victim
impact statement or a plea in mitigation. It provides
the Court with valuable information, particularly in
determining whether there are matters which will
make a sentence other than one of imprisonment
appropriate. It is a valuable tool in the context of
therapeutic jurisprudence in forcing offenders to
confront problems with their families and peers and
has on occasion uncovered issues not otherwise
apparent to those dealing with the offender.


Court based restorative processes are often
strengthened in their objectives when combined
with transformative or therapeutic processes as in
the aforementioned pilot study. These combined
processes provided the offender with encourage-
ment and support through relevant therapeutic
interventions and personal healing. In this way
the victim was able to regain feelings of personal
safety together with the support necessary to
meaningfully engage in the process and not just
respond as a tool of the prosecution. It is often
dif
ﬁ
cult to recognize that throughout these con-
structs, victims and offenders can experience the
court as a place that is able to assist with their
personal healing and well-being. As Winick

(
2003
:26) claims, “…therapeutic jurisprudence
suggests that law should value psychological
health, should strive to avoid imposing anti-ther-
apeutic consequences whenever possible, and
when consistent with other values served by law,
should attempt to bring about healing and well-
ness”. These restorative and transformative pro-
cesses constitute a paradigm shift from the
traditional view of the presiding court of
ﬁ
cer as a
punishing law enforcer to that of one who, with
adequately resourced supports,
ﬁ
nds solutions to
problems and tries to make right and fair that
which has been seen to be wrong. This is a pro-
cess that addresses the common good, collaborat-
ing and utilizing the many cultural and traditional
ways in which people experience justice.

25.5

Personal Journeys
and Re
ﬂ
ections

The aim here is to draw attention to and, an aware-
ness of, the wealth and diversity of Asian and
Paci
ﬁ
c regional processes that in
ﬂ
uence personal
and group harmony and adherence to the social
contract. As previously mentioned, there are many
links between the personal beliefs and social val-
ues that are in tune with a more Asian Paci
ﬁ
c view
of restorative practices. It is from this perspective
that we hope to expand the wealth of practices
that are seen to be fair, just and equitable, recog-
nizing victims’ and offenders’ rights to dignity
and support. We argue that it is incumbent upon
regional practitioners and academics, community
groups, governments, non-government organiza-
tions and not-for-pro
ﬁ
t organizations to engage
together via various networks, in order to explore
the wealth of locally based practices that bring
about fairness and justice to people.

The ability to re
ﬂ
ect rationally upon our
actions and those of others is often the starting
point after we have caused harm or experienced
being harmed by another. It is a crucial time to be
able to have the space to review our lifestyle, to
think of cause and effect, to think of what has
occurred and to go over in our head those often
catastrophic and de
ﬁ
ning moments. As Sykes
and Matza
(
1957
) found, it is at this point that
many offenders attempt to neutralize their behav-
iour, shifting blame and responsibility to others,
including the victim. Re
ﬂ
ection on our criminal
and anti-social behaviour, our relationships and
our lifestyle can lead us towards personal trans-
formation and positive personal growth. For those
who have experienced being victimized by
another, it is often a period of anger, of question-
ing, of feelings of being let down, anxiety, and a
need for answers. Re
ﬂ
ection itself often becomes
a traumatic experience, one that may require sup-
port of family and/or friends. It often comes as a
revelation to people as they recount the conse-
quence of their actions and engage with their
feelings, that they may be seen in a less favour-
able light by others than they would wish.
However, as Tyler
(
2006
:307) states:

The restorative justice approach focuses on engag-
ing people’s feelings of responsibility to their family
and community. It argues that when people feel that
they have damaged their image in the eyes of others,
this has destructive consequences for themselves.


Indeed, as Ahmed and Braithwaite et al.
(
2006
)
claim, “the effectiveness of restorative justice,


389
25 Restorative Justice in the Asia Paci
ﬁ
c Region: Acting Fairly, Being Just
however, largely depends on the degree to which
some key relational parameters can be altered,
speci
ﬁ
cally acknowledgment of wrongdoing,
awareness of harm done”. For some of us, revela-
tion comes about as we discuss our problems
with others, as we read from our books of faith
and from our personal encounters among family
and friends. We may
ﬁ
nd as we recount past
events that have brought us harm, that we have
good people around us who are there for us, and
in this revelation that we are not to blame for
whatever has happened to us, and that we can be
empowered by these thoughts that lead us to react
positively to ourselves once again.

Being resentful is understandable whilst we
are in the space that follows being harmed by oth-
ers, or even harming others, feeling or showing
indignation and displeasure with ourselves or
with another. We may even be resentful towards
the way in which we have acted. In most circum-
stances it takes courage to let go of this emotion
that often prevents us from healing regardless of
whether we are the victim or offender. Being
resentful towards other people who have hurt us
or who still bring harm to us is common. However,
this emotion can become debilitating and can
impact negatively on positive mental health out-
comes but it clearly demonstrates how crime
impacts upon both one’s self and our social net-
works. Rejecting some of our past ways and con-
sidering the thoughts of others may well contribute
to an ability to move on and transform our lives.
Rejection of past negative practices can afford us
the ability to
ﬁ
nd more a more harmonious way
of being and a greater understanding of ourselves
in relation to others. The desire to reform our-
selves is a critical point for us all. It comes about
as we tip the balance of the scales and understand
that the past ways are unhelpful and that there is
another way, perhaps a better way to engage with
others and to do things in a more positive light.

Taking responsibility for one’s actions is cen-
tral to the process of restorative justice. As
Braithwaite
(
1996
:13) notes, taking responsibil-
ity for one’s actions works towards “restoring
victims, a more victim-centred criminal justice
system, as well as restoring offenders and restor-
ing community”. Once we can say “yes, I am
sorry for my actions that have harmed others”,
we are on our personal path to restore harmony
into our life and hopefully restore harmony
among others. It is in this seeking to bring about
personal peace and harmony that gives us direc-
tion. As Zehr
(
1990
:24) points out:

Crime is in essence a violation: a violation of the
self, a desecration of who we are, of what we
believe, of our private space. Crime is devastating
because it upsets two fundamental assumptions on
which we base our lives: our belief that the world
is an orderly, meaningful place, and our belief in
personal autonomy. Both assumptions are essential
for wholeness.

Forgiveness comes to the individual by both
internal and external means. That is, we have the
power to forgive or to withhold forgiveness. As
offenders we rely upon outside sources to enter
into the state of being forgiven. Repentance, on
the other hand, directs us to a change of direction.
Within the spiritual context it can often mean
doing what is required for us to turn back to the
spiritual path that we may have left as an offender
or as a victim of crime. Repentance is more akin
to a change of heart or a change of mind that sets
us back on track, an ability to re
ﬂ
ect and trans-
form our ways. It often begins with a regret. For
some of us this could mean placing
ﬂ
owers at a
shrine, saying sorry to those we have harmed,
going along to the mosque or temple to acknowl-
edge the existence of a higher being, or going to
ask pardon from our ancestors for the shame that
we have brought upon them. Some form of per-
sonal confession to loved ones usually precedes
this.

Within restorative justice, respect comes about
as we engage with others, present the truth and
seek a way to make things right. Respect comes
in many packages. It comes as a way of thinking
about ourselves, ensuring that we do things that
help us to become or remain respected. It comes
as we think of the way others have treated us
respectfully and how with think respectfully of
them. We can receive, give and earn respect.
Others often see respect as a product of doing the
right thing. Respect moves beyond admiration.
Respect for the self is seen as essential in many
philosophies. Apology and reparation in one


390
B. Steels and D. Goulding
form or another are also essential components of
restorative processes. This is often about putting
things right, repairing damage, and attempting to
make amends. These are all parts of apology and
reparation. Reparation can also be applied to
work done to make up for the harm caused.
Restitution is often closely related to making a

ﬁ
nancial settlement to assist a victim of crime, or
their family. It can also be a way in which a per-
son or company covers the cost to the community
following a personal or corporate crime or harm-
ful action. Justice cannot be restored or fairness
experienced if there is no effort made to provide
apology, reparation and restitution.

Rehabilitation and a welcoming back to fam-
ily and/or community are essential elements in
the
ﬁ
nal step of restoring social harmony. The
notion behind rehabilitating a person, corpora-
tion or environment is usually meant to convey a
return to good ways, better health and well-being,
or to provide assistance to a person who has been
removed from their family or community. Within
the context of restorative justice it may apply to a
person who has experienced guilt or equally it
may apply to a person who has experienced feel-
ings of being unsafe following harm done to
them. Both are in need of support to re-engage
positively with their everyday lives. Reconnecting
with their spiritual path or doing good works as a
part of their re-commitment to their community
are all part of personal rehabilitation, transforma-
tion and renewal.

Reconciliation can be de
ﬁ
ned in several ways.
At one level it is a process by which individuals
have an understanding or agreement with another.
Within another perspective it is a place where peo-
ple are in harmony with themselves, their belief
systems and their environment. Tyler
(
2006
) main-
tains that “by seeking to separate out and repair the
damaged self while condemning the destructive
action, the restorative conference has the goal of
building positive connections to one’s family,
friends, and community”. In addition, Ahmed and
Braithwaite
(
2006
) suggest that stigmatization and
the concern that a person is likely to re-offend, may
be countered by notions of forgiveness and recon-
ciliation. Ahmed and Braithwaite go on to claim
that an absence of forgiveness and reconciliation
“destroys the chance to build the emotional
scaffolding that is needed to boost self-regulation”.
They note that practitioners of restorative pro-
cesses, working within the formal institutional
structures, ought to focus on “conditions that enable
forgiveness, reconciliation, and adaptive shame
management to take place”.


25.6

Conclusion

The personal and professional journeys towards
restorative justice being undertaken throughout
the region provide an opportunity for local and
regional restorative justice practices to grow and
become entrenched as a central component of
mainstream criminal justice systems. The
in
ﬂ
uence of a restorative ethos on retributive
criminal justice systems would effectively pro-
duce fairer, more equitable and just policies and
practices, delivering positive and supportive ser-
vices to those who wish to participate.

It is
ﬁ
tting to conclude with the wise words of
the architect of South Africa’s Truth and
Reconciliation Council, a fervent supporter of
restorative processes and the healing powers of
forgiveness, Archbishop Desmond Tutu (cited in
Stern
2006
:153):

A criminal offence has caused a breach in relation-
ship and the purpose of the penal process is to heal
the breach, to restore good relationships and to
redress the balance. Thus it is that we set out to
work for reconciliation between the victim and the
perpetrator. There may be sanctions such as
ﬁ
ne or
short exile but the fundamental purpose of the
entire exercise is to heal. In the retributive justice
process the victim is forgotten in what can be a
very cold and impersonal way of doing things. In
restorative justice both the victim and the offender
play central roles. Restorative Justice is singularly
hopeful…

Introduction

Restorative justice (RJ) has developed and grown
rapidly in recent decades with the emergence of
principles, standards, and new intervention prac-
tices for criminal justice and school initiatives
(Braithwaite and Mugford

. Over the past 20
years, various restorative practices have been
developed to help offenders, particularly juvenile
offenders, take responsibility for their crimes and
make appropriate reparation for what they have
done to their victims and communities (Harris

2008
; Johnstone and Van Ness

)
. Though many countries are pur-
suing RJ practices as new initiatives for dealing
with youth offenders, little documentation exists
on the use of RJ in the People’s Republic of China
(PRC). This article begins by describing the cur-
rent juvenile justice system. It then highlights
how RJ was conceived and its role in juvenile jus-
tice intervention. The article also analyzes the
evolution of restorative practices by referring to
journal articles from an academic PRC database
and examines the factors conducive to the emer-
gence of restorative practices in the PRC. Finally,
the trends in RJ development are discussed.

Changing Juvenile Justice
in the PRC

Article 17 of the PRC’s Criminal Law establishes
14 as the minimum age of criminal responsibility
and 18 as the age of full legal accountability.
A juvenile under 14 bears no criminal responsi-
bility. Juveniles between 14 and 16 are liable only
when they have committed 8 types of serious
crimes, including homicide, aggravated assault,
robbery, rape, arson, drug traf
ﬁ
cking, bombing,
or poisoning. A person over 16 bears full crimi-
nal responsibility but is exempt from the death
penalty if under 18. Essentially, anybody 16 or
older who commits a crime bears full criminal
responsibility.

The PRC’s principle of “Education, Reform,
and Rescue” has been a guiding principle in the
treatment of deviant juveniles and youth offend-
ers. Education is generally recognized as the pri-
mary means of delinquency prevention, while
punishments such as “reform and rescue” are
regarded as a complement to education. The

concept of “double protection” is highly valued:
this practice protects social order while also
emphasizing the protection of juveniles. The
PRC’s Criminal Code lays down two important
legal principles—leniency and the inapplicability
of the death penalty to juvenile offenders. The
PRC’s criminal justice system endeavors to
uphold juvenile delinquents’ accountability for
what they have done while giving them a chance
to be rehabilitated and reintegrated into society
(Zhao
2001
)
.

Over the past few decades, English-language
studies on the PRC’s juvenile justice and delin-
quency law reform have been rather limited.
Hindered by tight state control of information
sharing, the PRC’s scholars and governmental
of
ﬁ
cials seldom presented papers at international
conferences before the 2000s. With the PRC’s
increased political openness, scholars can access
useful information more easily. English-language
literature discussing the PRC’s legal, crimino-
logical, and juvenile justice matters have become
more common since the early 1990s (Biddulph

1993
; Clark
1989
; Curran and Cook
1993
; He

1991
; Kuan and Brosseau

; Ogden

1992
; Rojek
1989
; Tanner
1999
; Troyer

;
Wong

)
. A review of this literature suggests
that the Chinese communist leaders relied heav-
ily on the police and neighborhood public secu-
rity organs and did not trust their formal judicial
system between the 1950s and 1970s. After the
founding of the PRC in 1949, the Communist
Party of China (CPC) adhered to Marxist-Leninist
doctrine; the police and local security commit-
tees worked hand in hand to control residents’
freedom and combat crime. Both public security
organs are generally seen as important instru-
ments of the state that served the ruling class by
controlling and oppressing antagonistic classes in
the early 1960s.

Wong
(
2004
) argues that, until the 1979
reforms, the legal profession and courts were
inactive. Until the PRC committed itself to eco-
nomic reform in the early 1980s, policy makers,
by default, had to uphold an unshakeable con-
viction that the socialist state is a perfect soci-
ety. While admittedly only a transitional phase
in the construction of communism, the prelimi-
nary stage of socialism is, by de
ﬁ
nition, already
free of the characteristics that inevitably gener-
ate criminal behavior under capitalism. In such
a condition, laws are generally geared to the
construction of a collective and responsible
society; the technicalities of criminal proce-
dures and related enforcement rules are not
clearly de
ﬁ
ned. In the late 1970s, a more sophis-
ticated modern Chinese legal system came into
being along with the economic reform. At the
same time, a number of laws and legal resolu-
tions related to the protection of juveniles were
promulgated by the National People’s Congress
and its standing committee beginning in 1979.
They include the Marriage Law, Labor Law,
Law of Compulsory Education, Criminal Law,
and Criminal Procedure Law. These laws set up
principles and measures guaranteeing the rights
and interests of juveniles with respect to the
litigation process and the social and education
protection of juveniles. In particular, the
Juvenile Protection Law 1991 (JPL) and the
Preventing Juvenile Delinquency Law 1999
(PJDL) strongly relate to juvenile protection
and delinquency prevention (see Standing
Committee of the National People’s Congress

1991
;
1999
)
.

The JPL de
ﬁ
nes the duties, responsibilities,
and authority parents or guardians of a juvenile
have in relation to juvenile welfare, right of
education, and other legal rights. This law
insists on the Criminal Law’s guiding principle
of using education as the primary means and
punishment as the auxiliary means of handling
juveniles who commit crimes (Qin and Huang

2010
)
. The PJDL stipulates that a juvenile who
needs stricter control may be detained and reha-
bilitated in a juvenile detention center (com-
monly referred to as “Re-education through
Labor”) pursuant to the Criminal Law and the
JPL. Scholars (Zhao
2001
; Wong
2005
) have
asserted that the PJDL can be seen as a special
law formulated to tackle the “unhealthy behav-
ior” (i.e., minor delinquency) and “serious
unhealthy behavior” (i.e., serious delinquency)
of juveniles who are not yet convicted
offenders.

Restorative Justice Practices
and Their Link to Juvenile
Justice in the PRC

As shown in Fig.
26.1
, juvenile delinquency con-
trol occurs with the help of both informal and
formal measures. There are at least two types of
informal measures, including informal caution-
ing and
bangjiao (assisted education). In infor-
mal cautioning, the neighborhood district’s public
security organization cautions a juvenile who has
committed a minor delinquency, who is then
referred back to his or her school, parents, or
guardians for follow-up. In

cases of delinquency that do not need continuous
attention may be referred to the units under the
administration of the Education Bureau or the
local neighborhood committees for follow-up.

Bangjiao may be arranged by members of the
local population acting either separately or along
with local groups such as neighborhood commit-
tee members, neighborhood police, teachers, and
private company bosses. Adolescents and their
parents are usually reprimanded by the authori-
ties, with some asked to compensate their vic-
tims; they are then closely guarded and supervised
by a group of “respectable” community elders or
adult volunteers. Juveniles may also be referred
for study at residential work-study schools, which
are similar to boarding schools or delinquent
homes (Lui
1991
; Wong
1999
;
2001
)
.

For formal measures, the police, the People’s
Procuracy, and the courts are the state organs
responsible for investigation, prosecution, and
all trial proceedings. The roles and social func-
tions performed by the police and courts likely
need no further explanation. The People’s
Procuracy is a state organization with the statu-
tory power to oversee the administration of jus-
tice in its role as the investigative and supervisory
branch of the judicial system. In criminal affairs,
it is responsible not only for prosecutions but
also for supervising the legality of the entire
criminal process, from the police investigation
and preliminary hearing, through the ruling of
the court, down to the execution of the sentence.
The People’s Procuracy possesses the discretion-
ary power to divert juvenile offenders away from
prosecution by applying a measure called “sus-
pended prosecution.” This discretionary power
not to prosecute juvenile offenders has consti-
tuted the favorable conditions from which RJ has
emerged over the past few years (Wong
2005
;
Wong and Mok
2011
)
.

As shown in Fig.
26.1
, there are three main
options for dealing with convicted juvenile
offenders—suspended
sentence,
community
supervision, and custodial treatment. In a sus-
pended sentence, juveniles do not receive formal
sentencing but are given a chance to join commu-
nity reintegration programs. They are normally
reprimanded by a judge and sent back to their
own neighborhood to receive care from commu-
nity supervision teams. RJ programs may be
used in conjunction with this sentencing option.
Community supervision is normally used along
with neighborhood
bangjiao
or community cor-
rection programs.
Bangjiao
, run by neighbor-
hood committees together with local police, is
not new. However, community correction is
rather novel and unique to the PRC. Chinese
community correction teams employ “justice
social workers” to supervise and provide coun-
seling services to juvenile offenders during the
supervision period. Community correction is
applied not just to juveniles but can be used as a
community-based treatment for any offender
given a suspended sentence or for ex-inmates on
parole after serving a minimum portion of their
sentence as prescribed by a judge. It is thus a
kind of probation or after-care service order.
Interestingly, before community correction pro-
grams formally emerged,
bangjiao was the most
common form of community-based treatment
program for delinquents (Wong and Mok
2011
)
.
For custodial treatment, “Re-education through
labor” is the formal correctional program tailor-
made to incarcerate and rehabilitate juvenile
offenders in contemporary China. Convicted
juvenile offenders are sent to an institution for
between 1 and 3 years by a juvenile court. The
institution uses both work and education as
methods of reform though it places more empha-
sis on (political and moral) education and man-
datory labor than do similar institutions in Hong
Kong and the UK (Wong
2001
)
.

RJ practices can be linked to informal mea-
sures under
bangjiao
arrangements and formal
measures under suspended prosecutions and sus-
pended sentences. As a formal measure, restor-
ative practices are used in connection with
“suspended prosecutions” when the procuracy
decides not to formally prosecute the juvenile.
Wong and Mok
(
2011

)
have described some of
the PRC’s current RJ practices. They have found
that provincial and district procuracies in many
parts of China have been actively experimenting
with RJ for juvenile offender cases since 2004.


397
26 Evolution of Restorative Justice Practices for Juvenile Offenders in the People’s Republic of China
In recent years, 10 provinces and cities (including
Beijing, Shanghai, Jianzu, Shangdong, Hunan,
and Guangdong) have begun pioneer RJ projects
within their juvenile justice systems (Dong

2012

)
. For instance, some district procuracies in
Chongqing, Liaoning, and Suzhou are running
pilot programs for delinquents who have received
suspended prosecutions, and district procuracies
in Nanjian, Xuzhou, and Hebei have imple-
mented restorative projects together with com-
munity supervision for juvenile offenders (Yao

2007

)
. The feedback and evaluations have been
very encouraging. For example, the Procuratorate
of Dadukou in Chongqing, the Procuratorate of
Suzhou Industrial Park, and the People’s Court
of Gulou in Nanjing used restorative practices
for 20 juveniles in 2004, 107 juveniles in 2007,
and 66 juveniles in 2009; the juvenile offenders
all showed progress in correcting their delin-
quent acts after the restorative programs
(People’s Procuratorate of Jiangsu
2008
; Xin
Hua Net
2007
, Zhou
2010
)
. Furthermore, RJ
practices are also commonly applied to offend-
ers who have received a suspended sentence
issued by a judge. As more judges become aware
of the potential bene
ﬁ
ts of RJ for juvenile offend-
ers (Shen and Zou
2010
)
, more juveniles guilty
of less serious offences (such as assaults, prop-
erty crimes, and traf
ﬁ
c offences) are being given
a suspended sentence with the condition that
they make reparation to the victims or the com-
munity. RJ appears to be not an independent sen-
tence option but an additional condition of a
suspended sentence.

It is worth noting that RJ is not equivalent to
the services run by the PRC’s People’s Mediation
Committees. The Chinese preference for media-
tion is deeply rooted in Confucian philosophy,
which sees social con
ﬂ
ict as disruptive of the
natural order of life (Wong
1999
;
2005
)
. The
PRC’s People Mediation Committees are
responsible for handling a wide variety of dis-
putes and minor offences as well as for granting
divorces. However, they seldom deal with crimi-
nal cases even though their enabling ordinance
does not clearly forbid them from doing so.
Until the People’s Mediation Committee
Organizational Regulation was issued by the
State Council in 1989, no criminal cases, even
minor ones, were dealt with by the People’s
Mediation Committee; thus, Chinese scholars
did not link People’s Mediation cases with RJ
cases, since the former dealt only with civil cases
(Q.T. Li
2010
)
.

Before the recognition given to Western RJ
approaches such as the family group conferenc-
ing model by some English-speaking countries
in the 1990s, criminal reconciliation or media-
tion had long been used as an informal measure
for dealing with community con
ﬂ
icts and dis-
putes in the PRC. For juvenile and youth crimi-
nal cases, district authorities in some Chinese
provinces have tried to integrate values and mod-
els based on reconciliation justice into the crimi-
nal justice systems; however, no standardized
practice has yet been developed. Judicial and
legal personnel involved in community commit-
tees, public security organizations, procuracies,
judiciaries, and prisons have only recently started
to try the Western RJ approach to helping juve-
nile offenders. For example, a local committee in
Shandong province, a public security organiza-
tion in Shanghai, some procuracies in Hunan and
Yuennan provinces, a court in Beijing and
Xuzhou, and a prison in Foshan have started to
investigate and run pilot RJ programs for juve-
nile offenders (Xiao
2011
; Yao
2007
; Ye
2010
;
Zhao
2010
)
.

Among the RJ practices so far adopted, crimi-
nal reconciliation (
xingshi hejie
) seems to be the
Chinese RJ practice that shares values and a prac-
tice model with the Western RJ approach.
Criminal reconciliation is designed for offenders
who have committed minor criminal acts but who
have shown some degree of remorse during the
investigation and prosecution processes (Leng

2011
; Li
2011
; Song et al.
2009
)
. Criminal acts
such as common assault, theft, deception, and
traf
ﬁ
c offences are commonly handled through
the reconciliation method (Song
2010
)
. Some
procuracies, like the ones in Zhejiang province
and Taiyuen city, have already developed legal
documentation to guide criminal reconciliation
practices (R.S. Li
2010
)
. Although criminal


398
D.S.W. Wong and L.W.Y. Mok
reconciliation shares basic principles with RJ,
it is not equivalent to the Western practice.
The former approach emphasizes repairing the
harm done and restoring relationships, whereas
the latter focuses on seeking material compensa-
tion for victims (Chen
2009
; Zhao
2008
)
. A sub-
stantial number of PRC scholars have devoted
much time and effort to identifying the similari-
ties and differences between RJ and the PRC’s
criminal reconciliation (Di and Cha
2007
; Li

2009
; Zhao and Zhang
2012
)
. More than 24 prov-
inces, self-administrative regions, and munici-
palities have either pioneered or established a
criminal reconciliation approach since 2003 (Su
and Ma
2009
)
, though only a portion of minor
criminal cases are being handled this way. For
example, the of
ﬁ
cial statistics from the local
procuracies of Beijing City show that only 667
(14.5%) of their 4,607 minor criminal cases
were handled through criminal reconciliation in
2003 (Xiao
2011
) and that 194 cases were han-
dled through criminal reconciliation at Changde
City in Hunan province in 2010 (Tan
2011
)
.
Overall, criminal reconciliation is not yet
regarded as the primary means of handling
juvenile criminal cases. Nevertheless, as stated
in the 2010 PRC Yearbook, the Supreme
People’s Procuratorate has indicated that such a
model will de
ﬁ
nitely be developed in the near
future (Cao
2010
)
.


26.4

Evolution of Restorative
Justice in the PRC

In order to understand whether RJ is growing rap-
idly in the PRC, a literature review of Chinese aca-
demic journal articles published over the past 5
years was conducted. The review searched all schol-
arly print journals using the keywords
huifuxing sifa
(“restorative justice”) in the China Academic
Journals Full-text Database for the period between
January 1, 2006 and December 31, 2010. It was
found that 261 Chinese academic journal articles
contained the keywords; however, 9 cannot be
accessed from the Internet database. Thus, only 252
articles were printed for further content analysis.
These were obtained from 164 different academic
journals, including the renowned
Legal System and
Society
,
Legal Forum
,
Youth Studies
, and
Law and
Social Development in the PRC
.

Table
26.1 presents statistics on the themes
appearing in the articles. The research team
classi
ﬁ
ed the concepts relating to the themes
according to three levels—“frequently,” “occa-
sionally,” and “never.” For the concept of “vic-
timology,” 12.7% talked about how RJ can be
used to help victims frequently, 42.1% talked
about this occasionally, and 45.2% did not talk
about it at all (see item 1.1). Concerning how RJ
can be integrated into the current criminal justice
system, 33.7% talked about it frequently, 17.9%

Table
26.2 summarizes the distribution of the
key themes. The most commonly mentioned
theme was “RJ and Criminal Justice in the PRC,”
which accounted for 33.7%. The second most
common theme was “RJ and Chinese Philosophy
and Politics,” which accounted for 23.0%. In
decreasing
order,
15.5%
focused
on
“Development
of RJ in the West,” 15.1% on “RJ and Juvenile
Justice in the PRC,” and 12.7% on “RJ and
Victimology.”

The study also examined whether scienti
ﬁ
c
research
ﬁ
ndings, real-world examples of RJ,
and international references were quoted. Of 252
articles, 85.3% never quoted any scienti
ﬁ
c

ﬁ
ndings to support their arguments (see
Table
26.3
), 92.9% never quoted any real-world
examples of RJ as illustration (see Table
26.4
),
and 85.3% failed to cite
ﬁ
ve or more interna-
tional references (see Table
26.5
). However, the
concept of
“building a harmonious society” pro-
nounced by Hu Jintao, President of the PRC, was
frequently quoted. Of the 252 articles, 31.3%
quoted this concept to support arguments in
favor of using RJ in China (see Table
26.6
).





The above results clearly suggest that most RJ
journal authors in the PRC do not link their argu-
ments to the most recent development of RJ prac-
tices around the world and that few are fully
aware of the evolution and current practices of RJ
in other PRC provinces and districts. The content
analysis revealed that only 37 journal papers
quoted scienti
ﬁ
c research
ﬁ
ndings as evidence in
support of their arguments (see Table
26.3
); only
18 journal papers cited real-world examples of
RJ in either the PRC or in other countries (see
Table

), and only 37 papers quoted 5 or more
international
references
(see

Moreover, the journals’ key themes focused on
how RJ can be integrated into the criminal justice
system and the relationships between RJ and
Chinese
philosophy
and
PRC
politics.
Interestingly, in introducing or discussing the
concepts of RJ and its current uses, most authors
seemed to rely on just a few Chinese sources (Di

2005
; Wang
2005
;
2006
; Wu
2002
)
. As most
papers were not based on original ideas, with
some just repeating the arguments of others with-
out conducting a thorough literature review or
scienti
ﬁ
c study, few papers reached an acceptable
international academic standard.

To be fair, though, most of the articles have
been valuable in raising the awareness of RJ
within the PRC’s academic, social work, and
legal
ﬁ
elds. Some of the articles were exception-
ally well written and included sophisticated

26 Evolution of Restorative Justice Practices for Juvenile Offenders in the People’s Republic of China
reviews of the PRC’s criminal justice practices
and discussions of the compatibility of RJ with
traditional Chinese philosophies, including
Confucianism. Some of the papers pointed out
the incompatibility of values between the exist-
ing punitive social control model and Western RJ
practices. Others pointed out the relationship
between the immaturity of the current legal sys-
tem and the integration of RJ into different levels
of the criminal justice process.

Some of the articles dealt effectively with the
relationship between RJ and juvenile justice as
well. These articles observed that the use of RJ to
treat juvenile offender cases is in line with the
PRC’s current use of the integrated management
approach to tackle juvenile delinquency: RJ
administers justice through the participation of
juvenile offenders, victims, and other concerned
stakeholders and emphasizes the repair of the
harm done to those affected by crimes and the
simultaneous restoration of social relationships
and social order. Thus, RJ seems to conform to
the national juvenile crime prevention principle
of “joint participation and integrated manage-
ment” and can also help reduce the cost of formal
justice programs.

Unfortunately, most of the articles are aca-
demically super
ﬁ
cial, as the authors fail to re
ﬂ
ect
in depth on the sociopolitical conditions behind
RJ’s success overseas. Many authors fail to
acknowledge that RJ’s overseas success has been
dependent on a fair, open, and democratic socio-
political system. They fail to point out that local
PRC police and committees are under the leader-
ship of the municipal government and that the
administrative staff may thus be politically
biased. The surveyed authors rarely criticize the
corrupt sociopolitical culture of the PRC.

Moreover, debates about how real justice
could be achieved in the PRC were seldom
encountered. China’s mediation processes are
particularly susceptible to the in
ﬂ
uence of per-
sonal power and persuasion. Outcomes thus often
favor those with close ties to the Communist
Party or who hold a powerful position in the
administration (Wong
2001
)
. However, some
proponents of RJ in the PRC think that RJ
ﬁ
ts
well into the con
ﬂ
ict-resolution system com-
monly adopted by local authorities. They assert
that RJ could help local authorities save money
and resources, since formal measures for resolv-
ing con
ﬂ
icts are rather expensive. Their argu-
ments miss the key fact that injustices may occur
if attention is not paid to power imbalances
among con
ﬂ
icting parties. As the PRC’s justice
system is not based on the presumption of inno-
cence, the police or procuracy may urge an
offender to confess in order to solve the case as
quickly as possible. Decisions may be in
ﬂ
uenced
by personal or political considerations rather than
the nature of the offence and the offender’s situa-
tion. It is a pity that so few RJ proponents in the
PRC understand that RJ is essentially about
empowerment, public participation, reintegra-
tion, and restoration.

26.5

Factors Conducive to the
Development of Restorative
Justice in the PRC

Most of the publications reviewed were in favor
of RJ. As Table
26.7 shows, 54.4% were strongly
in favor of the development of RJ in the PRC,
41.6% moderately in favor, and only 4% not in
favor. The papers did not just advocate the future
use of RJ but also documented current RJ prac-
tices in the PRC. Undeniably, RJ has
ﬂ
ourished
over the past 5 years in the PRC. Certain factors
may have been especially conducive to this rapid
development.

First, RJ shares the traditional Chinese aim of
being “against the crime” while wanting to “pro-
tect the person” and advocates lenient treatment
of juvenile offenders in order to maximize their
future potential. It encourages public participa-
tion, by which con
ﬂ
icts can be settled through
negotiation and communication between the
offender and the victim. Apology and
ﬁ
nancial
compensation are used to remedy the harm done
by the offender, and more constructive means
(such as community service) replace the tradi-
tional punishments that deprive offenders of their
freedom. Accordingly, RJ is in line with the guid-
ing principles of Chinese juvenile justice, which
focuses on “education, reform, and rescue,” the


402
D.S.W. Wong and L.W.Y. Mok
formula endorsed by the Communist Central
Party of China. Restorative practices are also in
line with the principle of “double protection,” in
which the protection of both community safety
and delinquents is respected (Qin and Huang

2010
; Shen and Zou
2010
)
.

Second, despite the recent shift in Chinese
juvenile justice from an informal “societal” to a
formal “juridical” approach (Wong
2001
)
, the
Chinese preference for mediation and interper-
sonal harmony seems to be deeply rooted in
Confucian philosophy, which sees social con
ﬂ
ict
as disruptive of the natural order. In parallel with
the recent development of RJ around the world,
the continued use of bangjiao programs, sus-
pended prosecution, and suspended sentences to
treat juvenile delinquents is de
ﬁ
nitely conducive
to the evolution of restorative practices. These
practices are rooted in both Confucian philoso-
phy and the indigenous Chinese justice practices
that emphasize the harmony among human rela-
tionships (Wong
2004
; Wong and Mok
2011
)
.

Third, the restorative model of delinquency
control is also compatible with the mass line ide-
ology, which welcomes the involvement of indig-
enous community leaders. The PRC’s ruling
Chinese Communist Party believes the mass line
ideology to be non-refutable, and it underlies all
kinds of social security practices (Zhong
2009
)
.
Criminal justice organizations such as the police,
courts, and procuracies, all following orthodox
Marxism, believe that social control is fruitless
without mass involvement. Therefore, substantial
emphasis is placed on mass grassroots participa-
tion. Crime, delinquency, and social con
ﬂ
icts are
matters to be tackled by government of
ﬁ
cials act-
ing together with indigenous community leaders
for the ultimate purpose of building a utopia.

Fourth, RJ focuses on the repair of harm done
to the victim and the community. It thus
ﬁ
ts in
well with the recent “building a harmonious

society” slogan pronounced by the President of
the PRC. To build this harmonious society,
Communist Party members, government of
ﬁ
cials,
scholars, and neighborhood committee members
have to work hand in hand to promote this con-
cept throughout the whole nation, including

ﬁ
nding ways to subsume administrative and
criminal justice practices under the slogan. The
restorative model of delinquency control there-
fore
ﬁ
ts perfectly into the mass line ideology,
showing support for both the president’s political
slogan and the goal of maintaining social
stability.

Restorative Justice: The Way
Ahead

The number of news items and journal articles
relating to PRC RJ found in the China Core
Newspapers Full-text Database and the China
Academic Journals Full-text Database increased
gradually from 122 pieces in 2006 to 204 pieces
in 2010. Obviously, an increasing number of
researchers, practitioners, and reporters have
recently been writing articles exploring and dis-
cussing RJ. These have facilitated the rapid evo-
lution and development of RJ in the PRC. The
ideas and practices of RJ are likely to continue to
develop in both the academic and professional
sectors. The conclusions listed below can be
drawn from recent RJ developments.

First, a national legal framework and standard-
ized set of regulations for the proper use of restor-
ative practices should be developed to foster the

wider application of RJ. According to the China
Yearbook Full-text Database, the term “restor-
ative justice” had never appeared in any of the
central government’s yearbooks but appeared 47
times in the yearbooks of regional governments.
For lack of a central legal framework, district
authorities employ their own models of restor-
ative practices while handling criminal cases,
with practices varying across cities and prov-
inces. Restorative practices are sometimes mis-
used in some areas. For example, we have seen
people treat RJ as a way to buy a shortened sen-
tence. If RJ is not
ﬁ
rmly linked to the current
criminal justice system, many potentially effec-
tive RJ practices might remain the objects of aca-
demic debate or experimentation, outside the
mainstream criminal justice system.

Second, in addition to a clear and legal restor-
ative practice foundation, local communities’
practical experience and wisdom concerning the
promotion of RJ are equally important. The active
involvement of all the stakeholders involved in
the con
ﬂ
icts or crimes at issue is a critical factor
in the success of RJ programs. Increasing num-
bers of regional and district PRC governments
have recently started to develop a variety of com-
munity correction programs in neighborhoods,
schools, universities, and companies. These pro-
grams aim to create a social support network for
rehabilitating and reintegrating juvenile offend-
ers into the community at the aftercare stage
(Sang
2010
; Zhao
2011
)
. An increasing number
of procuracies are becoming involved in develop-
ing RJ practices for juvenile offenders (Zhao and
Zhang
2012
)
. These procuracies are working
closely with local community leaders, who are
active in community supervision. With the
increasing number of successful community
supervision cases, the ideas of RJ will likely be
further promoted in different areas throughout
the PRC (Zhao
2010
)
.

26.7

Concluding Remarks

The above examination of the evolution of RJ
and its practices in the PRC provides readers with
precious insights into how RJ and related practices
are conceived and whether Western RJ models
should be incorporated into the current criminal
justice system without altering them.

This chapter has examined the current juve-
nile justice system, the emerging restorative prac-
tices, and related issues in the PRC. Obviously,
the PRC’s RJ movement is only at the initial
stage. RJ practices should be carefully developed
and implemented on a trial basis and then
reviewed as they evolve. Thus, while RJ has
developed rapidly over the past decades, scholars
and PRC policy makers must devote more energy
to formulating a just and fair mechanism that can
allow RJ to
ﬂ
ourish and be healthily integrated
into both the formal and informal social control
systems for the bene
ﬁ
t of juvenile offenders and
the broader community.

Victimology: China’s scholars de
ﬁ
ne Victimology
as a branch of science that studies the phenomena
of victimization, victims, the key factors of vic-
timization, the restitution of victimization, and the
prevention of victimization. Before the founda-
tion of the People’s Republic of China in 1949,
Yan Jingyao, a China’s well-known criminologi-
cal expert, had referred to the issue of victims in
his criminological research. China’s Victimology
has developed for more than 30 years. The devel-
opment of Victimology comes with the develop-
ment of Criminology and is in the process of
internationalization. Since 1979, when China
began the economic reform and opening up to the
outside world, in the course of pursuing fairness
and justice and strengthening the work in guaran-
teeing human rights, the Chinese society has paid
attention to a growing number of groups of peo-
ple, including such a special group of people as
the victims in crimes who are focused gradually.
The protection of victims’ rights and interests has
been put on the agenda by legislative and law
enforcement agencies and social organizations
successively. Relative laws, law enforcement, and
social activities bring about realistic demands for
the research on Victimology. Thus, many scholars
made
further
academic
explorations
in
Victimology
theories and its practical applications, and worked
up to subject construction. From this it is obvious
that the development of Victimology has its his-
torical inevitability in China. This paper briefs the
summary of the present situation of Victimology
that has developed in China for more than 30 years,
summing up the existing research and looking
forward to the direction of its development.

27.1

Brief History of the Origin
and Development
of Victimology in China

27.1.1
Origin of Victimology in China

Compared with the beginning of the studies of
Victimology around the world, which sprang up
in the middle of the twentieth century, it started
relatively late in China. China’s Victimology
began in the early 1980th and had a short history
of studying. In
ﬂ
uenced by the “cultural revolu-
tion” in the middle of 1960s, the crime rate in the
late 1970s reached its peak for the third time. The
study on crime problems only about offenders
and crime countermeasures lost its effectiveness
on controlling crimes, so scholars began to pay
attention to the numerous victims hidden behind
crimes. “Victims take a large portion of the total
population in all the countries. The accumulated
number of victims around the world in 10 years
may be close to the total population.” As the
world’s most populous nation that makes up one

ﬁ
fth of the global population, China has large
numbers of victims. Thus, the development of the

study of Victimology in China is promoted by
objective requirements including solving the
existing problems of victims, maintaining a good
social public order, and protecting the rights and
interests of victims.

27.1.2
Development Process
of Victimology in China

1.
Victimology in its early stage of development
Victimology (from the middle of the 1980s to
the late of the 1980s).

Before the middle of the 1980s, the study
on Victimology in China was a blank for a
long period. Although a few papers could be
seen in newspapers and magazines, they were
just the preliminary introduction of the results
of foreign research. Victimology with Chinese
characteristics was to be explored. During this
period the studies of victims are mainly trans-
lations and introductions about relative foreign
results of research. Some scholars concen-
trated their studies on the litigant positions and
the rights and interests of victims in criminal
suit. In this period the studies of criminal laws
and regulations were the key of Victimology
research. In the late of 1980s, basic theories of
victims were developed. Studies in this period
laid foundations for the research on following
problems: the phenomena of victimization, the
structure and tendencies of victimization, the
causes of victimization and the way some per-
son become victim, the victim–offender rela-
tionship, personal characteristics of victims
and their social environment, the classi
ﬁ
cation
of victims, the predication of victims, the pre-
vention of victimization, and the compensa-
tion legislation for victims.

As for the research projects about
Victimology, in the project “
The Research on
the Index and the Appraisal of the Public
Security Perception
,” scholars made active
efforts in surveying and studying the follow-
ing problems concerned with victims: the
comprehensive evaluation of the security of
society, the evaluation of the fairness of
law enforcement, the evaluation of the satis-
faction with the public security work, the
proportion of daring to be witnesses, and
the proportion of daring to walk at night.
Based on the surveys, scholars compiled
“
Do You Have A Feeling of Public Security?—
the Basic Theories and Survey Methods of
Public Security Perception
.” In addition, some
scholars also did special research on victims
and beginning research on victim issue and
Psychology in Chinese society cases.

In the aspect of education and train men for
profession, faculties of law of some colleges
and universities and some public security col-
leges offered special lectures and made active
efforts in exploring popular issues about
victims.

In relevant practice, as a series of laws and
regulations passed at the end of the 1970s set
the legal system construction in China on a
normal road, since beginning period of 1980s,
they has been developing and becoming more
perfecting in the law enforce
ﬁ
eld, people
began to pay attention to the issues concerned
with the rights and interests of victims and the
system construction.

In international communications, Chinese
People’s Public Security University invited
Hans Schneider, the top expert of the World
Society of Victimology to give a special lecture
of Victimology in 1987. The introduction of
relative
information
of
International
Symposium
of the World Society of Victimology and the
research courses about victims triggered
Chinese scholars’ great interests. Moreover,
many scholars of Criminology came to China
from England and America for academic
exchange, and they introduced knowledge of
Victimology in every aspects and their pioneer-
ing research to Chinese scholars.

During this period, although there were
more studies of the introduction of foreign
research material, but less pioneering research;
more decentralized research but less system-
atic research; more studies that combined in
relative subjects, but less self-contained stud-
ies; more personal research, but less collabor-
ative research, Chinese scholars began to pay
attention to the rights and interests of victims


409
27 The Retrospect and Prospect of China’s Victimology
and their special problems and accumulated
experience for the future studies.

2.
The
ﬁ
rst stage of the development of
Victimology (in the 1990s).

This period is the
ﬁ
rst stage of the develop-
ment of Victimology in China. In this period,
the works of Criminology and textbooks all
began to have special chapters discussing the
problems of victims. Although a fair propor-
tion of the academic papers during this period
focused on the litigant positions and the rights
and interests of victims in criminal suit, they
had began to emphasize studies of victims in
part of crimes. The studies included analysis
in victim Psychology, victims’ impact on
criminal behavior, and the important part that
victims played in preventing crimes.

In the study of basic theories, the range of
victims was speci
ﬁ
ed. Many research methods
and a scienti
ﬁ
c research system were also for-
mulated in this period. Chinese scholars also
began to try to make investigations of victim-
ization. In 1994, with the technological assis-
tance from a project launched by the United
Nations and Canada, Chinese Ministry of
Justice carried out the
ﬁ
rst criminal victim
survey (2,000 samples) in Beijing, China, lay-
ing foundations for the future criminal victim
survey.

On the research projects about Victimology,
in addition to the investigation project by the
United Nations mentioned above, the Socio-
logy of Chinese Academy of Social Sciences
directed a signi
ﬁ
cant project on Chinese
People’s social psychological research in the
period of China’s social transition. In this
project, some scholars conducted a special
investigation of public security perception in
different cities. In the meanwhile, the book
“
The Research on Crime Causes in China
”
(1998), as the result of the important fund
project of social science for Chinese crime
prevention directed by Wei Pingxiong and
Wang Shunan, had a chapter of “Factors of
victimization in crimes” wrote by Wang
Dawei. It gave a systematic and in-depth
elaboration on the basic concept, factors, and
situations of victimization.

In teaching and train men for profession,
many Colleges of Politics and Law set up
courses of criminal Victimology. For example,
China’s University of Political Science and
Law, Southwest University of Political Science
and Law, and Chinese People’s Public Security
University respectively set up relative courses
in both undergraduate and graduate courses.
Many monographs by scholars such as Guo
Jianan were also used in teaching. Special
chapters and sections about Victimology were
designed in relative Criminology textbooks.
Some postgraduates and doctoral candidates
also wrote master’s theses and doctoral disser-
tations concerning Victimology.

In relative practice, the research on the liti-
gant rights and interests of victims and their
positions found that the revised “
Code of
Criminal Procedure
” still had problems in the
perfection of victim protection. In criminal
legislation and law enforcement, people often
attached importance to cracking down on
crimes, but did not pay adequate attention to
the causes of crimes. The results which led to
measures on legislation and law enforcement
were con
ﬁ
ned to “valuing the
ﬁ
ght against
crimes but belittling the protection of vic-
tims.” In this period, law practice was greatly
improved. For instance, some of the rules
about the litigant rights and interests of vic-
tims were adopted in the revised “
Code of
Criminal Procedure
” in 1996. The promulga-
tion of “
The Law on the Protection of Minors
”
in 1991, “
Administrative Punishment Law
” in
1996, “
Elder Rights Protection Law
” in 1996
and other rules and regulations lay legal
grounds for the protections for different
victims.

In international communications, the inves-
tigation results about victims in Beijing were
issued in the “
Criminal Victimisation in the
Developing World
” published by United
Nations Interregional Crime and Justice
Research Institute. Wang Dawei gave a speech
about juvenile victims in China at the 8th
international Victimology conference con-
vened at Adelaide in Australia. Kang Shuhua
attended the 9th international Victimology


410
W. Dawei and T. Longfei
conference in 1997. In 1998, Wang Dawei
attended the 12th international Criminology
conference in Seoul, Korea and made a key-
note speech of “
Comparative Study of
Victimization between China and the Other
Eleven Developing Countries
.” Six scholars
from the Chinese Society of Criminology
attended
the
International
Society
of
Criminology and made academic connections
with foreign researchers and research insti-
tutes that study Victimology.

The developmental characteristics in this
period showed that the subject construction of
Victimology had made preliminary progress,
embodied in the construction of basic theories,
the research on the issues, and breakthroughs
in research methods, research contents and the
study of major projects. Relative laws were
also formulated. People not only began to pay
attention to victims who abuse of power, but
also made extensive explorations in relative
victims of other types appeared in social issues
in China. All these promote the development
of Victimology.

3.
The period of multidirectional development
in Victimology (since the twenty-
ﬁ
rst
century).

In this period, the study of Victimology
was further expanded and deepened in both
breadth and depth. Special academic study
societies were also established. At the Chinese
Society of Criminology Annual Conference
convened at Haikou, China, in 2011, Chinese
Victimology Association was established as a
branch of Chinese Society of Criminology.
The Association appointed Zhang Ling as
chairman, Zhao Guoling, Wang Dawei and
Liu Zhiyuan as deputy directors, Zhao Ke as
consultant. Praiseworthy progress made in
multidisciplinary explorations in Victimology
and trials of different levels in researching on
comparative study among different countries
brought new characteristics to the era of
Victimology research. In deepening explora-
tions, some scholars began to narrow down to
a certain type of the study of victims, such as
victims of sexual crimes, juvenile victims,
victims of family violence, victims of traf
ﬁ
c
accidents, victims of terrorism crimes, etc. At
the same time, scholars began to study the
interactions between victims and offenders.
Especially, the studies of the transformation of
victims into offenders and crimes resulted
from victims’ delinquency were increased
notably. The research on relief system for vic-
tims, problems of restorative justice, the pro-
tection for rights and interests of victims was
further developed. The studies are mainly
concerned with crime punishment and crime
prevention in recent years, emphasizing how
to deal with crime problems and crime phe-
nomena from victims’ angle. Scholars began
to put unprecedented emphasis on the meth-
ods of empirical study.

As for research subjects about Victimology,
there were the project “The Measurement and
Appraisal of the Social Composite Indicator
of Guangzhou City” launched by Wang Dawei,
the long-term research on the subject of vic-
tims by Guo Jianan, the pilot project of state
aid for criminal victims launched by the
Supreme Judicial Court, the topic about the
establishment of the relief system for victims
of criminal cases in Hainan Province. All these
were the active efforts made in the academic
studies on Victimology in China during this
period. New breakthroughs were also made in
the study of Victimology teaching, such as
Wang Dawei was awarded the national excel-
lent course in 2007 for his special chapters
expounding problems of Victimology in the
Criminology project and the construction of
relative Web site. To construct better relative
courses, Li Wei especially composed the text-
book “
Criminal Victimology
”. The book elab-
orately introduces the history of Victimology,
victims and victimization phenomena, the
relationship between victims and offenders,
victimization and victim prevention, theory of
Criminal Victimology, victims of criminal jus-
tice system, compensation for victims and vic-
tim restitution, victim assistance, etc., having
a positive signi
ﬁ
cance to the understanding of
the development of Victimology in recent
years.“Crime Victims: An Introduction to
Victimology” by Andrew Karmen was trans-


411
27 The Retrospect and Prospect of China’s Victimology
lated by China’s some scholars. In addition,
since the 1990s, the National Bureau of Census
and Statistics in China has gradually set up an
annual investigation system of security per-
ception of the Chinese people and an informa-
tion release system, providing data reference
for the study of Victimology by the annual
reports on the situation nationwide.

In teaching and train men for profession,
there was new development in the courses in
Victimology offered by some Chinese politics
and law colleges and universities and public
security colleges. The contents of victims
were often involved in t he explorations and
discussion about criminal problems. Since
2000, many young scholars have had interests
in researching on victim problems in their
undergraduate theses, Master’s theses and
doctoral dissertations, and complete their rela-
tive explorations by degree papers. Also some
students go abroad to continue their study of
Victimology after graduation, and they are the
future generation who will carry forward the
studies of Victimology.

In relative practice, the
Law of the People’s
Republic of China on the Protection of the
Rights and Interests of Women (
2005), the

Law of the People’s Republic of China on the
Protection of Minors (2006), the
Law of the
People’s Republic of China on State
Compensation (2010), and the
Criminal
Procedure Law of the People’s Republic of
China (2012) were revised in the aspect dur-
ing this period, and thus, the rights and the
interests of victims were further protected. To
attain international standards, efforts were
made in the legal construction of both legisla-
tive and law enforcement agenies. With respect
for international Conventions and Treaties,
they developed their legal systems in a
scienti
ﬁ
c and modern way. For example, the
spirit of “
The Declaration of the Basic
Principles of Justice for Victims of Crime and
Abuse of Power
” was manifested in the pro-
cess of legislation and law-enforcement.

In international communications, Chinese
scholars actively attended the International
Symposiums of Victimology and discussed
and explored relative topics. Chinese scholars
Zhao Ke and Wang Dawei respectively
attended the 11th and the 13th International
Symposiums of Victimology held in Canada
and Japan. In 2003, Wang Dawei presented
the paper of juvenile self-protection and social
protection, entitled by “
If
…,” at the 11th
International Symposiums of Victimology in
Montreal. In 2009, Wang Dawei made
speeches on both “
On the Comparative Study
of Victimization between China’s Guangzhou
and Other Developing Countries’ Cities
” and
“
On the Prevention Street Robbery through
Situational Mock Training ” at the 13th
International Symposium of Victimology in
Mito, and he was elected as the Co-opted
Member of Executive Committee of the World
Society of Victimology.

In this period, as China opened wider to the
outside world and expanded its foreign
exchanges, it organized academic activities
with both Japan and Korea, promoting the
international exchanges in Victimology and
the development of Victimology in China.
China held several Sino-Japanese seminars of
Criminology that involved corresponding
exploration of Victimology. The organization
of academic exchanges such as the Seminar of
the Protection for the Legitimate Rights and
Interests of Victims in the Criminal Procedure,
and the Sino-Korean Academic Exchanges of
Criminal Victims was also the important
development of the academic exchanges of
Victimology in China.

In this period, the development of
Victimology was embodied as followings: as a
branch of learning, it was further expanded
and deepened in both breadth and depth. It
was researched and explored not only from
Victimology itself, but also from the multidis-
ciplinary angle. Scholars began to pay atten-
tion to comparative research in different
countries. With its approach to the interna-
tional level, China will improve its relative
research contents in the future. Research sub-
jects had new breakthroughs. The subjects
began to have their own characteristics, and
began to seek way to an overall consideration


412
W. Dawei and T. Longfei
about the balance between victims and offend-
ers, between the rights and interests of victims
and other social groups, presenting the devel-
oping orientation of localization.

In view of the three developmental stages
of Victimology in China, the Victimology
experienced a process of developing from
scratch to, borrowing experience, exploring,
researching and innovating. It has begun to
show preliminary signs of becoming an inde-
pendent branch of learning. Relevant research
results include two great dictionaries:
Crimi-
nology, Prison Law, Criminology Dictionary
on Gansu Press
,
Law Encyclopedia on Beijing
University Press—Criminal Jurisprudence
,
and over ten special works that introduce
Victimology generally, near ten relative
works concerning victimology and law, and
over ten works concerning the detailed con-
tents of Victimology. Chinese scholars and
social workers have made remarkable contri-
butions for a good social atmosphere for the
further expansion and deepening of the
research on Victimology, so that people from
all social circles can listen to the voice of
Victimology in a better way in the future to
promote and improve Victimology.

27.2

Research Contents
of Victimology

In the explorations of the contents of Victimology,
according to what is generally regarded by both
Chinese scholars and scholars worldwide as the
problems of Victimology that should be dis-
cussed, the author of this paper includes ten rela-
tive items of contents to be discussed specially.

27.2.1
Victim

In the past three decades, monographs and
research papers in China have de
ﬁ
ned victims
from different angles. The names include criminal
victim, victim of crime, victim, and aggrieved
party. The de
ﬁ
nitions of the concept all share one
thing in common, that is, the body that offends
against the legitimate rights and interests of a
subject is the crime behavior. The victim of
crimes is de
ﬁ
ned as the natural person, the corpo-
ration, and the State
1
whose legitimate rights
and interests are offended. As for the de
ﬁ
nitions
of victims, different scholars have different
opinions in the range of victims. Tang Xiaotian
and Ren Keqin (
1989
)
, Dong Xin
(
1993
)
, Guo
Jian’an
(
1997

)
, Zhang Zhihui, and Li Wei
(

2010
)
all have de
ﬁ
ned the type of victims. In the
textbook “
Crimi
nology
”, co-compiled by Wang
Dawei,
ﬁ
ve basic requirements are put forward
as the constitution of a crime victim, and the
book expounds the related concept of victims.
In China’s Dictionary of Criminology, it narrowly
de
ﬁ
nes the victim of crime. Its de
ﬁ
nition is the
natural person, the corporation, and the State
whose legitimate rights and interests are directly
offended by other people’s crime behavior.
There is also another explanation: victims are
those who are directly offended by the crime
behavior of the in
ﬂ
ictive party.

In China, the scholars put more efforts on
criminal justice in the study of the cognition of
victims. Victims of disasters and other incidents
are studied and explored partly, but it is a pity that
the studies are not carried forward.

Main Contents of Victimology

Over the past 30 years of development,
Victimology has been de
ﬁ
ned by many scholars
at home, including Tang Xiaotian and Ren
Keqin (
1989
), Zhao Ke
(
1989
)
, Zhang Zhihu and
Xu Mingjuan (

, based on their relevant studies.
Today, the Chinese scholars generally agree
to incorporate the broad understanding of
Victimology and the previous narrow sense of
Victimology.

The scholars at home have yet to form a

complete theoretical structure of their own.


413
27 The Retrospect and Prospect of China’s Victimology
Their study thereof mostly borrows the relevant
fundamental theories prevalent in the US and
Japan, which mainly include.

27.2.2.1
Theory of Victimization

These theories cover such areas as personal fac-
tors of victimization, exposure of lifestyle, daily
activities, homogeneous groups, and victimiza-
tion. The above theories are mostly considered as
provocative factors of offensive acts by relevant
scholars. All these theories have not formed an
independent and complete system of study, but
can only act as factors of analytics for particular
topics of research. Nonetheless, these theories
are signi
ﬁ
cant for the study of the criminal acts.
The on-going study at home is limited to the
understanding of speci
ﬁ
c acts of victimization
and the rights of victims. It is evident that such
study has downplayed the value of theoretical
studies.

27.2.2.2
Theories of Victimization
Prevention

Scholars at home have carried out studies and
concluded with relevant results in a number of
prevention theories, such as CPTED and defen-
sive space theory, both based on environmental
designs, and others including strategies on risk
evasion and control (Fig.
27.1
)
.

27.2.2.3
Theories of Victimization

These extend from the
ﬁ
rst time to the second
and third times of victimization, thus encompass-
ing all the processes of victimization, litigation,
and possible transition from victims to criminals.
Many of such studies at home actually dive deep
into one of the above processes, such as the liti-
gation status and rights of the large number of
victims, or the transition from victims to crimi-
nals, or a myriad of victimized behaviors.
The Victimology studies have made great head-
way in China.

27.2.2.4
Theories of Repeat Victim

The current debate on victimization is an
important measure to mobilize the social forces
for the prevention and control of criminal acts
and the protection of victims’ rights. The issue
of victimization involves many aspects of con-
trol, such as that over contextual and social
factors and the psychological and physical
state of victims. The governmental act is all
the more important as it becomes increasingly
urgent for the government to effectively assume
the basic responsibility for prevention and
control, reform the judicial system, and put
into place the relevant relief mechanisms. It is
also necessary for the government to advocate
and orient the societal approach to social

values. The study on repeat victimization is of
particular importance for the protection of
rights and interests of victims and prevention
of victimization. There are the theories, which
have been studying by China’s scholars, of
repeat victim.


27.2.2.5
Theories of Victim Support

These theories can help check the tendency
of punishment-based social control, and redirect
the social policies toward preventive measures.
Nonetheless, their core concept of social support
still lacks a common index of measure. The
Social Development theory by contrast is a
macro-approach to the correlation and common-
alities between the social context and the type,
rate and geographical distri
bution of crimes in
developing countries, thus has offered theoretical
guidance in this regard.

China still lags behind in terms of the size of
Victimology researchers, the width and depth of
the relevant study, and the transition from the
research results to the real-world applications. It
seems that we have deviated from the interna-
tional trend given the inertia of both Criminal
Victimology study at home and the application of
the study results to actual practice. The relevant
results were given less credit than they deserve,
and fail to effectively orient the practice, particu-
larly on issues of how to promote more emphasis
on self-defense, -disclosure, and -resistance of
offense in addition to attention to crackdown of
crimes, how to assist the law enforcement institu-
tions to reverse the tide of crimes, how to gain
more protection, and achieve better chances of
recovery from the past physical and psychologi-
cal traumas. All these require scholars at home to


414
W. Dawei and T. Longfei
further the theoretical study by focusing more on
the real conditions in China, and to verify the
extent of uncertainty and the practical value of
relevant theories in the real-world practice, so as
to better serve the end of cracking down on crimes
and protecting the rights of victims.

27.2.3
Methodology of Victimology

As for the study of Victimological methodolo-
gies, relevant literature have been available in
China, summarizing the results of explorative
study by scholars like Zhang Zhihui and Xu
Mingjuan (
1989
), Guo Jian’an, Wang Dawei

(
2003a,
b
)
, Zhang Hongwei
(
2007a,
b,
c
)
, Lu
Jianping, and Li Wei
(
2010
)
. The current method-
ologies go beyond qualitative and quantitative
studies, and extend to the methods of statistical
study, survey of the victim and offender, and
sampling-based victimization study. The qualita-
tive methods include case study, study of sum-
marizing literature, and direct observation. The
quantitative methodologies of Victimology are
also divided into methods of investigation, inter-
view and content analysis. The criminal victim
survey in 1994 plays a signi
ﬁ
cant role of learning
from the methods of international scholars, thus
promoting the development of quantitative
Victimology study in China. Unfortunately, so
far there have been no nationwide victim surveys
in the annual report launched on victims of
crimes, and no institutions have been set up to
support victim surveys in China.
2 Despite Zhang
Hongwei’s progress in this arena, the understand-
ing of the relevant methodologies is mostly a
narrow-down approach. The methodologies at
home mostly borrow from the study results of
foreign scholars, and have yet to develop their
own features. The state of methodological study
remains backward, leaving much room for fur-
ther progress.

Generally, the Victimological methodologies
at home stem from the foreign investigative
methods, and have not been adapted to the real
conditions in China. As a result, they have not
given full play to the role of investigative research
in the Victimology study. Given that China lacks
annual statistical surveys on Chinese scholars
still lag behind, and need to do more practice and
exploration of empirical study and quantitative
survey in the future.

27.2.4
Type of Victim

The victim categorization in China is different
from that in the western study in light of its dis-
tinct history and social practice. Special argu-
ments have been devoted to this topic by Tang
Xiaotian and Ren Keqin (
1989
), Xu Zhangrun,
Zhang Jianrong
(
1997
)
, Wang Dawei
(
2003a,
b
)
,
Kang Shuhua, etc. The typology of victim origi-
nates from the in-depth understanding of the
prevalent victims, and insight of the common and
distinct features of victims, as a result of both
correlative and drill-down research. The types
are concluded from systematic categorization on
the basis of logical methods tailored to special
purposes and norms. The scholars at home gener-
ally agree with the internationally recognized
scholars on victim division. In the present prac-
tice, the victims are often divided into the follow-
ing types: Actual or potential victims by actual
occurrence of victimization or not; common or
special victims by constraints of victims them-
selves; victims of violence, white-collar crimes,
property crimes, etc. in accordance with crimino-
logical theories; victims of homicide, theft, rape,

traf
ﬁ
c accidents, etc. in line with the de
ﬁ
nition of
crimes by the criminal law.

The scholars consider the western standards of
victim division as somewhat valuable to them. They
have also developed other insights in this regard,
which will not be detailed here. In the context of the
actual conditions in China, the study on victim
types should research more on victims of white-
collar crimes, victims of abuse of power, political
victims, occupational-hazard victims, victims of
mental diseases, victims of depression, victims of
terrorist attacks, victims of telecom fraud, victims
of disasters, victims of public order events, etc.


27.2.5
Phenomena of Victimization

Relevant research has been underway from aspects
of the concept and forms of victimological phe-
nomena by scholars like Zhang Zhihui and Xu
Mingjuan (
1989
), Zhao Ke
(
1989
)
, Guo Jian’an

(
1997
)
, Wang Dawei
(
1997a,
b
)
, Xu Zhangrun
(2004), Zhao Guoling (
2009
), and Li Wei
(
2010
)
.

Over the past few decades, the phenomena of
victimization have taken the form of victim types.
The views on these phenomena differ. One
regards these phenomena as of social nature, or
social phenomena composed of different facts
under speci
ﬁ
c temporal and spatial conditions.
Another view considers these phenomena as the
external form of the victim and victimization
event, and their relation to the related crime under
speci
ﬁ
c temporal and spatial conditions. The
above process of the present focus of China’s
scholars include the statistical understanding of
victims and offensive acts, and the real experi-
ence of the victimized that may re
ﬂ
ect the true
nature of victimization. Furthermore, other schol-
ars have expressed different views on all of phe-
nomena of victimization. Therefore, deeper study
is needed on the interactive process and correla-
tions under certain temporal and spatial condi-
tions of the victimization.

In light of the distinct social reality and the
criminal judicial system, as well as other actual
conditions of China, the study on victimization’s
phenomena should be placed in the context of
social transition.

27.2.6
Factor of Victimization

Some
China’s
scholars
have
propounded
de
ﬁ
nition of victimization and differentiated vic-
timization contents in the course of relevant
research. These scholars include Zhang Zhihui
and Xu Mingjuan (
1989
), Zhao Ke
(
1989
)
, Guo
Jian’an
(
1997
)
, Wu Zongxian, Wang Dawei

(
1997a,
b
)
, Li Wei
(
2010
)
, etc.

The prevalent study in China focuses on the
factor of the propensity of the targeting of the vic-
tim by the offender, the factor inducing the
offense, and the conditions and other relevant fac-
tors of victimization. The victimization factors
are approached from three levels of pre-, during-,
and post-victimization, with the emphasis placed
on the relationship between victimization and the
causal system of crimes. The victimization study
has had profound impact on the actual social con-
ditions of the country, helping all kinds of parties
concerned gain better understanding of criminal
factors, detect and handle criminal cases, and pre-
vent crimes and victimization in the right manner.
Other scholars of the country have also probed
into the victimization (factors) study from aspects
of nature of key-factor of victimization, factors of
victimization, conditions of victimization, envi-
ronment of victimization, inducement of victim-
ization, experience of victim, goods of victim,
potential victimization, compliance with victim-
ization, and degrees of victim–offender relation-
ship. There is still much room for further study on
issues of victimization and other factors.

Given the impact of “9–11” Event and other
incidents posing serious threats to the public order,
and the progress in risk control and other relevant

ﬁ
elds, the victimization study has gradually
shifted the focus to risk management, thus result-
ing in a new approach to victimization factors
from aspects of victimization risk perspective.


27.2.7
Relationship Between Victim
and Offender

China’s Scholars, such as, Zhang Zhihui and
Xu Zhangrun (
1989
), Wang Dawei
(
1996
)
,
Wu Zongxian, Zhang Jianrong
(
1997
)
, etc. have


416
W. Dawei and T. Longfei
conducted relevant research about situation of
victimization in the early researches.

In the paper of Research about Victims in
Financial Fraud, written by Wang Dawei, he dis-
cussed four interaction processes between perpe-
trators and victims, which are utilization-available
patterns of fraud formed between fraud offenders
and victims not involved, pushing patterns of
fraud formed between fraud offenders and vic-
tims involved, model of victim translocation, and
Stockholm model. Regarding the study of envi-
ronment of victimization from Chinese scholars,
crime and victimization situations can be
classi
ﬁ
ed as crime and pre-victim situation, crime
and during-victim situation, and the post-victim
situation from the perspective of time evolution.
If in chronological sequence, which can be
divided into the implied situation of during-crime
and victimization, the imaginative situation of
during-crime and victimization, and the fact situ-
ation of during-crime and victimization; Chinese
scholars have implemented relevant research and
exploration to the crime opportunities and victim
interactions in the pre-context implied, medium-
term imaginary as well as the lately real situa-
tions. There are various complex forms in the
way of combinations after the victim situations
are connected with their speci
ﬁ
c criminal forms
(Fig.
27.2
).

27.2.8
Victimization Prevention

Some China’s Scholars, Shi Huanzhang, Zhang
Jianrong (
1997
), Tang Xiaotian, Wang Dawei

(
1997a,
b

)
, Zhang Zisheng, Shi Guoping, Wang
Jianmin, Song Haobo
(
2004a,
b
)
, Liwei, etc. all
proposed the concept of “victimization preven-
tion” and carried out the relevant researches. In
Criminology
,
Wang Dawei, who participated in
the redacting of this book in 1999, has made the
relevant researches on the relations between pre-
vention of victimization and crime from three
aspects, namely, the interrelation, differences,
and interaction between victimization prevention
and crime prevention.

Chinese scholars believe that the overall
objectives and the fundamental purposes of the
victimization prevention are similar to the crime
prevention. Whether victimization prevention or
crime prevention, the overall objectives and the
fundamental purposes are to effectively prevent
and reduce the incidence of crime and victim, to
maintain social public order and protect public
order. Before broad crime prevention includes
the victimization prevention; crime prevention
and victimization prevention are different in pre-
vention object, direct purpose, measures, meth-
ods, and means; but victimization prevention and
crime prevention can be mutually affected and

27 The Retrospect and Prospect of China’s Victimology
transformed. Based on binary crime prevention
theory, the study for the victimization prevention
by Chinese scholars also includes three levels of
social prevention, group prevention, individual
prevention, three stages of before-victim, during-
victim, and after-victim, the relations between
victimization prevention and crime prevention,
and other contents. The research also divides the
victimization prevention types to explore in three
different states of potential state, present state,
and post-victim state. The related researches on
victimization prevention in China undoubtedly
contribute to the constitution of multifaceted,
multilevel, different staged, and comprehensive
measures with social public order comprehensive
governance system (Fig.
27.3
).

In the aspects of “victimization prevention,”
some scholars have formed their own views and
opinions through being combined with the

contents of China’s public order comprehensive
management and binary crime prevention theory.

27.2.9
International Comparison
of Victimization

Affected by the international related study of
Victimology, Chinese scholars have carried out
research about victim’s issues both locally and
abroad. In addition to the related translations, the
scholars of Zhang Zhihui and Xu Mingjuan (
1989
),
Zhao Ke
(
1989
)
, Xu Zhangrun, Wu Zongxian, Guo
Jianan (
1997
), Wang Dawei, Li Wei
(
2010
) among
others have also begun to view said issues from the
international perspective.

We can divide this into three main areas:
research of Victimology, right of victim, law

system of victim from different countries and
areas, victim statistical systems and survey sys-
tems, theoretical study and comparative study on
phenomena of victimization. Chen Jianjun pub-
lished a thesis on the

In Wang Dawei’s papers,
The Comparative

the Other Eleven Developing Countries and

A Comparative Study of Victimization between
China’s Guangzhou and Other Developing
Countries’ Cities, the author described and
explained the number of victimization, the vic-
timization rates, the reporting rate, reasons for
not reporting crime, the degree of satisfaction
with police, criminal, family security preventive
measures, the views on different typical penal-
ties of comparison between China and other
developing countries, common and special prob-
lems, especially the point of view that the vic-
tims in China will gradually developing situation
with the more international characteristics.

In related comparative study, the research of
Chinese scholars has developed from a general
view into deeper analysis and comparative
study—in the period of imitation selectively.

27.2.10
Victim Evaluation

As to the Victim Evaluation, Zhang Honge, Wang
Dawei
(
2009a,
b,
c
)
, Li Wei
(
2010
)
, etc. have all
carried out the relevant researches. Wang Dawei
has made the systematic introduction from the
theory to the concrete evaluation systems, and
has given a special lecture of victim evaluation in
the undergraduate course of
Introductory Theory
of Crime Evaluation
.

Chinese scholars believe that the evaluation of
crime victim can be divided into four parts:
demographic factors, pre-victimization factors,
during-victimization factors, and post-victimiza-
tion factors; this is the basic framework and sys-
tem of victim evaluation. In particular the
evaluation of juvenile crime and victimization
from a risk perspective, starting from the risks
associated with theory of perception of the mur-
der and factors of victimization in the induction
and mutual in
ﬂ
uence of factors of victimization,
the phenomenon of the murder, the evaluation of
the potential victim protection measures. Beyond
that, it also relates to the victim evaluation of the
victim of violence, victim of suicide [how does
one asses a person who has committed suicide?],
victim of network crime, and victim of property
crime and so on (Fig.
27.4
).

In the practice of crime and victim evaluating
operation, the emphasis is from the choice of index
to the foundation statistic analysis, and thus the
complete crime and victim index system is con-
structed. In the research of Guangzhou public order
indexes evaluating system, Wang Dawei made a
systematic design of the victim index in accor-
dance with the experience of international victim
survey, which was a good attempt of overall victim
evaluation. Victim evaluation has become an
important area associated with other disciplines; it
needs the deeper exploration by Chinese scholars.

27 The Retrospect and Prospect of China’s Victimology

Chinese scholars’ exploration of Victimology
contents is not only from the related realistic
issues of victim, but also from the sublimation of
international Victimology development situa-
tions, their own exploration and research. These
researches and explorations are the foundation
and core contents of Chinese Victimology devel-
opment, which is worth further exploration in
order to improve Chinese scienti
ﬁ
c understand-
ing of Victimology by Chinese scholars.

27.3

Other Subjects Exploration in
the Victimological Localization

The study to Victimology is not limited to the
exploration of Victimology alone, but Chinese
scholars also make a positive exploration of
Victimology as it pertains to the study of law,
Sociology, Psychology, science of public admin-
istration, etc. These explorations remain to be
integrated into the research on Victimology so as
to make the study for victimization issues in
China a more comprehensive one integrating
more aspects and present the tendency of
localization.

27.3.1
Victimological Issues from
the Law Perspective

As many of the scholars who carried out the early
exploration of Victimology in China had their
academic background in Law, such as Tang
Xiaotian, Xu Zhangrun, Zhang Zhihui, Zhang
Weiguo, etc. these studies are mostly from the
perspective of Law including the roles
, rights,
victim–offender mediation, support systems, sys-
tem of national compensation as well as restitu-
tion, etc. The Criminal Procedure Protection of
Victims written by Fang Baoguo addressed the
discussion in distinct chapters to the theoretical
basis of victim proceeding with criminal actions,
from “Three Parties structure” to “Four Parties
structure”—reform of victim and criminal proce-
dure model, criminal procedure law relation
under the “Four Parties structure,” victim rights
protection in the case of public prosecution,

private prosecution programmed protection of
victim, the self-examination in victim criminal
damages compensation system, national com-
pensation and relief to victim and restitution and
victim protection; basically covers various
aspects on victim and criminal procedure with a
certain characteristics. The following is just an
introduction in the aspects of victim rights, sta-
tus, legal aid, compensation system, and restitu-
tion system contained in relevant research.

27.3.1.1
Victim Rights

On the basis of fully respecting the victim’s
rights regarding personal rights, right of access
to impartial judgment, freedom of religious
belief, right to know, participation rights, right to
expression, right of supervision, etc. Wang
Jianmin, Liu Genju, Yang Zhengwan
(
2002
)
,
Fang Baoguo (
2007
),  Dong Shitan (
2006
), and
other scholars made an in-depth research on the
rights of victims. They carried out a discussion
on Criminal Procedure Law in 1996 which gives
victims the position of litigants. Some scholars
highly praise it, some criticize it, and some sug-
gest improving the related regulations of the law
on the basis of af
ﬁ
rmation. Some scholars criti-
cize that the law gives the victims the position of
litigants mainly because victims have some
important rights including the right to apply for
withdrawal, right of entrusting the agent, direct
right to institute a criminal litigation, right to
request a protest, right to apply for supplemen-
tary veri
ﬁ
cation or another veri
ﬁ
cation for expert
conclusion. The litigant position of the victim
still has a some limits; victim cannot enjoy com-
pletely equal rights as with the defendant.
Furthermore, in order to protect the victim rights
in the Criminal Justice System of China, many
scholars raise suggest some modi
ﬁ
cations and
improvements, such as improving the victim
right to investigation and discovery, victim’s
right to know; enhancing the system of victim
entrusting agents; perfecting the statement right
of victims in the stage of review and prosecution;
giving the victims the right to institute an inci-
dental civil action independently, the right to an
independent appeal and
ﬁ
nal declaring; building
the right to claim compensation for emotional


420
W. Dawei and T. Longfei
damages and the right to legal aid; setting up
some systems of national compensation and res-
titution for victims as well as establishing the
social public order system for the protection of
victim rights.


27.3.1.2
Role of Victim

Some Chinese scholars, Pei Cangling, Wei
Tong, Xu Yongqiang
(
2003
)
, Lei Tang, Liu
Donggen, and other scholars, have conducted
research on the issues of the role of victim.
Since China enacted the
ﬁ
rst Criminal Procedure
Law in 1979, the academic circles have different
views on the criminal proceeding in relation to
victims. Embodied in this law are four main
proposals:
ﬁ
rst, propose for the victim the same
role as witness. Second, that the role of victim
be a contesting party standing beside the public
prosecutor. Third, that victim in the inde
ﬁ
nite
position is similar to but different from the wit-
ness. Fourth, that victim will be an independent
litigator with independent role. In 1996, China
made a modi
ﬁ
cation to “
Criminal Procedure
Law
,” giving the victim the role of litigant in
the law, and giving the victim some of the same
rights as litigants. These rights are of vital
signi
ﬁ
cance and highlight the litigant role of
the victim. This modi
ﬁ
cation to the law causes
much discussion in the academic circles, where
scholars offer some modi
ﬁ
cations and propose
improvements. It is expected that the role of
criminal victim in China will be furthered in the
future.


27.3.1.3
Assistance and Restitution
for Victims

In China, Guo Jian’an
(
1997
)
, Luo Dahua (
1983
),
Ma Guo’an
(
2002
)
, Mo Hongxian (
2007
), and
Zhang Hongwei
(
2007a,
b,
c
) have studied victim
assistance and restitution, and consider that
China’s assistance to victims mainly concentrates
in two aspects:
ﬁ
rst, victim assistance provided by
trade unions, women’s federations, Communist
Youth League, civil affairs department and other
social organizations; second, legal assistance for
victims as per the speci
ﬁ
cations of “
Regulations
on Legal Aid
” (enacted in 2003). Victim assistance
mainly includes intervention assistance, litigation
assistance,
ﬁ
nancial assistance, medical assis-
tance, psychological assistance, public education,
etc. Victim compensation is given by the govern-
ment to the victims. It is applicable when the crim-
inal is punished and cannot restitute the victim’s
damage. Although there are some countermea-
sures of restitution, China has not yet established a
victim restitution system by now, which is, to a
certain extent, detrimental to the protection of the
rights of victims. In the future, China should
increase legislative support for victim assistance
and restitution, and set up the relevant law system
of providing victim assistance and restitution.

Chinese scholars have conducted in-depth
studies on criminal reconciliation, restitution,
victim fault, and judicial rights protection of vari-
ous types of victims, which has accelerated
amendments to “
Criminal Law of the People’s
Republic of China
,” “
Law of the People’s Republic
of China on State Restitution
” and other laws,
and highlighted the protection of relevant rights
of citizens. The practice of some new judicial
reforms in China will help scholars acquire some
experience. Other relevant systems will be fur-
ther developed and improved with the reform of

27.3.2
Victimological Issues from
the Sociological Perspective

The development of Victimology is inseparable
from social development and relevant hot social
issues. Using the experience derived from
Sociology, and applying the sociological research
perspective will broaden the research area of
Victimology, and promote its development.
Some China’s scholars have conducted research
on Victimology in terms of vulnerable groups,
network society, urbanization, and other social
issues.

27.3.2.1
Relevant Vulnerable Groups

Kang Shuhua, Wang Dawei
(

)
, Xiao
Jianguo and Yao Jianlong (
2002
), Ji Hongguang

(
2004

, Lu Shizhen, Ma Guo’an
(
2005
)
, Qi
Yanping, Lu Deping, and Lu Yulin have studied
vulnerable victims groups, and put forward their


421
27 The Retrospect and Prospect of China’s Victimology
views on victim prevention. Issues of vulnerable
groups are usually caused by social transforma-
tion. With imbalanced social structures, China is
still a developing country and there are vulnera-
ble groups different from those in other countries.
In the study of vulnerable groups, social support,
social security, and social control mode are
closely related to the study of Victimology.

China is currently experiencing fundamen-
tal changes of economic construction, realloca-
tion of social resources, and historic innovation
of social control modes. Multidimensional
social hierarchy is bound to widen the social
gap between the rich and the poor. Although
social public order legislation has achieved
signi
ﬁ
cant progress in the protection of the
rights of female victims, juvenile victims, the
elderly victims, victims with disabilities, and
migrant worker victims, there is still a lack of a
solid theoretical system and institutional frame-
work to protect the rights of vulnerable group
victims. In the Seminar on “Protection of the
Rights of Social Vulnerable Groups” in 2005,
participants discussed “
Harmonious Society
and Constitutional Protection for Vulnerable
Groups in Society
” and “
Legal Basis for the
Protection of the Rights of Vulnerable Groups
in Society
,” which is undoubtedly playing a
positive role in promoting the research on vulner-
able group victims.

The number of vulnerable groups in China is
huge. In the whole process, Sociology will better
protect vulnerable groups, safeguard their legiti-
mate rights and interests, and have a positive
in
ﬂ
uence in the development of Victimology.

27.3.2.2
Victims of the Network Society

Jin Wulun, Qi Gong, Deng Xinmin, Xie Zemin,
Zhao Shuizhong, Lu Hanlong, and Wang Ding

(
2010
) have conducted researches on the network
society and related victims.

The number of Chinese Internet users ranks

ﬁ
rst position in the world. Chinese scholars
have studied various
ﬁ
elds and industries in the
network society, analyzed characteristics of net-
works, as a tool for social control, and summed
up the four characteristics of network society
making it different from social reality: network
society is featured by its unique structure and
self-administration, high degree of openness
and interactivity, space virtuality and crossing
national boundaries, and quick information trans-
fer. The development of the network society has
brought about various problems, such as moral
con
ﬂ
ict, information pollution, and intellectual
property issues of network information, and
brought new challenges to the study of victims,
but also provided new ideas and new directions
for the research of Victimology. The hot spots of
problems about the network society: network
interpersonal dependency, privacy protection,
and adverse incitement will expand the area of
Victimology research. The study of victims in
network group events in the network society,
network fraud, network organized crime, and
crime caused by network interpersonal depen-
dency are the focus of many scholars.

There have been studies and explorations on
victims of the network society, but further expan-
sion and research is still needed.

27.3.2.3
Relevant Victimization
in Urbanization

In China, Wang Fazeng, Chen Fengyun, Wang
Dawei
(
2004
)
, Zheng Yefu, and Xia Jianzhong
have carried out various researches related to
urban Sociology.

After its founding in 1949, China has wit-
nessed a rapid development of urbanization.
Victimization and distribution in urban environ-
ments have their own characteristics. Referring to
the existing studies of the Chicago School in the
United States and other scholars, Chinese schol-
ars began to focus on the relationship between
crime and space environment in urban areas
based on the characteristics of China’s urbaniza-
tion development. Wang Fazeng introduced the
geographical study of crime and victimization in
foreign cities as early as 1988, and then succes-
sively studied the impact of urban space environ-
ment on urban crime and victimization, the
integrated view on reasons for urban crime and
victimization, the blind spots of nonpublic space,
public space, and marginal space in urban crime
and victimization, and comprehensive treatment,
and the relationship between urban development
and urban crime, and in 2003 published the book
titled “
Urban Crime Analysis and Spatial


422
W. Dawei and T. Longfei
Prevention and Control
.” Chen Fengyun et al.
studied the environmental impact of crime and
victimization in urban fringe areas from the point
of view of environmental behavior studies. Du
Debin et al. studied the location choice via the
mathematical simulation of urban crime and for-
eign urban crime prevention and prevention of
victimization. Weng Li et al. preliminarily dis-
cussed the theory of crime prevention and control
in urban planning. Xu Leiqing reviewed the study
and practice of “
Crime Prevention through
Environmental Design
” over the past 30 years.

It should be noted that China is currently
experiencing a social transition period. The speed
of urbanization is accelerating with the associ-
ated risks changing accordingly. The strength-
ening of urban social public order should be
closely connected with relevant studies on urban
Sociology.



27.3.3
Victimological Issues from the
Perspective of Study Public
Administration

Since social transformation started in China,
much importance has been attached to Public
Administration, and relevant research has focused
on the management of governmental organiza-
tions. It has also covered the management of
general social public organizations, public

welfare organizations, nongovernment organiza-
tions (NGO), and nonpro
ﬁ
t organizations (NPO).
The research also focused on many constructions
bene
ﬁ
cial to victims. Public management service
concerning victims has also changed. Chinese
scholars have conducted research projects in
terms of social development strategies, social
emergency mechanisms and social evaluation.
These
are
important
issues
of
Public
Administration and promote the development of
Victimology in China.

27.3.3.1
Development Strategies
of Social Management

Dai Junliang, Hou Yan, Ding Yuanzhu, Cao
Jianguang, He Zengke, and Li Wei (
2010
) have
conducted research related to Victimology from
the perspective of social management develop-
ment strategies.

Chinese scholars have studied the following
eight aspects: the reform of social management
system, reform of social public order manage-
ment system, reform of social service system,
reform of social work system, reform of social
security system, reform of social emergency sys-
tem, reform of community management system,
and the reform of social management leadership
system and working mechanism. In relation to
emergency mechanism reform, adopt uniform
dispatching and provide services for victims from
the aspects of social early warning and social
mobilization, etc. For community system reform,
encourage victims to take an active part in com-
munity management, so as to enhance their com-
munity participation; the reform of leadership
system and working mechanism to guarantee the
implementation of protecting victims’ rights in
terms
of
relevant
system
reformation.
Accordingly,
the reform of social management system realizes
the transformation from the management of the
only subject—the Country into the management
of multiple subjects—the government, social
organizations, community organizations and the
public. Scholars will conduct more in-depth
exploration on how to better protect victims’
rights and interests in terms of social manage-
ment systems.

All the scholars’ discussions will greatly pro-
mote the role of victim protection and assistance
system in China’s social construction and facili-
tate the development of Victimology.

27.3.3.2
Emergency System of Social
Management

Zhang Chengfu, Dong Keyong, Xue Yuan, Hong
Dayong, and Guo Taisheng
(
2006
) have studied
the emergency system of China’s social manage-
ment and achieved certain results.

In the early twenty-
ﬁ
rst century, China has
experienced various major social events, such as
Beijing Olympics, Shanghai World Expo,
Guangzhou Asian Games, etc. China’s crisis
management and emergency response mechanism
have been constantly improved. Promoted by
many scholars’ academic research, the Chinese


423
27 The Retrospect and Prospect of China’s Victimology
government has formulated a series of laws and
emergency plans involving major critical areas,
and put forward special emergency plans for pub-
lic events, which play a signi
ﬁ
cant role in stan-
dardizing emergency response, protecting victims’
life and property, and safeguarding national secu-
rity, public safety, environmental safety, social
public order, etc., while protecting the rights and
interests of victims of terrorism, and victims of
major riots and other social events.

In China, although the construction of emer-
gency response system and mechanism has made
great progress, the country is still facing a grim
situation in the area of social emergency response
resulting in some emergency problems not being
adequately solved. Hence, scholars of public
management and other disciplines (including
Victimology) should carry out more collabora-
tive research on the protection of victims’ rights
and social stability, promoting the study of
Victimology.

27.3.3.3
Social Evaluation

Yan Yaojun, Wang Dawei
(
2004
)
, Qin Liqiang,
Wang Guang, and Wang Ding
(
2010
) have car-
ried out researches on social evaluation.

Over the past 100 years, various agencies and
academic organizations have explored the evalu-
ation of social and public management and the
continuous improvement of social public order
management evaluation system. Chinese scholars
believe that the development of public order man-
agement evaluation can be broadly divided into

ﬁ
ve stages: the stage of adopting relevant statis-
tics for evaluation (1829-the beginning of the
twentieth century), the stage of evaluation based
on crime types (the early twentieth century—
1930s), the stage of evaluation based on multiple
objective indicators (1930–1970s), the stage of
separate evaluation of subjective and objective
indicators (1970s, 1990s), and the stage of com-
prehensive evaluation of subjective and objective
indicators (1990s to present).

Since the early 1990s, China started to empha-
size the study and implementation of public order
management evaluation by relevant Chinese
departments, and special groups have been estab-
lished by the central and local governments for
relevant research. For example, in March 1994,
experts
from
China’s
National
Planning
Commission (current National Development and
Reform Commission), China’s National Bureau
of Statistics, China’s Renmin University, and
Chinese People’s Public Security University
formed the research group for social public order
evaluation; the Department of Sociology of
Tsinghua University organized the “Social Public
order” Research Group to speci
ﬁ
cally study the
social public order and social situation in Beijing;
the Shanghai Municipal Government constructed
a basic data platform for social public order man-
agement in 2007, to analyze the social public
order situation through 52 quantitative indicators.
Scienti
ﬁ
c
and
standardized
public
order

management evaluation has a key role in improv-
ing the overall image of the region, evaluating
social public order decision-making, and evaluat-
ing social public order performance. Currently,
the annual public security feelings report is avail-
able for reference. As per domestic and foreign
literature, although there are still many inadequa-
cies, the development of public order manage-
ment evaluation has shown the following four
trends: the combination of of
ﬁ
cial evaluation and
social evaluation, the combination of subjective
indicators and objective indicators, the combina-
tion of process and result, and the combination of
collaboration and technology.

The research on social evaluation is an impor-
tant measure for higher scienti
ﬁ
c level and
democratization level, and will have a positive
effect on the decision-making of public order
management in China. In addition, the publica-
tion of relevant scienti
ﬁ
c methods, scienti
ﬁ
c
research procedures and victims related issues
will promote the study of Victimology.

27.3.4
Victimological Issues from the
Psychological Perspective

In the early 1980s, Chinese scholars already had
some explorations on the issue of victims from
the psychological perspective, and published a
number of professional articles and academic
papers as well. The book titled “Psychology of


424
W. Dawei and T. Longfei
Victims,” published by Ren Keqin in 1997, con-
ducted a systematic and complete interpretation
on psychological problems of victim, deepened
such psychological viewpoints as victims’ differ-
ent types of psychological phenomena, psycho-
logical phenomena in the developing process of
victim behavior, victim psychological issues of
different nature, comprehensive problems of vic-
tim Psychology, and supported the development
and improvement of Victimology. Currently,
domestic Victimology mainly analyzed victims’
mental activity, psychological behavior in the
course of criminal legal proceedings, psychologi-
cal reactions and characteristics during the pro-
cess of victimization, psychological motivation
of transforming from victims into offenders,
offenders’ punishment and restitution, redemp-
tion for victim psychological comfort, etc. Some
scholars in China also explored and researched
such as related to victims, public security feel-
ings surveys, psychological problems of disasters
and accidents, and victim psychological interven-
tion involved in many well known cases with a
certain degree of innovation.

27.3.4.1
Victims Involved in Serious and
Major Cases

Some scholars like Luo Dahua
(
1983
)
, Ren Keqin

(
1997
)
, Wu Boxin, Li Meijin, and Zhao Guifen
carried out relevant studies on psychological
aspects of victims.

During the law enforcement agencies under-
taking the policy of cracking down crime period,
Chinese society made great efforts to control vari-
ous criminal activities in the severest way. In these
cases, a considerable number of offenders (recidi-
vism, recidivists) in notorious and well known
cases had been victims themselves before com-
mitting their delinquent acts. The psychological
changes of victims and psychological process of
transforming victims into offenders after the inci-
dent had been given much attention and researched
by relevant scholars. The professors, in psycho-
logical
ﬁ
eld, like Li Meijin in her research project,
made a detailed study on offender psychological
condition involved in some serial killers. They
analyzed offender psychological transformation
affected by the occurrence of victim before the
criminal behavior in serial crimes. Moreover, the
transforming process from victim to offender was
also studied. This helps promote the protection of
victims’ rights and helps to better control and pre-
vent additional crimes, especially, where the
offending party may have previously been a vic-
tim himself.

In psychological researches, some scholars
focused on typical victims such as serial crimes,
victim psychological characteristics after the
injurious act, and typical victims in large-scale
domestic events and activities. Their psychologi-
cal features, causes, as well as attitudes were spe-
cially valued. They not only stressed on the
persistence and diffusion of victims’ state of
mind and their weak mentality, analyzed the rea-
sons why such situations occurred but also stud-
ied their social cognition and attitudes after the
injurious act. Such methods as observation, inves-
tigation, tests and experiments were applied in
serial murder cases to study in
ﬂ
uencing social
factors, Psychology and motivation accounting
for offenders’ transformation from a victim into
an offender. In this way, one may
ﬁ
nd and dis-
cover the transforming process between victims
and offenders, towards pick-uping the rights of
potential victims, and can make greater efforts in
upgrading the roles of victims. The case of Yao
Jiaxin in 2011 was quite an opportunity for explo-
ration for China’s scholars in the research of vic-
tim Psychology in major cases. They also carried
out research and exploration on posttraumatic
stress disorder of victims (post-traumatic stress
disorder; PTSD), which had a close relationship
with the development of Victimology.

Research in this aspect had an active effect on

ﬁ
nding out psychological problems of recidivism
and recidivists and protecting the rights of
victims.

27.3.4.2
Public Security
Feelings Survey

To public security feelings, as a psychological
phenomenon, is also an important subject in
Psychology in China. Scholars including Wu
Zongxian, Zhang Pan Shi, Wei Wang, and Juju
Wang performed relevant researches in this area.
A wide view of all the de
ﬁ
nitions of public secu-
rity at home and abroad, they generally involved
the following four aspects: subjective concerns


425
27 The Retrospect and Prospect of China’s Victimology
about existing crimes; subjective preservation
towards threats of crimes in one’s own environ-
ment, evaluation for victimization; a series of
behaviors and impact caused by the situation of
public security feelings.

In 1983, the Communist Party of China (CPC)
Central Committee, State Council and the
National People’s Congress (NPC) Standing
Committee released documents concerned with
the decision to carry out activities aimed at

ﬁ
ercely cracking down on serious criminal
offenders. They proposed for the
ﬁ
rst time that
granting the public with a greater sense of public
security would be one of the hallmarks to present
a fundamental improvement in public order.
China’s study on public security feelings began
in the mid-1980s, among which the most
in
ﬂ
uential study was Indicators and Evaluation of
Public Security Feelings chaired by the Institute
of Public Security of P.R.C. Public Security
Ministry. In the course of building a system of
public order and indicators of public security
feelings, the subject considered indicators and
evaluation of public security feelings as one of its
three sub-topics. It adopted a self-designed ques-
tionnaire on public security feelings and common
indicators used in evaluating fear of crime, set
the coef
ﬁ
cients of public security feelings, and
investigated the factors affecting public security
feelings and conducted statistical analysis. From
the very beginning, studies on public security
feelings in China had very signi
ﬁ
cant practicality
in that they provided bene
ﬁ
cial data for social
and national decisions. During the process of
social comprehensive
control and constructing
safe and civilized
quarters in some districts, pub-
lic security feelings was noticed in different
points, which improved the sense of public secu-
rity. However, researches in public security feel-
ings mainly focused on social object and objective
environmental effects on people, while ignored
the problems of their
psychological qualities and
personalities (Table
27.1
).


In recent years, some Chinese scholars have
done plenty of research on victims’ public secu-
rity feelings to reveal the functions of factors of
victimization. These studies aimed at making up
previous de
ﬁ
ciencies from the perspective of

victims’ and even the whole society’s public
security feelings, in order to form a comprehen-
sively subjective and objective evaluation sys-
tem. Now, while there are relevant statistics for
national investigation on public security feelings
in the National Bureau of Statistics in China, at
present theoretical exploration and practical situ-
ation is still needed to be improved and deepened
both in width and depth.

China’s investigations on public security feel-
ings demonstrated four developing trends: com-
bination of of
ﬁ
cial evaluation and social
evaluation, combination of subjective indicators
and objective indicators, combination of process
and result, combination of collaboration and
technology. Projects of evaluation also started to
re
ﬂ
ect in such objects of evaluation as well-
being-indicators, exploration of “Evaluation of
Happy City Index,” exploration of “Evaluation of
Safe City Index,” and exploration of “Evaluation
of Safe Community Index.”

27.3.4.3
Disasters, Accidents and Victims’
Psychological Intervention

Some scholars, Wang Dawei, Guo Taisheng
(
2006
)
,
Zhang Peibin, and Zhu Zonghan, have conducted
researches in the aspects of disasters, accidents,
and victims’ psychological intervention.

Chinese scholars did evaluating research for
victims in disasters, accidents and for in
ﬂ
uences
on victims based on severity of their psychologi-
cal hurt, emotional state, degree of physical
injury, suicide risk, and damage of the social
foundation. They also assessed the process of
impact upon victims before, during and after the
disaster, in addition to evaluation on victim
results and social impacts. The study set up basic
principles and intervention methods and means
in the aspects of victim intervention. The most
important relief for victims was a distinction
among three stages of pre-disaster, disaster, disas-
ter relief, and to propose ways to improve psy-
chological intervention of Chinese victims and
assistance: improvement of corresponding man-
agement system, strengthening social advocacy
and basic knowledge, cultivating a professional
organization and personnel for psychological
intervention. China is a disaster-prone area, so
relevant researches and explorations in this
ﬁ
eld
are being gradually carried out.


426
W. Dawei and T. Longfei

In China, study of law, Sociology, study of
Public Administration and Psychology are com-
monly recognized normative social sciences.
Researches in these
ﬁ
elds have signi
ﬁ
cant effects,
and can play a very positive part in promoting the
development of other disciplines. During the
search of development, China’s Victimologists
ought to make an active combination with Chinese
national conditions and to absorb the research
results of advantage disciplines, construct the vic-
timological discipline system, form researching
character with the developing country. This will
eventually lead to the formation of their own meth-
ods of researching core issues and the integration
of many disciplines in order to promote the local-
ization development of Victimology in China.


27.4

Developing Prospective
of Victimology in China

China, with its long history, is the world’s largest
developing country. It is currently in the period of
developing
transition,
uneven
development
among regions, with social justice mechanism
needing to be strengthened, a gradual increase of
serious crime trends, etc., and thereby demon-
strates many relevant characteristics which are as
follows: not only traditional types of crime con-
tinued to abundantly exist, but there also has seen
an increase in more intelligent modern crimes.
As a result, the situation of victims and the vic-
timological studies is bound to have the same
features as other developing countries in Asia
and its own social characteristics under the
in
ﬂ
uence of international community.

27.4.1
Prominent Issues of the Victims
During the Recent Period

Now victim issues in China have some obviously
different convex points and order. Such problems
were given more attention as agriculture, laid-off
workers, population and ecology, education
crisis,
moral standard and norms anomie, marital and
family discord, violence in schools, youth abuse,
corruption, family violence, network, telecom
fraud victims and intellectual property. These issues
strikingly showed China’s situation as a developing
country in Asia. The research and development of
victim in China had a close relationship with these

social issues, and brought out victims problems
with unique Chinese characteristics, including
labor claims of migrant workers, juvenile victims,
women victims, elderly victims, courageous vic-
tims, victims of violent crime in schools, network
victims, telecom fraud victims, robbery and snatch
victims, overseas victims and victims of intellec-
tual property rights. These problems embodied
some similar aspects among victims in Chinese
society and international community, and high-
lighted the unique nature of Chinese society and
other developing-country societies.


27.4.2
Localization of China’s
Victimology

The problem of victim in China was affected by
the historical conditions and cultural traditions
and undeveloped levels, thus Victimology has its
own development track in China. China is a
Socialist society which sprung from both a semi-
colonial and semifeudal society. It overlooked the
cognition development stage by paying no atten-
tion to the victim, abusing the rights of the victim
in Western capitalistic stage. Three schools are
produced with international development of
Victimology, including the Positive School,
Radical School and Critical School, which have
certain in
ﬂ
uence on the development of
Victimology in China, but
lacking unique theories
suitable for solving the victim problem in China.
The development of Victimology in China and its
becoming of a subject without controversy will be
a long-term process. First, Chinese scholars will
develop
constructions
for
the
subject
of
Victimology itself in depth during that process,
such as the basic category, theory and system.
Second, they will further probe into various vic-
tim problems in relevant types of victim research
along with the emergence of victim in Chinese
society. Third, with the further development of
relevant social sciences, China’s Victimology will
also integrate the knowledge of other subjects for
use, such as Sociology, Psychology, etc., so that
the subject itself will have certain absorbing power
and tension, and it shall make progress in synthe-
sis and application in the development path of
subject. The researcher group of Victimology in
China needs to be strengthened and perfected, and
corresponding academic research organization
shall be established, so as to
ﬁ
nish the construc-
tion of a foundation platform for the research and
development of Victimology.


27.4.3
Development and Perfection
of the Relevant Social System

The application of Victimology is always stressed
in the Victimology research in China, and that
will have important promoting effect for the con-
struction of various systems. Mature system for
protecting the rights and interests of victim needs
to be built in the development of Victimology in
China, corresponding legislation and law enforce-
ment system needs to be established and per-
fected, and other corresponding system shall be
constructed for forming a complete set, so as to
practically protect the rights and interests of vic-
tim. In the process of system construction, China
will
ﬁ
rst be aimed at all-round development and
perfection of rule of law, so as to promote the
development and perfection of the social system
for Victimology. Second, in the system for con-
crete criminal victim, criminal law and code of
criminal procedure as well as other laws will be
further revised. For the legal status of victim,
there shall be more
profound and explicit stipula-
tions in the judicial procedure on the indemnity
and restitution to victim as well as the concrete
right and obligation of victim. The construction
of judicial system and the practice of law enforce-
ment will be increasingly developed, and they
will become more sound and perfect, and greater
development will be achieved it relevant aspects
involved in it that are bene
ﬁ
cial for the victim
rights, such as the organization of judiciary, stan-
dard and regulation for law enforcement as well
as guarantee of relevant procedure, etc. Third,
construction of other systems in Chinese society
will also be further developed, and they shall be
constructed in an all-round way in the compre-
hensive decision-making and implementation
mechanism for social development, appraisal
mechanism for social in
ﬂ
uence, network mecha-
nism for social safety, and management mecha-
nism for social risk, so as to enhance the protection


428
W. Dawei and T. Longfei
to rights of victim, and promote the development
of relevant subjects pertaining to Victimology.

27.4.4
Construction of Victim Support
Mechanism

From the beginning of the 21st century, Chinese
scholars began to perform large-scale systematic
research on the construction of victim support
mechanisms, and there is still a great shortage in
theoretical research and practical application. In
“Certain Idea about Developing the Work of
Criminal Victim Support” (2011), China shall
stipulate the condition, standard and procedure
for criminal victim support, and shall try to
strengthen protection to the rights of criminal
victims in support mechanisms. With the further
development of the working mechanism of crim-
inal victim support, and future research on mech-
anism of victim support, Chinese scholars will
put forward more proposals with greater opera-
bility combined with the national conditions of
China, perfect special legal and institutional sys-
tems for victim support, establish and perfect the
organizational system for social support for vic-
tim. In particular, in the concrete operation hori-
zon of victim support, we shall promote the
development of victim support practices, such as
the setting up of support organizations, selection
of support modes, support funds, support for spe-
cial types of victim, etc., so that social develop-
ment will be more stable and harmonious, and
the Victimological values of social equality and
justice shall be amply embodied.

27.4.5
Internationalization of China’s
Victimology

Victimology has a development history of decades
in Chinese academic circles, and while some
scholars actively attend international exchange
and cooperation events, current international
exchange is still not suf
ﬁ
ciently extensive and
deep, especially in regards to adjacent Asian
countries which is still insuf
ﬁ
cient. At present, on
the basis of establishing special committees for
victims, China will actively draw on the experi-
ence
from
countries
more
advanced
in
Victimology
research, such as Japan and Republic of Korea in
Asia, and establish a national research platform.
In addition, China shall periodically host interna-
tional seminars on Victimology in order to
actively attract relevant foreign scholars to par-
ticipate in these activities in China. In addition,
Chinese scholars shall actively go abroad to for-
eign countries to further their knowledge, partici-
pate in ground breaking research and shall draw
valuable experience from such opportunities.
They will attend international conferences meet
with victims, and doctors. This will encourage
more scholars to pursue advanced studies abroad;
and by strengthening international exchanges,
China’s scholar shall reap the bene
ﬁ
ts from the
more experienced scholars on Victimology which
in turn will help promote the further development
of Victimology in China.

The development of Victimology in China is
not only the product of its greater demand in
China but also the crystallization of wisdom
under relevant academic in
ﬂ
uence of interna-
tional Victimology. In such a historical course,
we can see many experiences and lessons worth
deep thinking and analysis in the knowledge and
origin of Victimology in China. China’s scholars
are inspired to learn from the countries and schol-
ars in the front lines of research in the world.
Only so can the experience of China be expected
to further develop itself, not only for the bene
ﬁ
t
of the Chinese people but also to better contribute
and even bene
ﬁ
t Asian society and even the
International Community.

In Chapter 21 (Under heading 21.3.4 “Respondents Who Experienced Violence in the Last 12 Months”)
on page 334, the number of respondents was incorrectly noted in the sentence “The proﬁle of 53 respon-
dents who have experienced physical or sexual violence in the last 12 months is shown below as com-
pared to the proﬁle of all respondents in survey (see Table 21.2).” There were 22 respondents, not 53.
Corrections to Chapter 21 Violence Against Women in Singapore: Initial Data from the International
Violence Against Women Survey published in Handbook of Asian Criminology (Springer, 2013)
The calculation of violence in the last 12 months was wrongly based on incidence of violence rather
than the prevalence of violence (ie multiple incidents were counted even though some victims were
victimised repeatedly). This led to the wrong ﬁgure of 53 respondents being reported when it should
be 22 unique victims only who experienced violence in the last 12 months. This error has an impact
on some of the data that was reported. The ﬁnal report of the survey can be found at:
http://www.ncss.org.sg/documents/Singapore%20IVAWS%20(ﬁnal%20report).pdf.
Under “21.3.2 Experience of Violence in the Last 12 Months” on page 332, right column, it
should read:
“The respondents in the Singapore survey reported the lowest rate of 1-year violence victimisation
(1.1%) as compared to the other IVAWS participating countries (see Fig. 21.3). Singapore, together
with Switzerland, had the lowest rate of 1-year physical violence victimisation (1.0%). Singapore also
had the lowest rate of 1-year sexual violence victimisation (0.3%) as compared to the other IVAWS
participating countries (see Fig. 21.4).”

Under “21.3.3 Repeat victimisation” on page 333, left and right columns; page 334, left column),
it should read:
“A total of 67.6% of victims experienced repeated victimisation in Singapore. This comprised 32.9%
who experienced violence two to four times; 15.2% who experienced violence ﬁve to nine times; and
19.5% who experienced violence ten times or more.
Repeated victimisation was higher for those who experienced physical violence (75.2% of victims of
physical violence experienced repeated victimisation) as compared to victims of sexual violence
(42.6% of victims of sexual violence experienced repeated victimisation).”
