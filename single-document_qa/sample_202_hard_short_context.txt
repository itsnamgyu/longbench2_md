INTRODUCTION
As a result of extensive research efforts on the development
of low temperature polymer electrolyte fuel cells (PEFCs)
over the past decade, the voltage performance of mem-
brane electrode assemblies (MEA) has been signiﬁcantly
increased.[1] The major development steps enabling these
improvements have been:
(i)
The introduction of thinner membranes (from the
original 175/125 µm thick Naﬁon 117/115 mem-
branes[2, 3] to 50 µm thick Naﬁon 112, (see Durabil-
ity, Volume 3) all the way to ultra-thin polytetraﬂu-
oroethylene (PTFE)/ionomer composite membranes
from Asahi Glass (30 µm see Composite perﬂuo-
rinate membranes, Volume 3) and Gore (25 µm see
Catalyst coated composite membranes, Volume 3)),
thereby allowing for high cell voltages at current den-
sities ≥1 A cm−2.
(ii)
The substitution of Pt-black catalysts with carbon-
supported Pt-catalysts which resulted in a reduction
of the MEA Pt loading from 5–10 mgPt cm−2 to
<1 mgPt cm−2.[3–5]
(iii)
The invention of thin-ﬁlm catalyst layers bonded by
perﬂuorosulfonic ionomer which resulted in largely
improved utilization of the Pt/metal catalysts in the
electrodes.[1, 6]
Due to these innovations in materials and processing tech-
nology, state-of-the-art fuel cells yield cell voltages of
0.68 V at 1.0 A cm−2 and 65 ◦C cell temperature with ambi-
ent pressure H2/air at stoichiometric ﬂows of 1.25/2.0
(fully humidiﬁed) and cathode loadings of 0.4 mgPt cm−2
(see Principles of MEA preparation, Volume 3).[7] This
may be contrasted to older MEA technology, where only
0.60 V were achieved at 1.0 A cm−2 under much higher
pressure (H2/air at 300 kPaabs), while all the other condi-
tions were comparable (70–80 ◦C cell temperature, stoi-
chiometric ﬂows of 1.5/2.0 (fully humidiﬁed), Pt loadings
of <1 mgPt cm−2
MEA
[3]).
Despite these development achievements, further improv-
ements in MEA performance are required for the imple-
mentation of fuel cells in stationary power plants and in
vehicles, where high voltage efﬁciency (i.e., high cell volt-
ages) and low noble metal loadings are prerequisites for
large-scale applications. Of particular importance are MEA
improvements which enable both a process-stream simpli-
ﬁcation of the fuel cell system by reducing the currently
required humidiﬁcation of the reactant gases and a reduc-
tion of the platinum-metals loading of the MEA. While
the former may be achieved by the use of ultra-thin mem-
branes (as will be discussed later), the latter requires a
clear understanding of the trade-off between cell voltage
and Pt catalyst loading. Owing to the high catalytic activ-
ity of Pt toward H2 electrooxidation (exchange current
densities on the order of 10−3 A cm−2
Pt
[8]), the anode Pt load-
ings in the case of pure H2, operation can be reduced to
0.05–0.10 mgPt cm−2 without any cell voltage losses.[9–11]

Polymer electrolyte membrane fuel cells and systems (PEMFC)
can be achieved at a total Pt loading of 0.45 mgPt cm−2
MEA
(0.05/0.40 mgPt cm−2 anode/cathode loadings), the result-
ing Pt-speciﬁc power density of ca. 0.66 gPt kW−1
el
is quite
impressive, but further reductions in the cathode Pt load-
ing are still required for large-scale fuel cell applications.
Unfortunately, the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) kinet-
ics on Pt are approximately ﬁve orders of magnitude slower
than the H2 oxidation kinetics (exchange current densi-
ties on the order of 10−8 A cm−2
Pt (see Principles of MEA
preparation, Volume 3)), so that reduction in cathode Pt
loadings to commercial targets without compromising per-
formance is a signiﬁcant technical challenge.
To increase MEA performance and to reduce its Pt-
metals loading, it is therefore critical to understand the
various voltage loss contributions in order to determine
whether improvements can be achieved via optimization
of the electrode structure and the diffusion medium prop-
erties (improved catalyst utilization and reduced gas diffu-
sion overpotentials) and further reduction of the membrane
thickness (reduced ohmic losses in the membrane and
improved water management), or whether the implemen-
tation of alternative cathode catalysts (e.g., Pt alloys see Pt
alloys as oxygen reduction catalysts, Volume 3) is essen-
tial for further Pt loading reductions.
In this chapter, we attempt to provide answers to these
questions by analyzing the performance of state-of-the-art
MEAs with various Pt cathode loadings using 50 cm2 fuel
cell testing with H2/O2, H2/air, and H2/helox (21% O2 in
He) feed gases. Based on this analysis it is then possible
to isolate the various cell-voltage loss terms[2, 12, 13] into
kinetic losses (due to the slow ORR kinetics), ohmic losses
(contact and bulk electronic resistances as well as pro-
ton conduction resistance in the membrane), and transport
losses (H+ potential gradients in the electrode and gas dif-
fusion overpotentials). The ﬁndings with 50 cm2 active area
MEAs will subsequently be compared to data from a full-
active-area short stack (500 cm2 active area, ca. 20 cells)
to demonstrate their relevance to the prediction and under-
standing of fuel cell stack performance. Finally, we will
present data on the effect of membrane thickness and equiv-
alent weight (gpolymer mol−1
H+) on the feasibility of operating
with dry air feed streams.

EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURE
2.1
MEA preparation
Catalyst-coated membranes (CCM) for both small-scale
(50 cm2) and short-stack testing (500 cm2) were prepared
by an identical procedure.[14] Carbon-supported Pt cata-
lyst (47%wt Pt/Vulcan XC72; Tanaka, Japan) and ionomer
solution (5%wt Naﬁonin organic solvents, 1100 equiv-
alent weight (EW); DuPont, USA) were used to fabri-
cate thin-layer electrodes which were transferred via a
decal method onto extruded Naﬁon 112 membrane (50 µm
thickness, 1100 EW; DuPont) or a thinner 1100 EW mem-
brane to be referred to here as N111 (25 µm thick-
ness, 1100 EW, extruded in sulfonyl ﬂuoride form from
DuPont and hydrolyzed to proton form by Ion Power,
USA. A Naﬁon/carbon ratio of approximately 0.8/1 (weight
ratio) was maintained in the electrodes of all prepared
CCMs and all anode catalyst loadings were 0.4 mgPt cm−2
(note: cm2 always refers to the geometric electrode area
unless otherwise speciﬁed). The cathode catalyst load-
ings were varied from 0.4 to 0.15 mgPt cm−2 (the mea-
sured Pt loading variations by cyclic voltammetry were
consistent with the Pt loading predicted by the varia-
tion of the coating process), resulting in thinner cath-
ode layers for lower loadings, shown in Table 1. Elec-
trode porosities were calculated from measured electrode
thicknesses and remained constant as the catalyst load-
ings were varied, indicating that the electrode structure
was independent of the applied Pt loading. The observed
average porosity of 64% (see Table 1), characteristic for
our CCM preparation method, is quite large compared
to other reports in the literature (e.g., 30% porosity in
Ref. [15]); consequently, the electrodes’ Naﬁon volume
fractions are only ca. 15%. For comparison purposes, com-
mercial CCMs with active area of 500 cm2 were obtained
from Gore (GorePrimea, 25 µm thick and 0.4 mgPt cm−2
per electrode).
Gas diffusion media (DM) were treated in-house and
are based on carbon ﬁber paper substrates (Toray Inc.,
Japan). Both anode and cathode DMs were teﬂonated and
additionally processed using a proprietary surface treat-
ment. Single cells (50 cm2 active area) and a 20 cell short
stack (500 cm2 active area) were assembled by sandwich-
ing CCMs between the appropriate DMs and applying an

Porosities are based on measured electrode thicknesses and the
approximate bulk densities for the ionomer, the carbon-support
(ca. 2 g cm−3 each) and platinum (21.5 g cm−3) using a 47%wt
Pt/Vulcan catalyst (Tanaka TKK) and approximate Naﬁon/carbon
loadings of 0.8/1 (weight ratio).

Catalyst characterization
The Pt catalyst surface area (sometimes referred to as the
electrochemical area (ECA)[5]) was determined using a thin-
ﬁlm rotating disk electrode (TF-RDE) method described by
Schmidt et al.[16] (also see Rotating thin-ﬁlm method for
supported catalysts, Volume 2) A Pt foil counter-electrode
and a saturated calomel reference electrode were used in
a standard three-compartment electrochemical cell. (All
potentials, however, are reported in terms of the reversible
hydrogen electrode (RHE) scale.) A glassy carbon disk
electrode (0.283 cm2 area), mounted in an interchange-
able rotating disk electrode (RDE) holder (Pine Instru-
ments, USA) served as substrate for depositing the Pt cat-
alyst. A representative cyclic voltammogram of the 47%wt
Pt/Vulcan XC72 catalyst (7 µ gPt cm−2) in 0.5 M H2SO4 at
20 mV s−1 is shown in Figure 1. To normalize for the Pt
mass, mass speciﬁc current densities (i.e., A mg−1
Pt ) are plot-
ted along the y-axis. Integration of the coulombic charge,
Q in (C), under the hydrogen desorption region from ca.
0.05–0.4 V (vs. RHE), corrected for the double-layer capac-
itance of the carbon support and Pt (see light gray line in
Figure 1), was used to calculate the speciﬁc Pt surface area,

the catalyst (i.e., APt,cat) is available for the electrochemical
reaction due to either insufﬁcient contact with the solid
electrolyte or due to electrical isolation of catalyst particles
from each other by a ﬁlm of the electrically non-conducting
solid electrolyte. Therefore, the Pt utilization of a solid
polymer electrode is generally measured independently by
recording a cyclic voltammogram of an MEA (i.e., a CCM
sandwiched between DMs or a membrane sandwiched
between catalyst-coated DMs) in a fuel cell, using the so-
called driven-cell mode. For example, to determine the
accessible Pt surface area of a cathode electrode (also
referred to as the electrode Pt surface area (EPSA)[5]),
the cathode compartment of a single polymer electrolyte
membrane (PEM) cell is purged with humidiﬁed N2 and
serves as working electrode, while the anode compartment
is purged with humidiﬁed H2 serving as both counter and
reference electrode (effectively a RHE). This is shown in
Figure 1 for a 0.4/0.4 mgPt cm−2 (anode/cathode) Naﬁon
112-based MEA. The accessible Pt surface area, APt,el,
is evaluated from the H-desorption charge according to
equation (1) (corrected for the double-layer contribution
from both Pt and the carbon support (dashed line in
Figure 1)) and is then used to determine the Pt utilization,
uPt, in the cathode of the MEA

the values reported for state-of-the-art electrodes which
typically range from 75 to 100% (see Principles of MEA
preparation, Volume 3). Therefore, within the error of the
measurement, state-of-the-art MEAs do approach 100% Pt
utilization, in contrast to older MEA technology where Pt
utilizations were limited to a range of 10–50%.[5] Note that
uPt approaching 100% in the cyclic voltammogram (CV)
experiment (≈0.01 A cm−2) does not necessarily indicate
high utilization in fuel cell operation where mass transport
limitations can result in poor under-load (≈1 A cm−2)
utilization of portions of the catalyst layer.
Due to the low but ﬁnite solubility and diffusivity of
H2 in the ionomer,[1] H2 permeates from the anode com-
partment of a PEMFC to the cathode, where it is oxi-
dized electrochemically in the typical cathode potential
(0.5–1.0 V vs. RHE, depending on the current density).
The resulting parasitic H2 oxidation current density is gen-
erally referred to as H2-crossover current density, ix, and
can be determined experimentally using the driven-cell
mode described above, by polarizing the N2-purged cath-
ode compartment at >+0.4 V with respect to the H2-purged
anode compartment. (At >+0.4 V, the resulting H2 oxida-
tion current density is purely limited by the H2 permeation
rate.) This method is described in detail in Principles of
MEA preparation, Volume 3, where it is also shown that
the observed H2-crossover current density increases with
increasing H2 partial pressure and increasing cell temper-
ature. For this study, we experimentally evaluated the H2-
crossover current densities for Naﬁon 112-based electrodes
under fully humidiﬁed conditions at both 270 kPaabs and
80 ◦C (i.e., pH2 = 223 kPaabs) and 120 kPaabs and 60 ◦C (i.e.,
pH2 = 100 kPaabs), yielding values of 3.3 and 0.9 mA cm−2,
respectively. It may be noted that these values, used in the
kinetic analysis of our experimental data, are ca. 35% lower
than the values reported in Principles of MEA prepara-
tion, Volume 3, reﬂecting the large experimental error in
the evaluation of the H2 permeation rate.
2.4
Fuel cell testing
Fuel cell stations from Fuel Cell Technology (Los Alamos,
NM) were used to test 50 cm2 active-area MEAs. Pure
oxygen, helox (21% O2 in Helium), and air were used as
cathode reactants and pure H2 as anode reactant (all gases
of 99.99% purity). Stoichiometric ﬂow rates of anode and
cathode gases were used over the entire current density
range of 0.022–1.8 A cm−2, using stoichiometries (s) of 2.0
for H2, air, and helox while s = 9.5 was used for pure O2
(thereby maintaining the same ﬂow rates and humidiﬁcation
conditions as with air and helox). Reactant humidiﬁcation
was achieved by water-bubblers, the temperature of which
was calibrated to yield the quoted relative humidity (RH)
values. Cell resistances as a function of current density
(i.e., the sum of the proton-conduction resistance in the
membrane and the various electronic resistances (bulk and
contact resistances)) were determined using an alternating
current (a.c.) perturbation at 1 kHz. For each data point,
the cell voltage was stabilized over 15 min, and data were
averaged over the last 5 min. Multiple-path serpentine ﬂow-
ﬁelds (2 and 3 parallel channels for the anode and cathode,
respectively) machined into sealed graphite blocks (Poco)
were used for 50 cm2 testing. The ﬂow-ﬁeld channel width
was approximately 0.80 mm with a channel/land width ratio
of 1.3 l−1.
For stack testing, 500 cm2 active-area MEAs with dif-
ferent catalyst loadings and membranes were tested in the
same stack. Performance data shown in this work represent
the average of four nominally identical samples in the same
short-stack (ca. 20 cells). Cell resistances in the short stack
were measured the same way as in the above described
50 cm2 testing. The ﬂow-ﬁeld conﬁguration of the short
stack is proprietary; for short stack testing Hydrogenics test
stands were used.

Oxygen reduction kinetics in PEFCs
To evaluate the impact of the ORR kinetics on PEFC per-
formance, catalyst-coated Naﬁon 112 membranes (N112)
with variable Pt cathode loadings (see Table 1) were tested
with fully humidiﬁed H2/O2 reactants at 270 kPaabs and

a cell temperature of 80 ◦C. Plotting the measured cell
voltages, Ecell, as a function of geometric current density, i
(Figure 2), it is apparent that the Pt cathode loading of the
CCM strongly affects cell performance. Reducing the Pt
cathode loading from 0.4 to 0.15 mgPt cm−2 produces cell
voltage losses on the order of 35–45 mV over the entire
current density range.
A more quantitative assessment of the impact of the
ORR kinetics on PEFC performance can be achieved by
examining the resistance corrected cell voltages, EiR−free
EiR−free = Ecell + iR
(3)
where the R term in equation (3) refers to the sum of
ohmic resistance contributions produced by both electronic
(DM/ﬂow-ﬁeld and DM/catalyst layer contact resistances
as well as bulk resistances in the DM and the catalyst
layer) and protonic (H+ conduction in the membrane)
resistance losses. By correcting the raw voltage data with
experimentally determined values of R (see Section 2), the
effect of possibly varying ohmic resistances with varying
Pt cathode loadings can be eliminated from the independent
effect of Pt cathode loading on the PEFC performance.
It should be noted that in most of the past literature
studies concerned with evaluating the cathode performance
of PEFCs, the overall resistance losses, (iRﬁt), were not
measured experimentally, but were extracted from a simple

this indirect evaluation of Rﬁt is likely to be identical with
R at low current densities where mass transport losses
are negligible, it cannot accurately distinguish between true
ohmic losses (R) which can be measured experimentally
(via a.c. methods (used here) or the current-interrupt tech-
nique) and mass-transport induced voltage losses produced
by either ﬂooding of the DM/electrode and/or gas diffu-
sion overpotentials at high current densities. Therefore, the
most stringent approach to determine resistance free cell
voltages is by direct experimental measurements.[1, 10, 15]
Nevertheless, as mentioned above, this is not the case for
most small-scale PEM fuel cell studies and, furthermore, the
authors are not aware of any published data where direct
R measurements were conducted in full-active area short
stacks as done here.
Figure 3 shows the resistance corrected cell voltages
versus the H2-crossover-corrected current density (ieff =
i + ix, ix = 3.3 mA cm−2) for 50 cm2 active-area CCMs
with three different Pt cathode loadings. Use of ieff is
important for proper analysis of the cathode kinetics at
low current density where the crossover current density
approaches the measured current density. The data for
each Pt cathode loading fall onto a straight line in
this semi-logarithmic plot, with apparent Tafel slopes
of 0.063 V decade−1 (0.15 mgPt cm−2), 0.066 V decade−1
(0.24 mgPt cm−2), and 0.067 V decade−1 (0.4 mgPt cm−2)
over the entire current density range (0.02–1.8 A cm−2).
The Tafel slopes extracted from Figure 3 are consistent
with the Tafel slopes for the ORR in PEFCs reported in
the literature (ranging from 0.053–0.064 V decade−1; see
Table 3). It should be noted, however, that straight Tafel
lines up to 1–2 A cm−2 as in Figure 3 and Ref. [2] (see
also Principles of MEA preparation, Volume 3) are not
always obtained in H2/O2 PEM fuel cells and that the

increase in Tafel slopes frequently observed with increasing
current density are likely due to either imperfect electrode
structures and/or improper R corrections.[12, 15] The latter
shortcoming may also be the reason for the increase in Tafel
slope generally observed with increasing current density
in RDE measurements with both planar and supported
catalysts (see, e.g., Ref. [25]). The fact that constant Tafel
slopes are observed up to the highest current density of
1.8 A cm−2 on the other hand suggests that the performance
data shown in Figures 2 and 3 are controlled only by ORR
kinetic losses (ηORR) and ohmic resistance losses (R).
The above data and reasoning imply that both hydro-
gen oxidation kinetic losses (ηHOR) and mass-transport
losses (ηtx) are negligible for these measurements with fully
humidiﬁed H2/O2. The former assumption is quite reason-
able owing to the fast hydrogen oxidation reduction (HOR)
kinetics on Pt (see Section 1 and Refs. [9–11]), while the
latter would imply that the potential gradients in the elec-
trolyte phase of the cathodes are negligible under these
conditions (gas diffusion overpotentials with pure O2 can
safely be assumed to be negligible as long as no ﬂood-
ing of the electrodes and the DMs occur). Under these
simplifying assumptions, the general description for the
resistance-corrected cell voltage given in equation (6)
EiR−free = Ecell + iR = Erev(pH2,pO2,T )
−ηORR −ηHOR −ηtx
(6)
can be reduced (assuming ηHOR = 0, ηž
tx = 0) to:
EiR−free = Erev(pH2,pO2,T ) −ηORR
(7)
Using a Tafel approximation, the last term in equation (7)
can be described as:
ηORR = b· log

i + ix
10·(Lca·APt,el)·i0(T,pO2)

(8)
where Lca (mgPt·cm−2) is the Pt cathode loading, APt,el
(m2
Pt·g−1
Pt ) is the electrochemically available Pt surface area
in the MEA (see Section 2.3 and Table 2) and i0(T,pO2) is
the exchange-current density for the ORR which depend
on temperature and oxygen partial pressure. Equations (7)
and (8) may be combined and re-written as:
EiR−free = Erev(pH2,pO2,T ) + b· log[10·APt,el·i0(T,pO2)]
−b· log
	i + ix
Lca

(9)
where all parameters are in units as deﬁned in the list of
symbols.
Considering that the utilized Pt surface area in the different
CCMs, APt,el, is essentially independent of the Pt loading
(see Table 2), equation (9) shows that the performance of
the CCMs with different Pt cathode loadings is expected to
be identical if it is plotted as EiR−free vs. the logarithm of
(i + ix)/Lca (i.e., the mass-speciﬁc current density, im) and
if the performance is controlled only by the ORR kinetics
and the ohmic losses. The predicted slope of the resulting
line should then correspond to the Tafel slope

Replotting the data shown in Figure 3 in terms of EiR−f ree
versus the logarithm of the mass-speciﬁc current density,
im, indeed results in a single straight line with a Tafel
slope of 0.065 mV decade−1 as shown in Figure 4. As
we have argued above, this would imply that the poten-
tial gradient in the electrolyte phase of the cathode is
negligible even at high current densities. Model calcu-
lations otherwise would predict a doubling of the Tafel
slope from its value at low current densities as the cur-
rent density increases, i.e., from ca. 0.065 V decade−1 to ca.
0.130 V decade−1.[26, 27] Based on the Naﬁon volume frac-
tion of the cathodes used in our study (ca. 15%, see Table 1)

ionomer used in the electrodes (σH+ ≈0.18 −1 cm−1 at
80 ◦C in contact with liquid water[28]), the effective conduc-
tivity, σH+,eff, in the electrode may be calculated according
to Ref. [26]
σH+,eff = σH+εNaﬁon
τ
(11)
where τ is the tortuosity of the electrode structure. Even
though it is not quite understood, experiments with model
electrodes by Boyer et al.[29] indicated that the effective
tortuosity factor in the electrode of an MEA is essentially
one. Using these values, one can calculate an effective pro-
ton conductivity in our electrodes of 0.027 −1 cm−1 which
translates into an effective proton resistance in a 13 µm
thick electrode (0.4 mgPt cm−2, see Table 1) of 0.048  cm2.
In the case of a homogeneous current distribution within the
catalyst (implicitly assumed in the analysis of Figure 4),
the effective contribution of proton conduction resistance
in the catalyst layer would be 50% of the above calcu-
lated σH+,eff based value, viz., 0.024  cm2. At this point,
it is not clear why this still rather high resistance would
not produce a noticeable deviation of the data in Figure 4
from the 0.065 V decade−1 Tafel line at current densities of
≥1 A cm−2 and model experiments are currently conducted
to understand this phenomenon. For the CCMs with lower
Pt cathode loadings (i.e., thinner electrodes, see Table 1),
the calculated proton resistance in the electrode does, how-
ever, become insigniﬁcant (0.013 and 0.007  cm2 for the
7 and 4 µm electrodes, respectively).

The iR −free data were extracted from Figure 2 (80 ◦C, 100%
RH, 270 kPaabs). The solid line is a linear-regression ﬁt of all the
mass-speciﬁc current density normalized data, yielding an overall
Tafel slope of 0.065 V decade−1. Measured current densities are
corrected for H2 crossover of 3.3 mA cm−2.
In order to compare the intrinsic catalytic activity of the
Pt cathode catalyst in the CCMs prepared for this study, we
extracted the exchange-current density, i0(T,pO2), from the
data in Figure 4. This was done by extrapolating the least-
squares regression line shown in Figure 4 to the reversible
H2/O2 potential under the experimental conditions (i.e.,
Erev(pH2,pO2,T ) described by equation (5)), at which point
equation (9) can be re-written to allow for the calculation
of i0(T,pO2)

The resulting T - and pO2-dependent exchange-current den-
sity evaluated from Figure 4 is 1.2·10−8 A/cm2
Pt at 80 ◦C
and pO2 = 223 kPa (note that the H2 and O2 partial pres-
sures are calculated by subtracting the water vapor satu-
ration pressure at 80 ◦C (i.e., 47 kPa) from the total cell
pressure of 270 kPa, yielding a value of Erev(pH2,pO2,T ) =
1.199 V based on equation 5).
In order to compare this value of the exchange-current
density with literature values recorded at different H2
and O2 partial pressures, we used the partial pressure
dependence of the exchange-current density as deﬁned by
Newman[33] which than allows to determine the value of the

that the reaction order γ considers only the purely kinetic

whereby the reaction order m includes both the kinetically
and the thermodynamically induced changes in current
density with changing O2 partial pressure. Since the Tafel

outlier (data in row 10 of Table 3), all reported exchange-
current densities are in the range of 0.8–8.7·10−9 A/cm2

in the temperature range from 65 to 95 ◦C. Considering the
large experimental error associated with extrapolation of the
Tafel line over many decades in current density to obtain the
value of the exchange-current density, this large spread in

the values reported by different studies can be found for

assume that measurements were conducted on rather non-

3.1.2
Comparison of the ORR kinetics in liquid vs.
solid electrolytes
Most of the fundamental and exploratory research aimed at
both the understanding of the ORR and the development of
improved cathode catalysts is focused on the study of well
characterized electrode surfaces, the electrocatalytic activity
of which is usually tested using the RDE technique[17] (or
the thin-ﬁlm rotating ring-disk electrode (RRDE) method
for high surface area catalysts[25] (see also Poisons for the
O2 reduction reaction, Volume 2) in liquid electrolytes.
This approach not only offers a straightforward evaluation
of the electrocatalytic ORR activity of catalysts, but also
enables the determination of the reaction pathway, i.e.,
the extent of H2O2 formation as side-product in the ORR
(see Poisons for the O2 reduction reaction, Volume 2).
The open question, of course, remains whether the ORR
activity observed in liquid electrolytes is relevant for the
activity of the same catalyst if it is in contact with a
solid-polymer electrolyte. In a summary of their work,
Zawodzinski and Gottesfeld[1] conclude that there indeed
is an almost quantitative agreement between the ORR
activity of polycrystalline Pt in contact with aqueous acidic
electrolytes and with solid-polymer electrolytes.
In an attempt to determine whether such quantitative
agreement can also be observed for carbon-supported Pt
catalysts, we compared the ORR activity of the 47%wt
Pt/Vulcan XC72 catalyst in a catalyst coated membrane
(0.4 mgPt cm−2, see Table 1) under similar conditions as
were used in thin-ﬁlm RRDE experiments by B. Blizanac
et al.[30] These data are shown in Figure 5 and clearly
demonstrate the excellent agreement between the ORR
mass-activity in 0.1 M HClO4 and in a CCM at an
electrolyte temperature of 60 ◦C. The ORR activity of
0.06 mA cm−2
Pt
at 0.9 V (see Table 3) is identical in both
electrolytes and is also in excellent agreement with the
value determined for a 20%wt Pt/Vulcan XC72 catalyst in
0.5 M HClO4 (0.065 mA cm−2
Pt ) under otherwise identical
conditions.[25] Deviations between the ORR activity in
liquid and solid electrolyte are only observed for higher
current densities (see data point at 0.8 V in Figure 5),
which is often claimed to be due to an ORR kinetics-
induced change in Tafel slope with current density in liquid
electrolytes,[25] but it may also be due to the effect of

Nevertheless, the (thin-ﬁlm) RRDE method appears to be an
excellent and easily applied preliminary screening tool for
the evaluation of the ORR activity of new and unprobed
catalysts. This also suggests that the generally higher O2
solubility in ionomers, does not signiﬁcantly affect the ORR
kinetics, probably related to the fact that O2 solubility in
recast ionomers is not that much different from its value in
liquid acids.[1]
3.1.3
Determination of additional voltage losses for
H2/air operation
While resistance-corrected cell voltages with pure O2 were
characterized by straight Tafel slopes up to 1.8 A cm−2,
Tafel plots with air under otherwise identical condi-
tions are characterized by an increase in the apparent
Tafel slopes beyond the ORR kinetics-controlled value of
0.065 V decade−1 (see Figures 3 and 4) at current densi-
ties ≥0.2 A cm−2 (see Figure 6a). This generally observed
phenomenon[2, 10, 13] (see also Principles of MEA prepa-
ration, Volume 3) is related to the development of sig-
niﬁcant mass-transport losses (i.e., diffusion overpoten-
tials) in air due to the effect of N2 dilution. In the ORR
kinetics-controlled region with air, i.e., below 0.2 A cm−2,
a comparison of Figure 6(a) with the O2 data in Figure 3
indicates resistance-corrected cell voltage losses of ca.
35–40 mV due to lower O2 partial pressure, consistent with
other data reported in the literature[10, 13] (see also Princi-
ples of MEA preparation, Volume 3) and slightly lower
than the 50 mV observed by Ralph and Hogarth.[2]
It is common in the literature to compare the mass-
speciﬁc activities (in A mg−1
Pt ) of cathodes with different
Pt loadings in order to benchmark different MEA technolo-
gies and to determine the optimum achievable effectiveness

Beginning-of-life MEA performance – Efﬁciency loss contributions
of Pt in an MEA in terms of current produced per mass
of Pt. Traditionally, however, this has been done by eval-
uating a plot of cell voltage (Ecell) versus mass-speciﬁc
current density (im) (see Novel catalysts, catalysts support
and catalysts coated membrane methods, Volume 3).[1]
Unfortunately, such comparison is ﬂawed as it ignores the
contribution of very different ohmic voltage loss contribu-
tions (iR) if different Pt loadings are benchmarked. For
example, consider two different cathode loadings of 0.02
and 0.20 mgPt cm−2 with an effective Pt activity measured
at the same mass-speciﬁc current density of 5 A mg−1
Pt : the
low-loaded cathode would then operate at a geometric cur-
rent density of 0.1 A cm−2, while the high-loaded cathode
would operate at 1.0 A cm−2, where the ohmic resistance
contribution to the cell voltage is already on the order of the
value of the Tafel slope. Clearly, even if the true mass activ-
ities were to be identical, a plot of Ecell vs. im would yield
a signiﬁcantly lower mass-speciﬁc activity for the high-
loaded Pt cathode due to its much larger iR loss. These
differences are even more pronounced with thicker mem-
branes due to their larger ohmic resistance (compare, e.g.,
Ref. [1] and Novel catalysts, catalysts support and cat-
alysts coated membrane methods, Volume 3). Therefore,
the scientiﬁcally stringent approach for the comparison of
the effectiveness of Pt in different MEAs is an evaluation
on the basis of resistance-corrected cell voltages as was
done in Figure 6(b).
Figure 6(b) shows that the mass-speciﬁc activity of
MEAs with different Pt cathode loadings is indistinguish-
able up to ca. 1 A mg−1
Pt , showing a Tafel slope identical
with the one obtained with pure O2 (solid vs. open symbols
in Figure 6(b)). In this purely kinetically-controlled region
(i.e., im ≤1 A mg−1
Pt ), the voltage loss compared to pure
O2 again is 40 mV as has already been discussed above.
This voltage loss is due to both reduced ORR kinetics
(equation (8)) and a reduction in the equilibrium poten-
tial (equation (5)). Mathematically it can be described by
taking the partial derivative of equation 15 with respect to
the logarithm of oxygen partial pressure and combining it
with equation 16:

pH2,T,im,APt,el
= 2.303·R·T
4·F
+ b·γ = b·m (19)
Based on a value of m = 1 and a Tafel-slope of
0.065 V/dec., equation 19 would predict a decrease in cell
voltage of ca. 44 mV if O2 is replaced by air (100 →21%
O2), in reasonably good agreement with the observed volt-
age decrease of 40 mV shown in Figure 6(b).
At mass-speciﬁc current densities above 1 A mg−1
Pt ,
higher activities are observed for lower Pt loadings
(Figure 6b) which is related to the impact of signiﬁcant
mass-transport resistances which in general scale with
the geometric current density. At a given mass-speciﬁc
current density, the geometric current density is lower for
electrodes with low Pt loadings compared to high-loaded
electrodes. Therefore, ohmic and transport-related voltage
losses which increase with increasing geometric current
density lead to an apparent voltage reduction for high-
loaded electrodes if compared at constant mass-speciﬁc
current density (here, e.g., at im ≥1 A mg−1
Pt ). The relevant
design parameter for the design of PEM fuel cell systems is,
however, the geometric current density (and not the mass-
speciﬁc current density) since the power density of a fuel
cell stack is most signiﬁcantly affected by this parameter
(in essence, small changes in the cell voltage affect the
system efﬁciency, but have a lesser impact on the system
power compared to the inﬂuence of changes in geometric
current density). Therefore, an evaluation of different MEA
technologies should be done on the basis of geometric
current density and will be discussed in the next Section.
3.1.4
Determination of cell voltage loss
contributions for H2/air operation
From the above discussion of Figure 6, it is appar-
ent that the resistance-corrected air performance curves
are purely ORR kinetics-controlled at very low geomet-
ric current densities, following the same Tafel slope of
0.065 V decade−1 as was observed in pure O2 (Figure 6b).
Therefore, the cell voltage loss contribution due to the
ORR (ηORR) can be calculated by extrapolating the
resistance-corrected cell voltage at the lowest measured
current density (0.02 A cm−2) over the entire current den-
sity range using a 0.065 V decade−1 Tafel slope, as is
shown in Figure 7(a). The expected difference between
the MEAs with the highest (0.40 mgPt cm−2) and the low-
est (0.15 mgPt cm−2) Pt cathode loadings would be 28 mV
(i.e., 0.065 V × log[0.40/0.15]), in good agreement with the
30 mV difference shown in Figure 7(a). The observed dif-
ference between the 0.40 mgPt cm−2 and the 0.24 mgPt cm−2
loadings of 22 mV is, however, 8 mV larger than pre-
dicted which is probably due to errors in the repeata-
bility of voltage measurement (estimated to be within
±5 mV).
The measured ohmic resistance losses are shown in
Figure 7(b) and are, as expected, directly proportional to the
current density and essentially independent of Pt cathode
loading, ranging from 65 to 75 m cm2 (the solid line
in Figure 7(b) is a least-squares regression line of the
ohmic resistances of all three MEAs with a value of
70 m cm2). The linear dependence of E vs. i typically
holds under fully humidiﬁed conditions for 50 µm thick
N112 membranes[1] as shown in Figure 7(b); in the case
of less than 100% humidiﬁcation, however, the measured

ohmic resistance, R, increases with current density due
to membrane drying produced by the electroosmotic drag
of water from the anode to the cathode (see Section 3.3.2
and Ref. [1]). The estimated N112 membrane resistance
at 80 ◦C and full humidiﬁcation is 28 m cm2 (based on
a conductivity of 0.18 ( cm)−1)[28] and is indicated in
Figure 7(b); the membrane-related ohmic losses for state-
of-the-art 25 µm membranes are even lower, and would
result in a total ohmic resistance of only ≈55 m cm2. The
difference of ca. 42 m cm2 between the measured total
cell resistance and the estimated membrane resistance is
due to the DM/bipolar-plate and the DM/electrode contact
resistances, as well as the bulk electronic resistances in
both the diffusion medium and the electrodes. Independent
measurements for the 50 cm2 graphite cells have shown that
ca. 60% of these 42 m cm2 are due to the DM/bipolar-
plate contact resistance.[31]
Having determined the voltage losses due to the ORR
kinetics, ηORR, and the ohmic voltage loss, E, it is now
straightforward to evaluate the transport resistance related
voltage losses, ηtx, which may be due either to diffusion
overpotentials (mainly within Naﬁon-catalyst agglomerates
or produced by water ﬂooding of the DM and/or the
electrode) and/or to potential gradients in the electrolyte
phase of the electrode

Beginning-of-life MEA performance – Efﬁciency loss contributions
where, again, it is assumed that the overpotential for the H2
oxidation reaction is negligible. The calculated transport-
related voltage losses are shown in Figure 7(c) (using an
equilibrium voltage of 1.199 V based on equation (5)) and
are insigniﬁcant at current densities below 0.5 A cm−2. At
higher current densities, however, ηtx increases exponen-
tially, amounting to ≥50 mV at 1 A cm−2 and increasing
to >100 mV at 1.5 A cm−2. The origin of the much larger
transport-related voltage losses for the electrode with the
lowest Pt loading is quite puzzling, as one would expect
lower diffusion overpotentials as the electrode thickness
is being decreased (13 µm for the 0.4 mgPt cm−2 loading
vs. 4 µm for the 0.15 mgPt cm−2 loading; Table 1). This is
mainly caused by a non-optimized ionomer distribution in
the electrode, leading to noticeable electrolyte potential gra-
dients within the electrode in the case of air-feed operation
(in the case of air-feed, the majority of the O2 reduction
reaction will occur at the electrode/DM interface due to O2
concentration gradients in the electrode, contrary to fuel
cell operation with pure O2, thereby increasing the proton
conductivity requirement in the electrode). We are currently
investigating this hypothesis.
In summary, the major voltage losses are related to
the slow ORR kinetics of platinum which, of course, is
a well-known and frequently discussed fact.[2, 17] Owing
to the rather small Tafel slope of the ORR it would,
however, be conceivable to operate fuel cells at signiﬁcantly
higher maximum power current densities, if transport-
related resistances could be avoided. By these means, the
Pt requirement for the fuel cell stack could be reduced
by a large factor as will be outlined in the following.
For example, the purely kinetic penalty for doubling the
current density at maximum power from the, nowadays
typical, 0.8 A cm−2 to 1.6 A cm−2, would amount to only
0.02 V (i.e., 0.065 V× log[1.6/0.8]). Assuming the use of
state-of-the-art 25 µm membranes (see Catalyst coated
composite membranes, Volume 3), the total ohmic losses
at 1.6 A cm−2 would be ca. 0.09 V (see above estimated
55 m cm2). Therefore, in the absence of transport-related
losses and using the data shown in Figure 7(a) (ηORR ≈
0.42 V at 0.8 A cm−2 for 0.15 mgPt cm−2 cathode loading), a
cell voltage of 0.67 V (from: 0.67 V = 1.199 V −0.42 V −
0.02 V −0.09 V) could be achieved with a cathode loading
of only 0.15 mgPt cm−2. This would translate into a power
density of 1.1 W cm−2 at an energy conversion efﬁciency
of 56% and a Pt activity of ca. 0.18 gPt kW−1 (assuming
an anode loading of 0.05 mgPt cm−2; see Section 1), which
may be compared to the current value of ca. 0.7 gPt kW−1
at the same voltage efﬁciency (see Section 1). Clearly, a
reduction of transport-related voltage losses in an MEA
as well as the search for more active cathode catalysts
(see Pt alloys as oxygen reduction catalysts, Volume 3)
should be a major effort in the development of fuel cells
for commercial, particularly automotive applications.
3.1.5
Transport-related cell voltage losses in helox
vs. air
A diagnostic tool frequently used to examine the nature
of transport-related voltage losses with air is a compar-
ison of air versus helox (21% O2 in He) performance
curves[2, 12, 13] (also see Principles of MEA prepara-
tion, Volume 3). Owing to the signiﬁcantly higher dif-
fusion coefﬁcient of O2 in a He background (DO2(He) =
0.42 cm2 s−1 at 270 kPaabs and 80 ◦C[32]) versus a N2 back-
ground (DO2(N2) = 0.11 cm2 s−1 at 270 kPaabs and 80 ◦C[32]),
diffusion overpotential related transport losses would be
expected to be lower for cathode operation with helox as
compared to air. This, indeed, can be seen in Figure 8,
where helox and air performance are identical at current
densities ≤0.2 A cm−2, but start to differ by ca. 30 mV
at 1 A cm−2, with the helox performance curve follow-
ing more closely the indicated 0.065 V decade−1 Tafel line.
Similar data have been recorded in the literature, where dif-
fusion overpotentials in helox are generally negligible up to
1 A cm−2[2, 12] (also see Principles of MEA preparation,
Volume 3).
The differences between helox and air performance
become more apparent if one compares ηtx vs. i (calculated
acc. to equation (20)) as is shown in Figure 7(c) for MEAs
with a cathode loading of 0.40 mgPt cm−2 (solid (helox)
vs. open (air) circles). These differences are generally
understood to be due to poor water management in either
the diffusion medium and/or the diffusion medium/catalyst
interface, leading to a loss of the effective porosity of
the diffusion medium and, consequently, to increased
gas-phase diffusion overpotentials. Optimization of the
diffusion medium and its surface treatment (micro-porous
teﬂonated carbon layers in most cases) may help to reduce
the observed gas transport-related voltage losses and is
a key research topic aiming at the improvement of fuel
cell stack power density and the associated reduction in Pt
metal loadings.

Comparison of 50 cm2 single-cell and
500 cm2 short stack performance
Since all of the above analysis is based on 50 cm2
single-cell experiments, it is of course important to deter-
mine whether the same performance characteristics can
be observed in full-active-area short stack measurements
(500 cm2). Therefore, the resistance-corrected cell voltages
vs. the mass-speciﬁc current density performance curves

obtained in a 50 cm2 single-cell are compared in Figure 9 to
those obtained in a 500 cm2 short stack for each MEA type
(i.e., the three different cathode loadings). The difference in
performance at low im values is essentially negligible (ca.
10 mV higher for the 50 cm2 MEAs) and the same Tafel
slope of 65 mV decade−1 is obtained for both hardware plat-
forms in this region. At higher current densities, differences
up to 25 mV can be observed and it is not yet clear whether
this is related to MEA scale-up issues or to mass-transport
related issues in the stack hardware, with the latter being
more critical in larger active-area stacks where cell-to-cell
gas distribution also plays an important role. In general,
however, the agreement is quite good, substantiating the
idea that the voltage-loss analysis based on 50 cm2 single-
cell experiments is of relevance for the understanding of
large active-area stack performance.

Membrane thickness effect under fully
humidiﬁed and dry conditions
3.3.1
Performance trade-offs with fully humidiﬁed
reactants (500cm2 short stack)
The effect of membrane thickness under fully humid-
iﬁed conditions was studied in a 500 cm2 active area
short stack with MEAs based on both N111 (25 µm) and
N112 (50 µm) at identical loadings of 0.40/0.40 mgPt cm−2
(anode/cathode). Based on the discussion in Section 3.1.4,
very little difference in performance would be expected
in this case, as the membrane resistance for thicknesses
of ≤50 µm should be independent of current density.[1]
Therefore, the cell voltage difference should amount to
the current density multiplied by the difference in ohmic
resistance between N112 (estimated to be 28 m cm2,
see Section 3.1.4) and N111 (ca. 14 m cm2), viz., i ×
14 m cm2, corresponding to 14 mV at 1 A cm−2. The
observed difference in cell voltage at 80 ◦C and 270 kPaabs
with fully humidiﬁed reactants shown in Figure 10 amounts
to ca. 35 mV at 1 A cm−2, somewhat larger than the differ-
ence predicted above perhaps in part due to a larger catalyst
layer to membrane contact resistance for the N112 MEAs.
Considering, however, the large error bars (±25 mV for
N112-based MEAs) in the cell voltage measurement, this
difference may still be considered to be in quite reasonable
agreement with the predicted cell voltage changes based on
the ohmic resistance difference between fully humidiﬁed
N111 and N112.
After ohmic resistance correction of the cell voltages, the
performance of MEAs based on both membranes becomes
identical, indicating no difference in electrode performance
for both types of MEAs. It may be noted that the standard
deviations of the resistance-corrected cell voltages are very

Beginning-of-life MEA performance – Efﬁciency loss contributions
small (on the order of ±5 mV), reﬂecting a large variation in
the contact resistance of the bipolar-plates in the hardware
used for this experiment. It is, at any rate, quite clear that
the beneﬁt of thinner membranes under fully humidiﬁed
conditions is essentially limited to the difference in ohmic
resistance of water-saturated membranes and is, therefore,
rather small.
3.3.2
Performance trade-offs with dry reactants
(500cm2 short stack)
For the design of fuel cell systems for commercial applica-
tions, the balance-of-plant (BOP) components are crucial
for the overall system efﬁciency as well as, of course,
for the overall system weight and volume. For automotive
applications with their stringent volume and mass require-
ments particularly, minimization of system complexity is of
considerable importance. For this reason, the Global Alter-
native Propulsion Center of GM/Opel has been engaged in
trying to signiﬁcantly reduce the number of BOP compo-
nents, a large step of which was the omission of cathode
gas humidiﬁcation (see System design for vehicle applica-
tions: GM/Opel, Volume 4). Amongst other design mod-
iﬁcations, this can be achieved by the implementation of
thin, low equivalent weight (≤1000 g mol−1
H+) membranes,
the performance impact of which will be discussed in
the following.
Figure 11 compares the cell voltage performance at
various humidiﬁcation conditions for MEAs based on
three different membranes and ionomers (in the cat-
alyst layers): N112 (50 µm, 1100 EW), N111 (25 µm,
1100 EW), and GorePrimea(25 µm, <1000 EW, see
Catalyst coated composite membranes, Volume 3). At
0.1 A cm−2 (Figure 11a), the performance of each MEA is
independent of reactant humidiﬁcation, yielding the same
cell voltages within experimental error for both fully humid-
iﬁed gases and the combination of either fully humidiﬁed
anode-feed with dry cathode-feed (100% RH/dry) or dry
anode-feed with under-humidiﬁed cathode-feed (dry/50%
RH). The cell voltages for the low EW GorePrimeaare,
however, ca. 15–25 mV higher compared to the high EW
Naﬁon-based MEAs, indicating the advantage of using
lower EW ionomers (as there is, e.g., the 910 EW Flemion
ionomer developed by Asahi Glass, Japan (see Composite
perﬂuorinate membranes, Volume 3)) in both the mem-
brane and the electrodes.
At the
higher
current density
of
0.8 A cm−2
(see
Figure 11b), the cell voltage of the 50 µm N112-based
MEAs now strongly depends on reactant humidiﬁcation,
dropping by ca. 50 mV if dry reactant feeds are used.
Smaller humidiﬁcation-related losses are observed for the
thinner (25 µm) N111-based MEAs, but still amount to ca.
25 mV. For the low EW GorePrimea, no voltage losses

once more emphasizing the advantage of low EW ionomers.
A summary of the observed cell voltage losses produced
by using a dry cathode feed compared to fully humidiﬁed
reactants is shown in Figure 12(a). The advantage of
using thinner membranes and low-EW ionomers is quite
apparent (related to the more facile back-diffusion of
water), demonstrating that the above stated target of dry
cathode operation can be achieved without cell voltage
losses if 25 µm low EW membranes are used.

(50 µm, 1100 EW), N111 (25 µm, 1100 EW), and GorePrimea
(25 µm, <1000 EW). All MEAs have an active area of 500 cm2
with 0.40/0.40 mgPt cm−2 loadings (anode/cathode) operated in a
short stack (error bars represent cell voltage standard deviations
for three nominally identical MEAs of each kind in the stack).
Voltages were averaged between 10 and 15 min holding time at
each current density.
Using only the data in Figure 12(a), it is not clear whether
the reduced cell voltages for dry reactant-feed observed for
Naﬁon-based MEAs are only due to membrane drying (i.e.,
an increase in the ohmic resistance of the membrane) or
whether the cathode performance is compromised in addi-
tion. This can be determined by examining the resistance
corrected cell voltages: if the cell voltage loss is only due
to an increase in the ohmic resistance of the membrane,
no losses in the resistance corrected cell voltages should
be observed with dry cathode feed, while any decrease in
cathode performance due to dry-out of the ionomer in the
electrode would still produce a loss in EiR−free. The lat-
ter indeed is the case for the 1100 EW Naﬁon-based MEAs
(Figure 12b), indicating that the majority of the cell voltage
losses even for the 25 µm N111-based MEAs is due to a
loss in cathode activity, which can be explained by the for-
mation of signiﬁcant potential gradients in the electrolyte
phase of the electrode. This is in stark contrast to the zero
loss in EiR−free for the GorePrimea.
In summary, it is quite apparent that a reduction of the
BOP complexity via the omission of cathode humidiﬁcation
can only be achieved by means of thin membranes with low
EW ionomers in both the membrane and the electrodes.

CONCLUSIONS
Based on 50 cm2 fuel cell testing with O2, helox, and air we
have deconvoluted the various voltage loss terms observed
for state-of-the-art MEAs. As is well known, the major volt-
age loss is due to the slow ORR-kinetics on Pt, while the
ohmic losses due to electronic (contact and bulk resistances
for the ﬂow ﬁelds, the DM, and the electrodes) and pro-
tonic (membrane resistance) resistances are fairly small and
increase linearly with current density for thin membranes
(≤50 µm) under fully humidiﬁed conditions. Additional
transport resistances are negligible for pure O2 operation,
but become quite signiﬁcant at i ≥0.5 A cm−2 for fuel cell
operation with air. The associated voltage losses are largely
due to gas diffusion overpotentials, but small contributions
may also derive from potential gradients in the electrolyte
phase of the cathode electrode, enhanced by an inhomoge-
neous current distribution due to O2 concentration gradients
in case of operation with air. Based on the voltage-loss anal-
ysis, a trade-off between cathode Pt loading and achievable
cell voltage can be estimated.

500 cm2 short-stack performance demonstrates that the con-
clusions based on 50 cm2 data are relevant for understand-
ing and predicting full active area stack performance.
A comparison of fuel cell performance with membranes
of different thickness using different EW-ionomers shows
that the differences in the observed cell voltages are only
due to the lower ohmic resistance of thinner and low-
EW ionomer membranes in the case of fully humidiﬁed
reactants. Therefore, with membranes of a thickness of
16


Beginning-of-life MEA performance – Efﬁciency loss contributions
50 µm and thinner, the differences in fuel cell performance
with fully humidiﬁed reactants is quite small. In the case
of under-humidiﬁed or dry reactant-feed, however, the cell
voltages observed for thicker and high EW membranes are
signiﬁcantly lower than what one would predict on the basis
of their higher ohmic membrane resistance. This is related
to a drying of the cathode electrode and the associated
loss in Pt utilization which occurs due to the inferior water
management properties of thick and high EW membranes.
Therefore, system-friendly dry-reactant-feed operation can
only be achieved with thin and low EW membranes and
ionomers.
