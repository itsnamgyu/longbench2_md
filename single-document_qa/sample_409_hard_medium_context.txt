before Merdeka Day, Clause (3) of Article 15 shall have effect as if for the

Any reference in Part III of this Constitution to the status or description 
of the father of a person at the time of that person's birth shall, in relation 
to a person born after the death of his father, be construed as a reference to 
the status or description of the father at the time of the father's death; and 
where that death occurred before and the birth occurs on or after Merdeka 
Day, the status or description which would have been applicable to the father 
had he died after Merdeka Day shall be deemed to be the status or description 
applicable to him at the time of his death. This section shall have effect in 
relation to Malaysia Day as it has effect in relation to Merdeka Day.
