# Question

Which of the following statements about the metric used in the HELM benchmark is incorrect?

# Choices

- A: HELM calculated the inference efficiency of the model as part of the metric and used two different algorithms for the API model and open source model, respectively.
- B: In some evaluation fields, HELM also focuses on the robustness and fairness of model responses, not just accuracy.
- C: To evaluate the uncertainty in its prediction of the model, HELM introduced an expected calibration error and used 10 bins for evaluation.
- D: Compared to the later LLM-AS-A-JUDGE, HELM achieved the unification of all benchmark metrics to an objective determination, without relying on external model calculation methods.

# Answer

D
