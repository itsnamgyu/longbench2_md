targeted drunk driving laws and graduated licensing programs set very low legal blood alcohol content 
limits for young adult drivers and have been shown to reduce youth drinking and related harms (for 
example, Carpenter, 2004a; Voas, Tippetts, and Fell, 2003). Increases in sanctions and/or enforcement 
of age-targeted drunk driving laws might further reduce youth alcohol consumption and its related 
harms (Kenkel, 1993a). Kenkel (1993b) explores the theoretical possibility of a “teen tax” that could 
be levied only on young adults, though there is no consensus on the effectiveness of state beer excise 
taxes on youth drinking and related harms (for example, Dee, 1999; Cook and Moore, 2001). Finally, 
public health education about the risks of alcohol use has been widely mentioned as an alternative 
strategy to reduce alcohol-related harms among youths, although we are not aware of economic evalu-
ations of such policies. We focus here on the minimum legal drinking age due to recent high-profi

are much more likely to involve alcohol. The regressions include a dummy variable 
for each state (θs ) to remove time-invariant differences between states and dummy 
variables for each year ( t ) to absorb any atypical year-to-year variation.2 In addi-
tion, the regression includes state-specifi
 c linear time trends (ψst ). The inclusion 
of state-specifi
 c dummies in combination with the state-specifi
 c time trends mean 
that the regression will return estimates of how raising the drinking age changes 
the level of motor vehicle mortality in a typical state, while adjusting for any state-
specifi
 c trends in outcomes that preceded the change in the drinking age. This 
approach lets us compare people born in the same state just a few years apart who 
became eligible to drink legally at different ages. The variable MLDA (an acronym 
derived from Minimum Legal Drinking Age) is the proportion of 18 to 20 year-olds 
that can legally drink beer in state s in time t, and the coeffi
 cient on this variable 
is our best estimate of the impact on mortality rates of lowering the drinking age 
from 21 to 18.3 The regressions are weighted by the age-specifi
 c state-year popula-
tion, and the standard errors clustered on state are presented in brackets below the 
parameter estimates (Bertrand, Dufl

2 This fi
 xed effects panel approach was introduced to this literature by Cook and Tauchen (1982), who 
examined the effects of alcohol taxes on death rates from liver cirrhosis; it has now become standard 
in evaluations of this type. Note that this model cannot support inclusion of a full set of state-by-time 
fi
 xed effects, because these would also absorb almost all of the variation in the minimum legal drinking 
age variable.
3 Our parameterization of the minimum legal drinking age variable—that is, the proportion of 
18–20 year-olds in the state who are legal to drink beer—is slightly different from most previous work on 
this topic, which often includes separate controls for age-18, age-19, and age-20 state drinking ages. This 
choice has no substantive effect on the results and is only done to facilitate a more natural comparison 
with the regression discontinuity approach we describe below.

idea that different drinking ages across states created “blood borders” (Lovenheim and Slemrod, 2010).

where y is the age-specifi
 c mortality rate. MLDA is a dummy variable that takes on a 
value of 1 for observations 21 and older, and 0 otherwise. The regressions include 
a quadratic polynomial in age, f(age), fully interacted with the MLDA dummy. This 
serves to adjust for age-related changes in outcomes and, as seen in Figure 2, is suffi
 -
ciently fl
 exible to fi
 t the age profi
 le of death rates. The Birthday variable is a dummy 
variable for the month in which the decedent’s 21st birthday falls and is intended to 
absorb the pronounced effect of birthday celebrations on mortality rates. We have 
recentered the age variable to take the value zero at age 21. As a result the parameter 
of interest in this model is β1, which measures the size of the discrete increase in 
mortality that occurs when people turn 21 and are no longer subject to the minimum 
legal drinking age. The parameter β1 has the same interpretation as the parameter 
α from the panel models: it is the effect of going from no one in a population being 
allowed to drink legally to everyone in a population being allowed to drink legally.

Notes: In the table above, we present estimates of the discrete increase in mortality rates that occurs at 
age 21 with the associated standard error directly below in brackets. The regression estimates are from 
a second-order polynomial in age fully interacted with an indicator variable for being over age 21. All 
models also include an indicator variable for the month the 21st birthday falls in. Since the age variable has 
been recentered at 21, the estimate of the parameter on the indicator variable for being over 21, which we 
present in the table, is a measure of the discrete increase in mortality rates that occurs after people turn 21 
and can drink legally. The mortality rates are estimated from death certifi
 cates and are per 100,000 person-
years. The fi
 tted values from this regression are superimposed over the means in Figure 2. The mortality 
rates presented below the standard errors are the rates for people just under 21. Deaths are catgorized 
slightly differently than for Table 2. Whereas Table 2 focused on the primary cause of death listed on 
the death certifi
 cate, Table 3 considers all factors mentioned on the death certifi
 cate and imposes the 
following precedence order: homicide, suicide, motor vehicle accident, alcohol, other external, internal.

5 For consistency with the panel regression evidence presented above, we estimate the regression discon-
tinuity models of the effect of the minimum legal drinking age on mortality rates as opposed to mortality 
counts, though the latter are preferred as the population estimates used to create the rates reduces the 
precision of the estimates. This is the cause of the slight difference in the magnitude of the estimates 
from our previously published work (Carpenter and Dobkin, 2009).
6 Some research has examined the relationship between the minimum legal drinking age and risky 
sexual behavior, though we are not aware of any that uses the regression discontinuity approach. Note 
that the pharmacological effects of alcohol on sociability and disinhibition could lead drinkers to engage 
in unplanned sexual behavior or riskier sex than they would have had in the absence of alcohol. Dee 
(2001) estimates panel regressions of teen childbearing for youths in the age groups affected by the 
changes in the minimum legal drinking age. He fi
 nds that the drinking age is related to childbearing 
rates among black teens, suggesting a causal effect of alcohol use on sexual activity leading to childbirth. 
Fertig and Watson (2009) also study state drinking-age policies and fertility outcomes in a fi
 xed-effects 
framework, using data from the National Longitudinal Survey of Youths and Vital Statistics birth records. 
They fi
 nd that exposure to more permissive drinking ages increased poor birth outcomes for young 
women, especially black mothers, and they fi
 nd suggestive evidence that this is due to an increase in 
unplanned pregnancies. Finally, Carpenter (2005b) uses a similar panel approach to examine an alterna-
tive risky sexual outcome: rates of sexually transmitted infections. He fi
 nds suggestive evidence that a 
higher drinking age reduced gonorrhea rates for whites, but not for blacks.

Notes: The independent variable of interest for the regression results presented in the fi
 rst three columns 
is the proportion of 18–20 year-olds who can drink legally. These regressions are estimated using responses 
of high school seniors age 18 and older at the time they completed the Monitoring the Future survey. 
The regressions include state fi
 xed effects, year fi
 xed effects, state-specifi
 c time trends, and dummies 
for male, Hispanic, black, or other race. The regressions are estimated using a sample of 121,279 high 
school students from 1976–2003. The estimates in the last three columns are regression discontinuity 
estimates of the discrete increase in each drinking behavior that occurs after people turn 21. These are 
estimated using responses of 16,107 19–22 year-olds in the 1997–2005 National Health Interview Survey. 
These regressions include a quadratic polynomial in age interacted with a dummy for being over 21 at 
the time of the interview and the following covariates: indicator variables for census region, race, gender, 
health insurance, employment status, 21st birthday, 21st birthday + 1 day, and looking for work. People 
can report their drinking for the last week, month, or year, and 71 percent reported on their drinking 
in the past week or month. All the regressions include population weights. Standard errors for the panel 
fi
 xed-effects analysis are clustered on state and reported in brackets below the point estimates in the fi
 rst 
three columns. Robust standard errors for the regression discontinuity analysis are reported in brackets 
below the point estimates in the last three columns.

that factors other than the drinking age were responsible for the reductions in youth fatalities when 
drinking ages increased back to 21. These types of biases are not likely to affect regression discontinuity 
estimates of the minimum legal drinking age, which (as we show above) provided estimates very similar 
to the panel fi

are unlikely to account for the robust relationship between drinking ages and youth fatalities repeatedly 
documented in the fi

types of heterogeneity may be important, such as variation across states in enforcement of the minimum 
legal drinking age. This is an important area for future research.

10 There is, of course, a plausible range of estimates if one were to use different fi
 gures for the value of 
a statistical life, and indeed recent studies have returned lower estimates (see, for example, Ashenfelter 
and Greenstone, 2004). Viscusi and Aldi’s (2003) study reports that most credible studies return esti-
mates for the value of a statistical life of between 3.8 and 9 million in 2000 U.S. dollars (or 4.73 to 
11.2 million in 2009 U.S. dollars), and the 8.72 million fi
 gure we report above is the median reported 
across 32 studies. Using 4.73 million as the value of a statistical life, for example, reduces the per-drink 
estimate to $8.30 ($4.73 million * 8 deaths / 4.56 million drinks). If self-reported alcohol consumption is 
underreported by 50 percent on average (i.e., within the range as suggested by Rehm, 1998) then we are 
overestimating the cost per drink by a factor of two (i.e., the correct per-drink estimate is closer to $7.65

11 The list charges for a hospital admission by a 21 year-old with a mention of alcohol on the medical 
record are $33,059, and the list charges for an emergency department visit with a mention of alcohol on 
the medical record are $8,912 (both measured in 2009 U.S. dollars). Given that hospitals are typically 
only paid 38 percent of list charges, the costs passed on to consumers are $12,562 and $3,387 for hospital 
admissions and emergency department visits, respectively (Reinhardt, 2006).
