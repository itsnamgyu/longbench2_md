AI: To buy, or not to buy, that is the question
The technology sector has generated 32% of the Global equity return and
•
40% of the US equity market return since 2010. This has reflected
stronger fundamentals rather than irrational exuberance. The tech sector
globally has seen EPS rise c.400% while all other sectors together have
achieved c.25% from the peak pre-GFC.
The introduction of transformative technologies typically attracts
•
growing investor interest as well as significant capital and new
competition. As enthusiasm builds and stock prices increase, the sum of
individual company valuations can overstate the total potential aggregate
returns; often a bubble develops and bursts.
Historically, investors over-focus on the originators, understate the
•
impact of competition and overstate the returns on capital invested by
the early innovators. At the same time, investors tend to underestimate
the growth of new entrants to the industry that can piggyback off the
capex of others, enabling them to generate new products and services.
Valuations often also understate the opportunities that can accrue in the
non-technology industries that can leverage the technology to generate
higher returns in existing, as well as in new, product categories.
In our view, the technology sector is not in a bubble and is likely to
•
continue to dominate returns. However, concentration risks are high and
investors should look to diversify exposure to improve risk-adjusted
returns while also gaining access to potential winners in smaller
technology companies and other parts of the market, including in the old
economy, which will enjoy the growth of more infrastructure spend.

Tech’s Rational Exuberance 
Technology has been the most important driver of returns for the equity markets globally 
since the end of the Global Financial Crisis. Its performance has far outstripped other 
major sectors, and with good justiﬁcation. Earnings per share have surged while 
all industries together, outside of tech, have largely stagnated (Exhibit 1). 
Increasingly, these powerful returns have been accounted for by a small group of 
dominant companies, mainly in the US. These, too, have not reﬂected ‘irrational 
exuberance’: their earnings growth has dwarfed that of the broader market, 
justifying their performance (Exhibit 2). 
The drivers of this success have reﬂected their ability to leverage software and cloud 
computing and to fuel high proﬁtability generated by extraordinary demand growth in 
the period since 2010. But their more recent surge in performance since 2022 owes 
much to the hopes and aspirations around AI. Despite continued powerful earnings 
growth, valuations have been rising, led by an increasingly narrow group of 
‘hyper-scalers’. The question for investors is whether this is becoming a bubble 
and, even if it is not, whether the risks of such high concentration are creating a 
dangerous trap for investors, or possibly an opportunity to diversify into potential 
beneﬁciaries of these technologies through cheaper companies outside of the 
dominant few. 
Story Time 
Financial markets reﬂect and anticipate fundamentals, but sentiment can also play an 
important role as it does with other fashions and trends in broader life. In equity 
markets, narratives have the power to attract and direct much-needed capital. 
However, they can also amplify interest to the point of monopolising investor 
attention at the expense of other opportunities, and leading to unrealistic 
expectations about future proﬁts and leaving companies vulnerable to a sharp 
de-rating. In recent years, periods of intense speculation have centered on a variety of 
narratives, ranging from the dot-com and the internet boom at the end of the last

century, to China growth, Cryptocurrency, the Green transition and, most recently, AI. 
But history reveals a much longer list, much of which revolves around the emergence of 
new technologies. 
The interest that new innovations receive has been an important part of directing the 
necessary capital to grow and commercialise innovations. Very often the technologies 
behind these periods of speculation have proved to be transformational – leading to 
signiﬁcant secondary innovations, new products and services, and far-reaching societal 
changes to the way that we live, work and consume. Along the way, however, the 
excitement often turns into an obsessive fervor with investors clambering to get 
exposure to the theme at any price. That’s when bubbles emerge and, eventually, burst. 
A recent study found that in a sample of 51 major tech innovations introduced between 
1825 and 2000, bubbles in equity prices were evident in 73% of cases1. 
From an investor perspective, the success and eventual impact of an innovation cannot 
be known at the outset, and it is even more challenging predicting which competitor is 
likely to succeed over the long run. Consequently, as more new entrants emerge, 
investors tend to buy multiple companies as options on their future success, leading to 
the sum of all valuations to overstate the potential returns that can be generated by a 
technology or industry. The challenge for investors is less about whether they 
recognise an important innovation or market driver when it emerges, but more 
about whether they value the potential gains correctly and identify the correct 
winners and losers.  
This question is relevant in relation to the current focus on AI and its potential. While AI 
is not a new technology, it has captured the imagination of investors and, by association, 
companies since the launch of Chat-GPT and other large language models. The 
extraordinary beat on Nvidia investor day in July 2023 sharpened the focus on the 
potential for the industry. Since then, investors have clamoured for access to the theme 
and companies have duly responded with record numbers mentioning AI, even in 
sectors outside of the industry.

Lessons from History; the Market Risks and Opportunities in AI 
What can history tell us about the ‘life cycle’ of new innovations and how they impact 
the stock market? 
Although it is difﬁcult to generalise, some common characteristics are: 
A breakthrough technology emerges and reaches commercial scale. 
n
New companies and capital ﬂood into the space. 
n
Speculation builds and valuations of companies rise, often resulting in a bubble. 
n
The bubble bursts, but the technology tends to re-emerge as a principal driver in the 
n
economy and stock market. 
The technology/industry becomes dominated by a few large players. 
n
Secondary innovations emerge, creating new companies and products that leverage 
n
the initial technology and its increased adoption. 
Other industries are disrupted by the innovations, forcing incumbents either to adapt 
n
or disappear. 
The secondary innovations create new employment opportunities and, with them, 
n
new sources of demand as many of the beneﬁts are passed on to the consumer. 
Productivity tends to rise, but usually only after the full adoption of this new 
technology and network effects are realised.

Throughout this life cycle there are typically both risks and opportunities for investors. 
The risks include: 
Underestimating the impact of competition in driving down returns. 
1.
Overstating the returns on capital invested by the innovators that are

developing the technology. 
The upside opportunities that are often overlooked include: 
New companies that can utilise the technology to create new goods and 
1.
services to drive new sources of demand and growth. 
New markets that open up as a result of the technology. 
2.
Companies outside of the technology space that can beneﬁt from the 
3.
technology as demand patterns change. 
The impact of competition 
When new products or technologies emerge, particularly when they appear 
transformational, investors tend to underestimate the scale of new competition and its 
impact on the future returns of the incumbents or originators. There are many useful 
examples in history that demonstrate the pattern of investor excitement and the 
promise of high returns leading to a surge of competition and, ultimately, overcapacity 
that drives down returns. The result is often a large de-rating of companies in the 
industry and, in some cases, spectacular failures of companies. Nevertheless, this 
process doesn’t usually mark the end of the technology. Mostly, the infrastructure left 
behind in the wake of the initial investor surge and capex leads to the emergence 
of new products and services. 
These are often underestimated or poorly 
anticipated. 
Here are some of them: 
Books, 16th Century 
The printing press was one of the greatest ‘enabling’ technologies of all time. Following 
its invention in 1454, its impact was spectacular. According to research by Buring and 
Van Zanden2, the number of books published increased from zero to about 3 million per 
year by 1550 in Europe - more than the total number of manuscripts produced in the 
entire 14th century.  By 1800, 600 million books had been published. As with all 
technology innovations, the price of books collapsed.  
Canals, 18th Century 
The innovation of canals for transportation was an important component of the First 
Industrial Revolution. The ﬁrst canals built generated strong returns for investors, 
attracting new inﬂows of capital that pushed up stock prices and led to a bubble in canal 
stocks in the 1790s on the London Stock Exchange which peaked in 1793. By the 1800s,

the return on capital in canals had fallen from a pre-bubble peak of 50% to just 5%, and 
a quarter of a century later only 25% of canals were still able to pay a dividend3. 
Nevertheless, the canal infrastructure became instrumental in reorganising industries 
and factories, which, in turn, spawned the growth of many new industries, businesses 
and products. While many of the original companies failed, the infrastructure generated 
strong growth for others. 
Railways, 19th Century 
A similar exuberance surrounded the growth of railways in the 19th century in the UK, 
which were to become equally transformative in terms of economic growth, business 
organisation and societal change. As capital ﬂooded in, there were nearly 1,240 projects 
seeking capital by 1845 and the number of miles of network increased from 100 miles in 
1830 to 6,123 miles by 18504. A bubble in valuations of railway stocks formed in the 
1840s, and by 1850 most stocks had plummeted by an average of 85% from their peak, 
and the total value of these shares had dropped to less than half the capital spent on 
them5. As with the canals, the legacy of the infrastructure became pivotal to growth 
cities, changing demands for consumer products and other industries that followed. 
The 
T
elegraph, 19th Century 
The innovation of the telegraph in the mid-1840s had a similar effect. By 1851, there 
were more than 50 different telegraph companies competing in the US, across the 
same lines. As the returns fell, most of the ﬁrms failed or were consolidated into larger 
units. Ultimately, Western Union Telegraph took over its two major competitors and 
became the ﬁrst US nationwide monopoly in 1866. 
The 
T
elephone, 20th Century 
A similar wave of excitement followed the invention and commercialisation of the 
telephone. The expiration of Bell’s original patents in 1894 generated a surge of 
investment and competition. By 1904, 60% of American cities with more than 5,000 
people had two phone networks. The competition drove a wave of consolidation led by 
AT&T
, which was eventually restricted by an antitrust settlement in 1913 that prevented 
it from taking over independent phone companies and forced it to give up its controlling 
share in Western Union Telegraph Company. Nonetheless, the constraints on its core 
business encouraged AT&T to invest in new technologies through its Bell Laboratories 
subsidiary which became a major innovator in new areas of telecom innovation6. 
The Radio, 20th Century 
The periods after World Wars I and II (WWI and WWII) saw massive demand for 
consumer products that attracted waves of investment as new market entrants

emerged. As broadcast radio took off, for example, demand for radios surged and 
between 1923 and 1930, 60% of US families purchased a radio. In 1920, US broadcast 
radio was dominated by KDKA, but, by 1922, 600 radio stations had opened across the 
US, supported by the growing advertising industry. A bubble developed and the value of 
shares in the Radio Corporation of America (RCA), for example, rose from $5 to $500 in 
the 1920s but collapsed by 98% between 1929 and 1932, and most radio manufacturers 
failed, but the industry continued to grow, supported by advertising and the plethora of 
new consumer products that emerged. 
The personal computer (PC), 20th Century 
The PC revolution fueled a similar boom in both the number of companies and the 
valuations of new entrants in the market. While IBM facilitated the widespread 
commercialisation of the PC, hundreds of companies entered the market in the 1980s. 
In 1983, however, several companies in the sector announced losses, including Atari, 
Texas Instruments and Coleco. A collapse in PC share prices followed and many PC 
manufacturers went out of business, including Commodore, Columbia Data Systems 
and Eagle Computer. While several of the surviving businesses took many years to 
recover, the industry matured and became dominated by just a few companies. 
Internet, 21st Century 
This pattern was repeated during the internet bubble of the late 1990s. Speculation 
grew rapidly as investors began to see the potential of the internet. When search engine 
company Yahoo! had its initial public offering, its stock rose from $13 to $33 in a single 
day. Qualcomm shares rose in value by over 2,600%, 13 major large-cap stocks 
increased in value by over 1,000% and another seven large-cap stocks each rose by over 
900% in 1999. The Nasdaq index increased ﬁvefold over the period between 1995 and 
2000. In just a month after its peak in 2000, the Nasdaq had fallen 34% as hundreds of 
companies lost 80% or more of their value. The Nasdaq itself fell by nearly 80% by the 
time it troughed in October 2002. 
So, there is a fairly consistent historical pattern: radical new technologies tend to 
attract signiﬁcant capital and competition. Not all examples in history end with a 
spectacular bubble, but most do end with a downward adjustment in prices 
across the industry as returns moderate. Even in cases where a bubble bursts and 
many companies eventually collapse, this does not mean that the technology itself fails. 
However, rising competition is central to reducing returns relative to market 
expectations at the peak of the cycle. Eventually the market for the original technology 
tends to consolidate into a few large winners, and the growth opportunity shifts to 
secondary innovations or products and services that follow the original technology. 
With the current dominant companies, the conditions are unusual in that most of these 
were already dominant in the previous wave of technology — in particular software and 
cloud. The scale of proﬁtability that they achieved resulted in them being in a unique 
position to be able to absorb the very high costs of innovation in the AI space. While the 
protective ‘moats’ around the current AI winners are signiﬁcant, and valuations are not 
bubble-like, the number of new patents in this area is growing rapidly, suggesting that

new competitors will emerge and costs will come down.  The number of patent families 
(group of patents that are all related to the same invention or technology) in GenAI has 
grown from just 733 in 2014 to more than 14,000 in 20237
.  
 
While the hyper-scalers have huge scale and ability to invest in proprietary AI models, 
cheaper open source alternatives are emerging at a very rapid rate. The website 
Hugging Face, which is a network for enthusiasts, already has around 650,000 models8, 
suggesting that the typical pattern of large-scale capital growth and competition is 
happening in the AI space, just as occurred in previous waves of technology.   
Overstating returns on investment - Telecoms in the 1990s 
Just as competition is often underestimated, the returns on capital invested by 
the innovators are typically overstated. Companies at the epicenter of an innovation 
often fail to achieve the returns that their high valuations imply as the marginal cost of 
the technology falls and capacity increases over time, while a typical overlooked 
opportunity is that investors understate the returns available to new entrants in 
an industry that emerge after the initial investments are made that can piggyback 
off the capex of others.  
In the case of most major technological innovations throughout history, while the 
potential may be obvious, it is rarely clear in the early stages what business models will 
ultimately dominate to scale and commercialise the technology. This was evident in the 
early days of the internet. While there was widespread and broad speculation in any 
new company that offered potential exposure to the industry, the incumbent

winners were generally seen to be the telecom companies. They were viewed as a 
relatively ‘safe’ route to the potential fortunes that the internet may generate compared 
to the more speculative unproﬁtable dot-com companies. Telecoms had the beneﬁt of 
being well-established companies, in many cases ex monopolies or state-run 
enterprises, with low volatility earnings and an existing and large-scale client base. They 
also had tangible assets and owned and developed ﬁbre optic networks, routers, 
wireless systems and telecoms equipment that were the underlying infrastructure of 
the internet9. It seemed like they were in a perfect place to receive a high share of the 
future revenues driven by the internet in e-shopping.   
But investors signiﬁcantly overstated the returns on the capital investment that these 
companies made. This was partly a consequence of new entrants and partly because of 
the huge scale of capital invested. Competition was stimulated by de-regulation of the 
industry, led by the US, which introduced the telecoms act of 1996. The act deregulated 
the broadcast and telecoms industry in order to provide an environment that could take 
advantage of the technological convergence of these trends and a surge in capital 
investment followed. According to the Federal Communications Commission, the 
amount of ﬁbre optic cable laid in the US went from one million miles in 1996 to 10 
million by 2000, much ﬁnanced by debt. When Global Crossing and WorldCom 
collapsed, they had $25bn and $100bn of debt. A similar pattern occurred across 
Europe. In the UK, a spending spree occurred after the government allowed 3G 
spectrum auctions in April 2000 which generated £22.5bn in revenues for the 
government and similar auctions in Germany raised roughly $30bn. Ultimately, however, 
the capex boom resulted in severe overcapacity in bandwidth for internet usage. While 
the ﬁxed costs of these new networks were very high, the marginal costs of sending 
signals over them was very low101
1.  
Increasingly, competition forced prices down and by 2004 the cost of bandwidth had 
fallen by more than 90%, despite internet usage doubling every few years. As late as 
2005, as much as 85% of broadband capacity in the US was still going unused. Many 
companies could not repay their signiﬁcant debts in the US and some of the auctions for 
3G licenses in 1999 had to be re-run because the original companies that made the bids 
defaulted on their bids. When the auction was re-run, the bids were only 10% of the 
original $4bn raised12. 
Ultimately, the valuation of these companies collapsed, alongside the broader 
technology bubble. Between 2000 and 2002, the Dow Jones technology index lost 86% 
and the wireless communications index dropped 89% with 23 companies going 
bankrupt in the US alone and the failure of WorldCom became the biggest stock market 
failure in history with a loss of $102 billion in July 200213.

As in other examples in history, the problem was not a miscalculation of the 
growth potential of the technology, but rather that investors had attributed too 
much future value to the companies that had built technology and infrastructure 
to provide it. In this case, like many others before, the ultimate winners were the 
companies that could ‘free ride’ off this spending and utilise the capacity to build 
business models that could leverage the technology and provide new products and 
services. Many of these winners did not emerge until the onset of the smart phone in 
2006 and the onset of apps which then spawned a growing industry of platform 
companies, ride sharing, social media and so on.  
History lessons; the opportunity 
While the market for a technology innovation can become dominated by a few very large 
companies for a long time, the initial transformative technology becomes a conduit that 
kickstarts a whole range of other innovations and, with this, new companies and market 
opportunities. At the same time, one of the other characteristics of technology is 
that once new innovations become widely used by companies, the main 
beneﬁciary is the consumer who enjoys new products and services at lower 
prices. 
For example, while coal and steam were the foundations of the First Industrial 
Revolution, a range of other developments quickly followed. Mass migration to cities 
and the movement away from agriculture resulted in demand for new consumer 
products. Mechanised looms transformed the textile industry and domestic products 
such as soaps, which were typically made at home, began to be manufactured in 
factories. This generated new markets and became the catalyst for the building of 
consumer brands, advertising and marketing. During the railway boom, the steam 
engine spawned the development of the railways, and the network effect and 
connectivity then allowed other technologies to develop. 
Similarly, during the Second Industrial Revolution, the harnessing of gas and oil to create 
electricity was one of the key driving inventions. But this, in turn, enabled the mass 
production of steel, the development of the internal combustion engine and the 
automobile. The start of the modern assembly line in factories became a further 
innovation, transforming the production and distribution of a range of new products. 
Similarly, the network impact of the railway boom and the telegraph fostered a host of 
new market opportunities and companies. 
With the computer age of the Third Industrial Revolution came the rapid acceleration of 
service industries. The ﬁrst transistorised consumer products started to appear in 1952, 
opening new markets as consumers were willing and able to pay a premium for low 
power consumption and portability. By the mid-1950s, prototype silicon devices were 
developed in Northern California. Plastics and lighter materials also generated signiﬁcant 
new growth markets, while the growth of multinational companies opened new market 
opportunities. 
A similar pattern emerged with the internet as its rapid roll-out and adoption enabled the 
development and penetration of the smartphone. This, in turn, spawned an industry of 
5 September 2024

companies based on the ‘apps’ used on these phones (think of the revolution in taxi and 
food delivery services, for example) and the ‘internet of things’ (a world of connected 
appliances and devices). 
So, while the leading tech today will most likely remain dominant in their respective 
markets, rapid innovation, particularly around machine learning and AI, will likely create a 
new wave of tech superstars. It is probable that AI and robotics will not only create new 
faster-growing innovative companies but also raise the prospect of major restructuring 
gains in non-technology sectors. 
AI Is Still Not in a Bubble... but Diversiﬁcation Is Important  
Despite the signiﬁcant interest that AI has generated, it still does not appear to 
have driven a bubble in valuations which sets it apart, so far at least, from 
previous narrative investment cycles like the internet in the late 1990s. The 
dominant companies are less likely to be in a bubble if we compare their valuations to 
other periods. Current valuations are much lower than have been typical in other recent 
bubble periods, stretching back to the Nifty 50 era of the early 1970s, the Japanese 
bubble in the late 1980s and indeed the technology bubble in 2000 (Exhibit 5). For 
example, the median PE and EC/Sales of the 7 biggest technology companies today is 
roughly half that of the dominant 7 at the peak of the technology bubble in 2000.

Perhaps more importantly, however, the current dominant companies are much more 
proﬁtable and have stronger balance sheets than those that dominated during the tech 
bubble (Exhibit 6).

Over-investment risks 
While the dominant companies may have justiﬁable valuations based on their current 
and expected cash ﬂows, there remains a risk that they will not achieve the returns on 
their investment that the market currently assumes. 
From the late 1990s, software and, later, cloud computing were able to be highly 
effective in leveraging the technologies with very high margins and low capex. The era of 
ultra-low interest rates following the ﬁnancial crisis rewarded these business models 
relative to traditional industry that had very high capital invested but achieved low 
returns (see Exhibit 7). Most of the AI ‘hyper-scalers’ emerged out of these successes 
and have the scale and cash ﬂows to invest. Nevertheless, the AI winners of today 
are no longer capital-light businesses. Just as we saw with the networking 
companies of the internet, AI is driving a major capex boom and threatens to stiﬂe 
the high rates of returns that have characterised the sector over the past 15 years 
and which current valuations imply will continue. 
 
Exhibit 6: The current dominant companies are much more proﬁtable and have stronger balance sheets than those that dominated during 
the tech bubble

Many leading tech companies are now ramping up their spending at an extraordinary 
rate. According to Alphabet, spending on capex was $12bn in Q1 2024, driven 
‘overwhelmingly by investment in our technical infrastructure, with the largest 
component for servers, followed by data centers’. For the year it expects a similar run 
rate, so close to $50bn. A new forecast from the International Data Corporation (IDC) 
Worldwide Artiﬁcial Intelligence Spending Guide shows that global spending on AI, 
including software, hardware and services for AI-centric systems, is expected to grow at 
a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 27% over the 2022-2026 forecast with 
spending on AI-centric systems expected to surpass $300 billion in 2026. Nvidia has 
predicted that $1 trillion will be invested by 2027 in data center upgrading alone. The 
hyper-scalers alone now represent 23% of total S&P 500 capex and R&D.

Investors have become increasingly conﬁdent about the future revenues in both 
semiconductors and hardware ‘enablers’.  
Perhaps surprisingly, despite all the capital invested in technology, there is little evidence 
that the age of the intellectual property assets are rising. Indeed, since the start of this 
century, estimates suggest the age is declining (Exhibit 10). Usage of ChatGPT has 
continued to grow, whether looking at numbers of visits or time spent (Exhibit 11). 
 
The risk is that as competition increases, the returns and margins begin to fade, 
and the growth rates of many of the current dominant companies will likely adjust 
lower. Nevertheless, there are some reasons to be more hopeful that in previous 
technology cycles. Importantly, while capex is rising sharply, our US strategy team 
notes that capex relative to cash ﬂows is less alarming. At the height of the Tech Bubble, 
TMT stocks were spending more than 100% of cash ﬂows from operations (CFO) on 
capex and R&D. Today, the capex and R&D as a share of CFO equals 72% currently in

the US, compared with a 40-year median of 67%.  
Furthermore, as our technology analysts have argued, the signiﬁcant step-up in capex 
may actually generate strong returns and, by comparison, may not  be very different 
from what we saw with the cloud innovations. They reﬂect on the 2013-2016 time frame 
when Microsoft was spending aggressively on capex to build out Azure when, at one 
point, gross margins for Azure were negative but then became hugely proﬁtable. They 
argue that Microsoft Gen-AI revenues ($5-6 billion annualised) have scaled more rapidly 
compared to Azure, which took roughly 7 years to get to comparable levels. Though 
capex intensity is up sharply overall for the leading AI tech companies, today it is still 
roughly where we were in the Azure cycle at comparable revenues.  
Additionally, while capex has increased, and expectations of future revenues have 
accelerated, the period of ‘payback’ on cash ﬂows embedded in current valuations 
remains much lower than it was at the peak of the technology bubble in 2000 
(Exhibit 12). 
 
AI and the Risk of Concentration 
While these companies may be less highly valued than in other narrative-led 
bubble periods, the scale of market dominance is greater this time.

This, again, may not be irrational. The power of the dominant companies to generate 
shareholder returns and compound over time is a feature that has been recognised in 
much of the literature on the subject. Bessembinder14, for example, conducted a study 
of all 26,168 companies in the US that had publicly listed equity since 1929 and found 
that, over time, while aggregate wealth creation had been $47
.4 trillion, the majority 
reduced shareholder wealth. He also found that the extent to which stock market wealth 
creation is concentrated in a few companies has increased over time. One of the 
reasons for this may be the growing issue of scale required in dominant technology 
platforms, particularly when it comes to compute power and R&D spending. 
Furthermore, the scale of the investments required to ramp up in this industry preclude 
some smaller competitors, particularly now that interest rates have increased and the 
cost of capital is higher.  
Nevertheless, with markets being increasingly dependent on the fortunes of so 
few, the collateral damage of stock-speciﬁc mistakes is likely to be particularly 
high. Furthermore, other leading companies in other sectors, or parts of the World, 
enjoy lower volatility than these companies. This is true, for example, for the 
GRANOLAS (a list of 11 dominant companies in Europe). Prior to the market correction 
in July, the ‘Magniﬁcent 7’ stocks had explained around 50% of the S&P 500’s returns 
(Exhibit 15).

Is high stock concentration a big risk? 
Historically, with new entrants emerging, few companies remain unscathed as 
competition either forces companies to disappear, merge or be acquired. From this 
perspective, a market that becomes dominated by a few stocks becomes increasingly 
vulnerable to either disruption or anti-trust regulation. Even companies that have enjoyed 
near monopoly power in the past have ultimately succumbed to these pressures. 
Standard Oil, for example, controlled over 90% of oil production in the US by 1900 
n
and 85% of sales. 
Bell Telecom had reached 90% of US households by 1969. Just before it 
n
relinquished control of the Bell Operating Companies and was split into different 
companies in 1982, it reached 5.5% of the market. 
General Motors’ earnings were more than 10% of the S&P 500 between 1955 and 
n
1973. At its peak, General Motors had a 50% market share in the US and was the 
world’s largest automaker from 1931 through to 2007
. 
IBM became dominant in mainframe computers in the 1970s and had over a 60% 
n
market share in mainframe computers in 1981. 
Microsoft became dominant in PCs, and by 2000 had a 97% share in operating 
n
systems in the PC and laptop markets. 
There are, for example, only 51 companies that have appeared every year in the Fortune 
500 since 1955. In other words, just over 10% of the Fortune 500 companies in 1955 
have remained on the list during the 69 years through this year15. Based on this 
history, it would appear reasonable to assume that when the Fortune 500 list is released 
70 years from now in the 2090s, almost all of today’s top companies will no longer exist

as currently conﬁgured and will be replaced by new companies in new, emerging 
industries that we can’t even imagine today. 
 
This process sometimes accelerates or slows down but since 1980, for example, more 
than 35% of S&P 500 constituents have turned over during the average 10-year 
period, largely reﬂecting innovation. 
Of the current top 50 companies in the US, only half were in the top 50 a decade ago, 
and many did not even exist before the 1990s (NVIDIA (1993), Amazon (1994), Netﬂix 
(1997), PayPal (1998), Alphabet (1998), Salesforce (1999), Tesla (2003) and Facebook 
(2004). More recently Nvidia has grown at an extraordinary pace, becoming the world’s 
biggest company from a relatively small base just a few years ago. 
As a result of changes in leadership and, by implication, growth, history would suggest 
that buying dominant companies generates lower returns over time. For example, 
Exhibit 17 shows the total return on average since 1980 that would have been achieved 
by buying and holding the top 10 stocks over different time horizons (from 1 year out to 
10 years), while Exhibit 18 shows the same in relative returns (compared with the S&P 
500). These data suggest that, while absolute returns remain good for the 
dominant companies, these strong returns fade over time, and they often remain 
solid ‘compounders’
. Importantly, however, the returns are generally negative for 
dominant companies if an investor buys and holds them as other faster-growing 
companies come along and outperform.

None of this means that these companies would necessarily be poor investments. 
They may well remain good compounders, be more defensive and enjoy lower 
volatility and higher risk-adjusted returns. However, it does suggest that: 
1) 
The dominant companies are unlikely to be the fastest-growing companies over 
the next decade. 
2) 
The stock-speciﬁc risk in the index is currently very high, suggesting an 
increasing pay-off through diversiﬁcation.

Leadership changes - Music and markets  
Narrative-led trends in markets, while often backed by quality fundamentals, can also be seen in other 
areas of life. Whether it is in fashion, art, music or stock markets, leaders rarely stay dominant forever and 
what is most sought after does not stay constant. In music for example, Taylor Swift, is now the 
largest-selling artist. She also made history by being the ﬁrst artist since the charts began in 1958 to take 
all top 10 songs on Billboard Hot 100 with her album ‘Midnights’ in 2022, overtaking the previous winner, 
Drake, who had 9 of the 100s top 10 in 2021. So new leadership is not conﬁned to the stock market. 
Indeed, just as with stocks, there are the long-term staples – those that stay dominant in their category, or 
large over long periods of time. The Beatles have the most ‘Hot 100’ singles of anyone over time (20), 
while Mariah Carey has the most as a solo artist (19 – as well as the only artist to have a No. 1 in four 
distinct decades). But these artists are now not growing their downloads in the same way as Taylor Swift is 
today. It is similar in the stock market. Some of the greatest leaders have disappeared, some stay as 
household names, but new leaders emerge and can become dominant very quickly. There are 5 
companies in the top 10 today that were in the top 10 in 2015, 3 that were in the top 10 in 2010 and 
just 1 that featured in the top 10 in 2005. In the music charts, there are 3 artists in the current top 10 
that were also in the top 10 in 2015, 3 in 2010 and none that were in the top 10 in 2005.

The risk of anti-trust regulation 
In addition to the risk of competition and failure to adapt, regulatory pressures pose a 
risk for very dominant companies with increasingly monopolistic power (see: US 
Economics Analyst: Concentration, Competition, and the Antitrust Policy Outlook, 18 
July 2021) and the recent collapse in many Technology companies’ performance in China 
illustrates this. The tech sector and internet platforms have become a major political 
focus in both the US and China – the markets with the highest concentration of 
large-cap Technology stocks. The most recent news on the DOJ subpoena of Nvidia in 
its antitrust probe, and the share price reaction, is an example of the impact that such 
news can have on highly rated growth companies. 
Social attitudes towards tech companies may also be changing as they are seen 
increasingly as gaining huge proﬁts while employing relatively few people. The 
continued rise in the proﬁt share of GDP relative to the labour share of GDP leads 
(Exhibit 21) into the narrative that many of the most proﬁtable companies need reigning 
in, or taxing more. Many of these companies that were historically difﬁcult to tax are 
becoming easier targets as they build up large data centers and physical capital. As 
Exhibit 22 shows, their proﬁts have increased by much more than their tax rates in 
recent years. Governments will be keen to ﬁnd new sources of tax revenue and the 
increasingly high energy demands of the major technology leaders might be seen as a 
justiﬁcation for higher taxes. According to the International Energy Agency, data centers 
already account for about 1% to 1.5% of global electricity use16. 
 
Our US strategists’ analysis of company stock performance following previous antitrust 
lawsuits by the DoJ and FTC shows that revenue growth slowed, valuation compressed 
and shares underperformed the overall index (Exhibit 23, Exhibit 24). However, the 
cases took years to resolve and share price response was often muted during the initial 
stages. The most prominent examples include AT&T
, where a break-up was mandated 
by a consent decree following eight years of litigation (1974-82); MSFT
, where a 
settlement was reached involving a consent decree and changed business practices

following three years of litigation (1998-2000/01); and IBM, where no formal action was 
taken after 13 years of litigation (1969-82) — see: US Equity Views: Equities, antitrust, 
and the “inestimable” value of due process, 13 July 2021. 
 
 
Nevertheless, we see three reasons why dominant tech companies may stay 
bigger for longer in the current cycle than we might have seen in historical 
technology cycles: 
1) 
The tech sector is deﬂationary (Exhibit 25). As long as that is the case, there is no 
real incentive for politicians to attack it. In this way, the tech sector from a policy 
perspective may be different from others, such as banks, supermarkets or energy 
companies, where politicians often argue that the beneﬁts (for example of higher 
interest rates for savers, or lower food and energy prices) are not being passed on to 
consumers. This does not make technology companies immune from regulation, but it is 
more likely to come from issues around privacy and use of data, or the impact on 
mental health, than on pricing.

T
echnology is increasingly seen as an issue of national security. Technology, 
including cyber security, chips and increasingly AI, are seen as a critical part of national 
infrastructure and strategic defense. This has become more important as geopolitical 
tensions rise across the world, making it less likely that a government would support 
anti-trust legislation that undermines a competitive lead. For example, the US in its 
Foreign Direct Product Rule (FDPR) allows US ofﬁcials to control the ﬂow of foreign 
products built with US-originated technology. IBM recently has announced the closure 
of its China R&D operation with the loss of 1,000 jobs, and there are recent news 
reports that ASML will put more curbs on its China business. 
3) 
The technology sector invests hugely in R&D. Given that the current incumbent 
winners are so cash-generative, they have an ability to maintain this investment, 
strengthening their market ‘moat’ and also potential future growth. According to Erik 
Brynjolfsson,  Professor and Senior Fellow at the Stanford Institute for Human-Centered 
AI, the top 10% of ﬁrms by market value account for over 60% of this intangible digital 
investment (see Top of Mind: The post-pandemic future of work, 29 July 2021). “They’re 
pulling further away from ﬁrms at the median and bottom, so that inequality is growing 
over time. That’s leading to a ‘winner-take-most’ outcome in which superstar ﬁrms are 
harvesting most of the gains from new technologies rather than those insights diffusing 
evenly throughout the economy. And that’s also happening at the level of individuals and 
workers — the labour share of income has fallen in recent decades, and the top 1% is 
getting ever wealthier as they capture a growing share of total income”
. 
Our analysts also see signiﬁcant opportunities for secondary growth opportunities in 
cloud computing coming from AI. They estimate that the Cloud Software TAM (IaaS, 
PaaS, and SaaS) could approach $2 trillion by 2030 (CAGR: 22%, 2024-2030). Their 
analysis suggests Gen-AI spending could constitute 10–15% of the Cloud Software

market ($200-$300bn) as spending gradually extends beyond the hyper-scalers and 
foundation model providers to become more pervasive across all three layers of the tech 
stack (see: Gen-AI Part VIII: Catalyst or Culprit?, 25 Aug 2024). 
Opportunities for Diversiﬁcation 
Ex Tech Compounders (ETCs) 
While technology may not be in a bubble, the characteristics of large cap technology can 
be found in a more diverse and diversiﬁed portfolio. It is true that few companies match 
the earnings growth that the largest tech companies have been enjoying; however, 
there are plenty of companies that do have high margins and returns on investment, 
reinvest for future growth and have strong balance sheets that exist outside of the tech 
sector. We call these the Ex Tech Compounders, or ETCs. 
We have put together a list of global ETCs, which can be found in the Appendix. The list 
looks for companies that have market caps above $10bn and have high margins (EBITDA 
> 14%, EBIT > 12%, Net Income > 10%), high proﬁtability (ROE > 10%), strong balance 
sheets (ND/Equity < 75%, ND/EBITDA < 2x), low volatility (Vol < 50), strong growth 
prospects (sales > 4% and earnings > 8%) and have consistently grown their earnings 
over the past decade. 
As Exhibit 26 shows, the ETCs have outperformed the global market over the past year 
and have kept pace with the performance of the ‘Magniﬁcent 7’. The valuation of our 
global ETCs list is in line with its average since 2016 and the list trades at the lowest 
premium to the world stock market since 2018. 
 
Healthcare and Biotech 
One area likely to beneﬁt from AI and the ability to analyse large data sets is healthcare 
and bio technology. We have already seen very dramatic reductions in the costs of DNA 
sequencing (Exhibit 28) with the cost of sequencing an entire gnome falling from $100

. The pace of this reduction far outpaces Moore’s law and 
suggests a signiﬁcant increase in the productivity and cost of developing new medicines 
and therapeutic discoveries (). AI has also been instrumental in speeding up data 
processing in the development of vaccines. For example, linearFold, an algorithm for 
ribonucleic acid (RAN) secondary structure recognition, increased the speed times for 
Covid-19 sequencing from 55 minutes to 27 seconds18. 
The healthcare industry and biotech have signiﬁcantly underperformed large cap US tech 
companies in recent years, suggesting that the opportunities are not fully reﬂected in 
valuations (Exhibit 29). Our healthcare analysts believe that AI can accelerate synthetic 
data generation for drug development and diagnostics, generating designs for novel 
drugs, personalised medicine, diversity and equity in healthcare, manufacturing and 
supply chain efﬁciency, and approval and launch materials.   
 
Banks and Financial Services 
Our analysts see: 1) Enhanced coding efﬁciency, 2) Data extraction: Synthesise data and 
content from large datasets or documents, 3) Chatbots, 4) Automation, 5) Human/AI 
collaboration. In Europe, for example, our banks team estimate the potential AI adoption 
uplift to ROE at c.200bp (excluding the upfront investment required). They highlight the 
AI impact is most clearly driven by numerous modest cost gains, with the cost 
opportunity c.3x the revenue opportunity. 
Consumer Products and Services 
Academic work points to only a small proportion of the social returns from 
technological advances over the 1948-2001 period being captured by producers, 
indicating that most of the beneﬁts of technological change are passed on to consumers 
rather than captured by producers. These results indicate that the bubble of

new-economy stocks in the 1990s resulted from the alchemist fallacy19. 
This was evident in the case of the internet. Waves of new products and services 
emerged in the years after the bubble burst with the emergence of the smart phone 
and apps. Arguably, many of these products did not answer an urgent problem that 
needed to be solved but rather developed new products that then created demand – 
ride-sharing, platform business, social media and so on. It is likely that a similar pattern 
will develop with AI. 
Robotics and Cyber Security 
According to Cybercrime Magazine, cybercrime would have a value equivalent to the 
third-largest economy globally, at $10.5 trillion annually by 2025, while Statistica 
suggests it will rise to $13.8 trillion by 2028. The demand for cyber security will rise 
dramatically and AI can help in this process.   
Current processes cannot keep up with the volume of malware, estimated at around 1 
billion programmes with 560,000 new pieces each day according to DataProt20. AI 
automation can help to detect and differentiate between those that are most harmful21. 
Our analysts expect Security vendors to emerge as beneﬁciaries across both the 
infrastructure and application layers as well as within data posture investments as 
security continues to trend higher as a percentage of total budgets. 
In robotics, a whole range of other applications driven by emerging companies might 
become large markets —autonomous driving, for example, or humonoid robotics, 
enhanced by AI. Already advances are evolving rapidly and according to industry 
estimates the global market for humanoid robots could reach £214bn by 203222.  
Of course, it is not possible to anticipate what these products may be or who is likely to 
develop them, but that is another reason for ensuring broad diversiﬁcation in equity 
exposure as well as balanced portfolios have access to private markets where many of 
the nascent companies may be. 
Ethics and nostalgia markets 
In past technology cycles, the second-round impacts on work and society often drive 
new areas of consumer growth. It is likely, for example, that more AI will mean more 
demand for fact-checking services. The ability to work more productively from home 
may mean the regentriﬁcation of shopping and entertainment in neighbourhoods close 
to large-density populations. The growth of artiﬁcial immersive entertainment may also 
boost demand for experiences in the real world. This might reﬂect the growing 
popularity of goods and services that are seen as ‘authentic’ or nostalgic. Retro ‘crafts’ 
are growing in popularity, whether it be the growth reality TV programmes where

contestants compete in baking, spelling, sowing or even ballroom dancing competitions. 
These fashions are spreading into retail. According to Grand View Research, for 
example, the market for so-called ‘artisanal’ bakery products was valued globally at 
$95.13 billion in 2022 and is likely to grow at a compound rate of 5.7% from 2023 to 
203023. The focus on sustainability and interest in the past together create new 
consumer markets. According to research conducted by GlobalData for ThredUP
, a US 
second-hand store, the resale clothes market is growing at 15 times the rate of 
traditional retail24. According to a report by Statistica, as of 2021, 42% of millennials and 
Gen Z respondents stated that they were likely to shop for second-hand items25. 
A similar trend has emerged in transport with the growth in the ‘sharing’ economy and 
the growth of cycle, scooter and car sharing. Few would have predicted the steady 
growth in the bicycle market a decade ago; the global bicycle market was valued at over 
$64 billion in 2022 and is expected to grow at a compound rate of 9.7% from 2023 to 
203026. Perhaps even more striking is how the bicycle is outselling the car. Analysis of 
30 European countries by the Confederation of the European Bicycle Industry (CONEBI) 
and the European Cyclists Federation (ECF) suggests that, at the current trajectory, 10 
million more bikes will be sold per year in Europe by 2030, representing a rise of 47% 
compared with 2019. On this basis, the 30 million bikes sold annually in Europe would 
be more than double the annual sales of cars27
. 
Ethically produced products and services is also a growing market and AI can help. 
Research from Bain found that 7% of consumers in rich developed countries are willing 
to pay a premium for sustainably sourced products and brands28. AI can help develop a 
supply chain inventory, making it easier for companies to prove provenance and quality 
of their components and ingredients. 
In the 21st century, in a highly digitalised world where almost everyone is connected to 
the internet and the cutting edge of technology threatens to displace jobs and 
companies, it is meaningful that one of the biggest company in Europe is LVMH. This is 
a company that sells the value of heritage in historic brands. It was formed in 1987 
through the merger of two old companies: Louis Vuitton (founded in 1854) and Moet 
Hennessey, which itself was a merger in 1971 between Moet & Chandon, the 
champagne producer (founded in 1743) and Hennessey, producer of cognac (founded in 
1765). According to its website, the company develops the brands that ‘perfectly 
encapsulate all that they have embodied for our customers for centuries’.

Global Strategy Paper


As the ubiquity of technology increases and individuals increase their reliance on 
technology as they communicate via networks, the value they place on 
‘authenticity’ and human connectivity – which can evoke a nostalgic image of a 
simpler, pre-digital life – is likely to grow. 
This is true across many product 
categories, including food. 
The old economy and infrastructure 
Increasingly, the ambitions of large cap tech companies are dependent on greater 
electricity generation and infrastructure. Many of the companies that stand to beneﬁt 
from this trend are in the ‘old economy’ and have much lower valuations, having 
stagnated and disappointed for many years. AI could continue to boost returns in the 
Technology space, but for these companies to fulﬁll their potential, they will need huge 
increases in electrical power (and, with it demand for infrastructure spend and copper). 
Our analysts estimate that data center power demand is poised to grow 160% by the 
end of the decade, which should drive a signiﬁcant acceleration to a level of electricity 
growth in the US and Europe not seen in a generation (see GS Sustain: AI/data centers’ 
global power surge and the Sustainability impact, 28 April 2024). 
After stagnating over the last decade, our US utilities analysts expect US electricity 
demand to rise at a 2.4% compound annual growth rate (CAGR) over 2022-2030, with 
data centers accounting for roughly 90bp of that growth, and data centers will likely 
more than double their electricity use by 2030. This implies that the share of total US 
power demand accounted for by data centers will increase from around 3% currently to 
8% by 2030, translating into a 15% CAGR in data center power demand from 
2023-2030. A similar trend is in play in Europe and Asia. Our European utilities analysts 
also expect a secular capex supercycle ahead with European investments in power grids 
accelerating by 80-100%, depending on the region. And on the renewables front, they 
expect Europe to add nearly 800 gigawatts (GW) of wind and solar over the coming 
10-15 years, nearly tripling the amount currently installed in the region (see: Gen AI: Too 
much to spend, too little beneﬁt?, 25 June 2024). 
Decarbonisation and an energy transition is what is needed to generate this 
power. But to do this, a capex super cycle is needed that will beneﬁt many of the 
left-behind value sectors.
