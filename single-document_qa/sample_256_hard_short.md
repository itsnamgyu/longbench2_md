# Question

Which is not the main purpose of the components mentioned in Chapter III?

# Choices

- A: The robot needs to perceive its current state within the scene through visual and tactile feedback, thus it is necessary to encode the visual and tactile signals present in the scene.
- B: In real-world robotic manipulation, visual observations are not always available due to occlusion, but knowledge about object dynamics requires interactive feedback. Therefore, a more complex mechanism is needed to estimate the world states using more variant information.
- C: To enable model-predictive control, a dynamics prediction model  that predicts future states given the estimated current states and potential actions is required.
- D: After obtaining the learned state estimator and dynamics predictor,  planning is needed to predict future actions over potential future states.

# Answer

D
