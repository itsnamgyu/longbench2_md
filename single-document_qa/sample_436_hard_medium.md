# Question

In this review, which statements is correct?

# Choices

- A: In CCC history, researcher found that the growth factor could facilitate the growth of cells and given the fact that platelet and other cells could release growth factors. Therefore, cancer cellsâ€™ growth mainly is stimulated by other cells signals.
- B: In CCC mechanism, it mentioned that the endocrine cells regulate the secretion by detecting the concentration of specific substances. Therefore, by employing single cell seq technique, researcher could analyze how the endocrine cells could be activated by glucose, electrolytes, and other hormones by specific computational tools mentioned in this article.
- C: This article summarizes the computational tools for analyzing the cell-cell interaction. The tools in permutation-based tool can generally classified into two categories (discrete and continuous) based on the methods to evaluate the interactions.
- D: The summary part mentioned the potential improvements by including multi-omics methods. Therefore, to better understand the CCC mechanism, researcher could involve transcriptomics, viriomics, and etc.

# Answer

C
