# Question

Can the proposed semi-structured multigrid in this article bring actual performance improvement than the unstructured multigrid? Please explain reasons.

# Choices

- A: Yes. It could improve performance because the computation kernels on semi-structured grids can be faster than those on unstructured grids.
- B: No. It only built up a multigrid framework, but the underlying kernels were still implemented in unstructured formats.
- C: Yes. Its improvement resulted from fewer numbers of iteration to converge.
- D: Its improvement cannot be evaluated directly. On one hand, its underlying kernels were still in unstructured formats. On the other hand, it could reduce numbers of iteration to converge.

# Answer

D
